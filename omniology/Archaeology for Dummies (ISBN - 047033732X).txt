About the Author
Being an archaeologist was something Nancy Marie White wanted to do from 
the time she learned how to spell the word as a kid. She was interested in 
Native American cultures, outdoor adventure, and the romance of finding 
ancient things and lost knowledge. After earning a BA in history, she went to 
live in Mexico, where she saw that studying archaeology and the rest of 
anthropology would lead to a fascinating life. She earned a PhD from Case 
Western Reserve University in Cleveland (home of rock and roll), and is now 
professor of anthropology at the University of South Florida, Tampa, and a 
long-time member of the Register of Professional Archaeologists. 
White’s research includes finding and sometimes excavating sites of all time 
periods. She’s currently studying how late prehistoric agricultural societies 
in the U.S. Southeast became complex and why they had no beer. She also 
investigates campsites, villages, and mounds of earlier Native American 
hunter-gatherers, fishers, and gardeners, and lost towns and forts inhabited 
by historic Indians, European-Americans, and African-Americans. Her one kid, 
Tony, spent an entire childhood camping in the woods and digging, and now 
studies engineering. White tries to travel often in order to go somewhere dif-
ferent to visit archaeology. She really believes in public archaeology and the 
potential of the distant past to show us a lot that might be useful in the mod-
ern world.

Author’s Acknowledgments
Thanks are due to many people who helped with this book in different ways. 
Archaeologists Lee Hutchinson and Jeff Du Vernay read the manuscript and 
offered great comments. Malaysian social scientist Cheng Sim Hew asked 
good questions about archaeology’s value to society. Help with figures, text, 
ideas, and details came from Robbie Baer, Bill Bingham, Susan Harp, Ned 
Jenkins, Roy Larick, Erin Kimmerle, Rochelle Marrinan, Erin Murtha-Celii, 
John O’Hear, Rob Tykot, and Rich Weinstein. Wiley editors Michael Lewis, 
Megan Knoll, and Tim Gallan are superb. Offspring Anthony Orlando White 
and parent Adela Dodero White read and commented upon everything and 
provided constant encouragement and laughs. 
Thanks also to all archaeologists and other scientists whose work I’ve 
described here; I apologize for not being able to cite you by name. I realize 
I’ve taken on a huge responsibility in representing the entirety of the archae-
ological profession and the specific work of thousands of colleagues around 
the world in a single (and, I’m hoping, user-friendly) volume. Perhaps readers 
will let me know about any errors. After all, archaeology is a continual pro-
cess of finding out new information about old things!

Introduction
A
rchaeology is exciting adventure and discovery. It’s also sometimes 
horribly misunderstood and wrongly stereotyped. Many well-educated 
people still think that archaeology is bones, dinosaurs, or fossils, but it’s 
none of these. Archaeological remains are things humans left — artifacts or 
garbage stains in the soil or ruins of huts or palaces. Others think archaeology 
must mean only Egyptian temples or Roman ruins, but archaeology is every-
where that humans have been, including your own back yard and even the 
moon.
Today archaeology is a big part of popular culture, in movies, computer 
games and the news. Authors write about everything from archaeology’s role 
in science fiction to its practical use in the modern world. More professional 
archaeologists, more History Channel specials on the ancient past, and more 
opportunities to see and participate in archaeology now exist than ever before.
This book aims to explore the science, describe the thrills, and show you 
what archaeology is all about, whether you want to get involved via the 
armchair or in digging.
About This Book
I’ve tried to pack a lot into this book to give you at least a little taste of many 
things in the smorgasbord of archaeological topics, including ways that 
archaeology affects your own life that you may not have thought of before.
Here’s what you’ll see in these pages:
 
 What archaeology really is (and misunderstandings about what it isn’t).
 
 The many different kinds of archaeology out there, each of which 
investigates different things.
 
 How archaeologists think and how they use scientific method to 
reconstruct the past from the material record. 
 
 How to do archaeological fieldwork — survey and excavation.
 
 The huge amount of work you need to do after fieldwork for processing 
and analysis of the stuff you dig up.

2
Archaeology For Dummies 
 
 The story of the whole human career — from the first humans through 
modern times — known only or mostly from archaeology.
 
 Guides to help you understand, visit, and do archaeology.
I aim in this book to demystify archaeology, to tell you what it is, how it’s 
done, where you can do it, and what you can learn from it about humanity. 
You should be able to open to any chapter and see the topic of choice, and 
you can also find everything on the topic by looking in the index.
Conventions Used in This Book
Here are a few little things to keep in mind as you read this book, to avoid 
confusion over some details.
Archaeology versus archeology
Both spellings of the word are fine. Usually you see the -aeo version because 
most people, including my editors and publisher, think it’s classier! But the 
U.S. federal government (which, in official documents, always calls itself 
“Federal”), and other entities, have spelling rules insisting on the -eo version. 
Once, when reporting a dig on federal land, I spelled the title “Archaeology.” 
Officials told me that (among other revisions) I had to take the a out, so I 
redid the title as “Rchaeology.” For some reason, they weren’t amused.
Dates
Reading about past times, you see dates given in various ways. In this book, I 
use the terms B.C. (“before Christ” — about 2,000 years ago and earlier) and 
A.D. (Latin words anno domini, translating to “year of our Lord” and actually 
meaning after the birth of Christ — so there is no A.D. 0). A.D. is always 
written before the number to make sense in Latin. These are still the most 
commonly used ways of writing dates in English. Some writers use B.C.E 
(“before the common era” or “before the Christian era”) and C.E. (“common 
era”) to mean the same things but without religious overtones. Another 
notation is B.P., meaning “before the present”; to change B.C. dates to B.P. 
dates, just add 2,000 years.

 Introduction
Measurements
Nearly all modern archaeology uses the metric system because that system 
is internationally understood and the world standard for science. Exceptions 
to this rule may pop up when you’re mapping and digging historic sites 
where objects may have originally been deliberately constructed in feet and 
inches, so measuring them in the same units makes more sense.
You may not be used to metric measurements, so in this book I sometimes 
give them in feet and inches. But just remember that an inch is about 
2
1⁄2 centimeters (cm), a meter (m) is a little over a yard, and about 30 
centimeters is a foot. If you do end up switching to the metric system for 
archaeology, you may never go back!
Anthropology
Most of the archaeology done today is part of anthropology, the social 
science that studies humans in all their biological and cultural aspects. 
Some archaeology falls under the heading of classics or some other field (as 
I describe in Chapter 3). In this book, I try to give you a little of all kinds of 
archaeology while emphasizing that archaeological findings aren’t just cool 
artifacts or ancient treasures but rather clues to exploring human behavior.
What you’re not to read
You don’t have to read the sidebars (the text in gray boxes) — that material 
is interesting but tangential. You don’t have to read text that’s flagged by the 
Technical Stuff icon either. After all, technical stuff isn’t for everybody. 
My Assumptions
In writing this book, I assume that you the reader
 
 Have always loved to read about archaeology or watch it on film.
 
 Like seeing archaeological sites and museums.
 
 Want to join a dig or at least visit one.
 
 Are studying or considering studying archaeology at a college or university.

4
Archaeology For Dummies 
 
 Love old stuff and the excitement of discovery, puzzles, and figuring 
things out.
 
 Enjoy imagining the human past.
If any of these statements is true about you, this book should help you 
explore archaeology’s many and exciting dimensions.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into six parts: Part I defines archaeology and its 
varieties and thought processes. Part II describes the fieldwork — finding 
things. In Part III, you find out what to do with everything after you find it 
and how complicated it is to piece together the puzzle of the human past. In 
Part IV, I relate what archaeology has revealed about that past — all 2 million 
years of it! Part V gives you an idea of why archaeology is relevant to your life 
and how you can go do some yourself. Part VI lists places to visit archaeology.
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing 
Past People Today
This part introduces you to archaeology, how archaeological sites are formed, 
and the nature of the evidence. I give you a little of the glorious history and 
adventure of archaeology and also try to counteract the stereotypes and 
mistakes common in the public media. I list the many different kinds of 
archaeology and discuss how archaeologists think about and try to solve the 
mysteries they investigate, including an example from my own work.
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: 
The Adventure Begins!
In this part, I describe the adventure of fieldwork, how you can prepare, what 
to bring along, and what you can expect. Then I answer the common question, 
“How do you know where to dig?” You discover how archaeological survey 
locates sites, and then the actual excavation and all it entails, from equipment 
to technique. Finally, I go over the ethical issues involved in archaeological 
investigation, from dangerous field conditions to respecting local communities 
and descendants of the people whose stuff you’re digging up.

5
 Introduction
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve 
Only Just Begun
The work after the dig is the largest part of archaeology. Part III explains  how 
you process and analyze the materials and data from the dig and then how 
you piece the past together. I describe laboratory work and artifact analyses 
and then show you how archaeology tells the story of past human behavior 
based on those material remains. To show the wide array of viewpoints in 
archaeological interpretation, I give you some of the major theoretical 
perspectives used to understand past societies.
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs 
the Whole Human Past
In this part, I run briefly through the great drama of what archaeology has 
found out about our ancestors and their lives, from the time of the earliest 
humans through the emergence of ancient civilizations. Only archaeology  
brings this past alive! Even in historic times, archaeology shows much more 
than history can ever tell you, especially about people whose history was 
never written (or was written poorly). Finally, I show you how the method 
of archaeology — using material culture to interpret human behavior — is 
useful to study the modern world in ways no other science can.
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone
This part is about public archaeology (which is really all archaeology today). 
Here I show you the many different kinds of interests in archaeology: political, 
financial, practical, recreational, professional. I give you some case studies of 
recent hot controversies in archaeology. You explore how archaeological 
findings affect many aspects of life in ways you may not expect. I also give you 
tips on how to get involved in archaeology yourself.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In this part, I list (about) ten neat places to visit archaeology in the U.S. and 
outside the U.S. I also include ten fun archaeological experiences. You may 
soon add your own entries to these lists!

Archaeology For Dummies 
Icons Used in the Book
Throughout this book, you’ll see these icons, which I use to highlight 
important information or direct you to interesting tidbits.
 
Archaeology is all about discovery! Though I discuss exciting excavations and 
findings throughout much of the book, this icon tells you about specific fun 
details of particular finds.
 
Archaeology is a scientific pursuit, often with some complicated processes, 
operations, and even equipment. This icon signals examples of areas where 
you need much more expertise than I can provide in this book. But at least 
you see the technical terms (and you can use them to impress friends).
 
I use this icon to remind you about the most crucial concepts in archaeology 
and to point out corrections or true versions of some mistakes.
 
Archaeology brings us face-to-face with our human heritage, whether 
wonderful or disgusting. I use this icon to mark aspects of human nature 
worth thinking about as you discover archaeology’s potential.
 
Whenever I provide specific advice that will aid in actual archaeological work 
or your study of archaeology, I use this Tip icon.
 
I use this icon to point out important safety-related information, misconceptions, 
and other dangers that may threaten your archaeological work or experience.
Where to Go from Here
Jump around and read whatever chapter or section catches your interest. Or 
read the book from front to back. The choice is up to you. Archaeology provides 
wonderful stories of the past and often high adventure in the present. It’s also 
very relevant to modern life. This guide tells you what basics you need to know 
to understand and do it. But you don’t need a pith helmet and safari clothes — 
old jeans, a bandanna, bug spray, sunscreen, and an open mind should suffice! 
After seeing how to do archaeology, you yourself can move, as the old Firesign 
Theater folks said, “forward into the past!”

In this part . . .
A
rchaeology is exciting and romantic — the thrill of 
discovery, the recreation of the glories of the human 
past! But it’s complicated too, and much confusion exists 
about what it is and how it works. In this part, I define 
archaeology and explain how it developed and branched 
into specialties. Chapter 1 shows you how archaeology is 
unique in its method of investigation. I explain what 
archaeological evidence consists of and how archaeologi-
cal sites are formed; you also get some of the background 
and history of how archaeology was developed by those 
early adventurers and explorers. Chapter 2 makes it clear 
that archaeology isn’t dinosaurs or treasure hunting or 
looting artifacts for sale. All the many kinds of archaeol-
ogy can be confusing, so Chapter 3 helps you sort them 
out. To understand how an archaeologist thinks and 
investigates, read through Chapter 4.

In This Chapter

 Understanding the site-formation processes
 Checking out the players and developments on the road to modern archaeology
A
rchaeology is exciting adventure and romantic intrigue as well as 
amazing scientific investigation. That’s how you see it in movies and 
the news, and even if the excavation is downtown under the sidewalk or in 
the middle of some farmer’s field, that adventure is still there because you’re 
trying to make the unknown known. The dig unearths not only neat artifacts 
from ancient times but also the often-dramatic stories of how past humans 
got along in the world — maybe with some lessons for the present day.
Because confusion and misconceptions about the nature of archaeology are 
everywhere, in this chapter I define archaeology and show you how it really 
is detective work on a big scale. Here you discover how archaeological sites 
are formed, how modern archaeology developed, and even how you yourself 
probably do archaeology all the time without realizing it!
So What Is Archaeology Anyway?
A simple definition: Archaeology is finding out about past human behavior by 
studying the material evidence left behind.
Archaeology doesn’t necessarily look at the people themselves, but always 
examines their stuff. Archaeology is very distinctive among all the social 
sciences (studies of humans and their behavior) for its unique method: 
studying people not by watching or reading about or talking to them but by 
analyzing what material things they left behind. Material things means 
people’s possessions, residues, and anything else visible or tangible — from 
the tiniest seed bead or corn kernel to the tallest pyramid, from the most 

10
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
nondescript kitchen garbage to the most beautiful gold craftwork. Today it 
also means people’s hair and DNA as well as dark stains and other features in 
the soil left from burying, building, and so on.
The method: It’s detective work
Archaeology is exactly like detective work — in fact, it is detective work! 
Most police or private detectives use all the methods archaeologists use:
 
 Carefully measuring, recording, and photographing the evidence at the 
(crime) scene.
 
 Using painstakingly accurate techniques to recover, process, and 
analyze the evidence.
 
 Getting background information on all the people, places, and times 
involved.
 
 Interviewing knowledgeable people about what happened and what 
other evidence they may have or know about.
 
 Using techniques from other sciences like physics and chemistry to 
learn more about the evidence.
 
 Stopping for coffee and doughnuts (or a cold beer) at a little place close 
by to see what else you can find out.
 
 Compiling all the information to describe what happened.
 
 Stating your case and arguing it, sometimes involving other experts, 
politicians, journalists, and the public.
 
 Continuing to investigate if you can’t tie up all the loose ends.
Everyone does archaeology sometimes
Archaeological knowledge is about us. You can 
do the archaeology of the far distant past or the 
very recent past. Everyone does some archae-
ology, probably nearly every day. For example, 
you may know by the car in the driveway who is 
home, or by the things thrown around the living 
room what the roommate or kids have been 
doing in there. Parents, especially, do a lot of 
archaeology (“Did you brush your teeth before 
bed?” “Sure, Mom. Always, Mom.” “Then why 
is the toothbrush still dry?”).

11
 Chapter 1: What Archaeology Is
The goal: Understand people
When you do archaeology, you don’t dig just to get some cool artifact (that’s 
treasure hunting or looting). You don’t really want the finds for yourself, 
anyway — they go into collections or museum exhibits for all to enjoy and 
study further, if desired. No, you want to understand past people through what 
they left on and in the ground (or elsewhere). You examine the once-lost traces 
of the past for several good reasons. The goals of archaeology are to
 
 Study the human past across space and time.
 
 Reconstruct past human behavior and ways of life.
 
 Understand past cultural systems (social, economic, political, religious) 
and how they changed through time.
 
 Help conserve the fragile material record of past peoples and interpret 
this heritage for people today.
 
 Bring the story of the human past to the public for enjoyment, 
education, and even practical use.
The Nature of Archaeological Evidence
Anything made by humans is an artifact, including a thought, a song, or a 
smile. In archaeology, artifacts are human-made material objects — you have 
to be able to see or measure them and retrieve information from them.
Your materials are all the physical items you dig up or otherwise obtain 
from the archaeological sites, and your data are all the bits of information 
you retrieve from the dig, the sites, and all the physical remains. So you may 
wash, sort, and identify your archaeological materials in the laboratory. Then 
when you list each type of artifact and ecofact (more on these in the following 
sections) on a table, you create data. The same is true for all the information 
you record as you excavate a feature or make a map — these are more data, 
as are all your notes, files, photos, and other information. The following 
sections describe some categories of these material remains.

12
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
Artifacts
Any object made by humans is an artifact. Usually you think of ancient 
ceramic pots or arrowheads, and indeed these items are everywhere at 
archaeological sites. But a temple or palace is an artifact too — one made 
up of individual artifacts such as bricks or stone blocks. A stone used to 
hammer and chip other stone to make the arrowhead is also an artifact; 
even though it’s not deliberately shaped, it’s covered with grinding and 
chipping marks and thus modified by human activity. Finally, the flakes of 
stone chipped while making stone tools are also artifacts, though they may 
or may not have been discarded. Most often, artifacts are portable objects 
excavated and brought back to a laboratory for study.
Ecofacts
Ecofact is a term archaeologists invented to classify natural objects used by 
humans without modification. Animal bones left from dinner or pollen from 
gathered plants are ecofacts. But if a bone has been modified to become a 
harpoon point, that modification makes it an artifact. Even phosphates or 
other chemicals in the soil are ecofacts showing that people threw their 
organic waste on the ground.
Features
Anything that’s made by humans but is too big to bring back (intact) to the 
laboratory is a feature. Features can be garbage pits, hearths, post holes or 
postmolds (where poles were once in the ground), graves, roads, drip lines 
from roofs of old buildings, building foundations, storage pits, clusters of 
artifacts, and even footprints. Technically you can cut out a block of soil 
around a feature such as a footprint and bring it back to study under better 
conditions in the lab, but most features have to be excavated (or studied and 
then preserved) where they’re first uncovered.
Sites
Archaeological sites are places where human habitation or other activity took 
place and where artifacts, features, and ecofacts are all found. You can have 
sites of different sizes, shapes, and time periods, from a small stone quarry 
where bits of chipped rock are lying around to the ruins of a big palace where 
bits of the quarried stone blocks are left lying around. Depending upon what’s 
preserved, a site can be small or large, shallow or deep.

13
 Chapter 1: What Archaeology Is
Components and boundaries
When people of one time period use a place that people of an earlier time 
already used, they add another component to a site. A multicomponent site 
at a prime location such as a shoreline can have cultural deposits going back 
thousands of years, one component overlying the next. The ideal site has a 
nice, culturally sterile layer between each component so you can tell them 
apart. In reality it seldom works out like this. Later people come in and dig 
into the site and mix the older stuff with their stuff and never even think of 
how the archaeologist of the future is going to figure it all out!
Not all sites are visible. Sometimes you do archaeological survey to locate 
sites, including using special techniques if remains are buried or underwater. 
(See Chapter 6 for more on survey.) Finding the boundaries of sites is also 
sometimes tricky and may be impossible without digging.
Regions and isolated finds
You can investigate archaeological sites within a whole natural region, such 
as a river valley or island. Or you may do archaeological survey within an 
arbitrary project area, such as someone’s property lines; in this case, you do 
your best to see where the actual past archaeological site extends, but you 
may never know exactly.
Individual artifact finds of just one or two items are also sometimes called 
sites if they may indicate a specific activity there. But one arrowhead isn’t 
enough — it may have fallen from a deer who galloped away after being shot. 
Criteria for what qualifies as a site can vary according to the archaeologist 
doing the work and the project guidelines. Many professionals now record 
specific isolated finds (IFs) or artifact occurrences (AOs) to indicate something 
was going on in the past, even if they don’t have enough evidence to make it 
a site.
How Archaeological Sites Form
Archaeological sites can develop over great or small amounts of time and 
space, and through large or small actions of humans and of nature. What 
archaeologists call site formation processes can be divided into two 
categories: cultural and natural processes.
Cultural processes
The cultural activities that contribute to the formation of archaeological sites 
are simply everything that humans do that results in material evidence. The 
following list gives you some examples:

14
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
 
 Finding raw materials and making artifacts: Making everything from 
chipped stone tools to pyramids (and the waste these processes leave 
behind).
 
 Leaving evidence of activity: Using material items and physical spaces, 
moving objects around, leaving residues, repairing and remaking 
things — basically, leaving any marks or debris in an area where you 
performed some activity.
 
 Discarding things (deliberately or by accident): Making garbage 
dumps, dropping things, or storing items and forgetting about them.
 
 Reusing past things: Taking old pyramids apart to get blocks or bricks 
for new construction.
 
 Digging into or disturbing ground containing past things: Plowing up 
old sites and/or bulldozing them to construct new ones.
Natural processes
Mother Nature also contributes to the formation of archaeological sites. Here 
are some of the ways:
 
 Physical processes such as wind, gravity, rain, storms, drought, 
volcanoes, and other climate and local weather conditions.
 
 Biological processes such as animals burrowing into the site and 
bacteria and other organisms causing decay.
 
 Chemical processes such as weathering stone, rusting iron, and 
decomposing dead plants and animals in acidic soils.
All these processes affect the way the archaeological site is composed and 
looks. They can be large scale (volcanic ash covering the whole city of 
Pompeii) or very small scale (an iron artifact rusting beyond recognition). 
They can be destructive (wooden buildings decaying completely and leaving 
only dark stains where posts were in the ground), or they can actually 
preserve the site (the Pompeii ash). Sometimes they both preserve and 
destroy at the same time: Where I work in the southeastern U.S., I often see 
the effects of river floods washing away parts of prehistoric riverbank 
villages, but covering up other parts with several feet of new sand, and thus 
preserving them better (and making me have to dig deeper to find them).
You have to be sure to distinguish the effects of all these processes as you’re 
doing archaeology. It helps to know something about the physical sciences 
and be a good anthropologist who understands human behavior too. In fact, 
to be an archaeologist you often need to be a jill- or jack-of-all-trades! If you’re 
not already, a few seasons of fieldwork will help you see what soils indicate 
human use, what a decayed wooden post looks like in the ground, or how a 
big orange heavy thing may just be a rusted iron artifact.

 Chapter 1: What Archaeology Is
How Archaeology Became 
a Modern Science
Archaeology has had so many colorful figures and astounding discoveries 
that you really don’t need Hollywood to invent fictitious ones! Here I briefly 
review the history of archaeology, its finds and adventurers, and how the 
field developed into the sophisticated modern science it is today. Many 
famous, flamboyant, and fascinating personalities were pioneers in the 
development of archaeology (and models for characters like Indiana Jones). 
I’ve included some of my favorites. Most of them have biographies if you’re 
interested in reading more — you don’t need made-up Indiana Jones stuff to 
get armchair adventure!
Early diggers
Historical records say that a sixth-century B.C. Babylonian king and princess 
were the first to dig up remains of their own society’s glorious past, restore 
a by-then ancient Sumerian temple-pyramid, and display artifact finds in the 
palace. Later historians told tales and legends of the ancients, and people 
have probably always dug things up, especially to sell as souvenirs and 
treasures of the glorious past of someone somewhere.
But real archaeology is only traceable (so far) back to the Renaissance 
(14th through 17th centuries), when a passion for learning about the clas-
sical past developed. Wealthy folks traveled to ancient lands like Egypt and 
Mesopotamia and collected antiquities (old items, usually sculptures) dug out 
of ruins. Also, European antiquarians explored monuments (Roman build-
ings, Stonehenge, and so on) on their own lands. Antiquarian societies and 
collectors accumulated loads of items and began to establish museums to 
display them by the 18th century. Pompeii was accidentally discovered in the 
late 1500s, and digging was conducted in earnest as early as 1738.
 
Most of the knowledge of the past that people had until modern times came 
from historical writings or myth and legend until real science began to emerge 
in the Western world. The Bible told people what had happened in the past, 
and folktales supplied the rest. As early as the 1500s, northern Europeans who 
found Stone Age arrow points were calling them elf-shot or elf-arrows!

16
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
Nineteenth-century archaeology
By the early 1800s, naturalists and early scientists had accumulated a good 
body of artifacts and archaeological knowledge and were using it to interpret 
humanity’s past in an orderly fashion. With historical models, they charted 
the progress of human society through time.
Early classification
Two important Danish guys played a major role in early classification efforts. 
Christian Thomsen organized the finds at the national museum and wanted to 
exhibit stages of human achievement (and also apparently figure out how to 
divide the stuff up into display cases). He picked a three-age sequence: stone, 
bronze, and iron. Jens Worsaae excavated sites and found that stone tools 
were indeed deepest and therefore oldest; bronze tools were on top of them, 
and iron artifacts on top of the bronze. Later, the Stone Age was subdivided 
into Old (Paleolithic) and New Stone Age (Neolithic); the deepest-oldest idea 
became known as the law of superposition.
These cultural classifications became popular all over Europe, and the terms 
are still used today — with the following big differences, however:
 
 A single age can fall under different calendar years in different places.
 
 Human “progress” and “stages of development” are misnomers because 
a single universal path of cultural development doesn’t exist; different 
cultures change to become more or less complex through time in their 
own ways.
 
 Archaeologists recognize that these cultural classifications are biased 
and based purely on technology, as if that’s the only important aspect of 
human development (ignoring art, literature, architecture, math, religion, 
and so on). On the other hand, technology is easier to see in the 
archaeological record!
Explorers, adventurers, and looters
Many fascinating early archaeologists sought adventure and intrigue in 
searching out the remains and exquisite artifacts of the ancient past. They 
didn’t really “discover” various sites because local people always led them 
there. But the good archaeologists published the information and drawings and 
brought back antiquities for display. The more crass among them grabbed 
ancient treasures to sell for profit or display on their own estates. You’ve 
probably heard of some of these colorful people and their exploits:
 
 With Napoleon’s 1798 invasion of Egypt came scientists and artists to 
document the remnants of ancient civilization. One find was the Rosetta 
Stone, with a second-century B.C. text in Greek and two Egyptian 
languages. French scholar Champollion used it to decipher ancient 
Egyptian writing systems.

 Chapter 1: What Archaeology Is
 
 Giovanni Belzoni was a strong man in the circus before he became 
famous for his Egyptian tomb-robbing exploits from about 1817 to 1820. 
He blasted, dragged, and levered away monuments to capture giant 
statues, mummies, and other relics to display and garner fame.
 
 Travel writer John Lloyd Stephens and artist Frederick Catherwood studied 
and produced works on the wonderful pyramids and other monuments of 
the Maya civilization in Mexico and Central America in 1841 and 1843.
 
 Ephraim G. Squier and Edwin H. Davis surveyed burial mounds, 
earthworks, and temple platforms of the Mississippi and Ohio valleys 
(1848) and published their detailed descriptions for all to see.
 
 U.S. president Thomas Jefferson excavated a prehistoric Native 
American burial mound on his estate at Monticello, Virginia, with the 
intellectual goal of finding out scientific details (1788).
 
 Wealthy businessman Heinrich Schliemann thought Homer’s classical 
story of the Trojan War was really true and went to find and excavate 
Troy in northwestern Turkey (1871). Then he dug another site from 
Homer’s legends: Mycenae in southern Greece, which was possibly the 
citadel of King Agamemnon.
Late 19th and early 20th-century improvements
The goals of archaeological pursuits became more sophisticated and scientific 
by the late 19th century as investigators realized they needed systematic study 
to make sense of the wealth of finds. Here are some notable figures of this time 
in archaeology’s history when more careful digging developed:
 
 General Pitt Rivers excavated on his country estate in southern England 
in the 1880s, opening Bronze-Age burial mounds, an Iron-Age fort, and a 
Roman military camp. He meticulously measured, drew, and even 
photographed his work and finds, laying the foundations for the modern 
archaeological method.
 
 Sir Flinders Petrie accurately surveyed Egyptian pyramids and excavated 
tombs, mummies, and cemeteries with precision. He devised a method 
to discern cultural chronologies by examining changes in artifact styles 
through time.
 
 Sir Arthur Evans excavated (and partially restored) the palace ruins at 
Knossos, on the Greek island of Crete, beginning in 1900. His discoveries 
brought to light the Minoan civilization (3000 to 1200 B.C.) that predated 
the Mycenaean state made famous by Heinrich Schliemann (discussed in 
the preceding section).
 
 Cyrus Thomas, head of the Smithsonian Institution’s Division of Mound 
Exploration, collected information on thousands of mounds then being 
looted like crazy, especially in the U.S. Mississippi Valley. He had 
thought the mounds were built by a vanished people, but his findings 
changed his mind, and he reported in 1894 that the mounds were indeed 
made by ancestors of diverse Native American groups.

The early 20th century: Fabulous 
finds and academic advances
Sensational finds and colorful figures continued to make amazing discoveries 
in the early 20th century. Archaeologists did more orderly excavation, and 
synthesis of the results became more commonplace during that period.
Famous early figures
As you’ve probably realized, archaeology was a leisure-time pursuit for the 
wealthy, those with time to travel, and many British colonial-type holdovers 
investigating the pasts of various intriguing destinations during the early 
1900s. Here are a few of these characters:
 
 Howard Carter, who had worked with Flinders Petrie in Egypt (see the 
preceding section), was funded by the Earl of Carnarvon to explore the 
Valley of the Kings. He discovered the spectacular tomb of King Tut, a 
relatively unimportant pharaoh whose burial place is notable because it 
wasn’t looted like all the others, so it was full of glorious wealth.
 
 Sir Leonard Woolley dug in Syria in 1912, assisted by T.E. Lawrence 
(Lawrence of Arabia), with whom he also engaged in spy activities for 
the British government. After World War I, he excavated the famous 
Mesopotamian city of Ur in Iraq (see Chapter 14) and took 50 years to 
write a ten-volume report on all the everyday mud-brick houses and the 
royal graves full of gold, silver, and other riches.
 
 Gertrude Bell, an Arabic-speaking British travel writer and fascinating 
political figure in the Middle East, investigated Mesopotamian ruins 
and was also involved in British intelligence. She organized the Iraqi 
Department of Antiquities and Museum and was instrumental in the 
emergence of the modern country of Iraq.
 
 Gertrude Caton-Thompson worked in Egypt and then excavated at Great 
Zimbabwe in southern Africa in 1929. She said those ruins originated 
with indigenous African people, a view that the colonial government 
later outlawed until investigators eventually proved it to be true.
 
 Sir Mortimer Wheeler was a major British archaeologist by the 1920s. He 
followed and improved the exacting techniques pioneered by Pitt Rivers 
and dug sites of many kinds, from Roman towns to the famous Iron-Age 
hill fort Maiden Castle in southern England. Then he went to India and 
brought to light the ancient cities of the lost Indus Valley civilization in 
Pakistan. (See Chapter 14 for a discussion of these civilizations.) He was a 
dashing public figure and early television personality as well; many think 
he was one of the real-life models for Indiana Jones.

19
 Chapter 1: What Archaeology Is
Archaeology gets more academic
Scholars realized that their major goal should now be to organize some of 
the vast amounts of information that digs were providing. V. Gordon Childe, 
an Australian who delved into archaeology across Europe, produced the first 
major syntheses of prehistory. He talked about the processes of change in 
the deep human past that led to the Agricultural Revolution and the Urban 
Revolution — in other words, food production and later the emergence of 
early states. His many works include The Danube in Prehistory (1929), New 
Light on the Most Ancient East (1934), and one of my very favorite 
archaeological titles, Man Makes Himself (1939).
In the early 20th century lots of fossil finds that show that early humans first 
appeared in Africa came to light. Most of this study wasn’t archaeological 
but the subject of human paleontology or paleoanthropology. But the famous 
Louis Leakey did go to Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania to look for the earliest 
human evidence because he had seen crude-looking chipped stones there 
that he thought were early tools (and they were — see Chapter 12 for more).
During the Great Depression of the 1930s, U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt 
began programs to bring jobs to the country, including a great deal of 
archaeological work, especially in the poor region of the South. Hundreds of 
mounds and other sites were dug and thousands of bags of artifacts retrieved 
and piles of data accumulated. By then, academic institutions were beginning 
to train archaeologists who could supervise workers and then synthesize the 
findings for major regions. They used conveniently-named archaeological 
cultures (usually based on a pottery type or other characteristic artifact) 
and time periods (ditto) to organize the information and tell the story of 
the past, one time period after the next. This descriptive approach is called 
culture history (even when it concerns prehistory or the time before writing). 
Archaeologists still use this approach today, of course, but with much more 
than just simple description. I discuss it more in Chapter 11.
Early developments in explaining the past
Many 19th-century antiquarians studying relics 
of the past saw finds of stone tools with bones 
of extinct forms of animals, demonstrating the 
great antiquity of humans. They noticed that 
Native Americans were still making stone arrow 
points, easily comparable to chipped stone 
tools elsewhere in the world to see the work 
of the human hand. Geologist Sir Charles Lyell 
demonstrated the great age of the Earth and 
how its past processes were the same as the 
ones acting today (the principle of uniformitari-
anism). Charles Darwin used that knowledge to 
develop a systematic scientific theory of evolu-
tion, accounting for the development of all life 
forms (in his On the Origins of Species in 1859), 
later extending it to human development too.

20
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
New archaeology of the mid-20th century
After World War II, several intellectual currents came together to influence a 
mini-revolution in archaeology. The technologies developed in wartime 
combined with the growing desire to be more scientific. Some archaeologists 
were dissatisfied with simply describing what was found and where (producing 
culture history). They wanted to understand how past cultures functioned and 
answer questions about how human systems were organized. The movement 
they originated was called the New Archaeology. Here are some of its 
influences:
 
 New technologies like aerial photography and computers.
 
 Other scientific breakthroughs like radiocarbon dating.
 
 Growing concerns about civil rights, human rights, and the natural 
environment.
 
 Growing concerns about historic preservation and loss of archaeological 
sites to growth and development or new farming practices.
Late 20th-century archaeology
After New Archaeology had been around for a couple of decades, archaeolo-
gists decided they couldn’t call it new anymore and started using the term 
processual archaeology because the method explores cultural processes. 
Most archaeology done today is processual archaeology, as I discuss at 
greater length in Chapter 11.
Of course, every action has a reaction, and the response to scientific 
archaeology in the 1980s was that it was too ethnocentric or biased in favor 
of the dominant culture (which it is) and ignored the human story and 
meaning of the past. This response was a more humanistic archaeological 
approach (clumsily) called postprocessual archaeology; I describe it more in 
Chapter 11. Postprocessual archaeology contributes a lot to modern practice 
and is valuable for making you understand how you know what you know 
about the archaeological record.
Modern 21st-century archaeology 
Today you combine the description of culture history with the scientific 
approach and an awareness of biases you may have in your research. You 
must be acutely aware of the issues of heritage (whose ancestors are you 
digging up?), political uses of archaeology (to forward someone’s land claims, 
for example), and conservation of the resource (or historic preservation — 
saving sites and monuments from destruction).

21
 Chapter 1: What Archaeology Is
Many laws enacted in the late 20th century now protect archaeological 
remains all over the world’s lands and seas. They also generate more 
archaeological investigation in the path of construction and development. 
Many new techniques and precise methods may mean you spend more time 
filling out forms and other paperwork (or computer work) than digging. But 
it’s all worth it because you also have the glory of the discovery!
In the rest of Part I, you see how contemporary archaeology has become 
enormously professional, what it really studies, and all the many specialties that 
have blossomed. I also show you how archaeologists use scientific method to 
come to logical conclusions about the materials and data they discover.
Archaeology in the field
Fieldwork has always been the special tradition of archaeology, no matter 
what type you’re doing. You go out there and find the lost traces of past peoples 
(archaeological survey) and dig them up (excavation), and, yes, possibly 
encounter adventure along the way. But you’re also aware of far more ethical 
and safety considerations these days than were some of the historic figures I 
described earlier in this section, who barged into another country and hired 
local natives to dig huge trenches that sometimes collapsed on them!
Because you have so much more to think about and plan in doing modern 
archaeology, in Part II I describe all the steps in accomplishing fieldwork, 
from the research design and list of supplies and equipment to bring to the 
strategies for deciding where to dig and careful procedures for excavating in 
very small increments. I show you how to record everything you do and find 
so that you offset the destruction you cause by digging with the value of your 
new information about human behavior in the past.
Archaeology in the lab
The largest part of archaeological work is what you do after you excavate: 
process, analyze, and care for your finds and for all the information you’ve 
gleaned about the past. To get a handle on what is for some an overwhelming 
amount of labor and responsibility, Part III gives you a rundown of all the 
steps in laboratory work, from the time you bring in your bags of dirty 
artifacts to the preparation of your final report. I describe what a good 
archaeology lab should be and list many of the fancy ways you can analyze 
artifacts and draw out of them fascinating bits of information about their 
makers and users. You also see how to put all the bits together and use 
different theoretical orientations to tell the story of the past in different ways.

22
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
Archaeology’s human story
Combining the accumulated knowledge of centuries of investigation, 
archaeology gives you the story of the entire human past on this planet. In 
Part IV, I relate this story for you, showing how the material finds and 
exciting sites indicate what people have been doing over the last couple of 
million years (and sometimes why!). New digs and new scientific methods 
incorporated into archaeology have brought alive astounding details about 
our prehistoric ancestors who moved around the landscape hunting Ice-Age 
big game, settled down after the Ice Age to grow crops, and invented true 
civilization in many places a few thousand years ago. These big steps in the 
human career changed society enormously and had serious consequences 
for us today. Even in historic times, when you have written records of what 
people were doing and thinking, archaeology — the material remains — 
shows a lot of what you didn’t know before about your ancestors and 
yourself.
Archaeology in the public sphere
The greatest shift moving into the 21st century has been the awareness that 
all archaeology is public archaeology. The work is usually paid for by the 
public, and the findings are part of the whole human heritage. Archaeology 
has gone from being a fun hobby or rich man’s pursuit to being a scientific 
method for understanding human nature over the long term.
You can walk in the footsteps of the renowned and sometimes infamous 
characters who pioneered excavation methods and unearthed sensational 
finds. But today you also realize that archaeological findings really matter. 
Not only are they important in the (smaller) world of professional 
archaeology and interpretation of human systems and activities, but they 
also have meaning in the wider world of humanity at large.
In order to show you archaeology’s importance to the general public and 
why you care about it, Part V explains all the political and social connections 
of archaeology today, including relating past people to living descendants 
and preserving archaeological sites and antiquities from looting so that 
they’re there for everyone. I note some of the latest controversies in the field 
and how you can have competing interpretations but also practical uses of 
the past. I also list many ways you yourself can participate in archaeology 
and get you ready for the experience. This book has thick layers rich with 
information, so dig in!

What Archaeology Isn’t and Why 
That’s Important
In This Chapter
 Realizing that archaeology doesn’t deal with dinosaurs
 Debunking popular stereotypes of archaeologists and early people
 Understanding the threat of looting
W
hat’s the difference between what archaeology really is and how the 
popular media portray it? Thanks to Hollywood, the stereotype of 
the archaeologist has been either a bearded old absent-minded professor or 
a dashing younger guy with a whip and gun. Okay, now they’ve added a sexy 
gal with a weapon — I’m not sure that’s progress. No other science or social 
science is so misunderstood!
I devote this chapter to explaining some misconceptions about archaeology 
for several reasons. One is that I want you to understand clearly the 
difference between what’s archaeology and what’s often something much 
more disreputable. Another reason is that some of the misconceptions are 
harmful and can lead to destruction of the archaeological record that 
represents much of our human heritage.
Dinosaurs, Fossils, and Rocks: Not 
What Archaeology Is About
You may think anything you dig up or anything that’s really old is the subject 
of archaeology. Not so. Archaeology is about people! Yes, that sounds like 
an old line from a bad movie, but if it helps you remember, all the better. 
Archaeology studies human behavior from the material evidence people have 
left behind. So the subject of archaeological study can only be a few million 
years old.

24
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
Some fossils but no dinos
Paleontology is the study of dinosaurs and any other fossils left from earlier 
life forms on the planet. Fossilized bone usually turns to stone or is otherwise 
preserved. You can have other fossils besides bones, such as coprolites 
(preserved feces), eggs, animal footprints, and so on.
 
But archaeologists never study fossils that aren’t associated with human 
activity. A couple of examples include
 
 Bones of animals that may have been species hunted or scavenged by really 
ancient humans (or at least living at the same time as those early humans).
 
 Fossil bones that were lying around and found by humans living long after 
the animal was gone, even extinct. Humans even made artifacts from 
fossils, such as petrified wood and coral chipped into nice stone tools.
 
Dinosaurs all died out some 65 million years ago. They were absolutely not 
around when the earliest humans appeared some 4 million years ago, Fred 
Flintstone notwithstanding!
Understanding how rock 
studies aid archaeology
Archaeology has ties to other scientific fields that involve the earth itself:
 
 Geology is the study of the earth and its materials and processes, 
including rocks, soil, and all other inorganic (non-living) components. 
Archaeologists may sometimes learn or make use of geological knowledge 
for many reasons. For example, many types of siliceous rocks (containing 
silica) have properties that allow them to be chipped and flaked into 
sharp points and edges. This characteristic was enormously useful to 
humanity for over 2 million years, until people learned how to make 
other sharp cutting tools of metal. So archaeologists study different 
rocks used for making stone tools, building monuments, and all kinds 
of other human uses.
 
 Geography is the study of the earth’s natural and human features, and 
includes making lots of maps. So archaeologists need to know lots of 
geography to understand past human systems working within natural 
systems.
 
 Geomorphology is the study of landforms and how they originate and are 
shaped and changed through time; it’s an area of geology and geography 
that archaeologists find extremely useful. Mountains rising, earth segments 
moving, rivers flooding and changing paths, and coastlines eroding or 
building up all affect human settlement and activity.

25
 Chapter 2: What Archaeology Isn’t and Why That’s Important
Hollywood Stereotypes: Time 
for a Dose of Reality
Popular portrayals of archaeology are fun. They include romance and 
adventure, gold, pyramids, lost arks, crystal skulls, and other (supposedly) 
valuable artifacts. But seldom do they show how archaeologists use the 
material remains to find out what past human societies did and why they 
flourished or died out. In addition, media creations of prehistoric human 
life seldom draw on archaeological research to portray things accurately. 
So you have to be careful what you believe!
The real archaeologists versus 
the movie heroes
Indiana Jones faces intrigue and international spies, but you never see him 
excavating slowly and carefully. Lara Croft wears short-shorts and a gun, both 
highly impractical during fieldwork. (Why is she never bitten by a mosquito or 
spider on those bare legs?) And none of these glamorous characters sits in the 
lab for months after the excavation painstakingly sorting the pieces of artifacts 
and annotating the site map to put together the picture of the past people 
whose remains were just excavated.
The activities of tomb raiding and treasure hunting — desecrating graves 
that may be someone’s sacred ancestors or grabbing gold from underground 
or underwater to get rich — are not what modern archaeologists do. Nor do 
they wear funny hats (well, not that often), carry whips or pistols, or fight 
off Nazis or international smugglers (except in very rare cases!) The notion 
that all archaeology is adventurous is a little off-base when you consider how 
much paperwork (or computer work) and tedious laboratory processing it 
involves. But yes, you do get the lure of the unknown; you never know what 
the excavation will uncover, even if it’s a 1950 cola bottle.
Some archaeologists study how popular culture portrays the profession. 
Books and Web sites point out the mistakes amid all the fun in the movies 
and even archaeology-related toys. Lost prophesies, extraterrestrials, and 
even more mundane things like artifacts inappropriate for the time period are 
common; many are featured on a “bad archaeology” Web site (www.badar
chaeology.net). In 2008, an Archaeology magazine article described real 
scientific research on the several actual crystal skulls known — they’re all 
demonstrated to be fakes from Mexico.

26
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
The stereotyped archaeologist is a charismatic, eccentric scholar (sometimes 
true) with esoteric knowledge about unusual topics like prehistoric stone 
hide-scrapers or marble jars (always true) and little awareness of the real 
world (seldom true, I hope). Movie archaeology always occurs in exotic places, 
even though many real-life archaeologists do archaeology in their hometowns 
or backyards!
Real past people versus movie 
savages with dinosaurs
Past peoples, especially in prehistoric cultures known only through 
archaeology, are often shown inaccurately in popular media. The worst 
offenders are shows like The Flintstones and movies such as One Million 
Years B.C. that show people with dinosaurs.
Possibly even more unfortunate are portrayals of prehistoric people as 
stupid, savage, or stupid savages. A good archaeologist never uses the term 
primitive to describe a culture or society. This description is ethnocentric — 
judging another culture based on the standards of your own. Perhaps early 
people used less complex technologies like stone tools or had simpler social 
organization (no kings or presidents — or maybe no real leaders at all), but 
that doesn’t mean they were dumb. People may have been even smarter in 
the time before writing — they had to keep all their accumulated knowledge 
in their heads and pass it down to succeeding generations carefully.
Similarly, depictions of ancient civilizations are rife with mistaken imagery 
that often makes the people in them act just like modern businessmen or 
frustrated housewives, except that they’re in Egypt building pyramids or 
in Rome being gladiators. And they’re always so clean, which is interesting 
because indoor plumbing is really a pretty new development in civilization.
Treasure Hunting and Looting: 
Not the Goals of Archaeology
Another inaccurate view of archaeology is that it’s all about finding artifacts. 
In reality, you find out about past people through artifacts, which is very 
different. An artifact with no information on its original archaeological 
context, even displayed as an art object, is scientifically worthless.

27
 Chapter 2: What Archaeology Isn’t and Why That’s Important
 
People digging only for artifacts are called looters. Ethical collectors, who 
obtain artifacts for fun and keep good records on them, may be helpful to 
archaeologists. But looters, unethical collectors (sometimes called pothunters), 
destroy the integrity and scientific value of archaeological sites in their quest 
for personal profit. Some unprofessional individuals claim they sell artifacts 
to finance the dig. Real archaeologists consider it unethical to buy and sell 
irreplaceable artifacts unearthed from archaeological sites. Instead, they only 
study and conserve them for the public good. Unfortunately, looting has 
happened since the beginning of human culture — some call it the world’s 
second- or third-oldest profession.
 
Archaeology is not grave-robbing or tomb-raiding, which are either illegal or 
unethical (and sometimes both). Archaeologists excavate a grave only with 
the permission of the state and the descendants of the dead (if they can be 
found) or to investigate whose grave it is, especially for modern crime scenes.
Early archaeology and looting: 
The Elgin marbles
In 1801, Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire (which 
controlled Greece at the time) got permission to remove the 2,500-year-old 
marble sculptures from the famous Parthenon in Athens. The gorgeous 
statues and friezes from this famous temple showed scenes from classical 
myths and stories; Elgin shipped them to England, which eventually bought 
them to display in the British Museum where they still are today (see 
Figure 2-1).
Even in his own time, Elgin was criticized for stealing the heritage of the 
Greek people. But Elgin was very interested in archaeology and the past, and 
this action was how he showed it; in fact, his actions are typical of the view of 
archaeology at the time. (See my brief history of the field in Chapter 1.) The 
idea was to claim for the Western, scientific, supposedly superior world the 
great monuments of the past from places now fallen from ancient glory.
Today the debate rages over whether England should keep the Elgin 
marbles or give them back to Greece, their rightful owner. The argument 
centers on who can take care of them better, given rough treatment over 
the decades by the British but decay and neglect of monuments in Greece. 
Nationalism and issues of deep heritage and tradition, as well as modern 
politics, all come into play. This kind of debate is part of the history of 
archaeology. Many individuals grabbed treasures from ancient Egypt or 
Mesopotamia or Peru or elsewhere, claiming to want to study them and 
care for them. Now archaeologists know better and respect the heritage of 
the peoples whose ancestors they’re digging up!

Give a hoot: Don’t loot (or 
trade in antiquities)
Many laws protect ancient monuments in all countries today (and see my 
discussion in Chapter 16). But people still steal antiquities (artifacts from 
ancient civilizations or prehistoric cultures) and sell them to arts dealers or 
auction houses, or directly to wealthy collectors. Business writers advise 
investing in antiquities, even though it’s often illegal and always unethical.
Smuggling antiquities never commands the police or customs attention that 
drug smuggling or other illegal international activity does, which is too bad; 
dangerous drugs can hurt and kill many people, but stealing the past of a 
nation damages the heritage of everyone! Extremist groups in Iraq are even 
financing their terrorist tactics by smuggling ancient Mesopotamian artifacts 
out of the country and destroying their own rich archaeological past.
Education is of course the solution; people need to realize that what they’re 
doing is damaging someone’s ancestry. But it’s hard to get across to many 
people how taking arrowheads from a public park is a crime (even though 
it is). You can point out that if everybody did it, all the arrowheads would 
be gone and unavailable for scientific study. Worse than taking the artifacts 
themselves are the damage and destruction that looting causes to the rest of 
the site. Tunneling into the mound, pyramid, or shipwreck to get the gold or 
whole pots to sell damages all the other evidence.

29
 Chapter 2: What Archaeology Isn’t and Why That’s Important
Another way to look at it is to imagine that you’re at a flea market and you see 
pages of an ancient diary being sold off, one by one, to different customers 
who think they’re cute and quaint. You suddenly realize the diary was written 
by your grandparent and must have been stolen from your attic. Each page is 
going somewhere different, so you’ll never be able to put the whole thing back 
together again.
Or think of another situation in which some country sends astronauts to the 
other side of the moon. They study everything but don’t share their findings 
with anyone else. To make things worse, they blow up the whole place they 
studied and make it impossible for anyone else to investigate it.
 
After reading this book, I hope you understand why looting of artifacts and 
sites is unethical, destructive, and just plain wrong. Instead, I hope you want 
to work hard to save the past for the future.
Archaeologists Aren’t Always Digging
The same reasons that archaeologists discourage looting propel their 
interest in not digging. They’ve already excavated enough still-unstudied 
material to fuel archaeological investigation into the next century. Plus, 
archaeologists have an ethical obligation to report on what’s been dug 
prior to digging any more. Furthermore, they’re developing so many new 
scientific techniques that today’s excavation and analysis standards may 
seem crude and ignorant compared to what may be possible in the future. 
(Yes, I’m waiting for that Star Trek tricorder that I can point at the site to 
tell me what’s underground, and at the artifact to tell me its composition, 
date, and the name of the person who made it!)
So you may not want to dig but to study what’s been stuck on a dusty lab 
shelf since someone dug it up. You may prefer to discourage digging because, 
after all, you destroy when you dig.
 
Lab work doesn’t mean you don’t have exciting moments. You can make 
discoveries that are just as thrilling as fieldwork when you open a bag that’s 
spent decades in storage and see what materials it contains. I’ve had this 
experience, crawling up on high shelves in federal storage facilities to open 
paper bags containing finds from digs in the 1950s, so trust me, it happens.

Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
Archaeology Isn’t Necessarily 
Exotic; It’s Real Work
The romantic, exotic locales often portrayed for archaeology are usually 
quite rare. Most archaeology occurs in mundane settings: in the woods, on 
the prairie, downtown amid sidewalks and buildings, or in some farmer’s 
field. You still make exciting discoveries, of course, and you never know what 
you may uncover. But it’s usually not gold or treasure!
You may think archaeology is pretty easy — just get a shovel and maybe a 
metal detector and start digging. But it’s really a difficult and precise science. 
Doing it incorrectly may mess up exactly what you’re trying to find. You can’t 
assume that anyone who can hold a shovel or trowel can excavate properly. 
That’s like thinking anyone with a scalpel and some sutures can remove your 
appendix. Archaeology is very picky, enormously tedious work that requires 
expert technique to prevent damaging the evidence. Archaeology is the 
only science that destroys its subject matter while it investigates it. For this 
reason, it requires a great deal of skill, enormous amounts of record-keeping, 
and endless patience.
 
So you need skills, courage, wisdom, and thorough scientific training to do 
archaeology, not just the enthusiasm for adventure, discovery, and learning of 
past people. Hidden dangers in archaeology can be physically real — such as 
that snake that slithered into your excavation trench — or intellectually 
insidious — such as thinking native peoples were too stupid to know how to 
build pyramids and therefore ancient astronauts from another planet must 
have arrived to show them how!
Archaeology is about people
You can do archaeology anywhere that people have been or have left their 
stuff. A lot of today’s archaeology concerns the recent historic past — sites 
that may at first glance look rather dull, such as early 20th-century houses 
or stores, railroad lines, or factories. People live in all kinds of locales, which 
usually aren’t flashy swamps or deserts. These less-exotic sites are often 
poorly documented in the historic record because they were used or lived in 
by people whose everyday lives were never written about — working class 
folks, minorities, women, and children. With archaeology, you can give some 
history to those who have little.

31
 Chapter 2: What Archaeology Isn’t and Why That’s Important
Any archaeological study is going to tell you about human nature and what 
people went through in the past to get along. Excavating prehistoric foraging 
peoples’ camps or early farming sites can bring alive the struggles as well as 
the successes (and failures) of past human adaptations. You may even 
identify with the same problems they faced: getting food, shelter — all the 
things you also need. After all, archaeology is about people, and you’re 
people, too.
A case study: Archaeology 
of modern garbage
A famous and much-lauded archaeological project demonstrated how much 
you can discover about modern society from using archaeological meth-
ods to study garbage. It started as an assignment by University of Arizona 
Professor Bill Rathje to his class to study the material remains — trash — 
from contemporary urban neighborhoods.
Students combined careful examination of all the contents of this waste with 
questionnaires filled out (anonymously) by the people living in neighborhoods 
of the city of Tucson. The findings were astounding; they demonstrated that 
people
 
 Threw out a huge amount of usable food — 10 percent to 15 percent of 
all the garbage was food. Middle-income households wasted more than 
poor or rich ones.
 
 Said they drank 40 to 60 percent less alcohol than they really did.
 
 Drank more expensive liquor in the richest and poorest neighborhoods 
(with middle-class folks drinking the cheapest booze).
After this pioneering work in the 1970s, the Garbage Project, also known as Le 
Projet du Garbage or garbology studies, expanded to include excavations in 
landfills. I was privileged to help Rathje conduct one of the landfill excavations, 
in which a giant machine bored a hole into the huge pile of garbage and picked 
up chunks of it in ten-foot intervals. We bagged and labeled the chunks and 
took them back to the archaeology lab to sort by raw material (paper, plastic, 
metal, and so on) in proper archaeological fashion. The only differences from a 
traditional excavation were that the artifacts were a bit more modern, and they 
(and thus my crew and I) smelled really bad!

32
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
Tabulating and analyzing the materials from landfills has produced extremely 
valuable data on consumer choice, waste management, and recycling. 
Unexpected findings from landfill excavations included the following:
 
 Most of the stuff doesn’t biodegrade; thousands of newspapers from as 
long ago as the 1950s were excavated and found to be perfectly readable 
(albeit smelly).
 
 Though you’d think plastics make up the largest component of landfills, 
they don’t. That distinction goes to paper, which makes up between 40 
and 50 percent of the landfill junk.
 
 Construction debris accounts for 20 to 30 percent of the material in 
landfills.
 
 Landfills often have nice annual layers marked by yellow lines — caused 
by annual discard of telephone books!
The garbage studies are one of the best examples of how archaeology can 
have real-life practical value for modern society and give you information you 
just can’t get from history, economics, or any other investigation. This study 
also shows you what archaeologists really do — not go after treasure in the 
conventional sense, but seek out the priceless knowledge of human behavior.

M
y office phone often rings with a caller asking something like “I found 
a fossil bone — can you tell me if it’s from a dinosaur?” I have to 
explain that archaeology studies things left by people, so fossils of extinct 
animals can be identified by paleontologists in the biology department.
As I’m constantly informing my callers, archaeology is the anthropology of 
past people. You can specialize in a geographic region, a particular kind of 
research question, or even a technical method in archaeology. You can even 
specialize in a type of philosophical perspective and write a lot but maybe 
not even dig any more. You probably never realized that archaeologists do so 
many different kinds of things, so in this chapter I give you an overview of the 
many varieties of archaeology you can pursue.
Archaeology as Anthropology
In the Americas and many other places, archaeology is part of anthropology 
(like pediatrics is a specialty within medicine). Anthropology studies humanity 
from both biological and cultural perspectives. Its four fields are these:
 
 Cultural and social anthropology studies living cultures, whether like 
Margaret Mead in the far-off exotic Pacific islands or in the different 
ethnic neighborhoods of a modern city.

34
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
 
 Biological (or physical) anthropology studies how humans evolved 
over millions of years and the genetic and other physical variations 
among humans today.
 
 Linguistic anthropology studies how languages evolve and interact with 
culture.
 
 Archaeology is the cultural anthropology of the past. It’s the only 
branch of anthropology where you don’t need the actual people — just 
the stuff they left behind. And the method is different: You use the 
material remains to figure out past behavior, not the living people’s 
actions.
 
 Applied anthropology is sometimes called a fifth specialization. It 
means taking the methods and findings of anthropology to be of some 
use in the modern world. Because most archaeology these days is in 
some way public (discussed more in Chapter 16), archaeology is applied 
anthropology.
In some other countries archaeology resides in classics or natural science 
divisions of universities (sometimes in departments of art history or Oriental 
or Middle East studies), or in separate archaeology departments apart from 
other social sciences. But modern archaeologists everywhere are asking 
social and cultural questions (not just digging up pretty objects for 
museums), so perhaps this separation is a little extreme.
The Scientific and the Humanistic 
in Archaeology
Science is one method of knowing things, based on testing hypotheses and 
acquiring knowledge systematically. Archaeology is a social science and a 
special method of studying about people from their material remains. It can 
be part of the humanities too.
 
Most archaeologists use scientific method, coming up with hypothetical 
explanations based on what they find and then testing those ideas with the next 
dig, using empirical (observable) evidence. Humanistic study emphasizes more 
how humans feel, think, and value things in life — what artifacts meant to them.
You can study architectural ideals, artistic values, or spiritual beliefs of past 
people scientifically. You can also speculate about them in a humanistic way, 
relating to past people as a fellow human. (What did they believe that led 
them to make such glorious tombs or sacrifice so many servants at the 
ruler’s funeral? What did those servants think at the time?) Humanistic 

35
 Chapter 3: So You Want to Do Archaeology? What Kind? 
models of past human societies aren’t usually scientifically testable, but they 
use imagination and expand your ways of viewing the past. They work best 
with historic archaeology (discussed later in this chapter), when you already 
have some idea of what those past people thought because it was written 
down somewhere!
Most archaeologists today combine scientific and humanistic approaches, 
depending upon their theoretical and philosophical views (and often on the 
sizes of their budgets and who funded the dig).
Different Fields for a Plethora 
of Purposes and Places
You may fall in love with the archaeology of a particular place and all its 
unsolved mysteries. Or maybe a specific time period or one kind of artifact 
fascinates you. Whatever the case, the following sections give you an idea of 
the many different archaeological paths you can take.
Regional specialties: Digging in one place
Many archaeologists begin work in one area of the world and stay there year 
after year uncovering more ancient secrets. You may fall under the spell of 
Egypt or Mesoamerica (Mexico and Central America) and all their pyramids. 
But you can get involved in the archaeology of Arkansas and find it equally 
compelling. Egyptian archaeology is so famous that it has its own specific 
word (Egyptology), but we don’t yet have a term like Arkansasology.
Much of my own work is tied to a geographical region, one Florida valley 
where I’ve been digging for years. As I get deeper (pun intended!) into its 
past, I target specific gaps in information and try to fill them (the earliest 
people here? Earliest agriculture? Reasons for building mounds? Results of 
the 16th-century European intrusion? A vanished 19th-century town? The real 
story of African-American turpentine workers in the backwoods?)
 
Every place humans have ever been has archaeology that someone can 
specialize in (even the moon!).

36
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
Temporal specialties: Digging 
within one time period
You may prefer the archaeology of one time period and become expert in 
recognizing the typical artifacts and filling in the picture of how people lived 
right then.
What’s special about anthropology?
Just as every pediatrician or heart surgeon 
is a practitioner of medicine, archaeologists 
generally do anthropology. Unlike other social 
sciences, anthropology emphasizes these 
things:
  Culture: Shared human knowledge, 
beliefs, symbols, behaviors, customs, 
social organization — all the things that 
depend upon learning and transmitting 
knowledge (as opposed to relying on 
animal instinct).
  Cultures: Ethnic groups or other individual 
populations recognized by some shared 
ways of life. For example, Western culture 
is the Euro-American world with its Judeo-
Christian, capitalist foundations. Now 
Western culture is spreading widely over 
the globe as tribal peoples or countries 
become Westernized. Anthropologists 
often study original or indigenous cultures 
before, while, and/or after they become 
Westernized.
  Archaeological cultures: The material 
record of specific past cultures. Most 
often, an archaeological culture consists 
of assemblages of particular artifacts 
and other material patterns because you 
can’t always determine ethnicity from the 
artifacts. (For example, right now you’re 
probably wearing clothes, a watch, or a 
cellphone made in another country.)
  Cultural relativism: Judging all cultures 
by their own standards, as opposed to 
ethnocentrism, or judging other cultures 
by your own values (like Romans calling 
all those other folks barbarians).
  A holistic perspective: Seeing humans as 
both biological and cultural beings at the 
same time.
  Cross-cultural comparison: Seeing how the 
same things are or aren’t done in different 
cultures through space and time.
  Fieldwork: Going out to make your own 
observations, not just sending out a 
questionnaire, using census data, or 
reading what someone else said.
  Understanding “the Other”: Learning 
about whatever group isn’t yours, based 
on ethnicity, gender, or any other criteria 
established for the particular study being 
done. Some anthropologists are of course 
part of the group they study, but they want 
to be able to interpret that group to everyone. 
If you’re a middle-class citizen, learning how 
homeless, impoverished people think is 
understanding “the Other.”

37
 Chapter 3: So You Want to Do Archaeology? What Kind? 
For example, Paleolithic archaeologists really need to know about stone tools — 
how they were made, broken, and used and how the stone was obtained — 
because stone is mostly what they have to work with. From such a remote 
time in the human past (up to 1 or 2 million years ago), usually stone is all 
that’s preserved. Many Paleolithic archaeologists learn how to chip stone tools 
themselves. They may look at the Paleolithic artifacts, house patterns, or other 
aspects at many different places in the world.
If you do Pre-Columbian archaeology, you specialize in North and South 
America (the New World) before Columbus arrived and Old World invaders 
and colonists changed everything.
You may specialize in 19th-century archaeology, and all its particular kinds 
of artifacts. You’d know china patterns, metal items such as gun parts, brick 
types, architectural designs — everything identified with that century.
Expertise in specific artifacts or site types
You may have a fascination for something specific in the archaeological 
record. Here are some examples of artifact expertise:
 
 Many lithic (Greek for “stone”) experts live and breathe stone tools. You 
can study the tools all over the world and through time, and even learn 
to manufacture them (through flintknapping, or flaking stone).
 
 Some archaeologists love pottery, with all its great variation. Here you 
can make your own pots to compare with the prehistoric ceramics, 
measure dimensions of vessels, or study all the designs and the temper 
(crushed rock or other material) mixed with the clay. For 20 years, one 
expert has studied the beautiful, enigmatic patterns stamped onto pots 
in the U.S. Southeast 1,500 years ago. Another specialist developed a 
method to show a rollout of the painted pictures going around Maya 
vases as one continuous rectangular photograph.
 
 Perishable remains are rarely preserved, but you can still study them. 
An archaeologist digging a dry rock shelter in Pennsylvania found 
fragments of plaited baskets up to 9,000 years old. He became an expert 
on this ancient technology and studied it worldwide, from preserved 
fragments to basketry imprints on fired clay pots.
 
 Experts in cordage (string or yarn) and weaving study not only preserved 
fiber fragments but also the imprints of cords or fabrics on clay.
 
 Any other technology you can imagine — from historic industrial bridge 
or watercraft design to prehistoric beadmaking — has its archaeological 
specialists.

38
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
You may become fascinated by a particular type of site to specialize in. Some 
examples include the following:
 
 A Paleo-Indian (ancient Native American) bison kill site on the American 
Plains requires expertise in 7,000- to 12,000-year-old stone tools, bison 
and other animal skeletons, digging in a particular kind of soil, and so 
on. For a Paleo-Indian site in Florida you need the same knowledge, and 
also you need to know how to dive because the best sites are underwater.
 
 Quarry sites where past people went to get stone are favorites for lithic 
specialists. Here you can find chipped pieces, from chunks to discarded 
broken tools, but not necessarily the garbage from people having lived 
there. Historic quarries for building stone are also fun to study; you can see 
how those people actually carved out huge blocks and transported them.
 
 Cave and rock shelter (shallow cave) sites require not only expertise in 
typical types of cultural and natural deposits but also a decided lack 
of claustrophobia! They may be uncomfortable if you have to squat on 
planks (see Figure 3-1) to dig so as not to walk on the floor and mess it 
up while you brush rocks and artifacts and do paperwork.
 
 Rock art sites have painted and/or engraved designs and pictures; 
they’re found worldwide and may be tens of thousands of years old. 
To study them you need expertise in pigments and rock types and 
sometimes even climbing cliffs!

a French 
Paleolithic 
rock shelter.
 

39
 Chapter 3: So You Want to Do Archaeology? What Kind? 
 
 Spectacular architecture — mounds, pyramids, planned cities, and 
monuments — has lured archaeologists for centuries. To study these 
features, you need knowledge of construction engineering, architecture, 
and maybe even astronomy if your buildings are aligned with the sun at 
the summer solstice.
 
 Various kinds of industrial sites, like mills, waterworks, and irrigation 
systems also draw plenty of archaeological attention. Whether in 
prehistoric or historic times, you want to know how the people built 
these structures and why, how they succeeded or failed, and even what 
the lives of the workers there were like.
Archaeological Specialties by Setting, 
Goals, and Techniques
The varieties of archaeology depend upon what you’re looking for, why 
you’re looking, and what you’re finding. Many of these varieties overlap; with 
archaeology, you’re always doing several different things at once!
Prehistoric and historic archaeology
You find quite a big difference between researching the prehistoric human 
past, where everything known is from archaeological discovery, and the 
historic past, where someone wrote down information you can also use to 
interpret the finds.
Prehistoric archaeology
 
Everything that happened before writing was invented is called prehistory. 
That’s hundreds of millions of years of life on earth (including dinosaurs). 
But human prehistory goes back only a couple million years (NOT including 
dinosaurs). This period is what archaeologists study (described more in 
Chapters 12 through 14).
 
Almost everything people have ever done has been during prehistoric time. 
Inventing artifacts, inventing culture in the first place, organizing societies, 
developing belief systems — anything you can think of about how people live, 
think, and behave, was already done for 2 million years before the invention of 
writing. Only in recent time did people start writing down descriptions of how 
they did it.

40
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
As a prehistorian, you reconstruct that deep human past based on what you 
find, with only loose comparisons to known cultures. You need knowledge 
of historic cultures that are descended from or close to your prehistoric 
people. (See Chapter 11 for a discussion of how archaeologists use analogy 
with known cultures). Folk tales and native traditional stories usually go back 
centuries or more. They reflect common knowledge passed on through 
generations. (Now you don’t sit around the fire with the grandparents and 
learn everything any more; you read books — like this one! — or look it up on 
the Internet.)
Historic archaeology
The earliest writing is only about 3,000 to 5,000 years old, and you can’t 
always read or even recognize it. (See discussions in Chapter 14). Writing 
usually came along with other complex systems of the first ancient states. 
Historic archaeologists can specialize in any literate culture: early Chinese, 
Greek, or Roman civilization, medieval or colonial peoples, even early 
20th-century towns.
 
After you have written records, you have more information about what you’re 
digging up. But historic archaeology has its peculiarities and problems too. 
Here are some of them:
 
 History began in different times at different places. So North America 
(north of Mexico) had no written record until Europeans “discovered” 
the place and started writing about the people they saw there in the 
1500s.
 
 Only a very few people of a certain kind write history: those who can 
write (and get published). So written records reflect any biases and 
ethnocentrism they may have.
 
 Different cultures invented writing for different reasons. In ancient 
Mesopotamia, it was for keeping economic records. Indus valley civilization 
(in Pakistan) and Etruscan (ancient Tuscany, Italy) writing haven’t really 
been deciphered yet but seem to record religious things. Mayan glyphs 
(Yucatan, Mexico) recorded sacred, political, and military history — in 
other words, who conquered whom.
 
 Usually, history is written by the winners. This means conquerors wrote 
little about the people they conquered, and what they did write was 
probably from a biased point of view. Indigenous cultures known from a 
few descriptions by outsiders are often called “people without history.”
So an archaeologist can be hindered as well as helped by history. You may 
find documents from the earliest explorers who met the native people whose 
village you’re excavating. But those explorers didn’t describe all the natives’ 
artifacts or how the people disposed of garbage or built houses — the evidence 
you’re finding in the ground.

41
 Chapter 3: So You Want to Do Archaeology? What Kind? 
In later times too, historical records seldom record everyday behavior (how 
people slept, bathed, even went to the bathroom). Yet all this behavior can 
be in the archaeological record.
Underwater archaeology: 
Difficult and expensive
 
Archaeology is hard work — even harder in a place where you can’t stand up 
normally or breathe. Digging underwater is perhaps 100 times more expensive 
than digging on land, and it takes longer, too — you can only breathe with 
your gear for so long down there. Plus, you have to contend with water 
pressure, sharks, tides and currents, lousy visibility, and many other hazards.
Also, it’s usually a logistical nightmare — you have to get the boats, breathing 
apparatus, and all the equipment for regular diving. Then you also need a whole 
different set of digging and recording technology (discussed more in Chapter 7).
You may see more divers visiting (and looting!) archaeological sites than 
archaeologists who know how to dive. So archaeology will always welcome 
professional, ethical underwater archaeologists who aren’t after treasure 
they can sell.
Here are some examples of the great variety of underwater sites and specialties:
 
 Nautical archaeology studies ship-building and watercraft in particular. 
Shipwrecks are everywhere — in mid-ocean, in ports, in rivers, and in 
lake bottoms. They’re capsules of particular kinds of human behavior 
(often within larger economic and mercantile systems) at a specific time. 
They can be merely sunken, or storm-tossed across a wide area. In some 
port areas wrecks lie on top of other wrecks!
 
 Maritime (or marine) archaeology includes shipwrecks and everything 
around ports and particular seafaring cultures (including some terrestrial 
archaeology, too).
 
 Prehistoric or historic underwater archaeology investigates sites 
often now submerged because of rising sea levels since the end of the 
Pleistocene (Ice Age). Sea level is hundreds of feet higher than it was 
10,000 years ago, so many settlements are waiting to be discovered! You 
can find ancient Paleolithic campsites near drowned freshwater springs, 
or whole villages abandoned when the water rose. Other changes in 
landscapes — storms, tidal waves, and other forces — can drown parts 
of port cities or other coastal sites.

Classical archaeology: All those statues!
Ancient classical civilizations — Greece, Rome, and related areas — are the 
foundations of Western culture. Classical archaeologists study the art, 
architecture, and written documents of these societies passed down through 
the ages. So classical archaeology is a type of historical archaeology.
 
The classics are still so important in our consciousness that this archaeology 
is sometimes considered a separate discipline. For example, Florence, Italy, 
has an archaeology museum with all the classical materials and a few Bronze 
Age predecessors (pottery and other artifacts). A separate prehistory museum 
across town has everything from the earliest tools of the Paleolithic through 
the Bronze Age.
Some classical archaeologists work more in the tradition of art history or 
languages, exploring styles of vase painting, sculpture, or ancient texts. 
Some university classics departments are separate from anthropological 
archaeology. But many classicists are tending lately toward anthropological 
explanations — what did those ancient artworks show about the societies 
that made them?
One thing you can know for sure: All those classical statues that seem so 
pure in their white marble appearance were really painted bright, even garish 
colors (some even have traces of paint remaining). So our classical ideals 
may be more manufactured than real.
Heinrich Schliemann and the Classics
The Trojan War (between Troy and Greece) 
took place in about the 12th century B.C., 
and its story was already centuries old when 
ancient Greek historian Homer wrote it down 
in his epic poem The Iliad in about the seventh 
century B.C. Wealthy German businessman 
Heinrich Schliemann thought the story must be 
more than just legend and went to search for 
Troy. He found and excavated the site in north-
west Turkey in 1870. It had so many occupation 
layers that scholars still argue which one was 
the original Troy of the legend. Schliemann 
didn’t find the famous Trojan horse, but he 
did blaze a trail for classical archaeology, 
comparing historic documentation with the 
archaeological record.

43
 Chapter 3: So You Want to Do Archaeology? What Kind? 
Forensic archaeology
The popularity of crime-scene shows has brought forensic studies to the 
public consciousness. Forensic means relating to the legal system and to 
public debate in court — in other words, evidence! Forensic archaeology is 
the use of archaeological survey techniques to locate hidden crime scenes 
(like buried bodies) and excavation techniques for precisely recording finds.
Crime scene investigations
Forensic sciences identify material items and human remains involved in 
law enforcement cases. Forensic biological anthropology deals with 
skeletons or human tissue. The archaeological techniques involved in this 
sort of investigation provide accurate, clear evidence in legal cases. It’s far 
better than having the cops quickly shovel out the corpse and disturb all 
the evidence around it!
 
In reality, all detective work is archaeology because you’re using the material 
evidence to interpret past human behavior of some kind. You may map out 
where the body lies and the things around it. You interview people and check 
the written records. Whether it’s a burned-down house, a car-crash pileup, or 
a murder scene in the woods, you’re carefully recording and collecting finds. 
Even that blood-spatter expert on the detective team reconstructing the crime 
is studying the material evidence and so doing archaeology.
War crimes and disaster investigations
Archaeology also assists international investigations of genocide and mass 
murders. Working for the United Nations or other humanitarian organizations, 
archaeologists excavate graves of “disappeared” people — victims of 
political regimes that may now be on trial. They dig up detailed evidence of 
these horrible crimes and locate and identify remains for relatives of victims. 
Sometimes the skeletons aren’t identifiable; artifacts like clothing are all that 
are left to provide identification.
Natural disasters like tsunamis, mudslides, explosions, fires, and earthquakes 
also claim victims whose remains and identities are archaeologically 
excavated. This is true for human-made disasters too. Archaeologists helped 
recovery efforts after the 9-11 World Trade Center attacks, the Oklahoma City 
bombing, and other tragedies, as well as after Hurricane Katrina.
Crash victims
Any plane crash site is of course investigated with archaeological techniques. 
A team of archaeologists is still looking for Amelia Earhart, the famous pilot 
who disappeared in the Pacific while she was trying to fly around the world 
in 1937. Using typical survey and excavation techniques, they’re recovering 
suggestive artifacts, including a possible piece of her shoe.

44
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
Even military victims of wartime have been subjects of archaeological 
investigations. Pilots shot down in Vietnam in the 1960s are now being 
excavated from remains of crashed aircraft. Personal artifacts — even dog 
tags found while screening the shoveled soil — aid identification.
 
Forensic archaeology takes a special kind of dedicated investigator. The 
processes may be slow and difficult if you’re dealing with thousands of 
victims. Emotional involvement with the events and victims’ loved ones is 
often unavoidable and much more than the typical archaeological dig usually 
requires. Plus you have to be ready to respond at the last minute to calls from 
law enforcement officers. Finally, you have to be willing to testify in court, 
should that be required. It may mean you have to reveal personal details 
about your own life.
Historic preservation, heritage, 
and community archaeology
You may think historic preservation means saving famous buildings like 
George Washington’s (or Elvis’s) home. But it also means saving archaeological 
sites, even ones that don’t look like anything because they’re all in the ground. 
You can investigate the heritage of a whole nation or a small community with 
archaeology.
Historic preservation
All governments have some laws requiring location and protection of historic 
and archaeological sites, at least on public lands. Historic preservation 
specialists may work in private foundations or government agencies, or even 
as lobbyists working with legislators to improve laws or raise funds to 
protect sites or investigate them further; in fact, sometimes they spend more 
time raising money and public awareness than digging. But you can’t dig the 
sites if they aren’t preserved!
 
George Washington’s famous 18th-century estate Mount Vernon, on the 
Potomac River in Virginia, included much more than just his plantation mansion. 
Archaeological excavations give clues about other buildings and aspects of his 
life that are long gone. Uncovering the foundations of the original blacksmith 
shop and forge allows an accurate reconstruction of this building.
Fascinating results came from excavating Washington’s original distillery 
(see Color Figure 5). Archaeologists compared evidence in the ground with 
his writings about the industrial technology and constructions. Now the plan 
is to reconstruct the distillery as well, right on its original foundations, next 
to the restored gristmill. Visitors will one day be able to see how the first U.S. 
president was one of the greatest whiskey producers of his time. (But will 
they serve samples to show how it probably tasted?)

45
 Chapter 3: So You Want to Do Archaeology? What Kind? 
The heritage of communities and ethnic groups
Archaeologists often work with specific communities to preserve and 
investigate both the standing buildings and the archaeological (in the 
ground) evidence of their past. This process can include digging, 
documenting oral histories of elderly residents, even proving descent of 
modern folks from past cultures whose remains lie buried.
You may research the past of a particular ethnic or indigenous (native to the 
land) group. They may want to learn when their ancestors first arrived or 
how they lived. Several Native American groups have tribal archaeologists 
who survey, dig, run museums, and educate the public about their ancient 
ways. Archaeological study can validate land claims or help raise money for 
the local people through archaeo-tourism. It can bring people knowledge of 
their heritage that may be lost to history or never known at all. Pride in your 
cultural heritage is much enhanced with the hard data of archaeology!
Cultural resources management (CRM) 
and contract archaeology
A huge part of the archaeology done today is devoted to finding and saving 
remains of the human past so that they can be investigated. This may be 
required by law or part of a public or private effort. Locating archaeological 
sites, evaluating them, and excavating or preserving them are the main tasks 
of cultural resources management, which includes contracting out for such 
expertise.
Cultural resources management
Important historic buildings, objects, or archaeological sites are cultural 
resources. Managing them means deciding how to protect, use, and study 
them. But cultural resources management (CRM) means first you have to find 
the sites — yes, the foundations of historic buildings, but especially the 
prehistoric sites that may have no visible trace on the landscape. You also 
have to know your laws really well. Then you have to figure out how to 
interpret the sites to the public (or not), and whether you can even destroy 
them to build something else.
Officials who manage cultural (and natural) resources and lands can be 
government archaeologists. More often they hire contract archaeologists, who 
survey and find sites and then evaluate their significance. Archaeologists 
at the U.S. National Park Service (NPS) under the Secretary of the Interior, 
as well as other federal agencies, manage sites at parks, military bases, 
national forests, and other public lands. Every U.S. state has a State Historic 
Preservation Office (SHPO — those government agencies love acronyms) 
that does or reviews archaeology. Most countries have official plans for 

46
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
safeguarding their archaeological heritages and specialists who carry these 
plans out (including issuing permits for visiting archaeologists’ digs).
Other government archaeologists specialize in antiquities laws, to conserve 
their national heritage from looting, and in public interpretation of sites and 
archaeo-tourism to bring the past alive to visitors.
Contract archaeology
Private companies, non-profit agencies, and university anthropology 
departments doing contract archaeology now do more archaeology than 
anyone else. Contract archaeology is often for profit, but should always be 
done at the same high research standards as any other kind of archaeology. 
This is sometimes difficult if the contracting agency or client needs the 
work done fast or doesn’t want to pay much.
Usually contract archaeology means you start with survey and work through 
three phases, in the CRM lingo:
 
 Phase I: Survey: You inspect the records of a planned building project 
to see if any known sites fall in the project area and then do the field-
work to find any other sites that may be there. (See Chapter 6 for more 
on archaeological survey.) A reconnaissance survey is less in-depth than 
a complete Phase I, and may not involve actual fieldwork, only checking 
existing records. Or it may be just a quick walk-over of the project area, 
not involving any detailed field inspection or shovel tests (very small 
excavations) to see what’s buried. Depending on what you find, you may 
get the proposed construction altered to avoid archaeological sites — 
moving a proposed highway a hundred feet northward, for example. Or 
you may see that nothing significant is in the way that requires any more 
archaeology.
 
 Phase II: Test excavation: You may need limited excavation to evaluate 
the importance of promising sites. For example, if you find artifacts 
on the ground surface, you may dig test excavations (maybe a meter 
square) to see if you uncover intact cultural deposits (undisturbed layers 
containing artifacts, food garbage, or other indicators of past human 
behavior). Or you may find nothing at all of significance because these 
cultural deposits have all been plowed up or otherwise disturbed and 
lost their scientific information.
 
 Phase III: Excavation: Really significant sites may have to be destroyed 
anyway in the name of progress (or whatever is being built). So then you 
do salvage archaeology (now called data recovery), where you get to dig 
much bigger areas to recover and study as much as you can before it’s 
all gone. Check out Chapter 7 for more on how to do excavation.

47
 Chapter 3: So You Want to Do Archaeology? What Kind? 
You generally need to write reports describing the work and results of all 
phases of investigation. Usually you have to do them by strict deadlines. 
Builders may tell you, “My bulldozers are waiting!”
Any archaeology involves many ethical considerations, which I discuss in 
Chapter 8. But contract archaeology has additional issues because you’re 
serving clients, usually for profit. I’ve had clients offer me more money not 
to find anything (no, thanks!). They wanted to get going on their projects 
without delays to meet government regulation. This is like telling your doctor 
you’ll pay more to be told the scan shows no cancer in your body. There still 
may be something important in there needing attention.
The CRM industry
Some think that CRM and contract archaeology differ from academic (university 
or museum) or research archaeology, but they’re wrong — all archaeology 
should be done to the same standards. Many academics do contracts, and 
many CRM and contract archaeologists do long-term research. Ideally, they 
differ only in the amount and speed of work done. Academics do train students, 
and private firms do earn profits, but often they all work on the same projects.
Archaeology by CRM agencies and firms may not be published in regular 
archaeology books and journals. They often just don’t have time before the next 
project to write more than the official reports filed away in government agencies. 
These reports are often called gray literature because they’re less available; 
however, they’re increasingly becoming easier to find as electronic documents.
The shovel bum life
As a fieldworker in contract archaeology, you 
may be called a “shovel bum.” The peculiar 
(but often celebrated) lifestyle means going 
from project to project and region to region 
digging small shovel tests all day. You get to be 
outdoors and do physical work, but you often 
spend weeks not finding anything. This keeps 
the clients happy (because they don’t have to 
pay for more work at significant sites) but isn’t 
so exciting. Plus you may not have benefits of 
regular employment.
I know some shovel bums who’ve gone back to 
school for advanced degrees and better jobs. I 
also know some who love the lifestyle and have 
been doing it for decades. You do get to be the 
first to uncover something exciting in the field 
while the PI (principal investigator, or head of 
the project) may be back in the office writing the 
last report! You may even be sent back to the 
office yourself to help write the report on your 
fieldwork and finds.

Museum archaeology and 
collections management
In a museum you can do lots of exciting archaeology, and (possibly) not get 
as dirty. You certainly won’t get as many bug bites!
 
Research on museum collections can bring amazing results. Now that archae-
ologists have chemical techniques to analyze them, residues on pots that 
have sat on a shelf since they were dug up a century ago may reveal what past 
people were eating. Piecing together new finds from your site with those exca-
vated earlier and stored on the shelf may give you a whole new picture of past 
life. Other museum specialists may help you identify a rock, plant, or animal 
that’s the key to some past event.
Museum work
Museum work involves everything from leading tours to fund-raising to 
setting up exhibits. You have to know archaeological theory to make sure 
you reconstruct past people’s lives without ethnocentric biases of modern 
times (showing all those cave guys dragging cave gals around by the hair is 
out these days). You have to know ethics and antiquities laws so you don’t 
acquire looted artifacts or contribute toward the loss of someone’s heritage.
Curation and collections management
Curation means caring for things, often for the indefinite future. First you 
have to clean your finds and number and analyze them in the laboratory after 
the dig. (I describe processing and analyzing finds in Chapters 9 and 10.) But 
then artifacts and archaeological data must be stored so that they
 
 Won’t decay or be damaged
 
 Are all completely listed in comprehensive catalogs
 
 Never lose the information of their original provenience (location)
 
 Can be easily located for further research
 
 Can be available for public appreciation in exhibits and then put 
carefully away while others are pulled out for new exhibits
 
 Are in a good system of information management, as well as management 
of objects
Archaeological collections management is expensive and labor-intensive. 
Many professionals ignore it because it’s more fun to dig; remember that last 
scene when Indiana Jones’s lost ark is put in a box on the shelf with the rest 
of the collections?

49
 Chapter 3: So You Want to Do Archaeology? What Kind? 
Listing every item in every bag is tedious — endless hours making computer 
databases isn’t most people’s idea of fun. Treatment of fragile items may 
require smelly chemicals. Storage of materials in sturdy, non-degradable 
containers means you become an expert in acid-free paper and curation 
cabinets. Conservation means you repair, photograph, and scan original 
maps and notes, or piece together statue fragments. As a curator, you’re an 
expert in climate-controlled, secure artifact and records storage away from 
humid air, termites, rats, and burglars.
Most people don’t realize this stuff is all a part of archaeology too! Plus you 
have to argue continually for more space for collections. Sometimes you 
can discard some artifacts (de-accession in museum lingo), but this is tricky 
because you really want to keep everything — it may be useful for future 
research. Archaeologists of the 1930s threw out animal bones and charcoal, 
thinking it was just garbage. Well, it was — then. Now it can be used for 
radiocarbon dating and reconstructing diet and environment!
Avocational and educational archaeology
Amateur or avocational archaeologists do it as a hobby, not as a profession. 
This doesn’t mean you don’t do it well, however! The word amateur comes 
from the Latin for “love” — you do it because you love it, not because you’re 
getting paid! Many avocationals are ethical collectors and volunteers who 
work with professionals or on their own. They may even publish articles 
about their finds or record them with government archaeology offices.
Public education in archaeology often includes programs for volunteers 
or amateurs. You may hear of an archaeology day or month with various 
activities like digs and artifact replication. Education specialists often help 
teachers with lesson plans or take traveling exhibits to schools to expand the 
curriculum. Unfortunately, archaeology isn’t taught in most elementary and 
high schools, so kids end up thinking it means dinosaurs. Archaeology 
education programs also take place in museums and parks and with kids’ 
groups like scout troops and camps.
Other kinds of archaeology
You can emphasize a particular part of the past that holds your interest in 
your archaeological study. Here are some of the many specialty terms you 
may see:
 
 Landscape archaeology considers the whole integrated environment 
in which people lived. For this specialty, you need to know geology, 
landforms, biology, and ecosystems to see resources available and how 
people would have used, even shaped their surroundings. Environmental 
archaeology is another term for this.

50
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
 
 Geoarchaeology combines geology, geography, and archaeology in 
various ways, whether studying soils, rock formations, and landforms 
or remote sensing, imaging, and mapping techniques (using fancy 
instruments such as radar and magnetometers to get images below the 
ground or map with 3-D laser technology).
 
 Mortuary archaeology involves specialists who excavate human graves, 
often to relocate them out of the path of some new construction. Or they 
may study different kinds of burials to learn about social organization 
and religion.
 
 Bioarchaeology refers to the study of human skeletons and their con-
texts, and requires training in biological anthropology.
 
 Field archaeology (going out and digging) can be contrasted with 
laboratory archaeology (processing and analyzing materials and data that 
come in from the dig), but most professionals and amateurs do both.
 
 Theoretical archaeology means figuring out what happened in the past 
by using particular models and assumptions about how humans behave 
at a general level. (Writing archaeological theory is often a way to avoid 
the hard physical labor of digging, however.) Sometimes it’s the first 
step in the process, and sometimes it’s the last. Different types of theo-
ries (explored in Chapter 11) include cognitive archaeology (humanistic, 
dealing with how people thought in the past), processual archaeology 
(scientific), and culture history (descriptive). Some may call all this “arm-
chair” archaeology, but thinking is hard work too!
 
 Ethnoarchaeology (studying living cultures and their material stuff) 
and experimental archaeology (replicating past artifacts yourself) are 
two techniques used to help interpret what you’re digging up. (I tell you 
more about these in Chapter 11).
 
 Biblical archaeology looks for evidence in the ground to support the 
historic record of the Bible, both Old (ancient Hebrews) and New (time 
of Jesus) Testaments. So it’s a particular form of historical archaeology. 
It used to aim to prove biblical truth (and sometimes still does) but more 
often lately is grounded in real science (making it far more exciting).
 
 Archaeoastronomy studies how past peoples related with the sky, 
including aligning monuments with the sun, moon, or planets and using 
astronomical knowledge for religious or other purposes.
 
 Garbology is a wonderful term for the archaeology of our very modern 
trash, as collected weekly from our homes or deposited in landfills. It 
can tell us things about ourselves (consumer behavior, waste, biode-
gradability — described more in Chapter 2) that we can’t get anywhere 
else. (And yes, this includes digging through movie stars’ trash to find 
out what they’re up to as well.) It’s still archaeology!

 Chapter 3: So You Want to Do Archaeology? What Kind? 
Special Studies Related to Archaeology
Certain specialists in other sciences relate their work to the archaeological 
record. To do these specialties you need training in a whole additional area 
besides archaeology.
Zooarchaeology: Animal remains
Zooarchaeologists identify animal remains at archaeological sites. They’re 
biologists specializing in zoology, and often in certain categories of animals 
(shellfish, fish, or mammals, for example). Some of the things zooarchaeology 
can show you about the excavated remains:
 
 What animal species are present at the site, as compared with what was 
available in the general environment
 
 What animals people were eating or using for some other resource (like 
making bone tools)
 
 What the environment was like based on what critters are present
 
 Whether the animals were domesticated and were being raised by the 
people or whether they were hunted or captured wild
Paleoethnobotany: Plant remains
Paleoethnobotanists can identify plant remains preserved at an archaeological 
site and tell some of the same things about past diets, environments, and 
domestication. They can see what resources people were using for other 
purposes (medicinal plants and drugs, industrial plants such as cotton or 
gourds for containers). To do this, you have to be a good botanist in the 
first place. Then you also have to recognize tiny plant fragments all charred, 
beaten up, and aged perhaps many centuries!
Archaeometry: Archaeological sciences
Archaeometry means various techniques in the physical and natural sciences 
(chemistry, physics, biology) used for archaeological goals. They include 
everything from complicated dating methods to figuring out the component 
elements in the artifact raw material in order to trace where it came from. 
You can specialize in any one or several of these.

52
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
 
Archaeometric techniques usually involve the use of big complex instruments 
in scientific laboratories and acronyms or abbreviations only understandable 
by the initiated. Some examples of techniques for materials analysis:
 
 A scanning electron microscope (SEM) can see details of materials at 
extremely high magnification — even tiny cut marks or cell walls.
 
 X-rays can show the insides of artifacts (or mummies!), as can CAT 
scans and other medical techniques.
 
 X-ray fluorescence (XRF) shows component elements within metals and 
ceramics to see the source of the material.
 
 Instrumental neutron activation analysis (NAA) also shows trace 
elements to tie raw materials to sources.
 
 Light stable isotope analysis (of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur), can 
show mineral components of bone to see what the person or animal ate.
 
 Thermal ionization mass spectrometry (of lead, strontium) also shows 
bone minerals.
 
 DNA analysis gives information on plant and animal species and 
relatedness of human remains to different populations
I describe in Chapter 10 some further examples of archaeometric techniques 
used in dating archaeological finds.
What Kind of Archaeology 
Do You Want to Do?
You may start out with one kind of archaeology, then switch to or add 
another. Or you may do many at once. Certainly in most kinds of archaeology 
you work with specialists in other fields, sharing knowledge and maybe 
making new discoveries together.
Most projects combine many of the specialties described in this chapter. A 
good archaeologist should at least know where to send finds for finer analyses.
The particulars of the archaeology you do depend upon where you go to do 
it or how you get involved. If you’re excavating Paleolithic hunter–gatherers 
foraging around the landscape for mammoth meat and edible roots, you 
won’t need to know the trace elements in copper and silver artifacts. If you 
specialize in marble architecture, you probably won’t need to send out any 
bones to the zooarchaeologist. But if you happen to excavate a 17th-century 
sword in your backyard while planting flowers, you may be inspired to 
become a historic weapons expert, as well as a conservation specialist (to 
learn how to keep the thing from rusting any more).

How Archaeologists 
Think and Work
In This Chapter
 Beginning an investigation
 Reasoning from the evidence
 Exploring the scientific method
 Looking at a case study
A
rchaeology is detective work. You determine what you’re looking for, 
and then gather the evidence — material clues and otherwise — and 
piece it together. This may involve adventure and even changing plans in 
mid-project, but it will certainly require some really tedious work! Then you 
use what you find to explain what happened in the past. Sometimes you get 
different or conflicting answers, so you may need to go get more evidence of 
different kinds.
In this chapter, I show you the steps that often take place in an 
archaeological project. As you may expect, a lot of planning is involved 
before you take part in any fieldwork. I also tell the story of a typical 
archaeological investigation I conducted researching a mystery mound. It 
led through false starts and confusing clues, but in the end, the mystery 
was solved — unlike many archaeological puzzles, which remain for 
generations of investigators to examine.

54
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
How an Archaeological 
Investigation Begins
The first thing to do when you begin an archaeological investigation is 
determine what you’re looking for and why, and then how to go about 
finding it. After you determine this, you can decide what tools you need, 
what kind of schedule, how many workers, what kinds of techniques and 
special studies, and how long (and how much funding) it will take. Modern 
archaeology stresses conservation — not digging. You destroy the record 
forever as you dig, so if you’re going to disturb it, you have to be asking real 
research questions or saving what you can in the face of some impending 
destruction.
For example, if you have information and artifacts from an earlier dig at an 
archaeological site but no idea how old it is, you can dig only a small portion 
to get some charcoal for radiocarbon dating. Or if you can preserve most of 
a site by suggesting a planned construction be moved away from it, you can 
excavate only the small portion that’s in the way of some construction that 
can’t be moved. In that case, you know you only need a few weeks and a few 
workers to dig up that part.
Determining your research goals
You may have any number of reasons to do archaeological research, such as
 
 You want to know about a specific issue in the past. (How old are these 
mounds? Why were they built? When did farming start in this region?)
 
 Little is known about the archaeology of a particular place, so you want 
to find out just what’s there to be able to tell its story, perhaps for the 
possible descendants of the past people who made the site.
 
 An archaeological site has been uncovered by some disturbance 
(bulldozing for construction, looting), and you want to know what it is 
and whether it’s worth saving.
 
 Some proposed disturbance (construction, land-clearing) may threaten 
archaeological sites, so you want to find out whether any are there and 
whether they’re important and worth saving.
Keep these goals in mind as you plan your research design.

55
 Chapter 4: How Archaeologists Think and Work
Coming up with a research design
Before you do an archaeological project, whether survey (looking for sites) 
or excavation, you need to have a research design. This is usually a document 
detailing what you’re looking for in any scientific study and what your plan is 
to find it. It guides your work and, for archaeology, justifies why you’re doing 
it in the first place (because you destroy your subject matter as you dig). 
Here’s what should be in a research design:
 
 The goals of the research: What exactly do you hope to find? You 
typically state these goals as scientific hypotheses you want to test: “If 
this is true, I should find that.”
 
 Your methodology: What are the sets of methods you need to reach 
the goals? What are your basic assumptions and theoretical perspectives 
(discussed more in Chapter 11) — in other words, ways of explaining 
how people behaved in the past (whether purely descriptive, scientific 
and analytical, or humanistic).
 
 Your strategies, methods, and specific techniques: How do they all 
work?
 
 The logistical details: What’s the project schedule? How many people 
are participating?
A research design may sound difficult to compose, but it’s not. Say you’re 
looking for a lost wallet. It’s not the lost ark, but it’s more important right 
now. Your goal is to find it. Your methodology combines physically looking 
with talking to people. You assume it’s not stolen. Your methods are to go to 
where you last had it and to every place you’ve been since. Your techniques 
are to rummage around (excavate, if you will) in all those places and also to 
ask everyone in all those places whether they’ve seen it. One theoretical 
perspective is your view that people are basically nice — if someone found 
the wallet, you can probably recover it at the lost-and-found center. If you 
don’t find it, you may need to change your initial assumptions and conclude 
it’s been stolen!
Planning the archaeological project
In Chapters 6 and 7, I tell you more about planning archaeological survey 
and excavation projects, respectively. Here I describe a few examples of 
archaeological research designs and how they fit into the entire project plan.
Archaeology, like any other science, begins in several different ways, from 
the well-organized, ideal long-term project to the last-minute salvage of 
something important to investigate before it’s gone. You often change 
directions as you conduct the investigation.

56
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
The ideal project
The ideal archaeological investigation lists well-thought-out questions you 
hope to answer. You then include the “where” and “how” that you need to get 
the answers to those first questions, and you can’t forget the “how much will 
it take” — not only in money but also in time, labor, and paperwork.
For example, say you’re a federal archaeologist who wants to research the 
ruins of the old homestead in the woods over in the north section of the park. 
Your goals may be to get enough information to see whether it’s even a 
significant site. If it is, you want to be able to explain it better to the visitors 
and protect it in the park. Your plan may include the following:
 
 Investigate land records in the courthouse and park archives, see who 
owned the site before the park bought it, and find out whether any 
drawings or photos of it exist.
 
 Look in the library or courthouse for old maps that may have the 
homestead on them.
 
 Talk to old-timers in the area who may know of the family that lived 
there back in the day.
 
 Excavate a few test squares in the yard around brick foundations of the 
house and barn.
 
 Have park volunteers help dig, screen, and process finds in the lab, and 
then see what you can reconstruct of the homesteaders’ lives and how 
long ago they were there.
You estimate how long this plan will take, given the number of workers and 
days you have. Do the background work first (or on rainy days) so you know 
where the best places to dig may be. The park funds the project for as many 
weeks as it takes and gives you the labor and the supplies and the time in 
your office to write the report and management plan for the site.
The more typical project
Circumstance usually intervenes to change the ideal project. Budgets and 
workers get cut, volunteers may not show up, equipment breaks, weather is 
unseasonably awful, or the shelter you wanted to use for a lab is damaged.
In trying to track down old documents on the homestead, you find that all 
the archives were destroyed in the courthouse fire. However, one old map 
you discover in the dusty back drawer of the little local library shows several 
buildings on the site, not just the house and barn that appeared on the land 
survey when the park bought the site.

57
 Chapter 4: How Archaeologists Think and Work
So now you have to dig in a few more areas near where those old buildings 
may have been to see whether you can find their “footprint” in the soil, 
and figure out what they were. There you find artifacts — crockery, metal 
tools—100 or more years older than what you expected. You get community 
publicity by giving a local talk and showing that this homestead actually 
dates to the first founding of the county. More volunteers and funding 
support appear! One old-timer who shows up for your talk tells you that 
when he was a kid he heard the place used to be a mill operation before it 
was just a homestead. Now you must take on historic industrial archaeology 
too.
Salvage archaeology
Salvage or rescue archaeology gives you little time for advance planning. Say 
you get a call reporting artifacts and bones eroding out of the lake shore. You 
have to go see what they are before you can even determine what research 
you need to do. Human bones are covered by strict laws, and you may even 
need to bring in the medical examiner. If the artifacts and bones are all 
washed around, you may not even be able to tell whether they’re together!
It’s very much like detective work: You know a murder has occurred, but you 
have to go examine the body and all the stuff around it and talk with the wit-
nesses and bystanders before you know what questions to ask next. As soon 
as you know the murder weapon was the brother-in-law’s gun (based on that 
material evidence, the scientific match between the gun and the fatal bullet), 
you begin to narrow down your investigation!
Limiting the work
Sometimes you have to compromise and give up one research possibility to 
get a better one accomplished. You may need to focus on what’s less known.
For example, as part of a huge project in the southeastern U.S., I excavated 
many sites in a valley where people had lived continuously for thousands of 
years. We had limited time and funds; because we knew more about the later 
prehistoric people and really wanted information on the earliest inhabitants, 
we had to bulldoze away (and abandon) the later cultural deposits to exca-
vate the deeper, older material more quickly. We had no choice because the 
government was building a big canal and needed us out of there fast.
Changing in the middle of the work
 
The nature of archaeology means that investigations are constantly changing 
in schedule, focus, and goals. You may have bad weather or equipment break-
downs. Most interesting is when you find something different from what you 
expected and alter your research questions, sometimes even within a single 
project. Changes keep archaeology exciting!

58
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
How Archaeologists Use Science
Archaeological interpretations are supported by the scientific investigation 
of many different kinds of evidence.
Using the scientific method 
and testing hypotheses
The scientific method works like this:
 
1. You ask a question about something you observe and collect 
background information on what’s already known about it.
 
2. You come up with possible explanations — your hypotheses. These 
statements must be testable — for example, you have to be able to say, 
“If we find this, then we should also find that.”
 
3. You test your hypotheses by experimenting or otherwise collecting 
data that will support or refute them. Your tests usually require new or 
different data from what you used to make the hypotheses.
 
 If the test refutes a hypothesis, you need a new explanation that’s also 
testable. If the test upholds the hypothesis, you may want to test it again 
anyway with more data or different methods to keep refining your 
explanation.
 
4. If many of your hypotheses are supported, you can use them to make 
a whole model of how something works.
 
5. If your model can be applied in many situations, you can develop a 
theory or law.
Here’s an example of how these steps may work in archaeology:
 
1. Archaeologists observe prehistoric burial mounds and earthworks in 
the eastern United States, and ask what kind of societies made them.
 
2. They hypothesize that these structures were built by settled societies 
supported by intensive maize (corn) agriculture who had the labor to 
create such constructions. This hypothesis is based on the background 
information that many cultures in the world began to build large 
structures and monuments after settling down and beginning to farm.
 
3. They excavate many of these sites containing mounds and earthworks 
over the years to test this idea by looking for evidence of agriculture 
(domestic plant fragments, cultivated fields).

59
 Chapter 4: How Archaeologists Think and Work
 
 However, the hypothesis isn’t supported. They find hardly any maize 
remains. They do find fragments of weedy local plants from small 
gardens, but not evidence of intensive farming. Furthermore, they 
find lots of bits of wild plants, showing people were still moving 
around collecting non-domesticated species.
 
 With the original hypothesis seemingly refuted, the archaeologists come 
up with this explanation: Even if people weren’t producing their own 
food on a large scale, or even settling in one place, they could still build 
massive public architecture.
 
 Another, independent test of the hypothesis has been to examine the 
bone chemistry of the human skeletons. A maize diet leaves a specific 
signature in bone, but these skeletons show the people ate mostly wild 
foods.
 
4. The archaeologists propose a model that suggests a culture doesn’t 
need settled farmers to build large structures or radically shape its 
landscape.
 
5. This model has been confirmed elsewhere in the world, a reminder that 
humans don’t behave the same everywhere!
In archaeology, as in other fields, scientific methods never prove things but 
rather only support or reject hypotheses. The good part is that science is 
self-correcting — scientists perform new tests of old hypotheses all the time 
(although rejecting a mistaken idea can take a while).
Hypothesis testing at San Luis Mission
A good example of testing hypotheses came at 
the 16th-century Spanish mission site of San 
Luis in Tallahassee, Florida (which I describe 
in Chapter 19). It’s a huge site, and funds were 
limited, so the archaeologist had to have a good 
research plan. He did small test excavations at 
different areas of the site. The Spanish 
documents said the site had a church and other 
European buildings, and also a big Apalachee 
Indian council house.
He knew Spaniards would have had rectangular 
buildings and Apalachee had round ones. The 
test dig uncovered a few large dark circles 
in the reddish soil. He thought these features 
were evidence of big timbers holding up a 
structure, so he cross-sectioned them to make 
sure they were shaped like posts. They were 
arranged in a wide arc, so he calculated the 
circumference of a round building they may 
have held up. He drew this circle on the 
ground and hypothesized that it may be a large 
structure. To test this idea, he excavated just a 
few other spots along the circle to see whether 
he found any more large postmolds. And he did. 
The pattern of the structure was huge (140 feet 
in diameter), so he knew it was most likely not 
just a Native American house but the actual 
council house location.

Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
Making assumptions about the past
You have to be careful in archaeological interpretation because you can’t 
expect people in the past to have done things the way they’re done in your 
society. You may find cases of hypotheses that seem to hold up under initial 
testing but that aren’t supported by later work with newer methods. The 
invention of the telescope changed the way early astronomers viewed the 
solar system. (You mean everything doesn’t revolve around the Earth?) In 
the same way, tools like radiocarbon dating or high-tech remote sensing 
methods have changed some views of the past.
For example, fancy remote sensing developed by the military made it 
possible for archaeologists to see things through the jungle. Areas where 
they thought the prehistoric Maya did only low-level agriculture showed up 
on the radar and sonar images with fancy raised, ridged fields and other 
constructions for intensive crop management. They weren’t even visible on 
the ground because, well, it’s a jungle in there!
The basic assumptions you begin with may be wrong. For example, early 
archaeologists in the Amazon used a theoretical perspective called 
environmental determinism — meaning the environment determines what 
people do. They thought that prehistoric people there were simple hunter–
gatherers who were later transformed into modest farmers by influences 
moving eastward from the great civilizations that built pyramids in Peru. The 
assumption was that it was too hot and humid in the jungle to be very 
ambitious, so obviously people there were mostly lying around in the 
hammock all the time.
This thinking was of course very ethnocentric (judging other cultures by your 
own standards). It was an assumption made by scientists from temperate 
climates who found it difficult to get around in the rainforest. Later archaeolo-
gists found evidence of plenty of complex prehistoric Amazonian societies. 
They documented large mounds full of beautiful pottery, huge cultivated areas, 
immense earthworks, roads, and canals through the jungle. Aerial photos and 
satellite images helped them find patterns that they couldn’t even see on the 
ground (because of the forest and the trees).
Case Study: The Mystery Mounds 
in the Florida Jungle
Here’s a story from my own work to illustrate how archaeologists think, how 
they test hypotheses, how you can be really wrong, and how you can begin 
again with new assumptions and methods. It all happened over a period of 
many years in the large river valley where I work in northwest Florida. I’m 
interested in all prehistoric and historic time periods in this rural, remote 

61
 Chapter 4: How Archaeologists Think and Work
area. The local people love archaeology and have been gracious over the 
years in sharing their knowledge and artifact collections with me and other 
professionals.
This valley has dozens of prehistoric mounds that date anywhere from A.D. 
100 to 1500. Many of them have been common knowledge for a century or 
two, because people are always interested in them. But in the thick forest 
many still remain to be discovered as well. For me, the best way to find new 
ones has been to ask the people who hunt, fish, and otherwise tromp through 
the woods and see things. All these earthen constructions are on the 
riverbanks or smaller streams, so one day when some local folks told me 
about a mound deep in the swamp, I asked whether they could take me there.
Discovering a new mound
We went down the river in a couple of boats and then trekked a mile through 
the Florida summer jungle carpeted and draped in poison ivy. We finally got 
to a nice earthen mound sticking up out of the low floodplain. It was sitting 
on the bank of a tiny creek that had a couple inches of water. A prehistoric 
Native American mound should have contained typical artifacts. But we 
didn’t find the tiniest potsherd or stone tool or chipped stone flake. Because 
most of the surface was covered in vegetation, I assumed these objects were 
beneath the surface waiting to be found.
Eliminating impossible interpretations
I checked the official state archaeological site file to see whether this mound 
was already recorded. One state archaeologist thought he’d seen it years 
earlier, and agreed to come with me to see whether it was the same one. We 
went down the river many miles; he wanted to go in the winter when it was 
more of a freezing swamp. The little creek was dry, so we walked along it and 
got to the mound, but it looked different, even bigger.
We dug a couple of shovel-test excavations this time. One into the flat ground 
on the creek bank, where the village that went with the mound should have 
been, had nothing but yellow-brown sand. The other hole, into the bottom 
slope of the mound, uncovered two tiny prehistoric pottery sherds in the top 
few inches. But far deeper was a rusty piece of iron. This discovery didn’t 
make sense; iron would have been from later historic times and therefore 
should have been on top.
Things got more complicated when the state archaeologist returned to his 
office, got out his files with the sketch map of the mound he thought he’d 
visited, and found it was a different one. We conferred and realized we had 
two mounds on different bends of the same tiny creek.

62
Part I: Archaeology: Seeing Past People Today 
We went back to map the mounds and dig more small tests, this time on the 
mound summits. The soil there was an interesting coarse reddish sand. But 
we found only a couple of more pieces of iron and a blue and white historic 
crockery sherd. We knew lots of hunters had been around here over the 
decades, but would they have brought nice plates in for their lunches?
The biggest realization was that this just couldn’t be a prehistoric mound 
site. A prehistoric mound is a ceremonial place that people live around; their 
artifacts should have been everywhere, and they weren’t.
Researching remaining possibilities
To paraphrase Sherlock Holmes, when you have eliminated the impossible, 
whatever is left — however improbable — must be the answer. If the mounds 
weren’t prehistoric, they could only be either natural or historic in origin. We 
had only two other possibilities.
The mounds may have been built by the natural river flooding and dumping 
sands in a pile that just didn’t erode away somehow. To determine this, I 
asked a geologist and a geographer specializing in soils to come to the site, 
and we dug another deep hole. The soils specialist determined the coarse 
reddish sand wasn’t typical of low-lying swampland, and the geologist said 
the mounds didn’t look natural at all.
So humans had made the mounds in historic times, but when and why? The 
first thing I did was talk with a timber company expert. I asked for any reason 
people would have built a mound during logging operations. He got out an 
old movie showing how they cut timber in the 19th century and hauled it out 
with mules or floated it out in canals. But they didn’t pile up earth for 
anything. In fact, he said, that swampland probably wasn’t even logged 
because it was so low and wet that wagons would have gotten bogged down.
In hopes of finding a clue, I decided to see whether anyone else had owned 
the land in the past. I went to the county courthouse to look up the land 
records. There I realized that the mound location was so remote, it hadn’t 
even been surveyed into official government Sections. When I asked how I 
could look up something that didn’t even have a section number, the lady 
said she didn’t know, but I should ask old George.
This elderly gentleman was sitting among the deed books doing historical 
research. He had been the clerk of county court for 50 years, and really knew 
the local land. He said, sure he knew the mounds; they were Civil War forts!

63
 Chapter 4: How Archaeologists Think and Work
Finding historical answers
George said he’d played on the mounds when he was a kid, and adults had 
told him they were Confederate forts, big gun batteries. But when I asked 
what they were doing a mile deep in the swamp, he had no answer. I knew 
the South had lost the war, but their generals weren’t stupid. Why would they 
build fortifications so far from the river?
I knew I could find lots of historical documentation for the Civil War. 
Generals, engineers, and strategists wrote down everything they did. So I 
consulted a good historian who knew where to look up old documents. He 
found official war maps and records detailing the planning, construction, and 
abandonment of the two forts. These records answered the question of why 
the forts were so far away from the river. Turns out, they weren’t.
The two forts were indeed built right on the riverbank. The tiny creek had 
then been the big river channel. The forts were built to defend against the 
invading Union navy. Slaves brought coarse red soil from upriver to make 
the mounds, which then became the platforms for big cannons. Whatever 
soil they got had those couple of prehistoric Native American potsherds in it! 
Then, in the river right below the forts, they placed obstructions — sunken 
boats, logs, and chains. The idea was that the bad guys would come up the 
river and be stopped, and then the Confederates could shoot them.
But the Union boats never came, and the two forts were soon abandoned. 
The obstructions made the river shift its channel eastward. The original 
channel filled in and mostly dried up, becoming the tiny jungle creek that 
disappeared in the dry season (see Figure 4-1). The forts became overgrown, 
shrouded in green foliage, and forgotten.
After learning all this, I changed tactics and went back to both forts with 
metal detectors. My crew unearthed more metal, nails, and even a possible 
cannon part. We never found the soldiers’ camp, but we did march through 
the jungle, using the old Civil War map to locate the obstructions in the 
former river bed — big metal slats sticking up from the forest floor!
The investigation of the two mystery mounds is typical of an archaeological 
project in that the research questions and conditions often change. You find 
yourself looking for something different from when you started. But it’s also not 
a typical project because I got final answers. Most archaeology, especially with 
prehistoric sites, never permits complete reconstruction of what happened in 
the past. At least when you have historical records you can get some idea. For 
more ancient times, many puzzles must remain (at least until better tools come 
along).

mounds
Using the discoveries for 
modern applications
The information about the forts has been helpful in modern times. Scientists 
and engineers have been trying to explain why this river dumps so much 
sand just at this place, blocking navigation. I’ve been able to show them that 
the river’s just trying to get back to its old natural channel, not the new one 
it was forced into by military tactics in times of war. Human manipulation of 
the natural environment is nothing new, and archaeologists can contribute a 
lot by showing its effects.

Archaeological 
Fieldwork: The 
Adventure Begins!

 In this part . . .
T
he heart and soul of archaeology is fieldwork. In 
Chapter 5, I get you ready by spelling out the equip-
ment and knowledge you need. Chapter 6 describes how 
to find sites and know where to dig. In Chapter 7, I ask and 
answer questions about why you’re digging in the first 
place before delving into the logistics and daily labor of 
excavation. Finally, Chapter 8 explores archaeological 
ethics in the field.

Chapter 5
Supplies and Equipment 
You Need
In This Chapter
 Filling your archaeology field pack
 Making sure you have what you need for the dig in general
 Having the right knowledge and attitude before you go
M
any (often unusual) kinds of supplies and equipment are necessary 
for a proper excavation, and this chapter covers them all. You may 
have small tools, big earth-moving machines, or cases of toilet paper for the 
outhouse! Each fieldworker brings some items personally, and the director 
brings some as part of the larger inventory of excavation and recording 
equipment. Different projects have different requirements, depending on 
where you are in the world, who’s in charge, and what the field conditions 
are. The most important thing to bring is a mellow attitude. The dig will be 
much more rewarding if you take everything that happens (no matter how 
awful) as just part of the adventure!
What to Pack for Fieldwork
The field or project director usually gives you a list of what to bring. Most 
projects expect you to have a field pack for your own belongings, hand tools, 
and notebook.
 
All the stuff you bring on a dig stands a good chance of getting damaged or 
destroyed, so start with a good, sturdy — but perhaps not new — pack. Used 
military packs of heavy cotton canvas are great, though I always buy a ballistic-
nylon bag in a bright color so I can see where I set it in the woods.

68
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
Digging and recording supplies
Ask what hand tools are supplied or whether you need to buy some for your-
self. Here are typical excavation tools in an archaeological fieldworker’s pack:
 
 Pointed 4-inch Marshalltown trowel (and maybe a square one too)
 
 3-meter measuring tape (harder to find than inches-and-feet 
increments) or other small tape
 
 Butter knife, grapefruit or regular spoon, pocketknife, artist’s spatula 
and dental pick (ask your dentist for old or broken ones)
 
 Sharpened wooden chopstick or length of bamboo for softer digging
 
 Small, cheap paintbrush
 
 Roll of plastic flagging in a bright color
 
 Water-resistant field notebook (check dig requirements)
 
 Compass (cheap or expensive)
 
 Pencils, waterproof markers, waterproof pens, and/or space pen
 
 Line level for measuring depths from a level string
 
 Zipper-lock plastic bags of all sizes for finds
Color Figure 4 shows many of these items, including the yellow waterproof 
(surveyor’s) notebook. If you buy them, put your name on them in water-
proof marker. I often paint my tools (like trowel handles) a bright color so I 
can find them if they get dropped. Most U.S. archaeologists use the well-made 
Marshalltown brand of trowel, originally intended for bricklaying.
Other hand tools for fine excavation are sculptors’ paint and clay spatulas 
(like mini-trowels). Old butter knives and grapefruit spoons, sharpened 
chopsticks, and dental picks are all handy for close work. Many such tools 
are available from specialty archaeology supply companies, or forestry-, 
scientific-, or surveying-equipment companies.
For recording, you usually want waterproof writing implements. The space 
pen (invented for astronauts) uses pressurized ink and writes on wet paper 
and upside down. It’s now widely available in cheap (and expensive) 
varieties.

69
 Chapter 5: Supplies and Equipment You Need
Safety and health items
All fieldwork should have safety rules, a field first-aid kit, and persons skilled 
in medical assistance. But bring basic supplies like aspirin or bandages. I’ve 
never heard of any archaeological project that didn’t have one or more of the 
following: sharp metal tools, bugs, excessive sun, poison ivy, stinging nettles, 
occasional bad weather, heavy physical work, and lots of dirt.
Here’s a list of items relating to health and safety that you may want to have 
on hand; you can see some of them in Color Figure 4:
 
 Refillable canteen or water bottle
 
 Bandages and a small bottle of iodine or tube of antibiotic cream
 
 Prescription medicines, clearly labeled
 
 Sunblock lotion, insect repellent and something for bites/stings
 
 Aspirin, anti-diarrheal medicine, and sore muscle liniment
 
 Toilet paper and antibacterial hand cleaner
 
 Emergency food (like a granola bar and a small bag of peanuts)
 
 Tweezers for removing slivers and stings (and unruly eyebrows)
 
 Small flashlight, waterproof matches, work gloves
Your dig leader will probably advise getting a tetanus shot (or other immuni-
zations) before you go. Timing is important; the tetanus shot lasts ten years, 
but it makes your arm sore for days, so do it early.
Water
Water may be provided, but you usually want your own canteen or bottle as 
well. Using a refillable container is better for the planet, and you may want 
to buy an unbreakable, insulated wide-mouth bottle with a carry strap (write 
your name on it!) so you can have cold water and even ice cubes for an 
emergency such as a swelling bruise or a sting. On some digs water is scarce 
and so kept for drinking only, not washing.
Bug repellents and remedies
Insect repellent never repels all the bugs, but you can find many remedies 
for stings and bites. Besides commercial ones, you can use tobacco or meat 
tenderizer, which has an enzyme (papain, from the papaya plant) that 
dissolves protein the insect left in you. But don’t get it in your eyes — it’ll 
dissolve your cornea, too. Rub either of these treatments in with water (or 
spit) for a little relief.

70
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
Bathroom needs
Sanitary conditions differ from project to project. You may have a modern 
bathroom or an outhouse. Or you may just be out in the woods and expected 
to go behind the nearest bush. If this is the case, remember to bring your 
shovel and bury your waste (seriously). A good book (whose title my editors 
have censored), How to Sh** in the Woods, gives additional pointers on this 
topic.
 
Your field pack should have toilet paper, just in case. Flatten a partial roll and 
shove it into a sealed plastic bag— much better than using those nice green 
leaves that may be poison ivy!
Living conditions
Your living conditions depend upon the project. You may need to bring 
bedding for the bunkhouse, a lantern for the campground, or towels and soap. 
Avoid scented soap because it attracts bugs. Forget nice clothing (except for 
after hours) because it’ll get wrecked. Leave at home personal items that can 
get lost or damaged. On the other hand, used paperbacks or even a guitar or 
other such entertainment are often welcome at the field house.
 
If you’re physically disabled, you’re not necessarily excluded from 
archaeological work. I’ve had fieldworkers who were hard-of-hearing, 
visually impaired, and even a guy with no hands! Some of the labor is 
writing, measuring, and fine digging. Children who can’t do precise work 
can screen soils for finds or help take soil samples. They can even backfill 
at the end when you’re just throwing the dirt back into the hole. Some field 
projects have included mentally disabled youth groups and the elderly. 
You can work out accommodation in advance. A small fold-up camp stool 
is useful if you can’t sit on the ground, or a kneeling pad may help you dig 
more comfortably.
Personal needs
Your needs and habits dictate what else you should bring. Include 
gum, mints, lip balm, safety pins, wallet and ID, sunglasses, hand lotion 
(unscented), facial tissue or handkerchiefs, or whatever’s usually in your 
pocket or purse. Women can look good in the field, so makeup is usually 
okay (but mascara should be waterproof!). Women should also remember 
menstrual supplies; keep them clean in a sealed plastic bag. When the field 
season begins, I put most of my purse contents into my field pack.
If you use an MP3 player or other personal listening device, be sure to ask 
whether it’s acceptable; you may miss important directions as you dig. Also, 
expect that it will get covered with dirt. If you smoke, ask about the dig’s 
smoking rules; expect to put out cigarettes on the bottom of your boot and 
then pocket the butts to throw away later.

71
 Chapter 5: Supplies and Equipment You Need
Have something to read (yes, sealed in a plastic bag) in case you have to sit 
around waiting (for the rain to stop or the director to show up). You can also 
use that time to catch up on field notes or to socialize with the crew.
Dress requirements
Your project will usually recommend what to wear. Work gloves (not the garden 
kind — they don’t last) are good, and a hat. (I use a bandanna to protect my hair 
from spider webs and branches.) I always require long pants and sturdy boots 
with steel insteps for shoveling. Some digs forbid heavy boot soles that leave a 
deep imprint in the soil. For other digs in soft sand and open air, shorts and 
thinner shoes are acceptable. A summer dig in the forested eastern U.S. often 
means wall-to-wall poison ivy, so long-sleeved shirts and gloves are a must.
 
Don’t forget rain gear, even a 99-cent plastic rain poncho. (The day you 
forget it, rain will come!) You may want your own camera and personal 
journal/notebook (also labeled with your name and in waterproof 
containers).
 
If you buy new boots for a dig, break them in first by wearing them around 
the house or on short walks. Otherwise, your feet will hurt, which is the last 
thing you need during a dig.
Here’s a list of items you usually should not bring:
 
 Firearms, other weapons, or illegal drugs
 
 Valuables such as fancy jewelry
 
 Perfumes or scented soaps or lotions — they attract even more bugs.
 
 Nylon, polyester, or other synthetic clothing if you’re in a hot area
Equipment for the Survey or Dig
Field equipment depends on the project: whether it’s survey (looking for 
sites) or excavation at one site, where you are in the world, and other 
conditions. Chapters 6 and 7 give more details on survey and excavation, 
respectively; here I summarize the tools you generally have provided on a 
project.

72
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
Supplies for recording everything you find
You want paper records even if field-rugged laptop computers and other 
electronic devices are available. (Batteries never die on a pencil and paper!) 
You’ll probably have an official field notebook to write down how much you 
dig, what you find, and other information. You may draw finds on graph 
paper, perhaps using a protractor and ruler to get distance and angle you’ve 
measured with tape and compass.
Then you need to fill out many forms. A form for each level (arbitrary 
vertical amount you dig — say 10 centimeters) or stratum (visible natural or 
cultural soil layer you dig) is standard. You may also need to fill out a form 
to describe the stratigraphy (soil layering); another for features such as soil 
stains, house patterns, graves, or architectural fragments; and another for 
project photos. You list artifacts and other finds daily in a field log. Write the 
provenience, the information about where each find comes from, in the log 
and on the bag you put it in (using — big surprise — waterproof marker).
 
You’ll probably also use measuring devices such as a transit, or electronic 
total station and a global positioning system (GPS) device (fancy instruments 
described in Chapter 7) for mapping your site. Many instruments feed data 
into a computer right in the field. Cameras are also important for recording.
Supplies for digging
You often lay out excavation units with string and stakes. Shovels and 
trowels have been standard digging tools for centuries. Even if someone 
invented a power shovel, it would still need hands to guide it. Finer tools are 
for uncovering delicate items. For a quick sample of what the deep soil may 
contain, you can use a soil probe, coring tool, or bucket auger (discussed 
more in Chapter 6).
Ideally you expose and record each item in the ground before removing it. 
Many projects begin with shoveling up levels of soil and throwing them into a 
screen for sifting. Quarter-inch mesh is the standard screen size, with smaller 
mesh for waterscreens. With a waterscreen, you hose away the soil — which 
feels great on a hot day — and leave the artifacts. You may use a flotation 
machine, (described in Chapter 7) for finer screening of soil samples.

73
 Chapter 5: Supplies and Equipment You Need
Larger equipment
For some projects, archaeologists need larger equipment to dig. You may 
even use a heavy earth-moving machine such as a backhoe or a front-end 
loader to remove upper soils quickly, especially if you’re trying to get down 
to a deeper stratum below the topsoil. Of course, you need a careful operator 
who can take off a couple of centimeters at a time and stop before hitting that 
whole ancient pot.
To find archaeological sites or find what’s buried at a site without digging, 
you can use remote sensing methods like aerial photography, ground-
penetrating radar, or metal detectors. Even if specialists with technical 
equipment complete these tasks, you may have to help move the instruments 
around. Often these tools give you a picture of some subsurface anomaly, but 
you still have to dig to find out what it actually is. I discuss remote sensing 
more in Chapter 6.
Knowledge and Skills You Need
You want to know a few things about your archaeological project before you 
go. What are the research goals of the fieldwork? What are the local 
conditions and the geography of the region like? More than anything, you 
want to bring along a positive attitude.
Helpful knowledge and educational 
background
A basic college-level archaeology course is good to have before you do 
fieldwork; it helps you understand the general goals of looking for sites and 
digging. You also want to check out the conditions (like plants, animals, rocks, 
and weather) you can expect in the region where the project is located. You 
want to know about the local people too, and what they think of the 
archaeology. Most of all, be familiar with the aims of the field project: What 
will you be looking for? What will it look like when you find it? Ask whether 
you can read anything about previous similar field projects and the 
archaeology that’s already known in the area.
Geometry and mapmaking skills are helpful, as are outdoors experience and 
knowing how to find your way in the woods or desert or city (not to mention 
knowing how to read a map and use a compass).

74
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
Psychological requirements 
for archaeology
You may think that working outdoors, doing manual labor, remembering so 
many things to write down, and living with so much dirt may not be so bad — 
until you get that first insect bite or sore muscle.
 
Archaeology isn’t an adult version of summer camp.
When I take students to the forests of the eastern U.S. for summer fieldwork, 
I promise them they’ll itch, hurt, or both the whole time. I also point out that 
they’ll be with the same crew every day (and maybe evenings too), have 
little time to themselves, have to dig all day and do field logs or maps all 
evening, and even wait in line for the shower. My students also have to take 
turns cooking and cleaning the camp, and we often stay in tents (so it’s very 
intense.)
To appreciate an archaeological dig fully, you should be the kind of person 
who’s tolerant of physical discomfort and the foibles of others when it’s all 
for a good cause. Because the first exciting find — perhaps your first stone 
tool or piece of pottery — is usually enough to make it all worthwhile.
Bringing the best attitude for adventure
The very best thing you can bring to participate in archaeological work in the 
field, laboratory, or classroom is the eagerness and enthusiasm to carry you 
through any discomfort or annoyance. I always announce to my field crew 
that they all will get along no matter what, and nobody is allowed to whine. 
If someone has a problem, all should help (here — try my new antihistamine 
cream on that sting). When someone makes a wonderful discovery, all should 
share in it — stop their own work to exclaim over it and photograph it, laugh 
with the person who found it, and hope the team makes more such finds.
Don’t carelessly ignore safety rules and get hurt or endanger the scientific 
research of the dig. You also don’t want to act in such a way as to offend 
the local people (your hosts). Respect for the cultural resources, the finds 
and scientific techniques of the project, and the directors and crew chiefs is 
always required. If you’re not sure what to do, or think you’ve made a 
mistake, always ask for help so you don’t compromise the project records 
and finds.
Take the attitude that you’re fine regardless of what happens, and that every-
thing is part of the adventure. You never know what you may find or what 
may happen next, but you’ll certainly end up having fun!

Chapter 6
Archaeological Survey: 
Finding Where to Dig
In This Chapter
 Planning and background for archaeological survey
 Conducting your field survey
 Reporting your findings
I
n this chapter you get the answer to the perennial question asked of 
archaeologists: How do you know where to dig? Archaeological survey 
(discovering archaeological sites) is usually the first step in fieldwork. You 
first find sites and gather information and artifacts from them using little or 
no excavation before seeing what’s important in a whole region.
What Is a Survey?
Often, your goal is to find out where sites are located in an area that no one 
has examined. But you can’t just stick your shovel in the ground anywhere 
and expect to find artifacts. Though humans have probably walked over 
every square inch of land on Earth, they’ve chosen only particular places to 
live and conduct other activities. These choices are based on certain 
characteristics — like landforms, water, and other resource availability — 
that you need to know in order to do a better job in archaeological survey.
Survey is the searching for archaeological sites within a specific project area. 
You usually use multiple methods of background work combined with on-the-
ground fieldwork.
Archaeological survey expeditions may target particular sites known (or 
suspected) from historic sources, or they may aim to test hypotheses about 
the kinds of places past people preferred to live, such as high ground near 
water. Here are some examples of typical kinds of surveys:

76
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
 
 You may be doing contract archaeology in a 30,000-acre proposed 
reservoir area or a 100-acre planned housing development. You work 
within specific boundaries and a tight schedule so your client (the 
government, a development company) can fulfill the legal regulations 
before construction begins.
 
 You may have a general research program to explore prehistoric 
settlement in a geographic region that has caught your interest. Here 
you can work at your own pace more freely across the landscape.
 
 Maybe you’re searching for a particular site, say, a lost 19th-century 
town, so you search around the area shown on old maps.
 
Most archaeology done today is survey — locating sites in the path of some 
proposed construction or other land disturbance. Many laws require that 
cultural resources (archaeological and historic sites) be examined before 
earth-moving takes place. Usually, survey is necessary just to find out what’s 
there. Then you need to see whether what’s there is significant and worth 
saving. Before the highway, housing development, or reservoir is built, the 
cultural resources must be found, inventoried, and evaluated. In the U.S., even 
projects on private land may require this step if the proposed project is big 
enough (as defined by applicable laws) to affect the whole community.
Doing Background Work for 
Archaeological Survey
Before you begin an archaeological survey, you need to know both the 
reasons for and the rules of the survey. You also need to know the goals and 
requirements, which generally depend either on who’s paying for the project 
or your own research aims. Before you do the fieldwork, you need to see 
what’s already known about your project area.
Documentary sources
Written materials describing archaeological and historic sites on your project 
area land may be located in many places:
 
 Government offices can be gold mines with official site records, reports 
of earlier regional surveys and archaeological investigations, old maps, 
soil surveys, and land records. These documents may show settlements, 
mounds, or ruins no longer visible.
 
 If you’re headed to the library (university or city), see if you can get 
your hands on a Sanborn map, which can help you relocate historic 
buildings in urban areas. The Sanborn Company provided fire insurance 

77
 Chapter 6: Archaeological Survey: Finding Where to Dig
since the mid-19th century in the U.S., so it had maps of every building 
for many successive years. You can see how newer buildings covered 
“footprints” of older buildings. The town hall may also have these maps, 
and similar maps are sometimes available outside the U.S.
 
 Be sure to check out even the small local library and/or historical society. 
They may have historic accounts by the first residents or travelers that 
can provide clues to both prehistoric sites (mounds, pueblos, or other 
ruins) and historic places.
 
 You can also find a great deal of historic information from Internet maps 
and images.
Oral history and local informants
Anthropologists call people who help them learn the local culture their 
informants. Archaeologists’ informants are usually residents who know the 
region and can help find sites (and have already found sites). Sometimes 
they’re from descendant communities whose ancestors’ sites you’re trying to 
find (and with whom you always communicate to do proper, ethical survey).
Here are some places you can find good archaeological informants and 
resource people for your survey area:
 
 Local archaeology societies and artifact collectors always know where 
sites are. They may share their data and allow you to photograph their 
finds; you may have to assure them you’re interested only in learning.
 
 Historical associations at local museums or libraries collect a great deal 
of information not only on historic sites but also prehistoric ones. They 
can also tell you which local experts to call.
Archaeological survey: Expect the unexpected!
Archaeologists are known for their can-do 
attitude and ingenuity in dealing with 
unexpected situations. This image is often true 
on survey, where you never know what you’ll 
find. For example, you always need permission 
to be on people’s land looking for artifacts or 
talking with them about where sites may be. But 
be sure you know whose responsibility getting 
that permission is. Once I surveyed the corridor 
of a proposed state highway that local residents 
didn’t want crossing their lands. I thought the 
state (New York) had gotten permissions in 
advance — but no. I had to persuade unhappy 
landowners to let my crew walk their cornfields 
looking for stone tools and ancient pottery 
sherds. One farmer met me at the door with a 
shotgun! I finally persuaded him we were on 
his side, and that finding something important 
may help move the highway away from his land 
(although in the long run, we didn’t find any sites 
on his 100 acres).

78
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
 
 Foresters, loggers, land managers, surveyors, farmers, ranchers — 
anyone who works outdoors — all know the landscape and may be 
artifact collectors themselves.
 
 Elderly residents of an area are often fountains of knowledge about both 
historic and prehistoric sites. By interviewing them (collecting oral 
histories), you can also find out things not obvious from the archaeo-
logical record, like how more recent historic sites were used. (See how 
interviewing an old-timer helped my quest for a lost mound in Chapter 
4.) Such people are often happy to discuss the past and how their lives 
used to be with someone who is really interested in documenting it.
 
 Flea markets and other local hangouts for people interested in old things 
are great places to ask for names of collectors. In one small town in the 
U.S. Southeast, my student crew and I got names from the ladies working at 
the ice cream shop where everyone sat around and shared local gossip.
 
Once I was surveying an old ranch that was to become an office park. As my 
crew and I twisted and pushed a hand-corer into the top of a hill that looked 
like a prehistoric Indian mound, the old ranch foreman drove by and stopped 
to say hi. He told us he’d pushed that dirt up into that mound himself while 
clearing to build the road and barn nearly 50 years ago! That certainly saved 
us some heavy labor, but if we’d found and talked to him first, we could have 
saved a lot more work.
Remote sensing and geographic 
information systems (GIS)
Remote sensing means you look for objects from afar with sophisticated 
technology. It’s a lot like using the sensors on Star Trek to find out what’s 
out there before you actually go out and see! A geographic information system 
(GIS) is a fancy computer database with layers of all your spatial information. 
It shows where sites may be and what kinds of places people chose to live.
Remote sensing methods
Instruments used in remote sensing can detect hidden buildings in the jungle, 
patterns of buried structures (like canals, roads, and walls), or even ancient 
living areas and middens (old garbage piles). Human waste may make crops 
or other vegetation cover grow better (or worse). With remote sensing, you 
can “see” what’s under the ground without having to do the work of walking 
and digging (though the technical devices may be more expensive).
First, of course, you look at your maps — old and new, however many kinds 
you can find. The elevations or availability of water or other characteristics 
may make you suspect the presence of an archaeological site in certain spots 
on the map. Then you can check these spots on remote sensing images.

79
 Chapter 6: Archaeological Survey: Finding Where to Dig
 
Here’s a list of some remote sensing methods:
 
 Aerial photography has been used since World War I, when low-altitude 
flyers noticed interesting stuff on the landscape below. You can buy 
photos, get them free on different databases, or hire a plane (or hot-air 
balloon) and take them yourself. Even famous aviator Charles Lindbergh 
did aerial archaeological survey in the southwestern U.S. in 1929 and 
Central America in the 1930s. His wife, author Anne Morrow Lindbergh, 
leaned out of the plane and took pictures of ruins. (Well, they landed to 
take pictures too).
 
 Infrared aerial photography uses non-visible parts of the light 
spectrum. It can show patterns invisible to normal photography.
 
 Radar systems used from space can penetrate clouds, jungle, or sand to 
give images far different from photographs. The driest place on earth, 
the Sahara desert, is just monotone sand in photographs. But in radar 
imagery, it’s crisscrossed with branched forms — old channels cut by 
running water in the wetter, remote past.
 
 Proton magnetometers depend on slight differences in magnetism to 
locate anomalies, especially metal objects. They’re most used for under-
water survey and spotting shipwrecks or other submerged features.
 
 Satellite imagery (whether purchased or free from a Web site) is 
multispectral — it sees what your eyes can’t. So you can see anomalies 
that may be buried cultural features.
Although geophysical survey methods done for remote sensing may be 
difficult to learn, they’re useful, powerful tools. However, you still have to go 
out and see what’s actually out there! That zigzag anomaly on your screen 
or printout may be a lost wreck of a historic steamboat, but it also may be 
someone’s old refrigerator or Grandma’s discarded Model-T!
Remote sensing is a rapidly growing area of archaeological research (and see 
Chapter 7 for additional techniques used right on the archaeological site). 
Most of the technology was pioneered by the military to see what the enemy 
had on the ground, but it’s now widely available to scientists or anyone for 
more-peaceful uses. Even GPS receivers are now more accurate since the U.S. 
military unscrambled the satellite signals, and the images from space keep 
improving. The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
now even has its own archaeology division!
Geographic information systems
A geographic information system (GIS) is a computerized set of different 
“layers” of data. For example, you may have a GIS with separate layers 
for your site’s water sources, elevations, vegetation types, bedrock, and 
archaeological sites you’ve already found out about. All the layers are then 
georeferenced, or tied into the map with exact coordinates.

80
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
When you overlay these different layers onto the map, you see interesting 
patterns to guide your survey. For example, all the earliest prehistoric sites 
may cluster along one stream or over one type of bedrock. You then go to 
those areas to see whether you can find any more such sites. You can even 
overlay the modern road system layer to get directions on how to get there.
GIS applications include lots of complicated computer modeling and 
hypothesis testing. In the previous example, you may hypothesize that the 
archaeological sites were quarries where people got raw material for stone 
tools from surface outcrops of that bedrock. They lived along and used the 
stream because it was easier to carry that heavy rock in a boat!
GIS techniques may take a while to master, but they get faster every year 
with new software and hardware. And using computers is much faster than 
manually coloring in squares on sheets of sheer graph paper overlaid on 
top of your maps to get different GIS layers (and yes, some archaeologists 
actually used to do this)!
 
Be careful you don’t get so tied up in the technology that you forget you’re 
looking for clues on human behavior in the past! A danger with using remote 
sensing and GIS is that the end goal may become mastering the equipment and 
expertise or producing awesome maps rather than answering archaeological 
questions. Remote sensing, other instrumentation, and GIS are just the begin-
ning, never the end product. They’re archaeological tools, just like a shovel.
How do you know where you are?
This is always a great question on archaeologi-
cal survey (as in life). Reading maps that haven’t 
been updated in years can get an archaeolo-
gist quite lost! You can start at a known place 
on the map and pace or measure with a long 
tape an exact distance, taking the direction 
with your compass. Or you can aim to walk to 
other landmarks on the map — but then they 
may be ambiguous, or gone. Or you can use 
a global positioning system (GPS) device that 
bounces signals off satellites to pinpoint your 
location. Accuracy depends on how much you 
pay for the GPS unit; a hand-held device costing 
$100 should get you within 100 feet or better. 
A multi-thousand-dollar unit with other fancy 
features will have accuracy to within a couple 
of inches.
You can put a dot on your map to show your 
(or your site’s) location. You probably also want 
numerical coordinates from your map or GPS 
receiver. You can measure these coordinates 
in degrees, minutes, and seconds of latitude 
and longitude, but most archaeologists use 
UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordi-
nates. Sixteenth-century Flemish geographer 
Gerardus Mercator first thought up this system 
of measuring a round globe (like the Earth) on a 
flat surface. UTM coordinates are measured in 
meters and given in northing and easting num-
bers within zones on a grid covering the earth.
As you do field survey, you can plug your GPS 
unit into the computer and get the site locations 
you’ve recorded put onto a GIS layer. But even 
with fancy electronic devices, you still need a 
map. The batteries never die on a map!

81
 Chapter 6: Archaeological Survey: Finding Where to Dig
Preparing for Archaeological Fieldwork
After your background work is finished (or at least well underway), you can 
begin to plan the field survey. Besides getting a good crew and equipment, 
you want to plan for any specific conditions you may encounter.
Assembling a crew and assessing 
field conditions
 
A good field crew makes all the difference. Because archaeology is hard work, 
the crew must have good knowledge and attitudes. (For more on proper field 
knowledge and mindset, head to Chapter 5.)
The perfect crew
You want to have people whose skills complement one another and who’ve 
already helped plan the work. If you’re a perfect crew member, you know 
car engine mechanics, computers, mapmaking, emergency medicine, writing 
and precision note-taking, photography and videotaping, historical methods, 
outdoor basics, social graces, and ethnographic methods (to interview local 
people and get information on landscapes and sites). And you have a 
charming and mellow personality and love physical labor in the hot sun or 
biting cold (or biting flies — all part of the adventure).
Field conditions
You have to try to anticipate field conditions, from weather to the kinds 
of finds you may discover. If it’s the rainy season, bring your plastic rain 
poncho. (Actually, bring several cheap ones because they’ll get torn up by 
the tree branches or shovels.) If you’re near wetlands and expect to find 
waterlogged artifacts, you need closed containers to keep them wet until 
they can be stabilized. If you’re going to be far from town, get enough food 
and water for the day and know how far the nearest hospital is. Always bring 
enough toilet paper for woods, outhouses, and even gas station restrooms!
 
Field safety is crucial: Every project needs a first-aid kit, directions to the 
nearest emergency room, and a safety plan with rules and procedures!
 
Wherever you are, find the nearest coffee shop, ice cream parlor, local bar, or 
other hangout. It’ll be a great source of both relief and knowledge. Not only 
can the crew get refreshment at the end of a rough day, but you also attract 
the attention of the local people. When they see you’re so dirty and your truck 
says “archaeology,” they often start telling you about their artifacts and sites 
they’ve found themselves!

82
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
Gathering survey equipment 
In Chapter 5, I describe equipment and supplies you need in your individual 
field pack. The survey team will need even more stuff for general use. Some 
projects have a toolbox or a whole truck neatly packed for each crew (because 
different crews may cover different areas). Other teams have shovels and other 
tools loose and rattling around the vehicle every time it hits a bump.
Much of your equipment depends on the type of survey and geographical 
location. Here’s a list of some typical survey crew equipment:
 
 Shovels, trowels, coring tools, augers, finer digging equipment, and 
screens (usually quarter-inch mesh) for digging and sifting.
 
 Colorful flagging tape, pin flags, or other tags for marking the locations 
of finds so you can easily return to them after lunch.
 
 Machetes for clearing forest paths and root cutters for the obstructing 
branches or vines.
 
 Multiple copies of maps and directions for finding your way around; 
have one set laminated or waterproofed just in case.
 
 Measuring tapes, rulers, compasses, graph paper, and clipboards for 
sketching maps, drawing finds, and recording locations on maps. You 
also may want GPS units and laptop computers (with extra batteries) to 
record coordinates of finds and enter data as soon as possible; another 
option is waterproof notebooks and pens (which never need batteries).
 
 A Munsell color book helps you record soil colors by matching them to 
very precise, numbered color chips (but this job is probably best left to 
someone who’s not colorblind).
 
 Waterproof markers, plastic bags, and magnifying glasses for marking, 
inspecting, and storing finds. Sturdier containers such as plastic vials or 
old film canisters are good for fragile items.
 
 Special forms for recording various operations like individual cores 
or shovel tests or daily worker hours. Each project may have different 
types of forms.
 
 First-aid kit, insect repellent (and remedies for after they bite you 
anyway), sunblock, rain gear, extra work gloves and sun hats, long-
sleeved shirts, or mosquito head-nets for protecting the crew from the 
elements.
 
 Water and food for keeping the crew from keeling over. A big cooler 
keeps water cold and allows refilling of individual canteens.
 
 Copies of all paperwork, official identification, and permissions for 
assuring landowners (and the local sheriff) that you’ve been okayed to 
walk on the land and dig.

83
 Chapter 6: Archaeological Survey: Finding Where to Dig
 
 Reliable vehicles for transporting the crew to and around the project 
area. These may include sturdy cars, trucks, 4-wheel-drive vehicles, a 
boat and trailer, all-terrain vehicles, or whatever else is called for by the 
situation.
 
 Basic tools for carpentry, mechanics, and equipment repair. These 
supplies can include anything from a toolbox for helping in vehicle 
breakdowns to files for keeping shovels and trowels sharp to duct tape 
and lubricating oil (which always come in handy for various purposes).
Using what’s already known 
to plan field survey
Your survey goals help you plan each day’s work. You want to complete 
inspection of the project area in the allotted time, so you may aim to cover 
so many acres or target zones per day. If sites are already recorded on your 
map, you want to field-check them to see whether they’re still there, or to 
get an idea of what typical artifacts and site locations look like. If you have 
different types of terrain, you may do the difficult places (thick forests, high 
plateaus to climb) first. Or you may do the easy stuff first if you’re out of 
shape from sitting around the office or lab and need to get in condition for 
fieldwork!
 
Maps are the best planning devices. During background work, you should have 
which areas on the map showed good potential for having archaeological sites. 
Maps also show where disturbed ground surfaces may have exposed artifacts, 
or a historic building foundation may be present. You can see where you may 
be able to drive in and where the only access is on foot. (Or by helicopter — at 
least one archaeologist searching for Mayan sites in the jungle has done survey 
by chopper.) Land conditions (and budget) dictate whether you can drive in 
easily or need 4-wheel-drive (or a mule).
If you haven’t finished background work, days of inclement weather can be 
spent visiting the local town hall records, interviewing people, or staying 
back at the camp or field house washing artifacts (or doing laundry or 
cooking, if those services aren’t provided for you).
Doing the Field Survey
After all this planning and background work, you’re ready to go out into the 
field and make discoveries! You may be simply walking over open ground, 
inspecting the surface for artifacts. Or you may be crashing through the 
forest and digging small shovel tests to see what’s hidden below ground.

84
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
 
The most crucial point to keep in mind is that you have to take the time to 
write down your site discoveries and artifact finds on the bags, in the notes, 
on the map and forms, in the computer, and other places, too. Otherwise, 
you’re just looting!
Doing a surface investigation
Much archaeological survey consists of driving around looking for standing 
ruins or open ground where the surface is visible and you can find artifacts. 
This surface inspection is still the easiest, most common way of finding sites.
Open deserts or other exposed places are easier to survey if human activity 
left ruins still visible on the ground that you can see even from your vehicle. 
Sometimes called windshield survey this kind of quick reconnaissance can 
give you an idea of what’s there. But you really need to get out and walk 
around the sites to get more information and samples of artifacts and ecofacts 
(animal or plant remains used by people, like food garbage).
 
Where vegetation covers the ground, look for exposed places, like plowed 
fields or dirt roads. The turning of the soil unearths artifacts, and if they’ve 
been rained on they may be washed clean and sitting on little pedestals of 
dirt, waiting for you to find. But be careful of damaging crops as you walk! Ask 
farmers if they’ve already picked up certain types of artifacts, so your results 
aren’t biased by the absence of these types among your finds.
Even in pastures and forests, you can surface-collect in churned-up areas 
from cattle hooves, wild-hog rooting, or burrowing animals’ diggings. Any 
disturbed, open ground can expose artifacts or soil blackened by human use.
Doing subsurface survey
When vegetation cover (forest, jungle, or even pasture grass) prevents you 
from seeing anything on the ground surface, you’ve got to dig. Even in open 
places with surface artifacts, you want to know what else may be buried. 
Here are some of the most common subsurface survey methods.
Shovel testing
Shovel testing is the most standard method of subsurface survey. You dig 
a hole 50 centimeters (about two shovel-widths) square and up to a meter 
deep (depending on your strength, your soils, and your project require-
ments). Some crews cut corners and dig round holes — though this method 
is faster, I don’t recommend it because you can’t see the soil layers as well.

85
 Chapter 6: Archaeological Survey: Finding Where to Dig
Shovel tests are big enough to uncover a good sample of artifacts. You screen 
soils as you dig, so a two-person team — one to dig, one to screen — is good. 
A three-person team can have someone record locations, soils, and finds 
while the others dig, and the jobs can rotate. (A four-person team can have 
someone to go out for coffee or stand around and tell jokes.)
 
Shovel tests are sometimes called test pits, but this terminology is confusing 
because pit is also a term for an archaeological feature (such as an ancient 
fire pit or garbage pit). Shovel tests are also differentiated from test excavation 
units (or test units), which are for formal, more controlled (and slower) 
excavation. (See Chapter 7 for more on test excavation units.)
Coring or soil probing
Other, faster methods of digging a tiny bit use various kinds of tools available 
from forestry, engineering, or geology supply companies. Here are some of 
them:
 
 Hand augers or coring tools can go deeper than you can in shovel tests. 
I often core into the bottom of shovel tests just to make sure nothing is 
down there. You can buy 3- or 4-inch bucket augers or even use a bulb 
planter. You turn and push these tools into the soil and pull up a solid 
sample of soil (and maybe artifacts). Sometimes this process takes a lot 
of strength if you’re in clayey soils.
 
 Posthole diggers are cheap, easy to find in hardware stores, and easy to 
use. They don’t go deep but do require a lot of strength.
 
 Soil probes are usually small-diameter tubes you push into the ground 
to pull up a sample that you can see in the cut-away side of the tube. On 
the downside, they may not be able to go very deep, and depending on 
your soil, you may get them stuck in the ground and have to call 
someone stronger to pull them out.
 
 Power augers are large drills, usually gasoline-powered, with handles. 
They go down fast but are heavy, noisy, and expensive (and can be 
dangerous if you’re not hanging on). They also churn up the soil into 
bits and may break artifacts.
 
For any of these smaller subsurface exploration methods, you have to be 
careful that soil from up above isn’t falling into the bottom of the hole you’ve 
dug. You don’t want the confusion of finds from a later time period falling 
down to depths that may contain earlier, deeper materials. Often you can tell 
by color whether your soils have mixed.
 
For all subsurface sampling you do, you always need to backfill the hole! 
It’s not only the professional thing to do, but it’s also better for the safety of 
everyone (including whatever animals may come walking along). You may 
want to put the soil you dig out on top of a tarp, so that it’s easier to slide and 
dump back into the hole.

86
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
Sampling in archaeological survey
You can’t inspect and shovel-test everywhere, so you need to sample. How 
you determine where, how, and how much to take in your sample depends on 
survey conditions and goals. In some cases, whoever is requiring the survey 
may specify the kind and amount of sampling they want you to do.
Your sampling unit may be a square mile, an acre, a square on a grid that you 
establish, or even a transect (line across your project area) that you pick to 
inspect. Your sample size (how many units to examine) may depend on fancy 
mathematical calculations. But most often you determine it by how much 
time and money you have and how much space you have to cover.
Non-probabilistic or judgmental sampling
Non-probabilistic or judgmental sampling is a fancy way of saying that you 
look for archaeological sites where you think they may be, based on your 
knowledge of the area. Or it may mean looking every place that’s easily 
accessible within your time frame.
The advantages of judgmental sampling are
 
 You find a lot of sites fast.
 
 You find out about the area’s archaeology.
 
 You collect baseline data that you can build on.
The disadvantages of judgmental sampling are
 
 You won’t find any sites in unexpected areas.
 
 Your sample is biased, not necessarily representative of the whole area.
 
 Your scientific, quantitative (statistical) study may not be as accurate.
Probabilistic sampling
Probabilistic sampling means you use mathematical methods that give you 
a less biased, more representative sample. (This is how opinion polls work — 
asking only a few thousand people and projecting to the whole country.) 
Probabilistic sampling comes in three forms:
 
 Random: Every sample unit has an equal chance of being chosen. This 
kind of sampling is unbiased and easy to do: You assign numbers to 
sample units and then pick numbers randomly by computer or random 
number tables (but not by pulling numbers out of a hat — your hand 
introduces bias). Disadvantages are that the units picked may cluster 
in only one part of the project area, and that you’re not putting your 
existing knowledge of the archaeology here to good use.

87
 Chapter 6: Archaeological Survey: Finding Where to Dig
 
 Systematic: You choose sampling units at a fixed interval (such as every 
third unit). This method is great to get good coverage of a whole area, 
but it may miss archaeological sites that happen to be aligned according 
to the same system or to a smaller system. So you may systematically 
dig a shovel test every 100 meters across your area, but if typical sites 
are usually only 40 meters wide, you may miss them. Even if you dig 
every 50 meters, you may just happen to end up in the space between 
the sites.
 
 Stratified: You divide up the project area into meaningful parts (or 
strata) and then sample within each one. Three typical strata may be the 
areas around the house, next to the river, and on top of the hill. You can 
then sample within those three strata by random, systematic, or 
judgmental means.
Most archaeologists use some combination of these sampling strategies. For 
example, you may do shovel testing at 30-meter intervals in the area next 
to the river, which has a high probability for site location, and at 100-meter 
intervals in the areas farther from water, which have a lower probability for 
past human settlement. This would be a stratified systematic sample. You 
may throw in a couple of judgmentally placed shovel tests too, just to cover 
some gaps on your survey map and leave no large zones uninspected.
You need to know how to pace 30 meters or 100 meters and dig the next 
shovel test — just measure your paces and calculate how many you need. 
As you dig your tests or inspect the surface, you also put the information on 
the map, maybe by color-coding shovel tests according to whether you found 
anything in them and cross-hatching all surface-collected areas.
Record everything during archaeological survey!
You may think some information is irrelevant 
during survey, and you don’t have time to write 
everything. But you never know what may 
become important.
On one survey, I found an early 19th-century 
Creek Indian village in what was now a park. 
During surface collection, the crew got a few 
pieces of Native American pottery, chipped 
stone, and sherds of British china and black 
glass. We then dug shovel tests to look for 
undisturbed cultural deposits and to see 
whether the site had been bulldozed away 
during the construction of the park. When one 
test uncovered a feature with artifacts in it, I 
jumped in my truck to drive over to the other 
shovel-testing team with the news. The tailgate 
window was open, and when I hit a bump too 
fast, it crashed down and shattered. Good thing 
I recorded this mishap. Much later in the lab we 
found tiny squares of clear glass in two bags. I 
knew it didn’t look like 19th-century stuff, and 
the notes confirmed that these bags were open 
in the back of the truck the day the window 
broke, and bits of modern safety glass had 
flown into them.

88
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
Recording where stuff comes 
from: Provenience
 
Provenience is a crucial concept in archaeology. You may be familiar with the 
idea of the provenance of an artwork; next to the art in the museum, you see 
a little card showing the artist’s name, the materials used, what year it was 
created, and a catalog number. In archaeology, the provenience (the more 
common way of spelling it) is all that and more. It’s all the information about 
a find that may possibly be useful. Without it all your finds are scientifically 
useless, and all the work you’ve done planning and surveying is for naught. 
Keep provenience in mind in every kind of archaeology you do. That shouldn’t 
be too hard because you’ll be writing it on all your forms, notes, and bags of 
finds.
Provenience data may include
 
 The project name and institution.
 
 The name of the person recording the information and the others on the 
crew.
 
 The date, day of the week, and even the time of day (because the 
position of the sun and shadows may have influenced your finding 
something).
 
 A verbal description of the location (“on the surface of the southern end 
of the field, in the darker soil right next to a cow patty, 5 meters south of 
Smith Road and 100 meters east of its intersection with Brown Road” or 
“in Shovel Test 2, depth of 40 centimeters, in the darker soil”).
 
 Exact location coordinates from the map or GPS.
 
 The name and number of the archaeological site containing the find; you 
can make up names and provisional numbers as you go along, and then 
get official site numbers later — check out “Site numbering and naming” 
in the next section for more on this process.
 
 Any other information that seems important (“donated by Farmer 
Brown, who says he found it in the darker soil on the south end of his 
field five years ago when he was plowing,” “found in the screen,” or 
“found in the shovel test before the dirt was shoveled out and into the 
screen”).

89
 Chapter 6: Archaeological Survey: Finding Where to Dig
Recording, photographing, 
and interviewing
In archaeology, you lose what you don’t record. Your notes and records are 
probably even more important than the finds themselves; even if you lose an 
artifact, you can still study and find out about past human behavior from it if 
you have its photo and know its provenience.
 
As you locate new sites or relocate old ones, you need to write everything 
down in your own field notes, record sites on the map by number and name, 
and list your finds, sites, and other data on various forms. You also want to 
record in other media like photography and videotaping — not only the crew, 
the sites, and the finds but also the information, the sources, and the local 
people pertaining to your project.
Site numbering and naming
You may have your own numbering system for new sites that you find, but 
in most places you get official site numbers. In the U.S., the system begun by 
the U.S. National Museum (Smithsonian) and now used in every state has the 
following codes:
 
 The number of the state in alphabetical order (by the contiguous 48 
states — Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington, D.C., are 49, 50, and 51, 
respectively). So Alabama is 1, Georgia is 9, Mississippi is 22, and Ohio 
is 33.
 
 The official county abbreviation, usually the first two letters of its name. 
So Ross County, Ohio, is 33Ro, while Itawamba County, Mississippi, is 
22It. But Hocking County, Ohio, is 33Ho and Houston County, Alabama, 
is 1Ho.
 
 A number corresponding to the order in which sites are found or 
recorded in a given county. So 22It606 was recorded before 22It622.
Site names are assigned by whoever records them. You can use the name of 
the landowner or local informant, of a nearby geographical feature such as 
a lake or canyon, the original historic name, or something particular about 
the site. I’ve recorded the Yellow Flower site and the Stuck Truck site after 
memorable experiences at those places.
So 8Ja2777 may be the 2,777th recorded in Jackson County, Florida, and 
named the Smith-Brown site after both its owner and its discoverer. 8Ja2, the 
Mound near Kemp’s Landing, was found and recorded a century ago and only 
later given an official number. In the U.S., inventories of recorded sites are 
kept in State Historic Preservation Offices (SHPO), which also house those 
old maps. These offices also officially issue the site numbers for the sites 
you’ve discovered.

90
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
Site forms
The SHPO will also have the official site forms for you to record sites. Some 
states’ forms are complicated and require many pages of information and 
instructions. Many forms and directions are now online. Some states have 
simpler forms for amateur archaeologists; they’d rather amateurs file the 
easier forms than not file at all. Many states want you to complete the form 
before they will give you an official site number.
Here’s the basic information needed for an archaeological site form to record 
new sites or update the data on previously known sites:
 
 Site name, number, date of recording, and name of recorder
 
 Location, exact coordinates, description of how to get there, and 
attached map (such as a U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle map) 
showing where the site is
 
 Type and age of site, or of various components of the site
 
 Geographical setting — landform, nearest water, elevation, vegetation 
cover, soil types, and so on
 
 Sketch map or drafted map and photos of the site
 
 Names of landowners and people with collections and information from 
the site
 
 Artifacts and other finds from this site, including which ones indicate 
particular time periods or activities, and where these materials are now 
stored
 
 Significance of the site, especially in terms of the criteria specified in 
the National Register of Historic Places (the U.S. list of really important 
sites), and why you judge the site to be significant or not
 
 How you found the site and what work you did there
 
 How disturbed the site is — whether it has intact cultural deposits 
below the surface (or whether you can even tell this at all)
 
 What the site’s being used for today (and whether that can threaten the 
archaeological deposits) and what you think it was used for in the past
 
 Name of the person doing the form (if different from the one recording 
it), institutional affiliation, address, phone number, and e-mail address
 
 Titles of any reports or publications on the site (including the survey 
report on your project that you should start writing)

91
 Chapter 6: Archaeological Survey: Finding Where to Dig
Other recording tasks during survey
Some projects require you to fill out forms for each shovel test. Others 
just ask for detailed notes describing everything. Most surveys need pho-
tographs of every site found, and of the general landforms (forests or lake 
shores). Photos can help justify your survey strategy — “We couldn’t shovel 
test there because that low area was underwater at that time of year.” 
Videotaping is also useful as a way to remember everything (but you proba-
bly won’t get an award-winning film of your muddy crew, or their dialog when 
they’re tired or bug-bitten). 
Really unexpected conditions during an 
archaeological survey
Here’s a story of how I experienced really 
unexpected conditions during archaeological 
survey in the southeastern U.S. The job called 
for inspection of the banks along a big river to 
find prehistoric and historic sites that may be 
endangered by erosion. The river had a huge 
dam, and I was warned that sometimes they 
opened or closed its floodgates to generate 
electrical power. This event could of course 
affect navigation conditions, but a big warning 
horn would sound before it happened.
One cold January day, my partner and I tied 
up our little survey boat to a small branch and 
climbed up the steep bank. We proceeded to 
find lots of artifacts on the surface of a plowed 
field. It was a huge prehistoric site, and our 
packs were laden with heavy stone tools and 
potsherds. We began to climb down to get 
lunch and cameras out of the boat when we 
discovered that the floodgates had apparently 
been closed, preventing water from flowing out 
of the dam. We hadn’t heard the horn because 
we were over a mile downstream. The water 
level in the river had dropped some 15 feet, and 
our little boat was hanging vertically, dangling 
over the rock of the lower bank. Our lunch, life 
jackets, and camera had fallen out and were 
floating downstream!
My heroic partner jumped into the river to save 
the camera. Just then the little branch broke 
and the boat plunged down into the water so 
fast that it sank (we’d forgotten to plug the flota-
tion holes under the seats!). I threw him a rope 
and pulled him out. Then, as he sat drying in 
the cold winter sun, I hiked up the bank again, 
through the fields and into town (because this 
was before cellphones). I got the government 
rescue vessel to pull up our boat and tow it 
back to the ramp. It was so heavy from taking 
on water that, when we finally winched it up 
out of the river and onto the trailer, it broke the 
axle! So we had quite an equipment repair bill. 
The camera was saved, even though its water-
proof case hadn’t been closed. The film was 
wrecked, but the photo log was intact except 
for three entries that we had written in non-
waterproof ink.

92
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
Cataloguing and caring for your finds
During survey, you keep exact records of the locations of your sites and 
finds. You also list all the materials you recover (and their proveniences) in a 
field catalog (inventory), with entries for each bag of materials from each site. 
Even in the field, treat finds carefully. Artifacts take on new (and misleading) 
scratches and other characteristics if they’re rolling around in a bag together — 
they may even break! Cushion fragile items and store them in boxes. If you 
didn’t bring plastic bubble wrap, beat-up field shirts are great! Liquor stores 
have sturdy boxes (in case you ever visit those places during survey). You 
may want to wash some finds to see what they are. But never use the crew 
drinking water — you may run out and have to quit early.
 
Most important, be sure you don’t lose provenience information that goes 
with the materials. Taking a couple specimens out of different bags to 
compare them is dangerous — you need to remember which bags they came 
from. Better to write a catalog number right on the artifacts first!
Planning for adverse field situations
Field conditions and findings are predictable only so far. Different circumstances 
may require you to change techniques, adjust (or accept) problems, and/or get 
outside help. You may be denied permission to look on some land, find it takes 
longer than you thought to cover an area, or encounter various safety hazards 
(anything from dumped toxic waste to an angry bull in a pasture). Or you may 
find that much of the land is already bulldozed away and that sites that may 
have been there are destroyed. So you can quit early and stop at that coffee 
shop or bar to find out what may once have been there.
You have to be ready for any disaster or expedition mishap. Batteries 
die, equipment breaks down, and sometimes your GPS (and emergency 
cellphone) won’t work because satellite signals aren’t picked up in thick 
forest. Serious injuries can happen, too, so have a safety plan before you go! 
Remember, the sites, artifacts, and evidence of the human past are valuable, 
but they’re not worth getting hurt or seriously injured for. (But tired and sore 
are okay.)
Deciding when to get outside help
Certain finds require additional expertise. Standing historic structures or 
ruins may be best interpreted by an architectural historian. Conservation 
specialists can stabilize fragile artifacts. Those local people may be helpful 
enough to show you where things were or rescue you when your vehicle 

93
 Chapter 6: Archaeological Survey: Finding Where to Dig
breaks down! If they’re descendants, they may even interpret your historic 
artifacts because they know what their great-grandparents used them for.
Specialized surveys require particular additional work (and jargon). For 
example, surveying the small squares of land where cellphone towers are to 
be built means surface inspection and possibly shovel testing. But you also 
have to evaluate the viewshed. This urban-planning term means how the 
proposed tower will affect what you can see — whether its construction will 
interrupt the scenic or historical value of the landscape.
Writing Up Your Survey Findings
So you’ve walked plowed fields and roads, driven all over the place, and 
come back from the field with many boxes of great finds and piles of paper-
work and computer data. Now it’s time to put it all together and see what you 
have and how it answers the original questions guiding your survey.
 
Before you even write up your results, remember that laboratory work and 
processing and interpreting finds and data always require much more time 
than it took to find everything. I discuss lab work more in Part III.
Writing what you’ve found
Your survey may or may not have a specific deadline and report guidelines, 
but it always covers everything you’ve done and found. Here’s a list of what’s 
usually in your report or other written product:
 
 The survey goals, requirements, and why you did the work
 
 The environmental background (current and past environments, if 
possible) of your project area, including maps and maybe a GIS data-
base (which I discuss in the section “Remote sensing and geographic 
information systems (GIS)” earlier in this chapter)
 
 The archaeological and historical background of your project area, 
including sites that were already recorded before you began the survey
 
 Your survey strategy, methods, and techniques, including why you 
chose them and how you made decisions
 
 The sites you discovered (or previously known sites you went back to), 
everything you found at and found out about them, whether they’re 
culturally significant, how disturbed they already are, and whether they 
may be useful for further research
 
 A summary of what all your information means about human behavior in 
the past in this survey area

94
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
 
 What you recommend be done about all these prehistoric archaeological 
sites, historic sites and structures, and any other cultural resources (such 
as an old cannon you unearthed or a waterfall you discovered was sacred 
to the native people). Discovering whether cultural resources need more 
research before proposed construction or whether construction plans 
should be changed to avoid and preserve them may be the main reason 
for survey
 
 What additional research can be done here or in similar areas to 
enhance the knowledge you’ve obtained or to test hypotheses further
 
 How your findings may be interpreted to the public — local residents, 
descendant communities, and the wider audience (tourists, landmark 
commissions, schoolkids, prospective buyers of homes in the proposed 
housing development — the possibilities are endless)
Making a contribution to archaeological 
knowledge
No matter what the size of the archaeological survey or how long it takes, 
you’re ethically obliged to produce something describing your work. Mostly 
your survey report describes the settlement patterns — how archaeological 
sites you found occur over space and time. You can answer bigger ques-
tions too, like how far people had to go to get things they wanted. Did you 
find carved prehistoric seashells 500 miles inland? That’s a pretty good sign 
that trade and exchange systems extended over huge distances. You may 
even relate your findings to modern issues like whether prehistoric people 
abandoned the area or rebuilt after a hurricane or earthquake. Then you see 
whether you can relate your findings to any living people — for example, if 
you found the original homesteads of the modern residents’ ancestors.
Culture change is another aspect you can document, especially if you have 
sites and materials from different time periods. Did prehistoric farmers settle 
closer to rivers than earlier folks so that they could grow crops better there? 
Did people move away from rivers when railroads made transport faster? 
Discovering these kinds of culture changes helps you understand past human 
behavior in many different ways.
Finally, you want to write the results of testing your ideas about the human 
past and new hypotheses for future surveys to investigate. 
 
Your report will be the only record of many of the archaeological sites you 
write about before they’re destroyed, so write up well what you do find!

Chapter 7
The Archaeological Dig
In This Chapter
 Assessing your reasons for digging
 Preparing for the excavation
 Digging, screening, and recording
I
n Chapter 6, I showed you how to know where to dig — how to find 
archaeological sites. In Chapter 5 you saw a list of everything you need to 
bring along and how to prepare for fieldwork. Now it’s time to dig!
You can’t just start throwing dirt around, however; you need detailed 
procedures and techniques. This chapter describes how you plan and carry 
out an archaeological excavation.
Questions to Ask Before You Dig
Before you dig, you have to make sure you’re doing it for the right reasons, in 
the right places, and for the right kinds of results.
Does your reason for digging justify 
destroying the site?
 
The first important issue is your reason for digging. Archaeological excavation, 
by its very nature, obliterates the cultural remains you want to study — 
digging means destroying! It’s very much like taking a medical biopsy from your 
body. If you’re going to slice off a piece of flesh to examine, you’d better be 
able to justify such a barbaric and invasive practice.
If your site is going to be bulldozed in the path of some construction anyway, 
you want to get all the information you can for the amount of time, money, 
and labor you have available. But if your site is protected — for example, in a 
public park — you need a good explanation for why you want to disturb it.

96
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
So why are you digging?
You have many kinds of goals for your dig. Some are similar to what you’re 
looking for when you do archaeological survey (detailed in Chapter 6), but 
some specific to one site only. Then you also have the lofty theoretical goals 
of social science (as I detail more in Chapter 11). A few examples of these 
types of excavation goals, moving from specific to general, include
 
 Recovering certain kinds of remains or exposing one area of the site to 
understand it
 
 Reconstructing what happened at your site in the past and when
 
 Figuring out the functions of the site and its parts
 
 Interpreting the significance of the material things you’re finding to the 
original people who made and used them
 
 Understanding the processes of change or stability at your particular 
site and in the general region
Have you organized your research?
For any excavation, you want to know in advance what you’re looking for. 
Of course, you’ll probably find other things you weren’t looking for — that’s 
part of the adventure of archaeology! So anticipate the unexpected as well.
When you plan a dig, it’s different from planning, say, construction. For a 
building, you can estimate how many board-feet of lumber you need, how 
many boxes of nails, roof shingles, doors, and so forth. Even then, you run 
into unexpected circumstances like weather and wastage. But you have a 
drawing of the building and know what the finished product is supposed to 
be. Archaeological digs are even harder to plan because you never know 
what you’ll find, and the circumstances may change in mid-project when you 
unearth far more complex remains or far deeper layers than you expected.
Research design
Before you dig, you need to write a research design or plan for your work. It 
should include the following:
 
 The research questions and goals of the investigation (what kinds of 
things you hope to discover about the human past)
 
 Verification that you got the required permits from governments or 
permission from landowners to do the dig
 
 What procedures you’ll use
 
 How much you’ll dig and with what methods, crew size, and equipment

97
 Chapter 7: The Archaeological Dig
 
 What results you expect, and what you’ll do if you encounter anything 
unexpected
 
 How you’ll treat the finds and information you recover
 
 What will happen to the site after the dig
 
 What analyses you’ll do of the whole project and materials
 
 What kind of reports you’ll write and for whom
 
 Where and how the materials you excavate and notes and records will 
be stored for any future researchers or other interested people
Research questions
Your research questions can be numerous and are often based on what you 
already know. Here are some examples:
 
 You may be looking for basics to identify the site — how old it is, what 
kinds of remains it may have, and whether any of it is still undisturbed.
 
 If you know about a part of the site already, you may want to find other 
parts. For example, you’ve got the pyramid or palace, so now you want 
to find where and how the common people lived.
 
 You may be seeking a specific detail — like charcoal for dating or animal 
and plant remains for reconstructing environment and subsistence.
 
 You may need particular materials or data to test your hypothesis. For 
example, you may target finding many different types of stone artifacts 
to analyze their raw materials. Then you can see whether they were 
made in the same place or came from different places. Your research 
goal is to trace trade and interaction between different societies across 
the landscape.
 
 At historic sites, you may be looking for findings that support or refute your 
historic hypothesis that, say, a foundation represents the home of a known 
person or that people’s lives were different from written descriptions.
Are you doing test excavation or 
larger-scale data recovery?
Test digs use smaller excavation units (maybe 1-x-1-meter squares or a single 
trench) just to see whether the site contains interesting and undisturbed cultural 
deposits. Here I’ll use the terminology of cultural resources management 
archaeology (CRM) because it’s the most common today; see discussions of 
CRM in Chapter 3. In the CRM lingo, test excavation is Phase II, a limited amount 
of digging. After doing survey (Phase I) to locate sites, you may test a few that 
look promising to see whether they’re significant enough to merit further work, 
especially if they’re scheduled to be destroyed.

98
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
Outside the CRM world, you may test a few different sites to get an idea of 
the archaeology in a previously unstudied region or to compare them in 
relation to specific characteristics.
Phase III is data recovery because you dig as much as you can before the 
unavoidable destruction of a site. (However, this is kind of a misnomer 
because you recover data in all stages.) You may also hear it called adverse 
impact mitigation or salvage excavation. Outside CRM, many sites are 
excavated on a larger scale just to continue pursuing old research issues and 
investigate new ones. Large excavations like this are sometimes called block 
or area excavations.
Have you considered remote sensing?
In Chapter 6, you see the benefits of using remote sensing (fancy instru-
ments and techniques that “see” below ground without digging) to find 
archaeological sites during survey. Remote sensing is useful to investigate 
individual sites you’re going to dig as well. Techniques include examination 
of aerial photographs and satellite images to see patterns on the ground 
from afar, as well as machinery and procedures you bring to your site and 
use on the ground surface. One of the latter methods is chemically testing 
soils to see which parts of the site show greater or lesser amounts of 
human activity — people always leave garbage and residues.
 
Other on-site remote sensing methods fall into the category of geophysical 
prospecting. They are techniques involving complicated instruments you move 
across your site, sometimes along a grid or multiple transects (straight lines) 
to get a picture of what’s actually there before you dig. Here are some of these 
techniques:
 
 Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) sends radar pulses into the ground 
to locate anomalies such as canals and structures; it works best in dry 
sand.
 
 Proton magnetometry and fluxgate gradiometry sense deviation from 
the earth’s magnetic field caused by buried items; they work well to find 
burned surfaces and iron objects.
 
 Metal detectors sense iron and other (but not all) metals; they’re far less 
useful at prehistoric sites where metals weren’t used yet.
 
 Electrical resistivity sends electrical currents through the soil to monitor 
different conductivity levels, which indicate buried objects; it works well 
to find rock walls, boulders, and empty spaces like canals.

99
 Chapter 7: The Archaeological Dig
Because these technologies are non-invasive, you’re not destroying part of 
your site to learn something about it. The anomalies you see in the instru-
ment’s readout may be patterns of structures such as walls or buildings or 
features (visible evidence of some specific human behavior) such as rock-
lined fire pits or burials. But for all the fancy machinery and computer 
processing, you sometimes still only see a blob or a spike in the graph that 
you can only identify by digging down to it.
The best approach is to try several remote sensing methods to see whether 
you get the same results. Then you can better determine where to dig (or 
where not to).
Are you reconstructing or restoring?
Some archaeological excavation has goals of not only finding out about 
the past but also physically duplicating it in one of two ways: restoration 
or reconstruction. Restoring what the site would have been like may mean 
picking up all the fallen bricks and columns and putting them back together 
to rebuild the temple or palace. Reconstruction may mean building a new 
structure right on top of the outline of the old one, perhaps using the same 
materials past people would’ve had available. Or maybe you dig down into 
a mound and then put it all back to show how the monument originally 
looked.
Geochemistry shows possible Maya market
Scientists investigating the Maya site of 
Chunchucmil, in Yucatan, Mexico, wondered 
how this large, bustling prehistoric center arose 
in a climate that was dry and unfavorable for 
agriculture. Testing soil chemistry revealed 
linear patterns with phosphate concentrations 
40 times higher than elsewhere across the site. 
Organic wastes (especially foods) produced by 
humans decay quickly in the tropics, leaving 
phosphorus in the ground. So archaeologists 
thought these results meant that farm crops 
were brought in from elsewhere and traded at 
a marketplace. The parallel rows of rocks at the 
site are additional evidence, indications of small 
temporary structures that may have been market 
stalls. To test their hypothesis, the researchers 
found a modern market in Guatemala that still 
had a dirt floor and examined its soils, which 
had similar concentrations of phosphates along 
the vegetable dealers’ stalls.
One model of the Classic Maya (A.D. 300 to 900) 
economy has been that farmers paid taxes or 
tribute to the ruler, who then redistributed the 
funds to everyone. This new research suggests 
food was traded for local resources in real 
markets, possibly by a class of merchants. So 
the study provides information on both ancient 
human economic systems and social/political 
organization.

100
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
Choosing reconstruction or restoration affects the way you dig. You may have 
to number bricks or building blocks to be able to put them together properly. 
Or maybe you leave features like garbage pits or burials unexcavated so people 
can see them in displays. Other times you don’t want to restore items to their 
original appearances and functions. Piles of crumbling ruins may be just as 
attractive to the public (and much cheaper to maintain).
 
Museums and governments who fund digs often desire reconstruction. They 
want people to see past glories and the historical heritage of the community. 
But reconstruction and restoration can have problems. You may have little 
idea of how those columns and bricks once went together or what color they 
were painted, so you have to be careful not to impose your own notions of 
what ancient structures were like (as some famous archaeologists have been 
criticized for doing). When you try to use original types of materials, you may 
end up violating modern building codes. Restoring buildings exactly as they 
were can also exclude tourists in wheelchairs or otherwise disabled.
Planning the Archaeological Excavation
Your preliminary planning gives you some guidelines, but you still need to 
develop your excavation schedule and needs. Don’t forget to include a few 
extra days for the project, in case you’re slowed by bad weather or equipment 
breakdowns. Because digging can be very hard labor, be sure to include lots 
of break time and days off so workers can recuperate, relax, and also visit 
other sites (and sights) in the area.
In Chapter 6, I describe the ideal type of archaeological fieldworker for 
doing survey (looking for sites). An excavator needs similar qualities — the 
willingness to work very hard and still have a mellow attitude no matter 
what difficulties arise. To dig properly, you need to be enormously pains-
taking and picky with details. You must finish all the paperwork and record-
ing for one piece of the excavation before you begin the next. It can get 
tedious because you want so badly to move all that dirt and see what’s 
there! But patience is all part of the deal.
Field conditions for excavation are similar to those described for survey 
work in Chapter 6. You need to take into account health and safety hazards 
and all other dangerous and tricky aspects of the field situation. (In Chapter 
8, I describe the archaeological, ethical, and safety standards in more detail.)
 
It takes a special person to put up with the day-to-day work of digging. You 
don’t necessarily need to be big and strong to shovel, but you do need a 
constant eye for detail and patience to do long series of repetitive small 
tasks.

101
 Chapter 7: The Archaeological Dig
Deciding how many excavations 
and how deep
Some archaeologists say you should write your research questions and then 
figure how much you think you need to dig to find your answers. But this 
amount is very hard to predict. You usually first determine how much time 
and labor you have, and that helps you figure out how much you can do!
How much to dig
The best strategy is to start with your given limitations and priorities and 
work from there. You may only have a month of summer vacation to dig, or 
only a week before the bulldozers come! Or you may be able to go back to the 
same site every season for many years. With rougher soils and more remote 
sites, or with a topnotch crew and some heavy equipment, your project can 
be slower or faster.
 
In my experience, an average crew of three or four people can dig a 1-x-2-meter 
excavation unit 1 meter deep, in 10-centimeter increments, in soft soil, in about 
two weeks (including all recording and backfilling). Of course, finding lots of 
features and artifacts, losing days to weather, or taking two-hour lunches down 
the road at that coffeehouse or bar can mess up this schedule.
Where to put excavation units
You place excavations based on what you already know or want to know. So 
if your remote sensing located anomalies that may be cultural features, you 
want to dig down to check them. Or if you have surface artifacts and want to 
find how widely the site extends, you work out horizontally from that center 
in many directions. If you have standing ruins, you may want to dig next to 
them to see what they were.
For a shallow site (or one where you want to see a wide horizontal layout), 
you can open large block units measuring many meters on a side. If your 
deposits are deeply buried, you dig deeper, but you still need wide units just 
for safety, in case your walls fall in. (You don’t want to be buried yourself 
along with the ancient remains!)
Placement of excavation units simply wherever you think they’ll turn up the 
best results is usually called a judgmental sample. All your digging is sampling 
because you never dig the whole site. The sampling strategies I describe for 
finding sites in Chapter 6 apply to placing excavation units at one site, too. So 
you can also put units randomly or systematically (according to a pattern 
you devise, like every 50 meters). You may stratify your sample (divide the 
site into meaningful chunks like domestic area, ceremonial area, garbage 
dump) and use random or systematic sampling within those areas.

102
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
Knowing when to stop
Usually you dig until you reach culturally sterile soils, meaning they have no 
more evidence of human activity. But you want to be sure you don’t have 
anything buried deeper than that. Pyramids can be constructed over other 
(smaller and smaller) pyramids. Campgrounds can be inhabited on top of 
earlier people’s camps, or even on top of buried pyramids (or vice versa). 
You want to dig to the bottom of the cultural deposits — the natural surface 
that the first people there walked on.
Sample excavation plans
Here are some sample research plans I’ve 
used in the eastern U.S.:
  At a prehistoric mound site, I had three 
weeks and a crew of ten. I wanted to 
know when the mound was built and the 
archaeological cultures that had used it, 
so I dug one unit at the base of the mound 
slope to get below its construction layers 
to the original land surface (we got char-
coal for dating and layers of piled-up soil 
from mound-building). Another unit I put 
east of the mound in what I hoped was the 
village area. We got one kind of pottery 
deeper than another, indicating two differ-
ent time periods, and also a feature (a pit) 
full of household garbage.
  To get as much as possible out of a site that 
was to be destroyed for reservoir construc-
tion over a four-week project I first assigned 
teams to pick up all surface artifacts in the 
plowed field. Then we dug a couple units 
randomly placed to see whether undis-
turbed prehistoric materials existed below 
the disturbed plow zone. When we found 
intact material, I used heavy equipment 
(a front-end loader) to scrape off the 
plow zone over a wide area. This process 
exposed features (garbage pits, postmold 
patterns from poles in the ground indicating 
structures, and even human burials), which 
we then dug out.
  At a historic site I knew was a 19th-century 
mill, I used heavy equipment to explore a 
long depression that I thought was once the 
old mill race channel. The small bulldozer 
cut across the channel and exposed its 
square, human-dug cross section. It also cut 
into the edge of a stone building foundation. 
So I stopped the machine then and excavated 
the mill building foundations by hand; I even 
found an old millstone thrown to one side.
  At a Native American campsite consisting 
of piles of shell midden (seafood debris), I 
picked one big circular pile and excavated 
a 1-x-5-meter trench through the center of 
it to get a good sample. Each 1-meter-long 
segment of the trench was dug separately 
for better control, to contrast what was in 
the center with what was at the edges. To 
see what activity was outside these garbage 
piles, I also dug a 1-x-2-meter unit in the 
sand between the shell piles. Finally, I 
trenched across another pile and found it 
to be of a different age than the first.

 Chapter 7: The Archaeological Dig
You may have to stop if you don’t have the tools to investigate something 
special, or if you expose graves of people whose descendants don’t want 
them disturbed (among other reasons). Even if you don’t get done everything 
in your research plan, you can leave some things to investigate next season 
(if there is one).
 
You usually don’t dig a whole site. Even if you have all the time and money in 
the world (which you never do), you want to save something. In the future, 
new excavation technologies unheard of today may produce new kinds of 
information. If the site is completely gone, further investigation is impossible. 
For example, U.S. diggers in the 1930s threw out animal bones and charcoal — 
after all, they were just ancient garbage! Now they can be used for dating; 
revealing environments, diets and health; and many other things.
Considering safety
Every dig should have a safety plan, safety rules, and, if necessary, a designated 
safety officer. All the crew should know the location of the first-aid kits and the 
nearest emergency medical service. Locate modern things that may already be 
underground — phone and electrical lines and water and sewer pipes. Hitting 
these can have awful consequences! I discuss more details of safety and ethics in 
Chapter 8, where I give you examples of what can go wrong at a dig.
Using Old Archaeological Technology 
and the Newest Equipment Too
Chapter 5 gives you lists of what to pack for your individual fieldwork needs, 
illustrated in Color Figure 4. Each project also has general equipment and 
supplies for digging and recording, depending upon what work you’re doing.
Basic digging tools
Some archaeological digging methods (like shoveling) haven’t changed in 
decades or even centuries. An endless variety of tools can be useful, 
depending on the kind of project and finds and soils. Here’s a list of things 
besides personal tools needed for a typical excavation:

104
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
 
 Shovels. Get enough shovels for each digger because everyone will 
need one when you backfill. Make sure they’re long-handled — forget 
the short-handled spades unless you really want a backache! I prefer 
square-bladed shovels with wooden handles for better grip, cleaner 
square walls, and chopping roots in the way. They’re also good at 
cutting sod in square slices in case you have to put the grass back on 
the site when you’re done. Round and pointed shovels are good for 
backfilling quickly but not for skimming flat floors or walls.
 
 Hand tools like trowels (pointed and square — Marshalltown brand is 
best), spatulas, spoons, knives, dental picks, ice picks, tweezers, paint 
brushes, sharpened cane or chopsticks, or bamboo skewers for finer 
digging.
 
 Picks (small and large) and mattocks (wide-bladed picks) for digging 
especially rough stuff, rocks, or compacted shell middens.
 
 Dustpans, buckets, large scoops, or even plastic gallon jugs cut into 
scoopers for removing soils you’ve just loosened.
 
 Wheelbarrows for removing large amounts of soil you’ve just dug up.
 
 Screens, preferably of different mesh sizes depending upon soils, 
expected finds, and whether you’re doing dry or waterscreening.
 
 Large heavy-duty plastic bags (trash compactor bags) or feed bags for 
soil samples.
 
 Water pump (if you’re waterscreening) with a connector system that 
can divide off pipes and hoses to go to separate screens. (Of course, 
you need a local source of water to use for this item too.) I always bring 
extra spark plugs for the water pump, which amazingly doesn’t seem to 
work if it gets a lot of water on it!
 
 Resealable plastic bags and waterproof markers for bagging and labeling 
finds; tags for finds you can’t easily contain in a bag; and tinfoil and 
plastic or glass vials for charcoal samples and small or fragile items.
 
 Clipboards, waterproof pens, pencils, paper, rulers, graph paper, and 
field notebooks with waterproof paper for recording all notes, lists of 
finds, details of excavations, photo logs, and so forth.
 
 Field forms for recording specific information like levels excavated, 
features, layering of soil strata in unit walls, burials, and house patterns. 
You also need your field catalog forms for listing bags of finds.
 
 Compass, large measuring tapes (30 to 50 meters long) and small ones 
(3 meters long), and protractors for mapping and drawing finds in place.
 
 Line levels and plumb bobs for measuring locations accurately in place 
in the unit (fishing line sinkers make great, cheap plumb bobs).
 
 String, rope, and stakes or other sturdy poles (like cut pieces of iron 
re-bar) to lay out your square or rectangular excavation units.

105
 Chapter 7: The Archaeological Dig
 
 Colored flagging tape, pin flags, or other markers to indicate finds and 
help you protect and record them.
 
 Basic tools like screwdrivers and wrenches for fixing equipment and 
files for sharpening metal edges.
 
 Chain saw, machetes, weed whips, axes and hatchets, big branch 
cutters, and/or little root clippers depending upon how much vegetation 
you expect to move out of the way.
 
 Gas and oil for the power tools and rags to clean up spills.
 
 Extra gloves, bug spray, and other personal supplies for the crew.
 
 Cameras (and even videocamera) and photo log sheets, with waterproof 
cases.
 
 First-aid kit, including directions, distance, and phone number to nearest 
emergency room and maybe even medical insurance cards of the crew 
members and their medications and allergy information.
 
 Two-way hand-held radios and hand-held or fancier GPS units.
 
 Plastic sheeting to protect equipment and excavations from rain and 
dust.
 
 Locks and chains to secure equipment to trees for security.
 
 Lots of water (with ice, for emergencies) and food.
 
 Duct tape and lubricating oil (always)!
Much of the more specialized archaeological equipment is sold by forestry 
or engineering supply companies, and you can find archaeological supply 
companies, too. Many archaeologists make their own screens using lumber, 
bolts, nuts, and hardware cloth. You can always find other useful stuff just 
by looking around. For example, metal and bamboo skewers for shish kabobs 
are useful in many excavation tasks.
 
Some equipment (even — and especially — an ax) requires training, coordina-
tion, and common sense to use. So if you’ve never used it before, ask for help! 
Otherwise, you can chop off your foot or poke your eye out.
Mapping equipment
You can choose from many different devices (in varying levels of complexity) 
to map your site. For a simple sketch map, use a compass and tape measure 
and draw it to scale on graph paper. A Brunton compass or pocket transit 
can sit on a small tripod and be leveled to give you more accurate readings.
Most digs use more sophisticated mapping equipment, like the kind you may 
have seen surveyors use for measuring the road corridor or laying out 
property boundaries. The following list gives you some examples:

106
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
 
 A transit is a mapping device consisting essentially of a telescope, a big 
compass, and a tripod to keep it all level and precise. You set it up over 
your site’s datum point, a point from which you’ll measure everything. 
Then you look through the scope at a stadia (measuring) rod, and write 
down the numbers you see and your compass (horizontal) and scope 
(vertical) angles. Simple calculations give you the distance, direction, 
and elevation of all your points. You map points around the whole 
site — features, excavation units, elevations, roads, streams, and other 
things. Then you put all the points on paper and connect the right ones 
to make your two-dimensional map.
 
 The plane table, alidade, and theodolite are similar mechanical instru-
ments that work along the same principles. A plane table gives you a 
map right there in the field instead of your having to take measurements 
back to the lab to calculate and put on paper.
 
 Total stations and other electronic versions of transits or theodolites 
are now common in archaeology. They measure the distance, direction, 
and elevation with a laser beam from an electronic distance measuring 
device (EDM). This beam is picked up by a prism target (rather than a 
stadia rod) held at the point you’re mapping. Electronic instruments are 
fast and accurate and don’t need you to clear a huge swath through the 
forest to see the rod (because the laser beam is thinner). More 
important, you can connect the data-logger to your computer and have 
it draw the map for you. The disadvantage is that these devices are 
heavy, sometimes complicated to use, and very expensive.
 
 Photogrammetry, 3-D laser scanning, and other fancy spatial technologies 
are often used for more-specialized mapping, especially of standing 
buildings and monuments, rock walls, or other ruins. The equipment 
takes photos from different angles or scans zillions of points by laser on 
solid surfaces. With these data, you can create fine three-dimensional 
images that show things not easily visible to the eye (such as shallow 
carvings on the rocks at Stonehenge). Instruments and expertise are 
very expensive here too.
Two-way hand-held radios are helpful in the mapping process. They allow 
the person behind the instrument to talk to the person holding the rod or 
laser target, though they may be far apart. You also want a plastic cover for 
the instrument because it’s severely affected by rain! Most instruments come 
with hard plastic covers, but you can drape plastic sheeting over them for 
protection and quick reuse after a brief shower.
Bigger equipment
For some projects, you need additional larger-scale equipment, such as the 
following:

107
 Chapter 7: The Archaeological Dig
 
 A dining canopy, huge umbrella, or other cover over the excavation to 
shield it from sun and rain. You can find shelters of varying quality on the 
market — keep in mind that cheaper ones may blow over. Sometimes 
you can fabricate shelters with arcs of PVC pipe, large plastic sheeting, 
and some kind of webbing or rope to hold it all down.
 
 A lockable field cupboard to store your equipment and tools in at the 
site so you don’t have to lug them home each night.
 
 Hydraulic coring machines for deep samples of your site. These monsters 
usually come on trailers and need to be driven into your site by truck or 
all-terrain vehicle.
 
 Lumber and other supplies for shoring up your trenches if you’re digging 
deeply. This precaution is certainly required for safety and may also be 
the law!
 
 Lumber and supplies for fabricating items you may need, like tables or 
even an outhouse building to provide a reasonable toilet in the field.
 
 Flotation apparatus (see “Recovering remains with flotation” later in this 
chapter) to process soil samples. (This can be done back in the lab too.)
Heavy earth-moving equipment
You may think that taking a backhoe to your site is like using a hatchet to 
remove your appendix, but big machinery saves lots of time and effort when 
used carefully. Many sites have an upper layer of modern or disturbed soils 
that you’re not interested in, so stripping this dirt quickly helps you get down 
to the good stuff. Yes, you can accidentally damage some precious remains, 
but you can do that with your shovel too.
A good equipment operator can take off very thin layers at a time and 
respond well to your hand directions as you walk beside the machine and 
look at what it’s uncovering. Earth-movers aren’t cheap to rent, and some 
archaeologists buy and learn to operate their own. The following are good 
machines to use:
 
 Front-end loader: Has an open, wide bucket to scrape off soils and pick 
them up or push them off to the side.
 
 Backhoe: Has a narrow bucket to dig quickly very deeply and give you 
an idea of how deep your site’s cultural deposits extend. It often comes 
on the same machine as the front-end loader.
 
 Scraper pan: Cuts off the soil in thin slices and removes it cleanly to 
somewhere else. The self-loading kind is the best.
 
 Hydraulic excavator: Has a telescoping arm that allows it to sit off to 
the side and dig without disturbing the cultural deposits. It’s a good 
choice for small-area stripping.

108
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
 
 Dragline: Has a huge arm and can take away lots of dirt while sitting off 
to the side. It has treads that tear up soils, though, so it isn’t great for 
large sites.
 
 Very small loader with backhoe bucket: Quickly tests sites you identify 
on survey to see whether they’re even worth further excavation.
These machines aren’t so good to use:
 
 Bulldozers with treads (rather than wheels) that gouge out the soil and with 
so much power that they lack the control to push off thin slices of soil
 
 Road graders with long vertical blades that only level and make smooth 
surfaces (whether by cutting off soil or pushing soil into depressions)
 
Whatever machinery you use, be sure to explain to the operator exactly what 
you want. (They’re used to moving lots of dirt at a time, not little bits.) And be 
sure to remove or cover the teeth on the end of the bucket or blade.
Finally! Doing the Archaeological 
Excavation
Now that you’ve got your equipment and supplies, your paperwork in order 
including permits, and your research design laid out, it’s time to dig in! Okay, 
maybe not quite — you have to do a bit of prep work on your site before you 
get to the real digging. But you’re almost there, I promise.
Setting up a dig and mapping it
Because you have to know the precise location of everything you find, your 
first step is to map your site and lay out your excavation units.
Making a site map
Establish where you want your site’s datum point, from which you map 
everything, and then set up your mapping instrument over this point. The 
datum can be in the middle of the site or at the edge; a standard practice is to 
put it outside the southwest corner of the site. That way, everything you map 
can be in terms of distances north and east of the datum (and you won’t have 
to move it if you realize something important may be under it). You also need 
to map your site datum in relation to an official marker whose exact location, 
including elevation above sea level, is known. This point can be a spot on a 
published map, or a real government survey marker on the ground.

109
 Chapter 7: The Archaeological Dig
Next you can set up a grid over the whole site with stakes and string, on paper, 
or electronically. With this system, you name excavation units in terms of the 
grid lines, choosing a corner of your unit to be the unit datum. If your site datum 
is in the southwest corner of the site, and your unit datum is its southwest 
corner, you use measurements going north and east from these points. So Test 
Unit 55E60 (named after its southwest corner) is north 55 meters and east 60 
meters from the site datum. As you dig, you measure locations of all finds in 
relation to the grid points in a similar fashion. So an artifact you uncover in Test 
Unit 55E60 may be at 55.42E60.13 if it’s 42 centimeters north and 13 centimeters 
east of the test unit’s southwest corner.
 
You can also just name units A, B, C, or 1, 2, 3 and map them directly from the 
site datum, without even using a grid. As long as you keep track of precisely 
where everything comes from, you’re doing okay!
Laying out units
After you decide where to dig and how big of an area to open, you lay out 
excavation units. Most archaeologists use string or flagging tape and stakes 
or other kinds of markers.
The top section of Figure 7-1 shows a 1-x-2-meter excavation or test unit 
(affectionately abbreviated “TU”) at a typical site. It’s laid out in cardinal 
directions (the trowel points north) with wooden stakes and string. The three 
small dark circles are prehistoric features that were measured precisely from 
the unit corners, which are drawn on the overall site map. Color Figure 1 also 
shows a unit (2 x 2 meters) with a feature.
Digging strata and levels
When you dig, you excavate in small increments, very slowly so as not to 
miss anything and to maintain good control. As you dig, you pay attention 
to the layering of soil, removing one layer at a time and numbering them 
sequentially.
A soil stratum is a layer already there in the ground. Excavation levels are 
artificially determined layers you designate. Here are some examples of these 
different layers to dig within your excavation units:
 
 Natural strata: Each different layer of soil you can see (based on color, 
texture, and contents) that formed naturally can be taken out separately. 
In the upper part of Figure 7-1 you can see the toposoil stratum and 
lighter subsoil underneath it.
 
 Cultural strata: Each layer of soil you see that contains different cultural 
contents mixed into the natural stratum, such as black soil with 
artifacts, black midden filled with shell or rock, and lighter soil with no 
artifacts between midden strata.

square test 
unit with 
features and

a cross 
section.
 

111
 Chapter 7: The Archaeological Dig
 
 Arbitrary levels: You use these levels when you can’t see soil layers 
well enough to determine where they begin and end. Make sure they’re 
a uniform thickness, such as 10 centimeters, and keep in mind that you 
have to correlate them to the natural and cultural strata after you can 
see those layers exposed later in your unit walls.
 
 Some combination of the above: One method may not be sufficient 
for your site. For example, at a site that had materials of different time 
periods all mixed together, I dug out the 1-meter thick cultural stratum 
in 5-centimeter levels, hoping to get some control over what was earlier 
(deeper) and later (shallower).
Standard excavation techniques require you to stop at the end of each 
stratum or level to describe and map the unit floor, including any features 
or artifacts in place and the soil colors. In the top section of Figure 7-1, 
which was dug in 10-centimeter levels, you see Floor 3 at the bottom of 
Level 3, 30 centimeters deep. Color Figure 1 also shows a unit floor, in a 
light-colored natural stratum underneath the cultural stratum packed with 
white shells and black greasy soil from human use.
 
Don’t mix materials and data from different levels or strata! You want to 
maintain control of not only the depth of finds but also the associated soil, so 
you can interpret them later.
Shoveling and troweling
Often, you start excavating with a shovel and then switch to smaller tools to 
be less destructive when you start finding things. You also begin to trowel 
when you’re getting to the bottom of your stratum or level, to make a cleaner 
unit floor than you can get with a shovel. You can shovel dirt directly into a 
screen, buckets, or wheelbarrows or trowel it into dustpans or pails.
After you expose things like artifacts or features, you use finer tools and 
brushes. Metal tools can gouge bones or other soft objects, so I recommend 
sharpened pieces of cane, chopsticks, or bamboo skewers. For harder 
objects, scrape out the dirt around them, and then brush them off so you 
can identify them. (Only brush artifacts, not soils around them.)
 
Be sure to expose items in situ (Latin for “in place”). That way you can measure, 
draw, photograph, and record everything exactly as it lies before you disturb it 
and lose its context forever when you take it out of the ground. Most sites 
contain so many finds that doing this for everything would take forever, so 
smaller finds often come out of the screen. That’s why you dig in the small 
increments of strata or arbitrary levels — to keep at least some control over 
where things came from.

112
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
Recording archaeological features
One reason you want clean, nicely troweled unit floors is to be able to 
measure precisely. Another reason is to see features, the visible evidence of 
specific human behaviors. Some typical features include
 
 Dark circular or oblong stains in the soil marking the remains of pits that 
were for storage or garbage.
 
 Other, wider dark stains or soil discolorations that can show house 
floors or other human-made structures.
 
 Postmolds, or small, dark, usually circular stains left from posts stuck in 
the ground. Either they decayed in place, or they were pulled out and 
the hole filled in with vegetation that decayed and turned dark. Square 
postmolds mean more recent structures with sawn poles.
 
 Fire pits, basins, or hearths with signs of burning.
 
 Charred timbers or reddened, hard soil areas that may be from burned 
buildings.
 
 Clusters of artifacts or bones.
 
 Graves, stone or brick walls, or other obvious marks left by people.
Always treat features very carefully. You can dig small ones out and bag up their 
contents. Or you can leave them on a pedestal of dirt as you remove the rest of 
the stratum or level around them. Then you dig them out or cross-section them, 
digging deep enough to make sure you can see what they are.
This procedure is what you see back in Figure 7-1, where one feature 
(upper right) was pedestaled in Floor 2 (20 centimeters deep) where it first 
appeared, and two others appeared in Floor 3 (30 centimeters or about one 
foot deep). Then the worker cross-sectioned the pedestaled feature and 
bagged all soil from the south half for later processing. At the bottom of the 
figure you see the cross section with two big potsherds in it. The feature 
was a garbage pit. It’s clearly basin-shaped, though worm tracks make it less 
distinct. After photographing and drawing this cross section or profile of the 
feature, the worker removed the north half, putting it in a separate bag.
You see a similar procedure in Color Figure 1, where the fieldworker is cross-
sectioning a small pit full of black soil and shell. This feature was the earliest 
cultural evidence from the site, where the prehistoric campers first came to 
bury their garbage from a clambake by digging this pit into the light-colored 
natural riverbank soil. Then they stayed a long time and left all the rest of the 
garbage (from many more clambakes) piled up in the thick black stratum you 
see already excavated in the photo.

113
 Chapter 7: The Archaeological Dig
Larger features you uncover, such as walls or structure patterns, are not 
completely or even partially removable, especially if they’re rock or brick 
constructions. You may need to rethink where you place excavation units to 
expose more of these features so you know what they are.
Measuring
As you’re digging, you shovel soil (and often artifacts and other objects) 
away. But specimens you can uncover in the ground before you dig them out 
can be recorded more precisely, in place, in three dimensions.
If your datum sits in the southwest corner of the site, you can measure 
distances north and east from there. (See “Setting up a dig and mapping it” 
earlier in this chapter for more on establishing a datum.) Or you can measure 
the angle and distance from that corner. You get depth measurements with 
a string tied at ground surface to the datum corner stake and held out level 
over the find, as shown by your tiny line level hanging on the string. Then 
measure the depth from the string. You use a plumb bob (pointed weight 
on a string) held over the find to get more precise measurement. On some 
digs, you use the transit or total station for this job, holding the stadia rod or 
target over each find to get its location. But for short distances, a tape 
measure is more accurate.
Screening
Most modern archaeology uses some kind of screen to sift the soil for 
artifacts and ecofacts (plant and animal remains used by people). Even if you 
trowel slowly, you can miss tons of miniscule finds if you don’t screen. A 
standard screen size is quarter-inch mesh, but you can use finer mesh if your 
soil will go through it. You have a couple of different choices when it comes 
to screening: dry and water.
Dry screening
Dry screening is easier to set up than waterscreening, but it’s still hard work 
because you shake the screen (be sure it has legs to hold it up), and you have 
to dump it between each session to get out the pebbles, roots, and other stuff 
you don’t want. You can set it up next to the unit so that the soil that sifts 
through is right there ready to fill the excavation back in. But don’t put it so 
close that the pile of soil under it starts falling back in by itself!

114
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
Waterscreening
You need a source of water to waterscreen (duh!); if you’ve got a natural 
stream or lake nearby, you can pump water from it. (You may need an official 
permit to pump, so check that out ahead of time.) You can also make a water 
source if you excavate (perhaps with heavy equipment and beyond your 
site boundary) deep enough to reach the water table. Then you set up your 
pump, hoses, and waterscreen station. You have to bring the dirt there in 
wheelbarrows or buckets.
It may be very worth the trouble to waterscreen, because it allows you to use 
a finer mesh and capture tiny objects that may change your interpretation 
of the site. For waterscreening I use eighth-inch mesh, with window screen 
inserts to catch tiny things. (One season we got tiny European glass seed 
beads — the first finds that showed the site wasn’t prehistoric.)
Recovering remains with flotation
Soil flotation is an easy technology using water and fine screens to recover 
tiny and fragile remains. Some flotation devices are simple buckets with their 
bottoms replaced by screens. You pass soil through the bucket while 
standing in shallow water and holding the bottom of the bucket submerged. 
You also have a strainer handy to skim light stuff (charcoal, charred seeds, 
fish scales) that floats off the top.
Another type of flotation machine is a manufactured tub or barrel (or 
homemade 50-gallon drums) with a hose stuck into the bottom and a shower 
head on the end of it inside. You turn on the water to fill the barrel, and put 
inside a bucket with a screen or two graduated screens in the bottom and a 
spout on top. As you dump the soil into the bucket, larger and smaller items 
are caught in the bucket screens. Light, sometimes very tiny things float off 
the top and down the spout into an even finer screen.
The materials you recover are called the heavy fractions (what sank into the 
screens), and the light fraction (what floated out), or sometimes labeled the A, 
B, and C fractions, respectively). You put these materials together with their 
accompanying information somewhere where they can dry (I use squares of 
nylon tied closed and hung from a clothesline). Later you sort through them.

115
 Chapter 7: The Archaeological Dig
 
Excavation techniques seriously influence results! In a recent dig, I made the 
crew carry all the soils from a big prehistoric garbage pit feature back to the 
lab for flotation. They were heavy bags, hauled into the truck, out of the truck, 
down the stairs, out to the machine — and floating them took many weeks 
of muddy work. But the animal bones we recovered from this garbage dump 
gave a beautiful picture of life at the site. Not only did we get enough charcoal 
bits for a date (A.D. 1200), but the flotation technique also produced many 
tiny bone bits of birds, fish, and large and small mammals. Many of the fish 
vertebrae were very tiny. Without the fine screening of the flotation technique, 
we would have lost 68 percent of the fish species.
Taking soil samples
I take 9-liter soil samples (a chunk that’s 30-x-30 centimeters by 10 centimeters 
thick) for flotation from each stratum or level excavated in each unit. Also, I 
process all soils from features by flotation. Those important tiny clues that 
can give you answers to big questions may show up in the flotation barrel. 
Any soil samples destined for flotation should be chunked out with a shovel 
or at least troweled out in big solid hunks, so as not to scrape and destroy as 
many of the tiny preserved seeds or other fragile remains.
Just be sure you don’t make the bags of soils so heavy that they either break 
or are unmovable. Plus, if you’re not doing flotation at the site but rather 
back at the lab, be sure you don’t have so many heavy bags of soil that you 
can’t fit them in your vehicle.
Many archaeologists also take additional soil samples just to save, in case 
future studies may be possible. I take a 1-liter sample of soil from each level 
or stratum in case I can do pollen analysis or other research. They end up 
being heavy boxes on the lab shelf, but they’re worth it later!
Doing special digs: Mounds, 
buildings, caves, and more
Specialized kinds of sites call for specific techniques. Some have long histories 
of efficient use, but others you may need to develop as you work. Here are 
some examples:

116
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
 
 Mounds or mounded earthen constructions such as walls and enclosures 
may have stratigraphy (layering) that shows basket loads. (Basket loads 
are individual piles of construction soil, often of different colors, that 
spread out when they’re dumped and become small lens-shaped 
deposits.) You can sometimes cross-section or trench earthen 
constructions like these to get details about how they were built.
 
 Standing architecture or stones, even in ruins, can be large obstacles 
requiring lots of planning. Whether you have stone-block pyramids, 
adobe walls, or giant stelae (tall, standing stones) and sculptures, you 
need to plan what you’re going to do with all the pieces, how to map 
them in three dimensions, and how to dig the soil around them. For 
fallen structures, you can number and map pieces in place and then 
remove them to get to underlying pieces, leaving standing portions and 
working around them.
 
 Caves and rock shelters (shallow caves) may have layers of rock fallen 
from the roof and sediment washed in and out by water and wind. You 
may need to perch over the floors you’re digging (as shown in Figure 3-1 
in Chapter 3) so as not to step on them.
 
 Shell midden sites are usually dug the same as any other site, but the 
shells in the soil may make it difficult to dig with shovels or take out 
levels as thin as 10 centimeters. Using picks, 20-centimeters levels, and 
waterscreening (because you’re usually near the source of the shellfish) 
are your best bets. In Color Figure 1, you see the shell midden stratum 
that has small river clams, a little easier to dig through than big oysters.
 
 Dry sites may have sand blowing all over — a safety hazard that can also 
obscure features. But the sand helps with preservation, so be ready for 
fragile organic materials. Be sure you have plastic vials or other sturdy 
containers to hold fragile items such as bone, wood, or seeds and 
protect them from harm after they’re excavated.
 
 Volcanic ash-covered sites are rare, but they have amazing preservation 
even when organic remains are long decayed. The trick is to know that 
voids in the deposits show where something once was. Fill these 
hollows with plaster, and you get casts of plant crops in the field (at a 
Central American site) or even the bodies of victims (at Pompeii).
 
 Wet sites are submerged cultural deposits dug by pumping water out of 
the ground, usually with well points (like huge straws around your unit 
to suck it dry). De-watering requires lots more machinery, but you get 
organic (plants and animals) remains that otherwise wouldn’t have been 
preserved, like wooden or bark artifacts or cloth. But they’re fragile, so 
you need to keep them wet — maybe in sealed bags with water — so 
that they don’t dry up and degrade.
 
 Underwater archaeological sites, from drowned occupational areas to 
shipwrecks, require a whole set of additional expensive techniques — 
and you have to know how to dive. See the “Methods in underwater 
archaeology” sidebar in this chapter for more on excavating underwater 
sites.

117
 Chapter 7: The Archaeological Dig
Ending the dig
How you end your dig depends upon whether you’re coming back. You can 
cover excavation units and fence them off if you’re returning next season. 
Otherwise, you want to backfill — always a professional (if backbreaking) 
obligation. If you’ve carted your dirt away to a distant screen, you have to 
cart it all back! For sites that are about to be destroyed for construction, you 
may get the machinery the builders will use, or their operators, to backfill. Or 
they may not care whether you backfill because they’re coming the next day 
to push it all away anyway.
You may want to leave plastic sheeting or other indicators at the bottom of 
your units so that future workers will know where you already dug. You may 
pull up your stakes, pick up everything, and even put sod back depending 
upon what’s required by the landowner.
Methods in underwater archaeology
It’s way more difficult to excavate carefully 
underwater and expose your finds exactly as 
they lie. Here are some typical methods, which 
are very different from what you do on land:
  You may find sites the old-fashioned way 
through the historic record or a story of a 
find someone made while fishing, or you 
may need remote sensing devices such as 
magnetometers or sonar.
  Finding your exact position underwater is 
now easier with GPS (global positioning 
systems) devices.
  You may use a grid of PVC pipes to lay 
out your excavation units and waterproof 
plastic slates or laminated tablets to record 
things.
  You probably won’t excavate with shovels; 
you may use a dredge or airlift, a hose that 
sucks up sediments and dumps them into a 
screen on a barge for others to sort through 
for artifacts.
  You may do your fine digging with a trowel, 
but you can also fan the sediments with 
your hands to make the moving water 
uncover objects.
  With everything moving around in the 
water, you need to be extra careful to 
record things quickly and well. Waterproof 
cameras help a lot!
  You need a conservation plan and equip-
ment for preserving the waterlogged items 
you find; after they’re exposed to air, they 
may start decaying or shriveling right 
away.
  You want to have a lot of knowledge of 
what different water conditions do to arti-
facts. Shipworms eat wood, iron rusts, and 
a pile of silver coins can transform into a 
large black mass that looks like a dumb old 
rock.

118
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
Recording Excavation Information 
and Finds
 
Without careful notes and recording, any archaeological dig is just looting! A 
good rule of thumb is “Whenever in doubt, write it down.”
Okay, so you may also fill out so many forms and do so much paperwork 
that it seems you’re working in the department of redundancy department. 
But the more places something is recorded, the less information is lost to 
mistakes.
Provenience
 
The concept of provenience is all-important in archaeological excavation. You 
write it on the bags, tags, forms, notes, and many other places. It’s everything 
about where stuff comes from!
Chapter 6 lists some of the information you need to record provenience 
during archaeological survey. When you’re excavating, you may need even 
more information:
 
 Project and institution name, your name, and probably the names of all 
other crew members who helped with this find.
 
 The day, the date, and perhaps the time of day.
 
 The precise three-dimensional location coordinates, if possible, and 
what datum they were recorded from.
 
 The excavation unit, level or stratum, and depth.
 
 Whether it was recovered by shoveling, troweling, or in the screen.
 
 Any other particular information, such as “within the red soil area,” 
“northwest corner of unit,” or “2 centimeters east of the stone ax.”
Field forms and notes
Typical field forms describe each excavation level in detail. Other forms are 
for individual features, excavation unit wall stratigraphy, and other things 
your dig may uncover. You usually have a form to log in each photo in minute 
detail (camera settings, direction facing, subject, photographer, date).

119
 Chapter 7: The Archaeological Dig
On field inventory forms, you list bags of materials as they’re recovered 
each day — this list is your field specimen catalog. You assign field catalog 
numbers to each bag and write them on the form and bags. A simple system 
is to use the site number and then sequential numbers after that. So the first 
bag of artifacts from Test Unit 1, Level 1 at the Walnut site 22It539 may be 
numbered 22It539-01. (If this site number looks like gibberish to you, head to 
Chapter 6 for more on the site-numbering process.)
Your official field notes include much more than what’s on forms. You write 
down what you did all day, specific finds, units, levels or strata, features you 
worked on, who visited, how well the equipment worked, what the weather 
was like — anything that can affect how the materials and data are interpreted. 
If two people work on the same thing and one forgets to put the date on 
the bag, that information should be in the other person’s notes so it can be 
recovered. Field notes also show why you made certain decisions.
Photography and computer data entry
You can have a site photographer or take photos yourself. The photo log is 
very important; many pictures of dirt all look alike. You must decide whether 
you want digital cameras or regular film. I often use both, as well as a video 
camera — not necessarily for making award-winning movies, but just to have 
another source of information to help figure things out.
Besides loading digital photos onto your laptop in the field, you can do the 
bag inventory and record other data electronically. You can put finds on 
your site map as they come out of the ground and see what patterns you may 
have. This map gives you a better idea of where to expand the digging.
Procedures for unusual finds
Your dig supervisor will usually be familiar with artifacts and other finds 
unearthed as you dig, but not always. You’re the person directly in contact 
with the materials as they’re being uncovered, so you may see some pattern 
others don’t.
 
If you’re not sure whether something is an artifact or other item worth saving, 
save it anyway! It may be something new nobody has yet discovered. It may 
look like a dumb old rock but be a real artifact. It may be a natural item that 
still gives indications of past peoples’ environments. Things I’ve saved include 
fulgurites (natural creations of sand fused by lightning), mud-dauber wasp 
nests (which would have needed a straight wall to form on, meaning a prehis-
toric native house), and river pebbles (not sure what they mean yet). Even if 
what you’ve saved is worthless, better to be sure. You can always throw it out 
in the lab after you see what it really is.

120
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
For special finds, outside assistance may be required:
 
 Unexpected kinds of finds may call for specialists — a firearms or 
basketry expert, or a geologist for unusual soils.
 
 Fragile remains that are wet or partially decayed or broken in place can 
be saved by an archaeological conservator — your local museum may 
have one.
 
 Human skeletal remains require special treatment according to laws and 
also archaeological ethics. You may need a biological anthropologist to 
determine whether they’re ancient or recent (though preserved clothing 
also helps here). You’re also obliged to find any modern descendants 
and communicate with them about the next step — you may need to 
leave skeletons in the ground out of respect. I discuss finding human 
skeletons more in Chapter 8.

I
n Chapter 6, I show you how to find archaeological sites and determine 
where to dig, and in Chapter 7, how to conduct excavation. You may think 
you’re ready to go out and do fieldwork, but besides knowing what to do, you 
really have to know what not to do in the field.
This chapter describes ethical and safety standards in archaeological field-
work. I explain how to interact with everyone interested in or affected by the 
dig and how to stay safe while wielding metal archaeological tools. I give you 
examples of what can go wrong and how to anticipate it. This chapter shows 
you how archaeology does indeed include the adventure of the unexpected 
but sometimes the undesired as well.
Gathering Information from Landowners, 
Residents, and Officials
As part of your preparation for archaeological survey or excavation, you 
always want to have permission to dig and knowledge of any laws pertaining to 
the land. You also want to find out about the land’s past from owners, local 
residents, and descendant communities (people whose ancestors may have 
lived there) and see how your work will affect them (and vice versa).

122
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
 
All archaeology in the 21st century is in some way public archaeology. It’s 
usually supported by public funding, and it often investigates the human 
heritage that belongs to everyone. So keep the public in mind as you dig.
Know the laws about digging
Different laws cover different kinds of land, and human graves come under 
another whole set of laws. The following sections give a general idea of the 
legalities (but be sure you get specifics for the particular area of your survey 
or excavation).
Private land
In the U.S., any artifacts unearthed on someone’s private land, no matter 
how archaeologically valuable, belong to the landowner. In most other 
countries, the government takes charge of archaeological sites and artifacts 
to promote the heritage of the people. Although this practice sounds like 
better protection for sites, it can lead to looting or concealing finds.
You need permission to walk and look for artifacts (and certainly to dig) on 
any private land. Although it may be customary just to cut across someone’s 
yard or field, you’re trespassing if you do it without permission. If you pick 
up artifacts or dig a hole without permission while you’re there, you’re really 
asking for trouble.
Public land
You need a permit to do any archaeology on public lands in the U.S. 
depending on who owns them (states, local governments, or the federal 
government). A research permit application asks you to justify why you 
want to survey and pick up finds or dig on land that’s protected. As I 
describe in Chapter 7, digging means destroying the evidence forever, so 
you’d better have a very good reason!
A famous law, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), 
requires U.S. government agencies to take into account any archaeological 
sites before they build something or disturb the ground. Much of the 
archaeology done in the U.S. today results from this law, as well as other 
federal, state, and local laws covering cultural resources (archaeological and 
historic sites).
In most countries outside the U.S., a permit is necessary for any archaeological 
excavation, and the finds often have to stay in the country and be studied 
there. Many countries also have laws requiring survey or protecting 
archaeological sites in the path of construction.

123
 Chapter 8: Laws, Ethics, and Safety in Field Archaeology
Human graves
Even on private land, cemeteries are protected by law, so you can’t just go 
dig there. Archaeologists sometimes help officials move graves out of the 
way of construction sites. Archaeologists’ professional expertise means less 
disturbance to the remains of people’s loved ones. In addition, they may 
study the old graves and skeletons to identify who’s there or see what they 
can discover about the remains.
Unmarked human graves or bones are covered under different sets of laws. 
But nearly everywhere, you have to obtain permission to disturb them. So if 
you uncover unexpected human bones, you have to call authorities and first 
determine whether the bones are modern or ancient. You may need a 
bioarchaeologist (skeleton specialist) for this task. If they’re modern remains, 
the medical examiner or other legal officer takes charge.
With ancient skeletons, you also need to comply with various laws depending 
upon where you are. Usually, you report them to a state archaeologist, and 
you’re obliged to find out who the descendants may be. You may be allowed 
to excavate and study them under certain circumstances, but often you just 
rebury them.
Excavated skeletons
In the U.S., many laws cover human skeletons already excavated from 
archaeological sites. The Native American Graves Protection and 
Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) of 1993 required that human skeletal remains 
from federal land or dug with federal money be inventoried. Museums and 
other repositories had to give to any culturally affiliated peoples these 
inventories or lists of what remains they had. These peoples then had the 
opportunity to repatriate (take back) the bones and funerary objects 
(artifacts in graves). Sometimes Native American groups allowed study 
before repatriation, and sometimes they didn’t. Many revered ancestors 
were reburied respectfully.
 
Problems arise when the remains are clearly indigenous Americans but 
can’t be tied to any living group, which often happens if the skeleton is many 
thousands of years old or it’s in an area where the native people’s identity 
is unknown. Early European invaders wiped out hundreds of ethnic groups 
very quickly before these groups could be recorded. Many historic Native 
Americans who did survive could get less-brutal treatment if they hid their 
native heritage and passed for white or black. So tracing these connections is 
difficult.
I give you more to think about on these issues later in this chapter, and also 
in Chapter 16’s discussion of who owns or controls the interpretation and 
materials of the past.

124
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
Other buried stuff
Utility lines (gas, electric, telephone, water) are everywhere underground. 
Before you dig, contact the companies and government agencies to get maps 
of where they run. Disturbing them may be not only illegal but also dangerous! 
In many places, you can call a toll-free number to have someone come out and 
flag the locations of all the utility lines in the area where you’re planning to dig 
so you can avoid them.
 
Find out about buried toxic waste and other things that can be hazardous or 
confusing before you dig. Government agencies are supposed to know where 
these hazards are. Often, local folks can tell you this too. One farmer helped 
me understand the many dark features I’d exposed in his field. His dad made 
them in the 1920s when a flood killed sheep and pigs and he buried them! I did 
uncover a pig skeleton, complete with an iron ring in its nose!
Know the neighborhood where 
you’re digging
Archaeologists must consider the various stakeholders or people interested 
in and affected by the past, the archaeological sites and finds. Each kind of 
stakeholder may have different reasons for this interest — often conflicting. 
And many of these reasons may conflict with your archaeological goals.
Local residents
Wherever you’re digging or surveying, get to know the local people. That way 
they don’t call the sheriff to see what you’re doing. Also, they may be able to 
help you. They know the land and its history, including how natural places 
have changed over time. They may know about lots of archaeological sites 
and share artifact collections with you. They may even rescue you when your 
vehicle breaks down. Digging is easier and more ethically desirable if you 
have community support. You can also find the best places to stop after a 
day of digging for ice cream or a cold beer.
Other stakeholders
You won’t believe the number of groups and people who may have an interest 
in the archaeology you’re doing. Here’s a list of some of them:
 
 Friends or family of the landowner, even people who manage the land 
for someone else who may have given you permission to be there.
 
 Anyone descended from or claiming to be descended from the people 
whose remains you’re excavating (discussed more in the section 
“Respecting Native Americans and Other Descendant Communities” 
later in this chapter, and also in Chapter 16).

125
 Chapter 8: Laws, Ethics, and Safety in Field Archaeology
 
 Amateur (avocational) archaeologists who don’t want you on their own 
special sites, or who do want to share with you what they’ve found at 
your site.
 
 Looters who don’t want you on their special sites.
 
 People who are unclear on the law and think if you find a site on their 
land, the government will take it away.
 
 Other archaeologists who may have previously worked at the site or in 
the region and may or may not agree with your work and results.
 
 People who think archaeology is easy and want to come out and dig with 
you (or dig into your units after you leave for the day).
 
 People who don’t care about archaeology but just don’t want a bunch of 
college students, dirty people with shovels, hippies, and/or noisy folks 
next door or down the road.
 
 People who don’t care about archaeology and absolutely don’t want you 
on their land. (Maybe they’re growing marijuana or doing something 
else they don’t want you to see.)
 
 News reporters who want to get in on the dig and report it.
 
 Civic groups and historical societies interested in how your findings fit 
in with their community history.
 
 The general public who want to watch and maybe even learn from what 
you’re doing.
 
 Specific groups such as school kids or teachers who want to observe 
and/or participate.
Field Ethics and Local Communities
I describe doing archaeology in, with, and for local communities in greater 
detail in Chapter 16. Here I discuss your ethical obligation to these important 
stakeholders to involve them in your work one way or another.
Positive community interaction
As an archaeologist, you have to be humble and realize you can find out a lot 
from so many others who know the land and the community.
 
Good ethics require that you share your archaeological investigation with the 
public. You benefit in ways you may not expect. You also share the concept of 
stewardship, preserving the heritage of the human past for the benefit of all.

126
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
Here are a few things you can do:
 
 Besides getting permissions and permits, let local law enforcement and 
neighbors near the dig know what’s going on.
 
 Give a talk on your project for the local library, chamber of commerce, 
scout troop, or historical society.
 
 Hold an archaeology day where you can talk about your dig, show pictures, 
have people show you their artifacts, and teach them how to do old crafts 
such as pottery-making or flintknapping (stone tool chipping). I always have 
kids practice spear-throwing with sharpened cane poles and targets of 
mammoths drawn on big sheets of paper and stuck to bales of hay.
 
 Designate a day when the public can come help you dig and screen 
(under close supervision).
 
 Enlist neighbors to be stewards — to help guard your site from looters 
as they realize its importance to the community’s human heritage.
 
 Assign a different crew person each day to greet visitors and explain 
clearly the archaeological project goals. Have a few of the nicest finds to 
show people (or if you’re afraid of looters, some of the most boring finds 
so people don’t want to go treasure hunting after you leave).
 
 Work with communities to see what they themselves want investigated 
about their cultural heritage.
Publicity
The local (or wider) press will often be very interested in the archaeology 
you’re doing. Write a press release yourself (it helps avoid inaccuracies) to 
share details of the project with local newspapers, radio, and TV. In small 
towns, you may be the most interesting thing going on at the moment and get 
good coverage.
Invite media reporters to your dig and show them around. You can say you 
hope their stories don’t encourage looting. You may ask them not to give 
directions to the site. They may offer to have you review what they write 
or say. Sometimes they also want to participate so they can write about the 
experience.
Publicity is usually helpful, especially if it brings volunteer workers or people 
with useful knowledge and artifacts.

127
 Chapter 8: Laws, Ethics, and Safety in Field Archaeology
Respecting Native Americans and 
Other Descendant Communities
I mentioned above the laws about digging human skeletons. But the ethical 
responsibilities you have as an archaeologist toward the past people and 
their present descendants are much more complicated than just staying 
within the law.
Case study of a forgotten stakeholder
A story from my own work illustrates the concept 
of stakeholders in the archaeological process. 
My university was planning new buildings. 
Because a previous archaeologist had surveyed 
our campus, I knew of a significant prehistoric 
site right in the construction zone. University 
officials asked me to dig it to salvage as much 
as possible before the construction crew 
bulldozed it. I wanted publicity to see whether 
anyone had previously collected artifacts 
and even invite people to join in the dig. The 
university said no. The buildings were to 
be fraternity houses, and the project was 
controversial because they were being built with 
state money. So we just did the work quietly and 
submitted a report.
The next year the university planned to tear down 
the handball courts and build a new parking 
lot. Of course, the handball courts were on 
the only other significant prehistoric site on 
campus. To dig on state land — even at my 
own university — I needed to get a research 
permit from the state. So I did that advance 
paperwork and also an advance report to the 
university grounds and maintenance office. 
Another requirement was to contact the office 
that monitors all activities going on all over 
campus. Finally, I needed to report our planned 
work to the campus cops as well.
This time the school allowed me to have a public 
“archaeology day” when people could come 
watch or participate. I had news reporters, 
a Boy Scout troop, professors and students, 
and artists fascinated with the pink spear 
point I’d excavated. Several students were 
interested in how ancient hunters had lived near 
the small pond (now channeled into a drainage 
ditch) a thousand years ago on the same land 
where they now attended classes. My crew 
and I served the public and the archaeological 
resource. But I forgot one stakeholder — the 
parking office!
The archaeology students and I had all parked 
in a dormitory lot nearby. It was summer, and 
no students were in the dorm because budget 
cuts had meant no classes. Ours were the only 
vehicles in the lot, and we all had parking 
permits — but not for that lot. An hour before 
the public program (when many more cars 
would fill the lot), the parking official showed 
up to write tickets. I had to go to the parking 
director’s office and plead for an exception. I 
had forgotten a stakeholder who wasn’t even 
interested in the archaeology at all, just in 
keeping the rules.

128
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
Respect for human remains
Some people love to have their own past and families investigated. You may 
say, sure, dig up my grandmother and do scientific study on her skeleton! But 
all cultures don’t share this attitude. For many, including Native Americans 
and other indigenous peoples around the world, respect for the ancestors 
means not disturbing them at all. For others, it may mean limited study of 
skeletons or artifacts. Religious and traditional beliefs are important here.
When you can’t avoid excavation of graves because of some construction, 
religious specialists and others may need to be present to conduct ceremonies 
and direct archaeological recovery and reburial of remains.
When you may need to stop digging
If you do uncover human skeletons, the most important step besides the legal 
actions is consultation. You want to explain the situation to the community and 
bring in all interested people to meet and discuss alternatives within the law.
 
Many archaeologists just don’t excavate burials at all to avoid any problems. 
Others recognize that you can discover so much about past health, diet, 
disease, environment, and daily life from studying human bones (discussed 
more in Chapter 10). As an archaeologist, you’re usually an anthropologist 
too. So you’re acutely aware of the ethnocentrism in treating some people’s 
remains as sacred and protected in cemeteries, and other people’s remains 
as scientific specimens sitting on museum shelves.
 
Keep in mind human dignity as you dig. People walked and acted and lived 
where you’re uncovering the remains they left behind. Always plan and 
consult with anyone who may be affected before you dig. Then be ready to 
uncover something in the ground that you must immediately cover back up.
Dealing with Dangerous Archaeological 
Field Conditions
Any outdoor activity involving metal tools, deep holes, and groups of happy, 
energetic people is bound to have many natural and human-made hazards. 
The following sections show you some specific areas to watch out for.

129
 Chapter 8: Laws, Ethics, and Safety in Field Archaeology
Tools and careless crew members
You always want to know how to use machines and hand tools carefully.
 
Even a trowel needs to be used precisely: You should hold it at a 45-degree 
angle to the ground, and you should be slicing off the soil, not scraping it. 
Otherwise, you’ll obscure soil colors and features and scrape artifacts. If roots 
are in your way, cut them with your clippers. Pulling them up can damage 
your flat floor or wall.
Handling shovels, picks, machetes, and even well-sharpened trowels means 
using caution at all times. Government projects often have safety manuals 
and specific rules. Here are some general examples of proper procedures and 
injuries resulting from misuse of archaeological equipment:
 
 Picks and shovels can easily hit arms, legs, and especially feet — this 
is why you always wear long pants and sturdy boots. My own heavy 
leather boots have a nick in the toe where I accidentally hit them with 
the corner of a mattock (a wide-bladed pick).
 
 Even walking through the forest just carrying tools, you can get hit if you 
follow too closely and a vine grabs someone’s shovel or machete and 
swings it back at you.
Research benefits from community interaction
When doing archaeology near small towns, I 
always check out local libraries. I love to meet 
librarians, learn from their knowledge, give them 
extra archaeology books I’ve accumulated, and 
see what old historic documents they may have, 
such as donated family papers. Librarians also 
love research and figuring stuff out.
Once a library stop had amazing results. For 
years I’d been searching for a prehistoric 
mound that an early explorer recorded in the 
bend of the river a century ago. This explorer 
had dug up beautiful native pottery and even 
some early Spanish glass and brass items (now 
in the Smithsonian Museum of the American 
Indian). But the mound’s location was lost. I’d 
taken crew after crew, season after season, to 
comb the riverbank swamps looking for it, with 
no success. One day we walked in to see the 
town library’s new building, which featured 
an exhibit of artifacts loaned by local people, 
including pottery from this mound and a map 
showing its exact location! A man had collected 
artifacts there when he was a kid some 40 years 
earlier. The librarian was just as excited as my 
archaeology crew. She called the man, and he 
came right over and offered to take us directly 
to the mound — or where it had been. Back 
then he’d gotten there on a trail bike through 
the woods (now there was a road). The mound 
had been eroding away on the riverbank edge. 
Now it was completely gone, but he was able to 
point to a tree on the bank that had been right 
next to it. I got an exact location and GPS coor-
dinates. He graciously allowed us to study and 
photograph his collection and write an article 
about it.

Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
 
 That old maxim about stepping on your shovel blade and having it 
bounce up and bash you in the face is very true, and not just for cartoon 
characters. Whenever you put a shovel on the ground, turn it face down.
 
 Anything sharp being thrown to someone else can hurt. I heard of 
someone getting a pointed iron pin through the eyeball.
 
 Heavy wheelbarrows of dirt (and even full buckets of soil) are guaranteed 
to give you a backache. Only fill them half full. If you try to push a 
wheelbarrow that’s too heavy for you, it will inevitably tip over, spilling 
all your precious soil full of artifacts.
 
 Sticking trowels, ice picks, or other pointed tools in your pocket or pack 
can result in their poking through and impaling you.
 
 With heavy equipment, be absolutely clear on various safety procedures 
and issues from fire hazards to use of gas and oil containers. With any 
heavy machinery or deep excavations you need to wear a hard hat.
 
 Shore up any excavation that goes more than 4 feet deep so it doesn’t 
cave in on the diggers, especially in soft sand. Have a ladder to get in 
and out. An alternative is to dig in stepped segments to get as deep as 
you need to.
 
 Objects you stand on to take site and whole-unit photos (ladders, 
buckets, or the truck roof) can be unstable and result in falls or dents.
 
Always check directions and get instruction before using heavy or power 
machinery. An archaeologist I worked for wasn’t very safety-conscious. She 
handed a chain saw to a worker and ordered him to clear a few trees near the 
excavation unit. Afraid to say anything, the guy took the machine and tried to 
use it for the first time in his life. Within a couple minutes he had sawed into 
his own thigh! (Don’t worry, I drove him to the emergency room.)
Get help to use machines!
On the crews I supervise, I always ask first 
whether people know how to use machinery. 
Once I didn’t get the chance as we went out 
to a deserted island in the Gulf of Mexico to do 
archaeological survey. The ranger taking us 
in the boat had earlier left his ATV (all-terrain 
vehicle) on the island to fix. While the crew and 
I were swimming and waiting for him, he had 
fixed it and asked two students to run it along 
the beach a few miles back to the camp house. 
When we arrived at camp in the boat we found 
the two had never before driven an ATV, and 
had crashed and rolled it! The artifacts they 
had picked up were lost. One student had a cut 
face requiring stitches, so we had to get off the 
island quickly and to an emergency room.

 Chapter 8: Laws, Ethics, and Safety in Field Archaeology
Hazards of Mother Nature
You can check the particular natural hazards in the area where you’re 
digging and take precautions against them. Here are some common ones:
 
 Insects bite and sting! Use repellent and have first aid (including ice for 
swelling) to use after they bite. Gloves, long sleeves, long pants, and 
headgear help here.
 
 If you’re very allergic or get many stings at once, you can have a severe 
reaction. Then you need a quick shot of epinephrine — in the field or 
an emergency room — to prevent shock. If you know you’re extremely 
allergic, carry an epinephrine injector in your pack (but get a prescrip-
tion from your doctor).
 
 Ticks carry Lyme disease and other fevers. Non-disease ticks still 
burrow their heads into your skin and stay there (yech!), so know 
how to get them out properly with tweezers. Redbugs or chiggers also 
burrow (completely) into you and stay. One remedy is suffocating them 
by covering them with nail polish.
 
 Poison ivy and oak, stinging nettles, thorns on trees, and even branches 
that poke your eyeball can do severe damage. In my region of the south-
eastern U.S., poison ivy carpets the ground and makes lush canopies up 
into the trees. To go anywhere in the forest I need to be completely 
covered. Then I need to watch that my pack and the exterior of my 
clothes don’t ever touch bare skin. Some commercial products 
specifically treat poison ivy, and others you can put on your skin in 
advance to prevent getting it.
 
 Snakes usually don’t bite unless you pick them up, which should be 
strictly against project safety rules! They usually head away when they 
hear you coming. But know what snakes occur in your area and what 
to do if they bite anyway (go to the emergency room!). See the sidebar 
“Wildlife encounters in the field” for info on snakebite kits.
 
 Other animals you may not think of as vicious can bite you, so rabies 
and other effects are possibilities here. You can often fend them off with 
whatever tool you have in your hand.
 
 In some regions, disease organisms in the air and soil can get you. Read 
up about valley fever, trench lung or trench fever, Hantavirus, and 
others and whether they’re risks associated with your site. Check for 
chemical hazards in the soil too, such as fertilizers on farm fields, septic 
or chemical waste areas, and even old cattle dip vats full of arsenic. (I’ve 
suffered through all these!)

132
Part II: Archaeological Fieldwork: The Adventure Begins! 
 
Animals and plants live outdoors, and you usually don’t. So you may want to 
read up on wildlife in your site area. Be prepared with guidebooks to identify 
the critters and emergency medicine guides to identify remedies.
Wildlife encounters in the field
Every summer field season, I get poison ivy 
blisters. The oil soaks through even the long 
sleeves and thick jeans. I’m used to it and have 
cortisone cream in my pack.
I use meat tenderizer on bee stings or ant bites 
(wet it and rub it in). It has an enzyme (papain, 
from papaya) that dissolves the protein the bug 
leaves in you. But don’t use it near your face, 
because it’ll dissolve your cornea too! I carry 
liquid antihistamine for insect stings. It’s for kids 
in this form, but it gets into your system faster.
I’ve had various animals fall into open excava-
tion units. Usually they’re removable from afar 
with your shovel blade. Or you can leave a 
long board in the unit as a ramp for any animal 
that falls in to climb out on. I once removed an 
amazingly vicious possum by pushing it with 
the shovel into a bucket lowered on a rope and 
quickly hauling it up and out. Birds have nested 
in our screens and even once in a unit wall 
(destroying the stratigraphic layers we wanted 
to record!).
You have to expect that you’ll not always look 
your best or act with your most refined behavior 
in the archaeological field situation. One 
season, I accidentally took out a wasp nest 
with my face while walking through the forest 
to set up an excavation. Not pleasant. Ice from 
the water cooler helped swelling, and I took a 
couple big swigs out of the antihistamine bottle 
in my pack. The stuff does make you dopey, so I 
sat on a log all day while my face swelled up till 
I resembled an elephant-woman. The field crew 
was sympathetic and dug more carefully than 
ever. They picked up all my fallen tools and put 
my pack back together. Next day, the swelling 
disappeared, but it left me with a sagging face.
On another project I used sturdy feed bags for 
soil samples. I grabbed a bunch of bags from 
the pile on the ground and headed toward an 
excavation unit, but the crew were pointing at 
me and yelling. A snake (a pretty, very deadly 
copperhead) had nestled into the bag pile for a 
nap, and now was in my arms! I quickly dropped 
everything and avoided tragedy. (By the way, 
snakebite kits aren’t recommended these days 
because people misuse them. Yes, I carry one 
in my pack. For 20 years it’s worked very well — 
as a magic charm preventing any bites.)
The next day when we were sitting around on 
overturned buckets eating lunch, I jumped up 
and yelled at the sight of another copperhead. 
Someone snapped a photo; it was a plastic 
snake, pulled along on clear fishing line by 
a mischievous crew member! They all had a 
laugh to see the photo with me spitting cheese 
and crackers and pointing at the ground with 
an agitated expression. They refused to give me 
the photo, probably planning to use it for future 
laughs.

Par t III
After the Dig: 
You’ve Only 
Just Begun

In this part . . .
M
ost people don’t realize that the work after the dig 
is the largest part of archaeology! It’s often the rea-
son that many digs never do get reported or described 
completely in print — finishing the job takes years! 
In Chapter 9, I introduce the archaeological laboratory 
and show you what to do with all your information and 
finds to get them ready for study. Chapter 10 highlights 
different ways you can analyze your artifacts, and then 
Chapter 1l details the many ways (and fancy theoretical 
backgrounds) for telling the story of what you found and 
reconstructing human behavior in the past.

Chapter 9
Processing Excavated Materials 
in the Laboratory
In This Chapter
 Getting the laboratory set up
 Cleaning and logging all your finds and data
 Focusing on curation and collections management
You may ask, “Why doesn’t Hollywood show archaeologists sitting 
at laboratory tables all day?” After all, that’s the biggest part of 
archaeology, and you can make thrilling discoveries right there in the lab 
too. Actually, you’ve seen this sort of work on crime-scene shows, where 
the lab tech cleans something up and finds out it’s the big clue to the 
mystery.
So you need to know what to do with everything you bring back from the 
dig. In this chapter, I show you how an archaeological lab is set up. Then 
you see the first steps in processing all your materials, including how to 
clean, number, identify, and store finds and keep good records. Finally, I 
discuss curation — caring for everything so it can continue to be useful for 
research. Managing archaeological collections is complicated (and a spe-
cialty in itself)!
Setting Up an Archaeology Lab
Archaeology laboratories show up in universities, colleges, museums, archae-
ology company offices, and sometimes governmental agencies. You may even 
have a field lab to begin dealing with excavated materials right away.

136
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
You don’t need a lot of equipment, space, and extensive training to start a 
lab. The fundamental operations, after all, are what you do all the time at 
home. You take care of material objects by
 
 Cleaning them
 
 Repairing them
 
 Putting them away in orderly fashion
 
 Storing them under good conditions
Of course, unlike with archaeological finds, you probably don’t need to write 
numbers on all the socks in your drawer or pots and pans in your kitchen, or 
keep a list of exactly where you got each one.
Basic archaeology lab needs 
In the lab, you do dirty, clean, wet, and dry work and store artifacts, other 
materials, and lots of paper. You need a typical scientific laboratory as well 
as items specific to archaeological collections (such as curation supplies).
Some things an archaeology lab needs to be:
 
 Spacious enough for both work and storage, and well lit
 
 As clean as possible (which can be tricky with all that dirty stuff like soil 
and unwashed artifacts around)
 
 Climate-controlled, because inhospitable temperature and humidity can 
cause further decomposition of many specimens
 
 Pollution-free, also to protect specimens
 
 Safety-conscious, with fire alarm and first-aid kit
 
 Secure, to prevent theft or loss; security needs are especially great 
(lockable cabinets, drawers, and doors) if you’re doing forensic cases 
requiring careful chain-of-evidence documentation
Here’s a list of some basic things an archaeology lab needs to have:
 
 Tables (long and wide), chairs, and good lighting (high-intensity lamps)
 
 Plenty of shelving, adjustable if possible
 
 A big sink with a sand trap (if possible) that deposits any soil into a con-
tainer that you can then empty without clogging up your pipes
And finally, this list shows you the basic supplies needed in an archaeological 
laboratory:

137
 Chapter 9: Processing Excavated Materials in the Laboratory
 
 Regular office supplies, including waterproof markers and pens, rulers, 
compasses, protractors, wide clear tape for map repair, 3-ring binders, 
and storage supplies such as plastic photo holders or sheet protectors.
 
 Black and white India (indelible) ink and quill pens (nibs and handles) or 
very fine-point waterproof felt-tip pens.
 
 Plastic dishpans or other tubs for washing artifacts; brushes (including 
old toothbrushes).
 
 Kitchen strainers and geological screens of different mesh sizes for fur-
ther sorting of soils.
 
 Resealable plastic bags of all sizes — the usual curation standards are 
4 mils thick. (A mil equals 0.025 millimeters or 0.001 inch; even garbage 
bags are usually only 1 or 2 mils thick) — and acid-free paper bags.
 
 Plastic or glass vials or other sturdy containers for small finds; dis-
carded plastic 35-millimeter film canisters from photo shops work well, 
as do contact-lens vials from optical shops — and they’re free (though 
they’ve stopped making many of them, so get them fast).
 
 Acid-free paper, paper tags, cardboard boxes of different sizes, and foam 
padding for storing materials.
 
 Acryloid B-72 solution, polyvinyl acetate, acetone, clear nail polish, 
polish remover, Duco cement, and white glue.
 
 Clean sand in a small box or other container to hold drying artifacts 
you’ve glued back together.
 
 Scrap paper, newspaper, rags, towels, and paper towels.
 
 Cafeteria-style trays (or get cardboard beer-crate bottoms at the store).
 
 Mechanical hand tools like screwdrivers, as well as tweezers and a few 
hand tools from excavation, like dental picks and butter knives, to chip 
off hardened dirt from specimens.
 
 Physical lab items such as pipettes or eyedroppers, beakers, and 
magnifying glasses.
 
 Magnet (any size) to see if your decayed old artifact is made of metal.
Fancier equipment: Magnifiers, 
measurers, music
If you spend long hours in the lab, you want fine equipment to do the job well 
under pleasant conditions. Here are some examples of what to have:

138
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
 
 Scale for weighing artifacts: A food scale from the discount store is ade-
quate, or you can spend thousands of dollars on scientific scales that go 
to hundredths of grams. Figure out what your requirements are before 
you commit to an expensive scale.
 
 Calipers and other measuring devices: These instruments can be 
mechanical (cheaper) or digital and battery-operated; again, use your 
personal requirements as a guide.
 
 Magnifying lamps to see tiny stuff.
 
 Microscopes to see even tinier stuff.
 
 Books and other reference guides for identifying materials such as 
shells, animal bones, seeds, and artifact types in your region.
 
 An archaeology lab manual for laying out proper procedures; you often 
update this as you figure what works and doesn’t.
 
 Small refrigerator for fragile specimens, film, and your lunch.
 
 Computer, printer, scanner, and software for data storage and process-
ing, making maps, scanning and processing images and photos, creating 
and manipulating databases, and word-processing.
 
 Map cabinet with big, wide drawers for site and area maps.
 
 Footstool and ladder to get to high shelves.
 
 Radio or CD player for some relaxing music while you work!
A lab crew with tons of patience
Lab work takes some of the same skills as fieldwork, but it requires a differ-
ent set of skills as well. You have to sit for hours happily washing artifacts, 
making maps, or sorting tiny bits of animal, vegetable, and mineral matter 
under the microscope. As in the field, you have to worry about trivial details. 
Otherwise, mistakes creep in and the integrity of your finds is lost.
Many people find lab tasks relaxing. Others find the painstaking work tedious 
and frustrating; they just want to see what something is, not spend forever 
patiently scraping off the encrusted dirt in microscopically thin layers.
 
But wait! You must work slowly on one task at a time. If you lose the knowl-
edge that came in with the artifact or if you forget which bag you took an 
unnumbered specimen from, your find is worthless! The provenience data (all 
the information about where something came from) is the most important 
information you process. See Chapters 6 and 7 for more on bagging and tag-
ging artifacts during survey and excavation, respectively.

139
 Chapter 9: Processing Excavated Materials in the Laboratory
 
You want a lab crew of mellow folks who can help each other keep track of 
things. The ideal is to have the field crew become the lab crew — that way, 
crew members won’t wonder about how or why something came in a certain 
way from the field. Until you actually process materials from your first dig, 
you can’t imagine how much information is lost in bringing excavated materi-
als and information from field to lab!
Processing Excavated Materials
You should clean, stabilize or repair (if needed), catalogue, identify and clas-
sify, measure, and photograph (if desired) archaeological materials before 
you store them. Doing these things all at once to avoid repeatedly taking 
artifacts in and out of bags reduces error and damage to the specimens, but 
most labs don’t have the room or the labor to do this.
Cleaning artifacts and ecofacts
 
Don’t wash finds in the sink, where mud will instantly clog up the drain (even if 
you have a sand trap)! Tubs of water and old toothbrushes work fine, and you 
can dump the dirty water outside when you’re done. Here are some hints on 
cleaning:
 
 Gently brush stone and other hard materials underwater so you don’t 
splash drops of muddy water everywhere.
 
 Prehistoric unglazed ceramics may be cleanable by just holding them 
underwater and rubbing them gently with fingers, though the broken 
edges may need brushing to see the temper mixed with the clay or to 
clean surfaces that can be glued to other pieces.
 
 Only brush shells and hard bone if necessary, and with a very soft 
brush.
 
 Try cleaning softer bone by dry-brushing or brief immersion; it may be 
too fragile to clean at all.
 
 Chip rusted iron with small metal tools to get the rust chunks off, but be 
careful because the artifacts may be quite fragile. Some pieces may be 
rusted through so that you have nothing left to clean!
 
 Either rinse or gently dry-brush perishables such as bone, wood, feath-
ers, leather, cloth, and other organics; they may also need immediate 
conservation, soaking in preservative solutions, drying, or keeping wet, 
depending on the material.

140
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
 
Needless to say, you have to be careful no matter what you’re cleaning, or you 
can end up losing information or ruining an artifact:
 
 Don’t dump a whole bag of artifacts into the water. As it gets muddier, 
you won’t see everything, and tiny items can be forgotten and mixed in 
with the next bag’s stuff.
 
 Don’t scrub a soft artifact and make new patterns on it with your brush.
 
 Don’t wash something if it looks fragile.
 
 Don’t clean an artifact if you see some deposits on it that may indicate 
what it was used for. DNA analysis of blood on a stone tool can deter-
mine what animal species it came from. Residues on pots can reveal 
what substances the containers held.
 
 Don’t lose track of what you’re doing. As you wash finds, lay them out 
separately by provenience to dry — with their bags and information — 
on newspaper in trays or in a drying rack (stack of wooden-sided box 
screens). Artifacts separated from their provenience data are worthless.
Conserving or restoring the materials
You want to prevent your finds from disintegrating; you may go further and 
restore them. The following sections give you an overview of how to con-
serve your artifacts and decide on the extra step of restoration.
Conservation
Stone, ceramics, and other hard materials are usually okay after cleaning, 
though you want to soak the salt out of anything excavated from salt water.
 
Preservative solutions help for crumbling potsherds or bone. Museum cura-
tors use Acryloid B-72 and polyvinyl acetate (PVA), two chemicals that can 
(supposedly) be removed, to stabilize delicate items. If you can’t get these 
products, a thin solution of Duco cement and acetone (nail polish remover 
without the oils and scents) or white glue (make sure it has PVA) and water 
can work. I try not to use chemicals if possible; they can damage the potential 
for radiocarbon dating, bone mineral analysis, or other materials studies.
Rusty metal may rust more without quick treatment. If enough of the object 
remains intact, you can put it into an electrolysis bath, where electricity 
draws corrosion out; this process works for silver and other metals too. 
Waterlogged wooden artifacts can sit in a warm bath of polyethylene glycol 
(PEG) that eventually replaces the water in the wood and conserves the 
object.

141
 Chapter 9: Processing Excavated Materials in the Laboratory
 
Materials often have to sit for months in these baths, so they can take up 
space in your lab. The chemicals required may be hazardous, so get expert 
advice before you do such conservation! Be sure you follow a specific safety 
plan in handling, storing, and cleaning up after using chemicals.
Preservation versus restoration
I mention in Chapter 7 that archaeologists and heritage specialists argue 
about reconstructing a site versus restoring it or preserving it as is. This 
debate also applies to artifact conservation.
 
Different actions depend on different goals. Do you put the artifact back 
together and fill in the missing parts as well as you can with some modern 
material? Or do you just stabilize it as is and prevent future decay? 
Reconstructing an artifact to show how it may have looked for an exhibit may 
be great for interpreting the past. Preserving it with minimal treatment may 
allow it to be studied further by chemical and other analyses in the future.
I can tell you that gluing sherds of a pot back together is great for the photo 
but it makes fitting the pot back in the box or narrow drawer harder. Plus, if 
different sherds came from different proveniences, you have to make all those 
additional notes in the catalog to account for what happened to each sherd.
Examining the soil samples
You may have lugged back to the lab all those bags of soil you took as sam-
ples to undergo the flotation process, which I describe in Chapter 7. Putting 
these soils through water and fine screens, you can recover lots of very tiny 
stuff that gives you new ideas about your site.
 
Smaller soil samples for permanent storage or future study can just be boxed 
up and put on the shelf. Let them dry out first so that they’re less likely to 
grow mold. Soil is heavy, so don’t put too many soil samples in a box, or you 
won’t be able to lift it! And make sure you don’t put the heavy stuff on the 
highest shelf! Not only can it fall on you, but also it’s also harder to retrieve.
Cataloguing and numbering
After everything’s clean, you can catalog all your finds and number them so 
that provenience information is clear and won’t be lost.

142
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
Cataloguing
Several tasks come under the heading of cataloguing:
 
 Updating your field catalog with any new information discovered in the 
lab. For example, you may find that what you thought was a stone chip 
is really a finished stone tool. (I describe this process in Chapter 7 and 
give you an example of the form in Figure 6-1 in Chapter 6.)
 
 Doing individual catalog sheets for each bag from each provenience — 
listing all the materials in each now that they’re clean and you can see 
what they are. You may also list weights, measurements, other attributes.
 
 Assigning numbers to each item if needed. These can be put into a com-
puter database as well if they’re not in one already.
 
 Writing the provenience/catalog number on each item.
Numbering archaeological materials
Assigning numbers depends on what system you’re working in. You may 
just keep whatever numbers you already used in the field, such as the site 
number first, then additional numbers in sequence.
Many museums and other institutions require that artifacts be labeled with 
long accession numbers that are then put into a huge catalog book or data-
base with directions to understand what those numbers mean! Some catalog 
numbers include the year and a lot number assigned to a large body of arti-
facts. Some even include additional code numbers to indicate what kind of 
material it is (stone, bone, ceramic, and so on). Many collections are now on 
a computerized bar-code system.
Writing catalog numbers right on the materials is crucial — if you misplace 
the items, you always know the provenience. Here’s how to do it:
 
 The standard is to write with indelible black (india) ink and quill pens 
with metal tips. Writing on stone and other hard materials wears out a 
pen quickly, so metal tips are important. Some labs use fine-point felt-tip 
waterproof pens, but they wear out almost instantly and are expensive.
 
 For dark materials that won’t show black ink, use indelible white ink and 
a pen dedicated only to white writing so that your inks don’t mix.
 
 Wipe and clean pens as you go along so they don’t clog up.
 
 Some lab directors like to paint a swath of clear nail polish, white paint, 
or even white correction fluid on the artifact and write the number on 
this patch. I think this tactic looks sloppy, and it can sometimes chip off 
more easily than just an inked number.
 
 However, for porous materials such as some ceramics, you may need to 
make a solid surface to write on. In this case, clear nail polish is best — 
just paint a small area, let it dry completely, and then write the number.

143
 Chapter 9: Processing Excavated Materials in the Laboratory
 
 Write the number in an unobtrusive place on the artifact, like the back-
side that probably won’t be photographed, so that you don’t cover up 
its important features. This guideline also holds if you’re slapping on a 
bar code sticker.
 
 Always write numbers over newspaper or scrap paper, and have the 
acetone handy for spills. A tipped bottle of indelible ink can make a per-
manent mess! Be sure to let the ink dry before you put stuff away.
 
 For artifacts that just can’t be written on (such as a rusty iron object), 
use a paper tag tied on with string or some other secure method for 
numbering.
 
 Many labs don’t write numbers on their thousands of specimens until 
they get them out to study them because it takes so much time and 
labor (and the number is on the container anyway). But numbering 
every item so that you never lose proveniences is an important profes-
sional practice.
 
 Work with one bag of artifacts at a time. I can’t stress enough how 
important it is to keep artifacts with their own provenience information.
Classifying artifacts by types
After you’ve cleaned and numbered your artifacts, lay out everything and see 
what you’ve got. You may be able to easily identify them by raw material or 
general artifact type.
 
After the general initial identification, you get into the classic archaeological 
practice of using artifact typologies. These are guides established in specific 
geographic areas that list each type of artifact associated with that area. A 
good typology has non-overlapping criteria so you can sort things into clear 
categories. But many typologies aren’t well developed. (For example, type 
1 may be painted black and type 2 painted red, but now you’ve excavated a 
piece with both red and black paint, for which no type name exists). You may 
need to establish a new type, or just describe your item by noting the closest 
known type it resembles. You see this dilemma in real life if you try to classify 
someone else’s stuff — is this a serving plate or a wall decoration? An expen-
sive brand-name watch or a cheap fake?
Here’s how you can make preliminary identifications and then do the 
research to refine them based on different materials:
 
 Chipped stone tools can be unifacial (flaked on one side) or bifacial 
(flaked on both sides). Bifaces can be projectile points (often called 
arrowheads even though they’re usually spear points) or knives or 
choppers or other types. You can usually find regional guides to 
chipped-stone tool types. The type names sometimes show the first 
sites where they were found (like Agate Basin points, from a Wyoming 

144
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
site), or combine that with some name based on appearance (my favor-
ite here being the Susquehanna Broad, a wide projectile point named 
after a New York river valley).
 
 The flakes left from manufacturing these stone tools are the lithic deb-
itage. They’re also classified in many ways. Primary flakes have some of 
the outer stone still on them. Secondary flakes are the inner, presumably 
better material, and usually flatter. You can subdivide further from there 
too, based on size, color, and type of raw stone material. You also want 
to tell whether the stone has been thermally altered (heated) to make it 
easier to chip. Many guides to studying debitage can help you.
 
 Ground-stone artifacts, meaning they were smoothed rather than 
chipped, can be axes, mortars and pestles, bowls, beads, statues, and 
many other things. These finds are usually easier to classify based on 
published regional typologies.
 
 Prehistoric pottery typologies abound in archaeology! Dedicated work-
ers pore over broken bits of everyday kitchen ware. Some potsherds are 
easy to classify into types established for the region. Their decoration, 
whether molded into the wet clay, painted on, or otherwise, will be easy 
to see. For plain sherds (or maybe all sherds), you want to describe 
what is called the paste, meaning the clay itself and the temper material 
it was mixed with. Ceramic type names often reflect their appearance 
and the place or site where they were first recorded, such as “Rockport 
Black” (Texas, painted with natural asphalt) or “McGraw Cordmarked” 
(Ohio, impressed with twisted cords before firing).
 
 Metal artifacts are first classified by raw material if possible. You’ll know 
iron because of its magnetic properties and gold because it never tar-
nishes. After that, classification gets more complicated, so you’ll want 
special expertise and guidebooks to what’s usually found in your region. 
Look for detailed typologies for iron nails of all time periods, sizes, and 
shapes; for brass decorative items and jewelry in different parts of the 
world; and for parts of lamps, guns, swords, machines, and anything you 
can think of made of metal. If you’re lucky, your metal artifact is a coin 
with its identification stamped right on it!
 
 Wood, bone, shell, and other materials may have decayed too much to 
identify, so you may have to list them as worked fragments (as opposed 
to ecofacts, which weren’t shaped into artifacts). But you can identify a 
pointed bone pin, engraved piece, basket fragment, or shell bead.
 
 Historic crockery, such as earthenware (softer), stoneware (harder), 
china, and so on, is well described in many guides (even antiques 
manuals). Some tips for identifying it: Porcelain is translucent, and real 
Chinese porcelain is thinner and more finely decorated than English imi-
tations. If you have the bottom of the vessel, you can even read manu-
facturers’ marks.

145
 Chapter 9: Processing Excavated Materials in the Laboratory
 
 Historic materials of glass and other substances are classified in many 
guides. First you can sort them by color and then by shape into bottles, 
jars, bowls, and so forth as well as tell if they’re machine-made (with 
regular mold marks) or hand-blown (less symmetrical and regular). For 
historic metal, glass, and many other items, old Sears catalogs are great 
to get identifications!
Look online for more typologies and guides for classifying artifacts. But also 
realize that (especially for prehistoric artifacts) archaeologists constantly 
argue about whether the typologies they use today reflect the ways that the 
past people who made the artifacts would have classified them. This contro-
versy shouldn’t concern you too much — at least you have a system to use to 
study these material bits of the past!
Classifying ecofacts and other materials
Biological and geological specimens you’ve brought back from the dig are 
often much easier to classify. You can tell shell from bone from pebble from 
soil. For more precise classification, get guides to various species’ shells or 
skeletons, or call for help from specialists such as zooarchaeologists (who 
study animal remains from archaeological sites), ethnobotanists (who study 
archaeological plant remains), and geologists. I discuss these specialties 
more in Chapter 10.
 
Granulometric analysis means soils are classified by grain size — large, 
medium, and small are sand, silt, and clay, respectively. Mixtures of these 
grain sizes create different kinds of loam. Official soils manuals can help you 
determine what kinds of soil grains you have. You can also get a set of geologi-
cal screens and sift your soil through them to see what proportions of what 
grain sizes you have.
Different kinds of soils are deposited in different ways, so you can find out 
about the site formation processes at your excavation. (I discuss site forma-
tion processes more in Chapter 2). Fast water deposits sand, and very fast, 
large volumes of water can dump loads of clean white sand — good evidence 
in your stratigraphy of a big storm or hurricane!
Coprolites are a cool kind of ecofact to study. They’re dried up old pieces of 
excrement, or fossilized feces (say that ten times fast!) They’re seldom pre-
served, but you’ll know them when you see them. A good zooarchaeologist 
can tell whether a coprolite is human or animal, and sometimes what spe-
cies of animal. Coprolites have tons of information about the individual from 
whom they came (diet, DNA), but they must be stored carefully.

Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
Weighing, measuring, and other recording
For every artifact and ecofact, you may want to record the weight, color, 
length, and other measurements. Be sure to describe particular markings or 
other attributes — you may even sketch the item or put it on the scanner to 
have its picture taken and added to the catalog. You may be doing a hand-
written catalog sheet or a computer database entry or both. Remember to 
copy information carefully — the more times you transfer numbers into vari-
ous records, the more chances you have for error.
 
Other tests and little tricks are useful to collect information about archaeologi-
cal materials. A historic archaeologist I know swears he can tell various types 
of crockery by licking them! To see whether the little white chunks in your 
potsherd are really crushed shell temper you can drop acid on them — put a 
drop of hydrochloric acid, and if the white stuff fizzles, it’s shell or limestone. 
The list goes on, but you get the idea! Your lab director and standard archae-
ology laboratory texts will have all these hints.
Sorting flotation remains
After you’ve processed your soil samples through the flotation barrel 
(described in Chapter 7) and come up with little piles of stuff that finally 
dried, you’re far from done. You need to sort the recovered remains into 
the same categories of artifacts and ecofacts and include them in the counts 
from each provenience. You may have large materials in the heavy fraction 
(the largest-mesh screen, probably the @@bf1/4-inch). The light fraction (from the 
finest screen) may have tiny charred seeds, fish or rodent bones, beads, and 
maybe bug cases and tiny modern roots. You need a microscope or at least a 
magnifying glass to see and sort everything. You may want to save any char-
coal you pull out for radiocarbon dating.
Tweezers or wooden sticks are good tools for sorting dried flotation remains 
that you’ve poured out onto a tray. Sewing needles jammed (using pliers) 
into the tops of chopsticks are also useful here. You can pick up little char-
coal bits with static cling by using very fine paintbrushes.
As you sort the fine remains, you separate each kind (seed, shell, stone, etc.) 
into different tiny bags or vials, possibly many for each provenience. Label 
each container with the provenience, and put it all together with the bigger 
stuff to get the whole picture.

147
 Chapter 9: Processing Excavated Materials in the Laboratory
Processing Information and Paperwork
Along with all the material things you need to take care of, your archaeologi-
cal excavation data are very much in need of attention in the lab after the dig. 
You usually have both electronic data and piles of paper, and possibly infor-
mation in other media such as film.
Maps
Regardless of whether you’re using a paper or electronic map (or both). 
you still need a well-drafted map for publication, one that fits on a page in 
whatever report you’re writing. You may want a huge map of the whole site, 
close-up maps of each unit and its features, or even three-dimensional images 
of the strata and materials in each unit. You may do GIS (geographic infor-
mation systems) layers for materials and attributes of your site, to see what 
they look like when overlaid. (Did all the examples of one type of artifact 
come from the place of the highest elevation?)
Other records
Putting your catalog of all materials recovered from the site onto a computer 
database or spreadsheet includes putting in all the accompanying informa-
tion. Then you can sort for various things you want to know (discussed 
more in Chapter 10), like a table of all the stone artifacts. You may scan or 
transcribe individual workers’ field notes into a word-processing program for 
future use. You may have many other paper records to put into electronic 
format:
 
 Field forms and photo logs, unit floor and wall stratigraphy drawings, 
and feature drawings
 
 Notes from other participants or visitors
 
 Information from local collectors about their collections and photos of 
their artifacts
 
 Historic or environmental records of interest for your site
 
 Catalogs and data from previous people’s investigations at your site
 
 Business cards and information on important places near your site, such 
as the hardware store, the best coffeehouse, and the bar

148
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
 
Don’t forget to back up all computer work every day! Losing your data is like 
bulldozing your site!
Preliminary documentation
In Chapter 10 I show you how to analyze your finds and information, and in 
Chapter 11 you see how to put it all together to report on your dig. But right 
when you get back from the dig and into the lab, you may want to send out 
some preliminary news. Supporters, volunteers, donors, and workers on your 
project all like to know how it’s going. A summary of your excavation work 
may even include photos of artifacts washed and glued back together.
 
Don’t forget to write thank-you notes to supporters as well. This is also 
important for collectors who’ve shared their data (and if you want to publish 
their names or photos of their artifacts, be sure you write them again to ask 
permission).
 
You may want to create or update a Web site on the project to share informa-
tion. You can even include a discussion board.
Curation and Collections Management
Proper storage and research facilities are necessary for archaeological speci-
mens and records. Curation means not only storage of collections but also 
making them available for future investigations. So you need to have the 
space, the facilities, the staff, and the supplies.
Taking care of your collections: 
They’re forever
 
Curation is a huge responsibility, but you take it on when you dig up the stuff 
in the first place. It’s a lot like having kids — if you want them, you’ve got 
to care for them! Archaeological materials are non-renewable resources. If 
they’re lost or destroyed, they’re forever gone. You want to curate them, as 
the standards usually say, in perpetuity.
Standards and supplies
I recommend that you look at published curation guidelines, such as U.S. 
government standards (“Curation of Federally Owned and Administered 
Archaeological Collections” or 36 CFR 79) or individual states’ standards, 

149
 Chapter 9: Processing Excavated Materials in the Laboratory
available online. You can also find companies that sell everything from 
archival-quality supplies (like acid-free paper) to giant rolling space-saver 
cabinets for collections storage and easy access. The whole point is to store 
the materials in ways that they won’t degrade. This includes paper archives. 
Maps can be redone on mylar (a plastic that doesn’t decay as fast).
You can put electronic versions of all your data on CDs, but always back 
them up, not only with paper copies but also some other medium, such as a 
flash drive. As quickly as technology changes, you may not even be able to 
use today’s common format in the future! I still have lots of data on floppy 
disks (remember those ancient artifacts?), but few computers now read 
them.
Research protocols
Collections management also means facilitating future research with your 
materials and data. You should always keep a few tables empty in the lab 
to have space for boxes of specimens that someone wants to get out and 
study. Many museums have spaces dedicated to visiting researchers, with 
photographic stands and everything. Such visitors may want to compare 
your finds with theirs, take different kinds of measurements, or study them 
with new techniques or instruments. Fancier places keep piles of thin white 
cotton gloves to wear for handling artifacts that body oils can damage. Many 
museums and other artifact repositories have strict research protocols list-
ing steps you need to complete in order to get permission to study their col-
lections and procedures you must follow during the study.
Some archaeology labs have enough labor and expertise to begin putting 
all their collections in electronic format (with photos) and online for any 
researcher to use. This is a wonderful development and should result in 
much good future investigation. Having the photos online has also helped 
when thefts have happened — everyone can see what’s been stolen and 
watch for it to show up with dealers or in artifact shows or auction Web sites!
The ethics of collections management
 
It’s unethical to excavate and then not care for the materials and informa-
tion recovered. On government projects, it’s illegal too! Unfortunately, you 
never see archaeology adventure movies with characters who sit and number 
artifacts all day. It’s just not considered the exciting part of archaeology even 
though it takes usually ten times as long as excavation! Another misfortune is 
that collections curation and management also receive far less grant funding 
and public support.

150
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
 
So my final note about laboratory work is this: You just have to do it. Many 
have called it archaeology’s “dirty little secret” that stuff gets excavated and 
then stuffed onto the shelf and ignored forever after, like Indiana Jones’s lost 
ark. Doing the digging and then not processing, studying, and caring for the 
materials and data is no better than looting. And if you don’t do the work 
sooner rather than later, you can lose a lot. I remember reading the autobiog-
raphy of a famous 20th-century archaeologist who said she dug a site, put the 
materials in wooden boxes on the shelf, and was unable to get back to them 
for about ten years. By that time, termites had eaten all the boxes. So every-
thing all fell together in one big pile. With all provenience information lost, her 
work was worthless!
Future collections research
In archaeology, you often have the opportunity 
to do further research on older archaeologi-
cal collections. If materials are well cared-for, 
you can continue to study them in the future, 
especially when a new technique or instrument 
comes along.
Good collections management is just as much 
part of archaeological research as excavation. 
For example, with the advent of AMS (accel-
erator mass spectrometry) radiocarbon dating, 
where you only need a tiny bit of charcoal to get 
a date, many old collections of plant remains 
were examined again. Tiny charred fragments 
of domesticated species could be directly dated, 
and they proved that domestication took place 
earlier than expected. Crusted-on deposits 
scraped off old ceramics weren’t only dated but 
also examined for chemical composition to see 
what had been cooked or brewed in those pots!

n Chapter 9, I cover how to wash your finds and then label, photograph, 
measure, weigh, and record them, and put them in curation-quality bags 
and boxes with proveniences written on them. That’s a lot to do — you may 
think you’ve spent longer processing the materials and data than the time 
that all the stuff sat in the ground! At least now your work is finally finished, 
right? Wrong. The real science is just beginning. But the next steps ramp up 
the excitement because new discovery is equally possible in the laboratory.
This chapter gives you the steps for analyzing your materials. Then you can 
see their relationships in time, space, and activity. They have a lot to say to 
you (but don’t hold the artifact up to your ear to listen; that never works).
Documenting How Finds Occur 
in Space and Time
If you’ve already been entering your information into a computer database 
as you collect it, this step may be easier and faster — until the computer 
crashes. Always make backups! By now, you have a list of what has come 
from each provenience. Next, you want to make new lists of different kinds 
of artifacts by provenience and of all the artifacts in each large (and then 
smaller) provenience — say all the pottery sherds in Excavation Unit 1, listed 
according to the depth, level, or stratum where you found them.

152
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
 
Remember, provenience is all the information on exactly where the item came 
from, in three-dimensional space, including the date of the find and name of 
the finder. It’s one of the most important concepts in archaeology. If you lose 
it, your finds are scientifically useless! So take special care to keep track of 
proveniences in the lab as well as during the fieldwork.
Making charts of finds
Artifact tables take many forms, but they all show (in a logical fashion) what 
you’ve dug up. If you’re an accountant, or even if you just balance your 
checkbook on your computer, you know making these kinds of tables with a 
spreadsheet or database program is pretty easy. With this system, sorting by 
row or column is fast and shows you the information you’re trying to extract 
from the pile of data. In the old days, archaeologists spent hours creating 
these tables by hand. A few holdouts still do it this way; other old-fashioned 
scholars know they can just ask a typical computer-savvy student to do it.
Charting finds in horizontal space
To see what’s different in separate horizontal areas of your site, you want a 
grand list for each artifact type, showing how many you found and where — 
the numbers and proveniences across the site. For example, Table 10-1 lists 
each pottery type in the first column; other columns show the number (N) 
of sherds (broken pieces) of each type, their weights (Wt) in grams for each 
provenience, and the totals. The columns (Units 1, 2, and 3 and Surface) are 
different horizontal spaces, and each row shows an artifact type. Variations 
among columns tell you that different activities may have taken place across 
your site, identifying activity areas. This kind of table doesn’t yet show verti-
cal space (the different depths of sherds in each unit). Because it shows num-
bers, however, the table gives you quantitative data to work with.
Right away, you can tell a few cool things from this table. The fancier pottery, 
with incised lines, stamped patterns, and red paint, is rare except in Unit 3. 
If this unit is, say, near the mound or temple, you may suggest that the deco-
rated pottery (especially the red ware) is for ceremonial uses, and the plain 
stuff is for everyday use. You can also see by the weights compared with 
the numbers that the red sherds are bigger. Maybe they’re less broken and 
stomped-around with the everyday garbage and so are more special.
If you tabulate the other artifacts, animal bones, and other ecofacts (natural 
objects used by people but not made into artifacts) in this fashion, you may 
find a bigger pattern. If animal bones from certain species are also only found 
in Unit 3 with the more special ceramics, this pattern may indicate special 
animal foods used only in that area — maybe ritual feasts using those fancier 
decorated pots. Think about your family holidays; when else does Grandma 
bust out the turkey, cranberry sauce, and fancy china? For everyday dinners 
at your house, you have more utilitarian dishes and foods.

Putting amounts and weights of each artifact type sometimes helps you 
see other trends, especially when you’re dealing with broken items such as 
ceramics. Dividing the weights by the numbers of each type gives you the 
average weight per specimen, which is significantly greater for some types 
than for others. In Table 10-1, the weights of the red sherds average about 10 
grams each, but weights of the other types average about 4 grams. However, 
even the plain stuff is large in Unit 3. This may indicate a more special area 
where all the pots were used more carefully rather than kicked around.
From your historical research you may know that pots and other artifacts 
were ritually broken into just a few pieces after a feast, so you can hypoth-
esize that you found evidence of this custom in the prehistoric past too. 
Making additional tables showing the percentages (both by number and by 
weight) within the rows, the columns, or the entire table also helps you to 
see such patterns. For example, 97 percent of the red sherds at the whole site 
came from Unit 3, but within Unit 3, only 38 percent of the sherds were of the 
red type.
Charting finds in vertical space
After charting sideways in space, now you must go up and down. The way 
different artifacts are distributed in vertical space in each test unit can show 
how styles and activities change through time. For this kind of study, you 
need carefully controlled information, with all depths measured. You can’t 
use artifacts that came from disturbed places like the ground surface. You 
may have excavated in arbitrary levels, like 10 centimeters at a time, or in 
the cultural or natural strata (layers) that were visible in the ground. (See 
Chapter 7 for more explanation of these). Now you can tabulate your finds 
according to these levels or strata.

154
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
Remember, you can assume artifacts buried deeper are older (unless you see 
signs of disturbance), so you can arrange your table something like Table 
10-2, with the artifact type names on the left and the shallowest level or 
stratum as the first column. Then you continue toward the right of the table 
to get a visual representation of your artifact distribution going downward 
through those levels or strata and see what artifacts are earlier or later than 
others and what other types came from the same depths.

In Table 10-2, you can see the real differences from the shallowest material 
to the deepest because you’ve carefully excavated in 20-centimeter (8-inch) 
levels. Level 3, the deepest and earliest, shows more plain pots and stamped 
pots were in use during that time. On the other hand, the red ceramics are 
pretty rare in Level 3 but grow in numbers through time to become the 
main find in Level 1 (the latest). From this information, you can hypothesize 
that painting pottery red was a later development, maybe associated with 
increased ceremonial feasts (if the animal bones follow a similar pattern).
Of course, you’re making a lot of assumptions here. You’re assuming that
 
 You have a representative sample of all the pottery at the site
 
 The sample wasn’t disturbed or mixed by burrowing rodents
 
 Your lab workers have counted everything accurately instead of goofing 
off all day
But at least you have a nice hypothesis you can test with the next excavation.
Using bar charts
A good way to quickly show the information in your tables is with charts and 
graphs. Figure 10-1 shows what a bar chart of Table 10-2 may look like.

155
 Chapter 10: Studying and Analyzing What You’ve Excavated

If you put the deepest level at the bottom of the chart, you can instantly see 
the increase in red pottery through time.
Another bar-chart option consists of listing artifact types across the top and 
time on the side, and centering the bars under each type to give what are 
called battleship-shaped curves (because they supposedly look like the shape 
of a battleship from above). These charts more easily show changes in the 
popularity of different artifact types and styles.
Figure 10-2 shows this kind of chart with a much bigger ceramic assemblage. 
Starting at 1200 (your earliest date), you see that type 4 is already the most 
popular and that type 2 is just starting to be used. In fact, type 2 never 
gets much use, and the peak of its popularity (its widest bar) is right before 
1250. By that time, type 4 is dwindling, and type 3 is coming into use. By 
1275, type 1 is invented and soon takes over in even greater frequency: It 
peaks at 1350 but is still in widespread use by 1400 (the latest date you have 
for your site), a time when the other types have mostly disappeared. You 
can graph any artifact type this way — even artifact attributes such as skirt 
lengths or tail fins on car models — to show increasing and decreasing 
popularity.

Making discoveries during 
the laboratory analysis
Your exciting findings in the lab can rival the thrill of uncovering a long-lost 
artifact in the field (and you won’t be as dirty in the lab). By organizing your 
data in tables and graphs, you get a picture of the different activities in space 
and changes through time at your site.
 
Table 10-1 suggests that fancier ceramics indicate special behavior in the 
area of Unit 3. Further evidence for this idea may come when you see other 
unusual artifacts or animal bones in the same location. They all may show 
ritual activity not seen elsewhere at the site. Other patterns may jump out at 
you from the charts. For example, the deeper levels of Unit 3 don’t have as 

157
 Chapter 10: Studying and Analyzing What You’ve Excavated
much special stuff, but Table 10-2 shows that the shallower levels do. This pat-
tern may mean that the ritual behavior began later in time.
Putting your finds onto your map
A good map is crucial for seeing how the artifacts and other data behave at 
an archaeological site. You already have the map you made during fieldwork 
showing geographic features (streams, hills) and your excavation units and 
surface collection areas. Now it’s time to add on the new information you’ve 
extracted from the artifact and ecofact assemblages. Many simple computer 
graphics programs (or even the word-processing program you used to make 
the bar chart) can draw distribution maps, or you can do them by hand.
On a two-dimensional page it’s hard to show the three-dimensional space of 
the archaeological site, but a series of maps can do this. Figure 10-3 is a typi-
cal site map with a north arrow, a scale, and contour lines showing how the 
land rises or falls — in this case, in half-meter (20-inch) increments or con-
tour intervals; you can see the slope down to the river. It shows the mound 
and the excavation units, and I’ve put different symbols to show the distribu-
tions of four types of pottery across the site. This method is another quick 
way to show activity areas or other information. The red sherds cluster close 
to the temple mound, so they may be for ceremonial purposes.
 
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is just a fancy way of piling on maps 
with layers of data to see the whole picture in vertical and horizontal space. 
Archaeologists used to draw it all on clear sheets they could lay on top of 
each other. Now they do it electronically and save time for other activities 
(like further analyses, or that coffee shop down the road).
An example of two GIS layers at your site or survey area may show both 
activity areas across the land and change through time vertically. Figure 10-3 
demonstrates one of these layers, showing all pottery across the site. You 
can make separate maps for each level excavated and for all the other types 
of finds besides pottery. You can add more layers showing soil types or other 
natural features too, to reveal additional information
All kinds of computer programs — some written specifically for archaeologi-
cal analysis — can map different characteristics of your data. Certain 
artifacts, feature types, or soil types may cluster more in one area or be 
associated with certain other artifacts. Plus, such maps also show gaps. If 
you should’ve dug in one place that was near the coolest stuff and you didn’t, 
this fact will also jump out at you after you get a finished map.

Analyzing Specific Materials: Stone, 
Ceramics, Bone, and Metal
After your artifact information and other data are mapped out in space and 
time, you’re ready to see what new things you can add to all of it. You prob-
ably used classification systems already established for the artifacts in your 
area to sort the specimens in the lab. You can get even more out of them by 
looking at more specific attributes in their form, what they’re made of, and 
other characteristics that may show how their original owners used them.

159
 Chapter 10: Studying and Analyzing What You’ve Excavated
When you classified all your potsherds according to the established types in 
Table 10-1, you used the criteria of where you found them (in the Coldwater 
Creek region) and what their surface decoration was (none, stamped, incised, 
or painted).
 
The typologies (classification systems, discussed more in Chapter 9) for any 
given area were probably established by the first archaeologists to dig there 
and write a report. Archaeologists set up and refine artifact typologies all the 
time. They have to organize everything, so they make up these categories. 
Further work may help to improve these categories (or even to show that the 
original typology does not work well — the basis for many arguments).
Basic analyses
To see additional variability among your artifacts, you can pick other attri-
butes of shape, style, or decoration that may be significant. You do this at 
home all the time when you put your stuff away in an orderly fashion (even 
if sometimes you can’t remember where you put it). So when you can’t find 
the big holiday serving platter with the other platters, you remember you 
put it in the bigger cupboard, with bigger items like the barbecue tongs and 
ice bucket, where it could fit. Size is the meaningful attribute here and not a 
common function of all the artifacts grouped together in the big cupboard.
For your excavated ceramic assemblage, you may look at vessel shapes and 
rim decorations. If the Coldwater Creek red-painted sherds, unlike the others, 
are mostly from big vessels that, by the angle of the rim, seem to be open 
platters, they’re probably more likely to be serving plates, whereas the other 
ceramics are for cooking or storing. If serving food is more important at ritual 
feasts, more of the red plates may break in the feasting area as opposed to 
another part of the site. Again, doing such exercises means putting more data 
on tables, measuring rim angles, and so forth. So yes, you have to take finds 
out of their bags again, lay them all out on the table, and do something else 
with them. Good thing you have them all numbered by provenience so they 
don’t get back into the wrong bags!
Use wear and residues on artifacts
Characteristics to look for on your artifacts are things that show how they 
were changed or damaged from use (called use wear). Look at your shoes; 
the soles are probably worn unevenly from walking in a particular way, and 
maybe the back of the heel of your right shoe is worn because you lay it on 
the floor while you’re driving. This kind of evidence helps you see artifact 
function. You swear it’s use wear!

160
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
Use-wear studies are common with stone tools, where scraping or cutting 
dulls and scratches the sharp edges. Other materials can show use wear 
or even breakage patterns that may demonstrate what they were used for. 
From experimental archaeology (making new evidence to find out about past 
materials), archaeologists have discovered some different patterns under the 
microscope that indicate scraping versus cutting, and so forth. You can imag-
ine an archaeologist hammering out a fresh flint blade and then using it to cut 
500 pieces of rope, 500 bits of meat, or 500 globs of fat, and then observing 
and photographing the edges (and also cleaning up the mess)!
What artifacts are made of
Another attribute that differs among artifacts of the same type is the raw 
material they’re made of. Sometimes this characteristic is easy to tell by 
sight. Here are a few examples:
 
 Local flint for chipped stone tools may be one color, and exotic stone 
may be other colors.
 
 Shell tools can be made from shells of different species gathered in dif-
ferent regions.
 
 You can sometimes classify bone tools such as hooks or pins accord-
ing to the type of animal bone used, perhaps even to the species level. 
Sometimes even animal DNA can answer such questions.
 
 Pottery may be of different-colored clays, but a more distinguishing 
characteristic is the temper, which can be crushed stone or shell, sand, 
plant fibers, and even fired clay from other pots (smashed in a fit of 
temper). The temper mixed with the clay may show a specific tradition 
of craftwork from a local area or time period.
Coming soon to a lab near you
You may remember that a crucial piece of 
evidence for nailing the Unabomber was his 
DNA left on a postage stamp on one of the 
bomb packages he mailed. Everything humans 
do (including stamp-licking) leaves residues, 
though some are larger than others. With fancy 
physics and chemistry, scientists can analyze 
baked-on food in pots, dried liquids in jars (even 
ancient wine), and chemicals used to embalm 
mummies. Some specialists are identifying 
bloodstains on stone tools by DNA analysis so 
they can tell what species of animal was hunted 
(or even whether human blood was involved).
These tests are all very specialized and costly, 
but they’re becoming more common. When 
DNA testing becomes affordable enough, you 
may find it everywhere in archaeology (like you 
do in crime-scene TV). Physical and chemical 
testing to identify materials are also becom-
ing less expensive, or at least more common in 
archaeology.

 Chapter 10: Studying and Analyzing What You’ve Excavated
 
 Metal artifacts are sometimes easily identifiable by their raw materials. 
Iron is frequently so rusted that it becomes a heavy orange glob with 
little form left. (A 500-year-old Spanish iron spike I excavated looked like 
an orange turd until I broke it open and saw the square cross section of 
the spike.) Silver turns black, and copper (as well as brass and bronze, 
that are made with copper) becomes green. Gold, of course, never tar-
nishes — the reason for its great value. If that ring from your loved one 
is making your finger green, it’s not pure gold. Sorry.
Organizing artifact tables to show raw materials can give you cool informa-
tion about economics and interaction (how far folks were going to get what 
stuff). Items made of raw material that had to come from farther away were 
often more valuable; maybe these objects cluster in the ceremonial areas of 
the site. Small amounts of potsherds with uncommon tempers or shapes may 
indicate interaction with people outside the region; maybe the in-laws were 
bringing a covered dish for the holiday.
 
Plotting the distribution of artifact raw materials over large spaces can be 
fascinating. For example, drinking cups of big whelk shell occur all over the 
eastern U.S. in late prehistoric times. A big shell cup in a grave in Ohio clearly 
indicates a long-distance interaction. You can say it was probably trade, but 
other possibilities exist, such as gift-giving, theft, or maybe early midwest-
ern spring-breakers going to the beach and bringing back shell souvenirs. 
Archaeologists do know from early historic times that Native Americans drank 
a ceremonial holly-leaf tea called black drink from shell cups. Finding these 
cups as far away as Ohio means you can trace this custom both deep into 
prehistoric times and widely across space from the Gulf of Mexico, where the 
shell and holly leaves originated.
Don’t try these at home
Today, archaeology uses other sciences more 
than ever. So, beyond what you can see of dif-
ferent raw materials, you can actually use other 
methods of determining the origins of an artifact.
Fancy physics such as x-ray fluorescence and 
mass spectrometry can tell the trace elements 
in stone or metal. These are traces of various 
elements distinctive to the region where the 
artifact’s raw material came from. The aver-
age archaeologist doesn’t have the gizmos 
to do these studies in the lab. Just like for 
radiocarbon dating (or dry cleaning), we send 
out the specimens to a specialist service (and 
pay for it). The physicist or chemist can show 
the patterns, and then the archaeologist must 
interpret what they mean. This process is very 
much like your doctor sending you out for an 
x-ray, where the technician is an expert in 
applying the radiation and imaging to your body, 
but the doctor must interpret what the resulting 
picture means.

Special Studies of Archaeological Finds
Though archaeologists don’t do dinosaurs and usually don’t do fossils, they 
sometimes do study bones, both animal and human, as well as soils and plant 
remains at archaeological sites. Many methods allow them to squeeze more 
information (though not blood) out of a bone, shell, seed, or grain of sand.
Animal remains: Zooarchaeology
Doing zooarchaeology, the study of animal remains from archaeological 
sites, means going beyond just identifying all the animal bone bits you have. 
(Remember, here I’m talking about ecofacts, the animal remains used by 
humans but not modified to become artifacts.)
Counting animal bones and shells
 
If you’re lucky enough to have pieces that you can classify by species, you 
may also be lucky enough to tell which element (bone of the body) they all 
are and which side of the body they came from. So two deer leg bones may be 
from just one deer, but if they’re both the same bone in the right front leg, that 
means you have at least two deer. This determination is called obtaining the 
minimum number of individuals (MNI) from each species in your assemblage.
MNI works for shells, too. For example, clams and other bivalves have a top 
and bottom or right and left shell, so you can count how many of each you 
have. After you determine how many of each kind of animal you have, you 
can know what animals your people got the most of.
Stone tools across the Pacific
A neat example of trace element analysis is a 
recent study showing how prehistoric basalt 
adzes (ground-stone tools for cutting wood) 
made of stone originating in Hawaii were dis-
tributed as far as Tahiti and islands of French 
Polynesia. The trace elements in the basalt were 
characteristic of a particular Hawaiian stone 
quarry. Ancient sailors distributed stone from 
this quarry around 2,500 miles of remote Pacific 
islands. This reveals many things, including the 
sophistication of native navigators and their 
craft (all without GPS and radios). They may 
have preferred transporting small heavy stuff 
like stone rather than, say, bulky piles of fruit or 
wooden sculptures — it would make the boat 
more stable. Being able to travel by boat over 
such huge distances a thousand years ago or 
more shows how skilled prehistoric people of 
the Pacific really were.

163
 Chapter 10: Studying and Analyzing What You’ve Excavated
Figuring diet from garbage
If the animals were food, how much food did the people really have of each 
kind? Another calculation is the amount of meat you can get from each kind 
of animal. Zooarchaeologists are always experimental archaeologists; they’re 
always stopping the field vehicle to pick up fresh road kill (if it’s native spe-
cies past people would’ve used). They take sample animals, de-flesh the 
bones, and weigh the meat amounts each yields (a very smelly business). 
Based on the numbers, they can see the contribution of each kind of animal 
to the hypothetical past diet. This information is important because just the 
amount of stuff can be deceiving. A pile of 500 oyster shells is bigger than a 
deer leg bone, but it represents far less actual meat than one deer.
Another caution is that your animal bone assemblage may not tell you only 
or all of what your people ate. They may have thrown all fish bone back in 
the water because it was too smelly, so you never find it in their garbage. Or 
they may have hunted an animal for its fur but not eaten the meat; how many 
modern folks eat mink? Some bone may have been only for making artifacts, 
not from eating the animal. Though you can never be sure of the possibilities, 
you must at least mention them in your reports and interpretations.
Plant remains: Paleoethnobotany
 
Plant remains can tell a story similar to what you get from animal bones and 
shells — what people used for food, tools, homes, and other purposes. But 
plants are more fragile; they’re usually not preserved unless they’ve been 
charred, waterlogged, or dried. The paleoethnobotanist (try saying that ten 
times quickly) is another specialized archaeologist who identifies plant 
remains from archaeological sites and figures out what they mean.
Macrobotanicals
Macrobotanical remains are bigger objects such as seeds, nuts, pieces of 
wood, charcoal from ancient fires, carbonized fruit rinds, rice grains, or corn-
cobs. Even tiny fern spores (which can reveal that the site was in a wooded 
environment) can be identified under a magnifying glass. You need to com-
pare all these with the kinds of plants found off the site area in the region. 
This way, you can see what would have been naturally occurring as com-
pared with what the people at your site brought in or grew there.
Microbotanicals
Microbotanical remains are tiny things like pollen grains so small you need 
a microscope to see them. Pollen is interesting because each plant species 
has a different-shaped grain; if you know the characteristics of the species 

164
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
you identify, you can see what the landscape looked like (aquatic plants, 
trees, non-tree plants). You must be careful to know how much pollen differ-
ent plants put out. If your sample contains more larch pollen than oak, that 
may be because one larch tree produces far more pollen than one oak, not 
because you have a predominantly larch forest. Comparing pollen on-site and 
off-site is also important so you can see what species people brought in.
 
Pollen was used in a modern archaeological-type study to determine the 
authenticity of an antique chair. Residue scraped off the underside of the seat 
of the old chair contained pollen from British trees, showing it to be a real 
antique rather than a later American copy.
 
Absolutely amazing tiny things discovered by botanists and other scientists 
can help archaeologists answer big questions. Phytoliths are tiny mineral 
deposits that form within plant cells as the groundwater runs through them, 
roughly like the mineral deposit left in your teapot from boiling water in it. 
Phytoliths (also called silica bodies or plant opal) have distinctive shapes 
based on the plant species they formed in. They’re often preserved long after 
the plant decays, and they require fancy lab work to separate from the soil. 
Working with phytoliths of corn (maize) and banana, archaeologists have 
been able to see how early these plants became domesticated crops manipu-
lated by ancient people.
Microscopic starch grains are a very new type of archaeological evidence 
just beginning to get attention. They’re also preserved long after the original 
plant decays, so you may find them in residues on tool edges. New starch 
grain evidence in Borneo shows human foragers did complex processing of 
yams and other starchy plants some 40,000 years ago. They figured out how 
to leach out the natural poisons from these plants to make them edible.
Human bones, chemistry, and DNA
 
Human skeletal remains from archaeological sites are very special. They 
can reveal so much more about past people, including social and religious 
aspects of their societies. But bones are surrounded by more sensitive issues 
and subject to various laws, so you may need a permit or special permission 
to excavate them. You must also treat them according to the wishes of the 
descendants of the people they represent, if such descendants can be found.
If you do excavate and study (and sometimes even rebury) human bones 
(respectfully), you can obtain a wealth of information. Besides the kinds of 
burials and grave goods and the treatment of the dead in general, you can 
find out about the individual person’s life.

165
 Chapter 10: Studying and Analyzing What You’ve Excavated
What a skeleton can tell you
Bioarchaeologists (biological anthropologists who study human bones) 
can estimate age and sex of a person from skeletal markers (especially the 
pelvis). They determine how tall someone was by plugging in formulas based 
on length of one leg or arm bone. Some injuries and diseases leave marks 
on bone, as does the stress of hard labor and other factors (like obesity and 
childbirth — also hard labor). Cultural practices such as foot-binding or 
head-flattening from cradle-boards also show up in the skeleton. Dental 
cavities (or caries) show diet and hygiene practices.
When more of a body’s soft tissue is preserved (such as in mummification) 
medical techniques such as x-rays and CAT scans are just as useful as they 
are for living people to see details — diseases, parasites, traumas, and even 
the cause of death (which may not show in just the bones).
 
You’ve seen all this stuff on crime-scene TV shows and maybe in autopsies. 
But such evidence can answer larger questions. For example, tuberculosis was 
once thought to be one of the many diseases Europeans first brought to the 
Americas in the 16th century. Now bone lesions and even dry lung tissue with 
the DNA of the tuberculosis germ has shown that this disease was already 
present in the prehistoric New World 1,000 years ago.
More clues from bone chemistry
You may be less familiar with studies based on the idea that you are what 
you eat and you are where you live. The chemical makeup of bones of all 
kinds (animals’ too) may show what their owners were doing all their lives. 
Teeth may contain minerals from the water the individual drank as a child, 
when the teeth were forming. Later bone formation shows minerals accord-
ing to the area where the person lived closer to the time of death. These 
can be compared with waters and soils in different regions to see where the 
person was raised, compared with where he or she lived at the time of death.
Ancient Chinese noodles
Combining evidence and techniques of course 
improves the quality of your explanation. Another 
fascinating recent study followed the excavation 
of a perfectly preserved, upside-down bowl of 
4,000-year-old noodles in Neolithic northwestern 
China. Both the phytoliths and the starch grains, 
still present despite noodle-making and noodle-
cooking, were from an identifiable plant — no, 
not wheat, not rice, but millet. This grain (most 
often used in the U.S. as birdseed) may have been 
domesticated even earlier than rice in China.

166
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
 
Bone chemicals also reflect types of foods eaten. Stable carbon isotope analysis 
of bone collagen (got that?) can show that people ate different types of plants 
that left traces in their bones. You can determine if they had domesticated 
grains yet or were still gathering wild foods. You can even help law enforce-
ment agencies identify victims based on where their bones say they came 
from.
DNA: It’s nice to have when you can find it
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the building block of life that controls genetic 
heritage, is hard for you not to leave everywhere you go. Modern archaeo-
logical detectives are solving more crimes with DNA evidence. But this mol-
ecule does decay with time, and the amounts left in ancient remains may be 
too small to study. Another complicating factor is that such study is easily 
contaminated with the DNA of the modern researcher in the lab. But look for 
DNA work to become more routine even in archaeology.
Coprolites: Fossilized feces
If you can identify coprolites (ancient, usually dried feces) as human, you 
have a whole new area of study that’s not as sensitive as analyses of human 
skeletal remains. Coprolites give you information on what people ate, their 
health, where they got their food, whether they produced it or gathered it 
wild, and many other aspects of life. Human coprolites from archaeological 
sites can contain preserved intestinal parasites and other disease organisms, 
and even DNA that tells sex and genetic ancestry. They may also contain 
pollen or accidentally-ingested insect parts that give you clues about the past 
environment in which the people lived.
Getting a Date in Archaeology
How does an archaeologist get a date (professionally, not during free time)? 
The several different methods depend upon what kinds of remains you have, 
where you are in the world, and how old the materials may be.
What’s datable and what’s not
You can’t get a radiocarbon date out of a stone because it doesn’t contain 
any carbon. But you may be able to date the stone based on what it looks 
like and/or what it was found with. Stone tools of different types may have 
already been dated according to style and associated artifacts, so you can 
just look up your specimen in a guide to stone tools for your area. You may 
use similar methods with other materials, too. See what’s already been done 
to get an age for your particular material and what datable materials you 
have at your site before you decide upon a dating method.

167
 Chapter 10: Studying and Analyzing What You’ve Excavated
Indirect and direct dating
Direct methods date an artifact itself, and indirect methods date something 
it’s associated with. Dating a stone tool or a clay potsherd directly is often 
impossible because radiocarbon dating requires something with carbon in it. 
But you may be able to date something made of carbon that’s near the arti-
fact, assuming they’re the same age. You can date something directly if you 
have historic information about it. For example, a guide showing different 
china patterns may give the calendar date when they were first introduced 
and when they were discontinued.
Relative dating
Relative dating methods aren’t the way you find out the real age of Aunt Ida. 
They’re traditional archaeological methods that don’t give an actual date, but 
an age in relationship to something else. For example:
 
 The law of superposition: Artifacts found deeper in the ground are older 
than those found nearer the surface (unless something has come along 
and churned things around).
 
 Seriation: Artifact types are arranged according to their stylistic 
similarities and/or frequencies of occurrence. You may not know the 
absolute dates, but you can arrange the styles that look most similar 
closest to each other on the chart. You can do this with any artifact that 
changes through time, from cars to ancient Egyptian pots (seriated by 
Sir Flinders Petrie in the 1890s). Some disadvantages of this method 
are that it assumes gradual change through time and that it wouldn’t 
work with everything. Look at the radical shift from slide rule to pocket 
calculator or from paper notebook to hand-held computer — those arti-
facts don’t look anything alike. Another disadvantage is that you can see 
change through time, but you often don’t know which end of the series 
is the earliest and which the latest.
 
 Fluorine dating: This method is based on the principle that two bones 
buried together at the same time will take up the same amount of fluo-
rine (and other elements) from the soil, so they must be the same age. 
Fluorine dating is famous because it exposed the hoax of the notorious 
“Piltdown man” fossil that was found in England in 1912. This “find” was 
an old human skull buried with a modern ape jaw that was filed to fit 
and dyed to match. It fooled famous anthropologists who wanted to find 
that the earliest ape-like-but-large-brained humans had emerged from 
England (rather than Africa).

168
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
Getting a calendar date
To get a date in actual calendar years, you can use absolute or chronometric 
dating. Absolute dating is only possible with objects that have dates on them, 
such as coins. Chronometric dating measures the time since something has 
elapsed.
Radiocarbon dating
The most common chronometric method, radiocarbon dating, is based on the 
radioactive decay of the carbon-14 isotope (written as 14C).
As the science-fiction shows say, Earth is full of carbon-based life forms. All 
living things take in carbon (through food, among other methods) and con-
tain the same proportion of the carbon-12 isotope to carbon-14. When an 
organism dies, the 14C begins radioactive decay at a known rate, measured 
by the concept of the half-life, or how long it takes half of it to decay. Because 
14C has a half-life of 5,730 years, archaeologists can measure how much of 
it is left in a piece of something that was once alive and calculate how much 
time has elapsed since its death.
The advantage of radiocarbon dating is that your site often has charcoal, 
bone, or other organic material that contains carbon. The disadvantages are 
as follows:
 
 You have to have something preserved that’s organic (was once alive) — 
not stone, pottery, or metal — and you have to have enough of it to date 
(about a cup of charcoal or, for dating a large animal or human skeleton, 
an arm and a leg, or something as big as that).
 
 You have to have about $300 to pay for testing.
 
 The date comes out as a statistical approximation within two standard 
deviations; in lay terms, this means something like a 33 percent chance 
that your date is incorrect.
 
 The farthest back you can date organisms (because of that half-life) is 
about 50,000 years. So any human experience before that, up to 2 mil-
lion years ago or more, is too old to date by this method. This is fine for 
North and South America, however, because they had no people that 
long ago.
An improvement in radiocarbon dating
 
AMS (accelerator mass spectrometry) radiocarbon dating is a wonderful refine-
ment that allows the physicist to count the actual carbon atoms with a big parti-
cle accelerator machine. This instrument needs far less material for dating, such 
as a piece of charcoal as big as a pencil point. This can be a great advantage if 
you don’t have good organic preservation at your site. From my excavations 
of a shell midden in Florida, I obtained a sherd of fiber-tempered pottery that 
broke open to show a couple fibers of Spanish moss still unburned and 

169
 Chapter 10: Studying and Analyzing What You’ve Excavated
undecayed in the clay. These were dated by the AMS method — one of the rare 
times that I could date a potsherd directly. The sherd turned out to be about 
4,000 years old.
More improvement through tree rings
Another disadvantage of radiocarbon dating has now been corrected 
by using a totally independent chronometric method known as dendro-
chronology, or tree-ring dating. The previous assumption was that uniform 
amounts of radioactive carbon were present every year in the atmosphere 
to be absorbed by all living things. When someone decided to check this 
assumption by AMS-radiocarbon dating individual tree rings with known 
ages, it became clear that past levels of carbon-14 have fluctuated a lot. 
Dendochronology uses sequences of thick and thin rings from trees with 
overlapping lifetimes and works backward in time. You can even find living 
trees that are several thousand years old, such as the gnarly old bristlecone 
pine from the southwestern U.S.
Ring characteristics depend on annual weather patterns, so this method 
works best in areas with great variability, such as the desert. It also requires 
enough wood in your artifact to see the rings. Furthermore, the wood the 
artifact was made of may have been old already when used, or used for a long 
time, as in a house beam, but the date you get is for the year the tree was cut. 
On the whole, though, dendrochronology has changed radiocarbon dating by 
helping correct its errors; the story is a cautionary tale of science, and how 
you have to confirm your results by independent tests. Now whenever you 
get a radiocarbon date, it’s corrected or calibrated along a curve produced 
by tree ring dates to give a more accurate calendrical age.
Other chronometric dating methods
Several other chronometric methods are based on measuring time elapsed 
since some physiochemical change.
 
 Potassium-argon dating measures the decay of a rare radioactive 
isotope of potassium that results in its becoming argon gas. Here the 
half-life is 1.31 billion years, so you can measure much older things. 
However, your object needs to have the required minerals. Luckily, the 
volcanic deposits that contain early human fossil forms in east Africa 
also contain potassium, so many of those finds have been dated by this 
method.
 
 Archaeomagnetism is another chronometric dating method (not a com-
mentary on how attractive archaeologists are). It’s based on the fact 
that earth’s magnetic fields shift over time. When soil is heated, the iron 
particles in it align themselves with the poles. Because north moves 
over time at a known rate, archaeologists can measure the magnetic 
alignment in the ground and compare it with today’s alignment.

170
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
Which dating method is best? Because each has favorable and unfavorable 
aspects, you should use more than one independent method if possible. 
Radiocarbon is the most important for the New World and later Old World 
prehistory, but if you can confirm your radiocarbon date in some other way, 
your results are much more reliable.
 
At a site in northwest Florida where I worked during 2002, we had already 
excavated typical prehistoric pottery that has often been dated to between 
A.D. 1200 and the time of European contact in the New World. Then we got 
a tiny glass bead from the fine screen of the flotation machine. We knew the 
Native Americans had no glass until the Spanish brought it in the 16th century. 
We had enough charcoal to get a radiocarbon date from a small pit feature 
that had the bead in it. The date returned as about A.D. 1500–1600, very early 
in historic times, confirming the estimation based on the bead. This part of 
Florida has no historic records that early, so I’m returning to dig a little more 
and see whether I can find more accurately datable evidence.
When You Need Help
Obviously, you can study and analyze all your artifacts and ecofacts at many 
different levels, beginning with the basics. You can classify artifacts using pub-
lished typologies and estimate the relative ages of objects based on how deep 
you found them and whether they resemble already-dated types of artifacts.
Even the most accomplished archaeologist must send out for specialized 
analyses of animal bone, plant remains, human skeletons, dating, or other 
chemical and physical analyses. Finding specialists for these studies is easy 
on the Internet, where they list prices and time required.
Even after you’ve got all the analyses back, you as the archaeologist have to 
figure out what they all mean. For example, one specialist may tell you that 
fish and turtle remains constitute 90 percent of your faunal (animal) assem-
blage, and another may tell you that your human bone chemistry indicates a 
diet of seafood. To get the whole story, however, you must tie this informa-
tion together with the remains of fishing gear and other artifacts you’ve exca-
vated from the site settlement locations along waterways. Perhaps you also 
find that the occupation of the site ended when the water source moved or 
dried up. That, then, is the whole story.

 Reporting what you’ve found and what it means
 Inferring past human behavior through analogy with known cultures
 Explaining your findings using various archaeological theories
I
n this chapter, I show you how to prepare the results of your archaeologi-
cal investigation. You use materials and information you’ve dug up to 
reconstruct human behavior in the past at your site and in your whole study 
region. You may interpret the same archaeological findings in many ways, 
and you have to watch for different kinds of biases. People may have done 
things very differently in the past than you’ve ever imagined!
The archaeological evidence relates to what you know of human activity 
in modern or historic times — so you’re using analogy. You also may use 
several very different theoretical perspectives as you examine past human 
systems. Some of them are complicated philosophies, but they do make a 
difference in how you see the human past (trust me).
Reporting on Your Investigation
 
You have an ethical obligation to report your archaeological findings, or else 
you’re no better than a looter. Besides, you can’t just stick that lost ark up 
on the high storage shelf without describing what it means or what you went 
through to get it! Writing up your research, especially for cultural resources 
management (CRM) projects (archaeology done to comply with laws — see 
Chapter 3 for more), also means you must make recommendations about 
preservation.

Producing your report
An archaeological report describes everything you did in the field and labo-
ratory, including all your background work and everything you found. You 
describe your results and what they show about human behavior in the past; 
you want to show what new information you have and where to go with the 
next research or the next actions at your site or project area.
The essentials
A good archaeological report should have the following sections:
 
 Introduction saying why you did the project and what the research goals 
were. List crew members and sources of support.
 
 Environmental background of the area of your site or survey, including 
resources available to past people.
 
 Cultural background — what’s known of past cultures there.
 
 Archaeological background — what previous researchers found there, 
including local people and collections, and how your work fits in.
 
 Your fieldwork, including background research, where you dug, how 
(test unit, survey segment), how deep, and how you decided all this.
 
 Lists of all soils, strata, and features you excavated and what they show.
 
 Lists of all materials you recovered, usually by type (lithic [stone], 
ceramic, metal, bone, and so on), and discussions of what the assem-
blage (whole group) of each kind shows.

Cultural Resources Management (CRM) reports
If your archaeological investigation was for CRM purposes, it was a survey 
or excavation done in the path of some proposed construction project. 
Therefore, you also need to include specific recommendations on how that 

173
 Chapter 11: Reconstructing the Past: Piecing Together the Puzzles
project should proceed in regard to those cultural resources. Here are some 
possibilities:
 
 Your survey located several sites, and some look promising enough to 
conduct test excavation to see if they’re significant. Significance usually 
means the site has undisturbed remains or materials from poorly known 
time periods, and the potential to produce valuable information. In the 
U.S., you often use the official federal criteria for significance defined by 
the National Register of Historic Places.
 
 Your test excavation demonstrated it’s a significant site, so you ask that 
proposed construction be moved to go around it and preserve it. Or if it 
must be destroyed, recommend full-scale excavation to save what’s left 
before construction.
 
 The site/sites you investigated didn’t contain significant archaeological 
remains, so the builders can go ahead and destroy them. The work you 
did got as much information as possible from them before destruction.
Sharing your work
Usually, you submit your report to whoever initiated the work (such as a 
client of a contract archaeology company) and whoever paid for it (such as a 
granting agency). Others who should get copies:
 
 The agency that issued you a permit
 
 All who worked on the project
 
 Landowners and other interested parties
 
 Libraries in the area of the project and at universities or big cities
 
 State archaeological offices
 
 Anyone who provided background information for you, such as people 
you interviewed
Many archaeological reports are now available online, though sometimes this 
practice is a bad idea because it gives looters more information about exact 
locations of sites.
 
Besides simply submitting a professional report on your work, you should aim 
to write an article about it for publication in a journal or elsewhere to make 
your results more available to other researchers. You can also write a popular 
or less technical version to share your findings with a wider audience. (See 
Chapter 16 for suggestions on how to bring your results to the public.)

Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
Telling the Story of What You’ve Found
I describe in Chapter 10 how to examine and analyze the archaeological 
materials and data you’ve obtained. In doing all that, you create additional 
information that you then piece together to explain what went on at your site 
or region. Here I show you how to put it together to tell the story of the past.
As an archaeologist, you may be stereotyped as someone intent upon digging 
up arrowheads, pottery, mounds, or pyramids. But you’re really interested in 
the workings of whole cultures and in human culture as a whole.
Reconstructing human systems within past societies, you can see what 
worked and what didn’t. You get a picture of how humans adapted to their 
environments through time, how culture change took place, what rose and 
fell, sometimes even why.
 
Your work may be a synchronic study, explaining what happened at a 
restricted slice of time at your site. Or you may reconstruct the diachronic pic-
ture, showing how things changed through time at your site or within a whole 
region. Either way, you’re contributing to the knowledge of humanity.
 
The easiest human behaviors to reconstruct are how people made a living 
and obtained resources, and how long ago (technically categorized as subsis-
tence, technology, and dating). More difficult is determining how past social 
and political systems worked. The most difficult thing to figure out from the 
archaeological evidence is ideology — what people believed, how religious or 
ritual activities took place, and why.
Describing what happened 
based on the evidence
The sections of your report describing the finds are easy compared to the 
parts where you try to figure out what they all mean. Go in an orderly fashion 
from what’s known to your first level of inference — in other words, the safe 
suggestions about what the finds may mean. For example, if you find lots of 
deer bones, you can probably pretty safely assume the people from that site 
were hunting and eating a lot of venison.
You can then present more speculative and less certain interpretations — 
lots of deer statues may indicate the people worshipped deer, but they may 
just be toys or clan symbols. Remember, you’re showing as much as possible 
of what past people did and experienced over space and time, that’s all!

175
 Chapter 11: Reconstructing the Past: Piecing Together the Puzzles
Detailing how people lived, got 
stuff, and settled the land
Artifacts (objects made and used by people), ecofacts (remains of plants and 
animals used by people), features (larger things people left in the ground), 
and soils show a lot about how people lived and got the stuff they needed. 
Environmental data, site distribution maps, and artifact sourcing (determining 
where artifacts came from) tell you where people settled and how they and 
their materials moved around.
Technology
Your artifact studies show what was used at your site, how these things were 
made, and sometimes what purposes they were used for. Besides finished 
artifacts, other items convey a wealth of information. Lithic debitage (stone 
chips) shows how stone implements were fashioned and with what raw mate-
rial. Structural remains, whether standing ruins or postmold patterns in the 
soil, show how buildings were constructed. Pits full of fire-cracked rock or 
red clay soil may indicate cooking or heating techniques.
 
Technology is fairly easy to reconstruct because you have the material items 
that show it. But artifact function is tricky to establish sometimes, especially if 
the artifacts aren’t for everyday utilitarian purposes. Remember also that the 
absence of those artifacts made of materials that rotted away (string, wood, 
and so on) may lead you to misinterpret or not understand some technologi-
cal systems because vital pieces of the puzzle are missing.
Subsistence
Artifacts and features help you infer a people’s subsistence, or how they got 
food and other necessities. Points and butchering tools may have been for 
hunting, and hoes for digging and planting. Fire pits with food remains and 
the occasional dropped kitchen implement give you ideas on how people pro-
cessed foods. Human bone chemistry indicates what people were eating.
 
Animal and plant ecofacts tell you directly some of the species used and in 
what proportions. Be careful here. You may jump to a wrong conclusion if you 
assume
 
 That all these remains were for food. Many may have been for other pur-
poses; shellfish may not have been for eating but rather for bait or for 
using shells to make tools. Others may be from species that got into the 
site after the people left (like animals that burrowed into the ground at 
your site and died there).

176
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
 
 That all the food remains represent the total diet. People may have dis-
carded many remains elsewhere, such as fish bones thrown back into 
the lake because they were so smelly.
 
 That the remains show everything available to people in their past envi-
ronments. They may have had resources available that they chose not 
to use. For example, most people today don’t eat insects, even though 
the little critters are certainly abundant, nutritious, and easy to get.
Environment
Archaeological information showing human uses of and impacts on past envi-
ronments (as well as the effects of environments upon human societies) is 
valuable knowledge for the modern world. You can see how people lived in 
and changed their ecosystems and how the changing environments affected 
the people.
In describing the ecological setting of your site, you indicate what natural 
resources would have been available for people to use. Where other sites are 
located — where other societies lived during the same time period — is also 
important because this forms part of the environmental setting. You want to 
show the cultural ecology of your site or region — how people’s interactions 
with their natural and cultural surroundings shaped their ways of life.
 
Make sure the present natural environment of your site is what it would’ve been 
in the past. Landforms change, coastlines and rivers move, and later human 
activity messes up earlier ecosystems and sites. For example, the climate and 
landscape were significantly colder and dryer in most places on earth during 
the Pleistocene (Ice Age). Data you collected on soils, pollen, and other environ-
mental indicators both at your site and away from it help you reconstruct past 
environments. For example, the pollen in the earlier levels of your site may be 
from plants that lived in a dryer, colder climate; shallower, later levels may have 
pollen from species that lived in warmer, wetter conditions.
In fact, archaeological information you recover may document important 
environmental change — and you may even be able to show how your past 
people coped with that change. (I describe in Chapter 13 the first human 
experience with global warming.) You can describe how people manipulated 
environments too, such as with canals, irrigation systems, deforestation, 
domestication of plants and animals, and so forth.
If you have no plant or animal remains preserved, you still get an idea of 
subsistence from the other artifacts and from the landscape. For example, 
I’ve dug up ceramic sherds impressed with corncobs at sites where no corn 
survived, so I can still know people were farming. Other ceramic sherds 
impressed with nets give more ambiguous information. People could have 
used nets for fishing or just as bags to carry things. Nets can also trap 

177
 Chapter 11: Reconstructing the Past: Piecing Together the Puzzles
animals, so they may indicate hunting as well as (or instead of) fishing. 
Similarly, small hooks can be for fishing and for many other kinds of tasks, 
such as hanging stuff up. So in my report I need to suggest these different 
alternative explanations, and which one I may favor and why.
Settlement systems
You may have dated your site directly through radiocarbon dating or other 
methods that I describe in Chapter 10. Or perhaps you know the general age 
based on the artifact types, which are well dated elsewhere. Combined with 
your information on landscape and resource use, your dates can help you 
reconstruct settlement patterns.
 
Within a region, the inter-site settlement system refers to the locations of and 
relationships among different sites at different times — people’s spatial orga-
nization of the landscape, where they did what, and possibly why. Here’s what 
inter-site settlement patterns can show:
 
 Sites of one kind may be in different sorts of places than sites of another 
kind. For example, economic centers may be on waterways for easier 
transportation, and religious shrines may be in mountains or other more 
isolated sacred spots.
 
 Locations of sites of different kinds at different time periods can indicate 
change through time. For example, sites of foraging people may have 
been in the uplands, but when they later started farming they may have 
moved to the river valley for fertile land and irrigation capabilities. Or 
earlier historic people may have lived along coastlines or rivers for easy 
travel but later moved to live along rail lines after the new railroads pro-
vided even easier transportation.
You also want to look at the intra-site settlement pattern, which reflects the 
differences within one site — different activity areas. For example, you may 
have a domestic area with houses, a public area with a plaza, and a religious 
area with a temple, perhaps at different times in the past.
Economic systems
Your maps showing the sources of artifacts and raw materials give you an 
idea of human interaction across the landscape. When you combine your 
data on subsistence and settlement with the information on how and from 
where people obtained materials, you can reconstruct past economic sys-
tems. If you compare what’s available in the region with what’s not, you may 
be able to see what people at your site were trading out and getting in return. 
You can even make a grand map with arrows showing what moved around 
where.

178
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
You want to notice where necessities or staple goods such as foods appear 
across your site or region. Then you can compare this information with 
where the wealth items appear. Did you excavate all the gold in the site from 
one big house? If so, your wealth items were concentrated in the hands of 
just a few. If you found a little gold in every house you dug, your society was 
a little more egalitarian (characterized by social equality).
 
When you reconstruct your past economic system, remember that artifacts at 
your site from far-away sources don’t necessarily show trade with distant people. 
They may be from other kinds of exchange or even one-way movement — gifts, 
things owned by new people moving in, even materials obtained in raids or by 
theft. Raiding and pillaging is one kind of economic strategy, after all!
Describing social order, family, gender, 
and politics in the past
Using material remains to show how past social systems worked is more dif-
ficult than showing how people made a living, but it’s still possible. You can 
look at gender, kinship and family organization, class or caste, labor special-
ization, and other ways people are structured into categories that make up 
whole social systems.
Social systems
You can classify social systems based on size, division of labor, prestige and 
social esteem, and differences in wealth or ability to get needed resources. 
The classifications are based on ethnographic (descriptions of cultures all 
over the world) and historical knowledge. Often categories go in order from 
simple to complex; the following is a list of these categories:
 
 Egalitarian societies: Everyone’s pretty much equal and does the same 
things to make a living. Divisions of labor based on age or gender may 
exist, sometimes in the form of part-time specialists, such as religious 
practitioner or best hunter. Subsistence is usually simple, such as forag-
ing or gardening. Sites are often seasonal because people move around 
to get different resources when they’re ripe or ready. Groups tend to be 
small because the more people a society has, the more complex organi-
zation it requires. Indicators of egalitarian society in the archaeological 
record are small sites; similar houses, burial types, and skeletal health 
for everyone; and even sites with only seasonal plants and animals 
instead of species available year-round. I describe the archaeology of 
some early egalitarian societies in Chapter 12.

179
 Chapter 11: Reconstructing the Past: Piecing Together the Puzzles
 
 Ranked societies: These societies feature real social differences —some 
people have greater importance or higher esteem. Rank is often based 
on family status, so the more important folks can be elders, chiefs, 
or other leaders. They may have authority to direct behavior but no 
real power or means to enforce their directives other than the group’s 
respect for them. Though people may have different titles and ranks, 
they still all get the same resources and share them. Ranked societies 
may have non-farming craft specialists and leaders whose food comes 
from the labors of others. Subsistence may occur by obtaining wild 
foods, but ranked societies usually produce some of their own food. I 
describe some of the earliest societies showing such social differences 
in Chapter 13. You can recognize ranked societies archaeologically by 
markers such as special symbolic artifacts in a few houses or with some 
high-status graves but no real differences in wealth or health.
 
 Stratified societies: These groups have real economic inequality on top 
of the social differences — in other words, richer and poorer. Their lead-
ers have power to make people do things and followers to enforce rules. 
Leadership roles may be inherited rather than achieved. Stratification 
often first appears along with the intensification of agriculture. Slave 
labor is a handy way to build irrigation systems, not to mention roads 
and big monuments. I describe early stratified societies in Chapter 13. 
Stratification is easier to recognize archaeologically because you can see 
concentrations of wealth in the ground, skeletal remains showing lives 
of hard labor or little hardship and better food, and images of power in 
art and architecture.
 
 State-level societies: These are the most highly stratified and complex 
forms ever developed, and all are based on large-scale agriculture and 
domestic animal production. Their powerful leaders can mandate behav-
ior, punish disobedience, fight wars, and levy taxes. These early states 
are usually organized along hierarchical and bureaucratic lines in addi-
tion to the more traditional kinship ties. I describe the archaeology of 
early states in Chapter 14. You can recognize them archaeologically by 
their monuments, wealth, and cities, among other things.
In real cultures, social organization doesn’t always fit perfectly into simple 
categories. (What a surprise — human behavior is complicated!) You may 
have intermediate and combined forms. For example, native peoples of the 
northwest coast of North America had hereditary chiefs and slaves and 
ranked everyone in between, which makes them seem like a stratified society. 
But they only fished and hunted — never grew any crops — and had season-
ally moving camps and villages, characteristics more like egalitarian foragers. 
Prehistoric people of southern Florida were similar complex foragers. They 
had chiefs who demanded tribute, but they made a living only by fishing and 
hunting, with no agriculture.

180
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
Reconstruction of social organization
Going from descriptions of living people to your archaeological record is 
tricky. For example, if your site features no evidence of food production and 
lots of evidence of wild foods, you may infer simple egalitarian family groups. 
However, suppose the site has one larger building — you have to try to 
determine whether it was a home for one rich person (a scenario that doesn’t 
exactly scream “egalitarian”) or a dance hall and party space for everyone 
(which would support your egalitarian theory).
Your settlement patterns and economic data can show distributions of some 
social aspects in space and time. Perhaps you can determine where craft 
specialists were based if not all households have the same kinds of tools. For 
example, maybe only one house has all the chipping evidence from stone-
tool production, and another one has the only shell bead-working debris 
at the site, indicating that these areas were the territories of these specific 
craftspeople.
Neighborhoods with different house sizes and numbers of wealth items in 
the houses can indicate social classes. Artifact distribution within a house or 
across a site can show where children gathered, where special people had 
ceremonies, and where sports players performed their special roles.
 
Human burials give lots of social information, but you may not be able to 
examine them depending upon the law and the wishes of their descendants 
and others. Skeletons can show better nutrition or a life of hard work. Richer 
graves indicate more important people or some other social distinction. But 
sometimes you can’t tell if burials are just of higher social rank (a revered 
grandmother and clan elder) or if they were actually the leaders or wealthier 
people (the clan mother-chief with real power to tell everyone what to do).
Kinship and ethnicity
A fundamental organizing principle of human society is kinship, or family 
relatedness. Past societies were organized along kinship lines, so clusters of 
houses may show different clans or other family groupings. Different symbols 
or types of artifacts can also reflect family affiliation; you can see this today 
in plaid or tartan patterns for different Scottish clans.
 
Another basic principle around which people organize society is ethnicity 
(identity with the larger group beyond the family). Although ethnic identity is 
easy to determine by asking a living person, it’s often very hard to see in the 
archaeological record. You may remember the Lone Ranger watching his faith-
ful guide Tonto pick up an arrow and conclude it came from someone who 
was “Apache — Red Cloud’s band.” In reality, you seldom know whether the 
style of an arrowhead or any artifact is the result of purely utilitarian function, 
the maker’s ideas of beauty, or markers specific to one ethnic group. What 

181
 Chapter 11: Reconstructing the Past: Piecing Together the Puzzles
artifacts in your home show your nationality? Even knowing where an artifact 
comes from (through trace element analyses or other means I describe in 
Chapter 10) doesn’t necessarily tell you the ethnicity of the users. Your home 
may have electronics made in Japan, clothes made in south Asia, and other 
imports. Even your small American flag may be made in China!
Bone and teeth chemistry can sometimes demonstrate whether people them-
selves came from the area in which they’re found or grew up somewhere 
else. But remember that your ethnic group isn’t only a matter of your biology 
but also of whom you belong to socially and culturally — as adopted people 
well know!
Gender
Another basic organizing principle of society is gender. Reconstructing the 
roles of men and women in the past is a popular area in archaeology. Sex is 
a biological designation, and gender is the social role (loosely) associated 
with it. Although some cultures have strict gender differences, others don’t. 
Evidence for differences between male and female is extremely difficult to 
find in the archaeological record, yet interpretations abound. Most have been 
extremely biased, consisting of some version of the following:
 
 Men doing the interesting prehistoric and historic activities such as 
spearing big game, making neat tools, and ruling from the palace.
 
 Women (prehistoric and historic) just pounding away preparing food 
near the fireplace and holding the kids.
Interpreting gender is especially fraught with problems that archaeologists 
love to argue about. Modern Western standards creep in, but you can’t 
assume that men made all the big sharp stone tools just because Dad carves 
the turkey in your society. Be careful not to impose your own society’s 
models upon past cultures. They may have had very different divisions of 
labor by sex, or perhaps none at all. For example, women in many cultures 
hunt, and several cultures feature men who weave or make pots.
So how can you avoid this pitfall? You may find it helpful to compare known 
societies that are close in time, organization, or environmental setting to 
what you’re digging up to get clues on gender systems.
Burials can give indications of male and female differences because you can 
tell the sex of a skeleton if it’s well preserved. But burial objects can be mis-
leading; do they actually represent a division of labor, or are they just male 
and female symbols? How do you tell whether the male or female tools or 
symbols are more important by the standards of the past society?

182
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
 
Seldom can you tell who actually made and used artifacts, especially in prehis-
toric times. Even if you find fingerprints or DNA on them, you won’t necessar-
ily know which sex made them or used them the most.
 
Although there are only two sexes, some cultures (including many Native 
American groups and cultures in India and Africa) really do have more than two 
genders! Even with only two genders, one sometimes tries to act like — and use 
the artifacts of — the other. (Think of the artifacts used by drag queens.)
Political systems
Politics means controlling and deciding for the group and keeping order. 
Every culture has some kind of political system, although not all of them 
center on one single person in charge. In simpler societies, the group may 
share decision-making, resources, and the sanction of unacceptable behav-
ior. To discover more complex systems, you want to look for evidence that 
some individual or group has more power than others.
 
Archaeologists argue over whether construction of big mounds or other 
monuments means some central leader had power to command labor. Groups 
of people can perform many activities without coercion and without any one 
person in charge (like a potluck supper). Because kinship was the organizing 
principle of many traditional past societies, families could conduct activities 
(perhaps supervised by elders or those with experience). Again, you have to 
be careful that your interpretations don’t impose the biases of your modern, 
hierarchical society.
When real centralized political power and hierarchy evolve, they go beyond 
the kinship structure. But signs of political hierarchy in the archaeological 
record are hard to separate from indications of social, economic, and reli-
gious power — and sometimes they all combine. Groups of larger, richer 
houses, for example, can indicate a real ruling class. But they may also just 
show a rich merchant class still subject to the power of the rulers.
Indications of organized warfare can show a society had the political might 
to mobilize armies and conquer. Even depictions of human sacrifice (not to 
mention graves of victims) show someone has power of life and death over 
someone else. In more complex societies, wealth, power, and inequality 
become more obvious. You certainly have less trouble interpreting a burial of 
one old guy in a pyramid with sacrificed servants and lots of gold!
Understanding past beliefs and values
A standing joke in archaeology says that any artifact or feature you can’t 
explain must be ceremonial — in other words, for some religious or other 
ritual beyond everyday use. The stone point chipped so thin that it would 

183
 Chapter 11: Reconstructing the Past: Piecing Together the Puzzles
break if used? Must be ceremonial! The pile of statues all buried in one spot? 
A ceremonial offering! You often see ceremonial functions in material items 
today. When the mayor offers a visiting dignitary a key to the city, it’s not a 
real key but a huge cardboard key painted gold — a symbol that doesn’t actu-
ally perform any real utilitarian function.
 
Not all evidence of ritual is religious; look at your graduation or birthday party 
artifacts. And not all your ideological system is magical or religious either. It 
can also include belief in the golden rule (“Do unto others. . .”), your country, 
political system, or home team. Art and other expressive things can be non-
religious as well — just for beauty, fun, decoration, or emotional response 
beyond the mundane.
So any artifacts, features, or other aspects of the archaeological record that 
seem to go beyond the practical aspects of making a living can relate to past 
shared belief systems. Even decorations on tools can show this. They may 
also indicate social status, political power, and other things besides ideology.
Here are some examples of how you can see belief systems in archaeology:
 
 Caches (hidden piles) or other deposits of artifacts that aren’t just for 
everyday tasks can be offerings or evidence of some ritual behavior. 
An example is the pile of 3,000-year-old spear points in Color Figure 2, 
which look like they were in a bag, deliberately broken, and possibly 
too thin to be useful spears. At the upper right of the photo, under the 
north arrow and scale, is a round pile of red ochre, a powdery stone that 
may have been for pigment (red may have been an important symbolic 
color).
 
 Deliberate burial of fellow humans, which comes as early as Neanderthal 
times, may show some belief in an afterlife, especially if grave goods are 
left with the dead for use in that afterlife. But it may have just been sani-
tary disposal of the corpse and artifacts nobody needed anymore.
 
 Repeated use of images may show they were supernatural symbols or 
signs of something sacred. For example, the same bird image on pots, 
statues, and the engraved or painted sides of buildings may be a sacred 
figure.
 
 Arrangements of structures in archaeoastronomical alignments may 
show knowledge of the sun, moon, planets, and stars. Lining up your 
mounds or buildings so that the sun rises over them on the solstice 
or equinox takes expert knowledge of engineering and astronomy, and 
maybe expresses religious ideals too; why go to all that trouble to show-
case objects that weren’t sacred? The structures may have offered a 
means to worship the celestial bodies. After all, for most of human exis-
tence, they were the nightly show.

184
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
 
 Structures containing different kinds of artifacts from what you see 
everywhere else in the site can be evidence for the presence of religious 
practitioners such as shamans (part-time) and priests (full-time, sup-
ported by the rest of society). Certainly, burials of people with unusual 
items can indicate they were religious specialists.
 
 Anything unable to be explained in terms of simply making a living has 
the potential to be ideological in nature. But always be careful with your 
assumptions and biases; a common symbol found on a variety of arti-
facts could have meant something sacred but also could be just a pretty 
design or a brand advertisement!
 
Be careful to state alternative hypotheses in all your reconstructions of the 
human past, especially when you’re dealing with belief systems. Explaining 
symbolism and ritual, especially in the distant past, may just be beyond the 
ability of most archaeology. If you have more recent historical records relat-
ing to your past peoples, you can do this more easily. But so much ideological 
behavior (like praying) just doesn’t have material evidence.
 
You can’t ignore ideology. What people believe is the basis for war and peace, 
ritual and art, monumental architecture, and so many other human accom-
plishments. So you explain it as well as you can, and expect to keep modifying 
the explanations in the light of new finds.
Using Analogy with Known 
Human Behavior
All archaeological interpretation is analogy, which means you compare the 
evidence of the past that you found with human behavior that you know in 
order to explain what happened. In this section, I give several different ways 
of using analogy and the cautions that go with them.
Ethnographic analogy: Using 
anthropological and historical data
Doing ethnography means living with and observing a particular society and 
writing down everything for scientific study. Cultural anthropologists and 
historians have collected knowledge of thousands of known societies all 
over the world. You can look up all this information to see the various ways 
people did things. You may get insights into the meanings of symbols on arti-
facts and beliefs about them that you’d never have otherwise.

185
 Chapter 11: Reconstructing the Past: Piecing Together the Puzzles
The best strategy is to use ethnographies of cultures that have some histori-
cal continuity with those you’re digging up. Also, look at known cultures 
that are appropriate for your site or region, and use caution in projecting 
behavior back into the past. For example, decades of research on the hunter–
gatherers of the Kalahari Desert in southern Africa give a great picture of how 
small groups of mobile foragers live, hunting elephants and giraffes. But you 
can’t use this information well to reconstruct foraging behavior at your site 
in a temperate, wet, forested zone that had only deer and small game.
Here are some other examples of the disadvantages of ethnographic analogy:
 
 Research on modern hunter–gatherers and horticultural societies may 
be suspect because so few of them still exist and they inhabit the lands 
least desired by other people. Prehistoric foragers all over the world, 
especially in richer environments, may have lived very differently.
 
 Ethnographic data have been collected mostly in recent historic times, 
so the cultures described may have already been very changed by out-
side influences — even by the people collecting information on them.
 
 Historic accounts of different cultures are usually biased in favor of 
those who wrote them, so they may be inaccurate.
 
 Ethnographic and historic accounts seldom say much about everyday 
life and especially material culture — the kinds of things archaeologists 
are seeing in the ground.
Ethnoarchaeology: Archaeologists 
doing ethnography
This (awkward) term means archaeologists studying living human societies 
to get insights into past cultures. Here you’re doing your own ethnography 
and paying attention to the details of material culture. This technique works 
especially well with hunter–gatherers because you can follow them around 
to see how they catch and butcher animals, use tools, discard bones, and 
create garbage piles and other features. Archaeologists have studied other 
kinds of cultures besides foragers in this way too — even our own. (See my 
descriptions of archaeological study of our modern garbage in Chapter 2 and 
cellphones in Chapter 15.)
Some ethnoarchaeological studies:
 
 In an investigation of Arctic hunters, the archaeologist saw patterns of 
behavior that could have existed among prehistoric Ice Age folks in simi-
lar frigid environments. The Eskimo did have modern artifacts, but used 
many traditional practices as well, like butchering game in ways that left 
distinctive patterns on the bone.

186
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
 
 A study of South American farmers making and using their own earthen-
ware pottery showed archaeologists how broken pots were recycled in 
many ways, not just thrown away.
 
The same cautions noted in the preceding section for ethnographic archaeol-
ogy hold true for ethnoarchaeology. You need some continuity between your 
reference culture and the archaeological culture you’re studying for the com-
parison to work well.
Experimental archaeology: Replicating 
ancient technologies
Experimental archaeology means you try to make the same kind of artifact, 
mound, garden, or stone monument that you’ve excavated. Doing so can give 
you great ideas about how past peoples did such things (and can be fun or 
dangerous, too).
Examples of experimental archaeology:
 
 Flintknapping (chipping stone tools), making pottery in an outdoor kiln, 
and building wattle and daub houses (poles with woven branches and 
clay daubed on top) are all common archaeology activities. (Sometimes 
they can be hazardous if you cut yourself with sharp stone or let your 
kiln fire get out of hand!)
 
 Reenacting past ways of life or historic events gives you an idea of what 
it was like to wear the clothing, eat the food, use the tools, and even 
fight the battles or share the misery of the past.
 
 Filling up bags or baskets of dirt and piling them up to build a mound 
or earthen wall can give you an idea of how many laborers and how 
much time (and how many sore muscles) it took to construct such 
monuments.
 
 Cutting big stones out of a mountain and moving them on log rollers or 
barges helps you see how people created monumental constructions.
 
 Using chemical analysis of residues on ancient vessels as well as histori-
cal records, some enterprising investigators recreate ancient beer brew-
ing and winemaking techniques (and get to drink the results).
 
 At least one person who donated his body to science after his death has 
been used to explore ancient mummification techniques (yes!) based on 
archaeological finds and Egyptian writings describing the processes.

 Chapter 11: Reconstructing the Past: Piecing Together the Puzzles
Relating the archaeological 
story to the present
You want to see how people lived and behaved in the past. You can not only 
make a contribution to archaeological knowledge but also discover more 
about human nature and your own heritage. When you use analogy, you use 
present knowledge to understand the past.
 
The relationship can go the other way — making past information useful and 
appealing in the present world. The drama of what people endured or enjoyed, 
or how they lived on the land people inhabit today can be fascinating for 
modern folks and give practical insights for solving common human problems.
In Chapter 16, I give you a rundown of the practical uses of archaeological 
information. Here I simply emphasize the importance of telling the story well 
and relating it to human life everywhere. People dealt in very different ways 
with the basic necessities and more elaborate issues of life. They sometimes 
survived and recovered from natural disasters and political mistakes. Other 
times they didn’t. But it always makes a great story!
 
When you relate the results of your archaeological reconstructions, be care-
ful that the storytelling doesn’t get in the way of the science! You should first 
state what you know is fairly certain, then what looks probable, and then 
other possible explanations. If you clearly label the things you know are fanci-
ful speculations, then you don’t look silly when someone’s new finds shoot 
down your reconstruction later.
Using Archaeological Theories 
to Interpret Your Discoveries
As you interpret your discoveries and see what happened in the past, you’re 
guided by different sorts of philosophical frameworks — whether you realize 
it or not. In this section, I describe theoretical terms and ideas you see float-
ing around in archaeological circles. (I use all of them in this book.)
The frameworks or theoretical perspectives — in other words, how you see 
things — make a big difference in the story you tell and the science you do. 
They’re a bit complicated, so stay with me here. Then you can throw around 
flashy theoretical jargon and impress your fellow diggers!

188
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
 
After you read through my description of the major theoretical perspectives, 
you may ask which ones to use. My answer is that modern archaeology uses 
all of them! As an archaeologist today you first establish your culture his-
tory to describe what happened, and then do science asking questions about 
cultural processes. You also heed the postprocessual criticisms of science 
(explained later in this section) and see the biases and weaknesses in your 
arguments.
Culture history: What, when, where
The culture history approach means you simply tell what, when, and where 
something happened. Culture history is description, setting up space-time 
frameworks. You describe material remains and what they show about how 
people lived and behaved in the past for each time period. You also try to get 
at the rules and standards used by your past people in their behavior. This 
approach has dominated most archaeology until recently, and is the first part 
of any project.
When you relate culture history, you give a list of succeeding cultures 
through time, with their characteristic artifacts and lifeways. The time chart 
in the appendix shows you a brief culture history for the world, from earliest 
prehistoric through modern times.
Processual archaeology: How, maybe why
 
The 1960s and 1970s marked the development of what folks called the “new 
archaeology” and, later, processual archaeology. Simply put, doing processual 
archaeology (also known as culture process) means doing science. It means you 
use the scientific method to study the processes through which culture works.
Within processual archaeology, one particular perspective is middle-range 
theory, meaning you find causal links between the material record in the 
ground and the behavior of living past people. Another specific perspective 
is cultural materialism, which means interpreting human culture as mostly 
structured by the limits of the material world. I discuss both of these in more 
detail later in this section.
Scientific archaeology
Processual archaeology developed when archaeologists became dissatisfied 
with just describing culture and not asking questions about how and why 
things happened. The following list shows you some of the goals of scientific, 
processual archaeology:

189
 Chapter 11: Reconstructing the Past: Piecing Together the Puzzles
 
 See how cultural systems worked.
 
 Explain processes of culture change (or lack of change).
 
 Address big cultural questions like the origins of culture, food produc-
tion, or civilization.
 
 Make general statements about human behavior.
Doing processual archaeology includes many strategies and techniques. Here 
are some of them:
 
 Using the scientific method, testing multiple alternative hypotheses.
 
 Using a positivist philosophy (thinking everything is knowable if you 
have the right tools, logic, and experience to find it out). This mindset 
is very characteristic of Western society — humans can definitely get to 
the moon (or cure cancer) if they develop the right technology.
 
 Studying artifact and site function, settlement pattern, and past 
landscapes.
 
 Analyzing quantitative data (numbers), including establishing huge data-
bases that let you study your zillions of archaeological materials more 
easily.
 
 Computer modeling of everything from sites to past cultural systems.
 
 Using complex scientific technology and fancy instruments in the field 
and during laboratory analyses.
 
 Understanding past natural ecosystems in which cultures existed.
 
 Emphasizing the cultural ecology of past peoples — how they related to 
specific natural and social environments.
 
 Looking at the efficiency of ways prehistoric people made a living in 
their environments.
 
 Exploring how social class and religious ritual (like burial customs) can 
be analyzed and explained scientifically.
 
 Using the comparative method to interpret the evidence you’ve exca-
vated in terms of human cultures worldwide.
Cultural materialism and middle range theory
Cultural materialism means you explain culture as primarily structured by 
the technology, environment, and economy — the material conditions of 
human existence. It’s the philosophical perspective you often use when doing 
archaeology within a processual or scientific framework. These conditions 
are the systems that get you your basic necessities of life. Other cultural 
systems less directly related to those basic needs — like social organization, 
values and beliefs, and art — depend on that material infrastructure. When it 
changes, the rest changes.

190
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
 
Explaining culture in terms of the material conditions is useful because that’s 
what archaeology has to work with. You don’t get evidence that direct when 
you’re trying to study social and religious organization. So you use cultural 
materialism because you can, though you know beliefs also cause behavior.
Middle range theory is a term meaning the causal links between the archaeo-
logical record in the ground and the long-gone human behavior and natural 
processes responsible for it. So middle range theory includes using all the 
types of analogy I describe earlier in this chapter. It also means you investi-
gate site formation processes — not only the human cultural behavior of the 
past but also the geological and physical factors that left your site the way it 
is today. (I describe these site formation processes in Chapter 1.)
Postprocessual archaeology: Finding 
meaning and avoiding bias
Theoretical archaeologists came up with postprocessual archaeology in the 
1980s and 1990s as a reaction against some of the weaknesses of processual 
archaeology (described a bit more in Chapter 1). Postprocessual archaeology 
means humanistic study — seeing culture through the arts, critique, and even 
speculation and philosophy (but not the hard empirical evidence of science).
 
Postprocessual theory is archaeology’s version of postmodernism, a 20th-
century philosophy that originated in (of all places) literary criticism. 
Postmodernists criticized the scientific view that everything was knowable. 
They “deconstructed” great books (and everything else) to see how they were 
put together and what the biases of the writers were. Social scientists and 
others began using postmodern viewpoints when they were useful.
Archaeology finally adopted postmodern ideas and gave them several names. 
Postprocessual archaeology includes all of them. I list the most prominent 
ones here, with explanations:
 
 Critical theory: Seeing the biases in your scientific assumptions about 
the past. They can be hidden or unnoticed racism, sexism, capitalist 
economic interpretations, and so on. Critical theory is probably the 
most valuable contribution of postprocessual archaeology.
 
 Cognitive archaeology: Finding out what had meaning to past people 
and what they thought and believed. You can do this better with historic 
archaeology because you have some written records showing what 
people thought. But you can’t figure it out well for prehistoric times — 
those people are all dead, and they didn’t write anything down!

191
 Chapter 11: Reconstructing the Past: Piecing Together the Puzzles
 
 Symbolic and structural archaeology: Assuming that thought processes 
are similar in all humans, and that symbols express the structure of 
thought. So if you study how symbols are organized, you can figure out 
what people were thinking in the past. Again, this method only works 
well with historic archaeology.
 
 Reflexive archaeology: Recognizing that your interpretation of the past 
is just one among many possible explanations. This technique is useful 
to see your data in different ways. But after all, you’re the archaeologist, 
so you probably have more expertise on the subject.
 
 Marxist archaeology: Seeing past behavior in terms of political power 
and control over resources and production. Marxist archaeologists 
existed long before postprocessual archaeology, but their ideas are 
more popular lately. Marxism sounds like a variety of materialism, but 
because it emphasizes more how people struggle not to be dominated 
by those in power, it’s really a more ideological approach (and some-
times pretty pessimistic with all that struggling).
 
 Feminist archaeology: Looking for evidence of women in the archaeo-
logical past and correcting male bias in interpretation. This line of study 
also existed before postprocessualism. Many (especially women) saw 
how archaeological explanations always had men doing the neat things 
in the past. (See the section “Describing social order, family, gender, 
and politics in the past” earlier in this chapter for more on gender and 
social bias.)
 
 Agency theory: Looking for powerful individual leaders making choices 
and decisions in the past. Rather than talking about passive people at 
the mercy of their environmental or economic systems, agency theorists 
see active persons causing culture change. This theory goes well with 
gender and Marxist interpretations, but it’s also easier to see when you 
have historical records to give you an idea of just who is out there grab-
bing power and how. It’s nearly impossible to see in prehistory.
Doing postprocessual archaeology, you may reject a search for universal 
scientific laws about human behavior or cultural systems. You see cultures 
and individuals acting in different ways. You also may go beyond the data to 
tell many speculative, not-scientifically-testable stories interpreting the past. 
You’re also interested in showing how all archaeology is political. You may 
demonstrate how inequality evolved and how people came to be subjected 
and controlled. You also see how the past and its interpretations and physi-
cal remains are used for political ends today as well. And you show how 
modern science isn’t objective but is political in many ways. In Chapter 16, I 
give you more explanation of the politics of archaeology.

192
Part III: After the Dig: You’ve Only Just Begun 
Explaining the past with multiple theoretical views
Archaeological theory is difficult; its compli-
cated philosophical writing can be torture. But 
you need theoretical foundations before you dig. 
Here are examples of the different perspectives 
in studying Paleolithic (Old Stone Age) cave art 
of Western Europe. Ice-Age hunter–gatherers 
made the beautiful paintings and engravings 
on rock walls some 20,000 years for unknown 
reasons.
  Doing culture history, you describe and 
photograph the art and identify the animal 
species shown. You date associated arti-
facts or charcoal mixed in with the paints. 
You say what’s there, where it all is, maybe 
how old it is, and how it’s distributed across 
space. Using general analogy, you suggest 
the animals depicted are probably the ones 
often hunted; maybe the pictures were 
part of ritual magic to ensure a successful 
hunt.
  For processual archaeology, you analyze 
the paints and stone tools used to make 
the pictures. You look at the engravings 
and brush strokes or finger marks on the 
rock to see how they were created. You 
compare the animals shown on the rock 
with the food bones left at sites of this time 
period. Statistics you collect on what’s por-
trayed can help, but you may have trouble 
classifying everything — is that partial out-
line a horse or a deer? For ethnographic 
analogy (part of middle-range theory), you 
read studies of people all over the world 
who do cave art to see why they do it and 
look for similarities between their other 
lifeways and your Paleolithic people. You 
also do experimental archaeology, mixing 
the minerals, plants, and animal fats you’ve 
discovered made up the pigments in the 
paint, and trying cave art yourself. Because 
most of the art is deep into caves, you real-
ize Paleolithic people had to go quite a long 
way with unreliable torches and stone oil 
lamps in total darkness; you suspect the 
art had deep, probably sacred meaning. 
Maybe you hypothesize that these were 
places for special gatherings and then see 
if the artifacts and animal bones left in the 
caves show more unusual things than in 
the typical habitation sites. If they do, your 
hypothesis is supported.
  To do postprocessual archaeology, you 
start by assuming the art depicts symbols 
of beliefs. You note that animals portrayed 
aren’t the same ones represented in the food 
debris, so they have much deeper meaning. 
You may look at where each picture is. Lions, 
bears, and other animals not typically hunted 
are far deeper in the caves, maybe signifying 
greater sacredness. One archaeologist inter-
ested in the structure of symbols thought 
bison represented females in the ancient 
mind, because bison were often portrayed 
over passage openings; horses, on long side 
walls, were male symbols. He interpreted 
all the pictures as portraying ancient myths 
about men and women. Many, many other 
explanations are possible here — just use 
your imagination!
Next time you read any archaeological recon-
struction, see if you can determine the research-
er’s theoretical perspective. The approaches 
complement each other, so many archaeolo-
gists are now using them all. They also use even 
more tortured terms like “processual-plus” or 
“cognitive-processual” archaeology. Despite 
the jargon, remember to try to use description, 
science, and humanism too.

Par t IV
Archaeology 
Reconstructs the 
Whole Human Past

In this part . . .
M
ost of human existence on this planet can only be 
 known through archaeology,  so in Part IV,  I 
recount a little of what archaeologists have reconstructed 
about the prehistoric and historic human past from the 
material remains excavated and studied so meticulously. 
Chapter 12 begins with the earliest humans and their 
stone tools,  which provide evidence for how they made a 
living hunting,  gathering,  or scavenging and spread 
around the world. In Chapter 13,  you see how the first 
global warming affected populations everywhere,  and 
what artifacts,  remains of early domestic plants and ani-
mals,  and settlement patterns tell about how people 
changed and adapted. Chapter 14 tells the story of the 
rise of the first ancient states (and some of the later ones) 
in all their glory. In Chapter 15,  I detail some of the things 
you can discover by doing historic archaeology — uncov-
ering things (or people) the written history never 
mentions.

iological anthropologists examine the fossil bones of the earliest human 
ancestors in Africa to get an idea of what they were like 2 to 3 million 
years ago. Archaeologists look at the cultural remains these human ancestors 
left behind — the oldest artifacts (things made and used by people) and the 
ancient landscapes — to reconstruct how they lived. This chapter describes 
that archaeological record to give you the big picture about humanity’s remote 
past. I take you through the ages from the earliest known artifacts — crude-
looking stone tools of the Lower Paleolithic era — through the archaeology of 
Neanderthals and modern humans in the Middle Paleolithic.
By the time anatomically modern humans emerged some 100,000 years ago, 
people had spread all over Africa, Asia, and Europe. They made a living 
by hunting and gathering (mostly gathering — it’s easier). By 35,000 years 
ago, the dawn of the Upper Paleolithic age, they had elaborate art and 
tools showing they were expert hunters of the Ice Age big game animals 
that roamed northern latitudes (and other big creatures in more southerly, 
warmer latitudes).
In the process of moving around all those latitudes, people first came to 
Australia around 50,000 years ago and to North and South America at least 
as early as 15,000 years ago. (The only continent left, Antarctica, wasn’t too 
hospitable until the advent of modern technology.)

196
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
As you read through this chapter and see how archaeology documents the 
beginning of the human career, keep an eye on the chart in the appendix so 
you don’t mix up your humans and time periods. The map in the appendix 
helps you see locations of the important sites I describe, and gives you an 
idea of how much land the earliest people had to cross to populate the world.
Our Family Tree
 
To set the stage for explaining the oldest cultural remains that archaeology 
investigates, first I’ll describe a little of the biological background. Biological 
anthropologists called paleoanthropologists or human paleontologists have 
found fossil bones of many early hominids or hominins (creatures like us but 
maybe or maybe not directly ancestral to the modern human family) all over 
Africa. Everyone argues about how old each one is, which is our direct 
ancestor, or which branches of the family tree died out. And of course, they 
all have complicated species names (like Australopithecus africanus, one of 
the earliest in southern Africa). Some of the tiny bone and teeth fragments 
(you never get a whole skeleton) are as old as 5 million years. By 2 million 
years ago, they’re close enough to modern humans to be in the actual human 
genus (Homo), and have species names like Homo habilis (“handyman” — the 
stone tool maker).We, of course, are Homo sapiens.
 
Scientific investigations of early human forms are not archaeology, though 
paleoanthropology uses many of archaeology’s methods (picks, shovels, 
screens). Archaeology comes into play when you want to investigate how 
these human ancestral creatures lived, based on all the other material objects 
besides their bones.
Paleoanthropologists need archaeology to help interpret their own finds. You 
may be familiar with the famous work of Louis Leakey in Tanzania’s Olduvai 
Gorge (see map in the appendix) in East Africa. He searched for early human 
ancestors there because he’d actually seen those rough, chipped stones he 
knew were early tools lying around.
Archaeologists also look at the entire landscape in which hominins lived, 
to see things like what resources were available and what dangers were out 
there. (Not dinosaurs, but certainly big African beasts.) They work with the 
other scientists to combine all this evidence with information from the fossil 
bones: Bigger teeth for eating plants? Smaller teeth for eating meat? Broken 
animal bones showing they did eat meat? Hands still adapted for climbing 
trees, as with their more ape-like ancestors? Hands with bone structure that 
could have gripped stone tools? The goal is to fill in the picture of how the 
earliest animals in the human family tree made a living in their environments.

197
 Chapter 12: Early Humans: Original Cave Guys & Gals
 
Humans are set apart from the rest of the animal kingdom by our unique 
adaptation, culture, which includes everything from language to making 
artifacts, shaping environments, and planning. But chimps in the wild use 
and even make a few crude tools of stone and grass stems. In fact, even 
crows have been observed using rocks or wire as tools! So archaeology 
shows how humans became set apart as cultural beings as the evidence of 
more complex culture appears over the millennia.
The Lower Paleolithic Era: The 
Earliest People and Culture
 
As soon as you get artifacts — the remains of cultural behavior — you can 
do the archaeology of the earliest creatures who can be labeled people. To 
characterize this dawn of humanity, archaeologists use the term Paleolithic, 
meaning (from the Greek root words) “Old Stone Age.” It’s a cultural time 
period characterized by those well-preserved stone artifacts. The Paleolithic 
extended from over 2 million years ago to about 10,000 years ago. The Lower 
Paleolithic is the oldest division within this time period, beginning as soon as 
you have the oldest artifacts. New finds keep pushing this date back.
Oldest archaeological finds
The oldest known stone tools are some 2.5 million years old. The first actual 
artifacts were probably far older and made of softer materials like bark, 
wood, or bone. Chipping stone tools is hard — first you have to go find the 
right kind of stone, bash it in just the right way, and then quite possibly clean 
up the blood you just shed. But stone lasts, so the earliest artifacts still 
preserved are pebbles chipped to have sharp edges (see Figure 12-1).
Pebble tools may have been for digging out roots or chopping up vegetables 
or meat. They could have been for killing animals or hacking at scavenged 
carcasses. Some animal bones at hominin sites have teeth marks of other 
animals, overlapped by cut marks from stone tools. Some animal bones have 
been snapped and bashed open to get the nutritious marrow, something only 
humans would do (and would presumably need tools to accomplish).
The other very important and famous archaeological evidence of the earliest 
human ancestors is the hominin footprints excavated at the Laetoli site in 
Tanzania (see the map in the appendix) by Mary Leakey (Louis’s wife, an 
archaeologist). They were made some 3 million years ago by at least two 
individuals, in the soft mud of a lake bed, where they were quickly covered 
by volcanic ash and preserved (along with footprints of other animals, 
possibly all running from the erupting volcano).

The lives of early humans
Anthropological views of how our earliest ancestors made a living and 
became human have become more scientific. Combining the fossil evidence 
and archaeological reconstructions of material culture, interpretations have 
changed over the decades. Here’s a sequence of these changing assumptions:
 
 Early humans came up with culture as they developed the skills to hunt 
and kill animals for a living.
 
 Our small (3-foot-tall), upright-walking ancestor probably did not hunt 
or kill much but mostly cooperated in gathering plants and other things 
that didn’t run away or attack (eggs and small, slow animals).
 
 Scavenging for meat is an even easier way to get more nutritious food. 
So they probably waited for a better hunter such as a lion to kill some 
game, and then ate the leftovers (but weren’t picky about cuts of meat 
from that chewed-up antelope).
Early society: Still a lot of mystery
Although archaeologists can reconstruct what early hominins ate and how they 
made some artifacts, they have no real evidence for what early society was 
like — not that that’s stopped speculation. Here’s another list of hypotheses on 
the earliest family values and how the interpretations have changed over the last 
several decades:
 
 Bigger skeletons were male, smaller ones female; men hunted and 
protected women and children, who foraged close to home.

199
 Chapter 12: Early Humans: Original Cave Guys & Gals
 
 Bigger skeletons may just be separate species; each species lived 
somewhat differently in different environments.
 
 Men gathered and scavenged food and brought it back in return for sex 
from women, who stayed at camp to have and raise kids.
 
 Men maybe got some meat, but women gathered the plants that made 
up most of the diet and were used to make artifacts like baby-carrying 
nets.
 
 Everyone gathered, scavenged, and cared for each other and the kids; 
everyone had sex with lots of partners; families consisted of women and 
their children, with men hanging around the larger group. Meat came 
from scavenging, much easier than hunting.
You can imagine the arguments over these ideas! The material evidence is so 
slim that it can support many different and conflicting arguments. The most 
popular version is the “sex for meat” idea (probably because it looks good in 
the tabloids), but it reflects a modern bias of Western culture.
The Later Lower Paleolithic Era: 
Moving Out of Africa
Archaeologists recognize that big cultural changes took place sometime 
after 2 million years ago. Stone tools became more sophisticated, and 
other archaeological finds, like piles of tools and butchered bones, indicate 
human ancestors were doing more complex things like establishing base-
camp living sites. Most important, the material evidence shows that some 
human ancestors were moving out of Africa to populate other parts of the 
world.
 
The Pleistocene or Ice Age is the geological time period stretching from 2 
million to 10,000 years ago. Nearly all human development happens within 
this time. Note that the geological and archaeological ages end at about 
the same time (due to massive climate change). But the earliest human-like 
creatures and stone tools appear a bit before the Ice Age began.
Sometime after 2 million years ago, hominins spread from Africa into Asia 
and Europe (see the time chart in the appendix). New species were taller 
and more modern-looking. (One of these species is Homo erectus, but I 
won’t worry about all the names here because they’re not usually within the 
domain of archaeology). Archaeological evidence shows the use of fire (a 
good thing for staying warm, if they’re moving north from the tropics) and 
many artifact types and remains of animal bones from meals.

Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
Lower Paleolithic artifacts
 
The most typical stone tool of later Lower Paleolithic is the hand axe (refer to 
Figure 12-1). It’s pear-shaped and chipped on both sides to get a sharp edge 
all around. The early people may have held it in their hands or used it with a 
handle to kill or butcher game, chop fruit, or dig up roots. Hand axes are the 
longest-used artifacts humans have ever had!
Early humans made chunky tools like hand axes by chipping away flakes 
from the stone pebble or cobble core. They then made other tools from 
those leftover sharp flakes. Their toolkits had artifacts called choppers, 
scrapers, chisels, and so on, based on what they may have been used for. 
Besides these new stone artifacts, by the later part of the Lower Paleolithic 
you see greater sophistication in the archaeological record, as I describe in 
the next section.
Lower Paleolithic sites
 
One famous Lower Paleolithic site is the 1.8-million-year-old Trinil site 
discovered in Java in the 1850s. Nobody believed at first that the stone 
tools and human-like skeletons (called “Java Man” and later Homo erectus) 
found there could be from so early, but modern dating methods (discussed 
in Chapter 10) confirmed their great age. Other famous Lower Paleolithic 
sites:
 
 700,000-year-old Zhoukoudien Cave, near Beijing, China, had evidence 
of human-made fire, some 200,000 stone tools, and 40 Homo erectus 
skeletons. They were first named “Peking Man,” but the bones were lost 
during World War II. (Luckily, someone had made plaster casts!)
 
 Olorgesailie in Kenya dates to 800,000 years ago and has thousands of 
hand axes and other stone artifacts as well as baboon bones.
 
 Atapuerca, in northern Spain, has earlier hominin remains dating to 
800,000 years (with one tooth possibly well over a million years old), and 
in one cave, over 30 skeletons of people pushed into a 50-foot-deep pit 
around 350,000 years ago. Researchers argue over whether this find 
represents deliberate burial of the dead or just interesting corpse storage.
 
 Terra Amata, on the French Riviera, 350,000 years old, had hand axes, 
animal and fish remains, and rocks arranged in patterns suggesting they 
held up poles for huts, with fire hearths inside.
 
 Torralba and Ambrona sites in Spain had bones of butchered elephants 
and other extinct big game animals.

The animal remains at Zhoukoudien show that the inhabitants hunted and 
cooked over 90 different species of animals! Although a few archaeologists 
think scavenging was still the most important food-getting technique, most 
agree that the wide array of remains shows real hunting and cooking fires for 
the earliest barbecues.
Coprolites, or fossilized human feces (yes — prehistoric poop), at Terra 
Amata indicate people ate plants harvested in late spring and early fall. With 
the fish, shellfish, and animal bones also found there, the evidence suggests 
they were camping during specific seasons.
 
Lower Paleolithic people lived successfully in the early Ice Age, even though 
it was very cold. They organized hunts for those Ice Age megafauna (big 
game). But archaeologists have little evidence to figure out how they carried 
out other activities of daily life or organized their communities. Did they talk? 
Sing? Dance? Believe in the supernatural? Clearly, they shared food, help, and 
skills, but how did they think? Some scientists say they couldn’t even talk yet, 
but I believe they did. How else can you teach someone to hunt rhinoceros, 
make a fire, dig up a ripe tuber, or build a shelter?
The Middle Paleolithic Era
Some time after 300,000 years ago (see the time chart in the appendix), the 
cultural evidence changed, so archaeologists give this time period a new 
name, the Middle Paleolithic. Complex planning and skills were necessary to 
produce the new Middle Paleolithic stone tools, such as triangular points 
(for spears or knives — refer to Figure 12-1). Butchered animal bones at sites 
show widely successful hunting. Neanderthals and other later hominin forms 
(very few skeletons are known, and scientists argue about what names to 
give them all) are associated with Middle Paleolithic tools.
Neanderthals
Of the many later fossil human forms living in Europe and western Asia, 
none is more of a puzzle than the Neanderthal. This hominin first appeared 
about 200,000 years ago. It had a rugged but modern-looking human skeleton, 
except for the head — Neanderthal skulls show a heavy brow ridge, flattened 
top, and elongated back. Their brain sizes averaged a little bigger than ours, 
and their muscles (which leave markings on the bone) were bigger, too. The 
robust bodies of Neanderthals appear to be a result of their cold Ice Age 
climate and rough environment.

Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
Understanding Neanderthal skeletons is of course not directly part of 
archaeology. But because archaeologists excavate the cultural remains of 
these human ancestors, they need to coordinate them with the knowledge 
of their physical bodies.
In terms of time period of existence, the Neanderthals overlap with the 
anatomically modern humans, who first appeared by at least 100,000 
years ago; they may or may not have lived with modern humans who 
moved into their lands. By around 30,000 years ago, all humans had 
modern skeletons like ours. Scientists argue about whether Neanderthals 
became extinct or mated with Homo sapiens immigrants from Africa to 
become part of our ancestral line. DNA analysis of bones from three or 
four Neanderthals shows that they indeed weren’t as closely related to us 
as direct ancestors would be. But this is only a small sample size so far.
Neanderthal artifacts, food remains, and even burials show little about how 
their families and societies were organized. In fact, skeletal remains of early 
modern humans are in some cases associated with Middle Paleolithic tools. 
So the artifact types aren’t necessarily specific to each hominin species.
Middle Paleolithic artifacts and sites
Middle Paleolithic people more frequently made their characteristic stone 
tools from large, thick flint flakes rather than the pebble cores of earlier eras. 
The more than 60 types of stone tools recognized include borers, scrapers, 
and serrated-edge implements, as well as several types of triangular points 
and knives. Cave and rock shelter (shallow cave) sites in Europe and the 
Middle East have produced piles of the chipping debris from the manufacture 
of these tools, as well as butchered bones of mammoth, wooly rhinos, and 
other Ice Age game, and even the occasional preserved wooden spear. A few 
sites have hearths or intentionally-constructed fire pits.
At Middle Paleolithic cave sites in South Africa, archaeologists have uncovered 
complex artifacts dating to 75,000 years ago, including polished bone tools, 
snail-shell beads, engraved bone, and pieces of red ochre (iron oxide, a red 
stone used for pigment) with engraved patterns in a cross-hatched design that 
could be the earliest art or symbolism.
The earliest intentional burials of the dead date from the Middle Paleolithic, 
so you can say this may indicate spiritual practices, though it may just be for 
sanitation and to prohibit scavenging by animals.

203
 Chapter 12: Early Humans: Original Cave Guys & Gals
Neanderthal lifeways
At Shanidar Cave in Iraq (dug in the 1950s and ’60s), Neanderthal burials 
70,000 years old were excavated. One man’s skeleton showed injuries that 
would have left him disabled. Yet he was over 40 when he died, a ripe old 
age (for the Stone Age, anyway), so somebody was obviously taking care 
of him. On top of another skeleton was pollen from many plants, a find that 
suggested different flowers were left on the body (though some argue the 
pollen was just a natural occurrence).
Other Middle Paleolithic sites have lots of red ochre with skeletons or 
artifacts. Red was clearly an important color. It can mean death (as in 
killing animals) and perhaps life too (women who menstruated could get 
pregnant). Neanderthals probably did have some kinds of spiritual beliefs, 
but reconstructing those beliefs from the evidence so far is difficult.
The Upper Paleolithic Era: Modern 
Humans Populate the World
Archaeologists originally designated the Upper Paleolithic era as the time 
in which completely modern humans took over and developed art and very 
complex, standardized tool types, beginning around 35,000 years ago (see 
the time chart in the appendix). The most accepted theory about human 
development is that anatomically-modern humans (Homo sapiens — 
sometimes known by the old-fashioned term Cro-Magnons), evolved in 
Africa over 100,000 years ago with superior brains and skills. They then 
spread out to Asia and Europe. An alternative theory is that all the 
hominins already existing across the continents shared enough genetic 
material to evolve slowly into Homo sapiens in many different regions.
 
Remember that much of this argument about Neanderthals and modern 
humans is in the domain of human biology. Archaeology can only offer 
evidence for the cultural abilities of these early human forms. The advances 
of the Upper Paleolithic may indeed be due to the superior brain power of 
modern humans (though it took them a while). Or maybe it was just the 
right time to do something new. But I must note that some Neanderthal 
remains have been found with Upper Paleolithic tools. The body type 
doesn’t necessarily dictate how sophisticated the brain was!

Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
Upper Paleolithic artifacts
Some of the stone-tool manufacturing processes went from banging and 
bashing to pressing during the Upper Paleolithic. With pressure-flaking, the 
craftworker used a stone, bone, or antler tool to press off tiny stone flakes. 
This process made the point or other tool very thin and fine; check out an 
example in Figure 12-2a.

Blade tools were another Upper Paleolithic innovation. A blade is a flake 
that’s twice as long as it is wide. If you prepare your flint core well, you can 
strike off many blades that are the same size and shape — and very sharp.
Other tools, such as barbed harpoons (refer to Figure 12-2b), were made of 
bone, antler, or ivory. Another characteristic of Upper Paleolithic artifacts is 
standardization. A whole pile may all be the same size and shape — prehistoric 
quality control!
Upper Paleolithic art
Art appeared on the scene in several forms during the Upper Paleolithic:
 
 Portable art, such as figurines carved of ivory or sculpted in fired clay (a 
new technology).

205
 Chapter 12: Early Humans: Original Cave Guys & Gals
 
 Other portable objects, such as bone or antler pieces with engraved 
lines. These may have been art or perhaps maps, calendars, or tally 
sheets.
 
 Stationary art, such as paintings and engravings on rock walls of caves.
What this art means is constantly debated. Figurines of naked women (many 
very hefty) are commonly called symbols of fertility or sex (see Figure 12-2c) 
but could be prehistoric dolls, goddess figures, or portraits of mom. Other 
figurines are of men and animals, with equally mysterious symbolism.
 
Animals and occasionally human figures are depicted on Upper Paleolithic 
cave walls, too. The most famous cave, Lascaux, in southwest France (also 
discussed in Chapter 20), has colorful paintings of bison, horses, and deer, 
as well as other (nonhunted) animals such as lions and birds. The pictures 
also include enigmatic lines that may be spears, lightning, or something else 
entirely. Cosquer Cave, now underwater on the south French coast, has 
paintings of fish, penguins, and jellyfish.
Upper Paleolithic lifeways: 
People on the move
Maybe because they had better tools, Upper Paleolithic people were 
excellent hunters. Their art may have centered on hunting magic, to 
guarantee success. Or perhaps it was just shared symbols at places where 
annual gatherings took place and knowledge was passed on to the next 
generation. The people looked just like modern humans, yet the evidence 
is still not enough to tell whether they thought and acted like us.
Floating toward Australia (and leaving stuff behind)
 
During the Ice Age, ocean water was locked up in the ice that covered much 
of the Northern Hemisphere, so sea levels were lower than today. Islands in 
Southeast Asia were then connected land exposed on the continental shelf. 
Remains of modern humans dating as early as 46,000 years ago (the earliest 
human evidence in Southeast Asia) have been excavated in Niah Cave on 
Borneo (Malaysia — see the map in the appendix and Figure 12-3). With 
them were pig, monkey, and lizard bones with cut marks — probably from 
butchering — and fragments of nuts and yams that would be poisonous to eat 
without complicated processing. This evidence shows people developed 
complex skills early in the favorable environment of the tropical forest.

It’s no surprise that these sophisticated early modern Upper Paleolithic 
humans made it to Australia by as early as 50,000 years ago. They had to 
cross about 60 miles of open water; they probably used rafts of tied logs or 
even dugout canoes, but no watercraft are preserved.
After they got to Australia, they quickly adapted to its rugged mountains and 
deserts. On the coast, they left shell middens (garbage piles) full of fish bones 
and shells from the seafood they ate. Besides stone axes, the archaeology of 
Australia features rock art not that different from Paleolithic art in Europe. 
Engravings and paintings of animals, people, and geometric shapes on the 
walls of caves and rock faces are hard to date, however, so some of the sites 
may be later than the Paleolithic.
At archaeological sites around Lake Mungo in New South Wales, Australia, 
finds include fire hearths; shells; fish, mammal, and bird bones; eggshells; 
and bone and stone tools dating to between 32,000 and 20,000 years ago. 
Human bones have red ochre pigment with them, and one skeleton was 
cremated — the oldest known example of this treatment of the dead.
Heading to America by land or by sea
Both the date and the route of people’s first entrance into the New World (North 
and South America) are hotly debated. Most evidence indicates that Upper 
Paleolithic people spread from northeast Asia into North America about 15,000 
to 20,000 years ago. They hunted big game such as mammoths, mastodons, giant 
sloths, and a giant armadillo species as big as a compact car.

207
 Chapter 12: Early Humans: Original Cave Guys & Gals
The lower sea level during the Ice Age exposed a land bridge where the Bering 
Strait is today between Siberia and Alaska (see the map in the appendix). 
Hunters following their hoofed food moved eastward from Asia. They probably 
had no idea they were walking into a new continent. Another idea is that 
fishers moving along the frigid coast cruised around the same way by water; 
this tactic would have been far easier because you can sit down in a boat.
Archaeologists evaluating these hypotheses face the problem that any 
ancient prehistoric sites on the coastline are now drowned, because sea level 
rose after the Ice Age when all that ice melted and ran into the ocean. Finding 
such submerged sites would be nearly impossible, especially in frigid 
northern waters.
Other theories that people sailed across the Pacific or Atlantic to get to 
America are far less likely. One older suggestion gaining new popularity is 
that Spanish and French Paleolithic folks cruised westward to North America. 
This idea is based on similarities between a few types of finely made stone 
spear points on both continents. But DNA studies show Native Americans are 
closer to Asians than to Europeans.
The first Americans probably did more than hunt big game for meat. Even 
modern cultures who hunt don’t get meat that often; it’s far easier to fish or 
gather plants, so mammoth burgers were probably a rare treat. The bias here 
comes because animal bones are better preserved than plant matter, so “kill” 
sites showing butchering of mammoths, mastodons, or extinct species of 
bison are more recoverable than early salad bars.
Paleo-Indian archaeological evidence
The earliest Americans are called Paleo-Indians. Until recently, their oldest 
characteristic artifacts were thought to be chipped-stone Clovis points 
(named after a site in New Mexico where they were first found) and other 
types of fluted spear points. A flute is a large flake up the center of each side 
of the point, possibly to make it easier to connect to the spear shaft. These 
long, thin points are the result of pressure-flaking (see Figure 12-4). They 
come from sites all over North and South America that date as early as about 
11,200 B.C. (some 13,000 years ago).
A puzzle in Paleo-Indian archaeology is that, for some time, many of the 
very earliest known sites were in South America. Newcomers would have 
had to move through North America first (they may have just walked fast). 
Now archaeologists can see that, especially moving along the Pacific coastal 
route, the first Americans could easily have filled up the landscape in a few 
centuries of settling, prospering, and expanding. One factor may have been 
that the vast herds of game in the New World were easy to harvest because 
they weren’t used to hunting pressure. Another factor may have been that 
these early hunter–gatherers were always on the move (following the herds 
throughout the year) and would have had no trouble spreading out in all the 
available attractive land. So far no evidence indicates any pressure they may 

208
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
have faced to move on except for their own expanding populations. And now 
some very old sites in North America have been verified.

A few archaeological sites older than Clovis (mentioned earlier in this section) 
have been discovered. One is Monte Verde, in Chile, on the west coast of South 
America, dated to at least 11,800 B.C. (see the map in the appendix). It’s a wet 
site in a bog, so usually perishable remains were preserved, including wooden 
houses, vegetable foods, and a few animal bones of mastodon and extinct 
camels. I discuss it further in Chapter 18.
The Topper Site in South Carolina has produced the oldest dates yet in the 
New World. Digging below the Clovis layer, archaeologists found crude-
looking flaked stone tools in a level dated to up to 50,000 years old. But the 
finds are controversial; some argue that the tools are really natural rocks 
chipped by some other process.
In Chapter 18, I detail more of the controversies on the first Americans 
and a cool new find from Oregon: human coprolites dated to older than 
14,000 years ago. Watch for exciting new finds in Paleo-Indian archaeology 
as techniques improve and the search continues!

 Chapter 12: Early Humans: Original Cave Guys & Gals
Combating stereotypes of cave guys
The cave man is a common stereotype, from 
Fred Flintstone to the misunderstood television 
characters. He’s a hairy, hunched-over brute, 
dragging away his cave woman by the hair. 
This depiction is fun but scientifically all wrong. 
(For example, dinosaurs had been gone for 65 
million years before early humans appeared on 
the planet — sorry, Dino!)
Most Paleolithic sites were probably in the 
open, easy to get to, and away from cave 
bears. But caves and rock shelters (shallow 
niches) are better preserved for archaeologists 
to dig. Yes, Paleolithic people had lots of stone 
tools, but most of their everyday artifacts were 
probably made of wood, fiber, and bone. These 
tools would have been easier to make but 
seldom are preserved.
The first complete Neanderthal skeleton 
discovered (in France in 1908) happened to 
be of a stooped, arthritic man. Unfortunately, 
it has served as the model for Neanderthals 
and other cave folks ever after. In reality, 
completely upright walking is the main 
characteristic defining all the hominin skeletons, 
going back over 2 million years. The crude, 
rude, and ignorant character for early humans 
may have originated as a racist view to help 
differentiate them from the superior moderns 
(especially the scientists doing the theorizing). 
But remember that Neanderthals were 
evidently stronger than modern humans and 
had bigger brains. 
Archaeologists have absolutely no evidence 
that Paleolithic men did all the hunting and 
other interesting stuff. Women hunt and do 
other rough jobs in many cultures around the 
world, even while carrying the babies. (And 
who knows when the revolutionary concept of 
the babysitter was invented?) Artifact finds (so 
far) don’t tell how families or the larger society 
may have been structured.
Archaeologists do now have evidence of 
Paleolithic nets and other fiber artifacts from 
preserved impressions in wet clay. This may 
mean that big game animals were actually 
hunted by setting traps and then throwing 
nets over the animals and clubbing them (less 
dangerous than running up to a mammoth or 
wild bull to spear it). So most reconstructions of 
Paleolithic life are educated guesses based on 
the evidence, but the evidence keeps increasing. 
But yes, they probably did wear fur outfits — 
the Ice Age was cold!

Climate Change and 
Early Food Production

 Early farming villages in the Old and New World

T
oday you may be worried about how global warming affects us, but never 
fear: This chapter shows how humanity already survived the same kind 
of massive climate change at the end of the Ice Age about 10,000 years ago, 
marking the end of the Paleolithic cultural period and beginning of what’s 
called the Mesolithic era (Middle Stone Age) in the Old World (Europe, Asia, 
Africa) and the Archaic period in the New World (North and South America).
Ice Age big game became extinct, so people switched to hunting modern 
animals and continued gathering wild plants and fishing. They also began 
domesticating species and producing their food — a huge step, meaning 
far more work. Within a couple of millennia, the Neolithic (New Stone Age) 
began. Gardening intensified to become farming and herding. Significant 
social and economic divisions also appeared — the earliest rich folks.
Food-producing peoples all over the Earth changed their world. They man-
aged and manipulated different plants and animals in large numbers. They 
cleared and burned forests for cultivating fields and raised herds of grazing 
animals that probably obliterated grasslands. They built mounds, earth-
works, and huge stone monuments that stood out, and made villages and 
towns very human, in contrast to the natural landscape.

212
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
The later Neolithic era saw more specialization — metalworking, stone con-
struction, and other crafts — so these times have more specific archaeologi-
cal terms like “Bronze Age.” The stage was being set for the emergence of the 
first civilizations, which I discuss in Chapter 14.
The Foraging Life: The First Global 
Warming, 10,000 B.C.
When the Pleistocene (Ice Age) ended, the climate warmed and environments 
changed enormously. But culture is conservative: People may resist change, 
but they often end up changing just by trying to do the same thing under 
different conditions. This is what happened during the Mesolithic period in 
the Old World and Archaic period in the New World. (Archaeologists give 
these time periods different names in different hemispheres because the 
changes supposedly took place slightly later in the New World.)
In the Holocene or current geological age, Ice Age ice melted and poured into 
the oceans. Rivers backed up and created estuaries and bays, productive 
environments full of aquatic species for people to harvest. Pleistocene 
megafauna (large animals) like mammoths and mastodons became extinct.
Archaeological finds of post-Ice Age foragers indicate they adapted well to 
massive change in their environments. Some groups probably did die out, 
but successful ones developed the following characteristics:
 
 Expertise in getting plants and animals from local regions
 
 Intricate craftwork in stone, bone, antler, fiber/fabrics, and ceramics
 
 More complex social organization and maybe even some societies with 
hereditary positions, though most probably remained pretty egalitarian 
(socially equal across the board)
 
 More settled life than earlier folks and larger settlements (camps and villages)
 
 Deliberate burial of the dead in cemeteries, perhaps to mark territories
 
 Good health; skeletons look fairly healthy (after all, they got fresh fruits, 
vegetables, meats and fish, and lots of exercise)
Postglacial foragers continued hunting the animals still out there; grinding 
stones show processing of more plants into soup, bread, or mush. Evidence 
for fishing and shellfish collecting becomes more widespread; shellfish beds 
would have spread all over those shallow estuaries and bays. Shell middens 
(garbage piles with these food remains) are common on coasts worldwide 
after the end of the Ice Age. They look like remains of giant clambakes. But 
among the shells they have bones of fish and other animals that would’ve 
produced more meat than shellfish.

213
 Chapter 13: The Last 10,000 Years: Climate Changes and Early Food Production
 
No written records exist this far back in time. Everything known about the 
huge changes that took place in everyday human life comes from the archaeo-
logical record (although sometimes other sciences can help). Biologists and 
geologists can reconstruct natural environments, and linguists can trace ori-
gins of languages and their movements across the land. But for explaining the 
consequences of long-term changes in daily living, archaeologists are the best 
(even if they argue about causes and details).
 
Mesolithic and Archaic people didn’t have to work too hard. Contrary to 
popular opinion, their lives weren’t nasty and brutish. Studies of the few living 
hunter–gatherer–fishers around the world show that foraging isn’t difficult, 
especially in rich environments. You have to work only three to four days 
a week getting wild foods; the rest of the time you can fool around or loaf. 
Growing crops or animals is much harder and takes more time.
Old World Mesolithic hunter–gatherers
The Mesolithic was the archaeological time period after the end of the Ice 
Age but before food production (see the time chart in the appendix). It begins 
sometime after 10,000 years ago, as world climates slowly warmed and rain-
fall increased. Forests replaced tundra in northern latitudes, and grasslands 
and lakes covered much of the Sahara. Human cultures developed new tech-
nologies and settled in favorable places.
Cave art and figurines apparently disappeared for a while, at least in Europe. 
People were probably making other arts and crafts of perishable materials 
like wood. But archaeologists have found evidence (house and village pat-
terns in the soil) for more planned settlements. People became more seden-
tary, staying in one place year-round. Instead of following herds of game, they 
used more resources more intensively in one area (although this arrange-
ment didn’t necessarily mean less walking).
Mesolithic sites have evidence for early social ranking — in other words, 
some people look more important than others. Look for deliberate burial of 
the dead in cemeteries and especially for graves that may have more wealth 
items than the rest.
 
At Vedbaek in Denmark, burial offerings included red ochre coloring and 
animal-teeth jewelry from 4,800 B.C. onward. One grave had an adult female, 
with snail shells and deer teeth at her head and waist, next to a baby who had 
a flint blade and was lying on a swan’s wing (the bones were preserved). This 
setup may have just been a soft bed, a social status marker, or a sign of some 
spiritual belief. Another skeleton in this cemetery, an adult male buried with 
a female and a child, had a bone point stuck through the neck. Was this evi-
dence of early violence or warfare? Or just a bad hunting accident?

214
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
By 10,000 B.C., the Mesolithic Jomon culture in coastal Japan left typical shell 
midden sites full of fish bone. These folks also were the first to invent fired-
clay pots to use for cooking and storing things. This was probably not a revo-
lutionary idea at the time — they’d always had stone bowls, gourd bottles, 
and even waterproof baskets (covered in pitch). But archaeologists love 
pottery because it’s usually preserved and provides more information about 
past people than just stone tools.
New World Archaic cultures
During the Archaic period (see the time chart in the appendix), North and 
South America experienced the same change as the Old World did during the 
Mesolithic, at about the same time or slightly later. Environments got warmer 
and wetter. As big game became extinct, hunters took deer and small game. 
Chipped stone projectile points changed from long lance-shaped forms of 
Paleo-Indian times to Archaic stemmed and notched shapes (shown in Figure 
13-1). Foraging groups settled in forests and on coasts to collect fruit, nuts, 
and seafood. You can see the beginnings of social difference in burials with 
more or fewer grave goods. New World folks also invented pottery, a little 
later and independently from its invention in the Old World.

Windover is a famous Archaic site in Florida dating to 5,000 to 6,000 B.C. It 
was a pond in which ancient Native Americans buried their dead; the wet 
conditions preserved usually perishable remains: wood, bone, and antler 
tools and many varieties of sophisticated woven fabrics. This discovery was 
already unusual and amazing when archaeologists made even more astound-
ing finds: The brown slimy masses inside some of the skulls of the over 160 
burials turned out to be preserved human brains! DNA and medical studies of 

215
 Chapter 13: The Last 10,000 Years: Climate Changes and Early Food Production
these materials are producing information about health, genes, and diet. What 
archaeologists didn’t find — more than a handful of stone tools — was also 
interesting. Nearly all artifacts were of organic materials that usually rot away. 
If the wet conditions hadn’t preserved them, the site would’ve been consid-
ered insignificant and bulldozed away for a housing development.
Revolution in the New Stone Age: 
Growing Food
The hunter–gatherer way of life continued until modern times in many places 
worldwide (like Australia and California). But many cultures moved from just 
getting wild foods to growing their own. This shift was such a big deal that 
it’s sometimes called the Neolithic Revolution. Neolithic means “New Stone 
Age,” but revolution means fast change, and this transition was probably 
pretty gradual because it changed everything else about life too.
 
Producing your own reliable food sources sounds like it would be easier, but 
it wasn’t. Tending crops or herds is much harder work than just getting stuff 
in the wild. Farming and herding require long hours of work every single day. 
You have to get up with the chickens, till the soil, plant the crops, feed the 
animals, water the crops, water the animals, weed and fertilize the crops, keep 
the animals from eating the crops, and so on — you get the picture.
Why would people want to change their lives to work so hard producing food 
instead of collecting it from the environment? Some possible reasons include 
the following:
 
 People gradually domesticated (genetically changed) wild species in 
their natural habitats by just helping them along with minimal cultiva-
tion (weeding, watering, and fertilizing).
 
 People domesticated species when they took them away from their 
original wild habitats to grow elsewhere.
 
 Gathering wild species increased people’s knowledge and control of 
them over the centuries, so domestication came naturally.
 
 Populations may have naturally grown until people had to do something 
new to get more from the land and feed everyone.
 
 Climate changed enough to make many wild food sources unreliable, so 
people had to grow their own to be sure to eat.
 
 When climates warmed up in the Middle East, people and animals natu-
rally gathered around oases (water sources) and became familiar with 
each other (and with local plants), leading to domestication.

216
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
 
 Some individuals were naturally greedy and wanted to build up surplus 
food wealth more efficiently, so they persuaded others to help them 
produce food.
 
 Some plants naturally responded better to a little care and became so 
productive that people picked them as staple crops.
Archaeologists keep arguing about whether domestication took place 
gradually or quickly, in times of abundance or stress, and at the hands 
of men or women. Different theories work better in different areas. The 
real reasons and conditions for early gardening and herding are probably 
different combinations of these factors in different regions of the world. 
Food production probably started out small, growing just a few foods in 
case of shortages in the wild. But after it began, few prehistoric societies 
went back to full-time foraging in the wild.
Believe it or not, genetic engineering is nothing new! For over 10,000 years 
people have been changing genes of plants and animals to produce desired 
characteristics. It works not through natural selection but rather cultural 
selection, breeding or planting only those individuals with characteristics 
closest to what you want. It takes a long time; you don’t just bring in a wolf 
cub or wild calf and tame it — you have to breed many generations of gentle 
ones until you get a species that’s always going to be that way. The only 
difference between early domestication and today’s genetic engineering is 
that scientists today can go into the cell and change the DNA more quickly 
than waiting for many generations of breeding.
Archaeologists can see results of this selective breeding in Neolithic finds. 
The following list gives you some examples of genetically changed organisms:
 
 Bigger seeds, nuts, grains, and fruits (for more food).
 
 Wheat or other grains with seeds held securely to the plant. This 
development allows humans to collect and selectively redistribute the 
seed instead of letting the plant reseed itself.
 
 Larger, hairier sheep, goats, and cattle with smaller, less dangerous 
horns. This change provides more meat, wool, and hide and reduces the 
danger of injury to the herder.
 
 Dogs, cattle, and horses that are docile and ready to work for people.
 
 Plants and animals with other desirable characteristics of color, taste, 
and rapid growth.
Evidence of early domesticated species can be charred seeds or fruits, pollen 
grains, animal bone fragments, or even residues left when someone didn’t 
wash the dishes! All give information on what gradually came under human 
production and where. Not everything was used for food; some animals were 
for working rather than eating, and some plants were for drugs or industrial 
uses such as making cloth.

Old World plants and animals 
(pasta, milk, wine)
Archaeological finds show many centers of domestication in the Old World 
(Africa, Asia, and Europe). Here’s a list of some important species and where 
they were first deliberately grown:
 
 Middle East (western Asia): Wheat, barley, rye, lentil, pistachio, date, 
olive, grape, goat, sheep, and cattle
 
 India/south Asia: Millet, cucumber, cotton, cattle, melon, citrus, plants 
for dyes, flax for linen or seeds, mung bean, and black pepper
 
 Southeast Asia: Taro, citrus, sugarcane, banana, and mango
 
 China: Millet, rice, pigs, melon, ducks, chickens, tea, hemp, peach, and 
silkworms
 
 Africa: Sorghum, cattle, coffee, barley, wheat, melon, and bottle gourd
 
 Widespread since the Paleolithic: Dogs
Dogs were the earliest domesticated animal, for work (hunting, pulling, and 
carrying), protection, sometimes food (no kidding), and maybe friendship. 
Sheep and goats came next — making them follow you around is easy (as 
Mary and her lamb can attest). But imagine trying to breed wild cattle!
 
As new finds come in, archaeologists keep debating which plants were 
cultivated earliest and where. Wheat and barley were among the first crops; 
they contributed to early versions of staple foods like bread, pasta, and 
mushy cereal. Recent excavations in the Jordan valley uncovered remains 
of figs from around 9,400 B.C. that look like the edible kind, dried and stored 
with still-wild varieties of oats, barley, and acorns. The date may mean these 
fruits were domesticated much earlier than the grain crops.
Finds of the bones of older animals (rather than the tender young ones 
preferred for food) at later Neolithic sites in Europe suggest cattle came to 
be used more for milk than beef. Artifacts like clay strainers and baskets 
appear by 5,000 B.C.; they may have been for processing milk to make cheese 
(which lasts much longer). Pottery fragments from Iran and Turkey between 
7,000 and 5,000 years old have residues of chemicals that can only be from 
wine. Though the wine was probably made from wild grapes, this plant soon 
became domesticated.

218
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
New World plants and animals 
(corn, chocolate, few animals)
The New World (North and South America) also had many centers of 
domestication. Think of where humanity would be without these important 
species that Native Americans gave to the world:
 
 Mexico and Central America: Corn (maize), squash, chocolate (cacao), 
and chili pepper
 
 South America: Potato, avocado, peanut, manioc (cassava), tomato, 
coca (leaf, for early drug use), llamas, guinea pigs, and quinoa
 
 North and South America: Bottle gourd, cotton, squashes, and beans
 
 Midwestern U.S.: Maygrass, little barley, knotweed, goosefoot, 
sunflowers, and tobacco
 
 Widespread since Paleo-Indian times: Dogs
Dogs probably came with the first people to America, but otherwise few 
other animals were around to domesticate. Prehistoric horses and cattle 
became extinct at the end of the Ice Age. These big animals didn’t reappear 
until Europeans brought them in the 1500s, so they weren’t around to be 
domesticated.
 
Is the lack of draft animals to pull them the reason that no wheeled vehicles 
were used in the Americas? Actually, the concept of the wheel was known; 
archaeologists have excavated tiny wheeled animal figurines along the Gulf 
Coast of Mexico. (They look like kids’ pull-toys, but they were probably for 
ceremonial purposes.) Would history (not to mention prehistory) have been 
different if North and South America had had faster land-based travel meth-
ods than walking or taking a boat?
The changes brought on 
by food production
With food production came many changes in human ways of life that are 
visible in the archaeological record. Here are a few of them:
 
 Pottery-making (and breaking!) became widespread, which is why 
archaeologists find so many potsherds.
 
 People were less mobile and more settled, so houses and other buildings 
were more permanent and left evidence of repair and rebuilding in the 
ground. Because people moved around less often, populations were larger 
and denser, and people had more and bigger stuff, so archaeologists have 
more to excavate.

219
 Chapter 13: The Last 10,000 Years: Climate Changes and Early Food Production
 
 Structures bigger and more important than houses appeared, indicating 
public buildings and group activities.
 
 Food production led to economic surpluses, so evidence of storage 
facilities such as animal pens and granaries appeared.
 
 Irrigation ditches may have been dug to water crops.
 
 Social differentiation became more evident, indicated by rich graves, 
larger houses, or other signs of wealth for a few people.
 
 Political organization shifted from the days of mostly egalitarian foragers. 
Leadership positions indicated by a few rich graves may have originally 
been socially determined, but later they became hereditary; you see this 
when you have rare wealth in graves of children who were too young to 
achieve such positions by the times of their deaths.
 
 People’s health changed — often for the worse! A constant diet of grain 
can mean poorer nutrition; denser, larger populations make epidemic 
diseases more widespread.
Farming Takes Off in the Old World
The Neolithic archaeological picture is relatively similar throughout the Old 
World, as food production took hold. (See the preceding section for details 
on the Neolithic “Revolution.”) The Old World archaeological record usually 
shows cultivated plants and animals being combined with wild ones obtained 
in the old ways. Each local region produced its own different domesticated 
species on its own timeline; the following sections give you information on 
the advent of farming and animal husbandry in some specific areas.
The Middle East: Early 
gardeners and herders
Food production began early in the eastern Mediterranean/western Asia 
region. Archaeological sites have produced bones of hunted gazelle and seeds 
of gathered wild grains from deeper levels as early as 10,000 B.C. Then in later 
levels (by 9,000 B.C.), finds include domesticated sheep and goat bones and 
cultivated grain crops. Some evidence is clear — goat toe bones with abrasive 
marks show goats were tied down all the time and not running wild.
A famous Neolithic site in Turkey is Çatalhöyük, a 30-acre settlement of 
mud-brick houses dating as early as 7,000 B.C (see the map in the appendix). 
Though the early levels show no pottery, the indigenous people obviously 
had the technology to make the bricks. The evidence also includes lots of 
figurines of women and images of bulls. What these items had to do with 
ceremony and ritual is unknown; some argue the women were goddesses.

220
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
 
The site of Jericho in Israel was settled by foragers camping near a spring 
as early as 10,500 B.C. Neolithic levels date as early as 7,000 B.C., with rich 
evidence of more complex lifestyles. Finds include trade items from long 
distances, such as salt, tar, and sulfur from the Dead Sea and turquoise, 
shell, obsidian, and greenstone from elsewhere in the region. A stone tower, 
wall, and ditch surrounded the site. This project was a major construction, 
requiring fancy planning and labor organization. Was it all for defense? If 
so, against whom? Some archaeologists think it was fortification against 
flooding and a tower for storage or community gatherings for social or ritual 
reasons. Jericho (famous for its later biblical battle and falling walls) also 
had Neolithic human burials with plastered skulls remodeled to look like 
heads — unusual ritual treatment. Some think it shows ancestor worship.
Africa
In northern Africa the annual flooding of the Nile fertilized the soil, so early 
gardeners planted barley and wheat in this area as long ago as 5,000 to 6,000 
B.C. At about the same time, cattle herding was getting underway in the 
Sahara grasslands. Archaeological evidence and genetic studies suggest that 
distinct species of wheat and cattle were domesticated in Africa.
South Asia
 
Early farming peoples in India and Pakistan developed large villages and 
dense populations pretty quickly. In the Indus River valley, Pakistani and 
French archaeologists have excavated an interesting Neolithic settlement 
named Mehrgarh. Digging in several mounds, they found compartmental 
structures of clay bricks dating to earlier than 6,000 B.C. These constructions 
were probably houses or granaries. In the mud of the bricks were impressions 
of barley and other grains undergoing domestication. Animal bones showed 
a similar picture, a combination of wild gazelle, sheep, cattle, and goats, with 
what appear to be domesticated goats as well.
A cemetery had graves with items of turquoise, shell, carnelian (a red-
orange stone), and lapis lazuli (a bright blue stone), indicators of possible 
social differences. Eleven human molar teeth had holes deliberately drilled, 
probably with the same flint drills that made the fancy stone beads. These 
teeth had the earliest signs of dentistry! Wear marks over the drill holes 
indicated the patients survived and kept chewing. No fillings were pre-
served, but this operation probably wasn’t just for looks.
Later levels excavated at Mehrgarh, dating up to 4,000 B.C., had lots more 
bones of the local humped zebu cattle, now being raised rather than hunted. 
Finds also included more domesticated grains, dates, jujube fruits, and cotton 
seeds (preserved because they were charred). Food production was clearly 
intensifying (and the workload increasing), and pottery, figurines, and more 

221
 Chapter 13: The Last 10,000 Years: Climate Changes and Early Food Production
luxury goods were now being made and increasing the wealth differentiation. 
This site shows the complicated social and economic systems that later 
developed into the Indus civilization (described in Chapter 14).
East Asia
Early cultivators in north China also settled along stream valleys, especially 
the Huang (Yellow) River, where the environment was much wetter than it is 
today. These people, called the Yangshao culture by archaeologists, used the 
following resources:
 
 Domesticated millet, a local a grain (you may be familiar with it as 
birdseed)
 
 Pigs and dogs, as well as some sheep and cattle
 
 Wild plants such as hazel, pine, and chestnuts
 
 Hemp and silkworms for fibers
 
 Many agricultural tools, like polished stone axes
 
 Spindle whorls (cylinders for spinning thread) and bone needles, which 
indicate a lot of textile weaving
 
 White-, red-, and black-painted pottery, including large jars in which they 
buried children
At about the same time in south China, the archaeological evidence shows 
domestication of rice, a more tropical crop. Before 6,500 B.C., rice farmers 
settled in the Yangtze River valley. At least one site has so many rice remains 
that it’s thought to be a threshing floor. Both wild and domesticated varieties 
of this important plant show that it was brought under human control. Other 
early cultivated species were water chestnuts and water buffaloes; people still 
collected wild species like nuts and acorns, deer, elephant, rhino, and turtle. 
Other finds include stone tools and pottery impressed with twisted cords.
The farming of rice and domestication of pigs and cattle soon moved 
eastward toward Japan and southward into southeast Asia. Neolithic sites 
appear in Thailand at almost 4,000 B.C. Southeast Asian Neolithic artifacts 
include polished stone axes and various ceramics; the dead were often 
buried in large fancy clay pots. Though hunting, gathering, and fishing in 
the rich tropical rainforest continued (and continues today), migrating 
people apparently brought rice into southeast Asia’s islands pretty early. 
Rice husks in the clay of pottery have been dated to before 2,000 B.C. in 
Borneo. This shows people were slowly combining gardening and then 
farming with foraging.

222
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
Europe
Excavations in southeastern Europe document how the growing of crops 
and herding of animals moved into the region from the Middle East by 
7,000 B.C. Of course, archaeologists argue about whether the agricultural 
people themselves were moving westward, or just their ideas. Either way, 
the lifeways of local foraging peoples gradually changed. Farming made it to 
northwest Europe by 4,000 B.C. On the Mediterranean, the typical pottery is 
called cardial ware, decorated by impressing into the wet clay the scalloped 
edge of a cardium (cockle) shell. This pottery may indicate a specific ethnic 
group that brought and spread agricultural traditions.
Neolithic discoveries continue. Recently, archaeologists found fragments 
of the oldest known woven cloth, dating to 3,500 B.C., in a burial mound in 
the Czech Republic. Scientific analysis identified this textile as linen. Other 
material items are more controversial. One archaeological reconstruction 
of early Neolithic Europe is that it was a peaceful place full of goddess-
worshipping, matriarchal cultures; this view is based on finds like the many 
figurines of women and symbols like V and M shapes thought to represent 
female bodies. The later appearance of graves of men with metal weapons 
and male symbols may mean that male-dominated warrior cultures from the 
east invaded to end this ideal society. As you can imagine, this scenario is 
much-debated by both men and women archaeologists!
Food Production in North 
and South America
Archaic foragers trekked seasonally between food sources in many places in 
the New World, and some continue to do so. Others would have kept on moving 
around if Europeans hadn’t intruded and made them settle down. (In historic 
time, the horses that Europeans brought even helped make Native Americans 
on the Great Plains better hunters. But soon wild buffalo herds were replaced by 
stockyards.). But some Native Americans developed food production.
Finds of domesticated bottle gourd and squash date as early as 8,000 B.C. in 
both North and South America. Many grain and seed plants followed. Tiny 
cobs of early domesticated corn (maize) in dry caves of central Mexico show 
people were still moving around the landscape when they started cultivating. 
Thousands of years later, sedentism (staying in one place year-round) came 
after gardening in some places. Mound and pyramid construction also began 
as populations got larger and denser, often before farming took hold.

223
 Chapter 13: The Last 10,000 Years: Climate Changes and Early Food Production
Prehistoric North American farmers
Some Late Archaic sites in the U.S. Southeast have the oldest monumental 
architecture, as early as 3,000 to 4,000 B.C. This date is 1,000 years older 
than any Mexican pyramids. Fired clay pottery appeared earlier (by 2,500 
B.C.) in the Southeast as well, but not in Mexico and Central America until 
1,000 to 2,000 years later. But central Mexican foragers were busy domesticating 
maize (corn) and other plants over 7,000 years ago. Over the millennia, maize 
would spread all over the continent to become the staple crop. Figure 13-2 
shows you a typical early domesticated maize cob fragment, less than 2 
centimeters long, preserved because it was charred.
Early gardeners in the eastern U.S.
 
The Poverty Point site in northeastern Louisiana (also discussed in Chapter 
19) is a group of mounds and parallel concentric octagonal earthen ridges 
dating to 1,200 B.C. In the same region is Watson Brake, a site of 11 mounds 
and connecting earthworks dating earlier than 3,000 B.C. These sites are 
important because archaeologists once thought they were the earliest 
evidence of food producers — creating such monuments would have required 
the labor of settled farmers. New dating and analyses show that the ancient 
people at these sites were still foragers, obtaining the rich wild resources 
of the Mississippi Valley. But they were setting the stage for the widespread 
appearance of mound-building cultures all over the eastern U.S., who did 
begin gardening and domesticating local plants centuries later.

Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
The reasons for the earliest constructions of earthen mounds and walls are 
unknown, but some ideas include the possibility that
 
 People came yearly to pile up dirt for some ceremonies, hauling baskets 
or bags of soil.
 
 People just wanted to live on high, dry ground on the floodplain.
Inhabitants of Poverty Point and Watson Brake didn’t even have pottery yet, but 
they made tiny polished stone beads and animal shapes, fancy stone points and 
pendants, and fired-clay balls and other shapes that were probably for cooking.
By 2,000 years ago, finds of charred, preserved plant remains show that 
prehistoric gardeners in the eastern U.S. began domesticating homely little 
weeds like chenopods and amaranths, as well as squash and sunflowers. 
From the Mississippi Valley eastward, they settled in villages and began 
elaborating their earthen mounds for ritual purposes. Some mounds are 
shaped like animals, and others are conical burial mounds; Figure 13-3 shows 
Mississippi’s Bynum Mounds, which date between 100 B.C. and A.D. 100. 
They also built huge earthworks in squares, circles, and other geometric 
shapes. These don’t look like forts but instead probably enclosed some kind 
of ceremonial spaces.
 
Figure 13-3: 
The Bynum 
Mounds in

Mississippi.
 
In early burial mounds, everyone seems to have at least a few grave goods. 
Later mounds show great differences among graves. Some have skeletons, 
others have cremated bone bits, and a few have elaborate wealth items. 

225
 Chapter 13: The Last 10,000 Years: Climate Changes and Early Food Production
Archaeologists are still arguing whether these discrepancies mean hereditary 
chiefs were emerging to run the show (or whether clan mothers were telling 
people what to do).
 
Archaeologists digging the Tremper mound in southwest Ohio found a 
pattern of postmolds in the soil at its base that turned out to be the 
remains of a large 200-x-100-foot wooden building. It was a charnel house, 
with basins for cremating the dead and the burned remains of some 375 
people. The most spectacular deposits in the mound were caches (piles) 
of some 150 stone smoking pipes. Some were of the plain platform style, 
with the bowl on top of a curved or flat platform. But many had the bowls 
carved in the shapes of animals, including squirrels, bobcats, bears, wolves, 
cougars, beavers, otters, turtles, and birds such as herons, cranes, hawks, 
ducks, and owls.
An example of such a pipe appears in Figure 13-4; they’re so realistic that you 
can distinguish different species within one animal type. The pipes and other 
offerings were all smashed before the mound was built over the building. 
It may have been a spiritual practice to free souls in death or consecrate a 
sacred place. Destroyed artifact offerings are common in burial mounds for a 
couple of thousand years.

226
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
Tremper is one of hundreds of mounds of the Hopewell culture (named after 
one of the first such mounds excavated). And Hopewell is one of many local 
cultures within the Woodland period (see the time chart in the appendix) 
who built burial mounds of all sizes along river valleys in the eastern U.S. 
between about 200 B.C. and A.D. 600. Finds of fancy log tombs and elaborate 
offerings in the mounds show the rise of some kind of social and political 
leaders or special individuals. They also show that mound-builders had vast 
trade networks and exquisite craftwork.
Here are some examples of other artifact offerings in the thousands of 
Woodland mounds:
 
 Elaborate pottery with incised, stamped, and sometimes painted 
decoration; stone and clay figurines of people and animals
 
 Beads and cubes of galena, a shiny lead ore from Canada
 
 Hammered ornaments of copper from northern Michigan
 
 Other ornaments hammered from raw silver and meteoric iron
 
 Whole whelk shells from the Gulf Coast
 
 Piles of thousands of shell beads from jewelry or clothing
 
 Sharks’ teeth from the coasts
 
 Cutout abstract and realistic shapes of shiny mica from the Appalachian 
Mountains
 
 Celts (axes and adzes) of polished greenstone from the Appalachians
 
 A few fancy points of chipped obsidian from the Rocky Mountains and 
other stone tools of multicolored Flint Ridge flint and other pretty stones
 
 Piles of large chipped stone blades too thin to use for tools
 
 Additional human skulls in graves, interpreted as either remains of 
honored ancestors or trophies from defeated enemies
 
 Cut animal jaws and teeth (from bears and wolves), perhaps to wear as 
costumes or symbols in rituals
You can imagine how excited archaeologists are to excavate such exotic 
burial offerings, especially because most of the mounds are now protected 
and specifically not available for digging.
Eastern U.S. farmers
The Woodland moundbuilders occasionally grew a little maize in their gardens. 
By around A.D. 1000, they’d recognized the amazing productivity of this grass. 
They became intensive farmers and transformed their society.
Maize agriculturalists were organized into complex societies, chiefdoms, of the 
Mississippian period (see the time chart in the appendix). They farmed, still 
hunted, and maybe domesticated turkeys. Each regional culture had different 

227
 Chapter 13: The Last 10,000 Years: Climate Changes and Early Food Production
artifact styles, especially well-made pottery (see Color Figure 3). They still 
buried their important dead with pomp and ceremony (and riches) in burial 
mounds and cemeteries. They also built platform mounds, flat-topped pyramids 
with large temples or chiefs’ houses on top. There were plazas for civic 
activities, and beyond that stood the large villages and surrounding fields.
Of course, archaeologists argue about how powerful the chiefs were, their 
competition and warfare, and whether they inherited their positions.
The largest Mississippian center is at Cahokia in East St. Louis, with over 
100 temple mounds (see Chapter 19 for more details on this site). A walled 
compound surrounded Monk’s mound, the largest (at 300 x 700 feet and 
100 feet high). Circles of wooden posts left features named woodhenges that 
may have been for astronomical observations. In Mound 72 were successive 
burials of important individuals with lots of fancy, probably sacred offerings. 
Examples of these offerings include
 
 Caches of stone points and decorative pottery
 
 Hammered copper pieces
 
 Thousands of shell beads
 
 Shiny mica stone
 
 Piles of human skeletons (some mutilated) suggesting sacrificial victims, 
servants, or retainers of the important dead
 
Though Cahokia was apparently abandoned by A.D. 1300, other regional 
temple mound centers thrived at different times along the major river valleys. 
They may all have represented chiefdoms that cycled in and out of power. The 
intensification in production of maize, beans, and squash (the big three Native 
American crops) gave these centers a foundation for complex society.
Southwestern U.S. forager–farmers
By 3,500 years ago, foragers in the Southwest were growing maize as a staple 
crop, with squash and (later) beans, as well as domesticating turkeys. Some 
groups were only part-time farmers, and others developed sedentary villages.
Here are a few of the spectacular local cultures archaeologists have named:
 
 Hohokam: This culture developed large villages with platform mounds 
and irrigation systems to farm in the desert at sites like Snaketown in 
southern Arizona.
 
 Anasazi or Ancestral Pueblo: Anasazi (Navajo for “ancient stranger”) sites 
such as at Chaco Canyon and Mesa Verde (see Color Figure 8) in the Four 
Corners region have large multi-roomed masonry dwellings (pueblos), and 
great road networks. (See Chapter 19 for more on these sites.) Later, the 
Anasazi shifted to more defensible cliff dwellings. (Check out Chapter 18 
for details on the latest controversy concerning these ancient people.)

228
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
 
 Mogollon: These natives of the southern New Mexico and northern 
Mexico highlands were known for beautiful black and white-painted 
Mimbres pottery.
All these more complex farming cultures enjoyed several centuries of wetter 
climates and growing populations, but by around A.D. 1350 they disappeared, 
moved, or transformed into simpler societies. The reasons may be severe 
climate change, depletion of their environments, social and political factors 
like competition and conflict, or some combination thereof.
Mesoamerican farmers
Mesoamerica includes most of Mexico and Central America. Long before 5,000 
B.C., squash, corn, chili peppers, cotton, and other plants were cultivated in 
central and Gulf Coastal Mexico by wandering Late Archaic foragers. The crops 
spread slowly but widely, and people eventually settled down permanently to 
become intensive farmers.
By as early as 2,000 B.C., the archaeological remains show complex societies 
with large villages, socially differentiated houses, shrines, fancy craftwork, 
and evidence of long-distance trade such as seashells far inland and jade and 
other stone far from quarries. For lack of a better term, archaeologists often 
call these societies chiefdoms (and continue arguing about whether they 
had permanent hereditary leaders, freedom or coercion, and other social 
aspects). By 1,000 B.C., these indigenous peoples were building earthen and 
stone pyramids as platforms for ceremonial buildings along the coast of the 
Gulf of Mexico. They were setting the stage for the development of true 
civilization with Olmec culture (described in Chapter 14).
Early South American farmers
South America’s environmental extremes often result in extreme biases in the 
archaeological record because of what is and isn’t preserved. Here are some 
examples:
 
 The desert Pacific coast is so dry that organic remains such as cloth, 
feathers, wood, and sometimes human mummies are preserved.
 
 The high mountains of the Andes featured plenty of rock for construction, 
so lots of structures are preserved.
 
 In the Amazon jungle and other low, wet environments, preservation of 
organic remains is seldom possible. It’s also harder to see earthen and 
other monuments through the trees.
Fishing on the desert coast
Despite the desert on land, the Pacific Ocean is enormously rich in fish, 
especially tiny anchovies easily netted in huge quantities. Along with 

229
 Chapter 13: The Last 10,000 Years: Climate Changes and Early Food Production
marine birds and other resources, this abundance permitted people to 
settle in large permanent villages without any agriculture and build major 
ceremonial centers on or near the west coast of South America.
 
El Paraíso, a site near Lima, Peru, boasts nine building complexes with rooms, 
courts, and corridors. Walls were made of cut, plastered stone painted in 
bright colors. The central complex has long parallel pyramids arranged in 
a U-shape with the arms surrounding a plaza. At 1800 B.C., it’s the largest 
early masonry monument in the Western Hemisphere. Finds include grinding 
stones, wooden tools, lots of seafood remains, and net fragments, plus cotton, 
wool, needles, and feathers, all of which were probably for making woven 
textiles. Caral, another site 14 miles up the Supe River from the coast, has 
25 platform mounds over 150 acres and dates to as early as 2,500 B.C. Finds 
include bird-bone flutes and preserved reed bags used to carry the stones to 
build the pyramids.
Many short rivers flow west from the Andes across the desert to the sea. Early 
gardeners used their valleys to cultivate industrial crops like cotton (for nets) 
and gourds (for bowls). They even dug irrigation canals and grew food crops 
like peppers and squash inland. Coastal people apparently traded for these 
plants and sent dried fish and shellfish up the rivers, so the people at Caral and 
other major centers inland got their protein from seafood. Later, maize, manioc 
(also known as cassava, a root crop made into bread and beer), and other 
foods were grown, but people still fished for those anchovies.
Herding in the mountains, gardening in the jungle
Sites of early farmers in the Andes are harder to distinguish because less is 
preserved. But some stone shrines and other monuments began to be built a 
little later here than on the coast. And highland hunters of animals like llamas 
and alpacas were transforming into herders and traders moving up and down 
the mountains according to the season.
 
Archaeologists once believed that complex society in the Amazon rainforest 
developed late and only through influence from other cultures to the west. 
After all, who wants to work hard farming and building monuments in the 
hot, steamy tropics? Plus, far less of the archaeological record is preserved 
there, and it’s harder to do archaeology because, well, it’s a jungle out there! 
However, recent finds in Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia show native people had early 
complex society and manipulated wetlands for crop production.
 
In these countries, some intrepid archaeologists have uncovered remains 
of well-developed farming cultures perhaps 2,000 years old that depended 
on manioc, maize, cacao (chocolate), and other cultivated plants. Densely 
populated early chiefdoms built elaborate systems of earthworks, causeways, 
and canals in the jungle. They dug ditches and piled the muck in raised areas 
that still have rich, black, fertile soil today. Their artifacts include beautiful 
painted pottery and other crafts. Scientists have only been able to find such 
sites with the aid of aerial photography and other tools of remote sensing 
(which I discuss in Chapter 6).

230
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
South Americans also traded widely in jungle products and ideas. Westward 
in the Andes and on the Pacific coast, you can find remains of rainforest coca 
leaves (chewed for the drug that relieves high-altitude stress) and images of 
jungle monkeys and lizards that may have had a spiritual importance.
Later Prehistory: Metal and Megaliths
Later Neolithic farming people were more settled in more densely populated 
towns and villages. They stayed in one place longer and so could accumulate 
more stuff (great for the archaeologist). They practiced deliberate burial of 
the dead, which provides more social and economic information like wealth 
and health differences too. They certainly were not egalitarian anymore but 
rather had rich and poor, oppressed and exalted.
When archaeologists began to use their finds to tell the story of the human 
past, they had to break it into manageable time periods. It’s interesting (and 
very telling) that they picked technological criteria to divide up the human 
past. So the earliest tools (that we’ve recovered, anyway) are of stone, then 
humanity advances (supposedly) to metals. You could say the Western world 
is obsessed with technology, but you have to go with what you have — the 
hard materials of the artifacts that were preserved. So after the long, long 
Stone Age came the various ages of metals (Copper, Bronze, and Iron Ages) 
because the cool new artifacts left at archaeological sites were made of metal.
The beginnings of metalworking
The earliest metalworking was cold-hammering raw materials, during 
Neolithic times. Craftworkers heated raw copper (when they could find it) or 
even soft gold over the fire and pounded it into the shape they wanted. They 
could even rivet sections together or emboss pictures on it.
These specialists (probably pottery-makers already using kilns) figured out 
how to get hotter fires (usually by using bellows to increase oxygen flow into 
the furnace); with this technique, they could then extract metals from ores 
and develop metallurgy. They also discovered how to make alloys, or mixtures 
of metals. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin (or rarely another metal). Iron 
came later because it needs an even hotter fire to produce.
Metals could be sharper and last longer than stone (for better plows and 
weapons). But they were produced many different ways in many different 
times in different areas of the world. So the terms Copper Age (or Chalcolithic), 
Bronze Age, and Iron Age are used most often to refer to Europe, Africa, and 
the Middle East. In some regions this is the time between developing intensive 
food production and developing true states. In other regions metals were 
developed within the first real state systems.

Metal becomes the next big thing
Because they’re soft and easy to work with, copper and gold were the first 
metal artifacts to appear in most of the world. Usually they’re just added into 
the regular Neolithic-type artifact inventory. At first, they were fancy wealth 
items because of their rarity, but later copper artifacts became so common 
that they were just everyday tools (much like computers today or, for a 
certain generation, televisions). Gold was always special because it was rarer 
and never tarnished or decayed.
 
One of my favorite Copper Age sites is Varna, on the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria. 
It dates to 4,500 B.C. and had some 190 graves. With the burials were red ochre 
(pigment) and artifacts of chipped flint and obsidian, clay human masks, shell 
beads, copper needles, marble cups, and fancy pottery decorated with graphite 
and gold. A major find was 14 pounds of golden items, including masks, axes, 
bull figures, bangle bracelets, and beads. A cylindrical container lying between 
the legs of an adult male skeleton could only have been a gold penis sheath!
The health and wealth of food producers
Early farming cultures that depended upon 
starchy grains or root crops may have had more 
stable food sources. But they also often had 
more health problems. Starch on people’s teeth 
turned to sugar, which meant decay and cavities. 
A diet full of carbohydrates but little protein 
means more risk of infection, the evidence of 
which is visible in the ancient bones.
Having to go get food wild meant unpredictability 
but lots of fresh air and exercise. Foragers may go 
through a time when they can’t find anything, and 
their skeletons do sometimes show acute (one-
time) stress. But farmers with more dependable 
but monotonous diets often had skeletons with 
chronic (continuing) stress from protein or other 
shortages. Their bones may also show new 
problems. For example, at the Neolithic site of 
Abu Hurerya in Syria, some skeletons showed 
stress on the neck bones from carrying heavy 
loads on people’s heads. Skeletons of women 
had well developed muscle marks on the upper 
arms, arthritis in the knees and lower back, and 
marks or even degeneration on the toes typical 
of constantly tucking toes under when kneeling. 
These clues show women knelt to grind grain 
on stone querns (hand mills), throwing the body 
weight into the grinding. The constant repetitive 
action left telltale indications on their bones.
You may think that producing their own food 
would give people more leisure time to develop 
other areas of culture — or just loaf around. But 
in reality, it takes more time to grow food than to 
gather it wild. So where did farming cultures get 
the time to build those monuments and develop 
those beautiful crafts and art?
The key is specialization and social differentiation. 
As soon as some people became more important, 
they didn’t have to produce their own food. Craft 
specialists, political leaders (like chiefs), and 
religious specialists (like priests — sometimes 
the same as the political or economic leaders) 
could get others to produce their food and other 
necessities so they could devote their time to 
their specialized pursuits. So food production 
ends up meaning more work for the masses and 
time to engage (indulge?) in creativity for just a 
few of the special folks.

Another famous Copper Age European is Ötzi, the Iceman. He’s the famous 
5,300-year-old frozen Italian guy who melted out of a glacier in 1992. He had a 
copper ax and other fascinating artifacts (described in Chapter 18).
The rise of megaliths
A great structure built with huge stones is a megalithic monument; in fact, the 
word megalith is from the Greek words for “huge” and “stone.” Hundreds of 
thousands of monuments made of giant boulders occur in cultures around 
the world at different times. Most of them date to the Neolithic or later, when 
people were more settled and could organize the labor to build them (and 
grow enough food to feed all those laborers). You probably know about 
Stonehenge (shown in Figure 13-5) and Avebury in England, Newgrange in 
Ireland, or Carnac in France. They’re famous among the thousands of 
megalithic structures all over Western Europe.
The following list gives you some of the kinds of megalithic structures:
 
 Tombs that may have once been (or still are) covered with sod or earth 
and used by the community or specific kin groups. Newgrange is a huge 
passage tomb with inner chambers reached by a long passage or hallway.
 
 Stone circles with earthen banks and ditches (henges) that served 
ceremonial purposes — perhaps for predicting or demonstrating the 
orientation of the stars and planets, or ritual healing. Stonehenge and 
Avebury are great examples; they even have ancient roads or cause-
ways running long distances and linking them to the nearby rivers.

 Chapter 13: The Last 10,000 Years: Climate Changes and Early Food Production
 
 Individual standing stones that may have marked sacred places. The 
stones may stand alone or in different arrangements (and sometimes on 
top of each other); Carnac is a mile of rows of standing stones.
Other archaeological evidence associated with the megaliths includes
 
 Carved designs on the rocks — often geometric circles or spirals.
 
 Surrounding ditches or other nearby mounds or earthworks.
 
 Fire pits or sacrificial deposits of pots and animal bone. These finds may 
be evidence of ceremonies and feasts carried out at such shrines.
 
 Houses or domestic middens (garbage piles) that indicate people lived nearby.
Megalithic monuments in Europe date to between 4,000 and 2,000 B.C. Some 
of them may have been built even in the late Mesolithic, but most date to 
the Neolithic, when people had begun food production, and later, into the 
Copper and Bronze Ages. The many different styles were built by many very 
different cultures, probably for quite different reasons.
 
An unusual example is the megalithic structures on the island of Malta, in the 
Mediterranean (see Color Figure 9 and discussion in Chapter 20). These tombs 
and monumental buildings began to be constructed during the Neolithic 
and lasted through the Bronze Age. They’re associated with images of hefty 
women in both huge stone sculptures and tiny figurines (see Figure 13-6). Of 
course, archaeologists argue whether these are fertility goddess figures or 
something else. (Queens? Clan mothers? Rock stars?)
 
Figure 13-6:

lady” statue

Malta.
 
So how did they move those big rocks from quarries many miles away to 
build megalithic monuments? You may think this transportation was beyond 
ancient technology, but experimental archaeology projects have shown 

234
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
various techniques that work, such as using log rollers, sledges, levers, coun-
terweights, tough fiber ropes, and a whole lot of human muscles.
 
The real mystery of the megaliths isn’t how societies built them but how they got 
people to build them. A few genius ancient engineers had to come up with the tech-
niques, but then someone had to persuade people to sweat. What was the incentive? 
Archaeologists continue to argue about this, but suggestions include religious motiva-
tion or even promise of future gain in this world.
The origins of inequality
Most societies that learned to produce their 
own food, use metals, and build megalithic 
monuments remained organized as villages, 
towns, and chiefdoms for hundreds or thou-
sands of years. Social and eventually economic 
inequalities developed; in other words, a few 
people went from being socially more impor-
tant and respected to being economically more 
important too — richer and more powerful. 
Some Neolithic-level societies even eventually 
had slaves!
If you start out with a society in which everybody 
does his or her own chores, each family gets its 
own food, and everyone is treated equally, how 
do you get to a society with specialists, with 
inequality, with haves and have-nots?
Archaeologists ponder this question all the 
time, and the evidence is elusive. Some of the 
proposed ideas are as follows:
  People who excelled at certain tasks, 
perhaps hunting or religious ceremony, 
gained prestige and became leaders.
  Certain folks who could do particular jobs 
better than the rest became specialists (craft-
workers, priests, engineers, organizers);
they then didn’t produce their own food but 
were supported by the rest of the population 
in return for their specialized products or 
skills.
  Individuals who were naturally self-
aggrandizing (prone to promoting them-
selves) tried to get honors and extra 
supplies for themselves, and doled them 
out to followers who would support them. 
(Were these the first politicians?)
  However they attained power, these leaders 
originally achieved their status; how-
ever, their positions eventually became 
ascribed or inherited, and so hereditary 
rulers emerged.
  As more people tried to become leaders, 
and social positions became hereditary, 
real economic wealth began to go along 
with them. This setup is called stratified 
society.
The archaeological evidence can be inconclu-
sive; does a burial with extraordinary wealth 
show a religious leader, a political leader, a rich 
merchant, the best athlete, the best storyteller, 
the family patriarch or matriarch, or just some-
one with inherited wealth who never accom-
plished anything ? Whatever the case, after 
millions of years of egalitarian life, humanity 
developed inequality.

I
n Chapter 12, I describe what archaeology has found out about our distant 
human ancestors of the Paleolithic, who foraged for food and resources 
for a couple of million years. In Chapter 13 you see the archaeological evi-
dence for how people responded to the first global warming around 10,000 
years ago. Some began producing their own food, changing society forever.
This chapter picks up the story later in prehistoric time. One of the biggest 
questions is “What led to the emergence of real civilizations?” Why did this 
most complex form of society ever seen begin to develop? In this chapter, 
I show you some of what archaeology has learned about the very first true 
states, and also some later ancient civilizations. It’s more than written history 
can ever tell us — especially in some places, where writing was never used.
What Archaeologists Mean 
by Civilization
You may think that any past human culture is an ancient civilization. Or you 
may be hiking through the wilderness and think you’ve reached civilization 
when you get to a shower and a flush toilet. Or perhaps you consider civiliza-
tion to mean proper behavior or elaborate arts. However, none of these is 
what archaeologists mean by civilization.
Anthropological archaeology reserves this term for the most complex societ-
ies that ever developed — true states. The independent development of the 
first states happened in only six places (as far as known today), beginning 
around 5,000 years ago. Many later states followed those first ones, some-
times right on top of them and sometimes far away.

236
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
Usually civilization is defined to include the following criteria, first noted long 
ago by famous archaeologist V. Gordon Childe (see Chapter 1):
 
 True cities with central government buildings, houses, public spaces, 
marketplaces, large living areas, and complex organization
 
 Rural agricultural space outside the cities
 
 Large, dense populations
 
 A formal, complex, and usually centralized government
 
 Full-time labor specialists in construction, arts, and crafts, as well as reli-
gious specialists (priests) — all fed and supported by the masses of food 
producers
 
 State bureaucracy and social organization that goes beyond family and 
kinship systems
 
 Real economic inequality, with social classes, gaps between rich and 
poor, and even slavery
 
 Economic surpluses — not only of food staples but also of wealth 
items — usually in the hands of the few elites and rulers
 
 Monumental public works like pyramids, palaces, plazas, reservoirs, and 
irrigation systems
 
 Extensive, long-distance economic trade and other exchange
 
 Engineering and mathematical systems
 
 Writing or record-keeping systems
 
 Organized state religions, often also under political control
 
 A standing military organization to defend all this
 
 Taxes or tribute to support all this
Some debate whether you need every one of these criteria to have a state. 
And many of these required characteristics are present in earlier, non-state 
societies too. But the coming together of so many of them is what makes this 
totally new form of society emerge.
 
Don’t confuse the appearance of food production and settled society in the 
Neolithic (which I describe in Chapter 13) with the earliest state formation, 
which happened thousands of years later. Neolithic societies may have had 
big monuments or craft specialists or social and economic classes. They may 
even have conducted some organized warfare (probably not often). But they 
didn’t have cities, or writing, or millions of government rules to obey and 
forms to fill out!

237
 Chapter 14: Ancient States
What Archaeology Brings to the 
Study of Ancient Civilization
The roots of all civilizations are in prehistoric times, when only archaeology 
can investigate them. Even later, when some of the earliest states developed 
writing, they usually wrote few texts, and most (especially on perishable fab-
rics) didn’t survive over the millennia. Some early writing systems haven’t yet 
been deciphered, and South American civilizations never did develop writing at 
all. So archaeology is the best way to explore ancient civilizations completely.
The most celebrated kinds of archaeology deal with fabulous ancient 
kingdoms and empires, and their art, monuments, and gold. These are the 
material evidence of past human greatness. Archaeologists continued to 
emphasize pyramids and  palaces into the 20th century; however, they 
increasingly realize the importance of looking at what was going on down 
the city streets and out in the countryside. This way, you can reconstruct 
the workings of early states and get a fuller picture of how they developed.
The search for historic records
Most historic records of ancient states are lost. Even for Western civilization, 
most of the writing of antiquity was long gone a few centuries later — they 
don’t call them the Dark Ages for nothing! Records from early civilizations 
that did get preserved tend to present some problems:
 
 Only a few actually exist.
 
 They’re always biased. (For more on this, see the discussion of historic 
archaeology in Chapters 3 and 15.) They were written by the elites, so 
they say only what was important to rulers and upper classes.
 
 They don’t even deal with much of the huge wealth of cultural behavior 
of those elites, such as what they did every day.
 
 They don’t say anything about the lives of common people or how mon-
uments were built, taxes collected, or crafts produced.
 
 The few records that have survived and been passed down (works from 
Greece and Rome, the Bible) were repeatedly copied (by hand until the 
printing press was invented in the 15th century). You can imagine how 
mistakes (or even someone’s idea of jazzing up the story) crept in.
Texts can give a few clues, but archaeology is the key to understanding what was 
happening (and sometimes to digging up new texts). Archaeology brings these 
ancient people and their activities back to life. Its unique method means that you 
find the material evidence — from architecture to garbage dumps, from wealthy 
graves to the most humble, everyday artifact — to explain how people lived and 
how their social, political, economic, and even religious systems worked.

238
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
The problem of looting
Because of looting, very few tombs of ancient rulers or glorious prehistoric 
palaces anywhere are undisturbed. Most museum collections of ancient 
treasures were bought or otherwise obtained from looters. As I show you in 
Chapter 1, early archaeology itself centered around digging into monuments 
and bringing home treasures to exhibit.
Even today, you still see looting of all the ancient civilizations; head to Chapter 
2 for a discussion of looting and the illegal antiquities trade. Sometimes it’s sub-
sistence looting — a poor farmer selling off a pot unearthed while plowing, for 
a few bucks to feed the family. But buyers and dealers then make lots of money 
smuggling and selling these items in international markets and art auctions. 
The artifacts’ origins can often be concealed with the right faked paperwork. So 
archaeologists try to educate everyone about conserving the cultural heritage. 
Meanwhile they must interpret the past with much of the record missing.
Excavating the Earliest True States
The earliest states emerged independently in six places in the world: four in 
the Old World — Egypt, Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and China— and two 
in the New World — South America and Mesoamerica (Mexico and Central 
America). These six are sometimes called pristine states because each devel-
oped independently (though clear artifact evidence shows they communi-
cated with each other within the Old and New Worlds).
In this section, I describe these early states and their famous archaeological 
evidence. The map and timeline in the appendix show you where they were 
located and when.
Mesopotamia (Iraq): 
Sumerian civilization
You probably learned in high-school history class about Mesopotamia, the 
“land between two rivers” (the Tigris and Euphrates) where the earliest states 
evolved. It’s a desert, but near the rivers you have rich cropland, especially if 
you construct irrigation canals. Neolithic people had already started building 
large villages with religious centers. Excavations show dense settlements of 
rectangular houses and larger buildings of mud bricks, one built on top of the 
ruins of the next, until they all formed large mounds of mud and clay called 
tells. The thousands of tells across the southwest Asian landscape contain 
thousands of years of the garbage of everyday life. Archaeologists also find 
hundreds of miles of irrigation canals dug by the ancients to expand their crop 
yields to feed more and more people.

239
 Chapter 14: Ancient States
The ruins of larger, differently-shaped buildings may be non-residential 
structures — probably temples, because some have internal elements that 
look like altars and places for burnt offerings. As these temple buildings became 
larger and fancier through time, archaeologists hypothesize that religious 
leaders came to dominate politics and economic systems too, directing 
construction of even more monuments and irrigation systems. In this way 
real cities emerged and hierarchical leadership became entrenched.
First cities
The first city, Uruk, dates to around 3,500 B.C. Remains of its temple (built over 
ruins of earlier temples) sat on the ziggurat, or stepped pyramid, 40 feet above 
the ground. The elaborate architecture of whitewashed mud bricks  shows 
leaders must have commanded a great labor force to build it. Its high walls 
suggest that temple elites (rulers, priests) separated themselves from the rest 
of the people. The largest, wealthiest houses sat closest to the temple. Other 
sections of the city had evidence of other types of people who wouldn’t have 
produced their own food, but were supported by peasant farmers — the craft 
specialists. Finds at workshops for potters, coppersmiths, and carpenters 
include finished products and the debris from manufacture. These specialists 
developed the potter’s wheel and made artifacts of fancy stone, shell, ivory, 
copper, and other raw materials obtained from great distances.
After Uruk, other major centers, such as Eridu and Ur, evolved into city-
states, controlling large territories. This was Sumerian civilization, in which 
immensely powerful ruling dynasties were established. Several of these 
famous sites were excavated in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and con-
tinue to be studied (as the political situation in Iraq permits).
The temple at Eridu had 15 to 20 superimposed layers, each bigger and 
representing more elaborate construction, over 3,000 years (imagine 
excavating that!). British and American archaeologists of the 1920s dug up 
nearly 2,000 graves at Ur. Most were simple commoners’ burials, with the 
bodies wrapped in mats or put into wood or clay coffins and accompanied 
by humble offerings. But royal tombs had elaborate stone or brick chambers 
and 16 graves with exquisite artifacts of gold, lapis lazuli (a blue gemstone), 
and other precious materials, like the famous bull-headed lyre, one of the 
world’s oldest musical instruments. Other elite grave goods included rich 
clothing, games, jewelry, chariots, oxen, and even sacrificed people (servants, 
guards, and soldiers to work in the next world). You can easily see hierarchical 
society in grave archaeology in Mesopotamia.
The city-states show an archaeological settlement pattern of urban expansion 
through time — residential neighborhoods dating to later periods were 
farther from the center, and homes in the countryside were abandoned. From 
digs at both elite and commoners’ houses, finds of bones and seeds indicate 
people were raising cattle, wheat, barley, and flax (for linen) and also fishing 
in the rivers and obtaining many other food resources. The wheel and the 
plow appeared by around 3,000 B.C., and metal artifacts became common.

240
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
Early writing
 
Steps hypothesized in the development of Mesopotamian writing are very 
interesting. Originally economic goods were accompanied by clay tokens that 
probably served as a packing list. These then gave way to records made by 
impressing symbols onto wet clay tablets. Finally the impressions transformed 
into the stylized, standardized written language called cuneiform, made with a 
pointed tool on the clay tablets (shown in Figure 14-1).
After rulers and governments had writing, they had the power to control 
knowledge. Many cuneiform tablets have been excavated, and many wait to 
be translated. But some have already told details of how much wheat, barley, 
bread, sheep, and cattle people had — and how much beer they were making!
What did they write when they started writing?
Writing systems developed in different parts 
of the world, and were used for different 
purposes. Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets 
(around 3,000 B.C.) were originally for 
accounting — lists of animals, grain, land 
records (think of the Internal Revenue Service). 
But when the value of written language became 
more widely known, people started writing 
poetry, stories, proverbs, letters, and even love 
songs!
Egyptians used hieroglyphic (picture) writing on 
tombs and temples for formal inscriptions like 
announcing who was ruling at the time. Hieratic 
script, a cursive writing that was faster to do 
than the elaborate pictures of the hieroglyphs, 
was for everyday stuff but also sacred ideas. 
Papyrus texts (the earliest paper artifacts — 
preserved in dry desert conditions) record 
everything from medical treatises to magical 
wisdom. Graffiti was also carved into stone 
buildings.
The earliest Chinese pictographs, written on 
oracle bones, were for divination — foretelling 
auspicious days and events and then describing 
those events (so, basically, fortune-telling). 
They evolved into the ideogram script (symbols 
for ideas, as opposed to an alphabet) used often 
for recording ceremonial rituals and sacred 
ideas.
The symbols of the Indus script (and many 
other ancient written languages) have yet to 
be understood. Ancient glyph systems from 
different Mesoamerican cultures remain mostly 
undeciphered, except for Maya writing. Its 
recently decoded glyphs represent words and 
syllables and record political history, lists of 
kings, conquests, and sacred stories.
Those who knew how to write (scribes) were 
important people. South American states had 
no writing but used the quipu (or khipu) system 
of knotted cords to record things. The Inca 
scribes who knew how to interpret the quipu 
were all killed off during the European invasion 
before anyone could write down how the 
system worked, so archaeologists and others 
are still trying to figure it out.

241
 Chapter 14: Ancient States
Technology, economics, and empire
 
Other Mesopotamian city-states appeared later and competed with one 
another. Metallurgy and bronze weapons (discussed in Chapter 13) gave a 
competitive advantage in combat, suggesting the early appearance of warfare, 
which archaeologists are still arguing about! But great defensive walls testify 
to the empire-building and the rise and fall of different centers over the next 
millennia. Native patterns of conflict in the region that seem to continue in 
descendant cultures today may have been established thousands of years ago.
Mesopotamian states were linked by economics (if not conquests). To get 
raw materials they needed but didn’t have (like metals and precious stones), 
trade extended long distances. They went along those two rivers to northern 
Iraq and overland with the caravans to the Levant (eastern Mediterranean) 
and Iran. The artifact evidence shows interaction as far east as the Indus 
valley (Pakistan) and as far west as Egypt (see map in the appendix). That’s a 
long way to go on a camel!
I’ve spent a little more time on Sumerian civilization, not only because it was 
the first but also because it expanded into empires. Consolidated city-states 
extended rule over farther territories to control those raw materials sources. 
Beginning around 2,500 B.C., the succession of kingdoms and dynasties such 
as at Ur, Babylon, and other archaeological sites of early history had begun.

Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
Egypt: Pyramids and pharaohs
The Nile runs north to the Mediterranean and provides good cropland by 
flooding every year and leaving fertile soil on its banks. In Neolithic times, 
the surrounding area was wetter, but as it dried up people moved to large 
settlements on the big river. Excavations of farming villages have uncovered 
the foundations of mud-brick houses with thatched roofs, and remains of 
wheat, sheep, and goats (which would have come in from Mesopotamia) 
as well as cattle and other native African foods. Mummification of the dead 
slowly developed (wrapping corpses in resin-soaked linen), and the settle-
ments become denser and more complex through time. Archaeologists inter-
pret these changes as a transformation from chiefdoms into small kingdoms 
and, by 3,100 B.C., a consolidated civilization that lasted over 2,500 years.
Early Egyptian cities had wealthy homes and craft workshops where specialists 
made pottery, stone tablets, alabaster jars, copper pins, axes, and daggers, plus 
fancy jewelry and decorative items of gold, silver, ebony, ivory, and precious 
stones. The dry climate preserves normally perishable finds like wood, basketry, 
cloth, rope, feathers, and papyrus paper.
You can see through grave archaeology the evolution of hierarchy: The 
earliest tombs were small, wooden enclosures where the dead were buried 
with everyday items and food for the afterlife. By the fourth millennium 
B.C., a few tombs are more elaborate stone or brick constructions with 
fancy grave furniture, mummies of animals, and other wealth items 
showing how the new ruling class lived. Eventually, large cemetery-temple 
complexes with pyramids became funerary monuments to individual 
rulers, demonstrating not only their riches but also the power of the state. 
Portraits, animal images, and civic and religious symbols were carved into 
walls and statues.
In Chapter 2, I describe the common misconceptions about pyramids 
and prophesies in ancient Egypt (not to mention Hollywood’s notion of 
extragalactic connections). But since Sir William Flinders Petrie developed 
careful digging methods in Egyptology in the late 19th century, systematic, 
scientific archaeology has been uncovering the real stories.
Consolidating power
The Egyptian state was much larger, more centralized, and more stable 
than Mesopotamian city-states. This may have been due to the concentration 
of people in the fertile valley (you couldn’t do much in the desert) and so 
the concentration of wealth for the rulers. Written records on papyrus 
and carved stone monuments say that the first pharaoh unified the Upper 
(southern Nile) and Lower (northern Nile) segments of Egypt, and various 
dynasties followed, established through political alliances, warfare, and 
governing strategies. For example, pharaohs were god-kings, marrying their 

243
 Chapter 14: Ancient States
sisters to keep the power in the family! Excavations of their pyramids, huge 
tombs and palaces, and irrigation canals indicate that they had good engineers 
and lots of labor to carry millions of limestone blocks. Other archaeological 
sites such as outlying shrines and government outposts show how they 
established a complex, efficient bureaucracy to run everything.
 
Most of the rich tombs of Egyptian rulers were looted ages ago (some probably 
before the corpse was cold). The boy-king Tut ruled only ten years (beginning 
1333 B.C.) and was not very important as pharaohs go. But he’s famous now 
because his tomb was discovered mostly undisturbed. It contained amazing 
wealth: his solid gold coffin; his gold funerary mask inlaid with lapis, quartz, 
obsidian, turquoise, carnelian, and colored glass; statues of carved wood, gold, 
marble, and other stone; a big fan with ostrich plumes; and even clay jars with 
residues of both red and white wine. You can imagine what opulent offerings 
must have accompanied the divine personages of other, more important rulers.
In Egyptian archaeology today, you also excavate more humble graves and 
homes of scribes or common people. One investigation of the settlements of 
workers who built pyramids showed that these laborers were treated well. 
Numerous bones of cattle, sheep, and goats show that they got good quality 
meat every day —unlike the Hollywood image of slaves beaten while they

In ancient Egypt you see the influence of Mesopotamia in the written records 
and artifacts, but archaeology also shows you the independent development 
of native complex culture, with its own styles of art and crafts, architecture, 
religion, and political administration. Egypt had extensive trade networks 
to get valuable raw materials. The capital cities moved up and down the 
Nile depending on the ruler and who was overtaking whom. Farther upriver, 
archaeologists have investigated sites of the indigenous sub-Saharan African 
civilizations that emerged in Nubia (Sudan) by 1500 B.C., with their own 
pyramids and black-skinned people. Nubians were certainly in constant 
interaction with Egypt, but a few historians argue they were the originators 
of Egyptian civilization (and even later, of classical Greece). Archaeologists 
can’t, of course, tell skin color from artifacts or even mummies, but Egyptian 
paintings do show Nubians with darker skin than the Egyptians themselves, 
who are usually anywhere from reddish-brown to paler yellowish-white.
By 1000 B.C. the centralization of Egypt was breaking down as regional leaders 
competed for power. You’ve probably read the history — Assyrians, Persians, 
and then Macedonians (led by Alexander the Great) later invaded to end 
Egypt’s home glory. All these conflicts are visible in the archaeological record 
too, in everything from new artifact styles to changing religious symbols and 
settlement patterns.

Indus Valley: Peaceful civilization?
You may not have heard about the civilization that appeared in the Indus 
River valley. It was only discovered in the 1920s, and the British had 
already demolished some of the sites in the 19th century, using the ancient 
bricks to build their railroad lines! Because today the river forms the 
border between India and Pakistan, political difficulties (as well as looters 
and modern construction) continue to hinder comprehensive investigations. 
But intrepid archaeologists from these two countries, as well as other 
international teams, are now bringing many finds to public attention.
By the later Neolithic, larger farming settlements were developing in this area. 
(One example is Mehrgarh, which I describe in Chapter 13.) A true civilization 
then appeared around 2600 B.C. It lasted at least 800 years and controlled an 
area twice as big as ancient Egypt or Mesopotamia, stretching from the Arabian 
Sea to the foothills of the Himalayas. The sites of Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, and 
several other Indus cities and towns had clever engineers who tamed the 
unpredictable river with flood control systems. Great walls of mud brick 
protected people and stored water for crops like wheat and barley.
City planning
Extremely well-planned Indus cities were laid out along rectangular grids of 
streets — some paved with stone. Here are other aspects of exquisite planning:
 
 Houses had wells and indoor toilets, and the water and sewer sys-
tems were the most sophisticated in the world until Roman times. At 
Mohenjo-Daro citizens used a large public bath that had graceful col-
umns and a pool with plastered bricks covered by natural tar.
 
 Craft specialists like potters, stone-workers, cloth-makers, bakers, or 
traders clustered in certain areas of the cities.
 
 Standard, precise systems of weights and measures are evident every-
where, from tiny artifacts like cubical stone weights to house sizes to 
the well-ordered streets.
 
 Large public buildings included granaries and other storage facilities.
Many mysteries
The symbols of the Indus writing system have yet to be deciphered, though 
archaeologists have excavated thousands of inscriptions on stone seals or 
pottery. Many images of cattle, which may have been sacred, provide a possible 
link to later Hinduism, though religious beliefs are not very discernible from 
the material remains. Cuneiform tablets and Indus artifacts in Mesopotamia 
indicate Indus merchants sailed the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf.
Interestingly, Indus civilization had no public art on a massive scale, no rich 
tombs or shrines, and no glorious palaces of supreme rulers. Archaeologists have 
discovered small statues (figurines of seated men or dancers), bone and ivory 

245
 Chapter 14: Ancient States
carvings, shell ornaments, precious stones and metals, and faience (fancy glazed 
pottery). But these wealth items are found in even modest homes, not lavishly dis-
played or concentrated in palaces or tombs. Little  evidence so far indicates war-
fare or militarism. Some say it was a relatively egalitarian (socially equal), peaceful 
society that emphasized engineering for the benefit of all. But the newest finds do 
include just a few graves of individuals who were apparently richer than the rest, 
with a pile of pottery vessels or beads of gold, onyx, jasper, and turquoise.
Archaeologists of course argue about why the Indus civilization disappeared in 1700 
B.C. Perhaps it was due to climate change and resulting collapse of trade, or maybe 
the river shifted and land fertility decreased. Some think that the deforestation 
(to get fuel to make all those baked mud bricks) made the environment unusable. 
But this civilization left a legacy of traditions that persist in the region, including 
depictions of yoga, ritual burning and bathing, and that sacred bull symbolism.
China: Vast empire
Written legends of the earliest Chinese ruling dynasties say that around 2200 
B.C., one powerful warlord united several competing kingdoms in northern 
China. Secure archaeological evidence only dates to the later Shang dynasty, 
beginning around 1200 B.C.
Shang cities
The An-yang site is the oldest known of the ancient Chinese cities and the 
Shang capital. It centered on the royal household and had bronze foundries 
and other craftworkers’ neighborhoods. Finds include thousands of oracle 
bones inscribed with questions about the future and outcomes of predicted 
events. Any writing about merchants’ goods and sales must have been on 
something that didn’t preserve, like cloth or wood. Other sacred inscriptions 
appear on pots of bronze. This precious mix of copper and tin wasn’t for 
everyday tools but only for these ritual vessels and weapons.
Shang rulers had powerful armies with horse-drawn chariots. Royal burials 
included chariots and horses as sacrificial offerings (bones are preserved, as 
are marks in the soil from the decayed wood), as well as those huge bronze 
pots, jade, and other precious artifacts. Just like in Mesopotamia, rulers’ 
graves also include sacrificed people — servants and even the chariot 
drivers — to help in the next life.
Zhou expansion
The Zhou dynasty took over in about 1100 B.C. Archaeological evidence shows 
power shifted to south China, and the state hierarchy expanded. Walled towns 
indicate military conquest, but also extension of economic systems. The 
famous Silk Road across central and southern Asia that connected China with 
the West became an important trade route. Settlements along this route 
showing the mix of peoples and goods that moved across the continent.

Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
Qin dynasty and later: An empire emerges
The first imperial state emerged during the Qin dynasty in 221 B.C. and achieved 
some amazing accomplishments. The Qin emperor’s administrators and builders 
finished the Great Wall, systematized the legal system, and built and expanded 
elaborate road and canal systems. The Chinese also standardized their writing 
system on newly invented paper. Archaeological finds include bamboo sheets 
bound into books.
Archaeologists have only partially excavated the Qin emperor’s stunning tomb. 
It covers a 500-acre complex and contains thousands of life-sized terra-cotta 
statues of warriors (see Figure 14-2 and discussion in Chapter 20) and horses 
with wooden chariots. They’re arrayed for battle, with swords and other 
weapons, and rich artifacts of gold, jade, silk, bone, pottery, and iron. Clearly, 
the guy had immense wealth and control!
Other dynasties came to power (and continued up to modern times). China 
was the biggest ancient state in the world, both in size and complexity.

 Chapter 14: Ancient States
Mesoamerica: Olmec, Maya, 
and Aztec civilizations
Mesoamerica encompasses central and southern Mexico, Guatemala, and 
other parts of Central America. Here, in both highlands and low rainforest 
and scrubland, a rich archaeological record documents the earliest states.
Olmec culture: Perhaps the first Mesoamerican state
In the Mexican tropics along the Gulf Coast, the first monumental stone pyra-
mids and other architecture and sculptures appear by 1000 B.C., marking the 
emergence of what archaeologists call Olmec culture. Major sites such as San 
Lorenzo and La Venta display famous stone monuments, especially the massive 
carved-stone heads like the one from La Venta (now displayed in Villahermosa, 
Mexico) shown in Figure 14-3. Other important finds are small beautiful jade fig-
ures with faces that have both jaguar and human characteristics.
The Olmec used symbols that may have been writing. They were the first to 
play team sports with a ball of rubber (tapped from the native trees), and a 
few preserved rubber balls and ball courts have been excavated. Figurines 
of both men and women players show them wearing arm and leg guards; the 
helmets on the giant stone heads may also have been for the ball game. It 
looks like rulers or important people were portrayed as ball players.
Olmec architecture and artifacts spread far and lasted a good 1,000 years. 
Archaeologists argue over whether this evidence is enough to indicate the 
earliest true Mesoamerican state, or just an art style, religious movement, or 
something else.
Teotihuacán and Maya city-states
In the highland valley center of Mexico was the home of the early great city-
state Teotihuacán, beginning in the first centuries A.D. Irrigation systems fed 
abundant farmland, and obsidian sources provided raw material that could 
be traded widely. The great Pyramid of the Sun and Pyramid of the Moon, 
and many other constructions, highlight this huge religious and civil center. 
Archaeologists have mapped the city and located even neighborhoods of 
foreigners such as Zapotec and Maya natives. Although it lasted for many 
centuries, the site was abandoned after A.D. 750. It was an empty sacred 
place by the time the Aztecs came along.
In southern Mexico and Guatemala and Belize, ruins of Maya pyramids were 
long thought to be vacant ceremonial centers where slash-and-burn farmers 
came for ritual purposes, and peaceful native astronomers observed the skies. 
Later, archaeologists cleared trees and used remote sensing (discussed more 
in Chapter 6) to see the jungle better and discover these ruins were instead 
huge cities with raised-field intensive agriculture. Then the glyph system was 
decoded, so now you can read about how the Maya city-states were actually 
often at war with each other.

Classic Maya (A.D. 250 to 900) sites feature pyramids surrounding plazas, 
and rich burials with carved stone, fancy jewelry, and jade ornaments. In 
Guatemala, Tikal is a Classic-period major center with several huge pyramid 
complexes. Palenque (see Color Figure 10), in Chiapas state, Mexico, features 
the tomb of Lord Pacal. (Pacal means “shield” in native Maya language.)
Mesoamerican collapse (or transformation?)
You hear a lot in the popular media about the classic Maya “collapse” 
(though, curiously, little about why Teotihuacán and other cities were 
abandoned). But the people didn’t go away (there are probably more Maya 
today than ever!); they just stopped building pyramids and living urban life. 
Some Maya pyramid centers in northern Yucatan did last longer than those 
in the south; later cultures build other towns with monumental architecture.
Whatever happened, it was a transformation not yet well understood. 
Some of the reasons may be climate change and drop in agricultural 
production, political over-reaching, social causes like peasant rebellion, 
or some combination of these and other factors.
Aztecs
Many other states flourished in Mesoamerica that I’ve not listed here, all 
known from archaeological evidence. But you know the latest and most 
famous, the Aztecs. Their capital, Tenochtitlán, (in today’s downtown Mexico 

249
 Chapter 14: Ancient States
City) was established in A.D. 1325 on a swampy island. You can see the 
excavated parts of this city today (as I explain in Chapter 20). The Aztecs 
built causeways to the island, as well as pyramids, aqueducts, raised farm 
fields, temples and palaces. Through conquest and alliance they created a 
large empire by the time the Spanish arrived in the early 1500s and defeated 
the native ruler Moctezuma. Archaeological data give a better picture of 
the Aztecs’ downfall than do the historical documents, which emphasize 
European guns and bad choices by native leaders. Excavation of contact-
period sites shows huge numbers of Aztecs quickly died from disease germs 
introduced by the Spanish, cancelling out their advantages — far greater 
numbers and seasoned warriors — over the very few conquistador invaders.
 
Aztecs and other Mesoamerican civilizations were very interested in bloody 
ritual sacrifice. Not all of these civilizations were necessarily militaristic, but the 
Aztecs certainly were fierce fighters who displayed racks of trophy skulls and 
apparently even practiced some cannibalism. However, for many thousands of 
years these cultures also had complex mathematics and engineering and 
developed elaborate calendars, writing systems, and incredible architecture and 
art. Who can say which civilizations are more bloody than others?
South American civilizations: 
Mountains, desert, and jungle
South American states arose in the Andes mountains and along the desert 
Pacific coast. These cultures never invented any writing, so everything 
known about them comes from archaeology. Their fascinating political 
systems were based on community organization, ancestor worship, and 
centralized state control, ownership, and distribution of all goods — an 
unusual kind of communism unknown to Western culture. You can see this 
both from the archaeological record and in the observations of the Spanish 
invaders recording indigenous society in the 16th century.
In Chapter 13, I describe how monumental architecture had already begun on 
the Peruvian coast and inland by 3000 to 2000 B.C.
Chavín culture: Arguably the earliest South American state
By 900 B.C., the emphasis shifted from coast to the high mountains with the 
site of Chavín de Huántar. Here’s what you can see there:
 
 Massive architecture with stone block platforms, sunken plazas and 
courts, and mazes of passageways with ventilation shafts
 
 Depictions of humans and animals, in stone carvings and pottery designs, 
that show a peculiar art style with elements of serpents, jaguars, caymans 
(lizards), and humans combined in repeated geometric shapes

250
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
The dating of Chavín de Huántar and other Chavín culture sites, and the jag-
uars and other images suggest at least indirect connections with the Olmec in 
Mesoamerica. Chavín culture, especially artistic styles and religious symbols, 
spread westward to the Pacific coast, where it’s called the Paracas culture. 
Here it’s famous for its colorful textiles with the same designs, preserved in 
the desert conditions.
Chavín may represent the earliest true state formation, or perhaps some 
centralized religious movement or economic or military control (though 
evidence of militarism is so far nonexistent). Archaeologists are, of course, 
still arguing about this!
Regional states
Between 200 B.C. and A.D. 600, some clear state societies emerged. Here are 
two famous examples:
 
 Moche, on the north Peru coast. Its huacas (pyramids) were constructed 
with millions of adobe bricks with makers’ marks (probably indicating 
those communal labor groups). Burials of lords were accompanied by 
gold, copper, feathers, textiles, and other riches. Moche pottery is famous 
for its depictions of everything from the spiritual to the humorous, and 
also of every conceivable area of daily life, including realistic sex scenes 
and jars shaped like vulvas and penises.
 
 Nazca, on the south Peru coast, with pyramid centers, elegant textiles, 
and colorful painted pottery. The famous Nazca lines are huge geoglyphs 
(shapes drawn by removing dark rocks to expose the lighter desert floor) 
over several hundred square miles. They’re shapes of geometric figures and 
animals. You can see the lines more clearly from the air, but also  pretty 
well from the ground or nearby hills. So you don’t need ancient astronauts 
from another galaxy to explain how these shapes were created.
Moche and other regional states did practice ritual human sacrifice. You see 
not only artistic depictions of this custom but also skeletons of people who 
were cut up and killed. This evidence isn’t necessarily proof of organized, 
large-scale warfare, though it’s a bloody business (especially if you’re one of 
the sacrificed prisoners).
South American empires
Between about A.D. 400 and 1200, the first South American empires arose. 
Wari (or Huari) was in southern Peru, and Tiwanaku (or Tiahuanaco) was in 
Bolivia and Chile. The Tiwanaku site, on the Bolivian altiplano (high plains) 
around Lake Titicaca, was a grand city with the famous stone-sculpted 
Gateway of the Sun. Distinctive artistic styles characterize this archaeological 
culture. Evidence indicates warfare and conquest, as well as diplomatic out-
posts for interaction between the two empires (and signs that they all drank 
lots of corn beer).

251
 Chapter 14: Ancient States
To support all this, llama herders moved up and down mountains each season, 
and Tiwanaku farmers engineered raised platforms to intensify agricultural 
production on low wetlands. (In Chapter 16, I show you how modern farmers 
are benefiting from these ancient practices discovered by archaeologists.) The 
archaeological record also shows how earthquakes and El Niño weather 
patterns (warm currents that killed off a lot of fish) affected the Pacific Coast 
and the highlands and sometimes interrupted the actions of states.
South American civilizations are the only ones that never developed writing. They 
recorded bureaucratic details with the quipu (or khipu), a system of knotted cords 
in different lengths and colors. Especially on the dry desert coast, many quipu are 
preserved. Archaeologists, mathematicians, and computer specialists are all 
working on decoding them.
The Inca
After the breakdown of the South American empires around A.D. 1000, smaller 
regional states again appeared. The Chimu are one of these states, known 
from both archaeology and the history that the Inca told to the Spanish. The 
Chimu capital at Chan Chan on the north coast of Peru was a huge city that 
controlled territory stretching from southern Ecuador to central Peru. The 
empire included great road and canal systems and craftworkers, especially 
goldsmiths, who made highly prized wealth items. The Chimu state lasted from 
A.D. 800 to 1470, when it was conquered by the Inca, who brought Chimu gold-
smiths to their own capital.
The Inca were the last great native civilization of South America. They 
resembled the Aztecs in Mexico in gaining power by military conquest. 
They began creating an empire shortly before the Spanish arrived in 1532 
and wrote about them, so investigating them is historic archaeology too.
The Inca empire was the largest in the world up to then. Along its road system 
connecting the coast and the Andes, relay runners brought messages (and fresh 
fish to the mountains). The capital was Cuzco, a highland city that still has 
prehistoric Inca stone-block foundations in modern buildings. Machu Picchu 
(see Figure 14-4 and Color Figure 12) is another famous site, an inaccessible 
highland estate. Inca construction techniques used trapezoidal doorways and 
huge pillow-shaped stones that fit together without mortar. 
Other South American cultures: Not much to find in the jungle
Preservation conditions in South America create some bias in the archaeological 
record. On the dry desert coast you have feathers, leather, cloth, even natural 
and artificial mummies preserved. In the Andes, high-altitude Inca burials and 
frozen mummies of sacrificed kids (yes) ensure equally good preservation of 
organic remains. Also in the mountains, lots of stone was available to build 
lasting buildings.

252
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
The jungle isn’t so friendly to archaeology. Ethnocentric views may be 
responsible for archaeologists’ not seeing complex civilizations in the 
Amazon and other parts of eastern South America. In addition, the rainforest 
isn’t good for preservation of most artifacts and also makes archaeology very 
difficult — after all, it’s a jungle out there!
Hot, humid climates may seem unfavorable for human accomplishment. But this 
view (held by archaeologists from temperate climates) is now being challenged. 
Fascinating jungle finds indicate elaborate road systems and earthen mounds. 
Spanish records document complicated states in the “intermediate area” of 
northern South America not evident archaeologically because the construction 
and monuments were all of the abundant wood. Stay tuned for new discoveries.
Reasons for Civilization
Archaeologists exploring what causes true civilization to develop in the first place 
get to argue not only among themselves but also with historians! Different causes 
probably influenced different regions. Here are some of the hypothesized factors 
tied to the emergence of the most complicated societies humans have ever known:
 
 Irrigation to intensify food production was complicated enough to require 
large scale organization by some kind of leader. Hierarchical rulers and 
bureaucracy followed. This explanation is plausible, but different kinds of 
irrigation (from local to grand scale) appeared in different places.
 
 Population growth and resulting competition for resources led to the 
need for central organization. This explanation may work in some 
places. But in Egypt populations were pretty low; plenty of land was 
open, and no evidence exists for resource competition until after the 
complex state was formed.
 
 Long-distance trade networks led to economic control systems.
 
 Some characteristics of society — large populations, building irrigation 
systems — required more complex organization and bureaucratic 
administration.
 
 Warfare and conquest led to natural expansion of territories for rulers 
wanting to control resources and wealth.
Concerning the last point, everyone debates whether competition and warfare 
were necessary for the first true states to emerge. Even violent images depicted 
on pots or wall paintings can still mean small-scale feuds or human sacrifice. 
Real warfare is sanctioned, organized, paid for by the central government, and 
big enough to result in casualties of many people who aren’t even fighting.
Before Maya history was known, archaeologists thought they were peaceful 
astronomers. Now that the glyph writing system has been decoded, it’s clear 
that Maya city-states were beating each other up all the time! On the other 

253
 Chapter 14: Ancient States
hand, archaeologists excavating the Indus Valley civilization have so far 
unearthed little sign of violence — no defensive fortifications or weapons or 
mass burials of victims with battle wounds. Yet these people had amazingly 
engineered cities, beautiful crafts, great wealth, and widespread territory. 
This is also true (so far) for Olmec and Chavín.
 
Ancient warfare may seem like a fanciful question of no consequence, but it’s 
really important. You may think that all societies have warfare, but anthropol-
ogists have collected enough information from enough cultures to show that 
some don’t have any war at all! Furthermore, no scientific evidence supports 
the idea that humans are biologically prone to violence. Archaeologists can 
contribute a lot to this discussion about human nature.

Reflections on New World civilizations
The Inca, Maya, and other native Mesoamerican 
and South American peoples aren’t gone. But 
500 years of colonial domination have radically 
transformed their cultures. Many Maya dialects, 
other Mesoamerican languages, and South 
American native languages such as Quechua, 
the language of the Inca, are still spoken. The 
native peoples also take great pride in the indig-
enous archaeological heritage of these lands 
(even though looting still occurs).

254
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
Later Ancient States and 
Early Historic Times
After the first civilizations appeared on the planet, many later ones followed. 
Most of this is the stuff of history, but archaeology adds lots more informa-
tion. The following sections give a couple examples of what the archaeologi-
cal record of later civilizations can contribute.
Greece
Civilizations you’ve heard a lot about, from both history and archaeology, are 
those classical places of legend that are the foundations of Western culture.
Bronze-Age Greece (1600 to 1100 B.C.) is where those heroic events of 
Homer’s Iliad and other legends took place. Of course, he wrote them all 
down much later, so archaeology can help here. I mention the early work of 
Heinrich Schliemann’s digs at Troy in Chapter 3, but he also dug at Mycenae, 
a fortified town on a Greek hilltop. Here he found rulers in tombs with 
immense riches — gold masks, cups, jewelry, crystal and glass, amber, ivory, 
silver, and other offerings. Mycenaean civilization disappeared for unknown 
reasons — no one has found evidence of climate change or conquest.
Archaeologically, the succeeding time periods each have their own distinctive 
styles of building ruins, pottery, and other artifacts. Between 700 and 600 B.C., 
coins appear, as well as the earliest monumental stone sculpture. With the 
emergence of the classic Greek city-states at this time came huge marble 
temples, large statues of heroic religious and political figures, and the rest of 
the vast record of material culture documenting the classical civilization that 
became the foundations for Western culture and democracy.
Rome
Rome expanded from a city on the Italian peninsula to become an empire 
stretching around the Mediterranean Sea. It began a few centuries B.C. and 
extended until the fifth century A.D. You know all this from history, gleaned 
from Roman documents, but of course archaeology makes great contributions 
to the reconstruction of Rome as well.
Material remains show the everyday lives of people, from the wealthy to 
the slaves, and from the early days of the republic to the fall of the empire 
Construction anywhere in Italy, and elsewhere throughout the extent of what 
Rome controlled, often hits buried ruins. Here are a few finds from 2008:

255
 Chapter 14: Ancient States
 
 Italian archaeologists digging 25 feet below the street near the 
Colosseum unearthed the ruins of a large temple dating to the eighth 
century B.C., the first real evidence of the time of Rome’s second king. 
Near this temple were a paved street and two wells.
 
 Alerted by reports of grave robbing and looting, archaeologists found 
and excavated a necropolis (burial ground) near Rome’s main airport 
that dated to the first century A.D. Most of the 300 male skeletons 
showed signs of carrying great loads on their backs. They were probably 
longshoremen and other working-class people who kept early imperial 
Rome running. The humble grave goods included simple jewelry and 
lanterns of clay and glass, probably to light the way into the next life.
 
 Excavation for a major subway station in Rome uncovered a ninth-
century kitchen with pots, pans, and ovens. The finds are useful for 
showing daily life in medieval times, when there is little written record 
of such mundane aspects of culture.
Biblical sites
I discuss in Chapters 3 and 16 how a great deal of archaeology focuses on 
sites in Israel and the land considered holy by major modern religions. Many 
digs seek to prove the truth of the Bible, and others just want to find out 
what’s really there. Much of the work is done by historians and others not 
anthropologically oriented, and frauds and sensational claims are common.
But scientific archaeology has uncovered Egyptian and Mesopotamian 
inscriptions with names mentioned in the Bible, as well as sites that are 
places named in the Bible. I describe a little of this archaeology for you in 
Chapter 13, discussing digs at the biblical city of Jericho. The Neolithic layers 
there were covered by deposits of later cultures, and archaeologists still 
aren’t certain which is the time period of the written records amid the ruins 
of stone walls and towers.
The site of Megiddo in northern Israel shows the same kind of long occupation 
span that makes it difficult to tie into specific biblical times, but it’s most likely 
the place named Armageddon in the Bible. It’s a tell (mound) of 25 to 30 layers 
of succeeding settlements from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic village of 7,000 B.C. to 
the city dating to 500 B.C. Excavated remains include city walls, fortifications, 
palaces, water management systems, a temple with a mosaic floor and Roman 
altar, and even a storehouse that may have been a stable with stone mangers 
and pillars for tying up horses. One notable find was a carved jasper seal 
showing a lion and a Hebrew inscription with the name of Jeroboam, an early 
king mentioned in the Bible.
Some archaeological finds have included ancient texts, papyri, and Dead Sea 
scrolls that, under slow, patient examination, reveal ancient religious writings 
of Hebrews and early Christians. 

256
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
Other prehistoric Asian and African states
All kinds of other ancient states command the attention of archaeologists 
(and historians and tourists). I’ve chosen just a couple more to describe, so 
you can get an idea of the greatness of past peoples all over the world, and 
also the archaeological contributions to the knowledge of great civilizations.
Angkor
Bronze and Iron Age technologies, religious influences from India and China, 
and extensive trade networks and maritime connections all influenced the 
development of the southeast Asian state of Angkor, in the Mekong River 
region of modern Cambodia. Around A.D. 800, a strong ruler united several 
smaller states into the great Khmer civilization that lasted some 600 years. 
Different succeeding rulers each built new temples and monuments. (See 
Chapter 20 for another discussion on Angkor.) The individual artifacts from 
daily life and special ceremony that would have been in these grand ruins 
were removed centuries ago, but the architectural and artistic remains give 
many archaeological clues to past political and religious systems. Cambodian 
and international archaeological teams are also restoring some of the ruins.
The largest palace is Angkor Wat, shown in Figure 14-5, dating to around A.D. 
1113. It’s a huge complex of buildings and walled enclosures covered with 
carved reliefs of sacred stories, royal activities (processions and battles), 
and everyday scenes (merchants, cooks, people fishing and selling fish). 
Another major centers was Angkor Thom (see Color Figure 13), the last and 
biggest capital (8 miles long!), constructed in the late 12th century. It features 
long stone-carved pictures of animals and royal people, including one scene 
of elephants parading along a stone wall over 1,000 feet long.
With excavations, mapping, and remote sensing, archaeologists are exposing 
vast reservoirs and other constructions that show the Khmer civilization was 
founded on elaborate water management systems, apparently to control 
flooding and help enormous rice production. This indigenous Angkor civili-
zation ended with invasions from Thailand in A.D. 1431. Archaeologists are 
only now realizing its tremendous extent and engineering technologies and 
are arguing over how and why they were created and possibly declined even 
before the palaces were all abandoned and left to the jungle.
Great Zimbabwe
Great civilizations based on iron technology and cattle herding arose in southern 
Africa from the 12th century A.D. onwards. Great Zimbabwe is one of the most 
famous and spectacular of these, originating around A.D. 1250 and lasting a couple 
centuries. (I describe this site also in Chapter 20.) Here archaeologists exposed 
and mapped terraces, walls, and great stone enclosures surrounding platforms 
with foundations of houses made of logs and mud.

257
 Chapter 14: Ancient States

The Hill Complex (see Color Figure 14) may have been for defense. It features 
stone walls beautifully connected to the natural rock formations. The Great 
Enclosure is a huge walled oval some 300 feet long, with distinctive chevron 
(V-shaped) patterns made in the stone bricks along the top. It surrounds 
other buildings, including a solid conical tower. Little is known about the 
functions of all these structures.
Artifacts from the site include native-made artifacts like iron tools; brass 
wire bracelets, pins, needles, and razors; gold jewelry; and stone spindle 
whorls that show cotton thread was spun and woven. A distinctive native 
artifact form is a bird figure on top a tall pillar, all carved of soapstone. Finds 
of Persian pottery, Chinese porcelain, cowrie shells from the Indian Ocean, 
Arabian coins, and European glass beads are evidence of extensive trade net-
works.
Archaeologists are still investigating the meanings and uses of the massive 
ruins at Great Zimbabwe and related sites, from which there are no written 
records. Decades ago, the racist colonial British rulers of the country (then 
known as Rhodesia) insisted that such a glorious civilization must have 
been built by Arabs or Portuguese traders — anyone but black Africans, who 
wouldn’t be capable of such grand accomplishments. Thanks to good archae-
ology (and politics), it’s now clear that Great Zimbabwe was indigenous. It 
was built by the ancestors of native Shona people who still live in the region. 
The site has become a national symbol, and the name was chosen for the 
country when it became independent in the late 20th century!

The demise of civilizations
Many of the elaborate cities and monuments 
of the civilizations described in this chapter 
were abandoned far back in ancient times. 
Different reasons and conditions (for archae-
ologists to argue about!) apply in each case, but 
“collapse” isn’t as accurate a term for these 
events as “transformation” into something else. 
Some ancient states did use up their resources 
and never recovered their former glory when 
unfortunate events (drought, earthquake, and 
invasion) hit them, so these civilizations can 
provide some cautionary tales for modern 
people and governments!

n Chapter 14, I explain how archaeology helps you understand the earli-
est civilizations, even those with written records. This chapter shows the 
importance of archaeology for more recent time periods, where it provides 
the kind of evidence you can’t get from history. Some areas of life are just not 
described in what people wrote!
In this chapter, I describe the historic archaeology of classical and medieval 
folks, colonists, famous historic men, slaves, criminals, everyday people, 
and modern society. You may end up thinking twice about all the material 
evidence you yourself leave around!
What Historic Archaeology 
Shows That History Can’t
History is the written record of what people did and thought. But it’s very 
selective — it doesn’t include everything or everyone. The everyday things 
people left behind tell you a lot about mundane life that history leaves out. 
Archaeology gives you a different perspective on the historic past. It may 
confirm what you thought based on the written information or expand the 
basic knowledge of history. But archaeology can also give a totally different 
view from what you expected.

260
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
Archaeology and the biases of history
Prehistoric people were either non-literate (never developed writing) or pre-
literate (hadn’t yet begun using a writing system they’d later develop). After 
cultures became literate, you can read about how they behaved and thought 
if you can decipher the writing. (Then of course you have the illiterate folks — 
who have writing and don’t know how to use it — but they’re not the subject of 
this book!)
 
Even in the early civilizations that developed writing starting over 3,000 
years ago, few people could actually read and write. Most of the traditions 
and  stories of culture were learned through oral history. People repeated the 
accumulated knowledge — legends, beliefs, everyday learning, and extraor-
dinary events — often enough to pass it to succeeding generations. When 
the information was finally written down, it had usually changed a great deal 
from the original version. Beyond these compromised accounts, really very 
little about past human life has made it into written documents.
As I describe in Chapters 3 and 14, history is always biased for many reasons:
 
 It’s written by those few who are literate and important.
 
 It favors the values, views, and stories of those writing it.
 
 It usually covers only high-status topics like politics and religion, not 
daily chores or people outside literate spheres.
Counteracting this bias is where archaeology comes in. Granted, bias cer-
tainly exists in archaeology too, but in very different ways. The major archae-
ological bias is that only certain material things are preserved, and only a 
portion of those get excavated, so you may miss major aspects of the past. 
But you can dig in splendid ruins of palaces and tombs or humble houses 
with the debris of everyday living, so unlike historical bias, you needn’t dis-
criminate in favor of those in power who knew how to write.
The people without history
 
Many people’s history has been poorly written or never written at all. Maybe 
they weren’t considered important by those invading, subjugating, or colo-
nizing them. Perhaps they were slaves brought to other countries. Little 
knowledge of the past exists even for groups like women, children, the poor, 
or any folks who couldn’t or didn’t write down their own records. For those 
without a history, archaeology has the important job of helping us gain or 
improve knowledge of how these people lived.

261
 Chapter 15: Historic Archaeology: Reinterpreting the More Recent Past
People and objects with lots of history
You may think the archives and records document famous people and 
events well enough. Think again; plenty of information isn’t written down. 
Archaeological excavation uncovers new data at important historic sites and 
even around standing structures. For example, much remains in the ground to 
investigate at battlefields, famous people’s estates, even public monuments.
Historical Archaeology’s 
Methods and Finds
Your historical archaeology research will probably be a lot easier if you’re 
looking for something specific that you know actually existed. A lost ceme-
tery or church, a famous building now gone, or even an early settlement long 
demolished usually leaves material evidence. You can use typical archaeo-
logical methods, supplemented by the written records, to find such sites. The 
following sections detail some of those methods and their uses.
Investigation methods and questions
The things you study in any archaeological investigation are important for 
historic archaeology. I include many of the procedures of historical archaeol-
ogy in the explanations of field methods in Chapters 6 and 7 and laboratory 
analysis in Chapter 9; some of these standard methods are 
 
 Looking at old maps of your site and any other documentary records.
 
 Interviewing elderly residents of the area and recording any other oral 
history available to discern what may have been there.
 
 Using remote sensing to locate buried structures and other features.
 
 Excavating with standard techniques, but possibly using historic units of 
measurement such as feet and yards.
 
 Showing artifact types and distributions in space and time and mapping 
activity areas.
Communities often support archaeological research and have historical ques-
tions they want you to address. Where were the first settlers located? Were 
our ancestors here? Maybe you wonder where something historic was actu-
ally built or who used it. Having legitimate questions to answer is imperative 
before you begin excavation, because you destroy the site as you dig. 

262
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
The approach to historic artifacts
Often you can understand historic artifacts better than prehistoric ones 
because you’re more familiar with them or because records describe them. 
Artifacts are nonverbal ways of seeing behavior in the past: Manufactured 
objects like bottles, dishes, or nails may sound boring or unremarkable, but 
where they’re located and who used them can be fascinating. Plus, you can 
look them up and get a more exact idea of when and where they were made.
Mundane artifacts like crockery represent a larger social picture in some 
famous historic archaeology investigations. For example:
Information from pipes and toothbrushes
The first Europeans coming to North America 
and seeing tobacco may have thought it was 
weird — smoke coming out of a person’s nose 
and mouth! But they soon took up the nicotine 
habit themselves, and British colonists began 
growing tobacco on American plantations 
as the habit gained international popularity. 
White clay smoking pipes are ubiquitous at 
colonial sites — the pipes were cheap, mass-
produced, and frequently discarded. Some pipes 
had makers’ marks and shapes that changed 
through time, but most finds are fragments. 
From the thousands of pipes excavated at 
colonial sites, historic archaeologists have 
developed a neat dating method. They saw that 
the hole or bore in the pipe stem got smaller 
through time as the stem lengthened, so they 
developed a formula for dating a site based 
on the diameters of a large sample of pipe 
stem bores for pipes manufactured in England 
between about 1590 and 1800. Other studies are 
attempting to trace sources of the white clay in 
different parts of England and different makers’ 
molds, to show how these simple artifacts were 
made and moved across land and sea.
Archaeological study of another small, every-
day artifact from domestic sites examined the 
larger story. Toothbrushes began as hand-
made items of bone and boar-hair bristles. In 
the late 19th century, industrialists developed 
technology to manufacture them, eventually 
from synthetic materials and with bristles 
in neat, machine-made rows. Toothbrushes 
increase in numbers through time at historic 
sites: Once only items in elite households, they 
became things everybody had by the mid-20th 
century. The new brushes reflected not only 
mechanized standardization of the artifact 
but also the idea of orderliness and individual 
hygiene spreading through society at the time. 
Though it was a humble item, this artifact was 
a symbol that people were becoming modern. 
The archaeology connected everyday life 
with intellectual currents and values. Another 
investigation defined different types of tooth-
brushes well enough to use them to date 
archaeological sites where they were found.

263
 Chapter 15: Historic Archaeology: Reinterpreting the More Recent Past
 
 Pottery in early colonial sites demonstrates how women mediated 
between the Spanish and Native Americans in early historic America. 
Native pots and dishes found in Spanish dwellings mean that Indian 
women worked and possibly lived there serving the Spanish men.
 
 Choosing to use worn, unmatched dishes, 19th-century African 
Americans in Maryland deliberately showed a separate identity from 
that of the dominant white culture, whose Victorian emphasis was on 
matched sets of tableware.
Underwater historic sites
Underwater archaeology is difficult and expensive (see Chapters 3 and 7 for 
more), but it can yield amazing finds. Shipwrecks represent one-time events, 
capturing a slice of life. Other underwater sites can be entire settlements that 
somehow slipped beneath the sea. They offer you a longer-term view of past 
life in many ways. The following sections give you some examples of informa-
tion you can uncover at underwater sites.
Shipwrecks
The archaeology of shipwrecks presents fascinating pictures of local and 
international commerce or naval warfare. You get details of life at sea and the 
personal lives of individuals of different statuses who sailed together. From 
cargo, armaments, and the vessel itself you pick up information on trade, 
politics, economic systems, and techniques of historic ship-building that 
were never written down.
 
French explorer La Salle went down the Mississippi River in 1682, claimed all 
the land for France, and named it Louisiana. He then tried to go back through 
the Gulf of Mexico to establish a colony, missed the Mississippi, and lost his 
last ship, the Belle, on the Texas coast in 1686. Underwater archaeologists 
found the Belle and its whole cargo preserved under the mud; they knew they 
had the right ship because the cannon was inscribed with the ship’s name. 
The ship’s timbers still had numbers written on them for helping builders 
assemble it. Millions of artifacts were excavated: brass pots and candlesticks, 
Jesuit rings, glass beads and rosaries, weapons, the ship’s ropes and rigging, 
and even the skeleton of one crew member with brain matter still in the skull! 
All this material filled in the little known story of what the French expected to 
do in their new colony.
Underwater cities
Human settlements can become submerged quickly or slowly by many 
natural forces, whether it be a tsunami or gradually rising sea levels. They’re 
often port cities with lots of social and economic evidence; you just have to 
be willing to dive for it.

264
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
 
Here are a couple of the more famous underwater cities:
 
 The harbor of Alexandria, built on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt in 
331 B.C., was inundated by earthquake, tsunami, and slower geological 
processes. Underwater finds from this ancient city complement the data 
from digs on land. Archaeologists have recovered some possible pieces 
of its lighthouse, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. They’re 
mapping  buildings like wharves and  the probable location of a palace 
(possibly Cleopatra’s). Stone columns and engraved blocks, statues, and 
sphinxes show combinations of Egyptian and Greek architectural 
traditions and lively commerce connecting Europe, Africa, and Asia.
 
 Port Royal, Jamaica, a large, rich, colonial English city, partially sank 
in an earthquake in 1692. Underwater excavation uncovered details 
of architecture, craftwork, merchants’ activities, and town planning. 
One building had a tavern, a cobbler shop, and a possible pipe shop. 
Skeletons of a few children lay in some buildings. The rich artifact 
assemblages include pottery, copper, brass, jewelry, and glass from 
many nations and items of native people. They all tell about the city’s 
wealth and fabled wickedness, with all its grogshops, gaming houses, 
and brothels for pirates to spend their treasure. Pewter artifacts helped 
reconstruct Jamaica’s previously unknown role in the pewter trade.
Classical Archaeology
In Chapters 3 and 14, I describe how classical archaeology studies ancient 
civilizations of the Mediterranean world — including Greece, Rome, and 
sometimes the surrounding states in Mesopotamia and Egypt — the cultural 
foundations of Western society. These civilizations existed from several cen-
turies B.C. until about A.D. 500. Though classical archaeology traditionally 
emphasized monumental architecture and works of art like beautiful sculp-
ture or vases, in recent decades anthropological archaeology — looking at 
how these past people lived — is becoming the norm.
Classical civilizations left  historic records carved in stone, painted on pottery, 
stamped on coins, and written on animal-skin parchment scrolls. By the early 
Roman Empire there were bound books, and copyists kept important manuscripts 
available through medieval times. When you study classical antiquity, you’re doing 
historic archaeology and adding to ancient history.
Here are some things you can do as a classical archaeologist:
 
 Excavate one famous place, such as the Agora (civic center) in Athens, 
and see how it changed through the centuries from the Greek heyday of 
the fifth to fourthth centuries B.C. through Roman times.

265
 Chapter 15: Historic Archaeology: Reinterpreting the More Recent Past
 
 Examine tombs, houses, monuments, and paintings of the Etruscans 
(a pre-Roman people of Tuscany, Italy) to see how they held women in 
higher esteem than the Romans did, and taught Romans engineering.
 
 Investigate Roman soldiers’ camps in Britain or other places that were 
far outposts of the empire.
 
 Uncover mosaics and architectural elements of Roman towns buried 
under medieval or modern cities.
 
 Trace commerce and other economic and social systems by studying 
certain artifact types such as amphorae (large ceramic jars for wine, oil, 
or other commodities) to see where they were made over the centuries 
and where they ended up around the Mediterranean.
Medieval Archaeology
Because the Middle Ages were often times of minimal literature and literacy, 
much of what historians know — outside of the workings of powerful leaders — 
comes from the archaeological record.
Medieval archaeology emphasizes post-Roman and later archaeological sites 
across Europe and elsewhere, up to about the 16th century. It gives you 
details of the lives of Celts, Saxons, Norse, and other poorly known cultures. 
The Middle Ages were a time of Germanic tribes, Muslim conquests around 
the Mediterranean, and persistence or loss of Roman systems. The many 
small kingdoms or chiefdoms that emerged over the centuries left only a few 
historic records, so archaeological knowledge is a welcome addition.
The problem of looting
Unfortunately, antiques and other historic 
artifacts command big prices at auctions. 
Looting of historic sites (even graves) is 
constant, even though it’s usually illegal and 
always unethical and disrespectful. People are 
robbing the heritage of the human past and of 
someone’s ancestors.
In a recent case, after a report of looting, 
archaeologists excavated a cemetery at a 
New Mexico Civil War fort. At least 20 graves 
had been robbed. One looter had displayed in 
his house various artifacts and a mummified 
soldier in a military uniform. Most of his finds 
were already sold off before government inves-
tigators arrived. The remains of the soldiers and 
others, including children, were reburied with 
dignity at other national cemeteries.
Underwater historic sites are constantly looted. 
Recently a treasure-hunting company, funded 
by investors hoping to get rich from a historic 
shipwreck, planned to dig a shaft through the 
ship to the place below decks where they think 
the gold is, thus destroying the ship itself and 
its artifacts.

266
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
Even standing medieval structures like castles or abbeys have underground 
traces. At a typical dig, you uncover debris of daily life as well as evidence of 
political ceremony and religious ritual. You can go farther and explore the 
transformations of feudal villages into towns and the roots of modern nations.
Here are some things you can do in medieval archaeology:
 
 Excavate occasional buried hoards of treasure, caches of gold, silver, 
and jewels perhaps hidden from invaders.
 
 Relocate and map buildings like churches, convents, castles, and manor 
houses and see how early they were established.
 
 Find the quarry sites where medieval builders got the building stones 
and see how they went about stone construction.
 
 Investigate foundations in the ground of buildings whose stones were 
taken and reused long ago. You can establish how structure outlines 
changed over time with repair and expansion.
 
 Study change through time in artifact assemblages and architectural 
design at these places, many of which were occupied for centuries.
 
 Reconstruct what life was like for peasants, clergy, farmers, and nobles 
as social classes developed and changed.
 
 Compare your findings with architectural historians’ studies of castles and 
cathedrals and historical studies of life at court and in the countryside.
 
 Do landscape archaeology incorporating the fortress or castle grounds, 
stables, outbuildings, and workers’ quarters. You can investigate estate 
management, craft production, and other feudal systems.
 
 Explore change in land-use patterns showing clearing of forests and 
establishments of post-Roman farm and small-village systems.
Under the volcano: Discovering Pompeii
Pompeii, near Naples, Italy, and its port town 
of Herculaneum are famous Roman sites. The 
volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 
buried them under many tons of ash, leaving 
a wonderfully preserved archaeological record 
to compare with the few surviving written 
accounts of the city. The remains of people 
trapped as they tried to flee the volcano are 
heartbreaking. Some have gold and jewelry; 
others have no wealth items and have evidence 
of hard labor in their bones, showing they were 
slaves — but all died alike. You can visit there 
today and see houses, stores, paved streets, 
and theaters exposed by the excavation that 
has been continuous over centuries. My favorite 
spots are the public baths and public toilets — 
so civilized! Beautiful paintings on the walls 
show scenes of daily life and myths, legends, 
and religious ceremonies.

267
 Chapter 15: Historic Archaeology: Reinterpreting the More Recent Past
 
 Investigate local and regional ritual and religion, for example as Roman 
villas became converted to Christian settlements or even monasteries.
 
 Document with material evidence larger historic trends such as the 
spread of Christianity or presence of Judaism throughout Europe or 
retention of various pagan practices.
 
 Discover cemeteries and investigate burials to see health, diet, and 
other physical aspects of these historic populations of different regions.
At a medieval dig, you may be unearthing traces of a knight’s armor or a Viking 
ship. You gather knowledge of chiefs, battles, interactions across continents, and 
the historic foundations of the modern world. In the late Middle Ages, you can 
also see how traditions of long-distance exploration began. For example, the Norse 
or Vikings colonized many foreign lands, from Europe to Iceland and Greenland. 
They even made it to America nearly 500 years before Christopher Columbus!
Archaeology of Invasion and Colonization
Europeans and others who first came to North and South America began 
to write the history of the Native Americans. But they often gave distorted 
interpretations of native culture and customs, or didn’t even see them at all. 
Archaeological work at protohistoric (contact-period) sites documents the 
routes the first explorers took through the Americas and the effects of first 
contact between indigenous peoples and invaders. Excavations of mission 
sites and early colonial settlements reveal how both groups interacted.
The same situation is true for European and other intruders into Africa, Asia, 
Australia, and the Pacific. Information from colonial sites demonstrates how 
natives were treated and how foreigners’ lives changed as they became long-
term residents and then creoles (the next generation, born there but of for-
eign origin). You can see this in the artifact assemblages when you compare 
distributions and uses of native-made items and imported goods or foods, 
or when you map the arrangement of natives’ and foreigners’ houses or reli-
gious and civic buildings across the town.
An abandoned Spanish 
town in the Americas
 
What early explorers experienced in making their way through the New World 
shows up in the archaeological record. One example is the site of the first 
European town in America, Christopher Columbus’s 1493 La Isabella on the 
island of Hispaniola, in today’s Dominican Republic. It’s typically medieval, 
with walls and stone buildings for defense against the island’s Taino Indians. 
The Spanish even established a stone quarry. But their town failed — they 

268
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
abandoned it in four years and went on to other, more lucrative places in the 
Americas. The records say the soldiers were starving and rebellious.
The Spaniards lived like they did at home: Excavated artifacts included pot-
tery, carved and painted plaster fragments from walls, forged metal nails and 
decorative items, horseshoes, chain mail and armor, daggers and swords, 
crossbow bolt heads, gun parts, and Christian items. The lack of food 
remains suggests they wouldn’t even eat local foods the Native Americans 
would have brought. They didn’t accommodate to the material and social 
life of the people already there but tried forcefully to change the natives’ reli-
gion, economy, and society. It was no surprise that the Indians resisted. Later 
Spanish colonies shifted towards adaptation, and their material remains 
show combinations of European, Native American, and African traditions.
Famous archaeological sites of Vikings
Vikings were Scandinavian farmers and 
warriors who sailed the seas, raiding and 
colonizing. They settled among Anglo-Saxons in 
northern England and established their capital 
at Jorvik, now in the city of York. Archaeological 
excavations there reveal amazing information 
on medieval life, far beyond what you read in 
the histories of kings. Digs uncovered houses 
and shops of leather-workers and bone carvers, 
and artifacts like wooden cups, iron tools, and 
cheap jewelry of lead or copper alloy, as well 
as gold, silver, glass, amber, and symbolic items 
of both Christian and pagan religions. Food 
and other remains in the dirt floors of houses 
included wheat, barley, wild plants, hemp and 
linseed oil, and herbs and spices like dill and 
celery seed. Human fleas and lice were also 
preserved, as well as a famous large human 
coprolite (dried feces) that contained parasitic 
intestinal worms. Other finds are trade items 
like silk and coins from distant places, showing 
that economic networks extended as far as 
western Asia. You can visit York today and 
see a complete reconstruction of what this 
settlement was like in the year 975.
Viking explorers also got to the New World 
by about A.D. 1000. The L’Anse aux Meadows 
National Historic Site of Canada is the earliest 
known European settlement in the Americas. 
Norse sagas tell of sailing from Greenland to 
a place that sounded like North America. The 
archaeological site, discovered in 1960 on the 
northernmost tip of Newfoundland, proves the 
legends to be true. They came for lumber and 
furs, but conflict with the local natives, whose 
archaeological remains show they’d already 
been there 5,000 years, soon drove the Norse 
away. The dig uncovered a small settlement 
with houses, workshops, and a forge that 
produced the first iron on the continent. 
Excavated buildings have sod walls and roofs 
over timber frames and central fireplaces, 
similar to 11th-century Norse buildings in 
Iceland and Greenland. Artifacts include a 
bronze cloak pin, an oil lamp, iron boat nails, 
even wood chips from trimming logs. A bone 
needle, whetstone, and soapstone spindle 
whorl for spinning thread show women’s 
presence. A clay-lined pit framed with large 
stones was the furnace for smelting iron for 
the blacksmith shop and forge. Food remains 
included butternuts, which don’t grow this far 
north. Neither do the grapes that were noted 
in the legends calling the place Vinland (place 
of vines). So archaeologists determined that 
this site was probably a base camp for people 
exploring farther south along the St. Lawrence 
River and New Brunswick areas.

269
 Chapter 15: Historic Archaeology: Reinterpreting the More Recent Past
Spanish missions in the U.S. Southeast
 
You may be familiar with the adobe or stone buildings of historic Spanish 
missions in the southwestern U.S. Missions were established earlier (in the 
1600s) in the Southeast, but they left fewer traces — no standing structures, 
because the buildings were made of wood. Nonetheless, archaeologists 
have located many of them and excavated their churches, convents (where 
friars lived), and native houses and public buildings. Cemeteries are near the 
churches or within church floors. Spatial distributions of Native American 
artifacts and European goods such as glass and iron show the different 
activity areas of the sites.
In Chapter 19, I describe one of these missions — San Luis in Florida — 
where you can visit reconstructed Spanish and Apalachee Indian buildings. 
Continued study of these sites gives amazing insight into how both natives 
and newcomers changed to live with (or resist) each other. Native American 
skeletons show they labored harder under Spanish control than they had 
before the foreigners arrived. Yet historic documents indicate that these 
indigenous people invited the Spanish friars to their villages. Could it have 
been because they wanted the prestige goods like beads and metals that the 
intruders brought to trade?
A French fort in Alabama
 
The archaeology of Fort Toulouse/Jackson Park near Montgomery, Alabama, 
compares well with the historic records. Accounts indicate that French colo-
nists, afraid of rival British advancement, built a fort there in 1717 and then 
rebuilt it in 1749. The Creek Indians were friendly, trading their deerskins for 
glass beads, guns, metal items and household goods. The French left in 1763, 
but in 1814 the Americans built another fort on top of the old ruins. This last 
settlement was abandoned in 1819.
Excavators went deep enough to uncover underlying prehistoric cultural 
deposits. The earliest inhabitants were Native American hunter–gatherers at 
about 5,000 B.C., and later natives had a farming village and earthen mounds. 
Archaeological features such as postmolds from the wooden palisades have 
shown the outlines of multiple French forts. The second fort was moved 
back from the bank of the river, which washed away part of the first one. 
The American fort is the biggest and latest. Artifacts include lots of Indian 
pottery, other indigenous craft items, and the European goods the natives 
traded for. A particularly striking find was the corpus (body of Christ) from a 
French crucifix, shown in Color Figure 15.

Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
Investigating Famous Figures
Colonial archaeology is famous in the U.S. Homes and public buildings of his-
toric figures always have archaeological remains that can become a big part 
of the story — or change the story.
Historic estates offer many clues into lesser-known areas of their owners’ 
lives. Even the layout of their gardens and outbuildings reflects the orderly 
world views and high social status of their owners. Archaeologists compare 
the evidence in the ground with details from personal letters or other papers 
and information from architectural historians and other specialists. They can 
then see a broader picture of the lives of some famous personages and their 
social or political circumstances.
 
Thomas Jefferson’s home at Monticello, Virginia, housed his family, free 
workers, and hundreds of slaves. Excavations at craft production areas 
(like buildings for blacksmiths and carpenters), as well as at artisans’ and 
slaves’ homes, show social and economic patterns of this complex society. 
Archaeology gives you great details of the labor and skills of those who 
conducted the agricultural and industrial production supporting Jefferson’s 
political accomplishments. You can visit there today and see much of the 
estate accurately reconstructed.
I describe the excavation of George Washington’s distillery in Chapter 3 (and 
see Color Figure 5) at his home in Mount Vernon (which you can also visit). 
Archaeologists combined information from his papers with what they dug 
up to reconstruct the techniques he used to produce and sell considerable 
quantities of whiskey! You may be surprised to see that archaeological 
excavation recently exposed another, less-known aspect of Washington’s life: 
his slaves. (More on that in the next section.)
The Archaeology of Slavery
Much of the hidden lives of slaves comes alive through archaeology. You 
can see in the material evidence how they created distinctive cultures and 
customs within horrible systems of oppression. Archaeologists examine 
slavery especially in North and South America and the Caribbean.
 
In 2007, the U.S. National Park Service excavated the foundations of George 
Washington’s 1790s house in Philadelphia. That city was then the nation’s 
capital, so this presidential home was like the White House. Archaeologists 
uncovered a large basement not indicated in the historic records, as well as 
outlines of an early version of the Oval Office. They also exposed a hidden 
underground passage designed so that slaves could move in and out of the 
house unseen by important guests. Historians knew Washington kept nine of 
his 300+ slaves in Philadelphia, even though Pennsylvania was a free state; 

271
 Chapter 15: Historic Archaeology: Reinterpreting the More Recent Past
they even knew the names of these nine. But you seldom see this part of the 
story in the history books!
Thousands of tourists and passers-by were amazed to watch what the dig 
uncovered and understand what it meant. At this spot (right next to the 
Liberty Bell and near Independence Hall), officials have to determine how 
to include this physical record of people in bondage in the planned exhibit. 
Archaeology forces a more balanced presentation of United States history.
Many other digs of slaves’ quarters and work areas are producing fascinating 
finds. Here are some examples:
 
 In the eastern U.S., plantation record books show what foods slaves 
were given, but the quantities never seem like they would have been 
sufficient for survival. Excavations of pit features at slave quarters have 
uncovered bones of less desirable parts like heads and feet of cows and 
pigs, but also bones of wild animals. This material proves that slaves 
supplemented their inadequate rations by going out and hunting to get 
enough meat and then burying the bones to avoid discovery. Sometimes 
the bone assemblages show slaves had a more nutritious diet than that 
of the white master! Lead shot and gun parts also hidden under dirt 
floors show how they hunted.
 
 Plant remains indicate slaves often grew their own gardens and collected 
wild plants, not only for food but also for medicinal needs.
 
 Root cellars were originally sub-floor pits for storing root crops, but 
they’re also filled with personal and domestic artifacts showing daily life, 
as are the dirt floors of houses and the areas outside house walls. The 
artifacts include handmade items like pottery and clay pipes; buttons of 
metal, bone, and shell; and African cowrie-shell charms and glass beads.
 
 Pits in slave-house floors from the 17th century to the Civil War may also 
have been West African-style shrines. Groupings of seemingly unrelated 
artifacts (nails, unusual bone pieces, shells, crystals, pierced coins, and 
symbols similar to African ritual markings) reflect traditional spiritual 
practices.
 
 Digs in Brazil have unearthed details of communities of runaway African 
slaves or maroons. Called quilombos, these 17th-century settlements 
escaped Portuguese and Dutch control. They developed their own 
distinctive language and culture based on African standards. Excavated 
native, European, African, and African-style artifacts such as pottery 
support historic accounts of their heroic resistance and show how they 
forged a new ethnic identity.
For another story of how slavery’s material record is expanding history, see 
the sidebar in Chapter 16 about the African burial ground site in New York.

Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
Excavating Daily Life, Historic 
Industry, and the Military
The archaeology of pioneer settlements, railroad workers, miners, tenant 
farmers, other minority groups, and ordinary folks gives life to these often-
undocumented people who built nations. Much of what we know about them 
comes from the material record, not written history. The same is true for his-
toric industrial sites and military sites from forts to battlefields — what’s in 
the ground helps reconstruct the big picture.
Daily life in society
Much historic archaeology is digging up the remains of past households to 
see details of domestic life at different times in the past. Some examples of 
what archaeologists are investigating:
 
 How newcomers settled and interacted with people who were already 
there.
 
 Trends in architectural styles that left evidence in the ground.
 
 Artifacts from distant places that show how much local residents par-
ticipated in national or international economic systems.
 
 How neighborhoods developed, including the origins of social inequali-
ties or poverty as opposed to wealthier sections of town.
 
 Evidence of gender-specific activities. Gender studies are increasingly 
important in historic archaeology. You can sometimes identify tangible 
signs of male- and female-related sites or areas in sites where each did 
different tasks. Typical female activity locations are boarding houses, 
religious communities, missions, orphanages, hospitals, and even houses 
of prostitution. Common tasks such as washing clothes or feeding 
boarders leave many distinctive artifacts like laundry tubs and bleach 
bottles or kitchen utensils and tableware.
 
 Artifacts pointing to the ethnicity of a site’s inhabitants. Ethnicity is a 
little harder to see archaeologically, as I describe in Chapter 11. Historic 
sites tend to show more when you know a little about who was there. 
The smallest artifact may indicate how traditional practices were kept or 
changed as various groups moved in and changed.
 
 Particular kinds of sites or remains that give information on illegal and 
other questionable activities. Archaeologists have excavated 19th-century 
opium dens in the western U.S. and houses of prostitution in New Orleans. 
I’ve even documented a 1930s moonshine still hidden in the Florida 
swamps.

273
 Chapter 15: Historic Archaeology: Reinterpreting the More Recent Past
 
Here are a couple examples of archaeological work that has shed some light 
on the daily life of the recent past:
 
 Studies of historic human skeletal remains indicate changing health 
patterns. Rickets (a bone-deforming vitamin D deficiency caused by 
lack of sunlight) was common among the rich in 17th- and 18th-century 
England. Wealthy folks who could lounge around indoors all day were 
more susceptible, and the poor who worked outside on farms were fine. 
But as England industrialized, this pattern changed. Skeletons from 
the 19th century show rickets was widespread among the urban poor 
because they worked indoors all day and walked where sunlight was cut 
off by tall buildings and narrow streets (not to mention the growing air 
pollution in manufacturing towns).
 
 Archaeologists knew from historic records that a mid 19th-century 
California neighborhood was occupied by Chinese miners. Excavations at 
a boarding house site unearthed Chinese artifacts but also British ceram-
ics and food remains showing standard Euro-American diets. Sites of mer-
chants’ homes produced more typical Chinese porcelain and bones of pork, 
chicken, and Asian fishes. The interpretation was that wealthier merchants 
and boarding house owners lived more traditionally but bought cheaper 
stuff like California fish and British dishes from American agents to use even 
for their Chinese lodgers and staff at the boarding house.
Industrial archaeology
Industry and technology leave lots of complex archaeological remains. 
Whether standing ruins or features in the ground, the physical evidence of old 
mills, mines, bridges, and other structures tells you the history of technology 
and engineering; it’s the heritage of the early Industrial Revolution. Here are 
some examples of what archaeologists can find:
 
 Machinery once powered by water or steam.
 
 Slag and other waste from ore processing.
 
 Waste from brick-making kilns or potteries.
 
 Ruins of railway constructions.
 
 Remnants of aqueducts, water towers, and other systems.
 
 Artifact assemblages that show social and economic processes like how 
the working classes were treated or how individual enterprise 
succeeded from small beginnings.
 
 Past industrial processes that may even reveal less wasteful technologies 
worth reexamination for their energy-saving virtues.

274
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
Industrial sites in the American East and South include many locations for 
obtaining naval stores, which were timber and other supplies for shipbuilding. 
These sites are sawmills, turpentine stills (where resin from pine trees was 
processed), and camps for workers, whose lives of labor are poorly known 
outside the archaeology of their houses.
 
Industrial archaeology explores the roots of the modern world. You can see 
change from traditional family-oriented, agriculturally-based communities 
in which everyone knew everyone else to a larger society based on market 
economics, industry efficiency, specialization, and material progress.
Military and battlefield archaeology
You’d think that the precise recorded detail required by military institutions 
would leave nothing unknown. But excavations of military sites from forts to 
battlefields fill in lots of details about strategies, events, lives and deaths.
Military sites
Archaeological investigations at military installations (any kind of camp, 
base, or support post) are growing in popularity. Such studies demonstrate 
previously unknown historic details, many of which can be valuable data 
for military historians and planners today.
Here are some examples of what archaeologists are doing at military sites:
 
 Determining whether a fort was actually constructed according to the 
historic plan in the original documents (if they were even preserved).
 
 Digging up finds at forts and other installations that show details 
of procurement (how they got supplies), construction techniques, 
locational strategies, weapons, storage, hospitals, and camp layout. 
Personal things soldiers used most of the time, when they weren’t 
fighting (like parts of clothing, musical instruments, and leisure items), 
are often in the ground as well.
 
 Seeing differences between the material conditions experienced by 
ordinary soldiers and by officers and others.
 
 Digging at prisoner-of-war camps to get insights into captivity conditions 
and daily lives of prisoners.
Battlefield survey and excavation
Battlefield archaeology is a growing field that uses metal detectors and forensic 
techniques to locate and interpret evidence. (See the following section for more 
on forensic archaeology.) You can discover information about tactics and move-
ments of units and individuals from the distributions of artifacts. Even across a 
vast landscape where conflict took place, material culture is patterned in particu-
lar ways. You see what happened from the viewpoint of the individuals fighting.

275
 Chapter 15: Historic Archaeology: Reinterpreting the More Recent Past
Battlefield sites from the U.S. Civil War, World War II, and even older conflicts 
in Europe back to the Roman Empire are all giving up archaeological secrets.
 
You may have heard the story of General Custer and his 7th Cavalry at the 
Battle of the Little Bighorn in Montana in 1876. The Lakota and Cheyenne 
Indians won overwhelmingly, but now archaeology has corrected some 
details. Finds uncovered include army equipment, different bullets from 
army and Native American guns, metal arrowheads, spent cartridges, cloth-
ing and personal items, and even skeletons of the horses that died in the 
fight. Ballistics and other firearms and weapons studies show that the Native 
Americans actually outnumbered, outgunned, and outstrategized Custer. 
Human bones provided information on individual victims and indicated that 
the lives of soldiers in general were pretty rough — they had bad teeth and 
used lots of coffee and tobacco. One victim was identified as a mixed white-
Sioux civilian scout for Custer who had warned the general not to fight.
Understanding Modern Society 
and Behavior from Artifacts
The archaeological method — examining human behavior from the starting 
point of the artifact itself — gives you lots of otherwise unknown knowledge 
about your own society. Looking at the stuff people have and how and where 
they use it is a way of finding out information about consumer choices and 
other behavior you just can’t get from sociology studies or market surveys. 
In Chapter 2, I describe how garbology, the archaeology of modern household 
garbage and landfills, provides previously unimagined knowledge of economic 
systems, waste, and spending.
In the following sections, I give you some other examples of how archaeologi-
cal research is useful today to solve crimes, market products, and understand 
what people really do with their material possessions.
Forensic archaeology
Forensic archaeology studies material evidence at crime scenes for legal 
investigation. As I detail in Chapter 3, it involves the meticulous archaeological 
methods of mapping, excavating, and analyzing the distributions of objects 
to figure out what happened. You discover hidden stories and details of the 
nastier side of society. With forensic biological anthropologists (who analyze 
human bones) and other specialists, you study everything from individual 
victims’ burials or sites of violence to mass graves resulting from genocide. 
Even mapping blood spatters is archaeology! So is using luminol on the 
artifacts. Luminol is a chemical that shows traces of blood invisible to the 

276
Part IV: Archaeology Reconstructs the Whole Human Past 
naked eye (you’ve seen this on crime-scene shows); it makes them glow in the 
dark, even years later and after burial. (Just for fun, I’ve tested it with my own 
blood!)
Radios and cars as artifacts
Two famous studies of everyday items establish archaeology as a different 
method for understanding consumer behavior and business strategies 
of  Western culture. Economic historians say Japanese manufacturing 
and marketing genius overtook America’s in consumer electronics by the 
mid-20th century. But examination of the types of old radios, as well as 
original company documents, tells a contradictory story through historic 
archaeology.
The portable radio was actually invented and first made in America. But 
sophisticated adults weren’t enthusiastic about its tinny sound or appear-
ance as a toy or novelty item. The Japanese, also interested in miniaturiza-
tion, then took up production of them and succeeded enormously — not 
due to their creativity, but to an accident of timing. The late 1950s saw the 
emergence of rock-and-roll and a sudden emphasis on youth and mobility. 
The cheap, shirt-pocket transistor radio became crucial for teen culture and 
was a hit. The sudden popularity of the artifact shows the picture of culture 
change and social transformation.
Another archaeological study documents the interaction of people and 
artifacts in the case of the electric car. Traditional economic history says that 
many types of self-propelled vehicles emerged in about 1900, but gasoline 
power was clearly superior to steam or electricity. Examination of the cars 
themselves gives you other perspectives — the story becomes one of the 
archaeology of gender and class. Early electric cars were clean, quiet, simple, 
and convenient for short hops around town. They were perfect for doctors, 
salesmen, and especially women (who were typically the errand-runners). 
Gasoline-powered vehicles were expensive, unreliable, noisy, and stinky, and 
you had to get out in the mud to crank them up. But they were fast and went 
a lot farther before refueling — just what farmers far from town, wealthy 
tourists, and men in general wanted. Gasoline prevailed, but now that electric 
cars are returning for reasons of energy conservation, saving the planet, and 
gas prices, electricity may have the last laugh.
Archaeology of cellphones 
and communication
A 2007 study used archaeological methods to get information on cellphone 
distribution and use (by culture, gender, and other social categories) previ-
ously unknown to the industry’s engineering and marketing folks. More men 

277
 Chapter 15: Historic Archaeology: Reinterpreting the More Recent Past
carry phones in pockets, and more women have them in purses (resulting in 
more missed calls for women). Belt pouches for men are popular in China but 
not as popular in Japan or Italy. In general, people in Asia seem to love phone 
covers, decorative straps, and hanging charms.
Much of the patterning was tied with communications strategies. Most 
cellphones are used for talking with just a few people and for last-minute 
planning and meetings; land lines are more frequently used for formal 
business and organizational functions. People tend to use text messaging 
more for intimate communications, e-mail for more official reasons and 
sending files, and instant-messaging for having the communication 
channel open while doing other things. The most frequent and advanced 
users of fancy communications technology were immigrants talking or 
sending webcam imagery to folks back home.
Archaeology of everyday 
items and technologies
Many other recent technologies can be explained very differently when you 
look at what the artifact can tell you about society. New work on the history 
of the pencil, for example, is really archaeology, demonstrating how this 
simple item reflects social transformations and economic change. Items that 
once were common in your home or workplace — floppy disks, film for cam-
eras, videotapes, cassette tapes (not to mention vinyl records, typewriters, 
or carbon paper!) — are rapidly becoming artifacts of the past that will need 
good archaeological interpretation!
 
No matter how you live or what behavior is included in your day, you interact 
with material culture at every moment. So think about what the archaeology 
of your stuff says about you.
Public drinking in the historic American West
You never know when you may find cool 
indicators of ethnicity, class, gender, or other 
social categories. A recent study compared 
results of excavations at different saloons 
operating in Virginia City, Nevada, during 
the gold- and silver-mining boom of the late 
1800s. The poorly known lives of miners were 
illuminated by finds like musical instruments, 
decanters, and Tabasco sauce bottles. A 
German-owned opera house saloon and an 
African-American establishment produced 
more elaborate furnishings and food remains 
than two other contemporaneous saloons. All 
of these places were typically considered to be 
hangouts for men, but DNA on a white clay pipe 
stem from the African-American saloon proved 
to be from a woman. Buttons and beads also 
confirmed a female presence.

Par t V
Archaeology Is 
for Everyone

In this part . . .
A
ll archaeology these days is public archaeology, so 
in Part V, I explain what all that designation includes. 
Chapter 16 defines public archaeology, heritage, and pres-
ervation of the past and shows you practical applications 
of archaeological knowledge in today’s world. Chapter 17 
lists the many ways you can get involved in learning, visiting, 
and doing archaeology. Chapter 18 describes the latest hot 
archaeological controversies and why you should care 
about them.

Chapter 16
The Uses of Archaeological 
Findings
In This Chapter
 Relating all archaeology to the public
 Interpreting archaeology with different (political) ends
 Using archaeological knowledge for practical applications
You may have the impression that archaeologists are researchers 
confined to their digs or laboratories and publishing their findings in 
obscure academic journals. But nowadays, archaeology is everywhere, and 
archaeologists have to be aware! In this chapter, I show you how everything 
you do in archaeology relates to public concerns and how different kinds 
of people and groups are interested in what you do as an archaeologist. 
Different uses of your archaeological findings can be for many, sometimes 
opposing purposes!
All Archaeology Is Public Archaeology
 
Archaeology has a duty to publicize its knowledge of the entire human past. 
You can’t just get into your trench and dig, or sequester yourself in the lab to 
piece together potsherds. Your findings have meaning in the wider world, and 
people know that!
What public archaeology is
Public archaeology includes all of the following:
 
 Any digging or investigation done with public money or support.
 
 Any archaeological investigation done in a public place, with onlookers 
and maybe even participants who are members of the public.

282
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
 
 Archaeology done with descendant communities, people related 
biologically or culturally to the past people you’re investigating.
 
 Your archaeological findings written up not only in fancy academic 
journals but also in publicly available, popular forms (books, articles, 
brochures, Web sites, pamphlets, videos, and so on).
 
 Media presentations of archaeology, from books to TV to films.
 
 Cultural resources management (CRM) archaeology, which is survey to 
locate sites, sometimes excavate them, and save the information before 
they’re destroyed by construction or other land disturbance.
 
 Community heritage archaeology, tying past people and their activities to 
present groups in the same community, related or not.
 
 Amateur or avocational archaeology, which involves people doing it for 
fun or hobby (usually with the help and supervision of professionals).
 
 Museum displays and other interpretations of the human past in general 
or at a particular place and time.
 
 Educational archaeology for schoolkids, adults, or any other groups.
 
 Heritage conservation and historic preservation, whether in lawmaking, 
lobbying, or other advocacy for preserving archaeological and historic 
sites and structures.
 
 Archaeo-tourism and community economic development — earning 
money from visitors interested in viewing local evidence of the past.
 
 Application of archaeological knowledge to modern human issues and 
problems — in other words, applied anthropology. (See Chapter 3 for 
more on applied anthropology.)
How public archaeology is 
funded and publicized
Most archaeology is funded by public money, government grants or con-
tracts. Some private foundations offer grants, and other times it’s paid for by 
private firms who need to do cultural resources management investigations 
to conform with public laws before they build something. (For more on cul-
tural resources management, check out Chapter 3.) In all cases, you report 
on your work and findings to the funding agency and also to any other inter-
ested parties.
Funding agencies
Because archaeology is labor- and equipment-intensive, most archaeologists 
write proposals to request support for their work. Lists of places to go for 
funding are in libraries and university research offices and also online. 
Potential funding sources are national and state government granting agencies, 

283
 Chapter 16: The Uses of Archaeological Findings
public and private entities that need contract archaeology done to comply 
with laws, and private foundations. Reading the agency’s mission statement 
and proposal guidelines gives you an idea of whether it’s appropriate for the 
kind of project you want to do. The key to writing a good proposal is tying your 
archaeological research to the philosophy and aims of the granting agency.
Bringing the work to the public
Always consider involving the public in your archaeological research somehow. 
Your dig volunteers and knowledgeable local residents can be enormously useful 
in excavation, lab work, and even supporting and publicizing your project. After 
the dig, it’s only fair to let everyone know how the analyses are proceeding and 
what knowledge the project produced.
 
No matter who helps you or funds you, you have the obligation to finish your 
archaeological work and make it available. Writing and other publicity for the 
general audience is just as important as your professional report. Here are 
some tips for public presentation of your archaeological research:
 
 Compose a press release to describe (properly) the details of the 
archaeological investigations and send it to local news media.
 
 Write a popular report on the project along with the professional report 
you submit to the funding agency. Some U.S. federal agencies actually 
require a popular report for big projects.
 
 Give talks at the community library, civic association, or local school on 
the archaeological work and finds.
 
 Produce a newsletter or regular bulletin showing how the laboratory 
analyses are going and what new revelations have occurred as bags of 
artifacts are processed in the lab.
 
 Create (and update) a Web site to show what’s new in the research.
 
 Include photos of volunteers, other supporters, and community people 
in all this publicity.
Recognizing Different Stakeholders 
in the Past
Many different people and groups have an interest in archaeological work. 
Here’s a partial list of who these stakeholders may be:
 
 Other archaeologists — professionals, students, and amateurs.
 
 The general public.
 
 Owners, managers, and users of the land.

284
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
 
 Descendants of the past people being studied by the archaeological 
work, including supposed or claimed descendants, even those with 
religious or mystical connections.
 
 Local residents of the area where you are doing the archaeology.
 
 People who don’t even care about archaeology but have some interest 
in the land. (See Chapter 8 for my tale of a forgotten stakeholder — the 
officials pointing out unauthorized parking for the crew’s vehicles on 
our campus dig.)
 
 People wanting to use the archaeology for other purposes, such as 
preventing construction in their neighborhood, bringing tourists and 
commerce, or identifying with the heritage of the past for traditional, 
sentimental, or political reasons.
 
 Artifact collectors, both ethical ones and unethical looters and treasure 
hunters interested in selling artifacts for private gain.
Digging up someone’s ancestors 
and traditions
 
Every archaeological project investigates someone’s ancestors’ stuff. You’re 
obliged to find out who this someone is, if at all possible. Many laws concern 
the exposure and excavation of human skeletons, but whether obliged by law 
or not, you should consult with descendant communities to make sure you’re 
doing nothing disrespectful to their human burials, sacred sites, or artifacts. 
You want to bring the knowledge of the community or ethnic group’s past to 
those there today, not trample all over it.
All archaeologists know this ethical requirement, but a few ignore it. Others 
genuinely want to do it but can’t because the remains are so ancient or 
decayed that no specific descendants are known.
Identifying people’s heritage
Archaeology is useful in identifying the heritage of a particular people. 
Sometimes the archaeological interpretation fuels ethnic pride and identity 
very nobly. Other times it can cause controversy in contested regions. Still 
other times the heritage is commercialized for profit.
 
Here are examples of archaeological documentation of a people’s heritage:
 
 In 2007, archaeologists uncovered a 2,000-year-old mansion under a parking 
lot right outside the walls of Jerusalem’s Old City. The location is now an 
Arab neighborhood in the place known as the City of David, where the poor 
once lived. Jewish texts mention one wealthy family there: that of Queen 

285
 Chapter 16: The Uses of Archaeological Findings
Helene of Adiabene. The family had ruled a region in Iraq (Adiabene) before 
they came to Jerusalem, converted to Judaism, and helped the poor. Their 
home was destroyed, along with the rest of the city, when the Romans put 
down a Jewish revolt in A.D. 70. The size and luxury of the house suggest 
it was Helene’s; artifacts included pottery, stone items, and coins. The dig 
is controversial: Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 
Mideast War; some Jewish groups want control of Palestinian property in 
this neighborhood, but Palestinians want this area of the city for the capital 
of a future state.
 
 A religious congregation got archaeologists to examine the site of the first 
Anglican church in northern Virginia. The 1740 Elk Run Church, which 
was abandoned in 1806 and had its construction materials carried off for 
use elsewhere. Over several years, volunteers including Boy Scouts and 
4-H club members excavated the building’s cross-shaped foundations and 
discovered an adjacent cemetery as well. Finds included window glass, 
nails, ceramics, plaster, and brick fragments. The community wants to 
preserve the place as a historic park to show its illustrious past; after all, 
the first rector of the church was a grandfather of a U.S. Supreme Court 
justice.
 
 Any construction in Rome exposes archaeological remains in the 
ground. In 2008, digging for a much-needed subway line encountered 
important ruins all along the way. Finds from the imperial period 
included a palace and homes with kitchens containing pots and pans. 
Archaeologists also uncovered Roman tombs, a 6th-century copper 
factory, 8th-century pavements, and a bit of a famous medieval road. 
Conservation laws ended up delaying the subway project, but what’s 
saved (or uncovered, documented, and then either destroyed or 
reburied) is far more than ever before. Most construction in Rome has 
destroyed its past evidence. Medieval folks mined Roman ruins for 
blocks to make their own houses. Building the first subway in 1937, 
Mussolini’s workers obliterated many famous ruins and carted away 
untold amounts of relics to dumps.
Finding the excluded past
Sometimes community heritage has been deliberately lost, excluded, or 
stifled. Archaeology can recover this heritage by unearthing the tangible 
evidence of ethnic and national traditions. Material culture can document a 
people who’ve been discriminated against or stuck in a category based on 
their physical appearance or ethnic or religious background.
 
A recent dig in Warsaw, Poland, uncovered the remains of the famous Saxon 
Palace. Originally the 17th-century home of a court official, it was expanded by 
a Polish king in the 18th century and enlarged again in the 1830s by a Russian 
merchant. The palace became a Nazi headquarters when the Germans took 
over Poland before World War II, and it was then blown up in 1944 by the 
retreating German army (who’d also destroyed most of the rest of the city 

286
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
without regard for the historic record lost in the process). Now it’s producing 
amazing archaeological finds from all these time periods. Artifacts include 
everyday items like tiles and pottery and valuables like sculptures and even 
a 19th-century diamond ring dug out of a toilet! Nazi-era discoveries included 
helmets and even dangerous unexploded artillery, as well as a surprising 
secret tunnel connecting the building’s wings. A basement casino had artifacts 
like wine corks, bar receipts, and even betting slips.
Once a center from which invaders had crushed Polish independence, the 
palace is now an important national symbol. It will be rebuilt to house 
the city government and archaeological displays, restoring pride in Polish 
Slaves in New York: The African burial ground
The site of a planned 34-story federal office 
building in New York City became the center of 
a public archaeology controversy in the 1990s. 
Old city maps showed a mid-18th-century 
“Negro Burial Ground” at this location outside 
the boundaries of New Amsterdam, the Dutch 
town that later became New York. The first 
archaeologists hired to investigate thought 
there’d be nothing left of this cemetery after 
two centuries of development and land filling, 
but problems arose when more digging exposed 
many burials, and a backhoe even destroyed 
some skeletons. People criticized the original 
inadequate research design and the lack of 
communication with the African-American 
community descended from the people buried 
there. Many thought it was disrespectful to 
dig up graves, and black communities, the first 
African-American mayor of New York, and other 
politicians pressured for changes in strategy. 
Eventually, over 400 burials were excavated 
(and an estimated 200 graves probably remain in 
the area around Broadway all the way down to 
City Hall). The whole cemetery was estimated to 
stretch over six city blocks and contains about 
20,000 people (both slaves and free blacks) 
buried from the 1690s to 1790s. (New York didn’t 
abolish slavery until 1827.) Construction of the 
building was halted in order to dig and preserve 
the remains and redesign the planned building 
to include a memorial center.
No tombstones or other records exist for the 
dead, but the skeletons and other evidence 
show all were Africans. Artifacts include beads 
of glass, amber, and cowrie shells, as well as 
a few decorated coffins, one with an African 
symbol. The bones show signs that these people 
performed very hard labor. One skeleton had a 
musket ball lodged in the ribs.
The National Park Service declared the area 
a historic landmark, and the visitor center 
has displays for the public to learn about this 
hidden dimension of history. These remains of 
New York’s ancestral African community were 
reburied with solemn rites to commemorate 
their sad stories, as many dignitaries and 
thousands of people attended the ceremonies. 
Some artifacts around the burials were 
replicated for the display, with the originals 
reburied in the coffins. Archaeologists learned 
an important lesson — you need dialogue with 
everyone affected by the past! The public got 
other lessons. You never learn in your school 
history books that New York had the second-
largest enslaved population (after South 
Carolina) in the early 1800s, and that early New 
York was built by those slaves.

287
 Chapter 16: The Uses of Archaeological Findings
tradition and identity. Emotional attachment to the site is so great that prom-
inent people of opposing political views all want to protect it and benefit 
from the archaeology.
Archaeology reconstructs hundreds of thousands of years of prehistory and 
historic times for everyone. Most archaeologists understand and comply with 
laws protecting skeletal remains and graves. A few cases have garnered huge 
publicity because something went wrong in the process of trying to respect 
the multiple views and often opposing political uses of the past.
Archaeology’s Political Nature
 
The different stakeholders listed in the preceding sections may have conflict-
ing aims. Different groups may claim they should control the excavation and 
interpretation of the archaeological record, not to mention the artifacts and 
other finds.
Finding out who’s interested
Most archaeologists understand the political nature of the past and make 
efforts to locate anyone with an interest in what’s being dug up. Sometimes 
you forget or don’t know about particular groups, or you just don’t realize 
the full implications of the research. Some arguments can be resolved by just 
sitting down for a conversation with everyone involved. Other controversies 
remain for decades or centuries, such as the dispute over who should have 
the Elgin marbles from Greece, now in the British Museum. (See Chapter 2 for 
the story on these artifacts.)
Taking authenticity and 
value into account
Sometimes just preserving something gives it value and makes it useful 
in various arguments; it can even generate economic gain. But standards 
of authenticity aren’t valid for all times and cultures. Restoring ruins may 
damage the original traces, and reconstruction may destroy authenticity.
The arguments over who owns the past, what is the reality of the past, and 
who controls archaeological remains are constant, whether the subject is a 
standing building or a custom of your ancestors. (I’ve seen fights over whose 
cookie recipe is closest to grandma’s original family tradition.) So when you 
do archaeology, you have to anticipate these disagreements.

Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
Changing meanings of the past
Just like history keeps getting revised with new, sometimes contradictory 
analyses, archaeology and its finds continually change in meaning. You see 
deliberate attempts to manipulate the past, retell the story differently, and 
invent new traditions or claims to power by association with powerful sites, 
graves, and artifacts, regardless of whether they have any real connection.
 
You often get destruction right along with preservation. An Italian restaurant 
whose main counter is a piece of a 2,000-year-old Roman column is both paying 
homage to the past and aiding in its destruction by making it desirable to use 
pieces of the ancient artifacts in the present.
Interpretations of Stonehenge (shown back in Figure 13-5) have changed 
dramatically over the years, because of new archaeology but also because of 
people wanting to be part of its mystery and symbolism. It was a gathering 
place and monument aligned with the summer sun, built between 3,000 and 
1,500 B.C., but it changed in function and meaning over time. Peoples of later 
centuries had the existing circle of standing stones as an already-ancient 
monument and made their own physical additions and added meanings. Today 
New-Agers, hippies, pyramid-power folks, drug dealers, neo-Druids, and 
families on holiday all gather there at the summer solstice, each finding some 
connection with the powerful, visible past (and leaving new material remains 
of garbage). One archaeologist (jokingly) suggested that Stonehenge’s 
configuration could even make it a space ship landing pad as well!
 
Archaeology provides details not found in the photos, written records, or oral 
traditions of a community or ethnic group. Whether archaeological information 
contradicts these other sources or supports them, it gives additional voice to 
the people of the past, which can serve many purposes.
Collecting, Looting, and Selling Artifacts
Some types of stakeholders in the past are those who collect artifacts, sometimes 
for fun and with ethical concerns, and sometimes for the profit in selling to the 
highest bidder.
Ethical collectors
Avocational or amateur archaeologists usually collect on their land or in their 
own region to identify with the past there. Many are hunters and fishers who 
use the landscape as past people may have. Some even make their own stone 
tools and other craft items. Good collectors keep track of the provenience 
(location and other information) of their finds and work with professionals to 

289
 Chapter 16: The Uses of Archaeological Findings
document sites. They show you where their artifacts came from and allow you 
to take photographs. Like amateur astronomers discovering a new planet or 
comet, avocational archaeologists help advance archaeological knowledge.
Treasure hunting and looting
Pothunters or looters are undesirable types of collectors after artifacts for 
personal gain; they don’t really care where anything came from or what it 
can reveal about past societies. They just want the relics to have or to sell 
for profit. This includes everyone from arrowhead hunters to underwater 
archaeology companies searching for treasure and wealth. They ignore 
(or worse, destroy) the scientifically priceless archaeological context to 
get some monetarily valuable objects. Chapter 2 discusses the differences 
between these folks and actual archaeologists.
 
Real archaeologists don’t buy or sell artifacts. They consider this behavior 
highly unethical, just like a good surgeon wouldn’t buy and sell kidneys or 
livers for profit. Archaeological resources belong to everyone.
A few archaeologists think that laws against looting (described in “Antiquities 
markets and laws” later in the chapter) are about as effective as drug laws or the 
prohibition of alcohol: People are going to do it anyway, so why not legalize it 
and then regulate and tax it? But artifacts are not drugs — they’re non-renewable 
resources. After you damage or destroy an archaeological site, the record of the 
past there is lost forever.
Using reproductions to prevent looting
Many collectors are happy with reproductions of ancient and beautiful artifacts. I 
love buying these items at museum shops — they’re useful for teaching but also 
lovely to display. And because they’re copies, you don’t have to worry if they get 
chipped or broken! You can also get archaeological replicas in fun formats like 
toys, postcards, and games; little kits let you excavate tiny buried pyramids or 
artifacts.
 
A few archaeologists say the market should be flooded with fakes to help 
conserve the real items. Others say copies can never replace the feelings of 
authenticity provided by the real things. But views of authenticity and value 
change. Many artifacts (like all those crystal skulls I mention in Chapter 2) 
have garnered huge prices only to be proven as modern frauds. And many 
artists’ best works were completely unappreciated until they suddenly 
became fashionable and only then sold for record high amounts at auction.
Educating the public about looting
Many souvenir-hunters don’t realize they’re irreparably damaging the past. 
My own brother went on a Caribbean diving vacation and brought back a 
plate he’d grabbed from a shipwreck. As he proudly showed it to me, my 

290
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
horrified look made him say, “What’s wrong? I only took one thing, and it’s 
just a plain dish. You’re an archaeologist — you should love this!” I had to 
explain that what he did was plundering and get him to think about what 
would happen if everyone did it. Many people are just not aware (or aren’t 
willing to see) the consequences of their actions. Fortunately, archaeological 
and historic sites, parks and monuments, museums and kids’ camps are all 
beginning to teach the public to be enlightened stewards of their own human 
heritage and not damage the material remains of the past.
The disputed bones of Kennewick Man
Need more proof that you’re better off to 
consult with all interested parties in advance? 
The following incident is a pretty good example 
of how not to do archaeology:
A human skeleton discovered near Kennewick, 
Washington, in 1996 became the subject of 
controversy and a legal challenge to the Native 
American Graves Protection and Repatriation 
Act (NAGPRA). Under this law, jurisdiction 
over ancient remains not clearly related to 
living native groups is hard to determine. The 
so-called Kennewick Man skeleton was thought 
to be of a Native American; a bone fragment 
was radiocarbon-dated to over 9,000 years of 
age, and a stone spear point was stuck in a hip 
bone. One anthropologist claimed the skeleton 
looked “Caucasian,” which was interpreted to 
mean “white”; other experts said the bones 
appeared closest to those of ancient people 
in northern Japan. Five different Indian tribal 
groups claimed descent from the skeleton, as 
did a group of California white people claiming 
to follow an old Viking religion. The Indians 
wanted the skeleton for reburial, but 
archaeologists wanted to study it first because 
so far they know little about people of such 
ancient times in North America. Some Native 
Americans said their religious beliefs both 
prevented study of the bones and proved that 
they’d always lived in that region. Scientists and 
one tribe went to court to gain control over the 
bones; a U.S. Appeals court finally ruled that 
these Indians didn’t have a clear relationship 
with remains that old. The controversy became 
so heated that the federal government agency 
controlling the land buried the site in loads 
of dirt to prevent further investigation. Some 
scientific studies of the bones continued, but DNA 
recovery is proving difficult. The controversy 
and legal actions continue, and the skeleton 
sits locked in a museum.
Many books, articles, and Web sites on the 
Kennewick case show the continuing dispute 
boils down to a few clear arguments: Scientists 
say that study of the bones has benefits for all, 
and that the skeleton may show little biological 
relationship with modern Native Americans, 
but it can help determine the process of 
colonization of the New World from Asia. Native 
American groups say that their oral histories 
document how they’ve been in North America 
for thousands of years and that the skeleton 
is their ancestor because it’s from their land. 
Scientific study is disrespectful and a violation of 
their religious beliefs, and they want immediate 
reburial. Watch for new legislative action or 
scientific information related to the Kennewick 
case in the near future.

291
 Chapter 16: The Uses of Archaeological Findings
 
I like the slogan used to protect endangered species of flowers or other things 
in parks because it’s equally applicable to visiting archaeological sites: “Take 
nothing but photos; leave nothing but footprints.”
Antiquities markets and laws
Most countries have national laws and international agreements that prevent 
importing or exporting antiquities (archaeological artifacts). The strongest 
international document, signed by over 90 countries (including the U.S. and 
Britain), is the “Means of Prohibiting the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of 
Ownership of Cultural Property” from the 1970 United Nations Environmental, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention. This agreement 
allows member nations to recover stolen or illegally exported antiquities from 
other member nations. Many states and smaller government entities also 
have antiquities regulations, as well as laws against disturbing human skeletal 
remains and graves.
The UNESCO Convention agreement and other such declarations have 
helped curb some of the trade in artifacts, but these rules are very hard 
to enforce and have different interpretations in different places. Most are 
later 20th-century rules and do permit traffic in specimens obtained over 
50 or 100 years ago (which covers most of the looted artifacts in most of 
the world’s museums). Luckily, well-meaning collectors, museum staff, and 
archaeologists are realizing that selling the material items from the past 
means destroying the sites and the human story, of which very little is left.
 
Combating the desire to collect and own unique ancient treasures is difficult. 
Art dealers, auction houses, and wealthy collectors lobby against historic 
preservationists and archaeologists (and those groups’ lobbyists) to influence 
legislation. 
Relating the Archaeological 
Story to the Present
You want to see how people lived in the past, not only to contribute to 
archaeological knowledge but also to preserve what’s been discovered and 
discover more about human nature — your own heritage! Scientific and 
humanistic knowledge is valuable for its own sake, of course, in expanding 
intellectual frontiers. But you can also derive very practical lessons from 
archaeology’s finds: ideas to help deal with issues in the modern world.

292
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
Saving the past for the future
A huge part of public archaeology is conservation of sites, artifacts and other 
materials, and records. This process is laborious, time-consuming, expensive, 
and difficult (for some details, see my discussion of curation and collections 
management in Chapter 9). But it’s necessary work if you’re going to have 
the resources to study! Archaeologists may team up with heritage specialists, 
legal experts in cultural properties, legislators, and preservationists to try to 
save threatened sites.
Why save or dig more when so much is excavated and known already? 
Actually, most of the human past is a big mystery. And science develops new 
questions as it answers others. Think of how much more you know now that 
radiocarbon dating, trace element and DNA analyses are possible. Much of 
the lost human record can be recovered.
Telling the human drama of the past
 
Your archaeological reconstructions telling the drama of how earlier people 
dealt with various problems faced by any human group is often very moving. 
Readers can identify with both great tragedies (such as a natural disaster like 
the volcanic eruptions at Pompeii) and everyday issues (such as how to get 
food, water, love, and devotion).
Israeli–Palestinian peace through archaeology?
In April 2008, a team of Israeli, Palestinian, and 
American archaeologists announced a landmark 
agreement concerning archaeological sites 
and remains; they hoped this document could 
be part of a Middle East peace process. They’d 
worked in secret for five years to try to protect 
some 6,000 archaeological sites and thousands 
of artifacts in the area of the West Bank and 
East Jerusalem.
Amid all the enormous conflict and political 
disputes existing since long before Israel 
occupied those territories in 1967, they wanted to 
cooperate to protect the past that’s so important 
to all parties today, as well as to the rest of 
the world. The sites (and collections already 
excavated from them) contain evidence of 
many different archaeological cultures over 
thousands of years. But claims of ownership 
or control of physical space and objects have 
seriously hampered scientific study. For Jews, 
the material remains establish Jewish claims 
and history; for the Palestinians, they are stolen 
property.
Some thoughtful critics say a better accord 
would change the ideological foundations 
of nationalist archaeology. But perhaps any 
compromise will help recognize a shared 
archaeological heritage in this region and make 
a contribution in the wider political arena.

293
 Chapter 16: The Uses of Archaeological Findings
Enjoying the connection with the past
In many countries you can’t go anywhere without seeing a reference to the 
glorious past known through archaeology. Though an obvious one, Italy 
isn’t the only example (although of course Roman stuff is everywhere). But 
many nations feature ruins and artifacts on their currency, stamps, flags, and 
designs of public buildings. They often take a fierce pride in these relics. For 
example, the ancient temple at Angkor Wat is a national symbol of Cambodia. 
Its picture has been on the country’s flag for nearly 150 years, and it’s also on 
the currency. In 2003, riots erupted in response to a false rumor that a Thai 
celebrity had claimed Angkor once belonged to Thailand! (See Chapters 14 
and 20 for more on Angkor Wat.)
In the U.S., regional establishments sometimes feature connections with the 
Native American past, and government buildings or banks may hearken back 
to classical Roman or Greek styles. Immigrant groups may bring some of their 
heritage for entertainment and education too. And museums exhibit the glo-
ries of many ancient cultures.
In Color Figure 16, I show you a fun combination of artifact replicas that serve 
public archaeology well. After seeing the traveling exhibit of King Tut’s trea-
sures when it came to Florida, I had to buy an inflatable Egyptian mummy 
doll in the gift shop. Then I carried it with me as our group went into a 
Mexican restaurant in Fort Lauderdale that celebrated its heritage with repro-
ductions of Olmec heads on the walls. The combination of plastic Egypt and 
plaster Mexico of the past was too colorful a celebration of different ancient 
traditions not to photograph!
Practical Applications of Archaeology
In all the knowledge archaeology produces about everything from daily life to 
the regimes of kings, you can find useful tidbits everywhere. Findings about 
what past human systems worked (or didn’t work) have valuable practical 
uses today. Details of ethnic, community, or national heritage and tradition 
are useful in expanding identity and pride in the past, as well as gaining politi-
cal power and support. Forensic archaeology gives real knowledge of crime 
scenes and of mass graves from war and genocide and scenes of natural and 
human disasters.
Past technologies can be valuable too: If you happen to survive a nuclear 
holocaust, you’ll be much better off if you know some archaeology and can 
make a few stone tools and net bags!

294
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
Human-environment interaction
Probably the biggest contribution of archaeology to modern society is the 
information on how humans affected their environments and were affected 
by them over the long and very long term.
Getting along in different regions
Archaeological remains show you daily details of how people used available 
natural resources in different regions and learned to live in deserts, moun-
tains, wetlands, and even the frozen north. You see how they perfected tech-
niques for obtaining plants and animals and in many places came to produce 
their own food. You also see failures. For example, according to their archae-
ological remains, medieval Vikings who settled Greenland continued to live 
as Europeans, keeping their traditional foods (grains, cattle, goats, sheep) 
and clothes (wool) rather than adapting Arctic native ways (eating the abun-
dant seafood and wearing warmer furs). They did well while the climate was 
favorable, but the colony died out when it got colder.
Climate change and natural disasters
A valuable process that’s very visible in the archaeological record is the 
ability of humans to adapt (or not) to changing natural environments. In 
Chapter 13, I describe how the first massive global warming at the end of the 
Archaeology and warfare
Warfare is one of the hardest situations for 
protecting archaeological resources; you’re 
thinking of human lives, not ancient sites and 
artifacts. But the heritage of war-torn countries 
takes a real beating, especially when looting 
goes unchecked.
Operation Iraqi Freedom resulted in thefts of 
tens of thousands of artifacts from both the dis-
play galleries and the storerooms in the National 
Museum of Antiquities in Baghdad. Huge stone 
sculptures, clay tablets, and many famous 
pieces pictured in archaeology books for 
decades were gone. Even databases were taken 
or damaged, so nobody could fully document 
the extent of the losses. The world reaction 
was outrage; not only were these artifacts the 
cultural heritage of the Iraqi people, but they 
were also the Mesopotamian foundations of 
Western civilization. Public media attention 
and Internet stories, including photos of the 
items taken, resulted in thwarting antiquities 
smugglers in many countries. About half the 
artifacts have been returned.
In early 2008, for example, Syria returned over 
700 specimens, from pots to gold necklaces, to 
the Baghdad Museum, with great ceremony. 
Other artifacts were actually still in Iraq, where 
they’d been secretly hidden away to prevent 
just such treasure hunting. The loss is still 
great, but it’s actually minimal compared to the 
destruction still being perpetrated by looters 
with pickaxes around the Iraqi countryside at 
archaeological sites, including many that are 
unexcavated or not even documented.

295
 Chapter 16: The Uses of Archaeological Findings
Pleistocene (Ice Age) led to changes in human hunting, probable increase in 
fishing, and eventually domestication and control of plants and animals.
How people got along in different ecosystems also includes how they reacted 
to earthquakes, storms, volcanoes, or other disasters that destroyed both the 
natural and built environment. Some societies failed completely or abandoned 
the region after a disaster. Others survived, rebuilt, and carried on in the old 
and sometimes new ways. Volcanic-ash-covered Pompeii (discussed in Chapter 
15) is one example, but archaeology provides countless others. Archaeologists 
in Arkansas are now researching large soil features that indicate big earth-
quakes at different prehistoric times, and linear sand-filled cracks from smaller 
quakes. Combining this geological evidence with the artifact finds and cultural 
features, they can reconstruct how human settlement changed over centuries 
in response to these disasters.
Human-made environmental damage
Archaeology demonstrates human impacts on environments, both 
destruction of ecosystems and how long it took for the natural resources 
to recover. You also see how people manipulated environmental resources, 
or harvested them in a sustainable fashion over the long term. Sometimes 
exploitation of different abundant materials allowed a culture to prosper for 
a time but perhaps led to a crash later. In Chapter 14, I describe the Indus 
Valley civilization, which thrived for centuries before disappearing around 
1800 B.C. One suspected cause of its demise is the massive deforestation 
needed to fuel the ovens baking the millions of bricks required to build its 
cities. Sustainability studies, “green” construction design, and alternative 
energy research (all now the rage worldwide) draw from archaeological 
knowledge of how past people did things efficiently or wastefully.
The development and use 
of past technologies
Ancient and more recent historic technologies usable and desirable in 
the modern world are rediscovered in the archaeological evidence. These 
include ways of producing renewable energy through wind and water 
power, or making cool houses out of mud or adobe in hot climates. Also 
important are techniques of artifact manufacture in stone, bone, fiber, and 
other natural materials. Scientists are even investigating the lost, com-
plex processes of producing medieval iron, steel, and other artifacts from 
archaeological digs. A recent materials study of the building blocks used 
to construct great pyramids of Egypt indicates that not all were carved 
limestone, which required great labor with only copper tools. Some appear 
to be of cast concrete that was easily transportable and poured on-site. 
The recipe of limestone particles mixed with silica-rich binder indicates 
Egyptians may have invented a cheap and non-polluting process for making 
long-lasting concrete.

296
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
Archaeology provides rich information on how a society’s waste is dis-
posed of and what it does to the landscape over the long term. In Chapter 
2, I describe the archaeological digs into modern garbage dumps that show 
what’s really disposable and degradable. In the ancient Mediterranean, 
archaeologists and other scientists have shown that Roman lead mining and 
metals industries produced a large amount of pollution 2,000 years before 
the Industrial Revolution. Lead was important for medicines, pots and pans, 
water pipes, even cosmetics, but it left its harmful traces both in soils and in 
human skeletons.
Prehistoric South American agriculture today
Prehistoric Peruvians had greater agricultural 
production than their modern descendants. 
They built canals and irrigation systems that 
brought water from mountain rivers far into 
the western desert coast. The systems lasted 
for centuries but were defeated not only 
by earthquakes, but also by slow tectonic 
movements of the ground that continually 
damaged the canals, even made them run uphill. 
Such damage apparently caused agricultural 
collapse that helped bring down prehistoric 
political regimes. While modern governments 
take pride in reusing ancient canals, they should 
heed the archaeological lesson that the Andes, 
young, continually rising mountains, may defeat 
these systems again.
On the other side of the Andes in northeastern 
Bolivia, archaeological discoveries are helping 
to promote sustainable agriculture. The tropical 
lowlands are either covered in water during 
the rainy season or parched in the dry season, 
seemingly not good for farming. But aerial 
photos showed a pattern of raised rectangular 
fields, now mostly filled in over the centuries. 
Archaeological excavation uncovered a 
system of canals and elevated plots where 
native people grew crops for over a thousand 
years, from 100 B.C. to A.D. 1100. Using experi-
mental archaeology (discussed in Chapter 11), 
researchers dug out canals, piling nutrient-rich 
muck on the elevated plots. They worked with 
local farmers to grow corn, beans, manioc, and 
other crops. Archaeologists found similar long-
abandoned raised fields in the highland plateau 
of Bolivia and Peru, around Lake Titicaca. 
These vast water-management systems once 
produced large agricultural yields to support 
great pre-Columbian civilizations. Excavation of 
the platforms and canals was accompanied by 
experimental archaeology here too. Scientists 
demonstrated that the canals next to the raised 
plots stored solar heat, kept the planted plots 
warmer, and prevented potato crops from 
destruction during a hard freeze. 
Farmers today are now using these forgotten 
systems of indigenous knowledge in both areas. 
They require only simple tools and a modest 
investment in rural development, providing good 
economic support in these very poor regions.

In This Chapter
 Finding an archaeological organization
 Participating in digs
 Becoming a professional archaeologist
I
n this chapter, I show you many ways you can get involved in archaeology. 
One option is to become a real archaeologist yourself (which requires years 
of really hard work). But you can also get an informal archaeology education, 
volunteer for digs, and more. After you dive in, you may find even more 
archaeology out there than you’ll be able to absorb.
Taking Archaeology Courses
Learning in person from a professional archaeologist is fun because you can 
get first-hand real-world information, ask questions, and even challenge 
interpretations. The following sections describe a few of the different routes 
you can take depending on your level of interest or amount of free time.
Lectures and short classes
You can hear professional archaeology lectures at museums and universities, 
local libraries, and even community centers that emphasize lifelong learning. 
Checking out these institutions and their scheduled programs is as easy as 
looking around your community, online, or in the phone book.

298
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
For a lengthier (but still short-term) option, consider week-long workshops 
or seasonal training programs in archaeology; these offerings usually include 
lectures in the classroom as well as digging. The following list gives you some 
examples of these programs:
 
 Week-long archaeology camps for kids or adults may be offered at 
museums in the summer.
 
 Scouting groups have some archaeology programs, like the Boy Scouts’ 
merit badge in archaeology.
 
 Elderhostel programs for older folks usually include background lectures 
and field trips to see archaeology.
 
 Universities may have short-course offerings (right in there with piano 
lessons and conversational Spanish) for anyone who isn’t a regular 
student enrolled for a degree.
 
 Land management agencies or your State Historic Preservation Office 
may have courses on cultural resources like archaeological and historic 
sites or short volunteer digs.
College archaeology courses
You can find full-fledged courses in archaeology at universities, colleges, 
some community and junior colleges, extended learning programs for adults, 
and various other places. You don’t have to be a degree-seeking student to 
take a course — universities may even allow older people over a certain age 
to audit courses (attend classes without receiving credits) for free.
 
I enjoy having lots of different kinds of people in my classes — the diversity 
makes discussion more interesting because more kinds of opinions are involved. 
I sometimes let people sit in if I have room, even if they aren’t registered through 
the university (don’t tell my deans). And these folks often take more courses for 
credit later. I’ve even had retired folks who took a course for fun and then came 
back to enroll and earn bachelor’s and even master’s degrees.
College courses in archaeological method and theory, prehistory and 
historic archaeology, and historic preservation are valuable background for 
professionals in so many other fields. Here’s why:
 
 You can discover something about your human heritage.
 
 You can get some practical information possibly directly applicable in 
your profession or everyday life.

299
 Chapter 17: How You Can Explore Archaeology
Joining Archaeological Associations
Archaeological associations, societies, and clubs are everywhere. Some are 
national and international, but many are regional or based in a particular 
state and have smaller local chapters. Members are students, professionals, 
amateur archaeologists — really, anyone who’s interested. Most require only 
the membership fee, which typically gets you a regular publication like a 
magazine along with information on new discoveries, activities you can 
participate in, and opportunities to join digs. Look for these online.
 
Be wary of looter or pothunter groups interested only in digging, collecting, 
buying, and selling rather than in preserving or carefully investigating the 
past. Most reputable organizations will have a code of ethics.
From international to local groups
Here are some good groups you can join (check their Web sites):
 
 Archaeological Institute of America (AIA), which sends you 
Archaeology magazine with your membership. You can also join local 
AIA chapters, which sponsor lecture programs and other events.
 
 World Archaeological Congress, which covers the globe and emphasizes 
professional and public archaeology and indigenous peoples’ rights. It has 
an online newsletter and discussion forum that often highlights ethical 
dilemmas.
 
 Society for American Archaeology (SAA), which is for professionals but 
allows anyone to join, attend meetings, and receive the journal.
 
 National archaeological societies, in many countries and languages.
 
 Regional societies such as the Southeastern Archaeological Conference 
and Plains Anthropological Society, which all have annual meetings you 
can attend and regular journals for members.
 
 State societies, which also offer annual meetings, journals, and some-
times booths at the state fair! More amateurs and lay people are usually 
members of these groups, but also professionals and students. 
 
 Local clubs or chapters of the state society, which (like the others) usually 
have a mix of members, a newsletter, and often monthly meetings and 
various activities (lectures, digs).

Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
Professional groups
Some archaeological groups are only for professionals. You usually have 
to fill out an application, meet training qualifications, and pay a fee to be 
a member. Most of the time you need at least a master’s degree. But these 
groups often have Web sites anyone can access, explaining great archaeology 
and new discoveries. The best-known of these societies:
 
 Register of Professional Archaeologists 
 
 State-based professional societies such as the Arizona Archaeological 
Council and the Council of Virginia Archaeologists
Public Programs and Teacher Training
Many states, associations, and museums have public “archaeology day” or 
“archaeology month” programs for the general public, and often specific 
workshops for teachers, as well as traveling programs or speakers for schools. 
Teachers can get lesson plans for bringing archaeology into their classrooms 
in many published sources and online too. A good resource is the Society 
for American Archaeology Web site’s link to their “Archaeology and Public 
Education” section. Museum shops offer artifact replicas and kids’ archaeology 
books, as well.
Volunteering or Joining Archaeological 
Digs and Laboratories
You’ll probably have a ball if you sign up for an archaeological project. 
Whether you’re in the field digging or in the lab, you see first-hand how 
archaeology operates and what level of precision is necessary to interpret 
finds. Many opportunities are volunteer, and sometimes you pay a fee for 
the experience and training. Also keep in mind that most digs that take 
volunteers require participants to be of high-school age.
Joining a local dig
You can get involved in digging in a lot of ways; joining the local archaeology 
association (see the preceding section) is usually the easiest and cheapest 
method. One of the best programs is that of the Arkansas Archeological Society. 
For two and a half weeks every June, these folks train people in excavation, 
survey, and laboratory techniques. They work with state parks and Native 

301
 Chapter 17: How You Can Explore Archaeology
American groups to provide a comprehensive experience. Then these members 
are available for other digs, such as emergency excavations to salvage a site 
being destroyed.
 
It’s getting harder to find volunteer opportunities where you don’t have to pay 
(whether because of insurance concerns, because archaeological training is so 
specialized, because training and digs require lots of supervision, or because 
supplies cost so much). Sometimes you pay living costs only, or those costs 
on top of training fees.
Volunteer archaeology with no cost to the participants does occur — even 
in some of the societies noted above. Archaeology is labor-intensive, and 
professionals really need a workforce to get things done. Many welcome 
serious volunteers with the right attitude and ethics.
 
If you go to hear a speaker who’s working on a project, ask afterwards about 
joining the project. Also, you can call universities and museums to ask if  they 
have such opportunities (often labs in winter, digs in summer — for obvious 
reasons). I’ve had volunteer high school students and retired folks on digs 
during some field seasons and in the laboratory during the school year.
Joining digs across the country or abroad
Many organizations sponsor excavations that draw people from everywhere. 
This is a great way to plan a vacation! Here’s a list of some of the best (along 
with some of their Web sites):
 
 The Passport in Time Program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
Forest Service (USDA FS in federal lingo) takes volunteers for all kinds 
of archaeological projects. Head to www.passportintime.com to get 
started.
 
 The Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) lists fieldwork oppor-
tunities, both formal field schools and volunteer projects all over the 
world that you can sign up for. Costs vary widely.
 
 The Center for American Archaeology in Kampsville, Illinois, offers 
everything from single-day opportunities to workshops for adults to digs 
open to kids, adults, and families with children as young as 7. Costs vary 
from low to high; you can find more info at www.caa-archeology.org.
 
 Crow Canyon Archaeological Center in southwestern Colorado offers short 
and long programs for high-schoolers, adults, families, and teachers. Costs 
here also vary; check out the official Web site at www.crowcanyon.org.
 
 Earthwatch Institute offers opportunities to join scientific expeditions 
of all kinds, including archaeology. Participants volunteer their time and 
pay living expenses and fees (which can be steep if you’re traveling to a 
faraway place). For information, go to www.earthwatch.org.

Becoming a Professional Archaeologist
You can spend many years joining digs and archaeology labs, really 
doing archaeology, and making contributions to the profession. But doing 
archaeology for a living requires much greater dedication!
 
You don’t do archaeology to get rich and/or famous or to experience constant 
adventure, so if those are your goals, stop right here! You have to be ready for 
the tedium, endless paperwork, and even the prospect of redoing things in a 
different way after you’ve already finished them.
Education requirements
The lowest-level archaeology jobs require at least a bachelor’s degree, usually in 
anthropology or classics, with an archaeological specialty. Courses required for 
the BA usually include all the sub-fields of anthropology, a formal archaeological 
field school, a lab course, and other science classes such as geology, biology, or 
geography. Supervisory positions usually require a master’s degree. Additional 
courses in everything from historic preservation law to GIS (geographic informa-
tion systems) and mapping techniques also enhance employment possibilities.
The most common skills archaeological employers require are these:
 
 The ability to put together a good archaeological research design.
 
 The ability to write very well.
Fancier jobs, from college professors to directors of archaeological companies 
or government programs, require a PhD with an archaeological specialty. They 
also require you to have experience so you can teach, organize research, direct 
projects and employees or students, write up research results, meet deadlines, 
and be cheerful about it all!
Job opportunities and realities
In Chapter 3, I describe all the many different kinds of archaeology you can 
do (and sometimes many kinds at the same time). In this section, I discuss 
the types of jobs you can get doing those different kinds of archaeology.
 
Most archaeology jobs don’t pay well compared with other professions. Even 
geographers, geologists, biologists, and other specialists you’d think would be 
roughly equivalent usually earn far more than archaeologists. Pay, benefits, 
and working conditions also vary by location and employer, of course.

303
 Chapter 17: How You Can Explore Archaeology
The good news is that archaeologists get that aura of romance about them 
that makes everyone else say, “Oh, I always wanted to do that!” You also get 
those rare thrills of discovery and, as a field archaeologist, good physical 
conditioning doing excavation.
Most of the archaeology jobs out there are contract archaeology work with 
private firms. Work in cultural resources management for national, state, or 
local government agencies is the next most common kind of archaeological 
occupation. Museum and academic jobs are rarer, as are jobs with private 
foundations and other non-profits.
Contract archaeology fieldworker
This job specialization is pretty well summed up by the term shovel bum. 
Requirements: usually a bachelor’s degree or sometimes an associate’s 
degree in anthropology, including field school and lab training.
Disadvantages:
 
 Lowest paying archaeological job; few or no benefits.
 
 Possibility of layoffs when work is scarce.
 
 Lots of travel to various survey and excavation projects around the state 
or country (although some think of this as an advantage).
Advantages:
 
 Usually the first to unearth exciting discoveries.
 
 (Almost) constantly doing something new and different.
 
 Experts in motel amenities.
 
 Get to do fieldwork and engage in healthy physical activity most of the 
time (unless you’re assigned to the lab or report writing).
 
 Get experience while you’re in school for an advanced archaeology 
degree, or move up to long-term employment with the company.
Contract archaeology supervisor or principal investigator
In this job, you organize and run the archaeological projects. Requirements: 
usually a master’s degree or PhD and lots of archaeological experience.
Disadvantages:
 
 Have to write proposals to bring in survey and excavation jobs.
 
 Have to write reports on finished projects and meet strict deadlines.
 
 Get to do less fieldwork because of all the writing you have to do.

304
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
Advantages:
 
 Better pay, often salary and benefits.
 
 Potential to make neat discoveries in the laboratory while processing 
the field finds (see Chapter 10 for more on lab analysis and discovery).
 
 Can organize research and extract articles from your reports to publish 
or present at professional meetings.
 
 Possibility of promotion resulting in a (rare) higher-than-average 
archaeological salary.
Government archaeologist
Jobs with federal, state, and local government entities are available in 
every state of the U.S. and in most countries (though usually you must be 
a citizen of that country). Requirements: range from bachelor’s degree to 
PhD, depending upon the position.
Disadvantages:
 
 Usually involves less fieldwork and more paperwork and regulatory 
activity (unless you like that kind of thing).
 
 Bewildering number of acronyms, official government spellings and 
procedures.
 
 May have to travel often or shift to new position or town without much 
choice.
Advantages:
 
 Usually good salary, benefits, and work hours.
 
 Get to review and participate in a great deal of archaeological research.
 
 Get to write scopes of work (directions and requirements) telling other 
archaeologists what to do on projects.
Museum or other non-profit foundation archaeologist
These jobs are rarer and often more varied. They include curator, collections 
manager, conservation specialist (who stabilizes fragile artifacts), and lab 
worker and may overlap with government jobs. Requirements: usually at least 
a bachelor’s degree and specialized training.
Disadvantages:
 
 Usually low pay and average benefits.
 
 May never get to do fieldwork (though this may be an advantage if 
you’re happy in the lab).

305
 Chapter 17: How You Can Explore Archaeology
 
 May have to spend lots of time fund-raising.
 
 May have to do other work unrelated to archaeology. (I once had to take 
care of a hurt baby bird brought in by a museum visitor because I was 
the only museum scientist at work on a Saturday.)
Advantages:
 
 Can make neat discoveries from museum collections in the laboratory or 
use the collections for your own interesting research (which is usually 
encouraged by your employer).
 
 May get to work with artifacts and neat historic documents every day.
 
 Can work with specialists in other fields (biology, geology) who are right 
there in your museum.
Academic archaeologist
You can be a professor or instructor at a university, college, or community 
college. Requirements: usually a PhD
Disadvantages:
 
 Usually pretty low pay, average benefits.
 
 Long years of study — perhaps five to eight years past bachelor’s 
degree.
 
 Fierce job competition.
 
 Whining students to teach (just kidding).
 
 Teaching and university committee requirements may leave little time 
for actual archaeological research and fieldwork.
 
 Requirements to do research and get it published to show you’re worthy of 
being tenured (guaranteed a position based on fulfillment of requirements 
and length of service).
 
 Have to write grant and contract proposals to get funding for said 
fieldwork.
 
 No job security for about five years because you’re not tenured (and 
none at all in newer universities that don’t offer tenure).
Advantages:
 
 Non-academic peers think it’s a more prestigious job. (They don’t know 
about the low pay and whining students!)
 
 Flexible work schedule.
 
 Job security if you do get tenured.

306
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
 
 Summers off to do research and digs if you can get funding and good 
students who don’t whine as much.
 
 The opportunity to teach others about the excitement of archaeology 
and mentor and train the next generation of archaeologists.
Other qualities needed to be 
a professional archaeologist
As you can see from the list of job requirements and conditions in the pre-
ceding section, being an archaeologist isn’t easy. I’ve seen some profession-
als and even students in graduate school burn out and quit; I even know of 
an archaeology professor who left his perfectly fine university job to find a 
simpler life, and he became a bus driver!
Most professionals don’t mind the stiff requirements, however, and this 
attitude is the key. 
The thrill of the find is worth it, even if it’s just the uncovering of a tiny, 
mundane artifact made centuries ago or the discovery of a great bar in your 
motel with free snacks during happy hour while you’re writing your daily 
field notes. Mostly, you’re honored that you get to be part of the continuing 
quest by humanity to understand itself — in the case of archaeology, over 
the very long term!

Chapter 18
Controversies and Sensational 
Findings
In This Chapter
 Exploring some famous archaeological discoveries
 Examining the mysteries of early peoples and migrations
 Understanding the controversial nature of many finds
A
rchaeologists argue over both the tiny details and the wider meanings 
of many of their finds. You can document the material evidence pretty 
clearly, but then you may have many different explanations for it.
In this chapter, I describe some of my favorite recent archaeological 
controversies, with opposing interpretations by different archaeologists. You 
may even see some of the controversies on the news. I also describe some 
disputes between archaeologists and others (often groups with very different 
claims on the evidence of the past).
But many other sites, artifacts, and archaeological interpretations not 
discussed in this chapter are the subject of constant argument, at least in 
professional circles, if not in the popular press. The debate is part of the 
continual self-correction of science with each new finding. It’s also part of the 
fun of archaeology — never knowing what you’re going to learn next — even 
when it changes what you already thought! Such controversies show that 
archaeologists don’t have a monopoly on their own finds. Public archaeology 
means the past is for everyone!

The Ice Man Cometh (and Other 
Archaeological Wonders)
Many archaeological investigations produce results of huge significance. 
Religious objects, traces of a lost heritage, or even an ancient human body 
itself trigger emotional responses, enormous publicity, and always con-
troversy! The following sections show you some well-known cases and the 
hubbub that surrounded them.
The Ice Man
The frozen, 5,300-year-old Italian guy who melted out of a glacier in 1991 is 
a famous European celebrity. He was discovered by hikers in the high Alps; 
they thought he was just another recent lost climber because such corpsicles 
thaw out often. But his artifacts and radiocarbon dates proved he was from 
the late Neolithic-Copper Age. He’d died in a small depression at 10,500 feet 
elevation, and he’d been quickly covered in snow and ice and freeze-dried!
Unaware of the Ice Man’s importance, authorities crudely hacked him out 
of the ice with ice axes — not the best archaeological technique! Both Italy 
and Austria claimed him until surveyors determined he was about 100 yards 
inside Italy. He was studied in Austria first then put in a special exhibition 
freezer in the South Tyrolean Archaeological Museum in Bolzano, Italy.
The man
Ötzi, as he was named (after the glacier where he was found), has been 
continuously tested and scrutinized. Here’s what scientists have learned:
 
 He was between about 40 and 50 years old (pretty old for his time!) and 
about 5 feet, 5 inches tall.
 
 DNA and mineral studies of his teeth and bones show he grew up in a 
nearby valley and later lived in another one slightly farther north, inside 
today’s Italy. He apparently spent most of his life within about a 40-mile 
area of his birthplace.
 
 Stomach contents show his last meal was 8 hours before death and 
consisted of bread, greens, and red deer meat. A wheat grain was even 
on his clothes. Before that he’d eaten ibex (wild goat). Pollen grains 
showed it was spring, and he’d just walked in a valley to the south.
 
 His lungs are black from smoke that would have filled ancient houses 
from the central hearth. He had intestinal parasites and possibly fleas.
 
 He had arthritis in his neck, back, and hip. His bones indicated he’d 
done lots of climbing.

309
 Chapter 18: Controversies and Sensational Findings
 
 Tattoos on his back and legs were in hidden places, probably not for 
display but possibly for medical or healing reasons — they roughly 
corresponded with areas that may have hurt.
 
 He had deep cuts on his hand and wrist and a stone arrowhead stuck in 
his back that was probably the cause of his death.
The artifacts
Ötzi’s gear gives archaeologists a stunning opportunity to study late 
Neolithic material culture because it includes a wealth of normally perishable 
artifacts:
 
 An unfinished bow of yew, a quiver of 14 arrows (12 unfinished), and 
bowstrings.
 
 Bone points, a needle, and two birch-bark containers.
 
 A wooden frame, also of yew, probably of a backpack. (One of its sticks 
was unwittingly used to help dig him out of the ice!)
 
 A flint knife with a wooden handle and woven sheath; other chipped-
stone tools like a scraper, an awl, and a flake; and a bone and antler tool 
for fine chipping and sharpening tools.
 
 A nearly pure copper ax hafted into a yew-wood handle with leather 
binding and birch tar (sap heated for glue).
 
 A net, perhaps for hunting.
 
 A charcoal ember and probable fire-starting kit.
 
 A piece of ibex horn and a marble pendant.
 
 Pieces of antibacterial fungus possibly used as medicine.
 
 Seven articles of clothing, including a leather loincloth, vest, and leggings; 
a belt with a pouch (that held the small tools and fungus); a deerskin coat; 
a woven-grass cape (or possibly mat); a conical skin cap with chin strap 
and fur on the inside; and skin shoes filled with grass for warmth.
Reconstruction of what happened
Every new discovery about Ötzi fueled different arguments and popular news 
stories unfolded like in a modern-day scandal investigation. He had no food 
on him, and many of his artifacts were unfinished or needing repair, but they 
were neatly laid aside. The original guess was that he was perhaps a hunter 
or lost shepherd. Then researchers discovered his wounds, so they thought 
maybe he was running from warfare in the valley below. Or he’d stolen the 
newfangled copper ax and was being pursued. Or he was a robbery victim 
killed by someone wanting the valuable ax. Or he just fell down and hit his 
head and died. Distinguishing actual wounds suffered while he was alive from 
damage inflicted on the body by poor handling during excavation is difficult.

310
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
The arrow point in his shoulder wasn’t seen until a new x-ray revealed it 
a decade after he was found, and scientists then located a matching cut 
in his clothes. Was it a murder or a hunting accident? Then DNA analysis 
showed blood of four other people on his clothes and tools. The depth of 
the arrow into his body indicates he probably bled to death, but the arrow 
shaft may have been pulled out before he died. Was he a powerful shaman 
with a fancy tool kit who was ritually murdered? Some say his remains 
demonstrate the level of constant violence in the Neolithic. Others say his 
bloodied companions may have left him sadly but peacefully to die in his 
(not so) final resting place. Still others argue over whether he was a leader 
or an outcast, or even if he was heterosexual or homosexual!
While scientists debated the various scenarios, experimental archaeologists 
duplicated Ötzi’s equipment, and a famous shoemaker even replicated his 
shoes and tried them out in the cold. Archers have tried shooting scenarios 
at different angles and distances. A few people are even arguing over who 
should be recognized as the Ice Man’s discoverer!
Meanwhile, reconstructions of what he looked like (complete with long 
stringy hair) and did (always with violence and blood) appear regularly in 
magazines and television specials. Looking for something you can take home? 
You can buy Ötzi merchandise at the Bolzano museum, or you can make like 
actor Brad Pitt and get a tattoo of the Ice Man on your arm!
More famous frozen finds
Freezing is the best way for organic remains to be preserved, so frozen finds 
are usually more spectacular. They provide rare opportunities to study 
human bodies and normally perishable artifacts, and more finds to argue 
about!
Ice mummies in the Andes
Inca ritual in the Peruvian Andes involved high-altitude burial of sacrificed 
children; climbers and archaeologists have discovered several of these 
burials over the years. These frozen mummies were given chicha (corn 
beer) and hit in the head to knock them out. They were wrapped in layers 
of elaborate woven textiles with artifacts of feathers, shell, silver, gold and 
other rich materials, as well as food offerings of llama meat and corn.
Although some see the poor children as hapless victims, others note that 
they were honored, pure offerings to the sacred mountains. Displaying and 
studying the frozen bodies has also generated controversy. Even a U.S. 
president viewing the exhibition of a frozen girl made a comment about 
how good she looked, offending some Native Americans and others. But 
continuing study of the mummies and their artifacts brings fascinating data 
on health, genetics, and everyday life of these 500-year-old kids.

311
 Chapter 18: Controversies and Sensational Findings
Other frozen bodies
Extinct Pleistocene (Ice Age) bison and other big mammals have been found 
melting out of glaciers and ice fields too, as have a few humans in the Arctic. 
A frozen man recently found in British Columbia was dated to about 550 
years. He was clearly ancestral to living Canadian First Nations (native) 
people. They named him “Long-Ago Person Found” and asked for respectful 
study of his body. He wore a squirrel- or gopher-fur coat and a hat woven of 
cedar and spruce roots, and had a leather bag with plants and dried fish in it, 
a bone and metal knife, and a spear. He was about 20 years old. His DNA 
continues to be studied, but has already tied him to North and South 
American Indians.
Thawed artifacts and reindeer manure
Global warming usually has negative effects, but melting Arctic ice can 
reveal amazing archaeological evidence. Finds currently thawing out include 
stinky reindeer manure and artifacts from the last 8,000 years. Spear and 
arrow shafts, an atlatl (hooked stick for spear throwing), stone, antler, and 
ivory points, and sinew, feathers, and red ochre were all hunting equipment. 
Scientists recently identified the glue holding an antler point from the Canadian 
Yukon to its spear shaft as spruce resin. The finds also help determine how 
early the bow and arrow were introduced (recently, perhaps in the last 1,000 
years). Even the animal dung is valuable — showing what critters were eating, 
clues to past environments. It also indicates that the natives knew where to 
wait for the game to pass by so that they could get dinner.
Cannibalism in the U.S. Southwest
Ancestral Pueblo farmers (also called the Anasazi) in the southwestern 
U.S. are famous for their glorious ruins. (See Chapters 13 and 19 and Color 
Figure 8 for more on these sites). But these late prehistoric people are also 
embroiled in a controversy over cannibalism.
The finds
Archaeologists have interpreted human bones with signs of cutting, breaking, 
smashing, and boiling as evidence of butchery and cannibalism at many sites 
dating between A.D. 900 and 1250. They were found amid other signs of violence 
such as destroyed houses and artifacts, all dating to the time the settlements 
were abandoned. According to one archaeological interpretation, the violence 
may have been triggered by drought and hard times.
Alternative explanations
But other archaeologists say that cutting up bodies may have been a treat-
ment for witches, not wholesale violence or cannibalism (or perhaps the 
witches themselves were the only cannibals). They cite folklore of modern 
Pueblo Indians, who have many witch stories. These folks resent the term 

312
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
Anasazi because it’s a Navajo word meaning “enemy” or “stranger.” They’re 
horrified at the portrayal of their ancestors as warlike cannibals. But then, 
some scientists argue, most people in the modern world are repulsed by 
cannibalism anyway. However, some cultures actually practice cannibalism 
out of respect for the honored dead (though that’s clearly not what was 
happening here), so to some extent repulsion is in the eye of the beholder.
One decisive find
 
When I read about all this controversy in the 1990s, I knew just what it would 
take to prove that some people ate other people in the ancient past: a human 
coprolite (preserved feces) with human tissue in it. Lo and behold, in 2000, a 
report surfaced documenting such a coprolite from southwestern Colorado. 
At a small site occupied for about a generation and abandoned in A.D. 1150, 
the butchered bones of seven people were found. Human myoglobin (from 
muscle tissue) was in a coprolite deposited in a hearth (what a strange place 
to defecate) and also on a cooking pot, and human blood was on stone tools.
Archaeologists found no evidence of foods, suggesting that these were 
indeed starvation times. People’s possessions were lying around the site, 
indicating that the residents had no time to gather their things and flee 
before dying. Reconstructions of the scene portrayed savage massacre and 
gruesome ritual. Of course, the news media sensationalized all the findings 
and kicked up the level of outrage on all sides!
More thoughtful explanations
But wait! Things are never as simple as they seem in archaeology. Ancestral 
Pueblo people (a better name for the Anasazi) weren’t either violent savages 
or peaceful, noble natives — those are silly Western stereotypes. These groups 
clearly had some warfare, but it wasn’t their standard way of life most of the 
time, according to the majority of the archaeological evidence.
As the debaters realize that the situation is ambiguous, a new opinion by a 
coprolite specialist was published in 2006. He pointed out that researchers 
still only have this one coprolite with human tissue and no plant remains in 
it. He studied hundreds of other fecal samples to reconstruct the Ancestral 
Pueblo diet: They were about 70 percent vegetarian. They grew corn, beans, 
and squash but mostly ate some 50 wild plant species, as well as bighorn 
sheep, antelope, dogs, and rodents. The single coprolite from someone who 
ate another person was so unusual that it probably wasn’t from an Ancestral 
Pueblo native but a weird stranger. I like this explanation best, though 
archaeologists will probably never know exactly what happened.

313
 Chapter 18: Controversies and Sensational Findings
Who Are They, and Where Did They 
Come From: Disputed Ancient 
Peoples and Processes
Some of the biggest anthropological questions are how and when people 
first spread across oceans and continents, and many mysteries of these 
human cultural processes can only be explored through archaeology. Even 
in early historic times, most of the knowledge of movements and clashes of 
different peoples comes from archaeology. The following sections discuss 
the uncertainty surrounding the first inhabitants of many regions (and how 
they got there in the first place).
Ancient Southeast Asian “hobbits”
In 2003, excavations in an Indonesian cave on the island of Flores (east of 
Java) uncovered skeletons of unusual human forms. The bones were from 
an adult female and portions of up to eight other individuals who were very 
small — 3 feet tall — and dated to about 18,000 years ago. Archaeologists 
and other anthropologists continue to argue whether these unusual bones 
are from a previously unknown species of human, a creature who became 
extinct, or people with genetic conditions of dwarfism. Though the biologi-
cal name given them was Homo floresiensis, they were labeled “hobbits” 
(after the famous Tolkien characters) in the popular press. Artists even 
drew pictures of them as tiny, very hairy creatures, though of course no 
hair was preserved!
The earliest Homo erectus forms got to Java over a million years ago (see 
Chapter 12), and modern humans probably arrived around 50,000 years ago, 
according to their excavated bones. They were smaller than modern humans, 
though not that small. But size is reduced in many species as they adapt to 
islands. Other animals on Flores include dwarf elephants that were clearly 
hunted by these little people. So these people may have descended from 
the original human forms who made it across the sea to the island, and just 
gotten smaller as they stayed so isolated. Or they may have had a pathology 
that made them microcephalic (tiny-headed) or otherwise dwarfed.
As specialists in human biology and evolution continue debating all the 
different explanations, the archaeology gives good clues to the behavior 
of these little people. Hundreds of mostly small, even delicate, flaked-
stone tools were uncovered in the cave excavations, as were animal 
remains. The finds include

314
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
 
 Points from spears or darts and lots of waste flakes from chipping.
 
 Perforators, blades, and microblades that the excavators thought were 
hafted as barbs.
 
 Burned, reddened, and cracked stones, including some arranged in a 
circle, that suggest a hearth.
 
 Bones of those dwarf elephants (especially the young ones), sometimes 
with cut marks showing the little people were hunting (or scavenging) 
and butchering them.
 
 Bones of other animals like rat, bat, fish, frog, snake, birds, large rodents, 
and Komodo dragon — all of which could have been part of the diet 
(though in a tropical rainforest they probably ate mostly the abundant 
plants).
Some of the stone tools are similar to others excavated in deposits dated as 
old as 95,000 years ago, so perhaps human forms got to Flores and carried on 
their traditional ways despite slowly evolving smaller bodies. Stay tuned for 
new findings as the “hobbits” and their artifacts are carefully scrutinized with 
new scientific studies.
Identity of the Celts
The ancestral people of northern and western Europe before the Roman 
Empire took over are called the Celts. Greek and Roman historians described 
them as Keltoi, Gauls, Galatians, and other related names for the many groups 
who sacked Rome and Greece in the fourth and third centuries B.C. and even 
made it to Turkey. Romans interacted with them for several centuries — in 
trading, fighting, or other kinds of relationships. They described Celtic 
warriors, priests, and slaves.
The Celts themselves never wrote their own history, so they’re often better 
known through archaeology. But Celts may actually be a composite group 
invented by generations of historians seeking ancestors of today’s deep 
cultural heritage of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and Brittany (a region across 
the English Channel in northwest France).
Archaeologically, the time of the Celtic peoples was the Iron Age, from about 
800 B.C. to 50 B.C. and later, when Julius Caesar and succeeding emperors 
were busy conquering them all for Rome. However, Celtic cultural traditions 
continued around the edges of the Roman Empire, for at least another 1,000 
years (until Christianity and its ways took over).
Celtic artifacts
Digs in tombs of important political leaders and other sites have produced 
sensational evidence of what Celtic society must have been like. Here are 
some of the important finds in Celtic archaeology:

315
 Chapter 18: Controversies and Sensational Findings
 
 Hillforts, which are major political and economic centers with ditches, 
embankments, palisades, and often stone walls.
 
 Features in the ground indicating round houses with wattle (woven 
branches) and daub (clay covering) walls (or stone walls where stone 
was available), and a central hearth in the dirt floor. Houses were inside 
hillforts or in smaller settlements.
 
 Artifacts such as grinding stones for the wheat and barley they grew, 
and bones of the sheep, goats, cattle, and pigs they raised.
 
 Rich burials of elite individuals, with wagons, huge bronze jars and 
drinking vessels for alcoholic beverages, and other rich grave offerings. 
These goods demonstrate the presence of kings, war leaders, and nobles.
 
 Distinctive types of pottery; glass cone beakers for drinking at feasts; 
beads of bone, stone, glass, and amber; and everyday objects like 
wooden bowls, combs, spindles, furniture, and fancy carvings.
 
 Lots of iron artifacts — swords, knives, axes, harness fittings, ornamental 
stuff.
 
 Elaborate jewelry — brooches and pins of gold and other precious 
metals.
 
 Imported artifacts showing trade with the Mediterranean, eastern 
Europe, and even more distant lands.
Interpreting the Celtic past
Popular reconstructions are made from all these finds. Picture a bunch 
of big, pale guys with big mustaches wearing armor, feasting, and raising 
toasts as they boast about their battles. Or imagine druids chanting magic 
around the bonfire. These people certainly had skills in metalworking, and 
their exquisite gold jewelry and lots of other finery suggests they liked to 
show off their stuff. They also made lots of carved stone monuments with 
symbols whose meanings are still unclear.
The latest Celts remained in northwestern Europe, carrying on their pre-
Roman traditions. The few Celtic inscriptions (mostly on coins) are in lan-
guages related to modern Welsh, Gaelic (Irish), and Breton. Pagan religious 
festivals and legends of gods in later historic times also may be related to 
Iron Age symbols on artifacts. Celtic art — long a favorite subject of art 
historians — is quite distinctive, with complex patterns of spirals and circles 
and fantastic figures of birds, horses, other animals, and humans.
Relating history, archaeology, and heritage
Problems in understanding who the Celts were come when you try to relate 
the few (and biased) historic texts to archaeological finds. Ethnicity is 
hard to see in artifacts. (For more on ethnicity and archaeology, check out 
Chapters 15 and 16). Many different tribal groups fell under the heading of 
the barbaric Celts whom others were writing about. And cultures always 
change over time, though they can of course maintain some continuity. Celts 

316
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
may have been just a term ancient classical writers used for assorted groups 
of foreigners, and later historians made them into some kind of unified 
people with a group identity they never really had.
 
But identifying with noble warriors and resistance against empire stirs a lot of 
passion and fascination with the archaeology of the supposed Celtic people. 
Ethnic heritage is often squeezed out of the artifacts by the public wanting a past 
to call their own. Some critics argue that this emotion is tied with British pride 
and nationalistic identity in the face of today’s multicultural society and that 
archaeologists may be serving racist ideals if they classify materials as ethnically 
Celtic instead of by time period or other designation. Similarly, the early medi-
eval archaeology of Ireland is tied to a search for Celtic origins of Irish culture.
However you interpret the debate, archaeology contributes to the study of 
post-Roman northwestern Europe with good scientific goals. The material 
record is producing evidence for change and continuity over time. Pagan 
traditions were maintained in some areas, but Christian artifacts show patterns 
of how the church penetrated into other areas by medieval times and radically 
changed everyday life and politics. The goal of research isn’t just to revel in 
hoards of golden artifacts but to reconstruct social organization and economic 
systems that interacted with the historically documented world.
How the Americas were first discovered
A huge and long-lasting controversy in American archaeology concerns the 
first people coming to the New World (North and South America). Passionate 
arguments continue over how and when they got there. (See my discussion of 
Paleo-Indian culture in Chapter 12.)
Age and culture of the first Americans
For a long time scientists thought humans had only been in the Americas for a 
couple thousand years. Then in 1908, an African American cowboy-naturalist 
found a human-made spear point stuck into the skeleton of a Pleistocene (Ice 
Age) bison near Folsom, New Mexico. This species was known to be extinct 
for the last 10,000 years! In the1930s, archaeologists excavated at Clovis, New 
Mexico, and found other spear points with mammoth bones. The Clovis and 
Folsom archaeological cultures were later radiocarbon dated (after that dating 
method was invented in 1950) and other distinctive types of spear points were 
named. Paleo-Indian culture was the term encompassing all of these groups 
who inhabited the Americas during the Pleistocene.
Here are the typical Paleo-Indian site characteristics in North America:
 
 Distinctive types of long, thin, beautifully made chipped-stone spear 
points, often with flutes (a big flake removed to make a channel up the 
middle on each side). I show you one of these points in Figure 12-5 in 
Chapter 12.

317
 Chapter 18: Controversies and Sensational Findings
 
 Other associated stone tools and flaking debris (lithic debitage).
 
 Clovis points associated with mammoths and radiocarbon dates as early 
as 12,000 years ago.
 
 Folsom points found with bison and slightly later radiocarbon dates, 
between 10,900 and 10,200 years ago.
 
 Other lance-shaped points associated with Ice Age animals and slightly 
later dates in both North and South America.
From all the evidence, archaeologists reconstructed an ancient way of life 
emphasizing big-game hunting in the cold Pleistocene environment (before the 
animals became extinct with climate change at the end of the Ice Age — see 
Chapter 13 for more). At many Paleo-Indian campsites, excavations uncovered 
butchered bones of hundreds of the large herd animals. Some theorists did 
argue that the first Americans certainly ate lots of plants, too, as do modern 
big-game hunting cultures, but seldom are those remains preserved. Another 
important argument was that early coastal fishing sites are unknown because 
they would have drowned after sea level rose at the close of the Ice Age.
How people got to America
A huge debate also rages over how these first people arrived in the New World. 
Here are the three most commonly proposed routes and their suggested 
means of travel:
 
 Walking over the Bering Strait when it was actually a land bridge 
between Siberia and Alaska: Ice Age glaciers took up lots of water, so 
sea level was far lower and the land was exposed.
 
 Boating along the shore from Siberia to Alaska and down the Pacific 
coast: This is the most likely method (and probably easier); people may 
have branched off and moved inland as they went south. 
 
 Walking on land and ice and maybe some boating from Europe: This 
hypothesis is less reasonable; the distance was too far, and only a vague 
similarity exists between French Paleolithic and American spear points. 
Plus, Native American DNA is more closely linked to northeast Asian roots.
So this was the scenario of the “peopling of the Americas”: Mighty hunters 
following their game moved eastward and “discovered” the New World about 
12,000 years ago, not realizing they’d come to a new continent.
Newer finds of older artifacts down south
A few sites in the Americas do actually date before 12,000 B.P. (before the 
present). Some sites in South America have produced radiocarbon dates a 
couple centuries earlier than those in North America, a bit curious because it 
would take more time for the first settlers to move south and fill up a second 
continent. Excavators thought some other controversial sites in North America 
were as old as 17,000 years B.P., but most of the archaeological establishment 

318
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
questioned the integrity of these finds, the accuracy of the radiocarbon dating 
(which is, after all, a statistical approximation) and even whether the crude-
looking chipped stones were human-made artifacts at all. (See Chapter 10 for 
more on radiocarbon dating.)
In the 1980s, a few sites with good, uncontaminated dates began challenging 
the notion that the so-called Clovis people were the first on the continent. One 
breakthrough came at Monte Verde, Chile, on South America’s far southern 
coast. Because this ancient camp was a wet site, things that usually decay were 
excavated from the boggy creek bank. The radiocarbon dates showed people 
living there 14,200 years ago or earlier.
Here are some of the remains from the Monte Verde site:
 
 Wooden foundations of rectangular row-houses with clay-basin fire 
hearths and (apparently) animal hide covers on the walls.
 
 Foundations of another, more oval-shaped structure off to the side that 
contained unusual remains like mastodon bone, salt, and several bits of 
uncommon plants, including some that may have been medicinal. This 
building was interpreted as the home of a shaman (religious practitioner 
or healer).
 
 Bones of other animals, like llamas, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. 
Other indicators of diet are shells (from shellfish) and even a piece of 
mastodon meat.
 
 Some 42 species of plant remains, like wild potato, berries, seeds, nuts, 
fruits, and even chewed bits of seaweed and leaves. Nine species of 
marine algae and seaweed remains on a sharp stone tool edge show use 
of coastal resources and support the idea that people spread through 
the Americas along the Pacific coast.
 
 Wooden digging sticks and spear shafts, twine, and cordage.
 
 Stone tools (especially grinding stones) but no chipped-stone points.
It took many years for Monte Verde to be accepted as a pre-Clovis ancient 
American settlement, and archaeologists are actually still arguing about it. 
Meanwhile, another dig at a cave in the Brazilian Amazon uncovered quartz 
stemmed points very unlike Clovis points but securely dated from 11,200 
to 10,000 years old. They were associated with 30,000 stone flakes and the 
remains of thousands of fruits, seeds, nuts, shellfish, small and large fish, and 
animals. This evidence indicated the earliest people were foraging widely in 
the tropical forest and river, not hunting big mammals.
Newest discoveries
More really early sites have come to light recently, though archaeologists 
thoroughly debate the authenticity of each one. A Virginia dig produced 
stone tools dated to 16,000 years ago, and the Topper site in South Carolina 
is supposedly well over 40,000 years old. Another new development is the 

319
 Chapter 18: Controversies and Sensational Findings
recalculation of all the original radiocarbon dates for early Paleo-Indian sites 
with Clovis points. They cluster within a very small time range, from about 
13,000 to 12,800 years ago, suggesting not a particular people spreading out 
and filling up the land but rather a new technology spreading quickly to the 
people who’d already filled up the land.
The most fascinating news comes from Paisley Caves in south-central 
Oregon. For decades, digs there had unearthed unusual materials preserved 
in the dry soil: wooden artifacts, twine, basket fragments, and bones of birds, 
fish, and large animals like extinct camels and horses. New dates showed 
some of these finds were as old as 14,000 B.P. Even more amazing are the 
coprolites (dried feces) that contain recently identified human DNA and even 
a human hair, dated to about 14,300.
You can imagine the joking about the coprolites! But they do allow study of 
ancient humans without disturbing any bones (no bones this old have ever 
been found anyhow). Their great age adds more support to the idea that 
people came to the New World as early as 15,000 years ago. Several centu-
ries must have passed before they developed the distinctive technology to 
produce Clovis and other Paleo-Indian points. Their lifeways clearly included 
hunting big game but more often were far broader, focusing on lots of local 
plant resources, smaller animals, and fish as well.
The later “discovery” of America
Millions of prehistoric people came to inhabit North and South America, 
foraging, settling, farming, and developing civilizations (which I discuss in 
detail in Chapters 13 and 14). They spread throughout both continents with 
thousands of languages and cultures before some weird strangers arrived 
from Europe. The first of those were the Vikings or Norse, who sailed from 
Scandinavia via Iceland and Greenland in the 11th century. They got to the 
Canadian coast but didn’t stay long, leaving only the smallest archaeological 
traces in the ground. (For more on the Vikings, head to Chapter 15.)
But a few hundred years later, Spanish, Portuguese, and British explorers 
(along with others of many Old World nations) invaded and began the process 
of major colonization and change that’s visible in the archaeological record.
Spanish invasions and the effects of the conquistadores
Columbus arrived in the New World in 1492; in Chapter 15, I describe the 
archaeology of one of his early settlements in the Caribbean. Lots of Spaniards 
followed him across the Atlantic seeking adventure and fortune, and (later) 
souls for the Church. The conquistadores’ early invasions of Mexico, Peru, and 
the southeastern U.S. have been documented by chroniclers and analyzed by 
historians ever since. But archaeology now contributes an enormous amount 
of information not found in the writings.

320
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
The paths of the conquistadores across the continents are reconstructed 
from their artifacts and even the bones of their horses and pigs (animals 
new to America), but the exact routes they took are controversial. Native 
Americans would use and trade the artifacts they got (or took) from 
Europeans, so these items often moved across the landscape independently 
from the journeys described in the Spanish records.
Early contact-period sites have Native American pottery, corn, and stone tools 
combined with bits of Spanish armor, chain mail, crossbow quarrels (dart tips) 
and other weapons, coins, and glass beads. Beads may have been given as 
cheap trinkets, but they became important ceremonial items and markers of 
status for Native Americans, included as burial goods with the important dead. 
Meanwhile the gold and silver statues, jewelry, and sacred items the Spaniards 
did find among the civilizations of Mexico and South America were melted 
down and sent to Spain to make money to fuel the conquest.
Some archaeologists have worked with medical researchers to trace the 
evidence of the introduction of European germs into New World populations. 
Cemeteries and burial mounds document massive numbers of native deaths 
in the early 16th century from epidemics. Occasionally, sword cuts on the 
skeletons show the violence that took place, but more often the signs point to 
deaths from Old World diseases. Smallpox, influenza, and even common colds 
that didn’t bother Spaniards could wipe out entire towns because natives had 
no resistance to these imported illnesses. Debate arises over whether Native 
Americans died out fast or whether the impact of the foreigners wasn’t so bad. 
Skeletal remains and the abandonment of native towns give clues to what was 
apparently a demographic disaster in some areas, but not in others.
Colonization
Early Spanish missions were devoted to converting natives and making them 
labor in the fields. Although controversy rages over how badly Europeans 
treated Native Americans, studies of native skeletons show they worked much 
harder farming during the colonial period than they did in prehistoric times. 
Other fascinating archaeological investigations concern how much of Native 
American culture the Europeans took on, and how much like Europeans the 
natives became. This exchange is visible in the kinds of artifacts and house 
patterns in the ground. For example, Native American pottery began to 
conform to European shapes, such as pitchers or dishes with ring stands on 
the bottom. They used certain European artifacts as wealth goods, although 
other foreign trinkets became commonplace.
European powers had different strategies and goals for colonization as they 
fought wars on their own continent that spread to the New World. Sites such 
as forts and homesteads (and their accompanying artifacts) show the nature 
of interaction among Europeans and indigenous peoples. Key players in the 
game of exploration and colonization took different approaches:

321
 Chapter 18: Controversies and Sensational Findings
 
 The Spanish were medieval — dominated by crown and church — and 
kept natives in servitude on missions and haciendas. They brought 
European plants, indicated by excavated peach pits and other things, 
and also their domestic animals. But wild animal bones show Indian 
hunting traditions remained. Spaniards traveled in big ships and 
armored on horseback, so artifacts from these activities are common.
 
 The French explored rivers in the continental interior by canoe and 
traded beads and metal goods for deerskins. Excavation of their colonial 
settlements often turns up deer bones and typical European crockery 
and metal implements, as well as religious items (see Color Figure 15).
 
 The British were budding capitalists interested in profit; they also brought 
metal tools, cauldrons, and glass beads to the Native Americans in return 
for deerskins. They changed native hunting from a means of subsistence 
to a profit-making enterprise (which decimated deer populations too).
Heritage issues
Some archaeological finds support the historical records of struggling colonists, 
but others show these Europeans had lots of luxuries. Still other excavations 
fill out the picture of natives who didn’t get a chance to tell their own story. 
Hundreds of indigenous groups became extinct after being barely mentioned in 
the early histories; archaeology is the only way to know them. Archaeologists 
work with Native Americans to locate the historic towns, missions, plantations, 
or other places their ancestors fled or were chased from in the 16th through 
18th centuries and give them back the evidence of their former homes.
Further, as English-speaking America celebrates its historic heritage with 
monuments at colonial British sites such as Williamsburg, Virginia, archae-
ologists document the struggle between the European powers to control the 
continent through 18th century. How European countries routed each other’s 
colonies and soldiers is visible in the ground. Re-enactors of historic events, 
from the War of 1812 to the conquistadores’ battles, call upon archaeologists 
for details of costumes, weapons, food, and forts. Long before the Mayflower, 
the Spanish began the process that could have ended up with everyone in 
the U.S. eating tortillas and chili peppers! Details from the ground show the 
duration and success or failure of colonial settlements, and the superior 
strategies and trade goods the English used to prevail in the end.
How the far Pacific was discovered
Islands of the vast Pacific Ocean were among the last places humans came to 
inhabit. Polynesian ancestors sailed canoes around millions of miles of sea 
over the last three millennia with no real navigation instruments. The ancient 
people archaeologists call Lapita, after their distinctive pottery, colonized 
hundreds of remote islands — Hawaii, Fiji, Samoa, Tahiti, and New Zealand, 
just to name a few. Archaeological evidence shows they may have set out

322
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
deliberately to colonize — bringing objects not originally available on these 
islands, like livestock, taro plants, and stone tools. But controversies arise 
over where they came from and when and how they did it.
Ancient origins and sailors
On an island in the nation of Vanuatu, a recent investigation of a 3,000-year-
old burial ground uncovered 62 graves. Chemical analysis of the teeth of 
some skeletons indicated they were of people who hadn’t grown up on the 
island but came from elsewhere. DNA studies are still underway. Offerings 
in the graves included rare whole Lapita pots, with their stamped decora-
tions, and stone tools like knives and scrapers. The chemical makeup of the 
obsidian raw material for these tools was characteristic of a source in New 
Guinea, thousands of miles to the west.
Linguistic anthropologists see the origins of the languages of western 
Polynesians in Taiwan, and DNA study of teeth from prehistoric and modern 
varieties of pigs shows the Pacific species are closest to those of Southeast 
Asia. Regardless of whether they had more northerly or southerly Asian ori-
gins, the people who colonized the Pacific developed their sailing skills over 
centuries as they hopped eastward from one island to the next one that they 
could see. The real test of their skills came when they began to go farther on 
pioneering voyages thousands of miles into the empty central Pacific.
Presumably, they had outrigger sailing canoes, but no ancient vessels or 
rigging have survived so far for archaeologists to dig up. The native canoes 
first described by 18th-century British visitors were fast but small; some 
argue they were too small and useless in a contrary wind to be able to go 
deliberately to faraway new islands. The Polynesians must have had 
knowledge of currents, waves, swells, winds, and other natural phenomena. 
Aside from that, the explanations for how they did it vary wildly; the 
following list presents a few ideas being floated (pun intended):
 
 They knew how to tack into the wind (change direction by turning the sail).
 
 They sailed toward volcanic plumes in the sky because they knew it 
meant land.
 
 They followed migrating birds (or brought birds who would know the 
way to land).
 
 They weren’t skilled sailors at all; they just landed in all these remote 
islands by chance, through the action of winds, currents, or special El 
Niño (climate-shifting) events in unplanned voyages.
Regardless of how the Polynesians got to these islands, their colonization shows 
up in the material record, and not just in the things they brought and made. On 
many islands they settled, the largest species (whether tall, flightless birds or 
big shellfish) are present in the deepest, earliest archaeological levels, only to be 
absent in later levels and extinct today. Human occupation and overuse of new 
foods may have been a disaster for some of the islands’ plants and animals.

 Chapter 18: Controversies and Sensational Findings
Easter Island
Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small volcanic island in the 
southeastern Pacific. I discuss it in Chapter 20 as a fabulous archaeological 
place to visit. Over 2,200 miles west of South America, it was the most 
remote place humans ever inhabited (until today, when humans have 
figured out how to live at the South Pole or in space). Yet Polynesian 
seafarers made it here by about A.D. 500. They had tools of obsidian, animal 
teeth, and wood. They cut the palm forest, established settlements of 
stone houses and shrines, and began raising chickens and yams that they’d 
brought. Most famous are their hundreds of huge carved stone statues 
called moai, which apparently represented sacred chiefs or gods.
Within 1,000 years of the first human arrival, the limited resources were 
mostly gone: no trees for canoes, for rollers or sledges to move statues, or 
for fiber to make rope to pull them. People were trapped in a seriously 
damaged environment. The ensuing conflict between villages led to 
desecration and toppling of the statues and great hardship. Europeans 
arriving there in 1722 found it a barren environment. Some modern popular 
accounts call it a sad tale of human-made ecological destruction. But the 
earliest Europeans failed to mention how they contributed to the destruction 
of both the people and the natural resources, not to mention the 
archaeological sites.
In addition, archaeologists studying ancient nut remains and animal bones 
now find it may not have been people but rather the rats they inadvertently 
brought with them that caused deforestation. Rats multiplied quickly and ate 
so many palm nuts that the trees became extinct. This unintended natural 
disaster, not the continuing competition among chiefs wanting ever more 
palm forests cut to move statues, may have been the reason for ecological 
disaster. Meanwhile, today tourism and international commerce is severely 
threatening the prehistoric sites on Easter Island.
Chicken in Chile
As the disputes over Easter Island continue, it’s clear that ancient 
Polynesian navigators continued to explore eastward. Archaeologists 
recently discovered bones of chicken in prehistoric Chile, securely dated 
to a century before Spaniards arrived. This bird is native to the Old World 
and was thought to have been brought to South America by the Spanish. 
But DNA studies show the bones are most closely related to chickens from 
Easter Island, as well as elsewhere in Polynesia. So far, no other remains 
showing the Polynesian presence have been found in South America, but 
South American bottle gourds and sweet potatoes have been found on 
some Pacific islands. Some even argue that prehistoric California’s complex 
fishhooks and sewn-plank canoes look like Polynesian ones. The Pacific 
explorers who got to South (and maybe North) America may have found too 
many people there, left a few things and ideas, and gone back west to their 
island homes, bringing a few souvenirs. But look for more debate on this in 
years to come!

324
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
Controversies among Archaeologists 
and Others
Often, the significance of archaeological finds derives from their political 
implications and importance to different interested parties, many of whom 
aren’t archaeologists. I describe many of these cases in Chapter 16, and in 
Chapter 2 you see the dispute between Greece and England over the Elgin 
Marbles, relics looted from the Parthenon in Athens in the 19th century and 
now displayed in the British Museum. Disagreements over artifacts typically 
occur between countries of their origin and countries who’ve been taking 
care of them for a long time. Disagreements over sites happen when different 
people want the land for different reasons, from profit to preservation.
Machu Picchu remains claimed by Peru
UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization) 
declared Machu Picchu one of its World Heritage sites, and with good reason: 
the Spanish never discovered (and therefore didn’t destroy) this prehistoric 
Inca estate as they conquered Peru. (See Machu Picchu in Figure 14-4 in 
Chapter 14 and color Figure 12). It’s an amazing monumental structure of cut 
and fitted stones in the highlands beyond the Inca capital of Cuzco. I describe 
for you how worthwhile it is to visit in Chapter 20.
Hiram Bingham, a Yale University explorer, discovered Machu Picchu (okay, 
made the ruins public to the outside world) in 1911. He was an adventurer and 
potential model for fictional characters like Indiana Jones. He got permission 
from Peru to take some 5,000 artifacts back for study. Archaeology takes a long 
time, but 95 years is pushing it. In 2006, Peruvian officials demanded that Yale 
return these materials in a highly publicized claim. The original agreement was 
a loan, but it wasn’t well designed or understood. Protests by archaeologists 
and politicians escalated. Yale finally agreed to give some artifacts back and 
sponsor a traveling exhibition, but the dispute continues.
Meanwhile, tourism is increasing so much that it’s endangering the site. In 2000, 
a crane hired to help film a beer commercial accidentally chipped an important 
stone monument. Uproar continues over helicopters landing on the site, and 
now archaeologists and the public are protesting the government’s plans to 
construct a cable car to the Machu Picchu and a tourist complex with luxury 
hotel, boutique stores, and restaurants. Watch for new developments to come, 
and try to see the site before it changes forever from a remote, astounding 
outpost to a tourist trap!

325
 Chapter 18: Controversies and Sensational Findings
Miami Circle site
A huge controversy followed discovery of the Miami Circle. This unusual 
prehistoric site is a circle of postmolds cut into the limestone bedrock, 
measuring 38 feet in diameter and outlining what must have been a big 
building on Brickell Point in downtown Miami, Florida. Over these postmolds 
was black midden (garbage) soil containing artifacts like pottery and tools 
of bone, shell, and stone. Radiocarbon dates indicated the site was built 
and used from 750 B.C. to A.D. 550, and then later occupied between 1330 
and 1680.
The site was found when a developer tore down an old apartment building 
to build a luxury condominium. Laws required him to have an archaeological 
survey first, and when this spectacular site was found, several results ensued. 
The developer worried about losing income and offered to cut out the site and 
move it so he could continue building on this prime real estate at the mouth 
of the Miami River. The city worried about losing tax revenues if the planned 
commercial endeavor was halted. Popular support for preserving the site grew 
among archaeologists, Native Americans, and other protesters, and threats 
of legal action and disputes over the value of the land followed. In a stunning 
move, the state of Florida, using its own money and various donations, 
purchased the site in 1999 to preserve it.
Archaeological controversy
Because the septic tank for the old building was still there in the ground within 
the circle, some archaeologists thought the site was disturbed and not worth 
saving. They argued it may be too damaged to produce useful information. And 
it doesn’t end there:
 
 Some (including archaeologists and a paranormal investigator) thought 
the circle wasn’t a real prehistoric site but a result of cutting into the 
bedrock to install the septic tank.
 
 Others thought the ground-stone axes looked Mexican and hypothesized a 
prehistoric Mayan colony (or people from Stonehenge, or extraterrestrials).
 
 Finally, some archaeologists were angry that $27 million in state funds 
and many more millions in donations were spent to buy and preserve 
the site when plenty of more important sites all over Florida were being 
bulldozed daily in the path of unbridled construction.
Scientific investigation
Continued excavation and mapping of the site demonstrated that it really 
is the remains of a prehistoric structure, with intentionally marked cardinal 
direction points and possible alignment with astronomical calculations. 

326
Part V: Archaeology Is for Everyone 
Similar circular buildings are known from other sites of this time period in 
the eastern U.S., though most have postmolds dug into the soil. But other 
prehistoric sites with cut-rock postmolds occur in south Florida.
Miami Circle was probably a ceremonial center inhabited by local Florida 
natives but with wide-ranging connections. You can see this in the finds:
 
 The chert (flint) raw material of the stone tools is from hundreds of miles 
away. (Little natural stone occurs in south Florida).
 
 Two galena (shiny, silvery stone) artifacts are made of raw material 
traced to Missouri.
 
 The (so-called Mexican) ax is made of stone traced to north Georgia.
 
 A complete shark skeleton, dolphin skull, and sea-turtle shell were 
uncovered in the ground within the structure; they were probably some 
kind of ancient offerings.
 
 The holes cut for the ancient posts are much older than the septic tank 
hole, according to geological studies.
 
 19th-century artifacts from Seminole Indians and from the trading post 
that once sat here as late as 1900 are in the upper levels of the site.
 
 Food remains include shark teeth and bones of many other marine and 
freshwater fish, turtles, squirrel, rabbit, deer, dog, birds, amphibians, 
and the (now-extinct) Caribbean monk seal. These remains all show 
high-intensity use of the brackish (not salty but not fresh) water habitat 
around the site.
Though the site is still controversial, the majority consensus now is that 
it was built by ancestors of the historic Tequesta Indians that the Spanish 
encountered in the 16th and 17th centuries. These people were quickly wiped 
out, but their site remains preserved for the public to understand at least a 
little about how they lived and what they may have thought was sacred.

Alabama: Moundville 
Archaeological Park
Not far from Tuscaloosa on the Black Warrior River, Moundville had 26 
flat-topped earthen mounds (see Color Figure 7) inside a wooden palisade. 
Though the wood decayed, the mounds remain. It was a major town and 
religious center from A.D. 1000–1450, with chiefs residing in special buildings 
on top these temple mounds. The wealth of high-status people included 
exotic luxury items of copper, mica, and marine shell. Starting as a major 
town, it became a ceremonial place for burying the important dead.

While you’re in Alabama, catch Russell Cave National Monument up in the 
northeastern corner of the state. This huge cave has archaeological remains 
from native people who lived in it over 8,000 years of prehistory!
Arkansas: Toltec Mounds Archaeological 
State Park
At this site near Little Rock, prehistoric people of the Late Woodland culture 
built a major settlement and ceremonial center between A.D. 600 and 1050. 
They hadn’t yet begun intensive farming but had gardens of domesticated 
crops. The site features at least 15 mounds, many aligned to correspond with 
the solstices and equinoxes (the heavenly bodies were the best nighttime 
show during prehistory), and a surrounding earthen embankment. The state 
of Arkansas even funds a research station here, and a lovely museum.
Colorado: Mesa Verde National Park
In the high plateau country of southwestern Colorado, Mesa Verde’s 4,000 
archaeological sites bring alive the ancestral Pueblo (or Anasazi) culture, 
which lasted from A.D. 600 to 1300. Distinctive architecture styles feature 
adobe, stone, and layered masonry, with houses joined in compact clusters. 
Trails link excavated and stabilized sites. You can see mesa-top settlements, 
pithouses, towers, kivas (religious areas), terraces, and check dams built by 
these early farmers. Or check out the spectacular Cliff Palace (or one of the 
other 600 cliff dwellings) built later in prehistoric time. (See Color Figure 8).
Georgia: Etowah Indian 
Mounds Historic Site
Etowah was a center of late prehistoric Mississippian-culture chiefdoms in 
northwest Georgia inhabited from A.D. 1000 to 1550. It features six earthen 
mounds, a plaza, a large village, and what may be a defensive ditch surround-
ing it all. Mound C is a 63-foot-high, flat-topped pyramid that would have sup-
ported a priest-chief’s home or important ceremonial building. Other mounds 
are the burial sites of important people, complete with shell beads, feathers, 
copper ornaments, paint, and fancy pottery. The museum interprets it all for 
you very nicely.

Florida: Mission San Luis de Apalachee
The Spanish invaded Florida in the 1500s, then set up colonies with 
missions in the 1600s, long before the more famous missions in the 
Southwest. But the Florida buildings of wood decayed rapidly. San Luis, 
in Tallahassee, was excavated well enough that archaeologists now know 
exactly where the Spanish church, convent, and native buildings stood. 
They’ve reconstructed them all with awesome results. You can contrast 
how a Spaniard lived with how an Apalachee Indian lived and see an 
exhibit that includes the story of how the descendants of the last known 
original Florida Indians were located in Louisiana, of all places.
While you’re in Tallahassee, also check out the late prehistoric Lake Jackson 
Mounds State Park, with towering flat-topped temple mounds and plaza. 
Also, the Museum of Florida History has prehistoric pottery, stone, wooden 
canoes, and historic Spanish gold excavated from shipwrecks.
Illinois: Cahokia Mounds 
State Historic Site
In East St. Louis (across the Mississippi River from Missouri), Cahokia 
flourished from A.D. 700 to 1400. It was the largest major center of the most 
sophisticated North American culture that ever evolved north of Mexico. It 
features more than 100 mounds; the largest (which you can climb) is Monk’s 
mound, named after a monastery that was once there. It measures 100 feet 
high, over 1,000 feet long, and over 700 feet wide — the largest earthen 
pyramid on the continent.
In Mound 72, archaeologists excavated the burial of what was probably 
a chief: an old guy lying on a bed of 20,000 shell beads with offerings of 
arrowheads, other fancy artifacts, and also skeletons of people who were 
apparently sacrificed. The site was mysteriously abandoned over a century 
before Europeans arrived in the New World. The museum is beautiful, and 
the walk to the top of Monk’s mound is awe-inspiring.

Louisiana: Poverty Point 
State Historic Site
The early hunter–gatherers who built this huge site in northeast Louisiana 
hadn’t even started farming yet when they brought in exotic stone from afar 
to fashion fancy tools and beads. Dating from 1800 to 1300 B.C., Poverty Point 
boasts several mounds and many huge concentric earthen rings. This site 
has some of the very oldest monumental architecture on the continent. Other 
fascinating and mysterious artifacts include figurines and unusual fired clay 
balls of various shapes that may have been for cooking. In the 1950s, aerial 
photography made the previously unrecognizable earthworks visible.
Maryland: St. Mary’s City
Less than two hours from Washington, D.C., near where the Potomac River 
reaches Chesapeake Bay in southern Maryland, St. Mary’s City was one of the 
few early permanent British settlements in North America. It’s the most intact 
17th-century English town in the U.S., and it was Maryland’s first capital. You’ll 
see costumed interpreters telling stories about daily life in such a young colony 
and how Native Americans and colonists got along, changing each others’ worlds 
forever. You may even be able to watch excavations in progress.
New Mexico: Chaco Culture 
National Historic Park
Chaco Canyon was a major settlement area for prehistoric Puebloan peoples 
(ancestors of today’s Hopi and other Native Americans) between A.D. 800 
and 1250. The park has scores of sites and a road system engineered by 
the ancients. You can see famous and distinctive Pueblo architecture that 
includes monumental public and ceremonial buildings. The largest great 
house is Pueblo Bonito, but the park has tons of other ruins as well. They 
feature clusters of houses in a fascinating community pattern.
Many other famous and exciting archaeological sites cluster around the Four 
Corners region where the states of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona 
come together. Consider visiting Mesa Verde on the same trip! (See the 
section on Mesa Verde earlier in this chapter.)

Ohio: Hopewell Culture National 
Historical Park
Formerly known as Mound City, this complex of burial mound and earthwork 
sites dates from 200 B.C. to A.D. 500. The Ohio River valley was a rich 
environment, but these people weren’t yet intensively farming (though they 
may have had small gardens). The geometric earthen walls and enclosures 
form circles and squares. The honored dead were buried with grave goods 
like fancy clay pots, mica, copper, and clay or stone smoking pipes in the 
shapes of animals. Many of these beautiful artifacts are displayed in the 
museum.
While you’re in southern Ohio, check out other mound sites, especially 
Serpent Mound, a 1,330-foot-long earthwork in the shape of a partially coiled 
snake. Archaeologists are still arguing whether it’s 2,000 or 1,000 years old.
Virginia: Historic Jamestown
Located within colonial 18th-century Williamsburg in coastal Virginia, 
Jamestown is the first permanent English settlement in America (though 
it kind of failed at first, until they moved to higher ground away from bugs 
and swamps). You can see the 1607 James Fort excavation and original 
and reconstructed 17th-century buildings. The settlement contains a lot of 
history, including costumed reenactors, but a lot of archaeology as well — 
determining where objects and buildings were and exhibiting artifacts of 
this early colonial period.
Wisconsin: Aztalan State Park
Aztalan is an important late prehistoric settlement and ceremonial center 
within the drainage of the upper Mississippi River (yes, the Mississippi goes 
up that far) that features several mounds and a village with a reconstructed 
stockade and interior fences. Dating to between A.D. 1000 and 1300, this 
settlement is a very northerly expression of late prehistoric Mississippian 
chiefdoms. Because the flat-topped earthen temple mounds resemble 
Mexican pyramids, long ago this site was mistakenly given the name of the 
mythical homeland of the Aztecs, who said they came from the north. (But 
in reality, Aztecs didn’t originate that far north!) It’s surrounded by other 
historic areas and towns worth visiting.

A Few Museums You Should Visit
Though not always on archaeological sites, museums feature all kinds of 
archaeological finds and stories about the prehistoric and historic past. The 
U.S. boasts thousands of museums; here are three important ones.
Connecticut: Mashantucket 
Pequot Museum
This small Indian tribe has put together one of the most elegant and impres-
sive museums in the world. It features Native American culture (the local 
Pequot and many others, including Ohio Valley mound builders) and tells 
the story of the New England indigenous peoples from the earliest Americans 
to colonial days to modern times. Artifact finds and scenes of daily life help 
reconstruct past native lifeways, and you can contrast scientific interpreta-
tions with the native peoples’ own sacred stories of their origins and other 
traditions. And you can see beautiful art as well!
New York: American Museum 
of Natural History
This huge museum has exhibits of archaeological finds and cultural recon-
structions from all regions of the world, as well as other natural history 
emphases. It’s one of the oldest and most impressive museums in the coun-
try and full of glorious ancient art and architecture and lots of classic stuff.
Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution
Situated on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., the Smithsonian sponsored 
some of the earliest and most famous archaeological expeditions in the U.S. 
and worldwide. Its exhibits also have artifacts and cultural reconstructions 
from all regions of the world. It consists of many different museums in separate 
buildings, but the National Museum of Natural History is the main place for 
archaeology. However, the new and beautiful Museum of the American Indian 
is full of Native American artifacts and art and has traditional reconstructions 
of the past that sometimes contrast with scientific interpretations.

ou can see archaeology at thousands of places all over the world, in 
every country. If you’re really interested, go beyond thinking of just 
typical stuff like ancient Egypt (though that’s neat too — see pyramids on a 
cruise down the Nile) or Pompeii (spend days there and at nearby related 
sites once covered by the volcano).  To plan travel, look up archaeological 
sites and museums in guidebooks available in libraries or bookstores, and 
online in tourism and government Web sites. You can go on organized tours 
with guides or make your own way with printed directions.
 
If you have the time, funds, or opportunity to choose only a few special places 
to visit archaeology, begin by looking at the United Nations World Heritage 
Sites list (available online at whc.unesco.org/en/list/en/list, with 
lots of links). At many sites you may even find conservation/reconstruction 
projects or excavations in progress, often by teams from different countries. 
You can also see the results of damage to famous ruins, not only from natural 
processes such as erosion but also from centuries of looting!
In this chapter, I list some spectacular and famous sites outside the U.S. that I 
know are exciting to visit. Check the map in the Appendix for their locations.

Cambodia: Angkor Archaeological Park
In the Southeast Asian tropics, Angkor consists of many sets of stunning ruins 
near the modern city of Siem Reap. As various rulers of the Khmer Empire 
came to power, they established several different capital centers from the 9th 
through the 15th centuries. (See Chapter 14 for a discussion of this history). 
The galleried passages and beautiful stone carvings of Angkor temples depict 
battles, dancing people and animals, both Hindu and Buddhist sacred stories 
and ideals, and much elaborate decoration.
The most famous ruin, Angkor Wat (see Figure 14-5 in Chapter 14) is the 
world’s largest religious monument. Among the dozens of other temples (from 
massive constructions to tiny rubble piles) is Angkor Thom (see Color Figure 
13), with its spiritual center, the Bayon Temple. It was the latest city built in 
this civilization, with towers that feature huge half-smiling faces on all sides. 
Another magnificent ruin is Ta Prohm, famous for being left to the large jungle 
trees trying to reclaim it — huge trunks sprawling over the stone ruins and 
cracking them apart. Yes, this site was also featured in the movie Lara Croft: 
Tomb Raider — though she certainly didn’t go there to do scientific excavation!
Archaeologists interpret Angkor today with remote sensing methods such as 
satellite imagery. Many think it was the largest pre-industrial city in the world. 
The rise of this civilization depended upon engineering and managing water 
resources. As you fly in you see the large lake, Tonle Sap, which normally flows 
southward to the Mekong River delta but flows northward in monsoon times. 
You can also see the humongous barays or reservoirs upon which this complex 
civilization depended. Some of these large, walled areas still have water, but 
many are covered by rice fields.
Canada: Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump
This site is in the foothills of the Rockies in Alberta, Canada. It was used 
continuously from as early as 6,000 years ago into the 19th century. For 
Blackfoot Indians of the Great Plains (in both Canada and the U.S.) and their 
ancient ancestors, it was a way to get dinner — stampeding American buffalo 
(or bison) off the 35-foot-high cliff to their deaths below. Lines of stone piles 
funneled herds to the cliff edge. Below the cliff are some 35 feet of stratified 
deposits — piles of animal bones with stone tools used to butcher them 
over the millennia. Bone remains at the nearby camp show how the hunters 
processed the animals: They dried the meat, boiled the bones for grease, 
and then pounded the dried meat with the fat and other foods to make long-
lasting pemmican cakes.
The site also contains stone tipi rings (circles of stones that would have 
anchored these tents). The surrounding area includes a natural gathering basin 
with a water source where herds grazed. The interpretive center (museum) 

337
 Chapter 20: More Than Ten Archaeological Sites to Visit Outside the United States
built into the rock cliff features Blackfoot culture, myths, and ecology, giving 
viewpoints of both scientific investigators and the native people themselves.
Polynesia (Chile): Easter Island
Easter Island is in the far Pacific Ocean, over 2,200 miles west of the South 
American west coast. Polynesian sailors got here by about A.D. 500 and settled 
down to grow crops and chickens that they’d brought. (See the discussion on 
peopling the Pacific in Chapter 18.) They carved hundreds of moai — huge, 
famous stone statues of important personages. Less than a millennium after 
people arrived, the environment was depleted. The first Europeans to reach 
the area (in the early 18th century) reported that the forest was nearly gone, 
the moai statues mostly toppled, and groups of inhabitants were in conflict. 
Popular descriptions ignore the European contributions to this destruction. 
But the spectacular statues and ruins are certainly part of a romantic tale of 
historic loss.
You can go to Easter Island by plane from Santiago, Chile, the country that 
has jurisdiction over it. Besides the moai, the island also features carved 
petroglyphs and paintings on the rock faces. You can visit house sites and 
earth ovens, and the quarry site where statues were made and unfinished 
ones remain. The museum features maps and artifacts, including a coral 
eye once inlaid in one of the statues. Tourism is escalating, so get there fast 
before things degenerate! 
China: Mausoleum of the 
First Qin Emperor
The first ruler to unify China under the Qin dynasty was Qin Shih Huang Ti. 
He used military might to conquer other states and become the first Chinese 
emperor in 221 B.C. (For more on the Qin dynasty, check out Chapter 14.) 
Joining existing walls, he built the Great Wall along the northern boundary 
(another good site to see, albeit a 1,500-mile-long one).
He had his own huge tomb built to mirror the universe and his empire. It 
was called Mount Li, in Lintong County, just east of Xian, Shaanxi Province. 
Though his actual grave remains undisturbed, archaeologists have excavated 
the outer areas of the tomb over the last few decades and found amazing 
evidence of wealth and power. Most famous are the galleries of over 8,000 
terra-cotta (fired clay) statues of larger-than-life warriors and horses ready for 
battle (see Figure 14-2 in Chapter 14). Each is a portrait of a real person, and 
they all have wooden chariots, real weapons, and rich artifacts of gold, jade, 
bronze, pottery, and even silk.

France: Lascaux Cave II 
and Paleolithic Art
The famous cave paintings of Lascaux were discovered in southwest France 
in 1940. These sophisticated artworks were produced nearly 20,000 years ago 
during the Upper Paleolithic. For a while, over a thousand people a day visited 
the site, but their breath and other effects caused deterioration, so the site was 
closed by the French Ministry of Culture in 1963. An amazing replica was built 
close to the original cave, using the same pigments (magnesium dioxide for 
black, iron oxides for reds and yellows). It’s a stunning archaeological site 
recreating the most renowned and beautiful segments of the original Lascaux, 
the Hall of the Bulls and the Axial Gallery.
Aside from the Lascaux, this famous region in the Dordogne Valley is a center 
for Paleolithic archaeology. You can see the town of Les Eyzies, where the 
beautiful new National Museum has everything Paleolithic but the kitchen sink 
(which they hadn’t invented during the Ice Age anyway). You can still visit 
many other real cave art sites. At Rouffignac, a tiny railway takes you through 
miles of long passages painted and engraved with over 100 mammoths and 
other animals. Another cave, La-Roque-Saint-Christophe, has a 1-kilometer-long 
cliff face with Paleolithic remains at the bottom and medieval structures on the 
ledges above.
Jordan: Petra
This famous site is built at (even carved into) rugged rock canyons; it’s easy to 
get to if you’ve already scheduled a visit to the Holy Land or elsewhere in the 
Middle East. Petra (like Great Zimbabwe) has a great combination of human-
made and natural stone landscapes. Its architecture incorporates natural 
undulating rose-pink rock surfaces and towering cliffs — you may even do some 
climbing! The ancients engineered an amazing system of canals, dams, and cis-
terns to control the little water they had.
Petra was inhabited as early as Neolithic times. By 200 B.C. it became a religious 
and trade center for the Nabataean people, who were Bedouin merchants. It was 
an important crossroads city for caravans traveling between the Red Sea and the 
Dead Sea and Arabia, Egypt, and Phoenicia (Syria). The architecture and 
artifacts blend Eastern and Hellenistic (Greek) traditions. The site contains 
rock-cut tombs, sculptures, and major public buildings (some of which may 
be temples). Some fragments of painted murals still cover walls. Finds such as 
ancient coins from many places show the international commerce that took 
place here in silks, spices, and many other valuable commodities. Parts of 
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade were filmed here; Petra portrayed the temple 
of the Holy Grail!

Malaysia (Borneo): Niah Cave
In the exotic jungle of East Malaysia (northern Borneo), Niah Cave (on the 
Niah River) is one the most spectacular archaeological site in Southeast Asia 
(see Figure 12-4 in Chapter 12). When you cross the river, you can see the 
museum before making the long trek through the rainforest (don’t forget 
your canteen!) to the caves. Archaeologists excavated the earliest skeletal 
remains of modern humans in Southeast Asia here, up to 46,000 years old  
(See the discussion of Upper Paleolithic people moving toward Borneo and 
Australia in Chapter 12).
In later levels, archaeologists discovered Neolithic artifacts and even later 
metal jewelry, cloths, fancy Chinese jars, and glass beads. One cave has 
wall paintings of red boats, apparently signifying the journey to the afterlife. 
Excavators found wooden, boat-shaped coffins holding the dead nearby, 
dating to between 2,000 and 1,200 years ago. Walking up and down the long 
cave passages is a real adventure — you need to go through complete 
darkness (so bring a flashlight). 
Malta: Megalithic Monuments
In the Mediterranean Sea just between Sicily and North Africa lie the island of 
Malta and its neighbor island of Gozo. Farming and herding people constructed 
the oldest known stone buildings in the world here from Neolithic times 
through the Copper Age. They built these megalithic (giant stone) tombs and 
other monuments (see Color Figure 9) with precision architecture and beautiful 
carved decorative motifs. The monuments show interesting alignments with 
the sun and other heavenly bodies and may actually have been for sun worship. 
(See Chapter 13 for a discussion of megalithic sites.)
Other fascinating archaeological remains on the islands are colossal stone 
statues and smaller clay figurines of very chubby women (see Figure 13-6 in 
Chapter 13). They may have been goddess figures worshipped by a peaceful, 
happy culture, Or perhaps they were images of real political or religious 
leaders, or something else entirely — archaeologists are still debating their 
significance. The islands’ museums display pottery, ornaments, and other 
fascinating artifacts.

Mexico: Teotihuacan, Maya, and El Tajín
Mexico is so packed full of towering pyramids and romantic ruins that 
choosing what to visit can be hard. Luckily, Mexico is a pretty inexpensive 
trip, so you may not have to choose. (Can you tell I love this country?) 
Many native cultures erected civilizations that flourished and interacted 
with one another, which gives you a lot of options.
You’d most likely fly into Mexico City, which has one of the best museums in 
the world (National Museum of Anthropology). While you’re in the nation’s 
capital, check out the ruins of the Aztec city of Tenochtitlán, only recently 
excavated downtown, with its pyramids and bright new museum. This was 
the capital where the native emperor Moctezuma met the Spanish in 1519 
(and continues to get his revenge).
The following are some of the best sites to visit outside Mexico City:
Teotihuacan
A short ride from Mexico City, Teotihuacan was the largest city in the 
Americas in its time. It was first occupied in about 200 B.C. and grew to be 
a center of trade, politics, and religion. At the south end is the Ciudadela 
(“citadel”) with its distinctive Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent. Running 
north from here is the Avenue of the Dead, with many smaller pyramids, 
palaces, and residential compounds on both sides. At the north end is the 
massive Pyramid of the Moon, and to the east is the even more humongous 
Pyramid of the Sun, built over a cave (probably for ritual purposes). Over 
the centuries, the native people enlarged it until it reached 740 feet square 
and 200 feet high — a great climb with a stunning view from the top!
The pyramids supported various temples and contained burials and exotic 
artifact offerings. With extensive mapping projects over the decades, 
archaeologists have shown the great extent of this city and the skills of 
ancient urban planners. But by A.D. 700, it was mostly abandoned; the 
reasons for its collapse are still mysterious, as is the identity of its people.
Maya Ruins: Palenque and Chichén Itzá
Among the many Maya ruins you can visit, Palenque and Chichén Itzá are two 
of the best and most famous. Maya city-states began to emerge around the 2nd 
century B.C., and they competed for power and built remarkable pyramids, 
palaces, and compounds with rich artifact offerings and elaborate stone carvings. 
The whole civilization began its mysterious “collapse” around A.D. 800. But 
archaeologists have now deciphered Maya writing and found some clues.

341
 Chapter 20: More Than Ten Archaeological Sites to Visit Outside the United States
 
 Palenque: This awesome site sits in the jungle of the state of Chiapas. It 
has many temple-pyramids, some still waiting for excavation (see Color 
Figure 10). At the magnificent Pyramid of the Inscriptions, you can not 
only climb up the pyramid but also go down into the interior. (This gives 
a workout to both your acrophobia and your claustrophobia!). Way at 
the bottom is the tomb of a famous ruler, Pacal, rich with offerings and 
stone carvings.
 
 Chichén Itzá: This Maya site is in the northern Yucatan peninsula, 
easy to reach from the coastal resort of Cancun. The city center rose 
to power around A.D. 600, as the southern centers declined, and lasted 
some 400 years. It features many amazing pyramids and palaces, as well 
as ball courts for the ritual game. Archaeologists have recovered many 
rich sacrificial objects from its sacred cenote, or water-filled sinkhole.
El Tajín
Less famous but really spectacular, El Tajín sits on the Gulf Coast in the state 
of Veracruz. It was occupied from at least A.D. 100 through the 13th century, 
built by ancestors of Mexico’s Totonac Indians. The inhabitants abandoned it 
(mysteriously, of course) by the time the Spanish arrived in the 16th century. 
A very distinctive architecture characterizes this Classic Veracruz culture. The 
site features pyramids, palaces, and ball courts for playing the widespread 
sacred ball game that may have originated here. Stone relief carvings and even 
a few painted wall surfaces are preserved. The most famous monument is the 
Pyramid of the Niches, 60 feet high, with stepped stone levels into which 365 
square niches were cut (see Color Figure 11).
 
For extra fun, see the Indian voladores (flyers) perform their ancient ritual in 
front of the beautiful museum. They jump off a 150-foot pole attached by ropes 
on their feet that slowly unwind as they descend, flying around the pole, to the 
music of a native flute played by a guy sitting on top of the pole.
Peru: Machu Picchu
After (or before) you catch ruins of the Inca and earlier civilizations in Peru, not 
to mention the wonderful museums, in Lima and other towns, you’ll probably 
want to go to Cuzco, the Incan capital high up in the Andes. (And, yes, they do 
give you tea made from coca leaves to adjust to the altitude.) From there you can 
easily reach Machu Picchu, the most famous Inca site (see Figure 14-4 in Chapter 
14 and Color Figure 12). For more information on the Inca and their ancestors, 
check out Chapter 14.

342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Machu Picchu is perched a mile and a half high on a mountain top often 
shrouded in mist, with an astounding view of the countryside and the 
Urubamba River 2,000 feet below. It’s a masterpiece of the Incas’ classic 
architecture, using distinctive trapezoidal doorways and big cut stones fit 
together so well that they didn’t need mortar. You can see imposing temples, 
water control facilities, houses, steps, and the great ancient road system. 
The mountainsides are all terraced to allow for growing crops to support 
the empire. It was built in about A.D. 1450 and lasted only a century before 
the native empire collapsed under the Spanish invasion. But the new regime 
simply forgot about the site instead of destroying it. The ride up the 
mountain itself is full of excitement (especially if you’re afraid of heights) 
with its many switchbacks (in Spanish: zigzags).
Zimbabwe: Great Zimbabwe
This site is a national shrine for this southern African country. It was built 
by a great civilization that thrived from the 11th through the 15th centuries. 
(See Chapter 14 for more on the history of Great Zimbabwe.) The large Hill 
Complex (see Color Figure 14) has stone blocks built into the outcropping 
rock in a wonderful combination of human-made structure and natural 
surfaces. South of this complex is the Great Enclosure, a circular wall within 
which at least 300 other structures were built, including a mysterious conical 
stone tower. The architectural elements include stone blocks fitted together 
without mortar into curving walls, with distinctive decorative elements in 
chevron (V-shaped) patterns. The most famous artifact finds here are the 
enigmatic bird figures carved on top of tall soapstone columns. Other finds 
are Persian and Chinese pottery, Arabian coins, and European glass beads 
that show trading connections with far-flung places.
 
Consider visiting other sites of this fascinating lost civilization, such as the 
Khami ruins near the city of Bulawayo.
All the magnificent ruins were originally interpreted by the racist colonial 
powers in southern Africa as being the result of ancient Arabs or European 
traders — anyone who wasn’t considered black! But archaeologists 
demonstrated this site was an indigenous civilization of the local Shona 
people, a Bantu-speaking group who still live in the region today. Why they 
abandoned this and other ancient cities and transformed their culture into 
something else remains a proper archaeological mystery.

n this chapter I list some of my favorite examples of ways to experience the 
pleasure of archaeology with more or less effort or cost (or discomfort). 
Some are free and easy (your local library); others require planning and layout 
of funds (archaeology guided tour or cruise).
Reading Archaeology in Fiction
In mystery novels, detectives solve crimes with archaeological methods, and 
lots of murder mysteries have archaeological settings. The well-crafted books 
of Agatha Christie, especially Murder in Mesopotamia (1936) and Death on the 
Nile (1937), are great. She was married to archaeologist Max Mallowan and 
helped on his digs in Iraq; she said an archaeologist was the best kind of 
husband because the older she got, the more interested in her he became!
Some mysteries feature the archaeologist as the actual sleuth. Elizabeth 
Peters (a real Egyptologist) has Victorian archaeologist Amelia Peabody 
(beginning with Crocodile on the Sandbank, 1975).
Archaeological adventure thrillers may have science fiction settings. A recent 
one is Xibalba Gate: A Novel of the Ancient Maya (2005), by Rob Swigert, 
taking place within a computer simulation of the Maya world.
You can find online various lists and bibliographies of archaeology in fiction, 
including mystery and science fiction novels.

344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Reading Archaeology in Nonfiction
Delving into nonfictional archaeology is often more exciting than reading 
novels because it’s about real discovery. Here are some of my favorites:
 
 C.W. Ceram’s popular books, especially Gods, Graves, and Scholars: 
The Story of Archaeology (1949, but still in print in new editions) have 
inspired generations of readers to go into the field.
 
 Egyptologist Barbara Mertz’s Temples, Tombs and Hieroglyphs: A Popular 
History of Ancient Egypt (new edition, 2007) is a lively presentation of stories 
reconstructed by archaeological work.
 
 Some fun archaeology guides are Dug to Death (2003) and Death by 
Theory (2001), mystery novels/textbooks by Adrian Praetzellis, and 
Archaeology: The Comic (2003) by Johannes Loubser. 
 
 Colin Renfrew’s thoughtful Figuring It Out is a philosophical treatise and 
stunning comparison of ancient artifacts and modern art.
Watching Movies about Archaeology
Movies featuring archaeology can be really bad, and archaeologists alter-
nately identify with Indiana Jones or Lara Croft and wring their hands over the 
awful stereotypes. But these do offer opportunities to learn, laugh, and show 
off your knowledge of good archaeology. Plus you have great dialog lines to 
quote (trust me!). So get friends and popcorn together and find a copy of the 
original 1932 horror classic The Mummy, starring Boris Karloff in the title role, 
back to life after thousands of years. This film set the pattern for the character 
of the archaeologist for ever after. One archaeology textbook  had a photo 
from the scene where the mummy, arms outstretched, approaches the young 
archaeologist bent over work in the lab. The caption said that the archaeolo-
gist was about to be attacked by what should be his data.
Watching Movies about 
Prehistoric People
Many classic films show Ice-Age cave people in horribly inaccurate circum-
stances — like One Million Years B.C. (1966), which features humans with 
dinosaurs, or 10,000 BC (2008), in which humans with mastodons build pyra-
mids. Some movies about prehistory try to be archaeologically more accu-
rate (though they’re not without scientific problems). Two favorites:

 Chapter 21: Ten Fun Archaeological Experiences
 
 Quest for Fire (1981): Paleolithic hunters learn how to make fire, use 
rudimentary language, and practice some interesting customs.
 
 Iceman (1984): An Arctic expedition discovers a frozen Neanderthal guy, 
expectably dark and wild (though Neanderthals were probably very 
pale). Thawed out, he hunts and makes fires in captivity, and of course 
grabs the female scientist. Don’t confuse this film with documentaries 
on Ötzi, a real 5,300-year-old Ice Man discovered melting out of an Alpine 
glacier. (See Chapter 18 for more on this Ice Man.)
So pop that corn and watch for each scientific mistake you see in how past 
people are portrayed, but also think about what our distant ancestors went 
through and survived!
Attending a Lecture and Exhibit
Museums  may exhibit archaeological materials, and often the archaeologist 
who dug the stuff up or organized the exhibit will appear to give a lecture on 
it. This is a great way to see the results of an archaeological project and hear 
its background. You can chat with the specialist(s) afterwards, ask questions, 
and sometimes even sign up to work on the project. Most such programs are 
free, and sometimes you can even get free refreshments after a lecture.
 
While you’re munching cheese and crackers and sipping punch, sign up to 
be a member of the sponsoring organization to receive information on future 
events. You can even meet others interested in archaeology who are also 
standing around drinking punch (or at really good exhibits, wine).
Planning Your Vacation 
to See Archaeology
Planning a vacation to visit archaeological sites and museums? First look 
online or in state guidebooks and maps (usually under “points of interest” 
or “historical places”). The U.S. National Park Service’s “Visit Archaeology” 
Web site (www.nps.gov/history/archeology/visit/index.htm) lists 
archaeological parks and travel itineraries. Online information changes so 
fast that I won’t list more-specific Web sites here.
A great book (also online) listing sites by state is America’s Ancient Treasures, 
by F. and M. Folsom; similar sources are available for different countries. 
Also see my lists of cool U.S. and foreign sites to visit in Chapters 19 and 20, 
respectively.

346
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
For a fancier trip, find (or have a travel agent find) tour companies that 
specialize in archaeological itineraries. Professional archaeologists lead 
many of these trips. For real luxury, you can find cruise ships specializing 
in art and archaeology of many regions, with archaeologists onboard.
Planning Your Vacation 
to Do Archaeology
In Chapter 17, I listed some ways you can sign up to participate in digs all 
over the country and the world. If you’re really gung-ho about this idea, you 
can plan your vacation around it for the whole family, even the kids. 
Being a Museum Volunteer
If you love how artifacts let you touch the past, consider volunteering at your 
local museum (history, science, or art). You can be a docent (leading gallery 
tours) or lab worker, and get involved with helping professionals.
Trying Out Archaeological Field School
Courses in archaeological field methods — field schools — can be in exotic  
places or close to home. See the Archaeological Institute of America’s listings 
(www.archaeological.org/webinfo.php?page=10016) or call your local 
college. Courses certified by the Register of Professional Archaeologists (RPA; 
www.rpanet.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenbr=10) give 
high-quality training in case you want to become a professional. The RPA now 
also offers scholarships for participants.
Being an Archaeological Donor
If you can afford it, consider donating funds or other support toward an 
archaeological project, university research program, museum, or foundation 
such as the Archaeological Conservancy that buys and protects sites. Most 
archaeology is chronically under-funded. Donation means doing more than 
most to unearth the human past and bring it to the present!
