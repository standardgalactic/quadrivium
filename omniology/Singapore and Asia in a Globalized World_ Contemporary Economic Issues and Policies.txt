SINGAPORE  AND ASIA IN A GLOBALIZED WORLD
Contemporary Economic Issues and Policies

Chapter
Foreword
Economics is a very important and useful subject. These words,
coming from an economist, would probably invite skepticism from
people of other disciplines. However, being an educator for close to
half a century, I would say from my teaching experience that funda-
mental training in Economics allows our students to think more criti-
cally and enables them to better understand world economic and
world financial policies, problems and issues.The latter, in particular,
is increasingly important in view of the current turmoil in the global
economy.
Since 2006, the Division of Economics of Nanyang Technological
University (NTU) has been working with the Ministry of Education
(MOE) to organize economic seminars for Junior Colleges (JCs) stu-
dents and teachers every year. The objectives are to present to our
youngsters and their teachers contemporary economic issues and
public policies in Singapore as well as the region.We also aim to intro-
duce the wide-ranging fields of the study of economics to the students.
These seminars have been very well-received by the JCs students and
teachers, with more than 1,000 participants attending the seminars
each year.
This year, the NTU-MOE Seminars were held in March 2008.The
response was overwhelming, and there is currently a plan to double
v

the capacity of subsequent seminars. There are also interests from the
polytechnics to participate in the subsequent seminars. The NTU-
MOE Seminars 2008 had put together a list of distinguished and profi-
cient speakers covering a wide range of economic issues that are
integral to the Singapore economy. I am very glad that World
Scientific Publishing Company has decided to publish these papers
that were presented during the NTU-MOE Seminars 2008, so as to
increase the accessibility of these papers.
There are a total of 13 papers in this book. Issues discussed
and reviewed include healthcare, social security, monetary policy,
economic transformation, globalization, sub-prime crisis and Asian
economic integration. I believe that readers of this book, would
benefit from having a better understanding of the world economic
and world financial policies, problems and issues as well as those
facing Singapore and the region.

Transformation in the Singapore
Economy: Course and Causes*
Lim Chong Yah†
Has there been an economic miracle in Singapore? How do we measure
this miracle? Is it measurable? How and why has this miracle taken place
in Singapore for the last 43 years after Independence in 1965? What struc-
tural changes have taken place in the economy? What special institutions
have been created to engineer this transformation? What is the critical
role of the State in this transformation process, particularly in terms of its
effects on investment in human capital, physical capital and social capital?
The focus of this chapter is on the course and causes of the rapid trans-
formation in income and wealth creation, with the support of some inter-
esting stylized facts and photographs since Independence in 1965
through 2008.

THE ECONOMIC MIRACLE
Per Capital GDP Growth
(a) In US Dollar
In 1965, when Singapore became a fully independent Republic, the
per capita GDP was typical of that of developing countries at US$512
per annum. Today, 43 years later, as per 2007 figures, the per capita
GDP went up by 63.7 times to US$32,624 per annum, typical of that
of the First World. These figures are in nominal US dollars.
(b) In Singapore Dollar
Because of the secular appreciation of the Singapore dollar vis-a-vis the
US dollar between 1965 and 2007, in Singapore dollar terms, the nomi-
nal per capita GDP went up from S$1,567 in 1965 to S$49,182 in 2007,
a reduced increase of 31.4 times as against 63.7 times in US dollar terms.
Growth in GDP Sizes
Below are two figures showing the size of the economy in 1965
compare to its size today, one in real and the other in nominal terms.

Figure 1:
Metamorphosis in real GDP sizes (S$)

Of note is that Singapore’s real GDP in 1965 was only 4% of today’s
GDP. When nominal GDP figures are compared, in 1965, it was only
1% of the present GDP.
Growth in Real GDP Rates
In terms of long-term real growth rate,the average per annum was 7.4%
in US dollars and 5.6% in Singapore dollars. These are spectacular aver-
age compound real per capita growth rates over a period of 43 years.
The speed of growth in Singapore has been about 3 to 4 times the
growth rate of developed economies,with the steady and rapid conver-
gence with the developed economies over time.The year to year real
growth rates from 1961 through 2007 are given in the table below.
Note the gyrations in real growth rates over time, with a low of
−1.4% in 1985 to a high of 13.7% in 1970. The average compound
growth rate for 43 years is 8.1%.
Standards of Living
As shown in Fig. 3, Singapore’s real per capita GDP grew from S$4,668
in 1965 to S$48,158 in 2007 i.e., an increase of 10.3 times. In other

words, deflating for inflation rates to real terms, the general standards
of living in Singapore increased by about 10 times between 1965 and
2007.This is an average figure.It roughly means that half of the families
in Singapore had their standards of living raised by more than 10 times
and the other half by less than 10 times,between 1965 and 2007.
Employment Creation
Concomitant with the spectacular GDP expansion, about 2 million
new jobs have been added to the economy by 2007, when compared
to 1965. Besides, the jobs today fetch higher pay than in 1965; some
are more than 10 times higher today and some less than 10 times.
There has been a spectacular increase in the variety and range of jobs
available in 2008, when compared to 1965.There is a very close cor-
relation between job creation and GDP expansion.
An Economic Miracle
By the growth measures mentioned above, the economic trans-
formation in Singapore between 1965 and 2007 was remarkable,

extraordinary, and very impressive by any standard, whether it be
inter-temporal or international.
How did this extra-ordinary income and wealth creation after
Independence in 1965 come about? This is considered, by the World
Bank,as an economic miracle.
As a result of this economic metamorphosis, the red-spot on the
map called Singapore,now has a GDP in US dollar terms that is surpris-
ingly 87% bigger than five of our rapidly growing beloved neighbors,
and some much bigger neighbors,namely Vietnam,Myanmar,Cambodia,
and Laos combined. Singapore’s total GDP is US$125.3 billion.1 The
combined GDP of the four important neighboring countries men-
tioned above is US$67.0 billion.1This is an unbelievable feat Singapore
has accomplished. Its transformation may be compared to a caterpil-
lar metamorphosing into a butterfly, or as per the S Curve Theory,
from a turtle economy to an elephant economy, a nascent elephant
economy (Lim, 2004) or, in more common parlance, from the Third
World to the First.
STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION
Structurally, the economy was heavily dependent on two pillars at
the time of Independence: the entrepot trade of primary products,
principally of rubber and tin; as a British military base, East of Suez.
After Independence, outward-looking industrialization was bud-
grafted into the old economic framework.As a part of the outward-
looking industrialization process, Singapore successfully established
itself as an important oil-refinery center; as a center for electronic
and pharmaceutic products and a center for maritime products
such as oil-rigs. Rapid industrialization was soon to be accompanied
by three other important developments: (1) Singapore as an interna-
tional transportation and logistic hub;(2) as a financial entrepot;and
(3) as a center for international tourism. Later, two more pillars were
added: (1) Singapore as a regional educational center and (2) as a
regional center for health care and medical services. The last five

pillars are still, in varying degrees, in the rapid expansion phase,
whilst outward-looking industrialization and the old entrepot trade
underwent and still continue to go through important restructuring
and upgrading process.
In entrepot trade,rubber and tin faded into the horizon,to be sub-
stituted by petrol-chemicals, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and other
manufactured goods.
In manufacturing, as in other sectors, the restructuring process
also took the form of more higher valued-added goods in place of
labor-intensive, low value-added products. For example, Singapore
today builds and exports as much as 75% of the oil-rigs in the world,
whereas in the beginning of the industrialization process, low-end
and low-valued added consumer goods like ordinary soaps,soap pow-
der, mosquito coils, rubber slippers, toothbrushes, toothpastes, and
saw-milling were the important job-providers.
On tourism, at the commencement of the rapid development
process, the pessimism for development was so great that it was
rightly thought that only drunken sailors would visit Singapore as
tourists, contrasting with some 10 million international visitors a year
today. With the introduction of the two integrated international
resorts,the numbers are expected to show further increases.
On the financial side, because of our political and social instabil-
ity at that time, there was more fear of money outflow than money
inflow as is happening today. As it is, Singapore’s financial center
today can boast of numerous world-class banks and other world-
class financial institutions. Foreign exchange transactions alone in
a day amount to some US$159 billion and a monthly turnover of
US$3.3 trillion.
Of course,the growth of Singapore as a high value-added,outward-
looking manufacturing base, an international tourism hub, a finan-
cial emporium, a regional educational center, a regional health-care
center, and a super trading emporium must go hand in hand with
Singapore emerging as an international shipping center as well as
an international aviation center. The equally rapid upgrading in
domestic transportation, including the MRT, and communications
including computer suaveness and ubiquitous usage, are all integral

parts of the overall economic transformation process. Each develop-
ment builds on the other developments in a circular cumulative
upward surge.
Singapore’s miraculous structural transformation is shown in
Fig.4.
In other words, Singapore’s overall economic pie expanded in
real GDP terms by an average compound rate of 8.1% per year for the
last 43 years.This is a very impressive, record-breaking achievement
by any standard. More than that, Singapore’s rapid rate of growth in
income and wealth has been achieved with price stability, huge accu-
mulation of foreign exchange reserves, a stable and strong Singapore
dollar, full employment for most of the 43 years, a very high savings
function and the most enviable balance of payments surpluses.
Singapore’s unemployment rate is 2.7%, one of the very lowest in the
world. Germany, for example, which is the biggest economy and one
of the most dynamic countries in Europe, has an unemployment
rate of 8.1% and France also has an unemployment rate of 8.1%.
Singapore has been transformed from a low value-added, labor

METAMORPHOSIS IN EXTERNAL BALANCE
Some countries, including the USA, have recently achieved a very
high standard of living partly through the accumulation of foreign
debts.This is not the case in Singapore. Singapore has become very
much a creditor nation,than a debtor country. Again,some countries,
including the USA, have achieved a very high standard of living but
have serious balance of payments deficit.Again this is not the case in
Singapore. Singapore has one of the highest balance of payments sur-
pluses on current account in the world, reaching 25.5% of GDP in
2007. Incidentally, not many of us are aware that from 1965 up to
1987,Singapore normally ran a sizable balance of payments deficit on
current account,culminating at 32.2% of GDP in 1971.
METAMORPHOSIS IN SAVINGS FUNCTION
Singapore has one of the highest savings rates in the world, constitut-
ing 46.3% of GDP in 2006. However, not many of us are aware that at
one time, Singapore had a negative savings function. In 1960, for
example, our savings rate was minus 2.4% of GDP. At times, I come
across the claim that Singapore has a high average and marginal
propensity to save, because of its compulsory savings system under
its very important CPF scheme. This claim is erroneous. It is just
another statistical fallacy. CPF compulsory savings constitute only
11% of GDP. The rest, the other savings, constitute 89% of GDP. The
other savings take the form of the enviable private sector company
surpluses, public sector surpluses, GLC surpluses, and surpluses in
individual and household accounts (Hsieh, 2002). Incidentally, it is
this very high accumulation of savings that has enabled the Singapore
Government to contribute importantly to global welfare by lending
to world famous financial institutions caught in the prevailing sub-
prime crisis. These world famous financial institutions in difficulty
include UBS,the Citigroup and Merrill Lynch.

GROWTH ACCOUNTING
Earlier,we mentioned that about 2 million new jobs were added to the
economy between 1965 and 2007. However, this impressive expan-
sion in labor input may reflect only quantitative expansion.The quanti-
tative expansion includes more housewives going out to work and
more foreign workers being employed.There was,however,important
qualitative expansion as well,not apparent from the figures. According
to my own research estimate, 78% of Singapore’s miraculous eco-
nomic expansion could be attributed to increase in labor productivity
and only 22% to the increase in labor input (Lim and Lee,2002).
Gauti Eggertsson of the IMF, who made a special study on
Singapore’s growth prospects, reported in 2004 that, between 1990
and 2003, the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) accounted for 26% of
the actual growth of GDP in Singapore, compared with the corre-
sponding average of 20% for the Industrial Countries.The rest of the
growth in Singapore was contributed by Labor (19%), Capital (41%)
and Education (13%) (Eggertsson, 2004; Ghesquiere, 2007).
Dr Eggertsson’s figures and Professor Hsieh’s seminal research paper
(Hsieh, 2002) both contradict earlier publications of very negligible
or no TFP growth for Singapore (Lall et al.,1996).
VISUAL GLIMPSES
We are living in an audio-visual age. I have thus far only share with
you some important macro-economic statistics, to show the reality
and extent of our economic transformation. Perhaps now, I should
share with you some photographs on a few other facets of the
transformation.

Exhibit 3 shows, by way of contrast, the modern public housing

own their own homes. There are no more frightening ubiquitous
slums that existed before. Shenton Way, for example, was a slum area.
Today, it is one of the most expensive pieces of real estate in
Southeast Asia.

tongkang trade and tongkang workers of one student who later
became a famous and well-accomplished Permanent Secretary in
Singapore.

ocean-going ships per year use the narrow Straits of Singapore today.
THREE CRITICAL OPTIONS
What basic policy alternatives have Singapore adopted to enhance its
international competitiveness? What basic policy options have
Singapore pursued to bring about the economic transformation mira-
cle? These two closely related questions will be briefly discussed
under three broad headings:
(1) the option for a market-oriented, outward-looking economic
policy;
(2) the option for the most impressive investment in physical capital,
human capital and social capital;and
(3) the most important one,the option for and the active promotion of
an able,stable,people-oriented,development-oriented,corruption-
free,innovative Government and bureaucracy.
(1) Market-Orientation
A market-oriented outward-looking policy is critical for Singapore’s
transformation, if the alternative is a command or a completely state-
managed economy or economic autarky. Market orientation ensures
the optimum use of scarce resources in the production and exchange
of goods and services. Outward-lookingness ensures Singapore oper-
ates and competes in the global environment.The price mechanism,
or the invisible hand, equilibrates supply and demand. Production is
for the market, global market. Price is determined by supply and
demand. High prices are signals of shortages, and low prices are
signals of over-supply.
Thus, Singapore’s enormous external visible trade is surprisingly
even much higher, some 88% higher, than that of all the countries in
the Indian Sub-Continent combined.This huge complex multi-lateral
Transformation in the Singapore Economy
17

trading system cannot take place and could not have taken place
without the invisible hand and the outward-orientation of the econ-
omy. External trade has been handled almost exclusively by the pri-
vate sector. Even when only Singapore’s domestic exports are
considered, surprisingly, they still exceed the gross exports of the
important countries in the vast fast-expanding Indian Sub-Continent
combined. Incidentally, trade, including international trade, takes
place on a willing-buyer and willing-seller basis,and both parties ben-
efit in the exchange. International trade, both visible and invisible
trade,reflects one of Singapore’s most important roles in the regional
and global economy. Nor could the other important facets of the
Singaporean economy develop without the whole-hearted commit-
ment in the pursuit of the outward-looking, and market-orientation
policy and strategy.
The ubiquitous Government-linked Corporations (GLCs) could
not have played such a critical role in Singapore’s economic transfor-
mation process, had they remained purely as Government
Departments or Statutory Boards.The Singapore Government-created
GLCs are subject to the economic calculus of market forces, and
guided by the invisible hand. Like other private sector corporations,
they operate under the Companies Act and the Singapore Exchange
Listing Rules,including having their own independent board of direc-
tors, internal and external audit checking system, own nomination,
remuneration and audit committees.The GLCs also report directly to
their shareholders with quarterly, half-yearly and yearly reports pub-
lished for all to see and evaluate. They too pay the usual company
taxes and their employees, the usual personal income tax and other
taxes.Besides,the anxiety of GLCs to relocate to other countries in an
economic downturn is zero. Their assets to the extent that their
shares are state-owned, continue to belong to the State, or
Singaporeans. Also, Singaporeans and others are free to own their
shares, and prosper with the GLCs, as they fly high in the economic
firmament in and outside Singapore.
The virtues of the GLCs are deliberately paraded because, they
are Singapore-created growth agencies and are often denigrated by
some laisser-fairists both inside and outside Singapore. The IMF, for
18
Lim Chong Yah

example, wants to know more about the GLCs in Singapore. They
commissioned two economists to investigate and report on them.
The two economists express the view that GLCs in Singapore are
very successful, viable, profit-making commercial organizations, with-
out the need for State subsidy for their operation and success.They
vindicated our GLCs as very successful market-oriented state capi-
talism (Ramirez and Tan, 2003). Incidentally, GLCs include listed
iconic-companies like SIA, SINGTEL, DBS, NOL, Keppel Corporation,
Sembawang Corporation, Keppel Land, Capital Land, and the unlisted
one, PSA. Indeed, many GLCs qualify, from the extent of their regional
and global operations, as Singapore’s MNCs. SIA, SINGTEL, Keppel
Corporation, Sembawang Corporation, and ST Engineering are cases
in point.
Similarly,without market-orientation and outward-orientation,for-
eign MNCs, which also play a critical role in Singapore’s rapid trans-
formation,particularly in the industrial sector,would not have a place
in the Singapore economy. In short, without outward-looking market-
orientation, neither the foreign MNCs nor the home-grown GLCs
could have flourished.Singapore’s domestic market is small.That how-
ever, can also become an asset.Any company established in Singapore
has to face the full blast of international competition straight away.
SIA, a GLC, is often cited as an example. Internal commercial flight by
high-speed jet commercial planes such as from Changi to Tuas is not
economical, even if technically possible. Keppel FELS and Sembawang
Marine, both GLCs, for example, build, inter-alia, oil rigs for exports
only;there being no oil wells in Singapore for oil rigs.
(2) Investment, Investment and Investment
The economic system needs a progressive increase in investment:
human capital investment, physical capital investment and social
capital investment.The need for appropriate physical capital invest-
ment is well-known, including in the supporting public sector, such
as the MRT, the road system, the seaports and the airports.The need
for human capital investment is less obvious, partly because of the
longer gestation period required. But for sustained and sustainable
Transformation in the Singapore Economy
19

development,human capital investment is a sine qua non to success.
More than that, its appropriate human capital investment mix is also
critical. Singapore has done very well indeed both in physical capital
investment and in human capital investment both in quantity as well
as in quality and in the capital mix.Together, the physical and human
capital investments have enabled the transformation,or the metamor-
phosis,in Singapore to take place.
More investment means more job opportunities, more income
and more savings.They in turn bring in more investments and more
employment creation in an upward circular cumulative causation
process.
Quantitatively, in 1965, the total value of Singapore’s capital stock
is estimated by Dr Sng Hui Ying, when she was my Ph.D student, as
S$21 billion. Singapore’s capital stock went up to S$795 billion by
2004 (Sng,2007).The enormous increase in capital input explains the
enormous increase in income output. Investment can in turn be
decomposed into domestic private investment, foreign direct invest-
ment (FDI) and public investment.All three parameters have gone up
by leaps and bounds. All three, particularly domestic private invest-
ment and foreign investment, have reacted to the outward-looking,
market-oriented policy and strategy in Singapore.
Singapore’s human capital stock has also metamorphosed. The
very narrow domestic talent pyramid at the apex has also become
very much broader, with about 70% of the school cohorts opting for
higher education today,compared to 6% in 1965.
Social capital here refers to institutional building, such as the pro-
motion of ethnic harmony, religious respect, tripartism among the
unions, the employers and the Government, and the common pursuit
of meritocracy.Together,they contribute critically to the building of a
favorable economic climate for investment to flourish. One should
quickly add that a good investment climate also includes fundamental
prerequisites like the rule of law,equal protection before the law,pro-
tection of property rights and an effective, impartial and non-corrupt
judicial system.
Two other important policy options that have important growth-
enhancing and growth-promoting side effects need to be mentioned
20

here:(1) the institution of national service following Independence.If
a small, new nation, a city state, is not prepared to defend itself,
defend its newly-won sovereignty,its people and its property,investor
confidence in that nation will decline, particularly in a not-that-stable
Southeast Asian political environment. (2) the choice of using English
as the working language in administration,in the courts and in institu-
tions of learning. The wide-spread mastery of the English language
gives Singapore and Singaporeans an important edge in the globalised
world;in trade,commerce,industry,knowledge acquisition and global
social connectivity. Bilingualism, however, gives us an important cul-
tural ballast,particularly as an Asian nation in Asia.
(3) Good Public Governance
Earlier, we spoke of the importance of the invisible hand in the
transformation process. Now, we should speak of the equal impor-
tance of a good supporting visible hand. If the two hands clap in
unison, they produce effective joyful sound.Alone, they are useless.
The ying and the yang must not just be side by side.They must be
like opposites that complement.They must support each other in a
symbiotic relationship. In Singapore, both hands work together.
Both ying and yang complement, each re-enforcing the other in
a virtuous cycle of job creation, poverty eradication and more
and greater affluence. Working together, the economy surges for-
ward.The nature, the extent, and above all, the quality of State inter-
vention, is critical. Markets are made for man and not man for
the markets.A market-only policy can often create more problems
than what a modern civilized society can handle. Market failures
and market imperfections often justify State interventions and State
initiatives.
At the apex of the human determinants of development is the
Government and its accompanying and supporting bureaucracy.
Government decides on the policy options, whether to have MNCs,
GLCs, government agencies like EDB, NWC, SDF, HDB, and CPF, free
trade, outward-looking market orientation, meritocracy, employment
creation, or none of these. It is also the Government that decides on
Transformation in the Singapore Economy
21

the type of monetary system, the exchange rate regime, the fiscal pol-
icy,the meritocratic practice,the welfare and workforce system.
It is the Government that decides on all important creations and
operations of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation
Pte Ltd (GIC) and the Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited.They are
today referred to as sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). Because of the
success of our GLC, China has also set up a similar body called
Chinese Investment Corporation (CIC). If the Chinese character for
human,“ ”, can be used as an analogy, Government is at the apex or
head, without which there is no functioning society, like a human
without a head. The society could function only like a headless
chicken, and the headless chicken could go nowhere, maybe round
and round before collapse. Thus, the aptitude and attitude of the
Government, particularly its integrity and management ability, is criti-
cal in the transformation process. A corrupt and incompetent
Government would be unable to lead the economy out of poverty
and low-level equilibrium trap. Some years ago, going against the
trend in economic literature, in a book called Development and
Underdevelopment,I postulated that “Government, good Government
often holds the key to rapid economic development”, particularly in
developing economies (Lim, 1991). Many, many years later, I still hold
firmly to the same view. The world, in particular the World Bank,
appears to increasingly share this perception and approach.
In other words, a stable, able and development-oriented
Government is critical in the rapid developmental process. However,
the people, particularly the businessmen, merchants, industrialists,
entrepreneurs,unions,and the workers too each have their important
role to play in the process of economic upliftment. Nonetheless,
labor and capital must work together not against, their legitimate
elected Government to create the economic miracle. In Singapore,
this togetherness among the three social partners is often referred to
as tripartisim. This tripartite symbiotic relationship, partnership,
is critical to the metamorphosis of the Singapore economy from
Third World to First, from a basket-case to a show-case state, from
a per capita income of US$512 per annum in 1965 to US$32,624
per annum in 2007,and from the old economy to the new economy.

Lim Chong Yah

To conclude,Singapore has been succeeding miraculously against
all odds for the last 43 years since Independence,because throughout
the 43 years Singapore has had and is still having an able, stable, non-
corrupt, development-oriented Government, and has been choosing
the road of an outward-looking, market-based, meritocratic economy
and society, besides being populated with a hard-working, pragmatic
and achievement-oriented people in a strategic location in South-East
Asia and in the world.

Innovation, Markets and Economic
Growth: A Symbiosis
Lam Chuan Leong
Innovation is now accepted by economists as essential to economic
growth. It is therefore very important to understand what factors fos-
ter the rate of innovation and sustain it.
A DETAILED LOOK AT INNOVATION
O-Type Innovation and V-Type Innovation
Innovation may be classified into two types: O-type and V-type inno-
vation. O-type innovation is aimed at refining existing products or
ideas through the application of codified knowledge.The long educa-
tional and schooling process of humans is intended to equip them to
acquire and apply codified knowledge to undertake O-type innova-
tion. Examples of this are studies in engineering, medicine, or any
other professional courses.
In contrast,V-type innovation is a creative process,aimed at creat-
ing new products, inventions and ideas, not known before. These
innovations are not arrived at, through a systematic rational process
25

using known scientific or social “laws”. Much of this innovation is a
process of an association of ideas, connecting different ideas to come
up with a new one. For e.g., the Walkman is a V-type innovation as
defined here.It is the idea of combining a sound reproduction system
with the idea of portability.Adding the idea of a small sound produc-
tion apparatus to the idea of small earphones led to the great inven-
tion of the Walkman. This idea has become so popular that its
descendants today in the form of the MP3 players are widely used.
The Innovation Cycle and Economic Growth
O-type innovation needs V-type innovation to supply new product
ideas to improve upon. V-type innovations need a lot of work by
O-type innovation, to make the initial product better appealing to the
mass market.V- and O-type innovations therefore work in tandem to
create “The Innovation Cycle” (see Fig. 1) to bring about the great
variety of products that define the standard of living in the modern
economy. History shows that economic growth and prosperity are
strongest during those periods when there is a surge of new ideas
and inventions brought about by innovation, e.g., the growth cycles
following the invention of the steam engine, the motor car, the use of

electric power, and the railroads. Hence the innovation cycle can be
considered one of the engines for economic growth.
INNOVATION AND MARKETS — A SYMBIOSIS
A new idea is of no use unless the invention that follows from it can
be turned into a product and brought to the market.Many factors can
impede this process and make a country less innovative than it
should be. On the other hand, economic policies and practices are in
a position to improve the conditions under which innovation has a
better chance of success.The factors that improve the chances of suc-
cess of innovations can be grouped under 4 headings:
•
Free diffusion of information and knowledge;
•
Free market entry and exit;
•
An ex-poste market “selection system”;and
•
Sustaining reward system.
Free Diffusion of Information and
Diffusion of Knowledge
A free flow and diffusion of information is critical to innovation. Cut
off from previous knowledge, even great geniuses would have to re-
invent the wheel.The supply of new ideas would therefore be very
slow. One reason for the rapid rise in innovation in the last two cen-
turies is the tremendous improvements in transportation and commu-
nications. During the last 20 years, the advent of information
technology and the Internet have enabled information to be diffused
widely and at very low cost.This has tremendously accelerated the
pace of change and innovation.
Free Market Entry and Exit
The cost and difficulty of setting up companies vary from country
to country.Those countries, like Singapore, which make it easy for
people to start businesses and have fewer rules restricting their
Innovation, Markets and Economic Growth
27

behavior, will favor innovators because, it would be easier for them
to set up a business entity to commercialize their inventions.India is
an example of a country with an onerous licencing regime and
restrictive regulations that impede the setting up of businesses and
thus reduces the rate of innovation and its commercialization.
Consequently, it grows possibly at a lower rate than its potential
(William et al., 2007). China during its days of central planning did
not allow private business startups. Commercialization of innova-
tion was almost non-existent and the economic growth was
retarded. For innovation to flourish, freedom from distortions,
restrictions, controls and barriers to entry either by governments or
from monopolistic practices, exclusive contracts, etc, by firms,
should be minimized.
Besides ease of entry into the product and business markets, the
existence of capital or financial markets to limit, transfer or spread
risks are also conducive to innovation. These markets provide the
means to limit the financial loss of failure to the innovator because,
he can raise capital from other investors to share the financial risk
with him. Furthermore, in the event that the innovation is a great
success,the inventor can sell his invention to reap the rewards of his
success and exit from the business to concentrate on some other
activity.
An Ex-Poste Market “Selection System”
An innovator must be assured of a “fair” chance of being chosen for
success for his efforts.The free market is a better impartial “selection
system” than one, where the selection is done by a panel of individu-
als or experts. Market selection is ex-poste in contrast to the ex-ante
judgement of experts.The danger of depending on ex-ante selection
lies in the inability of humans to predict the future from the trends of
the past. History is full of mistaken prognoses of innovations by
“experts” who fail to correctly assess the potential of a truly novel
idea. For e.g., a British Parliamentary Committee commenting on
Thomas Edison’s light bulb said,“… good enough for our transatlantic
friends … but unworthy of the attention of practical or scientific
28
Lam Chuan Leong

men”. Edison himself said “Fooling around with alternating current is
just a waste of time.Nobody will use it,ever”.1Today,life is impossible
without alternating current.
Capital markets, venture capital funds and angel funds that seek
out emergent innovations and are prepared to take higher risks,play a
critical bridging role between the initial idea and eventual success in
the market place.These funds select innovation ex-poste at different
stages of their development,and are managed by risk takers and entre-
preneurs who thrive on diversity and risks. It is therefore not surpris-
ing that innovations such as Yahoo, Google, etc, thrive in the Silicon
Valley where the capital and product markets converge so favorably.
Sustaining Reward System
Whilst a large part of an innovator’s reward may be psychological and
non-material, he certainly would enjoy and deserve the material
rewards that accompany his success. Such material rewards have to

“There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home”.

– Western Union internal memo, 1876
“The wireless music box has no imaginable commercial value.Who would pay

be protected and sustained if innovation is to be encouraged. Hence,
transparency of the reward system and a sound legal and institutional
framework in which individuals are protected against arbitrary incur-
sions on their property and other economic rights especially,intellec-
tual property rights,is vital.Alan Greenspan has explained in eloquent
detail why these requirements constitute a crucial pillar of a success-
ful economy (Greenspan,2007).
Sustaining the reward system is not confined to a respect for
property rights. Overly high rates of income taxation have the effect
of expropriating the innovator’s return. From the innovation angle,
taxation on consumption is favored over income taxation. A taxation
regime that is non-transparent or changed arbitrarily also increases
risks to the innovator.
SINGAPORE’S RECORD
Singapore performs well on all 4 criteria mentioned above except for,
the criterion of market size. Information and knowledge flow freely
throughout the economy with rare exceptions (mainly on social
grounds).The education system does an excellent job of O-type inno-
vation training, up to tertiary levels and beyond. Foreign companies
and invesors are encouraged to bring in their technology, skills and
people (with skills) along with their investments and they can oper-
ate in Singapore, with practically no restrictions. New companies can
be set up in Singapore, with the greatest of ease and at low cost.
Economic policies are chosen on sound economic rational principles
based on the freely competing market model,except where there are
over-riding social reasons. Free competition is assured consistently
through policies and by legislation. Property rights are enforced and
stability of that protection is ensured.Tax policies have increasingly
favored production rather than consumption and the tax rates on
income have been progressively reduced. There are no arbitrary
changes in tax laws.
On the negative side, Singapore’s economy per se does not have
the size, breadth or depth of markets (both physical and financial) to
sustain a high rate of V-type innovation.V-type innovation is a function
30
Lam Chuan Leong

of diversity which in turn is related to size and scale. This point is
illustrated by Bill Gates’ observation that Microsoft would put a
research center only in places with a population of 1 billion or more,
hence one center each for China,India and Europe.2
Improved education, skills and knowledge can multiply the effec-
tiveness of O-type innovation but these measures can do little for
V-type innovation. This explains why the state has chosen to inter-
vene by offering grants in aid to companies and research centers as a
means of compensating for the market weakness in support of V-type
innovation.This approach is sensible but the danger of ex-ante plan-
ning even with the best of intentions should be noted.
The book “Good Capitalism, Bad Capitalism”, analyses 4 types of
capitalism:state-guided capitalism,oligarchic capitalism,big-firm capi-
talism, and entrepreneurial capitalism. It concluded that entrepre-
neurial capitalism is best for promoting and sustaining long term
growth (William et al.,2007).The authors envisaged that an economy
with many (usually small) entrepreneurial firms provides the where-
withal to generate long term economic growth and prosperity in col-
laboration with the bigger firms which are more likely to be in a
position to refine the innovations from the smaller firms.This is very
similar to the conclusion drawn from the analysis of the innovation
cycle above.The book also concluded that state-guided capitalism is
not necessarily optimal for sustained high growth, particularly when
the country has already attained a relatively advanced level of devel-
opment. Singapore’s economy is classified as a form of state-guided
capitalism and by implication,its growth should be less than optimal.
Singapore proves to be an exception and enjoys high rates of
growth because, its economy should not be viewed as an entity by
itself but as part of a global network. Since the 1960’s, Singapore has
opened up its economy and welcomed MNCs and Foreign Direct
Investments so as to plug itself into the global economy and in partic-
ular, the US economy.This approach was so contrary to the conven-
tional economic wisdom of the 1960’s that, many experts called it a
“folly”.
Innovation, Markets and Economic Growth
31

Singapore thus becomes a part of the global networked economy
and shares the benefit of growth powered by the larger, transnational
innovation cycle.The need to plug into the global innovation cycle
therefore provided another reason for the open trade and investment
policies pursued by Singapore in addition to the usual argument for
free trade, based on David Ricardo’s theorem of comparative advan-
tage and specialization in production.
Plugging into this innovation cycle is more than just engaging in
trade. It involves actively encouraging foreign companies from coun-
tries with well-developed markets to bring their technology (O-type
innovation) and research activities (V-type innovation) to Singapore.
By coming to Singapore, these companies bring with them their
knowledge and access of markets as well as their knowledge of emer-
gent innovations overseas.They act like “transport agents”connecting
Singapore into the cycle of innovation and information exchange
with their home markets in addition to their production and trading
activities.
The huge importing power of the US market has given rise to the
saying that “when the US economy sneezes, the rest of the world
catches a cold”. The current analysis shows that it is not just raw
importing power that matters. It is that the US provides large, sophis-
ticated markets for the innovation cycle to work and then the process
of free trade and cross-border investments spread the innovation and
production gains to other countries that freely trade with it.3
Conversely, innovation is needed to drive and sustain economic
growth and hence markets.This gives rise to the symbiotic relation-
ship between markets and innovation. Innovation needs markets as
much as markets need innovation.
Since innovation is so crucial for long economic growth and
so symbiotically linked to markets, policy makers in government
have to pay careful attention to how their policies affect the flow of

3 Of course whether the US will continue to play this role is the subject of another
topic.It is conceivable that some other regions or countries may take over this role of
“economic engine”. For the moment, however, the US continues a play a big role in
this process.

information, the structure of their markets, and the regulations and
institutions concerning property rights.

Macro Objectives of the Central
Provident Fund (CPF): A Review
Chew Soon Beng and Rosalind Chew*
This chapter examines the changing roles of the CPF scheme as the
Singapore economy develops, society matures and globalization intensi-
fies.The original purpose of the scheme was to encourage saving for old
age but it was extended to cover the goal of home ownership which rein-
forces savings. However, the CPF scheme was also used as an instrument
to increase labor cost to motivate employers to better manage the use of
labor in the late 1970s and early 1980s,which boosted the residential mar-
kets, and used as a cost-cutting devise to reduce labor cost in 1986, which
compromised the goals of the CPF.Since the mid-1990s,as a result of glob-
alization,the wages of low-income Singaporeans were tied to the wages of
those countries with a huge labor surplus such as China and India.
Consequently, the income gap has been widening in Singapore.Today, the
goal of the CPF scheme is to ensure that low-income Singaporeans have
sufficient savings to see them through old age, which is a challenge, as
life expectancy has increased and the markets for low-wage jobs have
diminished.

many aspects of the CPF scheme.Usual disclaimers apply.

THE CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND SCHEME,
(1955–65): STATUS QUO
The Central Provident Fund (CPF) scheme was set up in 1955 to
serve as the main form of social security for workers after retirement
in Singapore (Lim et al., 1986 gives an extensive discussion on social
security schemes and the CPF). It is a compulsory saving scheme
required by law of all employees. In 1995, under the CPF scheme, an
employee with a monthly pay of, e.g., S$100 must, according to the
law, contribute 5 percent of his pay towards his CPF account (see
Table 1). At the same time, his employer was also required by law to
contribute, 5 percent of the worker’s pay towards the same account
for the worker. Thus,every month,the employee would have CPF sav-
ings of S$10 and his take-home pay would be S$90. The cost of
employing this worker therefore amounted to S$110. The cost of
employing the worker is therefore affected by the employer’s contri-
bution rate. Consequently, a wage ceiling was put in place, and it was
initially set at S$500.This means that, for a person earning S$600 a
month, for instance, his employer would still contribute 5% of S$500
instead of 5% of S$600. The monthly wage ceiling aims to prevent
labor costs from escalating beyond proportion.
CPF members could not withdraw their CPF saving until the age
of 55.The CPF Board invests the CPF money in government stocks
and pays the CPF member an interest of 2.5% per annum on his CPF
balances, with the possibility of the interest rate rising to as high as
5% (CPF 2004). As the rate of 2.5% is assured by the CPF Board, it is
considered a high rate of return for a riskless investment.
Many workers voiced their dissatisfaction with the fact that they
could not drawn on their CPF saving in emergencies such as unem-
ployment and sickness, but the CPF Board stood firm (The Straits
Times, 21 April 1955). On hindsight, the CPF decision has been the
correct one. Had the CPF funds been allowed to be drawn for emer-
gencies,the CPF scheme would have been a failure as workers would
withdraw their CPF saving for one reason or another. Later in the
chapter, we will compare the western countries’ unemployment ben-
efit scheme with the CPF scheme.

Singapore obtained self-government in 1959, joined Malaysia in
1963 and became an independent country in 1965. Being a young
nation, the Singapore government had many pressing issues, such as
unemployment and housing, to worry about (Goh, 1972; Seng and
Lim, 1984). Consequently, the CPF system as the main form of social
security scheme for old age was not altered in terms of contribution
rates and structure, but the CPF interest rate was increased for the
first time in 1963 from 2.5% to 5% per annum.
HOME OWNERSHIP
During the two years as Malaysia and Singapore experienced two
racial riots, it was thought that political and social stability would
be enhanced when citizens have a stake in the economy by way
of home ownership. Hence, the massive housing programme to relo-
cate residents from the housing slums to government-built Housing
Development Board (HDB) flats was intensified immediately after
independence (Lim and Associates, 1988). In 1968, to enable all
employed citizens to own an HDB flat, CPF members were allowed
to use their CPF balance to finance the mortgage of HDB flats (CPF
2004). Hence, since its inception in 1955, the CPF scheme has served

two objectives: (1) saving for old age/disablement and (2) the politi-
cal objective of promoting home ownership.The following quotation
from Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the founding Prime Minister of Singapore and
currently the Minister Mentor, underscores the importance of home
ownership:
“The CPF and home ownership have ensured political stability, the foun-
dation upon which Singapore grew and developed without interruption
for more than 30 years in from Third World to First”.(Lee,2000)
The CPF scheme therefore became more complex. CPF contributors
were not allowed to withdraw their CPF saving before age 55, but
there was no age limit on their use of CPF saving to buy an HDB flat.
As a result, practically every married man who had a full-time job
would apply to buy an HDB flat (singles initially were not allowed to
buy HDB flats).
The CPF rate was indirectly tied to the price of an HDB flat. In
order to provide decent HDB flats, the cost of constructing the HDB
flats was high, and therefore the prices of the flats, had to be raised.
This meant that the CPF contribution rate had to be high enough to
cover the financing of a mortgage on an HDB flat. In 1968 the CPF
contribution rates were therefore accordingly raised for employees
and employers to 6.5%.At the same time, the monthly wage ceiling
was raised to S$2,307.95, almost five times the $500 ceiling in 1955
(Lim et al., 1986). Although this meant that labor costs were much
higher, employers at that time did not complain, as the economy was
facing a labor shortage.
In 1970, the government saw the need to raise the CPF contribu-
tion rate to 8% for both employers and employees;but to mitigate the
increase in labor costs, the wage ceiling was reduced to S$1,875. In
1971, the government again raised the CPF contribution rates to 10%
and at the same time lowered the wage ceiling to S$1,500. It should
be noted that in 1972, pensionable government officers were
required to make CPF contributions at a reduced rate (but this chap-
ter focuses on employees in the private sector). In 1974, due to the
extremely tight labor market, both the CPF contribution rates for

39

employers and employees were raised to 15% and the wage ceiling
increased to S$2,000.
It is obvious that the CPF scheme was biased in favor of residen-
tial investment. Indeed, many Singaporean households emptied their
CPF balances to finance HDB mortgages.At the same time, the gov-
ernment also encouraged Singaporean households to upgrade from a
small unit to a larger unit. It was thought that excessive investment
in residential property was slightly inconsistent with the original
objective of the CPF scheme which was purely to provide for old age
living and disablement (many studies examine the housing issue and
other economic issues,including Lim and Associates 1988 and Krause
et al., 1987).
SPLIT OF THE CPF ACCOUNT
In 1977, to address this problem, the CPF account was divided into
two accounts, the Ordinary Account and Special Account. The CPF
saving in the Ordinary Account could be used to finance the mort-
gage of a purchase of a HDB flat while the CPF saving in the Special
Account was not allowed to be used. In the same year, the govern-
ment also raised the CPF contribution rates to 15.5% each. Of the
total 31%, 30% was allocated to the Ordinary Account and 1% the
Special Account.Interestingly,in 1978,CPF members were allowed to
use up to S$5,000 from the Ordinary Account for the purchase of
shares.This reflected a new government policy to enable citizens to
have a bigger stake in the economy by allowing more people to own
other assets including shares,besides properties.
CPF AS AN ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING TOOL
Right from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, the Singapore economy
encountered a labor shortage due to its success in attracting labor-
intensive industries. Since labor costs were not high at that time, the
economy attracted mainly labor-intensive industries which in turn
increased the demand for low-wage labor, many of whom were
foreign labor. In the late 1970s, when China was in the midst of
40
Chew Soon Beng and Rosalind Chew

formulating its economic reform strategy, the Singapore government
became aware of the danger of being caught in a low-wage trap and
saw the immediate need to restructure the manufacturing sector
towards more high-skilled and capital-intensive technology. To encour-
age employers to shift to more high-skilled and capital-intensive
methods, the government raised labor costs by increasing the CPF
contribution rates to 16.5% in 1978 and raising the wage ceiling to
S$3,000. At the same time,the Skills Development Fund was set up to
provide subsidies to encourage employers to train their workers (for
an extensive examination of this economic restructuring issue, see
Lim,1984).
HOME PROTECTION INSURANCE SCHEME
USING CPF SAVING
In 1981, the home ownership plan was widened to include private
properties (non-HDB flats).Hence,CPF members were allowed to use
their saving in the Ordinary Account for the purchase of private prop-
erties. However, few people bought residential properties without a
housing mortgage.There was this danger that a family could lose the
residential property if its bread-winner dies early and the family could
not continue to pay the monthly installment. Hence, in late 1981, it
was legislated that the saving in the Ordinary Account could also be
used to pay for the premium for the Home Protection Insurance
Scheme (HPIS). HPIS guarantees the true meaning of home owner-
ship for the family.
The rise in CPF contribution rates and the higher wage ceiling
reinforced the original objective of the CPF, which is to ensure that
Singaporeans have sufficient money including assets for retirement.
Employed Singaporeans had never had it so good. Hence, to meet
the many demands on the CPF funds, the CPF contribution rates
were raised to 23% for both employer and employee in 1983. In
March 1984, CPF members were allowed to use their saving in the
Ordinary Account for the purchase of second properties.This new
policy initiative went beyond the objective of home ownership. It
aimed to encourage Singaporean families to continue to work hard,
Macro Objectives of the Central Provident Fund (CPF): A Review
41

which is the inevitable outcome if they had more than one housing
mortgage.
AFFORDABLE HEALTH AS THE NEW OBJECTIVE
OF THE CPF SCHEME
In the late 1970s, besides worrying about China’s implementation of
economic reform, the Singapore government was also alerted by the
fact that healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP was rising in the
developed countries. Although there are many reasons contributing
to the rapid rise in healthcare spending, the price for the use of
healthcare facilities was distorted in the West. Accordingly, the
Singapore government started to restructure the public hospitals.
The inevitable outcome was to raise the price of usage of hospitals to
stem unwanted and unjustified demands and usages. At the same
time, the government was aware that some Singaporeans might have
a problem paying for the new charges.
Hence, the CPF scheme was restructured into three accounts, the
Ordinary Account,the Special Account and the newly-added Medisave
Account.The CPF balance in the Medisave account could be used to
meet the expenses of hospitalization.At the same time, the CPF con-
tribution rates for employers and employees were further raised to
25% in 1984.All of the resulting additional six percentage would be
channeled into the Medisave Account.As the wage ceiling of the CPF
scheme was also raised to S$5,000 in 1984 and to S$6,000 in 1985,
labor costs in Singapore were considered high.
The CPF balance in the Medisave Account was originally intended
to cover the cost of use of public hospitals, but in 1985 the Medisave
Scheme was extended to include use of private hospitals. The
Medisave Account is actually meant for the family, as the greater part
of the expenses of hospitalization for a male employee, his wife and
his children under the age of 18 years would be paid by his employer.
However, in the case of a female employee, coverage for her children
and her spouse are not included in her fringe benefits scheme.Hence
the money in the Medisave Account would be expedient in the event
of the hospitalization of a spouse, child or a parent. The Medisave
42
Chew Soon Beng and Rosalind Chew

Account has a ceiling of S$5,000. Once it is reached, the monthly
share of Medisave Account will be channeled to the Ordinary
Account. Nevertheless, the creation of the Medisave Account added
one more objective to the CPF scheme, which is to ensure that
healthcare is affordable and sustainable (see Tan and Chew 1997 for a
discussion on healthcare issues).
CPF AS A PRINCIPAL TOOL FOR THE REDUCTION
OF LABOR COSTS
The Singapore economy grew strongly in early 1985, but exports
began to fall later that year as the global economy went into a reces-
sion. This was exacerbated by the strong Singapore dollar and the
high labor costs (for causes of recession at that time, see Lim and
Associates, 1988).This shows that, for Singapore, quarterly economic
figures are important for decision-making. With the fall in exports,
unemployment surged. As Singapore’s social safety net,which is pro-
vided by the CPF scheme is employment-based, the government had
to decide whether to lower the wage costs immediately, or devalue
Singapore dollar, or institute a western-style social welfare system.
The course decided upon was a reduction of the employer’s CPF
contribution rate from 25% to 10%, with the entire 15% reduction to
be taken from the Ordinary Account. Many Singaporeans were
caught off guard as they had used every dollar in their Ordinary
Account for their housing mortgages and took the maximum amount
of loan permitted to buy properties. Consequently, some of them
could not meet their monthly mortgage payments. However, the gov-
ernment immediately assured the public that the loan period could
be extended by 5 more years if necessary. Nevertheless, the reces-
sion was worsened by the fact that there were many foreclosures in
the property market due to the change in CPF ruling on the
employer’s contribution rate. In 1987, the government realized the
adverse impact and therefore redirected 4 of the percentage points,
which were meant for the Special Account, into the Ordinary
Account, thus restoring the percentage for the Ordinary Account
from 25% to 29% (see Table 1).
Macro Objectives of the Central Provident Fund (CPF): A Review
43

Although the employer’s CPF contribution rate was reduced by
15%, the CPF Board expanded the usage of the CPF scheme. In 1985,
CPF members could use their saving in the Ordinary Account to buy
more than one residential property. In 1986, CPF members were
allowed to use their CPF saving in the Ordinary Account to purchase
non-residential properties,gold,shares and unit trusts.The rationale is
obvious. Although the rate of return on CPF balances is considered
high as it is almost guaranteed, some CPF members wanted a higher
rate of return on their CPF saving. Hence the expanded usage of the
CPF saving was mandated. However, the CPF Board kept reminding
Singaporeans that investment in property, stocks, shares and gold
carry both the opportunity for capital gains and the risk of capital
loss (CPF,2004).
The fact that the CPF scheme was the principal tool to lower
wage costs, leading to the drastic decrease in the employer CPF con-
tribution rate, had compromised the original goal of the CPF which
was to ensure that Singaporeans had sufficient assets for old age (Lim
and Associates,1988).
CPF SAVING AND THE MINIMUM SUM SCHEME
Since the early 1980s,the government became aware that some of the
Singaporeans were not able to effectively manage their CPF saving
when they withdrew it upon reaching the age of 55. Consequently,
for some of them, the lifetime saving did not last long enough.This
caused hardship at the family level. Meanwhile, life expectancy had
increased. At the same time,the government was planning to increase
the retirement age from 55 to 60.Hence,to ensure that CPF members
would have some money at hand to cope with the longer life
expectancy, it was legislated in 1987 that, CPF members must set
aside a minimum sum of S$30,000 in their CPF at the age of 55.There
are three options for CPF members to manage this S$30,000:(1) to buy
a life annuity from a participating insurance company with which
they would be paid a monthly income from age 62 until death, (2) to
deposit the money with a participating bank which would yield an
interest, and the bank would pay the members a monthly income
44
Chew Soon Beng and Rosalind Chew

until the minimum sum is exhausted, (3) to continue to let the CPF
manage the CPF balances with a guaranteed return of 4%.The CPF
again would pay the member a monthly income until the minimum
sum is exhausted. Singaporeans do not like the idea of the annuity as
they feel that they would be short-changed upon early death. Hence,
most people took the CPF option.
The government now encourages CPF members who are about to
receive their retirement payments at the age of 62 to defer with-
drawal to the age of 65. If they agree to defer withdrawal of the
monthly payments to the age of 65, they would get S$600 per year
under the Voluntary Deferment Bonus (VDB).VDB is paid by the gov-
ernment and not the CPF Board.It is estimated that more than 10,000
CPF members will reach 63 or 64 by 2008 and will be entitled to qual-
ify for the VDB.Those who have withdrawn their monthly payments
at the age of 62 or 63 are allowed to return the money to their own
retirement accounts and enjoy the VDB.
CONTROVERSY OVER THE MINIMUM SUM SCHEME
The minimum sum is currently raised to S$99,600. As most people
opted for the CPF saving option,the government feels that many peo-
ple may outlive their savings.Consequently,it has been proposed that
the annuity be made compulsory for CPF members but on a smaller
scale.While the details have not been finalized, the main proposal is
that for those who are not yet 50 years of age, when they reach the
age of 55, they would need to use about S$9,000 to buy an annuity
scheme, for which they would be paid a monthly sum of S$250 start-
ing from the age of 85 until death.The debate focuses on the starting
age for receiving the monthly sum and whether the annuity can be
combined with an element of saving in case the person insured dies
soon after the policy takes effect.
The National Longevity Insurance Committee has proposed to the
government that a compulsory annuity scheme that will provide eld-
erly Singaporeans with a regular income for as long as they live be
introduced in 2013 (Straits Times, 13 February 2008).The salient fea-
tures are as follows: at age 55, the minimum sum will be kept under
Macro Objectives of the Central Provident Fund (CPF): A Review
45

the Retirement Account which is still managed by the CPF Board.One
part will pay for the CPF Life premium.This portion is pooled together
with the premiums of other CPF Life members.The other part remains
in the Retirement Account and earns interest from the CPF Board. For
those whose minimum sum exceeds S$40,000, they will start to
receive an income from the sum in the Retirement Account from the
age of 65 to 80 (actually, the period is flexible).At the age of 80, CPF
members will start to receive an income from CPF Life for life. Should
a CPF member die earlier,there will be a refund,the amount of which
will be equal to the CPF Life premium minus the CPF payouts he had
received.It goes without saying that the payout is greater if there is no
refund. For those whose minimum sum is less than S$40,000, the gov-
ernment has to help to top up the minimum sum.
Workers who qualify for the Workfare programme (which will be
discussed later) are not likely to have much CPF money.In all probabil-
ity, their CPF balances will be less than S$40,000 when they reach the
age of 55.We propose that the government start helping these work-
ers from as early as when they are in their mid-30s, by matching their
CPF contributions proportionally by a factor of, say, 0.5–2 each year,
and channeling this top-up amount into the Special Account to help
them build up their minimum sum. E.g., if the top-up matching factor
is 0.5, if a worker contributes S$500 to his CPF account in a year, the
government will match his contribution by topping up this worker’s
Special Account by S$250. If the top-up matching factor is 2, then the
government will top up his Special Account by S$1,000.As these top-
up matching amounts from the government will only be awarded if
the worker is in employment and as they are channeled into the
worker’s minimum sum,such a policy will motivate workers to remain
in employment. Hopefully, with the implementation of such a top-up,
fewer workers will not have insufficient sum at the age of 55.
RESTORATION OF THE EMPLOYER CPF
CONTRIBUTION RATE SINCE 1988
The recovery from the 1985 recession was, fortunately, almost
immediate.Consequently,the employer’s CPF contribution rate was
46
Chew Soon Beng and Rosalind Chew

raised to 12% in 1988; but in order to give Singaporeans more
disposable income, the employee’s CPF contribution rate was low-
ered from 25% to 24%. Hence, there was 30% for the Ordinary
Account, 0% for the Special Account and 6% for the Medisave
Account. After that year, the Singapore economy consolidated. By
1990, the employer and employee rates had been revised to 16.5%
and 23% respectively. The rate for the Special Account was raised
to 3.5%.
USAGE OF THE CPF EXTENDED TO TERTIARY
EDUCATION
In 1989, for the first time CPF members were allowed to draw their
CPF savings to finance tertiary education in Singapore for themselves
or their children. But the money used for tertiary education, whether
for members themselves or their children, have to be repaid with
interest within 10 years.
LIFE AND MEDICAL INSURANCE INTRODUCED
INTO THE CPF SCHEME
The CPF is a saving scheme, but an insurance element is introduced
into the system when CPF members are able to use their CPF saving
to insure themselves and therefore provide their dependants with
financial protection should death or permanent disability occur.This
was initiated in 1989, when CPF members were permitted to use
their CPF saving to buy a term-life insurance covering members
against death or permanent disability. Furthermore, many CPF mem-
bers even bought personal life insurance with cash, especially when
they purchased private properties.
The money in the Medisave Account and for that matter in the
CPF scheme is inadequate should a member suffer from long-term ill-
ness. Hence, in 1990, CPF members were permitted to use their CPF
money to pay for the premium for MediShield, which is a medical
insurance scheme to help members pay for expenses incurred in
long term and serious illnesses.This scheme was also extended to the
Macro Objectives of the Central Provident Fund (CPF): A Review
47

self-employed in 1992 (again, the CPF scheme is basically meant for
employees in the private sector).
INCREASING THE STAKE IN THE COUNTRY
As home ownership had been successfully achieved by the 1980s,the
government wanted to help Singaporeans increase their stake in the
country.Hence,in 1993,every Singaporean was given a chance to buy
Singapore Telecom shares at a discounted rate using their CPF money,
(Singapore Telecom is a government-linked corporation). For those
who did not have a CPF account or insufficient money in their CPF
account, they could open an account with a minimum deposit of
S$50 or their children or parents could deposit either cash or transfer
their CPF money to their CPF account for them to purchase the
shares.
In 2001, adult Singaporeans who had contributed at least S$50 to
their CPF account during that year would receive between 200 and
1,700 New Singapore Shares (NSS) if they were not employed.This is
social welfare or unemployment benefit. But the money received
went straight into the CPF account to be used either for old age, pay-
ments for housing mortgage or payments for hospitalization. The
same practice was repeated in 2003, when all Singaporeans who had
deposited at least S$50 into their CPF account in the previous year,
received their Economic Restructuring Shares.
DISTRIBUTION OF NATIONAL WEALTH VIA
THE CPF TOP-UP SCHEME
The government encourages all Singaporeans to have a CPF account.
As one form of encouragement, in 1993 the government offered to
transfer S$200 to the CPF account of any Singaporean whose CPF bal-
ance is in excess of S$500.This is known as the CPF Top-Up Scheme.
Many Singaporeans transferred their CPF money to the CPF accounts
of their parents and children to take advantage of this scheme.
The CPF Top-Up exercise was repeated again in 1995.The govern-
ment used the Top-up scheme to distribute national wealth by paying
48
Chew Soon Beng and Rosalind Chew

S$200 to every adult Singaporean’s Ordinary Account. In the same
year, the government also topped up the Medisave Accounts of
Singaporeans aged 61 and above with amounts ranging from S$100 to
S$350 on the condition that they have contributed S$50 into their
Medisave Account during a 6-month period. Again, CPF members
were encouraged to transfer their CPF money to the Medisave
Accounts of their parents to take advantage of the Medisave Top-Up
Scheme. Another Medisave Top-up exercise was carried out in 1997
by the government. Under that exercise, S$100 was transferred to the
CPF accounts of all Singaporeans below the age of 60 and S$200 to
those above 60.A total S$229 million was paid out under that exer-
cise. In the year 2000, another CPF top-up exercise by the govern-
ment saw the CPF Ordinary Account of Singaporeans increasing by
S$250.In 2007,the government gave one extra percentage in interest
to all CPF saving up to a maximum of S$60,000.This extra payment is
meant to benefit low-income Singaporeans.
CHANGING EMPHASIS FROM INVESTMENT
TO HEALTHCARE
In 1992, the employer and employee contribution rate was changed
to 18% and 22% respectively. By then, the government was more con-
cerned about affordable health as home ownership has been
achieved with great success. The percentage contribution for the
Ordinary Account and the Medisave Account was 30% and 6% respec-
tively for those aged 35 and below. But for those aged between 35 to
55 years, the percentage contribution for the Ordinary Account and
the Medisave Account was 29% and 7% account. As expected,the CPF
structure is not targeted at those older than 55 years, and therefore it
is not surprising that the employer’s contribution rate for this group
of employees is very low, 3% or less, with most of the contribution
going into the Medisave Account.
In 1994,the employer’s and employee’s contribution rate was 20%
each.For those aged 35 years and below,the percentage contribution
for the Ordinary Account was 30%, 4% for the Special Account and
6% for the Medisave account. For those aged 35 to 45, the respective
Macro Objectives of the Central Provident Fund (CPF): A Review
49

contribution was 29%,4% and 7%.For those aged 45 to 55,the respec-
tive contribution was 28%,4% and 8%. These changes show the delib-
erate policy shift away from Ordinary Account to Medisave Account.
This is further underlined by the fact that a contribution ceiling for
the Medisave Account of S$33,500 is in place, and that any amount in
excess of S$33,500 in the Medisave Account would be channeled into
the Special Account instead of the Ordinary Account. The monthly
wage ceiling was left unchanged at S$6,000.
INCREASING THE RATE OF RETURN ON CPF SAVING
The CPF savings do earn an interest. It is 2.5% on the savings in the
Ordinary Account and 4% on the other two accounts. Considering
that it is practically riskless, the rate of return is very high. However,
this was not much an issue in the 1970s because most people use the
money for property investment, the price of which has risen many
times,some CPF members wanted a higher rate of return for the com-
pulsory savings. Hence, in 1997, the government set up the CPF
Investment Scheme to allow members to enjoy a wider range of
investment options.
THE EAST ASIAN CURRENCY CRISIS
AND THE SUCCEEDING YEARS
The Singapore economy was very much affected by the currency cri-
sis in 1997 (Lim, 2000).The Singapore dollar depreciated against the
US dollar by 19% but the stock market and property index went
down by as much as 50%. Singaporeans were as expected, very badly
hurt as Singapore has now become a nation of property owners and
share owners. But the falling value of the Singapore dollar did help
the country to export more to the markets in the developed coun-
tries and the rising value of the Singapore dollar relative to regional
currencies gave Singaporeans more purchasing power to import
things from ASEAN countries.However,the financial sector was badly
affected and the construction sector totally collapsed, creating nega-
tive multiple effects.The unemployment rate surged.
50
Chew Soon Beng and Rosalind Chew

Due to our inability to use the flexible wage system to lower the
wage cost (Chew et al., 2005), the employer’s CPF contribution rate
was lowered to 10% in 1999 (see Table 1).This time the government
was more prepared, and the 10 percentage points came from six
points from the Ordinary Account and 4 points from the Special
Account.The 4 percentage points for the Medisave Account were left
untouched.
The economy rebounded in 1999 and accordingly,the employer’s
contribution rate was raised to 12% in 2000 and 16% in 2001. For the
Singapore economy, that was a period of painful transition, with the
private sector undergoing wage reform and some of the big govern-
ment-linked corporations conducting labor rationalization exercises
(Chew et al., 2003). Consequently, GDP growth was low during 2001
to 2003. In fact, Singapore’s GDP growth was worse than that of its
ASEAN neighbors in 2001 because, among other factors, domestic
sentiment was poor (Chew, 2006). Consequently, unemployment rate
in Singapore was very high.When Singapore, along with Hong Kong,
China and Taiwan, was affected by SARS in 2003 and the services sec-
tor was badly hurt, causing the unemployment surge to a new high,
the government had no choice but to trim labor costs again by lower-
ing the employer’s CPF contribution rate to 13% and the monthly
wage ceiling was reduced to S$5,500 in 2004. Again, the flexible
wage system could not bail us out (Chew et al.,2005).
WORRY OVER OLDER WORKER’S EMPLOYMENT
The government is rightly very preoccupied with the ageing of the
population on one hand and competitiveness on the other. Realizing
that older workers may not be as competitive as younger workers
and foreign workers, the government reduced the employer’s CPF
contribution rate for workers older than 50 years in 2005. As a result,
while the employer’s contribution rate for workers below the age of
50 was 13%, the employer’s contribution rate for workers aged 50 to
55 was reduced from 11% in 2005 to 9% in 2006. The employer’s
contribution rate is 6% for workers older than 55 years and 3.5% for
those older than 60 years (CPF Annual Report,2006).(The employee’s
Macro Objectives of the Central Provident Fund (CPF): A Review
51

contribution rate, too, was reduced to 19% in 2005 and again to 18%
in 2006).
Hence, for workers below the age of 50, the employer’s and
employee’s CPF contribution rate was 13% and 20%, respectively.
There are concerns that Singaporeans might have a liquidity problem
after retirement. Hence, in 2006, the respective contribution for the
Ordinary Account, Special Account and Medisave Account for those
aged 35 and below was set at 22%,5% and 6%,for those aged 35 to 45,
the respective contribution rate was 20%, 6% and 7%, for those aged
45 to 50,the respective contribution rate was 18%,7% and 8% and for
those aged between 50 to 55, the respective contribution rate was
18%, 7% and 8%. Clearly, there has been a deliberate policy to de-
emphasize the investment objective.
HIGHER CONTRIBUTION RATES FOR OLD AGE
AND HEALTHCARE
2006 was a good year for Singapore. Accordingly, in 2007, the
employer’s contribution rate was raised to 14.5% for workers below
50 years of age and 10.5% for workers between 50 to 55 years of age
(no change in employee’s contribution rate).Again, the government
wants more savings to be channeled into the Special and Medisave
Accounts. Hence, for workers younger than 35 years of age, the
respective CPF contribution for the Ordinary,the Special Account and
the Medisave Account was 23%, 5% and 7%, while for workers
between 35 to 45 years of age, the respective CPF contribution was
21%,6% and 8%,for workers aged 45 to 50,the respective CPF contri-
bution was 19%, 7% and 9% and, for workers aged 50 to 55, the CPF
contribution was 13%,7% and 9%.
FINE-TUNING TO HELP YOUNG LOW-INCOME
SINGAPOEANS IN COMPETITION
WITH FOREIGNERS
There is a concern that young low-income Singaporeans may find it
difficult to get a job because of competition from foreign workers.
52
Chew Soon Beng and Rosalind Chew

Hence the CPF contribution rate is tweaked to counter this problem.
Thus, while the employer’s CPF contribution rate is 14.5% for work-
ers aged between 35 to 45 years whose monthly wage is S$1,500 or
more, it is 11.7% for those in this age group whose monthly wage is
S$1,000, and 9.7% if the monthly wage is S$800 or below.The reason-
ing is acceptable. Lower employer CPF contribution may encourage
employers to employ them instead of employing foreigners.
One might argue that these low-income Singaporeans who are
lowly educated need their CPF saving much more than high-income
Singaporeans. Hence, to counter the lower employer’s CPF contribu-
tion rates, the government has implemented the Workfare Income
Supplement Scheme to help these low-income Singaporeans.
Provided they work at least 6 months, those who earn, for instance,
S$800 a month will get a monthly payment of S$100 for a year, S$29
of which will be in cash and the remaining S$71 would be deposited
into the worker’s CPF account. It is estimated that about 287,000
workers would receive S$146 million in Workfare Income
Supplements on 1 January 2008 (of course,it goes without saying that
this amount comes from the government coffers and not from the
CPF board).
CPF SCHEME NOT ATTRACTIVE FOR HIGH INCOME
SINGAPOREANS
The monthly wage ceiling, which had risen to S$6,000 in 2003, was
reduced to S$5,000 in 2005 and again to S$4,500 in 2006. Hence,
high-income Singaporeans, especially those who earn more than
S$6,000 a month, no long find the CPF scheme attractive. Singapore
employers have to increase the monthly pay to be commensurate
with their counterparts in Hong Kong and the West if firms want
them to work in Singapore.
It is obvious that with globalization, the wages of low-income
Singaporeans would not rise much as they have to compete with
workers from Malaysia, China and India. On the other hand, high-
income Singaporeans are very mobile. Many developed countries
such as USA, UK, Australia, etc., also have similar schemes where
Macro Objectives of the Central Provident Fund (CPF): A Review
53

employers contribute about 10–15% of the salary of their employees
into their retirement schemes. The only difference is that in these
countries, there is no monthly wage ceiling. Hence, the total salary
package of top professionals in Singaporeans has to be much higher
because of the low wage ceiling (of course, one must not fail to men-
tion that personal income tax is much lower in Singapore than that in
developed countries). This partially explains the rising wage gap in
Singapore.
CPF AS A SUSTAINABLE SOCIAL SAFETY NET
The CPF scheme has now evolved into a sustainable social safety net
for low-income Singaporeans. It forces low-income Singaporeans to
save for old age and motivates them to work as long as they physically
can. The average monthly wage in Singapore is quite low. In 2006,
more than 65% of Singaporeans earned less than S$3,000 a month
and about 82% of Singaporeans had a monthly wage below S$5,000
(CPF Annual Report 2006).Hence,with the wage ceiling of S$4,500,it
can be argued that the CPF scheme is more for low-income
Singaporeans. On the other hand, with the low contribution from the
employers and the low wage ceiling, high-income Singaporeans
might migrate to the developed countries. Some people even argue
that the pay in Malaysia is not as low as it appears because in
Malaysia, employers pay 15% and there is no wage ceiling.The high
employee CPF contribution in Singapore is viewed as negative for the
high-income mobile Singaporeans because it is not matched by the
employers.
MACRO IMPACT OF THE CPF SCHEME
The CPF scheme has the following impacts on the individual worker
and the country:
1.
Impact on Work and Skill Level
The CPF scheme is a compulsory saving scheme. The level of sav-
ing depends on the worker’s wages, which in turn depend on his
54
Chew Soon Beng and Rosalind Chew

continued active participation in the labor market. If he changes
his place of employment, the CPF scheme would continue with
the new employer,as the CPF scheme is a national saving scheme.
The CPF scheme encourages workers to work hard (Lim, CY
and Associates 1988). It also provides an incentive for workers to
take training seriously as a worker’s pay depends on his skills,which
he can acquire or upgrade through training.If a worker is suddenly
retrenched in Singapore,he is not allowed to withdraw his CPF bal-
ances to maintain his lifestyle.He would be told to get another job.
The CPF scheme is different from the unemployment benefits
scheme that can be found in some developed countries. The
unemployment benefits scheme is subject to inherent disadvan-
tages. Firstly, it inevitably increases the reservation wage rate,
which will erode a country’s competitiveness. Secondly, the
unemployment scheme is likely to run into deficit,which must be
financed by raising tax revenue.This implies that income tax rates
would be high, which will discourage people from working for
more income. The CPF scheme, on the other hand, is a fully
funded scheme that encourages workers to give their best in the
labor market and does not need the government to subsidize it.
2.
Impact on Government Budget Policy
The basic objective of the CPF scheme is to ensure that
Singaporeans save for housing, medical expenses and old age.
Singaporeans are able to save as long as they work. Jobs are plen-
tiful in Singapore because Singapore’s system of industrial rela-
tions encourages employment (Krause et al., 1987). Thus, as a
result of the CPF scheme, home ownership in Singapore is one of
the highest among the countries in the world.
Because of the CPF scheme,the government spending on wel-
fare in terms of housing, retirement and healthcare is minimal in
Singapore. Due to high GDP growth and low welfare spending,
the government has resources and is able to implement a strong
exchange rate policy to reduce imported prices if necessary
which in turn will stablize cost of living and protect low-income
Singaporeans.

3.
The CPF is an excellent instrument for implementing transfer pay-
ments, subsidies, unemployment benefits, workfare, education,
etc. It can also encourage family closeness as CPF members can
top up the CPF accounts of their relatives to take advantage of
various government incentive schemes, It also encourages self-
employed and part-time workers to enter into the fold of the CPF
family. In other words, to qualify for the various share and top-up
schemes, the self-employed and the odd-job workers have to
declare their earnings to the CPF even though they work in the
informal sector.Of course,the best part of using the CPF route for
transfer payments to the needy families is that the money is chan-
neled to the specific purposes.The money from the government
distributed via the CPF route therefore cannot be diverted for
purposes for which it is not intended,such as tours.
4.
The CPF Board as part of the government policy uses approxi-
mately 90% of the CPF money to buy government stocks while
10% is deposited with the Monetary Authority of Singapore for
operational purposes (CPF Annual Report, 2006). In return, the
government promises a fixed rate of return which is why the
interest rate on CPF balances has been fixed and is rather high
compared to the rate of return for similar investments without
risk. In other words, the government takes the risk of investment
and not the CPF Board.When the government is able to raise the
return from using the CPF balances or the country has enjoyed
good growth rates, the government can reward CPF members in
terms of CPF top-ups.This has been a good economic model to
bond the people and the government.
5.
Employers are expected to pay both the employer’s and
employee’s contribution for each employee to the CPF Board
monthly. If employers fail to pay the CPF contributions on time,
they will be subject to some form of penalty.Many countries such
as China are interested to learn about the CPF scheme. Indeed, in
China, the CPF scheme has been applied to some big cities but
only for the purpose of housing. A typical question from the
Chinese officials is how to lower the default rate of employers
and to get them to pay the CPF contribution on time,and what to
56
Chew Soon Beng and Rosalind Chew

do if they fail to pay.There is actually very little that the authori-
ties can do. If the authorities penalize the employers who fail to
contribute the CPF payments stringently, they may not be able to
survive,and this will hurt the workers most.In Singapore,the best
policeman is not the CPF Board but the tight labor market. If the
economy is doing very well, any employer who fails to pay the
CPF contribution on time will lose the best workers as workers
will start looking for a job elsewhere. The default rate among
employers for not paying CPF contribution rate on time for two
consecutive months was 0.61% in 2003 which was the worse
growth year and fluctuated around 0.55% in 2006 which was a
good year.In July 2007,the default rate was 0.48%.
THE CPF BOARD AND THE GOVERNMENT
The CPF Fund has been well managed. In many countries, pension
funds are not well accounted for. Singapore owes its success signifi-
cantly to the CPF scheme.It is worth reiterating that the CPF Board is
self-financing. In some countries, the government has a budget to run
a board such as the CPF Board.The CPF Board,like the Singapore gov-
ernment has an annual surplus (CPF Annual Report,2006).
However, the importance of the CPF scheme diminishes because
of the low employer’s contribution rate and the low wage ceiling.But
it is still an important scheme for low-income Singaporeans as well as
for high-income Singaporeans because as employees they have to
contribute 20% of their pay into the CPF account monthly.
Due to its comprehensive income data base,many ministries have
been asking the CPF Board for data so that government policies can
be better formulated.The CPF Board also provides agency services to
the government and other organizations.For instance,it is the collect-
ing agency for the Foreign Worker Levy and the Skills Development
Levy. The CPF Board also conducts the annual Occupational Wages
Survey for the Ministry of Manpower.
Recently, there has been talk about helping low-income
Singaporeans through subsidies as their wages do not increase much
and prices have been going up. Globalization has caused the income
Macro Objectives of the Central Provident Fund (CPF): A Review
57

gap to widen at an increasing rate.We are also entering into a period
of inflation.The use of bio-fuel will increase food prices. Oil prices
will remain high. The markets for low pay jobs diminish. We need
more resources to provide a social safety net on an even broader
basis.Hence,it is imperative that only deserving Singaporeans receive
government subsidies in hospitals, nursing homes, growth package,
schools and universities, HDB flats for sale and rental.We can estab-
lish a single but comprehensive means testing index for all
Singaporeans or for the bottom 30% of the Singaporeans.
Hence, one more function that the CPF Board is well placed to
help in is, to compile a means-testing index. For instance, some peo-
ple may live in HDB flats and have low reported income, but may be
collecting rents from their private property. Some people who live in
HDB also own properties abroad,while there are retirees living in pri-
vate property who have no income.The CPF board will be in the best
position to coordinate with other government agencies to compile
this comprehensive index.
REVIEW AND REFLECTIONS OF THE CPF SCHEME
One ponders over the primary objective of the CPF scheme as the
CPF scheme now has been used for so many purposes such as old age
security, home ownership, affordable healthcare, moderating the cost
of labor, and implementing the social welfare scheme. But all these
are necessary for a country to manage in this open and increasingly
competitive world economic environment. If we do not have the
schemes for housing and healthcare and old age security, the govern-
ment will have to bail people out when they are in need,and the con-
sequence is higher government expenditures and ever-increasing
budget deficits as we have seen in many countries, especially the
developed countries.
However, for Singapore, these above-mentioned objectives are at
times conflicting. For instance, when we lower the CPF contribution
rate we compromise the objective of home ownership.But the worst
problem is that when we reduce the employer’s contribution rate
during a recession as we did in 1986, 1999 and 2004, we also worsen
58
Chew Soon Beng and Rosalind Chew

the property markets.This has been the major limitation of the CPF
scheme as a macro-economic instrument.
On the other hand, the CPF scheme is the most effective way to
reduce labor costs. Since 1988, Singapore tried to promote the flexi-
ble wage system so that labor costs can be reduced immediately
should there be a need to do so. However, it has not been very suc-
cessful. Hence we had to lower the employer’s CPF contribution rate
in 1999 and 2004.
In fact we know that the CPF scheme is not invented by
Singapore. It was a legacy from being a colony of Britain. Indeed, all
British Commonwealth countries inherited the CPF scheme.
Interestingly, many Commonwealth countries come to Singapore to
learn why the CPF scheme has been successful in Singapore but not
in their own countries.
We would like to propose, for countries which are considering
implementing or revamping their CPF scheme, the following
suggestions:
1.
The employee’s contribution to the CPF fund be devoted solely to
the Housing Account (which is solely for the purpose of housing).
One may argue that the contribution from only employees may
not be sufficient to pay for the mortgage on a house.This is a valid
argument. However, the ability to buy properties also determines
the prices of properties. If we ban car loans, car prices will fall.
The property prices would not be too high if only CPF contribu-
tions from employees are allowed to be used in property invest-
ment in the first place.
2.
The employer’s contribution to the CPF fund be allocated to
three accounts: Investment Account, Retirement Account and
Healthcare Account.The CPF saving in the Investment Account
can be used for shares, gold, higher education, and even author-
ized training.All investment expenditures using the balance from
the Investment Account must not require a commitment to
future income (a housing mortgage commits a CPF member for
payments for a period of 20 years and hence an expenditure of
this nature should not be allowed for the Investment Account).
Macro Objectives of the Central Provident Fund (CPF): A Review
59

This proposal cuts the link between employer’s CPF contribu-
tions and the property markets.As an economic instrument, we
only need to adjust the employer’s contribution rate and not the
employee’s contribution rate. Hence, during good times, if we
have to increase labor costs, the government can raise the
employer’s contribution rate without giving an unwanted boost
to the property market. On the other hand, during bad times, if
the government cannot rely on a flexible wage system, it can
lower the employer’s contribution rate without affecting the
property market.
CONCLUSION
This chapter examines the changing roles of the CPF scheme as the
Singapore economy develops, society matures and globalization
intensifies. The original aim of the CPF was to ensure that
Singaporeans had sufficient saving for old age. However, the CPF
scheme was extended to achieve home ownership in the mid-1960s.
In the late 1970s,the CPF scheme was also used as a macro-economic
instrument to restructure the manufacturing sector from labor-
intensive to capital- and skills-intensive industries by increasing the
contribution rate by the employers to 25% by 1984. In the same year,
the CPF also was used to ensure that healthcare was affordable.The
increase in CPF contribution rate reinforced the goals of savings for
old age, home ownership and affordable healthcare. However, during
the 1985 recession, the contribution rate of the CPF by employers
was reduced by 15% as the main element of the cost-cutting meas-
ures.This compromised the goal of home ownership. Fortunately, the
recession was short-lived and the CPF contribution rate was restored
to 20% by 1994.However,both the 1997 currency crisis and the 2003
SARS episode had seen the employers’CPF contribution rate adjusted
downwards.
During the post-9/11 period, the Singapore economy went
through a painful transition with wage reform in the private sector
and labor rationalization exercises in some big government-linked cor-
porations. Fortunately, the Singapore economy had basically recovered
60
Chew Soon Beng and Rosalind Chew

by 2005. However, as a result of globalization, the wages of low-
income Singaporeans are now tied to the wages of those countries
with a huge labor surplus such as China and India. The employer’s
CPF contribution rate has to be kept low to ensure that low-income
Singaporeans remain employable. The monthly wage ceiling to cap
the employer’s contribution has been lowered to $4,500 to contain
labor costs. This means that employers would have to increase the
salary of high-income Singaporeans in order to attract competent
staff.Consequently,the income gap has been widening in Singapore.
Today, the goal of the CPF scheme is to ensure that low-income
Singaporeans have sufficient compulsory saving to see them through
old age, which is a challenge as life expectancy has increased and the
markets for low wage jobs have diminished.
Finally, the chapter proposes that the CPF scheme can be a better
macro-economic instrument if we can remove the link between the
employer’s contribution and the property market.

Monetary Policy in Singapore:
A BBC Approach1
Peter Wilson
“We have only one monetary policy,which is the exchange rate.Because we
have completely open financial markets without foreign-exchange controls
or capital controls,we do not even control interest rates.Our only control is
managing the exchange rate and that is basically to prevent the Singapore
dollar from rising too fast”. (Richard Hu Hsu Tau, Chairman of the
Monetary Authority of Singapore, February 1995)
INTRODUCTION
One of the challenging things about teaching economics in Singapore
is that the uniqueness of its economy precludes the direct application
of some of the standard principles of economics as prescribed,e.g.,in
the A-level syllabus. Monetary policy, as we shall see, is no exception.
63
1 I would like to thank the participants of the NTU-Ministry of Education 2008
Seminar on Economics and Public Policy and the Staff at the Economic Policy
Department, Monetary Authority of Singapore.The views expressed in this chapter
are,however,solely those of the author and should not be attributed to the Monetary
Authority of Singapore.

Yet Singapore cannot be ignored because it has been extremely suc-
cessful when judged against the standard criteria of economic devel-
opment. It has enjoyed sustained rapid economic growth since the
mid-1960s, transformed itself from an entrepot trading center to a
modern high value-added manufacturer and producer of high income
business and financial services, and has raised the standard of living
for the vast majority of its citizens to a “first-world”level (Peebles and
Wilson,2002).
In this chapter we examine Singapore’s highly unusual, but very
successful, monetary policy since 1981 (Monetary Authority of
Singapore, 2007; Parrado, 2004; Khor et al., 2007).We begin with an
overview of the objectives of monetary policy, followed by a closer
look at how monetary policy in Singapore is actually formulated,com-
municated to the general public, and implemented.We then contrast
Singapore’s unorthodox approach with the more “traditional” text-
book approach adopted in other countries. Finally, we delve deeper
into the reasons why Singapore has chosen a non-traditional
approach to monetary policy and make an assessment of how suc-
cessful it has been,taking into account that monetary policy does not
work alone.
SINGAPORE’S EXCHANGE RATE-CENTERED
MONETARY POLICY
Objectives of Monetary Policy
If you check the website of most central banks in the world you will
find a similar mission statement with respect to monetary policy,
namely to preserve the purchasing power of the local currency in
world markets. In Singapore this means protecting the value of pri-
vate savings, compulsory retirement savings with the Central
Provident Fund (CPF), and Singapore’s official holdings of foreign
exchange reserves. During the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98 the
Indonesian currency, the rupiah, fell by over 100 percent against the
US dollar and other currencies and so, therefore, did the value of
Indonesian assets.Would you be happy with your central bank if you
were an Indonesian citizen?
64
Peter Wilson

Since 1981, Singapore’s monetary policy has been centered on
the management of the exchange rate with the primary objective of
ensuring price stability as an anchor for macroeconomic stability and
confidence and a sound basis for sustained economic growth. Low
and stable price inflation is desirable for three main reasons. First, to
provide a stable environment for domestic production and consump-
tion.In Zimbabwe,the annual rate of inflation exceeded 100,000 per-
cent in 2008 and a carton of orange juice cost more than 500,000
Zimbabwe dollars making it almost impossible to predict prices and
creating an environment of uncertainty in which business quotes
were valid only for a few days at a time and people were reluctant to
hold cash for very long. Of course this is an extreme case of hyperin-
flation and some amount of price inflation may be desirable, but in
general the lower,more stable the inflation rate,the better.
Secondly, given that much of Singapore’s GDP growth comes
from exports to the rest of the world, produced by multinational cor-
porations (MNCs) based in the Republic, price stability is desirable to
attract these firms and keep them operating in Singapore. Rising
prices are often associated with rising wages and other costs and this
might persuade MNCs to look for other locations where costs are not
increasing as fast.Finally,low and stable inflation signals to the rest of
the world that Singapore is a stable economy with sound macroeco-
nomic policy and an economically safe place in which to do business,
and enhances its status as an international financial center.
The BBC Exchange Rate System
Monetary policy in Singapore is essentially exchange rate policy and
can be summarized in the acronym “BBC” or “basket”, “band” and
“crawl”. The basket feature refers to the fact that the exchange rate is
managed against an unpublished trade-weighted basket or index of cur-
rencies of Singapore’s major trading partners and competitors.The
weights in the basket are updated periodically and the basket acts as a
more stable reference point for monitoring movements in the Singapore
dollar than if a single currency, such as the US dollar, was used.Thus
if there is a sharp fall in the US dollar, as in the first quarter of 2008,
Monetary Policy in Singapore
65

the Singapore dollar would appreciate against the US dollar but not by
the full amount.If a country does most of its trade with one major part-
ner then keeping the currency fixed to that partner’s currency might
be desirable as it ensures stability in purchasing power for the majority
of its trade. However, for a country, such as Singapore, which has a
diversified pattern of trade,it makes more sense to monitor movements
in the local currency against foreign currencies in some proportion to
their importance as markets for exports or sources of imports.
In contrast to other major currencies,such as the euro,the pound
sterling or the Japanese yen, which are largely allowed to float in the
foreign exchange market, Singapore’s basket currency or the trade-
weighted Singapore dollar (TWS$) is only allowed to float within a
policy band, determined by Singapore’s central bank, the Monetary
Authority of Singapore or MAS. On the other hand, unlike the Hong
Kong dollar, which is tightly fixed to the US dollar at 7.8 Hong Kong
dollars to the greenback, the use of a policy band allows market
forces to determine the exchange rate to some degree and as a means
of absorbing short-term market volatility, but without the volatility
which might result if the currency were to float freely.
Finally, the policy band itself is adjusted from time to time and is
allowed to “crawl”as circumstances change in the international arena
and at home. E.g., the band may be set to appreciate the TWS$ by a
certain amount over the next six months in line with the expected
performance of the economy but in the intervening period news
about underlying economic fundamentals, such as the rate of con-
sumer price inflation or economic growth, may suggest a slower
appreciation would be better. So the exchange rate is allowed to
“crawl” towards the target rate rather than adjust immediately thus
allowing more flexibility to policymakers to change their mind as
economic conditions change and preventing the TWS$ from becom-
ing “misaligned”or too strong or too weak.
The Formulation of Monetary Policy
In order to decide on the optimum or best path for the TWS$, the
MAS will calculate several hypothetical exchange rate policy paths or
66
Peter Wilson

scenarios. To help with the complex calculations involved they are
able to call upon the Monetary Model of Singapore (MMS) which is a
mathematical representation of the Singapore macro-economy involv-
ing more than 200 equations,including its trade and financial dealings
with the rest of the world.This model is not available to the general
public but by all accounts is a good representation of how the econ-
omy works and tracks past data well.
The experiments begin by making certain assumptions or fore-
casts about key variables relevant to monetary policy, such as the
likely rates of economic growth in Singapore’s major trading part-
ners, such as the USA, Japan and European Union, as well as in
Singapore’s other trading partners in the Asian region.This will deter-
mine how fast Singapore’s exports will grow. Also important is what
is expected to happen to consumer price inflation, both within
Singapore itself and in Singapore’s trading partners, who might trans-
mit their own domestic inflation to Singapore through rises in
Singapore’s import prices. Other forecasts might include commodity
prices,such as petroleum or foodstuffs,or the foreign demand for par-
ticular goods that Singapore exports, such as electronics and pharma-
ceuticals, or the number of foreign tourists expected by the
Singapore Tourism Board.
In order to choose the best exchange rate policy path from the
alternative policy scenarios generated by the MMS, the MAS also
seeks advice from sectoral specialists, such as business and finance
analysts, conducts interviews with leading companies in the public
and private sector and calls upon a range of other consultants.Then a
particular policy path will be chosen for the exchange rate to ensure
price stability over the medium term and this policy stance will be
announced to the outside world.
Monetary Policy Communication
Until as recently as 2000, the MAS did not communicate its policy on
the exchange rate to the public but, in common with other central
banks in the world, it was increasingly recognized that greater trans-
parency in monetary policy is essential to reduce the unpredictability
Monetary Policy in Singapore
67

of monetary policy and to prevent misunderstanding by the private
sector and,thus,to reinforce the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Since 2000 there have been 3 main channels of communication
between the MAS and the public at large. First, there is the release
every 6 months in April and in October of the Monetary Policy
Statement (MPS) which gives some indication of the main features of
the BBC exchange rate system,such as the expected path of the TWS$

been in place since April 2004.Note that there is not full transparency
here about the width of the policy band (no band is shown) and the

exchange market itself to buy or sell the local currency in exchange
for foreign currency, and may act as a deterrent to speculation against

Although the MPS is the most important communication tool
used by MAS to explain its monetary policy to the outside world,
closed door briefings are also given to the Singapore media and pri-
vate sector analysts coinciding with the release of the MPS and it pub-
lishes its Macroeconomic Review twice a year in April and October in
conjunction with the release of the MPS. The Macroeconomic Review
contains a more in-depth analysis of recent macroeconomic develop-
ments in the Singapore and global economies, the outlook for the
next year or two and the rationale behind the policy decisions con-
veyed in the MPS.2
Implementation of Monetary Policy
There are two aspects to the implementation of monetary policy in
Singapore:management of the exchange rate (TWS$) and management
of domestic banking liquidity through money market operations.
The Singapore exchange rate regime is a managed float. The
Singapore dollar is not left to float freely in the foreign exchange mar-
ket but is managed, although only within a policy band and not as
tightly as a fixed currency such as the Hong Kong dollar. Managing
the exchange rate is a 24 hour operation and is carried out through
intervention in the foreign exchange market.The basic principles are
shown in Fig. 2, where an imaginary policy band for the TWS$ is
drawn without slope (horizontal) for simplicity. Essentially, if the
upper part of the TWS$ band is breached, the MAS will sell the
Singapore dollar in the foreign exchange market in exchange for for-
eign currency, usually the US dollar.This action depreciates the TWS$
back towards the center of the band. On the other hand, if the lower
part of the band is breached, the MAS will buy the Singapore dollar

with its reserves of foreign currency to appreciate it and bring it back
into the band.Within the band itself there is no need for intervention
and the TWS$ is determined by market forces.However,these are not
mechanical rules and MAS may intervene within the band if, e.g., it
believes that there is excessive volatility due to manipulation by spec-
ulative funds,or to act early to prevent strong momentum building up
and pushing the TWS$ outside the band.
Although, as we shall see below, the MAS does not attempt to
determine interest rates, which are largely set by money market sup-
ply and demand,the central bank does carry out money market oper-
ations which will affect liquidity in the domestic banking system and
short-term interest rates. E.g., if there is too little liquidity in the
money markets,the MAS could buy Singapore Government Securities
(SGS) on the open market and in exchange provide liquidity to the
banking system; and if there is too much liquidity it can sell SGS and
thereby withdraw liquidity from the banking system. In this way the
MAS can neutralize large inflows or outflows from the banking sys-
tem and excessive volatility in interest rates. E.g., when liquidity is

drained from the banking system by government budget surpluses,
or from a rise in CPF contributions net of withdrawals. In this way
money market operations by the MAS can inject back the same
amount of liquidity into the money market and keep domestic inter-
est rates stable.
The MAS may also want to neutralize or sterilize the effect on the
money market of its own foreign exchange intervention to keep the
TWS$ within its policy band (as described above). In this case it off-
sets the fall (rise) in the Singapore dollar due to its foreign exchange
market activity with an opposite money market operation so as to
leave the quantity of Singapore dollars constant.
Another motive for money market intervention is to make sure
that there is sufficient liquidity in the domestic banking system to sat-
isfy the banks’demand for cash balances to meet their intra-day settle-
ments amongst themselves and with the central bank, since all banks
in Singapore have to maintain cash reserves at the MAS interest free
equal to 3 percent of their liabilities. MAS does this by offering dis-
count or lending facilities on a daily basis.3
THE RATIONALE BEHIND SINGAPORE’S
MONETARY POLICY
Traditional Monetary Policy
By choosing an exchange rate-centered monetary policy Singapore
foregoes the use of traditional monetary policy for all intents and pur-
poses.In other countries,such as Australia,Japan,the United Kingdom
and in the European Monetary Union, their central banks will effect
monetary policy by changing monetary aggregates, such as the broad
measure of the money supply, M2, to try to influence local interest
rates by buying and selling government securities in the open market
(open-market operations).
Monetary Policy in Singapore
71
3 MAS’End-of-Day Liquidity Facility enables banks to cover their debits that may arise
from end-of-day cheque-clearing positions. An Intra-Day Liquidity Facility allows
Primary Dealers to borrow intra-day funds and Primary Dealers can also borrow
twice a day through the MAS’Standing Facility.

Figure 3 describes this process using the US Federal Reserve (the
US central bank) for illustration. The MD curve shows the demand for
money by domestic residents as determined by their need to hold
money balances to finance their daily transactions and the interest
rate,which represents the opportunity cost of holding money in zero
or low interest earning accounts when the same money could be
deposited in a higher interest savings account or used to purchase
government or corporate bonds. Of course by moving money into a
savings account there is a loss of liquidity since there will usually be
financial penalties for early withdrawal, and buying bonds entails a
financial risk which holding money normally does not.
The interest rate (r) on the vertical axis thus acts as the price of
money in the sense that the higher it is, the less incentive there is for
the general public to hold their money in non-interest earning
accounts, so the demand for money (MD) is a negative function of r.
Now if the Federal Reserve can change that part of the supply
of money in the economy (MS) over which it has some control
72
Peter Wilson
Figure 3:
Traditional monetary policy

(the monetary base), it can effectively change interest rates in the
economy,given the demand for money MD.
Suppose the Federal Reserve wants to stimulate the economy
because it is worried that it might fall into recession, it could buy
short-term government bonds (US Treasury bills) in the open market
(open market operations), thereby increasing the amount of money
held by the banking system (banks’cash balances) and enabling them
to expand their lending to firms and consumers, and the stock of
money in the economy would rise from MS1 to MS2.4 As a result, the
interest rate would fall from r1 to rT and cheaper money would
encourage firms and consumers to borrow more to finance their
investment and consumption expenditures and stimulate the econ-
omy. If the Federal Reserve was worried about inflationary pressures
it could do the opposite and buy on the open market and thereby
contract the money supply, raise the cost of borrowing, and reduce
spending in the economy.
In this way a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve, can stimu-
late or contract the economy by altering the money supply (MS)
directly or indirectly by targeting the interest rate r,although it cannot
fix both the quantity and the price of money simultaneously, since
setting one determines the other automatically as Fig.3 implies.Since
the early 1990s, the Federal Reserve has tended to focus its day-to
day monetary policy on targeting the Federal Funds rate (FFR) or
the rate at which the US banks lend to each other.Since other interest
rates in the economy tend to move in tandem with the FFR (see
Fig. 4), this effectively means that the Federal Reserve can influence
other interest rates in the economy, such as the Prime Lending Rate
and the 30 Year Mortgage Rate. Note that if targeting the FFR is insuf-
ficient to move the economy in the right direction, the Federal
Reserve, in common with other central banks, can simply offer to
lend more to the banks, and in some cases, bail them out completely.
A good example of this is the recent sub-prime mortgage crisis when

all the major central banks substantially increased the loans they were
willing to make to financial institutions and the UK government took
the extreme step of taking Northern Rock, one of the banks in trou-
ble,into national ownership.
Why is Singapore’s Monetary Policy
Exchange-Rate Centered?
Why does Singapore’s central bank not adopt a conventional mone-
tary policy as described above? The answer to this question is found
in the rather unique characteristics of the Singapore economy,as well
as its economic history.
To begin with, Singapore has always been a very open economy,
meaning that the ratio of its exports and imports to Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) is extremely high by international standards.As shown
in Fig. 5, the sum of Singapore’s exports and imports is in excess of
3 times its GDP. This follows from the fact that Singapore imposes
74
Peter Wilson
Figure 4:
The Federal Reserve moves interest rates

negligible tariffs and quotas on imports from the rest of the world,
and since it has little by way of natural resources it must import most
of what it needs and export to pay for it.Other countries in the world
are also very open to trade,such as Malaysia and Hong Kong,but what
singles Singapore out is its very high import content of domestic
expenditure and exports. Out of every dollar spent in Singapore
about 50 cents goes to foreigners in payment for imports and a large
proportion of the value of a good exported from Singapore consists
of imported intermediate inputs. Out of every dollar of refined petro-
leum exported from Singapore, approximately 90 cents is accounted
for by imported crude oil.
The implication of this is that Singapore is a classic price-taker in
world markets since it is too small as an exporter or importer to have
any discernable impact on international prices. So domestic prices
are largely determined by world prices for a given exchange rate. The
price of Thai rice in Singapore’s supermarkets, e.g., is essentially the
Thai export price in the Thai currency — the baht — converted into
Singapore dollars at the prevailing exchange rate.
What the MAS has done, since 1981, has been to turn this import
dependence into a virtue by taking advantage of the powerful link
between the exchange rate, import prices, and domestic prices. If, for
instance,consumer price inflation is rising in Singapore,as in the first
quarter of 2008, and the MAS wants to bring it down, rather than

Singapore’s openness to trade and capital flows

tightening monetary policy by raising interest rates,as would occur in
a country using traditional monetary policy, instead it appreciates the
TWS$ by buying the S$ in the foreign exchange market, as described
earlier. Because domestic prices are largely determined by world
prices for a given exchange rate, the appreciation of the TWS$ effec-
tively lowers import prices and, subsequently, wholesale and con-
sumer prices, as the effects of the appreciation pass-through to the
domestic economy.
Experiments using the MMS have shown that the impact of
exchange rate policy on GDP, exports and the consumer price index
is significantly stronger than an equivalent change in the interest rate.
In the jargon of central banks, the exchange rate is a good (control-
lable) intermediate target or instrument and bears a stable and pre-
dictable relationship with price stability as the ultimate target of
monetary policy over the medium term. In other words, Singapore’s
exchange rate-centered monetary policy may have been born out of
necessity and is certainly unorthodox,but it works!
A second factor determining the choice of monetary policy in
Singapore since 1981 is Singapore’s openness to international capital
flows.Foreign exchange controls and restrictions on inflows and out-
flows of capital were removed in 1978 and Singapore has always
adopted an open-arms approach to investment by foreign multina-
tional corporations (MNCs), providing they are export-oriented.
Again, this is not unique to Singapore, but what makes Singapore dif-
ferent is the very close relationship between the domestic banking
system and the substantially larger offshore Asian Dollar Market or
ADM (see Fig.4).5
What this means is that if there is any discrepancy between
domestic interest rates in Singapore and those in the offshore market,
banks in Singapore can move their funds quickly offshore to earn a
higher return.There is, in essence, almost perfect capital mobility and
76
Peter Wilson
5The ADM is a market where the banks in Singapore which are licensed to deal in the
ADM can lend and borrow in a foreign (offshore) currency,usually the US dollar.Even
if the transaction is in another currency such as the yen, it is still referred to, by con-
vention as the Asian Dollar Market.

substitutability between domestic (onshore) and foreign (offshore)
financial assets. The consequence of this is that interest rates in
Singapore are largely determined by world money markets, including
the ADM. Singapore is simply too small, in the financial sense, and too
open, in the trading sense, to set its own interest rates. If the MAS
decided to copy the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve and
lower interest rates to stimulate a recovery from a recession, all that
would happen is that money would flow out of Singapore’s domestic
banks into offshore bank accounts where interest rates have not
fallen. In terms of Fig. 3, this outflow would automatically contract
the money supply in Singapore back to MS1 and the original attempt
by the monetary Authority to lower r to rT, would be thwarted.The
MAS knows this and does not even try to influence interest rates
beyond the minor smoothing discussed earlier.
The choice of an exchange rate-centered monetary policy for
Singapore is also supported by economic theory which suggests that
economic policymakers are faced with three desirable but, at times
contradictory, macroeconomic objectives, which cannot be achieved
simultaneously. This is known as the “Policy trilemma”or “impossible
trinity”. The three objectives are exchange rate management to stabi-
lize the currency,the ability to carry out domestic monetary policy by
targeting domestic interest rates or the money supply (traditional
monetary policy or monetary autonomy), and free capital mobility in
order to integrate with global financial markets. Policymakers can
choose two of the three objectives but have to decide which third
objective to give up.
Figure 6 illustrates the policy trilemma for Singapore.The corners
of the triangle show the policy goals just described. Unfortunately, at
most only two can be achieved at the same time. E.g., if Singapore
wishes to achieve exchange rate stability by managing its currency
(managed floating) and simultaneously keep its capital market open
(free capital mobility), it will have to sacrifice traditional monetary
policy or monetary autonomy. Any attempt to use monetary policy
would drive the local interest rate away from world rates and in an
open capital market it would be forced back into line with world
rates. By contrast, the USA can continue to use domestic monetary
Monetary Policy in Singapore
77

policy to expand or contract the economy and at the same time keep
its capital market open but has to sacrifice exchange rate manage-
ment as a major objective of macroeconomic policy and let its cur-
rency float freely.In September 1998,during the Asian financial crisis,
Malaysia decided to fix its currency — the ringgit — to the US dollar,
and since it wanted to continue using traditional monetary policy to
stimulate a recovery in the domestic economy, it was forced to aban-
don free capital mobility and introduce capital and currency controls.
Thus,because managed floating is thought to be more effective in
achieving Singapore’s domestic macroeconomic goals than traditional
monetary policy and Singapore wants to keep the capital market as
open as possible,traditional monetary policy is abandoned in favor of
exchange rate management, as the quotation from former Finance
Minister,Richard Hu,at the beginning of the chapter confirms.6

Figure 6:

6 Another way of thinking about this is that since monetary policy in Singapore is
targeted at the exchange rate, which involves changing the stock of Singapore dol-
lars whenever the MAS intervenes to manage the currency, the MAS cannot simul-
taneously target either money supply aggregates (such as M1 or M2) or the
interest rate.

HAS MONETARY POLICY IN SINGAPORE
BEEN SUCCESSFUL?
There is no doubt that monetary policy in Singapore has been very
successful since 1981 and has enabled the Republic to cope with
external shocks. Figure 7 plots the TWS$ since 1980.7 As can be seen,
the basket measure of the currency has generally appreciated over
the longer run, due principally to Singapore’s strong growth perform-
ance. But there have been periods when the exchange rate has
needed to adjust to cope with upturns and downturns in the econ-
omy,often stemming from external causes.
In 1985, e.g., Singapore experienced its first major recession
since independence in 1965.To speed up recovery and help export

competitiveness, the MAS allowed the TWS$ to depreciate, but much
of the adjustment came from government-determined cost cuts,
including a 15 percentage point cut in the employers’ CPF contribu-
tion rate,and cuts in wages.The economy recovered quickly from the
recession and the following period up to the Asian financial crisis of
1997–98 was a golden age of strong growth and falling unemploy-
ment. To offset the build-up of inflationary pressures during this
period, the MAS allowed the TWS$ to appreciate, thus lowering
import costs so that rapid economic growth of about 8 percent per
year did not lead to excessive inflationary pressures.
The Asian financial crisis,beginning with the rapid depreciation of
the Thai baht in July 1997, spread to Singapore because of Singapore’s
openness to international trade and capital flows.The TWS$ initially
appreciated because other currencies were falling faster, but the MAS
eased monetary policy by allowing the Singapore dollar to depreciate
and widened its policy band to give more room to the market to move
the currency down. Thus, again, monetary policy through the BBC
exchange rate mechanism helped Singapore to weather the storm. In
fact,Singapore escaped relatively unscathed from the crisis.
The next two crises were of a different nature.In 2001 there was a
slowdown in the global electronics market following the bursting of
the dot.com bubble.Export-oriented Singapore was badly hit.Monetary
policy, which had returned after the Asian financial crisis to a modest
appreciation of the TWS$,was now shifted to a neutral stance. This did
not save Singapore from negative economic growth but together with
another cost-cutting package, it certainly helped. Monetary policy was
also eased following the outbreak of the SARS crisis in 2003.
Since the second half of 2003 the Singapore economy has enjoyed
sustained strong growth and job creation and, accordingly, monetary
policy has been tightened gradually using the “crawl” feature of the
BBC principle.With the sharp increase in imported inflation in the first
part of 2008 and continuing strength in the economy,it will be interest-
ing to see if there is a change in monetary policy in November 2008.
Apart from helping the economy adjust to external shocks,mone-
tary policy in Singapore is also designed to reduce volatility in the
Singapore dollar exchange rate. On the whole, the TWS$ has been
80
Peter Wilson

more stable than other major currencies, thus justifying the “basket”
feature of the BBC exchange rate system.The volatility of the TWS$,
as measured by its standard deviation, was 1.40 percent between
the first quarter of 1981 and the first quarter of 2007, compared to
3.29 percent and 4.45 percent for the US dollar and Japanese yen,
respectively. Moreover, on a bilateral basis, the Singapore dollar has
been less volatile against the US dollar, the yen and the euro than
these currencies have been against each other.Counterfactual experi-
ments both before and after the Asian financial crisis also confirm that
Singapore’s managed floating exchange rate regime has coped well
with exchange rate volatility when compared with other countries’
exchange rate regimes and a number of hypothetical regimes,such as
fixing to the US dollar (Wilson and Ng,2008).
Most important of all,monetary policy in Singapore has been able
to deliver low consumer price inflation, which averaged 1.7 percent
between January 1981 and May 2007, and this has provided a stable
macroeconomic environment for both producers and consumers.
Apart from the first oil shock in the mid-1970s, which was global in
its impact, Singapore’s inflation rate compares very favorably with
weighted average inflation in its Organization of Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) trading partners (Fig. 8). If there were a

Moreover,price stability has not been at the expense of economic
growth, given rise to prolonged periods of high unemployment, or in
general caused problems for exports and the balance of payments.
Figure 9 plots annual GDP growth in Singapore since 1980. Despite a
number of external shocks to the economy, as described above,
Singapore’s GDP grew, on average, by 7 percent per year between
1980 and 2007. Notice that whilst the Singapore economy went into
recession (negative growth) in 1985–86, 1998–99, and 2001–02, the
economy has always recovered quickly, partly due to good monetary
policy. Unemployment, therefore, rises during economic downturns
but falls soon after and, on average, unemployment has been quite
low (Fig.10).
As a general rule,countries which grow fast and undergo a period
of rapid economic growth often find that excess demand for goods

and services in an open economy tends to spill over into deficits in
the balance of payments as imports are sucked in faster than exports
can be produced.Also, when there are inflationary pressures and the
MAS tightens monetary policy by intervening in the foreign exchange
market to appreciate the Singapore dollar, this can raise the prices of
Singapore’s exports to foreign countries and make Singapore firms
less competitive.Whether this has in fact happened is still a little con-
troversial and difficult to measure,since the exchange rate is only one
of a number of factors which determine export competitiveness
(Abeysinghe and Wilson,2002). Those companies in Singapore which
are very price competitive in foreign markets but do not benefit much
from a fall in import costs when the Singapore dollar is appreciated
will be most affected.But as far as the current account and overall bal-
ance of payments are concerned, Singapore has recorded consistent
and sizeable surpluses as a percent of national income since 1981
(Table 1).
Monetary Policy Does Not Work Alone

since 1981. Luckily Singapore has strong supporting macroeconomic
institutions which ensure a good degree of consistency in policy and
reinforce the credibility of its monetary policy. In particular, because
the government generally runs a budget surplus and does not accu-
mulate foreign debt, there is no need for the MAS to finance govern-
ment debt so it can concentrate on its own monetary objectives. In
many other countries in the world, especially developing countries,
the central bank is diverted from its main function by the need to
finance the government’s excessive spending or revenue shortfall.
Secondly, in spite of the fact that the Singapore government
exerts a significant amount of control over the economy through
Statutory Boards and government-linked companies, it has always
encouraged market-oriented activity and resisted the temptation to
protect firms and workers from changes in the global economy. The
labor and capital markets are relatively flexible, in the sense that
wages and profits can be adjusted downwards when the economy
goes into a downturn, and economic policy in Singapore since the
mid-1960s has always been pro-growth, pro-international trade, and
welcoming to foreign investment (Peebles and Wilson,2005).
Finally, Singapore has a good international reputation for corpo-
rate governance. Corruption in the government and the Civil Service
is extremely rare, the financial system is well-regulated and financial
institutions based in Singapore adhere closely to international best
practices.This ensures that when financial crises do occur,as with the
recent sub-prime mortgage market collapse, Singapore is generally in
a good position to absorb the shocks which result.Singapore also has

CONCLUSION
In this chapter we have looked at Singapore’s unusual,but highly suc-
cessful, monetary policy since 1981.As with other central banks, the
imperative of the MAS is to preserve the purchasing power of the
Singapore dollar in international markets. Since 1981, Singapore’s
monetary policy has been centered on the exchange rate with the pri-
mary objective of ensuring domestic price stability as an anchor for
macroeconomic stability in general and a sound basis for sustainable
economic growth.
The exchange rate is managed against a trade-weighted basket of
currencies but is allowed to float within a policy band determined by
the MAS and the policy stance is adjusted from time to time through a
“crawl” mechanism.A particular policy path is identified twice a year
which will ensure price stability over the medium term and this “pol-
icy stance” is then communicated to the general public in order to
obtain feedback,prevent misunderstanding and generally to reinforce
the credibility and effectiveness of monetary policy. Because of
Singapore’s extreme openness to international trade and capital flows
and its desire to “manage” the currency to some degree, the MAS
effectively gives up control of domestic interest rates, which are set
by international financial markets, although it does engage in daily
money market operations to reduce excessive volatility in interest
rates and ensure that there is sufficient liquidity in the local banking
system.
There is no doubt that despite its unorthodoxy, monetary policy
in Singapore has been very successful since 1981 in helping the
economy to adjust to periodic economic shocks, such as the Asian
financial crisis of 1997–98. It has also delivered a stable currency, low
and stable consumer price inflation without sacrificing economic
growth and employment,and has avoided balance of payments crises.
The success of monetary policy in Singapore has also been
helped by a flexible labor market and strong supporting institutions

which have ensured consistency in economic policy and provided an
environment conducive to rapid export and FDI-led economic
growth. The financial system has, by and large, been well-regulated
and a high savings policy has provided a large and growing pool of
foreign exchange reserves to reinforce the credibility of exchange
rate policy and provide the means for the MAS to actively engage in
the foreign exchange market to manage the Singapore dollar.

Capital Accumulation, Capital-Output
Ratio and Total Factor Productivity
in Singapore
Sng Hui Ying
INTRODUCTION
Capital, together with labor, land and technology, are the key factors
of production.Various growth theories relate the growth of capital to
the growth of output. In Rostow’s growth model, an increase of
investment rate to 10% or more is necessary before growth can
gather enough momentum to take-off. In the Harrod-Domar model,
the growth rate of national output is equal to the growth rate of capi-
tal. In Lim’s S-Curve hypothesis (1996, 2004), the rapid accumulation
of physical capital is an important driver behind the superlative
growth of the Newly Industrializing Economies (NIEs). De Long and
Summers (1991,1993) have also shown that investment in machinery
and equipment has a strong association with growth.
However, statistical evidences on the importance of capital
accumulation in causing GDP growth are mixed. Several studies on
87

the causality between capital accumulation and GDP growth have
been conducted. While studies using panel data often produce
results that disagree that it is capital growth that causes output
growth (Blomstrom et al., 1996; Podrecca and Carmeci, 2001), stud-
ies on individual countries show that the causal relationship
between investment and growth is country-specific and may run in
either direction (Ghali and Al-Mutawa, 1999; Hatemi-J and Irandoust,
2002).
Singapore experienced very rapid increase in GDP between
1960s and 1990s on the back on sharp increases in factor inputs.
However, Krugman (1994) and Young (1995) dismiss the spectacular
rise of Singapore’s GDP by emphasizing that Singapore’s Total Factor
Productivity (TFP) growth was negligible and that the high economic
growth was only driven by resource accumulation. Krugman even
predicts that Singapore could face a “Soviet-style” growth collapse.
This Chapter disagrees with Krugman and Young, and takes the view
that a sharp increase in capital accumulation during the development
process of a developing country is necessary to fuel current and
future economic growth.
This Chapter postulates that capital accumulation of an economy
follows an S-Curve as the economy develops.The hypothesis suggests
that a NIE would experience rapid accumulation of capital, and this
rate of capital growth would slowly taper off as the economy devel-
ops.This sharp increase in capital accumulation is necessary to fuel
further economic growth.It is further postulated that the growth rate
of capital stock is likely to outpace that of GDP during the early phase
of industrialization.As a result of this S-Curve of capital accumulation,
the incremental capital-output ratio (ICOR) and the average capital-
output ratio (ACOR) of the economy are likely to first increase, and
then gradually decrease as the economy ascends the development
ladder.
The outline of this Chapter is as follows: Section 1 puts forth the
hypothesis of the S-Curve of capital accumulation and the probable
patterns of capital-output ratios as an economy develops. Section 2
presents a case study of Singapore. Section 3 tests the long term
causal relationship between Singapore’s capital stock and GDP and
88

found it to be positive and bi-directional.Section 4 revisits the issue of
TFP growth and capital growth in Singapore.
1. HYPOTHESIS OF THE S-CURVE OF CAPITAL
ACCUMULATION AND ITS IMPLIED
CAPITAL-OUTPUT RATIO
1.1. S-Curve of Capital Accumulation
According to Lim’s S-Curve hypothesis (1996,2004),the development
of an economy can be divided into 3 stages: Stage 1 (underdevelop-
ment with low-income and slow growth),Stage 2 (rapid development
with middle income and rapid growth), and Stage 3 (highly devel-
oped with high-income and slow growth).
If capital accumulation is strongly associated with output growth,
then a Stage 1 economy is likely to have a low-level of per capita cap-
ital stock and a low-rate of capital accumulation. Rate of capital accu-
mulation would gain momentum as the economy enters Stage 2 of
economic development, and the level of per capita capital stock,
increases.A Stage 3 economy would enjoy a high-level of per capita
capital stock but its rate of capital accumulation,although is still posi-
tive,would gradually decline.
An underdeveloped Stage 1 economy is likely to have a low-level
of per capita capital stock.This is intuitive as capital investment needs
to be financed out of savings from income which is lacking in the
poor countries.In addition,foreign investment is likely to be scarce in
the absence of investment-conducive policies. Growth rate of per
capita capital stock is also expected to be low since governments of
developing countries often have limited tax-collecting and revenue-
generating capabilities.
On the other hand, a Stage 2 NIE with its improving business
environment, better property rights protection and a comparatively
cheaper cost structure would attract both foreign and domestic
direct investment. The influx of foreign investment would provide
increased business opportunities to domestic producers, thereby
inducing further domestic investment.Moreover,as the fiscal position

89

of the government improves, the government would be able to
invest more heavily in the development of physical infrastructure
and human capital. It is further postulated that the growth rate of
capital stock would outpace that of GDP during the early phase of
industrialization.
A highly developed Stage 3 economy that has experienced con-
tinued capital accumulation over prolonged period would have a
high-level of per capita capital stock. However, capital growth rate is
likely to slow down due to diminishing returns of capital.In addition,
the high-cost of production in the developed countries would lead to
direct investment, especially those from the manufacturing sector, to
flow to the cheaper developing countries.
The graphical representation of the time paths of capital stock
and output level as an economy develops is shown in Fig.1.
1.2. Time Path of Capital-Output Ratios
Due to a general lack of supply of capital and an excess supply
of labor, an underdeveloped Stage 1 economy is likely to have
low-levels of incremental capital-output ratio (ICOR = ∆K/∆Y)
90

S-Curve of capital accumulation

and average capital-output ratio (ACOR = K/Y) (where K =
capital stock, Y = GDP) as production processes are likely to be
labor-intensive.
The NIE is likely to experience increasing ICOR and ACOR.Firstly,
a rapidly developing economy is expected to undergo a period of
rapid increase in capital investment. In the short to medium term, as
the investment rate expands rapidly while the output growth lags
behind, ICOR (= (I/Y)/(∆Y/Y)) will inevitably be pushed up.
Secondly, as the excess labor in the economy is exhausted, produc-
tion process has to become increasingly capital-intensive, and thus
leading to higher ICOR.Thirdly, the government would be undertak-
ing large-scale infrastructural projects which have higher levels of
ICOR. As the NIE gradually matures into a developed economy, the
rate of increase of ICOR will slow down, and the level of ICOR may
even start to decline.
A highly-developed economy with its high-level of accumulated
investment is likely to have a low investment rate.At the same time,
the developed economy continues to reap the returns of earlier
investment, especially those in infrastructure and buildings that have
very long service lives. Thus, the ICOR of a developed economy is
likely to be falling, albeit gradually, as the investment rate falls faster
than the GDP growth rate. However, as the production processes
adopted in a developed economy is of much higher capital intensity,
the ICOR of the developed economy would be higher than that of an
underdeveloped economy.As ICOR declines,ACOR would eventually
stabilize or even decline.
The probable time paths of the ACOR and the ICOR over the
development process of a country are given in Fig.2.

AND OUTPUT GROWTH
2.1. Estimation of Singapore’s Capital Stock
Data on Singapore’s capital stock are constructed from data on Gross
Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) at 2000 prices using the Perpetual

91

Inventory Method (PIM).1 Straight-line depreciation is assumed and
the assumptions on the longevity of various categories of capital
stock, ranging from 15 to 80 years, follow those used by the
Singapore’s Department of Statistics (DOS) in their computation of
the capital stock of Singapore (Department of Statistics, 1997; OECD,
2001).2
2.2. Singapore’s Capital Stock
Figure 3 presents the estimated net capital stock of Singapore from
1960–2006. The time path of Singapore’s accumulation of capital
stock concurs with the hypothesis of S-Curve of capital accumula-
tion.The accumulation of capital got on a slow start during the early
phase of the Singapore’s economic development (low-level and low-
growth of capital).The building up of capital gained momentum in
late 1960s, signaling Singapore’s entrance into a new phase of rapid

industrialization (medium-level and high-growth of capital). The
growth of capital stock appears to slow down since 1998 (high-level
and low-growth of capital).
2.3. Capital Accumulation and Economic
Development of Singapore
Singapore’s per capita GDP has grown in tandem with the increase in
the per capita capital stock over the years (see Fig. 4). In 1960,
Singapore’s per capita GDP and per capita capital stock were both
very low at only S$4,080 and S$7,290, respectively. Singapore began
its metamorphosis into a NIE from mid-1960s.And since mid-1960s to
late-1990s, Singapore’s per capita capital stock grew rapidly, so did its
per capita GDP.However,it can be seen from Fig.4 that the growth of
both the per capita GDP and the per capita capital stock appear to be
slowing down since late 1990s.
Table 1 shows that since the 1970s, the growth rates of per
capita capital stock were consistently higher than that of the GDP.

This is in line with our proposition that the per capita capital stock
of a NIE would rise faster than its per capita GDP. Furthermore, the
difference between the two sets of growth rates narrowed as the
time went by. This supports the proposition that the increase in GDP
will catch up with that of capital stock during the later phase of

2.4. Singapore’s Capital-Output Ratios
Figure 5 shows the variability of Singapore’s ACOR over the period
1960–2006. Level of ACOR was rising steadily from less than 1.8 in
early 1960s to about 2.8 in early 2000s.There were four prominent
upsurges of the ACOR over the last 47 years, and they coincided with
the recessionary years of Singapore: 1964, 1985, 1998 and 2001.
During recession,output falls sharply while capital stock remains rela-
tively stable resulting in an under-utilization of capital. This leads a
sudden increase in ACOR,which is not representative.
It can be seen from Fig. 5 that Singapore’s ACOR expanded rapidly
in the first 20 years after Singapore attained independence in 1965.
This is in line with the hypothesis of the S-Curve of capital accumula-
tion: NIE would experience increasing ACOR (and ICOR) during the
early stage of industrialization.The steady increase of the ACOR ran out

expected to hover around 2.6 and may even gradually decline.
3. GRANGER CAUSALITY BETWEEN SINGAPORE’S
CAPITAL STOCK AND GDP
Granger Causality Bivariate Vector Error Correction Model (VECM)
Test is used in this section to establish the causality between
Singapore’s capital stock (K) and GDP (Y). While the Augmented
Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test shows that unit root exists in both the data
series of Kt and Yt, the first differences of Kt and Yt are found to be
stationary. The Johansen cointegration test shows that both Kt and Yt
are cointegrated,i.e.,there exists a long-term equilibrium relationship
between capital stock and GDP.
A Bivariate VECM is set up to establish the causality between cap-
ital stock and GDP:
A lag of 1 period is found to minimize the value of the Akaike’s
Information Criteria (AIC). The VECM estimates are given as follows:

tive and significant bi-directional long-term causal relationship

between Singapore’s capital stock and its GDP. In the short-term, the
granger causality ran from GDP growth to increases in capital stock.
The granger causality from changes in capital stock to GDP growth is
statistically insignificant.
4. CAPITAL GROWTH AND TOTAL FACTOR
PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH IN SINGAPORE
Under the framework of growth accounting, economic growth is
attributable to increases in factor inputs and improvements in total
factor productivity (TFP). Factor inputs commonly included in
growth accounting exercises are physical capital, labor force and
human capital, while TFP is measured as the residual of the growth
equation after accounting for the increases in factor inputs. TFP
would include both technological progress and enhanced efficiency,
although the contributions from these two factors are not distinguish-
able from the derived estimates.
In almost all studies on growth accounting,such as Hall and Jones
(1999) and King and Levine (1994),TFP is found to account for the
bulk of cross-country growth differences, while differences in physi-
cal capital accounts for little of the international differences in output
growth.Thus, the long-term growth potential of an economy is often
viewed to be determined by its ability to achieve and sustain a high
level of TFP growth.
Singapore experienced very rapid increase in GDP between
1960s and 1990s on the back on sharp increases in factor inputs.
Studies on decomposition of Singapore’s economic growth, such as
Tsao (1982), Young (1992, 1995), Rao and Lee (1995), Koh et al.
(2002) and Hsieh (2002), have all pointed to the overwhelming
importance of capital accumulation in propelling the growth of
Singapore, and the smaller degree of contribution made by TFP
growth. In addition, some of the earlier studies, such as those by Tsao
(1982) and Young (1992, 1995), concluded that Singapore’s TFP
growth rates were negligible.The high-level of capital growth and the
corresponding very low level of TFP growth have prompted Krugman
(1994) and Young (1995) to cast doubt on the sustainability of
Capital Accumulation in Singapore
97

Singapore’s economic growth; Krugman even predicted that
Singapore could face a “Soviet-style”growth collapse.
There are two questions concerning the issue of TPF growth and
capital growth. Firstly, was Singapore’s TFP growth rates as low as
those computed by Tsao (1982) and Young (1992, 1995). And sec-
ondly, is high capital growth the boon or the bane of sustainable eco-
nomic growth?
The first question is a technical one that requires a technical
answer. Young (1995) estimates that out of the 8.7% average GDP
growth rate from 1966–1990, the growth in TFP averaged only 0.2%.
The very low-level of TFP growth of Singapore obtained by Young,
stems from his assumptions about the factors shares in the produc-
tion function. Young estimates the output elasticity of capital of
Singapore to be around 0.5, substantially higher than 0.35 in a typical
economy (Eggertsson, 2004). Eggertsson cites the estimates of factor
shares computed by Bosworth and Collins (2003) and Sarel (1997),
and reasons that α = 0.35 is more appropriate. Using the assumption
of α = 0.35, Eggertsson (2004) shows that Singapore’s average TFP
growth over the period 1960–2003 was at 1.4%. Eggertsson’s decom-
position of the economic growth of Singapore is reproduced in Table 2.
In addition, Eggertsson also shows that Singapore’s TFP growth rates
are comparable to,if not higher than,those of the other advanced and
emerging economies (see Table 3). Other studies on decomposition
of growth of Singapore have also reported higher levels of TFP
growth than those reported by Young.The reported TFP growth by

Wu and Thia (2002) for 1990–2000 is 1.6 percent. Hsieh (2002) esti-
mates TFP growth for the East Asian economies using the dual
approach and finds that Singapore’s TFP growth to be around 1.6 to
1.9 percent between 1968 and 1990.
On the question of whether high capital growth is a boon or a
bane of sustainable economic growth, the answer is less quantifiable
but it is more intuitive. It can be seen from Table 2 that Singapore’s
growth since 1960 has been largely driven by capital accumulation;
contribution from physical capital accounted for more than 50% of
Singapore’s output growth from 1960–2003. It is indisputable that
the high rate of capital growth has contributed positively to the high
economic growth rates and the rapid improvement in the living
standards in Singapore. As pointed out by Ghesquiere (2006),
“… notwithstanding the neo-classical concern about diminishing
returns, high fixed capital formation can ensure high-growth and ris-
ing living standards from low initial levels. The transition to the
“steady state” when these forces become impotent can take several
decades”.

Furthermore, the high rate of capital accumulation has built a
strong physical foundation for Singapore that serves as a platform for
future growth.It can be seen from Table 2 that the early strong contri-
butions of physical capital and labor input have eased over time
falling from 60% in 1960s to 42% during 1990–2003, while TPF
growth and contribution of human capital have gradually increased.
CONCLUSION
The case study of Singapore shows that as Singapore underwent
transformation from a developing economy to an industrializing
economy, Singapore experienced rapid capital growth. Capital
growth slows down as Singapore transforms into a developed econ-
omy. These results concur with the hypothesis of the S-Curve of
capital accumulation. In addition, the rapid development of
Singapore was accompanied by a rising ACOR.This rising ACOR is
part and parcel of the development process and does not necessar-
ily mean that Singapore is inefficient in utilizing its capital.
Singapore’s ACOR is expected to eventually stabilize or even
decline.
Empirical exercise shows that the long-term causal relationship
between Singapore’s capital stock and GDP is found to be positive
and bi-directional. In the short-term, GDP growth granger caused
increases in capital stock. This chapter reasons that in the case of
Singapore, strong growth in physical capital during the earlier stage
of our development is necessary to fuel past, present and future eco-
nomic growth. In addition, a high-level of capital stock is likely to
serve as the foundation for future gains in TFP. Study has shown that
as Singapore’s economy matures, contribution from physical capital
diminishes while contributions from TFP and human capital increase.

The Asian Financial Crisis and the
Sub-Prime Mortgage Crisis:
A Dissenting View*
Lim Chong Yah†
CAPITAL CONTROL AND ASIAN CRISIS
Ten years have passed since the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis hit
many countries in East Asia.There has been voluminous literature on
the subject on the course and causes of the crisis. Most, if not all the
literature, have not covered or have avoided answering the impor-
tant question of why Asian countries that had capital control did not
have such a crisis, or experienced the serious contagion effect
of such a crisis. Such countries included those with a diversity of

balance of payments background such as China,Vietnam, India and
even very much weaker economies of Myanmar,Laos,and Cambodia
(Lim, 2007).
Deepening Crisis Economies
The hard-working researchers concentrated mainly on the badly-hit
crisis economies of Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea.
Some did not even bother to mention that, such market-oriented
exposed economies like Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan also
experienced serious contagion effects but had succeeded in over-
coming them. The quartet of Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and
Malaysia, however, succumbed badly to the crisis. Actually, when
Malaysia decided to re-introduce capital control in September 1998,
the crisis in Malaysia was effectively checked.The exchange rate was
maintained at US$1 to 3.8 Malaysian ringgit until de-control was re-
introduced some years later.
IMF and Crisis Management
Indeed, the other prolonged crisis trio of Thailand, Indonesia and
South Korea had one anti-crisis option in common. They all sought
IMF help in stabilizing their exchange rates.Later statistics show that,
with IMF supervising, or under IMF tutelage, their exchange rates
deteriorated further (Lim, 2004). In the case of Indonesia, the
exchange rates fell even much further, almost a bottomless fall.
Obviously, the IMF prescription did not cure the 3 Asian patients but
prolonged their agony and misery, particularly in the case of Thailand
and Indonesia.The IMF’s ability-to-cure reputation has been seriously
dented up to this day.
Of interest is that, not long before the crisis, the World Bank had
come out with a report heralding Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia as
among the miracle economies of Asia (World Bank, 1993).Till today,
however, ten years later, unfortunately for the world, particularly the
developing world, the IMF still has neither changed its conventional
chest of medical cures, nor its basic modus operandi to save the
106
Lim Chong Yah

world from a foreign exchange rate crisis, as has been its avowed
primary function.
Accumulate, Accumulate, Accumulate
The fall in the confidence level in IMF must have contributed impor-
tantly to the new economic phenomenon in Asia:“each unto itself”
policy. Each country to accumulate as much foreign exchange
reserves as possible as a precautionary measure in case another
exchange rate crisis were to break out. All Asian countries have
learned not to depend on the IMF for crisis salvation.Why they are all
still members of the IMF is an interesting question. There must be
very good reasons,mainly non-economic,on balance,not to get out of
the pack.Only Venezuela has left the IMF.
Recurrence of Crisis
Ten years have passed. Can another East Asian exchange rate crisis
recur? This is an interesting,important and a frequently asked question,
especially before the current sub-prime crisis broke out. In my view, it
will not recur in the foreseeable future,for the following 4 reasons:
(1) Unlike the 1997/98 crisis years,all the affected Asian nations now
have good and respectable balance of payment surpluses. The
badly affected nations then all suffered from,to use an expression
in the IMF charter,“fundamental disequilibrium in the balance of
payments”(Lim,2004).
(2) The Asian nations have accumulated much more foreign exchange
reserves than ever before. Their accumulate, accumulate and
accumulate policy has succeeded.Most of them now have money
to lend to the USA. Indeed, in the present sub-prime crises are
affecting many world-class banking and financial institutions, the
Singapore Government agencies: the Government of Singapore
Investment Corporation Pte Ltd. (GIC) and Temasek Holdings
(Private) Limited, acting in their own economic and commercial
interests, have made available billions of dollars ($22 billion) to
The Asian Financial Crisis and the Sub-Prime Mortgage Crisis
107

help out blue-chip iconic financial institutions like UBS, Citigroup
and Merril Lynch.
(3) The Asian nations except Hong Kong and some Gulf States, have
all adopted a floating exchange rate regime, providing a cushion-
ing affect on exchange rate movement. The degree of floating,
including the basket of currencies and the floating band, how-
ever,varies from country to country.
(4) Their regulatory authorities now have more experience in regu-
lating the banking and exchange rate system than before. They
have all learned to pay more respect to the “Impossible Trinity”in
their monetary and exchange rate management, the later formu-
lated “Chiang Mai Initiative”swap arrangement notewithstanding.
The Impossible Trinity
What is this “Impossible Trinity”? The text-book Impossible Trinity
Theory sets out three objectives. It maintains that not all the three
objectives can be achieved simultaneously. There is “trilemma”in the
three objectives.One objective is exchange rate pegging. The second
objective is an independent monetary policy. The third objective is
no control on capital account.
Before the 1997 crisis,Thailand pursued all the three objectives
simultaneously, explaining the eruption of the crisis in Thailand in
1997. Malaysia later successfully stopped the contagion crisis with
the re-introduction of capital control, i.e., effectively removing itself
from the third objective. Indonesia and Thailand also removed the
pegging objective, but with inappropriate measures pursued by
the IMF, the crisis in both countries was prolonged and aggravated
(Lim,2004). There were,inter alia,runs on their banks.
The ASEAN Lost Decade
The fact that the Southeast Asian nations are now better prepared for
an exchange rate crisis does not necessarily imply that their economies
are now much more robust from all perspectives. Up to the time of
writing in October, 2007, none of the original ASEAN 5 economies,
108
Lim Chong Yah

including Singapore,have regained their pre-crisis exchange rate parity.
The Indonesian rupiah,e.g.,at 9,143 rupiahs to US$1 is still 275% lower
than the pre-crisis rate of 2,433 rupiahs.Thailand’s bahts at 31.55 bahts
to a US dollar is still 27.73% lower than the pre-crisis level of 24.70 bahts
to US$1.The Philippines, perennially under IMF tutelage, before and
during the crisis, is worst than Thailand: the Peso has fallen by 69.42%.
Only the Singapore dollar has rebounded quite close to the pre-crisis
level. The Singapore government rightly used the National Wages
Council (NWC),not the IMF,to fight the crisis (Lim,2008).
Even the 2004 per capita GDPs show that,all the original ASEAN 6
contries, including Singapore, still had lower per capita income in US
dollar terms than what they had, before the crisis.Thailand showed
the worst result, with still a 17% decrease in per capita GDP between
1996–2004. Can we say that the crisis impact was the loss of 8 to 10
years for ASEAN in real GDP growth? Not really.Vietnam, with capital
control, increased its corresponding real per capita GDP growth by
68%.Even the much criticized Myanmar,also with capital control,had
a corresponding real per capita GDP increase by 47%.1 Thus, can we
say, with some qualifications, that the crisis ushered in a decade of
lost years for the original ASEAN 6,but not for the new ASEAN 4? This
may be said with some justification (Lim,2007).
However, the recent US sub-prime crisis has ushered in another
important dimension to the recovery of the Southeast Asian economy.
The recent fall in the US dollar and its impact on the Southeast Asian
exchange rates and GDP in US dollar terms have to be taken into con-
sideration. The US dollar’s depreciation in itself will lift up the
Southeast Asian GDP in US dollar terms, but the direct and indirect
transmission of the recession from the USA is likely to somewhat
lower the real GDP growth rates in Southeast Asia.
Capital Control, Trade, GDP and FDI
Returning to the subject of the 1997/98 crisis,it should be mentioned
that Malaysia has still not made its currency fully convertible, which

109
1 Vietnam and Myanmar,2005 figures.

incidentally,is still the position taken by China,Vietnam or India today
and during the crisis period. One question which must be asked is
that, with some control on the capital account, countries like China,
Vietnam and India have displayed superlative growth rates and for rel-
atively long periods. Why is it then necessary to abolish all capital
controls in all its manifestations as advocated by the IMF and the so
called Washington Consensus? A related question is: why was it that,
notwithstanding the pursuit of stringent capital control in a preced-
ing period, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan could also witness superla-
tive growth rates for long periods? Obviously, capital control had no
effect on their trade expansion, FDI inflow or the GDP growth of so
many Asian dynamic economies (Lim,2005).
Meaning of Capital Control
One must add that capital control is likely to mean there is no control
over the flow of funds for trade: visible and invisible trade, income
transfers and FDI flows.The restriction,in varying degrees,is on large-
scale,short-term,purely speculative capital inflow and outflow of the
hedge fund type. Even such a capital control can be made nominal in
character in normal times.
Genesis of New Crisis
However, it would be wrong to assume that an Asian financial crisis
will originate from a country in Asia. The crisis may not be home-
grown. It could be imported or transmitted. All the 4 economic
crises in Singapore: in 1973–1974, 1985, 1998 and 2001–2003, since
Independence,were transmitted from outside. The current sub-prime
crisis originates from the USA.The Northern Rock, one British bank,
had a bank run.Queues of people wanted to withdraw their deposits.
Britain never had a bank run in 100 years.2
110

2 Several days before Easter in March 2008, there was a run by US financial institu-
tions on a world-renowned US investment bank (Bear Stearns), resulting in the
reported sale of the bank to JP Morgan Chase,for a fraction of its original worth.

THE SUB-PRIME CRISIS
About ten years ago, the sub-prime mortgage crisis began to surface
in the United States. The loans to borrowers to buy a house were sub-
prime because the borrowers had no collateral to offer, except the
agreed-to-purchase house as a mortgage. As long as house prices kept
rising, the question of re-payment or servicing the loan was not a
problem to the lenders.The value of the house used as a collateral
would exceed, in most cases far exceed, the loans lent out. The
process went on and on and the sub-prime mortgage practice
expanded by leaps and bounds, ushering further buoyancy in the
housing sector and the economy as a whole. The housing boom was
sustained and appeared sustainable. Everyone, including the transac-
tions regulators, not just the ubiquitous mortgagers and the numer-
ous mortgagees, was happy.The mortgages could also be marketed in
bundles to finance institutions outside the USA,principally to Western
Europe.
The serious problem came,when the housing bubble burst.When
house prices took a nose-drive, borrowers’ loans began to exceed the
values of the mortgaged houses.The borrowers, being sub-prime, had
little or no money to pay back to the banks or other lending financial
intermediaries.The problem led to more serious problems, aggravat-
ing with time as more and more borrowers started to loose their
mortgages. Foreclosures became rampant. More and more financial
institutions got involved.There was the increasing fear that the bub-
ble burst would lead the US into a recession with consequent reces-
sionary impact on the global economy.
For the US economy, the sub-prime housing mortgage problem
was aggravated by fossil oil price increases and the dead-weight war
expenditure in Iraq. US in recent years, under the free-spending prac-
tice encouraged by the State,began to encounter more and more seri-
ous balance of trade deficit on oil account as well as on the overall
trade account.The country’s overspending policy, though raising the
standards of living all round in good times, has resulted in the persist-
ent balance of payment crisis on current account.The US began to
have a balance of payment on current account deficit with almost

every economy on earth, not just with China but also with Japan,
South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the oil-exporting Middle East, the
European Union, Canada and Mexico, although the imbalance with
China was the most serious and caught most of the attention by the
US leadership.The fear that this general imbalance would lead to a
depreciation of the US dollar did occur, the moment the Federal
Reserve interest rate was lowered in August 2007 as a pre-emptive
move to avert a recession originating from the sub-prime crisis.
Fear of a recession in the US increased with time.This fear spread
to the rest of the world, with all the stock-markets becoming the
first victims. Share prices everywhere from New York to Tokyo,
Hong Kong, Singapore to London, Frankfort and Paris all began to
plummet. Fear fed on fear in a circular cumulative causation process
across countries and within each country.
The Federal Reserve under Dr Ben Bernanke started to cut inter-
est rate, but in a little-by-little fashion. Between 12 August 2007 and
11 December 2007,the rate was cut 4 times,either by 0.25% point or
by 0.50% point.This little-by-little piece-meal method was ineffective
in averting the crisis. The sub-prime generated storm became more
and more serious.Finally,the Federal Reserve used a shock therapy,by
suddenly cutting interest rate further by 0.75% point.This, plus the
final announcement of a fiscal stimulus package by the Government
had a reassuring impact on investors.The stock-market all over went
on forward gear,rebounded somewhat.Could the crisis be averted?3
The Liquidity Trap
Of note is that initial interest rate cuts alone could not have done the
trick. In my view, it would most likely lead to a liquidity trap. More
money supply does not guarantee that more money would be
demanded.The marginal efficiency of capital has to be raised before
more demand for money could take place. The problem had to be
handled both from the supply side and the demand side. Besides, if

3 No.The mortgage crisis became more serious. A few days ago before Easter,another
0.75% point cut was announced.

one is told of a further cut in a short while,one tends to procrastinate
or postpone borrowing.
Indeed, when the Japanese housing bubble burst in the late
1980s, the interest rate was eventually cut to near zero percent.This
did not revive the economy. The marginal efficiency of capital
declined with each interest rate cut. The Japanese economic slow-
down persisted up to this day.
The housing bubble bursts in Japan and in the US have one more
attribute in common. Both Governments run a serious budget deficit
in good times. When the lean years appear, further deficits might
result in more taxation at the wrong time.If the further deficits were
financed by printing of more money, inflation would result. And
Dr Bernanke is most fearful of any inflation. More taxes, however,
would make the recession worse. The policy-makers hoped that
more expenditure, would be financed by both local and foreign bor-
rowing.This increased expenditure would hopefully put the incipi-
ent recession to an end. The question of paying back the increased
debts would be left to the next President to solve, not the current
incumbent, Mr George Bush.
If the US had a budget surplus and had accumulated reserves, the
solution would be much simpler; utilize the accumulated reserves to
finance the new deficit. But the US had twin deficits, serious ones at
that, for quite some-time already.That was the Bush Administration’s
mismanagement of the economy. Indeed, the profligate policy of the
US Treasury does not even qualify USA for joining the European
Union.This is because of the latter’s much more stringent standard in
budgetary deficit policy,of not exceeding 3% of the GDP in the worst
of times,and a fiscal balance in normal times.
Besides, the central bank in the US appears most reluctant to act
as a lender of last resort, which is one of its basic functions. It does
not want to bail out the financial institutions in trouble. It could not
overcome the moral hazard problem.Some well-known iconic institu-
tions like Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, thus, sought a
helping line from outside, like from the Sovereign Wealth Funds, such
as Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited and the Government of
Singapore Investment Corporation Pte Ltd (GIC). If the economic
The Asian Financial Crisis and the Sub-Prime Mortgage Crisis
113

conditions deteriorate further within and outside the USA,the help of
other Sovereign Wealth Funds such as from China’s CIC and from the
Gulf States might have to be resorted to. Japan,which has the second
largest foreign exchange reserves in the world, appeared quite reti-
cent on this matter, except that Japan has declared that it would nei-
ther lower any interest rate nor have a fiscal stimulus. In parenthesis,
one could add that Japan had this experience of fighting a recession
and slow growth earlier,before the US sub-prime crisis.
The Unanswered Questions
Three basic issues in this sub-prime generated turmoil have
remained unanswered:
(1) The role of the regulator not just as a lender of last resort but as
a preventor of first resort.Why did the US central bank allow the
sub-prime problem to emerge and to become so serious, includ-
ing the world-wide contagion effect? Should Mr Alan Greenspan,
the famous financial wizard not shoulder some responsibility in
the spread and multiplication of the sub-prime mortgages in the
USA under his nose as the Chairman of the US central bank?
(2) Why did Dr Bernanke, the present Chairman, not have shock ther-
apy to begin with, and to have the support of an effective fiscal
package to handle the sub-prime crisis?4 Could it be that the Federal
Reserve and the US Treasury were not certain about the impend-
ing recession or stagflation? At times, the US central bank appeared
to be more worried about inflation than recession.This uncertainty
and ambiguity in the diagnosis must have contributed to the type
of extremely mild and seemingly uncoordinated prescriptions.5
(3) The complete silence of the globally well-known Council of
Economic Advisers on such a serious economic matter.What has
gone wrong?
114
Lim Chong Yah
4 Near Easter,the Fed cut its internal rate by a further 0.75%,another of its piece-meal
exercise. This will again the perceived as a palliative,rather than an effective cure.
5 No package of monetary and fiscal measures have been announced thus far.

The World Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs)
One more important point should be mentioned,the rightness of the
Asian nations in accumulating foreign exchange reserves to meet the
needs of a possible financial crisis, whether it originates from a bal-
ance of payment problem or from other sources are quite immate-
rial.The prescription for the malady is there and is available.Another
point worth mentioning is that the IMF remains quite reticent
throughout on the US crisis particularly on sermons on its causes
and cures. Is it because the IMF has no effective role to play when
the US Treasury is involved? Or is it because the US economy is too
big for the IMF to handle or help? Probably, both factors are relevant
to the IMF option in non-involvement or advice given to the US
Treasury or the Federal Reserve Board or the managers of the SWFs
to assist in limiting the sub-prime crisis from metastasizing within
and beyond the USA.
Economic Theory and Economic Management
Three economic theories that are particularly relevant to the search
for a solution to the prevailing sub-prime mortgage crisis in the USA
will be briefly discussed here. (1) Monetarism, (2) Keynesianism and
(3) the S curve hypothesis.
(1) Monetarism
Monetarism postulates the control of money supply to regulate infla-
tion. The greatest advocate of this approach was Milton Friedman.
He had a point. He argued that inflation is a monetary phenomenon.
One should thus reduce money supply to fight inflation. In his time
particularly in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the huge US budget
deficit was financed by the printing of more money.Thus, the cure
must be to cut down money supply. The text-book inflation equation
π = m. − y. + v. (Lim, 2004) has general validity, where π refers to the
inflation rate,m. — growth rate of money supply,y.— real GDP growth
rate and v.— the change in the velocity of circulation of money.If the
The Asian Financial Crisis and the Sub-Prime Mortgage Crisis
115

diagnosis is inflation, as appeared to be the position taken by the
European Central Bank,then a monetarist solution is particularly rele-
vant. This may include the upping of interest rate.
However,in the US sub-prime crisis,inflation is not,or not yet,the
problem.The problem is recession. The European Central Bank, how-
ever, did not share this view. It was afraid of inflation in Europe.
As stated earlier, this equivocation arose from the equivocal diagnosis
of the sub-prime crisis. Even in the USA, the severity was under-
estimated. This probably accounted for the miniscule cut in the inter-
est rate and up to the time of writing 5 separate cuts had to be made
and in such a short span of time.But Friedman was handling inflation,
not recession.
(2) Keynesianism
More relevant to handling a recession is Keynesianism. In Keynes’s
General Theory, only recession was featured. To Keynes, in a reces-
sion, monetary policy alone would not be effective. In other words,
cheap monetary policy alone would not work.The reason is that it
does not automatically lead to an increase in effective demand.Then
firstly, why did Dr Bernanke use interest rate to fight the impending
recession? Secondly, why did he commence the fight in a crawling,
bit-by-bit,process? Probably,he has no influence over the US Treasury
and its fiscal policy. Besides, he probably also underestimates the seri-
ousness of the mortgage crisis. Thirdly, he probably was not aware
that Japan in earlier years failed to lift up its economy by cutting inter-
est rate even to near zero percent.
Ultimately, in the US, fiscal policy had to be roped in, as is the
main advocacy of Keynesianism.To Keynes, to fight a recession, one
must run a budget deficit. One must increase public spending: more
spending,more spending and more spending.
But it was during the US presidential primaries that Senator
Hillary Clinton, one of the most-prominent candidates, advocated a
US$70 billion injection into the fiscal system. Senator Barack Obama,
her equally prominent rival in the Democratic front, maintained that
116
Lim Chong Yah

US$70 billion was insufficient.It should be US$80 billion.The outcome
of the debate is that Mr George Bush, the Republican President, pro-
posed a US$150 billion fiscal stimulus, simply by adding the two pro-
posals! The President’s proposal has been eventually accepted by the
US Congress. But US$150 billion may sound so big to the outside
world.It is,however,only a trifle for by far the biggest economy in the
world. It adds up to only 1% of US GDP! Can this be an effective
counter-recession policy? I doubt the adequacy and therefore the effec-
tiveness. But if the world believes in this cure, it could still work. US
thus would not slip into a technical recession,defined as two consecu-
tive negative real growth rates on a q-o-q (quarter on quarter) basis.
The 1998 Crisis in Singapore
When Singapore was faced with the Asian financial crisis in 1998, the
deflation in money income and costs of production advocated and
adopted by the Singapore Government came to 20% of our GDP. One
third took the form of cuts in taxes and fees. One third was a cut
in employers’ contribution to CPF and the other third was a cut in
end-of the year bonuses (Lim, 1998).True, Singapore could get from
accumulated reserves, if it wanted to. Since the US made no contin-
gency reserve provision,the financing might have to come from more
foreign borrowing and if need be, from the printing of more money.
Recession in the post-Keynesian world can be quite easily handled,
particularly if preparedness is there. That preparedness does not
appear to be there in the USA.There has also been excessive reliance
on monetary policy, side-lining the increase in effective demand
option.
The US Twin Deficits
The US twin deficits would be worsened, with the US budget stimu-
lus.The bigger the budget stimulus, the bigger will be the US budget
and current account deficits.The bigger current account deficit could
easily generate bigger pressures for the further depreciation of the US

dollar. The East Asian nations are now facing a different foreign
exchange adjustment problem. In the 1997/98 crisis, the US dollar
appreciation left many of those countries having to devalue.Now,it is
the opposite. But the pressure on foreign exchange adjustment is eas-
ier to handle in an appreciating local currency than to follow the US
dollar’s upward movement.In the former case,they can just sell more
of their local money. In the later case, they need more foreign
reserves to buy up more local currencies.
(3) The S Curve Hypothesis
According to this hypothesis,the developed economies,being already
well developed,will display a low rate of GDP growth,from 1% to 4%,
when the built-in growth momentum is to be depended upon,for fur-
ther growth. A higher growth rate (>4%) has to come from seismic
changes in the growth parameters. The theory also postulates that,
growth is to come from more capital spending, the expansion of pro-
ductive capacity; effective production. This means production to
meet market demand,including foreign demand.Zero or negative sav-
ings rate in the US can only lead to balance of payments problem. It
also implies poor performance by a large number of corporations
with little undistributed profits (savings) for expansion or into new
lines of corporate endeavors.
The US stimulus package, though small, relative to the US econ-
omy, is focussed on consumption spending, not on capital expendi-
ture.This is likely to result in more serious current account deficit,
which means greater pressure for the US dollar to depreciate and
more pressure for China to re-value.
This balance of payments pressure did not happen to Japan.This
is because Japan had and still has only the budget deficit problem to
contend with. It had and still has huge current account surpluses.
Besides, Japan did not have to depend upon foreign countries to buy
its treasury bills to finance its budget deficit. It is through internal
borrowing. Notwithstanding that, the repayment burden of the soci-
ety through taxes cannot be overlooked.The passing of the debt bur-
den to future generations has become quite fashionable in some
118
Lim Chong Yah

developed countries. The term used is the inter-generation transfer of
debt burden. So, if the S Curve Theory is correct, if the US economy
rebounds, which, with the effluxion of time, the rebounded real GDP
growth rate will slow-down, to the levels of Japan and Western
Europe, with, however, the twin deficit problems unresolved. The
slow-down in the US will be from the hitherto 3%–4%, the upper
range of the S Curve to the lower range of 1–2%, which is the charac-
teristic of the S Curve for old matured economies of Europe and
Japan.
However, if the housing mortgage crisis metastasizes into, say, a
sub-prime credit card crisis,then there would be no choice for the US
Treasury but to increase the budget stimulus as a rescue operation.At
any rate, the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board would have
to operate in consort with each other to effect the optimum anti-
recessionary impact.They seem to operate separately and independ-
ently,up to this point,i.e.,one direct attack on the sub-prime problem
is, for the State to encourage the re-payment of prior mortgage rates
within, say, the next 4 years, at a reducing subsidized rate of 40% to
30%, 20%, and then to 10%, with the State and the lenders (mort-
gagees) co-shouldering an equal share of the burden.The State pays
the fine for the negligence of regulatory oversight;the mortgagees,for
greed in sub-prime lending.This rescue device has to be accompanied
by more and more investment, supplemented by greater FDI inflows,
including WSF inflows into the open sectors.The alternative is for the
economy to slide down to recession, and if only aggressive interest
rate cut is used, the end-result is likely to be the continuation or even
aggravation of the sub-prime malaise.Inflationary pressures,however,
might willy nilly be the ultimate cure, as such pressures could result
in the rise in asset prices, including house prices, as well, with the
public paying the general price for a general lower standard of living.
The country could blunder its way through.

INTRODUCTION
Along with the high rates of saving and investment and high levels of
education, an important component of East Asia’s development model
of the past five decades or so, was to open its economies to interna-
tional trade and investment.This drive involved granting trade prefer-
ences to all countries unilaterally — the so-called “most-favored-nation”
approach under the GATT/WTO framework. The focus was on “sequen-
tial” not “interdependent” development. Described in Akamatsu’s
(1962) “flying geese”analysis,the model involved the transfer of export
markets from the more advanced to less advanced countries. Japan
began as a producer of low-priced final consumer goods and later
moved on into capital-intensive intermediate and capital goods.Then
the second-generation countries (the newly industrializing economies
(NIEs) comprising Hong Kong, China; Republic of Korea;Taiwan; and
Singapore) moved into the vacated consumer goods assembly in the
1960s. Similarly, in the 1970s and the 1980s the third (Indonesia,
Malaysia,Philippines,and Thailand) and the fourth generation countries
121

(People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Viet Nam) moved in to fill the
gaps left by the NIEs. An alternative description of the East Asian devel-
opment pattern is the S Curve theory of Lim (2004).Here we have the
“elephants”,“horses”, and “turtles”moving along the S curve.1 In terms
of economic and social transformation, East Asia achieved in 40 years
what took 300 years in Europe (Mahbubani,2008).
Despite the lack of integrationist approach in the East Asian devel-
opment model,the region’s market-led integration with the world flour-
ished in tandem with its integration with the region (at least,in absolute
terms) (see Fig. 1).2 This was because of policy reforms, economic
dynamism,and the establishment of vertical production networks.Since
The financial crisis of 1997–1998 focused the region’s attention on its
inter-dependence and shared interests and East Asia became keen to
support market-led integration with policy efforts.3,4 The major factor
that ignited the interest of East Asian countries to regional monetary and
financial integration was the virulent contagion of the East Asian finan-
cial crisis and the policy mistakes made by the IMF in managing it.5
It was also felt that the resources of the IMF were fairly limited and that it
122

1This approach differed from the Latin American and the African development model
where import-substitution policies at the national level were expanded to cover geo-
graphical sub-regions (e.g.,the Latin American Free Trade Area and the Latin American
Common Market). They were “closed regionalism”and did not do well.
2 Unless mentioned otherwise, East Asia is defined as ASEAN+3 (ASEAN plus PRC,
Japan,and Republic of Korea) plus Hong Kong,China and  Taipei.
3 Economic integration refers to the elimination of frontiers to the flow of goods,
services,and factors of production.It can be market-led or policy led.Market-led inte-
gration is increasing convergence of economic parameters due to activities of market
participants while policy-led integration is due to national policies to enhance
regional cooperation.
4 Another paradigm shift in the East Asian model is the emphasis placed on financial
sector development. For various reasons, this sector was repressed during the pre-
crisis period.The Asian financial crisis also ignited the debate on the reform of the
international financial architecture including the reform of the IMF.
5 Given that the Asian financial crisis was a capital account crisis, the IMF should not
have required Asian countries to tighten fiscal policy and raise interest rates.It should
also not have gone overboard in requiring these countries to meet many structural
conditions that were imposed in its program. Its approach to financial and corporate
reforms was also inappropriate, at least, in Indonesia (Isard, 2005). Subsequently, the
IMF accepted many of these criticisms (IMF,2003).

might not have adequate resources to handle a capital-account crisis
associated with large surges and outflows of short-term private capital.
Slow progress in the Doha Round under the auspices of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and the popularity of regionalism elsewhere (e.g.,
European Union (EU) and North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA)) also encouraged East Asian countries to promote regionalism
in trade (Kawai, 2005).Additional factors were the desire to internalize
the benefits of growing interdependence and the realization that region-
alism could help maximize the benefits of globalization and minimize
the costs. In the post-crisis period, East Asia realized that it needed to
be more self-reliant and gain fuller control of its destiny (MAS,2007).
Regionalism in Asia has two features. First, it covers four areas in
terms of scope — trade, finance, macroeconomic policy/monetary
integration and regional public goods (e.g., environment and water
sharing).6 Second, in terms of geographical coverage, it has been

mainly bilateral or subregional.More recently,bridges are also starting
to be built across the subregions (e.g., the initiation of the East Asia
Summit and the large number of free trade agreements (FTAs) under
negotiation between South Asia and East Asia).
Against this background, the objectives of this Chapter are to:
(1) review trends in East Asian regionalism including identifying the
next steps (2) review trends in the second phase of Asian economic
integration which is the evolution of economic relations between
South Asia and East Asia or Pan-Asian integration, and (3) discuss
Singapore’s role.
TRADE, FINANCE, AND MACROECONOMIC
POLICY/MONETARY INTEGRATION
IN EAST ASIA 
On trade integration, East Asia has made encouraging progress with
intra-regional trade reaching 55% of total trade in 20057 (up from 43%
in 1990), which is higher than the level for NAFTA (46%) but lower
than that for the EU (67%) (see Fig. 2). Much of this expansion has
been driven by market forces especially the establishment of vertical
production networks in the region. The traditional production net-
works were triangular where Japan and the NIEs exported parts for
electrical appliances, office and telecom equipment and textiles and
garments industry to the PRC and the third generation countries
(Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand) which in turn com-
pleted the processing and exported the final product to markets in the
US and Europe. Since the mid-1990s, more sophisticated and complex
production networks have emerged which involve transshipment of
components — back and forth trade in parts and components across
Asian countries (Gill and Kharas, 2007).With the rapid emergence of
PRC,these networks are being increasingly centered in the PRC.
Given the uncertainties and risks in the multilateral trading sys-
tem, the momentum for Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) has also
124
Pradumna Bickram Rana

although increasing since 1995,stood at only 5.6% in 2005.

increased in East Asia with some 175 such agreements in existence
or under negotiation compared with just a handful, a decade ago.
The latest are the Economic Partnership Agreements that Japan
signed with Indonesia and the one it is negotiating with India
(expected to be concluded by the end of next year). FTAs will no
doubt proliferate further if the Doha Round continues to falter. If
they are designed properly, FTAs can help countries reap the bene-
fits of their comparative advantage.That is why FTAs are allowed as
exceptions to the anti-discrimination rules of the GATT/WTO. But
there is a risk that the proliferation of FTAs could come at the
expense of trade with nonmembers, known as trade diversion. It
could also create an “Asian noodle bowl” effect and raise administra-
tive costs of trade. FTAs should, therefore, be consistent with WTO.
They should also be compatible with other FTAs in the region.
Broadening the membership of FTAs and deepening their coverage
beyond tariffs into services, investments, technological cooperation,
etc. (called FTA Pluses) is one way of making FTAs stepping stones
rather than stumbling blocks to multilateralism.

Lack of data makes it difficult to measure the level of financial
integration in East Asia, but those that are available suggest that it is
now starting to increase, albeit from low levels (MAS, 2007; Rana,
2007).Available price and quantity measures of financial integration
in East Asia are in Fig. 3. East Asian countries have taken collective
actions to develop local currency bond markets as these markets will
reduce the “double mismatch”problem,which was at the heart of the
crisis, and overcome the so-called “original sin” problem.8 The basic
idea is to mobilize the region’s vast pool of savings to be intermedi-
ated directly to the region’s long-term investment, without going
through financial intermediaries outside the region.Regional financial
intermediation through bond markets would diversify the modes of

8 The “double mismatch” problem refers to borrowing unhedged foreign funds to
lend long-term in domestic currency and borrowing short-term to lend long-term.
The “original sin” is a situation where emerging economy residents cannot borrow
abroad in domestic currency nor borrow long-term,even domestically.Hence domes-
tic banks and corporations tend to face a currency or maturity mismatch or both,
thus facing balance-sheet vulnerabilities to sharp changes in exchange rates and/or
interest rates.

financing in the region and reduce the double mismatch. The initia-
tives include the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Bond
Initiative, the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia Pacific central banks
(EMEAP), Asian Bond Fund (ABF) Initiative and the ASEAN+3 Asian
Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI).
EMEAP introduced the ABF in June 2003 in order to help expand
bond markets through demand-side stimulus through central bank
purchases of sovereign and quasi-sovereign bonds issued by 8 EMEAP
emerging members (including PRC, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea,
Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) using all eleven mem-
bers’ foreign exchange reserves.The initial attempt was to purchase
US$1 billion of US dollar-denominated bonds (ABF-1). Given the
recognition that local-currency denominated bonds need to be pro-
moted in order to address the “double mismatch”problem,the central
bankers introduced ABF-2 in December 2004, involving purchases of
US$2 billion equivalent of sovereign and quasi-sovereign local cur-
rency-denominated bonds.
Macroeconomic policy/monetary integration is essentially a post-
crisis phenomenon in East Asia.There is an ascending order of inten-
sity of these efforts in the sense that they involve progressively
increasing constraints on the amount of discretion that individual
countries can exercise in the design of macroeconomic policies. By
level of intensity,these efforts have ranged from economic review and
policy dialogue to establishing regional financing arrangements and
eventually toward coordinating exchange rate policies. East Asian gov-
ernments have (1) started to engage each other in policy dialogues
(the two recent initiatives are the ASEAN Surveillance Process and the
ASEAN+3 Economic Review and Policy Dialogue)9; (2) established
a regional financing mechanism — the Chiang Mai Initiative
(CMI) under which 16 bilateral swaps amounting to US$83 billion
have been established and efforts to multilateralize the bilateral swaps
128

9 The earlier initiatives under the auspices of the central banks in the region are
EMEAP, SEACEN, and SEANZA. The ASEAN+3 group has also taken steps to monitor
short-term capital flows and to develop early warning systems of currency and bank-
ing crises.

are ongoing; and (3) initiated discussion on how exchange policies
could be coordinated possibly through the use of an Asian Currency
Unit (ACU) which would be a basket of currencies. An ASEAN+3
Research Group, comprising about 30 think tanks from across the
region,has been set up to support the groups.
In East Asia,most of the poor live in remote or isolated areas,espe-
cially in regions close to national borders. They need to be linked to
commercial and industrial centers not only in their own countries
but to those in other countries in the region and beyond — via high-
ways, railways, ports, telecommunications, and other hard infrastruc-
ture. The “software” aspects of infrastructure development, including
trade facilitation, are also important to reduce transportation costs.
Greater connectivity enhances trade and investment integration by
facilitating the movement of goods. The most advanced program in
East Asia is the Greater Mekong Subregion — comprising Cambodia,
Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand,Viet Nam, and
the Yunnan Province of the PRC. Other initiatives include the Brunei
Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area
and Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle.
East Asia’s market-led integration, which now, is also being driven
by various policy actions, is expected to deepen further. One reason
for optimism is that the increasing level of trade integration has led to
a greater synchronization of output and business cycles in the region.
This means that symmetric shocks are expected to prevail enhancing
the case for cooperation and coordination of policies (Rana,2008).
Going forward, Asian economic integration is expected to follow
what Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong (2006) once referred to as the
“variable geometry, flexible borders” approach.The process will be
multi-track with a trade (including infrastructure), finance, and macro-
economic policies/monetary integration track. On the trade track,
efforts should be made to (1) make the FTAs compatible with each
other (by having similar rules of origin as in Europe) and (2) consolidate
the proliferation of FTAs into a deeper and wider FTA such as the East
Asian FTA (including India). Kawai and Wignaraja (2007) have shown
that an ASEAN+6 FTA would provide more gains than an ASEAN+3 FTA.
Connectivity issues including infrastructure development and trade
facilitation are also being addressed.
Asian Economic Integration

On the finance track, Asian bond markets should be developed
further.Regional institutions to deepen local-currency bond markets —
such as a regional credit guarantee institution and a regional settlement
agency — need to be established. With the progress in reforming mar-
ket infrastructure at the national levels, a regional regulatory agency
that promotes coordination of capital market rules and regulations
may be developed in the future.
On the macroeconomic policy/monetary track, efforts to multilat-
eralize the Ching Mai Initiative (CMI) should be continued. At their
meeting in Hyderabad in 2006, the ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers
decided that “all swap providing countries can simultaneously and
promptly provide liquidity support to any parties involved in bilateral
swap arrangements at times of emergency”.At their Kyoto meeting in
2007, the Ministers decided to establish a “self-managed reserve pool-
ing arrangement” for which the details are being worked out.At their
May 2008 meeting in Madrid, the Ministers “agreed that the total size
of the multilateralized CMI would be at least US$ 80 billion.” The next
steps are to further expand the size of the swaps, multilateralize
it,and reduce the linkage to the IMF.Over the medium-term,a centrally
administered reserve pool (a fund) could be established. As part of this
process, concerted efforts must be made to establish a formal “peer
review”and “peer pressure”mechanism similar to that of the OECD.
The deepening regional and financial integration in the region
together with the synchronization of business cycles suggests that,
East Asia should initiate actions to coordinate exchange rate policies
using a step-by-step approach. The first step could be to promote
greater exchange rate flexibility while maintaining a certain amount
of intra-regional stability by monitoring deviations from an ACU bas-
ket (Kawai and Rana,2008).
Some commentators see recent trends in the region as heralding
the eventual adoption of a single currency or the establishment of
an East Asian monetary union. Europe’s experience shows that a
monetary union imposes stringent demands on policy coordination
and institution building that needs strong political will and a strong
sense of common purpose which East Asia lacks at the present
(MAS, 2007).
130

In addition to being multi-track, East Asian regionalism is also
expected to be multi-speed — with the pace of progress for different
aspects of regional cooperation and integration varying and with new
members,joining as and when they feel that they are ready to do so.It
will also be a bottom-up approach as compared to the European
institution-led top-down approach.
Regionalism in East Asia is expected to improve the medium- and
long-term economic outlook for the region and enhance the region’s
resilience to external shocks through the expansion of trade and
investment based on comparative advantages of member countries;
lead to greater monetary and financial stability and prevent financial
crises; and provide cross-border connectivity which is essential for
the movement of goods, services, labor, and information across coun-
tries. Competitiveness, industrial production, and productivity of East
Asian countries are expected to increase.
THE SECOND PHASE OF ASIAN INTEGRATION:
ECONOMIC RELATIONS BETWEEN SOUTH ASIA
AND EAST ASIA10
Prior to 1990,South Asian and East Asian countries were relatively iso-
lated from one another in terms of economic relations and there was
little talk of Pan-Asian integration. The only trade agreement that cov-
ered the two sub-regions was the Bangkok agreement signed in 1975
(now called the Asia-Pacific trade agreement). The adoption of the
“Look East Policy”in India in 1991 and similar policies in other South
Asian countries together with the economic dynamism of India and
PRC, has now heightened the interest in the process of Pan-Asian
integration particularly on the evolving economic relationships
between the two subregions.
South Asia’s total merchandise trade with East Asia has grown
significantly in absolute terms albeit from a low base. It increased
eight-fold during 1990–2006, from US$12.4 billion to US$96.8 billion
(see Fig. 4), for an average annual growth rate of 14.6%.The annual
Asian Economic Integration
131

growth rate was relatively moderate until 2000,but it has surged after
that, growing by 26.2% per annum. As expected, a large part of the
increase in South Asia-East Asia trade is accounted by the bilateral
trade between the two giant economies of India and PRC.
Data in Fig. 5 show that East Asia accounted for 18.9% of South
Asia’s total trade in 1990 and about 21% in 1994, before it fell back to
about 18% in 2000.Since then,however,it has been increasing,reaching
about 24% in 2006.On the other hand,South Asia accounted for a mere
1.3% of East Asia’s trade and a slightly higher 1.9% in 2006. Hence, East
Asia is a more important trading partner for South Asia than vice versa.
In 2006, Pan-Asian intra- and inter-regional trade stood at US$2.1
trillion of which East Asian intra-regional trade accounted for 93.6%
followed by inter-regional trade between South Asia and East Asia (see
Table 1). Intra-South Asian trade accounted for only 0.8% and intra-
Central Asian trade,an even lower percentage (0.2%).

The absence of comparable data on FDI by source,limits an analy-
sis of investment relationships between South Asia and East Asia.The
data that are available from national sources and the ASEAN
Secretariat show that investment relations between the two regions,
although starting to increase in recent years,is still limited.
Calculation of revealed comparative advantage indices shows
that, although there are overlaps there is a potential for enhancing
trade between the two regions.South Asia has comparative advantage
mainly in primary goods and labor-intensive manufactures and IT
services, while East Asia has comparative advantage across a much
wider range of products.These include primary goods such as crude
rubber and fish, labor-intensive manufactures such as textiles, travel
goods and footwear,and more capital- and knowledge-intensive items
such as office machines and telecommunications equipments.
More recently,as in other parts of the world,there has been a pro-
liferation of FTAs between South Asia and East Asia. The most significant
of these, so far, is the signing of the India-Singapore Comprehensive
Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) on June 2005.The CECA
became effective in August 2005 and covers not only trade in goods
but also services, investments and cooperation in technology, educa-
tion, air services, and human resources.Various South Asian countries
are also members of the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement under the aus-
pices of UN ESCAP. In addition, 8 FTA framework agreements have
been signed between South and East Asian countries.These are the
ASEAN-India, India-Thailand, BIMSTEC, PRC-Pakistan, India-Korea,
Malaysia-Pakistan, Pakistan-Singapore, and Pakistan-Indonesia FTAs.
Another six FTAs have been proposed — China-India, Japan-India,
Malaysia-India, Pakistan-Philippines, Pakistan-Thailand, and Singapore-
Sri Lanka FTAs.
A number of policy actions could be taken to increase the level of
South Asia-East Asia integration.First,the levels of tariffs and NTBs are
already low in many East Asian countries and since the 1990s South
Asia has also made encouraging progress in the same direction.However,
there is room for further reductions in tariffs and NTBs in both
regions (especially NTBs in East Asia because tariffs are already low).
Second,in addition to reducing tariffs and NTBs,South Asian countries
134
Pradumna Bickram Rana

and several East Asian countries also need to make progress in imple-
menting the remaining reform agenda — namely, developing the
social (e.g., schools, hospitals, rural medical centers) and physical
(power, water, roads, railways) infrastructure and implementing the
so-called second generation reforms to enhance transparency, good
governance, and human capital.These include, among others, reforms
of civil service and of delivery of public goods, creating an environ-
ment that is conducive to private sector opportunities (greater com-
petition,better regulations,and stronger property rights),and reforms
of institutions that create human capital (e.g. health and education).
Third, South and East Asian countries need to consolidate their FTAs.
Francois, Rana, and Wignaraja (2008 forthcoming) support this find-
ing. Countries should also deepen FTAs — extend coverage beyond
trade in goods into services,investment,technology etc.
The fourth measure that could impact significantly on the level of
trade between South Asia and East Asia is the reduction of trading
costs. This could be brought about through investment in trade-
related infrastructure and streamlining of cross-border procedures
(including customs procedures and logistic costs). Most cargo
between South Asia and East Asia moves by water (see Fig. 6) and air
(although South Asia does not have an air freight hub yet, Fig. 7) as
there is no land transport services that are operational at the present
time. Land transit through Myanmar — shown in the Asian Highway
concept (Fig.8) — is not possible at the present time.Additional corri-
dors between India and PRC through Bhutan and Nepal will have to
be developed. PRC has plans to extend the recently-opened Qinghai-
Tibet railway (see Fig. 9) to Nepal and India. Regional shipping lines
also have to be developed. Countries should make efforts to reduce
transport and logistic constraints to facilitate movement of goods
between the two regions.These include delays in customs inspection,
cargo handling and transfer, and processing of documents. Customs
procedures could be modernized by (1) aligning the customs code to
international standards, (2) simplifying and harmonizing procedures,
(3) making tariff structures consistent with the international harmo-
nized tariff classification,and (4) adopting and implementing the WTO
Customs Valuation Agreement.

Finally, trade promotion efforts through skillful economic diplo-
macy,regular exchange of business delegations and civil society could
be encouraged a lot more. People-to-people contacts can go a long
way in enhancing the level of trade and investment across countries.
THE ROLE OF SINGAPORE
Singapore is one of the most open and trade dependent country in
the world and, therefore, its approach to integration is a two-track

one. Global efforts and multilateralism is the most efficient and,
therefore,the first best.However,regionalism can also be supported if
it complements multilateralism. Prime Minister Lee at the APEC
Summit last year said “I don’t see the APEC Free Trade Agreement pro-
posal as Plan B, I think it is complementary to the Doha Round”. As a
major regional and international trading and financial center,
Singapore is playing an important role in Asian integration.
Singapore is involved in all sub-regional groups and it was the
Chair of the APEC Summit in 2000 and the Chair of the ASEAN and
East Asia Summit last year. Two important agreements were signed
at the ASEAN Summit.The ASEAN Charter seeks to make integration
rules based, but its ratification by members may take time. Recently,
Singapore has proposed that the ASEAN minus X principle be applied
so that the Charter can come into force even before each and every
member has ratified it within the one-year period. The proposal to
establish an ASEAN Economic Community (a single market) by 2015
is also appropriate but progress must be monitored carefully.
138

Singapore is active in various regional initiatives. In terms of sign-
ing FTAs, having signed 28 bilateral or plurilateral FTAs, Singapore is
the most prolific among the East Asian countries.The Singapore–India
Comprehensive Economic Cooperation serves as a role model for the
newer generation FTAs pluses that go beyond trade into services,
investment and technology cooperation. Singapore has also signed
investment agreements with various countries (e.g., connectivity
agreement with Viet Nam several years back and the Singapore–
Viet Nam investment parks).Singapore participates actively in various
regional fora chairing several working groups.
Singapore is actively involved in building links between South
Asia and East Asia and the Middle East. Although it is now a modern
manufacturing and service hub,this reflects the enterpot trade role of
Singapore which still accounts for close to 40% of Singapore’s total
trade (Lim, 2004). Logistics is very well developed in Singapore and a
lion’s share of the trade between South Asia and East Asia passes
through Singapore. Many South Asian countries view Singapore as a
good secondary base to maintain some of their operations for over-
seas including those in PRC and other ASEAN countries.
In its efforts to develop its service sector further, Singapore is
increasingly emerging as the knowledge hub for Asian economic inte-
gration.This can be assessed from the activities of think tanks in the
country and the conferences that are organized on the subject.
Singapore could also provide technical advice and training to other
countries in the region.

Asia’s Role in the Global Economy
and the International Financial System
Chia Wai-Mun, Zhang Yang and Yang Bo
SUMMARY
In the past twenty years, globalization has led to increasing connect-
edness and integration between countries. Asia has utilized this
opportunity and enjoyed a continuous rapid economic growth. At
the same time,this “double-edged sword”also brought costs and pains
to Asia especially in the Asian Financial Crisis.
Having experienced both benefits and costs,it is essential for Asia
to identify its role in the global economy and the international finan-
cial system, so as to stand at a better position in the following glob-
alization process. In this chapter, we focus on Asia’s role in two
scenerios.
First, we look at the possibility of Asia in negotiating for a greater
role in the international institutions such as International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and World Bank.As a result of its rising economic weight
in the world economy, Asia needs to negotiate for greater responsibil-
ities and representations in these institutions, so that the region has a
141

larger role to play in the construction of world economic and finan-
cial system as well as regional crisis management.
Second, in the event where such negotiation for greater responsi-
bilities failed, we suggest the idea of forming Asia’s own independent
regional institutions so that the region is responsible for its own eco-
nomic destiny.We then focus on Asia’s role in the new era of world’s
economy — a tripartite arrangement, in which the world consists of
three major regional blocks, namely, the US, EU and Asia.We identify
a few areas in which Asian countries should work on in the process
of forming the block, and also discuss the challenges and obstacles
ahead.
INTRODUCTION
Globalization, a process that has led to increasing connectedness and
integration between countries, has accelerated since the mid-twenti-
eth century. Countries have become more closely connected as evi-
dent in increasing flows of goods and services, financial resources
and technology transfers across national borders. On the trade side,
globalization leads countries to many significant benefits which
include lower-priced goods and broader variety of goods to con-
sumers. On the capital side, globalization allows international capital
flows to finance production facilities in countries where labor is rela-
tively abundant and capital is relatively scarce. Like many other coun-
tries, Asia1 receives significant economic benefits from the process of
greater economic integration.For instance,its purchasing power parity
output has surged from US$4,242 billion in 1986 to US$22,274 billion
in 2006 and its trade with the rest of the world has increased by
7 times within the 20 years.

1 For the purpose of this study, unless otherwise stated,Asia includes the ten mem-
bers of ASEAN, Japan, China, South Korea and India.The ten members of ASEAN are
Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore,Thailand
and Vietnam.

Nevertheless, the process of globalization has also disrupted the
economic circumstances of many people.On the trade side,it widens
income gaps between rich and poor countries along with rising
inequality and poverty within countries. On the capital side, it has
been viewed as a source of destabilization when large volumes of
capital inflows are followed by sharp capital decelerations and rever-
sals, and more importantly the effects are highly contagious in which
a financial crisis in one country triggers substantial financial market
turbulence in other countries. With all these arguments in mind,
although the benefits of globalization are recognized, it comes with
very high costs. However, an attempt to turn back the clock of this
process can be too disturbing and damaging. The magnitude of
destruction may be of equivalent to the kind associated with the pro-
tectionist and inward-looking beggar-thy-neighbor policies that con-
tributed to the 1930s’ Great Depression. In other words, there is a
constant risk of a setback towards protectionism if the world trading
system and the world financial system do not continue to liberalize.
From these perspectives,while identifying Asia’s role in the global
economy and the international financial system, the key challenge is
to devise effective ways for national policymakers, regional agencies,
and international institutions to address problems associated with
greater economic integration. In other words, the task is to identify
the role of Asia in strengthening national, regional and international
institutions for greater economic stability and success in the process
of integration and globalization.
In this chapter, we focus on the need to negotiate for greater
responsibilities of Asia in international institutions commensurate
with its growing economic weight.This is particularly true with the
rise of China since 1980s and recently, India.A failure in such negotia-
tion will imply the consideration of forming its own independent
regional institutions so that the region is responsible for its own eco-
nomic destiny. The analysis is made by limiting the attention to the
role of Asia in economic welfare,ignoring considerations in the issues
related to environment,the stability of cultures and political systems.

1. AN OVERVIEW OF ASIA’S DEVELOPMENT
The aggregate economy and external trade with the rest of the world
have grown in volumes which are as large as those of the US and the
EU.As shown in Table 1,the purchasing power parity (PPP) output of
Asia has improved from US$4,242 billion to US$22,274 billion from
1986 to 2006. On the other hand, the current price output has
increased from US$2,911 billion to US$10,006 billion.
In terms of the PPP output in Asia, China has demonstrated the
most impressive improvement since 1980 where the output has been
raised by more that tenfold.This can be seen clearly from Fig.1.
1.1. Trade in Goods
External trade in Asia has increased by 776 percent where trade with
the rest of the world is US$700 billion in 1986 and is US$6,135 billion
in 2006.The rise in external trade in Asia is partly contributed by the
improved trade performance of ASEAN and India.
With the accelerating process of globalization, volume of trade
has increased substantially in the three regions. This is particularly
true for Asia and the EU. From Fig. 2, it can seen that volume of trade
has increased drastically after 1985.

1.2. Accumulation of Foreign Reserves
Total reserve by Asia has increased drastically from US$91 billion in
1986 to US$2,717 billion in 2006 which is approximately a 2,885 per-
cent increase (as shown in Table 3).

The painful experience during the Asian Financial Crisis has led to
an interesting observation of a greater rate of reserve accumulation.
Since 1997,Asia has decided that it does not want to be depend-
ent on the West or global financial institutions, in particular the
IMF, when trouble hits again in future. Countries in the region clearly
realize that international institutions on which they were previously
dependent on are no longer reliable. Figure 3 shows that the total
reserve in Asia has increased drastically after the region regained its
economic strengths.

2. REPRESENTATION AT WORLD INSTITUTIONS
As the region regains more economic strength,it gives rise to two dis-
tinct but not unrelated directions to the policymakers in the region.
First,Asia should take on greater responsibilities commensurate with
its growing economic weight.This suggests that Asia should have a
larger role in international financial institutions and groupings such as
the IMF and the World Bank.Second,in the event of its failure to nego-
tiate for greater responsibilities at the international institutions, Asia
should request for institutions of its own so that the countries have a
central control of its own destiny.
As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1, since Asia (1) accounts for a
large proportion of global gross domestic product measured in terms
of purchasing power parity, (2) has the majority of global reserve,
along with the fact that (3) the region has the majority of the world’s
population, the countries in the region deserve the right to ask for
adequate representation in both the IMF and the World Bank. Table 4
serves to illustrate the imbalance between Asia’s output and its repre-
sentation in the IMF.

voting power in the IMF of the three major economic blocks in the

world. In terms of GDP (purchasing power parity),Asia contributed
46.47% among the three regions. However, the representation of
Asia in the IMF is almost only half of its share in output.The imbal-
ance of staff members is even more severe when it comes to the
higher positions.
Thus, an increase in representation should come in the form of
larger number of staff and key positions as well as the voting power.
Even though the G20 of the world’s leading rich and developing
countries has called for reform in the international institutions, there
may be of little success, as the failure is reflective of the fact that Asia
holds limited voting power in these institutions themselves.
Countries from Asia need better representation at the international
institutions to call for possible governance reform,but this is impossi-
ble without governance reform at the first place.
3. A NEW WORLD ARRANGEMENT —
A TRIPARTITE WORLD
The most striking change in both the world trading and world finan-
cial systems is the emergence of three-block-configuration which can
be clearly distinguished into the US, Europe and Asia by the ten mem-
bers of the ASEAN,China, Japan,South Korea,and soon with India.

The formation of Asia as a new regional block is supported by five
basic reasons. First, the experience of the Asian Financial Crisis in
1997 to 1998 suggests that crisis in one country has repercussion
effects on other countries in the region.The all-too-evident neighbor-
hood contagion effects give creditor countries strong interest in pool-
ing resources with others to avoid further destruction. Second, the
failures of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) to proceed on trade liberalization lead
to the idea of separate arrangement within Asia. Third, Asia is inspired
by the success of the European integration especially the Euro.Forth,
countries in Asia, in general, are broadly disquieted with the behavior
of both the US and the EU. Finally, the difficulties encountered in the
negotiation of greater representation at the IMF and the World Bank.
However, with or without larger role in the global institutions,
countries in Asia must be determined to devise effective fiscal, mone-
tary and exchange rate policies and accelerate structural adjustments
in order to ensure that the region is less vulnerable to any form of
financial crisis in the future.
3.1. Asian Monetary Fund
IMF and the G7 group of industrialized countries always recognize
themselves of playing key role in the international financial architec-
ture. However, the frustration and disappointment towards the
response of the IMF and the US in the Asian Financial Crisis of
1997–1998 is the single greatest catalyst for the proposal of an Asian
Monetary Fund (AMF).The AMF was first proposed in August 1997 to
deal with the crisis in the region where it managed to secure pledges
of US$100 billion from China, Hong Kong,Taiwan and Singapore.The
AMF, if successfully formed, will build on Asia’s savings surplus, for-
eign exchange reserves, and net creditor status (including reserves
and Treasury bills). This will allow the Asian countries to refinance
their loans and provide new loans for recovery programs.It may be of
the incentive of the Asian countries to assist other countries in the
region when they are hit by a financial crisis as the high degree of
Asia’s Role in the Global Economy and the International Financial System
149

economic interdependence within Asia suggests that crisis that hit
one country hurts the other countries too. This may give creditor
country a strong interest to pool resources together to prevent the
contagion effect.
However, there are obstacles and challenges ahead of Asia to
materialize the idea of setting up the AMF. These obstacles can be
both internal and external.
3.2. Exchange Rate: Fix or Float
In 2000, Lawrence Summers listed 7 somewhat common features
of crisis episodes for 7 countries which were badly hurt by financial
crisis.These countries include Mexico,Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Korea, Russia and Brazil. These subjective assessments suggest that
pegged exchange rates contributed very seriously to the vulnerability
of countries to financial crisis.
Fixed exchange rates are by definition central to financial crisis.
In 1997, the IMF advised Asian countries to float their currencies. In
1998, it lent to Russia and Brazil so that they could maintain the
value of their currencies. It praised Hong Kong for its strict currency
board system and distinguished Singapore for its managed float sys-
tem. The advices seem to be highly inconsistent. Historical experi-
ence provides strong evidence that unless countries can control
international capital flows, they will not find it possible to stabilize
exchange rates between their currencies and simultaneously retain
autonomy to utilize their monetary policies to achieve domestic eco-
nomic growth.This fundamental theorem explains why financial cri-
sis have to become so powerful under the existing international
monetary system.
Traditionally, merit is often attributed to flexible exchange rate
regimes over fixed exchange rate regimes in their ability to insulate
the economy more effectively against real shocks. The presence of
price stickiness explains why the exchange rate may matter.When an
economy is hit by real shocks, the economy that can then change rel-
ative prices more quickly will have smaller and smoother adjustment
150
Chia Wai-Mun, Zhang Yang and Yang Bo

in output.This is particularly true in an economy with price stickiness
where the speed at which relative prices can adjust, depends cru-
cially on the exchange rate regime. Under flexible exchange rate
regimes, relative prices can adjust instantly through changes in nomi-
nal exchange rate, while under fixed exchange rate regimes, relative
prices can adjust only at the speed that is permitted by price sticki-
ness, which is usually much slower.Therefore, flexible exchange rate
regimes allow smoother adjustment in output and quicker adjust-
ment in relative prices than fixed exchange rate regimes.
However, flexible exchange rate regimes do have a major draw-
back i.e., the risk of high volatility.They can overshoot and become
highly unstable particularly with large size of international capital
flow in and out of the country.This instability has real economic costs
as it reduces investors’ confidence in one currency and making the
task of combating inflation a lot harder.Which is preferred? Most aca-
demics find it hard to come to a common consensus. They rarely
agree on the best solution.However,in general,they believe that only
radical solutions will work i.e., either currency must be left com-
pletely free or must be tightly fixed.
With the success of Singapore in managing its exchange rate, a
managed float is recommended with the ability of monetary authori-
ties to adjust its currency when necessary.The monetary authorities
may choose to set an exchange rate according to a basket of foreign
currency based on its trade volumes with the foreign countries.This
exchange rate will be allowed to vary within a targeted band.When
the exchange rate reaches the upper or lower band, the monetary
authorities will intervene. However, there is a key challenge associ-
ated with such policy as a continuous re-evaluation mechanism on
the actual exchange rate must be established. This actual exchange
rate must be determined based on real factors such as volumes of
export and imports and perhaps foreign direct investment.
In additional to the suggestion of managed float regime, Asian
countries may choose to discourage and restrict short-term capital
inflow to minimize currency volatility. Large inflows of capital in Asia
help the region in their economic development.This is particularly
Asia’s Role in the Global Economy and the International Financial System
151

true if these flows are foreign direct investment. In any other cases, a
flow of short-term capital into any economy with immature and
poorly regulated financial institutions can be disastrously harmful.
Therefore, the best idea to the Asian economies is to impose their
own supervisory controls on short-term international borrowing by
domestic financial institutions.To prevent massive capital reversals, it
is best to prevent financial institutions from exposing themselves to
excess short-term indebtedness.
3.3. Capital Control vs. Capital Liberalization
Bitter experiences for many Asian countries during the Asian
Financial Crisis, direct governments in the region to learn a meaning-
ful lesson. Large inflows of foreign capital present them with irre-
sistible opportunity to accelerate their economic development.When
these inflows of foreign capital are for long-term direct investment,
they are beneficial. For instance, foreign direct investment in new
productive assets of a country will bring economic benefits such as
growth and employment. However, in any other cases, heavy inflows
of short-term financial capital into an economy without matured and
properly regulated financial institutions can do more harm than good.
With this argument in mind, should capital be controlled?
Generally, any controls, from a free market economics perspective,
will be oppressive to citizens and economically harmful.Additionally,
measures to block capital outflows, will deter future inflows of all
kinds including good capital inflows.Therefore, measures to control
capital will perhaps serve only as an option at time of crisis and coun-
tries that use capital control in the event of crisis have to trade-off its
short-term benefits of preventing capital outflows from the costs of
future credibility.
3.4. Common Currency
A common currency in Asia is an attractive idea in many years, espe-
cially after the success of Euros.According to optimum currency area
theory developed by Mundell Mckinnon and Kenen,to determine the
152
Chia Wai-Mun, Zhang Yang and Yang Bo

appropriateness of a group of countries in forming optimum cur-
rency area, a number of criteria have to be satisfied. These criteria
include (1) degree of similarity in business cycles and shocks,
(2) degree of openness, (3) degree of factor mobility internationally,
and (4) degree of product differentiation.This idea though attractive,
seems implausible for Asia at the current period not only because of
the difficulties in meeting such theoretical requirements but also its
practical economic and political obstacles as discussed in the follow-
ing section.
4. OBSTACLES AND CHALLENGES AHEAD
When Asia is moving towards a more integrated regional block, there
are challenges and obstacles ahead.First,the countries within Asia are
significantly different in terms of cultures,political systems and levels
of economic development. Second, most of these countries even
though are institutionally linked through ASEAN (one way or another)
for more than 30 years continue to perceive each other as competi-
tors rather than partners. Even though, as identified,Asia may benefit
significantly from regional currency stability, national sentiments and
mutual suspicion, especially between China and Japan, may rule out
the possibility of setting up either the Asian Monetary Fund (AMF) or
any form of regional unions.Third, obstacles and pressures may arise
from the West for Asia going its own way. For instance, when the AMF
was first proposed in 1997 with the objective of dealing with the
financial crisis in Asia, the US killed the proposal and it died.
According to their explanation, the IMF should be the only coordina-
tor of the rescue effort.
5. CONCLUSIONS
The world is getting more closely connected but yet divided. This
may appear contradicting but not without its justification.Advances
in communication and transportation have provided a major driving
force of international economic integration. From this perspective,
the world is getting more closely connected. Countries trade more in
Asia’s Role in the Global Economy and the International Financial System
153

terms of goods and capital. Volumes of import and export of goods
and services, and capital flows, have increased drastically in the past
few decades.The consequences of such economic integration are vis-
ible. Consumers benefit from lower-price goods. Producers benefit
from the spread of technological and marketing know-how. While
enjoying the fruits of globalization, many countries are getting
together to make their own economic arrangements.In both the trad-
ing and financial systems,the world is becoming a three-block config-
uration which comprises of the US,the EU and Asia.
Many Asian governments are interested to request for greater
responsibilities in international institutions commensurate with the
rising economic weight of Asia in the world economy. As Asia
accounts for a larger global GDP, a larger global reserve and a larger
population, the region serves the right to ask for sufficient repre-
sentation at the global institutions or else they may be losing their
significance. However, such request requires a call for governance
reforms at these institutions which may be of little success. This is
because Asia needs better representation at the international institu-
tions to call for possible governance reform but this is impossible
without governance reform at the first place. In this chapter we sug-
gest that in the event of failure in solving such a “chicken and egg”
problem, countries from Asia may like to choose another alternative
of forming their own new regional block so that they could be the
masters of their own fate.
Additionally, since an attempt to turn back the clock of globaliza-
tion can be disturbing and damaging,a sounder basis for globalization
is of urgent need.The key issue is perhaps for the IMF and the World
Bank to be aware of their role as development and financial plumbers
to connect not only Asia, but Russia,Africa and Latin America back to
the world economy. The key issue is then to help devise effective
ways for national policy makers and international agencies to address
the problems and challenges associated with further economic inte-
gration,from both international trade and international finance.

Globalization, Income Polarization
and the Rise of the “New Challengers”
Shubhasree Seshanna
Globalization, the progressive integration of the world economy, has
reached unprecedented levels, surpassing the peak levels attained
before the First World War. It is a very complex and multi-faceted
process, and is affecting the economic well-being of people around
the world. Globalization has happened before; starting around 1870,
trade, migration and capital flows reached unprecedented levels
(until now), driven mainly by declining transportation costs.While, at
the time, it seemed that globalization was inevitable, it was the first
wave that was followed by a retreat into nationalism and protection-
ism, two World Wars and the Great Depression. Only after 1945 did
we see a return to patterns similar to those of the first wave.This inte-
gration was mainly confined to the rich economies of the world. The
third (current) wave of globalization started around 1980 marked an
important change — many developing economies,“the new globaliz-
ers” broke into world markets for manufactures rather than primary
commodities.
155

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LATEST WAVE
OF GLOBALIZATION
Some important distinctive characteristics of this new wave of global-
ization include, first, the emergence of a large group of developing
countries as global producers of non-primary products and services
(sometimes called “globalization from below”). The populations of
these countries number around 3 billion, according to the World
Bank.By taking advantage of their labor abundance,and supported by
reasonably good policies, infrastructure and institutions, these coun-
tries, by and large, have seen large reductions in poverty and high
rates of growth.
The second feature of this new wave of globalization is that,coun-
tries with a population of around 2 billion, have not integrated into
the global economy. They include several countries in Africa and the
former Soviet Union. Professor Paul Collier, of Oxford University,
draws attention in his new book, to the fact that nearly a billion peo-
ple are still trapped in the depths of poverty (Sachs, 2006; Collier,
2007). Most of what he dubs the “bottom billion” lives in 58 coun-
tries,70% of them in Africa and most of the rest in Central Asia.1 Since
the 1990s, around 4 billion poor people worldwide have started to
move out of absolute poverty, some of them very rapidly and most
spectacularly in East Asia (Alesina,1991;Barro,1991,1992).
The current wave of globalization appears inevitable, desirable
and also frightening. Kofi Annan, former head of the United Nations,
expresses a sense of inevitability,“… arguing against globalization is
like arguing against the laws of gravity”. In a similar vein, former US
President Bill Clinton calls globalization “… the economic equivalent
of a force of nature — like wind or water”. A lot of the debate on the
benefits of globalization centers on the impact of globalization, the
distributional of income (Lindert, 2001; Mankiw, 1992; Persson, 1994;
Seshanna, 2003; Stiglitz, 2007). Economist, Paul Samuelson cautions,
156

1 Dr.Collier explains,“in one or more of four traps — wars,in which 73% of the poor-
est have been caught at one time or another; natural resources gone wrong (Nigeria
and its oil), which accounts for about 30%; landlocked with bad neighbors (Chad);
and the bad-governance-in-a-small-country trap (too many to name)”.

“Globalization presumes sustained economic growth. Otherwise, the
process loses its economic benefits and political support”. Skeptical
about its distributional impact, former US President, Jimmy Carter,
points out that “if you’re totally illiterate and living on one dollar a
day,the benefits of globalization never come to you”.
Many studies agree that for the successful globalizers, overall
incomes have risen (Dollar and Kray, 2001b). World incomes have
risen on average as well. Some assert that world income inequality is
rising, as inequality within countries. World income inequality
depends on both between-country and within-country inequality.
The evidence on the trends in within-country inequality has been
mixed. At the household level,studies such as Ravallion (2001) show
that growth benefits the poor, but the resulting decrease in inequal-
ity can vary greatly across countries. In one paper, Dollar and Kraay
(2001a, 2001b) find that trade liberalization (increased volumes and
lowered tariffs) leads to economic growth which itself benefits the
poor by lowering absolute poverty; but there seems to be no effect
on inter-country inequality. In other words, growth benefits the poor
as much as it benefits the average household. In another paper,
O’Rourke (2001) finds that, even if historically between-countries
inequality increased for the past 200 years, the trend may turn
around soon.
This chapter focuses solely on between-country comparisons. It
first examines the trend identified above, the unprecedented partici-
pation of developing economies in the world industrial economy,
with particular emphasis on the emergence of multinationals from
developing countries. Then it looks at the question of whether glob-
alization has increased the global income divide between the suc-
cessful globalizers and the unsuccessful ones. In the light of the
World Bank’s results, which show 3 billion people successfully inte-
grating into the world economy and 2 billion people being left out,
the concept that best captures the global divide between the two
groups is not just income inequality but income polarization.
Polarization,though related to inequality,is a distinct concept,denot-
ing a particular type of change in the income distribution — a move-
ment of the observations from the middle of the distribution

157

towards the two tails or a “hollowing of the middle” of the distribu-
tion, or associated with a “tendency towards bimodality” (Foster,
1992;Wolfson, 1994; Quah, 1996).The Wolfson index of polarization
is used in this analysis.2 Wolfson (1994, 1997) points out that stan-
dard inequality measures may not distinguish the increased polariza-
tion of a distribution from other kinds of changes in the distribution
(say a lengthening of the lower tail). He also shows that sometimes
the two measures may disagree. In the context of inter-country
income distribution, polarization would mean a greater concentra-
tion of the low-income and high-income countries, at the expense of
those in the middle.This chapter, therefore, looks not only at trends
in inter-country inequality but also inter-country polarization.
THE RISE OF THE “NEW CHALLENGERS”
We are witnessing what amounts to a revolution in the way world
production is undertaken. Companies from developing countries
such as China, India, Brazil, Russia Mexico and Turkey are expanding
rapidly overseas and going global. The world has woken up to the
arrival of these emerging market multinationals. Thanks to some
huge deals that attracted media attention. These cases include expa-
triate Indian business Mittal’s bid for the European steelmaker
Arcelor, the battle between two Indian firms, Tata and Mahindra and
Mahindra over Jaguar, China’s Lenovo’s purchase of IBM’s PC busi-
ness, and Tata’s battle with Brazil’s CSN for Corus, an Anglo-Dutch
steel maker. The well-known Indian trio of Wipro, Infosys and Tata
Consultancy Services (TCS) has built an IT outsourcing industry that
is challenging industry leaders such as Accenture and IBM. China’s
BYD Company is now the world’s largest producer of nickel-cad-
mium batteries, and China’s home appliance makers Haier and
Hisense are very big in Europe, Cemex from Mexico is one of the

the difference between 50 percent and the income share of the bottom half of the
population (which latter, is referred to as the “median share”), and mtan = median/
mean.See Wolfson (1994),for details.

world’s largest producers of cement,Brazil’s Embraer has become the
market leader in regional jets, overtaking Canada’s Bombardier,
China’s Chery Automobile, the leading car exporter plans to build
plants in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and South America and
India’s Bharat Forge is now the world’s second-largest forging com-
pany. While these prominent examples get all the attention, several
thousand such companies are actively trying to expand abroad.
A 2006 study by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), found 100
companies from emerging markets with total assets of US$520 billion
that year.3 By 2004, the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) had noted that five companies from emerg-
ing Asia had made it into the world’s biggest multinational companies
(MNCs) and ten made it into the top 200.4 Furthermore, Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI) from developing countries (including merg-
ers and acquisitions) in 2006 was US$174 billion (14% of the world’s
total). Now we are seeing a new and fundamental shift, investment is
increasingly flowing from South to North and from South to South as
these new MNCs invest in both the rich and the developing world.The
BRICs (a term coined by Goldman Sachs in 2003 to denote the largest
globalizing countries, Brazil, Russia, India and China) in particular, fea-
ture predominantly in the list of the top 100 multinationals from the
developing world (see Fig.1).
According to BCG, thousands of such companies are expanding
sales and production internationally. They are not simply exporters
but are setting up plants in many countries of the world.They have
certain advantages in their home markets, such as rapid economic
growth, low costs, and cheap state finance. Moreover, managers have
learned to be adaptable and resilient in an environment full of diffi-
culties in operation.The gradual liberalization of these countries has
exposed these firms to competition from global incumbents form
rich countries.

likes of IBM and General Motors, and noted in the 1980s that the United States was
worried about the inroads Japanese firms were making into America.

The BCG study also finds that of the 100 top companies5 from
what they call “Rapidly Developing Countries”(RDE), that are on “the
leading edge of globalizing their businesses”, 70 are from Asia
(44 Chinese and 21 Indian), 18 from Latin America (12 from Brazil,
6 from Mexico) and another 12 from Egypt,Russia and Turkey.Most of
the Chinese companies are state-controlled/owned, only one Indian
company is.The “RDE 100” produce industrial goods (32), consumer
durables (18), resource extraction (15), food-and-beverage and cos-
metics (11), technology equipment (6) and others such as pharma-
ceuticals, mobile-communications, shipping and infrastructure (18).
Table 1 presents the top ten companies and Table 2 presents selected
companies that make it to the top 100.
Five strategies used by these companies were identified by BCG.
The first is taking brands form local to global. A good example is
China’s Hisense, a consumer-electronics group, with a 10% market
share at home,has manufacturing plants in several countries and sells
television sets and air-conditioners in over 40 countries. Another
example is India’s Bajaj Auto, exports three- and two-wheelers, mostly
to South-East Asia.
A second strategy is turning local engineering talent into global
innovation, as Embraer of Brazil has done. Combining low-cost

manufacturing with advanced R&D,it is now world leader in regional
jets,with 95% of its sales outside Brazil.
A third method used by these companies is striving for global
leadership in a narrow product category. China’s BYD Company, the
battery-maker, and Hong Kong’s Johnson Electric, electric motor
maker,have followed this route.
The fourth strategy used by Brazil’s Sadia and Perdigão (pork and
poultry producers), for e.g., is to take advantage of natural resources
in the home country,along with excellent marketing and distribution.
The fifth and final strategy is to have a new or better business
model, which is then rolled out in many different markets.This is the
approach used by Mexico’s cement producer, Cemex, now the
world’s biggest supplier of ready-mix concrete.
These “new challengers”do have some advantages; they are often
family-owned or family-controlled, which help them decide quickly,
and they get cheap finance from state banks. But they also face many
problems,trying to break into a world economy that is already global-
ized and dominated by some powerful incumbents. This has not
deterred many of them from taking advantage of opportunities pre-
sented to them by globalization.
It is interesting to note that the large East Asian economies
of Malaysia, Indonesia,Thailand and the Philippines are not as well-
represented in the BCG 100 as one would expect (there is no global
name similar to Korea’s LG,for example),despite a good recovery from
the 1997 financial crisis, several years of strong growth and improved
government finances. Singapore is an exception and the region’s most
advanced economy.Singapore Airlines is the region’s most recognizable
brand, and also the fourth largest international carrier. Keppel and
SembCorp are the world’s two largest producers of offshore oil drilling-
rigs.Some of Singapore’s tech firms like Chartered Semiconductors and
Creative are facing strong competition from Taiwan. The region has
produced some important banks, Singapore’s OCBC and Malaysia’s
Public Bank, which are also expanding beyond their borders. But here
again, they have to contend with Western and Chinese banks.Also of
some concern is that unlike Korea’s and Taiwan’s export-led growth,

which came from home-grown firms making globally competitive
products, South-East Asian firms depend a lot on high-value exports
made by foreign companies.This makes them vulnerable to the risk
that the company will move to a lower cost destination.
WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE INCUMBENT
FIRMS OF THE RISE OF THE “CHALLENGERS”? 
The competition the incumbents are facing and will continue to face
will raise the stakes of the game.They will have to identify and learn
about the challenger firms, and be aware of the new reality of the
environment they are operating in. They may choose to compete
head-on with the competitors,or cooperate with them and form part-
nerships and other ties.The number of emerging market companies,
though dominated by the two largest economies, China and India at
the moment,is likely to keep increasing. Any global company must be
prepared to be a major player not only in the rich economies of the
world,but also in the rapidly developing world.
Labor productivity in India and China is growing faster than in
South-East Asia (IMF, 2007). Firms in South-East Asia must offer more
than low wage-costs and they must produce better-qualified workers
and innovate more to stay ahead.There are some good performers,
Malaysia’s YTL conglomerate,Genting and Air Asia,Singapore’s Banyan
Tree, and Thailand’s Bumrungrad hospitals (for “medical tourism”).
While the rise of China and India may make it difficult to become
large manufacturers, still there are possibilities of producing world-
class firms in other areas, such as tourism and hospitality and natural
resources (palm oil for Malaysia and Indonesia, rice for Vietnam and
Thailand,fish and seafood for Vietnam and Thailand).

years 1950–2004.
polarization (using the Wolfson measure) and inequality (using the
Gini coefficient). A range of measures of openness is used to identify
the “globalizers” (or more globalized economies), including member-
ship in the World Trade Organization,tariff rates,and the ratio of trade
to GDP. The list of post-1980 globalizers includes some well-known
reformers such as Argentina, China, Hungary, India, Malaysia, Mexico,
the Philippines and Thailand, and well over half the population of the
developing world (see Table 3).The “globalizers” are not drawn from
the richer developing economies. In fact, in 1980, they were as a
group, poorer than average (they include India and China, massive
and poor).Many of the recent globalizers have experienced increased
growth rates from the 1970s onwards, while the “non-globalizing”
developing countries saw a decline in the average growth rate from
the 1970s to the 1980s, and then recovering slightly in the 1990s
(Dollar and Kraay,2001a;World Bank,2007).
The key variable used is PPP-adjusted real GDP per capita in order
to correct for inflation,population size and exchange rates.Note that,
to compare one country with another, it is necessary to express the
real GDP per capita in a common currency (USD);but exchange rates
can create distortions in common prices as well.To prevent such a
distortion,the purchasing power parity (PPP) approach is preferred.
The USD PPP adjusted real GDP per capita values came from a core
dataset called the Penn World Table (Mark 6.2) denoted PWT 6.2,cover-
ing the years from 1980 to 2004 (Heston,1991,2006).6 Countries were
then divided into five groups, “globalizers”, “non-globalizers”, the
“world”,“East Asia (including China)”and East Asia (excluding China)”.
As mentioned earlier, the list of post-1980 globalizers includes well
over half of the population of the developing world. East Asia is of
particular interest, since until about ten years ago, it was the world’s
fastest-growing region (see Fig. 1 below). For each of these groups
three variables are graphed over time. They are mean real GDP per
capita,the Gini coefficient and the Wolfson polarization measure.

Note: The above table lists the countries that qualify as post-1980 globalizers in terms of
increased trade volumes and tariffs reductions (Dollar and Kraay,2001a).Non-globalizers are the
rest of the world (neither increased trade volumes nor tariffs reductions as for the globalizers
above),less the OECD countries.

As Fig.2 shows,real mean GDP per capita of the various groups of
countries has followed a fairly continuous and smooth upward trend
for all groups concerned, with a significant increase from 2002
onwards. East Asia (with and without the inclusion of China) has
remained above the world average throughout, and continues the
trend up to 2004. Both the “globalizers”and the “non-globalizers”have
real mean GDP per capita below the world average, but the trend is
the same for all groups. This is not surprising,as mentioned earlier,the
globalizers were not a high-income group of developing countries to
start with,in fact,they were poorer than average.
Looking at inequality trends, within-group Gini coefficients
are the highest and rising for the world and for the non-globalizers

(see Fig. 3).This makes intuitive sense since all countries are pooled
into one group (the world) without any exclusion, thus creating the
most heterogeneous group of countries.The Gini coefficient shows a
slow decline from 1980–1989, followed by a rise until 2003, after
which it dips significantly for all groups. Unfortunately, the dataset
ends in 2004, or else, it would have been possible to see if this trend
continues further.It is in partial agreement with O’Rourke (2001), who
also found an increasing between-country world inequality using the
Theil index (Bourguignon and Morrisson, 1999). According to the
graph, the globalizers have the lowest within-group Gini, followed by
East Asia,and then the “world”and the non-globalizers. The globalizer
group is significantly less unequal than the world and the non-global-
izing group. East Asian Gini coefficients are consistently below the
world average. This would suggest that globalizers and East Asian
countries are becoming more equal among themselves within their
group. The sharp reduction in inequality in 2003–2004, is in agree-
ment with the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (2007) which finds
that “trade globalization is not found to have a negative impact on
income distribution”in either developed or developing countries.
In the case of polarization, we see some interesting patterns.
(Fig. 4) East Asia (including China) is the most polarized group, fol-
lowed by East Asia (excluding China),the “world”,the “non-globalizers”

and finally, the “globalizers”.The OECD is the only group to show a
declining trend in intra-group polarization. In fact, the two East Asian
groups are not only more polarized than average, but the level of
polarization increases from the late 1980s to the about 2003, after
which it drops sharply. The “globalizers” show not only the lowest
levels of intra-group polarization,but also a more or less steady declin-
ing trend, even in the 1990s. The “non-globalizers” are less polarized
than the world or the East Asian groups and also follow a somewhat
declining trend.The East Asian groups and the “world” did becoming
more polarized especially in the 1990s, but in 2003 onwards the
trend appears to reverse itself. This is consistent with more pes-
simistic studies that worried about a widening economic divide
(Stiglitz, 2003), and appears to contradict the optimists who believe
the world playing field was getting more equal with time (Friedman,
2005; Bhagwati, 2004). Since polarization appears to reduce after
2003,more time and more data are needed to confirm if the optimists
were right after all.
CONCLUSION
The rise of the new challengers from booming domestic markets
in developing countries is going to continue. By 2050, China and

India are predicted to be two of the world’s three largest
economies (BCG, 2006).They are already making the largest contri-
butions in PPP terms to world growth (IMF, 2008). Global compa-
nies will become major players not only in North America, Europe
and Japan, but also in India, China and other fast-growing
economies. South-East Asian firms will have to work harder at inno-
vating and producing better-educated workers to compete in this
new environment.
Gini index starts declining between 1980 (the beginning of “glob-
alization”for many) and 1990, after which it follows an upward trend
until 2003, when it decreases again. The polarization index, which
shows a steady upward trend most of the time, also decreases in
2003–2004.The world was indeed becoming more polarized during
the 1980s and 1990s as many believed.However this trend appears to
be reversing from 2003 onwards.The “middle” of the distribution is
getting “fatter”, or more countries are moving closer to the middle of
the distribution.
Globalization is creating winners and losers everywhere.Those
with the skills and the resources to make use of the opportunities
afforded by trade, transnational corporations,Asia (generally speak-
ing), BRICs, some other “emerging economies” (around 24 coun-
tries containing 3 billion people) are better off. Those without
resources or skills needed (even in East Asia and in the rich world),
some Sub-Saharan African countries (though some are growing
faster), some ex-Soviet states (in all nearly 2 billion), national gov-
ernments, the environment and (some) workers in the rich world,
are marginalized. Furthermore, migration pressures are building
(since the movement of labor is not as free as it was during the first
wave of globalization), and more South-North as well as South-
South will rise.
There is chance of a rich-country backlash against globalization.
Some people in rich countries do lose out from the combination of
trade and technology. Many argue (including the IMF) that trade is a
much smaller factor than technology. The remedy lies with education
and training, and with help in changing jobs — not in efforts to hold
back either technological progress or trade.

Economics and Health
David Reisman
Everyone wants good health. There is no disagreement about that.
Good health is consumption; people feel satisfied when they can
climb stairs unaided and do not suffer polio because they have had
the vaccine.Good health is investment;a student dreads a cold on the
morning of an exam and a taxi driver loses business when he is laid
up with emphysema. Good health is an end. Good health is a means.
Good health is something that all people want.
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines good health as
“a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not
merely the absence of disease”.The road to the padded cell is paved
with uncompromising completeness like this. It is healthy to have a
little of what you fancy even if what makes you happy is fatty char
kway teow (a local Singaporean dish). It is healthy to feel a bit low
when you learn that you have been passed over for promotion again.
It is healthy to feel exploited if the truth is that the boss is pushing
too hard for his top-dollar bottom line.Too much completeness is bad
for your health.Yet the WHO is on the right track.We all want to be
free of crippling disease. We all want to live without unmanageable
anxiety. We all want to turn up for work often enough to get our

bonuses and our commissions. The philosophers try to put a name to
the intuition.The rest of us simply sense that we know what good
health is.We know what it is.We know that we like it.We know that
we would like to have even more.
The doctor has sworn a Hippocratic oath to help a named,unique
sick person without counting the cost.Yet the cost is there and the
resources are scarce. It is the sad but necessary task of the economist
to remind the community that there will never be enough to go
round. One person’s kidney transplant is another person’s wonder-
drug foregone. A budget plunged into hospitals is the same budget
not ploughed into schools. Choices must be made. Economics makes
a socially-useful contribution to the debate about health outcomes
and medical inputs precisely because it helps the community to max-
imize the quantum of good health that can be squeezed from a given
endowment that will never be enough.
Economics must rank the treatments and the options in terms of
three criteria: (1) effectiveness: there is no point in backing a proce-
dure if it does not restore the patient’s function or if a do-nothing
basepoint would, medically speaking, perform just as well. (2) effi-
ciency: costs must be compared with benefits, private and social
returns computed, an outside discounting-rate brought in, to estab-
lish if research on the cervix has as high an economic payoff as
research on the prostate. (3) equity: the social value of fairness sug-
gests that all citizens and residents should have equal access (assum-
ing a reasonable capacity to benefit) to a basic package of
decent-quality medical services. All health care redistributes. The
sick consume more than the well. The old consume more than
the young. Equity as an objective means that the State on behalf of
the community shifts resources from the effective demand of the
prosperous to the unmet needs of the distressed, the impoverished
and the left-behind.
Economics makes a useful contribution where it helps the com-
munity to make rational choices and to assign non-random priorities.
It also helps the community to understand the social function of pric-
ing as a deterrent to over-consumption and a way of containing total
cost.Fees and thresholds,forcing even clients with insurance to cover

a part of the burden out of pocket or out of savings,make consumers
think carefully about the extra anticipated improvement relative to
the marginal payment that guards the gate. The downward-sloping
demand curve is a people-centered relationship which gives ordinary
individuals the freedom to quantify their subjective perceptions by
indicating when they have had enough.
Cost-shares in an insured service, like free market prices in the
supplying and demanding of wheat, at least empower the consumers
to reveal their preferences through the pecuniary sacrifice that they
make to satisfy each of their disparate wants. Payments also pick up
both the price-elasticity and the income-elasticity of demand.
Consumers move to the right along a demand curve when the price
of a necessary but not an essential intervention drops. The whole
demand curve shifts outwards to the right when rising incomes bring
discretionary procedures within the choice set, when the price of a
substitute (drugs versus surgeons) goes up, when the price of a com-
plement (doctors matched up with beds) goes down.
The demand curve is pure psychology. The desire for care is a
derived demand. It shadows the desire for a good health status that
the payment is expected to bring into being. Patients cannot always
put into words just how much they are willing to sacrifice. While
questionnaires and surveys undoubtedly elicit valuable hypothetical
information, data collected from a real-world demand curve is the
best window the policy-maker will usually have into the contents of
the invisible mind.
Rational people make rational choices. They proportion the
extra benefit to the extra cost for all the consumables from which
they wish to select a utility-maximizing portfolio mix.The equilib-
rium in that way becomes general and not merely partial.Yet there
is a problem. In the market for apples, the shoppers have acquired
knowledge through past purchases and the university of experi-
ence. In the market for disease and malfunction they are normally in
the dark. Economics uses the concept of the agency relationship to
model the contract between the ill-informed patient and the well-
trained professional to whom he turns for diagnosis, advice and
treatment.

The professional has an ethic of selfless service. He is a member
of a professional body which stigmatises any abuse of information
asymmetry.The professional is also, on the other hand, an economic
human being who can be desperate for money to send his children to
university or to buy his mother a retirement home of her own.
Supplier-induced demand is the waste of resources that can so easily
be the result where the professional demands marginal tests and
unnecessary surgery exclusively because economics teaches that
financial incentives produce the most economical use of scarce
resources.
Incentives can be perverse where the doctor is paid a fee for his
service and the patient hasn’t a clue what he needs.Even so,the insti-
tutional structure can and does generate its own countervailing
power. The general practitioner is charged with referrals to a surgeon
who cannot therefore have things his own way. Besides that, the
delivery of healthcare is often reimbursed by an insurance company
or fund.Third-party payment restricts and rations in line with second
opinions, preannounced criteria and prepublished scales. First-dollar
coverage does not mean that the entitlement is infinite. Health insur-
ance is in that sense the economist’s best friend.
Healthcare, unlike most economic consumables, is frequently cov-
ered by prepayment through health insurance. Here again, the econo-
mist is able to provide a logical explanation for a typical economic
phenomenon. From the perspective of the consumer, the reason is
uncertainty. Fearing an unexpected catastrophe that he hopes will
never occur, the risk-averter agrees to a small loss upfront in order to
protect himself against a far greater loss when the veil of ignorance is
finally lifted later on.From the insurer’s point of view the reason is risk.
The law of large numbers allows the speculator to make an informed
guess as to the probable claims that will be made and to set an appro-
priate premium in the light of his most likely drains.Allowance must be
made for the deadweight loading of marketing, administration and (for
a commercial insurer) profits. Insurance is an unusual market. Policy-
holders,as a group,always take out less than what they put in.
Different premiums mean different volumes of business. Where
oligopolists are struggling for market share, the logic of imperfect
178
David Reisman

competition suggests that each insurer will target the low-risk, low-
premium sector of the sales potential. Each will turn down known
diabetics and haemophiliacs because they have a chronic condition.
Each will specialize in services like paediatrics because a reputation
for babies will not pull in the loss-making old.As the pool becomes
larger, so the premiums will go up, it must happen as higher-risk con-
sumers admitted into the club.The danger is that the good risks will
react calculatively by dropping out altogether from the collective.
They will opt to self-insure through personal savings.They will not
want to be burdened with cross-subsidies for the smokers and the
drinkers through premiums that are actuarially unfair to sensible peo-
ple who always buckle their seat belt,eat two apples a day and go for
a therapeutic jog.
The phenomenon is known as adverse selection.Where the good
risks drop out and the bad risks cannot afford the higher premiums
that result, the danger is that private insurance might effectively
wither away. The alternative to nothing at all might have to be social
insurance and single-pooled statism.Membership would be universal;
to be a citizen is to be a paid-up part of the fund. Finance, from the
employer and the employee, could be topped up out of tax (not least
progressive income tax) as an expression of national solidarity. In
some cases (as in the British National Health Service) the social insur-
ance mechanism would be so closely entwined with the healthcare
delivery mechanism that the organization that pays is effectively the
organization that provides. Whatever the precise arrangements that
are selected, the core legitimation is economic pragmatism.The com-
mercial alternative fails to meet people’s reasonable expectations.
Market failure means that there is no insurer other than the State that
can be trusted to take on the job.
The task of risk-rating the premiums is made more complicated
by virtue of moral hazard. People who have bought insurance have
less of an incentive to substitute prevention for cure. The contingen-
cies being pooled, the calculative consumer has more of an incentive
to play the free rider on the good health of others than he did before
the insurance itself altered his risk profile for the worse.The insurer
must not only predict the risk at entry but must predict the changes
Economics and Health
179

in the risk that the policy itself will gender. Insurers (aware as they
must be of economic self-interest and the incentive to conceal the
truth) can ask for information about pre-existent complaints, family
history and life style. What no medical examination or DNA sample
can ever pick up is, however, what the individual will be like in the
future once prepaid access to doctoring has removed his economic
incentive to look both ways before crossing the road or to check the
date-stamp carefully before purchasing a fowl.
Economics is about allocative efficiency. It is also about innova-
tion and change.Optimality can be dynamic as well as static.Thus the
economist might recommend more medical schools and licensing
bodies in order to foster monopolistic competition in place of suffo-
cating monopoly that standardizes the hours and fixes the price.The
economist might look to entrepreneurship for experimentation and
novelty since it is competition that forces the incumbents and the
entrants to differentiate and discount. The economist might be in
favor of expensive scanners shared between several hospitals in order
to maximize the economies of throughput and scale.The economist
might be an advocate of replacement migration since capital must be
complemented by labor and the market for auxiliaries, cleaners,
nurses and doctors is often perilously tight.
And the economist must be in favor of the State. Regulations are
needed to protect the patient from charlatan butchers and untrialled
pharmaceuticals. Health education promotes nutritious pulses that
make an investment in long-lived health capital. Pigovian taxes make
cigarettes so costly that the impressionable young never catch the
addiction.Targeted subsidies mean that hospitals will be situated in
distant and underprivileged areas. Compulsory accounts like
Medisave in Singapore mean that citizens must build up hypothe-
cated balances against the chance of a future hospital bill.
Environmental policies mean that agricultural land will be less pol-
luted by pesticides and unleaded petrol will protect the lungs against
toxic fumes. A top-notch infrastructure of road and reservoirs will
keep the vegetables fresh and the drinking water clean. Good health
is more than the doctors and the hospitals. It is also the internaliza-
tion of the externalities that are a public good or a public bad for all.
180
David Reisman

Epidemics must be stemmed. Humanitarian values must be upheld.
The market has no economic interest in supplying spillovers, non-
excludable and non-rivalrous, which it cannot sell. Only the State can
see to it that there is as much and as good for all.
The coordination must be done on a one-world basis. Haze,AIDS,
contagious flu, contaminated beef, dangerous hallucinogens, the dis-
posal of nuclear waste, global warming caused by the endangered
ozone layer have consequences that extend beyond the national
boundaries.Good health is a regional and a world-wide concern.
Yet good interventionism like good health costs money. Since the
capacity to tax is not unlimited and since a budget deficit can cause
destabilizing inflation, what is clear is that there is a strong case for
growth. Rising productivity is rewarded with rising wages. Rising
wages make possible better housing and nutritious food, more saving
for a rainy day and buoyant sales taxes for the State to spend on
immunization campaigns that make the rate of growth even more
robust than before. Growth is not an unmixed blessing. Richer coun-
tries report more obesity and more stress.Yet growth is nonetheless
the sine qua non. People want good health. People want rising stan-
dards of living.The two objectives are symbiotic, two sides of a single
coin. Economy is in the enviable position of helping ordinary people
to have more not just of one but of two good things that they want.

Medical Decisions:
A Two Stage Decision Model
With Information Updating
John Lane and Sandro Tsang*
INTRODUCTION
For many years now there has been widespread concern about the
possible overuse of antibiotics in medical prescriptions. The World
Health Organization (1999) has stated that the implied increase in
antimicrobial resistance is a natural biological phenomenon ampli-
fied many-fold owing to human misuse and neglect. For example, in
the UK, there is a significant risk that a stay in hospital may lead the
patient to contract Clostridium Difficile or Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),a bacterium which is resistant to a large
group of antibiotics known as beta-lactarins (and which includes the
183
* We wish to pay tribute,and acknowledge our indebtedness,to the late Professor John
Henry (of St Mary’s Hospital in London and also Imperial College, London University)
with whom we had many fruitful discussions on this topic and related matters. Our
appreciation is also extended to Dr Xuelin Liu of the Asian Development Bank.

penicilins). For the latter condition, the overuse of antibiotics accen-
tuates risk by eliminating useful microbes hence making its eradica-
tion very difficult.
Past attempts to search for an explanation have not been success-
ful so we will consider only one such attempt,rather than providing a
complete review of the literature.Ellis and McGuire (1986) presented
a model in which the patient’s medical condition is known and the
patient is passive in that, he accepts as much treatment as the physi-
cian deems fit to supply. Basic economic principles tell us that the
actual supply should be such that the benefit to the patient derived
from the last unit of treatment is set equal to the incremental cost. In
the jargon of economists the supplied quantity is such that the mar-
ginal benefit and marginal cost of treatment are equated.These mar-
ginal costs are typically presumed to be constant in the sense that
they are independent of the quantity of treatment.On the other hand
marginal benefit surely decreases when supplied quantity increases
and, whilst one knows that for small treatment levels this marginal
benefit is positive, excessive treatment levels will provide a negative
marginal benefit (the treatment level for which the marginal benefit
is zero will be referred to as the satiation level).When your physician
prescribes antibiotics it is typically for a limited five day course of
treatment for just such a reason.
The implication of this analysis is now clear. If marginal costs are
positive then the supplied quantity will be less than the satiation level
i.e. the level of treatment that the patient would prefer. Therefore
there is an undersupply.This model can explain the overuse of antibi-
otics only if the treatment is sufficiently subsidized to ensure that the
marginal cost to the physician is negative.
The above issue however, whilst relevant, is not paramount.The
possible role of uncertainty in medical decision-making, first brought
to our attention in an economic context by the renowned economist
Arrow (1963),must be considered.
The malfeasance principle, the central tenet of “precautionary”
decision-making, precludes an action being taken if it may cause
unnecessary harm. However the physician has a duty to act even
when confronted with uncertainty in the costs and benefits of
184
John Lane and Sandro Tsang

treatment and also in the accuracy of the diagnosis. An evidence
based decision-making process requires the physician to consider all
the issues in making a balanced judgment, e.g. the likelihood of an
incorrect diagnosis, or “false positive”, can be reduced by increasing
the quality of medical care but the resulting benefit must be evalu-
ated relative to the increased costs.
This latter consideration is of increasing and extreme impor-
tance, now that the supply of new treatments is so dependent on
expensive advanced technology and long lead-times in research and
development.We have presumed in this discussion that the patient
is passive which implies that his/her costs are covered either by a
publicly funded National Health System, as in the UK, or by full-
cover private health insurance. However there are many new treat-
ments which are only on offer to the patient if treated privately
because the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, the
UK Government’s regulatory authority, has not approved its provi-
sion to the National Health Service.The decision is based on consid-
erations of cost effectiveness. To give one such example, chosen
from a long list, consider “wet age-related macular degeneration”.
This is a condition which causes blindness within three months if
not treated. It can be treated with the drugs Lucentis or Macugen
but this has only received a limited sanction for its provision by the
UK’s national Health System; one needs first to be blind in one eye
and not too blind in the other.
In this Chapter, we consider a generic model which applies to a
wide range of medical treatments;not solely that of antibiotic medica-
tion.We consider the effect of two sources of uncertainty in the deci-
sion-making process of a physician. In contrast to the Ellis and
McGuire paper,we no longer assume that the patient’s medical condi-
tion is known with certainty. The condition may be, for example,
a benign form of cancer or an aggressive form of cancer.These condi-
tions will be labeled X and Y respectively.
Alternatively one could be testing for the SARS virus (Y) against a
common form of influenza (X), for Dengue fever (Y) or the
Chikungunya virus,both of which are carried by the Aedes mosquito,
against Malaria (X). Condition Y is deemed to be more serious than
Medical Decisions
185

condition X in the sense that, for any given level of treatment,
e.g. radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy for cancer, the incremental
benefit to the patient is larger if he has condition Y rather than the
alternative condition X.This implies that the satiation level of treat-
ment for condition Y exceeds that of condition X.
The initial (or a priori) information available to the physician is
limited to the knowledge of the proportion of the population at large
that has condition Y. However, when first meeting a particular and
random patient drawn from this population, this information by itself
is not sufficient for the choice of an appropriate treatment. It is nec-
essary to perform a diagnostic test, the result of which could be the
prediction that the cancer is benign (diagnosis x) or aggressive (diag-
nosis y). Thus,diagnosis y is the prediction that the true medical con-
dition of the patient, equivalently the patient’s “type”, is Y; similarly x
predicts X. This information is then used to update the physician’s
initial or a priori estimates of the likelihood that the patient has con-
dition Y (alternatively X).These updated (or “posterior”) probabilities
are obtained in accordance with a well known theorem in statistics,
namely Bayes’ theorem, which will be discussed in Section 1 of this
Chapter.
The second source of uncertainty is that,very few diagnostic tests
are infallible. It is possible that a patient’s diagnostic result is y, even
though the true condition is X. This is referred to as a “false positive”.
For example, it has been estimated that 10% of mammogram tests for
breast cancer yield false positives; the unfortunate patient is treated
for this condition even though there is no problem.
The final consideration that we wish to introduce into our reason-
ing is to allow the physician to choose between a range of possible
diagnostic tests of different quality. Higher quality indicates that the
likelihood of a false positive, decreases. The posterior probabilities
referred to above will now be contingent on,or functions of,the cho-
sen quality level. This increase in quality will mean higher costs of
provision but also increased benefits to the patient.
Therefore, there are three decision variables and they must be
chosen to maximize a weighted average of the benefit to the patient
and the profits of the physician.The weights reflect the physician’s
186
John Lane and Sandro Tsang

degree of altruism towards the patient. Perfect altruism indicates the
absence of any financial concern. Also the benefit to the patient is sto-
chastic (uncertain).Therefore,in accordance with standard procedures
for decision making under uncertainty, it is taken to be a weighted
average of the benefit of treatment to the patient if he is type X and
also that if he is type Y. The weights are given by the physician’s
updated beliefs,after diagnosis,of the patient’s type.
The mathematical complexity of this decision process suggests
that one adopts a “two stage” optimization procedure. One first deter-
mines the diagnostic contingent treatment levels for any given level of
quality, or any given diagnostic test.These are called treatment func-
tions. After substitution of the treatment functions into the physician’s
objective function there will be only one variable,namely quality,over
which the maximization proceeds.The optimizing quality level is then
substituted into the treatment functions to determine the quantity of
medical services which should be provided. The first stage of this “two
stage”procedure is discussed in Section 2, the second stage in Section
3 and further results and conclusions are discussed in Section 4.
1. INFORMATION UPDATING
To comprehend how the physician’s prior beliefs should be modified
after knowing the result of the diagnostic test, i.e. to understand the
Bayesian updating procedure, consider the following example which
is based on realistic data. Let’s suppose that all women aged 40 (the
“population”) participate in routine screening for breast cancer and
1% of them have breast cancer. Then the prior probability of medical
condition Y is P(Y) = 0.01 and of the alternative condition (no breast
cancer) is P(X) = 0.99. It is known that 80% of women with breast
cancer will get positive (y) mammographies (the diagnostic test).
Thus, in an obvious notation, P(y/Y) is 0.80.Also the probability that
the diagnosis is positive even though the patient does not have breast
cancer is 9.6% so P(y/X) = 0.96 i.e. a “false positive”, a positive but
incorrect diagnosis.The question is: if a woman in this age group had
a positive mammography in routine screening what is the probability
that she actually has breast cancer?
Medical Decisions
187

Surveys have shown that an overwhelming majority of General
Practitioner doctors (commonly referred to as GP’s in the UK) will
answer 80% i.e. P(y/Y). If the patient was you, then you would have
cause to panic. In fact we are being asked for P(Y/y), the probability
that the patient’s true medical condition is that of cancer given that
the patient has had a positive diagnosis.These two magnitudes can be
very different and their causal relationship with each other is given
by Bayes’Theorem.
What is needed is an estimate of this probability for a particular
and random patient drawn from this population but,the above data is
aggregative in nature.To proceed note that P(Y/y) is the same as the
probability that the medical condition is Y given that we restrict out
attention to the subset of the population who receive a positive diag-
nosis, in other words, diagnosis y occurs with certainty. Let P(y) be
the proportion of the total population that will receive a positive
diagnosis and note that the random variables Z = X,Y and z = x,y are
independently distributed.Therefore the probability of having condi-
tion Y, within the whole population and not just the above subset, is
obtained by multiplication of the two terms: P(Y/y) P(y). However
this is the same as P(y/Y) P(Y) because in both cases the patient has
both condition Y and diagnosis y.Therefore:
P(Y/y) = P(y/Y) P(Y)/P(y).
Also note that P(y),by a similar argument to that used above,is given by:
P(y/Y) P(Y) + P(y/X) P(X).
The first term is the likelihood of having a positive and true diagnosis,
the second a positive but false diagnosis. These two equations
together are the constituent parts of Bayes’ Theorem so with a little
algebra one can write:
P(Y/y) = 1/{1 + [P(X)/P(Y)]/L}
where L = P(y/Y)/P(y/X).
188
John Lane and Sandro Tsang

L is called the likelihood ratio. It is the probability of a true positive
divided by the probability of a false positive.In our example,by direct
substitution,1/L = 12% and P(X)/P(Y) = 99 so P(Y/y) = 7.8%.
In contrast to the earlier and common miss-interpretation of the
data, the patient indeed has a reason to be concerned, but perhaps
there is no reason to panic just yet. A reduction from 80% to just 7.8%
is rather significant.
Now let us suppose that the physician can select from a wide
variety of diagnostic tests and think of each one being in a one to one
correspondence with quality q. Then the quality variable q deter-
mines the value of L, L = L(q) say. An increase in quality would
increase the likelihood ratio L so the posterior probability P(Y/y) of
the diagnostic result being a correct predictor increases. It becomes
1, if the test is infallible. Conversely if it decreases then the posterior
probability decreases and could become zero.
Therefore there must be a critical level of quality, Q say, with the
property that the posterior likelihood P(Y/y) exceeds the prior likeli-
hood P(Y) if,and only if,the physician selects a quality in excess of Q.
Furthermore it is easy to show that P(X/x) exceeds P(X) if and only if
q exceeds the same critical value Q.This critical quality level satisfies
L(q) = 1; the probabilities of a true positive and a false positive are
equal.
One would like the results of the diagnostic test to be more accu-
rate predictors of the patient’s medical condition than the prior
probabilities.Whether or not the parameters of the model (such as
the remuneration structure, the marginal benefit functions and the
physician’s degree of altruism) have the property that, the physi-
cian’s selected quality level exceeds Q, is a matter to be discussed in
Section 3.
2. DIAGNOSTIC CONTINGENT TREATMENTS
We now consider the relationship between treatment levels and qual-
ity levels if the diagnosis is positive (y) and also if the diagnosis is
Medical Decisions
189

negative (x). In Lane and Tsang (2008) it was shown that these rela-
tionships are identical if the independent variable is P(y/X) in the for-
mer case, but P(x/X) in the latter and also the marginal cost of
treatment is independent of the diagnosis. Note that these probabili-
ties are determined by the quality level but, in accordance with our
intuition, whilst P(y/X) decreases with increasing quality, P(x/X)
increases.The implication can then be shown that if the diagnosis is
y,then the supplied quantity of medical treatment must increase with
quality i.e., these two commodities are complementary. In contrast, if
the diagnosis is x,then quantity must decrease with increasing quality
i.e.,the two commodities are substitutable.The increase in quality has
an asymmetric impact on treatment levels.
It can further be shown that these two treatment levels are inde-
pendent of the diagnosis only if quality q is set at its critical level Q.
There is then no purpose in spending money on a diagnostic test if
the chosen quality of the test is Q or something less than this.
Nonetheless, with an inappropriate remuneration structure, this may
happen.
The final result is that the treatment quantity for the more serious
medical condition exceeds that of the alternative if and only if, the
chosen quality level exceeds its critical value.
The reader should now be able to draw the graph (against qual-
ity) of these two diagnostic contingent treatment functions, on the
basis of the information given above. Now call the satiation level of
treatment for the x-condition T(x) and that for the y-condition T(y),
where T(y) exceeds T(x). The patient would like to be supplied in
accordance with these satiation levels. But it would be fortuitous
indeed if these two targets could be achieved,or implemented,on the
basis of just one choice of quality level.This is a general principle in
economics.We return to this issue in Section 4.
3. DIAGNOSTIC QUALITY
Analytically, one must substitute the treatment functions derived
above into the objective function of the physician.There is then just
190
John Lane and Sandro Tsang

one independent variable, namely quality, and in principle, it is clear
that the best choice is that the incremental “cost”of an additional unit
of quality is equal to the additional “benefit”. Parentheses have been
used to emphasise that these terms include both direct and indirect
effects and so are quite complex to evaluate. For example, the incre-
mental cost is not simply the extra direct cost of quality provision but
must also include its effect on differential treatment levels, weighted
by the altruism parameter and the sensitivity of P(x) with respect to
quality.
What can be shown is that, under quite reasonable assumptions,
the incremental cost is positive. On the other hand the incremental
benefit, whilst positive if q exceeds Q, may otherwise be positive or
negative. In the latter case the best choice of quality exceeds its criti-
cal level. In the former case, with the “wrong”remuneration structure
and/or a sufficient absence of altruism, the choice may be below its
critical level even though this leads to the use of posterior predic-
tions which are worse than those given by the prior probabilities.
If there is an increase in altruism this best choice of quality will also
increase. Better communication between physicians and patients, or
the persuasive power of demanding patients, could be thought of as
equivalent to an increase in altruism.Also, if the prior probability of a
random patient being type Y should decrease,then quality will increase
i.e.,if it is less likely that a random patient is Y-type then greater care or
quality provision is necessary in order to correctly identify them.
Finally, note that substitution of this quality choice, into the treat-
ment functions,provides the diagnostic contingent treatment levels.
4. IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
It helps to have some notation. Let b(X) and b(Y) be the type-contin-
gent marginal benefit functions where the independent variable,
treatment quantity, has been subsumed. Let b(x) and b(y) be the diag-
nostic contingent (expected) marginal benefit functions. Because
they are weighted averages (with weights summing to one) of the
type-contingent marginal benefit functions,they are both greater than

191

b(X) and smaller than b(Y), for any given level of treatment.
Furthermore, if the chosen quality level exceeds its critical value Q,
then we can order these marginal benefit functions as below:
b(X) ≤b(x) ≤b(y) ≤b(Y)
for any given level of treatment.
The diagnostic contingent marginal benefit functions will lie closer to
their respective type-contingent marginal benefit functions if the
quality of the diagnostic test is increased.This has the effect of reduc-
ing the biases in treatment discussed below.
The ordering of b(x) and b(y) would be reversed if the chosen
quality level was less than Q.
Let us suppose that the remuneration structure is such that the
physician chooses q larger than Q.Then the above ordering implies
that if the marginal “cost” of treatment is zero, as under a full cost re-
imbursement scheme, then the patient with the less serious medical
condition X will be oversupplied;actual supply exceeds T(X),the sati-
ation level for this type.Similarly the seriously ill patient with medical
condition Y,will be undersupplied.
This provides a possible explanation for the overuse of antibi-
otics. It does not, however, imply that the physician is irrational. On
the contrary, the physician must be cogniscent of the possibility that
the patient with an x diagnosis,who will therefore be treated as an X-
type patient, may in fact be Y-type and vice-versa.There is an implicit
insurance aspect within this decision making process.
If we now consider any type of partial reimbursement scheme,
then the implied constant and positive level of marginal costs, if not
“too large”, induces a reduction in the oversupply to the patient with
a negative diagnosis, then the problem is mitigated. However if the
diagnosis is positive there will be an increase in the degree of under-
supply.
If there was no diagnostic test, so the patient is to be treated in an
identical fashion irrespective of his true condition,the (expected) mar-
ginal benefit function would lie between the two diagnostic marginal
benefit functions.This leads to an increase in the above biases.The diag-
nostic test mitigates these biases but does not fully eliminate them.
192
John Lane and Sandro Tsang

Also observe that if the ordering of the diagnostic contingent
marginal benefit functions is reversed, then the above results remain
valid but the biases will be more extreme.
The fundamental difficulty is that the pricing structure in all of
the above cases is inappropriate.As mentioned earlier, if the patient
trusts that the diagnosis is accurate, he will wish to be supplied in
accordance with his satiation levels T(X) and T(Y).There are two tar-
get values,but there is only one control namely,quality.
However we have assumed that the marginal cost of treatment
quantities is independent of the diagnosis. If we allow for differential
pricing based on the actual diagnosis then we will have introduced
one more control. It is then easy to show that if the treatment when
the diagnosis is y,is subsidized,but when it is x,it is taxed,then there
is a tax/subsidy system for which the induced choice of quality will
generate the required satiation treatment levels.

Economics of Love: A Simple
Theory and Empirical Study
in Singapore
Ho Kong Weng
Love is hard to measure as it has many dimensions and involves different
people with different background and purposes or utility functions.
Motivated by a passage from the Bible, we will focus on three dimensions
of love in our simple economic framework of love from parents to chil-
dren.The first dimension is related to time, namely, its everlasting nature.
In our economic framework, the planning horizon is effectively infinite,
incorporating children’s concern into the optimization of parents.
The second dimension is altruism, which is a care for others with sacri-
fice. Parents invest their time and money in the future of their children
instead of enjoying consumption and leisure for themselves.These efforts
by the parents are sacrifices, or costs of producing love for their chil-
dren. Are there benefits of producing love for their children? The bene-
fits could be tangible or intangible in the form of future support from
their children in old age and returned love from their children. However,
these future benefits rely on hopes or expectations which may not even
materialize eventually. The final dimension of love in our model is a
value system of rights and wrongs perceived by the parents and to be
195

transmitted to their children. Without this value system, love will not
rejoice with truth and what is produced may become hatred instead of
love. Based on simple optimizations of parents and children, a demand-
supply framework of love will be developed. Shifts in the demand and
supply curves will be used to illustrate changes in the equilibrium of
love. A simple empirical study on love among parents and their children
will be presented, illustrating how love may be quantified in a simple
manner.
INTRODUCTION
Standard simple economic models rely on a well functioning price
mechanism to bring buyers and sellers of a good or service together
in a market, whereby changes in the price of the good or service
will lead to changes in the quantity demanded and the quantity sup-
plied, until a market equilibrium is reached, meaning that both buy-
ers and sellers are satisfied with the market clearing price at which
the good or service is traded. The simplest setting leading to an
equalization of quantity demanded and quantity supplied assumes
that the good or service is identical regardless of quantity
exchanged, both the buyers and sellers are homogenous price tak-
ers solving their selfish well-being maximization problems, and,
more fundamentally, the market exists with an observable price for
a measurable good or service.
Different from many economic goods and services with well-
defined markets of exchange, love among people has many dimen-
sions, is hard to be quantified, and involves people with different
background and purposes or utility functions. In particular, is there a
market for love? What is the price of love? 
In the prostitution market of temporary love, the price of so
called love is observable and measurable but its associated but hid-
den price of potential HIV transmission and impact on families
could be less observable and under-measured. In the marriage
market of more lasting love, men and women are both buyers and
sellers. The price of a marriage may be related to the amount of
dowry, the expenditure of a wedding banquet, cost of dates and
gifts given before marriage, and cost of time in knowing one
196

another as the Ms. Right, or Mr. Right. However, the price of mar-
riage love is perceived with uncertainty about the future.“Married
happily ever after” may not be the norm as we observe a rising
divorce rate in Singapore and many other countries. Since not all of
us have participated in the above-mentioned markets of love, this
Chapter will focus on the market of love among parents and chil-
dren in which all of us have first-hand experience either as a parent
or as a child.
In the development of an economic model of love among parents
and their children,we find it helpful to examine the characteristics of
love as documented by non-economists. E.g., 1 Corithians 13: 4-8a of
the English Standard Version of the Bible reads,
“Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant
or rude.It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it
does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears
all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love
never ends”.
The above passage suggests three important dimensions of love
which we will take into consideration in the exploration of a sim-
ple economic framework of love transmitted from parents to chil-
dren.The first dimension is related to time, namely, its everlasting
nature. In the simple economic framework, the planning horizon
is effectively infinite, incorporating children’s concern into the
optimization of parents. The second dimension is altruism, which
is a care for others with sacrifice. Parents invest their time and
money in the future of their children instead of enjoying consump-
tion and leisure for themselves.These efforts by the parents are sac-
rifices, or costs of producing love for their children. Are there
benefits of producing love for their children? The benefits could be
tangible or intangible in the form of future support from their chil-
dren in old age and returned love from their children. However,
these future benefits rely on hopes or expectations which may not
even materialize eventually. The final dimension of love in our
model is a value system of rights and wrongs perceived by the
parents and to be transmitted to their children.Without this value
Economics of Love
197

system, love will not rejoice with truth and what is produced
may become hatred instead of love. In summary, an economic
framework of love with marginal benefits equated to marginal
costs has to be based on a value system and an effectively infinite
planning horizon.Based on the above simple optimization model of
love, a demand and supply framework will be developed, showing a
market equilibrium of love.
The remaining of the paper is as follows. Section 1 will develop a
simple mathematical model of parental love, and derive the supply
and demand curves of love. Section 2 will examine some theoretical
implications of the model. Section 3 will present a simple empirical
study on love among parents and their children, illustrating how love
may be quantified in a simple manner, followed by discussions on its
main findings in Section 4. Section 5 will provide the concluding
remarks.
1. A SIMPLE MATHEMATICAL MODEL
OF PARENTAL LOVE
The three aspects of (parental) love identified earlier are namely:
(1) it is everlasting,(2) it is sacrifice,and (3) it is concerned with right
and wrong. For the first aspect on an infinite planning horizon, the
optimization of a parent considers the welfare of its child and in turn,
when the child becomes a parent, the welfare of its child, or the
grandchild of the first parent will be considered. The intergenera-
tional linkage is likened to an everlasting time horizon. The sacrificial
nature of love is taken to be the parental cost involved in producing
love for the child.In particular,assume that more time spent investing
in the human capital of the child means less time for parental engage-
ment of market activities and as a result less parental consumption.
Furthermore, the parent’s preference for investing in the “good” and
“bad” stocks of human capital depends on the value system of the
parent. In particular, assume that love is generated from the invest-
ment in the “good” stock of human capital but not from the “bad”
stock of human capital.
198
Ho Kong Weng

The selfish child spends effort measured in time to gain parental
attention and satisfaction derived from parental attention and in
return he/she will take care of the parent in old age if he/she turns
out to be a “good” son or daughter. A more happy childhood due to
parental attention will translate to more care given by the “good”
son or daughter to the parent in old age. The production of love
among the parent and the child is a function of both the time spent
by the parent investing in the “good” stock of human capital of the
child and the time spent by the child in pleasing the parent and
gaining happiness in childhood.The price of love is the probability
that the son or daughter will turn out to be a “good”son or daughter
loving and caring for his/her parent in old age.The model is simple
and attempts to capture some important characteristics of parental
love while assuming away other aspects which could be realistic
but may be studied in further extensions of the basic model devel-
oped here.
1.1. Optimization of Parent and Supply of Love
The representative parent maximizes the following utility function by
choosing the amount of time at work tw, time in investing the “good”
stock of human capital for the child th,and time in investing the “bad”
stock of human capital tk:
subject to 
where θ > 0 is a parameter attached to parental consumption cp,
0 < β < 1 is the parental discount factor for the future,hc is the “good”
stock of human capital, kc is the “bad”stock of human capital, p is the

probability of the child turning “good”, vl > 0 is the value attached to
“good” or the child “loving” the parent in old age, and vn > 0 is the
value attached to “bad”or the child “not loving”the parent in old age,
and wp is the wage rate received by the parent.
Based on the above optimization, we will be able to derive a
positive relation between th and p. Since love rejoices with truth
and what is good, it is natural to specify that the quantity of love L
supplied by the parent is positively related to th, which is the time
spent investing in the “good” stock of human capital.We take p, the
probability of the child becoming a “good” child who loves and
takes care of the parent in old age,to be the price of love.Hence,we
will get a positive relation between L and p, which is the supply
curve of love.
1.2. Optimization of Child and Demand of Love
The representative child maximizes the following utility function
by choosing time spent in pleasing the parent tp and time spent for
himself/herself tc:
subject to
where φ > 0 is a parameter attached to satisfaction from parental
attention, µ > 0 is a parameter attached to independence or freedom,
0 < γ < 1 is the child’s discount factor for the future, Ul is the utility
of the “good”child,ul > 0 is a value attached to being “good”and “loving”
the parent in old age, Un is the utility of the “bad” child, and un > 0 is
the value attached to being “bad” and “not loving” the parent in old

age. Note that a higher tp, which is time spent by the child pleasing
and with the parent,will automatically translate into a lower utility of
the “good” child as he or she will spend more resources, likely to be
both money and time, on the parent, taking care of the parent and
sacrificing his or her own welfare in adulthood.A higher tp produces
more guilt or a higher sense of obligation to take care of the parent in
old age.
Based on the optimization of the child, we may derive a negative
relation between tp and p. Since love L is positively related to tp,
which is time spent by the child pleasing and with the parent,we will
have a negative relation between L and p, which is price of love as
argued earlier,or a demand curve of love.
1.3. Market Equilibrium of Love
Bringing the supply and demand curves of love together in
the same diagram gives the market equilibrium of love, indicated
by the intersection of the two curves. For simplicity, we have
drawn two linear functions in Fig. 1. In general, they could be
non-linear.
This is not the usual market of traditional goods and services but
involves the optimizations of parents and children over time with

uncertainty, and the probability associated with the “good” state is
taken to be the price of love,which is good in nature.Such a demand-
supply framework enables us to analyze the impact on the equilib-
rium quantity of love and the price of love given changes in some
exogenous parameters in the model.
2. THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS
In this section, we will consider the theoretical predictions of the
model given two changes: (1) an increase in the parental “morality”,
and (2) an increase in the quality of time spent with parents during
childhood.
2.1. An Increase in Parental “Morality”
Consider an increase in vl,the parental value attached to “good”or the
child “loving”the parent in old age. This is likened to a shift in parental
preference from “bad” to “good”, and simply assumed to be an
increase in parental “morality”. As a consequence,the parent will pro-
duce more love (which is good) via spending more time in the
“good”stock of human capital at all levels of price p. The supply curve
will shift out to the right as depicted in Fig.2.

Demand

Figure 2.
Increase in parental “morality”

Consequently, the equilibrium quantity of love is increased.
However,the price of love is now lowered. The reason for a decrease
in the price of love is a downward sloping demand curve of love: a
higher quantity of love demanded is associated with a lower price of
love. Since the price of love is also the probability of the child turn-
ing “good”, we may be puzzled by why an increase in the parental
“morality” will lead to a lower probability of the child turning
“good”.The child is selfish and also enjoys time for himself/herself;
therefore, in order to induce him/her to have more time with the
parent, who produces the increased love, the probability that
he/she has to sacrifice in the future, taking care of the parent, must
be lowered.
Another way to understand the theoretical result intuitively is
to think of an expected level of equilibrium love pL. Suppose love L
is only realized when the child turns “good” with a probability p.
Hence pL is the expected love realized. While p has decreased, L
has increased, with the product pL increased or decreased depend-
ing on the elasticity of the demand and supply curves. E.g., the
decrease in p may be small while the increase in L may be large,
resulting in an overall increase in pL. This is the case where the
demand curve has a gentle slope and the supply curve has a steep
slope.
2.2. An Increase in Quality of Time with Parents
in Childhood
Consider an increase in φ, the degree of satisfaction from parental
attention or interpreted as the extent of quality time with parents in
childhood.The child will then spend more time with the parent,lead-
ing to an upward shift of the demand curve, and resulting in a higher
equilibrium quantity of love and a higher price of love or a higher
probability of the child turning “good”. Figure 3 illustrates the impact
on the market equilibrium of love.
In this situation, it is unambiguous that the expected equilibrium
quantity of love, defined as pL, will increase as both L and p increase
given an increase in the quality of time with parents in childhood.

3. AN EMPIRICAL STUDY
An exploratory survey on quantifying love was conducted among
students and their parents in 2007. Five schools participated in this
project and classes were randomly selected from the complete
lists of classes in each school. The survey forms were then given
to students in the selected classes. A total of 2500 forms were
distributed and 624 students returned the forms, giving a response
rate of about 25%. As the project is basically unfunded without
incentive for interviewees, the attained response rate is encourag-
ing to us.
The average age of the student sample is 15.2 years, with 30.5%
males and 69.5% females as 2 of the schools involved are girl schools.
89.6% are Singaporeans, and 95.9% are Chinese. Respondents
are asked to rank the importance of various aspects of love
received from parents and to quantify on a scale from 1 to 100,
the corresponding amount of love associated with these different
dimensions of parental love: monetary or material provision
for child, giving freedom to child, emotional support for child,
moral values transmitted to child, and guiding child in terms of
setting goals. There are questions on interactions among parents
and their teenage children such as number of meals taken together,
204

Demand

frequencies of doing things they like together and one-to-one talks,
and whether there is enough communication between parents
and children.The last question asks the students to rate the overall
love on a scale from 1 to 100 received from their fathers and
mothers.
Our approach of quantifying love is based on self-reported scores
for love received from parents. This approach assumes true revela-
tions of the respondents and that the respondents understand the
meaning of the range of the scores given.As the respondents are stu-
dents from the same educational system in Singapore, the love scale
from 1 to 100 would suggest a similar scale for academic results in
Singapore and they are likely to use a common reference in rating
love received from their parents.
Table 1 shows the average scores for various aspects of and over-
all parental love received. Overall love from mothers seems to be
slightly higher than overall love from fathers. Fathers score lower in
emotional support for their children than mothers.The top scorer in
paternal love is monetary or material provision;for maternal love,it is
moral value transmission. Based on these summary statistics, we see a
gender role of love transmission: fathers specialize in certain aspects
of love while mothers specialize in others.We will discuss the gender
role of love transmission further in the next section. Guidance in set-
ting goals is the lowest aspect of love received among the five aspects
of parental love.

4. DISCUSSIONS
In this section,we will report results from simple regressions to show
that love transmission is time intensive, fathers and mothers special-
ize in different aspects of love, and that moral values and emotional
support are important determinants of love transmission.
4.1. Spend Time, Not Money, to Transmit Love
We regress the overall love from father or mother on number of meals
taken together, frequency of doing things together, frequency of one-
to-one talks, and whether there is enough communication between
parents and children, with controls on age and gender of the stu-
dents. Our results show that all these time-intensive activities explain
the quantity of parental love received very well and are statistically
significant at 5% level.We have added other money-related variables
on the right-hand side of the regression but they are all insignificant
in explaining parental love received. The message is, time but not
money,is crucial in transmitting love.
4.2. Parental Gender Specialization
in Love Transmission
Next, we regress the overall paternal love on the various aspects of
paternal love to find out what aspects of love are important in
explaining overall love received from fathers with controls on age
and gender of the students.Likewise we perform the regression analy-
sis on maternal love.The results are reported in Table 2.Monetary pro-
vision and emotional support from fathers are important determinants
of paternal love. Although fathers on average do not score well on
emotional support as reported in Table 1, those who do well,
improves the paternal overall love transmitted significantly. The
regression suggests that a one-point increase in the score of fatherly
emotional support will increase overall love by 0.4 point. Older stu-
dents tend to receive lower overall love from fathers, accordingly to
our regression results.In contrast to love from fathers,the overall love
206
Ho Kong Weng

from mothers is significantly explained by emotional support, moral
value transmission, and guidance in goal setting. Mothers seem to be
better in showing love via guidance in moral values and goal setting.
Daughters seem to report more overall love received from mothers
than sons. The results in Table 2 suggest that fathers and mothers have
a division of labor in the transmission of love to their children. Since
fathers are usually the bread winners or earn more than mothers in
the formal labor market,they focus on monetary or material provision
as a channel of love for their children while mothers focus on other
aspects of love within the family such as moral value transmission,
guidance in goal setting. Emotional support is an important channel
of love transmission for both fathers and mothers.
4.3. Importance of Moral Value and Emotional Support
Table 3 reports the average ranking on various aspects of parental
love as reported by the students. According to these average rankings,
emotional support is the most important channel of love, and moral
value transmission from parents is the second most important chan-
nel. Monetary or material provision is the least important channel
among the five aspects of parental love.
When we run parental overall love regressions on the various
rankings reported by the students,we find that rankings of emotional

support, moral value transmission, and guidance in goal setting are
statistically significant. As the ranking of these aspects of parental love
improves,the overall love received will increase too.
5. CONCLUSION
Our empirical results suggest that the transmission of parental love is
time intensive, fathers and mothers divide the task of transmitting
love to their children according to their comparative advantages, and
moral values and emotional support are important aspects of parental
love for their children.These findings are supporting evidence for our
theoretical model which focuses on the three aspects of love: love is
sacrifice,love is about right and wrong and,love never ends.

The Role of Exchange Rates in Foreign
Direct Investment: A United States
Perspective
Ho Woon Yee
International transactions of goods, service and assets determine a country’s
exchange rate but the exchange rate for seemingly good reasons does not
influence the international purchases and sale of assets.If a foreign asset gen-
erates a future stream of profits denominated in foreign currency and if the
profits will be converted back into the domestic currency at the same
exchange rate, the present discounted value of the investment will not be
affected by the level of the exchange rate. This chapter presents recent devel-
opments in the academic literature on FDI with specific references to Froot
and Stein (1991) and Blonigen (1997). The studies show that when selected
conditions under perfect markets are relaxed, exchange rates perform a defi-
nite role in explaining FDI flows. Under these conditions, the connection
between real exchange rate levels and FDI become clearly unambiguous.
INTRODUCTION
In a world of capital mobility,a country’s exchange rate is determined
by balances in the capital and current accounts. The component
209

investment flows within the capital account, particularly the relative
magnitude of portfolio verses direct investments are not affected by
changes in the exchange rates.Yet,the view that exchange rates play
no role in affecting FDI flows is at odds with empirical observations
that higher FDI flows into the United States is associated with lower
values of the US dollar.1 This chapter presents recent developments
in the literature on foreign direct investment (FDI) that explains
the influence of exchange rates on FDI inflows. The chapter pro-
ceeds with a review of exchange rate determination, followed by a
discussion of foreign portfolio investment and direct investment.
The discussion highlights the differences in motivations for portfo-
lio and direct investment flows and then addresses the role of
exchange rates in FDI inflows with specific references to Froot and
Stein (1991) and Blonigen (1997). Both studies exemplify the com-
plementary but varied approaches used to explain the causes of
FDI flows.
DETERMINATION OF EXCHANGE RATES
International transactions make it necessary for the currency of a
country to be traded for another. The rate at which two currencies
are traded is known as the bilateral exchange rate.For example,if one
US dollar can be exchanged for 110 Japanese yen, the exchange rate
between the United States and Japanese currencies is 110 yen per
dollar. In a flexible exchange rate regime, the value of a currency is
determined by the supply and demand for the currency in the foreign
exchange market,a market in which currencies of various nations are
traded for one another.
In the foreign exchange market, the supply of dollars is the
amount of dollars that the household and firms offer for trade with
other currencies. It is not the same as the money supply set by the
central bank. While the central bank determines the total supply of
dollars in the economy, a dollar is not counted as having been sup-
plied to the foreign exchange market until holders of dollars, such as
210

a household or firm trade the dollar for a foreign currency. Similarly,
the demand for dollars in the foreign exchange market is not the
same as the domestic demand for money, but the number of dollars
that holders of foreign currencies seek to buy.
In the case of the United States, the key suppliers of US dollars
in the foreign exchange market are, US households and firms and
they do so for two main reasons. Firstly, a US household or firm
wants to purchase a foreign good or service. For example, an
American household wants to buy a car made in Japan and supplies
US dollars in the foreign exchange market for yen to import the
Japanese car. Likewise, an American traveling to Japan requires yen
to make purchases when he is in Osaka and supplies the US dollars
for yen. Secondly, a US household or firm wants to purchase a for-
eign asset. With savings, a US household could purchase stocks
issued by firms in Japan.Because the stocks from Japan are priced in
yen, the US household or firm will supply US dollars for yen to
acquire Japanese assets. The supply of US dollars to the foreign
exchange market is shown by the upward sloping curve in Fig. 1.
While we focus on the market in which US dollars are traded for
Japanese yen, there are similar markets for every pair of traded
currencies.

Determination of the US Dollar in the Foreign Exchange Market

The up-ward supply curve for US dollars shows that more US
dollars are being supplied in the foreign exchange market as each
US dollar exchanges for more yen.The appreciation of the US dollar
when the dollar can buy more yen at given prices makes Japanese
goods,services and assets cheaper in dollar terms,ceteris paribus.The
lower dollar prices resulting from the appreciation of the US dollar
induce higher dollar expenditure of Japanese goods, services and
assets.
The demand of US dollars in the yen-dollar foreign exchange
market is made by anyone who holds yen, mainly Japanese house-
holds and firms who want to purchase US goods, services and
assets.A Japanese student studying in the US pays his tuition fee in
US dollars by offering yen in demand for US dollars. Similarly, a
Japanese firm who buys real estate in New York City would demand
US dollar to purchase the asset.When the US dollar buys more yen
or when the yen buys less US dollars, the US dollar appreciates
which makes US goods, services and assets more expensive in terms
of yen. Resultantly, Japanese households and firms will demand a
lower quantity of US dollars when the US dollar appreciates.Thus,
the demand for US dollar is downward sloping as shown in Fig. 1.
As the US maintains a flexible exchange rate regime, the value of
the US dollar at equilibrium,E* is determined by the forces of demand
and supply in the foreign exchange market.Factors affecting both the
demand and supply for US dollars will result in shifts of the respective
demand and supply curves causing the equilibrium value of the US
dollar to change. Because foreigners buying US goods and services
(US exports) and US assets (US capital inflows) affect the demand for
US dollars,changes in US exports and US capital inflows lead to shifts
in the demand schedule of US dollars.Likewise, Americans buying for-
eign goods and services (US imports) and foreign assets (US capital
outflows) affect the supply of US dollars. Changes in US imports
and US capital outflow lead to shifts in the supply schedule of US
dollars.Thus, a currency’s exchange rate is determined primarily by
the nation’s international transactions as reflected in the balance of
payments account.

INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL FLOWS
Within the balance of payment accounts,the current account records
the exports and imports of goods and services and the capital
account records purchases and sales of assets, reflecting capital
flows. Capital outflow results from domestic residents buying foreign
assets and capital inflow results from foreigners buying domestic
assets. Within the capital account, international flows of capital can
be distinguished as foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign port-
folio investment. Foreign portfolio investment consists of purchases
of stocks, also called shares or equities, bonds and bank loans. Using
Singapore as an example, if a Singaporean purchases stock in
Microsoft Corporation, it is Singapore’s foreign portfolio investment.
The investment is financed by Singapore. But the business of manag-
ing Microsoft Corporation is undertaken by non-Singaporeans. The
Singapore stock owner plays a passive role in the business operations
of Microsoft Corporation. By contrast, FDI occurs when the residents
of one country acquire control of a firm in another country. It may
involve buying sufficient stock in an existing firm and along with the
owner of the foreign firm becomes a controlling shareholder. This is
known as a joint venture FDI. Incidentally, it could involve acquiring
complete ownership and control of the foreign firm leading to a
merger and acquisition FDI. It could also involve building a new fac-
tory or firm from scratch, leading to a greenfield FDI. Development
Bank of Singapore (DBS) opening a new branch in Shanghai is an
example of Singapore’s greenfield FDI in China. In this case, DBS, a
firm owned by Singapore is actively managing the investment.
In the examples of foreign investments mentioned above,
Singapore residents are buying assets located in another country
which results in Singapore’s capital outflow. If capital flows are
viewed as resources in search of the highest returns, capital from
countries where interest rates are low would flow to countries
where interest rates are high in order for investment returns to be
maximized.Apart from economic and political risks of holding for-
eign assets and government policies affecting foreign ownership of
The Role of Exchange Rates in FDI
213

domestic assets, the real interest returns on holding assets influ-
ences the purchase and sale of assets. In the absence of risk, uncer-
tainties and barriers to capital mobility, capital flows occur until
interest rates become equal everywhere. In the presence of risk,
uncertainties and barriers to capital movement, however, equilibrium
flows capital does not require interest rates equality. Differences in
interest rates among countries would reflect different risk levels,
uncertainties and barriers to capital mobility. Unless changes in inter-
est rates are sufficiently large,capital flows are not likely to occur.
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
If interest rate determines capital flows that allow investment returns
to be maximized, there are several observations on interest rate
returns that distinguish foreign portfolio investment from FDI. Firstly,
firms engaging in FDI often finance an important share of the invest-
ment in the country where FDI is undertaken.A property developer
from Singapore with development projects in China may finance part
of the FDI with loans from Chinese banks. If higher interest returns
motivate FDI flows, it is hard to understand why FDI firms would
finance investments in countries that may not necessarily provide
lower cost of loans.
Secondly, foreign portfolio investment and FDI do not behave in
similar ways.Increased portfolio investment flows to a certain coun-
try may not be accompanied by similar FDI inflows to the same
country. In examining the behavior of FDI inflows into countries
affected by economic crisis, Lipsey (2001) finds that FDI flows into
crisis countries have been more stable than flows of portfolio
investment. In the East Asian financial crisis, gross inflows of FDI in
the region fell only slightly in 1998 and were back above the previ-
ous peak level by 1999. While net inflows of FDI did not fall, net
portfolio investment inflows fell sharply which turned into net
portfolio outflows.
Thirdly, if interest returns can explain FDI flows, FDI should
move to some countries and all industries. On the contrary, FDI is
persistently associated with the same industries. In fact, much of the
214
Ho Woon Yee

FDI flows among advanced countries is concentrated in industries
intensive in skills and technology such as electronics, chemicals and
computer technology and less so in the textile and agricultural indus-
tries. This is difficult to account for, if international differences in
interest rates are the reason for FDI flows.
Given that interest rate differences is insufficient to explain FDI
flows, the academic literature on FDI since the seminal work of
Hymer (1960) have focused on profit motives of FDI activities, cen-
tered on the ownership of firm-specific assets or knowledge.
Appropriating the use of firm-specific assets or knowledge, FDI firms
optimize returns and maximize profits, enabling firms to compete
effectively in forgein countries. To this end, the demand for FDI is
widely viewed as the demand for capital to finance and directly man-
age business activities in a foreign country. Unlike portfolio invest-
ments which do not give investors any controlling interest in the
firm’s business operations, FDI involves both the ownership and con-
trol of the firm’s operations. It is this aspect of control that distin-
guishes foreign portfolio investment from FDI.
When firms locate operations abroad, they face disadvantages
not encountered by firms that choose to locate production activities
on home ground. These disadvantages include additional efforts in
managing geographically widespread operations, dealing with differ-
ent languages, cultures, product standards and consumer prefer-
ences. To overcome these disadvantages, firms with overseas
operations must possess firm-specific knowledge or assets.This may
be in the form of superior production and management skills. The
inventory management strategy used by Toyota, a Japanese automo-
bile manufacturer emphasizing timely arrival of manufacturing parts
that result in lower warehousing and associated costs, is an example.
In other situation, a foreign firm may place a greater value on a
domestic firm than other competitors because the domestic firm
offers a potential role in the foreign firm’s global strategy.The cross-
border acquisition of the marine and mining logistics firm,
Sembawang Kimtrans by Toll, a logistics firm headquartered in
Australia,is an example.The acquisition FDI was carried out with the
aim of expanding Toll’s business activities as an integrated logistic
The Role of Exchange Rates in FDI
215

provider in Asia.The value of the acquisition to Toll came in the form
of firm-specific assets from Sembawang Kimtrans along with sizable
market share in the marine, mining and land logistics sector in
Indonesia and Singapore.Aside from expanding market share, firms
could locate production in a foreign country to appropriate gains
from activities there — in research and development, for example.
Co and List (2004) show that Japanese FDI in the US is attracted to
“knowledge creators”, places in the US where there are more
research and development activities.
For these reasons, the explanation of FDI in the academic litera-
ture has focused on the industrial organization of firms. Interest
returns and costs as factors that motivate FDI to the extent that they
may be right, do not seem to explain FDI flows better than the indus-
trial organization approach, at least among industrial nations. This
includes the depreciation of a country’s exchange rate that inciden-
tally results in a lower cost of investment.The possibility of a relation-
ship of exchange rate depreciation that could lead to more capital
inflows does not seem to be supported by economic reasoning.This is
because,returns on risk-adjusted assets traded in a world with increas-
ingly less barriers to capital mobility are expected to be equalized. In
the context of FDI, when the foreign currency depreciates, the profits
generated by foreign operations and expressed in terms of the home
country’s currency will also decrease. Even as it implies that the cost
of establishing operations in the foreign country is lower with the
depreciation of the foreign currency, it really makes no difference
where and how a firm finances FDI since firms have access to the
same international capital market. If the US dollar depreciates, the US
becomes a cheaper place for any firm to produce.Hence,there are no
“bargains”with the depreciation of exchange rate.
EXCHANGE RATE AND FDI
Despite the appealing argument, data on inflows of FDI in the US
show a systematic relationship with the US dollar. Since 1973, after
the Bretton woods fixed exchange rate regime, the depreciation of
the US dollar shows a positive correlation with FDI inflows in the
216
Ho Woon Yee

US.The explanation of the correlation between the value of a cur-
rency and FDI inflows is addressed by Froot and Stein (1991).They
identify information asymmetry between lenders and borrowers
and build on the idea that FDI firms face a higher cost of financing
when they borrow from external sources than when they use inter-
nally generated funds.This is because borrowers know more about
the use of borrowed funds in generating returns from FDI projects
than lenders. Lenders who have less information on how their
loans are utilized must gather information. In collecting informa-
tion to monitor the performance of loans and the payoffs of invest-
ment projects, they incur monitoring costs. The cost of acquiring
information drives a wedge between the cost of financing FDI proj-
ects from external sources such as bank loans, bonds and stock
issues; and the cost of financing FDI projects from internal sources
such as retained profits.The more internal funds rather than exter-
nal funds, a firm uses to finance FDI projects, the lower will be the
firm’s total cost of capital. It also implies that the more net wealth a
firm brings into its FDI projects, the lower will be its total cost of
capital.
Given the link between wealth position of firms and invest-
ment opportunities, Froot and Stein (1991) develop the explana-
tion for the persistent relationship between exchange rates and
FDI. Using the US as the home country, they explain that foreigners
will hold more of their wealth denominated in their respective
countries’ currencies. A depreciation of the US dollar increases
the relative wealth of foreign firms and therefore lower their rela-
tive cost of capital.The relative wealth increase resulting from the
depreciation of the US dollar enables foreign firms to bid higher for
US assets.
The explanation can be illustrated with an example. Suppose a
Singapore firm and a US firm are bidding to purchase an office build-
ing in New York City. Either firm can obtain a loan from a bank on the
same terms.The bank will lend at an interest rate of 10% for up to 90%
of the purchase price.The US firm has 7 million US dollars (USD) and
Singapore firm has 10 million Singapore dollars (SGD) and the
exchange rate prevails at 1.5 SGD/USD.In this scenario,the US firm can
The Role of Exchange Rates in FDI
217

make a USD 7 million down payment and can bid as high as
USD 70 million for the building. The Singapore firm on the contrary
has wealth of only USD 6.67 million and can bid only as high as
USD 67.7 million.The US firm wins the biding in this case.Suppose the
US dollar depreciates to an exchange rate of 1.2 SGD/USD.The wealth
of the Singapore firm now increases to USD 8.33 million and given the
US dollar depreciation,wins the bidding.The resulting US dollar depre-
ciation that increased the relative wealth of the Singaporean firm and
changed the outcome of the bidding.
In the example above, the imperfection in capital markets is 
a result of asymmetric information. Capital remains perfectly mobile
because the Singapore firm and the US firm have access to the same
external borrowing facilities.It is information asymmetry that drives the
imperfection and this imperfection affects only information intensive
investments.Investments which are not intensive in information such as
portfolio investments in stocks and bonds are unlikely to be influenced
by imperfect capital markets caused by asymmetric information.
Empirical tests in Froot and Stein (1991) show evidence that the value
of the US dollar influences only US FDI inflows. Portfolio investment
inflows consisting of stocks and corporate bonds do not show any sig-
nificant statistical relationship with the value of the US dollar. Further
empirical evidence of the relationship between foreign exchange rates
and FDI inflows are found in Klein and Rosengren (1994), Klein, Peek
and Rosengren (2002) and Alba,Wang and Ho (2007).
An alternative explanation for the correlation between FDI and
the real exchange rate is developed in Blonigen (1997). Instead of
assuming imperfect capital markets, Blonigen (1997) assumes imper-
fect goods markets.If the goods markets are segmented,with US firms
having limited access to foreign markets, foreign firms that can
extend operations abroad will value more highly firm-specific assets
in the US when the US dollar depreciates.
The acquisition of US firm-specific assets, namely advance tech-
nology and superior management techniques allows foreign firms to
generate returns in foreign markets which are relatively inaccessible
by US firms.The market access asymmetry implies that a depreciation
of the US dollar will induce more acquisition of US firm-specific
218
Ho Woon Yee

assets in the US as foreign firms will place higher values on these
assets. The key assumption in the explanation proposed by Blonigen
(1997) is the asymmetric access to the goods markets between
domestic and foreign firms.The foreign acquisition of US firm-specific
assets generates returns for foreign firms in foreign markets that US
firms have limited access. In this regard, Blonigen (1997) identifies
the Japanese market which is widely known to be insulated to some
degree from foreign import penetration and FDI.While the opportu-
nity to purchase US firm-specific assets remain the same for the US
firm and the Japanese firm, both firms face different opportunities to
generate returns when the US firm has limited access to the Japanese
market.As a result, the depreciation of the US dollar raises the valua-
tion of US firm-specific assets by Japanese firms while the valuation of
US assets by US firms remains unchanged.
In 1989, Sony, a Japanese electronics manufacturer acquired
film-making technology when Sony bought Columbia Pictures, a US
firm. The acquisition provided Sony, which was predominantly an
electronics manufacturer at that time, with film-production technol-
ogy and firm-specific assets, enabling the company, to enter and
operate in the film making industry. The merger and acquisition
resulting in the formation of Sony Pictures continued to produce
movies which are screened not only in the US but also in Japan,
where it could have been less accessible, had the acquisition FDI
not taken place.
CONCLUSION
This chapter presents selected developments in the FDI literature on
the role of exchange rate in attracting FDI inflows.The explanations
developed in Froot and Stein (1991) and Blonigen (1997) are not
mutually exclusive as they draw on different perspectives of FDI.
Froot and Stein (1991) assume imperfect capital markets due to
information asymmetry between lenders and borrowers while
Blonigen (1997) assumes imperfect goods market because of market
access asymmetry between domestic and foreign firms. In both
explanations of FDI, assumptions underlying economic theories

eased to accommodate market imperfections in order to resolve dif-
ferences in empirical observations and economic theory.
