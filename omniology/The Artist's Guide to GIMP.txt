Acknowledgments
There’s no such thing as a one-man project, and this book is no 
exception. While the tutorials are mine, the ideas and motiva-
tions come from all over the world, from many artists and design-
ers with much greater talent that I’ll ever possess. To them, I owe 
my modest artistic accomplishments.
But even before these tutorials could be created, someone 
had to build the tools. To the GIMP Development Team, with 
specific thanks to Sven Neumann and Michael Natterer for keep-
ing the project going for many years, I thank you for your years of 
dedication and hard work.
I owe the staff at Linux Format (past and present) a heartfelt 
thanks for publishing my GIMP tutorials series long enough for 
me to come up with the ideas in this book. 
Of course, my biggest thanks are due to Bill Pollock at No 
Starch Press for eagerly accepting the idea for this book. And 
extra thanks go to the rest of the gang at No Starch Press: 
Alison Law and Tyler Ortman for their editing, and Leigh 
Poehler and Rachel Waner on the sales and marketing team. 
Thanks to Rolf Steinort from Meet The Gimp! (http://meetthegimp 
.org/) for his technical reviews, video clarifications, and assis-
tance with learning new features in GIMP 2.8. Without all their 
great help this would be nothing more than a bunch of text files 
and screenshots.
Thanks to Greg Martin for graciously allowing me to create a 
GIMP version of his original Photoshop star field tutorial (http://
www.gallery.artofgregmartin.com/tuts_arts/making_a_star_field.html).
Additional thanks to my mom for once again letting me use 
a photo of her from her high school days in the photo restoration 
chapter. I know I wouldn’t want my high school pictures used for 
anything except fireplace kindling.

Many of this book’s tutorials are inspired by tutorials pre-
sented in countless Photoshop texts. My knowledge of how to use 
tools like GIMP was born from those early Photoshop tutorials; 
I learned to translate and reimagine those techniques into the 
button sequences and pixel pushing required to reproduce the 
concepts using GIMP. Despite this extensive reading, I never actu-
ally used Photoshop until many years later, when my wife started 
using it. Though I know “where everything is” in Photoshop, I 
find myself happily using GIMP instead. We all have our comfort 
zones; use what makes you happy.


Introduction
I’ve been writing about Linux and GIMP in particular since 
1996. I’ve written for every kind of publication, ranging from 
countless print articles and magazine columns to website mus-
ings and multiple books. In 2001, I wrote about how Linux and 
GIMP were starting to make waves in the special-effects industry 
with the article “Linux Goes to the Movies” in Salon.com. Open 
source has come a long way since then. And so has GIMP.
When GIMP was first started as a class project at the Univer-
sity of California, Berkeley, it was built on top of the venerable 
Motif toolkit, which at the time was really the only full-featured 
software library for X11-based windowing systems. Version 0.54 
was my first taste of the GIMP in this form. Later, the GIMP Tool-
kit (GTK+) was born, and it replaced Motif for various techni-
cal reasons. Somewhere between version 0.54 and version 0.99, 
I ported John Beale’s Sparkle code to a GIMP plug-in. For that 
ancient yet still meaningful work, I’m listed as a contributor to 
the project. It even got me into the Red Hat “friends and family” 
plan when they had their IPO (I should’ve sold when it was at its 
peak—silly me). Eventually, my association with the project led 
me to write for the Linux Gazette and later Linux Journal, the latter 
of which led to my first book on GIMP, in fact the first book on 
GIMP, called The Artists’ Guide to the GIMP. You might say I’ve fol-
lowed Linux and GIMP from day one.
Of course, after all these years I’m no longer the only one 
writing on this subject, and GIMP is no longer just a class project. 
Plenty of texts exist that show you which button opens which dia-
log. In the first edition of this book, I hoped to go where no one 
else had attempted, beyond the application itself and into what 
it can do. In this second edition, I’m updating the old tutorials, 
tossing in some new ones, and giving you a look at how GIMP is 
evolving.
Linux and GIMP have grown up together, and they are no 
longer youngsters in the computing world. Linux comes with a 
serious desktop, and GIMP is a serious application. It’s time to 
get down to business: the business of graphic design. This book is 
about learning techniques applicable to the real world. 
What This Book Is About
This book is about process, not buttons or menu paths. My goal is 
to show you that the processes required to perform a task can be 
done with GIMP as easily as with any other graphics editor. It isn’t 
the tool that’s important, it’s understanding the process. It’s far 
easier to grasp that a mask is a black region blocking out a sec-
tion of an image than it is to find a use for an alpha channel and 
a black background. Don’t get bogged down in the mechanics 
of the tool. Focus on the task at hand. I’ll point you to the GIMP 
components necessary to finish the job. By the time you’re done 
with these tutorials, you won’t need any more pointing. 
If you can’t find a dialog referenced in the text, just open 
the Dockable Dialogs menu, available from the Windows menu. 
Clicking a menu entry jumps to that dialog quickly if it’s already 
open or opens it if necessary.
This book was written during the development of GIMP 2.8, 
so it’s most relevant to that particular version of GIMP. But I’ve 
tried to keep my advice general enough that the book remains 
useful even as newer versions of GIMP are released. 
What This Book Is Not About
In this book, you won’t find manual pages for each filter, menu, 
or feature. I won’t be explaining each icon you find or why some 
dialogs look like they do. Instead, the tutorials presented here 
show how to use filters as if they were a set of tools in a toolbox. 

xviii   Introduction
You seldom need just a hammer for a project. GIMP provides the 
hammer, the saw, the drill, even the kitchen sink. With this book, 
I hope you’ll learn to use all the tools in the toolbox. 
How This Book Is Organized
The book has six chapters, each consisting of multiple tutorials. 
Each chapter covers a different area of graphic design: Funda-
mental Techniques, Photographic Effects, Web Design, Advertis-
ing and Special Effects, Type Effects, and Creative Inspiration 
(advanced projects). Each tutorial opens with introductory mate-
rial on the subject at hand and includes a set of tips related to 
that area of design.
Chapter 1 provides a set of core tips laid out in an introduc-
tory fashion, from the toolbox to common tasks like drawing and 
text manipulation. Users new to GIMP should read this chapter 
thoroughly, while more advanced users may glance through it or 
skip it altogether. Each tutorial after Chapter 1 is an independent 
project, so try to find a project that strikes your fancy. These tuto-
rials can be completed in any order. 
Chapter 2 is for photographers. GIMP’s raster processing is 
ideal for working with photographs and stock imagery. The num-
ber of effects you can create is limitless, but this chapter will help 
you get started with some often-used photographic techniques.
Chapter 3 is all about graphic design for the Web. In many 
areas of the Web, static images still play key roles. Features like 
background images, menus and buttons, and logos are all part 
and parcel of everyday GIMP work.
Chapter 4 will take you to the world of advertising design 
and special effects. In this chapter, you’ll find techniques to 
create 2-D and 3-D designs for products ranging from posters 
to cell phones to underwater adventures.
Chapter 5 covers type effects. GIMP is wonderful at turning 
boring fonts into fantastic logos and 3-D designs. This chapter 
will walk you through re-creating some commonly used text 
effects.
Chapter 6 is new to this edition of the book. It provides sev-
eral advanced tutorials whose primary purpose is to inspire you 
to new creative heights. Use this chapter as your springboard to 
advanced use of GIMP.
Each tutorial starts with a project summary, accompanied by 
reasons for using the technique. The tutorials are designed to 
allow you to quickly re-create them step by step using the default 
tools and features that come with GIMP. 
A Few More Hints 
I won’t be referencing keyboard shortcuts very often—with a 
few exceptions like Select All (ctrl-A) or Deselect All (ctrl-
shift-A)—because GIMP allows you to customize the shortcuts 
any way you like. Instead, I’ll reference the default menu loca-
tions where necessary. If the feature has a keyboard shortcut, it’ll 
be listed next to that option in the menu. Learn those to speed 
your work through these tutorials. 
Note that the use of the ctrl and alt keys are shown as they’re 
used with Linux. Users of Windows or Mac can map these key-
strokes to their appropriate platform equivalents. 
Also note that key presses for the keyboard are always listed 
with uppercase letters to make the key sequence easier to read. 
Unless shift is specifically listed with the keystroke, the shift key 
need not be used.  
A Useful Package 
GIMP Paint Shop (http://code.google.com/p/gps-gimp-paint-studio/) 
is a package providing additional brushes, palettes, patterns, and 
excellent tool presets that provide simulated artist’s tools and tech-
niques. It’s a must-have if you plan on taking your GIMP skills to 
the next level. 
You can check out more ways to extend the power of GIMP at 
registry.gimp.org. 
About the Canvas
Unless otherwise noted, assume a default canvas size of 640 × 
400 pixels to make the tutorials easier to produce on slower sys-
tems. This size works fine on the Web, but you’ll need to scale up 
the process if you intend to use a technique for a print project: 
increase the amount of blur, adjust the number of pixels to offset 
a layer, and so forth. The thing to remember in each tutorial is 

Introduction   xix
the basic set of steps: add text, blur, offset a layer, duplicate and 
rotate, and so on. The amount of each of these varies with the 
scale of the project, and print projects tend to use significantly 
larger canvases than the default 640 × 400 pixel, 72 dpi canvas 
used in these tutorials.
Be sure not to create the project at the default canvas size 
and then try to scale it up at the end! Doing so produces grainy, 
unsuitable results.
In this book, the terms canvas and image window are inter-
changeable. The official GIMP documentation refers to the main 
drawing area as an image window. I like to use canvas because the 
term image is somewhat overused—it can mean more than one 
thing, depending on context. Besides, artists work on a canvas. 
They produce images. It just makes sense to me.

F u n da m e n ta l T ech niqu e s
The GNU Image Manipulation Program (or GIMP) is one of the 
world’s most popular open source projects. It allows everyday 
users on a budget to harness the graphical abilities of virtually 
any computer. Open source means anyone can improve the pro-
gram, and it’s free to download.
To install GIMP, go to http://www.gimp.org/ and find the 
download and installation instructions for your operating system. 
GIMP runs on all three major platforms: Mac, Windows, and 
Linux. In fact, if you use Linux, it’s probably already installed 
on your machine. You’ll need to run GIMP 2.8 in order to follow 
along with the tutorials in this book (though the tutorials are 
written to be applicable to the older 2.6 version as well). Come 
back once you’ve got it up and running! These tutorials provide 
practice and guidance in using GIMP’s features but little hand-
holding when it comes to the program’s basic tools and features. 
The book assumes that you’ll learn best by experimenting and 
combining effects. If you’re a beginner, read the first section in 
each chapter carefully, and check out GIMP’s official user man-
ual if you get confused (http://docs.gimp.org/en/).
For readers transitioning from other image-editing software 
programs and for those of you completely new to GIMP, this 
book begins with a quick introduction to the most important 
elements of GIMP’s interface: the toolbox and the image win-
dow. If you’re already a GIMP enthusiast, you may want to skip 
ahead to Section 1.1. If you haven’t used GIMP before, or if you’d 
like to refresh your memory, read on.
Multi-Window vs. Single-Window Mode
GIMP 2.8 introduced two ways to work with GIMP windows. The 
original method used separate windows for everything: toolbox, 
dialogs, canvas, and so forth. In GIMP 2.8, choose Windows4 
Single-Window mode to place all windows into a single one. This 
new method will be familiar to Windows users, while the original 
Multi-Window mode will be familiar to Mac and Linux users. 
Throughout this chapter, examples of both modes will be shown 
where appropriate and meaningful.
N o t e 	
Throughout the book you’ll find the interchangeable terms 
image window and canvas window. The official designa-
tion is image window, but since the term image is often over-
used, the term canvas window was chosen to avoid confusion.

2   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
GIMP’s default window layout in Multi-Window mode (upper left) and Single-
Window mode (lower right)
The GIMP Toolbox
The default layout for GIMP, from left to right, includes the tool-
box, an empty canvas window, and the default docks. The toolbox 
holds all of GIMP’s core tools. The canvas window is used to draw, 
paint, and edit images. Docks are windows that hold one or 
more of GIMP’s various dialogs, such as the Layers, Channels, 
Brush, and Paths dialogs.
N o t e 	
The term dialog refers to a type of window, usually one that 
opens upon a specific request for a tool or other feature.
The table below shows the icons for each tool available in 
the toolbox and briefly describes that tool’s abilities. Each tool 
also has a Tool Options dialog, which allows you to fine-tune how 
each tool is applied and achieve exactly the effect you desire. 
We’ll discuss the Tool Options dialog shortly.
Toolbox Icons
Tool
Function
Rectangle 
Select
This tool allows you to create editable rectangular 
selections. Use the Tool Options to specify how the 
new selection should be combined with existing 
selections. Hold down the shift key while selecting 
to create a perfect square.
Ellipse 
Select
The Ellipse Select tool is just like the Rectangle 
Select tool, except that the shape of the selection 
is elliptical. Hold down the shift key to create a 
perfect circle.
Free Select
Another selection tool, the Free Select tool, allows 
drawing curved freehand and polygon outlines to 
create a selection. Both types of outlines can be 
mixed in a single selection. 
Fuzzy  
Select
The Fuzzy Select tool selects pixels based on their 
similarity in color and proximity to the point you 
click in the image window. Using higher Threshold 
settings in the Tool Options dialog will cause 
more pixels to be selected. You can change the 
threshold by moving the mouse while pressing 
the left mouse button. Check the Sample merged 
checkbox to choose pixels from the visible canvas 
(i.e., from all layers combined) instead of from only 
the current layer.
Select by 
Color
The Select by Color tool is similar to the Fuzzy 
Select tool, except the chosen pixels don’t need 
to be in close proximity to one another.

Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques﻿   3
Toolbox Icons (continued)
Tool
Function
Scissors
This is an intelligent tool that finds edges in an 
image, making it easier to manually outline an oddly 
shaped figure and create a selection around it.
Foreground 
Select
This tool allows you to isolate objects in a single 
layer from their surroundings, using free selects 
mixed with paint strokes. 
Paths
Paths are vector components in GIMP1 and consist 
of a series of nodes connected by straight or curved 
lines. You can edit the curve to change the position 
of nodes and the arc of lines. The Paths tool allows 
you to create a new path or edit an existing one.
Color Picker Use this tool to change the foreground or back­
ground colors in the toolbox. With the Color Picker 
tool active, just click any pixel on the canvas.
Zoom
Use the Zoom tool to zoom in on or out of a section 
of an image. Drag a box around an area to zoom 
in on that spot.
Measure
Use the Measure tool to measure angles and 
distances in an image. These measurements are 
useful when used in combination with the Rotate 
and Scale tools.
Move
This tool allows you to move image elements like 
layers, selections, text, and masks around the 
image window.
Align
The Align tool allows interactive alignment of layers.
Crop
The Crop tool is the best way to crop images quickly. 
You can also use it to crop individual layers.
1. In simplest terms, vectors are lines that include information about the path they 
travel from one endpoint to another. They have no information about the pixels used 
to create them in GIMP’s image window. Most GIMP tools are raster based, which 
means they operate on pixels. A pixel is a dot with red, green, blue, and transpar­
ency levels.
Toolbox Icons (continued)
Tool
Function
Rotate
The transform tools can be applied to layers, 
selections, and paths. Use the Rotate tool to 
perform a rotation on any of these.
Scale
Another transform tool, the Scale tool is used to 
interactively resize layers, selections, and paths.
Shear
Use the Shear tool to keep opposite sides of a 
bounding box (the edges of a layer, selection, or 
path) parallel while moving pixels within the box 
left/right or up/down.
Perspective
The Perspective tool stretches the bounding box as 
if you’re viewing a square photo head-on and you 
tilt the photo away from you, so that the far edge 
appears shorter than the near edge. 
Flip
Use the Flip tool to flip a layer, selection, or path 
horizontally or vertically.
Cage 
Transform
A fun distortion tool, but one that won’t be covered 
here. It’s of little use to new and intermediate users.
Text
If you want to add text to a project, you’ll need to 
use the Text tool. The Tool Options dialog allows 
you to specify font size and family, along with 
alignment options.
Bucket Fill
Use the Bucket Fill tool to fill a portion of a layer 
with a solid color or pattern.
Blend
The Blend tool applies a smooth color transition 
(known as a gradient) to a layer or selection. Many 
stock gradients are available, and the Gradient 
Editor allows creation of custom gradients.
Pencil
Paint tools use the active brush and the current 
foreground or background color. The Pencil tool 
draws hard-edged lines that are not antialiased, 
even if the brush itself has a soft edge.
Paintbrush
Use the Paintbrush tool to draw with soft-edged 
strokes and the active brush. 
(continued)

4   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
Toolbox Icons (continued)
Tool
Function
Eraser
The Eraser tool removes pixels from almost all 
layers, leaving transparent pixels in their place. 
When applied to the Background layer, which by 
default doesn’t have an alpha channel, this tool 
will replace pixels with the background color.
Airbrush
The Airbrush tool works much like the Paintbrush 
tool, but the effect is softer.
Ink
The Ink tool is designed specifically for use 
with drawing tablets like those from Wacom. It 
responds to pressure and the tablets’ tilt features.
Clone
Cloning is the process of copying pixels from one 
region of a layer to use in another. To use the 
Clone tool, press the ctrl key and click the mouse 
to set the source point you want to clone. Then you 
can clone pixels using paint strokes. 
Heal
A tool similar to the Clone tool but that does a 
better job of merging nearby pixels. A common 
use for this tool is removing wrinkles from photos.
Perspective 
Clone
Another Clone relative, this tool can copy an area 
given a perspective area in which to clone. You 
could, for example, copy a window on a building 
to an adjacent location while retaining the per­
spective of the original window.
Blur/
Sharpen
The Blur/Sharpen tool functions like the Paintbrush 
tool and allows you to paint over a layer to sharpen 
or blur the regions under the brush.
Smudge
Imagine dragging your finger across wet paint on 
a canvas. This tool functions the same way, as you 
drag it in the image window. It’s perfect for small 
touch-ups.
Dodge/Burn Similar to the Blur/Sharpen tool, the Dodge/Burn 
tool can be used to lighten (Dodge) or darken 
(Burn) the region under the brush.
The Tool Options Dialog
The Tool Options dialog gives you 
access to the active tool’s options 
and settings. This dialog opens 
as a tab at the top of the two ini-
tial docks. Clicking the icon for 
a GIMP tool does two things: it 
activates the tool, and it displays 
the Tool Options dialog for 
that tool.
N o t e 	
As well as a Tool Options 
dialog, many toolbox tools 
are associated with an 
additional dialog. These 
dialogs give easy access 
to tool-specific features. 
Click a tool’s toolbox icon 
to access its Tool Options 
dialog. Click in the can-
vas to open the tool’s 
associated dialog or use 
the File menu to access it 
(File4Dialogs). 
Color Swatches and Tool Previews
At the bottom of the toolbox you’ll find the color swatches and the 
brush, pattern, and gradient previews. If you’ve enabled it in the 
Preferences dialog, you’ll also see the active image preview. 
In the swatches box, you’ll find the current foreground color 
(upper-left box) and the current background color (lower-right 
box). The color swatches are referenced throughout this book. 
Clicking either of these will open a dialog in which you can adjust 
the current colors. Double-clicking the foreground or background 
color box is required when the alternate box is currently active. 
For example, if the background color box is active (it appears 
behind the foreground color box in the toolbox), clicking once 
on the foreground color box makes it active, and the second click 
opens the Change Foreground Color dialog.
The Tool Options dialog for the  
Rectangle Select tool

Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques﻿   5
The Change Foreground Color dialog
The curved, doubled-ended arrow in the upper-right corner 
of the swatches box swaps the current foreground and background 
colors. Clicking the smaller boxes in the lower-left corner resets 
the foreground color to black and the background color to white. 
Pressing D in the canvas will also reset the colors, while pressing 
X will swap them.
The foreground 
 and background colors 
 
in the swatches box at the bottom of the toolbox
Brush, Pattern, and Gradient Previews
The brush, pattern, and gradi-
ent previews reflect the selection 
currently active for the Brushes, 
Patterns, and Gradients dialogs. 
Click any of these previews to 
open the associated dialog and 
change the active selection.
A gradient is a change in color, often smoothed in a way that 
simulates lighting changes or curved surfaces when applied to a 
selection. The Blend tool is often used to apply gradients. You can 
set that tool to use the current foreground and background colors, 
choose from a set of predefined gradients, or create your own.
Active Image Preview Window
As you’ll soon discover, having several image windows open at 
once can get confusing. The active image preview window lets 
you quickly activate the window of your choice. Double-click the 
preview to open a dialog to choose the active image window.
This feature is not enabled by default, so in order to use it, 
turn it on in the Preferences dialog. Choose File4Preferences in 
the toolbox and select Toolbox on the left. Then check the Show 
active image checkbox. The active image window is displayed 
here at the bottom of the toolbox.
Once you’ve enabled the active image preview in the Preferences dialog, the 
preview appears at the bottom of the toolbox. The position will be to the right 
and/or below the other previews, depending on how you change the size of 
the toolbox area.

6   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
Docking
A dock is a window that holds other windows. For example, the 
toolbox has a dock at its base. Any dialog can be made into a dock. 
To do this, drag one dialog title into another dialog to dock the 
two, resulting in a series of tabs. To detach a dialog from one dock 
and move it to another, drag the tab to a new part of the screen.
Docking windows saves screen space and reduces clutter (left). In Single-
Window mode (right), all dialogs are initially docked, but they can be moved 
to different docks at any time by dragging a tab from one dock to another.
The Image Window
In addition to the toolbox, GIMP’s other main window is the 
image window, or canvas, where your work is displayed. GIMP 
allows you to have several image windows open at once, and 
this is helpful when copying from one window and pasting 
into another.
Multi-Window mode (left) places each image in its own window. Single-
Window mode (right) adds tabs above the canvas area for each image.
Menus
All menus are in the image window. In Multi-Window mode, each 
image window has a copy of these menus. Most menu items apply 
to the image window from which the menu was opened. Some 
menus, like the File menu, apply to the entire GIMP applica-
tion. In Single-Window mode, the menu bar across the top of the 
single window applies to the active image window tab or all tabs, 
as appropriate.
The menu can be accessed in multiple ways. The first is with 
the menu bar. Another is to right-click the mouse in the canvas 
area. The last option is to use the menu button in the upper-left 
corner of the canvas. In this book the menu bar will be used, 
though advanced users should become familiar with the menu 
button, as that’s the only way to use tear-off menus. Why are 
there multiple ways to do this? Because there are times when, 
working with small images (like icons for the web or a computer 
application), you’ll need to zoom in quite a bit. If you resize the 
window to fit this, you might not have every menu option avail-
able at the top of the image window. If that happens, use the 
right-facing arrow to access the out-of-view menu options. This 
menu also provides access to tear-off menus, which allow you to 
access common menu items quickly without having to repeatedly 
traverse menus. You might use this, for example, when creating 
guides to start a project.

Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques﻿   7
The image window menus include File, Edit, Select, View, 
Image, Layer, Colors, Tools, Filters, Windows, and Help. Linux 
users may also find a Video option in the menu bar, depending 
on the manner in which their Linux distribution packaged GIMP. 
However, this option isn’t part of the base GIMP package for Win-
dows or Mac users and will not be discussed in this book. 
You’ll use features from the Edit, View, Image, Layer, Colors, 
and Filters menus throughout this book. The Select menu is also 
very useful, but you can use the mouse, the toolbox, and key­
board shortcuts to access most of its options. Don’t forget to look 
at the File menu to familiarize yourself with its Create, Save, 
Export, and Print options.
The image window menu bar in Single-Window mode (left), Multi-Window 
mode (lower middle) showing a menu posted from the menu button in the 
upper-left corner of the canvas, and a tear-off menu
Even though it’s beyond the scope of this book, you should 
know that you can create your own add-on tools that can be added 
to any menu. If you’re a programmer interested in developing tools 
for the GIMP, I suggest you review the material on the GIMP devel-
opers’ website (http://developer.gimp.org/), specifically the Plug-In 
Development section. 
Image Window Menus and Features
Menu
Feature
File
The File menu offers operations such as Open, Close, Print, 
Save, and Export.
Edit
The Edit menu gives you access to the Cut, Copy, Paste, Fill, 
and Stroke operations. Some of these operations only apply 
to selections, but others apply to the entire active layer if no 
selection is present.
Select
The Select menu offers operations that complement the toolbox 
selection tools, including All, None, Invert, and Save to Chan­
nel. Selections can also be feathered, grown, shrunk, and 
sharpened from this menu.
View
Zoom is just one of the View menu’s options. You can also use 
this menu to toggle between visibility of guides, layer bound­
aries, selections, and grids of dots. Forcing the image window 
to shrink-wrap to the zoom level of the image helps you make 
more room on the desktop when zooming out. Choose View4 
Full Screen to switch to and from full-screen mode.
Image
Operations that apply to the composite image are found here, 
including rotation transforms, canvas sizing, and merging all 
layers into a single layer.
Layer
This menu offers operations that apply specifically to layers. This 
includes layer ordering; color management for the active layer; 
and layer transforms, masks, scaling, and alignment.
Colors
Options in the menu include dialogs for adjusting brightness, 
contrast, hue, saturation, and white/black point levels. Any 
global or selection-oriented color corrections will use this menu.
Tools
The Tools menu provides access to the toolbox tools, but 
you’ll rarely use it unless you’re in full-screen mode. Selecting 
an item from this menu makes that tool active, as if you had 
clicked its icon in the toolbox.

Image Window Menus and Features (continued)
Menu
Feature
Filters
As you follow along with the tutorials in this book, you’ll 
become familiar with the Filters menu. It offers the tools you’ll 
need to manipulate images in creative ways, applying blurs, 
lighting effects, cloud renderings, and warping.
Windows
The dialog menu provides quick access to GIMP’s many 
dialogs, including the Layers, Channels, Paths, Brushes, 
Patterns, Gradients, and Document History dialogs.
Help
Context-based and programming help, along with installed or 
online help documentation, are accessed through this menu.
N o t e 	
You don’t have to use the File menu to access these options. Try 
right-clicking instead to bring up a flyout menu containing all 
of these options. It’s much faster! 
Additional Features
There are a few other image window features you should get to 
know. Each is labeled and discussed briefly here.
Additional image window features
	 Use the Quick Mask to create and modify selections. It’s dis-
cussed further in Section 1.4.
	 Use the rulers to pull out vertical and horizontal guides. Click 
one of the rulers and drag out to create a new guide, or  
create one more precisely by choosing Image4Guides4 
New Guide. Guides are like grid lines you can use to line up 
objects.
	 Panning around images is easier with the navigation control. 
Click it while viewing a large image or while zoomed in on a 
small one to see it in action.
	 The pointer coordinates display the exact location of the cur-
sor in the units (inches, pixels, etc.) you select from the drop-
down menu on the right. 
	 The zoom drop-down menu lets you quickly change the view 
of your image, but you’re usually better off using the key-
board shortcuts plus (+) and minus (–) to zoom in and out. 
Press 1 to view your image at 100 percent.
	 The status area shows useful information, including angle 
information, when you’re dragging to create straight lines.
	 You can also use the right-pointing arrow (in the upper-left 
corner of the image window) to access the image window menu. 
8 	 The image window also includes a zoom button, which is 
shaped like a magnifying glass and located in the window’s 
upper-right corner. Click this button, and then drag the win-
dow corners to resize the image. The canvas will zoom in and 
out to fit the new window size.
The Preferences Dialog
GIMP’s user interface is extremely configurable. You can change 
keyboard shortcuts used to access tools and filters, or you can 
add shortcuts to features that don’t already have them. In addi-
tion, you can change the default new image size, specify how your 
dialogs appear on startup, set your resource consumption prefer-
ences, and much more. These options and many others are acces-
sible via the Preferences dialog (File4Preferences). 

Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques﻿   9
Shortcuts
One of the best ways to save time while working in the GIMP 
is to use existing shortcuts. You can also map your own, if you 
like. Open the Preferences dialog (File4Preferences) and click 
Interface on the left. Clicking the Configure Keyboard Shortcuts 
button allows you to map commands individually. If, for example, 
you often have to blur images, you may want to map ctrl-shift-B 
to the blur command you need to apply.
Alternatively, you can map shortcuts interactively. Check the 
Use dynamic keyboard shortcuts checkbox to enable this feature. 
Then click OK to save your Preferences. 
Enabling dynamic keyboard shortcuts in the Preferences dialog
Open the Edit menu in the toolbox. Notice that the Prefer-
ences option doesn’t have a keyboard shortcut listed to the right 
of it. To add a shortcut, place the cursor over the Preferences 
option but don’t click it. Instead, press ctrl, shift, and P keys all 
at once. The Preferences dialog now has a keyboard shortcut, 
so go ahead and give it a try. Press ctrl-shift-P to return to the 
Preferences dialog. To remove a dynamic shortcut, mouse over 
the menu entry and press the backspace key. Shortcuts are huge 
time-savers, and they’re an easy way to personalize your GIMP 
experience.
In order to clarify step-by-step instructions, this book will 
focus on menu selections, not shortcuts. However, as you gain 
experience, learning to use shortcuts will improve your creative 
workflow.

Preferences dialog
Undo Levels and Other Environment Options
The Preferences dialog can also improve GIMP performance. You 
can modify features such as image cache size, number of undo 
levels, maximum memory that can be used for undo operations, 
and maximum size that can be used for image thumbnails. If 

10   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
you’ve got the memory and the inclination, feel free to push up 
these values. The most-often modified value is probably the tile 
cache size. Smaller values reduce memory usage by the GIMP 
but slow processing of large images. If you have lots of memory 
and work on large images, try increasing the value from 128MB 
to 256MB. If you’re low on memory, another option is reducing 
the undo levels. The default of five is already low, however. If you 
reduce this value to save memory, remember to save your work 
often.
Resource Folders
The Preferences dialog also allows you to configure the directo-
ries that hold files for your brushes, patterns, gradients, fonts, 
and so on. Click the arrow next to Folders to expand all resource 
folders. If you want to create your own patterns or files, you can 
use the Preferences dialog to tell GIMP where to save and look 
for those files. You can also add or remove collections of brushes 
and patterns this way.

Drawing and Painting
GIMP can be used for drawing and painting, even if it’s better 
known as a tool for editing images and photographs. The Pen-
cil, Paintbrush, Airbrush, Eraser, and Ink tools are collectively 
referred to as GIMP’s paint tools. This section of the book intro-
duces these tools to new users. The Basic Tutorials in Section 1.10 
will help you get a grasp on using these paint tools so you’ll be 
prepared to experiment with them later in the book. 
Paint Tools and Features
Before discussing each of the paint tools, let’s examine some fea-
tures they have in common.
Opacity  In the Tool Options 
dialogs for each of the paint 
tools, you can adjust the opacity 
of the brushstroke to be applied. 
Remember that opacity is the 
opposite of transparency, so 
a higher opacity value means 
the brushstroke will be less 
transparent.
Mode  All the paint tools except 
the eraser allow you to set the 
Blend mode for the brushstroke. 
The Blend mode defines how 
the stroke blends with the exist-
ing pixels in the layer where 
the stroke is applied. Different 
modes have different effects. 
Addition mode adds the brush’s 
colors to those in the image, 
causing the image to lighten. 
Multiply mode causes the image 
to darken. Overlay mode can 
either lighten or darken the 
image, depending on the color or pattern being applied and 
the existing content in the layer where the stroke is made. 
Blend modes are also used in layers. 
Modes are also used to composite layers. You’ll explore 
modes in more detail in Section 1.2. Don’t worry too much 
about them for now. While you experiment, stick with 
Normal mode.
Brush  The global brush setting is set in the Brush preview 
in the toolbox. You can also choose a brush for any of the 
paint tools from the Tool Options dialog. Except for the Ink 
tool, which uses its own brush, all the paint tools require that 
you choose a specific brush. The paint tools even remember 
brushes; you can switch from one to another and back again 
without losing your settings for either tool. The default con-
figuration is for all paint tools to share the same brush, but 
this can be changed in the Preferences dialog under Tool 
Options.
The Preferences dialog shows that brush settings are shared among  
all of the GIMP’s paint tools (the Brush checkbox is checked).
Setting the mode to Normal 
in the Paintbrush tool’s Tool 
Options dialog

12   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
As you can see here, a paint tool’s brushstroke can be 
set to fade as it is applied. The distance the stroke travels 
before the fade can also be adjusted in the Tool Options dia-
log, using Dynamics. First, set the Dynamics option to Basic 
Dynamics. Then click Dynamics Options to display the Fade 
Options and adjust the Fade Length value to determine the 
length of the stroke before the fade. Changing the Dynamics 
option to Fade Tapering will add a tapered end to the fad-
ing stroke, as shown in this example. The Ink tool is the only 
paint tool that doesn’t offer this option.
Specifying how to fade out of a brushstroke using 
the Paintbrush tool. Note that the Reverse option is 
required to fade out a stroke as opposed to fade in.
Spacing  All brushes have a Spacing setting. This value, 
measured in percentage of the brush’s width, determines 
how far apart brush images are applied during a brushstroke. 
You can use the Brush dialog to change the default spacing 
for any brush. A higher Spacing value allows you to create 
shapes like wire frames and tubing from ordinary brushes.
Now that you’re familiar with the basics, here are the GIMP 
paint tools used most often in this book’s tutorials.
The Pencil Tool
The Pencil tool applies a hard edge, which is important to remem-
ber. Making the most of the paint tools requires that you under-
stand the difference between hard and soft edges. When you 
work with soft edges, levels of gray or fading color in a brush are 
considered partially transparent and are merged with the exist-
ing pixels in the canvas. This creates soft edges around the brush-
stroke. When working with a hard edge, if a pixel in the brush­stroke 
is more than 50 percent black (or more than 50 percent colored), 
the pixel in the brushstroke replaces the pixel on the canvas, 
rather than being merged with it. If a pixel in the brushstroke is 
less than 50 percent black or colored, the pixel on the canvas is 
unchanged.
The difference is easy to see here, where both the Pencil tool 
and the Paintbrush tool are used in conjunction with the Round 
Fuzzy (101) and Pepper brushes. The Pencil tool uses a hard 
edge, so there’s no antialiasing of the brush edge, whereas the 
Paintbrush tool uses a soft edge. For this reason, you probably 
won’t use the Pencil much when working with masks or editing 
photos. 
The Pencil tool (top) and Paintbrush tool (bottom) are used to  
draw lines with the Round Fuzzy (101) and Pepper brushes.

1.1  Drawing and Painting   13
The Paintbrush Tool
Throughout the tutorials, this is the paint tool you’ll use most 
frequently. The Paintbrush tool is perfect for creating layer masks 
and creating selections by painting Quick Masks. In either case, 
the soft-edged nature of the paintbrush makes it ideal for closely 
matching curves. 
The Paintbrush tool applies its brush only once over a given 
point. That is, if the Paintbrush tool is active and you hold the 
mouse button over the canvas and click, only one brushstroke is 
applied. More brushstrokes are applied as you drag the cursor 
around the canvas.
The Airbrush Tool
The Airbrush tool is very similar to the Paintbrush tool, except 
that it applies a lighter or darker stroke, depending on the Rate 
and Flow values set in the Tool Options dialog. It also continues 
applying the brush to a single point if the cursor doesn’t move. 
For these reasons, the Airbrush tool is useful for enhancing shad-
ing and lighting in images.
The Rate and Flow values set in the Airbrush tool’s Tool Options dialog 
determine how the brushstroke will look when the tool is applied to the 
canvas. On the left is a single click. On the right, the mouse button was  
held down for three seconds.
The Eraser Tool
The Eraser tool is a soft-edged paint tool that removes pixels 
from a layer in the shape of the current brush. In all layers except 
the Background layer, the pixels are changed to transparent (or 
semi-transparent, depending on the brush used). In the Back-
ground layer, which by default doesn’t support transparency, the 
erased pixels are changed to the background color in the toolbox.
The Eraser tool removes pixels from a layer.
The Eraser tool is a destructive tool; the pixels it changes 
are gone forever once you save the file. A better way to hide those 
pixels from view is with a layer mask, which is not destructive. 
(You’ll learn a little more about layer masks and selections in Sec-
tion 1.4.) You can edit a layer mask at any time in the future to 
adjust what’s hidden. That’s impossible with the Eraser tool, so 
you won’t be using it as often.

14   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
The same effect is achieved using a layer mask, which leaves layer content 
intact so it can be reused later if necessary.
The Ink Tool
The Ink tool was specially designed for use with drawing tablets 
from manufacturers like Wacom. You can use the Ink tool’s Tool 
Options dialog to adjust the shape of the brush tip, the amount 
of tilt applied to the brushstroke, the speed at which the brush is 
moved relative to the tablet pen, and much more.
These features are quite helpful to users who do pen draw-
ings, such as manga or similar artwork. Pen drawings are not this 
author’s forte, unfortunately, so the Ink tool won’t be used in any 
of these tutorials.
Brushes 
GIMP’s stock brushes are fine for most projects, and you’ll use 
them in tutorials throughout this book. But with a little effort, 
you can greatly expand the selection of styles available. Creating 
new brushes is almost a no-brainer. Almost.
Discussed here are two types of GIMP brushes: ordinary and 
colored brushes, and parametric brushes (which are scalable and 
must be created using the Brush Editor).
N o t e 	
The easiest way to create a new brush or pattern is to use the 
clipboard. Select a small region with any selection tool and copy 
it (Edit4Copy or ctrl-C). The clipboard is shown in the very 
first box in both the Brushes and Patterns dialogs. This section 
describes how to have more control over brush creation.
Creating Ordinary and Colored Brushes
You can create your own GIMP brushes. The simplest is an ordi-
nary or colored brush, which consists of an image that you draw 
or import and save as a brush file by giving it a .gbr extension. Any 
image that can be opened in the GIMP can be saved as a brush, 
though some work better than others. Very detailed images don’t 
work well for this purpose, for example. In most cases the image 
should also be scaled down, because it will become the brush tip. 
N o t e 	
Colored brushes are just like ordinary brushes, except the 
former have color while the latter are simply levels of gray.
Ordinary brushes paint with the foreground color wherever 
there’s black in the brush image. Where black fades to white 
in the brush, the foreground color is mixed with transparency 
before being mixed with the pixels in the canvas.
To create an ordinary or colored brush, just follow these steps: 
1.	 Open a new image window by choosing File4New. Set the 
size to 25 × 25 pixels. 
2.	 If you’re creating a colored brush, you need to add an alpha 
channel to the Background layer (Layer4Transparency4Add 
Alpha Channel). If you’re creating an ordinary brush, don’t 
add the alpha channel but instead convert the image to Gray-
scale (Image4Mode4Grayscale).
3.	 Use the Paintbrush tool to paint an X shape in the canvas. 
This is painted in color if you created a colored brush, or it 
appears in grayscale if you converted the image to Grayscale 
in the previous step.

1.1  Drawing and Painting   15
4.	 Once you’ve finished creating your image, export it to a 
brush directory with a .gbr file extension. (Choose Edit4 
Preferences to open the Preferences dialog, and then look 
under Folders4Brushes for the correct path.) 
5.	 When the Export Image as Brush dialog appears, type a 
brush name into the Description field and set the Spacing 
value appropriately. A brush is like a stencil applied repeat-
edly during a brushstroke; its Spacing setting is the percent-
age of brush width from the center of one stencil application 
to the next. For most purposes you can accept the default 
spacing.
The Export Image as Brush dialog, showing a sample brush. Note the 
updated Brushes dialog, lower right, with the new brush selected.
6.	 Open the Brushes dialog (Windows4Dockable Dialogs4 
Brushes) and click Refresh to update the Brushes dialog. 
This causes GIMP to reread all available brush files, and it 
should find the one you just saved. Your new brush should 
appear in the palette along with the built-in brushes and any 
other brushes you’ve defined. Your new brush is ready to use. 
Select it and start painting.
N o t e 	
When using ordinary and colored brushes, it’s not uncommon 
to create multiple versions of a particular brush at different 
sizes. The best way to do this is to create the largest brush first, 
and then repeatedly scale down and save the image to create 
several smaller brushes.
Creating Parametric Brushes
Parametric brushes are easily modified and can be configured 
to change in a number of ways as they’re being used. Unlike 
ordinary and colored brushes, you can only create parametric 
brushes by using the Brush Editor. To open the Brush Editor, 
click the New icon in the Brushes dialog (it shows a blank sheet 
of paper). (If the Brushes dialog isn’t active, choose Windows4 
Dockable Dialogs4Brushes.)
A parametric brush applied to the canvas several times and shown in the 
Brush Editor window
The Brush Editor window allows you to set a basic brush 
shape (oval, square, or diamond) and adjust that shape several 
ways by entering values for a variety of options. The Radius is 

16   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
the size of the brush in pixels. The Spikes value is the number of 
lines that run from the center of the brush outward. These lines 
are obvious in square and diamond shapes but aren’t immediately 
visible in the oval shape until you increase the Aspect Ratio, which 
exaggerates the effect of the spikes.
The last two options in the Brush Editor are Angle and Spac-
ing. The Angle value is given in degrees and indicates how the 
spikes should be rotated around the brush center. As is true of 
other brushes, you can adjust the Spacing for parametric brushes. 
The primary usefulness of parametric brushes is that they’re 
easy to change as you work. It’s also easy to tweak a particular 
brush shape to meet very specific needs. This can’t be done with 
other brush types without opening the brush file in a canvas win-
dow, editing the brush manually, and saving it as a new brush.
Using a parametric brush to stroke a selection allows you to achieve some 
interesting effects. In each line, the Spacing value is varied.

1.2  Layers and Modes   17
1.2 
Layers and Modes
Layers in GIMP are like transparent sheets of paper piled one on 
top of another. Wherever a sheet is transparent, the sheets below it 
show through. If you lay several transparent sheets on an overhead 
projector and turn on the projector’s light, the colors in each sheet 
combine to form new colors. That’s exactly the way layers in a stack 
work: they combine to produce what you see in the canvas window. 
Changes made to layers are immediately reflected on the canvas.
Layers are the building blocks of GIMP projects because they 
allow you to build up an image one piece at a time, just as car-
toons were created by hand before computers took over. 
Layers in the Layers dialog and the combined image in the canvas window
The Layers Dialog
You can use either the Layer menu or the Layers dialog to man-
age layers.
Accessing the Layer menu from the canvas window
You can move a layer up or 
down the stack by using the arrow 
buttons 
 at the bottom of the 
Layers dialog, or you can simply 
click the layer and drag it to its 
new position. The other buttons 
at the bottom of the Layers dia-
log include the new layer button 
(single page icon 
), the create 
layer group (folder icon 
), the 
duplicate layer button (two page 
icon 
), the anchor layer button 
(anchor icon 
), and the delete 
button (an x in a red circle icon  
). Aside from the anchor layer 
button, the functions of these but-
tons are self-explanatory. 
Layers can be created, moved, 
and managed using the but- 
ton bar.

18   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
The Layers dialog folder icon was introduced in GIMP 2.8. 
This is used to create a layer group, which allows a single action to 
be performed on more than one layer at a time, such as moving or 
turning off visibility in the canvas. To create a layer group, click 
the folder icon in the Layers dialog. A layer group looks just like a 
normal layer in the dialog except for the hide button, a triangle-
shaped icon to the left of the preview that’s only available when 
one or more layers are included in the group. Clicking this but-
ton will either show or hide the layers within the group inside the 
Layers dialog. The layers within the group are included in the 
canvas window if both the group visibility and the layer visibility 
are enabled (that is, the eye icon is visible for both). 
Layers can be added to the group by dragging them in the 
Layers dialog and dropping them onto the group layer. Alterna-
tively, select the group layer first, and then create a new layer. 
Grouped layers are easier to manage in projects with large numbers of layers.
When you copy and paste something onto the canvas, GIMP 
creates a temporary layer called a f loating selection. You can anchor 
this temporary layer to the current layer (the layer that was active 
before you pasted the new selection onto the canvas), or you 
can make it a new layer. Anchoring the layer means the floating 
selection contents 
replace the existing 
layer contents wher-
ever the two overlap. 
The anchor layer but-
ton is a shortcut for 
anchoring the floating 
selection to the cur-
rent layer. Use the new 
layer button to make 
the floating selection a 
new layer instead. You 
can also use the new layer 
button to create a new 
layer from scratch.
Layers can have masks that hide parts of the layer from being 
used in the composite image displayed in the canvas. Layer masks 
will be discussed in “Using a Layer Mask to Colorize an Image” 
on page 22. All layers in the Layers dialog have a layer content 
preview. Layer masks are displayed in this dialog as a second pre-
view to the right of the layer content preview. 
A layer can be visible or hidden, depending on the state of its 
visibility icon, the eye icon in the Layers dialog that accompanies 
every layer. Clicking this icon toggles the layer’s visibility. When a 
layer is not visible, its eye icon is not displayed.
Layers don’t have to be the same size as the canvas. Layer 
boundaries can also be outside the canvas boundary. If that’s 
the case, any part of the layer extending beyond the canvas is not 
shown on the canvas. To expand a layer to match the canvas size, 
just right-click the layer in the Layers dialog and choose Layer to 
Image Size.
You can also use the Move tool to move layers around the 
canvas. If you want to move more than one layer at a time, anchor 
them together by clicking each layer’s chain link icon. Click and 
drag on the canvas to move all the layers at once. Note that with 
GIMP 2.8 and later, you can also group the layers and make the 
group layer active in order to move all the layers within the group 
at once. The chain link can now be used to group layers that are 
not in a layer group.
The Layers dialog, with a floating selection

1.2  Layers and Modes   19
Here, the Layers dialog shows a layer and its mask. The mask is indicated by 
the black-and-white preview to the right of the layer preview 
. The visibility 
icon appears on the far left 
. If the layer is hidden from view, this eye icon 
will not be visible. Just click the spot where the icon should be to bring back 
the icon and make the layer visible again.
The chain link icon links layers so they can be moved together.
You can make any layer partially opaque by choosing that 
layer and adjusting the Opacity slider in the Layers dialog. The 
setting you choose for this Opacity slider combines with any opac-
ity changes you define with a layer mask.
GIMP takes the transparent sheet metaphor a bit further, of 
course. You can use one of several methods to combine a layer 
with the layers below it. Each method is called a layer mode.
Modes are an important GIMP concept. Besides being appli-
cable to layers, they’re also applicable to the paint tools. We’ll take 
a look at paint modes before returning to layer modes, though as 
you’ll see, the two GIMP features are nearly identical.
Paint Modes
Paint modes are available for 
use with all paint tools, from 
Blend to Bucket Fill to Paint-
brush. A paint mode defines 
how the paint tool combines 
what it paints with the pixels 
already in the layer. This pro-
cess of mixing the new with 
the old is known as compositing.
A paint mode is a math-
ematical method of combin-
ing colors and transparency 
in GIMP. The idea is that 
for each color channel (red, 
green, and blue), two differ-
ent pixels are composited 
in a specified manner using 
some combination of addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and 
division. 
An important paint mode concept is that color channels only 
have 256 possible values (0 through 255, where 0 is no color and 
255 is full color in that channel). That’s because GIMP only uses 
8 bits per color channel: 8 bits = 28 = 256. And when you combine 
all three channels, you end up with 2,563 possible colors (not 
in­cluding the alpha, or transparency, channel) for any single pixel. 
With some modes, the process of adding, subtracting, and so forth 
can produce values outside this range. In that case the mode either 
clamps (forces) the value back to the minimum value (0) or maxi-
mum value (255), or it wraps around to the other side of the range.
Paint modes (highlighted in red) are 
available for use with all paint tools.

20   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
Like paint modes, layer modes define how layers are compos-
ited. The difference between paint modes and layer modes is that 
paint modes are applied as painting operations occur, so those 
changes are immediate and actually change the pixels in layers. 
Layer modes instruct GIMP how to combine a layer with the lay-
ers below it, but this compositing doesn’t actually change pixels. 
It only changes the way the canvas appears, as the layers are com-
posited internally and displayed in the image window. 
There are 23 GIMP paint modes, of which 21 can also be 
used as layer modes (the Behind and Color Erase paint modes 
cannot be used by layers). The table below lists these modes 
and briefly describes how each of them works. In this table, the 
existing pixel is the pixel (and its multiple color channels) in the 
current layer, while the new pixel is the one added by the paint 
tool. Operations performed on pixels affect each channel (red, 
green, and blue). When you study layer modes in the next sec-
tion, remember that those modes apply in the same way, except 
that the existing pixel comes from the current layer and the new 
pixel comes from the layer below it.
Paint Modes and Functions
Mode
Function
Normal
Normal mode is the default paint mode. The color of the 
new pixel added by the paint tool replaces the color of the 
existing pixel in the layer.
Dissolve
Dissolve mode works just like Normal mode, except that 
random blank areas are added to the stroke while painting. 
This is similar to dabbing paint on a canvas with the tip of a 
brush.
Behind
In layers with transparency, this mode only paints the trans­
parent areas. This results in the new pixels appearing as if 
they were applied behind the existing pixels.
Color Erase
Color Erase mode is similar to the Eraser tool, except that 
instead of erasing the complete brush shape it only erases 
pixels that are the foreground color.
Lighten Only
If the existing pixel is less than the new pixel, Lighten Only 
mode uses the new pixel.
Paint Modes and Functions (continued)
Mode
Function
Screen
Screen mode subtracts each pixel from white (255), multiplies 
the results together, subtracts that result from white again, 
and then divides by white. It clamps the color to 255. The 
resulting pixel is generally much lighter.
Dodge
This mode is similar to Screen mode. It subtracts the existing 
pixel from white, inverts the result, multiplies the result by the 
new pixel, and then multiplies by white. It clamps the color to 
255. As in Screen mode, the result is a lighter pixel.
Addition
Addition mode adds the two pixels together and clamps  
to 255.
Darken Only
If the existing pixel is greater than the new pixel, Darken 
Only mode uses the new pixel. 
Multiply
This mode multiplies the current pixel by the new pixel and 
then divides the result by white. It clamps the color to 0. The 
result is usually a darker pixel.
Burn
Burn mode subtracts the new pixel from white, multiplies the 
result by white, and then divides by the existing pixel. Then 
the result is subtracted from white again. The result tends to 
be a darker pixel.
Overlay
Overlay mode is a mixture of Multiply and Screen modes. It 
makes dark areas darker and light areas lighter.
Soft Light
Soft Light mode is another combination of Multiply and 
Screen modes that produces results similar to those of 
Overlay mode.
Hard Light
Hard Light mode tests pixels to see if they’re closer to black 
or white before choosing which operations to perform. 
It’s another mixture of Multiply and Screen modes, usually 
producing opposite results to those of Overlay mode.
Difference
This mode subtracts the existing pixel from the new pixel and 
takes the absolute value of the result. Because an absolute 
value is used, no clamping is necessary, and results often 
appear similar to color negative film.
Subtract
This mode subtracts the existing pixel from the new pixel and 
clamps to 0.

Paint Modes and Functions (continued)
Mode
Function
Grain Extract
This mode subtracts the existing pixel from the new pixel and 
adds 128. In many images, the Grain Extract mode tends to 
produce what look like inverted colors.
Grain Merge
Grain Merge mode adds the existing pixel to the new pixel 
and then subtracts 128. This generally produces richer colors 
in photographs.
Divide
This mode divides the new pixel by the existing pixel and 
then multiplies the result by white. It clamps the color to 255. 
The result is usually a lighter pixel.
Hue
Hue mode works on pixels by converting from RGB to HSV 
first, then pulling the Hue from the existing pixel and the 
Saturation and Value from the new pixel.
Saturation
Saturation mode is similar to Hue mode, except that it pulls 
the Saturation from the existing pixel and the Hue and Value 
from the new pixel.
Color
Color mode is similar to Hue mode, except that it takes the 
Saturation and Hue from the existing pixel and the Value 
from the new pixel.
Value
Value mode is also similar to Hue mode, except that it pulls 
the Value from the existing pixel and the Saturation and Hue 
from the new pixel.
Layer Modes
Using paint tools to mix pixels is an inherently destructive process, 
as painting with any mode will change the pixels in the layer. 
That isn’t always a bad thing, but what if you need to restore 
the original pixel information? Using GIMP to create art nearly 
always involves experimenting, which often means abandoning 
one set of changes, going back to the source image, and trying 
something different. What if tomorrow—after having saved and 
exited GIMP—you want to edit the image differently? Those pix-
els will have lost their original settings forever.
To keep the original pixel settings, use layer modes instead. 
A layer mode works by blending the current layer with the pixels 
in the layers below it. The method of blending is the same as 
with paint modes, except that 
layer modes combine the pixel 
values as they’re displayed on 
the canvas, without changing 
pixels in the lower layers. For 
example, using the Bucket Fill 
tool to apply a pattern and then 
switching to Hard Light layer 
mode doesn’t change any of the 
pixels below the current layer. 
The current layer can therefore 
change in any way necessary—
at any time—without losing 
pixel values for any other layer.
To set a layer mode, use 
the Layers dialog’s Mode 
drop-down menu. Aside from 
the Behind and Color Erase 
modes, all modes available for 
use as paint modes are available 
for use as layer modes. And layer 
modes can be changed at any 
time. Changing layer modes doesn’t physically change the pixels 
(it only affects how the composite image is displayed on the can-
vas), so it doesn’t use up any additional memory or consume any 
of your undo levels.
N o t e 	
The Undo command allows you to step back through your 
recent changes. You can step back as many times as you want 
until you’ve used the maximum amount of undo memory, as 
configured in the Environment section of the Preferences dialog. 
The default amount of undo memory is 16MB, which is quite 
sufficient for small images destined for the Web but probably 
insufficient for poster-sized prints. You can step back through 
your recent changes by repeatedly pressing ctrl-Z or by choosing 
Edit4Undo. You’ll know you’ve reached the maximum undo 
memory allowed if pressing ctrl-Z stops undoing your steps. 
Instead of being surprised when you reach that point while 
working on a project, you may want to increase the minimum 
undo level right away.

Using a Layer Mode to Colorize an Image
Layer modes appear in many tutorials throughout the book, 
but here’s a minitutorial to introduce you to them. Colorizing an 
image adds color wherever the target area isn’t completely black. 
In this process, the image is desaturated—all color content is 
removed—leaving behind an image still in RGB mode but only 
containing shades of gray. Only at this point do you add color. 
1.	 Open any image and start by desaturating the original layer 
(Colors4Desaturate). Click OK.
2.	 Add a new transparent layer above it by choosing Layer4 
New Layer and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. 
3.	 Click the foreground color in the toolbox to change the fore-
ground color. Choose any color you like, and then drag the 
foreground color onto the canvas to fill the new layer with 
the chosen color.
4.	 Set the mode for this layer to Color.
First, desaturate your image. Then colorize the image by adding a layer 
above the original layer, filling the new layer with color, and setting the new 
layer’s mode to Color. 
Because the color is specifically chosen in the Change Fore-
ground Color dialog, this colorization method provides more 
control than other methods. It also doesn’t wash out the image as 
much as the Colorize dialog (Colors4Colorize) does.
Using a Layer Mask to Colorize an Image
With layer modes you can selectively add color to your image by 
using the technique we just used combined with a layer mask. A 
layer mask prevents portions of a layer from showing through, so 
only certain parts of it appear in the composite image displayed 
in the canvas window. Wherever there’s white in the mask, that 
part of the layer is used in the composite image. Any black in the 
mask results in that part of the layer not being used.
A layer mask—visible to the right of the layer preview—lets us colorize the 
image. Click the mask in the Layers dialog to make the mask active. Then 
apply the paint tools to the mask to change the shape of it to suit your needs.

1.2  Layers and Modes   23
1.	 Add a layer mask to the colored layer from the previous 
example (Layer4Mask4Add Layer Mask).
2.	 When prompted, click the White (full opacity) radio button.
3.	 With the canvas selected, press D to reset the default fore-
ground and background colors. Then drag the foreground 
color (black) from the toolbox onto the canvas. This fills the 
mask with black so none of the colored layer is visible. 
4.	 Make a selection on the canvas, and then drag the back-
ground color (white) into the selection. This adds white to 
the mask inside the selected area, allowing that part of the 
colored layer to be used in the composite image displayed in 
the canvas window. 
Layer and Layer Mode Tips
By now you should be familiar with the fundamentals of layers and 
modes. Here are some tips to keep in mind as you experiment.
• 
Screen and Addition layer modes brighten images. Multiply and 
Subtract modes darken them. But Overlay mode can do both!
• 
Remember that differencing white from red gives a different 
result than subtracting white from red. Subtracting one layer 
from another will clamp the result to black. Imagine that one 
layer contains a red value of 100 and a second layer contains 
a red value of 40. Subtracting the first layer from the second 
would result in −60, but Subtract mode can’t read values 
below 0 (black). Difference mode takes the absolute value 
instead.
• 
For a cleaner effect, try using the Soft Light layer mode instead 
of the Color layer mode to colorize an image.
• 
Layer modes don’t use up memory. Switching among layer 
modes will not affect GIMP’s overall performance, so go 
ahead and experiment! (You’ll get plenty of practice with 
layer modes in the upcoming tutorials.)
• 
Be sure to give layers meaningful names. The default names 
are never descriptive enough, and it’s easy to get lost when 
working with a dozen or more layers. Just click the layer 
name in the Layers dialog and type the new, more descrip-
tive name. Press enter when you’re finished making your 
changes.
• 
There are many ways to colorize an image. One way is to use 
the Colorize tool. This is the fastest method, and the results 
will be nearly as good as if you’d used a layer mode. Open any 
image and desaturate it (Colors4Desaturate). Then open 
the Colorize dialog (Colors4Colorize) and adjust the Hue, 
Saturation, and Lightness sliders until the preview shows the 
desired result. But remember that this changes the pixels 
in the layer. To keep the pixels desaturated, add a new layer 
above the desaturated layer, fill the new layer with color, and 
use a layer mode to blend the color with the desaturated layer.
Here the Colorize tool is used to colorize an image. Unlike the Color layer 
mode, the Colorize tool actually changes the pixel content. Be certain you 
really want to make the change before using this tool.

Color Modes
When working with images, GIMP uses one of three color modes: 
RGB, Grayscale, or Indexed. Each mode represents a particular 
type of color model. Color is a very complex subject, but I’ll try to 
summarize it for you. 
A color model (the set of colors you can display) is a way of 
representing colors with a set of numbers that define the colors’ 
component parts. Different color models can map to different 
color spaces (defining the colors you see). Imagine a color space 
graph inside which you could draw a triangle. The triangle 
would be the model where each vertex is one of the three pri-
mary colors: R (red), G (green), or B (blue). According to this 
model, when R = 100, G = 100, and B = 100, you have dark gray. 
If you slide the triangle to the right, taking care to stay inside 
the graph, you still have a color model with three values at 100, 
but those values define a different color. To produce a particular 
color, you need both the color model and the color space.
N o t e 	
To be honest, color theory is much more complex than this. The 
mathematics behind it won’t be explored here, but as you’ll see, 
the general idea is important. 
There are many different color models and color spaces. 
GIMP only works within the sRGB (standard RGB) color space 
using the RGB, Grayscale, and Indexed color models. The RGB 
model is used for displaying work on the monitor because it is 
an additive model in which components are added together to 
produce a color. The monitor starts with black (0/0/0), and as 
you increase the values of each component, the screen grows 
brighter. If the full amount of each component is added, you get 
white.
GIMP’s image modes: RGB, Grayscale, and Indexed
Another well-known and popular color model is CMYK, used 
primarily for printing, which GIMP doesn’t yet directly support. In 
contrast to RGB, CMYK is a subtractive model. If equal amounts 
of C, M, Y, and K are applied, you get black. Just as when you print 
over and over on the same paper, the ink accumulates until you 
get a black smear. 
You can see why converting from one color model to another 
is a fairly complex task. You need to know a lot more than just the 
color of the pixel on your display.

1.3  Color Modes   25
RGB is the most commonly used mode for screen images, and 
it’ll be used throughout this book. The letters R, G, and B stand 
for red, green, and blue and represent the three color channels of an 
RGB image. Every pixel in an image is a composite of the pixels in 
each of the three color channels. Each channel uses 8 bits and can 
define a color by a set of integer numbers that range from 0 to 255. 
This gives you a respectable 16 million total colors to work with. 
Default color channels for an RGB image
Working in RGB mode (Image4Mode4RGB) means you can 
also use transparency. Transparency is a measure of how much 
light can pass through a given pixel. The color of a pixel appear-
ing on the canvas is the result of combining that pixel’s three 
channels and then mixing the color of the composited pixel with 
some percentage of the composited pixels beneath it in the layer 
stack. Transparency is also the opposite of opacity. If a pixel is 
30 percent transparent, it’s also 70 percent opaque.
If an RGB image has some transparency, that information is 
stored in a fourth channel, called an alpha channel. When you’re 
asked to choose Alpha to Selection or Add Alpha Channel, you’ll 
be working with the transparency information in an image or layer.
By default, transparent regions in a single layer are indicated by a checkered 
pattern. The pattern is configurable in the Preferences dialog.
Grayscale mode (Image4Mode4Grayscale), an image setting 
using a single channel with 256 levels of gray (no color), can be 
useful for some artistic projects or for black-and-white photographs 
or scans. You can easily desaturate an image by switching to Gray-
scale mode, but the channel mixer (Colors4Components4Chan-
nel Mixer) is a better choice for converting color photographs.
Indexed mode (Image4Mode4Indexed) is useful when con-
verting an RGB image to a GIF file destined for the Web. The GIF 
file format only allows for 256 colors in an image. Each image 
holds a table of index numbers, each one representing a single 
color. Only one of those index numbers can also be used to 
specify transparency. For example, if the index number specify-
ing blue is also set to specify transparency in a GIF file, when a 
program displays the image, it’ll display transparency instead of 
displaying blue. Indexed formats like GIF have only two levels of 
transparency: on and off. When using Indexed mode, there’s no 
way to specify that a pixel should be semi-transparent.

26   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
Convert Image to Indexed Colors dialog
Changing from RGB mode to Indexed mode allows you to 
choose from one of several methods of dithering, a way to group 
similar colors into a single one, thus reducing the total number 
of colors to less than or equal to 256 (the maximum number of 
colors allowed in a GIF file). Dithering is required in conversion 
from RGB mode to Indexed mode because RGB images can have 
up to 16 million colors, while Indexed images can’t have more 
than 256 colors. The colors in the image can also be mapped to 
a particular color palette. Both the color palette and method of 
dithering are selected in the Indexed Color Conversion dialog, 
which opens when you choose Image4Mode4Indexed.
The GIF format uses a single pixel for transparency, making 
it difficult to blend round edges next to transparent areas with 
anything that might be behind them. The GIF format doesn’t 
support alpha blending, a technique for mixing pixels along edges 
that requires multiple levels of transparency for individual pixels. 
In a GIF file, a pixel is either transparent or it isn’t.
A good alternative to the GIF format is the PNG format, which 
supports multiple levels of transparency for individual pixels, comes 
with fewer licensing restrictions, and is also supported by GIMP. 
For all these reasons, GIF files are quickly being replaced by PNG 
files. I recommend converting Indexed images to RGB and saving 
them as PNG files.
While many web designers are migrating from GIF to PNG 
files, older versions of Internet Explorer (IE) still do not prop-
erly display PNG files that contain varying levels of transparency.  
GIMP can correctly save an RGB image with multiple levels of 
transparency (areas that are semi-transparent and intended to 
blend with whatever background the image is positioned over). 
The issue is that older versions of Internet Explorer interpret any-
thing other than complete transparency incorrectly and display 
such images with a solid color instead. This problem has been 
corrected in more recent versions of IE.

1.4  Selections   27

Selections
Want to make the most of your GIMP experience? Master the art 
of effectively creating selections. Nothing is more important. The 
perfect selection can meld one image with another or map one 
image onto another. Or turn day into night. There’s not much 
you can do with an image editor without making selections, and 
this section focuses on learning how to select as accurately and 
efficiently as possible.
All GIMP selections are outlined by a set of moving dashes, 
known as marching ants. You can set the speed of the ants by 
choosing Edit4Preferences from the image window menu and 
clicking the Image Windows entry. If you want to toggle the visi-
bility of selections within a specific image window, choose View4 
Show Selection.
Selection Tools
GIMP offers nine different tools for creating selections: Rect-
angle Select, Ellipse Select, Free Select, Fuzzy Select, Select by 
Color, Scissors, Foreground Select, Quick Mask, and Paths. Paths 
are vector outlines that can be converted to selections. Alterna-
tively, selections can also be turned into Paths. Both options can 
be found in the Paths dialog. Quick Mask allows you to paint in 
the image window with a colored mask while it’s enabled, and 
then convert the mask to a selection when it’s turned off. Quick 
Masks will be covered in more detail later in this section.
Editing Selections
The Rectangle Select and Ellipse Select tools include interactive 
editing features. Click and drag within the image window using 
either tool. Notice that the selection is outlined with a bounding 
box. Along the edges of this box are hot spots that allow resizing 
of it, which also resizes the selection. Click and drag inside the 
bounding box to move the selection. To remove the bounding 
box, hit enter or just click once inside the selection. To get the 
bounding box back, click once inside the selection. 
Any selection can be edited with these tools, but using them 
converts the original selection, such as a free selection, into a 
rectangular or elliptical selection.
Rectangular and elliptical selections can be edited after they’ve been created. 
The corners 
 change both width and height, while the longer hot spots 
 
between corners change just width or height.
Selections can also be edited using any of the transform tools 
(Rotate, Scale, Shear, Perspective, Flip, and Cage). After creating 
a selection, choose a transform tool. Transforms can be applied 
to layers, selections, or paths. In the Tool Options dialog, click 
the Selection box to apply the transform to the selection. 

28   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
To apply a transform operation to a selection, the selection box must be set in 
the transform tool’s Tool Options dialog before performing the transformation.
Selection Constraints
All selection tools can be configured using the Tool Options dialog. 
The Rectangle Select and Ellipse Select tools can be constrained 
in several ways from this dialog. A selection constraint defines the 
shape and size of a selection. Both the Rectangle Select and Ellipse 
Select tools have an Expand from center option. An unconstrained 
selection will anchor a corner at the point of the first mouse click. 
The corner that’s anchored depends on the direction in which 
the selection is dragged. Set Expand from center in the Tool 
Options dialog to anchor the selection’s center to the initial 
mouse-click point.
Fixed is the other constraint option for these two selection 
tools. It offers four ways to constrain the selection: Aspect Ratio, 
Width, Height, and Size. Choosing any of these will change 
the input field just below the 
options menu to allow setting 
appropriate values to which the 
selection will be constrained. 
For example, selecting Size 
allows the entry of a width-by-
height value. Once this is con-
figured, click in the image win-
dow to create a selection of that 
exact size. The selection cannot 
be edited until the Fixed option 
is disabled.
Tool Options constraints 
aren’t the only way to limit selec-
tion size and shape. Guides and 
layer boundaries can also serve 
as constraint tools.
Guides  A guide is a 
horizontal or vertical line 
that doesn’t show up in 
your final image but can 
be used to align project 
elements such as layers and 
selections. You can drag 
out guides from the rulers, 
but you can only position them imprecisely that way. If you 
need to position guides at absolute pixel offsets (as you’ll 
do in several of this book’s tutorials), use one of the options 
available in the Image4Guides menu.
Layer Boundaries  Layer boundaries are indicated by yellow-
and-black dashed lines. When a layer is selected, nothing can 
be drawn beyond its layer boundary. You can easily select a 
layer’s corner: start inside the image window and drag through 
the corner you want to select and beyond the layer boundary. 
Only the portion of the selection inside the layer boundary 
will be selected. 
Constraint options in the Tool 
Options dialog are only avail-
able for the Rectangle Select 
and Ellipse Select tools. 

1.4  Selections   29
Pull horizontal guides from the top ruler or pull vertical guides from the left 
ruler. Use the Move tool to drag them out of the window one at a time or 
choose Image4Guides4Remove all Guides to remove all guides at once. The 
Image4Guides menu allows you to add guides by percent (New Guide (by 
Percent)) or by pixel offsets (New Guide). You can also wrap guides around 
an existing selection (New Guides from Selection).
You can also change the behavior of GIMP’s selection tools 
by holding down various keyboard keys. These keys are known as 
keyboard modifiers, because they modify the behavior of the active 
tool. If a keyboard modifier is pressed when you click and drag 
on the canvas to create a selection, the modifier affects the selec-
tion constraint. 
Pressing the shift key after the mouse click and holding it 
down while dragging, when using the Rectangle Select or Ellipse 
Select tool, constrains the selection so that the height and the 
width are always equal. This means rectangular selections are 
squares and elliptical selections are circles. But this is only true 
if you release the mouse button before you release the keyboard 
modifier. If you release the shift key first, the constraint is 
removed.
A yellow-and-black dashed line indicates the layer boundary. 
If part of a selection lies outside a layer’s boundaries, that 
portion is not actually selected.
As mentioned previously, an unconstrained selection will 
anchor its left side at the point of the first mouse click. To anchor 
from the center of the selection, click first, press the ctrl key, and 
then drag the selection. As with the shift key, the mouse button 
must be released first to maintain the constraint.
Using keyboard modifiers with selections is an advanced tech-
nique not well suited to tutorials. Therefore, this book usually ref-
erences Tool Options settings when configuring selection tools.
Selection Modes
While selection constraints set the size and shape of a ­selection, 
selection modes combine two or more selections, regardless of 
the constraints applied to each. It’s often necessary to make sev-
eral selections and then combine them in different ways. Such 
merged selections are useful, for example, when selecting unusu-
ally shaped objects in a photograph or when outlining a shape 
before filling it with a color or pattern.

30   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
To combine selections, use the mode buttons in the selection 
tools’ Tool Options dialogs. In order from left to right, Replace 
mode creates a new selection that replaces any existing selections, 
Add mode adds the new selection to the existing one, Subtract 
mode subtracts from the existing selection wherever the new 
selection overlaps it, and Intersect mode creates a selection only 
where the new and existing selections overlap. If there’s no exist-
ing selection, Replace and Add modes simply create the new 
selection by itself and Subtract and Intersect modes do nothing.
The mode buttons in the Tool Options dialog also map to 
keyboard modifiers. Holding down the shift key while dragging 
activates the Add mode, while holding down the ctrl key while 
dragging activates the Subtract mode. Holding down both keys 
while dragging activates the Intersect mode. These keyboard 
modifiers apply to all selection tools except Foreground Select. 
Note that as long as you hold down these keys, the associated 
mode button is selected in the Tool Options dialog. If there’s no 
initial selection, the modifiers have no effect, and the Replace 
mode button stays active.
N o t e 	
The Foreground Select tool maps these keys to other options in 
the Tool Options dialog.
When using the various selection tool modes, the cursor 
changes depending on which mode is active, as shown here. 
With experience, you will learn 
to recognize these cursors, but if 
you’re new to GIMP, you’ll want to 
keep an eye on the Tool Options 
dialog when working with selections. 
When working with keyboard modi-
fiers, it’s very easy to confuse the 
mode you’re in with the constraint 
you may (or may not) be trying to 
apply to a new selection. As with 
selection constraints, the tutorials in 
this book will always reference the 
mode settings in the Tool Options 
dialog, not the keyboard modifiers.
Oddly Shaped Selections
When working with photographs or any existing digital image, 
you seldom need a perfectly rectangular or oval selection. 
Instead, you need to outline odd shapes with odd selections. 
When these shapes have complicated edges, often your only 
option is to draw the selection by hand. In GIMP, you can use 
the Free Select tool for this.
The Free Select Tool
To make a freehand selection, choose the Free Select tool from 
the toolbox, click the canvas, and drag around the shape you 
want to select. As you drag, a solid line appears, showing the edge 
of your selection. When you’re done outlining the selection, hit 
enter. The solid line is replaced by the familiar marching ants. 
You can use keyboard modifiers 
to constrain selection shapes. 
You can also apply transforms to 
selections using the Tool Options 
dialog for each transform tool.
Each selection tool’s Tool 
Options dialog gives you 
access to four mode buttons: 
Replace, Add, Subtract, and 
Intersect.
The cursor changes, depend-
ing on which mode is active.

1.4  Selections   31
Using the Free Select tool to make a freehand selection
To close a Free Select loop, just drag back to the starting 
point and look for a small yellow circle. This signifies the two 
endpoints are overlapping and the selection loop will be closed. 
Hand-drawn outlines aren’t always the easiest way to make a 
selection. Fortunately, GIMP offers a wealth of alternatives. If the 
portion of the image you want to select is outlined by a solid color 
or other obvious edges, the toolbox provides the Fuzzy Select, 
Select by Color, Scissors, and Foreground Select tools. 
The Fuzzy Select Tool
The Fuzzy Select tool works best when a solid color surrounds the 
object of interest. 
The Fuzzy Select tool allows you to select the beans and their shadows by 
simply clicking the white area that surrounds them.
The most important option in the Fuzzy Select tool’s Tool 
Options dialog is the Threshold setting. Lower Threshold values 
mean fewer pixels are selected. The threshold can be adjusted by 
moving the mouse while keeping the left mouse button pressed. 
Keep in mind that when you click the canvas using the Fuzzy 
Select tool, all pixels within the distance specified (a difference 
in color) and adjacent to each other are added to the selection. 
It’s important to remember that the pixels must be adjacent. 
Notice that the Fuzzy Select tool always creates one large selec-
tion. It’ll be oddly shaped, but there’ll be just one. The Select by 
Color tool, on the other hand, creates many selections.
There are several alternatives 
to the Free Select tool, among 
them the Fuzzy Select, Select 
by Color, Scissors, and Fore-
ground Select tools.

32   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
The Select by Color Tool
The Select by Color tool is best at pulling a shape from an image 
based on groups of pixels that aren’t necessarily adjacent to each 
other. Its Tool Options dialog also offers a Threshold setting that 
functions just like the Fuzzy Select tool’s Threshold setting: it 
selects all pixels within range of the threshold. When using the 
Select by Color tool, however, the pixels do not have to be adja-
cent. Therefore, this tool can potentially create thousands of 
small, independent selections. In this example, because the white 
background contrasts so much with the beans and their shadows, 
the Select by Color tool creates only one selection. Using a low 
Threshold setting and clicking the white background creates a 
selection nearly identical to the Fuzzy Select’s. 
Both the Select by Color and the Fuzzy Select tools can make 
very precise selections, as long as the contrast between the object 
of interest and the rest of the image is high. For situations where 
that isn’t the case, you’re better off using either the Scissors or 
Foreground Select tools. 
The Scissors Tool
Use the Scissors tool when you need to get down and dirty; it 
finds the edges of an object by noting dramatic color changes 
near a line you draw with mouse clicks. 
To create a selection with the Scissors tool, click the canvas 
to drop anchor points around the object of interest. The anchor 
points are also referred to as control points or nodes, and the Scis-
sors tool’s anchor points are similar to those of the Paths tool. 
As you drop anchors, GIMP draws a solid line connecting each 
new anchor to the previous anchors. GIMP computes these lines 
based on changes in color. In this example, the beans and their 
shadows have distinct color differences, so clicking near the edge 
of the bean creates an outline around just the bean, exclud-
ing its shadow. To close the outline, click the first anchor you 
dropped. Then click inside the outline to convert the area to a 
selection.
You can edit the outline before converting it to a selection 
by clicking any existing anchor point and dragging it to a new 
location. You can even add new anchor points by clicking a line 
between any two existing anchor points. Adding new anchors and 
moving existing anchors lets you tweak your outline before con-
verting it to a selection. This might be necessary if you find that 
GIMP’s chosen dividing line doesn’t suit your needs.
Clicking along the edges of the shadows sets anchor points automatically 
connected to wavy lines that’ll become the selection when the loop is closed. 
Scissors could be used to outline the beans (sans shadows) to make a finer-
grained selection, though for this particular image it would probably be 
easier to use Fuzzy Select and increase the Threshold setting.
The Foreground Select Tool
The Foreground Select tool is more complicated than the tools 
discussed so far, but with practice it can become the best tool 
for isolating foreground shapes over cluttered backgrounds. 
Foreground Select uses a multi-step process to specify an object 
in an image as the foreground. After you choose the tool from 
the toolbox, the lasso pointer is displayed in the image window. 
Drag the lasso around the foreground object to create a rough 
selection. After outlining the object, press enter to complete 

1.4  Selections   33
the first step. By default, the masked area (which is not in the 
selection) will be highlighted in blue, though this color can be 
changed in the Tool Options dialog. 
The second step is to paint over the foreground object. The 
current foreground color is used in this step along with a round 
brush. Hold down the left mouse button and paint near the edges 
and across any dramatic color changes (dark to light or light to 
dark) inside the foreground object. The object doesn’t have to be 
completely painted over. When the mouse button is released, the 
Foreground Select tool will update the masked area based on the 
pixels that were painted over and the current masked area.
Repeated brushstrokes can be used to refine the selection. 
The Tool Options dialog allows setting brush size to select conti­
guous regions or adjustment of color sensitivity. When ­editing is 
complete, press enter to convert the unmasked area to a selection. 
The Foreground Select tool can be very precise when isolat-
ing objects in an image. However, in practice this tool does best 
at creating rough selections that need further refining with the 
Quick Mask (described in “Using the Quick Mask” on page 34).
Foreground Select is faster and more accurate than Scissors, but it often 
requires touch up via Quick Mask.
Creating Masks from Selections
Sometimes a project requires you to isolate an object in an image 
in order to create a mask of that object. Often this object is not 
easy to select by itself, but the area around it is. 
Look at this rose set against a white background. It’s easy to 
isolate the white area with the Select by Color or Fuzzy Select 
tools. Once the selection is made, invert it (Select4Invert) to cre-
ate a selection that only includes the flower. Then all you need to 
do is create a black mask and fill it with white.
To create a mask of the rose, choose the solid white background, invert 
the selection, add a black layer mask, and fill the selection with white.
Feathering Selections
Creating a selection to isolate an object in a photograph sometimes 
requires a little more work. You may need to feather the selection. 
When creating a selection, GIMP offers the use of antialiasing. 
If antialiasing isn’t used, GIMP either includes a pixel or doesn’t 
include it in the selection; there are no partially selected pixels. 

34   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
Zooming in on the rose selection without (left) and with (right) antialiasing 
enabled
Feathering a selection softens its edge by allowing pixels to 
be partially selected. This means that some pixels are actually 
partially transparent, so when you copy and paste the selection, 
its edge blends more easily with its new surroundings. 
Feathered selections (right) have soft edges, allowing them to blend into 
the background when copied and pasted into another image.
You can use the Feather Selection dialog (Select4Feather) 
to feather a selection you’ve created. By default, the feathering 
depth is set in pixels, but you can choose several other units 
from the drop-down menu in the dialog. The feathering process 
straddles this range on either 
side of the selection, one half 
outside the selection and the 
other half inside. The inner-
most edge of this range is fully 
opaque, while the outermost 
edge is fully transparent. As 
you move from the inner-
most to the outermost edges 
of the feathered range, the 
pixels become increasingly 
transparent. 
A feathered range is split to straddle the selection boundary. This feathered 
selection is 6 pixels: 3 to the outside and 3 to the inside of the selection.
Using the Quick Mask
The Fuzzy Select tool works well with images like the rose, where 
the subject appears against a solid background. But there’s an 
even more intuitive way to make selections of oddly shaped objects, 
The Feather Selection dialog lets you 
specify the feathering depth in one 
of several units.

which can be especially handy when the background isn’t solid. 
Quick Mask allows you to paint over an image to create your 
selection.
To use Quick Mask, click the Quick Mask button in the 
lower-left corner of the image window. Doing so gives the image 
a red tint. Choose any paint tool and any brush. Set the fore-
ground color to white by pressing D and then X while the canvas 
is selected. Start painting with your chosen paint tool and brush, 
rubbing away the red in the Quick Mask. Click the Quick Mask 
button again when you’ve uncovered the area you want to select. 
Where you remove the Quick Mask, the painted area is converted 
into a selection. It doesn’t get any easier than that!
Quick Mask 
buttons
The Quick Mask button is in the lower-left corner of the canvas 
window. When not in use, the button’s icon is a square selection 
symbol. When you click the Quick Mask button, the icon becomes 
a red square, and all areas outside existing selections are tinted red 
(unless you’ve changed the default mask color).
The original yellow car is in the upper left. In the lower left, the Quick Mask is 
turned on and the image is tinted red. In the upper right, the yellow body of the 
car has been painted with white and the mask color changed to dark green for 
better contrast. Clicking the Quick Mask button again converts the painted 
area into a selection and allows us to change the color of the car’s body.
Discarding Selections
What do you do after you’re done with your selections? You can 
save a selection to a channel by choosing Select4Save to Channel, or 
you can discard the selection. Choosing Select4None will discard 
the current selection. Alternatively, you can press ctrl-shift-A. 

36   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
Saving a selection to a 
channel allows you to retrieve 
the selection from the Channels 
dialog later (Windows4Dock-
able Dialogs4Channels). Sim-
ply click the saved channel to 
make it active, and then click 
the Channel to Selection but-
ton at the bottom of the dialog. 
We’ll use this process a few 
times in various tutorials later 
in this book.
Working with Selections
Once you have a good selection, you can do just about anything 
with it. You can fill it with color by simply dragging the foreground 
or background colors from the toolbox into the selection. You 
can use any of the paint tools inside the selection without worry-
ing about painting outside the selection area. 
Drag the foreground or background colors from the toolbox into any 
selection to fill it with color.
Paint in the selection without worrying about affecting anything beyond it.
You can also use selections to isolate regions where filters can 
be applied. For example, you can apply a motion blur to the rose 
selection without blurring anything that lies beyond it.
Blur the selection without worrying about blurring anything beyond it.
The Channel to Selection button is 
the red square in the lower right.

1.4  Selections   37
You can also use any paint tool in combination with the fore-
ground color to trace a selection. Tracing a selection in this 
manner is known as stroking the selection, and the Stroke Selection 
dialog is available by choosing Edit4Stroke Selection.
Stroking the rose selection with a soft-edged brush
Selection Tips
Keep these hints in mind as you practice working with selections:
• 
If you have trouble remembering how the shift and ctrl key-
board modifiers work, remember that it’s easier to use the 
mode buttons in the selection tools’ Tool Options dialog to 
specify how you want the new selection to interact with the 
existing one. You can set the aspect ratio in the same dialog, 
so you can just forget about the shift and ctrl keys.
• 
You can combine Quick Masks with existing selections. Any 
existing selections won’t have the red tint when you click the 
Quick Mask button for the first time. Paint as necessary, and 
then click the button again to combine the selections.
• 
It’s not uncommon for users to find that they can’t create a 
new selection, having forgotten that they chose Subtract or 
Intersect mode in a selection tool’s Tool Options dialog. If 
this happens to you, just check the Tool Options dialog and 
make sure the mode is set to Replace. Using the mode buttons 
sets a selection tool to that mode until you change it manu-
ally. That’s one reason why experienced users learn to use the 
keyboard modifiers. The modifiers only apply for the time it 
takes to make a new selection.

Paths
GIMP is a raster image editor. Translated into plain English, that 
means it works great on photographs by changing the colors of 
individual pixels. It wasn’t initially designed for editing lines or 
geometric shapes as is a dedicated vector-graphics editor (such 
as Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape). Of course, vector editors 
don’t do as well dealing with pixels in photographs. But in today’s 
world, the line between raster image editors and vector editors 
is blurred, since graphics programs written for one type of edit-
ing often offer some level of support for the other. GIMP is no 
exception.
GIMP’s vector editing is handled with paths. A path consists 
of at least two points separated by a straight or curved line. The 
points are known as anchors, or sometimes as control points. The 
lines and their anchors are technically known as Bézier curves 
in honor of the French engineer who popularized their use in 
designing cars. The lines between anchors can be curved by drag-
ging handles out from the anchors. Each anchor has two handles, 
each associated with either the line coming into or out of the 
anchor.
The Paths tool in the toolbox is the primary method of creat-
ing paths, though they can also be created by converting a selec-
tion to a path. The Tool Options dialog is used to set the editing 
mode for a path. Design mode is used to drop and position new 
anchors. The mouse cursor changes in the image window when 
positioned over an anchor or not. Edit mode allows adding new 
anchors between two existing anchors, splitting the line between 
them. Anchors can also be deleted using this mode, by holding 
down the shift key. Move mode is used to move the entire path 
with all anchors at the same time.
The Tool Options dialog for Paths provides multiple modes for working with 
anchors and their handles. It can also be used to create a selection from the 
path or outline the path in the current layer.
Paths are grouped in two ways. First, the path exists as a whole, 
including all of its anchors. To see this for yourself, choose Move 
in the Paths dialog, click any point not on a line in the path, and 
then drag the mouse. The entire path will move. Second, all the 
anchors on each line are connected. Click any line and drag; 
you’ll see that the connected points move. Text can be converted 
into a path, but disconnected paths aren’t grouped when this is 
done. Notice that when you move some paths in an e or a that’s 
been converted to a path, the internal portions of those letters 
don’t move.

1.5  Paths   39
Disconnected paths move independently.
Paths are created on their own layers in the Paths dialog. Path 
layers can be given names and reordered just like image layers. 
However, path layers aren’t associated with specific image layers. 
A single path layer can be applied to any number of image layers 
and can contain a single path or multiple, disconnected paths. 
The Paths dialog allows an existing path to be edited later. 
First, choose the Path tool. Then click your desired path layer in 
the Paths dialog, click the visibility icon to show the path in the 
image window, and click the path in the image window to start 
editing. When editing is complete, turn off the visibility of the 
path layer. 
Paths are either open or closed. A closed path connects 
the last control point to the first. This can only be done in Edit 
mode. Click the last anchor, and then click the first anchor to 
close the path.
Like its cousin, the Layers dialog, the Paths dialog uses an eye icon to 
represent a visible path layer.
Paths can be converted to selections. Create the path, and 
then click the Path to Selection button at the bottom of the Paths 
dialog. All selections are closed, which means when the ­selection 
is created, the first and last anchors are connected via the selec-
tion even if the path itself is not closed. A selection can also be 
converted to a path. Create the selection, and then click Selection 
to Path at the bottom of the Paths dialog, just to the right of the 
Path to Selection button. One of the hidden GIMP dialogs can 
be found here. After creating the selection, hold down the shift 
key and click the Selection to Path button. This opens a dialog of 
advanced options for converting the selection to a path. 
Most transform tools (Rotate, Scale, Shear, Perspective, and 
Flip—but not Cage) can be applied to paths. After creating a 
path, turn on its visibility in the Paths layer dialog. Then choose 
the transform tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options dia-
log, there’s a line of Affect icons at the top. Click the Path icon at 

40   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
the end of that line. Click in the image window to open the trans-
form editor and modify the path. Path layers can be linked in the 
Paths dialog so that transformations apply to all linked path lay-
ers, even if the path isn’t visible in the image window.
Paths can be duplicated 
 and stroked 
 as 
well as converted to selections 
. Selections, in 
turn, can be converted to paths 
. This can be 
useful for creating logos, manga, or comics.
N O T E 	
It is important to note, especially with respect to scaling a 
path, that transforming paths applies to an entire path layer. 
If a path is to be scaled up a large amount, zoom out of the 
image window first, click in it to open the transform editor, 
and perform that transformation on the path.
Paths are visible but not rendered (that is, drawn or applied) 
in the image window. They must be stroked or converted to a 
selection to be applied to the image window. To stroke the path, 
select a path layer in the Paths dialog. Then either select Edit4 
Stroke Path or click the Stroke button at the bottom of the Paths 
dialog, to the right of the Selection to Path button. The Stroke 
Path dialog will open. The path can be stroked with a solid line 
or pattern using a specified width or style, or it can be stroked 
using the currently active brush and one of the available paint tools. 
Paths are useful for creating designs that need to be rendered 
at different sizes, such as logos or comics. They’re designed to 
provide scalable shapes within GIMP, where scaling of layers would 
normally affect the quality of the image.
Paths are an advanced topic and, as such, won’t be covered by 
the tutorials in this book.

1.6  Drawing Basic Shapes   41
1.6 
Drawing Basic Shapes
The most common question new GIMP users ask is, “How do I 
create basic shapes?” In this section you’ll explore two methods: 
stroking selections and using the Gfig plug-in.
Stroking selections to draw simple shapes 
Drawing a Straight Line
Straight lines are easy. Choose any drawing tool and click once 
in the canvas to start the line. Hold the shift key down and move 
the cursor to the end point and click again. To constrain the line 
to multiples of 7.5 degree angles, hold down the ctrl key with the 
shift key.
Drawing Simple Shapes
If the shapes you need to draw are relatively simple, your best bet 
is to stroke selections.
1.	 Choose the Rectangle Select tool or the Ellipse Select 
tool from the toolbox, and then drag to create a selection. 
Press the shift key as you drag to constrain the selection so its 
width and height are equal (producing a perfect square or 
circle), and then release the shift key to create the selection.
2.	 Select the Round (101) brush from the Brushes dialog. 
Choose the Paintbrush tool and set the size to 2.00 in the 
Tool Options dialog.
3.	 Choose Edit4Stroke Selection and in the Stroke Selection 
dialog, click the Stroke with a paint tool radio button. Select 
Paintbrush from the Paint Tool drop-down menu. This gives 
the selection nice, clean edges.
4.	 Click Stroke to stroke the selection.
Triangles require a little special handling.
1.	 Configure the image grid (Image4Configure Grid). For 
this 800 × 600 image, a grid with spacing of 100 pixels in 
width by 100 pixels in height is used.
2.	 Choose the Paths tool from the toolbox, and then click any 
three intersections of the grid lines to mark the vertices of 
the triangle.
3.	 In the Tool Options dialog, click the Stroke Path button. 
This will draw the shape.

42   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
N o t e 	
If the triangle needs to be rotated, choose Selection from Path 
instead of Stroke Path, then rotate the selection and stroke it 
with Edit4Stroke Selection.
Use a grid or guides with paths to draw a triangle. 
Drawing Irregular Shapes
Creating closed irregular shapes can be simple, or it can be com­
plicated, depending on the project. The easy way to create such 
shapes is to subtract from and add to existing selections. For 
example, start by creating a rectangular selection. Then hold 
down the ctrl key to subtract from the existing selection, or 
hold down the shift key to add to the existing selection. As an 
alternative, you could also use the selection tool’s Tool Options 
dialog, clicking the appropriate mode buttons instead. 
The mode buttons in the selection tools’ Tool 
Options dialogs let you combine selections 
in various ways before stroking them.
Using the Paths tool to create irregular selections is more dif-
ficult than simply adding to and subtracting from selections, but 
it’s also more accurate. Pull out horizontal and vertical guides 
that intersect where the vertices of your irregular shape should 
be, and then use the Paths tool to outline the shape. Stroke the 
path or convert it to a selection, and then fill as desired. This 
method works well when you need to isolate multiple buildings 
in a photo.

1.6  Drawing Basic Shapes   43
Outlining a shape with the Paths tool
Drawing Predefined Shapes
Gfig is a primitive vector-drawing tool that offers a set of predefined 
shapes, including stars, spirals, curves, polygons, and arcs. For 
simple shapes like squares and triangles, it’s faster to use the 
techniques we discussed earlier in this section, but Gfig can come 
in handy when you need to create something more complex. Go 
ahead and experiment a bit with it:
1.	 Add a new layer to the image (Layer4New Layer).
2.	 Open Gfig (Filters4Render4Gfig).
3.	 Click the Create Star button on the button bar. Change the 
Sides setting to 5 sides.
4.	 Click the middle of the preview and drag toward the lower-
right corner of the preview. The star will be created using the 
brush that’s currently selected.
5.	 If you need to move the star once it’s been created, click the 
Move an Object button (three buttons to the right of the 
star), and then drag the star around the preview.
6.	 Modify the brush and fill options as necessary, and then click 
Close to render your shape on the canvas.
Before you render them on the canvas, the objects you create 
in Gfig are in vector format and have a stacking order. You can 
use Gfig to change this order, or you can render each shape on a 
new layer and change the stacking order later by moving around 
the layers in the Layers dialog.
You can use Gfig to edit shapes you’ve rendered to layers, even 
after you’ve applied effects to those layers. Those effects will be 
lost when you use Gfig to edit the shapes, however, so plan your 
workflow carefully.
Gfig allows editing of shapes within a Gfig layer until effects  
are applied to that layer.

44   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
The problem with Gfig is that it’s a very simple vector editor. 
A regular polygon created with Gfig, for example, doesn’t have 
editable points at its vertices. You can only move the center point 
or resize the polygon. And brush selection is limited to selection 
of the brush, not its size, opacity, or other settings found in other 
paint tool options. Finally, Gfig isn’t the most stable GIMP plug-
in either. It has a tendency to crash if you try to create a lot of 
objects or edit objects repeatedly. 
If you need real vector-editing capabilities, you’re better off 
using a tool like Inkscape (http://www.inkscape.org/). Just create 
the shape and then export it as a PNG or SVG for use in your 
GIMP project.
Basic Shape Tips
Here are a few words of wisdom you should take away from this 
section.
• 
By default, selections want to attach to guides! As you’ve seen, 
this simplifies tasks like outlining a city skyline. But you can 
disable this behavior if necessary; just toggle View4Snap to 
Guides.
• 
Want to rotate a shape? Use the Rotate tool on a selection or 
path. Alternatively you can rotate the layer after the shape is 
rendered.
• 
Draw shapes in new, transparent layers instead of drawing 
over existing layer content. It’s always easier to delete a layer 
later than to recover pixels that have been overwritten. Be 
sure the Lock Alpha Channel option is turned off for the 
transparent layer. If you don’t, you won’t be able to draw over 
the transparent parts of the image.
The Lock Alpha Channel (known in pre-
vious versions as Keep Transparency) 
option is located in the Layers dialog. If 
the box is checked, you won’t be able 
to make changes to the transparent 
parts of the layer.
• 
Stroking with a brush that’s 1 pixel wide and the default 
foreground color (black) won’t produce a solid black ­outline 
because of the antialiasing of the brushstroke. Just repeat the 
process once or twice to get a darker line. Larger brushes don’t 
have this problem. Or, create a selection like a square or cir-
cle, fill it with a color, shrink the selection (Select4Shrink) 
by 1 pixel, and then delete it. This will produce a very clean 
1-pixel-wide outline of the shape.
• 
Don’t forget that you can fill a selection with a pattern or solid 
color instead of stroking it. Use the Bucket Fill tool for pat-
terns, or drag the foreground or background color from the 
toolbox into the selection to fill the selection with a solid color.

1.7  Patterns and Gradients   45
1.7 
Patterns and Gradients
Patterns are image files you can use to fill selections or layers. They 
are most commonly used to create textures for three-dimensional 
objects like castle walls or a scaly creature’s skin. Gradients are 
formed when two or more colors blend together. You can use gra-
dients for a variety of purposes, from simulating tubes, pipes, and 
poles to applying wave distortions to cloth or water.
GIMP provides a wide range of stock patterns and gradients. 
Most of the stock patterns are suitable for Web images but are 
probably too small for larger print projects. The stock gradients 
are plentiful, and you’ll use several of them in tutorials later in 
this book.
This section is an introduction to creating your own patterns 
and gradients. You won’t be creating any for this book’s tutori-
als, but learning how to do so is useful for when you strike out on 
your own.
Patterns
Patterns, like brushes, can be made from any image. A pattern 
that’s designed correctly is tileable—many copies of the pattern 
blend together seamlessly. Tiled patterns are often used as back-
ground images for web pages and textures for three-dimensional 
projects.
You can access the Patterns dialog and see all the patterns 
available to you by choosing Windows4Dockable Dialogs4Patterns. 
Any image can be saved as a pattern, and a pattern can be any 
size. Patterns can be saved in any file format. The GIMP-specific 
extension is .pat, but there’s no advantage to using one file format 
over another.
If you want to access a pattern file through the Patterns dia-
log, it must be saved in one of GIMP’s pattern directories (choose 
Edit4Preferences and select Folders4Patterns on the left). 
If a pattern is large, the Patterns dialog will only display a 
thumbnail of the image. Click the pattern and hold down the left 
mouse button to view it at full size. 
New GIMP users often underestimate the usefulness of pat-
terns. And to be honest, the built-in patterns are a little boring. 
But it isn’t difficult to create reusable patterns that simulate the 
textures of concrete and cloth. It just takes a little imagination.
The Patterns dialog displays thumbnails of uniform size, 
but if you click a thumbnail and hold down the left mouse 
button, the thumbnail will enlarge.

46   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
N o t e 	
Patterns don’t have to come from the Patterns dialog. GIMP’s 
render filters (Filter4Render) also make very good patterns, 
and you can save the resulting images as pattern files for use 
in project after project. The tutorials in this book often ask you 
to generate patterns on the fly, but it’s good to know there are so 
many options.
Concrete Texture
One of the easiest textures to create is a simple concrete back-
ground. Such textures can be used to turn a basic box into a 
cement block or to turn any flat surface into a sidewalk or road. 
Now you can walk through the steps:
1.	 Open a new white canvas window by choosing File4New 
from the image window menu.
2.	 Add a transparent layer (Layer4New Layer) and use the 
Plasma filter to fill it with colored clouds (Filters4Render4 
Clouds4Plasma). The default settings should be sufficient 
for this texture. Click OK to apply the filter.
Use the Plasma filter to add clouds to the canvas.
3.	 Choose Filters4Noise4RGB Noise from the canvas menu 
to use the RGB Noise filter to apply some noise to this image. 
Make sure the Correlated noise and Independent RGB check-
boxes are not checked. Set the Red, Green, and Blue sliders 
to 0.20 to apply a visible but not overwhelming amount of 
noise to the layer. Click OK to apply the filter.
Add noise to the clouds. More noise gives the image a rougher texture.
4.	 Desaturate the layer (Colors4Desaturate) using any of the 
available options. This removes the color content and makes 
the image look more like concrete. Click OK.
5.	 To give the texture some depth, open the Bump Map filter 
(Filters4Map4Bump Map). Keep an eye on the preview 
window as you play with the Azimuth, Elevation, and Depth 
values. Pan around the preview to see how each adjustment 
affects the image. Choosing Linear, Spherical, or Sinusoidal 
from the Map type drop-down menu also alters the effect, 
but this setting is less important than the others. Click OK  
to apply the filter to the desaturated layer. 
N o t e 	
Variations on this technique include using different noise 
filters and increasing the Turbulence setting in the Plasma 
filter’s Tool Options dialog. 

1.7  Patterns and Gradients   47
The concrete texture gets some depth from the Bump Map filter.
6.	 While the result is a fairly realistic concrete texture, adjust-
ments to the contrast and brightness (Colors4Brightness-
Contrast) can soften the effect and give you a jumping-off 
point for even more complex textures like skin. 
Contrast and colorization changes can turn concrete into skin. 
Simulated Cloth
Creating a cloth texture starts with noise. Start with a new white 
canvas window of 300 × 300 pixels. Because you’ll soon be rotat-
ing one of the layers, a square image works best.
1.	 Open the RGB Noise filter again (Filters4Noise4RGB 
Noise), but this time increase the Red, Green, and Blue val-
ues to 0.90. Click OK to apply this filter.
A cloth texture starts with random noise.
2.	 Open the Motion Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Motion Blur). 
Set the Blur Type to Linear, the Length to 130 pixels or more, 
and the Angle to 0 degrees. Click OK to apply this filter layer.
3.	 Repeat the previous step, this time setting the Angle to 
180 degrees. This cleans up the edges of the layer.
4.	 Duplicate the Background layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer). 
The duplicate layer will become the new active layer.
5.	 In the Layers dialog (Windows4Dockable Dialogs4Layers) 
change the duplicate layer’s mode to Multiply. This composites 
the two layers in such a way that the image appears darker.

48   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
Motion-blurred noise makes soft lines in the image.
6.	 Rotate the duplicate layer by 90 degrees (Layer4Transform4 
Rotate 90° clockwise).
The cloth has a cross-weave texture (contrast enhanced to be visible in print).
7.	
You can now flatten the image (Image4Flatten Image) and 
colorize it as you like.
Adding color to the cloth is easy with the Colorize dialog.
Creating Tileable Patterns
To create a tileable pattern, offset an image by one-half of its 
width and height by choosing Layer4Transform4Offset and 
clicking the Offset by x/2, y/2 button. Click Offset. Use the 
Clone tool to patch the seams as shown here. To use the Clone 
tool, first press the ctrl key, and then click the source location 
(which can be in any layer). The Clone tool works by taking a 
source copy of the image at one point (where you’ve clicked while 
pressing ctrl) and copying it to some other destination location 
in the image. The copy is in the shape of the active brush. When 
you click a destination location, hold down the left mouse but-
ton, and drag, the source is copied to the destination. Addition-
ally, the angle and distance between the destination and source 
remain constant, which means the source location changes as 
you drag. Take a moment to play with the Clone tool, as it’s one 
of the most powerful GIMP tools.

1.7  Patterns and Gradients   49
You don’t have to use the Clone tool to create tileable pat-
terns. The Tileable Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Tileable Blur) and 
the Make Seamless filter (Filters4Map4Make Seamless) work 
more quickly but give you less precise results. 
The Layer Offset dialog allows you to automatically offset the layer by one-
half of its width and height.
The Clone tool’s default settings are shown in the Tool Options dialog. The 
Clone tool can be used to remove a tear in an old photo.
Gradients
Gradient files are different from pattern and brush files in that 
they don’t contain image data. Instead, they’re text files that 
describe how color should be applied across a range of pixels. The 
gradient preview in the Gradients dialog (Windows4Dockable 
Dialogs4Gradients) shows you how the colors would be blended 
if you chose a Linear Shape, but the preview shows only the defi-
nition of the gradient. You can use the Blend tool to apply the gra-
dient in many different ways.
Choosing a different gradient updates both the Gradients dialog and the Tool 
Options dialog for the Blend tool. You can also select gradients directly from 
the Gradient menu in the Tool Options dialog for the Blend tool.
N o t e 	
Keep in mind that the terms gradient and blend are often 
used interchangeably.
Using the Shape Setting with Gradients
The Blend tool’s Tool Options dialog includes an important 
feature: the Shape setting. The Shape drop-down menu allows 
you to define the direction and shape the gradient takes when 

50   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
applied to a layer, mask, or selection. You’ll use Linear, Bi-linear, 
and Radial in this book’s tutorials. Choosing Linear applies a 
smooth gradient that starts where you press the left mouse button 
and begin dragging and ends where you release the mouse but-
ton. The Bi-linear effect is similar, but it resembles applying two 
brushes at the same time, each of which moves in the opposite 
direction. Choosing Radial applies the color to the left side of the 
gradient at the start point and radiates the color out to the point 
where you stop dragging and release the mouse button. 
Choosing Linear (top), Bi-linear (middle), and Radial (bottom) from the Shape 
drop-down menu produces very different results, even when you apply the 
same FG to BG gradient.
A gradient is a color transition. Most of the gradients in this 
book are made up of smooth, gradual color transitions. But the 
transition doesn’t have to be slow and smooth. It can be abrupt. 
Consider the Radial Eyeball Blue gradient. When you choose Lin-
ear from the Shape drop-down menu and apply this gradient, the 
effect is an abrupt change from white to blue to black. But when 
you choose Radial and apply the same gradient, the result looks 
like an eyeball.

The Radial Eyeball Blue gradient applied with a Radial Shape over a  
black background—now you know how this gradient got its name!
Experimenting is the only way you’ll discover all of the ways 
your projects can benefit from gradients. You can choose Radial 
from the Shape drop-down menu and use the FG to BG (RGB)

gradient to create balls or spheres. Choosing Linear and using 
the Blinds or Crown Molding gradients can simulate undulating 
waves when used in layers below a color layer.
Applying the Blinds (top) and Crown Molding (bottom) gradients  
directly to a layer without blending them with other layers
The Crown Molding gradient is applied with a Bi-linear Shape in a  
layer beneath a colored layer. The layer’s mode is set to Multiply. 
So why use gradients? In this book we use them primarily for 
two reasons: to create layer masks and to apply textures to other 
layers. Applying a gradient to a layer mask can create a smooth 
transition from the image in one layer to the image in the layer 
below it. After applying a gradient in a layer by itself, you can also 
use one of the layer modes to blend it with another layer. This lat-
ter method is used when creating wave patterns, though you can 
also use it to blend colors in a pattern.

Using the Gradient Editor
While you won’t need to do so for any of the tutorials in this book, 
it’s possible to create your own gradients. At the bottom of the 
Gradients dialog is a set of icons. Click the second icon from the 
left 
 to open the Gradient editor and create a new gradient.

52   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
The Gradient Editor allows you to edit existing gradients, such 
as the Caribbean Blues gradient shown here. Use the Edit button 
in the Gradients dialog to open the Gradient Editor.
Below the preview win-
dow in the Gradient Editor 
window is a set of triangles. 
These are handles. There are 
two black handles on either 
end of a segment and a white 
handle between them. Initially 
there’s only one segment in 
the preview. Right-click this 
segment to open the Gradient 
Editor menu. In this menu 
you can set the colors for each 
side of a segment (Right and 
Left Endpoint ­colors), add new 
segments (Split and Replicate 
menu options), and adjust 
the way color flows across the 
segment (Blending menu 
options).
Right-click the segment to open the Gradient Editor menu.
Now you can play around with creating gradients for your 
own projects. Just remember that you can create as many gradi-
ents as you like and then use the Gradients dialog to delete them 
when you don’t need them anymore. Go ahead and experiment. 
You’ve got nothing to lose!
Pattern and Gradient Design Tips
Think you’ve got a handle on patterns and gradients? Here are 
some tips:
• 
You can use patterns to stroke selections. Make a selection, 
choose Edit4Stroke Selection, and then choose the pattern 
option in the Stroke Selection dialog. 
The Gradient Editor’s default settings 
are shown here. Note the segment 
with two black handles and one white 
handle.

1.7  Patterns and Gradients   53
• 
Besides using patterns to fill your layers and selections, you 
can use them as the source image for a bump map. Fill one 
layer with the pattern, and then apply the Bump Map filter 
(Filters4Map4Bump Map) to another layer by using the first 
layer as the bump map image.
• 
Sometimes a pattern is very small when compared to a canvas. 
Applying the texture to the canvas gives you several tiled ver-
sions of the pattern. Want to scale a pattern to fit the canvas 
without tiling it over an entire layer? Make a small selection, 
fill it with the pattern, copy and paste the selection as a new 
layer, and then scale the layer to the size of the image.
• 
You can use the Bucket Fill tool’s modes to blend patterns 
with existing layer content. But an even better, nondestructive 
method is to fill a layer directly above the target layer with 
the pattern, and then set the layer blend mode accordingly. 
(See Section 1.2 to learn more.)
Using a pattern as the source image for a bump map
• 
As you’ll see in later chapters when making balls and buttons, 
gradients are often used to simulate lighting because they 
can represent gradual changes from dark to light. However, 
the appearance of a smooth gradient can be lost if you save it 
in the wrong file format. GIF files, for example, are not well 
suited for images with gradients, because the GIF format 
reduces the number of colors and can cause banding (streaks 
of colors). If you’re saving your gradient image for use on the 
Web, try using the JPEG format instead and use little to no 
compression.
• 
When using gradients to create spheres, always have the 
gradient flow from a lighter color on the left to a darker one 
on the right. In the Tool Options dialog for the Blend tool, 
check to make sure the Gradient option shows it this way. If 
this isn’t the case, try clicking the Reverse button just to the 
right of the Gradient option.

Working with Text
The first edition of this book often used multiple layers to create 
multi-line offset text. This technique was required because GIMP’s 
text-editing capabilities were somewhat limited. While the usual 
font selection, size, and even letter spacing were available, it wasn’t 
possible to have a single layer with text containing different font 
settings.
All that changes with GIMP 2.8. An on-canvas editing box 
allows you to set font characteristics for individual text letters, words, 
and phrases, including positioning relative to other text in the 
same layer. This means a single layer can now hold an entire text 
project, a process you’ll be able to try for yourself in Section 3.5.
Creating Text
Click the Text tool in the toolbox, and then click and drag in the 
canvas to open an editing box. This box, also called a bounding box 
or text frame, will stretch to fit any text you type. But it can also 
have its size fixed by setting the Box value in the Tool Options 
dialog to Fixed. A fixed width can be used to wrap paragraphs 
without newlines within the bounds of a layer. The default setting, 
Dynamic, allows the box to grow to fit text added to the frame.
Above the editing box is the Style Editor. This has two rows 
of options used to change font characteristics of any text selected 
in the editing box. This includes the font, font size, baseline, and 
kerning features. See how this works with the following example.
1.	 Open a new canvas, using the default size. Choose the Text 
tool from the toolbox. 
2.	 Click and drag in the canvas to create the editing box and 
open the Style Editor.
3.	 Type the phrase GIMP is cool in the editing box. Select the 
word GIMP.
The editing box has handles on the corner and along the edges to allow 
dynamic resizing while editing is still in progress. Note the Box option in the 
Tool Options for fixing the editing box size. Clicking on a handle will resize 
the box to fit the current text.
4.	 In the far-left field in the first row of the Style Editor, type 
a few letters of the name of any font known to exist on your 
system, such as Sans Serif or Times. A list of matching font 
names is displayed below this field. Select a font from this list.
5.	 In field to the right of this, type a number (or use the mouse 
scroll wheel) to change the font size.
At this point the selected font should be different from that 
of the rest of the phrase. The Style Editor can be used to change 
the color of the selected word, or another selection can be made 
to apply different settings.

1.8  Working with Text   55
Selected text in the editing box is yellow and, depending on the Style Editor 
settings, may not always align properly with the text.
The Style Editor can be used to change most of the same 
options available in the Tool Options dialog. However, line spac-
ing can only be changed in the Tool Options dialog and is always 
applied to all lines in the editing box, even if they’re not currently 
selected.
The first row of options in the Style Editor is for font 
, font 
size 
, and unit of font size 
. The second row provides 
font styles (bold, italic, etc. 
), baseline position 
, letter 
kerning 
, and color options 
. The far-left button in the 
second row can be used to remove text that is currently 
selected in the editing box. 
Changes to the baseline cause space to be added below the 
selected text. This feature is useful if you create an oversized first 
letter or word on a line and want to raise the rest of the letters to 
the top edge of the first letter. Kerning adjustments are used to 
adjust the spacing between letters in the selected text.
All but the letters in the first word are selected, and the baseline value 
is increased to align the tops of those letters with the first word. Kerning is 
increased to spread the letters to fit the width of the box.
The Tool Options Dialog
The Tool Options dialog offers some features that are also in the 
Style Editor. The Tool Options affect all text in a text layer that 
hasn’t been changed using the Style Editor. For example, chang-
ing the font in the Tool Options dialog will change the font for 
all text in the previous example except the word GIMP. The same 
is true for font size and color. 
Certain options are only available in the Tool Options dialog. 
This includes features such as antialiasing, hinting, and justifica-
tion. Changes to these options affect all text in the editing box.

56   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
Tool Options can be used to make global 
changes to text in a layer, unless the text has 
been previously edited with the Style Editor.
The Text Editor
Before the editing box, GIMP provided text-editing features in 
a dialog called the Text Editor. This dialog works just like the in-
canvas editing box, with the added benefit of having an icon at 
the top for loading files (the editing box requires use of the con-
text menu). Changes to the Text Editor are reflected immediately 
in the editing box. 
To open the Text Editor, click Use Editor in the Tool Options 
dialog. To close the editor, click its Close button or uncheck the 
Text Editor option in the Tool Options dialog.
The original Text Editor dialog is still avail-
able and offers WYSIWYG previews out-
side the canvas. Whether you use the 
Text Editor dialog or the editing box is 
currently a personal choice, though the 
Text Editor can sometimes behave poorly 
when you try to change font types or sizes.
Text, Paths, and the Context Menu
Text can be aligned with a path, creating text that flows along a 
curve or box. This feature can be hard to find. When editing text 
in the canvas, right-click the text to bring up the context menu. 
Select the Text along Path option. This converts the letters in 
the text layer to a series of paths shaped like the letters and flows 
those paths so the middles of the letters align with the currently 
active path in the Paths dialog. To move the text farther down 
the path, add a few spaces to the front of the text.

1.8  Working with Text   57
These outlines are paths generated from the text layer using the context menu. 
Aligning text along a curve may require adding spaces to the front of the text 
and/or adjusting the letter spacing in either the Tool Options dialog or the 
Style Editor.
Since the text is now a series of paths, you’ll need to convert 
them to a selection and fill that with color to get the letters back.
The Path from Text option is similar to Text along Path, except 
the paths created are in the same position as the original text.
Text Tips
• 
If loading a file into the editing box, first set the box to Fixed 
in the Tool Options dialog. If you don’t, lines from the file with-
out carriage returns will flow out to the right in one long line.
• 
Use baseline adjustments to align multi-sized text on a single 
line. Use line-spacing adjustments to align text on multiple 
lines.
• 
Covert text to paths to make it easier to scale up a logo design. 
Paths are vector objects, and making them larger doesn’t 
affect their quality, while enlarging rendered text will cause 
jagged edges. You could just increase font sizes in the text 
layer, but if you have many font types and sizes, you may find 
it easier to scale a path version of the text and then fill in 
appropriate colors.
• 
New fonts can be added to GIMP by installing to any direc-
tory and then updating the Font folder in the Preferences 
dialog. Changes to the font configuration require a restart 
of GIMP.
The Fonts folder allows you to add new fonts to GIMP.

Digital Cameras
If you’ve graduated from flatbed scanners, then you’re ready for 
digital cameras. Digital cameras provide you with a simplified 
method of acquiring images for use in GIMP. You no longer need 
to worry about converting from film to digital files but instead 
can work with digital files directly. No more boxes of prints and 
negatives. The digital life is much easier.
Yet with new technology comes new processes. Scanners are 
typically connected using USB. Digital cameras use solid state 
devices (SSD) like flash memory cards. While scanners don’t 
know anything about the camera that took the image, digital 
images contain metadata to help with mapping colors from one 
device to another. There is new software to consider, as well as 
new issues with the files you load into GIMP. 
Cameras today generate images that are GIMP ready by stor-
ing digital image files on a memory card. Many phones have inte­
grated cameras that can produce high-quality images. To get 
these images on your computer, remove the card from the camera 
(don’t forget to charge the battery while you have your camera 
open) and insert it into an appropriate slot in your computer 
or USB card reader. On most computers, the card will be auto-
matically detected, and an appropriate program for organizing 
your digital files will open. On Linux you can choose from Shot­
well, F-Spot, digiKam, Darktable, and others. There are a many 
options available for Mac OS X and Windows users. Copy the 
files onto your hard disk using your own personal organizational 
method, such as one folder per day or one folder per event. 
If you still use film or have old images that you want to pro-
cess, you’ll need a flatbed scanner to get them into GIMP. Scan-
ning is not difficult on Mac and Windows systems but can be 
more involved under Linux. Once the scanner is connected to 
your system, experimentation is key. Getting a good scan can take 
a lot of practice. 
A Digital Camera Primer 
Most modern digital cameras provide very high-resolution 
­photographs. The number of megapixels combined with 
the aspect ratio determines the actual size of the photograph. 
A 4 × 3 aspect ratio on a camera with 12-megapixel resolution 
­produces photos roughly 4000 × 3000 pixels. At 250 dpi, these 
would print at 16 × 12 inches, significantly larger than the old 
3 × 5-inch prints you got from the local supermarket photo booth. 
(Changing the aspect ratio is easy using GIMP’s crop tool, so it 
doesn’t really matter what ratio your camera provides.) 
Multimedia cards come in many forms, though most 
digital cameras can be accessed directly using a 
simple USB cable.
N o t e 	
Linux users: if the multimedia card is not automatically 
mounted, look for a device with a name similar to /dev/
mmcblk0 and try mounting that manually. 

1.9  Digital Cameras   59
File Formats 
Now that you can access the files on the camera, you should know 
a little something about them. First and foremost: file formats. 
All digital cameras support JPEG-formatted files. Since it’s a lossy 
format, it’s not ideal for image-editing processes. JPEG images 
are compressed by an algorithm that takes human visual percep-
tion into account. It removes a lot of the details that you can’t 
see. For example, our eyes can’t differentiate among unlimited 
shades of blue in the sky, so the compression algorithm reduces 
these shades to a lower number. But when you later change the 
color of the sky in GIMP to get a more dramatic image, you’ll get 
bands of uniform color where a gradient should be.
If you want to process your JPEG images in GIMP, you should 
set your camera to neutral colors, low compression (or larger file 
size), and low sharpening and noise reduction. Your images will 
look bland and boring out of camera, but these settings will pro-
vide you more options when editing in GIMP.
Some cameras support the TIFF format, a lossless format that 
can also be compressed. What’s the difference? A lossless format 
doesn’t lose any image information when compressed, so opening 
a compressed TIFF image will restore the original image. The 
same is not true of uncompressing a compressed JPEG image.
But neither of these formats comes close to the image quality 
you get from the native file format for the camera. The general 
term for this format is RAW, but RAW formats are camera specific. 
They have file extensions like NEF, CR2, RAF, and more. Only 
high-end cameras are able to export the RAW file to memory 
cards. Consumer-grade cameras store it only in the camera’s 
memory until they have processed the image. 
Since most cameras have low processing power, they use less 
sophisticated software to process from RAW to JPEG than tools 
for your desktop computer. This processing from RAW format 
may include destructive processes you’d rather apply manually, if 
at all. These may include effects like noise reduction, color cor-
rection, or sharpening. So working with RAW is generally consid-
ered the only way to go for professionals—even a “lossless” TIFF 
will have been processed by your camera. 
That said, getting RAW images is not always easy. GIMP’s 
plug-in (UFRaw, itself based on the dcraw software) for process-
ing these images doesn’t actually retrieve the images from the 
camera. Additionally, RAW files are larger than their JPEG or 
TIFF counterparts and generally require more memory and bet-
ter processors. This is why the average desktop consumer might 
be better suited to using JPEG images, especially if your camera 
can set the amount of compression used on those photos. Again, 
JPEG is not completely ideal, but for lower-end consumer-grade 
cameras, it may be your only option without modifying your cam-
era’s firmware.
N o t e 	
Information on using UFRaw and dcraw, along with the 
cameras they support and options for modifying camera 
firmware, can be found at the appropriate websites:
UFRaw  http://ufraw.sourceforge.net/
dcraw  http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/
Camera Metadata: EXIF
Once imported, files can be opened directly by GIMP. Most 
cameras will record some level of textual information about 
photographs in the image files. This is usually done as EXIF 
(Exchangeable Image File) format metadata. Alternative meta-
data formats include XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform) and 
IPTC (International Press Telecommunications Council), with 
XMP being the standard toward which camera makers are headed.
Access to photo metadata in the EXIF and XMP formats is 
provided by the Image Properties dialog (File4Properties) in the 
Advanced tab, which allows viewing and editing of the metadata. 
EXIF data is saved by default when saving to GIMP’s native XCF 
format and to JPEG files, but the resolution may change to match 
the default setting in the GIMP preferences. EXIF data may not 
be saved to other file formats, since they do not all support it.
N o t e 	
Support for EXIF data in GIMP is only available if GIMP 
was built with the required libraries. If you don’t have the 
File4Properties menu option, then your version of GIMP 
doesn’t support EXIF data.

60   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
The Image Properties dialog of a Canon PowerShot JPEG includes a large 
amount of information related to how the photograph was taken. 
GIMP Photo Processing 
While there are other tools for viewing camera images, GIMP is 
ideal for photo processing when you need to manually color cor-
rect an image, blend images together, or perform complex opera-
tions like depth of field or color swapping. Take a look at these 
basic operations as performed in GIMP. 
Color enhancement is a common requirement for digital 
photographs. The problem in this example is the poor lighting 
on the subject at the time the photograph was taken. In the origi-
nal photograph the color is somewhat washed out. Running this 
through F-Spot’s color correction produces an improved image, 
but GIMP produces the most accurate color. In both cases various 
levels and saturation were adjusted, but in GIMP an additional 
step through the Channel Mixer produces the best results.
Original
F-Spot
GIMP
F-Spot does a good job of color-correcting the washed-out image, but even 
better results come from the plethora of color-correcting tools available 
with GIMP. 
Image alignment is necessary when the subject of a photo is 
angled from the (possibly imaginary) line of horizon. Rotation is 
required to align the image, but rotation of a rectangular image 
will produce a larger image with some areas filled with the back-
ground color (or transparency). Alignment therefore requires 
two steps: rotation and cropping. 
Rotation in GIMP has improved with the addition of a live 
preview shown in the image window. In this image the building is 
at an angle. You can straighten this by placing a horizontal guide 
so it touches the higher end of the roofline on the left side of the 
image, using the Measure tool to determine a rotation angle, and 
then using the Rotate tool to make the roofline parallel to the 
guide. After rotating, the image includes transparency at the cor-
ners that must be cropped out.
Red eye is now directly supported by GIMP filters. In this 
image the camera flash has reflected off the backs of the eyes, 
causing the pupils to appear red. Make a selection around the 
eyes using the Free Select tool, being careful not to include any 
of the skin (which also has a red tint to it). Then open the Red 
Eye Removal filter (Filters4Enhance4Red Eye Removal). The 
default settings work well for this image, so you don’t need to 
make any additional adjustments. 

1.9  Digital Cameras   61
Transparency is automatically filled in by GIMP (checkered area, upper-
left corner of image) after rotating areas where no pixels remain from the 
original image. 
Red eye is caused by light reflected from the back of the eye through a 
pupil. It’s a common problem for casual photographers, but easily remedied 
with GIMP. 
Digital Camera Tips 
• 
Linux users: the most recent, updated releases of Linux dis-
tributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE, and Debian 
should have good support for card readers.
• 
Flash media can be slow to access, so your best bet is to sim-
ply copy the files off the media to a local hard drive before 
working with the photos.

Basic Tutorials
If you’re new to the GIMP, the best way to get started is to famil-
iarize yourself with some common processes that you can apply 
to different projects. These tutorials aren’t as detailed as the ones 
in the rest of the book, but they’ll help you master techniques 
applicable to all kinds of designs. If you can’t find all the menu 
items or dialogs mentioned here, don’t fret. These are just quick 
tutorials. The tutorials throughout the rest of the book will walk 
you through the processes in greater detail.
Clouds
Some of the most artistic GIMP effects involve merging layers in 
random ways. A grunge image, for example, might mix several 
textured layers resembling a collage of torn pages. Creating the 
texture in each layer is an artistic experiment in itself. But how 
do you then tear the layers? It’s easier than you might think. You 
just apply a layer mask filled with random shapes to each layer. 
The layer masks block out sections of the layers, making it look 
as though they’ve been torn away. 
What kinds of random shapes work well as layer masks? You 
can use brushes to draw in layer masks and produce customized 
results. But the process is often time-consuming, and it’s difficult 
to achieve random shapes with similar brushstrokes. You need 
something fast that gives more randomness than hand-brushed 
strokes ever would. Like clouds.
Clouds are very effective graphic design tools. While creat-
ing grungy textures might not be your thing, you can simulate 
increased depth of field in any design project by applying a cloud 
as a layer mask and then using it to create selective blurs. As 
you’ve already seen, you can also use clouds as the starting point 
for various textures, including skin and cloth. And, of course, 
clouds can be used simply as clouds, to create everything from 
wispy cigarette smoke, to light steam rising over a cup of coffee, 
to those big white balls of cotton in the sky.
GIMP provides four filters for creating clouds: Difference 
Clouds, Fog, Plasma, and Solid Noise. While you can use each 
filter on its own to create interesting cloud shapes, you may find 
that combining any two or more results in more realistic effects.
The Plasma Filter
The Plasma filter (Filters4Render4Clouds4Plasma) produces a 
colored smoke screen. Most of the tutorials in this book involving 
clouds use the Plasma filter, precisely because it provides random 
noise. In many of these tutorials, you’ll apply the Plasma filter to 
a layer mask. 
The Plasma filter dialog and the colored cloud the filter renders. As with most 
filters, the Preview in the dialog matches the shape of the layer or selection 
where the filter is applied.

1.10  Basic Tutorials   63
The initial application of the filter won’t resemble a cloud, 
however.
1.	 To remedy this, first desaturate the layer (Colors4Desatu-
rate). Choose any option from the Desaturate dialog and 
click OK.
2.	 Adjust the curves to increase the black space (Colors4 
Curves). The curves adjustment is a curve initially shown 
as a diagonal line. Click the line near its middle and drag 
down to increase the layer’s black content. You can also 
click other sections of the line, dragging down for more 
black or up for more white. In this example, one section of 
the line (left of center) was dragged down, while another 
section (right of center) was dragged up.
At this point, the desaturated plasma cloud looks a bit like fog at night.
3.	 Add a new layer (Layer4New) and move it below the plasma 
layer in the Layers dialog. 
4.	 Fill the new layer with sky blue and then change the layer 
mode of the plasma layer to Screen. This creates wispy clouds 
that can be manipulated for other cloud effects. 
Adjust the Curves dialog at two points. Dragging the curve down makes gray 
more black, while dragging it up turns grays into white.
Lowering the Plasma filter’s Turbulence setting produces more 
uniform cloud coverage, resulting in something that looks more 
like fog than clouds. Increasing this setting is useful for achieving 
more complex effects, like simulating fire (see Section 4.12).
The Solid Noise Filter
Clouds in the sky often have a little more puff to them, like cotton 
balls. The Solid Noise filter helps create more substantial clouds. 
1.	 Start with a sky-blue Background layer. 
2.	 Add a new layer and apply the Solid Noise filter (Filters4 
Render4Clouds4Solid Noise), using a low X size value 
(about 1.0) and higher Y size value (about 4.0) to stretch 
the clouds horizontally. Click OK.

64   Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques
3.	 Adjust the curves to increase the black area of the cloud 
layer. Set this layer mode to Screen. Duplicate the layer to 
emphasize the effect. 
The Solid Noise filter produces wispy clouds.
Difference Clouds
When you use the Difference Clouds filter, you’ll see the Solid 
Noise dialog show up instead. This is because Solid Noise forms 
the basis for the Difference Clouds filter. The only difference 
between the two is that Difference Clouds applies Solid Noise to 
a new layer just above the active layer, changes the layer mode for 
the new one to Difference, and merges it with the active one.
Fog
The Fog filter is actually a Python script that allows you to apply 
color to a desaturated Plasma filter. It also allows you to automati-
cally name the fog layer, which the Plasma filter does not. It’s 
basically a convenience filter that allows you to perform the mul-
tiple steps you’d normally do with Plasma using just a single filter.
Combining the Filters
While the solid noise effect is good, it could be better.
1.	 Add a desaturated Plasma cloud layer with its layer mode set 
to Screen above these layers to add some random wisps to 
the clouds. 
2.	 Add a white layer mask to the Plasma layer. Then copy and 
paste a Solid Noise layer into the mask by choosing Edit4 
Copy, Edit4Paste, then Layer4Anchor.
3.	 Adjust the layer mask’s curves to increase the white content. 
As a result, the cloud patterns should appear fluffier.
Apply the Plasma filter in addition to the Solid Noise filter to give otherwise 
smooth clouds a cottony appearance.
Creating a Steam Effect
To create steam such as might rise from a cup of coffee, first use 
the Solid Noise filter to create puffy vertical clouds.
1.	
Choose Filters4Render4Clouds4Solid Noise, set the Y size 
to 1.0 and the X size to 4.0, and click OK to apply the filter.

2.	 Add a white layer mask to the cloud layer (Layer4Mask4

ground and background colors.
3.	 Choose the Blend tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog set the Shape to Bi-linear and the mode to Multiply, 
and then drag from the image’s middle to its right edge. 
4.	 Drag again, from the near-left edge to the left edge, then from 
the near-right edge to the right edge.
5.	 Apply the layer mask (Layer4Mask4Apply Layer Mask).
6.	 Copy and paste the noise layer into an image of a coffee cup 
(available from an online stock image archive). Name the 
layer Steam. 
7.	
Use the Move tool to position the wisps of steam over the cup. 
8.	 Use the Scale tool to adjust the size of the Steam layer as 
needed. Use Distort filters (Filters4Distorts) such as Ripple 
or IWarp to create waves in the steam.
9.	 Add a layer mask to the Steam layer to mask out steam over-
lapping the outside of the cup.
10.	 Set the layer mode for the Steam layer to Screen or Grain 
Merge.
Using a Bi-linear gradient in the layer mask isolates a scant few hori-
zontal streaks (shown here with a black background to make them more 
visible after applying the layer mask)

Cloud Tips
These suggestions will help you take your cloud effects to the 
next level:
• 
Use the IWarp filter (Filters4Distorts4IWarp) to add swirls 
to your smoke and clouds. This filter provides more control 
over the swirls’ location than the Whirl and Pinch filter 
(Filters4Distorts4Whirl and Pinch).
• 
When the wisps of smoke you’ve created are drowned out 
by light or busy backgrounds, duplicate the smoke layers. Set 
the layer modes for those layers to Screen, Addition, or Grain 
Merge.
• 
You can apply most GIMP filters to both layers and layer 
masks. Before rendering a cloud, make sure to click the 
appropriate thumbnail in the Layers dialog!
Rips and Cracks
Rip effects are popular, but they’re often difficult for new GIMP 
users to reproduce. The technique is actually very simple and 
amounts to nothing more than careful use of layer masks and 
selections. A similar process adds cracks (or other patterns) to an 
image. Again, layer masks make it all possible. 
Ripping an Image’s Edges 
Start by creating the colored background layer that will show 
through the ripped edges. Open the image you want to use to 
practice ripping (this tutorial uses a colorful beach photograph). 
This process works for images of any size, but start by practicing 
on a small image no larger than 500 × 800 pixels. 
1.	 Add an alpha channel to the Background layer (Layer4 
Transparency4Add Alpha Channel).
2.	 Add a new layer (Layer4New Layer), fill it with white, and 
then move the colored layer below the Background layer in 
the Layers dialog.
Move the colored layer below the one containing the photograph. The color 
will show through where the edges of the photograph are “ripped.”
3.	 Add a white layer mask to the original image layer (Layer4 
Mask4Add Layer Mask).
4.	 Create a rectangular selection of the entire image layer by 
choosing Layer4Transparency4Alpha to Selection. This 
instructs GIMP to select all the opaque pixels in the image. 
Because this image is entirely opaque, this operation selects 
the whole image. (Pressing ctrl-A also works.)
5.	 Shrink your selection (Select4Shrink) by 135 pixels. Round 
the corners of the selection (Select4Rounded Rectangle) by 
35 percent. This creates a boundary area of the photograph 
that remains unchanged when you create the layer mask.
6.	 Feather the selection (Select4Feather) by 32 pixels. This 
allows the rips to meld with the image. 
7.	
Invert the selection (Select4Invert) to isolate the area where 
the rips are applied.

1.10  Basic Tutorials   67
The amounts necessary for the Shrink and Feather operations depend on 
the size of your original image. Smaller images will need smaller Shrink and 
Feather amounts.
8.	 Type D in the canvas to reset the foreground and back-
ground colors.
9.	 Click the layer mask for the original image layer in the Layers 
dialog to make it active. Fill the selection with black by drag-
ging the background color from the toolbox into the canvas.
10.	 Use the Paintbrush tool and select a brush to paint with 
black in the layer mask. (The Galaxy (AP) brush works well: 
move the Spacing slider to 60.0 pixels for an image of this 
size and adjust the size of the brush in the Tool Options as 
necessary.) Paint with various-sized brushes along the inside 
edges of the selection, focusing less on them and more on 
the edges of the image.
Because you’re working on a layer mask and not modifying 
the actual image, feel free to experiment. Try using a different 
brush along the outer edges of the layer mask to change the 
shape of the ripped edge.
The edges of the original photograph appear ripped.
Ripping Tips 
Think rips might be just what your project needs? Here are a few 
more tips:
• 
To get the right effect, you need the right brush. If GIMP’s 
stock brushes don’t suit your needs, consider creating a few 
new ones. The process is described in Section 1.1.
• 
Want to use layer masks to create text effects? The quickest 
way is to choose Layer4Transparency4Alpha to Selection 
to select the area around the text for use as a layer mask 
region. Fill the layer mask with a grungy, scratched texture. 
Then invert the text selection and fill it with white. This only 
applies the effects inside the text area.

Ph o t og r a ph ic  E f f ec t s
As a raster image editor, GIMP loves to play with points of color, 
both individually and in blocks and blobs grouped together in 
selections. This makes the program perfect for working with 
photographs. Both your digital camera and GIMP work with pix-
els, so no data conversion is required. The days of scanning your 
photos are a thing of the past.
Now that your images are in digital format, there’s no end 
to the magic you can perform. Going from average photos to 
studio-quality productions requires just a few techniques that any-
one can learn to use. Many techniques are based on simple color 
corrections like those provided by the Curves, Levels, and Color 
Balance tools.
In addition, you can use various GIMP filters to enhance 
photographs. The Retinex tool (Colors4Retinex), for example, 
normalizes colors in order to enhance focus. Originally pro-
duced by NASA’s Langley Research Center to enhance images 
taken through smoke and haze, this filter has interesting possi-
bilities for portrait enhancement.

70   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
Setting a steep curve increases color contrast, while  
changing the color balance maintains the color contrast.
This levels histogram shows that the  
darkest pixels aren’t completely black.  
Moving the left and right sliders toward  
the middle produces the dramatic lighting  
change shown here.
The following tutorials describe techniques that photogra-
phers will find useful. Along the way you’ll create vignettes, add 
focal blurs, adjust color, insert lighting, simulate depth of field 
and motion, and use cloning methods to clean up damaged pho-
tos. Unlike previous tutorials, these won’t start with a blank can-
vas at the default dimensions and walk you step-by-step through a 
repeatable process. Instead, I’ll start with a few basic images and 
apply standard processes that you can use with your own images. 
The Retinex filter produces a sharper image than the  
desaturated original (upper left). Applying the Colorize  
tool and the Filter Pack filter produces further variations.
We’re not all professional photographers or graphic artists. 
You may not have $5,000 digital cameras or fancy studios, but you 
do have access to many of the same digital effects professionals 
use: selections, blurs, masks, and layer modes. Taken by them-
selves these don’t seem like powerful tools. But when you apply 
them to your own photographic masterpieces, they become the 
tools of a new graphic artist—you.

2.1  Soft Focus   71
2.1 
Soft Focus
The soft-focus technique has long been used to soften hard edges 
between shadows and light, allowing a foreground image to fade 
into the background. This is especially true for studio portraits, 
where backgrounds are often just painted canvas. Blending fore-
ground and background can pull the eye toward the foreground, 
if done correctly.
In photography, the soft-focus effect originated as a result of 
flaws in camera lenses. Later, with the use of lens filters, the effect 
was often incorporated into glamour images because it smooths 
skin wrinkles. In the digital age, soft focus is a handy trick that can 
remove blemishes while adding charm to any image. 
Fortunately for digital photographers, soft focus is a tech-
nique that raster-based programs like GIMP now provide, using 
common processes such as blurring. But it is also an effect that 
can be easily overused. 
This tutorial will show you how to soften the focus of a studio 
portrait. Techniques like this require only modest experience with 
selections combined with colors tools and the Gaussian Blur filter.
A soft focus (right) draws the viewer into the subject  
more than the original (left).
Getting Started
The easiest way to perform this effect is with a high pass filter. A 
high pass filter lets high frequencies pass while blocking low fre-
quencies. In an image, a high pass filter will enhance the areas of 
greatest contrast. You can use this knowledge to find blemishes, 
blur them out, and blend with the original image.
The stock GIMP distribution doesn’t provide a high pass fil-
ter, though one is available from the GIMP Plugin Registry. For-
tunately, a high pass filter can be simulated very easily with just a 
couple of layers and some color adjustments, so there’s no need 
to download and install the filter from the registry.
Start with a portrait. The portrait I’ve chosen looks fine as it 
is, but it could look even better—softer and more dreamy. Its best 
features are the boy’s eyes and the high contrast between the focal 
points (the faces) and the background and clothing. Be sure to 
find an image with similar contrast for your own experiment.
The original image is well executed, but you can  
improve it by softening the focus.

72   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
1.	 Open the image and duplicate the Background layer. 
2.	 Name the duplicate layer High Pass.
3.	 Duplicate the High Pass layer once. 
Two copies of the original layer are required to create the high pass filter. The 
second gets blurred and merged with the first before additional color adjust-
ments are applied.
Preparing the High Pass Filter
The high pass filter starts by blurring the top layer and changing 
its opacity so it blends with the next layer down.
1.	 If it’s not already selected, click the top layer in the Layers 
dialog to make it active.
2.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (FiltersBlurGaussian Blur).
3.	 Set the Blur Radius, both Horizontal and Vertical, to 30 pixels. 
Keep the Blur Method set to RLE.
4.	 Click OK to apply the blur to the layer.
5.	 In the Layers dialog, set the Opacity slider to 50 percent.
This process will soften the high-contrast areas in preparation for blend-
ing with the original image. The blur radius for the Gaussian Blur can be 
increased or decreased as needed. Higher blurs will increase the softness of 
the final image. Beware, however, that too much blur will just result in a mess.
Merging Layers
Blurring and transparency are just the first part of the simulated 
high pass. The next step is to invert the blur layer and blend it 
with the second layer, which is a copy of the original image. 
1.	 The top layer should still be selected in the Layers dialog. If 
not, select it.
2.	 Invert (ColorsInvert) the colors of this layer.
3.	 Merge (LayerMerge Down) the top layer with the layer 
below it.

2.1  Soft Focus   73
Note that the merged layer retains the name of the lower layer, in this case 
High Pass. When the top layer’s colors are inverted and merged down, the 
result is a mostly gray layer with high detail in the areas of interest (eyes and 
mouth, for example). You’ll exaggerate the high contrast areas with the next step.
Adjusting Light and Shadow in the  
High Pass Layer
The High Pass layer is ready for color, or rather lightness, correc-
tion. To do this, the Curves dialog will be used, followed by the 
Brightness-Contrast dialog. 
1.	 The High Pass layer should still be active in the Layers dialog.
2.	 Open the Curves dialog (ColorsCurves).
3.	 Adjust the diagonal line so it has an S shape similar to the 
one shown here.
4.	 Click OK to apply the changes to the layer.
5.	 Open the Brightness-Contrast dialog (ColorsBrightness- 
Contrast).
The steeper the middle part of the S curve,  
the less the original image will be brightened.
6.	 Set the Brightness slider to −95. Leave the Contrast slider at 0. 
7.	
Click OK to apply the changes to the layer.
The result of this step is similar to applying an edge-detect filter to the image. 
But none of the edge-detect filters in GIMP provide this kind of detail. 

74   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
Blending Layers
Now the High Pass layer can be merged with the original image.
1.	 Invert the colors of the High Pass layer.
2.	 Set the layer mode to Soft Light.
The results show the original image with more reflected light, like the glow 
movie studios add around aging starlets. 
Fine Tuning
But the soft focus has taken away some of the important features 
of the portrait, namely the eyes and mouth. To get these back, 
a layer mask is added and filled with black where the High Pass 
layer should not be applied.
1.	 The High Pass layer should be active in the Layers dialog. If 
not, select it.
2.	 Type D in the image window to reset the foreground color to 
black.
3.	 Add a white layer mask (LayerMaskAdd Layer Mask) to 
this layer.
4.	 Choose the Airbrush from the Toolbox.
5.	 Select a soft-edged brush, such as Round Fuzzy.
6.	 In the Tool Options dialog, adjust the size of the brush to fit 
the area to be masked, such as the eyes or lips.
7.	
In the image window, brush over the boy’s eyes and lips.
It’s not necessary to be exact using the airbrush in the mask. 
It won’t be immediately obvious that much is happening in the 
image window. Continue painting until the blur fades and the 
eyes and lips become distinct. Adjust the size of the brush for 
­different eyes and lips, and then repeat.
The color of the iris is more vivid and the eyelashes  
more pronounced after masking the high pass filter.
Further Exploration
The high pass layer in this tutorial (and the steps that created it) 
blurred the background, which also simulated a decreased depth 
of field. You’ll learn more about how to simulate this effect in Sec-
tion 2.5. This method of edge detection is also used for selective 
sharpening.

2.2  Photo to Sketch   75
2.2 
Photo to Sketch
This next technique is for all the would-be artists among us. What 
you can’t do with a pen and pencil, you can now do with a camera 
and GIMP. Although an inkjet print on textured paper isn’t quite 
the same as a fine hand-drawn sketch, it’s close enough for the 
digital crowd.
Converting a photo to a sketch basically means detecting the 
edges in an image and applying a slightly irregular line, one that 
looks like it might have been drawn by hand. This process isn’t 
exact—you might substitute a different edge-detect filter or use 
the Curves or Levels tools to adjust the desaturated layers before 
applying filters. But these basic steps will get you started.
Is it pen or pencil? Actually, it’s just a little GIMP magic.
Getting Started
The original image you choose for this effect shouldn’t be too 
busy. Soft lines are useful, but intricate patterns such as paisley 
would be problematic. Although I chose a still-life image for this 
example, the trick also works well with formal portraits and other 
pictures of people.
The subject of this image is a room with lots of lines and shapes  
but few odd patterns.
Converting the Image to a Sketch
1.	 First, desaturate the image (Colors4Desaturate).
2.	 Duplicate the layer twice (Layer4Duplicate Layer). Name 
the first duplicate Burn and the second duplicate Hard Light. 
3.	 Turn off the visibility of the two duplicate layers by clicking 
the eye icon for each one in the Layers dialog. Then select the 
Background layer again.
n o t e 	
The Background layer can also be duplicated once more before 
the next step. This will allow further experimentation by keep­
ing a copy of the desaturated layer. If you do this, be sure to 
turn off the visibility of the Background layer and apply the 
next step to this last duplicate layer.

76   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
The names of the duplicate layers hint at the layer modes to be used later. 
The Background layer has been renamed to Original Image here to make it 
easy to identify in the layer stack.
4.	 Open the Sobel filter (Filters4Edge Detect4Sobel). The 
Sobel filter is an edge-detect filter that looks for nearly hori-
zontal and vertical lines in the layer and keeps those in the 
resulting image.
5.	 Keep the default settings and click OK to apply them to the 
Original Image layer. The default settings for this filter, as 
opposed to the other edge-detect filters available in GIMP, 
will work best with this image because they’ll produce more 
solid and distinct lines that appear hand-drawn. However, 
you may get better results using another edge-detect filter if 
your image doesn’t look right after applying the Sobel filter.
6.	 The white lines may need to be enhanced. Use the Levels 
dialog (Colors4Levels) and pull the White Point slider to 
the left.
7.	
Invert the colors (Colors4Invert) for this layer to produce 
black lines on a white background.
The Sobel filter creates nice outlines of the image’s important shapes. Other 
edge-detect filters might work better for your image, so you should experiment.
Adding Depth to the Sketch
1.	 Click the Burn layer in the Layers dialog to make it active, 
and click its eye icon to make it visible once again.
2.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian Blur). 
3.	 Set the Horizontal and Vertical Blur Radius to 10 pixels and 
apply this filter to the layer. 
4.	 Set the layer mode to Burn. This makes dark areas in the 
background even darker, so the hand-drawn appearance 
looks as though it was achieved with a dark pencil.
5.	 In the Layers dialog, click the Hard Light layer to make it 
active, and then click its eye icon to make it visible.
6.	 Again, open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4 
Gaussian Blur). 
7.	
This time, set the Horizontal and Vertical Blur Radius to 
15 pixels. Click OK to apply these settings to the layer.
8.	 Set the layer mode to Hard Light. This will simulate the 
smudged charcoal appearance you get when rubbing your 
finger over a pencil mark on paper.

2.2  Photo to Sketch   77
Blending with a blurred original using Burn mode darkens outlines created by 
the edge-detect filter.
Applying the Hard Light mode lends the image a smudged charcoal appear-
ance, just like when you smear a pencil mark with your finger.
Adding the Finishing Touches
1.	 Let’s take this particular image a little further. Start by dupli-
cating the Original Image layer (Layer4Duplicate).
2.	 Set the layer mode of this duplicate layer to Multiply.
3.	 Set the Opacity to 50 percent. This brings out the image’s 
lines even more without making the drawing look artificial.
Adding this last layer is optional, but it helps to emphasize the lines in this 
particular image.
Further Exploration
This simple technique has numerous variations, including hand-
smudging the charcoal layer using the Smudge tool and manually 
tinting the strokes with the Colorize tool to simulate drawing 
with colored pencils. You can also use the Oilify filter (Filters4 
Artistic4Oilify) to produce impressionistic images, or you can 
use the Curves, Levels, or Posterize tools to produce images that 
look more like line drawings. When creating duplicates of the 
original image layer, make more than one for each type of edge-
detect filter and try variations of the filter settings. Larger blurs 
can soften the pencil strokes.

2.3 
Antiquing with Sepia Tones
Antique photos come in two flavors: black and white or tinted. 
Coloring black-and-white photos is easy with GIMP: you simply 
choose a color, pick a layer mode, and apply a Bucket Fill. There’s 
nothing to it. The tricky part is making it look right—adjusting 
the contrast in the grayscale image appropriately and then choos-
ing the right layer mode.
Most people associate tinted pictures, rather than plain black-
and-white ones, with antique photos. This may be because more 
old sepia-toned photos have survived. The processing chemistry 
for sepia prints converts the silver metal, which forms the image 
in black-and-white prints, into silver sulfide. Silver sulfide is more 
stable than silver metal. Thus, converting the silver to sulfide gives 
the photographs a much longer shelf life.
Sepia prints get their name from the range of brown tints 
produced by the development process, which resemble the ink of 
the cuttlefish (sepia in Latin). Re-creating true sepia tones digi-
tally therefore limits us to a small set of dark brown colors, some 
with a slight tint of red. Similar processes could be applied using 
colors other than shades of brown, though the resulting images 
would not mimic true sepia prints.
In this tutorial you’ll try out some possible variations as you 
produce sepia-toned images using different combinations of 
colors, contrast, and layer modes.
Getting Started
This tutorial’s original image comes from an online image archive 
(available from BigStockPhoto.com) and has been desaturated 
using the Channel Mixer (Colors4Components4Channel Mixer). 
Alternatives to using the Channel Mixer dialog are using the 
Desaturate dialog or converting the image to grayscale (Image4 
Mode4Grayscale) and then back to RGB (Image4Mode4RGB). 
The primary difference between these latter two methods is 
that the Desaturate dialog only works on the current layer. If 
your image has more than one layer, the Desaturate dialog won’t 
convert all of those layers at once. For multiple layers, it would 
be more appropriate to convert the image to grayscale and then 
back to RGB.
Converting an image from full color to sepia is a fairly simple process.
But the Channel Mixer is the best option for this tutorial. Old 
photographs often owe their appearance to the use of ortho­chro­
matic film. Orthochromatic emulsions cause blue tints to appear 
brighter and reds darker. The Channel Mixer provides a higher 
degree of control in setting these channels when converting from 
color to a monochromatic image.

2.3  Antiquing with Sepia Tones   79
1.	 Open the original image.
2.	 Open the Channel Mixer dialog (Colors4Components4 
Channel Mixer). For this image, set the Red channel to 47, 
the Green to 0, and the Blue to 73, and click the Mono-
chrome option to convert the image to black and white.
Desaturate the original image using the Color Mixer.
Since the original image is very crisp, and most old photos 
are not, a slight blur is applied next. 
1.	
Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian Blur). 
2.	 Set both the Horizontal and Vertical Blur Radius to 2.0 pixels. 
Only a small amount of blur is necessary, enough to remove 
bright reflections on the locomotive’s outer shell. 
3.	 Apply this setting to the desaturated image.
A slight blur helps remove crisp reflections from modern photographs.
Increasing the Middle Grays
Sepia toning works primarily by colorizing the gray region of 
the desaturated image. Dark pixels are relatively unaffected, and 
lighter pixels just get a bit lighter. The locomotive in the image is 
very dark, so we’ll lighten it using the Levels tool to maximize the 
sepia tone’s effects.
1.	 The first step in getting more gray into the image is to adjust 
the Levels histogram (Colors4Levels). There are two types 
of histograms available: Linear and Logarithmic (see the 
small icons to the right of the Reset Channel button). The 
Logarithmic histogram shows a greater number of dark (left 
side) and light (right side) pixels, and relatively fewer gray 
(middle) pixels. 
2.	 To increase the amount of gray in the image, we lighten the 
darker pixels by sliding the middle (gray) slider under the 
histogram to the left. 

80   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
3.	 Apply this change to the image by clicking the OK button in 
the Levels dialog.
4.	 Looking at the Levels histogram again shows that there are 
now gaps in the graph on the dark side and spikes on the 
light side. There are also small spikes in the center area. This 
shows us visually how darker pixels have been changed to 
lighter pixels.
There is a wide tonal range in this image. A slight levels adjustment (left) 
makes it an excellent candidate for application of sepia tones. The result 
of applying this change is evident when the Levels histogram is checked 
again.
5.	 As an additional measure, you can also reduce the contrast 
in the image (Colors4Brightness-Contrast). Reducing the 
contrast simulates the fade that the years will have brought 
to an old photograph.
Reducing the contrast and brightness will make the image appear more aged 
when the sepia tones are applied.
Adding the Sepia Tone
The image is now ready for a sepia tone. Sepia is a brown color 
with a slightly reddish tint, varying from light to dark shades. 
You can use many RGB value sets to achieve a sepia tone, and 
an Internet search will help you find them. For this image you’ll 
apply 135/96/40 to two separate layers. Each colored layer will be 
blended using a different layer mode.
1.	 Duplicate the original layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer) and 
name the duplicate layer Sepia Screen.
2.	 Fill the new layer with the appropriate sepia tone. To do this, 
first click the foreground color box to open the Change Fore-
ground Color dialog. Enter your RGB values in the appropri-
ate fields, and then click OK. (In this example I used RGB 
values of 135/96/40 for the sepia tone.)

2.3  Antiquing with Sepia Tones   81
3.	 Select the Bucket Fill tool, and in the Tool Options dialog 
set the Mode to Multiply and the Affected Area to Fill Whole 
Selection. Click in the duplicate layer to colorize the layer 
with the sepia tone.
4.	 To combine this new layer with the original, set the mode for 
this colored layer to Screen. 
5.	 Duplicate the Sepia Screen layer. Name the duplicate layer 
Sepia Overlay. Change the layer mode to Overlay.
The screen layer lightens the image by adding color to it, while the overlay 
darkens only the dark areas by also infusing color. 
Further Exploration
Further aging of the image can be accomplished by adding a 
selective blur to the far end of the locomotive, adding a depth of 
field common in old photographs. Further blurring of the entire 
image can also help mimic a faded, aged photograph.
The sepia toning process lends itself well to experimentation. 
Use multiple layers with different tinting and layer modes applied, 
and then flash back and forth between them using the eye icon in 
the Layers dialog to compare the results.
Remember that layer modes and Tool Option blend modes 
can produce distinct results. Blend a solid-colored layer with the 
layer below using a layer mode from the Layers dialog. Then turn 
off the solid-colored layer visibility and colorize the lower layer 
using the Bucket Fill tool with its blend mode in the Tool Options 
dialog set to the same mode. Compare the results of both tech-
niques and note the difference. Using the layer modes makes 
it easier to change the sepia tone without altering the original 
image, and the result may be truer to the faded colors in old 
photographs.

2.4 
Color Swap
Photographers are often asked to change the color of one or more 
elements in an image. How easy this process is depends entirely 
on how easy it is to isolate the objects that need updating.
This tutorial looks at two examples of color swap. The first 
is an image in which the color change doesn’t require difficult 
selections. The second image requires a more delicate hand.
Successful color swaps are all a matter of good selections.  
This image is fairly easy to work with because the items  
we want to change are easy to isolate.
Color swapping is more complicated when the object you want to change is 
difficult to select. This project uses the Quick Mask to change the color of the vase.
A Simple Color Swap
The first example is a collection of boats on a beach. There’s a 
plethora of color here. Let’s change the yellow trim on some of 
these boats to a light blue.
Isolating the Object
To change the color of only certain objects in an image, you’ll 
need to isolate those objects from objects of a similar color else-
where in the image. It’s obvious that some of the boats are yellow. 
Yellow isn’t so apparent in the rocks and trees in the background, 
but it’s plentiful there too. 
1.	 To isolate the boats, use the Rectangle Select tool to make 
a simple selection encompassing the majority of the boats.

2.4  Color Swap   83
2.	 Add smaller rectangular selections to squeeze in the high-
est prow without selecting the rocks around it. Here the 
unselected region is made darker so you can more easily 
see what’s selected. 
You don’t need to isolate the yellow elements from their immediate surround-
ings; you just need to isolate the lower half of the image (shown here with the 
Quick Mask enabled). If you include the upper half of the image, the yellow 
in the trees and rocks will be also be changed to blue when you swap colors.
Choosing the Destination Color
1.	 Open the Hue-Saturation dialog (Colors4Hue-Saturation). 
You can use this dialog to edit multiple channels, including 
the familiar red, green, and blue channels and their counter­
parts in the world of digital printing: cyan, magenta, and 
yellow.
2.	 Choose the yellow channel and adjust the Hue, Lightness, 
and Saturation sliders until a soft blue replaces the yellow.
This process works because the color to be replaced—yellow—is 
not a major part of the other colors contained within the selection. 
An exact selection isn’t necessary to swap the color yellow with the 
color blue. The only places that might be problematic are the log 
and sand on the beach. Brown contains some yellow, so after the 
Hue-Saturation changes are applied, the log and sand have a blue 
tint. This is easily fixed by removing the log from the selection 
using any of the selection tools, including the Quick Mask. The 
sawhorse on the beach near the middle of the picture also has 
heavy yellow content and needs to be handled in a similar manner 
(unless you want it painted blue as well). Keeping the sand out of 
the selection requires a more complex process, such as the one 
in the following tutorial.
Use the Hue-Saturation tool to swap yellow with blue.
A More Complex Color Swap
The same trick doesn’t work on the next image. Let’s say you want 
to change the color of the vase to a shade of yellow. The problem 
is that although the vase’s reddish-brown color contains a lot of 
red, red also appears throughout the rest of the image. In fact, if 
you made the same change to this image’s red channel as you did 
to the boat image’s yellow channel, you’d change the color of the 
background chair, the berries, and the table.

84   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
The previous technique doesn’t work here because the color you want to 
change appears throughout the entire image.
Creating a Complex Selection
1.	 This image requires a complex selection. Start by using the 
Fuzzy Select tool with the Threshold set to 40. Clicking the 
middle right part of the vase creates an initial selection.
2.	 To finish off the selection, use the Quick Mask and some 
soft-edged brushes. The problem with using the default Quick 
Mask in this situation is that it uses a red tint to highlight 
what isn’t selected, but we’re trying to select objects that have 
lots of red in them. This makes the selections created with 
the Fuzzy Select tool difficult to see when converted to the 
Quick Mask.
The default Quick Mask is red, making it difficult to see the reddish selections.
Changing the Quick Mask Color
1.	 This problem is easily fixed. Right-click the Quick Mask 
­button in the lower-left corner of the canvas window. A 
menu opens.
2.	 Keeping the right mouse button held down, drag to the bot-
tom of the menu to select Configure Color and Opacity.
3.	 In the Quick Mask Attributes dialog, click the preview window 
(it shows the color and transparency of the mask) to open the 
Edit Quick Mask Color dialog.
4.	 Here you can change the RGB values used for the Quick 
Mask as well as the opacity for the mask (by adjusting the A 
slider below the B slider). Choose a color for the Quick Mask 
that contrasts with the colors in the object to be selected. A 
higher opacity value makes it easier to see what’s been selected 
but also makes it harder to see what needs to be selected. 
Here I’ve chosen a cyan mask with an opacity of 70 percent 
instead of the default 50 percent. The result is that the selected 
parts of the vase are much easier to see, while the parts of the 
vase that need to be selected are still visible.

2.4  Color Swap   85
Change the Quick Mask color in the Quick Mask Attributes window.
5.	 When you’re satisfied with the mask color, click OK in the 
dialogs to close them.
Cyan is a high-contrast color for this image, which makes working with 
the Quick Mask much easier.
Painting the Selection
You learned in Section 1.4 that using the Quick Mask is the most 
effective way to select oddly shaped objects. Here’s a chance to try 
it out.
1.	 Zoom in on the vase by pressing the + key.
2.	 Draw straight lines in the Quick Mask with the Paintbrush 
tool’s small, hard-edged brushes by clicking at one endpoint 
of the line, holding down the shift key, and then clicking 
at the other end of the line. When painting (or drawing) 
with the Quick Mask, you must paint with black or white. Set 
the foreground color to white to paint over what should be 
included in the selection, and set the foreground color to 
black to paint over what shouldn’t be in the selection. When 
you’re finished, click the Quick Mask button again to convert 
the mask to a selection.
Select the vase by painting carefully in the Quick Mask. Remember that what-
ever you paint with white in the mask will be included when you convert the 
Quick Mask to a selection.

86   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
3.	 Grow the selection by 1 pixel (Select4Grow), and then 
feather it by 2 pixels (Select4Feather). Save the selection to 
a channel (Select4Save to Channel) in case you later decide 
to undo your color change and edit the selection again.
Working in a Duplicate Layer
Working in a duplicate layer saves you the headache of making 
mistakes in the original layer. If you don’t like your changes in 
the duplicate layer, just try again.
1.	 After saving your selection, click the original layer in the 
­Layers dialog to make it active again.
2.	 Copy the selection and paste it as a new layer (Layer4To 
New Layer). Name this layer Vase and make sure it’s active.
3.	 At this point you could use the Colorize tool (Colors4 
Colorize) to change the color of the vase, but the vase has 
varying shades of red and yellow in it, and the Colorize tool 
will completely wash out those variations. Instead, use the 
Hue-Saturation tool again. Open the Hue-Saturation dialog 
(Colors4Hue-Saturation).
4.	 Choose the red channel and move the Hue slider to the right 
to change the red content of the vase to a more yellow color. 
Then click the yellow channel and do the same. Be sure to 
make both changes before clicking OK. The results will be 
much greener if you adjust the red channel first, click OK, 
reopen the dialog, and then adjust the yellow channel.
5.	 Deselect all (Select4None) when all color changes are 
completed.
The vase’s color can be changed using the Hue-Saturation tool once the color 
has been isolated with the Quick Mask selection.
Further Exploration
Swapping the color of objects in stock photos is a very common 
practice. Objects that have colors not found in the rest of the 
image are the easiest to change, as we saw with the image of boats 
on a beach. Changing the color of a vase or shirt or some other 
oddly shaped subject requires complex selections created using 
the Fuzzy Select tool, the Quick Mask, and other GIMP selection 
tools. These selections are more difficult but not impossible.
Mastery of the Quick Mask tool will help in the next tutorial, 
in which you’ll use a set of complex selections to add depth to a 
photograph.

2.5  Changing Depth of Field   87
2.5 
Changing Depth of Field
Take a look at any of your personal photos. If you’ve used a 
consumer-grade camera, you’ll notice that the photo has a deep 
depth of field. That is, if your subject is more than a few yards 
away, most of the photo is in focus. Changing the depth of field 
can alter the feeling an image conveys. If your intended subject 
is not centered in the frame or not completely obvious, a depth-
of-field change can draw attention to the subject and expose the 
true meaning of the photo. 
Making the depth of field shallow can also make a normal 
scene appear as if it was a miniature, as you’ll see in Section 2.11. 
In reality, computer-aided depth-of-field trickery is no more 
than a selective blur. You’ve probably seen this trick used in auto-
mobile advertisements, where the car is in focus but the back-
ground is blurred beyond recognition. In this tutorial you’ll pull 
a building to the forefront of a photo using modest depth-of-field 
changes.
Changing a photograph’s depth of field is a simple process of selecting 
and blurring. As is often the case in photography, the trick is making a 
good selection.
Getting Started
This tutorial begins with an image that has a relatively flat depth 
of field and is completely in focus. The solid blue sky will allow 
you to create selections of the buildings easily. You’ll still have 
to make some manual selections, but the solid blue sky will save 
some time.
n o t e 	
The image used in this tutorial is in the public domain and is 
available from PDPhoto.org.
A solid blue sky makes the initial selections easy.

88   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
Isolating the Foreground
The original image is in focus and has an obvious foreground 
object—the outhouse. Start by creating a selection that includes 
the outhouse and some of the grasses in front of it. Here the 
unselected areas are tinted red to better show the selection.
1.	 Choose the Fuzzy Select tool from the Toolbox. Click the 
blue sky to create an initial selection. If one click doesn’t 
select the entire sky, click somewhere in the unselected area 
while holding down the shift key.
n o t e 	
Moving the mouse to the right while keeping the left mouse but­
ton pressed also enlarges the selection, though this method can 
sometimes be a little harder to use.
Because the sky is a solid color and contrasts so dramatically with the land, 
you should be able to select the sky using the Fuzzy Select tool in no more 
than three clicks. Here, the sky selection is shown using the Quick Mask.
2.	 Invert the selection (Select4Invert), and then click the 
Quick Mask button. As you’ve seen, unselected areas are 
tinted red when the default Quick Mask properties are in use 
(Section 2.4 showed you how to change the default color).
3.	 Select the Paintbrush tool and press D in the image window 
to reset the default foreground and background colors, making 
the foreground black.
4.	 Paint over the house on the left, some of the background 
grasses, and the rocky hill on the right. Use smaller brushes 
until the Quick Mask looks similar to that shown. Everything 
you paint over will be excluded from the selection.
5.	 Click the Quick Mask button again to convert the mask back 
into a selection.
6.	 Save the selection to a channel (Select4Save to Channel). 
Then click the channel name in the Channels dialog and 
change the name to Outhouse Selection. Saving selections to a 
channel allows you to easily recall them for further editing 
should you decide the original selection wasn’t sufficient for 
your project. Later in this tutorial you’ll retrieve the saved 
selections and invert them for use with areas outside the 
original selection.
7.	
Select the original layer in the Layers dialog (Windows4 
Dockable Dialogs4Layers). Feather the selection by 10 pixels 
(Select4Feather), and then copy (Edit4Copy) the selection 
and paste it (Edit4Paste) as a new layer (Layer4To New 
Layer).
n o t e 	
Alternatively, combine the paste with the new layer creation 
using Edit4Paste As4New Layer.
8.	 Click the new layer name and change it to Outhouse.
9.	 In the Channels dialog (Windows4Dockable Dialogs4 
Channels), click the Outhouse Selection channel, and then 
click the Channel to Selection button.

2.5  Changing Depth of Field   89
The outhouse and foreground grasses are isolated with the Quick Mask.
The outhouse and foreground grasses are copied to their own layer so that 
blur operations you perform later won’t affect them.
10.	 Select the Background layer in the Layers dialog to make 
that layer active. Invert the selection to select everything 
except the original outhouse and foreground landscape.
11.	 Click Select by Color in the toolbox. Adjust the Threshold 
level in the Tool Options dialog as necessary (I set it to 50 for 
this image).
12.	 Hold down the ctrl key and click in the blue sky to remove 
the sky from the selection, leaving just the background 
grasses, the house, and the hill. Use Quick Mask to remove 
the house and hill from the selection, leaving some of the 
grasses. Click the Quick Mask button once more to con-
vert the mask to a selection. Save the selection to a channel 
named Grasses Selection (Select4Save to Channel).
The grasses between the foreground outhouse and the background roof are 
selected in this step. This allows you to blur the middle (grasses) and back-
ground (roof) subjects to different degrees, exaggerating the depth of field.

90   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
13.	 Select the Background layer to make it active again. 
Feather the selection by 10 pixels (Select4Feather), and 
then copy and paste the selection as a new layer. Name this 
layer Grasses and move it below the Outhouse layer in the 
Layers dialog. The layer order should be, top to bottom: 
Outhouse, Grasses, Background.
14.	 This process has created a secondary focal point that is not 
in the foreground but not completely in the background.
Adding Depth of Field
1.	 Now let’s increase the depth of field. Select the Background 
layer.
2.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur). Apply a blur of 20 pixels to the Background layer. Then 
select the Grasses layer and apply a blur of 5 to 10 pixels.
3.	 Adjust the levels (Colors4Levels) for the Grasses and Back-
ground layers to darken them slightly and add to the photo’s 
sense of depth.
The grasses behind the outhouse are blurred slightly, and the roof behind 
those grasses is blurred even more.
Further Exploration
This process works well on this image because making the initial 
selection was easy: the sky contrasts dramatically with the out­
house and grasses. This process is often applied to outdoor por-
traits, and those projects work just like this one, though selecting 
the foreground object (the bride in a wedding photo, for exam-
ple) is more difficult. Again, the Quick Mask will be a big help. 
You can also try the Foreground Select tool, which is designed to 
make selecting irregularly shaped objects even easier.

2.6  Reflections on Glass   91
2.6 
Reflections on Glass
Simulating the reflection of an object on a glassy surface is actu-
ally pretty simple. In this example I’ll use a yellow rose. The vertical 
orientation of the rose—stem to flower—will make the reflection 
easier to see.
GIMP makes this rosy reflection easy.
Getting Started
In the original image, a yellow rose is set against a garden back-
ground. This image offers high contrast around the edges. When 
you create reflections using images like this, it’s best to remove 
the darker edges and leave the lighter color of the object. This 
allows you to place the selection on just about any background. 
n o t e 	
The image used in this tutorial is available at PDPhoto.org.
Using the Fuzzy Select tool and the Quick Mask is the fastest way to accu-
rately select the rose.
Preparing the Image
1.	 Using the Fuzzy Select tool and the Quick Mask in combina-
tion, make a selection around the rose.
2.	 Feather the selection (Select4Feather) by 3 pixels. Copy the 
selection, paste it to its own layer, and name the layer Rose. 
Delete the original layer (Layer4Delete Layer).
3.	 Add a new layer (Layer4New Layer) with a black background 
and call it Black Background. Move it below the Rose layer. 
4.	 The rose doesn’t leave enough space on the canvas for a full 
reflection, so it needs to be scaled down. Select the Rose layer 
to make it active. Choose the Scale tool from the toolbox, 
select the Keep Aspect option in the Tool Options dialog, 
and then click the canvas. Drag in the canvas to scale the 
rose to about half its original size.

92   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
5.	 Using the Move tool, position the Rose layer in the upper 
half of the window.
The rose is selected and copied to its own layer. The Black Background 
layer replaces the original image layer.
Scale down the rose to about half the size of the canvas to make room 
for its reflection.
Creating the Reflection
1.	 Duplicate the Rose layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer) and 
name the duplicate layer Rose Reflection.
2.	 Enlarge the layer boundary (Layer4Layer Boundary Size) 
by 20 percent—choose Percent from the drop-down menu 
next to the Current Height field—and click the Center but-
ton in the Layer Boundary Size dialog.
3.	 Make sure the Lock Alpha Channel box is unchecked for the 
Rose Reflection layer (the Lock Alpha Channel box is just 
below the Opacity slider in the Layers dialog).
4.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur) and blur the Rose Reflection layer by 8 to 10 pixels.
Increasing the layer boundary size of the Rose Reflection layer gives us some 
extra room for blurring. If we didn’t resize, the blur might bump up against the 
edge of the original rose.
Adding a Surface for the Reflection
1.	 Next let’s add a visible surface. Add a new transparent layer 
(Layer4New Layer) and name it Surface Gradient.
2.	 Press D and then X in the toolbox to set the background to 
black.

2.6  Reflections on Glass   93
3.	 Double-click the foreground color box to open the Change 
Foreground Color dialog. For the cyan color shown here, 
type cyan in the HTML notation field and click OK. This 
color has aesthetic value, as well as contrasting with the color 
of the rose. Using a high-contrast color for the surface will 
emphasize the reflection even more.
4.	 To create the gradient effect shown, select the Blend tool from 
the toolbox. In the Tool Options dialog, set the Gradient to 
FG to Transparent and select the Reverse option. Then drag 
from the middle of the flower to three-fourths of the way down 
in the image window to apply the cyan gradient to the Surface 
Gradient layer. Move the Surface Gradient layer beneath the 
Rose layer, just above the Black Background layer.
The rose will be reflected on the surface created by the cyan gradient.
Placing the Reflection on the Surface
1.	 Click the Rose Reflection layer in the Layers dialog to make 
it active.
2.	 Select the Flip tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog select Vertical for the Flip Type, and then click the 
canvas to flip this layer.
3.	 Use the Move tool to position the reflection beneath the rose 
on the canvas. Press the ctrl key during the move to move 
straight down (or at any 45 degree angle).
4.	 Reduce the Opacity of the Rose Reflection layer to 50 per-
cent and lower this layer between the Rose layer and the Sur-
face Gradient layer.
The reflection effect is nearly complete, but a real reflection would include a 
shadow cast by the reflected object.
Adding a Shadow
Because the rose would block any light shining directly overhead, 
you must add a shadow to the surface. And because light would 
shine in multiple directions above the rose, more than one shadow 
would be cast. Next you’ll create these shadows.
1.	 Add a transparent layer named Shadow 1.
2.	 Choose the Ellipse Select tool from the toolbox and create 
an oval selection just below the rose.

94   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
Blurring and reducing the opacity of a simple black oval creates an initial 
shadow.
3.	 Feather the selection by 10 pixels (Select4Feather) and fill 
it with black. Deselect the oval (Select4None).
4.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur) and apply a blur of 45 pixels to the Shadow 1 layer, and 
then set the layer’s Opacity to 65 percent. Move this layer to 
just above the Rose Reflection layer.
5.	 Duplicate the Rose layer, name the duplicate layer Shadow 2, 
and increase the layer boundary size by 10 percent (Layer4 
Layer Boundary Size).
6.	 Create a selection of the rose (Layer4Transparency4 
Alpha to Selection), and then grow the selection by 2 pixels 
(Select4Grow).
7.	
Press D in the canvas to reset the foreground color to black. 
Then fill the selection with black by dragging the foreground 
color box from the toolbox into the selection. Deselect all 
(ctrl-shift-A).
8.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter and apply a blur of 45 pixels 
to the Shadow 2 layer.
9.	 Use the Flip tool to flip the layer vertically, and then use the 
Scale tool to reduce the height of the layer by half.
10.	 Move the Shadow 2 layer beneath the Rose layer (Layer4 
Stack4Lower Layer), and then position it using the Move 
tool so the shadow appears below the yellow rose.
11.	 Reduce the Opacity of the Shadow 2 layer to 35 percent. 
The shaped shadow merges with the oval shadow, making the area directly 
beneath the rose darkest but also allowing the shadow to mimic the shape of 
the rose.
Further Exploration
This technique for creating reflections on glassy surfaces can be 
extended to surfaces that aren’t quite as flat or reflective. You can 
also add texture to the surface to distort the reflected shape or 
change the direction, color, and lighting to make the reflection 
less distinct. In the next tutorial I’ll show you how to add waves 
to the surface of a reflection to create a lake effect.

2.7  Lake Reflection   95
2.7 
Lake Reflection
The previous tutorial showed you how to create reflections on 
glass, but much more can be done by expanding on the technique. 
That section’s tutorial made only slight modifications to the object 
being reflected (a rose). But what about adding texture to the 
reflective surface? How can we create a reflection on a surface—
like water—that isn’t perfectly flat?
An easy way to add surface texture is to grab it from another 
image. A photo that shows the surface of a lake or ocean will work 
well for this tutorial. Once the sampled image is desaturated 
and blended with the reflection, it turns a glassy surface into a 
realistic reflection.
The lake looks real, but it has been added digitally using GIMP.
This tutorial turns a lawn into an undulating lake. In the real 
world, creating exactly the image you want usually requires the 
application of more than one effect, so let’s start by enhancing 
the colors in the original photo.
Getting Started
The image we’ll use in this tutorial is perfect for this kind of 
project. The building makes a dramatic focal point, and the 
grassy area in front is large enough to provide space for the lake. 
However, the color of the bricks could be more intense, so you’ll 
increase the color saturation before reflecting the image of the 
building. If the image you choose needs similar tweaks, it’s best 
to handle them now.
1.	 First, auto-adjust the Levels histogram. Open the Levels dia-
log (Colors4Levels) and click the Auto button, and then 
click OK to close the dialog.
2.	 Next, open the Hue-Saturation dialog (Colors4Hue-Satura-
tion). Click the R button just below the red box at the top of 
the dialog so we only adjust the red colors in the image. Then 
increase the Saturation to 75 to bring out the details in the 
building.
3.	 Finally, open the Brightness-Contrast dialog (Colors4 
Brightness-Contrast) and set the Brightness to 30 and the 
Contrast to 25.

96   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
Adjust the saturation and brightness of the image to make the build-
ing’s colors more vivid.
Creating the Initial Reflection
1.	 Make a square selection around the subject—in this case, 
the building. Also, include some of the grassy area in front 
of the building. The selection covers from the top of the 
image to just below where the grass lawn meets the build-
ing. Copy the selection and paste it into a new layer. Click 
the layer name and change it to Reflection.
2.	 Select the Flip tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog set the Flip Type to Vertical and click the canvas to 
flip the layer.
3.	 Use the Move tool to drag the Reflection layer down on the 
canvas. If the Reflection layer does not span the width of the 
canvas, select the Scale tool and then click the canvas to scale 
the layer manually.
A simple rectangular selection includes the building and some of the grassy 
area. This selection is copied and pasted to a new layer, and then the layer 
is flipped vertically. Finally, the new layer is dragged down on the canvas 
until positioned as shown here.
Adding Ripples
1.	 To look realistic, the reflected image should be more blurred 
and less saturated than the original. Open the Hue-Saturation 
dialog (Colors4Hue-Saturation) and click the Master but-
ton. Reduce the Saturation level to −45 for this image (your 
project may require different settings).

2.7  Lake Reflection   97
2.	 Open the Ripple filter (Filters4Distorts4Ripple). Set the 
Orientation to Vertical, the Edges to Smear, the Period to 
60, and the Amplitude to 2, and then apply this filter to the 
Reflection layer. Repeat this process with the Ripple filter 
once more, this time setting the Orientation to Horizontal, 
the Period to 7, and the Amplitude to 5. Applying the Ripple 
filter twice applies ripples to ripples, just as waves in water 
cause interference patterns.
The Ripple filter lends an undulating effect to the reflection, though we’ll 
improve upon this shortly.
3.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur). Set both the Horizontal and Vertical Blur Radius 
to 10 pixels and apply the blur to the Reflection layer.
4.	 Duplicate the layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer). Name the 
layer Color.
5.	 Click the foreground color box to open the Change Fore-
ground Color dialog. For the dark blue shown here, set the 
RGB values to 5/24/83 and click OK. Then drag the fore-
ground color into the layer. Finally, move the layer below 
the original Reflection layer and reduce the Opacity of the 
Reflection layer to 80 percent.
Adding a blue layer beneath the Reflection layer makes the reflection look 
more like a lake.
Adding Waves
The Ripple filter makes the lake’s surface somewhat more realis-
tic, but adding waves would improve the texture even more. To 
add waves, you can grab a selection from another photo.
1.	
Make a selection in a photo of real water waves, and then copy 
and paste it into a new layer named Water in the original proj-
ect images. Use the Scale tool to scale the layer as necessary.
2.	 Desaturate the Water layer (Colors4Desaturate).
3.	 Open the Brightness-Contrast dialog (Colors4Brightness-
Contrast) and set both sliders to 70. This will enhance the 
waves for use as a bump map. Turn off the visibility of the 
Water layer in the Layers dialog.
4.	 Click on the Reflection layer in the Layers dialog to make 
it active.
5.	 Open the Bump Map filter (Filters4Map4Bump Map). Set 
Bump Map to the Water layer, the Azimuth to 145, the Eleva-
tion to 20, and the Depth to 3. Click OK to apply this to the 
Reflection layer.

98   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
Waves are copied and pasted into the project image to make the lake look 
even more realistic.
Bump map uses the source image (the Water layer) to distort the active layer 
(the Reflection layer). Adjusting the source image brightness and saturation 
and the various Bump Map settings can dramatically affect the final result.
Further Exploration
This particular image lends itself well to further enhancement. 
The high contrast between the building and the sky allows you 
to make changes to the weather, perhaps even changing a sunny 
day into a starlit evening. Try converting this image to a night-
time scene. The Fuzzy Select tool can be used to capture most 
of the sky, and what is missed can be picked up easily using the 
Quick Mask. But be warned: the lake reflection will need to be 
changed too!

2.8  Photo Restoration   99
2.8 
Photo Restoration
Photo restoration and retouching—the art of preserving and 
enhancing old photographs folded from misuse or cracked and 
faded with age—is a form of digital image manipulation that 
is often overlooked. As you’ll see in this tutorial, GIMP’s tools 
enable you to achieve high-quality photo restoration.
A number of tricks can be used to restore damaged photos, 
but the most common technique involves cloning similar areas 
to use in replacing damaged areas. GIMP’s Clone tool allows 
you to use brushstrokes of any shape on copied and pasted areas. 
However, this method is only appropriate for minor cleanup work 
such as removing specks of dust or hiding thin, short scratches. 
Cloning is also destructive because it occurs in the layer where 
the damage exists. If the patches are not to your liking, you may 
not be able to reverse them easily.
A better strategy for correcting larger blemishes is to make 
a selection, copy and paste the selection as a patch layer, and 
then blend this into the original layer using the Airbrush tool 
in a layer mask. This approach has the advantage of allowing 
additional changes to be made later, by either modifying the 
layer mask or replacing the patch layer completely. Of course, 
no matter which approach you take, you’ll want to preserve your 
original damaged art for experimentation. In this tutorial, we’ll 
look at the copy-and-paste method of fixing heavily damaged 
images. We’ll also discuss when to use large selections to patch 
large areas and when to divide a blemish into pieces and patch 
them individually.
Getting Started
This image was scanned from a 60-year-old photo that had been 
creased several times, with one crease actually leaving a slight 
tear along the subject’s midsection. There are several problems 
to fix here: correct the black-and-white points in the faded 
image, remove the creases, and clean up the background.
What was once old is new again.
Your candidate for restoration is likely to have many of the 
same problems, but they may occur in different areas of the 
image, presenting different challenges. Scanning the original 
image at a high resolution, such as 250 dpi, will allow you to 
create a high-quality print once your image has been restored.
Enhancing the Scanned Image
1.	 Let’s start with some basic image enhancement. To correct 
the black-and-white points, click the Auto button in the 
Levels dialog (Colors4Levels). This automatically moves 
the left slider (black) to the first entry on that end of the his-
togram and moves the right slider (white) to the first entry 
on that end. This increases the image’s contrast so the dark-
est pixels become black and the lightest pixels become white, 
making the image clearer overall.

100   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
2.	 The image has also taken on a brown tint as it’s aged. Fix this 
by desaturating the image (Colors4Desaturate).
3.	 As is the case with most scanned images, some sharpening 
is required (Filters4Enhance4Sharpen). The Unsharp 
Mask filter (Filters4Enhance4Unsharp Mask) could also be 
used, but isn’t best for this image because there are very few 
straight lines.
Sharpen the scan and adjust the levels before you start to patch the 
blemishes. If you make these changes after the patches are in place, 
the edges of your patches may be visible.
Correcting with a Single Patch
The big scratch across the woman’s sweater is an example of the 
kind of damage you can fix with a simple copy-and-paste correc-
tion that consists of a single patch. There is enough undamaged 
sweater in the photo to allow us to use this technique.
1.	 Choose the Free Select tool and draw an outline around 
part of the scratch that traverses the woman’s midsection, 
and then press enter to convert this to a selection. This will 
give you the size of the area that must be patched. Choose 
the Move tool from the Toolbox. In the Tool Options dialog, 
click on the Selection option for the Move setting.
2.	 Click inside the selection and drag the mouse to move the 
selection to an unblemished area near the scratch.
3.	 Feather the selection by 10 pixels (Selection4Feather).
4.	 Copy the selection and paste it in a new layer (Layer4To 
New Layer), and then position the new layer over the scratch. 
In this case, the sweater’s pleats help us align the patch, but 
your images will probably provide similar guides. (To show 
where the patch has been applied, the original image is 
tinted red.)
The Free Select tool is used first, and then the selection is moved to a nearby 
unblemished area to create a patch.

2.8  Photo Restoration   101
This patch covers the blemish quite well because it was taken from a nearby 
part of the image. The farther away you go from the blemish, the less likely 
the patch will fit as cleanly.
5.	 In this example, the pleats don’t align perfectly, but this can 
be fixed by using the Scale tool or the IWarp filter (Filters4 
Distorts4IWarp) to make minor adjustments. If the patch 
doesn’t align along its edges with the original layer, add a 
layer mask (Layer4Add Layer Mask) and use the Airbrush 
tool to spray black in the mask along the edges of the patch. 
6.	 If the patch’s tonal qualities don’t match those of the damaged 
area, you can use the Curves tool (Colors4Curves). Make 
sure the patch layer (not its mask) is active by clicking the 
layer preview in the Layers dialog. To see if the patch lines 
up well with the original image, turn the layer visibility for 
the patch on and off quickly (using the eye icon in the Layers 
dialog). As you do this, it should appear that the pleats (or 
other guides) are in place and only the scratch is removed.
Flash the patch layer’s visibility on and off to see how well the patch fits.
Correcting with Multiple Patches
The scratches across both of the woman’s sleeves pose a more dif-
ficult problem. There’s no single unblemished area large enough 
to cover these scratches, so they require several smaller patches. 
Use multiple small patches to fix the scratch on the left sleeve, cre-
ating each small patch just as the previous large patch was created.
1.	 Use the Free Select tool from the Toolbox to select part of 
the scratch, move the selection over a nearby unblemished 
region, copy and paste the selection as a new layer (ctrl-C, 
ctrl-V, ctrl-shift-N), and move that layer over the scratch. 
If necessary, use a layer mask (Layer4Mask4Add Layer 
Mask) on the patch to blend it with the surrounding areas.
2.	 In this photo, the dark area between the woman’s sleeve and 
midsection has a very complex pattern. The patch requires 
use of the Curves tool (Colors4Curves) because the patch 
was taken from a region with different tonal qualities. A 

102   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
simple blend with a layer mask isn’t sufficient to meld the 
patch over the scratch. The Curves adjustment modifies the 
tonal qualities so the patch blends seamlessly when combined 
with the mask. 
3.	 After all the sleeve patches are created and blended, merge 
them (Layer4Merge Down) one at a time into a single patch.
For small disconnected blemishes like this one, especially in high-contrast 
areas, use a series of small patches.
Correcting Facial Blemishes
Scratches on a subject’s face are more difficult to fix than those on 
clothing. It’s easier to spot differences between the patch and the 
surrounding face than it is to spot those between the sweater and 
its patches. Even so, facial scratches are best handled by using the 
Free Select tool, as we’ve done so far. The main difference is that 
you must make even smaller selections, bounded by high-contrast 
lines. Areas between the face and the hairline or between the 
bridge of the nose and the shadowed sides of the nose work espe-
cially well. The woman’s eye poses a particular challenge because 
that part of the image is so complex.
1.	 Make a selection of the eye, and copy and paste it to a new 
layer as a patch (Layer4To New Layer). 
2.	 Use the Clone tool to manually paint out the scratch. In this 
case it’s safe to use the Clone tool because we’re working on a 
copy of the original, blemished subject.
3.	 To use the Clone tool, first specify a clone source location by 
holding down the ctrl key and clicking the image. The click 
point indicates the region that will be copied from, so make 
sure it’s a reasonable match to the region you’re patching. 
Then, once the clone source is established, choose the clone 
destination. Click and drag the mouse over the scratch. The 
source is copied over the destination as you drag.
It’s more difficult to fix blemishes on faces than on clothing. The process 
is the same, but make careful Curves adjustments and blend your patches 
using layer masks.
When you use the Clone tool, the length and direction of 
the line between the clone source and the initial clone destina-
tion (where you first click when you start to clone the image) 
always remains uniform. When you drag a line over the scratch, 
that same line is cloned, positioned to start at the clone source 

2.8  Photo Restoration   103
location. This means that if you drag far enough from the initial 
clone destination, you can cause the clone source to fall over 
another blemish. The trick is to keep your brush strokes small 
and reset your clone source point frequently.
This scratch is fixed using several cloning operations, so more than one clone 
source is used. In fact, each clone source is used for a very small part of the 
scratch. This allows the cloned areas to blend seamlessly into the rest of the 
image.
It’s also possible to clone from another layer. In the Tool 
Options dialog, check the Sample Merged option. With this 
option you can clone from any layer that is being used to display 
the composite image.
Cleaning Up the Background
Cleaning up the background is a no-brainer.
1.	 Make a selection using the Quick Mask and an appropriate 
brush. Paint inside locks of hair where the background shows 
through. The painted areas (which are no longer tinted red) 
will become the selected area when you click the Quick 
Mask to Selection button in the lower-left corner of the 
­canvas window. 
2.	 Feather the selection by 15 pixels or more (Select4Feather). 
In previous tutorials the feather values were only 1 or 2 pixels, 
but higher feather values should be used when your image 
resolution is higher, as it is when restoring a photograph.
3.	 Use the Color Picker tool to select a color from the existing 
background inside the selection. Drag the foreground color 
into the selection to fill it with this color. This takes care of 
all problems in the background.
The background is selected using the Quick Mask instead of the Fuzzy Select 
tool because there’s too much variation in the background, which has faded 
so much that parts of it match the hair’s outside edges.

104   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
All the other large blemishes can be fixed with the same 
­processes used for the sweater and face. In this case, the final 
results are dramatic. When the original image is scanned at a 
high resolution, an image restored using GIMP’s tools should 
produce a high-quality print. The results won’t always be so dra-
matic, but with practice some people are able to make a living 
doing this kind of work.
A single pixel is chosen from the background and used to fill the selection.
Further Exploration
Professional image restoration depends upon proper use of selec-
tions and layer masks, but it also relies heavily upon other tools 
in GIMP’s arsenal, including the IWarp filter, Feather command, 
Curves tool, and Clone tool. As a process, image restoration 
doesn’t lend itself to automation, so designers who understand 
how to make the most of these techniques will always be in high 
demand.
Restoring old photographs is a time-consuming but reward-
ing process. In the next section, we’ll discuss a technique that 
requires far less time but is just as rewarding.

2.9  Casting Light Through a Window   105
2.9 
Casting Light Through a Window
Adding a light source to a photograph can increase the photo-
graph’s dramatic impact—especially when the light is shining 
through a paned window. But setting up a shot like the one shown 
here can be time consuming and usually requires a specific loca-
tion. It would be easier if we could use software to add the light 
source to any image.
Fortunately, GIMP allows us to merge multiple shots to 
achieve this effect. Start with any stock photograph and use an 
image of a window as a stencil for the shadow. The process is so 
simple, you’ll probably have more trouble finding suitable stock 
images than you will producing the effect in GIMP.
It would be difficult to set up a shot like this one, but GIMP makes it easy to 
merge two stock photographs and achieve a dramatic effect.
Getting Started
This shot was created from two stock photographs. The first photo 
shows a model posing against a wall. Let’s call this layer Source 
Image. The second image shows light shining through an oddly 
shaped window. Let’s call this layer Shadow Mask. You can certainly 
create a mask in whatever shape you like, but you’ll save time if 
you can find a suitable stock photo.
Two source images are used in this project. The window provides the shadow 
mask for the light you’ll cast on the model.
Setting Up the Shadow Mask
Start by opening up a source image and an image to use as the 
shadow mask, both from their respective stock image files. If 
only a portion of the shadow mask image is intended to cover 
the source image, make a selection around that part of the 
shadow mask image and paste it into the source image as a new 
layer. This example doesn’t require a selection, because we want 
to use the entire shadow mask image, so we can just copy and 
paste it into a new layer in the source image.

106   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
1.	 Copy the shadow mask image (Edit4Copy) and paste (Edit4 
Paste) it into the source image as a new layer (Layer4To 
New Layer) as shown here. 
2.	 Reduce the Opacity of the Shadow Mask layer to 65 percent, 
and then use the Move tool to position the window over the 
subject. The Shadow Mask was also scaled taller and wider 
with the Scale tool so only a single crosshair in the window 
is visible.
Copy and paste the Shadow Mask into the Source Image layer.
3.	 To make the window look more like a shadow, you’ll need 
to desaturate and blur it. Desaturate the Shadow Mask layer 
(Colors4Desaturate), and then open the Gaussian Blur 
filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian Blur). The Blur Radius 
should be set according to the image size. In this example, 
the Source Image is 2794 pixels wide, so the Blur Radius is 
set to 90 pixels. That gives roughly a 32:1 ratio, though you 
may find that a smaller ratio is more appropriate for smaller 
images.
A blur softens the light areas of the shadow mask, making it look as though 
light is being cast through a paned window.
4.	 Expand the Shadow Mask layer to fit the full image (Layer4 
Layer to Image Size). Make sure the Lock Alpha Channel 
box in the Layers dialog is not set.
5.	 Using the Fuzzy Select tool, click the transparent regions of 
the layer to the left and right of the window image. This may 
require multiple clicks with the shift key held down.
6.	 Grow the selection (Select4Grow) by 20 to 50 pixels.
7.	
With the canvas selected, press D to reset the foreground and 
background colors. Then drag the foreground color (black) 
into the selection to extend the shadow cast by the wall in 
which the window is set. If any lighter color lines are still vis-
ible along the edges of the selections, undo the drag (ctrl-Z) 
and grow the selection some more, and then drag from the 
foreground color again.

2.9  Casting Light Through a Window   107
After resizing the Shadow Mask layer to fit the canvas, fill the transparent 
areas with black. This works here because the area around the window is 
black. For other images, you may need to make some levels adjustments to 
the Shadow Mask layer first.
8.	 Deselect all (Select4None).
9.	 Set the Shadow Mask layer mode to Multiply. In this exam-
ple, the result is good, but more contrast would help. Use the 
Fuzzy Select tool and click in the darker areas of the Shadow 
Mask. Invert this selection (Select4Invert) to select just the 
windowpanes. Shrink (Select4Shrink) the selection a bit.
Select the windowpanes of the shadow mask, shown here with the Quick 
Mask enabled so the selection is easier to see.
Increasing the Light
1.	 Create a new transparent layer (Layer4New Layer) and call 
it Light.
2.	 Drag the background color (white) into the selection.
3.	 Deselect all (Select4None).
4.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur) and set the Blur Radius to 90 pixels.
5.	 Setting the Light layer’s mode to Overlay completes the effect. 
Adding a layer mask (Layer4Mask4Add Layer Mask) to the 
Light layer and applying a black-to-white gradient using the 
Blend tool softens the lower edge. It may also be necessary 
to apply a black-to-white gradient to the Shadow Mask layer, 
with the layer mode set to Multiply.

108   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
Fill the selection with white in a new layer.
The additional light layer increases the contrast between the shadowed and 
illuminated areas on the wall and model.
Further Exploration
To take this tutorial further, you might add shadows that are 
cast by objects outside the window. Imagine a tree, for example. 
Its shadow would also be cast through the window and onto the 
source image. The process for adding the tree’s shadow would 
be similar, except that the tree would be farther away and cast a 
lighter, more blurred shadow.

2.10  Light Streaks   109
2.10 
Light Streaks
Lighting alters the mood of an image. So far you’ve added light-
ing to a project by casting light through an unseen window. Now 
you’ll combine that idea with artificial effects. This project will 
add flowing streaks of light to a stock photo. These will dramati-
cally change the mood with only a modest amount of work.
There isn’t a great trick to this process; getting the best results 
is mostly a matter of trial and error. The process starts with a little 
understanding of how to create and stroke paths. Paths are dis-
tinct from image layers. This allows paths to be edited without 
affecting the composite image and to be applied multiple times 
to any number of image layers.
Light streaks are based on the application of multiple stroked paths to stock 
imagery.
n o t e 	
This tutorial requires some knowledge of using both the Paths 
tool and the Paths dialog. If you aren’t comfortable with either, 
check out Section 1.5 for a basic introduction.
Getting Started
The process starts with a stock photograph that’s dark enough 
that a streak of light will be a noticeable change. Creating an 
initial streak is a straightforward process with minimal edits of 
a single path.
1.	 Open the stock image. Add a transparent layer (Layer4New 
Layer) and name it Streak 1.
2.	 Choose the Paths tool from the Toolbox.
3.	 Click the lower left of the image to drop an anchor. Click the 
middle right side to drop the opposite end of the path. Click 
the path near each anchor and drag to bend the line and pull 
out handles from the anchors. Drag the handles to make a 
skewed S shape. 
This is the initial path to stroke. Multiple paths will be created from it and 
modified slightly to create the initial streak.

110   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
4.	 In the Paths dialog, click the Unnamed path and change the 
name to Streak 1.
5.	 Select the Paintbrush tool from the Toolbox. In the Tool 
Options dialog, choose the Calligraphic brush. Set the Size 
to 20, enable Basic Dynamics, set the Dynamics Options Fade 
length to 100, and set the Gradient to FG to Transparent. 
Enable a Smooth stroke of Quality 20 and Weight 50.
6.	 Type D, then X in the image window to set the foreground 
color to white.
7.	
To stroke the path, click the Paint Along Path icon (second 
from right) at the bottom of the Paths dialog. The Stroke 
Path dialog will open. Choose the Stroke with a Paint Tool 
option. Make sure the Paintbrush is selected and Emulate 
brush dynamics checkbox is checked. Then click the Stroke 
button.
The Stroke Path dialog is also found under the Edit menu (Edit4Stroke Path). 
Stroking the path allows to you apply a brush stroke to a specific shape—in 
this case a wavy line.
n o t e 	
The size of the brush depends on the size of the stock image, 
which in this tutorial is 1600 × 1067 pixels. Adjust the brush 
size so it produces a moderately thin stroke. Additional strokes 
in later steps will fatten the streak.
Adding an Outer Glow
The initial streak is a nice touch, but it needs to glow a bit, reflect-
ing some of the color from the stock image. The glow comes from 
duplicating, blurring, and then applying color to the streak.
GIMP doesn’t have an outer glow filter, so the process must 
be performed manually. Fortunately, an outer glow is a very 
simple effect.
1.	 Duplicate the Streak 1 layer. Name the duplicate layer 
Outer Glow.
2.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur). Set both Horizontal and Vertical Radius settings to 
20.0 pixels and apply to the Outer Glow layer. 
3.	 Duplicate this layer. Merge the duplicate (Layer4Merge 
Down) onto the Outer Glow layer.
4.	 Choose the Color Picker tool from the Toolbox. Enable the 
Sample Merged option in the Tool Options dialog. Click on 
the model’s face to pick a tone to apply to the glow.
5.	 Choose the Bucket Fill tool from the Toolbox. Set the Mode 
to Multiply, Fill Type to FG color fill, and Affected Area to 
Fill whole selection in the Tool Options dialog. 
6.	 Click the image window to apply the color to the Outer Glow 
layer. Move the Outer Glow layer below the Streak 1 layer in 
the Layers dialog.

2.10  Light Streaks   111
Duplicating the Outer Glow layer after blurring, and then merging the dupli-
cate is a quick way to increase the intensity of that layer by combining two 
sets of blurs into one. The duplicate layer mode could also be changed to 
Addition before merging to increase the intensity even more.
Adding an Inner Glow
GIMP doesn’t have an inner glow filter either, though several 
options exist in the Plugin Registry for those interested in using 
off-the-shelf solutions. Like the outer glow, however, the inner 
glow is very easy to produce manually in just a few short steps.
1.	 Duplicate the streak layer and name the duplicate layer 
Inner Glow.
2.	 Choose the Fuzzy Select tool from the toolbox. In the Tool 
Options dialog, enable the Select Transparent Areas option. 
Click anywhere in the image except on the streak to create a 
selection. Invert the selection (Select4Invert) to select just 
the streak. 
3.	 Drag the foreground color from the toolbox into the selection.
4.	 Shrink the selection (Select4Shrink) by 3 pixels. Cut 
the selection (Edit4Cut). This removes the selected area, 
leaving just a thin outline in the Inner Glow layer. Clear 
the selection (Select4None).
5.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter again. Apply a 5-pixel radius 
blur to this layer.
The inner glow is essentially a blurred outline of the original streak that varies 
the intensity of the streak.
Selecting and then inverting the transparent area allows 
selecting the entire streak. If the streak itself had been selected 
with the Fuzzy Select tool, the semitransparent areas might not 
have been selected. 
Enhancing the Initial Streak
This single streak can be improved by adding similar streaks to it. 
The process used to create the original streak is repeated, except 
that the path used will be an edited duplicate of the original path.

112   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
1.	 Open the Paths dialog. Duplicate the Streak 1 path by clicking 
the fourth button from the bottom left. Name the new path 
Streak 1B. Click the eye icon in the Paths dialog so the eye is 
visible. This will make the path visible in the image window, 
but without the anchors or handles.
2.	 Choose the Paths tool from the Toolbox. Click the path in 
the image window to show the anchors and handles. Click the 
anchors to move them slightly. Click the handles to bend the 
curve a little more or a little less. The changes to the Streak 
1B path should not be overly dramatic.
3.	 Add a transparent layer to the image and name it Streak 1B.
4.	 Repeat the stroke, outer glow, and inner glow steps from the 
first streak. 
The length and curve of the streaks are varied by editing copies of the origi-
nal path.
Further Exploration
The ends of each streak can be adjusted using layer masks on 
streak layers. Variations in the lighting of the streaks can be pro-
duced by changing layer blend modes. More dramatic streaks can 
be applied by varying the size of the brush when stroking paths.
Blurs were used in this tutorial to simulate glows around the 
streaks. In the next tutorial you’ll see how blurs can be used to 
turn the grown-up world into a child’s toy.

2.11  Miniaturizing a Scene   113
2.11 
Miniaturizing a Scene
An often underappreciated feature of GIMP is the blur filters. 
A small amount of blur can be used to soften the focus in a pho-
tograph, as was shown in Section 2.1. Section 2.5 demonstrated 
how varying amounts of blur can be used to move the background 
away from the foreground. And long blurs can apply streaks to an 
image that simulate high-speed flight.
This tutorial will use blurs to take the very big and make 
it appear very small. Even better, the process is very simple. 
This is yet another effect that gives a photo a shallow depth of 
field. Traditional photographers can achieve this effect with a 
technique called tilt-shifting. We’ll get similar results without the 
fancy equipment. 
From real world to small world is just a blur away.
Getting Started
The best images for this effect are bird’s-eye views of a city. This 
particular image is perfect because the focal point of the effect 
is centered and easy to isolate. Also, miniatures often have highly 
saturated colors from hand painting with glossy paints. This pro-
cess will increase the saturation of the stock photo, and then iso-
late areas outside the focal point of the image.
1.	 Open the stock image. Open the Hue-Saturation dialog  
(Colors4Hue-Saturation) and increase the saturation. For 
this image the saturation was increased to its maximum set-
ting of 100 percent. Apply this setting to the image.
2.	 Click the Quick Mask button in the lower left of the image 
window. This will tint the image red where no selection cur-
rently exists. 
3.	 Type D in the canvas to reset the foreground and background 
colors.
4.	 Choose the Blend tool from the Toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog set the Shape to Bi-linear and the Gradient to FG to 
BG (RGB), and leave other options at their default settings. 
Use the Reset button at the bottom of the dialog if you need 
to reset defaults.
5.	 In the image window, click the floor of the stadium and drag 
up to just above the top of the stadium. Click the Quick Mask 
button again to convert this to a selection of the image’s upper 
and lower regions.
6.	 Copy and paste the selection as a new layer. Name the new 
layer BG and FG.
n o t e 	
This image is 1600 × 1067 pixels. Adjust the blur radius 
accordingly for images of different sizes. 

114   Chapter 2: Photographic Effects
A Bi-linear gradient in the Quick Mask, running black to white, is all that’s 
required to select the foreground and background.
Blurring to Miniaturize
Using a copy of the original layer allows experimentation with 
the blur process without affecting the original image. If you 
mess up the copy, just make the selection of the original image 
layer again and copy and paste another new layer to continue 
experimentation.
1.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur). Apply a 20-pixel blur to the new layer.
2.	 If the first selection failed to select much of the foreground, 
make another selection with the Quick Mask and Blend 
tools, this time using a Linear Gradient instead. Drag from 
the stadium floor straight down to the bottom of the windows 
in the second floor of the stadium. Convert the Quick Mask 
to a selection, and then copy and paste as a new layer and 
blur again. Add a layer mask to this new layer and spray-paint 
black in it where the stadium and some of the greenery in 
front is out of focus.
A single blur will take the foreground and background out of focus  
and make it look like you’re zoomed in on a tiny model of the city.
Graphic design work is a series of little touch-ups  
like this foreground blur.
Further Exploration
This stock photograph provided a perfect example of the min-
iaturization effect. Other images are not so well suited. In those 
cases the selection may require alternative methods. Try using a 
Radial Gradient with the Blend tool, or the Rectangle or Ellipse 
select tools with large amounts of feathering.

Tips for Photographic Effects   115
Tips for Photographic Effects
Now that you’ve practiced the basic techniques for working with 
photographs in GIMP, you’re probably eager to get started on 
your own photo projects. When you do, keep the following sug-
gestions in mind.
Autolevel Option
You can autolevel all scanned and digital images using the Levels 
tool (Colors4Levels). This flattens the color histogram and auto-
matically makes the darkest pixels black and the lightest pixels 
white. But this isn’t absolutely required every time. If you don’t 
like the results, just undo it with ctrl-Z.
Sharp Scans
Nearly all scanned photos can benefit from a little sharpening. 
Digital photos don’t normally need to be sharpened, but scanned 
photos usually do. The Unsharp Mask filter (Filters4Enhance4 
Unsharp Mask) works best for photos, though you can also get 
good results using the Sharpen filter (Filters4Enhance4Sharpen).
Selections, Selections, Selections
Learn to love ’em (and make them effectively, as described in 
Section 1.4). When you’re working with photographs, you can’t 
do much without them.
Add More Contrast
Duplicate an image layer and set the new layer to Soft Light. 
Adjust the opacity to modify the contrast in the original layer. 
Soft Light and Overlay Modes
Add mood to your photos. Fill layers with any color on the color 
wheel and blend them using the Soft Light or Overlay layer modes.
Sepia Means Brown
Sepia tones are shades of brown, and they can lend your images 
an antique quality. Try applying RGB value sets like 124/81/61, 
140/89/51, or 181/145/124 to your photographs.
The Color of Kelvin
Are you using ordinary halogen lamps for indoor shoots? Light-
ing color is measured in degrees Kelvin, with the sun at sunrise 
being about 2,500 degrees and the sun at noon being about 
5,000 degrees (a bright white). A typical halogen lamp might be 
around 3,000 degrees, making its light a bit more yellow. Many 
photographers add a color-correction gel—which can be ordered 
from various online sources—to change the color of halogen 
bulbs. 
If you can’t fix a shot with proper lighting, you can try to 
digitally remove yellow tints from your photos using the Color 
Balance tool (Colors4Color Balance) or the Hue-Saturation 
tool (Colors4Hue-Saturation).
Experimentation
It can take a long time to make color adjustments to an entire 
image using tools from the toolbox. To experiment first, select 
a small part of the image and preview the color adjustments on 
that selection. When you’ve decided on the optimal values, undo 
the operation and adjust the entire image. Alternatively, try 
duplicating the image, scaling it down, and then experimenting 
with color adjustments on the smaller image.

W e b De sig n
Graphic designers see the Web as one more medium in which to 
present their work. Consumers see it as a place to buy music and 
sell used cameras and lawnmowers. Big business sees it as a plat-
form on which to develop new kinds of applications.
Any way you look at it, the Web has changed the world of 
graphic design. In the earliest days of the Internet, content was 
king, plain old HTML got the job done, and website design was, 
at best, a hack. These days, the best website designs utilize Cas-
cading Style Sheets (CSS). CSS is an established style sheet language 
that separates layout from content. This separation allows the 
designer to create visual consistency while somebody else works 
to create compelling content. CSS designs also make effective use 
of graphics, and that’s where GIMP comes in. It provides design-
ers with the raster images required by the Web. 

118   Chapter 3: Web Design
n o t e 	
css Zen Garden (http://www.csszengarden.com/) has 
some excellent examples of CSS in action and shows you how 
the same content might look in several different designs. 
One traditional limitation of the Web, at least from the 
designer’s point of view, has been its static nature. Animated GIF 
images were an early hack, but they didn’t provide real interac-
tivity. Today, Adobe Flash works well with raster images, but it 
also offers web designers a wealth of vector support. GIMP isn’t 
the best tool for vector work, but if your web designs use raster 
images, Flash and GIMP make a great team.
n o t e 	
If you’re interested in vector design, you can try Inkscape 
(http://www.inkscape.org/), another open source 
graphics tool.
Working in a Native Medium
Some of the previous tutorials have started with the default canvas 
size of 640 × 400 pixels. This has made it easy to re-create the 
tutorial image quickly, but you’d need to work with larger canvas 
sizes to make those images suitable for print or other media formats.
Well, that all changes now. Throughout this chapter, the image 
resolution of your desktop (72 ppi for most CRT displays or 98 ppi 
for LCD displays) will also be the image resolution of the medium. 
That means the images created in this chapter won’t need to be 
re-created at larger sizes. In fact, some will probably need to be 
scaled down (or re-created at a smaller scale) to be useful on 
the Web.
The focus of these tutorials will be the creation of simple 
graphics for the Web, specifically navigational aids, backdrops, 
advertisements, and logos. To find techniques for achieving more 
sophisticated photographic effects you can then incorporate into 
Flash or complex CSS designs, see Chapters 2 and 4.
GIMP Tools for Web Design
When working on the Web, you’ll find yourself using a variety of 
the GIMP’s tools and filters. Two of the tools you’ll use for nearly 
every project are the Text tool and Blend tool.
Most web pages are made up of text and images. The text is 
often composed in WordPad, OpenOffice.org Writer, or vi, and 
web developers assume that the reader’s browser will have access 
to the fonts required to display the text. The web designer can 
request a particular font, but if the browser doesn’t have it, the 
browser gets to choose which font it will use instead. Because the 
various desktop platforms (Windows, Mac, and UNIX/Linux) 
don’t all have the same fonts, you can’t guarantee readers will see 
your web pages exactly the way you do. In short, because the Web 
still doesn’t support cross-platform font management very well, 
you can never be 100 percent certain that the font you request 
will be available on the system running the web browser. 
n o t e 	
Support for web standards relating to typography is still too 
new for most web designers to depend on.
One solution to this problem is to use rasterized text for 
some text elements. Using the GIMP to render text into an image 
guarantees that everyone who sees the image will see it as you 
do. This little trick is only suitable for titles and small captions, 
however. It makes little sense to render entire paragraphs into an 
image because image files are much larger than text files, and 
editing the text would require working with graphics programs 
that aren’t as well suited to text editing as HTML editors. Despite 
this, it’s quite common to render text for headers, buttons, and 
title bars into images in order to guarantee that those elements 
will look the way the designer wants them to look.

Chapter 3: Web Design﻿   119
Creating a text logo in GIMP ensures that all the  
website’s visitors see the same logo, no matter which  
browser is used.
The Blend tool and the Bucket Fill tool make it easy to colorize 
images and clipart. Sometimes adding a splash of color is the best 
way to give your client’s ordinary image a unique identity.
Gradients are easy to create, but be careful when using them: they don’t 
work well in GIF images! If you use them, export your image as a JPEG or 
PNG instead.
All your web design projects will use multiple layers. In addition 
to the familiar Layers dialog and Layer menu, the Colors menu 
will play a big role as well.
If you’ve been following along, you should be quite familiar with  
layers by this point, but I’ll continue guiding you through the menu  
selections where appropriate.
Finally, when designing web interface elements such as navi-
gation aids, effective use of selections is crucial (see Section 1.4 if 
you need a refresher).

Gel Buttons
Website buttons come in many shapes, sizes, and colors. Not every 
button makes sense in every design. Rectangular buttons are popu-
lar because they can be changed easily without having to worry 
about how they blend into background pages. Gel buttons, on the 
other hand, generally require a lot of page space. Their nonrect-
angular shape also requires antialiasing the background color and 
makes it difficult to switch the background on a whim. Despite 
these shortcomings, many clients want websites with gel buttons.
Should you decide to use gel buttons in a web design, you’re 
in luck. They’re easy to create with GIMP. As is true of most 3-D 
effects, the trick is to play with light and dark regions to simulate 
depth and reflection.
This tutorial will walk you through the creation of a simple 
gel button. The technique is essentially the same for any type 
of gel effect. The tutorial in Section 5.2 shows a similar effect 
applied to text. Here you’ll see a more general version of the 
process, but the possibilities are endless. It’s not hard to imagine 
extending this effect to an oozing tube of toothpaste, for example. 
Just cycle the results through a wave filter.
A simple gel button
Getting Started
1.	
Start by opening a new white canvas window, set to the default 
width and height (640 × 400 pixels).
n o t e 	
If the default image window size is not 640 × 400, set it in 
the Preferences dialog and then restart GIMP. The 640 × 400 
default image size is used for many tutorials in this book when 
creating new image windows. 
2.	 Create a new transparent layer in this canvas by choosing 
Layer4New Layer and setting the Layer Fill Type to Trans-
parency. Name the new layer Light Pill.
3.	 Add vertical guides at 10 percent and 90 percent (Image4 
Guides4New Guide (by Percent)). Add horizontal guides at 
35 percent and 65 percent.
4.	 Choose the Rectangle Select tool and use it to create a selec-
tion in the center rectangle that’s outlined by these guides. 
In the Tool Options dialog, check the Rounded corners 
checkbox and set the Radius to 90 percent to provide a high 
level of arc on the ends of the selection. (The Radius speci-
fied is actually a percentage of half the width or height of the 
selection, whichever is smaller.)
5.	 Remove all guides (Image4Guides4Remove All Guides).
When creating this rectangular selection with rounded corners, Radius values 
greater than 90 have little effect on the curved ends.

3.1  Gel Buttons   121
Adding Colored Layers
1.	 With the canvas selected, press D to reset the foreground 
and background colors.
2.	 Click the foreground color icon to open the Change Fore-
ground Color dialog. Set the RGB values to 17/95/239 for 
the bright blue shown here, and then click OK to close the 
dialog.
3.	 Drag the foreground color icon from the toolbox into the 
selection to fill it with this color. 
You can use any name you’d like for the selection. You don’t even have 
to change the default name since this is the only saved selection in this 
tutorial.
4.	 Shrink the selection by 20 pixels (Select4Shrink) and save 
it to a channel (Select4Save to Channel). You can keep the 
default channel name, Selection Mask copy. 
5.	 Return to the Layers dialog and click the Light Pill layer to 
make it active.
6.	 Clear the selection (ctrl-shift-A).
7.	
Duplicate the Light Pill layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer). 
Name the new layer Dark Pill.
8.	 In the Layers dialog, check the Lock alpha channel box 
(the small, gray checkered box in the “Lock:” row). Click 
the foreground color icon to open the Change Foreground 
Color dialog. Set the RGB values to 11/0/97 for the dark blue 
shown here, and then click OK.
A layer mask is later used to allow the lighter layer to show through the 
darker one. 
9.	 Drag the foreground color icon from the toolbox into the 
Dark Pill layer. Because the Keep Transparency option is 
selected, only the pill should be filled with the new color.
n o t e 	
The colors chosen for this tutorial can be changed to any colors 
you choose. There are various color mixer utilities available on 
the Web that allow you to choose matching colors for your design.

122   Chapter 3: Web Design
Adding a Lower Highlight
1.	 Create a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New 
Layer and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name 
the new layer Lower Highlight.
2.	 In the Channels dialog, click the Selection Mask copy channel, 
and then click the Channel to Selection button (red square 
with dotted outline).
3.	 Return to the Layers dialog and select the Lower Highlight 
layer to make it active.
4.	 Feather the selection by 20 pixels (Select4Feather).
5.	 With the canvas selected, press D and then X to set the fore-
ground color to white, and then drag the foreground color 
icon into the selection. Clear the selection (ctrl-shift-A).
The highlight is made from the selection saved in the Channels dialog.
6.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian Blur) 
and apply a blur of 50 pixels to the Lower Highlight layer.
7.	
With the canvas selected, press M to activate the Move tool, 
and then drag the Lower Highlight layer down so its lower 
white edge just touches the Dark Pill layer’s lower edge. Set 
the layer mode for the Lower Highlight layer to Grain Merge. 
8.	 Click the Dark Pill layer. Select the nontransparent region 
(Layer4Transparency4Alpha to Selection), and then 
invert the selection (Select4Invert).
9.	 Click the Lower Highlight layer to make it active. Press  
ctrl-X to cut off any bits of the highlight that may over­
flow the bounds of the button when it’s moved down.
We’re beginning to see the 3-D effect, but you still need 
to bring out the highlights from the Light Pill layer showing 
through the Dark Pill layer. Do that with a layer mask on the 
Dark Pill layer. As a result, there’ll be more light reflection 
on the front of the pill and less reflection along its sides.
10.	 In the Channels dialog, click the Selection Mask copy chan-
nel, and then click the Channel to Selection button.
11.	 Click the Dark Pill layer in the Layers dialog. Add a white 
layer mask (Layer4Mask4Add Layer Mask), and then 
feather the selection by 50 pixels (Select4Feather).
The button starts to take on depth when soft lighting (the Lower Highlight 
layer) is added.

3.1  Gel Buttons   123
12.	 Press D to reset the foreground and background colors.
13.	 Drag the Foreground color box into the canvas to fill the 
selection with black.
A layer mask lets the light blue layer show through the dark blue layer 
and blends in with the blurred Lower Highlight layer.
Adding an Upper Highlight
1.	 Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer 
and setting the Fill Type to Transparency. Call the new layer 
Top Highlight. If it is not at the top of the layer stack, move it 
there by clicking and dragging it up in the Layers dialog.
2.	 With the selection still active and the canvas selected, press 
M to activate the Move tool. In the Tool Options dialog, click 
the Selection button (red square with dotted outline in the 
“Move:” row). In the canvas, drag the selection up until its 
upper edge meets the pill’s upper edge. Be sure to reset the 
Move setting to Layer in the Tool Options dialog when you’re 
done to avoid confusion the next time you use the Move tool.
3.	 In the canvas window, press L to choose the Blend tool from 
the toolbox. In the Tool Options dialog, choose the FG to 
Transparent gradient.
4.	 Press D and then X in the canvas window to set the fore-
ground color to white. Drag in a straight line from the top 
of the selection to the bottom.
The highlight comes from a gradient this time, so it blends with the Lower 
Highlight and Background layers more easily. 
Stretching the Upper Highlight
Reflections of light off of a shape like this one aren’t always uni-
form. To make this design more realistic, you need to stretch the 
upper highlight so it’s a little wider at the bottom. You can do this 
with the Perspective tool. This tool changes the angle between the 
sides of a rectangular area while keeping the sides straight. For 
an oval selection, imagine the selection is tied to the sides of a 
box bounding the selection. When the bounding box is stretched, 
the oval selection is stretched to keep it proportionally distanced 
from the sides of the bounding box. In this case you’ll be trans-
forming the layer itself, not a selection, but you’ll use the selection 
to create the bounding box used to perform the transform.
1.	 Choose the Perspective tool. In the Tool Options dialog, 
select the Transform option to Layer.

124   Chapter 3: Web Design
2.	 Click the canvas. Drag the bottom handles horizontally until 
the highlight touches the left and right sides of the canvas 
window. You may need to zoom out first before attempting 
this so you can drag the handles past the edges of the canvas. 
You may also want to reduce the number of guide lines to 1 
in the Perspective Tool Options dialog to make it easier to 
see the previewed changes.
3.	 Click the Transform button. Anchor the layer (Layer4 
Anchor Layer).
The Perspective tool is used to stretch the bottom of the layer.
4.	 Click the Light Pill layer. Select the nontransparent region 
(Layer4Transparency4Alpha to Selection), and then 
invert the selection (Select4Invert).
5.	 Click the Top Highlight layer to make it active. Press ctrl-X 
to cut off any bits of highlight that overflow the bounds of 
the button.
Adding Text to the Button
Now add some text to the button. Be sure to choose a legible 
font. I’ve used Utopia, set to 65 pixels and colored black. If the 
foreground is not black, type D in the canvas to reset it. (If your 
website will have multiple gel buttons, size the font so the longest 
piece of button text will fit comfortably.)
1.	 Clear the selection (Select4None).
2.	 Click the canvas and type Push Me.
3.	 Use the Move or Align tool to center the text on the pill. 
Make sure the Push Me layer is active in the Layers dialog.
4.	 Add a drop shadow (Filters4Light and Shadow4Drop 
Shadow). In the Drop Shadow dialog, set the Offset X and 
Offset Y fields to 2 pixels, the Blur Radius to 3 pixels, and the 
Opacity to 80 percent. Check the Allow resizing checkbox.
Add a text layer so the button can be used to navigate a website. The 
small offsets and radius make the drop shadow a very subtle effect.
Further Exploration
Remember that reflected light is seldom uniform across an object, 
even if the object is perfectly shaped. This is what gives brushed 
metal its appearance and why gel buttons don’t look like metal 
tubes. To achieve an even more realistic look, try adding nearly 
transparent shadow layers in addition to the highlight layers.

3.2  Metal Buttons   125
3.2 
Metal Buttons
The gel button technique is easy to master, but generating metal-
lic buttons is even easier. This technique is very generic and sim-
ple to reproduce, with the only variation coming from how you 
colorize the button in the last step.
In this tutorial, you’ll create buttons that fill the 640 × 400-
pixel canvas. In a real application, you’d probably scale down 
the steps in this tutorial to create smaller buttons. Alternatively, 
if creating buttons at such a small size is difficult, you can create 
them at the default canvas size and then scale them down to fit 
your website. If you choose to scale down the buttons, be sure to 
apply a little sharpening to bring out the reflective detail.
One simple process can be used to produce metal buttons of many colors.
Getting Started
1.	 Open a new canvas at the default size (640 × 400 pixels).
2.	 Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer 
and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name the 
new layer Button.
3.	 Choose the Ellipse Select tool from the toolbox. In the Tool 
Options dialog check the Fixed checkbox and choose the 
Aspect Ratio option in the menu next to it. Be sure the text 
field below this shows 1:1, which should be the default. Drag 
from the upper-left corner down toward the bottom-right 
until your circular selection is as tall as the canvas window. 
Make sure the selection is completely inside the canvas bound-
aries. Alternatively, set the Size of the selection in the Tool 
Options dialog to 394 × 394 and the Position to 123 × 3.
If the circular selection isn’t perfectly centered on the canvas, you can center 
it by clicking inside the selection and then dragging the selection to the cen-
ter of the canvas. If the selection isn’t exactly circular, click the Reset button in 
the Tool Options first, and then set the Fixed option and try again.
4.	 With the canvas selected, press D and then X to set the fore-
ground color to white.
5.	 Press L to select the Blend tool from the toolbox. In the Tool 
Options dialog, set the Gradient to FG to BG (RGB) and the 
Shape to Radial.
6.	 Click inside the selection, about one-fourth of the width from 
the left side of the selection, and drag across the width of the 
selection. This creates the basic reflective highlight, but the 
reflection is a bit too perfect. (Recall from Section 3.1 that 
light reflects unevenly off of most surfaces.) The next step is 
to add some variance to this perfectly reflecting sphere.

126   Chapter 3: Web Design
When you click just left of the circle’s center and drag to the far side of the 
selection using a Radial gradient, it’s easy to achieve this 3-D effect.
Adding More Reflections
1.	 Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer 
and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name the 
new layer Darken.
2.	 With the canvas selected, press X to set the foreground color 
to black.
3.	 With the Blend tool still active, set the Gradient to FG to 
Transparent and the Shape to Linear in the Tool Options 
dialog. On the canvas, click the top of the selection and drag 
down to its midpoint.
4.	 Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer 
and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name the 
new layer Top Reflection.
5.	 With the canvas selected, press X to set the foreground color 
to white.
6.	 The selection should still be active, so shrink it by 10 pixels 
(Select4Shrink).
Adding a shaded area on top of the button increases the but-
ton’s shiny appearance.
7.	
The Blend tool should also still be active. Click the top of the 
selection and drag to its midpoint. Deselect all (ctrl-shift-A).
8.	 In the Layers dialog, set the Top Reflection layer’s Opacity 
to 75 percent. The light now reflects differently around the 
sphere, providing visual texture and giving the appearance 
of a smooth, glassy surface.
The Top Reflection layer sits above the Darken layer.

3.2  Metal Buttons   127
9.	 Duplicate the Top Reflection layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer) 
and name the new layer Bottom Reflection.
10.	 Use the Flip tool to flip this layer vertically.
11.	 Using the Move tool, with the Tool Toggle set to Move the 
active layer in the Tool Options dialog, drag this layer so that 
its bottom white edge is just above the button’s bottom edge.
12.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur). Set the Blur Radius to 5 pixels. Click OK to apply the 
blur. Set the Opacity to 60 percent.
The reflection layers, both top and bottom, can be blurred further for more 
dramatic effect. If the blur is more than a few pixels, be sure to use a mask 
to cut out any blur that might overlap the edges of the sphere in the But-
ton layer.
13.	 Click the Top Reflection layer to make that layer active.
14.	 With the canvas selected, press shift-T to activate the Scale 
tool. In the Scaling Information dialog, choose % (percent) 
from the measurement unit drop-down menu. Change the 
Width and the Height to 85 percent and click the Scale button.
15.	 Use the Move tool to realign the layer so its upper left is just 
inside the upper left of the button.
16.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur) and set the Blur Radius to 5 pixels. Apply this blur to 
the Top Reflection layer.
Though we don’t do it in this tutorial, duplicating the Bottom Reflection layer 
increases the contrast between light and dark areas and can create a flat-
tened appearance at the bottom of the button.
Adding Color
1.	 Click the Button layer in the Layers dialog to make that layer 
active.
2.	 Open the Colorize dialog (Colors4Colorize).
3.	 Set the Hue to 35 and the Saturation to 90. You can create 
countless variations on this basic button by modifying the 
Hue and Saturation settings for this layer.

128   Chapter 3: Web Design
n o t e 	
You use the Colorize dialog in this tutorial, but color can be 
added in a number of ways. You could add a new layer filled 
with color and set its layer mode to Soft Light or Color. You 
could also use the Bucket Fill tool on the Button layer and 
choose either of those same modes.
Use the Colorize dialog to put the finishing touch on the metallic button.
Further Exploration
Creating a colored sphere might seem like a simple project, but 
it’s important, and it can be the basis for many more sophisti-
cated designs. In fact, it serves as the foundation for another 
project in this book. Be sure to save this project as an XCF file 
(GIMP’s native file format) so you can use it again later.

3.3  Tabs   129

Tabs
Gel and metallic buttons can liven up a web page, but practical 
considerations are often more compelling design criteria. Round 
buttons can take up valuable screen space, for example. A more 
compact design might include the use of notebook tabs. Fortu-
nately, using GIMP to create tabs is even easier than using it to 
create buttons.
This is one of the most straightforward tutorials in the book. 
It only takes a few minutes from start to finish, and the effect is 
easy to reproduce. You’ll also learn how to create multiple tabs 
and colorize them in ways that help visitors navigate your website.
Tabs are small images, but they can affect your web designs in a big way.
Getting Started
1.	
Open a new white canvas at the default size (640 × 400 pixels).
2.	 Add vertical and horizontal guides at 10 percent and 90 per-
cent in each direction by selecting Image4Guides4New 
Guide (by Percent).
3.	 Choose the Rectangle Select tool from the toolbox. Select 
the Rounded Corners option in the Tool Options dialog and 
set the Radius to 25 percent. Create a selection in the center 
rectangle that’s outlined by these guides.
Use guides to make it easier to center the selection.
4.	 Remove the guides (Image4Guides4Remove All Guides).
5.	 Select Image4Guides4New Guide (by Percent) to add a 
new horizontal guide at 70 percent, just above where the cor-
ner begins to be rounded.
6.	 With the Rectangle Select tool still selected, in the Tool 
Options dialog set the Mode to Subtract (third from left 
of “Mode:”). Disable the Rounded Corners option in the 
Tool Options dialog. Drag a rectangular selection that passes 
through the existing selection and is bordered on top by the 
guide, and then press enter to accept the updated selection. 
We now have the basic tab shape.

130   Chapter 3: Web Design
The Rectangle Select tool’s Subtract mode lets you drag to create a second 
selection that’s then subtracted from the existing selection.
Adding a Gradient
1.	 Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer 
and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name this 
layer Tab.
2.	 In the canvas, press D to reset the foreground and back-
ground colors to black and white, respectively.
3.	 Select Image4Guides4New Guide (by Percent) to add a 
new vertical guide at 50 percent.
4.	 In the canvas, press L to activate the Blend tool. In the Tool 
Options dialog, set the Blend tool’s Opacity to 70 percent. Be 
sure the Gradient in the Tool Options dialog is set to FG to 
BG (RGB). 
5.	 Click the canvas near the top of the selection and on the cen-
ter vertical guide, and drag down to the bottom of the selec-
tion along the vertical guide to apply the gradient.
n o t e 	
Alternatively, press ctrl while dragging to keep the gradient 
straight.
6.	 Save the selection to a channel by choosing Select4Save to 
Channel. Name the saved channel Selection Mask copy. There’s 
no need to change the name for this tutorial.
7.	
Deselect all (ctrl-shift-A) and remove all guides (Image4 
Guide4Remove All Guides).
A gradient fills the selection.
Giving the Tab Some Depth
1.	 In the Layers dialog, click the Tab layer to make it active. 
Duplicate the Tab layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer), and then 
click the original Tab layer in the Layers dialog to make it 
active again.
2.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur). Set the Horizontal and Vertical Blur Radius to 7 pix-
els, and then apply this blur to the original Tab layer. 

3.3  Tabs   131
3.	 Click the Tab copy layer in the Layers dialog to make that 
layer active.
4.	 Open the Bump Map filter (Filters4Map4Bump Map).
5.	 Set the Azimuth to 180 degrees, the Elevation to 60, and the 
Depth to 30. Be sure to select the original Tab layer from the 
Bump Map drop-down menu at the top of the dialog.
6.	 Click OK to apply the Bump Map filter and rename the Tab 
copy layer Bump Map.
The blurred original tab is used to give depth to the copy layer.
Adding Color and Highlights
1.	 Duplicate the Bump Map layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer). 
Name this layer Colorized.
2.	 Open the Colorize dialog (Colors4Colorize). Set the Hue 
to 180, the Saturation to 90, and the Lightness to 70. This 
should produce a hazy, aqua-colored effect.
3.	 Retrieve the saved selection by clicking Selection Mask copy 
in the Channels dialog and clicking the Channel to Selection 
button (second from right) in the button bar of that dialog. 
Add a horizontal guide at 30 percent. 
4.	 Choose the Rectangle Select tool, set the Tool Options Mode 
to Subtract, and drag a box with its upper edge along the 
horizontal guide to cut off the bottom of the existing selec-
tion. (Be sure to change the Rectangle Select tool’s Mode 
back to Replace when you’re done.) Then shrink the selec-
tion by 10 pixels (Select4 Shrink).
Saving selections to channels is an easy way to re-create a shape long 
after the shape has changed.
5.	 Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer 
and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Call the new 
layer Highlight. Click the new layer in the Layers dialog, then 
set the layer’s Opacity to 70 percent.
6.	 Drag the background color (white) into the selection to fill 
the selection.
7.	
Deselect all (ctrl-shift-A).
8.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur) and apply a blur of 5 pixels to the Highlight layer to 
soften the reflected highlight.

132   Chapter 3: Web Design
Remove the selection (ctrl-shift-A) before blurring the Highlight layer.
Adding Text
The basic tab is now complete. Now just add some text.
1.	 Remove all guides (Image4Guide4Remove All Guides).
2.	 Select the Text tool from the toolbox. Choose an appropri-
ate font (this tutorial used Serif Bold set to 120 pixels with a 
black color). As when you choose a font size for button text, 
your font size here should allow the longest piece of tab text 
to fit. Keep in mind that a sans-serif font might be more 
appropriate if you plan to scale down the tab’s size.
3.	 Click the canvas to open the Text Editor. Type some text.
4.	 Use the Move tool to position the text in the center of the tab.
5.	 If you like, add a drop shadow (Filters4Light and Shadow4 
Drop Shadow). Set the Offset X and Offset Y values to 3 pixels, 
the Blur Radius to 8 pixels, and the Opacity to 80 percent.
After the addition of a drop shadow, the text appears to rest on a semi-
transparent tab.
Creating More Tabs
In the real world, web pages usually have multiple tabs. A colored 
tab could indicate the page being viewed while gray tabs represent 
other pages available to your website visitor.
1.	 To create a series of tabs, start by turning off the visibility 
of the Background, Drop Shadow, and text layers. Then 
merge the visible layers (Image4Merge Visible Layers), 
expanded as necessary.
2.	 Duplicate the merged layer and name the new layer New Tab.
3.	 Use the Move tool to move this tab to the left of the first tab 
you created. 
4.	 Resize the canvas (Image4Fit Canvas to Layers), and then 
resize the canvas window (ctrl-shift-J).

3.3  Tabs   133
5.	 Move the New Tab layer so it aligns with the left and bottom 
edges of the original Tab layer. The Align tool can be used 
to align the top edges of the two layers. Then zoom in, select 
the Move tool in the Toolbox, and use the arrow keys on the 
keyboard to make fine adjustments left or right.
6.	 Desaturate the New Tab layer if it should have a different 
color (Colors4Desaturate), and then colorize it using the 
Colorize dialog (Colors4Colorize).
7.	
Add additional text as needed, and then turn visibility back 
on for the text and Drop Shadow layers for your original 
button.
n o t e 	
If your Background layer doesn’t fill the entire canvas, you 
can delete it (Layer4Delete) and add a new white layer 
(Layer4New) that you drag to the bottom of the stack in the 
Layers dialog.
Fine adjustments to position can be performed by zooming in and using the 
arrow keys with the Move tool.
Further Exploration
Tabs can be placed on websites vertically instead of horizontally. 
Merge all visible layers, and then rotate the image 90 degrees 
counterclockwise (see Image4Transform). Making text that 
reads vertically (where the letters are vertical but the word reads 
from top to bottom instead of from left to right) is more diffi-
cult because GIMP’s text alignment features are limited, but you 
could use a carriage return after each character.

Website Banners
If you’ve got a small business on one of the many online collectives 
such as CafePress.com or Shopify.com, or a blog or business running 
under WordPress.com, chances are you need professional-looking 
banners and product images to go with your website. Fortunately, 
GIMP solves this problem in just a few short steps.
The primary requirement for banners and product images is 
the size of the image. Most web-hosting sites provide configurable 
themes so users can customize their web presence. The theme 
selected defines the specifications for images. This includes the 
banner at the top of the page, slide show images, and extras 
such as backgrounds or images for specific divisions within a 
page. The trick is to use theme specifications to create visually 
appealing product displays and a professional appearance that 
separates your site from the competition.
This tutorial will focus on the tasks involved in creating a 
professional banner for a website with an artistic and a technical 
focus. The processes outlined here can also be applied to images 
used in scrolling slide shows and static product images.
As with the Photographic Effects tutorials, much of the work 
with banners starts with stock images.
A professional appearance for a website starts with a high-quality banner.
Getting Started
The first thing to do is find information about the banner 
dimensions for the theme you’ll be using on your site. All ban-
ner dimensions are in pixels. Etsy.com, a shopping mall for 
handmade items, recommends a banner size of 760 × 100 pixels. 
Cafepress.com, a site for creating custom prints on a variety of 
products, suggests a maximum of 500 × 200 pixels. WordPress, 
an open source package for blogging and content manage- 
ment, provides a default theme that supports a maximum size 
of 940 × 198 pixels. Since it’s impossible to know what size dis-
play resolutions your visitors will have, it’s often wisest to keep 
the width under 1024 pixels. The height of the banner is usually 
restricted to the design limitations of the website theme.
n o t e 	
Banner sizes for the various websites are current as this book 
goes to press.
In this tutorial you’ll use the dimensions for the WordPress 
banner because WordPress is easy to install on the desktop, making 
it easy to test designs without having to access a remote shop.
Cropping the Background Graphic
1.	 Open a stock image at least 1024 pixels wide. This one comes 
from BigStockPhoto.com. It’s a fairly large and detailed 
image at 2536 × 2302 pixels. If necessary, zoom out (View4 
Zoom Out) to see the whole image.
2.	 Choose the Crop tool from the Toolbox. Drag an initial 
bounding box in the canvas, and then in the Tool Options 
dialog set the size to 940 × 198 pixels.
3.	 The image is so large that nothing meaningful fits into the 
crop boundaries. To fix this, scale the image by 50 percent 
(Image4Scale Image). Zoom in on the image (+ or ctrl-
shift-J if using Single-Window mode) if necessary. In the 
canvas, click in the middle of the bounding box and drag 
the box until it’s over the area of interest.
4.	 Press enter to accept the crop. The image will be cropped to 
the area selected.
5.	 Open the Unsharp Mask filter (Filters4Enhance4Unsharp 
Mask) to sharpen the image. Set the Radius to 3.5 and the 
Amount to 0.35. 

3.4  Website Banners   135
Scaling the image doesn’t change the scale of the crop bounding box.
Enhancing the Glow
The image colors are dull. We need to adjust the image to inten-
sify them.
1.	 Duplicate the Background layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer). 
Name this layer Desaturated BG. Desaturate the duplicate 
layer (Colors4Desaturate). Add a white layer mask (Layer4 
Mask4Add Layer Mask).
2.	 Add a Horizontal guide at 50 percent (Image4Guides4 
New Guide (by Percent)). Type D in the canvas window to 
reset the foreground color to black.
3.	 Choose the Blend tool from the Toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog set the Mode to Normal, the Shape to Bi-linear, and 
the Gradient to FG to BG (RGB). Drag along the horizontal 
guide from the middle of the image to near the right edge. 
Switch the Mode in the Tool Options to Multiply, then repeat 
the drag twice.
Allowing the colored tree to show through the black-and-white layer creates 
a simulated glow around one tree (shown here with a close-up to better see 
the effect).
Adding a Foreground Graphic
The foreground graphic is an open laptop computer. The back-
ground will show through the display of the monitor.
1.	 Open a stock image of a laptop at least 500 pixels wide. 
This one comes from BigStockPhoto.com and was chosen 
because of the high contrast between the background and 
the edges of the computer. That’ll make the laptop easier to 
isolate. Scale the image down to 247 × 185 pixels (Image4 
Scale Image), which maintains the aspect ratio.
2.	 Choose the Fuzzy Select tool with the Threshold set to 12 
in the Tool Options dialog. Click the white area outside the 
computer, then invert (Select4Invert) the selection. This 
will select the laptop and may include a small amount of the 
background. Use the Quick Mask to clean up the selection. 
Copy this selection (Edit4Copy). 
3.	 In the Layers dialog, click the Desaturated layer, on the 
image icon, to make the image layer active (instead of the 
layer mask).

136   Chapter 3: Web Design
The Fuzzy selection is not perfect because the contrast between the back-
ground and object (laptop) isn’t sufficient, so it needs to be cleaned up 
using the Quick Mask (shown here in red).
4.	 Paste (Edit4Paste) the copy into the glowing tree image as 
a new layer (Layer4To New Layer) named Laptop. Use the 
Move tool to position the new layer over the glowing colored 
section of the trees.
5.	 Close the original laptop image so it doesn’t get in the way of 
the rest of the tutorial.
Colorizing the Laptop
1.	 Desaturate the laptop layer. Click the foreground color box 
in the Toolbox and set the RGB values to 122/0/31. Alterna-
tively, choose a color from the Background layer using the 
Color Picker tool.
2.	 Choose the Bucket Fill tool from the Toolbox. In the Tool 
Options dialog, set the Opacity to 100 percent, the Fill Type 
to FG color fill, the Affected Area to Fill whole selection and 
the Mode to Soft Light. Click the canvas window over the 
laptop twice.
3.	 Change the Mode to Overlay and the Opacity to 50 percent. 
Click once in the canvas window.
4.	 Reset the colors by pressing D in the canvas window, then 
click once more in the canvas window.
If the colors for the laptop aren’t ideal, use the undo option (ctrl-Z) to go back 
to the desaturated laptop and try again using a different color and/or differ-
ent layer modes.
Opening a Window on the Trees
The next step is to allow the trees to show on the laptop monitor.
1.	 Add a white layer mask to the Laptop layer. 
2.	 Use the Rectangle Select tool (make sure the Mode is set to 
Replace in the Tool Options dialog) to draw a selection 
outline in the laptop display. The outline should be slightly 
smaller than the display, leaving a small black space between 
the selection and the laptop display frame. Feather the 
selection (Select4Feather) by 2 pixels.

3.4  Website Banners   137
3.	 Change the foreground color to a dark gray by setting the 
RGB values to 94/94/94. Drag the foreground color box 
from the Toolbox into the selection.
The trees show through the mask and appear to be displayed on the laptop 
monitor.
Exporting and Saving
Before exporting as a JPEG for use in the website, save the file as 
an XCF file. XCF is GIMP’s native file format, and saving the ban-
ner as an XCF image allows you to edit it later. After saving as an 
XCF file, export the image (File4Export) as a JPEG.
Further Exploration
Banner sizes vary from site to site and are presented in differ-
ent locations on the page. The Etsy banner for a single shop is 
smaller than the WordPress banner and is displayed off center. 
Choosing eye-catching components for the banner will draw 
website visitors to your content and away from the hosting site’s 
peripheral imagery.
Since font handling on the Web is still inconsistent, it can be 
useful to add text to the banner. By rendering text in the banner 
you’re assured it’s displayed the same by every browser on every 
platform. Future advances in HTML will help address this prob-
lem, but for the foreseeable future adding text to banners is still a 
useful practice.

Simple Logos
Logo design is one of the most enjoyable branches of graphic 
design. For a smaller or newer company, the logo needs to graphi-
cally express the company’s main product or purpose. For a more 
established enterprise, the logo might be a unique symbol that 
has come to be identified with that company and its products. 
Think of the Nike swoosh or the AT&T globe.
Because they’re small, logos are also among the hardest 
designs to create. Expressing a corporate identity in such a small 
space is never easy. Fortunately, with a small amount of work, a 
logo can say a lot.
Custom logos are a snap with GIMP.
On the Web, small and simple logos work best. At roughly 
72–98 ppi, this medium doesn’t leave much room for busy designs. 
Logos are generally small (but they don’t have to be), because they 
appear on all the website’s pages. When you scale down a large, 
busy design, detail can be lost, so it’s best to keep things simple.
GIMP provides tools to create logos of all types. For small 
companies with modest identity needs (web pages and perhaps 
stationery and business cards), these tools are often sufficient. 
For larger companies that will use logos in banner advertising, 
GIMP is best used only as a prototyping tool. You’ll want to trans-
fer the design to vector art later so that it can be scaled to large 
print sizes easily.
This tutorial will design a simple logo for a small, fictitious 
biotechnology company named Argonix. The design criteria are 
that the logo must be no more than two colors, must emphasize 
the company name, and must include a tag line and icon that rep-
resent the company’s association with bioengineered plants. The 
logo will be used on the company’s website and must fit in a space 
that is 400 × 145 pixels. The images for this tutorial are zoomed 
in to make them easier to see in print.
Getting Started
1.	
Type D in the canvas to reset the foreground and background 
colors. Start with a new white canvas sized to 400 × 145 pixels. 
2.	 Choose the Text tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog, click on the Reset button on the lower right, and then 
choose a serif font. I use Serif Bold Italic in this example. 
(A sans-serif font is easier to trace with a vector tool, should 
this design need to be converted to vector format later, but I 
prefer the look of serif fonts.) The choice of font should also 
reflect the requirements of the client. For example, grungy 
text might be appropriate for a gaming company, but it 
probably wouldn’t suit a home furnishings chain.
Creating Text
1.	 Click and drag in the canvas to create a bounding box for the 
text. The initial size of the box doesn’t matter. It will grow to 
fit the text as needed. 
2.	 In the bounding box, type the word ARGONIX, in uppercase, 
followed by a newline. Type the phrase Bioengineering for a 
hungry world. Don’t worry about colors or text sizes. These 
will be changed in a moment.
3.	 After you type the text, the Box setting in the Tool Options 
may have changed to Fixed. If so, be sure to set the Box type 
to Dynamic.
4.	 Double-click on the word ARGONIX to select it within the 
bounding box. In the Style Editor, type 55 in the Font Size 
field and hit enter. Click the Color button in the Style Editor 
to change the color of this word to RGB values of 207/0/0.

3.5  Simple Logos   139
All text for this project goes into a single layer. Previous versions of GIMP 
required multiple text layers.
The Style Editor allows changes to individual characters, words, or phrases. 
5.	 Select just the letter A in ARGONIX. Use the Style Editor to 
change the font size to 70 pixels.
n o t e 	
Remember that the Style Editor is the rectangular box of editing 
options displayed on the canvas directly above the text. This 
editor is new in GIMP 2.8 and is separate from the Tool 
Options and the Editor Dialog that can be opened from the 
Tool Options. See Section 1.8 for an introduction to GIMP’s 
text features.
6.	 Click three times quickly on the second line of text to select 
all of that line. Use the Style Editor to change the Font to 
Nimbus Sans L Bold or similar thin-lined font. Font selection 
in the Style Editor is aided by typing a few letters of the font 
name. The Style Editor will show a filtered list of matching 
fonts from which to select.
7.	
Use the Style Editor to change the font size of the selected 
text to 15 pixels.
Changing the font and size will change the alignment of the text within the 
bounding box. This will be fixed next.

140   Chapter 3: Web Design
8.	 The letter kerning in the second line will need adjust-
ment. The line should still be selected, so set the kerning 
field to 2.5 and hit enter. The letters will spread out slightly, 
nearly (though not exactly) aligning with the left and right 
ends of the first line.
9.	
Select just the first letter of the second line. Change the kerning 
value to −5 and hit enter. Now the ends of the second line 
should align with the first.
10.	 Optionally, adjust the line spacing for this text layer by set-
ting the Line Spacing to −20 in the Tool Options dialog. 
Notice that changes to this field in the Tool Options apply 
to all lines in the text layer, not just the selected lines.
The amount of kerning adjustments is tied directly to the font and font sizes 
you choose. Your project may require different kerning settings.
Adding Borders and Clipart
1.	 Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer 
and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name the 
new layer Borders.
2.	 Add two new horizontal guides at 15 percent and 85 percent 
by choosing Image4Guides4New Guide (By Percent). 
Then add two vertical guides at 5 percent and 95 percent.
3.	 Click the Paintbrush tool and choose Calligraphic from the 
Brushes dialog. In the Tool Options set the Size to 10. Click 
once at the upper-left intersection of the new guides. Hold 
down the shift key and click the upper-right intersection to 
draw a straight line between the two intersections. Repeat 
this process with the lower-left and lower-right intersections. 
We’ll adjust the text layer position later.
Use guides and a small brush to draw the horizontal borders in a sepa-
rate layer.
4.	 Remove all guides (Image4Guides4Remove All Guides).
5.	 For the leaf icon that appears behind the logo text, you’ll 
use clipart. Open any appropriate clipart file (there are many 
freely available on the Internet, but be sure to check the copy­
right license for their use in your projects). Be sure the clip­
art is a black-on-white image.
6.	 Copy the clipart into the logo project canvas as a new layer. 
Make sure the Lock Alpha Channel box in the Layers dialog 

3.5  Simple Logos   141
is checked for this new layer. You may need to scale down 
the art to fit the available space. In this example, the space 
between the two borders comfortably fits a clipart image 
that’s 90 pixels high.
7.	
Desaturate that layer (Colors4Desaturate).
8.	 Choose the Bucket Fill tool and in the Tool Options dialog 
set the Mode to Screen, the Opacity to 100 percent, the Fill 
Type to FG color fill, and the Affected Area to Fill whole 
selection.
9.	 Open the Change Foreground Color dialog again, make 
sure the RGB values are set to 207/0/0 to match the red 
used for the text, then close the dialog.
10.	 Click the layer to colorize the clipart. 
11.	 Assuming an original clipart of black-on-white, set the layer 
mode to Multiply. Otherwise, either choose a more appropriate 
layer mode to mask the background or select the background 
by color, add a layer mask, and fill the selection in the mask 
with black to mask the background of the clipart.
12.	 Use the Move tool to manually align the clipart layer between 
the top and bottom borders on the left side of the logo image.
A piece of clipart is scaled down to fit between the logo’s borders.
n o t e 	
If you can’t find appropriate clipart on the Internet, try 
looking for clipart books at your local bookstore. The Dover 
collections, for example, offer many images that can be 
photographed with your camera and easily cleaned up 
with GIMP.
Adding a Watermark
1.	 Click the Background layer in the Layers dialog to make it 
active.
2.	 Add a transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer and 
setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name the new 
layer Watermark.
3.	 Create a rectangular selection through the middle of this 
layer. The size of the rectangle makes no difference.
4.	 In the Change Foreground Color dialog, set the RGB values 
to 142/142/142 for a neutral gray and close the window.
5.	 Drag the foreground color into the selection, and then dese-
lect all (ctrl-shift-A).
The watermark starts as a gray selection in a layer placed above the Back-
ground layer but below all other layers.

142   Chapter 3: Web Design
6.	 To convert the new gray background into a watermark, open 
the Waves filter (Filters4Distorts4Waves). Set the Ampli-
tude to 85 pixels and the Wavelength to 50 pixels. Click OK 
to apply this filter to the Watermark layer.
7.	
Open the Curve Bend filter (Filters4Distorts4Curve 
Bend). Adjust the Upper and Lower curves so they form a 
figure 8 on its side, then click OK to apply them to the layer.
8.	 Open the Gaussian Blur (Filters4Blur4Gaussian Blur) 
and apply a blur of 1.5 pixels to the layer. Set the layer Opac-
ity to 50 percent.
9.	 If desired, use the Scale tool to stretch the layer larger or 
smaller. Then fit the layer to the image (Layer4Layer to 
Image Size).
Some simple distortions turn the solid gray rectangle into a wavy watermark.
Centering the Text
1.	 Click on the Text layer in the Layers dialog. 
2.	 Select the Move tool from the Toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog make sure the Move the Active Layer option is selected. 
Click and drag in the canvas to move the text layer left or right 
and up or down till it centers visually between the top and bot-
tom border lines. You may find it easier to do this with the 
layer boundary turned off (View4Show Layer Boundary). 
Further Exploration
You might think that an alternative design choice for this project 
might have the first letter of the company name span both lines 
of text. To do this, the first line (without its first letter) would 
have its baseline adjusted to move it up, and the second line 
kerning and baseline would be adjusted to fit below this but to 
the right of the A in Argonix. However, the baseline adjustment 
will not allow the second line to overlap the first. Instead, the 
Line Spacing adjustment in the Tool Options dialog allows the 
second line to overlap the first.
Creating prototype designs in this way makes it easy to trace 
the image in a vector program later, should you need to scale the 
design for larger print media.
This is just one example of how you might create a logo for a 
small business. And the best part is there’s plenty of logo design 
work out there. Designing simple logos like this for personal use 
or for small businesses, lawyers, doctors, and other professionals 
can keep any graphic designer busy.

3.6  Icons   143

Icons
Buttons, tabs, and logos aren’t the only graphics found on the 
Web. Just like the desktop, the Web makes heavy use of icons. 
Icons help identify current position within navigable pages and 
provide easily recognizable references for commonly referenced 
sites. Icons can be used for brand identification or product labeling.
Icons can be created larger than their display size by letting 
the browser or JavaScript size the image for you. This automatic 
scaling isn’t recommended for large images, but with small icons—
especially on pages that use only a few icons at a time—it allows 
the icon designer to work with larger images. This makes it easier 
to create icons, because GIMP users can work in a larger canvas. 
If you want to speed the loading of your web pages, scale your canvas to the 
same size as the icon that will be displayed in a browser.
In this tutorial I’ll visit the icon world and walk you through 
the design of icons suitable for use on the Web. Only basic knowl-
edge of GIMP is required, such as using layers and understanding 
the default layout of the toolbox. No outside stock images are 
required. However, unlike previous projects, this project will 
require working with multiple GIMP canvases at once.
Getting Started
1.	 Reset the foreground and background colors by typing D 
in the image window. Open a new, 640 × 400-pixel image 
window (File4New). Click the background color swatch in 
the Toolbox to open the Change Background Color dialog. 
Set the RGB values to 121/121/121 and close the dialog. The 
black and gray colors will be used as the background gradi-
ent for the icon.
2.	 Add a transparent layer (Layer4New Layer) and name it 
Icon Background. Choose the Rectangle Select tool from the 
Toolbox. In the Tool Options dialog, set the Rounded Cor-
ners option with a Radius of 25. Draw an initial selection in 
the image window—its position and size don’t matter at this 
point. In the Tool Options dialog, set the Size to 274 × 240 
pixels and the Position to 183 × 80 pixels. This will be the 
icon size, plus some transparent padding. The size was com-
puted based on experimentation, so feel free to make this 
selection larger to create a larger icon.

144   Chapter 3: Web Design
The Tool Options for the Rectangle Select tool allow for precise positioning and 
sizing. Selecting the Rounded Corners option will display the Radius setting.
Adding a Gradient Fill
1.	 Add a vertical guide at 50 percent (Image4Guides4New 
Guide (by Percent)). 
2.	 Choose the Blend tool from the Toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog set the Mode to Normal, Opacity to 100 percent, Gra-
dient to FG to BG (RGB) with the Reverse option checked, 
and the Shape to Linear. Drag in the image window from the 
top of the selection to the bottom, following the guide.
3.	 Clear the selection (Select4None). Add a drop shadow (Fil-
ters4Light and Shadow4Drop Shadow) offset by 3 pixels 
and blurred by 5 pixels.
Using a gray-to-black gradient allows the icon background to serve as 
a wall against which an application-specific icon can be displayed.
Creating a Checkered Pattern 
1.	 Open a new image window that is 16 × 16 pixels. In the image 
window that opens, hit the + key 10 times to zoom in. 
n o t e 	
You can also zoom in on an image by using the zoom control in 
the status bar at the bottom of the image window.
2.	 Add a grid (Image4Configure Grid) with 4-pixel spacing 
for width and height. This divides the window into 12 blocks. 
Enable snap to grid (View4Snap to Grid).

3.6  Icons   145
3.	 Set the Foreground color RGB to 103/103/103. Use the 
Rectangle Select tool (be sure Rounded corners is not set) 
to outline and fill the blocks at the following row/column 
positions: 1/1, 1/3, 2/2, 2/4, 3/1, 3/3, 4/2, and 4/4 with the 
Foreground color. Press the shift key to add to the selection 
as you select each block.
4.	 Change the Foreground RGB to 67/67/67, then select and fill 
the blocks at the following row/column positions: 1/2, 1/4, 
2/3, 3/2, 3/4, and 4/1. If you selected all the previous blocks 
at once, then invert the selection to fill these blocks.
5.	 Change the Foreground RGB to 141/141/141 and fill in blocks 
2/1 and 4/3. 
The grid can be made visible with View4Show Grid, but with the Snap to 
Grid option set it isn’t really necessary, since the image is very small and 
zoomed in.
6.	 Export (File4Export) this file as IcondBG.pat to your GIMP 
patterns directory giving a Description of Web Icon BG. Open 
the Patterns dialog (Windows4Dockable Dialogs4Patterns) 
and click the Refresh button to add the new pattern to the 
list of patterns. Close the IcondBG.pat window.
Adding a Pattern 
1.	 Back in the icon image window, add a transparent layer and 
name it Pattern.
2.	 Click on the Background layer in the Layers dialog and cre-
ate a selection of the icon (Layer4Transparency4Alpha to 
Selection).
3.	 Click the Pattern layer in the Layers dialog to make it active. 
In the Patterns dialog (Windows4Dockable Dialogs4Pat-
terns), drag the Web Icon BG pattern into the image window 
to fill the selection with the new pattern. 
4.	 Add a white layer mask (Layer4Mask4Add Layer Mask) to 
the Pattern layer.
5.	 Type D in the image window to reset the foreground and 
background colors. Choose the Blend tool from the Tool-
box. Set the Opacity to 75 percent and the Shape to Radial 
in the Tool Options dialog. Drag from the top of the icon 
to roughly the middle in the image window. In the Tool 
Options dialog, switch the Shape to Linear and the Mode 
to Multiply. Drag from the middle of the icon to the bottom 
edge in the image window. Drag again from the top to the 
middle of the icon.
6.	 Apply the layer mask (Layer4Mask4Apply Layer Mask).
7.	
Clear the selection. Remove all guides (Image4Guides4 
Remove All Guides).

146   Chapter 3: Web Design
The checkered pattern gives the icon a textured appearance.
Masking the Bottom of the Icon 
1.	 Add a white layer mask to the Pattern layer.
2.	 Add vertical guides at 183 and 457 and horizontal guides at 
80 and 200.
3.	 Use the Paths tool from the Toolbox and place anchors 
on each corner starting at the lower left intersection of the 
guides, with one extra anchor just to the right of the first 
one. This will create five anchors.
4.	 In the Tool Options dialog, change the Edit mode to Edit. 
Click the last anchor and drag to the left to move the first 
handle out of the way. Click it again and drag the handle 
toward the upper middle of the icon. This causes the path to 
bend. Click the next-to-last anchor and drag right to move 
the first handle out of the way. Click that anchor again and 
drag toward the bottom middle of the icon. Click Selection 
from Path in the Tool Options dialog. Invert the selection 
(Select4Invert). Fill the selection with black.
Clicking and dragging on a line connecting two anchors will also cause the 
handles to appear.
Creating the Application Sphere
The icon backdrop is ready. Now it’s time to add application-­
specific identifiers. This can be done multiple times to create a 
series of applications using the same backdrop. 
1.	 Add vertical guides at 220 and 420 and horizontal guides at 
100 and 300. This makes a perfect square to bound a sphere.
2.	 Add a transparent layer and name it Sphere. Be sure this layer 
is at the top of the stack in the Layers dialog. Choose the 
Ellipse Select tool from the toolbox. Click the upper-left 
guide intersection and drag to the lower right.
3.	 Reset the foreground and background colors by typing D in 
the image window. Open the Change Foreground Color dia-
log. Set the RGB values to 74/164/75. Click the background 
color swatch in the Toolbox to switch to the Change Back-
ground Color dialog. Set the RGB values to 28/130/29. Close 
the color dialog. The green shades will be used as the gradi-
ent for the application sphere. 

3.6  Icons   147
4.	 Choose the Blend tool from the Toolbox. Set the Shape 
to Radial and the Gradient to FG to BG (RGB) in the Tool 
Options dialog and be sure the Mode is set to Normal and the 
Opacity to 100 percent. Drag from the center of the selection 
to the outside edge of the selection.
Unlike the shapes in other tutorials, this sphere isn’t shiny—yet.
Adding Highlights
1.	 Add a transparent layer and name it Lower Highlight. Be sure 
this layer is at the top of the stack in the Layers dialog. Shrink 
the selection (Select4Shrink) by 2 pixels. Reset and invert the 
foreground and background colors (type D and then X in 
the image window) so the foreground is now white.
2.	 Select the Blend tool from the Toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog set the Shape to Radial and the Gradient to FG to 
Transparent with Reverse button set, and then drag from the 
center of the selection to the outside edge of the selection. 
3.	 Add a white layer mask to the Lower Highlight layer. Reset 
the foreground and background colors in the Toolbox. 
Choose the Blend tool from the Toolbox and set the Shape 
to Linear and the Gradient to FG to Transparent (with the 
Reverse button turned off) in the Tool Options dialog. Drag 
in the image window from the top of the icon to the bottom. 
4.	 Change the Lower Highlight layer’s mode to Overlay. 
5.	 Add a transparent layer and name it Upper Highlight. Be sure 
this layer is at the top of the stack in the Layers dialog. Shrink 
the selection by 2 pixels more.
6.	 Choose the Ellipse Select tool from the Toolbox. Click in 
the selection in the canvas to activate it. In the Tool Options 
dialog, set the Size to 134 × 80 and the Position to 254 × 107. 
This creates a small flat oval selection at the top of the green 
sphere. Click over the selection to finish editing it.
7.	
Reset and invert the color swatches in the Toolbox to make 
the foreground color white. Use the Blend tool with a Linear 
shape and FG to Transparent (no Reverse) gradient, and 
then drag from the top of the selection to the middle of the 
selection.
8.	 Clear the selection.
A variation on this design might include rotating the Upper Highlight 
45 degrees to the left or right.

148   Chapter 3: Web Design
Adding the Application ID 
1.	 Choose the Text tool from the Toolbox. Choose any font—
Nimbus Roman No.9 L Bold (commonly available on Linux 
systems) is used here. Set the Font size to 160 and the Color 
to White in the Tool Options dialog. The font size might be 
different on your system depending on the selected font. 
2.	 Click the center of the sphere and type an uppercase G (for 
GIMP), centering it over the sphere with the Move tool. 
Icons are typically quite small. While you can certainly place more than one 
letter in the icon, avoid writing complete words or phrases because they’ll just 
appear as clutter if the icon is made smaller.
Further Exploration
To save the icon itself, delete the white background layer and 
use the Crop tool to crop the image, leaving a small amount 
of transparent space around the icon. Export the image as 
­GIMPIcon.png or GIMPIcon.jpg. Scale the icon down as needed 
before placing it in your website.
The background and sphere can be used to create a common 
theme for your icons. To reuse the background and sphere, turn 
off the visibility of the Text and Background layers, then merge 
the visible layers. Drag the resulting layer onto the Toolbox to 
open a new image with just the merged contents. Export this as 
IconBG.png. Don’t save as a JPEG because that format doesn’t sup-
port transparency!
Later you can reopen the image, add the text layer, and 
export as a new icon.

Tips for Web Design   149
Tips for Web Design
GIMP is a tool capable of producing high-quality images for any 
design project—no matter what the medium—and its core sup-
port for RGB and indexed images makes it ideal for web design. 
Keep the following tips in mind as you begin using GIMP to create 
images for your websites.
Use GIMP for Images, CSS for Design
GIMP gives you the tools to create website images, but you need 
something more sophisticated to provide layout rules and orga-
nize your creations for a coherent user experience. CSS is it. Web 
design is now as much about layout as it is about graphics. Good 
web design encompasses both CSS and GIMP.
The Right Units
Web design requires images intended for viewing on video dis-
plays. Most monitors today, including smartphones, use LCD or 
LED technology, so most images should be scaled to 72 ppi or 
98 ppi. Before doing web design work, be sure to set your resolu-
tion preferences (Edit4Preferences4Default Image) to 72 pixels 
or 98 pixels, instead of print units such as inches or millimeters.
Add Contrast Where Necessary
If you’re placing text over a background in an image bound for 
the Web, be certain there’s sufficient contrast between the edges 
of the text and the background. A low-contrast image might look 
good on a designer’s high-end display, but you can’t guarantee 
that all visitors to the website will see the image in the same way. 
Adding a drop shadow or outline can help separate the text from 
the background. A text screen is another option. For a more 
detailed discussion on screening text, see Section 2.7.
Avoid Busy Backgrounds
Backgrounds should be seen but not heard. A loud background is 
a bad design choice. If your eye is drawn to a background, chances 
are the background is distracting your visitors from the web con­
tent. To make your text pop, first reduce the contrast in the back-
ground image. Then desaturate the image and fill it with a light 
color using the Bucket Fill tool with its Mode set to Color or Grain 
Merge. You may need to choose a low setting for the Opacity.
Choose File Formats Wisely
There’s a reason so many different image file formats have been 
developed: not every format works well in every situation. If you 
have solid text in an image with no gradients, use the GIF for-
mat. Because it uses only 8 bits per pixel for color information, 
the GIF format works well for images that have only a few colors 
(256 or less) and strong contrast (like black text on a white back-
ground). The GIF format also provides lossless compression, which 
means it compresses the image as much as possible without 
sacrificing image quality. But skip the GIF format if you have 
photographs to display.
They’re better handled with the JPEG format, which was 
specifically designed for photographs based on how the human 
eye perceives color. Using 24 bits (three 8-bit RGB channels) 
to represent each pixel, the JPEG format easily handles up to 
16 million colors. Unlike the GIF format, the JPEG format’s 
compression is described as lossy, which means (theoretically, at 
least) that by using it you’re throwing away data. The actual data 
loss is usually trivial, however, and you can specify how much 
to compress an image, depending on the degree of quality loss 
you’re willing to accept. A bigger disadvantage for some GIMP 
artists may be that the JPEG format doesn’t handle transparency 
information. The GIF format does, but it can only interpret trans-
parency as on or off for any given pixel, leading to “stairsteps” in 
nonrectangular regions of your image.

150   Chapter 3: Web Design
The PNG format, on the other hand, can handle various levels 
of transparency and millions of colors. It also offers lossless com-
pression, so no data is sacrificed. Not all browsers fully support the 
PNG format, though modern browsers, such as those provided 
with Windows Vista, Mac OS X, and any recent Linux distribution, 
should have no problem. For example, some older versions of 
Internet Explorer can’t display PNG images if they contain trans-
parency information. If only all website visitors used Firefox!
Another option is to force visitors to use an external program 
to view your images. Firefox’s MIME Type Editor extension allows 
the visitor to configure external programs to handle various file 
types. Designers or photographers who provide sample hi-res 
copies of their work in private web galleries may choose this 
option. Full-color TIFF images might be appropriate in such a 
case, though thumbnail previews would still need to be GIF, JPEG, 
or PNG files because they would be displayed by the browser.
Choose file formats wisely. Using JPEG images for every 
project isn’t a good enough solution. And if you think choosing 
among these options is annoying, just wait until the Web (and all 
those browsers) finally support vector images. Viva la SVG!
Scan for the Web
If you can’t find suitable clipart on the Internet or in a book, you 
can always scan real-world objects, desaturate the resulting image, 
and then reduce the image’s color range using the Levels, Curves, 
or Posterize tools. Windows and Mac users have built-in system sup­
port for scanners. Scanner support for Linux is available from the 
SANE project at http://www.sane-project.org/. The XSane plug-in is 
required to scan directly from GIMP and is available at http://www 
.xsane.org/. SANE and XSane are included in most recent Linux 
distributions (such as Fedora and SuSE), though they still require 
manual configuration. Read the man pages or check the project 
websites for more information about configuring your scanner.
Subtle Gradients
The use of gradients in background images is generally over-
looked by visitors, but it can mean the difference between an aver-
age website and a professional design. Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 
used gradients in website buttons. Consider using extremely subtle, 
desaturated gradients in background images, with a light dusting 
of desaturated noise for texturing.
Transparency in Web Design
Transparent images using PNG allow for seamless blending 
with their backgrounds. CSS and JavaScript allow styling the 
background of images based on conditions, such as time of day. 
Mixing a well-constructed transparent PNG image with time-
based backgrounds allows the same image to be used for differ-
ent effects.
Choosing the Right Colors
Web design also encompasses the use of proper color mixing. 
Choosing a color scheme for a website is just as important as the 
images you display. Choosing the right color mixture has a lot to 
do with how color affects individuals though processes. Reds can 
be stimulating and incite aggressive behavior—or spur the viewer 
to action—while blues then to invoke sensitive responses.
Study the psychology of color’s effects on behavior when 
choosing a color palette for the Web. Search the Internet for 
online color-mixing tools. Here are some of my favorites:
Color Mixers    http://www.colormixers.com/mixers/cmr/
EasyRGB    http://www.easyrgb.com/
Export Safely
GIMP 2.8 changed File4Save so that it no longer saves to any-
thing but GIMP’s native XCF file format. To save to some other 
file format, use File4Export. If you’ll be using your image in a 
web design, export it to the appropriate file format: JPEG, GIF, 
or PNG. When you export a layered image to an image file for-
mat suitable for the Web, GIMP will automatically merge all vis-
ible layers. This costs you nothing in effort and won’t change your 
existing layered canvas. But don’t forget to save the layered version 
as an XCF file as well, just in case you need to edit the layers later.

A dv e r t i sing a n d  
Speci a l E f f ec t s
Advertising is about presenting a message to a target audience as 
effectively as possible, for the least possible cost. GIMP can’t help 
you rein in your media costs or identify your target audience, but it 
can help you present a compelling product message. The tutori-
als in this chapter utilize GIMP tools you’ve already encountered 
in this book, building on skills you’ve developed and teaching 
you how to apply those skills to common advertising tasks.
Print vs. Web
An advertisement’s destination dictates its design. Understanding 
the requirements and limitations of the destination medium is an 
important part of the advertising design process. Creating web 
ads doesn’t require as much time, effort, or computer memory as 
creating print ads, but the nature of the Web limits advertising in 
many ways.

152   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
Web ads are designed to be viewed on computer monitors, so 
the images are usually small and measured at the monitor’s reso-
lution, typically 72 or 98 ppi. Web ads are also displayed in the 
same RGB format in which the images were created. For these 
reasons, they’re a bit easier to create than print ads, but because 
the monitor resolution and screen space are limited, web ads 
can’t show as much detail.
In comparison, print ads are usually larger and measured at 
higher resolutions (150 dpi to 300 dpi), which require far more 
computer memory to produce. Additionally, print ads created 
in RGB generally must be converted to the CMYK format the 
printer requires. Because GIMP doesn’t currently support direct 
manipulation of images in CMYK, your ads will be created in 
RGB, and the conversion process will have to be handled by the 
printer or a third-party service bureau.
N o t e 	
If you’re not afraid of the command line, you can also try using 
the ImageMagick suite of command-line tools to handle image 
color conversion. If RGB images are built with the Little CMS 
(LCMS) library, the Convert tool can convert them to CMYK 
using International Color Consortium (ICC) profiles. Your per-
sonal printer probably has ICC profile files, and GIMP supports 
their use even if it doesn’t work directly with CMYK color.
Stock Images
Most web and print advertising work starts with stock images. 
Luckily, the Internet has opened up stock image collections to 
the masses and reduced the cost of those images in the pro-
cess. These images are ideal for use in web ads because they’re 
inexpensive, of reasonable quality, and available in many sizes. 
Most stock image collections provide images in GIMP-supported 
formats such as TIFF and JPEG, and prices on low-cost stock 
image websites like BigStockPhoto.com, iStockphoto.com, and 
CanStockPhoto.com range from $1 to $5 per image.
You can use low-cost stock images for some print ads, though 
for projects like posters and banners it may be best to use images 
from professional stock image collections instead. Professional 
stock image services usually offer much larger images, ones that 
are big enough to suit large-scale print projects. In addition to 
per-file downloads, professional stock image services may also 
sell complete CD collections or provide monthly subscriptions. 
Prices vary greatly, however. A single image might cost $80 to 
$200, while a CD collection might cost around $500. Websites 
like ThinkStockPhotos.com and GettyImages.com charge approx­
imately $199 per month and $1,200 per year for subscriptions.
Online stock image collections typically offer each image 
in a few different sizes. These image sizes are generally given in 
pixels, and you’ll want to buy the largest version of the image you 
can afford. This will allow you to scale down the image to a size 
appropriate for your project. Remember that the dots per inch 
(dpi) value for print ads (150 dpi to 300 dpi) is different from 
pixels per inch (ppi) for web ads (72 ppi or 98 ppi). An image 
that is 1,200 pixels wide is 4 inches wide when printed at 300 dpi 
for a magazine (300 dpi × 4 inches = 1,200 pixels), but it’s over 
16½ inches wide when printed at 72 dpi for the Web!
N o t e 	
In practice, there is no difference between dpi and ppi; both are 
references to points of color per inch. Dpi is generally used in 
printing, whereas ppi is used for monitors.
Another issue to consider when using stock images is licensing. 
Many low-cost stock image collections license all of their images 
for a wide range of uses, but some allow each photographer to 
specify his or her own license parameters. Professional stock 
image services have very specific licensing policies. You’ll need to 
read the licenses carefully to determine whether or not you can 
use the image as you’d like.
The issue of model releases is also tricky. A model release is 
written permission to use the likeness of a person, place, or iden-
tifying mark (such as a logo) that might otherwise have limited 
rights of use. Model releases are most often used in connection 
with photos of people and are required if the individual’s face is 
recognizable.

Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects ﻿   153
Most stock image websites require that anyone submitting 
a photo of a person also include a model release giving permis-
sion to use the likeness in other projects. A model release allows 
a designer to use a stock image for a wide range of purposes but 
protects the model’s image from misuse.
N o t e 	
A very detailed guide to model releases is available at http://
www.danheller.com/model-release.html.
Most advertising projects make use of stock photos.
Color, Contrast, and Grayscale
Flip through any glossy trade magazine, and you’ll see how 
color and contrast are used effectively in print advertising. GIMP 
offers several tools for enhancing existing colors, among them 
the Curves, Levels, and Hue-Saturation tools. Each of these can 
be used to add pizzazz to an image or to alter an image’s mood. 
The Brightness-Contrast tool is often used in conjunction with 
these other tools to make overall ambient lighting changes.
While color grabs the viewer’s attention, you can choose 
Colors4Desaturate to remove color from an image, leaving just 
contrasting white, black, and gray to achieve a subtler effect. 
The level of contrast in a grayscale image sets the mood: a high-
contrast grayscale image conveys energy, while a softly blurred 
grayscale image evokes a feeling of calm and lends the subject a 
sense of style and class. GIMP offers many tools for controlling 
contrast in grayscale images, including numerous layer and tool 
blend modes.
Use the Curves tool to increase contrast and achieve more dramatic lighting 
effects.

154   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
N o t e 	
Used in this context, grayscale is not the same as the Gray-
scale mode (Image4Mode4Grayscale). In Grayscale mode an 
image has no color content, because it only has a gray channel. 
In the case of desaturated RGB images, the color content has 
been removed, but because the image is still in RGB mode, 
color can be added back in.
Lighting plays an important role in advertising, whether the images are color 
or grayscale.
There’s another reason to consider desaturating images with 
GIMP: you can add color back in at any time—any color you 
choose. Colorizing a desaturated image is one more way to set 
the mood for an advertisement. A range of blues can be cold and 
harsh, while rich reds and yellows are warm and energetic.
Desaturated images (like the one on the left) are RGB images where the Satu-
ration is set to 0. The Hue and Lightness may be set to any value. The color-
ized images (center and right) result from changing all three settings.
It’s Up to You
GIMP gives the graphic designer many ways to create eye-­
catching advertisements. The tutorials in this chapter are less 
about learning new techniques than they are about practicing 
what you’ve already learned. Tutorials elsewhere in this book 
show you how to create 3-D images and reflections or enhance 
color and lighting. Try applying these techniques to stock pho-
tographs and you’ll soon find that in the hands of a creative 
designer, the possibilities are endless.

4.1  Creative Text Design   155
4.1 
Creative Text Design
The ordinary becomes extraordinary, with a little help from GIMP.
GIMP is first and foremost a tool for working with raster images. 
Most desktop users will prefer to work with GIMP when dealing 
with their digital photographs but might choose other tools like 
Inkscape or Scribus when working with text. Yet GIMP does a 
great job with text effects in ways that people might think can 
only be done with those vector applications.
In this tutorial I’ll walk you through a little text trick I 
stumbled upon in a design magazine. The goal of the project is 
to map an image onto text but keep the original image recogniz-
able. In the original magazine article, the process was handled 
using Adobe InDesign, a vector layout tool. It does clever things 
with text using boxes to align and block objects within the layout. 
Fortunately, this particular effect turns out to be even easier to 
produce with GIMP than with InDesign.
Projects like this have important periphery components 
beyond just the text. This design requires a source image with suf­
ficient color and contrast. Without color and contrast, the shapes 
within the image won’t be recognizable through the text. 
The project also requires a suitable font. The font should be 
thick and without any serifs. Serif fonts clutter the final image 
and in most cases won’t allow as much detail from the source 
image to be displayed, even when bold versions of the serif font 
are used. Serif fonts can also make text from the image difficult 
to recognize. 
GIMP’s text features make actual design possible in a few 
minutes, with a limited sequence of steps. Before diving in, take 
a look at some of those periphery issues.

156   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
Selecting a Stock Image
To start the project, select an appropriate portrait from one 
of the many stock image sites on the Internet. The one in this 
tutorial comes from BigStockPhoto.com. The picture should ide-
ally include two important features. The first is a solid-colored 
background. A multicolored or otherwise cluttered background 
makes it harder to isolate the subject of the image when you apply 
your text effect.
The second important feature is color contrast. An all-black 
image would work but would end up being mere shadow-filled 
text. For this project, I selected a woman in a black dress with 
enough skin tones to provide some color contrast. Later you’ll 
add to that contrast with a soft vignette. 
Choosing a Font
This effect works best with thick, straight-edged fonts (script fonts 
don’t show the image well, even when boldface type is used). In 
this tutorial, I’m using the ErgoeExtrabold Thin font, but any sans 
bold font, such as Tahoma Bold, will suffice.
1.	 Select the Text tool and open the Tool Options dialog 
(Dialogs4Tool Options). Near the bottom of the dialog are 
three options: Indent, Line Spacing, and Letter Spacing. You 
won’t be using the Indent option but will use the other two. 
2.	 Line Spacing sets the space between lines. You want to decrease 
this (to negative values) so the lines of text will be as close 
together as possible, without overlapping. 
3.	 Letter Spacing just sets the area between letters. This is simi-
lar to kerning but not exactly identical. Again, the technical 
explanation isn’t important here. You just want to reduce 
this setting (also to negative numbers) to reduce the space 
between letters, the closer the better.
All three samples are set to 51 pixels. Tahoma Bold is commonly available on 
Windows systems and available from the Wine Fonts collection under Linux 
or free font archives on the Internet. 
Adding a Vignette
Now you’re ready to start the tutorial. The first thing is to add 
a soft vignette. This makes the final image more colorful while 
keeping the woman’s shape recognizable. 
1.	 Add a transparent layer above the main layer (Layer4New 
Layer) and name this new layer Vignette. 
2.	 Choose the Ellipse Select tool from the Toolbox and draw an 
oval selection in the canvas around the girl. Then feather the 
selection (Select4Feather) by 100 pixels. 
3.	 Choose a warm color, such as the 231/127/35 used here, from 
the Change Foreground Color dialog that opens by clicking 
on the foreground color box in the Toolbox.

4.1  Creative Text Design   157
4.	 Choose the Gradient tool from the Toolbox. In the Tool 
Options dialog, set the Gradient to FG to Transparent and 
the Shape to Radial. Click and drag in the canvas from the 
middle of the selection to just past the top of the selection. 
Set the Vignette layer’s mode to Multiply. 
The vignette will add a splash of color to the final image. Experiment 
with different color choices to see how it affects the design.
5.	 A little noise can be added here for artistic effect, but this 
step is optional. Open the HSV Noise filter (Filters4Noise4 
HSV Noise) and set the Holdness to 2, the Saturation to 255, 
and the Value to 255. The default setting for Hue should be 
left at 3. Apply this to the Vignette by clicking OK. The noise 
will be applied within the selection and only to colored pix-
els, not transparent ones. 
6.	 Clear the selection (Select4None) and merge the Vignette 
and Background layers (Image4Flatten Image).
The vignette will add some additional color to the final image. Adding noise 
is optional and may not be visible, depending on the font thickness. 
Adding a Text Layer
The text used for this tutorial can be from any source. Since 
most of the text won’t be visible, it doesn’t help to use text you 
expect to read, though many letters will be legible. The text 
here amounts to 1,500 words from the Lorem Ipsum Generator 
formatted with no line breaks, which was then loaded into the 
Text Editor window. If this isn’t long enough, copy and paste it 
again below the first block of text. 
1.	 Reset the default colors in the Toolbox by typing D in the can-
vas. Choose the Text tool from the Toolbox and then click and 
drag in the image. This displays the editing box in the canvas 
where you can type text. Drag the handles in the editing box 
so it covers the girl and vignette. Click inside the editing box 
and paste the Lorem Ipsum text copied from your browser. 

158   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
2.	 In the Tool Options dialog, set the font (ErgoeExtrabold 
Thin is used here), size, line spacing, and letter spacing as 
discussed previously. (Set the font and size before changing 
the spacing.) You’ll also want the text in black so you can 
see it in the canvas. Set the line spacing to −12 and the letter 
spacing to −3. This is sufficient to push the letters up against 
each other horizontally and vertically without overlapping, at 
least for this specific font and size.
Initially the text may not be aligned with the rest of the image, but that 
can be fixed with the Align Tool.
3.	 Drag the Text Box handles so the text covers the entire image, 
making the bounding box larger than the canvas. 
4.	 Use the Align Tool to align the text layer with the top and 
left sides of the image window.
5.	 Make the text layer fit the size of the image window(Layer4 
Layer to Image Size).
With the canvas zoomed out, the text layer is visibly larger than the background 
layer. This will provide some flexibility to find just the right fit for your mask. 
Creating a Mask Layer
Now you’re ready to create your mask. Unlike with other projects, 
you won’t use the Layer Mask feature of GIMP. Instead, this mask 
is simply a white layer over the text layer. What you’re going to 
do is paste over the original image with a white layer with text 
stamped out of it. Where the text is stamped out, the original 
image shows through. 
1.	 Add a white layer to the image (Layer4Layer New) and 
name it White. Drag this layer in the Layers dialog below the 
background layer with the woman in the black dress. Drag 
the text layer below the background layer too.
2.	 Click the text layer in the Layers dialog to make it active. Cre-
ate a selection of the text (Layer4Transparency4Alpha to 
Transparency). Invert the selection (Select4Invert). 

4.1  Creative Text Design   159
3.	 Click the White layer in the Layers dialog to make it active. 
Copy the selection (Edit4Copy). Paste the copy (Edit4 
Paste). This creates a Floating Selection in the Layers dia-
log. Convert this to a new layer (Layer4To New Layer).
4.	 Turn off the visibility of the text layer by clicking the Eye icon 
to the left of the layer thumbnail in the Layers dialog.
5.	 Click the Original layer containing the woman in the ­Layers 
dialog to make it active. Choose the Move tool from the Tool-
box. Hold down the shift key and click and drag in the canvas 
to move the woman and vignette around under the mask. 
Zoom in, if necessary, to get a closer look at the result. 
This is the final image, except you may want to adjust the position of the 
mask over the background image. 
Further Exploration
Moving the source image around under the mask may not be 
sufficient to get a quality result. You may need to adjust the text 
layer font size or the line or letter spacing. You may even need to 
try a different font. If any of this becomes necessary, turn off the 
visibility of the mask layer first and then duplicate the text layer. 
Adjust the font settings in the text layer duplicate. Then repeat 
the selection, invert, copy, and paste process to create a new 
mask. Keeping multiple versions of the text layer and masks lets 
you compare the masks and return to the version that looks best 
without having to re-create it later.

3-D Package Designs
Three-dimensional objects are a snap to create using the Perspective tool.
Sometimes an ad needs to include a 3-D object that you don’t have 
available to photograph, such as a product package. There are 
many ways to use GIMP to simulate three dimensions. The most 
common method uses drop shadows to simulate a light source and 
add a sense of depth. But drop shadows only place one plane above 
another. They can’t add depth to the image itself.
Fortunately, light and shadows aren’t the only tricks available 
to GIMP users. You can also play with perspective. The Perspec-
tive tool in GIMP’s toolbox provides a simple interface that allows 
you to change the direction from which an object is viewed; for 
example, you might choose to view the image head-on or to rotate 
it and view it at an angle. If you need to use 3-D packages in your 
designs, it’s best to get familiar with the Perspective tool.
In this tutorial you’ll create a 3-D product package for a 
fictitious mobile phone manufacturer. You take a set of images, 
arrange them to form the front and sides of the box, align the 
sides, and then angle the box away from the viewer. As is often 
the case, you’ll save a lot of time if you choose stock images 
wisely. The actual layout and perspective changes are relatively 
simple tricks that bring the stock images to life.
This project is scaled for use on the Web, which generally 
uses 98 ppi for images. To produce the same effect for a print 
project, leave the original canvas at 300 dpi and scale up the 
processes accordingly.
Preparing the Front of the Box
1.	
Open a new canvas window by choosing File4New in the tool-
box. In the Create a New Image dialog that pops up, choose 
the US Letter template. Making this choice will change the 
settings in the Advanced Options section. For this project, 
which is bound for the Web, change the resolution to 98 ppi.
2.	 Add a vertical guide (Image4Guides4New Guide (by 
­Percent)) centered on the canvas. This will be a visual cue 
to center the stock photos on opposite sides of the canvas.

4.2  3-D Package Designs   161
3.	 Open your two stock images and scale each one to about 
5 inches wide—a little more than half the width of the new 
canvas (Image4Scale Image). In this example I use a photo 
of an older-model mobile phone and a photo of someone 
using a phone. 
You can scale the stock images before you copy and paste them, or you 
can copy and paste them and then scale the new layers by choosing 
Layer4Scale Layer. Use the method easier for you, because the result 
will be the same.
4.	 Copy and paste each stock image into the canvas as a new 
layer by choosing Layer4New Layer after pasting each image. 
Name one layer Mobile Phone and the other layer Girl.
5.	 Use the Alignment tool from the Toolbox to left-align the 
Mobile Phone layer and to right-align the Girl layer, both 
along the bottom edge of the canvas. To use this tool, first 
choose the tool, and then click the layer in the canvas. Using 
the arrow buttons in the Tool Options dialog, align the layer 
relative to the image at the correct canvas edges.
6.	 Arrange the layer stack so the Mobile Phone layer is on top in 
the Layers dialog. If necessary, use the Move tool to manually 
adjust the Mobile Phone layer so the phone is roughly centered 
on the left half of the canvas.
7.	
Click the Mobile Phone layer in the Layers dialog.
8.	 Add a white layer mask (Layer4Mask4Add Layer Mask).
9.	 Use the Rectangle Select tool to create a selection to the 
right of the guide that encloses the Girl layer.
The layer mask on the Mobile Phone layer is used to mask out any part 
of the layer overlapping the right half of the canvas. 
10.	 With the canvas selected, press D to reset the foreground and 
background colors to black and white, respectively.
11.	 Make sure the layer mask is still active for the Mobile Phone 
layer by clicking the mask, and then drag the foreground 
color (black) from the toolbox into the selection. This will 
mask out the part of this layer overlapping the Girl layer. 
12.	 Clear the selection (Select4None).
13.	 With the Girl layer now properly visible, be sure to  center the 
image of the girl on the right half of the canvas as necessary.

162   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
When the Girl layer is active in the Layers dialog, that layer’s left edge is 
hidden by the Mobile Phone layer. There’s no need to trim off that portion of 
the Girl layer because it’ll never be seen.
N o t e 	
Another way to test if the layer mask is active is to check 
whether the layer boundary in the canvas is green instead 
of yellow.
Creating a Patch
At this point we need to remove the white strap on the girl’s shirt 
because it distracts from the image. (Even if the image you’re 
using for this project doesn’t require a similar fix, you can use 
this technique whenever you need to remove some distracting 
element.) While coloring the strap is an option, a much simpler 
solution is to clone some of the girl’s hair and use it to cover 
the strap.
N o t e 	
For more cloning practice, see Section 2.8.
1.	 Turn off the visibility of the Mobile Phone layer in the Layers 
dialog while patching the Girl layer. Click the Girl layer to 
make it active.
2.	 Zoom in on the image and use the Free Select tool to draw a 
selection around the white strap. Use the Move tool, chang-
ing to Selection in the Tool Options dialog, to drag the selec-
tion up till it covers just the girl’s hair. 
3.	 Feather the selection by 3 pixels (Select4Feather), and then 
copy and paste it as a new layer (Layer4To New Layer). 
4.	 In the Layers dialog, move the new layer down to just above 
the Girl layer, and then use the Move tool, changing back to 
Layer in the Tool Options dialog, to position the new layer so 
it covers the white strap. 
5.	 Add a white layer mask, and then use the Airbrush tool to 
paint black over the patch and blend the new layer with the 
original image.
6.	 Merge down (Layer4Merge Down) the patch layer with the 
original Girl layer.
7.	
Turn the visibility of the Mobile Phone layer back on.
It’s difficult to spot the patch because it blends so well with the Girl layer.

Adding Text to the Front of the Box
Now that the images have been cleaned up, you can create the 
upper half of the package, the portion that contains the prod-
uct text.
1.	 Click the Background layer to make it active.
2.	 Click the foreground color box to open the Change Fore-
ground Color dialog. Set the RGB values to 6/6/155 for the 
blue shown here, and then click OK to apply the change.
3.	 Drag the foreground color into the Background layer to add 
a blue bar that runs across the top of the box.
The product name will be placed inside the blue bar that runs across the top 
of the box.
4.	 Choose the Text tool from the toolbox. With the canvas 
selected, press D and then X to reset and then swap the 
foreground and background colors. Choose an appropriate 
font and size for the product name and description—I used 
Nimbus Roman No9 L Italic sized to 90 pixels.
5.	 Click the canvas to open the Text Editor window. Type a fic-
titious manufacturer name and model number like Nekioba 
VXS-1756.
6.	 Use the Move tool to center the text layer manually, and then 
add another text layer containing some descriptive text set in 
smaller type. 
7.	
Save this image as front.xcf, and then flatten the image 
(Image4Flatten Image). Scale the image (Image4Scale 
Image) to 80 percent of its current size.
Use a larger font for the manufacturer name and model number. Tag lines fill 
the empty space below.

164   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
Creating the Side of the Box
1.	 Open a new image, again using the US Letter template set to 
98 ppi. Scale down this canvas to 3 inches in width but leave 
the height at 11 inches.
2.	 Click the foreground color box and select the blue used earlier 
from the presets or set the RGB values to 6/6/155. Close the 
Change Foreground Color dialog, and then drag the fore-
ground color onto the new canvas. If you like, add another 
stock photo to the bottom of the canvas.
If you add a stock photo, scale it to slightly more than half the height of 
the new image and align its bottom edge with the image window. Use 
Layer4Layer to Image Size to crop the stock photo layer to the size of 
the image window.
3.	 With the canvas selected, press D and then X to reset the 
foreground color to white.
4.	 Choose the Text tool from the toolbox. Choose an appropri-
ate font and size—I used Nimbus Roman No9 L Italic sized 
to 40 pixels. Retype the text that appears on the front of the 
box, or modify it if you prefer.
5.	 Rotate the text layer counterclockwise by 90 degrees (Layer4 
Transform4Rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise) and then 
use the Move tool to manually position the text in the blue 
area on the side of the package.
6.	 Save this image as side.xcf.
7.	
Flatten the image (Image4Flatten Image) and then scale 
down the image to 80 percent of its original size.
First create the text for the side of the package, and then rotate the text. If the 
text doesn’t fit the space well, press ctrl-Z to undo the rotation, choose the 
Text tool from the Toolbox, click the text layer, adjust the text in the Tool 
Options dialog, and rotate the text once more.
Merging the Front and Side Panels
1.	 With the toolbox selected, press D to reset the background 
color to white. Open a new white canvas using the US Letter 
template set to 98 ppi.
2.	 Copy and paste the front and side images into this canvas 
as new layers (Layer4To New Layer). Name the new layers 
Front and Side, respectively.

4.2  3-D Package Designs   165
3.	 Add a vertical guide 3 inches (3 × 98 = 294 pixels) from the 
left edge and then add a horizontal guide 1 inch from the top.
4.	 Click the Front layer and use the Move tool to align the left 
and top edges of the layer with the intersection of the guides. 
Click the Side layer and drag to align the right and top edges 
of that layer with the intersection of the guides. Both images 
will fit on the canvas vertically. Don’t worry if the sides spill 
over the edges of the canvas. Just press the minus key to zoom 
out and make it easier to work on the canvas.
You can also drag guides out of the rulers, though by default the rulers 
measure in pixels. You can change the units of measure by choosing 
from the drop-down menu in the lower-left corner of the canvas window.
5.	 Add another vertical guide at 8 inches. This marks where the 
front right edge of the box will end up.
6.	 Click the Front layer in the Layers dialog to make it active.
7.	
Choose the Perspective tool from the toolbox, and then click 
the canvas. Drag the top and bottom control points on the 
right side of the Front layer toward the horizontal center of the 
canvas until they line up with the vertical guide at 8 inches 
and slightly toward the vertical center of the image. Click the 
Transform button in the Perspective Transform dialog to 
apply the changes.
A perspective transformation makes the front of the box appear to be 
closer on the left and farther away on the right, as it would be if the box 
were angled away from the viewer.
8.	 Add a vertical guide 1.5 inches from the left edge of the can-
vas to mark where the left side edge of the box will end up.
9.	 Click the Side layer in the Layers dialog to make it active.
10.	 Choose the Perspective tool from the toolbox, and then click 
the canvas. Drag the top and bottom control points on the 
image’s left side toward the horizontal center of the canvas 
until they line up with the vertical guide at 1.5 inches and 
slightly toward the vertical center of the image.

166   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
Adding perspective to the side panel transforms the flat images into a realistic 
box. But we’re not quite done with this project.
Cleaning Up the Edges
1.	 Remove all guides (Image4Guides4Remove All Guides).
2.	 Merge (Layer4Merge Down) the Front and Side layers by 
first clicking on the higher layer in the Layers dialog—this 
will merge the front and side panels into a single layer and 
leave the merged layer separate from the background.
3.	 Add a drop shadow (Filters4Light and Shadow4Drop 
Shadow), setting the Offset X value to 0 pixels and the 
Offset Y value to 12 pixels to cast a shadow that simulates a 
light source directly in front of and above the box. The Opac-
ity should be set to 80 percent so the background can show 
through it slightly. The Blur Radius is dependent on the size 
of the image. For this image, which is bound for the Web, a 
blur of 15 pixels produces a very soft-edged shadow.
A drop shadow gives the box an even more three-dimensional appearance.
Further Exploration
In the first edition of this book, this tutorial had additional steps 
to clean up jagged edges after the perspective transforms. The 
latest version of GIMP no longer has this problem, making this 
tutorial that much easier.
For added effect, consider changing the location of the 
shadow or adding additional shadows to make light appear to 
come from different directions. A rectangular selection modi-
fied with the Perspective tool, filled with black, and then placed 
behind the box with the bottom edges closely aligned can give 
the appearance of a light source shining directly on the front 
of the box and that the box is set atop a surface. Adjusting the 
brightness of the side panel is another trick that you can play 
with lighting in this project.

4.3  Reflective Glass   167

Reflective Glass
Advertising is a name game, and attention spans are running 
short. If you want to get your message across, you’ll need to 
establish the who and the what quickly. A logo is the centerpiece 
of a corporate identity, and it can do a lot to increase name rec-
ognition. While logo designs themselves are often quite simple, 
they can be placed near or inside other objects for added effect. 
Glass can reflect a company’s identity in a big way.
Glass effects are really just tricks with lighting and shadows. 
In previous tutorials you used lighting to simulate depth in an 
image. Shadows, too, provide a sense of depth by implying that 
another surface exists behind or below the main subject. Reflec-
tions can also be used to lend texture to a surface. In this tutorial 
you’ll learn how to use reflections to simulate a rounded, glassy 
surface.
This technique is easy to learn, but you may need to experi-
ment to get the reflections just right. The trick is to create cutouts 
from an existing selection. And notice the use of paths in this 
tutorial—the two endpoints of a path will be connected when 
they are converted to a selection, and in this tutorial you want 
the line between those two endpoints to be outside an existing 
selection.
Getting Started
To make sure that the default colors are being used, press D in 
the canvas area to reset the foreground and background colors. 
Start with a white canvas set to 640 × 480 pixels. The techniques 
used in this tutorial scale up easily enough, so it’s okay to work 
with a canvas that’s set to a small size and 98 ppi until you get it 
right.
Reflective surfaces can add an unmistakable polish to your logos.
Adding a Border
1.	 Open the New Guide dialog (Image4Guides4New Guide). 
Select Vertical from the Direction drop-down menu and set 
the Position to 40 pixels. Click OK to add the guide.
2.	 Repeat this process to add another vertical guide at 600 pixels. 
Then choose Horizontal from the Direction drop-down 
menu and add guides at 20 pixels and 460 pixels.
3.	 Choose the Ellipse Select tool from the toolbox. Drag from 
the upper-left intersection of the guides down toward the 
lower-right intersection of the guides so the selection touches 
each of the guides. (The selection should snap to the guides. 
If it doesn’t, verify that View4Snap to Guides is set.) 

168   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
Guides form a bounding box for the elliptical selection. Because the guides 
are precisely positioned, it’s easy to center the oval on the canvas.
4.	 Feather the oval selection by 3 pixels (Select4Feather).
5.	 Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer 
and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name the 
new layer Border.
6.	 Click the Foreground color box in the Toolbox to open the 
Change Foreground Color dialog. Set the RGB values to 
243/217/1 for a bright yellow. Click OK to set the foreground 
color, and then drag the foreground color from the toolbox 
into the selection.
7.	
You don’t need the guides anymore, so you can remove them 
(Image4Guides4Remove All Guides).
8.	 Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer 
and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name this 
new layer Edge.
9.	 Shrink the selection by 5 pixels (Select4Shrink).
10.	 With the canvas selected, press D to reset the foreground 
color to black. Drag the foreground color into the selection.
When you drag the foreground color from the toolbox into the selection, 
the yellow you’ve chosen fills the selection in the new transparent layer.
Adding a new layer filled with black does not change the yellow oval (shown 
here with a transparent background to make it easier to see). This allows you 
to make minor changes to the border width by modifying the black layer, 
even after you’ve completed the rest of the steps in this tutorial.

4.3  Reflective Glass   169
Creating a Glassy Surface
Now that you have a border, use the Radial gradient to create a 
glassy surface inside it.
1.	 Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer 
and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name this 
new layer Green Glass and be sure it’s at the top of the layer 
stack in the Layers dialog.
2.	 Shrink the selection by 2 pixels (Select4Shrink) to leave a 
thin black edge between the yellow border and green glass.
3.	 Click the foreground color box in the toolbox to open the 
Change Foreground Color dialog again. This time, set the 
RGB values to 17/157/43 for the bright-green end of the gra-
dient, and then click OK to apply the change.
4.	 Click the background color box in the toolbox to open the 
Change Background Color dialog. Set the RGB values to 
0/85/16 for the dark-green end of the gradient, and then 
click OK to apply the change.
The two shades of green are very similar, but the background color is a bit 
darker. Higher-contrast colors produce a surface that either looks more reflec-
tive or appears closer to a strong, tight beam of light.
5.	 Choose the Blend tool. In the Tool Options dialog, set the 
Gradient to FG to BG (RGB) and set the Shape to Radial.
6.	 Drag inside the selection from the left focus of the oval ( just 
left of center) to the right edge of the oval.
Shrinking the selection slightly and filling it with the Radial gradient simulates 
a curved surface with an edge that looks like it’s in the shadow of a raised 
yellow border.
Adding Reflective Highlights on the Right
The gradient already simulates lighting changes on the surface 
of the emblem, but adding highlights will exaggerate this effect 
even more.
1.	 Save the selection to a channel (Select4Save to Channel).
2.	 Click the Green Glass layer in the Layers dialog to make it 
active.
3.	 Add a new transparent layer named Highlight Right.
4.	 Reset the foreground and background colors by pressing D 
while the canvas is selected. 

170   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
5.	 Choose the Ellipse Select tool from the toolbox. In the Tool 
Options dialog, click the third button from the left to select 
the Subtract mode.
6.	 Drag over the existing selection to create a new oval that cov-
ers all but the lower-right and right edges of the selection. It 
may take a little experimentation to get this just right. If your 
first attempt fails, press ctrl-Z to undo the change and try 
again.
It may take a few attempts to make a cutout from the selection that comes 
close to the one shown here. Note that this new selection can be inter­
actively edited before hitting enter to accept the change it applies to the 
original selection.
7.	
Once you have the selection cutout just right, drag the back-
ground color box (which should be white) from the toolbox 
into the selection. Deselect all (ctrl-shift-A).
8.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur). Set the Blur Radius to 10 pixels for both the Horizon-
tal and Vertical directions, then click OK to apply the blur.
9.	 Reduce the Opacity of the Highlight Right layer to 20 percent.
10.	 Reset the Ellipse Select tool’s Mode to Replace.
The white area is blurred, then that layer’s Opacity is reduced. This immediately 
makes the rounded surface look more like glass.
Adding Reflective Highlights on the Left
1.	 Add a new transparent layer and name it Highlight Left.
2.	 Open the Channels dialog (Windows4Dockable Dialogs4 
Channels). Click the saved channel, which is the last item on 
the list. Convert this channel to a selection by clicking the 
Channel to Selection button second from the bottom right of 
the dialog.
3.	 Return to the Layers dialog and click the Highlight Left layer 
to make it active.
4.	 Choose the Path tool from the toolbox. Click outside the 
selection, and then trace a path similar to the one shown 
here. Make sure the first and last grab points in the path 
form a straight line outside of the existing selection. While 
holding down the ctrl and shift keys, click the Selection 
from Path button in the Tool Options dialog.

4.3  Reflective Glass   171
N o t e 	
If you have trouble working with paths, take a look at 
Section 1.5.
Holding down the ctrl and shift keys allows you to use the Paths tool to cre-
ate multiple selections that intersect the existing oval selection. These become 
additional reflections on the rounded surface.
5.	 With the canvas selected, press X to swap the foreground and 
background colors and set the foreground color to white.
6.	 Choose the Blend tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog, set the Gradient to FG to Transparent and set the 
Shape to Linear. Drag from the upper-left edges of the selec-
tions to the lower-right edges of the selections. Deselect all 
(ctrl-shift-A).
7.	
Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian Blur). 
Apply a blur of 3 pixels and reduce the Opacity of this layer 
to 50 percent.
8.	 Add a new transparent layer and name it Highlight Left 2.
9.	 As before, retrieve the selection by converting from the 
saved channel and then shrink the selection by 20 pixels 
(Select4Shrink).
After you apply a Gaussian blur and reduce the opacity of the High-
light Left layer, the surface of the object appears to be reflecting a panel 
window.
10.	 Click the Highlight Left 2 layer to make it active again.
11.	 If the foreground color is not white, press D and then X, and 
then drag the foreground color box into the selection to fill 
the selection with that color. Deselect all (ctrl-shift-A).
12.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur) and apply a blur of 5 pixels.
13.	 Add a white layer mask (Layer4Mask4Add Layer Mask). 
14.	 Open the Paths dialog (Windows4Dockable Dialogs4 
Paths). An unnamed path should exist, created when you 
used the Paths tool earlier in this tutorial. Click the Path 
to Selection button at the bottom of the dialog (fifth from 
the left).

172   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
15.	 Invert the selection (Select4Invert).
16.	 Click the layer mask in the Highlight Left 2 layer to make the 
mask active, and then fill the selection with black. Deselect 
all (ctrl-shift-A).
17.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur) and apply a blur of 5 pixels to the mask.
The layer containing the white oval will be merged with the Highlight Left 
layer in the next step.
18.	 In the Layers dialog, set the layer mode to Grain Merge and 
the Opacity to 50 percent, and then drag the Highlight Left 2 
layer down below the Highlight Left layer.
After you’ve created the layer mask, all that’s left of the oval highlight is the 
area overlapping the window-shaped highlights.
Adding Text and a Drop Shadow
1.	 With the canvas selected, press D and then X to set the fore-
ground color to white. 
2.	 Choose the Text tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog, choose an appropriate font and size. Click the canvas 
and type Griznak. Make sure the text layer is at the top in the 
Layers dialog.
3.	 Use the Align tool to center the text on the canvas. 

4.3  Reflective Glass   173
4.	 Add a drop shadow (Filters4Light and Shadow4Drop 
Shadow). Set the Offset X and Offset Y values to 2 pixels 
and set the Blur Radius to 2 pixels. Make sure the Allow 
resizing checkbox is not checked. Then apply the drop 
shadow by clicking OK.
5.	 Move the text layer and the Drop Shadow layer below both of 
the Highlight Left layers in the Layers dialog.
The text layer is positioned beneath the Highlight Left layers so the highlights 
can affect the drop shadow, giving the appearance that the text is under the 
glass.
Further Exploration
This effect works well with oval emblems such as this one, though 
there’s no reason why it wouldn’t work on a rectangular emblem 
as well. The key is the soft white layers that simulate reflections of 
light. These could be reflections of light coming through a win-
dow, or they could be the reflections of a nearby surface. 
The emblem could also reflect another object, as shown in 
Sections 2.6 and 2.7. Imagine this is a car dealership’s emblem and 
a car zooming down the road is reflected in it.

Popping an Image
Popping is the term used to describe filling a portion of an image’s 
background with white so the image’s subject seems to pop off of 
the monitor or printed page. Advertisements use this technique 
extensively. It works much as a type screen does, except that in the 
case of popping, the screen is a solid color and its layer is actu-
ally placed between the image’s subject and background.
This extreme tutorial will take your GIMP skills to the next level. Radical!
Getting Started
Much of the work in this tutorial involves using the Fuzzy Select 
tool to make a cutout of the subject—in this case, a skateboarder 
(sans wheels). The process is relatively simple because there’s a 
high contrast between the background and the foreground. Hold 
down the shift key, click a few times, and you’ll be able to select 
the background fairly quickly. This may not be true of the stock 
image you decide to use for this project, but the basic process will 
remain the same.
Isolating the Boarder
Start with an image of an airborne skateboarder with blue sky in 
the background. The image will be used to advertise a skate-
board invitational in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado. 
What’s missing in the original image is some indication of where 
the event will take place. Along with popping the boarder from 
the image, we need to replace the blue sky with a mountain 
scene.
The blue sky in the background makes for a nice photo, but it’ll need to be 
replaced for this project.

4.4  Popping an Image   175
1.	 Open the boarder image in GIMP and choose the Fuzzy 
Select tool from the toolbox. Hold down the shift key and 
click in various places to the left of the boarder and below the 
board until a nearly solid selection is made. Use the Quick 
Mask to fine-tune the selection.
2.	 When the entire area left of and below the boarder has been 
selected, turn the Quick Mask off and invert the selection 
(Select4Invert).
3.	 Shrink the selection by 1 pixel (Select4Shrink) and feather 
it by 2 pixels (Select4Feather).
4.	 Copy and paste the selection as a new layer (Layer4New 
Layer) and name it Boarder.
5.	 Open the Unsharp Mask filter (Filters4Enhance4Unsharp 
Mask). Set the Radius to 5 pixels and the Amount to 0.50. 
Click OK to apply the changes.
After you make the selection and copy and paste to a new layer, the Unsharp 
Mask will enhance the detail in the Boarder layer.
Enhancing the Board Details
The highlights under the board need to be evened out so the 
board doesn’t look so washed out.
1.	 Use the Fuzzy Select and Quick Mask tools to make a rough 
selection of the board’s bottom.
2.	 Grow the selection (Select4Grow) by 1 pixel, repeating this 
process until most of the board’s underside is selected.
3.	 Feather the selection by 3 pixels (Select4Feather). 
4.	 Use the Levels tool (Colors4Levels) to modify the white 
balance on the board by dragging the right-most slider under 
the histogram slightly to the left, dragging the left-most slider 
to the right, and making sure the middle slider stays centered. 
Modifying the black-and-white balance this way will brighten 
the darker areas of the board and make the hazy underside 
of the board appear clearer. Click OK.
5.	 Deselect all (ctrl-shift-A).
The bottom of the board appears hazy because of a problem with the lighting. 
Fix this by selecting the board and moving the left and right sliders in the Lev-
els histogram.

176   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
Removing the Background
We’ve isolated the boarder, but there are still patches of sky and 
clouds between the boarder’s legs and along the sides of his torso. 
These patches need to be removed so we can swap in the Rocky 
Mountain background.
1.	 Use the Fuzzy Select tool to make selections of the sky on 
either side of the boarder’s torso and in the space between 
his right arm and each leg.
2.	 Feather the selection by 3 pixels (Select4Feather).
3.	 Add a white layer mask (Layer4Mask4Add Layer Mask) 
and fill the selections with black. Deselect all (ctrl-shift-A). 
Apply the layer mask (Layer4Mask4Apply Layer Mask).
When we isolated the boarder, we left some patches of sky and clouds 
around the body. Use the Fuzzy Select tool to isolate those areas.
4.	 Add a new transparent layer and name it White Backdrop.
5.	 Pull a vertical guide from the left ruler until it’s just to the 
right of the boarder’s right foot. Unlike in other tutorials, this 
guide is positioned without an exact pixel location. Choose 
the Rectangle Select tool from the toolbox—be sure the 
Replace mode is set in the Tool Options dialog. Use the 
guide as the right edge for a selection covering the left side 
of the layer. Fill the selection with white.
6.	 Move the White Backdrop layer down so it’s below the Boarder 
layer in the Layers dialog.
7.	
Deselect all (ctrl-shift-A), and then hide the guide (View4 
Show Guides).
The White Backdrop layer is placed below the Boarder layer. This small 
detail is what makes the boarder seem to pop out of the Rocky Mountain 
scene and enter the white poster area.

4.4  Popping an Image   177
Adding a Drop Shadow
A drop shadow adds to the pop effect.
1.	 In the Layers dialog, click the Boarder layer to make it active.
2.	 Add a drop shadow (Filters4Light and Shadow4Drop 
Shadow). Set the Offset X and Y values to 5 pixels and the 
Blur Radius to 15 pixels. Set the Opacity to 80 percent and 
uncheck the Allow resizing checkbox. Click OK to apply 
these settings and create the Drop Shadow layer. 
3.	 Click the Drop Shadow layer in the Layers dialog. Add a 
white layer mask (Layers4Mask4Add Layer Mask).
4.	 Click the White Backdrop layer in the Layers dialog to make 
it active. Create a selection of the transparent region by 
choosing Layer4Transparency4Alpha to Selection, and 
then choosing Select4Invert.
5.	 Click the Drop Shadow layer mask to make it active. Drag the 
foreground color (which should be black) from the toolbox 
into the selection. This will hide the drop shadow everywhere 
except over the white backdrop.
6.	 Deselect all (ctrl-shift-A).
The drop shadow makes it appear as though there’s some distance  
between the boarder and the white background.
Replacing the Background
We want it to be clear from the advertisement that the event is 
being held in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado. Let’s add 
in the mountains as a background layer.
1.	 Click the Boarder layer to make it active.
2.	 Open an appropriate background image, such as this one of 
the Rocky Mountains. Copy and paste the image into a new 
layer (Layer4To New Layer) and name it Mountain.
3.	 Use the Scale tool to resize the layer so it’s as big as the canvas, 
then move the Mountain layer below the White Backdrop 
layer in the Layers dialog. Adjust the placement of the Moun-
tain layer as appropriate.
4.	 Open the Motion Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Motion Blur). 
Set the Blur Type to Linear, set the Length to 5 pixels, and 
set the Angle to 180 degrees. Click OK to apply these settings 
to the Mountain layer.
After you remove the sky background, replace it with an image that’s more 
appropriate for the project. A light motion blur adds depth to the new back-
ground and assures that the mountains don’t distract from the boarder.

Adding Text
It’s time for the finishing touches. Let’s add text to the poster. Use 
the Text tool and type your text in black using any font. Dupli-
cate the text and color the top version yellow. Offset the two layers 
by a few pixels to simulate depth. Make sure your text layers are at 
the top of the layer stack so you can see them over the layer masks 
and background images.
If the font and color you choose makes it difficult to read the text, you may 
want to add a drop shadow over the boarder’s leg.
Further Exploration
Projects like this are sometimes the most fun because they aren’t 
particularly difficult. As is true of many techniques described in 
this book, the hard part is creating good selections that isolate 
your intended subject. The Quick Mask tool is your best bet for 
objects that have many curves and edges, as this boarder’s leg does. 
If the object you’re trying to isolate has straighter edges and the 
background is a solid color, you can try using the Scissors tool.

Shiny Emblem
Whether you’re designing a T-shirt, a website, or a letterhead for 
the company office, you’re probably going to use some kind of 
identifying symbol. While printed symbols are often easier (and 
cheaper) to create in solid colors, designing for the Web allows a 
bit more flexibility. Color is king on the Web, and because high-
resolution, 16M-color monitors are the norm, three-dimensional 
effects are equally widespread.
Even a solitary letter can benefit from reflective techniques.
Symbols play an important role in design, and they can 
make or break a product or company image—better known in 
the graphic arts industry as an identity. The symbol itself may be 
flat and solid, flat and textured, or three-dimensional with light 
effects and shadows. Visual identities are the symbols of the com-
panies we know—just think about McDonald’s Golden Arches, a 
Red Hat for Linux, or IBM’s Big Blue.
Logos usually include text set in a specific font, which is often 
accompanied by a shape representing the company, group, or 
individual. As part of an overall identity campaign, logos are 
sometimes embedded within other shapes to create emblems.
One of the easiest emblems to create is a round, reflective 
logo that resembles glass. A glass logo uses soft gradients with little 
or no grain visible. Many white ovals (or partial ovals) are layered 
and placed over the logo to simulate reflections. Sometimes these 
round reflections are even outlined with distinct edges to simulate 
a frame in which the logo is set.
A metallic logo is even easier to create. The technique is 
based on the fact that reflections in metal aren’t as wide as reflec-
tions in glass, and they have more high-contrast areas between 
light and shadow. In the case of a metallic logo, the metal might 
be the focal point—as in a belt buckle or lapel pin—or you might 
just use metallic edges to accent a nonmetallic design, which is 
what you’ll do in this tutorial.
Getting Started
When you’re designing these emblems, it helps to examine real-
world objects like glass buttons or even silver spoons. Notice how 
the light and colors reflect. One trick is to blur your eyes a little—
try to see the reflections without focusing on the shape of the 
object. Then try to reproduce the effect with GIMP.
Adding reflectivity and color not only adds style to your design, 
it’s also incredibly easy to do with GIMP. In this tutorial you’ll 
work on a small canvas to demonstrate the ease of the technique. 
Remember that raster images—like those you create in GIMP—
don’t scale up to larger sizes very well, so start with a larger canvas 
and scale up the technique if you need a bigger emblem.
Creating a Metallic Border
1.	 With the toolbox selected, press D to reset the foreground 
and background colors to black and white, respectively.
2.	 Select File4New. In the Create a New Image dialog, set the 
dimensions to 500 × 500 pixels to create a square canvas. 
Click OK to open the new canvas window. 

180   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
A square canvas will allow centering a round emblem more easily.
3.	 Create a new transparent layer (Layer4New Layer) and 
name it Border.
4.	 Choose the Ellipse Select tool from the toolbox and make 
sure the Mode is set to Replace. Click and drag on the canvas 
to create a circular selection. In the Tool Options dialog, set 
the size to 490 × 490 and the position to 5 × 5. Click inside the 
selection to accept these settings.
5.	 Choose the Blend tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog, choose the Crown Molding gradient. Click and drag 
from the upper left to the lower right of the selection.
6.	 Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer 
and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name the 
new layer Ring Color.
7.	
Click the foreground color box to change the foreground 
color. In the Change Foreground Color dialog, set the RGB 
values to 0/159/0 for the green shown here, and then click 
OK to close the dialog. The circular selection should still be 
active, so just drag the foreground color into the selection.
8.	 In the Layers dialog, set the Mode to Soft Light and the 
Opacity to 50 percent.
The Crown Molding gradient is applied to the selection in its own layer. 
This provides a layer to which a drop shadow can be added later.
Use the Soft Light layer mode to blend the colored layer with the cir-
cular selection that’s been filled with a gradient. Because you use a 
separate color layer, you can change the color of the image by simply 
changing the color in that layer.

4.5  Shiny Emblem   181
Creating an Emblem
1.	 Add another new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New 
Layer and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name 
this new layer Emblem Color.
2.	 Shrink the selection by 15 pixels (Select4Shrink), and then 
feather the selection by 4 pixels (Select4Feather).
3.	 Open the Change Foreground Color dialog again, set the RGB 
values to 169/7/7 for the red shown here, and then close the 
dialog. Drag the foreground color into the selection.
A red selection covers most of the Crown Molding gradient in the Back-
ground layer. Where the gradient shows through, the red selection appears 
to have a metallic border.
Adding an Inner Border
At this point, you have the basic metallic emblem. The rest of the 
tutorial shows how to get creative with this basic shape. Start by 
adding a slight brushed-metal effect.
1.	 Add a transparent layer and name it Brushed Metal.
2.	 Open the Hurl filter (Filters4Noise4Hurl). Set the Random 
Seed to 10, the Randomization to 35 percent, and the Repeat 
to 3 times. Click OK to apply this to the new layer.
3.	 In the Layers dialog set the Mode to Screen and the Opacity 
to 50 percent.
4.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur). Apply a 2 pixel blur both horizontally and vertically.
5.	 Open the Motion Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Motion Blur). 
Set the Length to 20 pixels and the angle to 45 degrees and 
click OK to apply the blur. 
You will simulate brushed metal in Section 5.1, using the same technique 
as you do here.
6.	 Add a transparent layer and name it Inner Ring.
7.	
Shrink the selection by 25 pixels (Select4Shrink).
8.	 With the toolbox selected, press D to reset the background 
and foreground colors. Fill the selection with black by drag-
ging the foreground color into the selection. 
9.	 Shrink the selection by 4 pixels.

182   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
10.	 Press ctrl-X to cut out the selection from the Inner Ring 
layer and leave behind a thin, black ring.
11.	 Clear the selection.
Unlike the outer ring, the inner ring is created by cutting out a selection 
from a black circle.
12.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur). Set the Blur Radius to 5 pixels, and then apply the 
blur to the Inner Ring layer.
13.	 Create a selection from this layer by choosing Layer4Trans-
parency4Alpha to Selection.
14.	 Add a layer mask to the Emblem Color layer by choosing 
Layer4Mask4Add Layer Mask. In the Add Layer Mask 
dialog, click the Selection radio button and check the Invert 
mask checkbox. This automatically creates a mask in the 
shape of the black ring.
The black ring is used as a layer mask that’s applied to the emblem layer.
Adding Raised Lettering
1.	 Click the Inner Ring layer and invert its colors (Colors4 
Invert).
2.	 Set its layer Mode to Grain Extract. Clear the selection.
3.	 Choose the Text tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog, choose a large, thick font. This example used Utopia 
Bold sized to 310 pixels. 
4.	 Click the canvas and type an uppercase M. Use the Align tool 
to center the text layer in the image window.
5.	 Duplicate the text layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer), and then 
invert its color to white by choosing Colors4Invert. Name 
the duplicate layer White Outline. 
6.	 Choose Layer4Transform4Offset and set the Offset X and 
Offset Y values to −2 pixels.

4.5  Shiny Emblem   183
The raised letter starts out as a solid black M in the center of the emblem.
7.	
Duplicate the original text layer again, naming the duplicate 
layer Black Outline.
8.	 Choose Layer4Transform4Offset once more, but set the 
Offset X and Offset Y values to 2 pixels.
9.	 In the Layers dialog, move the original text layer so that it’s 
between the White Outline and Black Outline layers.
10.	 Click the White Outline layer to make it active.
11.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur) and apply a blur of 5 pixels to the White Outline layer.
12.	 Set the White Outline layer size to match the image size 
(Layer4Layer to Image Size).
13.	 Click the original text layer and create a selection by choosing 
Layer4Transparency4Alpha to Selection.
14.	 Click the White Outline layer to make it active again.
The white letter becomes a highlight for the black letter, making it look as 
though the letter is raised. 
15.	 Press ctrl-X to cut out the selection from the White Outline 
layer.
16.	 Click the Black Outline layer to make it active, and then cut 
out the selection from that layer.
17.	 Set the original text layer’s mode to Overlay and its Opacity 
to 66.7 percent.
18.	 Set the RGB values for the foreground color to 172/172/172 
for the red shown here.
19.	 Click the Emblem Color layer mask to make it active.
20.	 Drag the foreground color from the toolbox into the selection 
and then deselect all (ctrl-shift-A).

184   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
Create a white border by cutting out the original letter from the blurred and 
offset White Outline layer.
The offset black shadow works with the white highlight to complete the 
raised-letter effect.
Further Exploration
A letter with curves that match the curve of the emblem might 
look more impressive than this somewhat ordinary M. You can 
also convert paths to selections to create your own curvy letters. 
If you do so, remember to save the selections so you can recall 
them when it’s time to create the white highlight and black 
shadow layers.

Wine Bottle
By now you’re all familiar 
with how GIMP can be used 
to manipulate stock photos. 
But photo editing is only half a 
story, like a wine glass with no 
wine. To get the whole story, you 
need the wine bottle: ­graphics 
created from scratch using 
GIMP’s vector tools.
This tutorial shows you 
how to draw using nothing 
but guides, a grid, and paths. 
Guides are straight lines that 
allow you to accurately position 
points, bound selections, or 
simply trace with drawing tools. 
Paths are vector components 
of an image that can be edited 
anytime to change their shapes 
using control points and drag 
handles. Path edits don’t imme-
diately affect the image window; 
you have to retrace the paths or 
convert them to selections for 
use in the image.
Paths are to drawing what 
layers are to photo editing. 
You create multiple paths in 
a single path layer and then 
create multiple path layers 
to create a drawing. Since paths 
are editable curves, not just 
straight lines, they’re perfect 
for drawing manga or other types of cartoons. But there’s more 
to paths than cartoons. You’re going to use them as the basis for 
a 3-D shape.
This tutorial is for both new and experienced GIMP users 
who haven’t yet ventured into the world of drawing from scratch. 
You’ll need basic knowledge of GIMP’s windows–the Toolbox, 
image windows, and dialogs–though I’ll provide menu locations 
where needed. You should be familiar with creating new layers 
and naming them.
What you’ll get is a thorough understanding of how guides 
can perfectly align your design elements, how drawings don’t 
have be done in color initially, and how 3-D effects are just a mat-
ter of simulated lighting. 
Drawing the Bottle Shape
The bottle outline is created by outlining the left half using a 
path and then duplicating and flipping this to create the right 
half. Guides are used to precisely align the path control points. 
Four vertical and five horizontal guides are required for this part 
of the drawing.
1.	 Start with a new 800 × 600 image window (File4New). Con-
figure the grid (Image4Configure Grid) with a spacing of 
10 × 10 pixels and a Line style of  Intersections (dots). Then 
enable the Snap to Grid feature (View4Snap to Grid). The 
grid should also be visible (View4Show Grid) when editing 
curves.
2.	 Add a vertical guide (Image4Guides4New Guide...) with 
an offset of 400 pixels, half of the canvas width. Additional 
vertical guides should be positioned at 320, 340, and 370. 
Horizontal guides should be positioned at 40, 200, 280, 520, 
and 560. These positions are all pixel offsets.
We’ve done surface reflections. 
This tutorial uses that technique 
with color to simulate a reflection 
through the bottle.

186   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
Guides will align the outline of the bottle, and the grid gives you the ability to 
exactly position path handles.
3.	 Choose the Paths tool from the Toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog, set the Edit mode to Design. In the image window, 
click on the following guide intersections (the vertical guide 
is listed first) to drop path control points: 400/40, 370/40, 
370/200, 320/280, 320/520, 340/560, 400/560. This gives a 
straight-edged outline, which needs to be rounded. 
4.	 In the Tool Options dialog, set the Edit mode to Edit. Click 
and drag straight up two grid dots on the control point at the 
guides intersecting at 370/200. This is the handle for the incom­
ing curve to this control point, but you don’t need it, so just 
move it out of the way.  Click again on the control point and 
drag the handle for the outgoing curve down 3 grid dots and 
left 1 grid dot. Repeat for the control points at the following 
grid intersections using the specified drag amounts: 
• 
320/280: incoming handle up 4 grid dots
• 
320/520: outgoing handle down 3 grid dots
• 
340/560: incoming handle up 1 and left 2 grid dots
Handles are pulled from control points in order: the first handle is for the line 
coming into the control point from the previous control, the second handle is 
for the line leaving the control point. You may have to drag the first handle 
out of the way before you can edit the handle of interest.
5.	 In the Paths dialog, click the path name to rename this 
path Left Border. In the Tool Options dialog, click Selection 
from Path.
6.	 In the Layers dialog, add a transparent layer (Layer4New 
Layer) and name it Bottle Shape. Type D in the canvas to reset 
the foreground color and then fill the selection with black. 
7.	
Copy the selection (Edit4Copy) and paste it (Edit4Paste) 
as a new layer (Layer4To New Layer). Using the Flip tool 
from the Toolbox, flip this copied layer horizontally. Use 
the Move tool and click and drag in the image window to 
move the layer so the left edge of the bottle in this layer 
aligns with the right edge of the bottle in the Bottle Shape 
layer. Merge the copied layer with the Bottle Shape layer 
(Layer4Merge Down).

4.6  Wine Bottle   187
You can also precisely position the copied, flipped layer using Layer4 
Transform4Offset by specifying an X offset of 80 pixels.
Adding Highlights 
Rendering the bottle into 3-D is done simply by adding some 
lighting effects in the form of colored filled and blurred selections. 
The highlights require six selections: two on the left side of the 
bottle and throat will act as reflected white light, and four on the 
right side will simulate light shining through the bottle and its 
contents.
1.	 Create a transparent layer and name it Highlights-Left Bottle. 
Make it the top of the stack in the Layers dialog. 
2.	 Choose the Rectangular Select tool from the Toolbox. Drag 
a selection in the image window starting at the intersection 
of the guides at 340/280 and dragging to the intersection of 
guides at 400/520. In the Tool Options dialog, change the 
Size to 40 × 240 and the Position to 350 × 280. Choose the 
Rounded Corners option and set the Radius to 70 percent. 
3.	 Fill the rectangle with white. Remove the selection (Select4 
None). Apply a Gaussian Blur (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur) that’s 30 pixels in both the X and Y directions. Reduce 
the Opacity of this layer to 40 percent.
4.	 Create a transparent layer and name it Highlights-Right Bottle. 
Make this the top of the layer stack. 
5.	 Create a selection like the previous one, but set the Position 
to 420 × 280. Click the foreground color box in the Toolbox 
and set the RGB values to 198/31/31, respectively. Fill the 
selection and then remove it, but don’t blur yet. Set the layer 
Transparency to 40 percent.
6.	 Choose the Ellipse Select tool from the Toolbox. Create 
an oval selection starting at the intersection of guides at 
340/200 to 400/280. In the Tool Options dialog, set the Posi-
tion to 400 × 210. 
7.	
Choose the Rotate tool from the Toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog, set the Transform option to Selection. Click in the 
image window and in the Rotate dialog that opens, set the 
Angle to −40 degrees, and then click the Rotate button to 
rotate the selection. 
8.	 Shrink the selection (Select4Shrink) by 10 pixels and 
feather it (Select4Feather) by 5 pixels. Fill the selection 
with the same color as the previous selection, then remove 
the selection. Finally, apply a Gaussian blur to the layer of 
30 pixels. 
9.	 Add a transparent layer named Highlights-Throat. Drag a rect-
angular selection from the intersection of guides at 320/40 
down to 340/200. In the Tool Options dialog, change the Size 
of the selection 20 × 120 and the Position to 380 × 60. Round 
the selection, feather it by 5 pixels, and fill it with white. 
Remove the selection.
10.	 Repeat this selection on the same layer, but set the position 
to 408 × 60 and its size to 15 × 90. Feather again and fill with 
the red color from the right-side selections created previously. 
Remove the selection.
11.	 Finally, blur this entire layer by 20 pixels and set the Opacity 
to 40 percent. 

188   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
The white and red selections are not identical, simulating variations in the 
shape and thickness of the bottle’s glass.
Making a White Label with Gold Trim
What would a wine bottle be without its label? Boring, at least. 
This bottle’s label will once again be outlined with guides, but 
it will be created using some new tools: gradients and the Color-
ize dialog. The label will be edged with multiple pieces of gold 
trim. The trick with these will be to create multiple, disconnected 
selections and apply the trim fill and coloring all at once.
1.	 Create a transparent layer named White Label and put it at the 
top of the layer stack. Add vertical guides positioned at off-
sets of 200, 480, and 600 pixels. Add horizontal guides at 340 
and 410. Choose the Rectangle Select tool from the Toolbox, 
making sure the Rounded Corners option is disabled in the 
Tool Options dialog, and drag a selection from the guide 
intersection of 320/280 to 480/410.
2.	 Reset the foreground and background colors by typing D in 
the canvas. Choose the Gradient tool from the Toolbox. In 
the Tool Options dialog, set the Shape to Bi-linear. Set the 
Gradient to FG to BG (RGB) and click the Reverse button. 
In the image window, drag from the the guide intersection 
of 370/340 left to the intersection at 200/340. Clear the 
selection.
Dragging from an off-center vertical guide moves the lighting on the 
label to match the highlights created earlier.
3.	 Create a transparent layer named Gold Trim at the top of the 
layer stack. Add horizontal guides at 415, 445, 450, and 515. 
Use the Rectangle Select tool to create a selection starting at 
the intersection of 320/410 and dragging to the right at inter-
section 480/415. In the Tool Options dialog, set the Mode 
to Add (second icon from the left). Now create selections 
320/445 to 480/450 and 320/515 to 480/520. This creates 
three separate selections.
4.	 Use the Gradient tool with the same settings as the White 
Label and drag from the horizontal guide at 370 left to the 
guide at 200. Open the Colorize dialog (Colors4Colorize) 
and set the Hue to 50, the Saturation to 86, and the Light-
ness to 0 and apply these settings. Finally, apply a Levels 
adjustment (Colors4Levels) by setting the Input Levels 
midpoint value to 0.25. Clear the selections.

4.6  Wine Bottle   189
Try creating a more complex gradient with multiple levels of gray to give 
the gold trim a more sophisticated appearance.
Making a Blue Stripe and Gold Wrapper
A thick blue stripe on the label will add color, as will a gold wrap-
per around the throat of the bottle. These will be made like the 
white label and gold edges.
1.	 Start with a transparent layer named Blue Stripe at the top of 
the layer stack. Create a rectangular selection (set the Mode 
to Replace in the Tool Options dialog for the Rectangular 
Select tool), starting at the intersection at 320/450 and drag-
ging down and to the right to the intersection at 480/515. 
2.	 Choose the Gradient tool from the Toolbox. Choose the FG 
to BG (RGB) gradient and make sure the Reverse button is 
set. Make sure the Shape is set to Bi-linear. Drag on any hori-
zontal guide starting at the vertical guide at 370 and over to 
the left to the vertical guide at 200.
3.	 Finally, use the Colorize dialog to paint the label dark blue. 
Set the Hue to 200, the Saturation to 77, and the Value to 
−30. Adjust the midpoint slider in the Levels dialog to 0.25. 
Clear the selection.
4.	 Create a transparent layer named Gold Wrapper at the top of 
the layer stack. Add a horizontal guide at 140 and vertical 
guides at 390 and 430. Create a selection, starting with the 
intersection at 370/40 and dragging to 430/140. Create a 
gradient using the same settings as the Blue Stripe but drag 
left to right this time, from the vertical guide at 390 to the 
vertical guide at 480. Use Colorize with the Hue, Saturation, 
and Lightness set to 50, 86, and 0, respectively. Finish this 
part of the tutorial by adjusting the Levels on this selection, 
setting the Black Point to 175 and the Mid Point to 0.15. 
Applying the gradient starting on the guide allows the wrapper reflection to 
align with the one on the neck of the bottle.
Further Exploration
That’s the basic bottle. The splash image for this tutorial takes 
this further by adding a bottle cap, text, and creative graphics 
to the labels. The cap is created using more guides but the same 
selection and gradient process as the labels. The graphics are cut 
from stock icon books and stock photography, desaturated, and 
blended with the bottle and labels. All these processes are exten-
sions of techniques you’ve already learned in previous tutorials. 
Just give them a try!

Gears
Working with GIMP is not unlike working with wood. If you build 
a chair, you certainly don’t build it out of a single piece of wood. 
You cut and shape pieces, then put them together one at a time 
until you have the final product.
Complex GIMP projects are created the same way: by com-
bining component parts into a unified whole. You start by craft-
ing image pieces by hand or from stock photography, which you 
later combine as layers into your final draft. The final draft gets a 
coat of varnish or other “color corrections” before you sit on it or, 
rather, hang it on the wall. Maybe using GIMP isn’t exactly like 
carpentry, but you get the idea.
For example, say you wanted to create a handmade mechani-
cal clock in GIMP. You’d perhaps start with a single gear, just like 
the one you’ll create in this tutorial. This gear can be duplicated 
and rearranged, as well as reused in entirely new projects.
This project won’t require any outside stock photography 
or specialized graphics knowledge. You should be able to follow 
along whether you’re a GIMP guru or just hammering out your 
first GIMP gear. 
Original graphics like this are the result of simple rota-
tions and precisely sized and positioned selections. 
Making the Gear Cogs
The small teeth around the edge of a gear are called cogs. You’ll 
start this project by creating 32 uniformly spaced cogs around 
a circle. Later you’ll connect the cogs with metallic rings, and 
then you’ll finish off the project by adding depth to give the 
whole gear a 3-D appearance.
The process for the cogs is so simple, I’ll explain it before you 
even start. You create a single cog at the top of a square canvas 
window in a layer by itself. You duplicate the layer and rotate it 90 
degrees. Then you merge the duplicate with the original. Repeat 
this once to end up with cogs positioned at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o’clock. 
Then repeat the process but halve the rotation amount. Each suc-
cessive repetition halves the rotation again. Now you can see this 
process in action.

(by Percent). Add a horizontal guide at 50 percent and a ver-
tical guide at 50 percent. Then use Image4Guides4New 
Guide to add horizontal guides at 10 pixels and 470 pixels. 
Then add vertical guides at the same offsets.
2.	 Create a transparent layer. Name this layer Cogs. Choose the 
Rectangle Select tool from the toolbox. Drag a rectangular 
selection anywhere in the image window. The size and loca-
tion of the selection don’t matter at this point; you’re about 
to change these manually.
3.	 In the Tool Options dialog, set the selection Size to 20 pixels 
wide by 40 pixels tall and the Position to 230 pixels and 
10 pixels. This will place the 20 × 40 pixel selection at the 
top center of the image window. Round the corners of the 
cog by clicking the Rounded Corners option in the Tool 
Options dialog. This will display a slider to set the radius of 
the rounded corners. Move the slider all the way to the right, 
setting the Radius to 100.0.

4.7  Gears   191
A square image window will make rotating the cog layers easier. 
4.	 Click the foreground color box in the toolbox and change 
the foreground color to gray by typing 808080 in the HTML 
notation box. Click OK, close the dialog, and then drag the 
foreground color box from the toolbox into the selection. 
5.	 Copy the selection and paste it into the image window. Con-
vert the floating selection to a new layer (Layer4To New 
Layer). Change the layer to match the image size (Layer4 
Layer to Image Size). 
6.	 Rotate the layer by 180 degrees (Layer4Transform4Rotate 
180). Note here that if you hadn’t expanded the layer to match 
the image size, the rotation would have been around the cen-
ter of the cog. Instead, with the layer boundaries expanded 
to match the square image window, you’ve rotated the layer 
around the center of the image window. The result is that the 
duplicate cog is now at the 6 o’clock position.
7.	
Merge the new layer with the layer below it (Layer4Merge 
Down). The new layer will inherit the original cog layer name 
of Cogs.
The first cog is positioned at the 12 o’clock setting and aligned horizon-
tally in the center of the image window. This alignment will allow for 
exact positioning of the rest of the cogs as you build your gear.
When merging two layers, the new merged layer will always inherit the 
lower-level (as shown in the Layers dialog) layer name. 

192   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
Having created two cogs, you make the rest simply by 
duplicating the existing cog layer, rotating the duplicate an 
appropriate amount, and merging the two cog layers again.
8.	 Duplicate the Cogs layer. Rotate this layer by 90 degrees 
(Layer4Transform4Rotate 90 degrees clockwise) to add 
the cogs at the 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock positions. (For this step 
it doesn’t matter if you rotate clockwise or counterclockwise.) 
Merge this layer with the previous one.
Each time you rotate a layer, the rotation amount is half of the previous 
rotation. 
If you didn’t catch it, the last rotation of 90 degrees 
was half of the first rotation. That pattern of reducing the 
rotation by half each iteration will continue from now until 
you have all the cogs you want. 
9.	 With 4 cogs in place, you move to 8 cogs by duplicating the 
layer, rotating by 90/2 = 45 degrees, and merging the layer. 
The trick here is that you no longer have a simple menu 
option to select “rotate by 45 degrees.” Instead, you choose 
Layer4Transform4Arbitrary Rotation. The dialog that 
opens has an input field labeled Angle. Instead of using the 
slider, it’s easier to just type in the amount (45) and click 
the Rotate button. Don’t forget to merge the layers.
10.	 There are two rotations left, and they follow the same process 
as the last step. For 16 cogs: duplicate the layer, rotate by 
45/2 = 22.5 degrees, and merge the layers. For 32 cogs: dupli-
cate the layer, rotate by 22.5/2 = 11.25 degrees, and merge 
the layers. That’s enough cogs for this gear.
11.	 The rotations have a side effect on the final layer: its layer 
boundaries are larger than the image window. To fix this, 
choose Layer4Layer to Image Size once again.
After the 90-degree rotation, you need to use the Arbitrary Rotation dialog 
to set the angle of rotation. The final 32 cogs (lower left) should be equally 
spaced around the image.

4.7  Gears   193
Creating the Outer Ring
The next step in your gear design is to connect all those cogs. 
Do this by creating a solid disk and then cutting out an inner disk 
to create a ring in its own layer. You can then merge the ring and 
Cogs layers. Start by adding a transparent layer. Name this layer 
Outer Ring.
1.	 Choose the Ellipse Select tool from the toolbox. Use the 
guides to create a perfect oval that aligns properly with the 
outside edges of the cogs. In the image window, click the 
upper left intersection of the top and left guides, then drag 
to the lower right intersection of the bottom and right 
guides. The circular selection this creates overlaps the cogs 
completely, so reduce the size of the selection. The cogs are 
40 pixels high, so reducing the selection by half that amount 
should do nicely. Choose Select4Shrink and set the size to 
20. Then click OK to shrink the selection.
The outer ring is the piece of metal that connects the cogs. The gear doesn’t 
have to have an outer ring and inner disk, of course. The gear could just as 
easily be one solid piece of metal.
2.	 The foreground color should still be the same color you used 
for the cogs, so go ahead and drag it into the selection. Now 
you want to cut a disk out of this selection. Remember that the 
height of the cogs is 40 pixels, so you need the outer ring to 
be at least 20 pixels (20 + the 20 pixels we shrunk in the selec-
tion the first time = the inside edge of the cogs). Give your-
self a little extra room and shrink the selection by 25 pixels. 
All that’s left to finish the outer ring is to cut the selection 
from the existing gray disk. At this point you can merge the 
Cogs layer with the Outer Ring layer.
The cogs and outer ring are complete, but a gear like this needs to spin 
on something, so you’ll add an inner disk to the design. 
Next you’ll add an inner disk to the gear. Keep in mind 
that other than the cogs, the shape of the gear (inner rings 
and decorations) is completely an artistic choice. To hone 
your skills, you could attempt to duplicate a real gear down 
to the smallest detail. Or you could create shapes inside the 
outer ring that aren’t uniform disks and rods. For your first 
gear, however, keep it simple and use shapes that are easily 
created and duplicated.

194   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
3.	 The inner disk of your gear starts with another oval selec-
tion. The easiest way to create this is to select the transparent 
area inside the outer ring of the Cogs layer. The Cogs layer 
is active, so start by choosing the Fuzzy Select tool from the 
toolbox. Click inside the image window in the area inside 
the outer ring. This creates a selection that follows the inside 
edge of that ring. Add a transparent layer in which you’ll cre-
ate the inner disk and name the layer Inner Disk. You want 
a disk significantly smaller than this selection, however. It’s 
time for a little math.
4.	 Remember that the image window is a square 480 pixels on 
each side. Also, you created a 40-pixel-tall cog placed 10 pixels 
down (vertically) in the image window. That means the bot-
tom edge of the cog is 50 pixels down from the top of the 
image window. The vertical center of the image window is 
at 480/2 = 240 pixels. That means the current selection has 
a radius of 240 − 50 = 190 pixels (not including the 5-pixel 
extra space you added when creating the outer ring). Let’s 
halve that to 95 pixels, shrinking the selection by 95 pixels, 
and fill it with gray. Clear the selection.
Projects like this, using square image windows and rotation to position 
graphic elements, often require a little math.
Connecting the Disk and Ring
1.	 Before merging the inner disk, you’ll add some connecting 
rods between the inner disk and the outer ring. You can use 
similar techniques to the ones used to create the original 
cog, manually sizing and positioning a selection to create the 
first rod, then duplicating the layer and rotating each dupli-
cate layer.
2.	 Choose the Rectangle Select tool from the toolbox and draw 
an initial selection in the canvas. In the Tool Options dialog, 
set the Size to 20 pixels wide by 115 pixels tall and set the 
Position to 230 pixels and 45 pixels. This centers the selec-
tion on the central vertical guide between the outer ring and 
inner disk. This time you can disable the Rounded Corners 
option (click it so the check mark is removed). Add a trans-
parent layer named Rods, and then fill the selection from the 
foreground color.
The connecting rods are created with the same process used to create 
the cogs, though you’ll only need four connecting rods. 
3.	 The selection is still active, so copy and paste it as you did 
with the original cog. Convert the floating selection (created 

4.7  Gears   195
when you pasted) into a new layer. Set the layer boundaries to 
the image size. Now flip the pasted layer vertically (Layer4 
Transform4Flip Vertically). Merge the two rod layers. Dupli-
cate the merged layer again. Rotate the layer by 90 degrees. 
Merge the two rod layers again. Finally, merge the rod layers 
with the Inner Disk layer, and then merge the Inner Disk 
layer with the Cogs layer. 
That’s the template for your gear. Now you can add depth 
and texture to it.
The basic gear shape is easy enough. The fun starts when you add texture 
and depth. 
Adding Depth and Texture 
1.	 Duplicate the Cogs layer and name it Cogs Blur. 
2.	 Apply an RLE Gaussian Blur of 5 pixels horizontally and ver-
tically. Turn off the visibility of the blurred layer in the Layers 
dialog. 
3.	 Select the Cogs layer. Open the Bump Map filter (Filters4 
Map4Bump Map). Set the Bump Map option to the Cogs 
Blur layer. Set the Azimuth to 135, the Elevation to 45, and 
the Depth to 30. Click OK to apply these settings. This will 
give the Cogs layer some depth. 
The 3-D effect is easy. Just blur a copy of the item, and then use the 
blurred version as a bump map. 
4.	 With the Cogs layer active, select the entire gear (Layer4 
Transparency4Alpha to Selection). Create a transparent 
layer and name it Noise. Use the RGB Noise filter (Filters4 
Noise4RGB Noise) to fill the selection with noise. Disable 
the Independent Noise button and move all the sliders to the 
far left (setting their values to 0) except the Alpha slider, 
which should be moved all the way to the right.
5.	 Add a motion blur (Filters4Blur4Motion Blur) to the 
Noise layer. Set the length to 10 and the angle to 45. Apply 
this to the Noise layer. Merge the Noise layer with the Cogs 
layer. Open the Colorize dialog and choose an appropriate 
color for the gear. Clear the selection (Select4None).

196   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
You can try other types of textures, like rust or shiny metal. These are just 
variations on the brushed metal effect shown here. 
Further Exploration
There are lots of variations you can try with this tutorial. Try 
creating square cogs and placing them closer together (hint: you 
need to create more cogs). Other shapes you can try are sawtooth, 
or, if you’re really adventurous, you can try curved cogs. You can 
also be creative in how you connect the cogs. Instead of a ring 
and disk, you might try connecting the cogs to a ring that uses 
swirled shapes where the disk and rods are used in this tutorial.
For ideas on gear designs, try doing an Internet search for 
gears, clocks, and watches. Also, clipart books have lots of unusual 
shapes you can use to replace the connecting rods and inner disks.

Cube City
What if the last tutorial was a bit too artistic for your project’s 
needs? You could turn to stock imagery for a much more recog-
nizable, if two-dimensional, cityscape. Or you could ditch high 
art and have a little more fun. Maybe you need something with 
a little toon style to it. Maybe what you need is Cube City.
Cartoon buildings are an easy effect to achieve with GIMP.
In this tutorial you’ll create three buildings from simple 3-D 
cubes, and then bend the buildings a bit to give the design a car-
toonish look. The entire image takes only a few minutes to put 
together—once you’re familiar with the tricks of the trade.
The process starts by generating a single 3-D cube that’s 
duplicated and stretched to create each of the three buildings. 
Despite GIMP’s obvious bias toward 2-D artwork, creating the 
cube is far easier than it might seem. This design is created at 
250 ppi to produce a print that’s 4 × 6 inches. If you’re after a 
larger print, you’ll need to create a larger cube. You can scale 
down the original cube for smaller prints, but the windows in the 
buildings will become difficult to see if you do, so it’s best start 
with a smaller version of the cube for smaller prints.
Getting Started
Open a new transparent canvas (File4New) 2 × 2 inches at 
250 ppi. This image will be used to create the 3-D cube for the 
main project. For comparison’s sake, note that if you were plan-
ning to create a cube city 420 × 300 pixels at 72 ppi, you’d start 
with a layer that was 60 × 60 pixels.
Creating the Building’s Face
1.	 Choose the Blend tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog, set the Gradient to FG to BG (RGB) and the Shape to 
Linear. The rest of the options should be set to their default 
values.
2.	 With the canvas selected, press D to reset the default fore-
ground and background colors, and then drag horizontally 
on the canvas from left to right.
3.	 Create a 6 × 5 grid (Image4Configure Grid) by setting the 
width to 0.4 inches and the height to 0.33 inches. Be sure 
to turn on the visibility of the grid (View4Show Grid) and 

198   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
enable snapping to the grid (View4Snap to Grid). If neces-
sary, press shift-+ to zoom in and get a better look at the gra-
dient layer. Click OK.
The building starts with a gradient and grid that help outline the 
windows.
4.	 Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer 
and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. You’ll merge 
this layer with the background as soon as you’re done with it, 
so don’t name it. 
5.	 Choose the Rectangle Select tool from the toolbox. Using 
a grid intersection point as the corner of a selection, drag 
to create a square selection that’s inside a rectangle created 
by the grid but doesn’t cover that entire grid rectangle. The 
extra space between the selections is the wall between adja-
cent windows.
6.	 Repeat this process for most of the grid boxes within this 
cube layer, leaving a few blank. Selections on the right side 
of the gradient will be more apparent in the final image, so 
don’t leave those blank. Hold down the shift key as you drag 
or set the Mode to Add in the Tool Options dialog. This will 
add new selections to the existing selections. The selections 
needn’t all be the same size. This is, after all, a cartoonish 
design.
7.	
After all the selections have been created, click the Blend 
tool again to make it active. Drag from right to left across 
the width of the layer to fill the selections. Deselect all 
(ctrl-shift-A).
8.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur), set the Blur Radius to 3 pixels, and click OK to apply 
the blur to the windows.
9.	 In the Layers dialog, set the layer mode to Hard Light and 
merge this layer with the Background layer (Layer4Merge 
Down).
10.	 Hide the grid (View4Show Grid) and disable snapping to it 
(View4Snap to Grid).
Leaving a few spots blank (without windows) adds some variation to the tex-
ture of the cartoonish building. 

4.8  Cube City   199
Making the Face a Cube
1.	 Open the Map Object filter (Filters4Map4Map Object). 
Choose Box from the Map to drop-down menu and check 
the Transparent background checkbox. Make sure the 
Enable antialiasing checkbox is also checked.
2.	 On the Orientation tab, set the Y Rotation to 45 degrees. If 
the preview doesn’t show your rectangle converted into a nice 
cube as shown here, check the Box tab and make sure the 
correct layer (cube) is selected for each of the sides’ drop-
down menus.
3.	 On the Box tab, set the Y slider to 0.75, and then click OK to 
apply the Map Object filter.
4.	 Select the whole canvas (Select4All) and press ctrl-C to 
copy the cube. If you want, you can then close this image to 
save memory.
N o t e 	
Before continuing, you should save this image (File4Save As) 
as an XCF file so you’ll always have a copy of the source cube 
for future Cube City projects. Saving subcomponents of a project 
like this is common practice and will, over time, help you build a 
library of small components suitable for multiple projects.
The Map Object filter simplifies this project because it converts the single 
building face into a cube, giving you a building almost instantly.
Multiplying the Buildings
1.	 Open a new canvas that’s 4 × 6 inches at 250 ppi.
2.	 With the toolbox selected, press D to reset the foreground 
and background colors, and then drag the foreground color 
onto the canvas to fill the canvas with black. 
3.	 Paste the cube you copied onto the black canvas as a new 
layer by pressing ctrl-V and then choosing Layer4To New 
Layer.
4.	 Choose the Scale tool from the toolbox. Click the cube layer 
and drag up a bit to make the building taller. Click the Scale 
button in the Scaling Information dialog to apply the change. 
5.	 Duplicate this layer twice by choosing Layer4Duplicate twice. 
Name the three layers Left, Middle, and Right.
6.	 Click the Left layer to make it active, and then use the Move 
tool to drag it left of center on the canvas (hold down the 
shift key if necessary). Then click the Right layer and move it 
right of center. Adjust the layers so the Left layer overlaps the 
Middle layer, which overlaps the Right layer.
The gradient, which is black on the left and white on the right, works well to 
simulate shadowed areas on the sides of each building.

200   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
7.	
Choose the Perspective tool from the toolbox. In the Layers 
dialog, click the Left layer to make it active. Then click the 
canvas to display the drag points around the layer. Drag the 
top-left and top-right points outward from the center of the 
layer. In the Perspective Transform Information dialog, click 
the Transform button to apply the change.
8.	 Repeat this process for the Right and Middle layers.
9.	 When all three buildings have been completed, use the Move 
tool to adjust the layers so the bottom edges of the buildings 
line up.
Changing the perspective of the buildings lends the cityscape a cartoonish 
effect. Because each building’s perspective is changed by a different amount, 
the buildings aren’t identical.
Adding Color
The buildings should be different colors, but you don’t want the 
colors to clash.
1.	 For each layer, open the Colorize dialog (Colors4Colorize).
2.	 For the Left layer, set the Hue to 33, the Saturation to 66, 
and the Lightness to −15. For the Middle layer, set the Hue to 
180, the Saturation to 60, and the Lightness to −15. For the 
Right layer, set the Hue to 100, the Saturation to 50, and the 
Lightness to −15.
3.	 At this point, you can use the Sharpen filter or the Unsharp 
Mask filter (Filters4Enhance) to reduce any fuzziness that 
was introduced when you modified the perspective.
Using the Colorize tool is the easiest way to add color to the buildings, 
although you could also use the Bucket Fill tool with its mode set to Color 
or Grain Merge.
Adding Highlights
1.	 Add a drop shadow to the Left and Middle layers by choosing 
Filters4Light and Shadow4Drop Shadow. Set the Offset X 
value to 15 pixels, the Offset Y value to 3 pixels, and the Blur 
Radius to 15 pixels. Click OK to apply the drop shadow.
2.	 Click the foreground color box to open the Change Fore-
ground Color dialog. Set the RGB values to 252/255/0 for 
the yellow shown here and click OK.

4.8  Cube City   201
3.	 Click the Left layer to make it active, duplicate the layer 
(Layer4Duplicate Layer), and name the new layer Left 
Yellow Oval. Press ctrl-A and then ctrl-X to clear the layer 
contents.
4.	 In the Layers dialog, uncheck the Lock Alpha Channel box 
as shown.
A drop shadow adds even more depth to the image.
5.	 Choose the Ellipse Select tool from the toolbox and use it to 
create an oval selection on the left side of the building.
6.	 Feather the selection by 30 pixels (Select4Feather), and 
then drag the foreground color box into the selection to fill 
it with yellow.
7.	
Use the Move tool to drag the selection to the right side of 
the building. Drag the foreground color box into the new 
selection. Deselect all (ctrl-shift-A).
8.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur) and apply a blur of 60 pixels.
9.	 Set the layer mode to Grain Merge and reduce the Opacity to 
35 percent. 
10.	 Duplicate the Left Yellow Oval layer (Layer4Duplicate 
Layer). Name the duplicate layer Middle Yellow Oval.
11.	 Use the Move tool to move the Middle Yellow Oval layer 
over the middle building, and then in the Layers dialog move 
the Middle Yellow Oval layer to just above the Middle layer. 
Repeat this process for the Right layer, naming the last dupli-
cate layer Right Yellow Oval.
12.	 Adjust the Yellow Oval layers’ Opacity and Layer Mode and, 
if necessary, scale them to fit the buildings.
Yellow highlights add a sense of lighting, even though there are no streetlamps 
in the image. This is, after all, a cartoon.
Further Exploration
It’s incredibly easy to create 3-D objects in GIMP. As you’ve seen, 
it’s simply a matter of using gradients and shadows mixed with 
colored highlights.
And it’s easy to take this project to the next level. The first 
image in this section shows that a sidewalk and some street light-
ing have been added to the cityscape. Additional elements can 
be added from icon collections, pasted into the image, and 
colorized.

Underwater
We’ve already discussed how setting the mood in an advertisement 
is crucial to getting your message across. In Section 4.6 you saw 
how light can reflect both from inside and outside of a bottle. 
This ad’s ominous message is enhanced by a murky, watery effect.
One place we can go to set an eerie mood is underwater. 
Undersea atmosphere is a complex mixture of diminishing light, 
distorted visuals, and inverted surfaces. In the land of GIMP, 
however, the underwater realm is easy to create.
In this section you’ll create an underwater image for use in 
a print ad. The effect isn’t particularly difficult to produce, but 
it does take some patience and experimentation to get a realistic 
result. If you don’t succeed on the first try, make subtle changes 
to the Solid Noise filter’s settings and try again.
Getting Started
1.	 Open a new canvas sized to 1024 × 768 pixels.
2.	 Press D and then X to reset and then swap the default fore-
ground and background colors. In the toolbox, click the 
foreground color box to open the Change Foreground Color 
dialog. Set the RGB values to 23/137/125 for the aqua green 
shown here, and then click OK.
3.	 Choose the Blend tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog, set the Gradient to FG to BG (RGB), set the Shape to 
Linear, and choose None from the Repeat drop-down menu. 
Drag vertically from the top of the canvas window to the 
bottom.
4.	 In the Layers dialog, temporarily turn off the visibility of the 
Background layer. You’ll turn it back on when you’re done 
creating the desaturated waves.
The lightest color is at the top of the canvas so that the waves you add over-
head will be visible.

4.9  Underwater   203
Creating Waves
You’ll start by using the Solid Noise filter to generate the waves. 
Increasing the detail setting in this filter will increase the con-
trast in parts of the image, and stretching the effect horizontally 
will help simulate water instead of clouds.
1.	 Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer 
and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name the 
new layer Surface.
2.	 Open the Solid Noise filter (Filters4Render4Clouds4Solid 
Noise). Check the Randomize checkbox, set the Detail to 5, 
set the X Size to 5, and set the Y Size to 10. Click OK to apply 
the filter. 
3.	 Repeat this process four more times, creating four new layers 
and making sure to uncheck and check the Randomize box 
on each layer so that a new random value changes the shape 
of each rendering. Set the Mode to Difference for every layer 
except the original Surface layer.
Because the Randomize box is checked in the Solid Noise filter’s dialog, your 
waves won’t look exactly like this. You may find that only 1 noise layer is suf-
ficient, or you may need 10 noise layers. If you aren’t achieving the look you 
want, try selecting a different Random Seed.
4.	 Merge the visible layers into a single layer (Image4Merge 
Visible Layers). Set the merged layer’s mode to Grain Merge.
5.	 Turn back on the visibility of the Background layer.
6.	 If necessary, adjust the Brightness and Contrast of the ­Surface 
layer to sharpen or soften the edges between the crests and 
troughs of the waves (Colors4Brightness-Contrast). While 
the mouse is in the canvas window, press the minus (–) key to 
zoom out.
7.	
Choose the Perspective tool from the toolbox. Click the 
canvas to display the drag points at the four corners of the 
Surface layer. Pull up the lower-left and lower-right points to 
approximately one-third to one-half the height of the canvas. 
8.	 Drag the upper-left point to the left and drag the upper-right 
point to the right, as shown here. In the Perspective Trans-
form Information dialog, click the Transform button to 
apply these changes to the layer.
9.	 If the waves appear too small or crowded, use the Scale tool 
to stretch the layer. When this is completed, zoom back in by 
pressing shift-+.
10.	 At this point you can use the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4 
Blur4Gaussian Blur) to apply a blur of 2 to 5 pixels. You 
can also use the Ripple filter (Filters4Distort4Ripple) to 
add distortion. Neither of these steps is required—use your 
own judgment to get the most out of this effect.
11.	 Add a white layer mask (Layer4Mask4Add Layer Mask).
12.	 Reset and swap the default foreground and background colors 
by pressing D and then X while the canvas is selected.
13.	 Choose the Blend tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog, use the same settings you used earlier. Drag vertically, 
starting between the top and middle of the layer, to near the 
bottom of the layer. This will fade the Surface layer into the 
background, making it look as though the surface is disap-
pearing into the distance.
14.	 Turn off the Layer Boundary (View4Layer Boundary) so 
you can see the underwater effect more clearly. This is also a 
good time to save a copy of the project for future use (File4 
Save As).

204   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
Dragging beyond the edges of the canvas with the Perspective tool doesn’t 
cost you anything unless you save to the XCF format. When you export the 
file as a TIFF, JPEG, or other image file format, the excess isn’t saved. 
The Perspective change altered the size of the Surface layer. But without the 
mask, the distance has a distinct edge. 
Adding Diffused Light
Now it’s time to add a light source that appears above the water.
1.	 Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer 
and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name the 
layer Light Source.
2.	 Choose the Blend tool from the toolbox again. Set the Gradi-
ent to FG to BG (RGB), set the Shape to Radial, and choose 
None from the Repeat drop-down menu. Click the top of the 
canvas near its middle and drag down through the canvas 
about halfway.
Choosing the Radial shape for the white-to-black gradient is an easy 
way to create a sphere. In this case, you’re creating a radiating light 
source.
3.	 Add a white layer mask to this layer (Layer4Mask4Add 
Layer Mask).
4.	 With the Blend tool still active, set the Shape to Linear in the 
Tool Options dialog. Then drag vertically from the top of the 
canvas to the middle.

4.9  Underwater   205
5.	 Set the Mode for this layer to Grain Merge. The black in 
the layer will darken the waves a bit, but the white will also 
lighten some of them—giving the overall appearance of a 
nighttime underwater scene.
A layer mask prevents the light from shining beyond a certain depth.
Adding Rays of Light
Now you can really make this scene shine.
1.	 Click the Background layer to make it active.
2.	 Choose the Rectangle Select tool from the toolbox. Drag 
through the top half of the canvas to create a square selec-
tion. The selection should cover the entire light source.
3.	 Copy and paste the selection, and then choose Layer4To 
New Layer to make the pasted selection a new layer. Name 
it Light Rays. You won’t use the content of the copied layer, 
but this is a simple way to create an appropriately sized 
layer. Make sure the layer boundary is visible (View4Layer 
Boundary).
4.	 Choose the Blend tool again. This time set the Gradient to 
Flare Rays Size 1, set the Shape to Bi-linear, and choose 
Sawtooth wave from the Repeat drop-down menu. Drag hori-
zontally from left to right through the middle third of the 
new layer.
The Flare Rays gradients are similar to the Crown Molding gradient, 
although the vertical shades of light and dark are closer together in 
the Flare Rays gradients.
5.	 Open the Polar Coordinates filter (Filters4Distorts4Polar 
Coordinates). Set the Circle depth in percent to 0 and adjust 
the Offset angle so the most visible lines from the edges of the 
original layer (if any) are at the bottom of the preview. The 
To polar checkbox and the Map from top checkbox should 
be checked, but the Map backwards checkbox should be left 
unchecked. Click OK to apply the filter.
6.	 Choose the Scale tool from the toolbox. Click the canvas 
to display the drag points on the layer corners. Click near 
the bottom of the layer and drag down until the center drag 
point meets the original layer’s bottom, as shown here. Drag 
to extend the sides out toward the edges of the canvas as well. 

206   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
The scaling doesn’t have to be exact at this point. Click the 
center drag point and move it up near the top center of the 
canvas. Click Scale in the dialog to apply the scaling changes. 
The center point of these radial lines should be moved to the top center 
of the canvas. This ensures that the lines seem to radiate from the light 
source you created earlier.
7.	
Add a white layer mask (Layer4Mask4Add Layer Mask). 
Then press D and then X to reset and swap the default fore-
ground and background colors. 
8.	 Choose the Blend tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog, set the Gradient to FG to BG (RGB), set the Shape to 
Radial, and choose None from the Repeat drop-down menu. 
Drag from the top of the canvas to the middle to blend the 
rays of light into the background.
9.	 Blend this layer with the Background layer by setting the 
Light Rays layer’s mode to Grain Merge.
Setting the Light Rays layer’s mode to Grain Merge blends the light areas with 
the Background layer. The layer mask causes the rays to fade as they get far-
ther from the light source.
Intensifying the Light
1.	 Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer 
and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name this 
new layer Sunlight.
2.	 The Blend tool should still be active. In the Tool Options dia-
log, change the Gradient to FG to Transparent but leave the 
other settings unchanged. Click the top center of the canvas 
and drag down through one-fourth to one-third of the can-
vas. Set the layer mode to Grain Merge. 

4.9  Underwater   207
3.	 If the light source is still too dark, then duplicate this layer 
(Layer4Duplicate). If using the Grain Merge setting for 
these two layers doesn’t produce the effect you seek, try 
changing the layer mode to Soft Light or Overlay.
Because the layer mode is set to Grain Merge, the extra light sources merge 
with both the rays of light and the Background layer. Don’t be afraid to 
experiment with different layer modes to find the one that produces the most 
compelling effect for your project.
Further Exploration
Some variations on this effect can be achieved by changing the 
color of the water or the location of the light source above it, but 
it’s what you add below the surface that’ll really make your ocean 
come alive. If you like, experiment on the final image by apply-
ing both the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian Blur) 
and the Ripple filter (Filters4Distorts4Ripple) to the Light Rays 
layer. Both filters will help soften the light rays. You can even add 
a text layer, as shown in the first image in this section, or cut and 
paste some ocean life into the scene to complete the project. For 
something special, look for stock brushes or images or fonts that 
include bubbles!

Colored Lighting
Whether in a portrait studio or while working in GIMP, colored 
lighting effects can set the mood. Different colors can evoke dif-
ferent feelings—blues are cool, reds are warm, yellow sets the 
stage for a sunny day, and green makes you think of spring.
Colored lighting can be applied so the light is directed at 
the subject and not the background. But for the most dramatic 
effect, colored lighting should be ambient lighting. It should be 
applied to the room, the background, even the open air around 
the subject.
Digital colored lighting effects are created using radial gradi-
ents and a variety of layer modes. The most suitable stock images 
have distinct left and right sides to the subject. This allows you to 
simulate light sources on either side without risk of overlapping.
In this tutorial you’ll add colored lighting to a studio portrait 
without desaturating the original image. The colored lighting 
you add will blend with the model’s original skin tone.
Yellow and blue tones enhance the model’s skin, hair, and eye color.
Getting Started
1.	 Open the original image file in GIMP. The image in this 
example is very bright, and adding colored lighting will only 
make it brighter.
2.	 First, use the Levels dialog to reduce the brightness (Colors4 
Levels). Move the black point about one-third of the way 
to the right, move the gray point even farther to the right, 
and click OK to apply the levels changes. Not all images will 
require this kind of adjustment, and with some images you’ll 
get better results using the Curves or Brightness-Contrast 
tools instead.
Lowering the midpoint of the Levels histogram will darken the image while 
keeping the contrast high.

4.10  Colored Lighting   209
Adding Cool Lighting
You’ll want to enhance this image by adding both cool and warm 
lighting, starting with the cool lighting.
1.	 Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer 
and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name the 
new layer Left Side - Cool.
2.	 Click the foreground color in the toolbox to open the Change 
Foreground Color dialog. Set the RGB values to 25/59/225 
for the blue used in this example, and then click OK.
3.	 Choose the Blend tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog, set the Gradient to FG to Transparent and the Shape 
to Linear.
4.	 We want to add a blue-to-transparent gradient in the new 
layer, but in which direction should the gradient flow? Imag-
ine a straight line starting at the model’s right ear (left side 
of the image) and running along the edge of the model’s jaw. 
Starting in the lower-left corner of the canvas, drag a line 
passing through and perpendicular to the imaginary line. 
This will apply the gradient to the Left Side - Cool layer.
5.	 Set the layer mode to Color to blend the color in the gradient 
layer with the colors in the original layer.
6.	 This lighting only lights the left side of the image. You’ll need 
to add a similar lighting effect on the right side. Add another 
new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer and 
setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name the new 
layer Right Side - Cool.
7.	
This time, imagine a line that goes along the model’s left 
cheek (on the right side of the image). Starting in the lower-
right corner of the canvas, drag a line passing through and 
perpendicular to the imaginary line. Set this layer’s mode to 
Color.
8.	 The coloring on this side should be a bit darker than on the 
other side, so duplicate this layer once (Layer4Duplicate 
Layer).
The gradient, shown here before changing the layer mode to Color, runs 
from the lower-left corner of the canvas to the upper-right corner and is 
perpendicular to the model’s jawline.
Another gradient runs from the lower-right corner of the canvas up toward  
the model’s left eye.

210   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
Adding Warm Lighting
Now add the warm lighting.
1.	 Add another new transparent layer and name it Warm Lighting. 
Open the Change Foreground Color dialog again and set the 
RGB values to 255/222/3 for the warm yellow shown here.
2.	 The Blend tool should already be active, but you should 
change the Shape to Radial in the Tool Options dialog 
before proceeding. 
3.	 To apply the warm lighting, click the model’s right temple 
and drag down to the middle of her neck. The result of 
applying the Radial gradient is shown here in the smaller 
window before changing the layer mode. Change this layer’s 
mode to Soft Light.
4.	 To enhance this light further, duplicate the layer once 
(Layer4Duplicate Layer).
Warm lighting is applied just above the model’s right temple so that the 
brightest points don’t overwhelm the color of her eyes.
Adding a Highlight
One more highlight is needed. Use the Blend tool to add it.
1.	
Add another new transparent layer and name it Warm Highlight.
2.	 Reset the foreground color to white by pressing D and then X 
in the canvas.
3.	 The Blend tool should still be active, but if it isn’t, choose it 
from the toolbox. Make sure that in the Tool Options dialog, 
the Gradient is set to FG to Transparent and the Shape is set 
to Radial. Click the outside tip of the model’s right eyebrow 
and drag toward the inside corner of that eye. 
4.	 Set this layer’s mode to Soft Light to produce a brighter yellow 
over the temple and eyebrow area, as if this is where the light 
is directed and most intense.
Add intensity to the warm lighting by using the Blend tool to apply a white 
Radial gradient.

4.10  Colored Lighting   211
Softening the Image
To add the finishing touch, soften the model’s face.
1.	 Duplicate the original layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer).
2.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur). Apply a blur of about 8 pixels. If you aren’t satisfied 
with the result, press ctrl-Z to undo it, and then try again 
using a different value for the Blur Radius. The blur softens 
the model’s face, but her eyes, mouth, and some of her hair 
should be in focus.
3.	 Add a white layer mask (Layer4Mask4Add Layer Mask).
4.	 Reset the foreground color to black by pressing D in the canvas.
5.	 Choose the Airbrush tool from the toolbox. Select a soft-
edged brush and use it to paint in the mask with black. Paint 
over the eyes, mouth, and hair until all three are more in 
focus, but leave the surrounding facial features blurred.
The Gaussian Blur filter is used on a duplicate layer to soften the model’s 
face. A layer mask is also used so that details from the original layer show 
through the blurred layer.
Further Exploration
Lighting sets the mood in images like this. Experiment with dif-
ferent colored lighting layers to see if you can create images that 
convey moods of confusion or anger, despite the model’s facial 
expression.

iPod
Because of my cheap nature, I rarely give myself a fancy gadget. 
Fortunately for me, I have a wonderful daughter who decided I 
needed a really nice holiday present: an iPod Nano. 
The iPod is the pop-culture king these days. That title is due 
in no small part to the simple yet effective advertising campaign 
of silhouetted dancing hipsters with their high-contrast iPods 
and bouncing earphone wires. What’s fun about all this for GIMP 
users is the sheer simplicity of the design. The iPod advertising 
artwork takes only modest GIMP expertise, as long as you (and 
you knew this was coming) start with good stock imagery. 
In this tutorial I’m going to show how to take your own danc-
ing fool and iPodicize him (or her) into advertising “nerdvana.” 
All you need for this tutorial is a little straightforward selection 
and layer experience. 
In this project, a stock image whose detail is  
not lost in silhouette is an important starting  
point.
Getting Started
Finding photos of energetic music lovers on websites like BigStock-
Photo.com or iStockphoto.com is no problem. The genre is popu-
lar, and photos abound. The dancers in the iPod ads all have one 
thing in common: their hands and feet are typically recognizable 
even in silhouette. Keep this in mind while searching online image 
archives. Another important feature to look for in stock images for 
this project is a solid-colored background, preferably white.
1.	 Choose the Fuzzy Select tool from the Toolbox, and click 
on the white background to create an initial selection. For 
this image, the click should be near the light shadow by the 
lower hand. Hold the shift key and make additional clicks 
to extend the selection. Clean up the selection of the back-
ground by using the Quick Mask and by growing the selec-
tion (Select4Grow) by 1 pixel.
An accurate selection isn’t required for this project, but the silhouette 
will benefit from adjustments around the hand and white spaces at the 
end of the jacket arm, the sneaker, and the armband.

4.11  iPod   213
2.	 The selection created is of the background, so invert it 
(Select4Invert) to create a selection of the dancer. 
3.	 Copy (ctrl-C) and paste (ctrl-V) the selection into a new 
layer (Layer4To New Layer). Name the layer Silhouette. 
4.	 Enable the Lock Alpha option for the new layer, then fill the 
layer with black. 
5.	 Remember that it’s better not to modify the original image so 
it can be used again later if needed, so add a new white layer 
and move it below the Silhouette layer. 
Adding a white layer named White Background below the Silhouette removes 
the shadow from the original image. A shadow will be added back in later, 
but it will be more in style with the iPod ad. 
The dancer silhouette needs a little cleanup. Notice where 
the scarf and jacket fall away from the body in the original pic-
ture. In the silhouette these are not helpful features. 
1.	 Use the Free Select tool to drag selections around most of 
these, then switch to Quick Mask mode to detail the area to 
be selected using a hard-edged brush. 
2.	 Switch back to selection mode and cut the selections. Don’t 
fill the selection with white! The silhouette is on a layer of its 
own with transparency around it. Editing here should replace 
the selected parts of the silhouette with transparency. 
Normally a soft-edged brush is used to blend edges into the background, but 
the iPod style uses hard edges with no blending.
Adding the iPod
Creating the silhouette was easy, and as it turns out, creating the 
iPod is just as easy. Since there isn’t a lot of detail in the device, it 
can be created in a separate image window, copied to the dancer 
window, and then scaled and rotated to fit. Scaling and rotating 
will blur the detail of the device, but because it’s so small and 
lacks detail, that won’t present a problem for this project. 
1.	 Move the silhouette image out of the way for the moment, 
but don’t close it. Open a new image window (File4New) 
with a width of 380 and height of 420. The background color 
doesn’t matter for this task. For now, turn off the visibility of 
the Background layer in the Layers dialog. 

214   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
2.	 Add a transparent layer (Layer4New Layer) to the image 
window. Choose the Rectangle Select tool from the Toolbox. 
In the Tool Options dialog, enable the Rounded Corners 
option, and then set the Radius to 20. 
3.	 Drag through the image window to create a selection with 
rounded corners. The exact dimensions aren’t important, 
though the width should be smaller than the height. Reset 
the foreground and background colors by typing D in the 
canvas window, then drag the background color (white) from 
the Toolbox into the selection. 
4.	 The selection will still be in Edit mode at this point, mean-
ing the selection handles can be used to resize the selection. 
Drag the four sides of the selection inward to form a smaller 
rectangle centered in the upper half of the original, white-
filled rectangle. 
If the selection is no longer in Edit mode but is still active, click inside the 
selection to return to Edit mode. 
5.	 Click on the foreground color box in the Toolbox and change 
the color to a medium gray, with RGB set to 160. Close the 
dialog and drag the foreground color from the Toolbox into 
the image window selection. That creates the iPod display 
window. Remember, this style is very simple so no additional 
detail is required, such as adding depth around the display. 
Even if depth were added, it wouldn’t be seen after the iPod 
was scaled and rotated in the dancer’s image. 
6.	 Use the Ellipse Select tool to drag a circular selection below 
the display window. The selection should span the width of the 
display window even if it’s not circular. Drag the selection 
to position it in the center of the lower half of the iPod case. 
Once again, fill the selection with the foreground color. Clear 
the selection (Select4None). Use the Scale tool from the 
Toolbox to squeeze the iPod until the dial is circular. 
The iPod was created on a single layer (shown over a black background to 
show the scaling amount), so squeezing it to make the dial circular is a simple 
operation that can be done just by eyeballing it. 

4.11  iPod   215
Placing the iPod in a Pocket 
1.	 Copy the iPod layer and paste it into the silhouette image. 
Use the Scale tool to shrink the pasted layer to fit, then rotate 
it to align with an imaginary pants pocket. Hold down the 
ctrl key while scaling to keep the aspect ratio for the device. 
Use the Rotate tool to rotate the iPod, then use the Move 
tool to position it near a pants pocket. 
2.	 Add a white layer mask to the iPod layer. Use the Paintbrush 
tool and a hard-edged brush to black out a small part of the 
bottom of the iPod, leaving just a bit of the dial visible. This 
simulates the iPod being in a pocket (though not for long, 
the way this guy’s dancing). 
The position of the pocket is up to the artist. Alternative options include 
attaching the iPod to an arm or placing it in a shirt pocket.
Drawing the Earphones
1.	 Add a transparent layer and name it Earphones. Before draw-
ing the paths, select a brush to draw the wires. A hard-edged 
brush, such as the Calligraphic brush, works well if scaled 
appropriately for an image of this size. The selected brush 
will be used to stroke the paths. Choose the Paintbrush tool 
and enable Basic Dynamics in the Tool Options dialog. Also, 
set the foreground color to white in the Toolbox by typing D 
followed by X in the image window. 
2.	 Choose the Paths tool from the Toolbox and click near the 
dancer’s left ear (or where that ear should be). Drag in the 
canvas to where the wire should meet the iPod. Click on the 
line you just made to adjust the shape of the wire. 
The wires will probably require more fine-tuning than anything else in 
this project, since they and the iPod are the most identifiable features. 
3.	 Click the Stroke Path button at the bottom of the Paths dia-
log. This will open the Stroke Path dialog. Choose to stroke 
using the Paintbrush, which will utilize the brush selected 
earlier. For added effect, click the Enable Brush Dynamics 
option. This causes the brushstroke to fade in and out at 
both ends of the path. Finally, click the Stroke button to 
apply the brushstroke along the path. Repeat this process 
for a wire coming from the right ear and connecting to the 
first wire at the chest. 

216   Chapter 4: Advertising and Special Effects 
Placing the Final Shadow
The last major component of this design is a shadow under the 
dancer. Like the silhouette, shadows in iPod advertisements are hard 
edged. As it turns out, that makes creating the shadow fairly easy. 
1.	 In the Layers dialog, duplicate the Silhouette layer and rename 
the duplicate layer Shadow. Move this layer below the Silhou-
ette layer in the Layers dialog. Select the Perspective tool 
from the Toolbox and click in the canvas to display the drag 
handles. Drag the upper left handle straight down and the 
upper right handle down and to the left, then hit enter to 
accept the changes. 
The shadow layer may need to be moved slightly after the perspective is 
applied so that it matches up with the dancer’s hand. 
2.	 Add a white layer mask to the shadow layer. Type D in the 
canvas to reset the foreground color to black. Choose the 
Gradient tool from the Toolbox, and in the Tool Options 
dialog make sure the Gradient Reverse button is set so the 
gradient flows from white to black. Drag in the canvas from 
the dancer’s hand to near the upper left of the shadow layer 
to apply a fade-out to the shadow. Finally, reduce the opacity 
of the shadow layer to 80 percent. 
Further Exploration
The Perspective tool will open a dialog when you click on the 
image window, but this dialog is of little value to most users. It 
shows a transformation matrix, which is nifty if you’re into math 
but of less help to this type of design work. Ignore the dialog 
and just drag the handles in the image window. Then hit enter 
to accept the changes. 
Also, the drag handles are not bound to the viewable dimen-
sions of the image. Zoom out on the image window to drag handles 
outside the visible edge of the canvas. This will allow the perspec-
tive layer to flow out to the edge of the image and beyond. Of 
course, what flows outside the visible edge of the canvas won’t be 
included in the final image, but that’s a design choice.
The shadow in this project didn’t flow to the image borders, 
but there’s no reason it couldn’t. In fact, adjusting the shadow 
provides a very specific feel to the design because it lets the viewer 
know the direction from where the light is shining.
You can splash a little color into this by adding color to the 
white background. In the end, the simplicity of the iPod style is 
what makes it both easy to identify with and, for GIMP users, easy 
to reproduce. 

Tips for Advertising and Special Effects   217
Tips for Advertising and Special Effects
Keep the following suggestions in mind as you apply GIMP tools 
and techniques to designing web and print ads.
Create 3-D Effects
Light and shadows are the key components of 3-D effects. If you 
want to add an extra dimension to your work, first determine the 
direction of the lighting. Then use GIMP tools to increase the 
light on the surfaces that face the light and decrease the light on 
the surfaces that would be in shadow. 
Add Texture
No surface is completely devoid of texture, not even glass. Wood 
grains, brushed metal, and scratches can all be created by using 
the Noise filters in combination with the Motion Blur filter.
Use Layer Modes
Layer modes can be used to merge white reflections with textures. 
Try the Overlay mode to darken images or the Soft Light and 
Grain Merge modes to lighten and blend.
Reflect with Gradients
A gradient in a box doesn’t look like much. But a gradient applied 
inside a shape like a circle or a rectangle can look like a reflection. 
Play with the Blend tool’s gradients—many of them can produce 
reflective effects.
Emboss the Easy Way
The Emboss filter (Filters4Distorts4Emboss) and the Bump 
Map filter (Filters4Map4Bump Map) both work quite well, but 
text-embossing effects are so easy to achieve, you might as well 
do things manually. Just duplicate, offset, blur, and cut. To make 
matters even easier, the blur and cut steps are optional.
Eliminate the Jaggies
GIMP no longer leaves many “jaggies” after performing transforms 
such as rotations or shearing, but if you find any, you can apply a 
light blur to layer edges to clear those up. Zoom out to view the 
edges of a layer extending beyond the canvas area. A few jaggies 
along the edge of a package where the front and side images 
meet may not be such a bad thing—they can provide contrast to 
show there’s an actual edge where common colors blend. Blur-
ring the jagged edges may give you even better contrast.
Don’t Worry About Horizontal Alignment
Don’t try to align horizontal elements before applying perspec-
tive transformations when creating the front and side images 
for packaging projects. Applying a perspective change to any 
side will likely distort those horizontal elements so they become 
unaligned. Instead, avoid adding or using horizontal lines that 
need to align on the front and side of a package.
Watch Your Canvas Size
Bigger canvases take up more memory. A plain white canvas set 
to print at the size of a sheet of legal paper takes up 20 to 30MB 
just sitting there. Images destined for the Web are usually created 
at 98 ppi, however, and this greatly reduces the project’s file sizes.

Chapter 1 covered some of the basics of using text in GIMP. 
In Chapter 5, you’ll see how you can use lighting, shadows, color, 
texture, shape, and perspective to make the most of fonts.
GIMP isn’t designed to be used as a font editor; it’s a graphic 
design tool. But what you can do with text in GIMP is far more 
interesting than what you can do with a font editor. GIMP offers 
you the ability to alter the environment in which the font is dis-
played. No matter which of the available fonts you use, you can 
alter the depth, color, and texture for a text string. And that 
broadens your graphic design possibilities in much more mean-
ingful ways.
GIMP’s Text Tools
The toolbox has a single tool for working with text: the Text 
tool. When you select this tool,  GIMP opens the Tool Options 
dialog, in which you can choose a font and size and adjust other 

220   Chapter 5: Type Effects
text formatting such as color and alignment. Text can be typed 
directly in the canvas window for WYSIWYG editing of short 
phrases or you can use the Text Editor dialog for larger blocks of 
text. Text entered in either window appears immediately in the 
current layer and incorporates the Text tool’s current settings.  
The Tool Options dialog (left) for the Text tool and the optional Text Editor 
dialog. Short phrases can be typed directly in the canvas. Longer text blocks 
are more easily loaded into the Text Editor. 
You’ll use the Text tool, its Tool Options dialog, and the Text 
Editor in all of the tutorials in Chapter 5, but the text itself is only 
the starting point. Any time you work with text, your goal is to 
convey a particular message, and the words you choose are only 
the first step. An image editor like GIMP really allows you to get 
creative with text in raster effects. 
Text is rendered directly in the layer as you type.
Predefined Text Effects
GIMP provides a wide set of predefined text effects, from Chalk 
to Chrome to Frosty to Textured. If you need to achieve a certain 
effect but don’t have time to tinker, these predefined effects are 
the ticket. All of the predefined effects can be accessed by choos-
ing File4Create4Logos from any canvas menu. Clicking any 
option in this menu will open a dialog in which you can select 
fonts and colors and set a variety of other options. The truth, 
however, is that these ready-made tools have their limitations, 
and you won’t rely on them in the following tutorials. To achieve 
something really unique, you need to do it yourself.

Chapter 5: Type Effects﻿   221
Create ready-made logos by accessing 
the File4Create4Logos menu.
All the text logo filters, like the Chrome filter shown here, allow you to adjust 
a few settings, but the results are usually pretty predictable.
Creating Your Own Type Effects
Now it’s time for you to explore GIMP’s Text tool while creating 
your own effects, such as shadows and erosion. The following 
tutorials will teach you how GIMP can transform run-of-the-mill 
characters into a stunning graphic message.

222   Chapter 5: Type Effects
5.1 
Chrome and Metal Text
Metallic finishes are most often applied to text, but you can also 
utilize these general-purpose textures in user-interface design. 
Metallic finishes are created with the Curves dialog. Adjusting 
the curves of either a gradient or a smooth texture causes gradual 
changes in tone to become more dramatic and produces the 
appearance of shiny metal. This set of tutorials shows you how to 
create three different metal effects.
High contrast, generated with the Curves dialog, gives these examples a 
metallic appearance.
Brushed Metal
The brushed-metal effect is the product of two basic processes. 
First you apply the Motion Blur filter, which makes it look as 
though the surface is covered with tiny scratches. Applying noise 
to a layer adds texture to otherwise flat images. Then you adjust 
the image’s gray tones in the Curves dialog. Adjusting the Value 
curve for an image with nonlinear variations—that is, an image 
with gray randomly distributed in the layer—­accelerates the 
change from black to white and mimics reflective metal. The 
final effect is enhanced by extruding the letter into three 
dimensions.
The letter S is made to look like 
brushed metal.
Creating the Text
Begin by opening a new canvas using the default 640 × 400 tem-
plate. A white background is fine, or you can try another color if 
you choose. Turn off the visibility of the Background layer.
1.	 Choose the Text tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog, choose an appropriate font. In this example, I’ve used 
a font called Gilde Broad Thin sized to 500 pixels. At this size 
the font is thick enough to show the brushed metal texture 
clearly; the subtle effect can be lost in fonts with thinner char-
acters. Set the text color to white in the Tool Options dialog.
2.	 Click the canvas layer and type the letter S.
3.	 Use the Align tool to align the text layer. In the Tool Options 
dialog, set the Relative to option to Image and click the layer. 
Then click the Align Center and Align Middle buttons just 
below this menu.
4.	 Match the text layer to the canvas size (Layer4Layer to 
Image Size). 

5.1  Chrome and Metal Text   223
Use the Align tool to position the text on the center of the canvas.
Extruding the Text with the Bump Map Filter
1.	 Duplicate the text layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer). Name this 
layer Blurred.
2.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur) and apply a blur of 10 pixels to the duplicate layer.
3.	 Click the original text layer in the Layers dialog to make it 
active.
4.	 Open the Bump Map filter (Filters4Map4Bump Map). 
Choose Sinusoidal from the Map Type drop-down menu, 
and then choose the Blurred layer from the Bump Map drop-
down menu. Set the Azimuth to 132 degrees, set the Eleva-
tion to 30 degrees, and set the Depth to 7. Click OK to apply 
the filter. 
Sinusoidal mapping produces a more realistic three-
dimensional effect with edges that are less rounded than 
those produced by the Linear and Spherical options. The 
Azimuth slider sets the direction of lighting within 360 degrees. 
The Elevation slider changes the roundness of the edges, 
and the Depth slider sets the softness of the shadowed sides. 
To get the most out of this tutorial, I’ve chosen values to 
accentuate depth.
Use a light blur and the Bump Map filter to extrude the letter S into three 
dimensions.
5.	 Turn on the Lock Alpha Channel option for the original S 
layer. Turn off the visibility of the Blurred layer.
6.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter again (Filters4Blur4Gauss-
ian Blur) and apply a blur of 10 pixels. This softens the sha­
dow edges a bit, making the sides appear more rounded with-
out blurring into the transparent areas.
7.	
Duplicate the original layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer). With 
the duplicate layer active, select the text by choosing Layer4 
Transparency4Alpha to Selection.
8.	 Press D to reset the default foreground and background 
colors.
9.	 Choose the Blend tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog, set the Mode to Grain Merge and the Gradient to FG 
to Transparent. Drag from the upper-left corner of the can-
vas to the lower-right corner. Then drag from the bottom of 
the canvas to the top.

224   Chapter 5: Type Effects
10.	 In the Layers dialog, set the Mode to Soft Light.
11.	 Press ctrl-shift-A to deselect all.
Blending enhances the three-dimensional effect. This isn’t required to achieve 
the brushed-metal appearance, but it gives you an interesting logo.
Adding a Metallic Finish 
1.	 Merge the gradient layer and the original S layer (Layer4 
Merge Down).
2.	 Open the Curves dialog (Colors4Curves), and adjust the 
curve for the Value channel to closely resemble that shown 
here. The actual setting will vary, depending on the variation 
in gray tones in your layer. Click OK. This will be the first vis-
ible change that looks a bit metallic.
3.	 Duplicate the layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer).
4.	 Select the letter in this duplicate layer by choosing Layer4 
Transparency4Alpha to Selection.
5.	 Use the RGB Noise filter to fill the selection with noise 
(Filters4Noise4 RGB Noise). Uncheck the Correlated 
noise and Independent RGB checkboxes. Set all three 
color channel sliders to 0.44 and set the Alpha slider 
to 0. Click OK to apply this filter. Desaturate this layer 
(Colors4Desaturate). 
The RGB Noise filter fills the selection with random 
dots—in this case, the dots are colored and must be desatu­
rated. Setting the color channel sliders to 0.44 increases the 
noise. (Higher values mean more noise, and lower values 
mean less noise.) The alpha channel is not used here.
6.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur) and apply a blur of 2 pixels. 
7.	
With the text still selected, use the Motion Blur filter to 
further blur the layer (Filters4Blur4Motion Blur). Set the 
Angle to 45 degrees and set the Length to 20 pixels.
Add noise to the text and use the Curves dialog to increase the separa-
tion of dark and light noise.
8.	 The last step is to add the blue tint that gives metal its shiny 
appearance. Add a new layer (Layer4New Layer). Name 
it Tint.
9.	 Click the foreground color box to launch the Change Fore-
ground Color dialog and set the RGB values to 16/59/130. 
Click OK to close the dialog. Drag the foreground color into 
the selection in the new layer to fill it with that color. (The 
letter you selected in step 4 should still be selected.) 

5.1  Chrome and Metal Text   225
Adding a blue tint completes the effect.
10.	 Deselect all (ctrl-shift-A), and then set the layer mode to 
Soft Light and reduce the Opacity to 52 percent.
11.	 Set the Mode of the next layer down in the Layers dialog to 
Grain Extract and its Opacity to 60 percent. Use the Gauss-
ian Blur filter to apply a blur of 2 pixels to the original text 
layer. That’s it! Just these few steps produce the results you 
see here.
12.	 Turn on the Background layer visibility again. Then add a 
drop shadow to better see the effect.
Heavy Metal
The heavy-metal effect is similar to the brushed-metal effect, 
but it uses the Solid Noise filter to produce a cloudy texture and 
relies on more dramatic curves adjustment to achieve a polished, 
reflective appearance.
Heavy metal looks more polished than brushed metal.
Creating the Text
As in the previous tutorial, start by opening a new canvas using 
the default 640 × 400 template.
1.	 Hide the Background layer by turning off its visibility in the 
Layers dialog.
2.	 Press D to reset the default foreground and background col-
ors, and then press X to swap them.
3.	 Choose the Text tool from the toolbox and pick an appropri-
ate font. Change the text color to white. For this tutorial, I 
chose GraverplateExtrabold Thin, a font that uses uppercase 
characters for lowercase characters (known as small caps). 
This font’s wide surfaces make the heavy-metal effect easier 
to see. I set the font size to 182 pixels and reduced the letter 
space until the E and T abut each other.
N o t e 	
When trying to achieve this effect, always choose a font that’s 
solid (rather than outlined) and has thick characters. If you’d 
like to use a particular font but the characters seem too thin, 
the bold version of that font might work. 
4.	 Click in the canvas and type Metal.
5.	 Use the Align tool to center the text layer within the canvas.
6.	 Resize the text layer to match the image size (Layer4Layer 
to Image Size).

226   Chapter 5: Type Effects
Using a thick font will make it easier to see the final effect.
Adding Depth
1.	 Clear any selections (ctrl-shift-A).
2.	 As you did with the brushed metal effect, you’ll now extrude 
the text. Note that in this tutorial the extruding isn’t optional. 
The depth created along the edges of the text creates reflec-
tion variations that contribute to the heavy metal effect. Start 
by duplicating the text layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer). Name 
the duplicate layer Blurred.
3.	 Use the Gaussian Blur filter to apply a blur of 10 pixels to 
the duplicate layer. 
4.	 Click the original text layer to make it active.
5.	 Open the Bump Map filter (Filters4Map4Bump Map). 
Set the Bump Map option to the Blurred layer. Set the Map 
Type to Linear and check the Compensate for darkening 
checkbox. Set the Azimuth to 130 degrees, the Elevation to 
30 degrees, and the Depth to 7. Click OK to apply this filter 
to the layer. 
The Bump Map filter makes the original text appear three-dimensional.
6.	 At this point, you can delete the duplicate layer. Hide the 
Blurred layer by turning off its visibility in the Layers dialog.
7.	
Duplicate the original text layer. Name the new layer Cloud.
8.	 Select the text by choosing Layer4Transparency4Alpha to 
Selection.
9.	 Fill the selection with a cloud rendered from the Solid Noise 
filter (Filters4Render4Clouds4Solid Noise), as discussed 
in Section 1.10. Set the Random Seed to 0. Set the X Size to 
10 and the Y Size to 2.
10.	 The Random Seed value is used to change the shape of the 
cloud, so feel free to try different values as you experiment. 
When set to 0, the random seed value used here, you should 
end up with the same cloud structure as I did. However, 
because the cloud is rendered only within the selection, you 
won’t actually see it. You’ll just see various shades of gray 
inside the selection.
11.	 With the selection still active, open the Motion Blur fil-
ter (Filters4Blur4Motion Blur). Set the Angle slider to 
95 degrees and the Length slider to 20, and then apply the 
filter to the layer. Deselect all (ctrl-shift-A). The Motion 
Blur filter turns the clouds into what look more like reflec-
tions of light. 

5.1  Chrome and Metal Text   227
12.	 Set this layer’s mode to Grain Merge to brighten the cloud 
layer and give the look of highly reflective metal.
13.	 Merge this layer with the layer in which you originally applied 
the Bump Map filter (Layer4Merge Down).
Use the Solid Noise filter to render a cloud on the text. Then apply the 
Motion Blur filter.
Adding a Metallic Finish
This effect can be further improved by increasing the contrast 
between light and dark areas.
1.	 Open the Curves dialog (Colors4Curves) and apply a curve 
like the one shown here. This gives you the basic metallic 
effect, but you can still enhance it further.
2.	 Add a drop shadow (Filters4Light and Shadow4Drop 
Shadow). Set the Offset X and Offset Y values to −2 pixels 
to move the shadow up and to the left and set the Blur  
Radius to 10 pixels. Apply this to the image. 
3.	 Perhaps the edges of the text are too soft and need a more 
punched-out look. You can sharpen the edges of the text and 
get that punched-out appearance by stroking with a gray out-
line. Select the text in this layer by choosing Layer4Trans-
parency4Alpha to Selection. Grow the selection by 2 pixels 
(Select4Grow).
4.	 Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer 
and setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name the 
new layer Outline.
The Curves adjustment brings out the metal appearance while the drop 
shadow will let the effect stand out on the page.
5.	 Click the Foreground color icon in the Toolbox and set the 
foreground color to gray by typing a4a4a4 in the HTML 
notation field of the Change Foreground Color dialog. Click 
OK and close the dialog.
6.	 Open the Stroke Selection dialog (Edit4Stroke Selection) 
and set the Line Width to 2 pixels. Click the Stroke button 
to stroke the selection.
7.	
Deselect all (ctrl-shift-A).
8.	 Change the Mode for the Outline layer to Multiply.
9.	 Shiny metals like chrome have a bluish tint, so you should add 
that for realism. Add a new layer (Layer4New Layer) named 
Color and fill it with blue, setting the RGB values to 16/59/130. 
Drag the foreground color from the Toolbox into the canvas.

228   Chapter 5: Type Effects
10.	 Set the Mode for this blue layer to Soft Light and reduce 
the Opacity to 53 percent. Turn on the visibility of the Back-
ground layer to see result of your labor.
Stroking the outline of the original text in gray and blending in color 
using the Soft Light mode gives the text a more punched-out look.
Liquid Metal
Using the Curves dialog made a big improvement to the metal 
effect in the Heavy Metal tutorial. But where you can go from 
there—what else can you do with metallic text? Take the process 
one step further: add non-text components to the image.
Here you simulate liquid metal. GIMP provides  
the heat, of course. 
Creating the Text
1.	 With the toolbox selected, press D to reset and then swap the 
default foreground and background colors. Then open a new 
canvas window at the default size. Turn off the Background 
layer visibility.
2.	 Choose the Text tool from the toolbox. Pick a large, thick 
font—I used Arial Black sized to 220 pixels. As in the Heavy 
Metal tutorial, a thicker font makes the effect easier to see. In 
this case, you also want a font with lowercase letters and dots 
over letters like i and j. These elements will enhance the melt-
ing effect. Once you’ve chosen an appropriate font, set the 
font color to white.
3.	 Click the canvas and type the word Liquid. When you’ve fin-
ished, click OK to close the Text Editor.
4.	 Use the Align tool to center the text layer.
5.	 Expand the layer boundary to the image size (Layer4Layer 
to Image Size). 
A thick font is essential for this effect. With thin fonts, the metal’s reflective 
nature is harder to distinguish.

5.1  Chrome and Metal Text   229
Liquefying the Letters
1.	 Use the Free Select tool to draw a round selection beneath 
the first letter. Hold down the shift key to draw more selec-
tions beneath the text. Using the shift key (or Add mode in 
the Tool Options dialog) allows you to add the new selection 
to the existing selection, even if the new selection doesn’t 
physically touch the existing selection. Make sure the selec-
tions overlap portions of each letter.
2.	 After you’ve drawn a few selections, grow them by 1 pixel 
(Select4Grow) to soften the edges of the hand-drawn 
selections.
3.	 Fill the selections with white by dragging the foreground 
color box from the toolbox into the image.
4.	 Deselect all (ctrl-shift-A).
Hand-drawn selections are added to the text layer and filled with white.
5.	 Open the Waves filter (Filters4Distorts4Waves). Set the 
Amplitude to 6, the Phase to 107, and the Wavelength to 29. 
Click OK to apply this filter. 
The text and blobs below them will be distorted in a wavy 
fashion—the effect will depend on which font you chose for 
this tutorial. If you chose a different font, you may have to 
experiment with different settings for the Waves filter.
6.	 Name this layer Blobs and then duplicate it (Layer4Dupli-
cate Layer).
7.	
Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian) 
and apply a blur of 10 pixels. Name this blurred layer Blur. 
Click the Blobs layer to make it active again.
The Waves filter does the real work in this tutorial. The blurred layer sets the 
stage for you to add depth with the Bump Map filter.
Adding Depth and Polish
1.	 Open the Bump Map filter (Filters4Map4Bump Map) and 
use the Blur layer to apply the filter to the Blobs layer. Set the 
Map Type to Linear and check the Compensate for darken-
ing checkbox. Set the Azimuth to 130 degrees, the Elevation 
to 30 degrees, and the Depth to 7. Click OK to apply this filter. 
2.	 Turn off the visibility of the Blur layer.
3.	 Duplicate the Blobs layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer). Create a 
selection of the bump map in this duplicate layer by choosing 
Layer4Transparency4Alpha to Selection.

230   Chapter 5: Type Effects
4.	 Fill the duplicate layer with solid noise (Filters4Render4 
Clouds4Solid Noise). 
5.	 Open the Motion Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Motion Blur). 
Set the Length to 20 and the Angle to 95 degrees. Click OK 
to apply this filter.
6.	 Set the Mode for the duplicate layer to Grain Merge, and then 
merge it with the original Blobs layer (Layer4Merge Down).
As in the Heavy Metal tutorial, use noise and blurring to simulate 
reflections. 
7.	
Deselect all (ctrl-shift-A).
8.	 Open the Curves dialog and adjust the Value curve as 
shown here.
9.	 Add a new layer (Layer4New Layer), fill it with blue as 
before, and set the Mode for the new layer to Soft Light.
Adding a color layer makes it look as though an object is reflected in the 
metallic surface.
Further Exploration
This final version could be improved by more carefully control-
ling the distortion of the text. You could do this by using the 
IWarp filter instead of the Waves filter, for example. Additional 
color could be added as well. Try adding red and yellow layers 
with solid noise layer masks to make it look as though the let-
ters are hot—there must be some reason why the metal is liquid, 
right?

5.2  Gel Type   231
5.2 
Gel Type
The gel effect shown here is nothing more than soft shadows, 
smooth surfaces, and white reflections. Imagine how water in a 
glass tube looks and you get the idea. Gel effects are especially 
popular in web design, but you’ll see them used in many different 
contexts. The Mac OS X user interface incorporates what Apple 
calls the Aqua style, which utilizes gel effects in shades of blue.
Looks like gel, doesn’t it?
The process described in this tutorial can be applied to text, 
borders, and buttons—just about any surface. Depending on the 
settings you use for the Curves dialog, the Lighting Effects filter, 
and the Bump Map filter, your results may be different from mine. 
What you should take away from this process is how to use bump 
maps, lighting effects, and layer modes.
Creating the Text
Reset the foreground and background colors by pressing D in 
the image window. Then start with a canvas set to the default size 
(640 × 400 pixels).
1.	 Click the foreground color box to open the Change Fore-
ground Color dialog and choose a nice blue. I’ve set the RGB 
levels to 0/51/222 for this shade.
2.	 Choose the Text tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog, choose a serif font. This tutorial uses Bookplate Thin 
with the font size set to 280 pixels. Serif fonts work best here 
because their characters are easily rounded by the process 
that follows. Click the canvas and type Gel.
3.	 Use the Align tool to center the new layer in the canvas.
4.	 Choose Layer4Layer to Image Size to expand the text layer 
to the boundary of the image.
When using the Text tool, you can also change the text color by clicking the 
color swatch in the Tool Options dialog.
Rounding the Surface of the Text 
1.	 Create a selection around the text by choosing Layer4 
Transparency4Alpha to Selection.
2.	 Shrink the selection by 2 pixels (Select4Shrink) and feather 
it by 2 pixels (Select4Feather).

232   Chapter 5: Type Effects
Create a selection of the text, and then shrink and feather it. The dark edges 
on the letters in this Quick Mask view of the selection show that the selection 
is smaller than the lettering.
3.	 Click the foreground color box to open the Change Fore-
ground Color dialog and set the RGB values to 31/82/255 
for a slightly brighter shade of blue. 
4.	 Create a new layer by choosing Layer4New Layer or click-
ing the New Layer button in the Layers dialog. Name the 
new layer Bump Map.
5.	 Click the Bump Map layer in the Layers dialog to make it 
active, and then fill the selection with the foreground color 
by dragging it from the toolbox into the selection.
6.	 Deselect all (Select4None).
7.	
Duplicate the layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer). Name the 
duplicate layer Blur.
8.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur) and apply a blur of 10 pixels to the Blur layer.
9.	 Click the Bump Map layer to make it active.
10.	 Open the Bump Map filter (Filters4Map4Bump Map). Set 
the Azimuth to 105 degrees, the Elevation to 5.75 degrees, 
and the Depth to 10. Set the Map type to Linear, check the 
Compensate for darkening checkbox, and choose the Blur 
layer from the Bump Map drop-down menu. Click OK to 
apply the filter to the Bump Map layer.
The blurred edges of the duplicate layer are used as input to the Bump 
Map filter to simulate depth. Use the Bump Map filter to add depth.
11.	 Set the Bump Map layer’s mode to Addition.
12.	 You’ll need to make a color adjustment to the Bump Map 
layer in order to make the text look more gel-like. Open the 
Curves dialog (Colors4Curves) and set the curve as shown 
here. When the visibility of the Blur layer is turned off, you 
can see that the Bump Map layer appears brighter.

5.2  Gel Type   233
Adjusting the Curves dialog for the Bump Map layer gives the text a gel-like 
appearance, but be sure to turn off the visibility of the Blur layer in the Layers 
dialog to see the changes. 
N o t e 	
We won’t be using the Blur layer again until later in this 
project, so turn off its visibility for now to make the rest of 
your work easier to see.
Adding Lighting Effects
Now you’ll apply one more filter to the Bump Map layer.
1.	
Open the Lighting Effects filter (Filters4Light and Shadow4 
Lighting Effects). On the Options tab, click and drag the 
blue dot to the upper-left corner of the preview. The blue dot 
represents your light source. Position the blue dot so the gel 
text is highlighted to your taste. It’s tricky! If you lose the dot, 
disable this light (by changing the Type in the Light tab to 
None and then selecting a different light from the Light Set-
tings menu) and create a new one.
Positioning the light source in the preview can be difficult.  
Don’t be afraid to click Cancel and try again.
2.	 On the Light tab, choose Directional from the Type drop-
down menu. Your blue dot now is associated with a line 
representing the direction of your light source. The Intensity 
setting you select has a great impact on the overall effect, 
as do the changes you made in the Curves dialog. I set the 
Intensity to 1.15. If you aren’t pleased with the gel effect, 
experiment by adjusting this value or adding additional 
lights. Click OK to apply the Lighting Effects filter.
Of all the Lighting Effects filter’s settings, the Intensity 
setting has the greatest impact.
3.	 Once the Lighting Effects filter has been applied, offset the 
Bump Map layer by −2/−2 pixels (Layer4Transform4Offset).
4.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur) and apply a blur of 5 pixels to that layer.

234   Chapter 5: Type Effects
A soft blur smooths the edges, giving the text a more realistic gel-like 
appearance.
Lightening the Text and Adding a Drop 
Shadow
To bring out the curved surface of the gel, you can increase the 
contrast in the text and add a background shadow. If you turned 
off the visibility of the Blur layer, turn it back on to continue with 
this project.
1.	 Make sure the Blur layer is active in the Layers dialog. 
Duplicate this layer by choosing Layer4Duplicate Layer 
(the duplicate layer will be named Blur copy by default).
2.	 Offset the Blur copy layer by 2/2 pixels (Layer4Transform4 
Offset).
3.	 Click the original Blur layer to make it active, and then offset 
it by −2/−2 pixels (Layer4Transform4Offset).
4.	 Set the Blur layer’s mode to Addition and set the Blur copy 
layer’s mode to Screen.
Revisit the Blur layer and use it to lighten the gel coloring even more.
5.	 Click the Gel text layer to make it active. Add a drop shadow 
(Filters4Light and Shadow4Drop Shadow) offset by 4 pix-
els and blurred by 6 pixels.

5.2  Gel Type   235
Now that the text is so light, it fades into the white background. Adding a 
drop shadow helps the effect stand out.
Further Exploration
The basic process for creating gel effects is the same no matter 
what kind of surface you modify. To add variety, try using differ-
ent colors for the gel or using the Waves or IWarp filters to add 
distortions.

236   Chapter 5: Type Effects
5.3 
Distressed Text
In interior design, distressing is used to give furniture an aged 
and weathered appearance. In graphic design, it serves a simi-
lar purpose—it gives clean and crisp objects, such as text, more 
visual interest. While it would be possible to design a complete 
font set around this effect, premade effects always limit an artist’s 
design options. Adding your own personal touches is tough if 
every F in your text looks exactly the same. 
An example of distressed text
Creating the Text
1.	 With the toolbox selected, press D to set the foreground color 
to black.
2.	 Open a white canvas set to the default size (640 × 400 pixels).
3.	 Click the Text tool to make it active, and then select an 
appropriate font in the Tool Options dialog. This example 
uses SoutaneBlack Thin, whose thick characters make it easier 
to see the distressed effect, set to a font size of 80 pixels.
4.	 Click in the canvas and type BRoKEN SPARRoWS, using low-
ercase for the letter o, just to add a little pizzazz. Press enter 
to add a line break between the words and then insert a few 
spaces before the word SPARRoWS. 
5.	 Use the Align tool to center the text on the canvas.
6.	 Choose Layer4Layer to Image Size to expand the text layer 
to the boundary of the image.
7.	
Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New 
Layer. Name it Distressed and set the Layer Fill Type to 
Transparency. 
The distressed text effect is easier to see if you start with a thick font.
Creating a Distressed Layer
The next part is the hardest. You’re going to add a series of ver-
tical lines of varying widths to be used as the basis for the dis-
tressed effect. The difficulty here will be in positioning the lines 
randomly over the letters.
1.	 Turn on the image grid (View4Show Grid) and set GIMP to 
snap to the grid (View4Snap to Grid). You’ll use the grid to 
make drawing perfectly vertical (and thus parallel) lines easier.

5.3  Distressed Text   237
2.	 Choose the Pencil tool from the toolbox and select the 
Round brush, with the Size set to 1.00 in the Tool Options 
dialog. Draw a single line extending from the top of the can-
vas to the bottom. To do this, click near a grid point at the 
top of the canvas, hold down the shift key, and then click 
near a grid point in the same vertical line as the original 
point at the bottom of the canvas. This will draw a straight 
line 1 pixel in width.
With the help of the image grid and the Snap to Grid option, you can 
draw straight lines with ease.
N o t e 	
You can also draw a straight line without the grid by pressing 
ctrl-shift. This method will constrain the angle of the line to 
15-degree increments.
3.	 Hide the image grid (View4Show Grid) and turn off Snap 
to Grid (View4Snap to Grid). At this point you may also 
want to turn off the visibility of the text layer, though that 
isn’t required.
4.	 Choose the Fuzzy Select tool from the toolbox and use it to 
click the line you just drew with the Pencil tool. You may need 
to zoom in on the line to make clicking it easier.
5.	 Once you’ve selected the line, press ctrl-C to copy it, press 
ctrl-shift-A to deselect all, and press ctrl-V to paste the 
duplicate line as a floating selection. 
6.	 Use the Move tool to move the duplicate line to the right or 
to the left, then click outside the floating selection to anchor 
it to the original layer. Do this a few times, positioning the 
lines randomly across the width of the canvas. When you’ve 
finished, you should have one layer containing many lines. 
Duplicate this layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer).
7.	
Offset the duplicate layer by entering 1 pixel in the Offset X 
field (Layer4Transform4Offset). 
8.	 Merge the active layer with the layer below it by choosing 
Layer4Merge Down. This effectively doubles the width of 
your lines in a single layer. You also could have used a brush 
2 pixels in width from the start, but knowing how to enhance 
effects through duplicating and offsetting layers is a useful 
skill.
These randomly positioned lines will be used to mask out portions of the origi-
nal text.

238   Chapter 5: Type Effects
9.	 With the Distressed layer active, choose the Pencil tool 
again, set the brush Size to 3.00 in the Tool Options dialog, 
and repeat the process described above, this time drawing 
thicker lines overlapping the lines you’ve already positioned. 
Avoid uniformly spacing these thicker lines, and make sure 
they intersect the text here and there. Don’t forget to use the 
grid to draw the first line! 
Making a few lines thicker than others adds more randomness to the 
pattern, but make sure that the lines intersect the text, or you won’t be 
able to see a difference in the final effect.
10.	 Open the Hurl filter (Filters4Noise4Hurl). Set the Ran-
dom Seed to 150, the Randomization to 10 percent, and the 
Repeat to 1 time. The Hurl filter scatters dots in the current 
layer, overwriting pixels if necessary. The Randomization 
value specifies how much of the layer should be filled with 
dots. Higher Repeat values indicate that the filter should 
be applied repeatedly, thus increasing the overall number 
of dots applied. Click OK to apply the Hurl filter to the Dis-
tressed layer. 
11.	 Open the Pick filter (Filters4Noise4Pick). Set the Random 
Seed to 10, the Randomization to 20 percent, and the Repeat 
to 3 times. Click OK to apply this filter to the Distressed layer. 
The Pick filter is similar to the Hurl filter, but it chooses the 
pixels and which color to use for them in a slightly different 
manner. In this case, using the Pick filter makes the dot dis-
tribution more random and introduces some larger dots to 
the pattern. After applying the Hurl and Pick filters, you’ll be 
left with a set of distressed lines.
Using the Hurl and Pick filters creates random noise and makes the lines 
look distressed.
Applying the Distressed Effect to the Text
Now it’s time to blend the distressed lines with the text.
1.	 Invert the colors in the Distressed layer (Colors4Invert).
2.	 The Hurl and Pick filters scattered colored dots in the Dis-
tressed layer, but you’re shooting for a black-and-white effect, 

5.3  Distressed Text   239
so go ahead and desaturate the layer (Colors4Desaturate). 
Make sure to turn back on the visibility of the text layer. 
Change the layer’s mode to Addition.
3.	 Use the Move tool to position the layer as necessary to get the 
best effect.
Because the background is white, the white lines disappear where they 
don’t intersect with the text. If your background is a different color, copy 
the Distressed layer, paste it into a layer mask that you create on the text 
layer (Layer4Mask4Add Layer Mask), and then turn off the visibility of the 
Distressed layer.
Further Exploration
There are many other ways to use the Distressed layer to enhance 
the original text. Try using it as a layer mask on the text layer or 
as a layer mask on a colored or textured layer above the text.  You 
can also extrude distressed text using the Bump Map filter to 
produce an effect that looks like erosion.

Frost
A standard GIMP installation provides several specialty filters, 
including the Sparkle filter (Filters4Light and Shadow4Sparkle), 
which takes specks of white in an image and stretches them out 
into spokes of light. You can use the Sparkle filter to produce 
frost, snow, and icicle effects, but the results are not always ideal, 
because the spokes of light are fairly uniform. This tutorial 
explores other ways to achieve a frost effect.
Chill out with this cool tutorial.
In this tutorial you’ll use the Pick and Slur filters to randomize 
the edges of selections, and then you’ll apply the Wind filter to 
those selections to generate icicles. You used the Pick filter in Sec-
tion 5.3, so you should be familiar with it how it works. The Slur 
filter is a pretty standard noise filter; it works by replacing the color 
of randomly chosen pixels with the color of nearby pixels.
The lesson here is that you’ll seldom find a single filter that 
gives you exactly the effect you need. You’ll have to learn to use 
filters in combination—and in the correct order.
Creating the Background and Text
Open a new white canvas set to the default size (640 × 400 pixels).
1.	 Choose the Blend tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog, click the Reset button, then select Horizon 2 from the 
Gradient menu. This gradient will fill the background with 
what looks like a horizon. Drag down from the top of the can-
vas window past the bottom. When you drag beyond the canvas 
window, you’re effectively stretching the gradient. The result 
is that the simulated horizon is near the bottom edge of the 
canvas. The placement of the horizon doesn’t matter much, 
as you’re just using this blue backdrop to add to the frosty 
feeling of the design. 
Use the Gradient menu in the Tool Options dialog to choose the Horizon 2 
gradient.

5.4  Frost   241
2.	 Duplicate the Background layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer). 
You’ll merge the duplicate Background layer with an embossed 
text layer shortly.
3.	 Choose the Text tool. Set the font color to black and choose 
a thick font. I’ve chosen SoutaneBlack Thin set to 100 pixels. 
Click the canvas and type North Pole.
4.	 Center the text on the canvas using the Align tool.
5.	 Create a selection of the text by choosing Layer4Transpar-
ency4Alpha to Selection. Save the selection to a channel 
(Select4Save to Channel). Click the channel name and 
change it to Outline.
6.	 Deselect all (ctrl-shift-A).
Save the text outline to a channel.
Bringing the Text Forward
1.	 Click the text layer in the Layers dialog and merge it with 
the duplicate Background layer by choosing Layer4Merge 
Down. Click the layer name and change it to Text Layer.
Merge the text layer with a copy of the Background layer in preparation 
for embossing.
2.	 Set the Mode for the Text Layer to Grain Merge. Once the 
text is embossed, the Grain Merge mode will allow the text 
edges to blend with the original Background layer.
3.	
Now you’re ready to emboss the Text Layer (Filters4Distorts4 
Emboss). Use the Emboss function, and then set the Azimuth 
to 313 degrees, the Elevation to 39 degrees, and the Depth to 
19. You may wish to change these settings, depending on the 
font you use, but if you use a thick font, similar settings should 
work well for you. Click OK to apply this filter.
4.	 Right-click the saved Outline channel in the Channels dialog 
and choose Channel to Selection. Remember this process; 
you’ll need to re-create this selection shortly.
5.	 Grow the selection by 2 pixels (Select4Grow).
6.	 Feather the selection by 1.6 pixels (Select4Feather) and 
then invert it (Select4Invert). This will select everything 
but the letters.
7.	
Click the Text Layer in the Layers dialog to make it active. 
Cut this selection from the Text Layer (ctrl-X). This will 
leave behind the embossed text with the colored background. 

242   Chapter 5: Type Effects
The Emboss filter has two function options: Bumpmap and Emboss. For this 
tutorial, use the Emboss option. Notice that the innermost areas of the text 
take on the appearance of the Background layer.
By removing the surrounding portion of the text layer, you get a darker 
background and lighter text, thanks to the Grain Merge mode of the text layer.
8.	 The current selection will still be displayed, but you should 
replace it. Retrieve the Outline channel selection once again. 
Grow this selection by 2 pixels (Select4Grow) and save it to 
another channel. Name this channel Stroked.
9.	 Set the foreground color to white. Working in the new Stroked 
channel, stroke the selection using a Line Width of 3 pixels 
(Edit4Stroke Selection), and then deselect all (ctrl-shift-A). 
Temporarily turn on visibility for this channel so you can see 
what you’re doing in the next few steps.
This technique deviates from those used in previous tutorials. Here the 
stroke operation takes place in a channel, not a layer.
10.	 Open the Pick filter (Filters4Noise4Pick). Set the Random 
Seed to 10, the Randomization slider to 30 percent, and the 
Repeat slider to 2 times. Click OK to apply these settings to 
the Stroked channel. Working in a channel instead of a layer 
allows you to easily create a shape that you can turn into a 
selection later and fill with white in a layer. Not all filters 
work in channels. Fortunately, the noise filters are an excep-
tion, and the results are excellent. 

5.4  Frost   243
Use the Pick filter to add noise to the saved selection channel.
11.	 Open the Slur filter (Filters4Noise4Slur). Set the Random 
Seed to 100, the Randomization slider to 30 percent, and the 
Repeat slider to 3 times. Click OK to apply these settings to 
the Stroked channel.
12.	 The Pick and Slur filters add some random perturbations to 
a layer or selection. The noise filters may produce artifacts at 
the top of the channel. If this happens, make a selection at the 
top of the channel and fill it with black.
Adding Snow
1.	
In the Layers dialog, add a transparent layer and name it Snow.
2.	 Retrieve the Stroked channel as a selection (from the Chan-
nels dialog).
3.	 Use the Rectangle Select tool to crop the selection to half 
the height of the tallest letters. In the Tool Options dialog, 
set the Mode to Subtract. After cutting the bottom half of 
the selection, hit enter to accept the change to the selection.
Using the Rectangle Select tool to crop the Stroked selection.
4.	 Subtract the Outline channel from the current selection. To 
do this, select the Outline channel in the Channels dialog, 
and then hold down the ctrl key while you click the Channel 
to Selection button at the bottom of that dialog. 
5.	 Feather the resulting selection by 3 pixels (Select4Feather).
6.	 Click the Snow layer in the Layers dialog, and then fill the 
selection with white. 
7.	
Deselect all (ctrl-shift-A).

244   Chapter 5: Type Effects
Subtracting the Outline channel from the cropped Stroked selection leaves 
behind a selection that sits on top of the text. When this selection is filled 
with white, it becomes fallen snow on top of the letters.
Creating Falling Snow
You’ve created a cute snow pile on your text, but you can do more 
to enhance this design’s frosty feeling.
1.	
Rotate the image by 90 degrees clockwise (Image4Trans-
form4Rotate 90 degrees clockwise). 
2.	 Press ctrl-J to fit the window to the image. 
3.	 Open the Wind filter (Filters4Distorts4Wind). Set the 
Style to Blast to achieve thicker streaks, set the Direction to 
Right to indicate the direction from which the wind should 
blow, and set the Edge Affected to Leading to indicate that 
the streaks should flow with the wind from the point of impact. 
Set the Threshold slider to 20 and the Strength slider to 5. 
Click OK to apply this filter to the Snow layer.
4.	 Reapply the Wind filter, this time setting the Style to Wind, the 
Direction to Right, and the Edge Affected to Leading. Set 
the Threshold slider to 20 and the Strength slider to 20. The 
second application adds more streaks but softens the overall 
effect.
Rotating the image and applying the Wind filter turns the snow piles into 
falling snow and icicles.
5.	 To add the finishing touches, start by rotating the image 
counterclockwise by 90 degrees (Image4Transform4 
Rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise).
6.	 Resize the canvas to fit the window again.
7.	
Open the Slur filter (Filters4Noise4Slur) again. Set the 
Random Seed to 100, the Randomization slider to 20 per-
cent, and the Repeat slider to 2 times. Click OK to apply this 
filter to the Snow layer. This will add icy particles to the snowy 
streaks.
8.	 Set the Mode for the Snow layer to Grain Merge.

5.4  Frost   245
9.	 Duplicate the Snow layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer), and 
then set the Mode of the duplicate layer to Addition.
10.	 Turn off the visibility of the Stroked channel, if you haven’t 
done so already.
When the duplicate Snow layer is combined with the original Snow layer, 
there’s more snow overall. Set the layer mode to Addition.
Further Exploration
In this tutorial you applied a frosty effect to text, but this effect 
can be applied to just about any surface, whether straight or 
curved. You could even apply it to a photo. Using the same tech-
niques on a photo of a house’s roof line, you could take the scene 
from summer to winter in one day!

Neon Signs
One of the most interesting effects in a digital artist’s bag of 
tricks is the glowing neon sign. This was one of the first tricks 
available to GIMP users, and it’s still one of the easiest to master. 
Neon is a gas that glows reddish-orange when electrically charged. 
Real neon signs are made to glow in different colors by being 
filled with gases (often argon) that emit ultraviolet light. The 
inside of the tube is then lined with phosphors that glow when 
exposed to the ultraviolet light generated by those gases.
It’s time to shed a little light on the subject at hand—neon light, that is.
While science can explain how real neon signs work, using 
GIMP-generated colored light to simulate a glowing neon sign 
requires a little magic. There are many ways to perform this 
magic, but most of them involve using the Emboss filter to trans-
form ordinary lines into 3-D tubes, and all of them use some 
degree of blurring. 
Experimenting with the Built-in Neon Effect
Before digging in, take a look at GIMP’s built-in logo generators. 
The File4Create4Logos menu offers a wide array of ready-made 
logo designs. The logo filter that automatically generates a simple 
neon effect is shown here, though as you can see, its default set-
tings produce an effect that is not quite as interesting as the one 
you’re going to try. While these ready-made logos are fine for 
small projects, you can create an image with more depth and 
character if you build the effect yourself.
The Neon logo effect is fine for small, quick projects.
Creating the Background
Start by creating a background against which the neon light will 
shine on a white canvas set to the default size (640 × 400 pixels).
1.	
Open the Patterns dialog (Dialogs4Patterns), find the Bricks 
pattern, and then drag that pattern onto the canvas. This fills 
the canvas with the selected pattern.

5.5  Neon Signs   247
2.	 Desaturate this layer (Colors4Desaturate).
3.	 Click the foreground color box to launch the Change Fore-
ground Color dialog and set the RGB values to 244/0/0 for 
the deep red shown here. Click OK to close the dialog. 
Setting the mood for Joe’s Bar: The outside wall is made of brick.
4.	 Choose the Bucket Fill tool from the toolbox. In the Tool 
Options dialog, set the Mode to Soft Light and set the 
Affected Area to Fill Whole Selection.
5.	 Click inside the canvas to color the bricks red. 
Preparing the Neon Tubes
Now you’re ready to work on the sign itself.
1.	 Choose the Text tool from the toolbox and then choose a 
font that suits your project. This example uses SoutaneBlack 
Thin sized to 110 pixels, with letter spacing set to 5.0. Thick 
fonts like this work well, especially when you’re still learning 
how to master this technique, but neon signs can have all 
sorts of shapes, so feel free to experiment.
2.	 The text color should be set to the current foreground color, 
but if it isn’t, set the RGB values to 244/0/0 to match the red 
in the background.
3.	 Click the canvas and type Joe’s Bar. Use the Align tool to posi-
tion the text in the center of the canvas.
4.	 Expand the text layer boundary to match the image size 
(Layer4Layer to Image Size). This allows you to add ele-
ments to the layer that would otherwise be cut off by the 
original layer boundary.
After positioning the text, don’t forget to resize the layer by choosing 
Layer4Layer to Image Size.
5.	 Create a selection of the text’s outline by choosing Layer4 
Transparency4Alpha to Selection. Save this selection to a 
channel (Select4Save to Channel), and then double-click 
the channel name and change it to Outline. You’ll use this 
channel again later.
6.	 Grow the selection by 3 pixels (Select4Grow).
7.	
Create a new layer (Layer4New Layer) and name it Stroke. 
Return to the Layers dialog to see the new layer.

248   Chapter 5: Type Effects
8.	 Stroke the selection by choosing Edit4Stroke Selection and 
setting the Line Width to 5 pixels.
9.	 Delete the original text layer and then deselect all (ctrl-
shift-A). You now have the outline for creating the sign’s 
neon tubes.
The stroked outline may be difficult to see. Adding a temporary white 
layer can help. Also, try wider strokes but beware: you may need to 
adjust the letter spacing in the text before you create the selection to 
be stroked! 
10.	 Duplicate the Stroke layer and name the duplicate layer 
Emboss.
11.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur) and apply a blur of 6 pixels to this layer.
12.	 Open the Emboss filter (Filters4Distorts4Emboss). Set the 
Function to Emboss, the Azimuth slider to 43, the Elevation 
slider to 30, and the Depth slider to 43. These settings give 
the Emboss layer a cutout appearance. Click OK to apply this 
filter to the layer.
13.	 Lower the Emboss layer in the Layers dialog by choosing 
Layer4Stack4Lower Layer once.
14.	 Set the Mode for the Emboss layer to Addition.
15.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian Blur) 
and apply a blur of 6 pixels to the original Stroke layer. Set 
the Mode to Grain Merge.
Move the embossed layer below the original text. Setting the layer mode 
to Addition adds this layer to the Background layer and brightens the 
embossed areas.
16.	 Add a drop shadow to this layer (Filters4Light and Shadow4 
Drop Shadow). Offset the drop shadow by setting the Off-
set X and Offset Y values to 8 pixels. Set the Blur Radius to 
6 pixels, set the Opacity slider to 100 percent, and uncheck 
the Allow resizing checkbox. If you were to instead check the 
Allow resizing checkbox, it would resize the canvas and place 
transparent areas around the edges. That’s not what you want 
for this tutorial. Apply this drop shadow.

5.5  Neon Signs   249
17.	 The Stroke layer should still be active, but if it isn’t, click the 
Stroke layer in the Layers dialog to make it active again.
18.	 Add a second drop shadow. This time, set the Offset X and 
Offset Y values to 9 pixels, the Blur Radius to 15 pixels, and 
the Opacity slider to 100 percent. Again, uncheck the Allow 
resizing checkbox. Applying these drop shadows raises the 
neon tubing above the background wall.
19.	 Move the Emboss layer above the Drop Shadow layers but 
below the Stroke layer.
In the Drop Shadow filter, positive Offset X values mean move right, and 
positive Offset Y values mean move down. Note that both drop shadows are 
applied above the Emboss layer.
Adding the Glow
1.	 Add a transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer and 
setting the Layer Fill Type to Transparency. Name the new 
layer Glow.
2.	 Retrieve the Outline channel selection from the Channels 
dialog by clicking that channel and then clicking the Chan-
nel to Selection button.
3.	 Grow the selection by 25 pixels (Select4Grow). Notice that 
growing a selection rounds its edges.
4.	 Feather the selection by 15 pixels (Select4Feather).
5.	 Click the Glow layer in the Layers dialog to make it active. 
Drag the foreground color from the toolbox into the selection 
to fill the selection with that color, and then deselect all 
(ctrl-shift-A).
6.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur) and apply a blur of 20 pixels to the Blur layer. Apply 
this same blur two more times by pressing ctrl-F twice. The 
amount to blur is up to you. Apply the blur a few more times 
if you’d like to soften the edges of the glow even more.
The neon glow starts as a soft-edged, color-filled selection.
7.	
In the Layers dialog, lower the Glow layer to just above the 
Background layer.
8.	 Set the Mode for the Glow layer to Screen.

250   Chapter 5: Type Effects
If you like, you can apply multiple blurs to the Glow layer.
Adding a Glass-Edged Reflection
1.	 Add a new layer (Layer4New Layer). Move it to the top of 
the stack in the Layers dialog and name it Highlight.
2.	 Retrieve the Outline channel selection again. Grow this selec-
tion by 2 pixels (Select4Grow).
3.	 Set the foreground color to white, and then click the High-
light layer in the Layers dialog to make it active again.
4.	 Stroke the selection by choosing Edit4Stroke and setting the 
Line Width to 4 pixels, and then deselect all (ctrl-shift-A).
5.	 Offset this layer by choosing Layer4Transform4Offset and 
setting the Offset X and Offset Y values to −2 pixels.
6.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur) and apply a blur of 2 pixels.
7.	
In the Layers dialog, move the Highlight layer to just below 
the lowest Drop Shadow layer.
8.	 Set the Mode for the Highlight layer to Hard Light.
This last part is what really makes the neon tubes 
look realistic. By adding light, you make the tubes appear 
rounded.
The white Stroke layer picks up color when its mode is set to Hard Light.
Further Exploration
There are thousands of variations on this technique, applicable 
to both text and graphic designs. Try using a piece of clipart 
instead of text. Use the Fuzzy Select tool to make selections of 
disconnected parts of the clipart. The result will be a neon out-
line of your clipart!

5.6  Spray Paint   251
5.6 
Spray Paint
In Section 1.2 you learned the basics of working with layer modes, 
which provide a unique way of merging one layer with another. 
While modes are available for use with all GIMP paint tools, tool-
based modes blend directly within the layer and actually change 
the layer’s pixels. This becomes a problem if you make a long 
series of brushstrokes, for example, and want to backtrack later. 
If you haven’t specified enough undo levels in the Preferences 
dialog, you might not be able to undo some of those strokes.
This isn’t your average graffiti, but the effect is easy to achieve.
Layer modes, on the other hand, don’t change any underlying 
pixels. The blending is done only during compositing, meaning 
it happens when GIMP combines all the layers to generate the dis-
play on the canvas. This sort of blending is nondestructive and 
offers greater flexibility for experimentation.
The spray-paint effect makes use of layer modes to blend a 
painted layer with a textured layer. In the last tutorial, you used 
layer modes to merge the light cast from a neon sign with the 
brick wall behind it. The same process applies to spray-painting 
a textured surface. First you create the surface, then you add a 
spray-paint layer above the first layer, and finally you use a layer 
mode to blend the two together.
Creating the Background
Begin just as you did in the last tutorial, by creating a brick wall. 
Open a new canvas window, using the default size. Click and drag 
the Bricks pattern from the Patterns dialog onto the canvas. Type 
D and X in the canvas area to set the foreground color to white.
Adding a Text Outline
1.	 Choose the Text tool from the toolbox, and in the Tool 
Options dialog, choose a font and font size. This example 
uses XBAND Rough sized to 210 pixels.
2.	 Click the canvas and then type Kilroy. Use the Align tool to 
center the text on the canvas.
3.	 Create a selection of the text (Layer4Transparency4Alpha 
to Selection) and save that selection to a channel (Select4 
Save to Channel).
4.	 Double-click the channel name in the Channels dialog and 
change it to Outline.
5.	 Deselect all (Select4None).

252   Chapter 5: Type Effects
Text color doesn’t matter yet. You just need an outline at this point.
Converting the Text to Spray Paint
1.	 Return to the Layers dialog and delete the text layer.
2.	 Add a new transparent layer by choosing Layer4New Layer 
and setting the layer fill type to Transparency. Name the new 
layer Paint.
3.	 Retrieve the Outline channel selection from the Channels 
dialog, and then grow the selection by 2 pixels (Select4 
Grow) and feather it by 10 pixels (Select4Feather). These 
steps will soften the edges of your selection, enhancing the 
spray-paint effect.
4.	 Click the Paint layer in the Layers dialog to make it active 
again.
5.	 Choose Windows4Dockable Dialogs4Brushes from the 
canvas menu to open the Brushes dialog, and then choose 
the Round brush.
Growing and feathering the text selection, shown via the Quick Mask to 
indicate its soft edges.
6.	 Choose the Airbrush tool from the toolbox. In the Tool 
Options dialog, set the size to 20.
7.	
Click the foreground color box in the toolbox to open the 
Change Foreground Color dialog, type Yellow in the HTML 
field, press enter, and then close the dialog.
8.	 Paint inside the selection with quick, uneven strokes, but don’t 
fill the selection completely. Don’t worry if the text doesn’t 
look exactly like spray paint yet. Deselect all (Select4None).
9.	 Choose the Rotate tool from the toolbox and use it to rotate 
the Paint layer by −20 degrees. 
10.	 Open the IWarp filter (Filters4Distorts4IWarp). Set 
the Deform Radius to 40 pixels, and then drag the mouse 
through the lettering to distort it lightly. This step makes 
the spray-painting appear more random.

5.6  Spray Paint   253
The selection acts as a bounding area for your paint strokes.
Rotating and warping the text gives it a more sprayed-on appearance.
11.	 Duplicate the Paint layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer). Set 
the Mode for the original Paint layer to Color, and then 
set the Mode for the duplicate layer to Grain Merge. These 
layer modes allow the bricks’ shadows and cracks to show 
through your spray-painting.
Changing the layer modes blends the text with the wall beneath it.
12.	 Duplicate the original Paint layer again (Layer4Duplicate) 
and name this layer Drip.
13.	 You’ll reuse a technique you used to create frosty icicles in 
Section 5.4, this time to create paint drips. Start by rotating 
the Drip layer 90 degrees clockwise (Layers4Transform4 
Rotate 90 degrees clockwise).
14.	 Open the Wind filter (Filters4Distorts4Wind). Set the 
Style to Blast, the Direction to Right, and the Edge Affected 
to Both. Then set the Threshold to 3 and the Strength to 20. 
Click OK to apply this filter to the Drip layer.
15.	 Rotate the Drip layer 90 degrees counterclockwise (Layer4 
Transform4Rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise). 
16.	 Set the Mode for the Drip layer to Screen. For an enhanced 
drip effect, duplicate the Drip layer one or more times.

254   Chapter 5: Type Effects
The rotated Drip layer is blasted by the Wind filter.
Further Exploration
What can you take away from this tutorial? You’ve learned that 
simple tools like the Wind filter can serve a wide range of pur-
poses and help you achieve surprisingly numerous effects. You’ve 
already used the Wind filter to create both frosty icicles and drip-
ping paint. What will you create next?

Tips for Type Effects   255
Tips for Type Effects
Advertising, web design, and many other kinds of projects involve 
combining text with images. As you begin working with type in 
your GIMP projects, consider this food for thought.
Make Alignment Easier
Did you find yourself repeatedly creating a text layer and then cen-
tering it on another layer during these tutorials? Use the Align 
tool to make this process a breeze. Remember to click on a layer 
in the canvas, set the Relative To option in the Tool Options dia-
log, and then click on the appropriate alignment buttons.
Find Good Fonts
A good font will take your message a long way. But there are 
good fonts and there are not-so-good fonts. While free fonts will 
often suffice for home, church, club, and school projects, they 
aren’t likely to offer the same quality or features as fonts created by 
reputable type foundries. High-quality fonts include proper kern-
ing, ligatures, complete character sets, multiple font weights, and 
even small caps and old-style numerals, all of which can add even 
more impact to your type designs. If you’re trying to make it into 
print, you’re going to need to pay for some high-quality fonts. 
Some commercial type foundries include the following:
Linotype  http://www.linotype.com/
International Typeface Corporation  http://www.itcfonts.com/
Bitstream  http://www.bitstream.com/fonts/index.html
Use Only the Fonts You Need
If you’re not publishing your work professionally, free font archives 
may provide everything you need. Even in that case, you need to 
decide which fonts to install. Having 1,000 fonts gives you lots of 
choices, but GIMP uses simple lists for font selection, so you could 
be scrolling through them for days. Cut out the useless fonts, such 
as those consisting of special symbols and nonalphabetic features 
you don’t need. 
Use Large Type and High Resolution for 
Print Projects
If you use a 12-point font at 72 dpi in a project that will ultimately 
be printed at 300 dpi, you’ll need a microscope to read it. Or 
worse, the printer’s rasterizer might blow up the text, making it 
pixelated and illegible. If your project is destined for print, set 
the resolution to 300 dpi from the start. Remember that it’s easy 
to scale down gracefully, but it’s difficult to scale up without caus-
ing problems for yourself.
Remember That All GIMP Text Is Rasterized
You can create text in GIMP and then scale it to a larger size 
later, but only if the text remains in a text layer. Text layers are 
vector layers, which means they can easily scale or edit without 
loss of quality. They also contain information about what the text 
actually says. But once that layer is rasterized, scaling the layer or 
the image should be kept to a minimum.  
Rasterized layers contain only colored pixels, possibly with 
some level of transparency. So even if a rasterized layer looks like 
text, there is no information available about that text, and scaling 
it is like scaling any other photograph: the more you enlarge it, 
the worse the image gets.
In a similar vein, when you save your image to JPEG, PNG, or 
any other raster image format, all layer and text information is 
lost. As a result, it’ll be much harder (or even impossible) to edit 
your file. To retain layer and text information, you must save the 
file to XCF format, which is GIMP’s native file format.

256   Chapter 5: Type Effects
Practice Copyfitting Manually
GIMP added bounding boxes, also known as editing boxes, for 
editing text in the 2.8 release. To map a paragraph to a specific 
space, select the text tool and set the Box option in the Tool 
Options dialog to Fixed. Click in the canvas and drag the edit-
ing box to the desired size and position.
If you have a large amount of text, shape the editing box 
to the size desired and then use the Editor dialog (available 
from the Tool Options dialog for the Text Tool) to read addi-
tional text from a file into the box. Inserting text with no new-
lines before shaping the box can create a very wide bounding 
box, requiring you to zoom out a great distance to find the right 
side edge of the box. Be sure to shape the box before reading 
text from a file into the box.
Edit Text Layers Wisely
You can edit a text layer at any point after creating it as long as 
no raster effects have been applied. Applying a blur, curve, or 
level change, for example, will convert the layer to standard layer. 
Once this happens, the text can no longer be edited with the 
Text Tool. If this happens accidentally, try using ctrl-Z to back 
out changes until the layer returns to a text layer.
When you do need to edit a text layer, click it in the Layers 
dialog to make it active, choose the Text tool from the toolbox, 
and then click in the canvas over any letter in that layer. 
Plan Ahead
As with any project, a graphic design project needs an efficient 
workflow. Your project nearly always has two goals: it’s destined 
for print or for the Web, and it’s meant to advertise or inform. 
In order to reach those goals, you have to be organized. Know-
ing what your text should say and how it should look before you 
actually start working in GIMP will reduce the chance that you’ll 
have to make changes later, when they’ll cause excessive rework-
ing. Planning out your text is just the start, however. Think ahead 
about images, colors, themes, and messages. It’s all part of a 
designer’s workflow.
Create Font Maps
A font map is an image containing examples of one or more fonts. 
GIMP can do this automatically for you, though the feature is a 
little hidden gem. Click on the Font Preview in the Tool Options 
dialog to open a menu. At the bottom of the menu is a button bar. 
Use the rightmost button to open the Font Selection dialog.
Right-click any entry and choose Render Font Map to open a 
dialog to pick the fonts to render. Use the Filter field to limit the 
sets of fonts to render. For example, you can create one for every 
font that starts with the letters as by typing ^as in the Filter field.

With this second edition of The Artist’s Guide to GIMP, I want to 
encourage readers to expand beyond simple desktop artwork 
using GIMP. Most of the artistic effects possible with Photoshop 
are just as easy to do with GIMP and the reason is simple: at their 
roots, they both twiddle with pixels. Their menus and user inter-
faces differ, but the underlying processes are remarkably similar.
I often compare moving from Photoshop to GIMP to moving 
from one city to another. When you move to a new city, it takes 
time to find your way to the grocer or to the theater. But once you 
learn how to get there, the grocer and theater are probably much 
like the ones you left behind. So it is with GIMP. It takes patience 
to find the tools or filters that perform a given task, but the end 
result will be just as recognizable and familiar to you.
There’s no reason to think that, once you’ve learned your 
way around GIMP, you can’t create your own works of art. GIMP 
doesn’t have to be just a glorified icon editor or photo touchup 
tool. It is much more than that: it’s a tool to express yourself. 

258   Chapter 6: Creative Inspiration
I like working with stock images and distorting them repeatedly until I 
create my own little world.
Now, it’s true that art is a very personal thing. One man’s art 
is another man’s fish wrap. That doesn’t change the fact that you 
can still create art with GIMP that you’d happily frame and hang 
on your own walls. Your spouse, significant other, and/or room-
mates, on the other hand, might have different ideas. 
That said, I want to show you with some advanced tutorials 
on how to be creative simply for the sake of being creative. The 
tutorials build on techniques learned in previous tutorials and 
bring together the foundations for doing your own artwork: ini-
tial design, integration of external images, coloring, and high-
lights and shading. Work with these to gradually expose your 
inner Van Gogh. 
These tutorials will assume a more advanced understanding 
of GIMP’s tools, menus, dialogs and filters. But fear not . . . I 
won’t leave you completely hanging! So dive in and explore your 
creative side!

6.1  Fire Girl   259
6.1 
Fire Girl
This effect creates a ghostly figure wreathed in flame—a demon, 
an angel, a ghost, or an ifrit depending on your perspective. I 
simply call her the Fire Girl. The process for creating this effect 
can be reduced to these basic steps:
1.	 Isolate the girl from the background.
2.	 Edge-detect the girl on multiple layers.
3.	 Add and blend ornamental elements.
4.	 Blend to remove excess details.
5.	 Add flame and coloring.
6.	 Add background emblem.
Throughout the project, you’ll find that flames aren’t just 
components of the image but are also used for coloring. The easy 
way of using a flame to color a layer is to first desaturate the layer, 
and then add a flame layer above and set the flame layer mode 
to whatever “looks right.” However, if you place an image below 
a flame layer, the black region around the flame may block that 
lower layer from being visible, depending on the flame layer’s 
blend mode. To avoid this, you’ll use layer masks on flame layers 
or simply copy and paste flames, taking care to omit the black 
backgrounds from your source image. 
Note that even if you follow this tutorial exactly, you won’t 
produce the same image. The steps allow for too many variations, 
especially when creating the crown of flames. Don’t be discour-
aged if your first attempt is less than ideal. I went through seven 
different designs before settling on this process. And the first 
four or five of those are, to be kind to myself, not something I’d 
ever show in public. I won’t even show them to my wife. 
The tutorial’s process starts with a large canvas (2350 × 2033) 
to produce a print-ready design. To reduce memory and CPU 
requirements, you can scale the stock images down by 50 per-
cent before starting.
Several stock images are used in this project, but the end result bears little 
resemblance to those originals.
Isolating the Girl from the Background 
The first step in this project is to isolate the girl from her back-
ground. This is done primarily because the background in the 
source image for the girl is not required for the project, and its 
color may cause problems when mixed with other layers. Isolat-
ing the girl will also allow background elements to be added 
behind her. 
1.	 Desaturate the source image (Colors4Desaturate) and select 
the Luminosity option. The source image has a yellowish tint 
when converted from its original color space (provided in the 

260   Chapter 6: Creative Inspiration
image when downloaded from the stock image website) to 
the color-managed display in GIMP. The yellow tint converts 
to a bright white when the Luminosity option is selected in 
the Desaturate dialog. If you aren’t using a color-managed 
display, it may not matter which setting you choose in the 
Desaturate dialog.
2.	 Use Select By Color. In the Tool Options dialog, set the 
Threshold to 50 and click the white background. This will 
select all of the background, a little of the hair, and some of 
the face and neck. 
3.	 Switch to Quick Mask mode and paint out the white areas 
over the girl with a black foreground color and a large brush. 
Switch off Quick Mask mode and invert the selection. 
Painting with black in the Quick Mask colors the white areas in the face and 
neck, effectively taking those areas out of the selection. The poor selection 
around the hair doesn’t matter— you’ll get rid of the hair next.
4.	 Copy and paste the selection to a new layer and name it Girl. 
Fit the new layer to the canvas using Layer4Layer to Image 
Size so that any modifications made to the girl won’t be 
restricted by the size of the layer.
5.	 In the original layer (which is titled Background by default), 
use ctrl-A to select the entire layer and then drag the black 
foreground color into the canvas to fill that layer with black.
6.	 Now it’s time to get rid of the hair with a layer mask. Add a 
white layer mask to the Girl layer. Starting with a large brush 
and switching to smaller brushes, paint with black in the 
layer mask until most of the hair is removed. Leave a small 
amount of hair to provide an additional visual feature when 
using the edge-detect filters. Turn off the Girl layer visibility 
so it doesn’t interfere with the next steps. Apply the layer mask 
(Layer4Mask4Apply Layer Mask).
Hair on the face will be cleaned up later. Leave just a bit of hair around the 
top of the head.

6.1  Fire Girl   261
Edge-Detecting the Girl to Create Multiple 
Layers 
The next step in this project is to create detailed outlines of the 
girl using edge detection filters. Two such filters will be used: 
Filters4Edge-Detect4Edge and Filters4Edge-Detect4Neon. 
These produce similar results, which will be combined using 
layer modes.
1.	 Duplicate the Girl layer, make the duplicate visible in the 
Layers dialog, and name the duplicate Edge Detect. Open the 
Edge-Detect filter and select the Prewitt compass algorithm. 
The choice of algorithm is based on the preview. Choose the 
algorithm that shows the most detail. Apply the filter to the 
layer and set the layer mode to Screen.
2.	 Duplicate the Girl layer and turn on the duplicate layer vis-
ibility again, this time naming the new layer Neon Detect. Move 
this layer to the top of the layer stack. 
3.	 Invert the colors (Colors4Invert) in this layer, and then apply 
the Neon edge-detect filter. Set the layer mode to Screen. 
Duplicate this layer, giving three layers of edge detection 
above the Girl layer.
Multiple copies of the edge-detect layers with layer mode set to Screen 
or Addition may be necessary to bring out the details in the project. In 
this project, only one additional layer was needed.
Zooming in on this, you may find some strands of hair that 
were missed with the mask previously applied to the Girl layer. 
These can be left, or they can be removed with the eraser. If the 
eraser is used, it will probably need to be applied to the same 
area on each of the three edge-detect layers. 
Blending in Ornamental Elements
Now it’s time to ornament the girl. The best places to find these 
types of designs are on ornate picture frames and building archi-
tecture. This project got stuck with picture frames only because I 
couldn’t find any really good photos of Victorian architecture.
There are two ornamental pieces added to the design: one 
on the forehead and one around the neck. The former comes 
from a mostly rectangular frame while the latter comes from an 
oval frame.
1.	 Start with an image of a rectangular frame and desaturate 
it. (Choose a frame that’s easy to isolate, like this one with a 
solid color background.)
2.	 Use the Fuzzy Select tool with the Threshold set to 50. Click 
once outside the frame, and then hold down the shift key 
and click inside to create a complete selection of the back-
ground. Grow this by 1 pixel (something I nearly always do 
to avoid light-colored pixels along the edge of the selected 
object) and then invert the selection. 
3.	 Copy and paste the frame into the working canvas as a new 
layer at the top of the layer stack. Name it Ornamental: Forehead. 
The layer mode should be set to Normal.
4.	 Scale, rotate, and position the Ornamental: Forehead layer 
over the girl’s face. Use a layer mask to remove the unwanted 
sides and edges of the frame. Duplicate the layer and set the 
duplicate layer mode to Dodge. Dodging the copy over a 
desaturated normal mode original enhances contrast (in this 
case, it makes our girl shinier).

262   Chapter 6: Creative Inspiration
The scale, rotate, and position process takes experimentation. Rotation and 
scaling are easier if you set the Tool Options Preview to Grid instead of Image.
The ornament around the neck is created the same way, albeit 
starting with a different frame. The rotation, size, and position will 
be different than in the Forehead version, not to mention being 
masked differently. In this example, the bottom edge of the frame 
is kept, while the rest is masked out. 
1.	 Copy and paste another frame selection as a new layer. The 
layer name for this copy is Ornamental: Neck. Rotate, size, posi-
tion, and mask as appropriate. Finally, the mask is added to 
keep just the (now) bottom portion of the frame.
2.	 Duplicate the neck layer and change the layer mode to Dodge.
Note that in this example, the actual frame images were 
smaller than the main image window but larger than the girl. 
This required shrinking the size of the frames. Had they been 
too small you could have scaled them up. This is seldom done 
because the scaled image quickly becomes pixelated. However, 
in this case the pixelation is hardly noticeable because of the 
weakly identifiable shapes (the ornate structure has no discernible 
objects—it’s just wavy lines). Additionally, using multiple ­copies 
of a frame layer and blending layer modes hides some of the pix-
elation, and, later, coloring with flames hides even more. The 
sheer size of this image also hides some of that pixelation when 
working onscreen. Large prints, however, would likely show the 
pixelation. Therefore, any prints for this size image when ­layers 
were scaled up would need to be no larger than the size of a 
magazine or book page.
Later you may find that colorizing with the flames leaves the ornamental 
layers rather bland. If that happens, try returning to these steps and using 
the frames without desaturating them. 
Blending to Remove Excess Details 
The ornaments may not hide as much hair or facial blemishes as 
desired. To remove these from the girl’s face, use the Eraser and 
Smudge tools along with a drawing pad. If you don’t have a draw-
ing pad, just use a smaller brush and vary the opacity manually. 

6.1  Fire Girl   263
N o t e 	
Drawing pads are flat panel input devices, some with built-in 
displays, which work with a stylus. Drawing on the pad with 
the stylus moves the cursor on the monitor much like moving a 
mouse. These pads are typically connected to the computer via 
a serial or USB port. Many artists find it easier to use drawing 
pads for design work than a standard mouse. Popular makers 
of drawing pads include Wacom, Genius, Adesso, and Aiptek.
Smudging in the edge-detect layers is possible (white and 
black, when smudged, give shades of gray), but it would be better 
to leave some of the line details in the face. To accomplish that, 
use the Eraser with a grunge brush and set Brush Dynamics to 
increase Opacity, Hardness, and Size when pressure is applied 
using the drawing pad (or manually with different strokes).
1.	 Apply the eraser to each edge-detect layer, starting with the 
topmost of these three layers. Do only a small amount on each 
layer before moving to the next, rotating back to the top and 
repeating. The goal is to try to keep as much of the detail as 
possible while losing obvious blemishes in the girl’s face. 
Notice that the hair over the ear is not touched. That only enhances 
the random nature of the flames added later.
2.	 Turn off the visibility of the three edge-detect layers and 
turn on the visibility of the Girl layer. Enable the Lock Alpha 
Channel option for the Girl layer. 
3.	 Choose the Smudge tool, using any appropriate brush to 
blend the hair out of this layer. Try to keep the lighting 
smooth across the cheek by clicking in lighter areas first 
(the cheek) and dragging into darker areas (the hair). 
Smudge the neck and clothing as well.
4.	 With the layer Lock enabled, you don’t have to be careful not 
to smudge outside the girl.
5.	 When completed, turn on the visibility of the edge-detect 
layers.
The edge-detect layers (lower right) give the Girl layer a more glassy appear-
ance after the original girl layer is smudged. For added effect, consider remov-
ing the Girl layer completely to dramatically change the final image.

264   Chapter 6: Creative Inspiration
Adding Flame Coloring 
1.	
Choose the Girl layer from the Layers dialog. Open the Color-
ize dialog and set the Hue, Saturation, and Lightness to 30, 
90, and −30, respectively.
2.	 Open and copy in a roaring fire image (flame and black 
background) as a new layer at the top of the layer stack. Scale 
the layer so the flame fits completely over the girl, and then 
crop the layer to fit the image (Layer4Layer to Image Size). 
Set the layer mode to Hard Light. This brings out the red in 
the flame.
3.	 The layer may not span the width of the image. In that case, 
you can end up with a white band filling the extra space. If 
this happens, use the Fuzzy Select tool, grow by 1, and fill 
the selection with black.
4.	 At this point the flames obscure the girl’s face. You have 
several options: leave it alone (because you think this looks 
cool), use the smudge tool, or add a layer mask on the flame 
layer to let the face and ornaments show through.
A large, hard-edged brush (Round 101, sized to 150 pixels) was used with 
the Airbrush to lightly remove the flame over the girl’s face. 
Creating the Crown of Flames
The process for creating the crown is simple, but you’ll likely 
need a few attempts to get it right. 
1.	 Start with a flame image like the one shown here—a flame, 
not a roaring fire. Copy just the flame (not the black back-
ground) into the working canvas. Name the new layer Flame 
Hat. Scale this layer to fit from the girl’s forehead to the top 
of the image.
2.	 Duplicate this layer, flip it horizontally, and position the 
duplicate close to the original Flame Hat layer.
3.	 Use a mask on the Flame Hat copy layer to blend the flames 
together as necessary. Then merge the two layers by selecting 
the top layer of the two and choosing Layer4Merge Down. 
4.	 Move the merged layer to the middle of the image window 
and size the layer to the image again. Now you have the basic 
flame-hat frame with space around it to create the flame swirls.
The stock flame image makes a good hat on its own, but I found its downward-
pointing highlights a bit depressing. So a little warping magic will be applied next.

6.1  Fire Girl   265
5.	 Use the IWarp filter (Filters4Distorts4IWarp) to create 
the flame swirls. Swirl the left side of the hat using the Swirl 
CW mode, and swirl the right side of the hat using the Swirl 
CCW mode. Choose one or more spots on each side that 
would make good swirls. Click (never drag) in the preview 
in various places to create the swirls with nearly uniform 
appearance. Clicking and holding also works, but hold for 
a short amount of time or the swirl gets too big.
6.	 Experiment with the Deform radius and Deform amount, 
as well as where to click in the preview. If the preview gets 
messed up or you just don’t like it, hit Reset and try again. 
Remember: this step takes a lot of experimentation!
7.	
After applying the IWarp settings to the Flame Hat layer, 
position and rotate the hat over the girl’s head. Set the layer 
mode to Screen. Add another copy of the roaring fire from 
the coloring step above this layer, scaled so the whole flame 
fits inside the hat. Set the layer mode for the roaring fire 
layer to Screen. Use a layer mask to blend it into the hat. 
Further Exploration
To add a sort of Mayan feel to this project, select the Mandala 
brush from the GIMP Paint Shop collection (or any suitable oval 
icon converted to a brush). Use the Paintbrush tool and increase 
the scale of the brush until a single brush click is roughly 3/4 the 
size of the image window. Add a transparent layer above the 
Background layer, set the foreground color to white, and click 
once in the new layer.
N o t e 	
GIMP Paint Shop is an add-on package of brushes, pat-
terns, palettes, and tool presets that allows users to simulate 
specific drawing and painting tools and techniques, such as 
watercolor, blue ink pens, and charcoal. GIMP Paint Shop 
is available on the web at http://code.google.com/p/
gps-gimp-paint-studio/.
Duplicating the flame layers and masking out different parts, and then setting 
different layer modes can also affect the final version of your artwork. Don’t 
be afraid to experiment—just be sure to save your work periodically!
Above the Mandala imprint layer, add the roaring fire image 
in a new layer. Scale the fire to cover most of the imprint and set 
the layer mode to Multiply. 
To enhance the fire hat, add a fire emblem. The emblem can 
be a stock image or a handmade image copied, pasted, scaled, 
rotated, and positioned over the hat. Piece of cake compared to 
that business with the IWarp swirls, right?

6.2 
Star Field
The process for creating a fantastical sci-fi star field is actually 
very simple. You’ll just create a random star field that mirrors the 
real night sky with clusters and voids of stars; layer elements on 
top of it, like nearby spiral and sombrero-shaped galaxies, space 
dust and nebulae, larger stars in the foreground; and colorize the 
result. As a final touch for those who want even more flair, you 
can add a nearby planet or spaceship. 
The last step is the hardest, though GIMP’s Sphere Designer 
filter makes creating planets pretty easy. Other than that last step, 
you’ll probably spend most of your time getting the star clusters 
just right.
This is either a shot from Disney’s The Black Hole or an opening scene from 
The Big Bang Theory. Either way, it’s not just another ordinary star field.
N o t e 	
This tutorial is based on the process described by Greg Martin in 
a Photoshop tutorial (http://www.gallery.artofgregmartin 
.com/tuts_arts/making_a_star_field.html). I’ve trans-
lated it into GIMP-specific methods, but my basic process was 
inspired by his.
Starting Small
The core of this process is the use of noise filters, which provide 
random dots on a black background. However, these dots are too 
small for a typical project, especially one intended for print. To 
get around this, start with a small-scale version of the stars and 
scale the image up. Typically I wouldn’t recommend scaling up 
raster images like this. Working with noise to create dots of light 
is one of the few exceptions to this rule. The first layer of this 
project will produce the distant background set of stars. 
1.	 Start with a new image set at 640 × 480 pixels with a white 
background. Type D in the image window to reset the fore-
ground and background colors to their default settings of 
black and white, respectively. Drag the foreground color from 
the toolbox into the image window to fill the Background 
layer with black.
2.	 Add a new layer to the image window (Layer4New Layer) 
and name the layer Small Stars. Set the layer color to the fore-
ground color. Open the HSV Noise filter (Filters4Noise4 
HSV Noise). Set the Holdness to 3, the Hue to 20, the Satu-
ration to 90, and the Value to 100. Apply this to the layer by 
clicking OK.
3.	 HSV Noise renders the noise in color, so the layer needs to be 
desaturated. Open the Desaturate dialog (Colors4Desatu-
rate) and use the Luminosity setting. Click OK to apply to 
the layer.

6.2  Star Field   267
4.	 The rendered noise is randomly distributed but a bit too 
densely populated. Open the Brightness-Contrast dialog 
(Colors4Brightness-Contrast). Set the Brightness to 45 
and the Contrast to 65 and click OK. The result will be fewer 
stars, some of them a bit brighter.
5.	 These settings are variable, meaning that changing them 
can have an important effect on the final appearance of the 
image. Increase both to reduce the number of small stars 
even further. But be careful not to make the stars too bright. 
Remember, these are just background and distant stars. The 
brighter, more visible stars and clusters are yet to come. 
This project works on very small points of light that can be 
hard to see on a monitor and even harder to see when printed. 
To make it easier to see what’s happening, zoom into the image 
window by 300 percent. You’ll zoom back out when the image 
contrast is easier to see in print.
The zoom amount (300 percent) in the screenshot can be seen in the status 
bar of the image window. The Luminosity setting in the Desaturate dialog was 
chosen because it increased the brightness of the dots more than the other 
options.
Growing Bigger Stars 
That’s enough for the background stars. Next come some larger, 
less distant stars. 
1.	 Duplicate the Small Stars layer (Layer4Duplicate) and 
name the new layer Large Stars. Thin out the stars a bit more 
in the Brightness-Contrast dialog with the Brightness set to 50 
and the Contrast set to 110 this time.
2.	 The next steps will require these stars to be significantly 
larger. Scale the layer up to 200 percent (Layer4Scale Layer). 
Choose the percent option. Using a percent will make it easier 
to know the amount to later scale this layer back down. Use 
the default setting for the Quality Interpolation option.
3.	 Scaling up the layer without scaling up the image made the 
layer larger than the image size. That doesn’t matter for now; 
the next steps will still work on the entire layer, and later resiz-
ing will fit the layer back into the image size. 
The oversized layer, shown here with the layer boundary extended beyond 
the visible black layers, won’t cause problems. Changes will still be applied 
to the entire layer even if parts of it aren’t visible. 

268   Chapter 6: Creative Inspiration
Scaling the layer by 200 percent helped make the large stars 
more visible, but they’re still hard to see. It’s time to fix that.
1.	 Invert the colors (Colors4Invert) of the Large Stars layer. 
The large stars will be fairly dim at this point. This next step 
will improve that situation. 
2.	 Open the Levels dialog (Colors4Levels). Set the black point 
to 230, the midpoint (also known as Gamma) to 1.00, and the 
white point to 250. The Levels adjustment will sharpen the 
large stars, making them darker and more distinct. Inverting 
the colors makes it easier to choose the right settings for the 
Levels adjustment. If the stars aren’t improved with these set-
tings, try higher values for both the black and white points.
When working on this step on the computer, you’ll see that the inverted 
version is very clear and makes choosing Levels settings easier. 
3.	 Invert the colors again. Now the layer can be sized back 
down, but not all the way. To size it back to its original size, 
you’d scale the layer by 50 percent (or half its current size). 
This is another variable point in your project. Instead, scale 
the layer to 60 percent of its current size. Then the stars will 
be a bit larger than their small star cousins. If this isn’t large 
enough, increase the percentage. But don’t make these stars 
too large. The later clustering process will bring out brighter, 
larger groups of stars. After scaling, fit the layer to the image, 
essentially trimming the excess layer, using the Layer4Layer 
to Image Size menu option.
The large stars are only slightly larger than the small stars, and the clustering 
process that comes later will improve the look of both.
Working at a Larger Scale 
Now it’s time to scale up the entire project. Scaling up will pro-
duce a much nicer star field for print or the Web. It also makes 
the rest of these steps easier to see. Remember, starting with the 
smaller image size was necessary because of the size of the noise 
generated by the HSV Noise filter.
1.	 Scale the image (Image4Scale Image) by 250 percent. 
The link icon to the right of the width and height should 
be unbroken. That will keep the aspect ratio, so the stars 
remain essentially round.

6.2  Star Field   269
2.	 Set the Large Stars layer mode to Screen. Now the entire set 
of distant small stars and closer large stars should be visible. 
The new image size should be 1600 × 1200 pixels.
3.	 At this point you’ll get a better feel for how well your Levels 
adjustment worked in the previous step. If the large stars are 
too bright, apply another Levels adjustment or change the 
Brightness-Contrast to darken them a bit.
After scaling and blending the large stars with the background small stars, 
it became obvious that the large stars were too bright, so the Brightness-
Contrast dialog was used to dim them.
Adding Space Voids 
This is a nice field of stars, but there are plenty of improvements 
that can be made. The first is to create some voids in space, places 
with a lack of stars. This step seems awkward at first. There is no 
recipe for what parts of the fields to wipe out. 
The goal here is to create some blank regions of space. Those 
may get filled with stars again when the clustering process is 
performed. For now, clean out big swatches. Don’t be shy on the 
Large Stars layer either. Trust me: there don’t need to be many 
big stars left when you get to the clustering step.
1.	 Add white layer masks (Layer4Mask4Add Layer Mask) 
to both the Large Stars and Small Stars layers. Choose the 
Paintbrush tool from the toolbox and select a fairly large 
brush. In the Tool Options dialog, set the initial Opacity for 
the Paintbrush to 50 percent. Type D in the image window to 
make sure the foreground color is reset to black. Now paint 
through each layer, wiping out large swatches of stars.
2.	 No matter which brush you choose, increase the size of it for 
use on the Large Stars layer. Try different brushes and adjust 
their opacity as you go.
3.	 Avoid any obvious patterns in the voids and remove any pat-
terns created when the Brightness-Contrast and Levels adjust-
ments were applied to the original HSV Noise. Use short brush-
strokes, alternating vertical and horizontal stroke directions.
4.	 When the voids are plentiful and obvious, save the project first 
in XCF format so that if the remaining steps don’t produce 
the star field of your dreams, you can try again without hav-
ing to start over. Finally, flatten the image (Image4Flatten) 
into a single layer. 
These zoomed-in views show that many of the large stars are reduced in 
brightness or even removed completely. The background stars are also now 
peppered in clumps, which will come in handy with the next step: clustering.

270   Chapter 6: Creative Inspiration
Clustering 
The real artistic aspect of this project is in the clustering of stars. 
To create galaxies and other clusters, use the Clone tool from the 
toolbox. Again, a variety of brushes may be required here, depend-
ing on your personal taste. Hard-edged brushes seem to produce 
the best effects, but don’t be afraid to try almost any brush.
1.	 To use the Clone tool, hold down the ctrl key and click any-
where in the canvas. This is the source location. Release ctrl 
and begin painting anywhere in the canvas. Cloning using the 
Normal mode in the Tool Options dialog simply replaces 
the current pixels under the cursor with the pixels from the 
source location. The source location moves relative to the 
brush, always staying exactly the same distance and direction 
from the current location.
2.	 To get really nice clusters, alternate among Normal, Screen, 
and Overlay modes in the Tool Options dialog for the Clone 
tool. Use areas with stars as the source location when creat-
ing clusters. Use the void areas as the source location when 
trying to separate clusters from other areas.
3.	 Try to create some swirling clusters or a spiral galaxy as 
seen from directly above or edge on. Try a few clone opera-
tions to see what you get, and then use ctrl-Z to back those 
changes out and try again. Once you begin to see how the 
clusters form, you won’t need to back out the changes. Save 
your work frequently, and in different files, as you experiment. 
This allows you to return to previous variations if your experi-
ments get out of control. 
4.	 The next step will add a soft glow to the star clusters. Dupli-
cate the Background layer (at this point there should only be 
one layer after previously flattening the image) and name the 
new layer Star Glow. Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4 
Blur4Gaussian Blur). Set both the horizontal and vertical 
blur radius to somewhere between 5 and 40. The actual 
amount depends on the density of your clusters. Choose a 
cluster with the most visibly distinct white dots in the preview 
window of the Gaussian Blur dialog. Adjust the blur radius 
based on that preview. The result of the blur should be a 
somewhat cloud-like appearance for the Star Glow layer.
This is a normal-sized view (with Levels slightly adjusted to make sure it 
shows up in print) after much work with the Clone tool. See how a dim 
set of background stars mixed with just a few larger, closer stars turns 
into a cluster of galaxies! 
5.	 Set the Star Glow layer mode to Dodge (for subtle enhance-
ment) or to Screen (for vivid enhancement). The glow is 
enhanced with some coloring. Open the Colorize dialog 
(Colors4Colorize) and set the Hue, Saturation, and Light-
ness to 215, 90, and 0, respectively.

6.2  Star Field   271
The Star Glow layer is used to bring out detail in the clusters while leaving 
the background stars essentially untouched. 
Coloring 
Next comes a little more color. This process won’t add blasts of 
color, just a hint of it to selected points.
1.	 Duplicate the Background layer and name it Red Stars. Move 
this layer to the top of the layer stack. Reduce the number 
of visible stars using the Levels dialog. Set the black point to 
90, the midpoint to 1.00, and the white point to 160. As with 
other applications of the Levels dialog, these values can be 
adjusted as necessary.
2.	 Open the Colorize dialog again and set the Hue, Satura-
tion, and Lightness sliders to 0, 80, and −10, respectively. Set 
the layer mode for the Red Stars layer to Dodge. Don’t use 
Screen this time as it would wash out the light coloring this 
process adds to the image.
3.	 Repeat the process as many times as you like, using variations 
on the Levels and Colorize settings. You can also use a layer 
mask to color different sets of stars in the duplicate layers.
The first red layer just changed some blue light to purple. An intense red 
layer, created the same way as the first but with different Colorize settings, 
was added and mixed with a layer mask to bring out strong shades of red.
Using Lens and Gradient Flares for Highlights 
The bright points of light in the star field need to be softened 
and broadened. This is easily accomplished using the Lens Flare 
and Gradient Flare filters.
1.	 Create a new layer that’s 250 × 250 pixels. Set the Fill Type to 
Foreground Color (assuming here that the foreground color 
is still black; if not, type D in the canvas to reset it). Name 
the new layer Lens Flare. Move this new layer to the top of the 
layer stack.
2.	 Open the Lens Flare filter (Filters4Light and Shadow4 
Lens Flare). No changes are required to the filter options, 
so click OK to render the flare in the Lens Flare layer. The 
flare is colored, which you probably don’t want (but hey, exper-
iment with colored flares too!) so desaturate it (Colors4 
Desaturate). Set the layer mode to Dodge and then use the 
Move tool to drag the layer over some star clusters.
3.	 Duplicate this layer a few times, scaling each duplicate up or 
down just slightly, and place the duplicates over various star 

272   Chapter 6: Creative Inspiration
clusters. Place flare centers over space voids to use the outer 
edges of the flare to highlight an area. Place a flare center 
directly over a star to make it shine even brighter. What’s fun 
here is to drag these small layers around and see how they 
pull out details you hadn’t previously seen.
4.	 Create another black layer that’s 250 × 250 pixels. Set the 
layer mode to Dodge and name the new layer Gradient Flare. 
Open the Gradient Flare filter (Filters4Light and Shadow4 
Gradient Flare). In the Selector tab, choose the Hidden_
Planet, Bright_Star, or Distant_Sun preset. Render this into 
the new layer. Desaturate and position, and then duplicate 
and position as many times as desired. 
Experimentation is vital at this stage of the project. Try different Gradient 
Flare presets, desaturated and colorized. You may, and probably will, end  
up with a large number of flare layers. 
Adding Space Dust 
At this point the star field is essentially complete. The next step, 
adding space dust, just adds a bit more pizzazz to the project.
1.	 Add a transparent layer, name it Space Dust, and move it 
to the top of the layer stack. Set the layer mode to Screen 
and the Opacity to 20 percent.
2.	 Pick a new foreground color, like a soft blue with RGB values 
set to 57/99/176. Choose the Paintbrush tool from the tool-
box. In the Tool Options dialog, set the Opacity to 20 percent 
and make sure the Incremental checkbox is checked. Choose 
a variety of soft-edged brushes and change often as you paint. 
3.	 Paint in the Space Dust layer in long strokes, brush ­horizontally, 
vertically, and diagonally. Fill the layer with more dust than you 
need, and then use the Eraser tool to clean out the excess. 
The space dust serves essentially the same purpose as the Star Glow layer: to 
soften the bright clusters. It also adds color to the space voids. 
Further Exploration
The star field is complete, but for added fun it should have a fore-
ground object: a planet. The Sphere Designer filter makes ­creating 
planets very simple. Create a transparent, 600 × 600-pixel layer 
named Planet. Open the filter (Filters4Render4Sphere Designer). 
Notice that there are three default layers. Each layer can be edited 
to change its properties and transformations. New and duplicate 
layers are added to the bottom of the list. Keep Light layers at the 
bottom. The layer order cannot be changed, so duplicate Light 
layers to move them to the bottom of the list, and then edit the 
original Light layers to change them to textures or bump maps.

Creamsicle Love 
This tutorial is based on a personal view of the symbols of love: 
the sun, beams of light, a creamsicle-colored sky, and grassy fields. 
This will be one of the easiest of the advanced tutorials. There 
are no special talents needed here. But you’ll need to find some 
extra brushes to add to GIMP’s stock collection. I’ll show you 
where to get these and how to use them. A stock photo is also 
required. I’ll point you to the one I’m using here. In the process, 
you’ll cover a few remedial tasks that haven’t been covered in a 
while: custom gradients and foreground selections. 
Every day is a sunny day in GIMP-land!
Creating a Custom Gradient 
The project starts with a splash of color on the background applied 
as a gradient. The easy way to do this is to set the foreground and 
background colors and use the Blend tool from the toolbox, 
dragging from top to bottom in the canvas. Instead, let’s review 
how to create a custom gradient.
1.	
Type D in the canvas to reset the foreground and background 
colors to their defaults of black and white, respectively. Open 
a new image (File4New) that’s 1600 × 1200 pixels. The large 
size renders the image suitable for printing a postcard-size 
print at 250 dpi. If it’s bound for the Web, however, scale the 
image down when completed. 
2.	 At the bottom of the Gradients dialog (Windows4Dockable 
Dialogs4Gradients) are icons for managing gradients. Click 
on the icon second from the left to create a new gradient. This 
opens the Gradient Editor dialog. The initial gradient shown 
uses the foreground color on the left and background color 
on the right. Click and hold the right mouse button on the 
gradient to open a menu. Choose the left endpoint’s color. In 
the dialog that opens, set the RGB values to 219/122/2. Click 
OK to set the left endpoint color.
3.	 Creating a custom gradient is all about using that menu to 
add new segments, setting the colors on either end of the seg-
ments, and adjusting the size of the segments. While a more 
elaborate gradient could be created, this is all that’s needed 
for this project.
4.	 In the Gradient Editor, change the name from Untitled to 
RetroLove. Then click the Save icon in the dialog. Close the 
Gradient Editor dialog.

274   Chapter 6: Creative Inspiration
5.	 Choose the Blend tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog, click the Gradient button and select the RetroLove 
gradient. In the canvas, drag from the top of the window to 
the bottom.
Gradients are easy to create and can be used to provide a background color 
theme, create textured patterns, or simulate 3-D effects. 
Creating Temporary Grassy Hills 
The next step is just as easy as the gradient. Two small hills will 
be created, and colored different shades of green. The coloring 
is temporary, however, and provides only a minor visual reminder 
that they are on separate layers. Later the hills will get a silhou-
ette treatment when grass is applied to them.
1.	 The two hills are created using Ellipse selections in separate 
layers. Zoom out on the image (View4Zoom4Zoom Out). 
Create a transparent layer and name it Foreground Hill. Use 
the Ellipse Select tool from the toolbox to drag a wide oval 
across the bottom of the canvas. Click the foreground color 
box in the toolbox and change the RGB values to 60/138/60. 
Drag the foreground color box into the selection. Clear the 
selection (Select4None).
2.	 The second hill is created the same way, with the new layer 
named Background Hill. Just move the selection slightly to 
the right and after applying the color, use the Brightness-
Contrast dialog (Colors4Brightness-Contrast) to darken 
the hill slightly. This allows the second hill to be more visible 
as the project progresses. 
3.	 Move this layer below the Foreground Hill layer in the Layers 
dialog. Clear the selection. Zoom back in (View4Zoom4 
Zoom In) so the layers fit the image window. 
The reason for having two hills is so the grassy field won’t be flat or have a 
uniform curve. These will add variation to the final image. 
Adding a Background Sun 
Next comes the sun. This will be made from two layers, one with 
a solid-colored sun and another with a soft blur that makes the 
sun look a bit hazy.

6.3  Creamsicle Love    275
1.	
Add a transparent layer and name it Sun. Move this layer below 
the Background Hill layer in the Layers dialog. Choose the 
Ellipse Select tool from the toolbox once again. In the Tool 
Options dialog, click the Fixed checkbox and make sure it’s 
set to Aspect Ratio. Drag an oval selection in the canvas and 
position it to span both hills.
2.	 You can change the size and position of the selection by 
moving the mouse around the squares that bound the circle. 
The middle square is used to move the selection around the 
canvas. The top, left, right, and ­bottom squares change the 
width or height of the selection. The corners change width 
and height at the same time. The selection will remain edit-
able until enter is hit or another tool is chosen. 
A simple setting sun
3.	 Click the foreground color box in the toolbox to edit the 
color. Set the RGB values to 248/236/166. Click OK to close 
the dialog. Drag the foreground color box into the canvas. 
Clear the selection.
4.	 If the sun is too large, scale the layers down. If the sun is too 
high in the sky, move the layers down with the Move tool. 
If you move the layers, use Layer4Layer to Image Size to fit 
them around the Background layer.
5.	 Duplicate the Sun layer (Layer4Duplicate Layer) and name 
the duplicate layer Sun Haze. Open the Gaussian Blur filter 
(Filters4Blur4Gaussian Blur). Adjust the preview so the 
edge of the sun is in view. Set the Blur Radius to 150 for both 
the Horizontal and Vertical directions. The Blur Method 
should be set to RLE. Click OK to apply the blur to the Sun 
Haze layer. Set the layer mode for that layer to Addition. This 
results in a bright white sun with only a hint of yellow around 
the edge. 
For a yellower sun, use a darker color on the original Sun layer and then 
reduce the opacity of the Sun Haze layer. 
Giving It the Retro Feel: Sunbeams 
This next step will add the beams of light emanating from the  sun. 
The process involves creating an initial beam and then duplicat-
ing, rotating, scaling, and positioning the duplicates. It’s easier to 
create these beams if you start by zooming out again. Start with a 
horizontal beam stretching from the sun to the left edge.
1.	 Add a transparent layer named Sun Beam and move it to the 
top of the stack in the Layers dialog. 

276   Chapter 6: Creative Inspiration
2.	 Click on the left ruler in the canvas and drag a guide to the 
approximate center of the sun. Click on the top ruler in the 
canvas and drag to the same spot. Choose the Paths tool 
from the toolbox. 
3.	 In the canvas, click just above and just below the intersec-
tion of the guides. Then click outside the left edge of the 
layer boundary and just above and just below the previous 
two points. Click Selection from Path in the Tool Options 
dialog. Fill the selection with white. 
Try to avoid making the initial beam too wide, though blurs and opacity 
will help the situation if you do. 
4.	 Now the rest of the beams can be added. This is similar to 
how the cogs of the gear were made back in Section 4.8, 
using copy, paste, and rotation operations. The selection 
should still be active. Copy (ctrl-C) and paste (ctrl-V) the 
selection as a new layer (Layer4New Layer). Use the Flip 
tool from the toolbox and flip horizontally, and then use the 
Move tool to position the layer so its left edge aligns with the 
intersection of the guides.
5.	 Duplicate this layer and rotate it 90 degrees counterclockwise 
(Layer4Transform4Rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise). 
Position this layer so its bottom edge aligns with the intersec-
tion of the guides.
6.	 Duplicate this layer and rotate it 45 degrees (Layer4Trans-
form4Arbitrary Rotation). After rotating, this layer’s lower 
left corner can be aligned with the intersection of the guides. 
Duplicate the layer and flip it horizontally, and then position 
the new layer appropriately.
7.	
Additional beams can be created by duplicating the vertical 
or horizontal beams and rotating them an arbitrary amount. 
In some cases, the beam will not extend to the edge of the 
image. Use the Scale tool to scale the layer so it does.
These layers provide an outline in which a radial gradient will be applied. 
8.	 Merge the beam layers. The easiest way to do this is to turn 
off the visibility of all layers except the beam layers in the 
Layers dialog, and then merge the remaining visible layers 
(Image4Merge Visible Layers). Create a selection from this 
(Layer4Transparency4Alpha To Selection). Add a trans-
parent layer and name it Sun Beam Gradient. Type D and then 
X in the canvas to set the foreground color to white.

6.3  Creamsicle Love    277
9.	 Choose the Blend tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options 
dialog, set the Gradient to FG to Transparent and the Shape 
to Radial. Click in the canvas on the intersection of the guides 
and drag past the upper left corner. Turn off the visibility of 
the Sun Beam layer in the Layers dialog and turn on the vis-
ibility of the rest of the layers. Move the Sun Beam Gradient 
layer below the Sun layer in the Layers dialog.
10.	 Clear the selection. Open the Gaussian Blur dialog and set 
the Blur Radius to 20. Click OK to apply to the Sun Beam 
Gradient layer.
If the beams are too dim, duplicate the layer and adjust the Mode and 
Opacity to taste. 
Adding the Lovers’ Silhouette 
The next element for this project is a stock photo used to create 
a silhouette of a couple in love. When searching for photos for 
projects like this one, look for photos that have a solid-colored 
background. This makes it easier to create a selection of just the 
couple. Also, this project will benefit if the couple is touching, yet 
separated enough to tell the individuals apart. If they’re too close 
together, the resulting silhouette will not be easily identifiable. 
This particular photo is well suited for use with the Foreground 
Select tool.
1.	 With the Foreground Select tool active, draw a freehand 
selection around the couple. This produces a rough selection 
similar to a Quick Mask. Next, select a brush from the Brushes 
dialog (Windows4Dockable Dialogs4Brushes). The brush 
should display when you mouse over the canvas. In this photo, 
the brush size should be no wider than the thinnest arm of the 
woman. Adjust the brush size using the slider that runs from 
Small Brush to Large Brush in the Tool Options dialog.
2.	 Paint over the man and woman, making sure you cover places 
where shirts and pants meet and where clothes give way to 
skin. Essentially, cover any places with high-contrast changes 
you want to include in the selection. You don’t have to be 
exact with this, and you certainly don’t need to cover the 
couple completely. 
3.	 To complete the selection, press enter. This converts Quick-
Mask styled coloring into a selection. Further improvements 
can be made using the Quick Mask feature if necessary. 
Copy and paste the selection into the original canvas as a 
new layer and name it Couple. Scale and/or flip the layer hori-
zontally as necessary.
4.	 Create a selection of the couple (Layer4Transparency4 
Alpha To Selection). Increase the layer boundary (Layer4 
Layer Boundary Size) by 10 pixels for both width and height. 
Click the Center option to center the image within the new 
layer boundary. Click Resize to apply the change to the layer 
boundary. Then grow the selection (Select4Grow) by 1 pixel. 
Growing the selection will smooth any rough edges in the 
selection before creating the silhouette.
5.	 Type D in the image to reset the colors in the toolbox and 
then drag the foreground color into the layer. Clear the selec-
tion (Select4None).

278   Chapter 6: Creative Inspiration
The rough selection (left) was improved (right) by using a small, hard-edged 
brush and a single pass over the couple. The selection isn’t perfect (note the 
man’s feet and pants), but it doesn’t have to be to create the silhouette. 
Scaling and flipping may be necessary to most appropriately position the 
silhouette on the hills, in front of the sun. 
Finishing Off the Grassy Hills 
The project is nearly complete, and the last step is to convert 
the hills to grassy silhouettes. This conversion will have the side 
effect of hiding the bottom of the man’s feet, which seems natural 
after it’s done. Also, at this point the guides are no longer neces-
sary. You can hide them (View4Show Guides) or remove them 
(Image4Guides4Remove All Guides).
1.	 First, change the hills from green to black. One at a time, 
select each layer in the Layers dialog and set the Lock Alpha 
Channel. Grab the foreground color from the toolbox and 
drag it into the layer, just as was done with the Couple layer.
2.	 Adding grass to the hills requires suitable brushes. GIMP 
doesn’t come with plant-like brushes suitable for this project, 
but there are many collections of plant brushes available for 
download on the Internet. To add new brushes to GIMP, just 
unpack the collection in any folder. Open the Preferences 
dialog (Edit4Preferences) and select the Brushes entry at 
the bottom of the list on the left. A set of options appears. 
Choose the Brushes option. The right side of the Prefer-
ences dialog will display the set of folders currently scanned 
for brushes. To add a new folder, click the New Folder icon 
to enable the text input field. Type in the name of the folder 
and hit enter or select it using the folder selection button to 
the right of the text field. The red circle icon will change to 
green if the folder exists.
3.	 Once the folder is added to the list of folders, click on the 
box to the left of the folder name to allow saving brushes 
to it. To use the new brushes, you must either refresh the 
Brushes dialog or restart GIMP.
N o t e 	
Many freely available brush collections are created specifi-
cally for Photoshop and are single files with the .abr filename 
extension. These files contain multiple brushes. GIMP can 
read these files well, so don’t be afraid to experiment with 
­Photoshop brushes.

6.3  Creamsicle Love    279
Adding brushes in the middle of a project is fairly common practice. It’s just 
another good reason to save your project files often. 
4.	 Add a transparent layer and name it Grass. Move it to just 
above the Foreground Hill layer in the Layers dialog. Open 
the Brushes dialog and choose an appropriate brush. At the 
bottom of the dialog, set the spacing to anywhere from 50 
to 150 (smaller, if the image size is smaller than the original 
1600 × 1200 used for this project). Choose the Paintbrush 
tool from the toolbox. In the Tool Options dialog, set the 
Scale option so the brush outline (mouse over the canvas 
to see this) is an appropriate size. Paint along the edges of 
the hills multiple times. Switch to another grass brush and 
repeat. Repeat this process until the hills are sufficiently grassy.
This grassy field was created using multiple brushes from a grass brush 
collection. Notice also how the green hills are now grassy fields. 
Further Exploration
The last step is optional but adds pizzazz to the project: flying 
birds. Again, the trick is to find freely available bird brushes on 
the Internet. Add a transparent layer, choose a bird brush, scale 
it appropriately (smaller for more distant birds), and paint a few 
blobs around the sky. If the birds are not silhouettes, create a 
selection of the birds and fill it with black.

Mobsterville
Comic book Hollywood hits like The Dark Knight and Watchmen 
are all the rage. These updates to the vision of classic superheroes 
come with a dark tone. Sin City paved the way for this new style of 
dark comic-book tale, bringing the grittiest original comic from 
the 1990s to the silver screen in 2005. Fortunately for GIMP fans, 
re-creating the Sin City effect is fairly easy.
This next tutorial will use stock photos to show a rugged hero 
patrolling the city under a rain-soaked, miserable night. The photo 
is a stylized black-and-white with a single splash of color. 
Black-and-white images can send a powerful message, especially with just a 
small touch of color.
Establishing the Base Image 
The base image shows our main character, a tough guy with a gun, 
on a solid, light-colored background. This image has a 1600 × 1067 
pixel resolution. 
1.	 Desaturate the original image (Colors4Desaturate), which 
is named Man in this project. Choose the Lightness option 
for this image, which will allow the contrast between his face 
and the backdrop to remain high.
2.	 Open the Levels dialog (Colors4Levels). Set the white 
point by clicking the white point eye dropper (right side 
beneath the levels histogram), then clicking the upper right 
background of the image. This makes the background com-
pletely white, with the white point slider moving to just left 
of center of the histogram. Move the black point slider to the 
right until it’s very near the white point. The result will be an 
almost completely black-and-white image.
The style for this project requires a high-contrast adjustment of the original 
stock image.

Making It Rain
1.	 Add a transparent layer (Layer4New Layer). Name this layer 
Rain 1. Open the Hurl filter (Filters4Noise4Hurl). The 
default settings are sufficient here: Random seed = 10, Ran-
domization % = 50, Repeat = 1. Click OK to render the noise 
in the layer. The noise will be colored, so desaturate it. While 
the Lightness option was chosen here, any of the desatura-
tion options will work.
2.	 Open the Motion Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Motion Blur). 
Set the Blur Type to Linear, the Length to 120 pixels, and 
the Angle to 90 degrees. Click OK to apply the blur to the 
noise in the layer. Note that this blur will be hard to see in the 
Motion Blur dialog’s preview, but that won’t affect this step.
3.	 Scale the layer (Layer4Scale Layer) by 140 percent. This 
is done by changing the scale units menu in the Scale Layer 
dialog to percent and the Width to 140. The Height field 
will automatically adjust to maintain the width-to-height ratio 
when the Scale button is pressed.
4.	 Zoom out to see the layer boundary for the Rain 1 layer. 
Choose the Shear transformation tool from the toolbox. 
Click the image and drag until the edges of the shear preview 
touch the right and left edges of the image window. Click the 
Shear button in the dialog to apply the transformation. 
5.	 Open the Levels dialog and adjust the black point to around 
107 and the white point to around 116. The actual settings 
will vary based on personal taste for the appearance of the 
falling rain. Reset the layer to fit the image (Layer4Layer to 
Image Size).
6.	 Add a second layer of rain, using the same process as the first 
layer of rain but with less shear applied so the rain falls more 
vertically. The Levels adjustment may also be slightly differ-
ent, again according to taste. Later, because of the contrast 
changes brought on by adding in background elements, the 
two rain layers’ Modes and Opacity may need to be adjusted. 
Name the second rain layer Rain 2 and make sure it’s above 
the Rain 1 layer.
Motion-blurred noise is a quick way to fake rain.
7.	
The base image needs to be masked in preparation for add-
ing a background. Click the base image layer in the Layers 
dialog to make it active. Add an alpha channel to it (Layer4 
Transparency4Add Alpha Channel). Add a white layer mask 
to the base image layer (Layer4Mask4Add Layer Mask).
8.	 Open the original image again. You can use the color aspect 
of this image to create a good mask. Choose the Fuzzy Select 
tool in the toolbox. Set the Threshold to anywhere between 
70 and 90 and click the center of the blue area to the right of 
the man’s head. Then hold down the shift key and click the 
blue area to the left of the man’s head. Repeat this process 
for the blue areas inside the trigger area of the gun. Copy 
(ctrl-C) and then paste (ctrl-V, followed by Layer4Anchor 
Layer) this selection into the mask of the base image layer. 
Use the Levels dialog to set the black point to 254. The check-
ered pattern that represents transparent regions in the image 
will show up where the blue areas were in the original image.

282   Chapter 6: Creative Inspiration
Masking the background will allow a more appropriate background to 
show through.
Adding a Background Building and 
Lamp Posts
1.	 Open the background building image. Scale it to fit the size 
of the base image layer (Image4Image Properties). 
2.	 Click the Rain 2 layer in the Layers dialog. This is necessary 
because you can’t paste a new layer if a mask is currently 
active from a previous step.
3.	 Copy and paste it into the base image and drag the new 
layer to the bottom of the layer stack. Name the building layer 
Building. Turn off the visibility of all other layers (click on 
the layer visibility icon to the left of the thumbnail) to make 
these next steps easier. 
4.	 Desaturate the layer. Open the Levels dialog. Click the white 
point eye dropper and then click the darkest part of the sky. 
Drag the black point slider toward the white point slider until 
the building walls are almost completely black. If any clouds 
remain in the background, drag the white slider to the left 
a bit more. Click OK, and then turn on the visibility of all 
other layers.
We’ve used this image before—with some cropping and some new light-
ing, the building from Section 2.7 is now a dreary tenement. Saving stock 
images in a library is a good way to save on your design projects.
5.	 Before adding lamp posts, the building’s front entrance needs 
to be moved to the left. Open the Scale dialog (Layer4Scale 
Layer). Click the chain link between the Width and Height 
fields to break it in order to change the aspect ratio of the 
layer. Scale the Building layer by 165 percent wide and 140 per-
cent high. Apply this setting.
6.	 Use the Move tool to drag the layer to the left until the 
chimney and inverted-V-shaped rooftop are to the left of the 
gun. Be sure not to drag it so far that the right edge of the 
building is left of the right edge of the image window. Reset 
the layer size to match the image size (Layer4Layer to 
Image Size).
7.	
Add a transparent layer and name it Guideline. Move the layer 
to just above the Building layer. Set the foreground color 
to a medium gray (HTML Notation set to cbcbcb). Use the 

6.4  Mobsterville   283
Pencil tool to draw a thin line from left to right at roughly 
the height of the top of the first floor of the building. This 
guideline will be used to draw the lamp posts. Later, this 
layer will be removed.
The guideline is temporary and used only to assist in creating the lamp 
posts. It won’t be visible in the final image.
8.	 Add a transparent layer just above the Guideline layer, nam-
ing the new layer Lamp Posts. Choose the Paintbrush tool 
from the toolbox. Choose a suitably small brush, just large 
enough to be visible as distant lamp posts. Draw a straight 
line to the left of the building’s front entrance, from the 
guideline down to the approximate bottom of the building. 
Repeat the process for the right side of the entrance. Dupli-
cate this layer and offset it (Layer4Transform4Offset) by 
3 or more pixels in the X direction. The amount depends 
on the size of the brush used to draw the posts. Use the 
Brightness-Contrast dialog (Colors4Brightness-Contrast) 
and reduce the Brightness to −127.
9.	 The rain layers reduce the contrast in the image. In the Lay-
ers dialog, reduce the Opacity for each rain layer to around 
30 to 50 percent. Click the Rain 2 layer. Merge it with the 
Rain 1 layer (Layer4Merge Down). Adjust the contrast of the 
merged layer using the Brightness-Contrast dialog (Colors4 
Brightness-Contrast). The settings depend on the content of 
the rain layers, but the Brightness should be less than −100 
and the Contrast raised to near 127. 
Using a temporary layer for alignment purposes is a new trick, but one you’ll 
use frequently for alignment that isn’t strictly vertical or horizontal.
Adding Lamps and Lights
1.	 Add a transparent layer just above the Lamp Posts copy layer, 
naming the new layer Lamps. Create an oval selection in the 
canvas near the lamp posts. Use the Rectangle Select tool to 
cut out the bottom half of the selection. If necessary, use the 
Scale tool to appropriately resize the lamp above the lamp 
post. Use the Move tool to position the selection over the left 
lamp post. Use the Rotate tool to align the straight edge of 
the selection with the guideline. Choose the Blend tool and 
drag a Linear gradient from black to gray starting at the top 
of the curve of the selection down to the straight edge. 

284   Chapter 6: Creative Inspiration
2.	 Use the Move tool to drag the selection over the other lamp 
post. Repeat the application of the gradient using the Blend 
tool. Clear the selection (Select4None).
The top of the lamp posts is a simple half-circle, shown here with the 
Rain 1 layer visibility turned off to make it easier to see the gradients. 
The gray, horizontal guideline layer is visible between the lamps.
3.	 Create a transparent layer and name it Lights. Move it just 
below the Lamps layer in the Layers dialog. Use the Paths 
tool to outline a box below the left lamp. The box should be 
thin at the top and wide at the bottom with a rounded base. 
In the Tool Options dialog, convert the path to a selection. 
Choose the Blend tool from the toolbox and configure it to 
use a linear gradient that flows from white to transparent. 
Click near the top of the selection in the image window and 
drag toward the bottom. Follow the line of the lamp post to 
align the gradient properly. 
4.	 Use the Move tool to move the selection under the second 
lamp. Use the Scale tool to adjust the size of the selection if 
desired and then apply another linear white gradient. Clear 
the selection.
5.	 Open the Gaussian Blur filter (Filters4Blur4Gaussian 
Blur) and apply a 10 pixel blur in both the X and Y directions 
to the layer. Set the layer Opacity to between 35 and 60 per-
cent. At this point you can delete the guideline layer, or sim-
ply turn off its visibility in the Layers dialog. 
The lamps aren’t strictly necessary, but they’re a cool neo-noir touch.
Retrieving a Red Tie 
1.	
Open an image of a gangster with a red tie. Choose the Fuzzy 
Select tool from the toolbox and set the Threshold to 95. Click 
anywhere on the red tie. The high color contrast should allow 
most of the tie to be selected completely with a single click. 
If there are spots of unselected tie inside the selection, grow 
the selection by a pixel to pick them up. It doesn’t matter if a 
little area outside the tie is selected. Copy the selection.
2.	 Paste the selection into the base image and make it a new 
layer. Name the layer Red Tie. Flip the tie horizontally using 
the Flip tool from the toolbox. Desaturate the layer. Choose 

6.4  Mobsterville   285
a red color from the foreground color in the toolbox. Set the 
Lock Alpha Channel box in the Layers dialog. Choose the 
Bucket Fill tool from the toolbox. Set the Mode in the Tool 
Options dialog to Grain Merge and the Affected Area to 
Fill Whole Selection. Click in the Red Tie layer to recolor 
the image. This process is done specifically to remove out-of-
gamut colors for prints. Further adjustments may be required 
if you have Color Management configured in the Preferences 
dialog (Edit4Preferences). Use the Move tool to position the 
tie in the proper location on the man’s chest. Set the tie layer 
to the image size.
3.	 Move the Red Tie layer beneath the Rain 1 layer.
A splash of color draws attention to the mobster. The inset image shows the 
selection with Quick Mask enabled and the mask color set to green.
Further Exploration
The last step is to darken the background so the subject is the 
focus of the image. To do this, add a transparent layer just above 
the Building layer. Fill this layer with black. Add a layer mask to it. 
Choose the Blend tool from the toolbox and configure a Radial 
shape that runs from black to medium gray. Click in the middle 
of the man’s face and drag toward the index finger on the gun to 
draw the radial, black-to-gray mask.
To give more depth to the image, you can use two layers of 
rain. Put the Rain 1 layer between the man and the building layer 
and create a new Rain 2 layer at the top of the layer stack.
