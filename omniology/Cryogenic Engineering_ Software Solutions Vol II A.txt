Preface
PREFACE
This book, viz. Cryogenic Engineering: Software solutions – Part-II, is the second in the 
series on Cryogenic Engineering: Software Solutions.
This part is being published in two volumes, viz. Cryogenic Engineering: Software 
solutions – Part-II A and Part-II B. Part-II A contains the background theory, definitions 
and formulas and the problems solved with Engineering Equation Solver (EES). Part-II B 
contains problems solved with Mathcad. So, it is advisable that one refers to both the parts.
As with the Part-I of the series, which dealt with: Introduction and properties of cryogenic 
fluids and properties of materials at low temperatures, the focus is on the solutions of 
problems in cryogenic engineering using software such as Mathcad and Engineering Equation 
Solver (EES). Only the essential theory and summary of equations required for calculations 
are given at the beginning of the chapter.
Advantages of using computer software to solve problems are reiterated:
i)	 It helps in solving the problems fast and accurately 
ii)	Parametric analysis (what-if analysis) and graphical visualization is done very easily. 
This helps in an in-depth analysis of the problem.
iii)	Once a particular type of problem is solved, it can be used as a template and solving 
similar problems later becomes extremely easy.
iv)	In addition, one can plot the data, curve fit, write functions for various properties 
or calculations and re-use them.
v)	These possibilities create interest, curiosity and wonder in the minds of students 
and enthuse them to know more and work more.
This book, viz. Cryogenic Engineering: Software solutions – Part-II deals with the 
liquefaction of gases.
In this book: first, a thermodynamic background for cryogenic liquefaction is given; isenthalpic 
and isentropic expansion, pay-off functions for a liquefier and thermodynamically ideal 
liquefaction system are explained.

Preface
Next, various cycles for liquefaction of gases are explained and the calculation formulas for 
the pay-off functions are given. The cycles dealt with are: simple Linde – Hampson (L-H)
system, pre-cooled L-H system, Linde dual pressure system, Claude system, Kapitza system, 
Heylandt system, cycles for liquefaction of Neon, Hydrogen and Helium, Collin’s Helium 
liquefier etc.
Finally, various types of heat exchangers, hear transfer correlations, calculation formulas and 
graphs for analysis by LMTD and NTU methods are given. And, Second Law analysis of 
the cryogenic systems is explained briefly.
Some data on commercial liquefiers for Air, Hydrogen and Helium are also given.
Many numerical problems are solved to illustrate the ease of computer calculations using 
Engineering Equation Solver (EES) and Mathcad software.
Useful data for Nitrogen, Hydrogen, Helium, Argon, Methane, Fluorine and Oxygen 
are generated from NIST website, i.e. http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/fluid/.
EES has built-in functions for properties of several gases, refrigerants and fluids (including 
cryogenic fluids). Therefore, it is very convenient to use EES in these calculations.
However, Mathcad does not have built-in functions for properties of gases, refrigerants 
and fluids.
So, Mathcad Functions were written for both saturation properties and superheat gas 
properties of above mentioned important cryogenic fluids, viz. Nitrogen, Hydrogen, 
Helium, Argon, Methane, Fluorine and Oxygen. These Functions were used in solving 
problems, illustrating the ease of using Mathcad in calculations and graphing.
Several Procedures/Functions are written in EES and Mathcad to simplify the standard 
and most required calculations, which, the students, teachers, researchers and professionals 
may find very useful.
S.I. Units are used throughout this book. Wide variety of worked examples presented 
in the book should be useful for those appearing for University, AMIE and Engineering 
Services examinations.
Acknowledgements: Firstly, I would like to thank all my students, who have been an 
inspiration to me in all my academic efforts.

3.1.1	 THERMODYNAMIC BACKGROUND: JOULE-THOMSON (J-T) OR 
ISENTHALPIC EXPANSION:
When a high pressure gas passes through a valve, capillary or restriction, its pressure drops 
and the temperature also drops, generally.
From the I Law of Thermodynamics, it can be shown that in this process the enthalpy 
remains constant.
Joule-Thomson coefficient is defined as:
Obviously, 
µJT > 0 to produce a temp drop as the pressure drops,
µJT < 0 for a temp increase as the pressure drops, and
if µJT = zero, then there is no change in temp as the pressure drops through the J-T valve.

Hydrogen, helium, and neon have negative J-T coefficients at ambient temperature; therefore, 
these gases have to be pre-cooled to temperatures below their respective ‘max. inversion 
temperatures’, if they have to produce cooling upon expansion in a J-T valve. Following 
graph illustrates this [7]:

Note from the above graph that constant enthalpy curves go through a maximum. Locus 
of these maximums is called ‘Inversion line’ (3 in fig. above) and the point where this 
inversion line cuts the y-axis (i.e P = 0) is known as ‘Max. inversion temp.’ Note that 
Inversion line divides the P-T graphs in to two regions, viz.:
i)	 Region of cooling upon expansion, i.e. J-T coeff. > 0, is to the left of the Inversion 
curve (region 1 in fig. above),
ii)	Region of heating upon expansion, i.e. J-T coeff. < 0, is to the right of the Inversion 
curve (region 2 in fig. above).
And, on the Inversion curve, J-T coeff. is zero.
Also note that for cooling to occur during a J-T expansion, the initial temp must be below 
the max. inversion temp.

Note from the above Table that max. inversion temps for Neon, Hydrogen and Helium are 
below the room temp (300 K); therefore, these three gases will have to be pre-cooled to a 
temperature below their respective max. inversion temperatures to produce cooling upon 
a J-T expansion.

where v is the sp. volume.
Now, for a ‘perfect gas’, we have:
p. v = R. T,
and, we get, J-T coeff. for a Perfect gas as:
Note that J-T coeff for a Perfect gas is zero, i.e. a Perfect gas will undergo no temperature 
drop during a J-T expansion.
For a ‘Real gas’ which is represented by the Van der Waal’s equation, we have:
where ‘a’ is a measure of intermolecular forces and ‘b’ is a measure of the finite size of 
the molecules.

3.1.2	 THERMODYNAMIC BACKGROUND: ISENTROPIC EXPANSION [1]:
Isentropic expansion coeff is defined as:
From Thermodynamics, and using Maxwell’s equations:
The term (∂v/∂T)p in the above eqn is equal to β.v where β is the volumetric coeff of 
expansion. This is positive for all gases, and T and cp are also positive; so, isentropic expansion 
coefficient is always positive, i.e. isentropic expansion (say, through an expansion engine) 
will always produce a temp drop.
For a perfect gas, pv = RT, and we get:

For a Van der Waal’s gas, one can show that:
which is positive since v > b.
In a liquefier, both the above methods of cooling are used, i.e. isentropic cooling in an 
expansion engine in the beginning and isenthalpic expansion in an expansion valve in the 
final stages.
3.1.3	 PAY-OFF FUNCTIONS FOR A LIQUEFIER:
Three pay-off functions are defined[1]:
•	 Work required per unit mass of gas compressed: -W/m (J/kg)
•	 Work required per unit mass of gas liquefied: -W/mf (J/kg)
•	 Fraction liquefied, y = mf/m

Then, obviously, W/m = (W/mf) * y
Note: -ve sign in the above equations only indicates that work is going in to the system.
Another parameter, i.e. Figure of Merit (FOM) is defined to compare the same system of 
liquefier for different fluids.
FOM is defined as the theoretical minimum work required divided by the actual work 
required for the system:
FOM = Wi/W = (Wi/m) / (W/mf)
FOM has a value between 0 and 1.
In an actual liquefier/refrigerator system, following performance parameters of components 
affect the overall performance of the system:
•	 Compressor and expander adiabatic efficiencies
•	 Compressor and expander mechanical efficiencies
•	 Heat exchanger effectiveness
•	 Pressure drops and
•	 Heat transfer to/from the system

In this system, the gas is compressed in 2 stages. While there is saving in work of compression, 
liquid yield is reduced slightly.

Cryogenic liquefaction systems
Since in the simple L-H system, the liquid yield is a small fraction of the gas compressed, 
not all the gas is expanded to the lowest pressure, but some is expanded to an intermediate 
pressure. We save the work required since for an isothermal compression, work requirement 
depends on the pressure ratio, i.e.
Wc = R T1 ln(p2/p1)

Cryogenic liquefaction systems
We have:
1-2: compression to intermediate pressure
2-3: compression to high pressure, after a return stream is added
3-4: cooling in the heat exchanger
4-5: expansion to an intermediate pressure, where some of the gas is liquefied. Liquid/vapor 
separated in the liquid receiver, and vapor returned to second compressor
6-7: liquid from the first liquid receiver is expanded through the second J-T valve to the 
second liquid receiver
g-1: cold vapor returned through the heat exchanger
Applying the I Law to the heat exchanger, two liquid receivers and the two J-T valves, we 
get the liquid yield for this system as:
where, i is the intermediate flow rate ratio, viz.
where mi is the mass flow rate of intermediate pressure stream at point 8, and m is the 
total mass flow rate through high pressure compressor.
In the above eqn for y, the second term represents the reduction in the liquid yield as 
compared to the simple L-H system.
Applying the I Law to the two compressors, we get the work requirement per unit mass 
of gas compressed in the high pressure compressor:
From the above eqn, we see that the work required is reduced by the second bracketed term, 
as compared the simple L-H system.
In practical systems, i is of the order of 0.8; so, the reduction in work requirement more 
than offsets the reduction in liquid yield.

Work required to liquefy unit mass of Air in the Linde dual pressure system, with p1 = 
0.1 MPa, T1 = 300 K, p3 = 20 MPa, is shown below [1]:
Note: In both the above modifications of the simple L-H system, work requirement per 
unit mass of gas liquefied is less as compared to that for the simple L-H system.
3.1.8	 CLAUDE SYSTEM [1, 9]:
Claude cycle uses an expander for cooling by isentropic expansion of the gas, which gives 
a larger temp drop than for an isenthalpic expansion, for the same pressure ratio. However, 
in the final liquefaction stage, a J-T valve has to be used since expander can not have two-
phase flow through it.

Here, we have:
1-2: isothermal compression (to about 40 atm)
2-3: cooling in the first heat exchanger
At point 3, approx. 60% to 80% is diverted to be expanded in an expander, and then re-
united with the return stream below the second heat exchanger.
3-4: cooling in the second heat exchanger
4-5: cooling in the third heat exchanger
5-6: expansion in J-T valve
g-1:return of the cold vapor through the three heat exchangers
In large Claude systems, the work output of expander is utilized to compress the gas; but, 
in small systems, expander work is dissipated in a brake. However, whether the expander 
work is utilized or not, does not affect the liquid yield; it affects only the compressor net 
work requirement.

Obviously, the last term in the above eqn represents the reduction in work requirements 
due to utilization of expander work.
From the above eqn we see that to calculate W, we need to know h3, i.e. temp T3, just 
before entering the expander.
For given high pressure p2 and expander flow rate ratio x, there is an optimum T3 which 
will make the work requirement a minimum.

3.1.15	ORTHO-PARA- HYDROGEN CONVERSION IN THE LIQUEFIER [1]:
Hydrogen exists in two molecular forms: ortho-H2 and para-H2.
In ortho-H2, the two protons of the H2 molecule possess the spin in the same direction, 
and in para-H2, the spins are in opposite directions as shown below:
Mixture of o-H2 and p-H2 at high temps is called normal hydrogen, and it has 75% o-H2 
and 25% p-H2, by volume.
Equilibrium mixture of o-H2 and p-H2 is called equilibrium hydrogen (e-H2). Concentration 
of o-H2 and p-H2 in equilibrium hydrogen depends on temp. At the normal boiling point 
of hydrogen, e-H2 has a composition of 0.21% o_H2 and 99.79% p-H2, i.e. practically 
all p-H2.
Concentration of p-H2 in equilibrium H2 at different temps is shown in following Table [1]:
Now, during the liquefaction of H2, temp falls from say, 300 K to 20.3 K, and the 
conversion of ortho-H2 to para-H2 does not occur instantaneously, but occurs in a slow 
process. However, if this conversion occurs in the LH2 storage dewar, there will be a very 
high boil-off loss, since the conversion of o-H2 to p-H2 is exothermic reaction. So, the 
method is to use a catalyst to speed up the process of conversion from o-H2 to p-H2 during 
the liquefaction itself.

Fin effectiveness, surface effectiveness and overall coeff of heat transfer:
Fins are used to extend the area of heat transfer; however, 100% of fin area is not effective 
since there is some temperature gradient along the fin due to its finite thermal conductivity.
Fin-area effectiveness for plate fins and straight fins is given by:
where
In the above,
kf = thermal conductivity of the fin material,
δ = Vf / Af = Volume of fin/Surface area of fin,
Lf = Length of fin if one end of fin is free, or one-half the fin length if the fin is attached 
at both ends.
Surface effectiveness:
If the total heat transfer area is A0, then:
A0 = Af + Ap, where Af = fin surface area, and Ap = bare (or prime) surface area.
Prime surface area is 100% effective.
Then, if the surface effectiveness is η0, we can write:
Then, surface effectiveness is given by:
Note that effective heat transfer area is: η0.A0

coeff of heat transfer based on the warm-side heat transfer area A0,h is given by:

no fins are used on a surface, its surface effectiveness is unity.

For a counter-flow heat exchanger (see fig. c above):
where CR = Cmin / Cmax
Two special cases of counter-flow exchanger are:
balanced operation (i.e. Cmin = Cmax, or CR = 1), and
phase change on one side (i.e. Cmax = ∞, or CR = 0).
For these two cases, we have:
For a parallel-flow heat exchanger (see fig. d above):
For balanced operation, in parallel flow:
For condensation or boiling on one side:
i.e. when there is a phase change on one side, it does not matter if the flow arrangement

Log-mean-temp-difference (LMTD) approach [23]:
Recollect that heat transfer between the two fluid streams in a heat exchanger can be 
written as:
Q = U A ΔTm, where U is the overall heat transfer coeff, A is the area of heat transfer and 
ΔTm is the mean temp difference between the two fluid streams.
ΔTm has to be used since, generally, the temp difference between the streams is not constant 
along the length of the heat exchanger. See the fig. below:

It is found that the mean temp difference is a logarithmic expression, and therefore, it is 
also known as Logarithmic Mean Temp Difference (LMTD).
For parallel flow and counter-flow heat exchangers, we have, for LMTD:
Remember that ΔT1 and ΔT2 are the max and min temp differences in the heat exchangers, 
as shown below:
Note: When ΔT1 = ΔT2 = ΔT, say, then the LMTD is given as: LMTD = ΔT

3.1.21	SECOND LAW ANALYSIS (OR, EXERGY ANALYSIS) [25, 26, 27]: 
Summary of definitions, statements and formulas used, essential for problem solving 
only are given below:
‘Availability’ or ‘Available energy’ or ‘Exergy’: 
For a heat engine, we know from II Law that all the heat available can not be converted to 
work, and some amount of heat is necessarily to be rejected to the sink. So, the amount of 
heat rejected is the ‘unavailable part’ of the energy and the Wmax obtained is the ‘available 
part’ of the energy.
Thus, by definition: ‘A system delivers the max. possible work as it undergoes a reversible 
process from the specified initial state to the state if its environment, that is, the ‘dead state’. 
This is the ‘useful work potential’ of the system at the specified state and is called ‘Exergy’.
Exergy of heat:
For a heat engine, if heat Q is supplied at a constant source temp of TH and the environment 
is at T0, the exergy or the max. work output is:
Wmax = Q.(1- T0/TH)
i.e. Wmax = Q – T0. Δs, where Δs is the change in entropy in the process.
Also, the unavailable energy (or ‘anergy’) = T0 .Δs
For a refrigerator: if heat Q is absorbed at a constant source temp of Tz and the environment 
is at T0, the exergy or the min. work required is:
Wmin = Q / [Tz / (T0 – Tz)] = Q. [(T0 / Tz) – 1)]
i.e. Wmin = T0. Δs – Q, where Δs is the change in entropy in the process.
Exergy of Work: Exergy of work is work itself, since there is no thermodynamic restriction 
on its availability.
Exergy of Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy: Again, the exergies of K.E. and P.E. are 
the respective energies themselves.

If heat is supplied at varying temperatures, i.e. at constant pressure:
Then, Available energy for a heat engine is easily calculated as follows:
Note that:
Heat supplied = cp. (T2 – T1) …J/kg = area 1-2-6-5-1
Unavailable energy = area 4-3-6-5-4 = T0. Δs = T0. cp .ln(T2/T1)…J/kg
Available energy = area 1-2-3-4-1
i.e. Available energy = area 1-2-6-5-1 – area 4-3-6-5-4
i.e. Available energy = cp. (T2 – T1) – T0. cp. ln(T2/T1)…J/kg
Note that in the above equations, temp should be in Kelvin.

Exergy of cold produced eqL = Q. (Tz – T0) / T0…when refrigerator temp is Tz
This exergy is negative, indicating that work has to be supplied.

Let the initial conditions of the flow system be p1, T1, Z1. Let this state be reduced to 
atmospheric or ‘dead state’ denoted by p0, T0, Z0 (= 0), through an ideal process. Then,
In many systems, changes in K.E and P.E. can be considered as negligible. Then,
This is also known as exergy of mass flow.

We have, per unit mass:
Second Law efficiency, ηII[27]: Thermal efficiency for heat engines and coefficient of 
performance for refrigerators are based on the first law of thermodynamics and referred to 
as the first-law efficiencies.
Second-law efficiency is defined based on II Law:
The second-law efficiency for a heat engine is defined as the ratio of the useful work output 
to the maximum possible work output (for work-producing device, such as turbine), or the 
ratio of the minimum work input to the actual useful work input (for work-consuming 
device, such as compressor).
For refrigerators or heat Pumps, it is defined as the ratio of the actual COP to the COP of 
reversible process. For mixing chambers, the second-law efficiency is defined as the ratio of 
the exergy recovered to the exergy supplied.

Exergy balance:
Exergy balance is written for each component of a system to find out the relative magnitudes 
of ‘exergy losses’ in those components so that corrective action can be taken to reduce the 
losses.
Writing the exergy balance for components of a steady flow system, such as compressors, 
turbines, throttle valves, heat exchangers etc is as follows [6]:

from 20 atm, 300 K to 1 atm is shown for each gas.
Note that for Helium, Hydrogen and Neon, final temp Tf is higher than initial temp 
Ti upon expansion. This is due to the fact that the max. inversion temp for these fluids is 
lower than the initial temp before expansion, Ti = 300 K. See below the max. inversion temp

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Note that there is temp increase during expansion from 200 atm to any lower pressure 
(i.e. ΔT is negative). This is due to the fact that the initial temp Ti before expansion 
(i.e. 300 K) is higher than the max. inversion temp of Helium, i.e. 40 K. For the same 
reason, the J-T coeff is also negative.

Now, calculate the isothermal work required for Nitrogen gas:
“Calculations:”
“Data:”
Fluid$ = ‘Nitrogen’
T1 = 300 “K”
P1 = 101.325 “kPa”
P2 = 200 * 101.325 “kPa”
eta_iso = 0.8 “…Isothermal effcy.”
Isoth_Work_N2 = Wcomp_isoth(Fluid$, T1, P1, P2)

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Thus:
Expander flow rate ratio, x = 0.4983, for a Liquid yield y = 0.2…Ans.
In addition:
Work output of expander per unit mass compressed = 76.37 kJ/kg…Ans.
Net work requirement of the system per unit mass liquefied = 1219 kJ/kg…Ans.
FOM = 0.6082…Ans.
“Prob. 3.2.26 In an Ideal Kapitza liquefaction system for Nitrogen, the system operates 
from 101.3 kPa (1 atm) and 300 K to 5.07 MPa. At 5.07 MPa and 240 K, 50% of the 
main flow is diverted to the reversible adiabatic expander. Remainder flows through the heat 
exchanger and expands through the expansion valve to 101.3 kPa. Determine the liquid 
yield and the work per unit mass liquefied, assuming that the expander work is utilized in 
the compression process. [1].”
“Solution:”
“Note that Kapitza system is similar to Claude system except that the last heat exchanger 
(i.e. low temp heat exchanger) is eliminated and the first heat exchanger consists of 
regenerators.
For calculation purposes, the formulas are the same as for Claude system.”

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Cryogenic liquefaction systems
Prob. 3.2.45. Data for an ideal Kapitza system is given below:
Nitrogen is the working fluid, the system operates from 101.3 kPa (1 atm) and 300 K to 
5.07 MPa (i.e. 50 atm.). At 5.07 MPa and 255 K, 40% of the main flow is diverted to 
the reversible adiabatic expander. Remainder flows through the heat exchanger and expands 
through the expansion valve to 101.3 kPa. Determine the liquid yield and the work per 
unit mass liquefied, assuming that the expander work is utilized in the compression process. 
Make a second law analysis of the system.
Solution:
“Note that Kapitza system is similar to Claude system except that the last heat exchanger (i.e. 
low temp heat exchanger) is eliminated and the first heat exchanger consists of regenerators.
For calculation purposes, the formulas are the same as for Claude system.”

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!
