What is an 
engineer?
An engineer is a problem solver. Engineers  
use math and science to build things—from  
the tiniest particles to the tallest buildings. 
They invent new technologies, and make 
existing technologies even better.

New ideas
Engineers come up with ideas  
for new inventions, and make 
existing designs better. Your  
idea could lead to a medical 
device that helps cure an illness, 
a spacecraft that carries humans 
to Mars, a new clean power 
source, or an earthquake.
Creative approaches
Being an engineer means coming up 
with solutions to difficult problems. 
Having studied math and science, 
engineers use their knowledge to design 
new systems and products that could 
change lives, from earthquake-proof 
buildings to cures for deadly diseases.
Engineers  
designed and built 
the Pyramids, the 
airplane, and

Around the world
Engineers work in every country on  
the planet. While the building 
materials, landscapes, and problems 
that they face may be different, 
engineers use the same creativity 
and problem-solving methods 
wherever they work. 
Engineers 
everywhere
Engineering is an exciting 
job if you love adventure. 
An engineer might create a 
new design on a computer 
and then get to travel to all 
sorts of places to help it be 
built and tested. Engineers 
work on giant jet engines, 
at the very top of wind 
turbines, under the ocean, 
and even in space!
How do I become  
an engineer?
While you are at school, you’ll learn a lot of 
the math and science you need. Later, you 
can go to college and study engineering. 
Most importantly, keep dreaming of  
new ways of solving problems!

First 
engineers
Ancient engineers had only simple tools to 
work with, but they built some of the 
world’s most famous buildings, from the 
Pyramids in Egypt to the Parthenon in 
Greece. Some simple machines invented in 
ancient times include the lever, the crane, 
and the first clocks.
Ancient clock
Water clocks are one of the 
oldest ways of telling time. 
The hours could be measured 
because the water always 
took the same length of  
time to drip from one tank  
to another.
Roman crane
Cranes use pulleys to lift heavy loads. 
It is easier to pull down on a rope to 
move something than to lift it by 
hand. The Romans used cranes  
to lift stone when they were 
building structures such as 
the Colosseum in Rome.
The first  
cities were  
built around  
4000 bce.

Useful levers
Levers are bars that rest on a 
point called a fulcrum. They 
make it easier to push or lift 
weights. The long handles of a 
wheelbarrow act as a lever, 
with the wheel as the fulcrum. 
Wheelbarrows were invented 
in China around 220 bce.
Water lifter
The Archimedean screw is an 
Ancient Egyptian invention 
for lifting water. A wooden 
spiral is built inside a tube, 
with one end in the water. 
When the handle is turned, 
the water is trapped in the 
spiral and lifted to the top.
Wheeled 
chariot
The wheel was invented 
around 3500 bce. At first, wheels 
were heavy and only used on 
slow-moving carts. By 1600 bce, the 
Ancient Egyptians had invented fast 
chariots that could be pulled into 
battle by horses. One soldier drove the 
chariot and another one fired arrows.
Using spokes instead  
of solid wood made 
wheels lighter.
 
The handle was 
turned by a person 
on the riverbank.

Interview with Leonardo da Vinci
Genius inventor
Leonardo da Vinci is best known as the artist 
who painted the Mona Lisa but he was also a 
self-taught engineer. He was fascinated by how 
everything worked—from the human body to 
military machines. Here, we imagine what an 
interview with da Vinci might have been like.
FACT FILE
» Name: Leonardo da Vinci
» Dates: 1452–1519
» Location: Vinci, Italy
» Fun fact: Da Vinci loved 
all animals. He bought 
caged birds so that he 
could set them free.
Q: How old were you when you  
became an engineer?
A: I didn’t get an engineering job until I 
was 30 years old. After that, I worked as 
a military engineer for 17 years  
in the city of Milan, Italy.
Q: How did you get your first  
job as an engineer?
A: In the 1480s, the people of Milan 
needed help because they were at war 
with the city of Venice. I wrote to 
Duke Sforza telling him about my 
military inventions, such as a huge 
cannon. He loved my ideas!
Q: Why were you interested in 
engineering when you were already  
an artist?
A: It’s as much fun to design amazing 
machines as it is to paint people and 
landscapes. I can use my drawing and 
designing skills to design my engineering 
projects. Also, engineers are paid a lot more 
than artists in the 15th century!

9
Q: What are your  
favorite projects?
A: I designed weapons such as 
tanks, catapults, submarines, and 
machine guns. I also worked on 
better levers, gears, and cranes. 
But my favorite inventions 
include machines for flying and 
breathing underwater.
Q: Some people say you have 
designed a self-moving machine.  
Is this true? 
A: Yes! In 1495, I came up with plans for a 
wind-up, self-moving machine with three 
wheels. I didn’t manage to make it work in 
real life, though.
Q: What is your greatest weakness  
as an engineer?
A: I am easily distracted by new ideas, and 
I often leave projects unfinished. I only 
managed to finish 17 paintings.
Q: What do you think is the most 
important skill for a good engineer?
A: Creativity and imagination! Engineers 
must be able to look at a project that has 
already been started and see how to make 
it even better in the future.
Q: Did any of your projects fail?
A: My design for a huge statue of a horse 
was ready to be built when Duke Sforza 
gave all the bronze away! He used it to 
bribe an enemy army not to attack Milan.
Da Vinci designed 
this catapult like 
a giant crossbow.
Da Vinci wrote 
backward  
to keep his 
thoughts secret.
Da Vinci’s design 
for a parachute, 
made from 
wood and cloth.
In 2000, da Vinci’s parachute  
was finally built and floated safely 
down 2 miles (3 km).

Problem solving
Engineers look at the problems that we face in  
everyday life and try to make our lives more comfortable, 
quicker, and easier. Engineers have solved problems like 
keeping cool in the summer, developing energy from 
nature, getting food from farms to stores, flying, and 
exploring space. Take the quiz to match the problem with 
its invention.  
Wind  
turbines
A wind turbine 
captures energy  
and turns it into 
electricity. The 
electricity is made 
when wind turns  
the blades of the 
turbine.

New York. It will include 
hotels, stores, schools, 
houses, and parks.
Satellites
A satellite sends live TV 
signals and telephone calls 
around the world. Satellites 
in space are linked to some 
on Earth, which pick up 
signals and turn them into 
pictures and sounds.

Changing ideas
The ”Walkie Talkie’“ 
skyscraper in London  
was designed with a 
curved shape that 
reflected the Sun’s rays 
and accidentally melted 
part of a car. Engineers 
designed a protective 
shade for the building to 
solve the problem. 
Refrigerator
A refrigerator works by changing  
a substance called a coolant from  
a liquid to a gas and back again. This 
series of changes keeps the space 
cold and food fresh.
Aqueducts
An aqueduct is 
designed to carry 
water slowly from a 
hillside into a town.

Materials
Everything around us is made from 
something. We call these somethings 
“materials.” Engineers create, change, 
and test materials that we use every 
day. Our phones, cars, and even babies’ 
diapers are all made from carefully 
chosen, specially engineered materials.
Some engine parts 
are made from 
ceramics.
Plastic
Plastics are manufactured 
materials. They are cheap to 
produce and have insulating 
properties, which means 
they keep heat in or out.
Fabric
Engineers can create fabrics with 
special abilities—for example, fabrics 
that block harmful rays from the Sun. 
Some clothing is designed to pull 
sweat away from the body, using tiny 
threads that are very close together.
Ceramics
Ceramics are materials 
formed at very high 
temperatures. Most  
ceramics are very hard,  
but brittle, which means  
they break easily.

13
Metal
Metals have a solid structure, which makes 
them strong. They can be bent into many 
different shapes—from staircases to long 
thin wires. Metals conduct electricity, 
which means an electric current can  
move through them.
Wood
Wood is a natural material from trees. 
Engineers add other materials to the 
surface of wood to stop it from rotting. 
Wood is used as a building material all 
over the world.
Concrete
Concrete is used for many 
structures, such as buildings, 
bridges, and streets, because  
it can hold heavy weights without 
being crushed. It is made from  
a mixture of cement, stones,  
and water.
Composite
A composite material is 
created when two or more 
materials are combined  
to make a new one. 
Engineers make composite 
materials that are strong 
but very light.

14
Machines
Machines can do tasks that  
are too tiny, huge, boring, or 
dangerous for humans. Some 
machines can be controlled by a 
human, such as a kitchen blender. 
Others can be programmed to 
follow instructions without 
human control, such  
as driverless vehicles.  
Engine
A car’s engine burns fuel to 
spin its wheels, moving it 
forward much faster than a 
human could possibly run. 
Formula 1 racing cars use 
very powerful fuel, and can 
travel at up to 231 mph  
(372 kph).

Driverless tractor
Driverless technology 
allows farmers to mow  
and plant their fields  
from home! They put 
instructions into a 
computer, and then the 
tractor does all the work. 
Crane arm
By using levers and hydraulic power 
(water pressure), crane arms are able to 
lift much more weight than humans 
could ever manage.
Robotic arm
Robot arms can precisely grip and lift 
small parts, so they are useful for 
making goods such as cars. Robots can 
make the same movements hundreds 
of times, without getting tired or 
making mistakes.

Cars
The first car was made over 120 years ago. 
It was called the Benz Motorwagen, had 
three wheels, and could only go as fast as  
6 mph (10 kph). Modern cars have four 
wheels and can reach speeds of up to  
273 mph (439 kph). Engineers are always 
developing cars that are safer, more 
environmentally friendly, and that  
cost less to run.
Smooth shape
The car has a smooth shape  
so that air can pass easily 
over the body. This lets the 
car travel faster.
Hood
In most cars the engine is under a lid, called 
the hood. In the McLaren F1, the hood has 
a gold layer inside, which protects the car 
from the heat of the engine. 
Fit for purpose
Cars are used for lots of different 
tasks. Some need to be able to 
go very fast, carry a lot of people, 
or move heavy materials a long 
way. Engineers keep these 
specific needs in mind when 
they design a car.

on sand dunes.
Electric car
Battery powered 
Engineers have created 
cars that run off big 
rechargeable batteries. 
These batteries are 
charged by electricity. 
They are better for the 
environment because 
they do not release  
any gas.
Tricky terrain
For tough, bumpy surfaces cars need to have a special 
design and shape. They have big tires so they are 
higher off the ground. This keeps them more stable 
and makes sure they don’t trip over any obstacles.
Exhaust
The exhaust lets 
the hot gases 
produced by the 
engine escape. The 
pipes of the exhaust 
remove the gases as 
quickly as possible.
Tires
A tire’s tread is the 
pattern of grooves that 
you see on the outside. 
They let water pass 
underneath and help 
the car grip the road.

18
Power
We need electricity to run most 
machines—from ovens to space 
rockets. Engineers design and 
build the different structures 
that create electricity. Most 
electricity is made in large power 
plants from burning fossil fuels, 
or using renewable sources such 
as wind or water power. Steam is 
created that then turns a 
turbine, a machine with blades 
that spins so quickly it can 
create electricity.
Fossil fuels
Coal, gas, and oil are all fossil fuels. These are 
made up of the squashed remains of plants 
and animals. When they are burned, they 
heat up water to create steam, which then 
turns a turbine.
Wind power
The arms of wind turbines turn when the wind 
blows, which creates electricity. Large turbines 
create a lot more power. Modern turbines can 
be more than 328 ft (100 m) tall! 
Water power
Water flowing downhill can turn a turbine to 
create power. Engineers make use of this by 
building dams with turbines in them. Ocean 
waves and currents can also be used.
Nuclear power
Nuclear power uses a process called fission, 
where atoms are split apart. The heat this 
creates boils water to make steam, which 
then turns turbines to produce electricity. 
Geothermal power
Geothermal power uses the natural heat of 
the Earth. One way to create power is to 
pump cold water deep under the Earth’s 
surface, where it is so hot it turns into the 
steam needed to turn a turbine.
Solar power
Solar panels are made up of cells that absorb 
sunlight. The light is then turned into 
electricity. Solar panels work best where there 
is lots of sunlight and hardly any clouds.
Power networks
Electricity is transported from power plants to 
homes and offices through aluminum cables.  
They are held above the ground by metal towers 
called electricity pylons.
Electricity pylons

19
Hydroelectric dam 
Dams turn rivers into 
lakes, which create higher 
pressure. The weight of 
the water rotates turbines 
inside the dam.
Nuclear reactor
Just 1/3 oz (6 g) of nuclear 
fuel can make as much 
energy as 1.1 ton (1 metric 
ton) of coal. However, the 
uranium used to make 
nuclear fuel is rare.
Coal power plan
The white smoke rising 
from the towers of coal 
power stations is steam 
from the boiling water 
used to turn the turbines 
that make electricity.
Wind farm
Groups of wind turbines 
are called wind farms.  
They are built where there 
are few people and strong 
winds. Some are even 
built out at sea.
Solar farm
The energy produced 
from a single solar panel 
is very small. Solar farms 
have large groups of solar 
panels, called arrays.
Geothermal power
Places like Iceland and 
Japan have hot areas 
under the Earth’s surface. 
This makes it easier to 
heat up water to create 
geothermal power.

20
Robots
Robots are machines that are built by engineers to do jobs and 
perform actions that would otherwise be done by a human. 
Robots do the things that people do, but with more force and 
speed, and more precisely. There are more than a million robots  
in the world—they are all around us! 
Humanoids
Humanoid robots look and move like 
humans. They can work with tools and let 
engineers learn more about how the human 
body works and moves. A humanoid with a 
human face is called an android. 
Robot workers
Robots can be used to do jobs that need care 
and speed. They are used to build cars, carry 
out surgery, and harvest food on farms. Some 
of these robots are controlled by humans, while 
others are programmed to work on their own.
Asimo is the most 
advanced robot in the 
world. It can move  
like a person and can 
recognize humans.
Some robots work 
together on factory 
production lines to 
make cars. Each 
robot does the 
same job over 
and over again.  

21
Robot body parts
Engineers have created robotic body parts 
that can be attached to humans. These 
robotic body parts are called prosthetics. 
They are controlled by the brain of the 
person wearing them.
Hard to reach
Robots can reach places that humans 
can’t. They are used underwater, in space, 
and underground, because these places 
can be dangerous for humans. They find 
objects, collect data, and take pictures.
Robots with feelings
The big difference between robots and 
humans is that humans have emotions. 
Engineers have made robots that respond 
to a human’s feelings. One of these robots, 
Kismet, responds to the feelings of the 
person it is communicating with by moving 
its face and changing the tone of its voice.
Robot arms  
move in the same  
way that real arms 
move. They are 
powered by batteries.
Kurt I is a robot that 
works in the sewers.  
It makes sure 
everything is working 
properly and fixes 
things that aren’t.

Incredible 
engineers
Everything around us started out 
as an idea. Great thinkers have 
dreamed up new inventions to 
improve our daily lives—and they 
continue to do so. From early 
machines and basic technologies to 
soaring skyscrapers and futuristic 
robots, the engineering industry 
continues to shape our world.
George Stephenson
Known as the “Father of Railroads,” 
George Stephenson (1781–1848) 
designed and built the first 
commercial locomotive. The Rocket 
was the first vehicle to go faster than  
a horse, at 29 mph (47 kph).

Alexander Graham Bell
After working as a speech therapist for 
deaf people, scientist Alexander 
Graham Bell (1847–1922) invented 
the telephone. Speech could be sent 
along wires for the first time, changing 
the way we communicate.
Isambard Kingdom Brunel
Engineer Brunel (1806–1859) 
designed and built ships, bridges, and 
railroads. His SS Great Britain was the 
first iron steamship with a propeler to 
cross the Atlantic. He also worked on 
the first tunnel to be built underwater.

GIANT DRILL
The Russian Typhoon Class are the world’s 
biggest submarines. They are 574 ft (175 m) in 
length—longer than five blue whales. They can 
stay underwater for four months at a time, are 
nuclear-powered, and carry weapons like missiles.
Tunnel boring machines are used to dig  
giant tunnels underground for roads and 
railroads. The largest one in the world is 
named Bertha. It can drill or bore a hole as 
tall as a five-story building.
Road train
Extreme 
machines
These amazing machines are all 
extremely big, heavy, or powerful. 
This means they are perfectly 
suited to doing certain jobs, such 
as lifting, carrying, or drilling.
Some Australian outback trucks 
can pull three long trailers. 
These megatrucks, called 
road trains, can be as long 
as two basketball courts 
and carry the equivalent 
weight of 40 elephants!

25
Super Guppy
This enormous but strange-looking plane was 
built by NASA to transport large cargo, such as 
satellites, rockets, and smaller planes. It opens 
in the middle, allowing the cargo on and off. 
The largest crane in the world is the Taisun 
gantry crane, currently in Sandong Province, 
China. It can lift 22,000 tons (19,600 metric 
tons), and is used to move large materials 
around and build boats in shipyards.
GANTRY CRANE
The American Nimitz 
Class are the world’s 
largest aircraft carriers. 
Carrying over 6,000 
people, they can go 20 
years without refueling. 
The flight deck holds 
more than 60 aircraft!
Supercarrier
This particle accelerator is used  
for physics experiments that try  
to understand how the world began  
and what it is made out of. It uses 
magnets to “shoot” particles extremely 
fast, and is the world’s biggest machine. 
It is in Switzerland and is almost 
entirely underground.

Going uphill
There is only one 
motor in a roller 
coaster. It moves  
the car up the  
first slope.
Upside down
Roller coaster car
The car of the roller coaster 
holds the riders. There is no 
engine on a roller coaster 
car—it runs on the energy it 
transfers as the car goes up 
and down hills and loops.
Roller coasters
Engineers create complicated and careful 
designs to make roller coasters safe and  
fun. Mechanical, electrical, and structural 
engineers all work together to imagine,  
design, and build these exciting machines.

Early roller coaster
Thrill ride
When you are upside 
down on a roller coaster, 
you are being pushed  
and pulled around by 
different forces. Gravity is 
trying to pull you out of 
your seat, but acceleration 
pushes you into your seat. 
This is why you end up 
feeling weightless.
Wooden coasters
The first roller coasters 
were called switchback 
railroads. They were made 
of wood, didn’t have loops, 
and were much slower 
and shorter than modern 
roller coasters. 
The Kingda Ka  
in the US is the tallest 
roller coaster in the 
world. Its tallest point 
is 456 ft (139 m) from 
the ground! 
Wheels
Wheels prevent the car 
from wobbling and

Brakes
Roller coasters have 
magnetic, automatic 
breaks so that the 
cars can be stopped.

Flying machines
Flying machines are usually known as aircraft. They include 
planes, helicopters, gliders, and drones. Aircraft have come a 
long way since the Wright brothers made their first flight in 
1903—they can now fly all the way around the world.
Avro 504
The Avro 504 was 
used for bombing and 
spying by the British 
in World War I. It was 
a biplane, which 
means an aircraft with 
two wings stacked one 
above the other.

The Wright 
brothers
Orville and Wilbur Wright invented the 
world’s first airplane. In 1903, the Wright 
Flyer made its first flight and changed the 
way that people traveled. The brothers  
tested and invented every part of their  
flying machines so well that many of  
their ideas are still used today. 
Orville and Wilbur became 
interested in engineering 
when they were children  
and their father bought  
them a flying toy. 
In 1892, the Wrights started their 
first engineering business, making 
and selling bicycles. They soon 
decided to aim for the sky.
To test their ideas, 
the brothers built a 
wind tunnel. These 
tests meant that 
they could study 
how wings would 
work in the air.
The pair wanted 
to build a flying 
machine. They 
studied birds and 
learned how their 
wings worked. 
They noticed that 
the wings moved 
in different parts.

31
In 1909, the brothers set up the 
Wright Company. They made 
planes and trained pilots.
Next, the Wright 
brothers designed 
a glider that had 
narrow wings 
with parts that 
could be 
controlled by  
the pilot. This 
meant that the 
pilot could steer 
the airplane up 
and down, and 
left to right.
The Wright Flyer changed the way that people 
traveled forever. Many of the brothers’ discoveries 
are still used when building airplanes and space 
shuttles today. 
Once the wings were finished, the brothers added an engine to 
create the Wright Flyer. They tested it at Kitty Hawk in North 
Carolina. It only flew 120 ft (37 m), but they’d done it!

32
Jet engines
Planes fly using thrust and lift. 
Thrust is created in the engines  
by pushing air and hot gases out  
of the back at high speeds. This 
pushes the plane forward. Lift 
keeps the aircraft in the air and  
is created by air rushing over the 
wing that pulls the plane up.
Nose
The nose is pointed 
to cut smoothly 
through the air.
Cockpit
The cockpit is where the 
pilots sit to control  
the aircraft. 
Engines
Several engines are 
needed to power  
the heavy plane.
Jumbo jet engines
Jumbo jets get their name from 
their huge size, which means 
they need large engines, too.  
A passenger liner carries up to 
54,000 gallons (200,000 liters)  
of fuel on long flights.
Fan blades
Jumbo jet 
engines have 
huge fans that 
suck in cold air. 
The fan blades 
are made from  
a strong metal 
called titanium.
This fan is 10 ft (3 m) wide

33
Contrails
Burning fuel and air creates white 
streaks of vapor called contrails.
Wings
The wings provide lift, which 
keeps the jet in the air.
The world’s  
largest jumbo 
jet can carry 853 
passengers.

How does a jet 
engine work?
The jet engine is a type of 
engine that uses air mixed  
with fuel. It is also known as a 
turbofan. The engine takes in  
air, mixes it with fuel, and burns 
the mixture to create thrust.

Nanotechnology
Nanotechnology is engineering on a scale so tiny it can’t even 
be seen with a normal microscope. Engineers work at this 
scale to tackle very small problems like bacteria in the body 
or rain getting your clothes wet. Eventually, they hope to 
create machines so small they can travel inside your body to 
release medicine exactly where it is needed.
Antibacterial bandages
Silver nanoparticles kill bacteria. Doctors and nurses use 
liquid silver as a treatment to stop wounds from getting 
infected. Engineers can now make bandages with silver 
nanoparticles in them, which are easier to use.
Sun protection
Sunblock cream can be made from nanoparticles of 
special chemicals that absorb harmful UV light from the 
Sun. Their tiny size means they are transparent and make 
the cream feel very light on your skin.

How small is a 
nanoparticle?
A nanometer is one-millionth 
of a millimeter. Objects on  
the nanoscale are less than 
100 nm (nanometers) in 
length. They can only be seen 
through very powerful 
microscopes.
Water-repellent fabric
Nanoparticles of silicone can be added to fabrics to make 
them completely waterproof. Because nanoparticles are 
so tiny, they can completely cover any holes in the 
fabric’s surface and block water from being absorbed. 
Super-strong material
The strongest, thinnest, lightest material that engineers 
have created so far is called graphene. It is 200 times 
stronger than steel and is made from a single layer  
of pure carbon atoms (tiny particles that make up all 
materials), arranged in a honeycomb pattern.

Space 
engineers
Traveling into space is one of the 
greatest engineering achievements 
in history. Every tiny thing that 
travels into space is carefully 
designed by huge teams of scientists 
and engineers, to make space travel 
as safe and problem-free as possible.
Special materials
The materials that are 
used in space need to 
be strong, and able  
to survive extreme 
temperatures. They 
also need to be light 
enough to be taken 
into space.
Solar arrays
The solar arrays on the 
International Space Station (ISS) 
gather energy from the Sun and 
convert it into electricity. They 
cover an area bigger than the 
length of two tennis courts.
Robot arm
Large robotic arms are 
used to move huge objects  
and astronauts into very 
precise locations.

37
Exploring space
Clever engineering lets us visit  
and explore space. We even send 
machines to planets that humans 
cannot land on yet. 
Back and forth
Space shuttles were  
used to carry astronauts  
and equipment into 
space. US space shuttles 
have carried out 135 
missions into space,  
with each shuttle  
takeoff generating as 
much power as 15,000 
train engines.
Life on Mars
A rover is a large robot that drives around a 
planet taking pictures and collecting data 
for scientists to study. There are currently 
four active rovers on the surface of Mars.
Spacesuit
An astronaut’s spacesuit protects 
the astronaut in space. Objects fly 
very fast in space, so even small bits 
of dust could injure an unprotected 
astronaut. Spacesuits also provide 
astronauts with oxygen, water, and 
protection from the Sun.

Medicine
Chemical engineers 
use natural and synthetic 
chemicals to make medicines. 
They experiment to find out 
which chemicals make people 
better, and what treatments 
work best, so that people 
can live longer and 
healthier lives. 
Food 
and drink
Some food products are 
engineered. Preservatives, 
flavoring, dyes, and vitamins 
are added to food. They can 
make it last longer, and taste 
and look nicer. 
Environment
Chemical engineers help 
keep the environment clean. 
They work to improve 
recycling, clean up oil spills, 
and build systems to reduce 
harmful gas formation. 
Mix it up!
Chemical engineers use chemicals to make new 
products, and to make existing products better. 
Natural chemicals come from plants and 
animals, while synthetic chemicals are created 
in laboratories. When chemicals are mixed 
together, they react and change. Everyday 
things, such as medicines, toilet paper, and 
plastic, are all created by chemical engineering.

39
Energy
Engineers have 
developed ways to get 
energy from different 
sources, such as coal, gas, the 
Sun, and wind. They are now 
trying to work out how to get 
energy from plants. 
Materials
Engineers develop 
materials that work in 
different ways. Plastic can be 
changed into many forms. For 
example, it can be used for 
packaging, fabrics, and 
building. 
Clothes
Clothes are designed 
for exact uses, such as to 
be waterproof or warm. The 
special materials used in 
waterproof clothing are 
designed so that water slides 
off them. They are created 
using synthetic 
chemicals.

Building our world
Have you ever walked over a bridge, drunk water from a faucet, 
or taken a train? These are all things that civil engineers make 
happen. They help design and construct things that make the 
everyday life of the whole world go smoothly.
Tunnels
Instead of building a road 
over an obstacle, it may be 
safer or cheaper to build a 
tunnel through or under it. 
Civil engineers also keep 
people safe while they are  
in the tunnel, by building in 
lights and a good flow of air.
Roads
Roads play an important 
role in every country. In the 
US, there are over 4 million 
miles (6.5 million km) of 
road. Engineers decide what 
materials to build roads 
from so that they will last a 
long time. 
Canals
Networks of canals allow 
boats to travel between 
different bodies of water. 
They can be as simple as  
a ditch between two lakes, 
or as complex as a channel 
between two oceans.

41
Railroads
Trains are a very useful  
way of transporting people 
and goods across land.  
On average, a train car  
uses one-quarter of the  
fuel a truck uses. Railroads  
also help lower car traffic.
Buildings
Buildings protect people 
and their possessions 
from the cold, wind, and 
rain. Civil engineers are in 
charge of the structure of 
a building, which allows it 
to support weight and 
stand up against weather. 
Dams
Dams block the flow of a 
river, letting water build 
up behind them to form a 
lake. The flow of water 
through the dam can then 
be used to make electricity.
Bridges
Engineers design bridges to 
support the weight of cars, 
trucks, trains, and people as 
they cross rivers, bays, and 
canyons. Civil engineers 
decide what type of bridge  
is best for the kind of traffic 
it will carry.

Underground
Engineers design important underground 
systems that keep cities running. Cables 
bring electricity to homes and businesses 
and pipes bring water and take away waste. 
Public transportation moves thousands of 
people around much more quickly than cars 
can. Tunnels are buried where there are no 
buildings or traffic to get in the way. Take  
a look at what goes on under our feet!

Key
» 1. Telephone and electricity cables: Electricity 
travels through miles of buried cable from power 
stations to houses, stores, and offices.
» 2. Fiberoptic cable: These cables use light to 
move information and energy around the city. 
Services like the Internet and television are 
connected using fiberoptic cables. 
» 3. Water mains: Water mains are pipes that 
bring clean water to buildings such as houses. The 
water in the pipe is put under pressure to keep it 
moving fast around the network.
» 4. Gas pipes: Natural gas is used for cooking and 
heating. It is transported underground using metal 
pipes specially engineered for safety.  
» 5. Water drain: Drainage systems are designed 
by engineers to prevent flooding as well as to 
circulate water from our toilets and sinks. 
» 6. Underground transportation: It is much 
faster to take a subway than to drive! Underground 
train systems use deep tunnels under cities to 
transport millions of people without getting stuck 
in traffic.
» 7. Sewer system: Do you ever wonder where 
your waste goes when you flush the toilet? Gravity 
makes the water flow downward to a treatment 
facility, where it can be cleaned and reused. 
» 8. Deep water mains: A city’s water supply often 
comes from underground rocks filled with water, 
called an aquifer. This is connected to the deep 
water mains then sent to smaller, local water pipes.
» 9. Geothermal heating: In some places with hot 
rocks near the surface, such as Iceland, engineers 
can pump water down into the Earth’s crust to heat 
it up. The water turns into steam, which is then 
used in power plants to create electricity.
Waste pipe
Sewage pipes take 
away waste from our 
toilets so the water 
can be cleaned.

Eiffel Tower
Standing over Paris, the Eiffel 
Tower is one of the world’s greatest 
engineering achievements. Built in 
1889, it was the tallest structure in 
the world for four decades. More 
than 250 million people have 
visited the tower. 
44
Viewing platform 
A staggering 906 ft (276 m) 
above the ground is a viewing 
platform. From here, visitors 
can enjoy breathtaking views of 
Paris and its other landmarks, 
such as the Arc de Triomphe.
Ironwork
This wrought-iron 
structure in a lattice 
design weighs about 
11,000 tons (10,000 
metric tons). Every 
seven years the 
ironwork is coated in 
55 tons (50 metric tons) 
of paint to prevent rust.
Elevators
The top level is 
accessed by two 
elevators. The 
distance covered 
by the elevators 
going up and down 
every year is the same 
as traveling around the 
world twice!

Construction
The Eiffel Tower was 
designed to be a temporary 
entrance for the World’s Fair 
in 1889, but it soon became 
permanent. Deep concrete 
and limestone foundations 
were laid first before the 
structure got underway.

Creator
The tower is named after 
engineer Gustave Eiffel whose 
company ran the project. Eiffel 
also helped design the Statue of 
Liberty in New York.
Building up
More than 300 builders worked for 
over two years on the project. A 
major part was to make the rivets 
that hold the pieces together.

Guards, screens, and moving 
creeper cranes helped support 
the structure and keep it safe

Skyscrapers
A skyscraper is a very tall building 
with lots of floors. Skyscrapers 
are so big that they have become 
landmarks all over the world. 
These magnificent engineering 
structures take a long time to 
build, and a lot of careful planning 
to make sure everything is safe. 
Cranes
Skyscrapers would not  
be able to be built without 
cranes. These machines are 
very tall and are used to lift 
and transport materials. 
Elevator shaft
In most skyscrapers, the 
elevator shaft is built first. 
The elevator shaft is the 
building’s core. It helps keep 
the building stable and safe.
Super structure
Skyscrapers are built 
in a giant 3D grid. 
This is called a  
super structure.  
It is like the 
building’s skeleton.
Beautiful 
building
Many skyscrapers are 
designed with curves, 
twists, and patterns 
to make them stand 
out from the rest. The 
Shard, in London, was 
designed to look like 
lots of shards of glass 
poking into the sky.

Curtain wall
The curtain wall  
covers the outside  
of the building. It is 
connected to the steel 
grid inside.
Steel
Skyscrapers are made 
of steel. Steel is strong 
and light, which makes 
it perfect for tall 
buildings. If the metal 
was too heavy, the 
building wouldn’t be 
able to support itself.
Under the Shard
A long way down
The Shard sits on top of 
many huge layers of 
concrete. These layers 
support the skyscraper's 
weight, and go down  
174 ft (53 m).
Foundations
A foundation keeps the building  
stable, and protects it against wind  
and earthquakes. Skyscrapers have 
foundations made from concrete  
that go deep into the ground.

Building 
bridges
A bridge is a structure that lets 
people cross water, canyons, 
roads, or railroads. Bridges often 
support heavy weights. They  
can be very long, and have to  
face challenges including wind,  
rain, and heavy traffic. When 
engineers design a bridge, they 
must make sure all the pieces fit 
together and balance properly. 
Arch
Arch bridges were first engineered by the 
Ancient Romans. The arch of the bridge runs 
between two towers. The towers are where 
most of the weight is supported. Many arch 
bridges are used to carry railroad lines.  
TRUSS 
A truss bridge is created by fitting pieces of 
steel or wood together into triangle shapes 
called trusses. These carry the weight of the 
bridge. Trusses are very strong because each 
point of each triangle supports weight.
Beam
A beam bridge is the simplest kind of bridge.  
It is a strong, metal plank with legs that go 
deep into the water or ground. A beam bridge 
is stiff, and does not bend or twist when a 
heavy vehicle crosses it. 
A bascule bridge has a section that can be 
raised or lowered to allow ships to pass 
through it. Bascule bridges have been  
used since ancient times—for example,  
as castle drawbridges. 

49
Cantilever 
A cantilever is a structure that is only supported at  
one end. A cantilever bridge is lots of these structures put 
together to make a crossing. They 
are easier to build than other 
bridges because they don’t need 
to be supported when they are 
being put together.
Suspension
The road part of a suspension bridge hangs 
from two tall towers. The tall towers are 
secured deep under the water or ground 
below, which keeps them strong. Long steel 
cables connect the towers and the bridge. 
A cable-stayed bridge has one or more towers. 
From this tower, lots of support cables stretch 
to the bridge below. The cables fan out from 
the top of the tower to balance the weight  
of the bridge.
The Golden Gate 
Bridge in San 
Francisco, CA, 
weighs 887,000 
tons (804,673 
metric tons).

Meet the expert
We put some questions to Dr. Lucy Rogers,  
a Chartered Engineer, writer, and maker from  
the UK. Dr. Rogers writes, experiments, makes 
engineering videos, and appears on engineering 
television shows. 
Q: We know it is something to  
do with engineering, but what is your 
actual job?
A: I solve problems. Sometimes I calculate 
the probability of spacecraft being hit by 
space debris. Sometimes I make robot 
dinosaurs at a theme park react to visitors. 
I write articles for the European Space 
Agency, national newspapers, and 
magazines. I work with engineering 
companies and make how-to videos. I am 
also a judge on BBC Robot Wars.
Q: What made you decide to become  
an engineer?
A: At school I really enjoyed making things. 
We had a “Great Egg Race” club, where we 
would have to solve problems. I also liked 
math and physics, so engineering was ideal.
Q: Do you have a favorite thing that you 
have built?
A: My latest project is often my favorite—
currently my light-up gold boots. Anyone can 
change the color of the lights by tweeting 
“#Cheerlights” and their favorite color of  
the rainbow.
Dr. Rogers’ latest project—light-up gold boots
Dr. Rogers enjoys working on experiments

51
Q: Do you use any special 
equipment?
A: My hands and imagination are 
the tools I value most. To make 
things, I use tools such as a lathe 
for shaping wood or metal, a 
welder for sticking metal together, 
and a 3D printer for making small 
plastic items. I also use a 
computer. This helps me draw 
things, calculate things, write 
stuff, and also ask the Internet  
for help. The Maker Community 
(people all around the world who 
make things) are also always 
willing to help and share ideas. 
Q: What do you love most 
about engineering?
A: The buzz I get when I solve a problem for 
someone or something. Although most of my 
projects are fun, they demonstrate useful 
ideas. These ideas can be used in industry or 
in the home. For example, my gold boots 
could be 100 machines in a factory that need 
to be controlled or checked all at once. This 
could be done not just from the factory, but 
even from another country.
Q: What is a usual work day for you?
A: I don’t have a “usual” day—especially if I 
am on site, visiting factories, filming, or at a 
conference. Other times, I work from 
home—I don’t have to be in an office. I like  
to get up early and do some writing before 
breakfast. This could be preparing a speech, 
writing a report, or writing part of a book. 
After lunch I usually go into my workshop 
and make things. I spend a lot of the day 
keeping my eye on Twitter and my emails, 
too—this is how I talk to potential, 
current, and past colleagues and clients.
Q: What are the best and worst things 
about your job?
A: The best thing is learning new stuff 
every day. I use my skills to make things 
and solve problems. The worst thing is 
being a beginner at new stuff every day—I 
want to skip the “learning” bit and 
immediately become an expert. Sadly, I 
have found no short cuts.

Bioengineering
Bioengineers work on changes to the natural 
world. They research how our bodies work to 
create new medicines, and design inventions 
called prosthetics to replace missing body 
parts. Some bioengineers investigate farming 
and food technology.

$330,000 (£267,500) to create! 
The meat has the right texture 
but doesn’t taste very good yet.
Mechanical hand
Biomechanics is the science of how 
our bodies perform. Engineers can 
create mechanical body parts that are 
able to move and hold objects. They 
have also built running blades for 
athletes with missing feet or legs.
Mechanical parts 
can replace hands 
lost in accidents.
This meat was made 
from stem cells from a 
cow’s shoulder.
The Ancient 
Egyptians made  
the first prosthetic 
—a wooden toe.

Artificial heart
Bioengineers are working 
to create an entire artificial 
heart that can beat like a 
real one. This is a huge 
challenge—the human 
heart beats around 35 
million times a year so a 
replacement heart must be 
very strong and reliable.
Food technology
Genetic engineers are creating animals 
and plants that are more nutritious to eat 
and can fight back against disease and 
pests. Helping farmers grow more food  
on the same amount of land could help 
end hunger around the world.
Some parts of the 
heart can already 
be replaced by 
surgeons.
Cloned cows
Researchers from Texas 
have cloned cows that 
make more, better-quality 
meat than average cows. 
Clones are identical copies 
of animals.
This calf was born 
to cloned parents.

Fresh Kills landfill site, Staten Island, New York
Landfill repair
This site was once where 
all of the garbage from  
New York was dumped. It 
has now been cleaned up 
and specially engineered 
into a big park. Trees have 
been planted and lakes 
created to make the area 
more attractive, healthier,  
and safer.
Water straws
A company in Switzerland has made a 
drinking straw that makes dirty water 
clean enough to drink. The straw has 
tiny fibers inside, which trap dirt, 
letting only clean water through. The 
straw is used by people who live in or 
explore areas without clean water.
Going green
Engineers come up with ideas that will help the  
planet and our natural environment. They find new 
and creative ways to get rid of waste and save energy. 
Engineers also work on making new products that  
do not damage the world around us. 
The LifeStraw lets 
you drink dirty 
water safely.

New forest in China
Wind farm in Australia
Food cooking in a solar oven
Solar ovens
The heat of the Sun is so powerful it can be used to 
cook food. Silver-colored reflectors can be used to 
focus the Sun’s rays on a particular spot. It takes a long 
time to cook anything using this method, but it’s better 
for the environment than using gas or electricity.
Planting trees
In China, engineers 
have created a 
natural barrier 
against damaging 
dust storms. This 
“Great Wall” of trees is 
being planted on 
land that was once 
used to grow crops. 
Powerful wind turbines
Each wind turbine can power around 750 
homes. Wind power is a form of renewable 
energy, or energy that can be used again, 
which doesn’t harm the environment.

Solar roadway
Space houses 
Space engineers have 
created designs for houses 
that could one day allow people 
to live on Mars. These designs 
are still being tested. 
3D printing
This process takes a 
computer design and 
turns it into a 3D object. 
The object is made by 
printing lots of layers on 
top of each other, using 
materials like plastic.
 
 
This road surface 
works like a solar panel. It 
collects energy from the 
Sun that can be turned into 
electricity without harming 
the environment.
