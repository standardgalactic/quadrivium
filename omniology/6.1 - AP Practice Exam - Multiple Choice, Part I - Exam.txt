careful to fill in only the ovals that are preceded by numbers 1 through 60 on your 
answer sheet. 
General Instructions 
DO NOT OPEN THIS BOOKLET UNTIL YOU ARE INSTRUCTED TO DO SO. 
INDICATE ALL YOUR ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS IN SECTION I ON THE SEPARATE 
ANSWER SHEET. No credit will be given for anything written in this examination booklet, 
but you may use the booklet for notes or scratchwork. After you have decided which of the 
suggested answers is best, COMPLETELY fill in the corresponding oval on the answer sheet. 
Give only one answer to each question. If you change an answer, be sure that the previous 
mark is erased completely.

Sample Answer 
~0~~~ 
Many candidates wonder whether or not to guess the answers to questions about which they 
are not certain. In this section of the examination, as a correction for haphazard guessing, 
one-fourth of the number of questions you answer incorrectly will be subtracted from the 
number of questions you answer correctly. It is improbable, therefore, that mere guessing will 
improve your score significantly; it may even lower your score, and it does take time. If, 
however, you are not sure of the correct answer but have some knowledge of the question 
and are able to eliminate one or more answer choices as wrong, your chance of getting the 
right answer is improved, and it may be to your advantage to answer such a question. 
Use your time effectively, working as rapidly as you can without losing accuracy. Do not 
spend too much time on questions that are too difficult. Go on to other questions and come 
back to the difficult ones later if you have time. It is not expected that everyone will be able 
to answer all the multiple-choice questions.

n SECTION II: FREE-RESPONSE 
Report of the Chief Faculty Consultant 
Rae Jean Goodman 
This process provides reasonable 
assurance 
that impor- 
tant topic areas will be covered, questions will offer 
sufficient direction without being overly prescriptive, 
and few free-response 
questions will “not work” when 
United States Naval Academy 
administered to the AP candidates. 
The Development of Free-Response 
Questions - 
The first step in developing the free-response 
section 
of an AP Microeconomics Exam is taken two years 
before the exam is administered, 
when committee mem- 
bers discuss the topic areas that have been covered in 
the recent past exams and decide which topic areas 
should be covered in the exam under construction. 
Each member selects questions for consideration by 
the whole committee. 
From the proposed questions, in conjunction with 
the focus topic areas, the committee selects free- 
response questions for use in the AP Exam. The com- 
mittee members discuss what information and eco- 
nomic analysis are important for a student to know for 
each particular question. The questions are then 
rewritten to conform to the consensus 
of the committee. 
In preparation for the next committee meeting, each 
member prepares answers to the free-response 
ques- 
tions. The committee as a whole discusses 
these answers 
and rewrites portions of a question if necessary. 
At this 
point, if there is consensus 
that a question is ‘fjust not 
working,” the committee will seek a replacement ques- 
tion. The revised questions are put through the same 
process at the next committee meeting; further adjust- 
ments and refinements are made at this time. 
The free-response 
questions are answered and dis- 
cussed at two more meetings of the committee; it is 
then that the committee forms possible grading stan- 
dards. The questions are then administered in May to 
AP candidates. As an example, the time line for the 
free-response questions of the 1997 AP Microeco- 
nomics Exam is:

Setting and Maintaining Standards 
The development of the standards and procedures to 
ensure consistent 
grading of the free-response 
sections 
of AP Examinations is vital to the success of the AP 
Program and acceptance 
of AP scores by colleges and 
universities. The goal of the process is to have all 
faculty consultants evaluate the students’ responses 
fairly, uniformly, and according to the standards. 
Prior to the June Reading, the chief faculty consult- 
ant uses the AP Economics Development Committee’s 
input and samples of actual student responses 
to draft 
grading standards and point allocation for each free- 
response 
question. 
?Lvo days before the Reading begins, 
the chief faculty consultant, table leaders, and consult- 
ants from Educational Testing Service meet at the 
Reading site. The table leaders review a set of sample 
student answers that they have received and develop 
ideas about the scoring standards to apply to those 
answers. 
The table leaders for the microeconomics 
questions, 
along with the chief faculty consultant and ETS con- 
sultant, review and revise the preliminary standards 
and point allocation. The standards 
are then applied to 
a sample of actual student answers. Scores are then 
assigned, by consensus, 
to these answers. This set of 
scoring standards 
will be used to train faculty consult- 
ants in evaluating student responses. 
The chief faculty consultant, microeconomics and 
macroeconomics 
table leaders, and ETS consultants 
meet to discuss and review the scoring standards 
for all 
AP Economics free-response questions. In general, 
the final wording of the scoring standards 
is completed 
at this time. 
Following an introductory meeting, the Reading 
begins with a training session for all faculty consult- 
ants. Here, they learn to consistently apply a single set 
of scoring standards to each question. The faculty 
consultants are divided into groups of five to eight 
among table leaders. The table leader provides each 
faculty consultant with a set of student responses 
and 
the scoring standard for the question which will be 
read by the particular table; several tables may score a 
single question. 

The table leader and faculty consultants 
discuss the 
question and the correct answer to the question. The 
scoring standard 
is explained and discussed, 
after which 
the faculty consultants 
apply the standard to the set of 
sample student responses. 
Scores for the samples are 
then compared and discussed. 
At this point, the faculty 
consultants are learning the various levels of student 
ability which are reflected in the answers and the range 
of nuances consistent with each score. 
The next step in the process is a “round robin”: each 
faculty consultant is given an exam; everyone scores 
each exam; the scores are discussed and compared; 
and a consensus 
is reached. If there is more than one 
table scoring a question, the round robin is performed 
across the table to ensure that all faculty consultants 
scoring a particular question are applying the same 
standard. The goal is a consistent and reliable applica- 
tion of the standards. 
The original training is reinforced and checked in 
three ways. First, at the beginning of the second day of 
the Reading, a round-robin check is performed for 
each question. This confirms that all the faculty con- 
sultants have retained the scoring standard training. 
Throughout the remainder of the Reading, at a rate of 
once a day, two additional types of checks are carried 
out: a self-check and a table-leader check. In a self- 
check, each faculty consultant is asked to restore a set 
of between three and five selected papers that he or 
she has previously scored, without seeing the original 
scores. When differences occur, the faculty consultant 
reconsiders the final score in consultation with the 
table leader. A table-leader check involves the table 
leader restoring exams already scored by faculty con- 
sultants at the table. Once again, when discrepancies 
occur, the table leader and faculty consultant confer. 
Many times these discussions 
expand to include all the 
faculty consultants 
at the table and the occasion is used 
as a learning experience. 
Throughout the training and the Reading, the fac- 
ulty consultants 
are reminded of several guiding prin- 
ciples. They are encouraged 
to use the full range of the 
scoring scale. They are reminded that the highest score 
should be applied to excellent, not necessarily 
perfect, 
responses. 
Faculty consultants 
are trained to discuss a 
problematic student response with either other con- 
sultants at the table or the table leader. 
As in all AP scoring procedures, 
the faculty consult- 
ant does not know the name of the student nor his or 
her scores for other questions on the exam. A faculty 
consultant evaluates only one question on a particular 
student’s exam. All of these measures are designed 
to provide fair and consistent scoring of a student’s 
responses. 
The Reading 
In June of 1995, 37 secondary school, college and 
university economics teachers met at Trenton State 
College in Trenton, New Jersey, to read and evaluate 
over 9,700 responses 
written by AP Microeconomics 
candidates. The faculty consultants are experienced 
economics instructors of either undergraduate 
intro- 
ductory economics courses or of AP courses in sec- 
ondary schools. Approximately 10 percent of them 
were new to the AP Reading in 1995. The faculty 
consultants reflect the different geographic regions, 
types of institutions, and racial and ethnic groups of 
the candidates 
and institutions which participate in the 
AP Program. 
The microeconomics faculty consultants were 
divided into three groups, each assigned to read one 
of the three essays. The largest number, nineteen, were 
allotted to read the long micro question; nine were 
allocated to read Question 2, and nine were assigned to 
Question 3. The aim of the chief faculty consultant is 
to distribute the faculty consultants 
in the correct pro- 
portion so that any one reader scores only one question 
throughout the Reading. If this objective is met, the 
reliability of the evaluation should be maintained 
because consensus on the reading standards will be 
reached among fewer people, and the Reading will be 
more efficient because time will not be taken to retrain 
faculty consultants 
to score a second question. 
General Comments 
This is the third year of the three-question 
format for 
the AP Microeconornics 
Examination. 
There was agree- 
ment that the questions were generally of high quality 
and difficulty, but at the same time were fair and 
addressed content that is fundamental to micro- 
economics principles courses in universities and col- 
leges nationwide; the procedures for evaluation were 
well developed and carefully implemented. The ques- 
tions focused on relevant subjects and required basic 
microeconomic analysis. The long question involved 
firm and market analysis for a perfectly competitive 
market in long-run equilibrium; the second question 
used supply and demand analysis to examine the effects 
of a tax on a product with negative externalities, and 

the implications for economic efficiency; and the third 
question focused on monopoly and perfect competi- 
tion models and their relationships. 
On this year’s AP Microeconomics 
Exam, as well as 
in previous years, students experienced difficulty with 
the monopoly model of the firm, with explaining why 
the marginal revenue curve lies below the demand 
curve, and with the relationship between product price 
and the marginal revenue product curve for a factor 
input. Although the number of students able to demon- 
strate an understanding of the monopoly model has 
increased over the seven years of the AP Microeco- 
nomics Exam, the monopoly model still needs to be 
reinforced. Students should understand 
that the reason 
that the marginal revenue curve under monopoly dif- 
fers from the marginal revenue curve under perfect 
competition is due to the fact that if the monopolist 
wants to sell an additional unit, the price on that unit 
and all previous units must decline. A second area of 
difficulty for students is the relationship between the 
product market and the factor input market. The effect 
of a product price change on the marginal revenue 
product curve is not grasped by a large number of 
students taking the AP Microeconomics Exam. The 
reason for the shift in the demand for an input in 
response to a change in product price is due to the 
change in the marginal revenue product curve. If the 
demand for the product decreases 
resulting in a decrease 
in product price, the marginal revenue product curve 
for an input, say labor, will shift to the left. There are 
consequences 
for the equilibrium wage rate and level 
of employment. 
Graphical analysis is an important tool for econo- 
mists and thus the better answers usually use graphs to 
supplement the verbal analysis. Through 1995, graphi- 
cal analysis was not required in the AP Microeconomics 
Exam, although in the scoring process, graphs could 
help a student. If a student graphically demonstrated 
correct knowledge which was not discussed in the 
verbal presentation, 
the student received credit. Begin- 
ning in 1996, graphical analysis may be required on 
the AP Microeconomics Exam. 
The sample student responses 
that follow are repro- 
duced in their original format, unedited for grammar, 
spelling or punctuation. All are used with the permis- 
sion of the students, 
who understood 
that their responses 
might be published at a later date. When reading these 
responses, 
keep in mind that they were written under 
exam conditions and within a time constraint.

Question 1 Scoring Guide 
Basically, the point distribution is 3 points for Part (a); 
2 for Part (b); 2 for Part (c), and 2 for Part (d). 
Part (a): 3 points 
The technological breakthrough which reduces the 
costs of producing peaches lowers the average total 
cost curve and the marginal cost curve, resulting in a 
greater output at the same price. The reduction in 
average costs, the increase in Joyce’s production, and 
the price remaining constant combine to increase short- 
run profits. 
Points: 
1 - An explanation that costs have decreased, shifting 
the MC cost curve and resulting in a new profit- 
maximizing higher level of output. 
1 - Price remains constant because of perfect compe- 
tition. Thus, Joyce cannot affect the market price. 
1 - The student must show convincingly that short- 
run profits increase. One of the following explana- 
tions is acceptable: 
l 
Price is constant and costs decrease. 
l 
Costs have decreased while total revenue has 
increased due to constant price and increased 
output. 
l 
If the student has indicated above that the price 
has decreased, then the student must argue that 
average costs decrease more than the price 
decreases (or equivalent) to get an increase in 
Joyce’s profits. 
Part (b): 2 points 
The new technology spreads to the entire peach indus- 
try resulting in a rightward shift of the industry supply 
curve. Price decreases and quantity increases. 
Points: 
l- 
l- 
For indicating that the industry supply curve shifts 
to the right; graphically or verbally. 
For equilibrium price and quantity effects. A % 
point for price decrease and a % point for quantity 
increase. 
Part (c): 2 points 
Given that peaches and nectarines are substitutes, a 
decrease in the price of peaches results in a decrease in 
the demand for nectarines. A leftward shift in the 
demand curve for nectarines results in a decrease in 
the equilibrium price and quantity. 
Points: 
1 - A decrease in demand resulting from the price 
decrease in peaches and the fact that peaches and 
nectarines are substitutes. The reason must be 
given. 
% -Decrease in nectarine equilibrium price. 
l/2 -Decrea s e i n nectarine equilibrium quantity. 
Part (d): 2 points 
The decrease in the price of nectarines results in MRP, 
declining, or a leftward shift of the labor demand 
curve. The result is a decrease in wages and in the 
number of laborers hired. Must link product price 
decline to the decrease in demand for labor. (The use 
of the term “derived demand,” or indicating that prod- 
uct Q decreases => need for labor decreases, is 
inadequate.) 
Points: 
1 - Leftward shift in demand curve due to decrease in 
MRP, or, possibly, VMP,; the student must link 
the price change in the product market to the 
demand change in the labor market. 
‘%-Wager 
t 
a e declines. 
% -Quantity of labor hired decreases. 
After the faculty consultant has finished allocating 
the points, the answer is looked at as a whole and 
ultimately judged by its overall quality. This is espe- 
cially true if the score includes a % point. A score of 8 
or 9 should reflect an excellent answer; 6 and 7, a good 
answer; 4 and 5, an adequate answer; 3, a seriously 
deficient answer, but still an answer; 2, answers that 
are lots of words signifying nothing except one sus- 
tained relevant argument; 1, a correct, relevant-to-the- 
question statement; 0, no relevant economic answer to 
the question. Using the holistic approach, the 1 or 2 is 
a “bottom up” approach. 
Overall Comment on Question 1 
This question deals with changes to variable costs in a 
perfectly competitive market, the interaction between 
market changes and complementary goods, and the 
interaction of factor market changes with product mar- 
ket changes. The students appear to understand the 
basic supply and demand model very well and can 
explain the interaction between the market changes of 
complementary goods. This question discriminates well 
among the higher level students by requiring students 
to recognize the difference between firm and market 
analyses, and recognize explicitly that the decrease in 
the product price reduces the marginal revenue prod- 
uct for labor.

Comment: Excellent paper. The student clearly shows the change in the marginal cost (MC) and average total cost 
(ATC) curves for Part (a), while simultaneously recognizing that the industry was in long-run equilibrium 
(minimum point on ATC curve) and that the marginal revenue to Joyce does not change because the peach industry 
is perfectly competitive. In Part (b), the effects on the industry of the new technology are discussed 
and presented 
graphically. The effect of price changes on substitutes 
is captured well in the discussion and analysis of Part (c). 
The entire argument of how a change in product price translates 
into the labor market is concisely stated in Part (d). 
This essay is an excellent example of the use of graphical analysis to support the written work and of clear, concise 
analysis.

Comment: Excellent paper. The student presents the analysis for Parts (a) - (c) succinctly, with some additional 
information that the industry would return to a new long-run equilibrium at a larger quantity and lower price. The 
student loses a point in Part (d) because the argument that the shift in demand for nectarine workers is due to a 
decrease in the marginal revenue product of labor is not presented. 
Student Response 3 (score of 7)

Comment: This essay is an excellent example of the brevity possible when presenting economic analysis. The 
student does not include an average total cost (ATC) curve in the firm analysis and hence does not correctly identify 
the impact on Joyce’s profits of the new technology. Parts (b) and (c) cover the main points of the answer. In 
Part (d), the correct argument for the decrease in demand for labor is the reduction in the marginal revenue product 
due to the decrease 
in nectarine prices. The student does not present the correct explanation although the wage and 
employment results are correct. 

Studeiat Response 4 (score of 6) 

P 
9, I 

Comment: The student does not distinguish between firm analysis and industry analysis. In Part (a), the student 
should be using firm analysis to discuss the effects of the new technology on the costs, revenue and profit of Joyce. 
Instead, the student uses supply and demand analysis. The student does recognize that the firm is a price-taker and, 
hence, that Joyce’s product price does not change while the new technology allows an increase in output. Part (a) 
earns one point. For Parts (b) and (c), the student correctly utilizes supply and demand analysis and presents very 
cogent arguments to arrive at the results; the essay earns four points for these two parts. In Part (d), the student 
shows the correct shift in labor demand and identifies changes in wage rate and employment, but does not link the 
decrease in demand for nectarine workers to the impact of changes in the price of nectarines on the marginal 
revenue product of nectarine workers. The essay earns one point in Part (d).

Comment: This essay earns no points in Part (a). The student uses supply and demand analysis to answer a question 
which relates to firm analysis; he or she does not appear to apply the assumptions 
that the peach industry is 
perfectly competitive and is operating in long-run equilibrium. The student arrives at the answers through incorrect 
analysis. Examples of incorrect analysis are the statement that the price of peaches declines with only Joyce having 
the new technology, and the assertion that because Joyce is selling more peaches at a lower cost, the short-run 
profits must be positive. Parts (b) and (c) earn full credit. The student earns only one point in Part (d) because the 
marginal revenue product argument is not given. This essay represents a typical or representative 
answer by 
students who know some microeconomics 
(supply and demand analysis) but do not have a sufficient grasp of the 
theory of the firm to be able to apply the theory. 

Student Response 6 (score of 4) 

Comment: This student misses all the points in Part (a) because supply and demand analysis is used instead of firm 
analysis, and incorrect results are obtained. In Part (b), the student shifts the supply curve, correctly concludes that 
price decreases 
and quantity increases, 
and earns two points. In Part (c), the student appears to ignore the statement 
that nectarines and peaches are substitutes. 
The student earns one point for the decrease in price and quantity of 
nectarines. The second point is not awarded because the student does not provide a complete explanation. The 
student earns only one point in Part (d) because the marginal revenue product argument is not given, but the wage 
and employment results are correct. 

Student Response 7 (score of 3) 

Comments: 
This essay indicates a lack of knowledge of theory of the firm and confuses price and cost in Part (a). 
The essay earns no points in Part (a). The essay earns full credit in Part (b) by indicating the price and quantity 
effect of the new technology on the industry as a whole and the accompanying 
explanation of the shift in the supply 
curve. Part (c) involves a series of statements indicating little economic knowledge. The student earns only one 
point in Part (d) because the marginal revenue product argument is not given. 
Student Response 8 (score of 2) 

Comment: This student misses all of Part (a) due to faulty use of supply and demand analysis. The student receives 
a ‘% point in Part (b) for recognizing that industry output increases after a decline in costs. The student makes a 
classic error by confusing an increase in the quantity demanded with an increase in demand (shift in the curve). An 
additional % point is earned in Part (c) for recognizing that the quantity of nectarines will decrease. In Part (c), the 
student underscores his or her lack of knowledge of the difference between a movement along the curve versus a 
shift in the curve. The student earns only one point in Part (d) because the marginal revenue product argument is not 
given.

Comment: This essay is an example of a series of statements 
signifying little economic knowledge. The essay earns 
one point in Part (d) by correctly stating that the wage rate of nectarine workers would decrease and the 
employment of nectarine workers would decrease. 
The essay demonstrates 
the application of the holistic approach

Free-Response Question 2 
GOOD X 
2. Production of good X imposes costs on people who are neither producers nor consumers of good X. 
(a) A senator proposes a per unit sales tax on good X. Explain how this tax will affect each of the following. 
(i) The price paid by consumers 
(ii) The quantity of good X produced 
(iii) The total after-tax revenues received by producers of good X 
(b) Explain how imposing this tax might result in greater economic efficiency than would be achieved in an 
unregulated competitive market. 
Question 2 Scoring Guide 
Basically the point distribution is 3 points for Part (a); 
2 for Part (b). 
Part (a): 3 points 
Supply curve shifts to the left (the vertical distance is 
the amount of the tax) or supply decreases. The price 
paid by the consumer increases and the equilibrium 
quantity decreases. The total after-tax revenues received 
by the producers of the goods decrease because the 
price received by the producers (equilibrium quantity 
intersects original supply curve) is less and so is the 
quantity produced. 
Points: 
1 - Supply curve shifts leftward. If supply and demand 
are both shifted, the student does not receive the 
point. [If the demand curve shifts to the left, the 
student must give the correct analysis to receive 
full credit . ] 
l/2 -Price paid by the consumer increases. 
l/z - Quantity decreases. 
‘% -The stude n t must recognize that there is a decrease 
in after-tax revenues. 
I/ -The student must link the decrease in revenues to 
the decrease in price received by producers, and 
the decrease in quantity. 
Part (b): 2 points 
The original price does not capture all of the social 
costs due to the negative externalities and hence it is 
inefficient. With the imposition of the tax, at least 
some of the social costs are captured in the costs to the 
firm. Thus, the post-tax equilibrium is more efficient 
than the pre-tax equilibrium. 
Points: 
The following is a discussion of the points given for 
alternative answers; the points are not additive. 
‘/ - 
The student discusses productive efficiency rather 
than allocative efficiency. The typical argument 
is that the tax forces the firm to search for ways 
of reducing production costs to protect or restore 
the pre-tax profit position. 
The student recognizes allocative inefficiency by 
using the language in the question (i.e., “imposes 
costs on people who are neither producers nor 
consumers”), but doesn’t explain how and why 
the tax impacts inefficiency. 
‘h - 

l- 
1% 
2- 
- 
The student goes beyond the answer immediately 
above by using other terminology (e.g., negative 
externalities, spillover costs, msc>msb, etc.), but 
still doesn’t explore the impacts of the tax. 
The student explains that the tax leads to a reduc- 
tion in output, and that this in turn promotes 
economic efficiency by reducing the costs borne 
by people who are neither producers nor con- 
sumers of this good. 
The student explains that, by reducing the output 
after the imposition of the tax, the marginal pri- 
vate costs are approaching the marginal social 
costs, or marginal social costs are closer to mar- 
ginal social benefits, etc. 
After the faculty consultant has finished allocating 
the points, the answer is looked at as a whole and 
ultimately judged by its overall quality. This is espe- 
cially true if the total score includes a % point. 5 should 
reflect an excellent answer; 4 an excellent answer with 
a flaw; 3 a good answer; 2 an adequate answer; 1 a 
seriously deficient answer, but still an answer; 0 all else. 
Overall Comment on Question 2 
Question 2 tests the understanding of the effects on a 
product market of the implementation of a per-unit 
tax, the interaction between these effects and a firm’s 
revenue, and the use of a tax on a good with negative 
externalities. This question uses supply and demand 
analysis, a fundamental analytical tool in economics. 
The question tested well with a good distribution of 
grades across the spectrum. Frequently, students 
answered last year’s question of a cigarette tax and the 
effect of different demand elasticities on tax revenue 
instead of this year’s question. Consistent with prior 
experience, the economic efficiency question proved 
to be difficult for students; many confused productive 
efficiency with allocative efficiency. 
Sample Student Responses 
Student Response 1 (score of 5) 

Comment: This is an excellent answer in terms of content, brevity and use of graphical analysis. The student shows 
and explains that the supply curve shifts upward by the amount of the per-unit tax. The equilibrium price increases 
and the equilibrium quantity decreases. 
The decline in revenue is identified and illustrated clearly with the student 
indicating that the decline in revenue is due to the decrease 
in output and the decrease 
in the price to the producers 
(p,). 
Finally, the student correctly describes 
the marginal private costs as distinct from the marginal social costs, and pro- 
vides the efficient point of operation where price is equal to the marginal social costs. This student clearly explains 
how the tax-induced decrease in output leads to economic efficiency where price equals marginal social cost. 
Student Response 2 (score of 4) 


Comment: The answer is good, particularly in Part (a). This student earns all three points in Part (a) by showing that 
the implementation of the tax shifts the supply curve to the left, by clearly specifying that the price to the consumer 
increases and the quantity decreases, 
and by delineating graphically as well as verbally that the after-tax revenue 
has declined due to the decrease in output and the decrease in the price received by the producer. The graphical 
analysis supports and elaborates 
on the written work. Only one of the two points in Part (b) is earned. This answer 
recognizes that the pre-tax situation is inefficient because of a negative externality. However, no correct explana- 
tion is provided of how the tax promotes efficiency. The discussion 
seems to relate to productive efficiency which 
is not affected by the per-unit tax. 
Student Response 3 (score of 3) 

Comment: This answer is adequate. In Part (a), the essay clearly indicates that the supply curve shifts to the left due 
to the tax, and the shift results in an increase in equilibrium price and a decrease in equilibrium quantity. However, 
the effect on the producers’ after-tax revenue is incorrect. The student is confused and enters into a discussion of 
government tax revenue and the elasticity of the demand curve. Quite probably, the student is confusing the 1995 
question with the 1994 question of taxing cigarettes. In Part (b), the student earns one point for recognizing that 
negative externalities are causing economic inefficiency. The student does not explain how the tax will increase 
efficiency. 
Student Response 4 (score of 2) 
Comment: This student receives 1% points in Part (a) for correctly identifying the changes in price, quantity, and 
total revenue. There is no indication that the student realizes that the supply curve has shifted to the left, nor is there 
a correct explanation for the decrease in total after-tax revenues. The final % point in Part (b) is earned for 
attributing the initial inefficiency to costs imposed on people who are neither producers nor consumers of good X. 

Student Response 5 (score of 1) 
Comment: This answer indicates little knowledge of economic principles. The student incorrectly shifts both 
supply and demand. This is a clear indication that he or she does not understand the difference between a shift in 
the curve and a movement along the curve. The student does see that the supply curve would shift but does not 
realize that this results in a decrease in quantity demanded, not a decrease in demand. Still, a full point is earned in 
Part (a) for correctly identifying the changes in quantity and total revenue. The answer provided for Part (b) is 
nonsense economics and earns no credit. 

Free-Response Question 3 
3. (a) Identify the relationship between price and marginal revenue and explain why this relationship exists for each 
of the following. 
(i) A perfectly competitive firm 
(ii) Monopoly 
(b) A firm’s market power is sometimes measured by using the following formula 
(P-MC) 
P 
where P is price and MC is marginal cost at the profit-maximizing output level. Some economists 
claim the 
larger the value of the index, the greater the firm’s market power. 
(i) Explain why this index is always positive for an imperfectly competitive market. 
(ii) Using the formula, calctilate the market power of any perfectly competitive firm. 
Question 3 Scoring Guide 
Basically the point distribution is 3 points for Part (a); 
2 points for Part (b). 
Part (a): 3 points 
Marginal revenue, the additional revenue from selling 
one more unit, equals the price under perfect competi- 
tion because the firm is a price-taker; the constant 
price is determined in the market and the firm is such a 
small part of the market that it cannot affect the price. 
Marginal revenue is less than the price in monopoly 
because the MR curve lies below the demand curve. 
MRcP because the monopolist must reduce the price 
to sell an additional unit of output, but the price must 
be reduced on all units of output. In a monopoly, 
the profit-maximizing level of output is set where 
MR=MC; the price for that level of output is read 
off the demand curve. 
Points: 
% -Assertion th at p rice equals MR (P=MR) for per- 
fect competition. 
1 - Explanation for perfect competition relationship 
between price and MR. Price-taker or horizontal 
demand is a ‘/z point; a more complete use of the 
marginal revenue concept is needed for the other 
l/2 point. 
l/2 -Assertion that price is greater than MR (P>MR) 
for monopoly. 
1 - Monopolist explanation: A downward sloping 
demand curve receives a % point. The explanation 
that the firm must decrease 
price on all units, or on 
all previous units in order to sell additional units is 
needed for the other % point. 
Part (b): 2 points 
The profit-maximizing output is determined where 
MR=MC and since MR<P as in Part (a), it follows that 
MCcP => numerator is positive for the monopolist. 
Since P=MR in perfect competition, the profit- 
maximizing point MR=MC => P = MC => the index is 
zero for perfect competition. 
Points: 
1 - Recognition that profit-maximizing output occurs 
where MR=MC. (This statement may be found 
anywhere in the answer.) 
l/2 -P>MC => index is p ositive for imperfectly com- 
petitive markets. 
*% -P=MC => index is zero for perfect competition. 
After the faculty consultant has finished allocating 
the points, the answer may be looked at as a whole and 
ultimately judged by its overall quality. This is espe- 
cially true if there is a % point in the total score. 5 
should reflect an excellent answer; 4, an excellent 
answer with a flaw; 3, a good answer; 2, an adequate 
answer; 1, a seriously deficient answer, but still an 
answer; 0, all else. 
Overall Comment on Question 3 
The third microeconomics question focusses on the 
relationship between price, marginal revenue and mar- 
ginal cost for a profit-maximizing monopolist and a 
profit-maximizing firm operating under perfect com- 
petition. The explanation for why a marginal revenue 
curve is not the demand curve for a monopolist contin- 
ues to pose a problem for students as a similar question 
did in 1994. However, Part (b), using the market power 
index, did not appear to be difficult for the students. 

Faculty consultants thought that the question was a 
good discriminator. The ability to articulate why mar- 
ginal revenue was not equal to demand separates the 
student who memorizes information from the student 
who understands the material. Further, students who 
understand the basic monopoly and perfect competi- 
tion models could score well on this question.

Comment: This is an excellent answer, although not perfect. The explanation for the relationship between marginal 
revenue and price for the firm operating under perfect competition is succinct and complete. Likewise, the 
discussion for monopoly demonstrates the relationship between price and marginal revenue and provides the 
correct explanation for the marginal revenue being less than price. Although not relevant to the question, the 
student asserts that the monopoly earns an economic profit; this is true in the diagram presented but is not 
necessarily true for all monopolies. In Part (b), the student clearly recognizes that under all market structures the 
profit-maximizing point is MR=MC, and that under monopoly P>MR. By integrating these two pieces of 
information, the student correctly demonstrates that for firms operating in an imperfectly competitive market, the 
index is positive, and that in a perfectly competitive market, the index is zero.

Comment: This is a good answer. In the frost part, the relationship between price and marginal revenue is clearly 
stated for both perfectly and imperfectly competitive markets, and the explanation for the perfectly competitive 
market is given. However, no explanation is provided as to why the marginal revenue curve lies below the demand 
curve under imperfectly competitive situations. In Part (b), the value of the index for a perfectly competitive firm 
is stated and explained. The faculty consultant had to integrate what the student has said in Part (a) and in Part (b) 
for the imperfectly competitive model to arrive at the student’s conclusion of a positive index.

Comment: This is an adequate answer. The diagrams for the perfectly competitive firm and the monopolist, 
showing the correct relationship between price and marginal revenue, earn two points. There is not an explanation 
and, hence, full credit is not earned in Part (a). Note that the graphical presentation helped the student earn points. 
The answer only receives partial credit in Part (b) for the assertion of the value of the index for each market 
structure. There is no recognition that the profit-maximizing output occurs at the point where marginal revenue 
equals marginal cost.

Comment: This answer receives a ‘/2 point for the assertion that P = MR for perfect competition and a ‘/z point for 
the assertion that P > MR for monopoly. No explanation for the relationships 
is provided; explanations 
are required 
for full credit. The student earns a % point for asserting that the index will be positive for imperfectly competitive 
markets and a ‘% point for stating that the index is zero for firms under perfect competition. There is no recognition 
that the profit-maximizing output occurs at the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.

Student Response 5 (score of 1) 
Comment: The student does not attempt to answer Part (a). In Part (b), the student earns a % point for the statement 
that the index will be positive because price is greater than marginal cost for imperfectly competitive market, and 
a % point for the statement that the index equals zero under perfect competition because the price equals marginal 
cost. In both cases, the student does not explain why these relationships 
hold. The student does not explain that 
profit maximization occurs at the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost for all firms.
