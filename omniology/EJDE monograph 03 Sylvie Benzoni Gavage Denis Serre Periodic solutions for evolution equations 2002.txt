Abstract
We study the existence and uniqueness of periodic solutions for evolu-
tion equations. First we analyze the one-dimensional case. Then for arbi-
trary dimensions (ﬁnite or not), we consider linear symmetric operators.
We also prove the same results for non-linear sub-diﬀerential operators
A = ∂ϕ where ϕ is convex.

Introduction
Many theoretical and numerical studies in applied mathematics focus on perma-
nent regimes for ordinary or partial diﬀerential equations. The main purpose of
this paper is to establish existence and uniqueness results for periodic solutions
in the general framework of evolution equations,
x′(t) + Ax(t) = f(t),
t ∈R,

Periodic solutions for evolution equations
by using the penalization method.
Note that in the linear case a necessary
condition for the existence is
⟨f⟩:= 1
T
Z T
0
f(t)dt ∈Range(A).
(2)
Unfortunately, this condition is not always suﬃcient for existence; see the exam-
ple of the orthogonal rotation of R2. Nevertheless, the condition (2) is suﬃcient
in the symmetric case. The key point consists of considering ﬁrst the perturbed
equation
αxα(t) + x′
α(t) + Axα(t) = f(t),
t ∈R,
where α > 0. By using the Banach’s ﬁxed point theorem we deduce the existence
and uniqueness of the periodic solutions xα, α > 0. Under the assumption (2),
in the linear symmetric case we show that (xα)α>0 is a Cauchy sequence in C1.
Then by passing to the limit for α →0 it follows that the limit function is a
periodic solution for (1).
These results have been announced in [2]. The same approach applies for
the study of almost periodic solutions (see [3]). Results concerning this topic
have been obtained previously by other authors using diﬀerent methods.
A
similar condition (2) has been investigated in [5] when studying the range of
sums of monotone operators.
A diﬀerent method consists of applying ﬁxed
point techniques, see for example [4, 7].
This article is organized as follows. First we analyze the one dimensional
case. Necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of pe-
riodic solutions are shown. Results for sub(super)-periodic solutions are proved
as well in this case. In the next section we show that the same existence result
holds for linear symmetric maximal monotone operators on Hilbert spaces. In
the last section the case of non-linear sub-diﬀerential operators is considered.

Periodic solutions for one dimensional evolu-
tion equations
To study the periodic solutions for evolution equations it is convenient to con-
sider ﬁrst the one dimensional case
x′(t) + g(x(t)) = f(t),
t ∈R,
(3)
where g : R →R is increasing Lipschitz continuous in x and f : R →R is
T-periodic and continuous in t. By Picard’s theorem it follows that for each
initial data x(0) = x0 ∈R there is an unique solution x ∈C1(R; R) for (3). We
are looking for T-periodic solutions. Let us start by the uniqueness study.
2.1
Uniqueness
Proposition 2.1 Assume that g is strictly increasing and f is periodic. Then
there is at most one periodic solution for (3).

Proof
Let x1, x2 be two periodic solutions for (3). By taking the diﬀerence
between the two equations and multiplying by x1(t) −x2(t) we get
1
2
d
dt|x1(t) −x2(t)|2 + [g(x1(t)) −g(x2(t))][x1(t) −x2(t)] = 0,
t ∈R.
(4)
Since g is increasing we have (g(x1) −g(x2))(x1 −x2) ≥0 for all x1, x2 ∈R and
therefore we deduce that |x1(t)−x2(t)| is decreasing. Moreover as x1 and x2 are
periodic it follows that |x1(t) −x2(t)| does not depend on t ∈R and therefore,
from (4) we get
[g(x1(t)) −g(x2(t))][x1(t) −x2(t)] = 0,
t ∈R.
Finally, the strictly monotony of g implies that x1 = x2.
Remark 2.2 If g is only increasing, it is possible that (3) has several periodic
solutions. Let us consider the function
g(x) =



x + ε
x < −ε,
0
x ∈[−ε, ε],
x −ε
x > ε,
(5)
and f(t) = ε
2 cos t. We can easily check that xλ(t) = λ + ε
2 sin t are periodic
solutions for (3) for λ ∈[−ε
2, ε
2].
Generally we can prove that every two periodic solutions diﬀer by a constant.
Proposition 2.3 Let g be an increasing function and x1, x2 two periodic solu-
tions of (3). Then there is a constant C ∈R such that
x1(t) −x2(t) = C,
∀t ∈R.
Proof
As shown before there is a constant C ∈R such that |x1(t)−x2(t)| = C,
t ∈R. Moreover x1(t) −x2(t) has constant sign, otherwise x1(t0) = x2(t0) for
some t0 ∈R and it follows that |x1(t) −x2(t)| = |x1(t0) −x2(t0)| = 0, t ∈R or
x1 = x2. Finally we ﬁnd that
x1(t) −x2(t) = sign(x1(0) −x2(0))C,
t ∈R.
Before analyzing in detail the uniqueness for increasing functions, let us deﬁne
the following sets.
O(y) =
 
x ∈R : x +
R t
0(f(s) −y)ds ∈g−1(y) ∀t ∈R
	
⊂g−1(y),
y ∈g(R),
∅,
y /∈g(R).
Proposition 2.4 Let g be an increasing function and f periodic. Then equation
(3) has diﬀerent periodic solutions if and only if Int(O⟨f⟩) ̸= ∅.

Periodic solutions for evolution equations
Proof
Assume that (3) has two periodic solutions x1 ̸= x2. By the previous
proposition we have x2 −x1 = C > 0. By integration on [0, T] one gets
Z T
0
g(x1(t))dt =
Z T
0
f(t)dt =
Z T
0
g(x2(t))dt.
(6)
Since g is increasing we have g(x1(t)) ≤g(x2(t)),
t ∈R and therefore,
Z T
0
g(x1(t))dt ≤
Z T
0
g(x2(t))dt.
(7)
From (6) and (7) we deduce that g(x1(t)) = g(x2(t)), t ∈R and thus g is
constant on each interval [x1(t), x2(t)] = [x1(t), x1(t) + C], t ∈R. Finally it
implies that g is constant on Range(x1) + [0, C] = {x1(t) + y : t ∈[0, T], y ∈
[0, C]} and this constant is exactly the time average of f:
g(x1(t)) = g(x2(t)) = ⟨f⟩,
t ∈[0, T].
Let x be an arbitrary real number in ]x1(0), x1(0) + C[. Then
x +
Z t
0
{f(s) −⟨f⟩}ds
=
x −x1(0) + x1(0) +
Z t
0
{f(s) −g(x1(s))}ds
=
x −x1(0) + x1(t)
>
x1(t),
t ∈R.
Similarly,
x +
Z t
0
{f(s) −⟨f⟩}ds
=
x −x2(0) + x2(0) +
Z t
0
{f(s) −g(x2(s))}ds
=
x −x2(0) + x2(t)
<
x2(t),
t ∈R.
Therefore, x+
R t
0{f(s)−⟨f⟩}ds ∈]x1(t), x2(t)[⊂g−1(⟨f⟩),
t ∈R which implies
that x ∈O⟨f⟩and hence ]x1(0), x2(0)[⊂O⟨f⟩.
Conversely, suppose that there is x and C > 0 small enough such that x, x+C ∈
O⟨f⟩. It is easy to check that x1, x2 given below are diﬀerent periodic solutions
for (3):
x1(t) = x +
Z t
0
{f(s) −⟨f⟩}ds,
t ∈R,
x2(t) = x + C +
Z t
0
{f(s) −⟨f⟩}ds = x1(t) + C,
t ∈R.
Remark 2.5 The condition Int(O⟨f⟩) ̸= ∅is equivalent to
diam(g−1⟨f⟩) > diam(Range
Z
{f(t) −⟨f⟩}dt).

Example:
Consider the equation x′(t) + g(x(t)) = η cos t, t ∈R with g given
in Remark 2.2. We have < η cos t >= 0 ∈g(R) and
O(0)
=
{x ∈R | x +
Z t
0
η cos s ds ∈g−1(0),
t ∈R}
(8)
=
{x ∈R : x + η sin t ∈g−1(0),
t ∈R}
=
{x ∈R : −ε ≤x + η sin t ≤ε, t ∈R}
=



∅
|η| > ε,
{0}
|η| = ε,
[|η| −ε, ε −|η|]
|η| < ε.
(9)
Therefore, uniqueness does not occur if |η| < ε, for example if η = ε/2, as seen
before in Remark 2.2. If |η| ≥ε there is an unique periodic solution.
In the following we suppose that g is increasing and we establish an existence
result.
2.2
Existence
To study the existence, note that a necessary condition is given by the following
proposition.
Proposition 2.6 Assume that equation (3) has T-periodic solutions.
Then
there is x0 ∈R such that ⟨f⟩:= 1
T
R T
0 f(t)dt = g(x0).
Proof
Integrating on a period interval [0, T] we obtain
x(T) −x(0) +
Z T
0
g(x(t))dt =
Z T
0
f(t)dt.
Since x is periodic and g ◦x is continuous we get
Tg(x(τ)) =
Z T
0
f(t)dt,
τ ∈]0, T[,
and hence
⟨f⟩:= 1
T
Z T
0
f(t)dt ∈Range(g).
(10)
♦
In the following we will show that this condition is also suﬃcient for the
existence of periodic solutions. We will prove this result in several steps. First
we establish the existence for the equation
αxα(t) + x′
α(t) + g(xα(t)) = f(t),
t ∈R,
α > 0.
(11)
Proposition 2.7 Suppose that g is increasing Lipschitz continuous and f is
T-periodic and continuous. Then for every α > 0 the equation (11) has exactly
one periodic solution.

Periodic solutions for evolution equations
Remark 2.8 Before starting the proof let us observe that (11) reduces to an
equation of type (3) with gα = α1R + g. Since g is increasing, is clear that gα
is strictly increasing and by the Proposition 2.1 we deduce that the uniqueness
holds. Moreover since Range(gα) = R, the necessary condition (10) is trivially
veriﬁed and therefore, in this case we can expect to prove existence.
Proof
First of all remark that the existence of periodic solutions reduces to
ﬁnding x0 ∈R such that the solution of the evolution problem
αxα(t) + x′
α(t) + g(xα(t)) = f(t),
t ∈[0, T],
x(0) = x0,
(12)
veriﬁes x(T ; 0, x0) = x0.
Here we denote by x(· ; 0, x0) the solution of (12)
(existence and uniqueness assured by Picard’s theorem). We deﬁne the map
S : R →R given by
S(x0) = x(T ; 0, x0),
x0 ∈R.
(13)
We demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of the periodic solution of (12)
by showing that the Banach’s ﬁxed point theorem applies.
Let us consider
two solutions of (12) corresponding to the initial datas x1
0 and x2
0. Using the
monotony of g we can write
α|x(t ; 0, x1
0) −x(t ; 0, x2
0)|2 + 1
2
d
dt|x(t ; 0, x1
0) −x(t ; 0, x2
0)|2 ≤0,
which implies
1
2
d
dt{e2αt|x(t ; 0, x1
0) −x(t ; 0, x2
0)|2} ≤0,
and therefore,
|S(x1
0) −S(x2
0)| = |x(T ; 0, x1
0) −x(T ; 0, x2
0)| ≤e−αT |x1
0 −x2
0|.
For α > 0 S is a contraction and the Banach’s ﬁxed point theorem applies.
Therefore S(x0) = x0 for an unique x0 ∈R and hence x(· ; 0, x0) is a periodic
solution of (3).
♦
Naturally, in the following proposition we inquire about the convergence of
(xα)α>0 to a periodic solution of (3) as α →0. In view of the Proposition 2.6
this convergence does not hold if (10) is not veriﬁed. Assume for the moment
that (3) has at least one periodic solution. In this case convergence holds.
Proposition 2.9 If equation (3) has at least one periodic solution, then (xα)α>0
is convergent in C0(R; R) and the limit is also a periodic solution of (3).
Proof
Denote by x a periodic solution of (3). By elementary calculations we
ﬁnd
α|xα(t) −x(t)|2 + 1

d
dt|xα(t) −x(t)|2 ≤−αx(t)(xα(t) −x(t)),

which can be also written as

2
d
dt{e2αt|xα(t) −x(t)|2} ≤αeαt|x(t)| · eαt|xα(t) −x(t)|,
t ∈R.
(18)
Therefore, by integration on [0, t] we deduce
1
2{eαt|xα(t) −x(t)|}2 ≤1
2|xα(0) −x(0)|2 +
Z t
0
αeαs|x(s)| · eαs|xα(s) −x(s)|ds.
(19)
Using Bellman’s lemma, formula (19) gives
eαt|xα(t) −x(t)| ≤|xα(0) −x(0)| +
Z t
0
αeαs|x(s)|ds,
t ∈R.
(20)
Let us consider α > 0 ﬁxed for the moment. Since x is periodic and continuous,
it is also bounded and therefore from (20) we get
|xα(t) −x(t)| ≤e−αt|xα(0) −x(0)| + (1 −e−αt)∥x∥L∞(R),
t ∈R.
(21)
By periodicity we have
|xα(t) −x(t)|
=
|xα(nT + t) −x(nT + t)|
≤
e−α(nT +t)|xα(0) −x(0)| + (1 −e−α(nT +t))∥x∥L∞(R)
≤
e−α(nT +t)|xα(0) −x(0)| + ∥x∥L∞(R),
t ∈R, n ≥0.
By passing to the limit as n →∞, we deduce that (xα)α>0 is uniformly bounded
in L∞(R):
|xα(t)| ≤|xα(t) −x(t)| + |x(t)| ≤2∥x∥L∞(R),
t ∈R, α > 0.
The derivatives x′
α are also uniformly bounded in L∞(R) for α →0:
|x′
α(t)|
=
|f(t) −αxα(t) −g(xα(t))|
≤
∥f∥L∞(R) + 2α∥x∥L∞(R) + max{g(2∥x∥L∞(R)), −g(−2∥x∥L∞(R))}.
The uniform convergence of (xα)α>0 follows now from the Arzela-Ascoli’s the-
orem. Denote by u the limit of (xα)α>0 as α →0. Obviously u is also periodic
u(0) = lim
α→0 xα(0) = lim
α→0 xα(T) = u(T).
To prove that u veriﬁes (3), we write
xα(t) = xα(0) +
Z t
0
{f(s) −g(xα(s)) −αxα(s)}ds,
t ∈R.
Since the convergence is uniform, by passing to the limit for α →0 we obtain
u(t) = u(0) +
Z t
0
{f(s) −g(u(s))}ds,

8
Periodic solutions for evolution equations
and hence u ∈C1(R; R) and
u′(t) + g(u(t)) = f(t),
t ∈R.
From the previous proposition we conclude that the existence of periodic solu-
tions for (3) reduces to uniform estimates in L∞(R) for (xα)α>0.
Proposition 2.10 Assume that g is increasing Lipschitz continuous and f is
T-periodic and continuous. Then the following statements are equivalent:
(i) equation (3) has periodic solutions;
(ii) the sequence (xα)α>0 is uniformly bounded in L∞(R). Moreover, in this
case (xα)α>0 is convergent in C0(R; R) and the limit is a periodic solution for
(3).
Note that generally we can not estimate (xα)α>0 uniformly in L∞(R). In-
deed, by standard computations we obtain
α(xα(t) −u)2 + 1

d
dt(xα(t) −u)2 ≤|f(t) −αu −g(u)| · |xα(t) −u|,

Integration on [t, t + h], we get

2e2α(t+h)(xα(t + h) −u)2

e2αs|f(s) −αu −g(u)| · |xα(s) −u|ds

Now by using Bellman’s lemma we deduce
|xα(t+h)−u| ≤e−αh|xα(t)−u|+
Z t+h
t
e−α(t+h−s)|f(s)−αu−g(u)|ds,
t < t+h.
Since xα is T-periodic, by taking h = T we can write

1 −e−αT

Theorem 2.11 Assume that g is increasing Lipschitz continuous, and f is T-
periodic and continuous. Then equation (3) has periodic solutions if and only
if ⟨f⟩:=
1
T
R T
0 f(t)dt ∈Range(g) (there is x0 ∈R such that ⟨f⟩= g(x0)).
Moreover in this case we have the estimate
∥x∥L∞(R) ≤|x0| +
Z T
0
|f(t) −⟨f⟩|dt,
∀x0 ∈g−1⟨f⟩,
and the solution is unique if and only if Int(O⟨f⟩) = ∅or
diam(g−1⟨f⟩) ≤diam(Range
Z
{f(t) −⟨f⟩}dt).
Proof
The condition is necessary (see Proposition 2.6). We will prove now
that it is also suﬃcient.
Let us consider the sequence of periodic solutions
(xα)α>0 of (11). Accordingly to the Proposition 2.10 we need to prove uniform
estimates in L∞(R) for (xα)α>0. Since xα is T-periodic by integration on [0, T]
we get
Z T
0
{αxα(t) + g(xα(t))}dt = T⟨f⟩,
α > 0.
Using the average formula for continuous functions we have
Z T
0
{αxα(t) + g(xα(t))}dt = T{αxα(tα) + g(xα(tα))},
tα ∈]0, T[, α > 0.
By the hypothesis there is x0 ∈R such that ⟨f⟩= g(x0) and thus
αxα(tα) + g(xα(tα)) = g(x0),
α > 0.
(22)
Since g is increasing, we deduce
αxα(tα)[x0 −xα(tα)] = [g(x0) −g(xα(tα))][x0 −xα(tα)] ≥0,
α > 0,
and thus
|xα(tα)|2 ≤xα(tα)x0 ≤|xα(tα)||x0|.
Finally we deduce that xα(tα) is uniformly bounded in R:
|xα(tα)| ≤|x0|,
∀α > 0.
Now we can easily ﬁnd uniform estimates in L∞(R) for (xα)α>0. Let us take in
the previous calculus u = xα(tα)and integrate on [tα, t]:
1
2e2αt(xα(t)−xα(tα))2 ≤
Z t
tα
e2αs|f(s)−αxα(tα)−g(xα(tα))|·|xα(s)−xα(tα)|ds.
By using Bellman’s lemma we get
|xα(t) −xα(tα)| ≤
Z t
tα
e−α(t−s)|f(s) −αxα(tα) −g(xα(tα))|ds,
t > tα,

and hence by (22) we deduce

≤

=

(23)
Now by passing to the limit in (23) we get
|x(t)| ≤|x0| +

|f(t) −⟨f⟩|dt,
t ∈R, ∀x0 ∈g−1⟨f⟩.
2.3
Sub(super)-periodic solutions
In this part we generalize the previous existence results for sub(super)-periodic
solutions. We will see that similar results hold. Let us introduce the concept of
sub(super)-periodic solutions.
Deﬁnition 2.12 We say that x ∈C1([0, T]; R) is a sub-periodic solution for
(3) if
x′(t) + g(x(t)) = f(t),
t ∈[0, T],
and x(0) ≤x(T).
Note that a necessary condition for the existence is given next.
Proposition 2.13 If equation (3) has sub-periodic solutions, then there is x0 ∈
R such that g(x0) ≤⟨f⟩.
Proof
Let x be a sub-periodic solution of (3). By integration on [0, T] we ﬁnd
x(T) −x(0) +
Z T
0
g(x(t))dt = T⟨f⟩.
Since g ◦x is continuous, there is τ ∈]0, T[ such that
g(x(τ)) = ⟨f⟩−1
T (x(T) −x(0)) ≤⟨f⟩.
Similarly we deﬁne the notion of super-periodic solution.
Deﬁnition 2.14 We say that y ∈C1([0, T]; R) is a super-periodic solution for
(3) if
y′(t) + g(y(t)) = f(t),
t[0, T],
and y(0) ≥y(T).
The analogous necessary condition holds.

Mihai Bostan

Proposition 2.15 If equation (3) has super-periodic solutions, then there is
y0 ∈R such that g(y0) ≥⟨f⟩.
Remark 2.16 It is clear that x is periodic solution for (3) if and only if is in
the same time sub-periodic and super-periodic solution. Therefore there are
x0, y0 ∈R such that
g(x0) ≤⟨f⟩≤g(y0).
Since g is continuous, we deduce that ⟨f⟩∈Range(g) which is exactly the
necessary condition given by the Proposition 2.6.
As before we will prove that the necessary condition of Proposition 2.13 is
also suﬃcient for the existence of sub-periodic solutions.
Theorem 2.17 Assume that g is increasing Lipschitz continuous and f is T-
periodic continuous. Then equation (3) has sub-periodic solutions if and only if
there is x0 ∈R such that g(x0) ≤⟨f⟩.
Proof
The condition is necessary (see Proposition 2.13). Let us prove now
that it is also suﬃcient. Consider z0 an arbitrary initial data and denote by
x : [0, ∞[→R the solution for (3) with the initial condition x(0) = z0. If there
is t0 ≥0 such that x(t0) ≤x(t0 + T), thus xt0(t) := x(t0 + t), t ∈[0, T] is a
sub-periodic solution. Suppose now that x(t) > x(t+T), ∀t ∈R. By integration
on [nT, (n + 1)T], n ≥0 we get

g(x(nT + t))dt = T⟨f⟩, n ≥0.
Using the hypothesis and the average formula we have
g(x(nT + τn)) = ⟨f⟩+ 1
T {x(nT) −x((n + 1)T)} > g(x0),
for τn ∈]0, T[ and n ≥0. Since g is increasing we deduce that x(nT + τn) >
x0, n ≥0. We have also x(nT + τn) ≤x((n −1)T + τn) ≤· · · ≤x(τn) ≤
supt∈[0,T ] |x(t)| and thus we deduce that (x(nT + τn))n≥0 is bounded:
|x(nT + τn)| ≤K,
n ≥0.
Consider now the functions xn : [0, T] →R given by
xn(t) = x(nT + t),
t ∈[0, T].

Therefore, the sequence (xn)n≥0 is uniformly bounded in L∞(R) and

|f(t) −g(0)|dt := M.
Moreover, (x′
n)n≥0 is also uniformly bounded in L∞(R). Indeed we have
|x′
n(t)| = |f(t) −g(xn(t))| ≤∥f∥L∞(R) + max{g(M), −g(−M)},
and hence, by Arzela-Ascoli’s theorem we deduce that (xn)n≥0 converges in
C0([0, T], R):
lim
n→∞xn(t) = u(t), uniformly for t ∈[0, T].
As usual, by passing to the limit for n →∞we ﬁnd that u is also solution for
(3). Moreover since (x(nT))n≥0 is decreasing and bounded, it is convergent and
we can prove that u is periodic:
u(0) = lim
n→∞xn(0) = lim
n→∞x(nT) = lim
n→∞x((n + 1)T) = lim
n→∞xn(T) = u(T).
Therefore, u is a sub-periodic solution for (3). An analogous result holds for
super-periodic solutions.
Proposition 2.18 Under the same assumptions as in Theorem 2.17 the equa-
tion (3) has super-periodic solutions if and only if there is y0 ∈R such that
g(y0) ≥⟨f⟩.
We state now a comparison result between sub-periodic and super-periodic
solutions.
Proposition 2.19 If g is increasing, x is a sub-periodic solution and y is a
super-periodic solution we have
x(t) ≤y(t),
∀t ∈[0, T],
provided that x and y are not both periodic.

Mihai Bostan
13
Proof
Both x and y verify (3), thus
(x −y)′(t) + g(x(t)) −g(y(t)) = 0,
t ∈[0, T].
With the notation
r(t) =
(
g(x(t))−g(y(t))
x(t)−y(t)
t ∈[0, T], x(t) ̸= y(t)
0
t ∈[0, T], x(t) = y(t),
(24)
we can write g(x(t)) −g(y(t)) = r(t)(x(t) −y(t)), t ∈[0, T] and therefore,
(x −y)′(t) + r(t)(x(t) −y(t)) = 0, t ∈[0, T]
which implies
x(t) −y(t) = (x(0) −y(0))e−
R t
0 r(s)ds.
(25)
Now it is clear that if x(0) ≤y(0) we also have x(t) ≤y(t), t ∈[0, T]. Suppose
now that x(0) > y(0). Taking t = T in (25) we obtain
x(T) −y(T) = (x(0) −y(0))e−
R T
0 r(t)dt.
(26)
Since g is increasing, by the deﬁnition of the function r we have r ≥0. Two
cases are possible: (i) either
R T
0 r(t)dt > 0, (ii) either
R T
0 r(t)dt = 0 in which
case r(t) = 0, t ∈[0, T] (r vanishes in all points of continuity t such that
x(t) ̸= y(t) and also in all points t with x(t) = y(t) by the deﬁnition). Let us
analyse the ﬁrst case (i). By (26) we deduce that x(T) −y(T) < x(0) −y(0) or
x(T) −x(0) < y(T) −y(0). Since x is sub-periodic we have x(0) ≤x(T) which
implies that y(T) > y(0) which is in contradiction with the super-periodicity of
y ( y(T) ≤y(0)).
In the second case (ii) we have g(x(t)) = g(y(t)), t ∈[0, T] so (x −y)′ = 0 and
therefore there is a constant C ∈R such that x(t) = y(t) + C, t ∈[0, T]. Taking
t = 0 and t = T we obtain
0 ≥x(0) −x(T) = y(0) −y(T) ≥0,
and thus x and y are both periodic which is in contradiction with the hypothesis.
In the following we will see how it is possible to retrieve the existence result for
periodic solutions by using the method of sub(super)-periodic solutions. Sup-
pose that ⟨f⟩∈Range(g). Obviously both suﬃcient conditions for existence of
sub(super)-periodic solutions are satisﬁed and thus there are x0(y0) sub(super)-
periodic solutions. If y0 is even periodic the proof is complete. Assume that y0
is not periodic (y0(0) > y0(T)). Denote by M the set of sub-periodic solutions
for (3):
M = {x : [0, T] →R : x sub-periodic solution ,
x0(t) ≤x(t), t ∈[0, T]}.
Since x0 ∈M we have M ̸= ∅. Moreover, from the comparison result since y0
is super-periodic but not periodic we have x ≤y0, ∀x ∈M. We prove that M
contains a maximal element in respect to the order:
x1 ≺x2 (if and only if) x1(t) ≤x2(t),
t ∈[0, T].

14
Periodic solutions for evolution equations
Finally we show that this maximal element is even a periodic solution for (3)
since otherwise it would be possible to construct a sub-periodic solution greater
than the maximal element. We state now the following generalization.
Theorem 2.20 Assume that g : R × R →R is increasing Lipschitz continuous
function in x, T-periodic and continuous in t and f : R →R is T-periodic and
continuous in t. Then the equation
x′(t) + g(t, x(t)) = f(t),
t ∈R,
(27)
has periodic solutions if and only if there is x0 ∈R such that
⟨f⟩:= 1
T
Z T
0
f(t)dt = 1
T
Z T
0
g(t, x0)dt = G(x0).
(28)
Moreover, in this case we have the estimate
∥x∥L∞(R) ≤|x0| +
Z T
0
|f(t) −g(t, x0)|dt,
∀x0 ∈G−1⟨f⟩.
Proof
Consider the average function G : R →R given by
G(x) = 1
T
Z T
0
g(t, x)dt, x ∈R.
It is easy to check that G is also increasing and Lipschitz continuous with the
same constant. Let us prove that the condition (28) is necessary. Suppose that
x is a periodic solution for (27). By integration on [0, T] we get
1
T
Z T
0
g(t, x(t))dt = ⟨f⟩.
(29)
We can write
m ≤x(t) ≤M, t ∈[0, T],
and thus
g(t, m) ≤g(t, x(t)) ≤g(t, M), t ∈[0, T],
which implies
G(m) = 1

g(t, m)dt ≤1
T
Z T

g(t, x(t))dt ≤1

Since G is continuous it follows that there is x0 ∈[m, M] such that G(x0) =
1
T
R T
0 g(t, x(t))dt and from (29) we deduce that ⟨f⟩= G(x0).
Let us show that the condition (28) is also suﬃcient. As before let us consider
the unique periodic solution for
αxα(t) + x′
α(t) + g(t, xα(t)) = f(t),
t ∈[0, T], α > 0,

Mihai Bostan
15
(existence and uniqueness follow by the Banach’s ﬁxed point theorem exactly as
before). All we need to prove is that (xα)α>0 is uniformly bounded in L∞(R)
(then (x′
α)α>0 is also uniformly bounded in L∞(R) and by Arzela-Ascoli’s the-
orem we deduce that xα converges to a periodic solution for (27)). Taking the
average on [0, T] we get
1
T
Z T
0
{αxα(t) + g(t, xα(t))}dt = ⟨f⟩= G(x0),
α > 0.
As before we can write
αmα + g(t, mα) ≤αxα(t) + g(t, xα(t)) ≤αMα + g(t, Mα),
t ∈[0, T], α > 0,
where
mα ≤xα(t) ≤Mα,
t ∈[0, T], α > 0,
and hence
αmα + G(mα) ≤1
T
Z T
0
{αxα(t) + g(t, xα(t))}dt ≤αMα + G(Mα),
α > 0.
Finally we get
G(x0) = 1
T
Z T
0
{αxα(t)+g(t, xα(t))}dt = αuα+G(uα),
uα ∈]mα, Mα[, α > 0.
(30)
Multiplying by uα −x0 we obtain
αuα(uα −x0) = −(G(x0) −G(uα))(x0 −uα),
α > 0.
Since G is increasing we deduce that |uα|2 ≤uαx0 ≤|uα|·|x0|, α > 0 and hence
(uα)α>0 is bounded:
|uα| ≤|x0|,
α > 0.
Now using (30) it follows
1
T
Z T
0
{αxα(t) + g(t, xα(t))}dt = 1
T
Z T
0
{αuα + g(t, uα)}dt,
and thus there is tα ∈]0, T[ such that
αxα(tα) + g(tα, xα(tα)) = αuα + g(tα, uα),
α > 0.
Since α(xα(tα) −uα)2 = −[g(tα, xα(tα)) −g(tα, uα)][xα(tα) −uα] ≤0 we ﬁnd
that xα(tα) = uα, α > 0 and thus (xα(tα))α>0 is also bounded
|xα(tα)| ≤|x0|,
α > 0.
Now by standard calculations we can write

dt|xα(t) −xα(tα)|2 + [g(t, xα(t)) −g(t, xα(tα))][xα(t) −xα(tα)]

t ∈R,

16

and thus
|xα(t) −xα(tα)| ≤
Z t
tα
|f(s) −αxα(tα) −g(s, xα(tα))|ds,
t > tα, α > 0,

Z T
0
|f(t) −αxα(tα) −g(t, xα(tα))|dt,
t ∈[0, T], α > 0. (31)
Since (xα(tα))α>0 is bounded we have
uα = xα(tα) →x1,
such that
G(x0) = lim
α→0{αuα + G(uα)} = G(x1).
Moreover, if x0 ≤x1 we have
0 ≤1
T
Z T
0
[g(t, x1) −g(t, x0)]dt = G(x1) −G(x0) = 0,
and hence g(t, x1) = g(t, x0) for all t ∈[0, T]. Obviously the same equalities
hold if x0 > x1. Now by passing to the limit in (31) we ﬁnd
|x(t)|
≤
|x0| +

|f(t) −g(t, x1)|dt
(32)
=

Z T

t ∈[0, T], ∀x0 ∈G−1⟨f⟩,
and therefore (xα)α>0 is uniformly bounded in L∞(R).

Periodic solutions for evolution equations on
Hilbert spaces
In this section we analyze the existence and uniqueness of periodic solutions for
general evolution equations on Hilbert spaces
x′(t) + Ax(t) = f(t),
t > 0,
(33)
where A : D(A) ⊂H →H is a maximal monotone operator on a Hilbert
space H and f ∈C1(R; H) is a T-periodic function. As known by the theory
of Hille-Yosida, for every initial data x0 ∈D(A) there is an unique solution
x ∈C1([0, +∞[; H) ∩C([0, +∞[ ; D(A)) for (33), see [6, p. 101]. Obviously,
the periodic problem reduces to ﬁnd x0 ∈D(A) such that x(T) = x0.
As
in the one dimensional case we demonstrate uniqueness for strictly monotone
operators. We state also necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence
in the linear symmetric case.
Finally the case of non-linear sub-diﬀerential
operators is considered. Let us start with the deﬁnition of periodic solutions for
(33).

Mihai Bostan
17
Deﬁnition 3.1 Let A : D(A) ⊂H →H be a maximal monotone operator
on a Hilbert space H and f ∈C1(R; H) a T-periodic function. We say that
x ∈C1([0, T]; H) ∩C([0, T]; D(A)) is a periodic solution for (33) if and only if
x′(t) + Ax(t) = f(t),
t ∈[0, T],
and x(0) = x(T).
3.1
Uniqueness
Generally the uniqueness does not hold (see the example in the following para-
graph). However it occurs under the hypothesis of strictly monotony.
Proposition 3.2 Assume that A is strictly monotone ((Ax1−Ax2, x1−x2) = 0
implies x1 = x2). Then (33) has at most one periodic solution.
Proof
Let x1, x2 be two diﬀerent periodic solutions. By taking the diﬀerence
of (33) and multiplying both sides by x1(t) −x2(t) we ﬁnd
1
2
d
dt∥x1(t) −x2(t)∥2 + (Ax1(t) −Ax2(t),
x1(t) −x2(t)) = 0,
t ∈[0, T].
By the monotony of A we deduce that ∥x1 −x2∥2 is decreasing and therefore
we have
∥x1(0) −x2(0)∥≥∥x1(t) −x2(t)∥≥∥x1(T) −x2(T)∥,
t ∈[0, T].
Since x1 and x2 are T-periodic we have
∥x1(0) −x2(0)∥= ∥x1(T) −x2(T)∥,
which implies that ∥x1(t) −x2(t)∥is constant for t ∈[0, T] and thus
(Ax1(t) −Ax2(t),
x1(t) −x2(t)) = 0,
t ∈[0, T].
Now uniqueness follows by the strictly monotony of A.
3.2
Existence
In this section we establish existence results. In the linear case we state the
following necessary condition.
Proposition 3.3 Let A : D(A) ⊂H →H be a linear maximal monotone
operator and f ∈L1(]0, T[; H) a T-periodic function. If (33) has T-periodic
solutions, then the following necessary condition holds.
⟨f⟩:= 1
T
Z T

f(t)dt ∈Range(A),
(there is x0 ∈D(A) such that ⟨f⟩= Ax0).

Periodic solutions for evolution equations

Suppose that x ∈C1([0, T]; H)∩C([0, T]; D(A)) is a T-periodic solution
for (33). Let us consider the divisions ∆n : 0 = tn

condition is not suﬃcient for the existence of periodic solutions. For example
let us analyse the periodic solutions x = (x1, x2) ∈C1([0, T]; R2) for
x′(t) + Ax(t) = f(t), t ∈[0, T],
(35)
where A : R2 →R2 is the orthogonal rotation:
A(x1, x2) = (−x2, x1), (x1, x2) ∈R2,

Mihai Bostan
19
and f = (f1, f2) ∈L1(]0, T[; R2) is T-periodic. For a given initial data x(0) =
x0 ∈R2 the solution writes
x(t) = e−tAx0 +
Z t
0
e−(t−s)Af(s)ds,
t > 0,
(36)
where the semigroup e−tA is given by
e−tA =
 cos t
sin t
−sin t
cos t

.
(37)
Since e−2πA = 1 we deduce that the equation (35) has 2π-periodic solutions if
and only if
Z 2π
0
etAf(t)dt = 0.
(38)
Thus if
R 2π
0 {f1(t) cos t −f2(t) sin t}dt ̸= 0 or
R 2π
0 {f1(t) sin t + f2(t) cos t}dt ̸= 0
equation (35) does not have any 2π-periodic solution and the necessary condition
still holds because Range(A) = R2.
Moreover if (38) is satisﬁed then every
solution of (35) is periodic and therefore uniqueness does not occur (the operator
A is not strictly monotone). Let us analyse now the existence. As in the one
dimensional case we have
Proposition 3.4 Suppose that A : D(A) ⊂H →H is maximal monotone and
f ∈C1(R; H) is T-periodic. Then for every α > 0 the equation
αx(t) + x′(t) + Ax(t) = f(t),
t ∈R,
(39)
has an unique T-periodic solution in C1(R; H) ∩C(R; D(A)).
Proof
Since α+A is strictly monotone the uniqueness follows from Proposition
3.2. Indeed,
α∥x −y∥2 + (Ax −Ay, x −y) = 0,
x, y ∈D(A),
implies α∥x −y∥2 = 0 and hence x = y.
Consider now an arbitrary initial data x0 ∈D(A). By the Hille-Yosida’s theo-
rem, there is x ∈C1([0, +∞[; H) ∩C([0, +∞[; D(A)) solution for (39). Denote
by (xn)n≥0 the functions
xn(t) = x(nT + t),
t ∈[0, T], n ≥0.
We have
αxn+1(t) + x′
n+1(t) + Axn+1(t) = f((n + 1)T + t),
t ∈[0, T],
and
αxn(t) + x′
n(t) + Axn(t) = f(nT + t),
t ∈[0, T].

20
Periodic solutions for evolution equations
Since f is T-periodic, after usual computations we get
α∥xn+1(t) −xn(t)∥2 + 1

d
dt∥xn+1(t) −xn(t)∥2
+(Axn+1(t) −Axn(t), xn+1(t) −xn(t))

t ∈[0, T].
Taking into account that A is monotone we deduce
∥xn+1(t) −xn(t)∥≤e−αt∥xn+1(0) −xn(0)∥,
t ∈[0, T],
and hence
∥xn+1(0) −xn(0)∥

Finally we get the estimate
∥xn+1(t) −xn(t)∥≤e−α(nT +t)∥Sα(T; 0, x0) −x0∥,
t ∈[0, T], n ≥0.
Here Sα(t; 0, x0) represents the solution of (39) for the initial data x0. From the
previous estimate it is clear that (xn)n≥0 is convergent in C0([0, T]; H):

Remark 3.5 The sequence (αxα)α>0 is uniformly bounded in L∞([0, T]; H).
Let us demonstrate that xα is T-periodic and solution for (39). Indeed,
xα(0) = lim
n→∞xn(0) = lim
n→∞xn−1(T) = xα(T).
Now let us show that (x′

taking the diﬀerence between the equations (39) at the moments t and t + h we
have
α(x(t+h)−x(t))+x′(t+h)−x′(t)+Ax(t+h)−Ax(t) = f(t+h)−f(t),

By using Bellman’s lemma we conclude that

+e−αt 1

(41)
By passing to the limit for h →0 the previous formula yields

≤
∥f(0) −αx0 −Ax0∥+ 1
α∥f ′∥L∞(]0,T [;H) < +∞.
Therefore (x′
n)n≥0 is uniformly bounded in L∞(]0, T[; H) since
∥x′
n∥L∞(]0,T [;H) = ∥x′(nT + (·))∥L∞(]0,T [;H) ≤∥x′∥L∞([0,+∞[;H),
and thus we have x′
n(t) ⇀yα(t), t ∈[0, T]. We can write
(xn(t), z) = (xn(0), z) +
Z t
0
(x′
n(s), z)ds,
z ∈H, t ∈[0, T], n ≥0,

22
Periodic solutions for evolution equations
and by passing to the limit for n →∞we deduce
(xα(t), z) = (xα(0), z) +
Z t
0
(yα(s), z)ds,
z ∈H, t ∈[0, T],
which is equivalent to
xα(t) = xα(0) +
Z t
0
yα(s)ds,
t ∈[0, T].
Therefore xα is diﬀerentiable and x′
α = yα. Finally we can write x′
n(t) ⇀x′
α(t),
t ∈[0, T]. Let us show that xα is also solution for (39). We have
[xn(t), f(t) −αxn(t) −x′
n(t)] ∈A,
n ≥0, t ∈[0, T].
Since xn(t) →xα(t), x′
n(t) ⇀x′
α(t) and A is maximal monotone we conclude
that
[xα(t), f(t) −x′
α(t)] ∈A,
t ∈[0, T], α > 0,
which means that xα(t) ∈D(A) and Axα(t) = f(t) −x′
α(t),
t ∈[0, T].
Now we establish for the linear case the similar result stated in Proposition
2.10. Before let us recall a standard result concerning maximal monotone oper-
ators on Hilbert spaces
Proposition 3.6 Assume that A is a maximal monotone operator (linear or
not) and αuα + Auα = f, uα ∈D(A), f ∈H, α > 0. Then the following
statements are equivalent:
(i) f ∈Range(A);
(ii) (uα)α>0 is bounded in H. Moreover, in this case (uα)α>0 is convergent in
H to the element of minimal norm in A−1f.
Proof
it (i) →(ii) By the hypothesis there is u ∈D(A) such that f = Au.
After multiplication by uα −u we get
α(uα, uα −u) + (Auα −Au, uα −u) = 0,
α > 0.
Taking into account that A is monotone we deduce
∥uα∥2 ≤(uα, u) ≤∥uα∥· ∥u∥,
α > 0,
and hence ∥uα∥≤∥u∥, α > 0, u ∈A−1f which implies that uα ⇀u0. We have
[uα, f −αuα] ∈A, α > 0 and since A is maximal monotone, by passing to the
limit for α →0 we deduce that [u0, f] ∈A, or u0 ∈A−1f. Moreover
∥u0∥= ∥w −lim
α→0 uα∥≤lim inf
α→0 ∥uα∥≤lim sup
α→0
∥uα∥≤∥u∥,
∀u ∈A−1f.
In particulat taking u = u0 ∈A−1f we get
∥w −lim
α→0 uα∥= lim
α→0 ∥uα∥,

and hence, since any Hilbert space is strictly convex, by Mazur’s theorem we
deduce that the convergence is strong
uα →u0 ∈A−1f,
α →0,
where ∥u0∥= infu∈A−1f ∥u∥= minu∈A−1f ∥u∥.
(ii) →(i) Conversely, suppose that (uα)α>0 is bounded in H. Therefore uα ⇀u
in H. We have [uα, f −αuα] ∈A, α > 0 and since A is maximal monotone
by passing to the limit for α →0 we deduce that [u, f] ∈A or u ∈D(A) and
f = Au.
Theorem 3.7 Assume that A : D(A) ⊂H →H is a linear maximal monotone
operator on a compact Hilbert space H and f ∈C1(R; H) is a T-periodic func-
tion. Then the following statements are equivalent:
(i) equation (33) has periodic solutions;
(ii) the sequence of periodic solutions for (39) is bounded in C1(R; H). Moreover
in this case (xα)α>0 is convergent in C0(R; H) and the limit is also a T-periodic
solution for (33).
Proof
(i) →(ii) Denote by x, xα the periodic solutions for (33) and (39). By
taking the diﬀerence and after multiplication by xα(t) −x(t) we get:
α∥xα(t)−x(t)∥2 + 1
2
d
dt∥xα(t)−x(t)∥2 ≤α∥x(t)∥·∥xα(t)−x(t)∥,
t ∈R. (42)
Finally, after integration and by using Bellman’s lemma, formula (42) yields
∥xα(t) −x(t)∥
≤
e−αt∥xα(0) −x(0)∥+
Z t
0
αe−α(t−s)∥x(s)∥ds
≤
e−αt∥xα(0) −x(0)∥+ (1 −e−αt)∥x∥L∞,
t ∈R.
Since xα and x are T-periodic we can also write
∥xα(t) −x(t)∥
=
∥xα(nT + t) −x(nT + t)∥
≤
e−α(nT +t)∥xα(0) −x(0)∥+ (1 −e−α(nT +t))∥x∥L∞.
By passing to the limit for n →∞we obtain
∥xα −x∥L∞≤∥x∥L∞,
α > 0,
and hence
∥xα∥L∞≤2∥x∥L∞,
α > 0.
Since A is linear we can write
α
h (xα(t + h) −xα(t)) + 1
h(x′
α(t + h) −x′
α(t)) + 1
hA(xα(t + h) −xα(t))
=
1
h(f(t + h) −f(t)),
t < t + h, α > 0,

24
Periodic solutions for evolution equations
and for t < t + h,
1
h(x′(t + h) −x′(t)) + 1
hA(x(t + h) −x(t)) = 1
h(f(t + h) −f(t)).
For every h > 0 denote by yα,h, yh and gh the periodic functions:
yα,h(t) = 1
h(xα(t + h) −xα(t)),
t ∈R, α > 0,
yh(t) = 1
h(x(t + h) −x(t)),
t ∈R,
gh(t) = 1
h(f(t + h) −f(t)),
t ∈R,
and hence we have
αyα,h(t) + y′
α,h(t) + Ayα,h(t) = gh(t),
t ∈R,
y′
h(t) + Ayh(t) = gh(t),
t ∈R.
By the same computations we get
∥yα,h(t) −yh(t)∥≤e−αt∥yα,h(0) −yh(0)∥+
Z t
0
αe−α(t−s)∥yh(s)∥ds.
Now by passing to the limit for h →0 we deduce
∥x′

≤
e−αt∥x′
α(0) −x′(0)∥+
Z t
0
αe−α(t−s)∥x′(s)∥ds
≤
e−αt∥x′
α(0) −x′(0)∥+ (1 −e−αt)∥x′∥L∞,
t ∈[0, T].
By the periodicity we obtain as before that
∥x′
α(t) −x′(t)∥
=
∥x′
α(nT + t) −x′(nT + t)∥
≤
e−α(nT +t)∥x′
α(0) −x′(0)∥+ (1 −e−α(nT +t))∥x′∥L∞,
and hence by passing to the limit for n →∞we conclude that
∥x′
α −x′∥L∞≤∥x′∥L∞,
α > 0.
Therefore, (x′
α)α>0 is also uniformly bounded in L∞
∥x′
α∥L∞≤2∥x′∥L∞,
α > 0.
Conversely, the implication (ii) →(i) follows by using Arzela-Ascoli’s theorem
and by passing to the limit for α →0 in (39).
Let us continue the analysis of the previous example. The semigroup asso-
ciated to the equation (39) is given by
e−t(α+A) = e−αte−tA = e−αt
 cos t,
sin t
−sin t,

t ∈R, α > 0,

and the periodic solution for equation (39) reads
xα(t)
=
(1 −e−T (α+A))−1
Z T

e−(T −s)(α+A)f(s)ds

Z t

e−(t−s)(α+A)f(s)ds,
t > 0, α > 0.
As we have seen, proving the existence of periodic solutions reduces to ﬁnding
uniform L∞(]0, T[; H) estimates for (xα)α>0 and (x′
α)α>0 . Since A is linear
bounded operator (∥A∥L(H;H) = 1) we have
∥x′
α∥L∞(]0,T [;H)
=
∥f −αxα −Axα∥L∞(]0,T [;H)
≤
∥f∥L∞(]0,T [;H) + (α + ∥A∥L(H;H))∥xα∥L∞(]0,T [;H), α > 0,
and hence in this case it is suﬃcient to ﬁnd only uniform L∞(]0, T[; H) estimates
for (xα)α>0 or uniform estimates for (xα(0))α>0 in H.
Case 1: T = 2nπ, n ≥0. We have

If
R T

In fact since
e−2nπA = 1 it is easy to check that equation (35) does not have any periodic
solution. If
R T
0 e−(T −s)Af(s)ds = 0 then every solution of (35) is T-periodic and
(xα(0))α>0 is convergent for α →0:

Periodic solutions for evolution equations
We state now our main result of existence in the linear and symmetric case.
Theorem 3.8 Assume that A : D(A) ⊂H →H is a linear maximal monotone
and symmetric operator and f ∈C1([0, T]; H) is a T-periodic function. Then
the necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of periodic solutions for
(33) is given by
⟨f⟩:= 1
T
Z T
0
f(t)dt ∈Range(A).
In this case we have the estimates:
∥x∥L∞(]0,T [;H) ≤∥A−1⟨f⟩∥+
√
T
2 ∥f∥L2(]0,T [;H) + T
2 ∥f ′∥L1(]0,T [;H),
and
∥x′∥L∞(]0,T [;H) ≤
1
√
T
∥f∥L2(]0,T [;H) + ∥f ′∥L1(]0,T [;H),
and the solution is unique up to a constant in A−1(0).
Proof
The condition is necessary (see Proposition 3.3). Let us show now that
it is also suﬃcient. Consider the T-periodic solutions (xα)α>0 for
αxα(t) + x′
α(t) + Axα(t) = f(t),
t ∈[0, T], α > 0.
First we prove that (xα)α>0 is uniformly bounded in C1([0, T]; H).
Let us
multiply by x′
α(t) and integrate on a period:
Z T
0
∥x′
α(t)∥2dt +
Z T
0
α(xα(t), x′
α(t)) + (Axα(t), x′
α(t))dt =
Z T
0
(f(t), x′
α(t))dt.
Since A is symmetric and xα is T-periodic we have
Z T

α(xα(t), x′
α(t)) + (Axα(t), x′
α(t))dt
=


α∥xα(t)∥2 + (Axα(t), xα(t))
	
|T

Finally we get
∥x′

L2(]0,T [;H) ≤(f, x′
α)L2(]0,T [;H) ≤∥f∥L2(]0,T [;H) · ∥x′
α∥L2(]0,T [;H),
and hence
∥x′
α∥L2(]0,T [;H) ≤∥f∥L2(]0,T [;H),
α > 0.
Therefore we can write
min
t∈[0,T ] ∥x′
α(t)∥≤

∥x′
α∥L2(]0,T [;H) ≤

As seen before, since A is linear we can write
α

h(x′
α(t + h) −x′
α(t))
+ 1
hA(xα(t + h) −xα(t))
=
1
h(f(t + h) −f(t)),
and by standard calculations for s < t and h > 0, we get
1
h∥xα(t + h) −xα(t)∥
≤
e−α(t−s) 1
h∥xα(s + h) −xα(s)∥+
Z t
s
e−α(t−τ) 1
h∥f(τ + h) −f(t)∥dτ .
Passing to the limit for h →0 we deduce

Z t

∥f ′(τ)∥dτ,
s ≤t, α > 0.
(44)
From (43) and (44) we conclude that the functions (x′
α)α>0 are uniformly
bounded in L∞(]0, T[; H):
∥x′
α∥L∞(]0,T [;H) ≤
1
√
T
∥f∥L2(]0,T [;H) + ∥f ′∥L1(]0,T [;H),
α > 0.
As shown before, since A is linear and xα is T-periodic we have also
α⟨xα⟩+ A⟨xα⟩= ⟨f⟩.
(45)
By the hypothesis there is x0 ∈D(A) such that ⟨f⟩= Ax0 and hence
∥⟨xα⟩∥= ∥(α + A)−1⟨f⟩∥= ∥(α + A)−1Ax0∥≤∥x0∥,
α > 0.
Now it is easy to check that (xα)α>0 is uniformly bounded in L∞(]0, T[; H):

Periodic solutions for evolution equations
Now we can prove that (xα)α>0 is convergent in C1([0, T]; H).
Indeed, by
taking the diﬀerence between the equations (39) written for α, β > 0, after
multiplication by x′
α(t) −x′
β(t) and integration on [0, T] we get
Z T
0
{α(xα(t) −xβ(t), x′
α(t) −x′

α(t) −x′
β(t))}dt
=
−(α −β)
Z T
0
(xβ(t), x′
α(t) −x′
β(t))dt.
Since A is symmetric, xα and xβ are T-periodic and uniformly bounded in
L∞(]0, T[; H) we deduce that
∥x′
α −x′
β∥L2(]0,T [;H) ≤|α −β| · sup
γ>0
∥xγ∥L2(]0,T [;H),
or
∥x′

·sup
γ>0
∥xγ∥L2(]0,T [;H) +|α−β|·sup
γ>0
∥x′
γ∥L1(]0,T [;H),
and therefore (x′
α)α>0 converges in C([0, T]; H).
We already know that (⟨xα⟩)α>0 = ((α + A)−1⟨f⟩)α>0 is bounded in H and
by the Proposition 3.6 it follows that (⟨xα⟩)α>0 is convergent to the element of
minimal norm in A−1⟨f⟩. We have
xα(t) = xα(0) +
Z t
0
x′
α(s)ds,
t ∈R, α > 0.
By taking the average we deduce that xα(0) = ⟨xα⟩−<
R t
0 x′
α(s)ds > and
therefore, since (x′
α)α>0 is uniformly convergent, it follows that (xα(0))α>0 is
also convergent. Finally we conclude that (xα)α>0 is convergent in C1([0, T]; H)
to the periodic solution x for (33) such that < x > is the element of minimal
norm in A−1⟨f⟩.
Before analyzing the periodic solution for the heat equation, following an
idea of [7], let us state the following proposition.
Proposition 3.9 Assume that A : D(A) ⊂H →H is a linear maximal mono-
tone and symmetric operator and f ∈C1([0, T]; H) is a T-periodic function.
Then for every x0 ∈D(A) we have
lim
t→∞
1
T (x(t + T; 0, x0) −x(t; 0, x0)) = ⟨f⟩−ProjR(A)⟨f⟩,
(46)
where x(·; 0, x0) represents the solution of (33) with the initial data x0 and R(A)
is the range of A.
Remark 3.10 A being maximal monotone, A−1 is also maximal monotone and
therefore D(A−1) = R(A) is convex.

Mihai Bostan
29
Proof of Proposition 3.9.
Consider x0 ∈D(A) and denote by x(·) the
corresponding solution. By integration on [t, t + T] we get
1
T (x(t + T) −x(t)) + A

For each α > 0 consider xα ∈D(A) such that αxα + Axα = ⟨f⟩. Denoting by
y(·) the function y(t) = 1
T
R t+T
t
x(s)ds,
t ≥0, equation (47) writes
y′(t) + Ay(t) = αxα + Axα,
t ≥0, α > 0.
Let us search for y of the form y1 + y2 where
y′
1(t) + Ay1(t) = αxα,
t ≥0,
with the initial condition y1(0) = 0 and
y′
2(t) + Ay2(t) = Axα,
t ≥0,
(48)
with the initial condition y2(0) = y(0) = 1
T
R T
0 x(t)dt. We are interested on the
asymptotic behaviour of Ay(t) = Ay1(t) + Ay2(t) for large t. We have
y1(t)
=
e−tAy1(0) +
Z t
0
e−(t−s)Aαxαds
=
Z t

e−(t−s)Aαxαds,
and therefore,
Ay1(t) =
Z t
0
Ae−(t−s)Aαxαds = e−(t−s)Aαxα

t
0 = (1 −e−tA)αxα.
By the other hand, after multiplication of (48) by y′
2(t) = (y2(t) −xα)′ we get
∥y′
2(t)∥2 + (A(y2(t) −xα), (y2(t) −xα)′) = 0,
t ≥0.
Since A is symmetric, after integration on [0, t] we obtain
Z t

∥y′
2(s)∥2ds + 1
2(A(y2(t) −xα), y2(t) −xα) = 1
2(A(y2(0) −xα), y2(0) −xα),
and therefore, by the monotony of A it follows that
Z ∞

∥y′

Periodic solutions for evolution equations
Thus limt→∞y′
2(t) = 0 and by passing to the limit in (48) we deduce that
limt→∞Ay2(t) = limt→∞(Axα −y′
2(t)) = Axα. Finally we ﬁnd that
lim
t→∞

=
⟨f⟩−αxα −Axα = 0,
α > 0.
(49)
Now let us put yα = Axα and observe that yα + αA−1yα = Axα + αxα =
⟨f⟩,
α > 0. Therefore,
lim

and it follows that
lim
α↘0 αxα = lim
α↘0(⟨f⟩−Axα) = lim
α↘0(⟨f⟩−yα) = ⟨f⟩−ProjR(A)⟨f⟩.
Since Graph(A) is closed and [αxα, αyα] = [αxα, A(αxα)] ∈A, α > 0, by
passing to the limit for α ↘0 we deduce that ⟨f⟩−ProjR(A)⟨f⟩∈D(A) and
A(⟨f⟩−ProjR(A)⟨f⟩) = 0. It is easy to see that we can pass to the limit for
α ↘0 in (49). Indeed, for ε > 0 let us consider αε > 0 such that ∥limα↘0 αxα−

Periodic solutions for the heat equation
Let Ω⊂Rd, d ≥1, be an open bounded set with ∂Ω∈C2. Consider the heat
equation
∂u
∂t (t, x) −∆u(t, x) = f(t, x),
(t, x) ∈R × Ω,
(50)
with the Dirichlet boundary condition
u(t, x) = g(t, x),
(t, x) ∈R × ∂Ω,
(51)
or the Neumann boundary condition
∂u
∂n(t, x) = g(t, x),
(t, x) ∈R × ∂Ω,
(52)
where we denote by n(x) the outward normal in x ∈∂Ω.
Theorem 3.12 Assume that f ∈C1(R; L2(Ω)) is T-periodic and g(t, x) =
∂u0
∂n (t, x), (t, x) ∈R×∂Ωwhere u0 ∈C1(R; H2(Ω))∩C2(R; L2(Ω)) is T-periodic.
Then the heat problem (50), (52) has T-periodic solutions u ∈C(R; H2(Ω)) ∩
C1(R; L2(Ω)) if and only if

and the solution is unique up to a constant.
Proof
Let us search for solutions u = u0 + v where
∂v
∂t (t, x) −∆v(t, x) = f(t, x) −∂u0
∂t (t, x) + ∆u0(t, x),
(t, x) ∈R × Ω,

and

∂n (t, x) = 0,
(t, x) ∈R × ∂Ω.

Periodic solutions for evolution equations
Consider the operator AN : D(AN) ⊂L2(Ω) →L2(Ω) given as
ANv = −∆v
with domain
D(AN) =

v ∈H2(Ω) : ∂v
∂n(x) = 0, ∀x ∈∂Ω

The operator AN is linear monotone:

(56)
Since the equation λv −∆v = f has unique solution in D(AN) for every f ∈
L2(Ω), λ > 0 it follows that AN is maximal (see [6]). Moreover, it is symmetric
(ANv1, v2) =
Z
Ω
∇v1(x) · ∇v2(x)dx = (v1, ANv2),
∀v1, v2 ∈D(AN).
Note that by the hypothesis the second member in (54) f −u′
0 +∆u0 belongs to
C1(R; L2(Ω)). Therefore the Theorem 3.8 applies and hence the problem (54),
(55) has periodic solutions if and only if there is w ∈D(AN) such that

Theorem 3.13 Assume that f ∈C1(R; L2(Ω)) is T-periodic and g(t, x) =
u0(t, x), (t, x) ∈R×∂Ωwhere u0 ∈C1(R; H2(Ω))∩C2(R; L2(Ω)) is T-periodic.
Then the heat problem (50), (51) has an unique T-periodic solution u in
C(R; H2(Ω)) ∩C1(R; L2(Ω)) and there is a constant C(Ω) such that

Proof
This time we consider the operator AD : D(AD) ⊂L2(Ω) →L2(Ω)
given as
ADv = −∆v
with domain
D(AD) =

v ∈H2(Ω) : v(x) = 0, ∀x ∈∂Ω

As before AD is linear, monotone and symmetric and thus our problem reduces
to the existence for an elliptic equation:
−∆w = 1
T
Z T

{f(t) + ∆u0(t)}dt,
with homogenous Dirichlet boundary condition w = 0 on ∂Ω. Since the previous

Z T

{f(t) + ∆u0(t)}dt∥L2(Ω)

we prove the existence for (50), (51). Here we denote by C(Ω) the Poincar´e’s

Hence if (ADv, v) = 0 we deduce that v = 0. Therefore, by Proposition 3.2 we
deduce the uniqueness of the periodic solution for (50), (51). The estimates of
the solution follow immediately from (59) and Theorem 3.8.

Periodic solutions for evolution equations
3.4
Non-linear case
Throughout this section we will consider evolution equations associated to sub-
diﬀerential operators. Let ϕ : H →]−∞, +∞] be a lower-semicontinuous proper
convex function on a real Hilbert space H. Denote by ∂ϕ ⊂H × H the sub-
diﬀerential of ϕ,
∂ϕ(x) =

y ∈H; ϕ(x) −ϕ(u) ≤(y, x −u), ∀u ∈H
	
,
(60)
and denote by D(ϕ) the eﬀective domain of ϕ:
D(ϕ) =

x ∈H; ϕ(x) < +∞
	
.
Under the previous assumptions on ϕ we recall that A = ∂ϕ is maximal mono-
tone in H × H and D(A) = D(ϕ). Consider the equation
x′(t) + ∂ϕx(t) ∋f(t),
0 < t < T.
(61)
We say that x is solution for (61) if x ∈C([0, T]; H), x is absolutely continuous
on every compact of ]0, T[ (and therefore a.e. diﬀerentiable on ]0, T[) and sat-
isﬁes x(t) ∈D(∂ϕ) a.e. on ]0, T[ and x′(t) + ∂ϕx(t) ∋f(t) a.e. on ]0, T[. We
have the following main result [1]
Theorem 3.14 Let f be given in L2(]0, T[; H) and x0 ∈D(∂ϕ).
Then the
Cauchy problem (61) with the initial condition x(0) = x0 has a unique solution
x ∈C([0, T]; H) which satisﬁes:
x ∈W 1,2(]δ, T[; H)
∀0 < δ < T,
√
t · x′ ∈L2(]0, T[; H),
ϕ ◦x ∈L1(0, T).
Moreover, if x0 ∈D(ϕ) then
x′ ∈L2(]0, T[; H),
ϕ ◦x ∈L∞(0, T).
We are interested in ﬁnding suﬃcient conditions on A = ∂ϕ and f such that
equation (61) has unique T-periodic solution, i.e. x(0) = x(T). Obviously, if
such a solution exists, by periodicity we deduce that it is absolutely continuous
on [0, T] and belongs to W 1,2(]0, T[; H). It is well known that if ϕ is strictly
convex then ∂ϕ is strictly monotone and therefore the uniqueness holds
Proposition 3.15 Assume that ϕ : H →]−∞, +∞] is a lower-semicontinuous
proper, strictly convex function. Then equation (61) has at most one periodic
solution.
Proof
By using Proposition 3.2 it is suﬃcient to prove that ∂ϕ is strictly
monotone. Suppose that there are u1, u2 ∈D(∂ϕ), u1 ̸= u2 such that
(∂ϕ(u1) −∂ϕ(u2), u1 −u2) = 0.

Mihai Bostan
35
We have
ϕ(u2) −ϕ(u1)
≥
(∂ϕ(u1), u2 −u1)
=
−(∂ϕ(u2), u1 −u2)
≥
ϕ(u2) −ϕ(u1),
and hence
ϕ(u2) −ϕ(u1) = (∂ϕ(u1), u2 −u1).
We can also write for λ ∈]0, 1[
ϕ((1 −λ)u1 + λu2)
=
ϕ(u1 + λ(u2 −u1))
≥
ϕ(u1) + (∂ϕ(u1), λ(u2 −u1))
=
ϕ(u1) + λ(∂ϕ(u1), u2 −u1)
=
ϕ(u1) + λ(ϕ(u2) −ϕ(u1))
=
(1 −λ)ϕ(u1) + λϕ(u2).
Since ϕ is strictly convex we have also
ϕ((1 −λ)u1 + λu2) < (1 −λ)ϕ(u1) + λϕ(u2),
which is in contradiction with the previous inequality. Thus u1 = u2 and hence
∂ϕ is strictly monotone. We state now the result concerning the existence of
periodic solutions.
Theorem 3.16 Suppose that ϕ : H →] −∞, +∞] is a lower-semicontinuous
proper convex function and f ∈L2(]0, T[; H) such that
lim
∥x∥→∞{ϕ(x) −(x, ⟨f⟩)} = +∞,
(62)
and every level subset {x ∈H; ϕ(x) + ∥x∥2 ≤M} is compact. Then equation
(61) has T-periodic solutions x ∈C([0, T]; H) ∩W 1,2(]0, T[; H) which satisfy
∥x′∥L2(]0,T [;H) ≤∥f∥L2(]0,T [;H),
x(t) ∈D(ϕ) ∀t ∈[0, T],
ϕ ◦x ∈L∞(0, T).
Before showing this result, notice that the condition (62) implies that the
lower-semicontinuous proper convex function ψ : H →] −∞, +∞] given by
ψ(x) = ϕ(x) −(x, ⟨f⟩) has a minimum point x0 ∈H and therefore ⟨f⟩∈
Range(∂ϕ) since 0 = ∂ψ(x0) = ∂ϕ(x0) −⟨f⟩.
Proof
As previous for every α > 0 we consider the unique periodic solution
xα for
αxα(t) + x′
α(t) + ∂ϕxα(t) = f(t),
0 < t < T.
(63)
(In order to prove the existence and uniqueness of the periodic solution for (63)
consider the application Sα : D(∂ϕ) →D(∂ϕ) deﬁned by Sα(x0) = x(T; 0, x0),

36
Periodic solutions for evolution equations
where x(·; 0, x0) denote the unique solution of (63) with the initial condition x0
and apply the Banach’s ﬁxed point theorem. By the previous theorem it follows
that the periodic solution xα is absolutely continuous on [0, T] and belongs to
C([0, T]; H)∩W 1,2(]0, T[; H)). First of all we will show that (x′
α)α>0 is uniformly
bounded in L2(]0, T[; H). Indeed, after multiplication by x′

Before estimate (xα)α>0, let us check that (αxα)α>0 is bounded. By taking

It follows that α∥xα(t)∥≤C2(x0, T, ∥f∥L2(]0,T [;H)), 0 ≤t ≤T, 0 < α < 1. Now
we can estimate xα, α > 0. After multiplication by xα(t) and integration on

Thus we deduce that for α > 0,

(70)
From Hypothesis (62) we get that (xα(tα))0<α<1 is bounded and therefore from

Z t

we deduce that (xα)0<α<1 is bounded in L∞(]0, T[; H) and that there is x ∈
L∞(]0, T[; H) such that xα(t) ⇀x(t) when α goes to 0 for t ∈[0, T]. Moreover,
from (70) it follows that (ϕ(xα(tα)))0<α<1 is bounded from above and we deduce
that

On the other hand, by writing ϕ(xα(t)) ≥ϕ(x0) + (∂ϕ(x0), xα(t) −x0), 0 ≤t ≤
T, α > 0 we deduce that ϕ(xα(t)) is also bounded from below so that ﬁnally
(ϕ ◦xα)0<α<1 is bounded in L∞(]0, T[; H).

Now, using the second hypothesis of the theorem (every level subset is com-
pact) we deduce that xα(0) →x(0) when α goes to 0 (at least for a subsequence
αn ↘0). In fact we can easily check that xα converges uniformly to x on [0, T]
since
∥xα(t) −xβ(t)∥≤∥xα(0) −xβ(0)∥+ |α −β| · T · sup
0<γ<1
∥xγ∥L∞(]0,T [;H),
for 0 ≤t ≤T, 0 < α, β < 1.
Now, since limα↘0 dxα/dt = dx/dt in the
sense of H-valued vectorial distribution on ]0, T[ and (x′
α)α>0 is bounded in
L2(]0, T[; H) it follows that x′ belongs to L2(]0, T[; H) and in particular x is
absolutely continuous on every compact of ]0, T[ and therefore a.e. diﬀerentiable
on ]0, T[.
To complete the proof we need to show that x(t) ∈D(ϕ) a.e. on ]0, T[ and
x′(t) + ∂ϕx(t) ∋f(t) a.e. on ]0, T[. For arbitrarily [u, v] ∈∂ϕ we have

[u, v] ∈∂ϕ we deduce that x(t) ∈D(∂ϕ) a.e. on ]0, T[ and x′(t)+∂ϕx(t) ∋f(t)
a.e. on ]0, T[. Since ϕ is lower-semicontinuous we also have
ϕ(x(t)) ≤lim
α↘0 inf ϕ(xα(t)) ≤lim
α↘0 inf ∥ϕ ◦xα∥L∞≤sup
0<γ<1
∥ϕ ◦xγ∥L∞.
As previous, by writing
ϕ(x(t))
≥
ϕ(x0) + (∂ϕ(x0), x(t) −x0)
≥
ϕ(x0) −∥∂ϕ(x0)∥· (∥x0∥+ lim
α↘0 inf ∥xα(t)∥)
≥
ϕ(x0) −∥∂ϕ(x0)∥· (∥x0∥+ sup
0<γ<1
∥xγ∥L∞),
0 ≤t ≤T,
we deduce ﬁnally that ϕ ◦x ∈L∞(0, T).

Periodic solutions for evolution equations
Remark 3.17 If dim H < +∞then the level subsets {x ∈H ; ϕ(x) + ∥x∥2 ≤
M} are compact as bounded sets.
Remark 3.18 Assume that ϕ : H →] −∞, +∞] is a lower-semicontinuous
proper convex function such that Range(∂ϕ) = H which is equivalent to
lim
∥x∥→∞{ϕ(x) −(x, y)} = +∞,
∀y ∈H,
see [4], pp.41. In particular, by taking y = ⟨f⟩we deduce that the hypothesis
(62) is veriﬁed.
Remark 3.19 Assume that ϕ is coercive
lim
∥x∥→∞
(∂ϕ(x), x −x0)
∥x∥
= +∞,
∀x0 ∈D(ϕ),
which is equivalent to lim∥x∥→∞
ϕ(x)
∥x∥= +∞(see [4], pp.42). Then Range(ϕ) =
H because the previous condition is satisﬁed: lim∥x∥→∞{ϕ(x) −(x, y)} = +∞,
for all y ∈H and therefore (62) is veriﬁed.
Theorem 3.20 Suppose that ϕ : H →] −∞, +∞] is a lower-semicontinuous
proper convex function and f ∈W 1,1(]0, T[; H) such that
lim
∥x∥→∞{ϕ(x) −(x, ⟨f⟩)} = +∞,
(71)
and every level subset {x ∈H; ϕ(x) + ∥x∥2 ≤M} is compact. Then equation
(61) has T-periodic solutions x ∈C([0, T]; H) ∩W 1,∞(]0, T[; H) which satisfy
x(t) ∈D(∂ϕ),
∀t ∈[0, T],
d+
dt x(t) + (∂ϕx(t) −f(t))◦= 0,
∀t ∈[0, T],
where (∂ϕ −f)◦denote the minimal section of ∂ϕ −f.
Proof
Since W 1,1(]0, T[; H) ⊂L2(]0, T[; H) the previous theorem applies.
Consider x ∈C([0, T]; H)∩W 1,2(]0, T[; H) a T-periodic solution for (61). Since
∥x′∥L2(]0,T [;H) ≤∥f∥L2(]0,T [;H) it follows that there is t⋆∈]0, T[ such that x is
diﬀerentiable in t⋆and ∥x′(t⋆)∥≤

√
T ∥f∥L2(]0,T [;H). By standard calculation
we ﬁnd that:
∥1
h(x(t + h) −x(t))∥≤∥1
h(x(t⋆+ h) −x(t⋆))∥+
Z t
t⋆∥1
h(f(τ + h) −f(τ)∥dτ,
and therefore sup0≤t≤T, h>0 ∥1
h(x(t + h) −x(t))∥≤C which implies that x ∈
W 1,∞(]0, T[; H). Making use of the inequality

which holds for every [u, v] ∈∂ϕ we deduce that x(t) ∈D(∂ϕ) for all t ∈
[0, T] and the weak closure of the set { 1
h(x(t + h) −x(t)), h > 0} belongs to
f(t) −∂ϕx(t), ∀t ∈[0, T]. On the other hand by writing
∥x(t + h) −u∥≤∥x(t) −u∥+
Z t+h
