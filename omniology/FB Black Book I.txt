Intro
This is a great opportunity right now, be glad you acted on it.  The scale of face-
book is massive, with 400 million monthly active users it’s hard to debate that.  It’s 
the biggest social network that exists, and the 2nd largest site in the world accord-
ing to alexa.  Naturally there are a lot of people to capitalize on, and that’s where 
we come in.  
Our primary objective to this ebook is to not only make you money, but to shed 
some extra light on your marketing process and ideas.  Too many “marketers” 
these days are nothing but copy cat jerkoffs who will never succeed because they 
lack fundamental logic behind marketing.  The people who do it big think for them-
selves, and then have the talent to execute their concepts into reality.  Author-
ity, persuasion, desires, fears, calls to action etc. are all parts of the fundamental 
marketing.  You can copy the methods exactly in this book if you want, it will make 
you some good money, but the goal is for our unique marketing experience to give 
you a new perspective on what can be accomplished to socially engineer the social 
world.
Section I:  The Profile Layouts Method
Before we get started all of these methods can be done manually.  Granted it’s 
more work, but at the amount of clicks you can get with the methods in this book, 
one hour a day manually doing it can easily provide you with a thousand interested 
clickers.  We have a shitload of harvested group ids we are willing to share with our 
customers so you can do what you please with them.
The method explained
For this method we will be using a profile layout offer such as Chameleon Tom on 
Loudmo (http://www.Loudmo.com). Loudmo is very easy to get accepted into.  Get 
the Chameleon Tom link code, go to bit.ly (http://www.bit.ly) and turn the Chame-
leon Tom link into a bit.ly link.  
Another offer is pagerage.com.  You can signup @ http://www.pagerage.com/
WLAffiliates.aspx

Now this is where FaceWizard comes in handy, particularly the page scraper.  If you 
have FaceWizard, open it and go to the page scraper tab.  This is a general method, 
thus we can search for general keywords.  We want to reach as many people as 
possible, so set it to search for pages with over 100,000 likes/members.  General 
keywords work fine such as “I” “and” “the” etc.  Save all of these in separate lists.  
If you do not have FaceWizard, search groups manually(or ask us for our group ids) 
in Facebook for the same keywords, find pages/groups over 100,000, and copy and 
paste the group id into a text file.  This is a little time consuming but you will only 
have to do this once.  
Page Finder/Scraper Searching for pages based on “I, the, A”

Now, if you are in FaceWizard, go to the wall poster tab. 
 Paste your group id’s you have saved, and we are ready to post.   
Here are a few sample messages:
{Hey|Hi|Hello} {guys|everyone|everybody} {check out|u should check out|you 
should get} {official layouts|these official layouts} {for your profile|on your profile}!
I’m tired of|I’m so tired of|So tired of} {seeing boring|looking at boring} 
{profiles|profiles all day} {you guys need to|you guys have to} {get|go get} {the 
official|official} {layouts|profile layouts|layouts for yourprofile} {go here!|just go 
here!} 

This method seems to average 3 clicks per post in large groups.  This offer can con-
vert at a steady 5% @ $1.50 per US signup, you can do the math here 
How many accounts will I need?
A minimum of 100.  PVA accounts are not necessary for this method.  To maximize 
the potential of this method, I recommend at least 500 accounts.  Make sure the 
accounts have pictures, and female accounts seem to work better.
How many proxies will I need?
This largely depends on how many accounts you are using, but I would recommend 
having a minimum of 100 on hand.   You can get away with using 1 proxy per every 
5 accounts.
How many posts should I make?
I recommend 5 posts per account per day.  This seems to give accounts a very nice 
longevity.

Section II:  The Break Up Method
The method explained
For this, we want to make our post sound as real as possible, gaining a ton more 
traffic.  See the concepts section for more on this.  The method is simple, we are 
telling people this thing told us to break up with our bf/gf.  1 post = about 4 clicks 
for this method.  Here are some examples with variables.
{LOL|lmao|haha|rofl} {this thing|this thing is crazy|I just did this thing} {it told 
me|it just told me|and it told me|and it just told me} {to break up with|I should 
break up with|that I should break up with} {my bf|my boyfriend} {check this 
out|check it out|look at this}! (link here)
LOL this thing is crazy it just told me to break up with my bf check it out! (link here)
You’re looking to get at least a 2% conversion on whatever offer you run.  This 
method brings in  huge volume so be prepared 
What will I need?
For this method, we will scrape pages using the same concept above.  We can do 
this a little more targeted than the layouts if we want, but you don’t absolutely 
have to.   Some good phrases to scrape would be “love” “relationships” “girls” 
“guys” “bf” “gf” “class” “school” you get the idea.  Collect another list of groups 
based on these or similar terms.  For this method we will be using love calculators, 
crush calculators, etc.  You can find these mobile quizzes on virtually every major 
network under the mobile/cellphone offer category.  Once you have the link code 
for your offer, turn it into a bit.ly link as in method #1.

Section III:  Protect Your Identity Method
The method explained
This method we will pretend our friend had their identity compromised on Face-
book, and we don’t want anyone else to go through the same thing.  Here is a sam-
ple message:
{Hey|Hi} {everyone|everybody|all} {my friend|my best friend} {got|had} her iden-
tity {stolen|stolen away} {on Facebook|on Face Book|on here} {and I don’t want|I 
don’t want|I really don’t want} {anyone else|anybody else} {to go through it|to 
have to go through it|to ever go through it} {please|will you please} {go here|go to 
this site} {and get protected?|and be protected?|so you can be protected?} http://
www.yoursite.com
There are quite a few identity theft offers out there, we found one on copeac that 
works quite well for this.  The first time this method was tested there was 1300 
clicks off 600 walls posts which converted around 1.2%.  After refining the ad copy 
conversion went to around 1.5% which equaled in 20 sales or so @ $30 a piece.
What will I need?
This will require roughly the same as the last two methods.  Accounts (non-pva will 
work fine), group ids, and posting to walls.

Section IV:  Fan Group Methods
What will I need?
For this you will almost certainly need a program like Facewizard, or something 
that you can add friends with.  There are some friend adder apps around bhw and 
thevault.  The more accounts the better with this, although it can be very effective 
with a few hundred accounts.  
The method explained
For this example Twilight will be used, although we want this to also be a guideline 
to use for your thinking in future campaigns.  First we need to make a fan page.  
Look at the Twilight fan page I made: http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/
group.php?gid=117162841636265
Instead of just making something called “Twilight Page” or “Twilight Fan Page” we 
want something catchy, something that calls on people to react or join.   I picked 
the title “I BET WE CAN GET 1,000,000 TWILIGHT MEMBERS BEFORE ECLIPSE”  this 
gives people a reason to join.  Check the description of this group, you will want to 
come up with something similar so everyone you invite invites all their friends and 
so on, helping your group go viral.
Once you have the group made, you will want to scrape targeted friends to add.  
Search groups for Twilight, there are a ton of course.  Hopefully you have a friend 
finding program such as FaceWizard or Facebook Friend Adder Pro.  To scrape 
members of a group, go to one, and right click on “See All” where it shows the 
pictures of the members.  Hit copy link location and paste into your friend adding 
program.   Here is my favorite Twilight group to scrape:
http://www.facebook.com/social_graph.php?node_id=4028140673
Once you have your targeted ID list of Twilight fans, time to add.  I recommend 
adding 10-20 friends per account per day, this will quickly add up.  After that use 
FaceWizard or Friend Adder Pro to invite all your friends to your group.  
Make sure only admins can post on your wall, and make the first post have a link to 

your group.  Here is what I did: 
http://www.facebook.com/posted.php?id=117162841636265&share_id=1053923
02836826&comments=1#s105392302836826
It’s good to keep making posts like this about how much you are growing, and add 
a link to your group at the bottom.
Once you have done that, use all your accounts to like and comment on your post.  
To get the link for the specific post, right click on the date and time of your post, 
and copy link address.  That will give you a link similar to the one posted above, 
you want to plug this into your favorite program and like and comment on it from 
all of your accounts.  Here is a simple generic variable I like to use for comments.
{really|very|totally|quite} {awesome|cool|fun|great}!
I {like|love|really like|really love} {this|this idea|this group|it}!
Once you have a certain amount of members, make a wall post with a specific 
quiz.  For Twilight there are tons of quizzes and surveys, you can find these also on 
almost all major networks right now.  The one I used is this Werewolf vs Vampire 
quiz.  Here is my post:
http://www.facebook.com/posted.php?id=117162841636265&share_id=1185925
44832247&comments=1#s118592544832247
Say something like I did “Wow I’m so excited we have xxxxx amount of members 
I’m going to try to find xxxx related stuff for us to do online starting with this!”  
Start thinking of how you can multiply this.  Twilight is a great example of course, 
as it has a large cult following.  But there are these surveys and quizzes for every 
movie.  Search the networks for these quizzes and surveys as a starting point and 
base your groups/pages after them.  Everything new and hot can be capitalized on 
here, just as anywhere else, it just takes some creativity  

Billboard Artist Fanpages
While most of the billboard artist’s music makes me sick, millions of teenagers love these one 
hit wonders and kiddie stars, so why not make a buck off em.  We have done this for many 
different methods using popular artists as a front to sell music related products like ringtones, 
fangear, music download programs, and of course the “meet randomcelebritysname contest!” 
http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100#/charts/hot-100
It’d be best to stay with the top 10 songs and artists, so you can get the most volume.
Create a fanpage with a popular artist, let’s say Rhianna
Title it something decent like:
“The Rhianna Fanpage for REAL rhianna fans”
This will ensure that your page has some hardcore 
followers and will most likely respond to your group 
once you try and monetize it.  
Follow the same steps as the twilight group method 
in how you scrape fans from other groups and invite 
them to join yours.  This is a pretty flawless way to 
get fans as long as you aren’t totally spammy about 
it.
Once you have reached a solid number of fans say 
15-20k, make a wallpost or update saying something 
along the lines of “Get your official Rhianna ring-
tones from --> INSERT YOUR LINK HERE”
The best part about this method is that it’s almost impossible to get saturated as there are 
thousands of incredibly popular artists to make pages for.  If you make all the top100 billboard 
artist’s fanpages and update each group once a week, it’s possible to see thousands a week in 
week in ringtone sales.  2 sales per group @ $9 a piece is $1800 a week with 100 groups.  We 
saw 13 leads off one update on an artist group around the 35k range.  Stick to the rappers, 
younger artists like this new bieber kid, r+b, the dumber the music the better.

Going International
f you’ve never heard of this site it’s amazing: 
https://www.onehourtranslation.com  
You can get native speaking translations with a very fast turnaround.  Since 
facebook is quickly becoming the biggest site on the planet for many different 
countries it’s obvious that people who speak different languages will respond 
better to their native language.
Here’s an example of a few huge fanpages that have 
locked in millions of primarily spanish speaking 
fans:
http://www.facebook.com/simpson.latino
http://www.facebook.com/pages/COMO-
CAMBIARLE-EL-COLOR-A-TU-PERFIL/130198463387
http://www.facebook.com/pages/Se-me-olvido-lo-
que-tenia-que-hacer/113571000086
http://www.facebook.com/pages/Callate-y-dame-
un-beso/46084937138
Now these are just spanish speaking pages and they 
all have 2 million likes or more.  It is very easy to 
come up with a funny or interesting page in english 
and have it translated word for word into spanish.  
Then scrape all the friend ids from the top 4 groups, 
add as many as friends as you can, then suggest 
them to join your new page.  Done and done.
You can do this for many different languages, but 
I’d stick to spanish, german, italian and french for 
volume so you can get millions of likes.

Section V:  The IQ Challenge Method
What will I need?
A few hundred accounts at minimum.  Find a nice IQ quiz offer, these are on 
every major network.  Get your link code and turn it into a bit.ly link.  Now 
there are many variations of this, many different messages we could send. 
Here are some sample messages with variables:
{Hey|What’s up|Hey yall} {I am doing|I am conducting|I’m doing|i’m conducting} {a study|a 
big study} {at LSU|at USC|at MSU|at ISU|atUGA|at UNC} {to determine|to figure out|to try 
to figure out} {if male or female|whether male or female|if female or male|whether female 
or male} {members|users} {are smarter|are the smartest} . {Can my favorite|Will my favorite} 
{people|group of people} {help me out please|please help me out|help me with this} ? {I have 
it set up|I’ve got it set up|It’s setup at|It’s set up} {here|right here} http://www.yourlink.com
 {lol|lmao|rofl} {there’s|theres|there is} {NO way|No possible way|NO way in hell} 
{anybody|anyone|ne one} {could|can|will} {do better than my|beat my} {80|81|82|83} here 
{-->|--->|---->} http://www.yourlink.com
Both of these messages are effective, the second seems to get more volume, the 
first converts better, as you would expect.  Now we can also promote this with a 
splash widget (see concept section).  Create a new splash widget with just 1 IQ 
quiz, and have your title say something like “Welcome Facebook user to the Face-
book IQ Challenge!  When you are ready click below!”  If you are using the male vs. 
female angle, mention that also in your widget. 

Section VI:  The Messenger Method
The method explained
This was one of the better performing campaigns we ran due to the quality and 
desirability of the product.  There are a few different programs that do this but the 
one we are focusing on is digsby.
Digsby is a multi-protocol IM client that allows instant messaging on AIM, MSN, yahoo, 
icq, google talk, etc and also is an email notification tool and social networking app all 
into one.  It’s the ultimate app for social interaction and tens of thousands of people are 
downloading it per day.  This offer is on a few different networks, just check offervault to 
see which one you’d like to run it on.  We decided to see if facebook users would like this 
and it was obvious that they do.  We used the same promotional method, wall posts but 
this one could be extended to IM’ing facebook users as well.  
Here are some messages we used with variables:
{whoa|wow|damn} this {thing|app|program} {allows you to|lets you} {put|have} {all your|a 
bunch of|the} {messengers|IM programs|instant messengers} {in one app|in one program} {--
>|--->|---->} http://www.yourlink.com
Just got this digsby {thing|app|program} it {notifies|updates|sends} {emails|email} and {al-
lows you to|lets you} {put|have} {all your|a bunch of|the} {messengers|IM programs|instant 
messengers} {in one app|in one program}  http://www.yourlink.com

Section VII:  Open Graph API Potential
This concept is not exclusive to this book, a few different press releases and methods have 
been shared around with this new development, but we figured it should at least cover the ba-
sics of it and what it can mean for an incredible wave of viral traffic.  This is beyond fanpages, 
because 1) you can put a viral fb feature on external websites and 2) you ultimately have con-
trol over your page.
With the advent of facebook’s focus on “liking”, everything is gravitating towards whether you 
like something or not.  With the open graph api you can create a swarm of facebook traffic by 
easily using these lines of code on your page to make it connect with facebook.
<iframe src=”http://www.facebook.com/widgets/like.php?href=http://example.com”
        scrolling=”no” frameborder=”0”
        style=”border:none; width:450px; height:80px”></iframe>
That’s it for the like button code and then anyone logged in on facebook that goes to your site 
and hits the like button, a small comment saying ”joe blow likes ‘yoursite.com/whateverpage.
html’” is auto published to their wall/feed, without them hitting anything else!  
The tactics of persuasion obviously were the first thing that jumped into my brain-
HOW DO WE GET THEM TO HIT THE LIKE BUTTON?
With a site like http://www.sociable.es/facebook-wordpress-plugin-3-0/ it’s auto locks the page until 
the person logs in with facebook and then hits the like button.  This is definitely one of the easy ways 
to do it.  You can get the sociable.es wp plugin here- http://www.sociable.es/facebook-connect/
So give away points, content, whatever else to get them to hit the like button.
Another way I was thinking is to have the like button be next to things they would generally like.  Quiz-
zes and surveys are perfect for this, if you use these in your cpalead campaigns anyway why not in-
clude a small iframe with the like button next to some of your questions to get some free viral traffic?

Section VIII:  Concepts/Tutorials
Using CPALead Splash Widgets
I have been using CPALead’s new splash widgets lately and realized it can be a nice tool to essentially 
whip up landing pages on the fly.  Go to CPALead, go to non incentive offers, check one, and hit create 
splash widget.   Now if you only select one offer, you are essentially creating a landing page!   You see 
on the next step you can have a header and a footer.  Let’s say you are promoting the Taco Bell vs. KFC 
survey.  Select that one offer, in your title say something like “Welcome Facebook user!  Please help 
us in our study to determine whether Facebook users prefer Taco Bell or KFC just click below!”  The 
widget is designed with a timer that will unlock a page after it shows the splash widget for a certain 
amount of time.  But for this as we are essentially creating a landing page so set it to the highest delay, 
which is 120 seconds.  That is enough time for your lead to read the text and click to the offer.  Now 
you can simply generate your code, and create a text file with this:
 
<HEAD>
CPALEAD CODE
</HEAD>
Save that as whatever.html, upload it to one of your domains, go to bit.ly change your link to a bit.ly 
link, and get to the wall posting!  With my example above you can see how easy it is to generate new 
ideas and employ new ideas that you have.

Finalized Splash Widget
(pretty damn nice for being created in 20 seconds)

Section IX:  Anonymity and Remaining Undetected
Staying anonymous on the net is not only good for blackhats, but in general.  Social 
networks are smart and are always on the heels of most of the marketers out there 
banning them daily by ip match,  OS and useragent combos, behavioral patterns 
and more so you want to make sure you are taking as many precautions as you can.  
Here are some tools and strategies I’ve used to keep a lower profile.
VPN
VPN(Virtual private networks) basically act as a shield between the internet and 
your local connection.  It accesses another network then to the internet vs. your 
ISP connecting directly.  This is very useful for remaining anonymous to the end 
network.  I suggest you use an http proxy on your browser even after a VPN for 
even greater protection.  Here are some VPN services I have used and suggest
• Hidemyass
• StrongVPN
Virtual Machines
Virtual machines(vm’s) are very useful if you have licenses for an OS or the OS is 
free to install.  Most people wouldn’t get as much use out of having ubuntu on 
a virtual machine vs. windows because you don’t have many GUI based bots on 
linux.  If you do have windows OS keys, you can install vmware for free on linux ma-
chines vs. paying for windows hosting.
• VMware
Windows Servers
These are probably the best to use with GUI based windows apps such as Facewiz-
ard and Friend Adder Pro.  One, so your local ISP and internet is not dealing with 
your crap and bandwidth limitations, and two because you can launch multiple 
remotes and instances at one time which can handle and run apps all day.

Proxies
• Yourprivateproxy.com
• Packetflip.com
These are both great proxy providers who I use.  The best option is to go for 
private ones considering a lot of the public ips are banned from similar abuse. 
   
Removing Footprints and Tracks
Delete cache/cookies 
• CCleaner
• Delete Flash Cookies(LSO)
	
This is an important one a lot of people miss, they get detected and then they 
have no idea why all their accounts are getting shutdown.  Delete your flash ob-
jects in ccleaner and then set your flash cookie settings just like in the screenshots 
at the link below.
http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/set-
tings_manager03.html

My ideal setup is VPN on local machine, log in to remote windows pc which is un-
der a VPN, set a temporary http proxy on my browser and go to work.  This way 
if anything you do browser based bans your IP, you set a new one and you should 
be good to go.  If it gets past that and they ban your VPN’s IP, just switch to a new 
VPN ip and http proxy.  Remember to ALWAYS clear cookies, set flash cookies to 
not store any info until you have to, clear flash cookies everytime, and run ccleaner 
often.  Never log in to any personal accounts with this setup if you can help it.

Amazon Cloud
Cloud computing is quickly becoming a tool for the everyday webmaster vs. just a computer 
science or IT professional.  You can quickly scale to use amazon’s massive bandwidth for file 
hosting or use it as a virtual terminal for your work.  The virtual terminal is the one that’s rel-
evant to this.  It’s a good option if you don’t want to get dedicated windows hosting, or to use 
it as an addition to run more instances using imacros and bots.
You can signup here: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/
You can run the following operating systems on it: RedHat Linux, Windows Server, openSuSE 
Linux, Fedora, Debian, OpenSolaris, Cent OS, Gentoo Linux, and Oracle Linux.  Windows server 
is great to use as a quick virtual terminal and you can open up up to 20 instances at once.  They 
charge a very cheap rate,  to use it for 50 hrs a month and 20 gigs of transfer is only $5.75.  I 
use a hell of a lot more than that for a number of different things. You can instantly build a 
supercomputer with 15 gigs of memory and many cores if you need to.  You can connect to the 
windows server instances via remote desktop connection(start>applications>remote desktop 
connection.  Amazon will give you the details to log in.
Here is a link to help you get it setup if you need to-
http://s3.amazonaws.com/AmazonEC2Tutorial/AmazonEC2Tutorial.html

Section IX:  Recent Changes
Facebook has now applied flagging to wall posts, however this should just be an 
obstacle really.  Here are 2 ways to ensure your posts stay up long enough to be ef-
fective.
1) Using your accounts to like/comment on your wall posts.  Obviously this would 
be quite time consuming manually, let’s face it programs just get things done fast-
er.  So after you have posted through FaceWizard or FriendAdderPro you can sim-
ply paste your wall id’s into the liker tab and hit go.  However in FW it will default 
to liking/commenting the latest wall post.  So obviously you will have to be fast if 
you do it this way.  You can also get your actual post id’s one by one…….This will 
be time consuming but your conversions and clicks will also greatly increase doing 
this.  To do that right click on the date and time of the post, and copy the link.  Go 
through and paste all those into a text file and load them into the liker tab in FW 
and you’re good to go.

2) This one is easy and already talked about in the book, but now with flagging it is 
that much more important:  Making yourself sound like a normal FB user sharing 
something cool.  I wouldn’t recommend anything like “Learn how to make 5 billion 
dollars online!”  “Want to go back to college?  Apply here!”  A great angle is simply 
to say something like “Check this out it’s pretty cool” or “This is so funny lmao” “I 
just found this u should check it out lol”  Adding “lmao” etc. in my opinion makes 
you sound like just another person, which is what we want. Also the research an-
gle.  These people don’t know you so who are they to say you aren’t really doing 
research?  Now all the methods in the book are already geared to that, but I want 
to make sure everyone gets this right.  It wasn’t as important before but now it 
seems pretty crucial.
Impersonation is a key improving your conversion rates in social marketing, even 
though we have been doing this for years.  Make it seem like you are a legitimate 
user and your problems and experiences are real and you will notice a huge change 
in your response and conversion rates.

Section X:  Closing
We have shared some highly profitable proven avenues for you to persue 
but hopefully also brought to surface how you can go about creating 
your own money making methods.  It really is about making your own 
twists on existing methods and ideas that really brings in the money.  Take 
action on these, hit them hard, hit them fast, and don’t look back.
