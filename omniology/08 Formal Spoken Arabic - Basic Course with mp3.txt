Arabic Research at Georgetown University 
In the past 40 years, the world of research in Arabic theoretical linguistics has ex­
panded considerably, but the production of professional quality textbooks and refer­
ence books for colloquial Arabic has remained limited. Despite the passage of years, 
the Richard Slade Harrell Arabic Series has consistently been in demand from George­
town University Press because of the quality of research that went into its composition, 
the solid theoretical foundations for its methodology, and the comprehensive coverage 
of regional Arabic speech communities. 
The Arabic Department at Georgetown University (now Department of Arabic 
Language, Literature and Linguistics) recognizes the need to sustain the tradition of 
research and publication in Arabic dialects and has continued dialectology field re­
search and textbook production, most notably with Margaret (Omar) Nydell's Syrian 
Arabic Video Course, a three-year research project funded by Center for the Advance­
ment of Language Learning (CALL) from 199 1-94. Starting in 2002, Dr. Nydell initi­
ated a four-year dialectology research project aimed at producing "conversion" courses 
to assist advanced students of Modem Standard Arabic in converting their knowledge 
and skills of written Arabic to proficiency in selected Arabic dialects. This project is 
part of a proposal prepared by the National Capital Language Resource Center under 
the directorship of Dr. James E. Alatis and Dr. Anna Chamot, and funded by the U.S. 
Department of Education. 
The first Arabic dialect tackled under this research project was Iraqi, and the Iraqi 
conversion short course was field tested successfully in the summers of 2003, 2004, 
and 2005. In developing the materials for the Iraqi conversion course, two of the most 
authoritative English sources of information were the seminal texts produced by Wal­
lace Erwin and published by Georgetown University Press in the 1960s, and which the 
press has reissued: A Basic Course in Iraqi Arabic and A Short Reference Grammar of 
Iraqi Arabic. 
We pay tribute to the tradition begun and led by Richard Harrell, the founder of 
this series, and founder of the original Arabic Research Program at Georgetown Uni­
versity. Harrell's scholarship and creative energy set a standard in the field and yielded 
an unprecedented and as yet unsurpassed series of, as he put it, "practical tools for the 
increasing number of Americans whose lives bring them into contact with the Arab 

xvi 
Arabic Research at Georgetown University 
world." Now, in 2005, Harrell's aims and achievements possess fresh relevance for the 
future and form a flI11 foundation on which to build. 
In 2005, the Syrian Arabic video course will be updated and revised for publica­
tion through the NCLRC grant and through the support of the Center for Advanced 
Proficiency in Arabic (CAPA), a newly established full-year, accelerated, intensive 
Arabic "flagship" program at Georgetown, funded by the National Security Education 
program. For more information about the Department of Arabic Language, Literature 
and Linguistics at Georgetown University, its course offerings, its degree programs, its 
certificate programs, and its research agenda, see our web page at www.georgetown.

Preface 
In the fifteen years since the publication of Formal Spoken Arabic: Basic Course, con­
siderable research has called attention to the role of this variety of Arabic in public life, 
both formal and informal. Studies of Media Arabic, Educated Arabic, and Educated 
Spoken Arabic (ESA) have revealed commonalities in these spoken Arabic idioms that 
have important implications for teaching Arabic as a foreign language. Formal Spoken 
Arabic and Educated Spoken Arabic are essentially the same phenomenon: a kind of 
Arabic whose existence on the formality spectrum ranges to about the upper-middle 
level. For an analysis of the formality levels of spoken Arabic, see especially Badawi 
(1985), who identifies five levels of Arabic: 
Level one: 
Level two: 
Level three: 
Level four: 
Level five: 
fU$ha al-turath 
Classical Arabic 
fU$ha al-ca$r 
Modem Standard Arabic 
Cammiyyat al-muthaqqafin 
Educated Spoken Arabic/Formal Spoken Arabic 
Cammiyyat al-mutanawwirln 
Semi-literate Spoken Arabic 
Cammiyyat al-'ummiyyfn 
Illiterate spoken Arabic 
For most of the history of Arabic teaching in the West, either Classical Arabic 
(CA) (Badawi's level one) or, more recently, Modem Standard Arabic (MSA) 
(Badawi's level two), have been the options of choice for almost all academic pro­
grams. As programs and curricula shifted toward the more communicative in the 1990s 
and as oral proficiency became a learning goal, MSA materials have been adapted to 
be more communicative in their orientation. However, the fact remains that MSA (and 
certainly CA) are neither spontaneously spoken languages nor authentic vehicles for 
spoken proficiency. A few programs (e.g., University of Michigan, Brigham Young 
University, Georgetown University) teach spoken vernacular Arabic (such as Levan­
tine or Egyptian) in addition to MSA. The choice of whether to teach ESA or FSA as a 
viable spoken medium for nonnative speakers has been discussed by Agius (1990), 

xviii 
Preface 
Badawi ( 1985), and Ryding (199 1, 1994, 1995). I advocate its value for learners who 
need a spoken medium of expression that can be used in a wide variety of places and 
situations. At Georgetown University, FSA is normally taught after a year of MSA 
study. 
This brings up an important point: Formal Spoken Arabic Basic Course with MP3 
Files is not intended for use by beginners for self-instruction. It assumes previous or 
parallel instruction in MSA and in Arabic script and phonology. Many college students 
who start out and stick with literary Arabic are discouraged by their inability to use 
authentic language for engaging in informal conversation with Arab friends and ac­
quaintances, so there is a need to take their conversational goals and skills into ac­
count. Sometimes, long-term curricula that focus on reading and writing skills will 
omit colloquial Arabic study altogether, with the old-fashioned justification that stu­
dents can "pick up" everyday speaking skills if or when they get a chance to study in 
an Arab country. It is important to recognize, however, that instructed development of 
primary discourse competence needs to be addressed if westerners seriously intend to 
progress to advanced and superior levels of proficiency. 
It has been my pleasure to work with my colleague Dr. David Mehall on revising 
this book, and I have him to thank for using his long experience teaching FSA to bring 
insights into the Arabic teaching and learning process.

The Arabic taught in this book enables students to communicate with educated speak­
ers of Arabic from across the globe. It is a response to the problem of diglossia, which 
is described in the introduction. It provides students of Modem Standard Arabic 
(MSA) with alternative speech patterns to the stilted literary language they encounter 
as novice learners of MSA. Generally, it can be taught alongside MSA in the first year, 
as has been the case for foreign language professionals in various government agen­
cies, or it can be introduced after the first, second, or third year of instruction of MSA, 
depending upon the intensity of the program. At Georgetown University, students have 
traditionally taken it after the first year prior to their departure for a semester abroad at 
the American University in Cairo. The primary benefit of the Formal Spoken Arabic 
(FSA) course is that it fills the gap that MSA is unable to fill when it comes to listen­
ing comprehension and speaking in the context of everyday functions, such as giving 
or receiving directions, making reservations, dealing with unexpected problems, or 
haggling over prices. In addition, it builds on the grammar and vocabulary found in 
any introductory MSA course, providing real-world use of verb morphology, such as 
imperatives and modals, and of noun patterns, such as colors, place names, and geo­
graphical terms. Finally, it serves as a viable introduction to any map of the Arab world 
course and prepares students for the task of interacting with both scripted and un­
scripted texts of media Arabic. FSA at Georgetown University has been offered as a 
non intensive, year-long course worth six credits per academic year or three credits per 
semester. 
I have personally taught from this book for more than ten years as I moved 
through the ranks from teaching assistant to senior lecturer in the Department of Ara­
bic Language, Literature, and Linguistics at Georgetown University. Staying abreast of 
the constantly chan,ging political scene across the Arab world can be a daunting task,

Preface 
but one made much easier thanks to WikipediA, a free-content, multilingual encyclopedia 
online found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wikilArabic_language, which I highly recommend. 
When teaching with Formal Spoken Arabic Basic Course with MP3 Files, I struc­
ture the course so that I can complete Lessons 1-8 in the first semester and Lessons 9-
16 in the second semester. For the matrix dialogues, I develop listening comprehension 
sheets so that the students can derive the greatest benefit from the experience. Students 
sometimes voice concern that they are not given the full written text of the matrix dia­
logues. I often complement these listening activities with news clips from al-Jazeera 
and, once again, I assign students specific listening exercises without giving them the 
full transcript of the text. I have found that such listening comprehension tasks are part 
of the everyday experience of the language leamer, and students are quickly convinced 
of their utility as they move through the course. As a certified ACTFL OPI tester for 
Arabic, I can attest that after an academic year in this course, students can attain ele­
mentary and intermediate proficiency levels as a direct result of the drills and the 
speaking and listening comprehension tasks in this book. This course helps build the 
communicative competence students need to willingly interact with native speakers 
with confidence.

Preface to the first edition 
The original version of this text was prepared during the years that I was head of Ara­
bic language training at the Foreign Service Institute ( 1980-85) to serve as the core for 
the first twenty-two weeks of the Formal Spoken Arabic course. It was field-tested at 
every stage of its development for clarity, effectiveness and relevance to the needs of 
Americans working in the Arab world. 
The approach is based on my teaching experience as well as findings from the 
field of second language acquisition research. It is designed to foster communicative 
competence in Arabic on all levels, and to develop speaking proficiency without aban­
doning Arabic script. 
Formal Spoken Arabic: Basic Course is, as far as I know, the first Arabic language 
text to use a nongrammar-based approach. That is, the rationale for its organization and 
presentation of language materials is functional and situational rather than grammati­
cally determined. Grammar is, of course, covered in each lesson but it serves the ends 
of the situations or functions being taught rather than motivating the structure of the 
course. 
It differs from other basic Arabic texts in that it teaches a form of spoken Arabic 
that is closer to the written standard, and is the first spoken Arabic text to use Arabic 
script instead of transcription to represent the sounds of spoken Arabic. One of the in­
cidental (but not unintended) results of using Arabic script from the beginning of spo­
ken Arabic training at FSI was reinforcement and improvement of overall reading 
skills. There was a substantial increase in student reading proficiency scores after in­
troduction of this text, even though reading proficiency is, of course, tested in Modem 
Standard Arabic (MSA). 
This text is not meant to replace any of the excellent and time-tested texts for 
MSA, since it does not deal with the same variety of language. It may, however, in 
combination with MSA, serve academic Arabic departments as a tool for increasing 
spoken Arabic skills at the elementary and intermediate levels, an important considera­
tion in today's proficiency-oriented world.

Acknowledgments to the second edition 
I am deeply grateful for the cooperation, enthusiasm, and input of many Formal Spo­
ken Arabic students at Georgetown over the past 15 years, and to the faculty members 
who have taught this course, Dr. Amin Bonnah, Dr. David Mehall, and Dr. Elizabeth 
Bergman. Their insights, feedback, and support for this innovative text have been es­
sential to its success in an academic setting. 
In particular, I wish to thank Dr. Mehall for his unstinting efforts in revising and 
reformatting the text for this second edition, and I also wish to thank the editorial and 
production team at Georgetown University Press who have made this second edition 
possible. My appreciation also goes to Gail Grella, associate director of Georgetown 
University Press, whose constant support and encouragement have made a great differ­
ence not only to this book, but to all the publications in the Georgetown Classics in 
Arabic Language and Linguistics series.

Introduction 
This text is designed to serve as core material for the first six months of intensive spo­
ken Arabic training at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI), U.S. Department of State. 
Students of Arabic are generally enrolled at FSI for twenty-four or fourty-four weeks, 
after which some may go on to further training at the Arabic Field School, while others 
proceed directly to posts in the Arab world. About two-thirds of student time at FSI is 
devoted to studying the spoken language and one-third to studying the literary lan­
guage (MSA). Besides covering this and other FSI text material, students engage in 
simulation activities, field trips, and content-based language activities built around 
substantive regional topics. So this text is by no means the entire course but provides 
continuity to spoken Arabic training. On several counts, this text represents a departure 
from traditional spoken Arabic instruction. 
1. Design. It is tailored to the specific needs of foreign affairs personnel serving the 
U.S. government abroad, focusing on practical communicative tasks in meaningful 
contexts. The organizing principle behind the lessons is, therefore, not presentation of 
grammatical points, but functions within situations. Basic dialogues, for example, al­
ways involve an American and an Arab, rather than Arabs only and embody types of 
exchanges likely to occur under various circumstances. Grammar points are discussed 
and drilled as they arise and as they relate to the communicative needs of a situation. 
2. Language. The Arab world is characterized by a linguistic phenomenon known as 
diglossia, meaning that the spoken and written languages are substantially different. 
The literary language has essentially retained the lexical and grammatical features of 
classical Arabic, and is uniform from one Arab country to another. Spoken Arabic has 
been much less codified and more pliant, adapting quickly to the everyday needs of 
colloquial speech, incorporating foreign words, reducing grammatical categories, and 
evolving into regional dialects characteristic of specific geographical areas. Most of 
these dialects are mutually intelligible to native speakers, but some widely separated 
ones diverge considerably from each other. The issue of which variety of spoken lan­
guage to teach foreigners has therefore been a thorny one, with little choice between 
teaching a spoken fOrm of literary Arabic or one specific dialect. 

xxvi 
Introduaion 
At FSI, students are trained in communicative skills to serve them in a variety of 
posts in the Arab world. Feedback from officers in the field has consistently and 
strongly advocated the need for spoken Arabic skills that can be used widely through­
out the Middle East. Experience has shown that the most practical language to teach 
foreign affairs personnel going to the Arab East (excluding Egypt, the Sudan, and 
North Africa) is a standardized variant of spoken Arabic, colloquial enough not to 
sound pedantic and flexible enough to be of use throughout the Arab East. 
The language described and taught in this text is not a spoken dialect of a specific 
Arab region. Within the continuum of spoken Arabic variants, registers, and styles it is 
an intermediate language which embodies characteristics of interdialectal communica­
tion, as well as aspects of the standard literary language, and which has proven ex­
tremely useful to Foreign Service Officers assigned to various posts in the Arab world. 
Although pronunciation and internal vowelization of Formal Spoken Arabic (FSA) 
reflect the conventions of literary Arabic, shared dialect features constitute the core of 
FSA (lexical items such as rah, jab, mish and lazim, and morphological features such 
as elimination of case and mood inflections). Where dialects diverge and choices of 
everyday vocabulary items had to be made (e.g., the choices for "what" and "now), 
Levantine terms were chosen. Teachers may of course modify these items or offer 
other options. 
This language variant has come to be known as FSA through the years it has been 
taught at the FSI, both in Washington and in the field schools in Beirut and Tunis. It is 
formal because it is a slightly higher, more "educated" register than everyday speech, 
and also because pronunciation of consonants and internal vowelization of words are 
done for the most part in accord with literary Arabic. Moreover, the overall structure 
and function of this variety has been observed as the type of dialect-bridging discourse 
used among native Arabic speakers from different dialect regions on occasions when 
they interact. 
Limited linguistic research has been done into the actual structure of interdialectal, 
formalized or noncolloquial spoken Arabic discourse, and consequently the elements 
of the variety of Arabic presented in this text result to a large extent from the insights 
and intuitions of educated native speakers who form the staff of instructors at the For­
eign Service Institute, both in Washington and abroad. It is their pioneering efforts and 
the distillation of years of experience in language training which have resulted in the 
consolidation of this extremely pragmatic and adaptable form of spoken Arabic. 
3. Script. Another feature of this text, which makes it a departure from most text­
books of spoken Arabic, is that it uses Arabic script rather than transliteration. Student 
reaction to the early introduction of script has been overwhelmingly enthusiastic. It not 
only prevents the inevitable pitfalls of learning a transcription system which must then 
be abandoned, but also reinforces student grasp and eventual command of the written 
language. 

Introduction 
xxvii 
4. Approach. As a consequence of the decision to use Arabic script, the introductory 
lessons are designed and taught in such a way as to allow students gradual, systematic 
access to the sounds and script. This is accomplished in four ways: 
(1) Comprehension first 
Before requiring students to speak in Arabic, a groundwork of listening and reading 
comprehension is built, on the theory that comprehension precedes and provides a 
foundation for later production. The first five lessons of this text are designed to build 
comprehension skills by beginning with very partial recognition tasks, forming a reser­
voir of lexical and grammatical information for the student to draw on. 
(2) Delayed oral production 
Having decided to initiate the student through reading and listening Arabic, oral pro­
duction is not required during the first five lessons of the text. This does not mean that 
it doesn't happen; it frequently does, precisely because students are not under pressure 
to produce fully formed, precise utterances. Nor does it mean they are passive recipi­
ents of data. Students must react to what they see and hear in various ways, as ex­
plained in the Student's Notes section and in the various drills and other exercises in­
cluded in each lesson. 
(3) Semantic load 
Consistent with the above concept of avoiding overload, the major portion of vocabu­
lary in the first part of the text is semantically "transparent, " i.e., it is based largely on 
proper names-of people, places, and things. These names are already familiar to most 
students, such as heads of government and geographical descriptions that include 
names of cities, countries, and major landforms. The content of these lessons is there­
fore informative and easy to access semantically, so that students have a chance to see 
and hear authentic data in Arabic that is familiar to them. They can therefore focus 
most of their energies on the way these data look or sound, while at the same time ac­
cumulating or reinforcing basic facts about the Arab world. 
(4) Concurrent instruction 
During the initial phase of this text, Arabic students at FSI spend one-third of their day 
working on it, another third in the language laboratory, and the last one-third working 
with McCaurus and Rammuny's A Programmed Course in Modern Written Arabic 
Phonology and Script. Thus they work their way simultaneously through two texts, 
this one that focuses on comprehension and gradual mastery of substantial amounts of 
information in Arabic, and another which is designed to give them pronunciation, read­
ing, and writing skills in a highly structured, incremental way. During the time they 
spend with A Programmed Course, they are engaged in traditional activities such as 
pronunciation drills, reading aloud (chorally and individually), learning to write the 

xxviii 
Introduction 
Arabic alphabet, and dictation drills. Homework assignments include both writing and 
listening exercises. By the end of three weeks (about thirty hours of instruction in each 
text), students have finished A Programmed Course as well as the first seven lessons 
of Formal Spoken Arabic Basic Course with MP3 Files. 
At this point they are ready to switch to the second stage of the course, Lessons 9-
16, which are centered around tasks and situations in spoken Arabic. In addition to a 
basic dialogue followed by discussion, drilling of vocabulary and salient grammatical 
points, these lessons include overheard conversations (matrix dialogues) which are on 
CD, structured speaking activities designed to help students develop conversational 
coping skills and strategies. Experienced teachers will doubtless recognize types of 
activities they already incorporate into their classes, but detailed instructions are pro­
vided for each exercise in both Modern Standard Arabic and English to describe proce­
dures that have been useful and successful in field testing this material. 
TEACHER'S NOTES 
Lessons 1-6. You will find the approach used in Lessons 1-6 very different from 
traditional grammar/translation or audio-lingual approaches. Underpinning these les­
sons is an assumption that learners can internalize language faster if they are not pres­
sured or required initially to produce it. This initial phase, which is called "a compre­
hension phase," therefore resembles language acquisition in a natural setting and is 
designed to take advantage of the natural human ability to "take in" language before 
generating it. 
It is important to realize, however, that the learners in the comprehension phase are 
not being passive recipients, but are called upon to respond to what they hear and see 
in various ways, either through physical actions (such as pointing or writing a number 
instead of an Arabic word), or through response in English. If some students want to 
use Arabic for their responses sooner than Lesson 7, that is perfectly acceptable, but it 
is important for the long-term effectiveness of this approach that target language pro­
duction by the learner not be forced. 
Instructions. Instructions for exercises and drills are provided both in English and in 
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in all lessons so that students get used to seeing MSA 
as an instructional language, and so that less-experienced Arabic teachers can be clear 
as to the procedures for the exercise. The vocabulary used in the instructions is not 
included in the glossaries but teachers should feel free to help students understand the 
Arabic instructions and to use them as additional learning tools. 
Moreover, experienced teachers will note that instructions for practicing verb 
paradigms and for dialogue rehearsal, memorization, and variation are very explicit. 
These are intended to guide less-experienced teachers and to focus on the need for 
structured exercises in addition to and as a basis for more meaningful and communica­
tive activities. 

Introduction 
xxix 
Meaningful use, tasks, and speaking activities. In addition to the many standard 
drills provided in this text, the tasks and speaking exercises are designed to practice the 
implementation of language skills in semistructured environments where students are 
expected to use Arabic for problem solving, for informing, and for other basic commu­
nicative purposes. Audio for matrix and basic dialogues, along with various drills, are 
provided as MP3 files on the accompanying CD. Each place in the text with a corre­
sponding audio portion is indicated with an image of a set of headphones. The steps 
involved in the speaking activities may seem very familiar and even obvious to experi­
enced teachers but are provided as models for new teachers and also as bases for fur­
ther activities, designed and initiated by teachers and/or students. Matrix dialogues are 
not intended for total comprehension but rather as holistic listening experiences that 
provide a meaningful context for the lesson content. 
What this text does. This text was designed to provide a central core around which 
to build a proficiency-based spoken Arabic course. It is not and should not be the total­
ity of a course but rather a framework for developing spoken Arabic skills. Teachers 
should feel free to incorporate vocabulary, realia, exercises, and other activities geared 
to their students' particular learning goals. For a variety of drills and exercises, teach­
ers may find it useful to employ Cuisenaire rods or "Algebricks." Cuisenaire rods are 
colored blocks of various sizes used in a variety of applications in teaching mathematical 
and linguistic concepts. They are available online at http://www.etacuisenaire.com and 
on other sites, such as eBay.com. There are also many web sites that discuss the appli­
cation and uses of the colored rods in the classroom. 
STUDENT'S NOTES 
Contents. We are basing this course on two assumptions: 
A 1. It should help you to get ready for life and work at post. 
A2. What you learn will help you practice. 
Our conclusion from these assumptions is: 
C l .  What you practice should be-more closely and more frequently than in 
many language courses-related to what you will be doing overseas. 
Skills. We make three further assumptions: 
A3. Right now you know little or no Arabic . 
.. 
A4. By the end of the course you will know quite a bit of Arabic. 
AS. Even with all the Arabic you are going to learn here, you'll find at post that 
the Arabs still use a lot more ofthe language than you know. 

xxx 
Introduaion 
From these assumptions we draw two conclusions: 
C2. We should teach you (or help you to learn) a lot of Arabic. 
C3. We should help you to develop your natural ability to deal with language that 
is over your head. 
Overall design. This course consists of a series of stages. Each stage in its own way 
will be consistent with the above assumptions and conclusions. In the first few weeks, 
you will become familiar with the writing system and the pronunciation of Arabic. 
Once you have begun to be comfortable with the mechanics of making sounds and 
writing them down, you will work with increasingly close and full simulations of what 
you will be doing in the Middle East. 
The first stage. In line with C l ,  the content goal of the first stage will be to teach 
you-or to verify what you already know-some fundamental facts about geography 
and politics of the Arab world. 
The linguistic goal of stage 1 will be to ensure that you can understand and talk 
about this information in Arabic. 
Our third conclusion (C3) is the basis for a feature that may be new to you but that 
we think you will enjoy. At the beginning of each lesson, before the teaching material, 
you will find short segments of conversation between two Arabs-conversation which 
is completely natural, with no simplification or slowing down for the benefit of for­
eigners. Your task with regard to these segments will not be to reproduce them or even 
to understand them but only to explore and develop in certain specific ways your abil­
ity to cope with the language. 
Stage 1 consists of seven lessons. 
During the first five lessons you are not required to say anything in Arabic. There is a 
reason for this. We want your brain to take in many, many examples of each of the 
sounds of the language. Further, we want these multiple exposures to gel into a set of 
auditory and visual composites, on which you will draw when called upon to pro­
nounce Arabic in Lesson 6. For most people, premature oral production in a new lan­
guage seems to interfere with this gelling process. Hence, the silence of your first few 
days. But silence doesn't mean inactivity. Indeed, if you are to learn anything, you 
need to do something. What we are asking you to do during the first five lessons, 
therefore, is to comprehend what you hear or see and then react accordingly. 
Stage 1 lessons: 
1. Matrix dialogue. The lesson opens with a recorded conversation between two Ar­
abs. This conversation includes an exchange of information on the same general topic 

Introduaion 
xxxi 
that you will be working with for the rest of the lesson. For this reason, we have called 
this conversation the matrix dialogue for this lesson. 
Because this conversation is an unrestricted exchange between two native speak­
ers, you will be unable to react to it as language students are usually expected to react 
to new material-by understanding it, repeating, drilling on it, and so forth. You will 
therefore be thrown back on your general resources. We suggest that you follow this 
procedure: 
1. 1. Play the conversation once. Listen for sex and age of the speakers, and try to 
guess such things as their relationship (father and son? professor and student? 
friends? strangers?), the subject matter (information about air travel? an oral 
examination? discussion of whether to buy a new book? discussion of recent 
events?), and the tone (informative? joking? mildly critical or argumentative? 
astonished?). 
1.2. Play the conversation a second time in order to change or confirm your 
guesses. 
1.3. Compare your guesses with those of your classmates. 
104. Listen to the conversation a third time. 
1.5. Check your guesses with the instructor. Don't be alarmed if some of them 
tum out to have been based on misinterpretations. This is one first step to­
ward clarifying your perception of spoken Arabic. Don't ask your instructor 
to translate the conversation for you. That's not the point. 
1.6. Now that you know a little more about the conversation, listen to it once 
more. 
This work with the matrix dialogue should take somewhere between fifteen and 
twenty minutes. At the end of the time, you will have: 
• begun to get a feeling for what Arabic sounds like in real life (a very gen­
eral contribution to C l ); 
• heard a few familiar words as they are pronounced in Arabic (a first step 
towards C2); 
• had a bit of experience with responding to what you can hear, rather than 
focusing on what you can't understand (an example of C3). 
2. Basic information. In the matrix dialogue, we deliberately overload you by giving 
you material that you couldn't possibly follow. We've already explained our reasons 
for doing that. But if you are to learn anything in this lesson, you must meet one item 
at a time. We must give you material in which you can identify everything that you 
hear so that you can begin to master it. This is the purpose of the central parts of the 

xxxii 
Introduaion 
lesson. The basic information section consists of a short narrative. This paragraph con­
tains the facts which you will need in the drill and "meaningful use" which follow it. 
A suggested procedure with this section is: 
2.1. Listen to the basic information. Jot down, in the order in which they occur, 
any names of persons or places that you recognize. Leave blanks for the parts 
you don't understand. Repeat this step two or three times until you think 
you've found everything you are going to. (Don't repeat anything aloud at 
this time.) 
2.2. Compare notes with your classmates. 
2.3. In collaboration with your classmates, try to guess the meanings ofthe sen-
tences and missing words. Fill in any blanks that you can. 
2.4. Listen to the paragraph again to see if your guesses make sense. 
2.5. Check your guesses with your instructor. 
2.6. Now that you know the meaning of the text, listen to it two or three more 
times, just to let the words sink in. 
This activity should take between 15 and 25 minutes. At the end of that time, you 
will have: 
• dealt with content which, though rudimentary, is still relevant to your job 
(C1); 
• clearly identified all the words in the paragraph (C2); 
• in steps a-d, further practiced your coping skills (C3). 
3. Grammar notes. Obviously, as you go about learning Arabic you will need to 
know how the language works. The grammar notes in each lesson describe in fairly 
nontechnical terms the structures and rules that come up in the basic information part 
of the lesson. It is a good idea to read the grammar notes before you do the drills. 
4. Drills, exercises, activities, and tasks. The drills in the first five lessons have been 
designed to draw on your comprehension or recognition skills. In each drill you will be 
expected to respond according to the instructions, based on your knowledge of Arabic 
up to that point, but you do not have to respond in Arabic. 
In the "meaningful use" exercises you will find a few simple opportunities to re­
spond to words with physical actions, since in life outside the classroom we frequently 
respond to words with actions, and to actions with words. 
In the "task" section of the lesson you will be asked to apply what you have 
learned to a simple language-use task, thus implementing your knowledge for a spe­
cific purpose.

OVERVIEW 
In this lesson you are exposed mainly to names of people and places in Arabic. Arabic 
script is used but you are not expected to be able to read it just yet. It will be helpful 
for you to look at the script as you listen to your teacher and the CD and begin to get 
a feel for the sizes and shapes of words, most of whose meanings are already familiar 
to you. You are expected to manipulate the material in this lesson in various ways, 
as explained in the Student's Notes section and in the drills. Please read this section 
before you start the lesson to get a better understanding of your approach to these 
materials.

GRAMMAR NOTES 
I. Equational sentences 
One of the most basic sentence types in Arabic is of the "topic-comment" kind, where 
no verb is used. You may have heard in grammar school that no sentences can exist 
without a verb. That's true for English, but not for Arabic, because Arabic does not 
usually use a lexical equivalent for the verb "to be" in the present tense. Instead, it usu­
ally introduces a "topic" or "subject" and then adds a "comment" or "predicate." 
The topic is usually some type of substantive-a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase. 
The comment can be a wide range of things-an adjective, prepositional phrase, or 
another noun, for example. 
In this lesson the equational sentences are primarily of the type where there is a 
name and then a prepositional phrase. There are examples of these sentences in the 
basic information section and the drills ofthis lesson, e.g.: 
Prince Abdallah (is) from Saudi Arabia . 
. RU yo-JI if 11 -¥-p-\l1 
What is said in Arabic is, literally, "Prince Abdallah from Saudi Arabia." The "is" 
is understood. More examples: 
II. 
Use of ) "and" 
Bashar AI-Asad (is) from Syria . 
. 4.Jr if ..\....\11 .JL:., 
Where (is) Lebanon? 
0 J.) 
A list of Arab leaders is given in the basic information part of this lesson, each name 
(after the first) preceded by "and." In English "and" is not used so often, but in Arabic 
"and" is used the way we would use a comma. It is also used to start many sentences, 
which is generally not done in English.

LESSON O N E  
III. Definite article 
A. Use in names 
The definite article in Arabic is JI. It is written as part of the word it defines. Thus, 
"the Iraq," "the Kuwait." Certain Arabic place names and names of people have the 
definite article and others do not, just as we say "the Sudan" and "Egypt." For example: 
Names with definite a rticle 
Jordan 
0.:> J '}I 
Kuwait 
..:..:j:JI 
Saudi Arabia 
AI-Ahmad 
AI-Asad 
Names without definite article 
Egypt 
M 
Lebanon 
0 
Syria 
4Jy 
Emil 
J:.-I 
Husni 
 
Bear in mind that proper nouns, with or without the definite article, are sem­
antically definite. There is no hard and fast rule as to which proper nouns have the 
definite article and which do not, so the only way to learn them is through memorization. 
B. Pronunciation 
The definite article is pronounced al-, el-, il- or sometimes just 1-. When the definite 
article precedes certain sounds, the 1- is not pronounced. It is assimilated into the fol­
lowing sound and that sound, as a result, "doubles" or becomes stronger. For example, 
the name of Saudi Arabia is pronounced as-saCudiyya in Arabic, doubling the s sound 
instead of pronouncing the 1-. 
The sounds or letters that assimilate the 1- of the definite article are called sun let­
ters (hurufshamsiyya) and include: 
There is no indefinite article ("a" or "an") in literary Arabic.

Cities and Countries 
In this lesson you will see and hear more names of places in the Arab world, including, 
this time, cities as well as countries. You will also be exposed to some other words: a 
couple of pronouns ("he" and "she"), and the words for the various systems of govern­
ment in the Arab countries ("kingdom " "republic " "state " "sultanate " and "emirate")

Additionally, you will find the words for "city" and "capital." 
In Lesson one you had the question words "who" and "where." In this lesson you 
will have the question word "what." 
The approach used in this lesson parallels that of lesson one. Again, listen to your 
teacher and the CD as you look at the script to get an idea of how the words look and 
how they fit together in sentences.

GRAMMAR NOTES 
I. Equational sentences 
This lesson contains more equational sentences (sentences without an overt verb). All 
the sentences in the basic information section are equational. 
Jordan (is) a kingdom . 
. a.S:u 0U J ':JI 
Egypt (is) a republic. 
'RJT M 
These sentences (from Part A) all consist of the name of a country followed by a 
word identifying its political system. Both words are nouns. The first is definite, the 
second indefinite. Put together in this order, they make a sentence. 
In Part B of the basic information section, the sentences are still equational, but 
with the difference that both parts (the topic and the comment) are defmite, e.g., 
"Amman is the capital of Jordan." Because both parts are definite, the break between 
them is normally "marked" by the insertion of a pronoun that agrees in gender (either 
masculine or feminine) with the subject (or topic) of the sentence. In all of the 
sentences of part B, the subjects are feminine (they are names of cities, and all cities 
are considered feminine), so the pronoun used is "she"-Ņ. For a masculine subject 
the pronoun would be "he"-r. This wiJI come up in the following lesson.) 

1 4  
LESSON TWO 
II. Gender 
All nouns in Arabic have inherent gender. They are either masculine or feminine. In 
general, feminine nouns end with an a sound and are spelled with a tii' marbu(a (0) at 
the end of the word. 
republic 
III. 
The "construct" phrase (a.;Lp':J1) 
capital 
city 
The most common way of expressing a relationship between two things (especially 
possessive) in Arabic is by constructing the two nouns together by placing one after 
the other. The first noun is seen as being constructed or annexed to the second, so that 
expressions such as "the city of Beirut" or "the capital of Egypt" are literally, in Ara­
bic, "city Beirut" and "capital Egypt." 
the capital of Jordan 
the city of Cairo 
Two basic rules about this kind of structure are: 
a. The first term of the construct never has the definite article, but it is considered 
definite if it is followed by a definite noun. 
b. If the first term is a feminine word ending in an I-a! sound and spelled with a final 
tii' marbu(a (0), I-tl is pronounced after the vowel.

In this lesson you will be introduced to the official titles of heads of state of Arab 
countries (king, president, sultan, prince, sheikh), a few more names of heads of states, 
and some new grammatical features. The structure of the lesson remains the same, 
with a matrix dialogue, basic information, drills, meaningful use exercises and tasks. 
You are still to focus only on the shapes and sounds of words and how they are strung 
together in sentences. You are not expected to be able to pronounce them out loud or 
write them yet, but you are expected to be able to manipulate this material in various 
ways, as instructed in the drills, exercises, and tasks.

LESSON THREE 
I. 
Use of  and  
A.  is a preposition meaning "in " or "at" 
Beirut is in Lebanon. 
.0ń  U)ft 
The king is in the capital. 
..WI  dill 
B.  is an adverb meaning "there is " or "there are" 
In Jordan there is a king. 
.Y  0) ':YI J 
There is a president in Syria. 
Is there, in Egypt, a president? 
.u-J) lUY-"   
Yu-J)    
-
Although these two words sound very much alike, the vowel of  is often 
shortened in nonnal speech, whereas the vowel of  stays long. 
II. Equational sentences 
All of the sentences in the basic infonnation part of this lesson are equational. In part 
A, the sentences are of two types: 
In Kuwait is a prince . 
. p.-ol /0I  
In Kuwait there is a prince . 
. p.-ol  /0I  
These two sentence types are equivalent in meaning and both types are common in 
spoken Arabic. 
In this kind of equational sentence, the "topic" or "subject" is the last word and 
the "comment" or "predicate" is the first phrase, e.g., /0I  "in Kuwait." The prep­
ositional phrase comes first in these sentences because the topic or subject is 
indefinite. That is, the topic noun does not have the definite article nor is it the first 
tenn of a construct. There is a general rule in Arabic that if the subject of an equational 
sentence is indefinite, it cannot start the sentence. Thus, if one says, "The prince is in 
Kuwait," the Arabic equivalent would be: /0I  p.-o ':YI. But if one is speaking about 
a prince in Kuwait, the Arabic sentence has to start with "in Kuwait:" p.-ol /0I . 

Official Titles 
25 
English has a similar rule, only one avoids sentences, such as, "A prince is in 
Kuwait," by prefacing "there is" to the indefinite subject, and making, "There is a 
prince in Kuwait." 
In Parts B and C of the basic information section, the equational sentences are of 
the type where both parts (subject and predicate) are definite, so they are separated by 
a pronoun (in this case Y' "he"). 
III. The construct phrase 
In Lesson 2 you learned about the "construct" phrase, where two nouns are related to 
each other by being placed next to each other. 
In this lesson in the exercises that deal with using pictures, there is a construct 
phrase consisting of the word "picture" (;; JrP ) plus a name of a person, meaning "the 
picture of ___ " 
Examples 
the picture ofHusni Mubarak 
the capital of the Sudan 
the city of Cairo 
.!.I L.. , '-.>- ;; 
 
J , 
'-:?' 
JJO 
0b..,..JI \s. 
;;̚\.A.JI t...Lo 
In addition to these simple constructs, you are introduced to a "complex" 
construct, consisting of three nouns, as seen in Part C. 
King Abdallah is the king of the kingdom of Jordan . 
. 4J̖ J"il a5:u clLo ·I  &1 
So, where English uses "of' to link these nouns together, Arabic "constructs" the 
nouns together in a string. It is possible (though not too common) to construct a whole 
string of nouns together. For example: 
the brother of the wife of the king of 
the kingdom of Jordan 
-

26 
LESSO N THREE 
In general, wherever English links nouns together with "of' or the possessive 
"'s" ("Husni Mubarak's picture," "Jordan's king"), the equivalent structure in Arabic is 
the construct. 
A basic rule for the construct (no matter how many terms or nouns it has) is: Only 
the last noun in the string can have the definite article. 
IV. Noun plurals 
There are several nouns in the vocabulary of this lesson followed, in parentheses, by 
their plural forms. As you can see and hear, the plural differs substantially from the 
singular. It contains the same consonants, but the vowels are differently distributed. 
This kind of plural is called the "internal" or "broken" plural, and is a feature of many

LESSON THREE 
A WORD ABOUT TASKS 
In these lessons we take you from unrestricted and authentic Arabic (the matrix 
dialogue) to Arabic which is informative but highly simplified (the basic information 
section), so as to familiarize you with some rudiments of the language itself (the 
drills). Then we begin (meaningful use) to bring you back from that heavy 
concentration on linguistic form. We want to end the lessons by putting you back in 
contact with the Arabic you will meet in the Arab world. 
In these task activities you play the role of U.S. government employee or 
dependent who is listening to a newscast or to Arabs talking to each other. You are 
trying to get as much information as possible out of the conversation or the broadcast, 
even though your knowledge of the language is limited. In the first two lessons, we 
asked you to listen for specific things in the tasks: names, places, and systems of 
government. In the following task, listen to the newscast and try to see how many 
familiar items you can identify, both by listening and then by looking at the text. 
Compare notes with your classmates, but don't bother trying to figure out any more of 
the broadcast. 
This activity will probably take 20-25 minutes. Notice that we are now back to a 
fairly even balance among C l ,  C2, and C3, as discussed in the Student's Notes section 
of the introduction. 
g TASK 
4.fl.1 
In this task you have a news broadcast on the CD and a copy of the Arabic text of the 
broadcast to look at. Listen to the CD with your teacher at least a couple of times 
without trying to follow the written text. When you feel ready, listen and try to follow 
along while reading. When you come across a word in the text that is familiar, 
underline it. Then listen once again. Your teacher will go over this material in class. 
Check your underlinings with the teacher.

Geography 
OVERVIEW 
This lesson deals with geography. In it you will be able to work with maps, directions, 
and place names. You will also be introduced to the names of major land forms and 
bodies of water, especially those located in the Arab world. You are still required only 
to try to recognize the written words by looking at them and by hearing them pro­
nounced on the CD and by your teacher. 
It may seem that there is much more vocabulary in this lesson than in previous 
ones, but most of the new words are names of places and things that you already know. 
" MATRIX DIALOGUE 
Listen to the matrix dialogue and then discuss it with your teacher.

A Lesson in Geography 
There are seas, gulfs, rivers, valleys, deserts, islands, and mountains in the Arab world. 
For example, the Arabian Gulf is east of the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf of Aqaba 
is south of Jordan. The Mediterranean Sea is between North Africa and Europe, and 
the Red Sea is between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The Suez Canal, in Egypt, links the 
Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. The Arabian Sea is southeast of the Arabian Pen­
insula, and between the Arabian Sea and the Arabian Gulf are the Straits of Hormuz 
and the Gulf of Oman. 
As for rivers and valleys, there is the Nile River in the Sudan and Egypt, the Eu­
phrates River in Syria and Iraq, and the Jordan River in Jordan. The Nile Valley and 
the Valley of the Kings are in Egypt. 
The deserts of the Arab world include the Sinai Desert in Egypt, the Nafud Desert 
in Saudi Arabia, and the Sahara in North Africa. The Arab world is known for its many 
deserts. 

Geography 
37 
Among the islands in the Arab world are the island of Bahrain in the Arabian Gulf, 
an island named Masira in the Arabian Sea, and the island of Socotra in the Gulf of 
Aden. 
There are many mountains in Lebanon, among which is a famous one named Mt. 
Hermon. In western Saudi Arabia is another famous mountain named Mt. Arafat, and 
between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean is a famous mountain called jabal 
(iiriq (Gibraltar).

GRAMMAR NOTES 
I. Adjectives 
In this lesson you are introduced to adjectives and noun-adjective phrases. Unlike 
nouns, adjectives do not have inherent gender. They are flexible, and change to reflect 
the gender of the noun they are with. Adjectives are said to "modify" or describe 
nouns. In Arabic, the adjectives have to agree with whatever nouns they modify in 
gender (masculine or feminine), number (singular or plural), and definiteness (definite 
or indefinite). 
For example, here are some noun-adjective phrases, both masculine and feminine, 
definite and indefinite (singular): 
Masculine indefinite 
a famous river 
a northern sea 
an Arab name 
Feminine indefinite 
a famous island 
a northern desert 
an Arab city

Adjectives modifying nonhuman plural nouns are feminine singular. 
II. Nisba adjectives 
There are two basic types of adjectives in Arabic. One is inherently an adjective (such 
as po$' "large") and the other is a "derived" type of adjective. That is, it is made into an 
adjective from a noun (such as "northern"-derived from the noun "north"). 
The process of forming an adjective from a noun in Arabic involves adding a yii" 
(("S) to the end of the word, which gives it an i sound on the end.

The ("S -i- sound is actually a "double" ("S, that is, ("S with a shadda () on it. This 
shadda is not generally pronounced in spoken Arabic. The feminine form of the above 
adjectives is written with a tii" marbuta (0) at the end, after the ("S. In the feminine 
form, the shadda on the ("S is heard, so that these words end with the sound -iyya.

Adjectives that are derived in this way from nouns are called nisba adjectives. 
III. Place names 
There are many place names in this lesson. Some of them are structured as noun­
adjective phrases and others are construct phrases.

Just as in English, Arabic has possessive pronouns as well as subject pronouns. You 
have already seen "he" and "she." In this lesson you have "his" and "her." 
The distinctive thing about possessive pronouns in Arabic is that they are suffixes. 
That is, they are attached at the end of the word. It's like saying in English: "name-his" 
instead of "his name." Here are some examples:

OVERVIEW 
In this lesson you are introduced to plural forms of nouns, more noun-adjective 
phrases and construct phrases, as well as two verbs and the negative particle mish. You 
will be asked to use your knowledge of Arabic numbers for the meaningful use part of 
the lesson. 
As in the previous four lessons, you are asked to try to understand the Arabic 
words and sentences that you see and hear, but you are not expected to produce these 
words in spoken or written forms yet. 
After this lesson will come two review lessons that will go over the material cov­
ered in the first five lessons and add more names of people and places. In these review 
lessons you will be expected to do some writing and speaking in Arabic. 
" MATRIX DIALOGUE 
Listen to the matrix dialogue on the CD and then discuss it with your teacher.

English version 
There are kingdoms, republics, states, and emirates in the Arab world. Egypt is a re­
public. Its official name during the time of the government of Gamal Adbul Nasser 
was the United Arab Republic. Then its name became the Arab Republic of Egypt. 
Among the Arab kingdoms are Saudi Arabia and Jordan. The official name of 
Saudi Arabia is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (the Saudi Arabian Kingdom), because 
the ruling family is of the House of Ibn Saud. The official name of Jordan is the 
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (the Hashemite Jordanian Kingdom), because King Ab­
dallah is a Hashemite, from the Hashemite family. King Abdallah is Jordanian but the 
wife of the king is not from Jordan. She is a Palestinian from Kuwait and her name is 
Rania and she has become Jordanian.

In the previous lesson it was noted that adjectives can be formed from nouns by adding 
the suffix ȇ. The nouns used to illustrate this process were names of directions, but the 
nisba can be used on any noun to create an adjective. For example: 
main, chief ȅ) 
..r-J) 
president 
royal 
J-1. 
Y 
king 
Iiashemite 
.j"u.

LESSON FIVE 
Certain proper nouns, especially names of places, must be "stripped" before the t.? 
is added. The defmite article tii" marbuta and final alif are things hat must be removed 
to create the nisba adjective:

Iraqi 
American

Palestinian 
Libyan

As noted in Lesson 3, many nouns and adjectives have "broken" or "internal" plurals. 
In addition to the broken plural, however, there are also "sound" or "regular" plurals 
that take the form of suffixes. 
A. The sound masculine plural 
This form of plural is used on certain masculine nouns and adjectives and consists of 
the suffix J.-:

J..JQ

0!:!:> Y'"'" 
t.?:> Y'"'"

B. The sound feminine plural 
Many feminine nouns take the sound feminine plural (ul-), as well as all adjectives 
that refer to female human beings. (Note that it replaces the tii" marbu!a.) Even certain 
masculine nouns are made plural with ul.

Knowing which kind of plural a noun or adjective uses is not easy to predict. For 
now, it is best to memorize the plural forms along with the singular. From this lesson 
on, plurals will be indicated in parentheses after a noun or adjective. The sound mascu­
line plural will be noted as (:.r.!-), and the sound feminine plural as (ul-). Adjectives 
will be cited in the shortest form, the masculine singular. 
III. 
Word order 
As you have seen, Arabic adjectives follow the noun they modify. That is, one says 
in Arabic "the sea the red" f'JI I instead of "the Red Sea," or "a president 
famous" .JŃ V.J instead of "a famous president." This applies to all nouns unless 
they are the first term of a construct phrase. 
One of the rules about construct phrases is that they consist only of nouns. Adjec­
tives do not interrupt the "linking" of nouns together in the construct phrase. This 
means that (as in the basic information section of this lesson) when there is a phrase 
such as, "the official name of Jordan," one does not say something like "the name the 
official of Jordan." One has to say (literally) "the name of Jordan the official" t"'l 
ĳ)I 0.J '11. That is, the adjective comes only after the noun construct phrase has 
finished. In this example, "the name of Jordan" 0.J '11 t"'l is the two-noun construct 
and "the official" ĳ )I has to follow after the construct. 
IV. 
Verbs 0l5' and .JL.a; citation forms 
Two verbs are introduced in the basic information section of this lesson. You have 
learned that Arabic generally doesn't use a verb "to be" in the present tense. But there 
is a verb that means "to be" and it is used in the past tense. The verb is 0l5'. 
-

54 
LESSON FIVE 
Arabic verbs lack an infinitive form, such as "to eat," "to walk," "to study," "to 
be." When referring to an Arabic verb or listing to an Arabic verb in the vocabulary, 
the convention is to use the third person masculine singular past tense form as the cita­
tion form. Thus, the verb form 0ts" means (literally) "he was." It is also, however, the 
citation form of the verb (the way it would be listed in a glossary or dictionary). 
The other verb in this lesson is JL.,.:, "he became" or "to become." The masculine 
singular and feminine singular third person forms of the past tense are as follows: 
V. Negation: Use of J-.-o 
he was (has been) 
she was (has been) 
he became (has become) 
she became (has become) 
0ts" 
GSts" 
JL.,.:, 
• 
' I 
_ 
uJI.P 
The word J-.-o is used to negate equational sentences. For example: 
DRILL I :  COMPLETION 
He is not from Egypt. 
. M if J-.-o yo 
She is not Lebanese . 
. 4 J-.-o 

OVERVIEW 
Lesson 8 is the first lesson in the second stage of the Formal Spoken Arabic course. Up 
to this point you have focused primarily on comprehension of Formal Spoken Arabic 
in its oral and written forms. Now that you have covered a considerable amount of 
comprehension material, you are ready to start actively practicing conversations that 
will be useful to you when you arrive in the Arab world. The lessons in this stage of 
the text, therefore, more closely resemble the traditional textbook approach to a spoken 
language. That is, there will be a basic dialogue for you to work on and memorize, and 
drills and exercises to complete orally and in writing. You will also engage in commu­
nicative activities that vary, strengthen, and extend your ability to express yourself, to 
get your needs across in Arabic, and to understand the spoken language as you hear 
native speakers using it. For the rest of the book, you will follow the interactions of 
Mark Stanley, who has just been assigned to the U.S. embassy in Amman, Jordan. 
The accompanying CD continues to introduce each lesson with a matrix dialogue 
between two or more native speakers of Arabic enacting a situation similar to the one 
in the basic dialogue. Use the matrix dialogues to accustom yourself to spoken Arabic 
interaction and to assess your comprehension skills periodically as you progress 
through the material in the text.

DRILL I: COMPLETION 
This is a completion drill based on the dialogue. After listening to the dialogue several 
times and becoming familiar with the vocabulary, have a look at this drill (sections a 
and b) and try to complete the sentences orally. Once you can say the completed sen­
tences, write in the missing words. Check your spelling with your teacher.

DRILL 2: SCRAMBLED DIALOGUE 
The aim of this drill is to give you greater fluency in handling the dialogue, both in 
chunks, and as a whole. There are several steps to this drill: 
a. Arrange the sentences in sequence by numbering them. 
b. Teacher reads lines one at a time in random order; students give line that should 
follow (without looking at the dialogue). 
c. Students give lines from dialogue that they remember-not necessarily in sequence, 
but until all lines are accounted for. (Lines don У have to be exact, but they should be 
close to the original. ) 
d. Students take turns saying any line from the dialogue they can remember. Teacher 
(without looking at text) gives the following line. 
e. One student says a line from the dialogue and another student gives the following 
line. 
f Role plays: Teacher takes part of Arab employee and rehearses dialogue with each 
student.

SPEAKING ACTIVITY A 
Goal: 
To require students to recognize when lines of the dialogue are 
appropriate even in contexts that are not identical to the original. 
Materials: 
Basic dialogue. 
Procedure: 
Go through the basic dialogue, teacher playing the employee and 
students, in turns, playing Mark. 
GRAMMAR NOTES 
1 .  Teacher departs slightly from original lines, sometimes by 
adding exclamations or other sentences that were not in the 
original, but keeping lines in original order. 
2. As above, but teacher doesn't always preserve original order 
of thoughts. Students may keep to original lines or depart 
slightly from them. 
I. Demonstrative pronouns 
Demonstrative pronouns (this, that, these, those) in spoken Arabic consist of two sets 
of three: 

Lost Luggage 
91 
this (m.) 
Ih 
that (m.) 
!.Ilh 
this (f.) 
t.,?h 
that (f.) 
sh 
these (m. & f.) 
J)h 
those (m. & f.) 
!.I'; )h 
Demonstrative pronouns agree with the nouns they refer to in gender and number 
in the singular, and in number only in the plural. (A "dual" form exists in literary Ara­
bic, but it is generally not used in spoken Arabic.) 
They are used in three ways: 
A. As substitutes for a noun: 
What's this? 
Ihy 
Did you lose this ( one)? 
t.,?hĨ 
That (one) isn't red. 
·ri J-o !.Ilh 
B. As modifiers for nouns in demonstrative phrases: 
These kings aren't Arabs 
. 
. y f J-o !.I}ll J)h 
That island is small . 
. op o.l-yl:-I sh 
Did they find that book? 
 yl.:5:JI !.Ilh I)..l>.) 
Note that when a demonstrative adjective modifies a noun directly, the noun car­
ries the definite article..(This is discussed more extensively in Lesson 1 1 .) 

92 
LESSON EIGHT 
C. As subjects of equational sentences: 
This is his suitcase .

DRILL 3: COMPLETION 
This drill is in two parts. Section a practices the use of the demonstratives "this" and 
"these. " Your teacher will have you do the drill orally at first; then you will be asked 
to write in the appropriate form of the pronoun.

LESSON EIGHT 
II. Possessive pronoun suffixes 
-
As mentioned in Lesson 4, the possessive pronouns (my, your, his, her, our, their) in 
Arabic are suffixed to the end of the word (noun) which they possess. Whereas English 
has a set of six, Arabic has a set of eight: 
" Possessive pronouns

our

ͮ 
, 
his suitcase 
ҫ 
their suitcase 
ź

Ü 
Stress shift 
As you listen to this paradigm (pattern), you will hear a shift in stress in the word 
°. This occurs sometimes when the pronoun suffix starts with a consonant (-ha, 
-na, -kum, and -hum). 
Examples 
SCinta 
scIntat-ak 
santat-kum 
suitcase 
your (m.) suitcase 
your (pI.) suitcase 
This happens most often with words that end in ta·' marbu.ta and with other words 
such as p.:>, where the original stress is not on the final syllable: 
daftar 
daftar-ak 
daftar-kum 
notebook 
your (m.) notebook 
your (pI.) notebook 
With a word like yl£, where the stress is on the final syllable, there is no stress 
shift.

7. your (m.) help 
8. our president 
9. his employees 
10. our government

97 
""I. "To have" -
Arabic does not use a verb to express the concept of "have." Instead, it uses the prepo­
sition "at" plus an object pronoun suffix, so that what is said is actually a locative ex­
pression, e.g., at-me ("I have"), at-him ("he has"), etc. (The object pronouns corre­
spond to the possessive pronouns.) 
The complete paradigm looks like this: 
we have 
you (all) have 
they have 
I have 
you (m.) have 
You (f.) have 
he has 
she has 
I have a question . 
. Jly ($J..:s:.

"IV. Past tense conjugation 
In this lesson there are two verbs: "to arrive" J.o J and "to lose" 2. They are both 
used in the past tense. 
I just arrived from London . 
. 0J.J if ļJ '::}.;:. 
It seems they lost my suitcase. 
- t.. ". 
• 
• 
. h \ij 
The past tense conjugation is formed by taking the past tense "stem"-which is the 
same as the third person masculine singular-and suffixing subject markers to it. 
A. Arabic paradigms 
Arabs conjugate verbs by person rather than by number. That is, instead of saying, "I 
arrived, you arrived, he arrived," etc., they generalIy say, "he arrived, she arrived, they 
arrived, you (m.) arrived, you (f.) arrived, you (pI.) arrived, I arrived, we arrived," go­
ing from third person to second person to first person as follows: 
3rdperson

Many equational sentences involve the use of an adjective as the predicate or comment 
part of the sentence, such as: 
-

LESSON EIGHT

You have already seen that adjectives agree with the nouns they modify. As you 
can see in the previous example, the adjectives in these types of sentences agree with 
the nouns in terms of number and gender but not in definiteness. It is the absence of 
the definite article that makes these adjectives predicates instead of just modifiers. 
A. a famous president 
the famous president 
The president is famous. 
B. an important city 
the important city 
The city is important.

" LISTENING TASK 
Listen to the conversation without looking at the Arabic script. There are some words 
in it you may not have heard before, but most of them should sound familiar. 
First, listen for the gist of what s going on. Then listen more closely a couple of 
times to see just how much you can understand. Discuss your findings with other stu­
dents in your class and compare notes. When you have done this, go over the conver­
sation with your teacher and check your comprehension of the basic idea. 
When you have accomplished this, then look at the written text and compare it to 
what you have heard. You may ask your teacher for meanings of words that you don 't 
know, but it is a good idea to try to guess their meanings from the context first and 
then check to see if you are right.

OVERVIEW 
In this lesson, Foreign Service Officer Mark Stanley, having found his luggage at the 
airport, is met and welcomed by an employee of the U.S. embassy and has a brief in­
troductory conversation with her. 
Aside from an exchange of information, the dialogue involves the use of a number 
of essential courtesy expressions that are customary in such a situation and are impor­
tant elements of spoken Arabic discourse. Since the dialogue is long, it may be best to 
learn it in two parts.

There are two expressions in Arabic that are translatable into English as "please," but 
these expressions serve two different functions. One of them (͚ if) is used to 
request a favor or an action from someone else. The other (J;':f) is used when you 
(the speaker) are offering a favor or action to someone else (e.g., opening a door for

In addition to the regular "you" pronouns (..fii ,pi ,͕i), Arabic has a more formal 
way of addressing persons who are not known to the speaker and/or to whom the 
speaker wants to accord particular courtesy (literally: "your presence"). This polite 
formal term of address has the following forms: 
J 
(pl.) Ťn

I. Subject pronouns 
Here is a chart of spoken Arabic subject pronouns: 
we 
Ī 
I 
you (m.) 
you (pI.) 
(wi) y;i 
you (f.) 
he

she 
Subject pronouns serve often as subjects of equational sentences. 
Examples 
I'm from Washington. 
Are you (m.) Saudi? 
Where are you (f.) from? 
He's Egyptian. 
She's at the embassy. 
We are employees. 
Are you (pI.) Kuwaitis? 
They are our teachers.

Pronouns as objects of prepositions 
Object pronouns occur in the form of suffixes attached to prepositions and verbs. 
These suffixes are almost identical in form to the possessive pronoun suffixes.

LESSON NINE 
A. Prepositions 
Twelve prepositions have been introduced so far: 
... 
y 
by; with; in 
Jl 
to; towards 
to; for; belonging to 
in; at 
, on; upon 
from; of 
from; away from; about 
with 
0=! 
9 
J.i 
. 
..l.:s-
between; among* 
after* 
before* 
at* 
*Technically, in Arabic grammatical theory, these are considered locative adverbs 
rather than prepositions; for the purposes of this text, however, they are grouped with 
prepositions. 
Arabic prepositions are usually short, small words, consisting of one to three let­
ters. Some ofthem take special forms when a pronoun object is suffixed, as follows: 
1 .  
y "by," "at," "in," "with" 
In spoken Arabic, y often lengthens the vowel i to I when followed by a pronoun. 
͝ 
͞ 
& 
J 
ś 
4,* 
4.** 
J 
͊ 
͋ 
*When preceded by a vowel, the second person feminine singular suffix changes 
from -ik to -ki. 
**When preceded by a vowel, the -uh suffix changes to -h. 

Getting Acquainted 
1 25 
2. J "to," "for" 
The vowel on J can vary, depending on the suffix. Also, J is sometimes preceded by 
an i sound, spelled 1. You will probably hear it both ways. 
3. l) "in," "at" 
o

The triliteral prepositions (e.g., , T) generally don't undergo phonological 
changes with suffixes.

It can also be used to indicate immediate (but possibly temporary) possession, that is, 
to have something "with" or "on" you. By saying: 
Do you have a car (with you)? 
YO)t;.. P 
Mark wants to know if Salwa has brought a car along with her, not whether or not 
she actually owns a car. Used in this sense, c: can only refer to concrete items. It could 
not be used, for instance, to say "I have a problem." In such an instance, ' would 
have to be used. 
IV. Past tense of  
The "have" expression ' + pronoun suffix is made past by placing the word 0t5' 
before it. Although 0t5' is a verb, it does not conjugate when used with '. It remains 
0t5'. The "have with" expression, using c: + pronoun suffix, is made past in the same 
way. 
Examples 
I had a problem. 
We had a suitcase but we lost it. 
Did you have much time? 
I had a car (with me). 
We had a car (with us). 
These expressions are both negated with L.. 
I don't have a pen with me. 
I didn't have a pen with me. 
I didn't have a problem.

Summary of word stress rules 
LESSON NINE 
-
The stress shift you have observed when attaching pronoun suffixes to nouns and when 
conjugating verbs exemplifies the basic stress rule for Formal Spoken Arabic. The rule 
has two parts, as follows: 
1 .  Stress is on the final syllable if that syllable consists of: 
C V V C  or C V C C  
where C stands for any consonant, V stands for a short vowel, and VV stands for a 
long vowel, e.g., 
ka-hiir 
(CV-CVVC) 
wa-Éalt 
(CV-CVCC) 
mu-dar-ri-siin 
(CV-CVC-CV-CVVC) 
si-faa-raat 
(CV-CVV-CVVC) 
2. a. If the final syllable is not stressed, stress will be on the second-to-Iast syllable if 
that syllable consists of: 
C V C  il C V V 
il C V V C  il C V C C  
wa-Éal-tu 
(CV-CVC-CVV) 
ma-dil-na 
(CV-CVV-CV) 
mu-dar-ri-saat-haa 
(CV-CVC-CV-CVVC-CVV) 
IªJ 

Getting Acquainted 
wa-jadt-hum 
(CV-CVCC-CVC) 
1 35 
b. If a word is not stressed on the final or second-to-Iast syllable, stress is on the 
third-to-last, no matter what its configuration, e.g.: 
(CVV-CV-CV) 
mad-ra-sa 
(CVC-CV-CV) 
wa-$a-Iuu 
(CV-CV-CVV) 
mu-saa-ca-da 
(CV-CVV-CV-CV) 
Stress does not fall farther back than the third syllable from the end of a word. 
DRILL I I : PRONUNCIATION

SPEAKING ACTIVITY C 
Goal: 
To describe situations using the past tense. 
Materials: 
Cuisenaire rods. 
-
Procedure: 
1 .  With rods, teacher and students build replicas of two air-
ports. One is Amman, the other is New York. One rod is used 
to represent the airplane, another for Mark, another for 
Salwa, and one more for Mark's suitcase. 
2. Teacher asks students to describe Mark's trip from New York 
to Amman, as follows: 
• Mark arrived at the airport in New York by car. 
• He had only one suitcase with him. It was blue. 
• Mark traveled from New York to Amman by plane. 
• He arrived at the Amman airport. 
• But he lost his suitcase. 
• Then, they found it for him. 
• Salwa arrived at the Amman airport by embassy car. 
• She dido't hear the announcement. 
• But she found Mark. 
• He was tired from his trip. 
3. Teacher then has each student describe the journey as if each 
had made it, but with slight changes, e.g.: 
• I arrived at the Chicago airport. 
• I had two suitcases with me. 
• I traveled by plane to Cairo. 
• I found one suitcase but [ didn't find one other (the second 
one). 
• Salwa heard the announcement and found me at the airport. 
• I wasn't very tired. The trip was very comfortable.

Establishing Common Ground 
OVERVIEW 
In the framework of an informal discussion, Mark and Salwa begin to establish some 
common ground, discussing and sharing experiences in simple language on conven­
tional topics such as travel and the weather. Since these subjects will consistently recur 
in conversations with native speakers of Arabic and are essential preliminaries to more 
substantial dialogue, it is important to develop ease and skill in handling these interac­
tions to build a foundation for further discussion. Take this opportunity to develop 
some routines of your own that describe your previous experiences and allow you to 
interact confidently and spontaneously on these topics. Use the speaking and listening 
exercises to practice and expand your repertoire of language skills. 
GRAMMAR POINTS

Of course. I saw the pyramids and I drove with a friend to Luxor and 
we saw some pharaonic ruins there. We also visited museums. 
Egyptian ruins are very interesting, but we have interesting antiqui­
ties here in Jordan, too, like Petra and Jerash. 
So I've heard. I was in Jordan two years ago, but for a short time­
only three days. 
You were here two years ago. Ah! Perhaps you were here with the 
American secretary of state when he visited King Hussein and some 
other Arab heads of state. 
Yes. I was with him. We were in Amman for two days and we went 
to Aqaba for one day. 
You went to Aqaba! That region is very nice-I was there with my 
family two weeks ago and the weather was splendid. 
Excuse me, what does the word ra'ic mean? I don't understand. 
Oh, it means very good, very nice. 
Ah, now I understand. Thanks.

LESSON TEN 
SPEAKING ACTIVITY A 
Practice dialogue expansion with your teacher, following the directions of Speaking 
Activity A in Lesson 8. 
GRAMMAR NOTES 
I. Hollow verbs 
In Lessons 8 and 9, certain verbs were introduced in their past tense fonn. All of these 
verbs are "regular" in the sense that when they are conjugated, the only part of the verb 
that changes is the suffix, or person marker, at the end of the verb. The "stem," or base 
part of the verb, stays the same. 
In this lesson, another category of verbs is introduced. Unlike regular verbs, these 
verbs have a vowel as part of their stem, and that vowel undergoes certain changes in 
the past tense conjugation. Because they have this "weakness" in the middle of the 
stem, they are called "hollow" verbs. 
The hollow verbs that have occurred so far are: 
to be 
to visit 
to drive 
to go 
Cl) 
to see 
JL.;, 
to become 
)lp 
When hollow verbs are conjugated in the past tense, the long vowel ii of the third 
person masculine singular (or citation) fonn changes to a short vowel in the second 
and first persons (singular and plural). This short vowel is either u or i, depending on 
the verb. 
The hollow verbs introduced in this lesson all have u as their short vowel, but the 
verb )lp (introduced in Lesson 5) has i as the short vowel. Sample paradigms are as 
follows:

Arabic has basically three "number" categories: singular, dual, and plural. 

Establishing Common Ground 
1 53 
A. Singular 
The number one acts as an adjective. As such, it follows the noun it modifies and 
agrees with it in gender, e.g., 
B. Dual 
Two of anything is a category unto itself. In counting, the number two (Í\) is not 
generally used; rather, a dual suffix c.:r--) is attached to the noun. 
C. Plural 
Plural nouns are used when counting from 3 to 1 0. Note that a masculine noun takes 
the feminine form of the number and a feminine noun takes the masculine form of the 
number. 
This rule is not always strictly observed by native speakers. You may sometimes hear 
masculine numbers used with the masculine nouns, e.g.,: 
five children 
nine days 
;)'j)i t 
rl:i я 
or 
five children 
or 
nine days 
D. Counting above 10 
When counting above 1 0, the counted noun is singular; for example: 
0)\1?- t 
0)\1 J.?-) r 
J..j) ?- t  
J.j) J.?-) r 
·*0)\1 % 
**J.j) - 
**The word % is pronounced mlt when it occurs before a noun.

IV. Agreement for plural nouns 
Plural nouns in Arabic fall into two semantic categories: human and nonhuman. Plural 
nouns that refer to human beings take plural agreement, whereas plural nouns that re­
fer to nonhuman entities generally take feminine singular agreement. 
A. Human nouns 
I saw some Arab heads (m.) of state. 
These ministers (m.) are Saudi. 
I saw some Egyptian students (f.). 
These ministers (f.) are Syrians. 
B. Nonhuman nouns 
I visited some Arab countries. 
They have many problems. 
These cities are important.

This rule for feminine singular agreement with nonhuman nouns is not strictly ad­
hered to in spoken Arabic, and you may hear Arabs use plural agreement with certain 
nonhuman nouns. It is advisable to use feminine singular agreement, however, since it 
is generally appropriate for nonhuman nouns.

V. Agreement for dual nouns 
LESSON TEN 
-
In written Arabic, dual nouns are modified by a dual form of the adjective, and this is 
sometimes the case in spoken Arabic as well, e.g., 
More often, however, the dual form of the adjective is avoided in spoken Arabic, 
and the plural form ofthe adjective used. 
Sometimes, the plural noun is used, followed by the number two (tI / I) plus 
the plural form ofthe adjective. 
The modification of the dual noun is one of the fuzzy areas of spoken Arabic, 
where standardization is difficult to establish because of lexical and regional differ­
ences. Do the following drills with your teacher and check with your teacher about 
what sounds most appropriate in the dual.

Yes, it does. At the institute, students usually study six hours every 
day, and they study classical (literary) Arabic as well as colloquial. 
They learn reading, writing, and speaking? 
Yes, they study all that, and they can read, write, and speak in 
Arabic. 
But Arabic is very difficult for foreigners, isn't it? 
Well, of course it's not an easy language, but it isn't extremely hard. 
For this reason there is an advanced program in Tunis in addition to 
the program in Washington. 
Do you know other foreign languages besides Arabic? 
I studied French in high school and in college, but I know Arabic 
better than French. 
Really, you speak Arabic very well, and you seem to understand al­
most everything I say to you. 
That's kind of you. I try, and I'm determined to improve. 
You have a golden opportunity to improve while you're in Jordan. 
You're right. I have to practice as much as possible while I'm in this 
(good) country so that I can speak fluently (God willing). 
Practice is very important-true-and I can help you. We should 
always speak Arabic with each other. 
Good idea! Let's do that. I'd appreciate it.

The usual citation form for a verb is the third-person masculine singular past tense, 
e.g., i} "to read." This is the minimal or shortest form of the verb and is considered, 
for listing purposes, to be the most basic form. 
Beginning with this lesson and for the rest of the text, verbs will be introduced in 
the vocabulary lists in the following manner: past tense/present tense/verbal noun. For 
example: 
to read 
to write 
l:S' / S; / ਇ 
. 
'" 
. 
.. 
. 
Verbs should be memorized in this way-all three parts together-because not all 
verbs are predictable in the way they form the present tense and verbal noun. In addi­
tion, memorizing sets of patterns is the most efficient way of eventually mastering 
Arabic vocabulary and morphology. 
2. ie t. 
This expression is a mild oath that expresses surprise. It can be used on both happy 
and distressful occasions, meaning "How nice!" "Wow!" or "How awful!" "Good 
grief1"

LESSON ELEVEN 
3. J "while" 
The particle ), in addition to meaning "and," can also mean "while." It is used this way 
when the main action in a sentence is coordinated with another action or state of 
affairs, as in the following examples from the text. 
You have a golden opportunity to improve while you're in Jordan .

DIALOGUE MEMORIZATION 
a. Teacher takes role of Salwa and students that of Mark. Teacher cues students with 
Salwa s lines and students respond in unison. 
b. Teacher then gives Salwa s lines at random and students give appropriate responses. 
c. Teacher again gives Salwa s lines and one student at a time gives Marks line. 
d. Teacher plays one full dialogue with each student. 
DIALOGUE VARIATION 
a. Teacher and student go through dialogue. Teacher varies the lines slightly, keeping 
meaning consistent with original so students can respond with linesfrom dialogue. 
b. Teacher and students rehearse dialogue, keeping general ideas, but teacher now 
alters lines more extensively so that students have to think of appropriate response.

I. Verbal nouns 
The verbal noun is the name of the action specified by a verb. In the following sen­
tence from the basic dialogue, three verbal nouns are used: "reading," "writing," and 
"speaking." 
Do they learn reading, writing, and speaking?

Demonstrative phrases consist of "this" or "that" plus a noun, such as "this notebook," 
"that newspaper." In Arabic these phrases consist of the demonstrative pronoun plus 
a definite noun, so that what is said is literally, "this-the-notebook," "that-the­
newspaper. "

The past tense in Arabic is conjugated by means of suffixes which are attached to a 
stem. The present tense is conjugated by means of prefixes attached to a stem, and in 
three persons (2nd feminine singular, 2nd and 3rd plural) there is a long vowel suffix 
as well. 
A. Stems 
The stems for the past tense and present tense are different. For example, in the verb 
V'J;) "to study" the past tense markers are attached to the stem daras- (-V'v;)' 
daras-t 
daras-ti 
daras-u 
I studied 
you (f.) studied 
they studied 

Seeking and Giving Information

J 
The present tense markers are attached to the stem -drus- (-U" j;)-). 
a-drus 
U"{;i 
I study 
ta-drus-l 
J .  , 
you (f.) study 
,-?,j.J.j 
ya-drus 
J. , 
he studies 
U"jJ.J. 
Short vowel patterns in the present tense stem vary. As you learn more Arabic you 
will learn how to predict many of these variations, but it is a good idea to memorize 
the present tense stem along with the present tense. The full present tense paradigm of 
U" j;) is as follows: 
\Y'{z 
J .  , 
U"j.J.j

IV. Pronouns as objects of verbs 
The set of object pronouns used with verbs corresponds to the set of object pronouns 
used with prepositions. The pronoun substitutes for a noun and is suffixed to the verb, 
as in the following examples: 
I lost my suitcase but they found i! for me. 
*.J l4>J.b:-J ਜJ'ਝ ৹ 
I can help you .

vowel receives the stress:

V. Arabic "modal" expressions: i! ':i and ׳ 
Modals in English are words such as "must," "ought to," "can," "could," "should," 
"need to," "may," "might," "have to." In this lesson there are two such words that 
function modally in Arabic, i j':i and. 
A. i j':i "need to, have to, must, ought, should, it is necessary that" 
The word i j':i covers a lot of territory, as can be seen from the above definitions. It is 
used to express a sense of necessity or obligation. There are two things to keep in 
mind about i j':i: 
1 .  It is invariable (always has the same form). 
2. It is followed by a present tense verb. 
Examples from dialogue 
I have to practice as much as possible . 
. 01.5:.)11 jooU 0:)'i i j':i 
We should always §peak Arabis: with each other . 
. 	 c: WI.")!,?,f F ij':i 
B.  "can, could, may, it is possible that" 
When preceding a present tense verb,  generally acts as the modal of possibility. 
Like i j':i, it is invariable.

When  is used alone, or followed by an equational sentence or a past tense 
verb, it means "perhaps," or "maybe." 
Maybe she's at the office .

VII. J5' "All, the whole; every, each" 
 
183 
A. The word J5' means "all" or "the whole" when it is followed by a defmite noun, e.g., 
 
all day, the whole day 
)ɯI Ϫ 
(all year) the whole year 
wi J5' 
all the ministers 
all the teachers 
 
S'1)j)1 J5' 
ċ#.uly 
When followed by an indefinite singular noun, it means "each" or "every." 
every day 
everyone 
everything 
 
each year 
every minister 
B. The word J5' (and also 	) can be followed by a pronoun suffix. For example: 
all of them 
some of you 
all of us 
some of them 
all of it (f.) 
A very common way of phrasing "all" or "the whole 
" in Arabic 
 
is to say the definite noun first and then follow it with J5' plus a pronoun that agrees in 
number and gender with the noun. For example: 
the whole institute 
all the ministers 
all the words 
(the institute-all of it) 
(the ministers-all of them) 
(the words-all of them)

LESSON TWELVE 
Personal Needs and Family 
OVERVIEW 
The basic dialogue in this lesson models a typical exchange of information in which 
time schedules, personal needs, and family are discussed. The topic of family 
(especially children) is an accepted way of showing courteous interest in someone and 
is bound to arise in conversations. Arabic kinship terminology is more detailed and 
complex than in English, and will take some practice to master.

All right then, I still have time. I think I'd like to rest a bit. 
You must be hungry.

Not really hungry, but sleepy. According to my watch it's 6: 1 5  in the 
morning, and I wasn't able to sleep on the plane. 
You didn't sleep at all? Then without a doubt you're tired. By the 
way, do you know that the embassy has rented a nice house for you? 
It should be ready next week (God willing). 
Good. My family is coming in about two weeks. 
May I ask you how many children you have? 
We have three children: a boy and two girls. 
God keep them. 
Thank you. Do you have children? 
No, I'm not married. I still live with my father and mother and four 
brothers. 
You have four brothers?! My goodness! Are you the only girl? 
No, I have a sister who got married last year. Now she and her hus­
band live in the suburbs of the city. She's five years older than I .  
Are you the youngest (of all)? 
No, I'm not the youngest (of them). My sister and three of my broth­
ers are older than I .  My brother Ahmad is the youngest. He is 16 
years old and he's still in school.

The word Ò is used with pronoun suffixes to express the concept of "to want." It is 
, 
similar to the expression ..l;s. plus pronoun suffixes in that it is not really a verb, but its 
equivalent in English is a verbal expression.

The expressions J.; and .:>1) are synonymous, both meaning "to want." The major

tv. Verb strings 
Verbs can be "strung" together in Arabic, somewhat as in English, to express a series 
of actions, e.g., "I want to go to see him" or "I tried to study." In these Arabic expres­
sions, the initial verb in the string can be in any tense and the following verbs are in 
the present tense, agreeing in subject with the initial verb. 
Examples from dialogue

v. 01 and 0f "that" 
The particles 01 and 0f are used as subordinating conjunctions linking two clauses. 
They are followed by either a noun or suffix pronoun, as in the following examples 
from the text. 
I .  Mr. Scott told me that he wants to see you .

4. Do you know that the embassy rented ačnice house for you? 
&J:.r. N Ĩ u?LI o}..i . ..JI 0i JjU 
As shown by these examples, when the clause that follows 01 starts with a noun, 
(4), 01 stays as it is. If, however, the clause that follows 01 starts with a verb, (1) and 
(2), it is necessary to attach a pronoun suffix to 01 as a buffer between 01 and the verb. 
The pronoun suffix agrees with the subject of the verb. If the clause that follows 01 is

9. Did you (f.) write to your family? No, not yet. 
10. They are still trying to see him. 
VII. Comparative and superlative 
A. 
Comparative 
Comparative adjectives (such as "bigger, smaller") can be formed from regular adjec-
tives by changing their pattern, e.g., 
big 
-+ bigger 
Ϛf ... 
p$" 
small -+ smaller 
Ni ... 
Ž 
good -+ better 
Oi ... 
c.r-> 
When used in context comparing one thing to another, the word F is used for 
"than." 
My sister and three of my brothers are older than I. 
.J- pS'i Py'-l if d.J+ J Qi 
She is five years older than I. (She is older than I by five years.) 
.נ Ƃ J- pS'i ږ 
B. Superlative 
The superlative ("biggest, smallest") form of the adjective looks like the comparative. 
It is used either with the definite article, e.g., 
Are you the youngest? 
&()\ .;...ji 
My brother Ahmad is the youngest. 
.()\ Y' ..I.A"-i Dy'-i 

Personal Needs and Family 
207 
or it is used as the first term of a construct. 
Are you the youngest of all?

In spoken Arabic, the hours of clock time from one to ten are referred to by using the 
feminine form of the cardinal number, e.g., "hour one," "hour two," as follows: 
1 :00 
5:00 
o..l>IJ =U\ 
> =UI 
2:00 
8:00 
? =U\ 
11 =U\ 
Eleven o'clock and twelve o'clock are stated in the masculine form:

a quarter hour 
a third of an hour 
a half hour 
*+ ci,

2 1 1 
Outside these major segments, the number of minutes is used, most of them in 
units of five or ten. The words to express time before or after an hour are: 
and, plus J 
minus, less 
Time within an hour is expressed in terms of three twenty-minute divisions: 
twenty minutes after the hour, ten minutes before and after the half hour, and twenty 
minutes before the next hour, as follows:

The roman numerals above the verb designate what "form" the verb belongs to. 
The term "form" refers to the pattern of consonants and vowels in the particular verb 
and there are ten forms in all. As you can see, Form I is the most basic and most

frequently occurring. The three consonants that compose the Form I verb are 
considered to be the "root" consonants from which the other nine forms are derived. 
Forms will be more extensively treated in later lessons. At the present time it will be 
useful for you to start identifying forms, with the help of your teacher, and sorting 
them out. The identification is helpful because, apart from Form I, the present tense 
and verbal nouns of other verb forms are predictable, so this knowledge considerably 
lessens the burden on your memory. 
Arabs generally represent the forms by referring to a standard citation verb that 
uses the consonants J..t as the root. Thus the ten forms in citation form are symbolized 
by the following:

II. SUMMARY OF NOUN PLURALS 
Arabic nouns are made plural in three ways: the sound feminine plural, the sound mas­
culine plural, and the broken plural. 
A. Sound feminine plural 
The sound feminine plural consists of the suffix ul- added to the singular stem of the 
word. It is used as follows. 
1. For many feminine nouns ending in 0 tii' marbii.ta or u tiio': 
Plural 
Singular

Note that some words undergo an internal vowel change when ul is added:

220 
LESSON THIRTEEN 
2. A number of words that are masculine in gender make their plural with ..:.>1-. Two 
large categories of words that take the sound feminine plura1 are verbal nouns of 
derived forms (II-X) e. g., 0@1, from Form IV verb J>-i "to announce," and 
borrowed words, such as j:i }. 
Plural 
Singular

oceans 
..:.>B 
¥ 
ocean 
hotels 
..:.>;}.;i Ji 
j:i i  
- J

B. Sound masculine plural 
The sound masculine plural is the suffix J.- attached to the singular stem of the word: 
Plural 
Singular 
 
 
employees (m.) 
y 
...J:.y 
employee (m.) 
teachers (m.) 
ċ#..Lo 
U"#..Lo 
teacher (m.) 
Nouns that take the sound masculine plural refer to male human beings, or, in the 
plural, a mixed group of male and female human beings. 
C. Broken plurals 
Broken (or "internal") plurals are made through internal vowel changes in the singular 
stem. Although the patterns may seem random, they are not. They fall into distinct 

Review

groups. Using the letter c to represent any consonant, some of the most frequent bro-
ken plural patterns can be classified by relative frequency as follows:

There are other broken plural patterns, but these are ten of the most common ones. 
As you study these lists, say the words out loud to yourself and try to absorb which 
singular patterns typically take which plural patterns. There is a certain "rhythm" that 
you will begin to hear which will help you learn to predict broken plural patterns. 
Rarely, but in a few common words, the plural is not based on the singular stem.

Plurals of adjectives are similar to plurals of nouns and fall into the same categories: 
sound feminine plural, sound masculine plural, and broken plural. Remember that plu­
ral adjectives are used primarily to modify nouns referring to human beings, because 
nouns referring to nonhumans generally take feminine singular agreement. 
A. Sound feminine plural: 
The sound feminine plural (CJI-) is used on any adjective that modifies a plural noun 
referring strictly to female human beings.

IV. SUMMARY OF COMPARATIVE AND SUPERLATIVE 
Adjectives in Arabic generally take their comparative and superlative forms from the 
Jdi pattern. These forms of the adjective usually don't inflect for gender or number in 
spoken Arabic. 
A. Comparative: 
1 .  The comparative form of an adjective can be used to contrast two things in quality, 
using the word :x for "than": 
Cairo is bigger than Damascus . 
. ÚÑ if p5'i 0 ÅliJ\ 
Studying a language is harder than studying history . 
. Û).:J\ J...,\JÑ if Éi Ü\ J...,\JÑ 

228

2. It can also be used in an adverbial sense, to modify a verb. 
She speaks Arabic beǚtter than I. 
.ρ j->"i (,},f π </' 
He studies more than his friend . 
. Ɓ..l.p if pi iJ" j-4 Y' 
3. It can be used without F to make a general, noncontrasting statement. 
B. Superlative 
He has a better idea . 
. j->"i oo oG 
I think this is easier . 
. ni 11;. 0i *i 
The superlative is used to make an absolute quality statement. It is generally used in 
two ways: 
1 .  as the first term of a construct, 
He's the tallest student in the class . 
. ɰI l) -.,jL1 J}>i Y' 
AI-Ahram is the most famous newspaper in the Middle East. 
.ז J $I J rJI l) o-4? +i il/, $I 
2. or, with the definite article without a following noun to make a general statement. 
I am the youngest.

C. Exceptions 
1. Root change 
There are some common cases in spoken Arabic where the comparative/superlative 
form of the adjective may be derived from a lexical root that is different from the com­
monly used base form. These include the words for "good, better, best" and for "bad, 
worse, worst."

2. 
Use of ξf 
23 1 
Certain Arabic adjectives are used with the word pi ("more") to indicate the 
comparative state, instead of changing to the Ái pattern. This is analogous to using 
the word "more" with certain adjectives in English, rather than adding the ·er suffix. 
The adjectives that fall into this category are generally of three types: adjectives 
ending in 01. (e.g., 0ɝ ,0l? y.-) adjectives that are participles of derived verb forms 
(ڄ 'iÂ) and nisba adjectives (t.?D 't.?EI;). 
She is hungrier than I.

Handling a Problem 
Hello, sir. Can I help you? 
Yes. I think I have a room reserved for me. 
What is your name, please? 
My name is Mark Stanley. 
One moment . . .  let me see which room they gave you. Is it a 
room for one, or for more? 
For one person-for me alone. 
235 
We have a room with bath reserved for you but there's a slight 
problem. 
Nothing major, I hope. 
We haven't had enough time to change the linen and finish 
cleaning the room. The maid is working on it now. Could you 
wait for a half hour or so? 
Impossible. I'm in a hurry. I have an appointment at the Ameri­
can Embassy in an hour and I want to put my things in the 
room and rest a bit. Don't you have another suitable room? 
I'm afraid not. I don't think we have any empty rooms. But I'll 
talk to the person in charge and I'll see what we can do. 
All right, but please, I don't have much time and I'd like to rest 
a bit. 
(after a few minutes) Sir, I think we can solve the problem. We 
have several rooms we usually reserve for emergencies, for of­
ficial guests. We could give you one of those, which is better 
than the one that was reserved for you, if you like. 
That sounds fine. I think that's an appropriate solution. What 
floor is the room on? 
On the ninth floor. Here's the key. The porter will come to carry 
your bags. Sorry for the inconvenience. 
That's all right. I thank you. By the way, have I received any 
letters? 
Let me see . . .  no, there's nothing here. 
OK. Where do I find the elevator? 

236 
LESSON FOURTEEN

On your right, under the red light. When you leave the elevator

Relative clauses are subordinate clauses that are (usually) linked to the main clause 
with a relative pronoun, such as "which," "who," or "that." They are called relative 
clauses because they "relate" back to something or someone (a noun or noun phrase) 
mentioned in the main clause. There are three things to remember about Arabic rela­
tive clauses. 
A. If the antecedent of the relative clause is a definite noun, the relative pronoun must 
be used to link the two clauses, e.g., 
This is the suitcase tJ1at arrived yesterday. 
'CJŜI ..;..l.p) JlI a.,b:..:.JI l/' i.?! 

238 
LESSON FOURTEEN 
B. If the antecedent of the relative clause is an indefinite noun, no relative pronoun is 
used to link the two clauses. 
This is a suitcase that arrived yesterday. 
·C)ÅI J) A.,b. ':. t.,folA 
c. If the verb of the relative clause is transitive, and refers back to the antecedent as a 
direct object, that verb must take a "dummy" pronoun object that agrees in number 
and gender with the antecedent. This applies to both definite and indefinite 
antecedents. 
This is the suitcase they found (it) . 
. \..2. ).b:-) JlI ÆI ..,;0 t.,folA 
This is a suitcase they found (it) . 
. \..2. ).b:-) Ÿ t.,folA 
If there is a preposition in the relative clause referring back to the antecedent as its 
object, that preposition must take a pronoun object that agrees in number and gender 
with the antecedent. 
I visited the school where she studies. (the school she studies in)

SPEAKING ACTIVITY A 
Goal: 
To be able to discuss future events. 
Materials: 
None. 
Procedure: 
1 .  Teacher gives a brief summary in Arabic of what the class 
IV. Defective verbs 
will be doing next week, using the future tense. 
2. Students confirm what they have understood the teacher to 
say by paraphrasing what they heard or by asking the teacher 
questions. 
3. Teacher asks students questions about what they will do when: 
• they go home tonight 
• they arrive at post 
• they finish the course 
Defective verbs are ones in which the final root consonant is "weak" and shows up as 
a vowel (usually a or 0. The majority of these verbs are a-f, that is, the fmal vowel in 
the past tense (citation form) is a spelled with alif maqöura (l5) and in the present 
tense (citation form) is f ((,.» . 

244 
LESSON FOURTEEN 
A number ofthese verbs appear in this lesson: 
to talk 
to; to walk 
to give 
to find; to meet 
to let 
These verbs conjugate uniquely because of their final vowel. Below are charts for 
both past and present tense, using Ƚ as the example.

In spelling, the alif maq$ura (0) changes to alif mamduda (I) when it is followed 
by a suffix pronoun, e.g., 
He met us .

Procedure: 
1 .  Students decide on one of the following scenarios to enact in 
Arabic with the teacher. 
a. At the airport in an Arab city, you go to the airline counter 
to check your bags and board the plane and discover that 
the flight has been cancelled. You have an urgent 
appointment in London and must negotiate with the 
airline representative how to get there as soon as possible. 
b. You arrive at the Foreign Ministry for an appointment 
with the Deputy Foreign Minister and are informed that 
he is tied up in a meeting. You are told by his secretary 
that you can wait, or make another appointment or see the 
Assistant Deputy Foreign Minister. You have to find out 
how long the wait might be and then decide what to do. 
c. A congressional delegation consisting of four people 
wants to make an unscheduled visit to a local AID project. 
You must negotiate with the car pool manager who speaks 
no English, in order to get suitable transportation for 
them. 
2. Students as a group devise a strategy for dealing with the 
problem (this can be done in English), including any key 
lines they think they will need, and any extra vocabulary. 
3. Teacher acts as a resource, helping students generate "key 
lines" providing needed vocabulary items, and then rehears­
ing the situation with the students as a group. 
4. Students role play the situation one-on-one with the teacher, 
who plays the part of the native speaker. 
Students may optionally want to record the role-play in order to 
critique their own performance.

GRAMMAR NOTES 
I. Verb forms 
The majority of Arabic verbs can be classified by what is traditionally called their 
"form." Every triliteral root has ten potential forms that are derived from it, each form 
exhibiting a specific and predictable phonological shape and embodying a meaning 
related to the lexical content of the root. 
It is important and useful for students of Arabic to understand the system of verb 
forms because the present tense, verbal nouns, and participles of Forms II-X are 
predictable, and knowledge ofthe system greatly expands mastery of vocabulary. 
It is also necessary to know how this system works in order to use an Arabic­
English or Arabic-Arabic dictionary, as dictionaries are organized by roots and not by 
spelling of individual words. 
Following is a chart of a basic Arabic root: ॔. The chart includes the past tense, 
present tense, verbal nouns, and active and passive participles for each of the ten verb 
forms of the verb. Use this chart for reference and work on memorizing it and or 
fitting other verbs into it. The sooner the system is mastered, the sooner Arabic vo­
cabulary will become more easily accessible.

" ". Quadrilitera/ verbs 
There is a set of verbs based on four consonants instead of three. They are called quad­
riliteral. The verbs r'"; and Ȭ are of this type. They will be indicated in vocabulary 
lists with a (Q). In the past tense they conjugate like triliteral verbs using the past tense 
suffixes. In the present tense they conjugate as follows: 
Ir>.-? 
, 
they translate 
I 
. :!

The imperative or command form of a verb is based on the present tense second person 
forms: you (m.), you (f.), and you (pl.). The procedure for fom1ing the imperative for 
most verbs is as follows: 
A. Remove the subject marker (prefix). For forms II, III, V, and VI and for 
quadriliteral verbs, this is all that is necessary. 
B. For forms I, IV, VIII, and X, prefix hamza plus a short vowel (a, i, or, u). 
Examples

Prefix /i-/ if stem vowel is a or i 
Prefix /u-/ if stem vowel is u

SPEAKING ACTIVITY A 
Goal: 
To use imperative verbs to explain, instruct, and direct. 
Materials: 
None. 
Procedure: 
1 .  Students each choose a topic to explain and prepare a list of 
terms they will need to use, consulting teacher for help with 
vocabulary (if needed). Explanations should be kept as sim­
ple as possible and contain imperative verbs. 
2. Students take turns explaining different things to teacher. 
Teacher listens, paraphrases, and verifies verbally as the in­
structions are given. At end of explanation, teacher summa­
rizes. For example, explain how to: 
a. get a taxi 
b. order Chinese food over the phone 
c. use a pay phone 
d. get to a student's house 
e. make reservations at a restaurant for dinner, or at a hotel 

272 
LESSON FIFTEEN 
IV, Use 0(41 
Some verbs, such as Ui or yl>.-, take two objects, that is, one gives somebody 
something. The thing given is called the direct object, while the recipient is called the 
indirect object. When these objects in Arabic are both suffix pronouns, only one is 
attached to the verb. The other one is suffixed to the "pronoun object carrier" 41. 
Let me see the room (which) they gave (it) to you . 
. l.l>41 !J Fi JI ;U jJI J yi y 
I gave them to you . 
. l.l>41 Vi 
Other verbal expressions also use 41 to carry a pronoun object. These include @, 
Ò, and e:, as well as verbs used with the preposition ÿ, which means doing something 
"for" someone, or "to" someone, e.g., 
Do you want it (f.)? 
Wl.l>41 !JÒ 
She opened it for me .

LESSON FIFTEEN 
V. Use of S 
The word ă in Arabic has two meanings: "self' and "same." In this lesson it is used 
in its meaning of "same." When it is used in this way, it becomes a construct relation­
ship with a following definite noun, e.g., 
at the same time 
the same thing 
ष)I ă l) 
सहI ă 
DRILL 7:TRANSLATION

8. the same floor 
SPEAKING ACTIVITY B AND TASK 
Goal: 
To become familiar with the names of Arabic food and how to 
order in a restaurant. 
Materials: 
Arabic menu (provided by teacher). 
Procedure: 
1 .  Students, with teacher acting as informant, identify major 
divisions of menu. 
2. Students pick out words that they know, including Arabic 
transliterations of known items, e.g., 8§''S' §" J-I}", f}".

Bargaining and Buying 
Do you have a particular kind of gift in mind? 
Yes; local traditional crafts, of course. 
You mean handmade local crafts? 
279 
Exactly. Things that usually interest foreigners and are related to the 
culture of the area, like rugs, traditional clothing, etc. 
What you need is in Suq Sharqiyya. 
If I take a taxi, how much should I pay? 
Don't pay him more than one and one half dinars. Ifhe asks for 
more, you'll have to bargain with him and make sure you agree on 
the fare before you get in the car. 
OK. And I should give him a tip, shouldn't I? 
Sure. That's the custom here. 
What's the way of bargaining in the suq? What are the limits? 
In that suq, the prices aren't fixed. So if the merchant asks you for 
six dinars, tell him three; and ifhe asks for nine, tell him four-and-a­
half, etc. 
And ifhe says "No, that's too little"? 
Tell him, "Okay, I'll go (see) another shop." Then he'll reduce the 
price because he's afraid you'll leave him and buy from someone 
else. 
Personally, I prefer to spend a few hours in the suq getting ac­
quainted with the shops and goods and comparing prices. 
Excellent. You're right. You ought to have a clear idea about the 
goods and prices, and then you can decide what to buy and where to 
buy it. 
A thousand thanks for the advice, Hasan! 
You're welcome, Mark. Good luck.

V. 
Conditional sentences 
Conditional sentences are typically ones that start with the word "if." The "if' clause 
states a condition and the following clause states a result, e.g., "If you go tomorrow, 
I'll see you there." There are basically two types of conditions: ones that are possible, 
or realizable, and ones that are unlikely or impossible (contrary to fact). The word 
used for "if' in possible conditional clauses is \!l. For contrary-to-fact conditions, the 
word used for "if' is ."J. 
Normally, the tense of the verb in the "if' clause is past, whereas the verb in the 
"result" clause can be in any tense: 
Ifhe asks you for six dinars, tell him three . 
. DE 4.l J.; 'ft\.js ..;.... ȩ  \!l 
If you go tomorrow, I'll see you there . 
. ,!jĕ .:J.jy:.i C.J ,o% ":"'>-.J \!l 

Bargaining and Buying 
289 
The rule about using the past tense in the "if' clause is not absolute, however. Oc­
casionally, in spoken Arabic, the present tense is used: 
If I take a taxi, how much should I pay? 
1e:!;,i i j'j J-<J:; ,Êl;:)\ .i>-T bl
