Meet the authors 
The authors are both linguists of long experience, and are familiar 
with the Arab countries, their society, religion and culture. 
Jack Smart has taught Arabic at university level for more than. 
30 years, specializing in the learning of the language, his.students 
ranging from beginners to candidates for a doctoral degree. He 
is familiar with the written language from its earliest pre-Islamic 
period to the present day, and has researched widely into spoken 
Arabic dialects, in several of which he is fluent. He has lived and 
worked in Egypt, Sudan and the Gulf countries, and has made 
short or extended visits and study trips to virtually all of the other 
Arab states. 
Frances Altorfer has also lived in the Middle East.. She knows , 
several European languages a well as Swahili and. Arabic, and·has 
many years of experience of teaching languag~ using the most 
up-to;..date teaching methods. 
Working in partnership, Jack has provided the linguistic material, 
and Frances the teaching expertise. The result is, we are sure, a 
balanced self-teaching book with a broad scope, mainly linguistic, 
but also with useful sections on the Arab and Islamic culture, in a 
clear and easily digestible format.

Vlll 
more than 200 million people, across 
Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East. 
In several other countries tt is an official language. It is 
read and written by more than 1,000 million Muslims 
across the world. It is the language of the Koran, the 
holy scripture of the Islamic religion. All Muslims use 
Arabic in their·devotions. 
Arabic is a Semitic language, one of an ancient group 
of languages spoken across North Africa, the Arabian 
peninsula and South-West Asia. Its main surviving sister 
lang'uage is modern Hebrew. Modern Arabic exists 
on two levels. The first is the written Arabic of books, 
newspapers and the media, known as Modern Standard 
Arabic; the second is colloquial or spoken Arabic, which 
varies across the Arab world and Is not normally written. 
Although spoken Arabic differs between countries, all 
dialects descend directly from Ancient Arabic. This book 

deals with one of the larger dialect groups, spoken in 
the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. 
Arabic is written from right to left, cursively, like 
European handwriting, i.e. most letters are joined up. 
There is no equivalent of European printed text, with 
separated letters. There are no capital letters. The 
alphabet has 28 consonants. The short vowels, such as 
a as in hat, are not normally written. The Arabic script 
looks difficult, but is actually quite easy to master. 
Spelling is no problem as there are few irregularities. 
There are some 'strange' sounds in Arabic which do 
not occur in English, but these can be mastered with 
practice. Vocabulary can be difficult as Arabic comes 
from a different language group from English, but -
especially In spoken Arabic - there are many 'borrowed' 
words, such as bank, and slinama rr'''"",, 
along. 

~"''''''''~ 
" 
~ 
1 0 Jly got ten minutes? 
~~-··'"\~ 
Why do you want to learn Arabic? There could be several reasons. 
• It may be that you are going to work in a country where Arabic 
is the everyday language, and you would like to be able to 
communicate with the people. To read such basic things as street 
signs, newspaper headings and so on you need some knowledge 
Qf the written luguage, the basics of which are also dealt with 
in this hook. 
X 
• You may simply wanuo learn· Arabic becabse·you ~d 
to visit one 
of the Arabit~peaking countries as a tourist. Besides the wonderful 
pharaonic monuments in Egypt, the marvels of Roman and Arab 
civilizations extend across North Africa and the Middle East. 
If you know one form of spoken Arabic, you will find it quite easy 
to adapt to the dialect of whichever Arabic-speaking country you 
happen to be in, as you will have a good grounding in the basics 
of the language. All the dialectS are ultimately baled on the ancient 
written language, and grammatical features such as the way the 
verbs work do not differ gready wherever you are. For instance, in 
the Arabic taught in this book, the word for they go is yiruuHuun; 
in other dialects - even a few within the Gulf region itself- it 
is yiruuHuu, without the final -n. This is typical of these minor 
variations - and in my case, you will be understood whichever 
you use. 

What kind of Arable will you learnl 
The Arabic ~ught in this bOolds representative of the spoken 
Arabic of the Gulf region, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and most 
of Iraq, and even within this area, there are regional differences. 
The dialects of the Yemen, perhaps, differ the most. If you learn 
the Arabic in this book, you will be understood in the .whole area. 
If you are to be in a specific area for a long period, you should 
listen to and adopt the local usages. For instance, the word given 
for there is/are is fiih. If you are in Bahrain you will hear hast, in 
Iraq you will hear aku, and in parts of Oman shayy- but fiih will 
do fine wherever you are. 
In addition to the native speakers, Arabic is read and written,by 
Muslims all over the world as· a language,of religion. 
• There are millions of Muslims in Pakistan, Afghanistan and in 
the Far East, in Malaysia and Indonesia. If you are a Muslim, 
you have to read the Koran and pray in Arabic.· Translations are' 
only used for reference or to help with understanding the Arabic. 
• All the commentaries on the Holy Text, and other literature·on 
interpretation and rules for daily life are written in and have to 
be read in Arabic. 
It is a matter of pride for Muslims to regard Arabic as a prestige 
language. 
In the same way that Welsh and Spanish and English use mostly 
the same script but are not closely related to one another, other 
languages of mainly Islamic countries, such as Persian (Farsi) and 
Urdu, and previously Turkish, use adapted versions of 
script, but are not linguistically related to Arabic. 
and Urdu are still written in slighdy adapted tnnr.llllllit 
alphabet, Turkish adopted a modified Europea~ 
If you know Arabic, you can often get the gist 
written in one of those languages. This is 
words borrowed from Arabic, due to the 

xii 
by the appatendy difficult script. In fact,-
rewarding aspects of learning Arabic. Once 
the 2.8 letters, it is easy to write Arabic - which 
ltJ.I'IC'IUUK oddities of English (think of write/right or 
cough/through, for example). 
Arabic - except in the Holy Koran and ancient poetry - is always 
written without the short vowels, such as the a in hat or i in tin. 
This is not as bizarre as you might think: in English we·are already 
used to this with text messaging (txt msg). The vowels can usually 
be predicted because there is a very limited number of permitted 
word shapes in Arabic. In fact, all true Arabic words fall into fewer 
than so patterns (i.e. combinations of consonants and vowels). 
The Arable heritage 
The Arabs began to study their language early in their history, so 
the basics of grammar were laid down in the eighth century, which 
is also when the first dictionary was written. 
Written Arabic has existed for about 12. centuries without a giat 
deal of change. The West owes Arabic a major debt, as Arabie 
carried the torch of classical learning when Europe entered 
the Dark Ages. Many e~rly Greek mathematical, medical and 
philosophical texts were translated by Arab writers and scientists. 
Without these scholars, they would have been lost to us. Much that 
we know of today in the fields of chemistry, medicine, astronomy 
and other branches of scientific endeavour stems from these early 
Arab scholars. 
Although they did not invent them, the Arabs also gave us what we 
call Arabic numerals, including the concept of zero, which derives-
from the Arabic Si&. This is more obvious in the word cipher, 
which or~ginally meant the same thing. 

Arabic has lent many words to European languages, particularly 
Spanish and Portugue~ as a result of the Arab occupation of the 
Iberian Peninsula which lasted for over 700 years. There are also a 
surprising number in English • .Mapzine, calibre, algebra, arsenal 
and admiral, for instance, all come from Arabic; 
The Arabic word for the is al- , in Arabic script J ~ which you am see 
in many borrowings, such as algebra, Alhambra and algorithm. It- is 
always joined on to the next word, so you never see it alone. 
Arable literature 
Popular Arabic literature familiar in the West is mainly confined 
to the Arabian Nights, a collection of tales from many:sources and 
not highly regarded in the Arab world until quite recently, due to 
their popular folk origins. The poetry of Omar Khayyam, the next 
best known piece of Middle Eastern literature in t-he West, is in fact 
Persian, not Arabic. 
,-. 
Arabic literature began with poetry in the pre-Islamic era. There 
were no novels or drama until the 2.othcentury. 
The Muslim religion technically prohibits the artistic representation 
of anything living. Although this was ignored in many Muslim areas, 
it led to a highly developed art of caJligraphy. This is evident in 
inscriptions on religious buildings, and .indeed in all walks of Arab life. 
If you learn Arabic, you will be able to learn more about all these 
things~

world, no one uses Standard Arabic in

but don't believe them. This is because

and taught that it is not 'pure' and has 'no 
is DOD8e08el 
Dialects all derive ultimately &om the old Classical Arabic, and 
share many of the same structures. The chief divergences can 
basically be summed up as follows: 
• Dropping the (in any case unwritten) so-called case and mood 
endings of the noun and verb. 
• Using -.for no apparent reason- different words &om the huge 
Arabic lexicon for the same concept. For instance, the word 
used in this book for to speak is yitkallam, but in other parts of 
the Arab world yiHkii is used. Both are perfectly good Classical 
Arabic words. 
• For historical reasons - often connected with the colonial powers 
-Arabic spoken dialects have absorbed foreign terms. These 
reflect historical and geographical influences. For instance Gulf 
Arabic uses many Persian and Indian words, such as dariishah 
(window, Persian), siidah (str4ight ahead, Indian). Colonial 
influence features most in the North African dialects, which have 
a huge number of French borrowings. Gulf Arabic shows :some 
Portuguese influence '(maiz table), and much English &om the oil 
age (fainri refinery, biTrool in the sense of crude oil) and many 
more terms often connected with technology. 
Spoken Arabic is not often written down, and there is no standard 
way ofspelling it in the Arabic script. The main instances are 
cartoon captions in the newspapers and folk theatre, film and TV 
scripts. Even dialogue in novels tends to be rendered in Standard 
Arabic - which gives it a peculiar stilted flavour - though there 
have been attempts at compromise, often described as 'the third 
language'. In this book the spoken Arabic has ·been simply 
transcribed so that you can read it. 

Introduction 
The purpose of this book is to teach you how to speak and 
understand the spoken Arabic of the Gulf region. This is a group 
of closely related dialects, concentrated on the nations of the Arab 
Gulf from Kuwait down through Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab 
Emirates and the Sultanate of Oman. Many of the dialects of the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are closely related, as is that of 
(especially southern) Iraq. 
It is not a manual of standard, or literary, Arabic, which is not a 
spoken language; for that use Complete Arabic, also. published 
by Teach Yourself. However, so that you may have the added 
pleasure of being able to read road signs, shop names and other 
visual features of the Gulf environment, a simple -ac.count of the 
Arabic alphabet is given. 
This ·book contains everything you need tQ know·about basic Gulf 
Arabic. Work steadily at your own pace, and finish the course: 
don't hurry things or become disheartened after the first couple 
of chapters. This book introduces the language you really need: 
vocabulary and grammatical information have been limited to the 
necessities. 
Of course, if you are living in the Gulf, you should seek help 
from native speakers at every opportunity. Here a slight word of 
warning: there exists in the Gulf a 'pidgin' variety of Arabic, used 
mainly between the Arabs and the huge numbers of expatriate 
workers, mosdy fr.om the Indian sub-continent. If your informants 
come up with something differing radically from what is given in 
this book (ignoring regional differences in pronunciation), check 
that you are not hearing 'pidgin'. 
Arabs very much appreciate any attempt by a foreigner to 
learn their language, and your every effort will be greeted with 
llltradui:IIDII

XVl 
amazement, then enthusiasm and offers of help. It is the key to a 
society of very friendly people which is Qften thought difficult to 
penetrate. Speaking even a little Arabic; will eJ1bance yoilr social life 
and, in the business world, can open doors which would otherwise 
remain closed. 
!ARABIAN GULF! 

How to use tflis, book_ 
The book is divided into units, with all the important information 
that you need for good communication in Gulf Arabic given in the 
first ten units. The last four units refer to specific situations in which 
you might find yourself if you are visiting or resident in the region, 
and build on the words and grammar that you have learned. 
At the beginning of each unit is a summary of the contents, which 
lists what you will be able to do after working through the unit. 
Each unit contains several Dialogues (Hiwaar), which introduce the 
new language in a realistic context. In some instances you may find 
slight variants between the book and the recording. This is due to 
the regional differences in pronunciation. There are two or three 
questions to' help you check your comprehension, and. the answers 
to them and a translation· of the dialogues are in the Key to the 
exercises at the end of the book. 
Key words (Quick V ocab) are giw:n after each dialogue in the order 
in which they appear. Then there are Notes (mulaaHaDHaat),. 
which explain how the language works in the dialogue. 
There are some Cubural tips (ma:luumaat thaqaafiyyab), which 
highlight some of the cultural aspects of life in the Arabian Gulf. 
There are also Author insight boxes, which give you helpful 
language tips based on the authors' experience. 
If you have the recording, listen to it several times alone while 
reading the dialogue and practise repeating the dialogue to yourself 
to improve your pronunciation. Listening is the first step to learning 
a language; don't be disheartened if you don't always understand 
every word- picking out the gist of what is said is the key. 

To sum up what you have learned in the dialogues, Key phrases 
(ta:biiraat ha•mmah) will provide a valuable reference after you 
have worked through all the dialogues in the unit. These contain 
the main language elements and help you with the exercises. 
This is followed by Grammar points (nuqaT naHwiyyah), where 
the constructions contained in the unit are explained and illustrated 
in sentences. Main grammatical concepts have often been grouped 
together for ease of reference, and they gradually build up to 
provide you with all the structures you need to understand and 
speak Gulf Arabic. These should be used for reference. 
The next section, Exercises (tamriiaaat), provides a variety of 
activities so that you can practise using the new words and 
structures. The answers are to be found at the end of the book, in 
the Key to the ex:a-c:ises. Some exercises are on the recording, and 
you may find it helps you to read the transcript of the recording at 
the baclc of the book. 
The next section contains the Arabic aaipt (al-khaTI al-:arabi), 
which gradually takes you through the Arabic alphabet so that 
by the end you will easily be able to recognise simple words and 
notices, road signs and so on. There is then a short exercise for you 
to practise reading Arabic, and again the answers are in the Key to 
the ex:en:ises. 
The final section of each unit is Test yourself, a self-assessment to 
help you monitor your progress before you attempt the next unit. 
The answers to these are also in the Key to the ex:erc:isa. 
Aher the Key to the ex:en:ises and the Transaipts of the recording, 
you will find a reference section. This contains a Grammar 
summary and a section on the Arabic verbs. Every verb you 
come across in the book can be matched in the verb tables with a 
verb which worlcs in the same way. Arabic-En&Jish and Eaglish-
Arabic: glossaries are provided so that you can look up words 
alphabetically.

Pronunciation and transliteration 
Transliteration means expressing a language which uses a different 
writing system (such as Arabic) in terms of symbols based on the 
Roman alphabet. There is no generally accepted system for doing 
this, and you will find that the English versions of, say, road signs, 
differ &om what is given in this book. 
The essential feature of a transliteration system is that it has an 
equivalent for every sound used in the target language. Instead of 
using a complicated system of accents and special symbols, this 
book is more or less restricted to the English alphabet, making use 
of capital letters to distinguish between Arabic sounds which seem 
related to us. For instanct, Arabic has two sorts of t which are 
distinguished in this way: 'tiin' means figs, and 'Tain' means mud. 
There is a full explanation of how to pronounce these sounds in the 
next section. 
Consequently you will not find capital letters used in the book as 
they are conventionally used in English. An exception has, however, 
been made in the case of 'AUaah' Allah, God. 
The Arable sounds

Arabic has some sounds which are difficult for foreigners to 
pronounce. The following table is therefore divided into three parts:

European languages.

Unstable sounds In Gulf Arable 
Gulf Arabic is a collection of related but distinct dialects and 
is not governed by any strict pronunciation rules. Remember 
that, whatever any Arab tells you, the written or literary Arabic 
language is never spoken in everyday life. It exists only in the 
written form, and in formal speeches and religious language. What 
you will hear is dialect or vernacular Arabic. 
XXII 

As a rule, where a literary word is used in parts of the Gulf, this 
is given, as every educated Arab knows the literary language from 
school. If you are living in the Gulf, h01tever, you should note and 
use local expRSsio~ 
Nevertheless, the regional prOIIQDeiations of solllO of-the consonants 
can be confusing. These are explained below. The overall policy 
of this book has been to use the mast common pronunciation 
throughout the area, and, where reasonable, to adopt the version 
closest to the literary language. Again, if a word is pronounced 
differendy where you live or are visiting, use that pronunciation.

The official Arabic sound is identical to English j as in jump, but this

used in Gulf Arabic, where it is replaced by DH.

some words borrowed from the literary language. In such cases, it 
has been transcribed as q. However, the overall common Gulf 
1 
pronunciation is hard g, as in get, but it is also occasionally j as in jet.

Vowels 
• CD,, TR 1, 4:J7 
There are only five common vowels, three of which occur both 
long and short. These have been transcribed as follows: 
aa as in thaalitb this, an elongated emphatic a as in the word and 
in: 'Did he really eat a whole chicken?' 'Yes ... and he ate a 
steak as well.' 
,.__..._...................... xxiii 

a as in abadan never, roughly as in hat 
ii as in kabiir big, like Eve, and French livre 
i 
as in jibin cheese, like big 
uu as in filuus money, like rude, French vous, German Schule 
u as in buldaan countries, like put (never as in cup) 
oo as in tilifoon telephone, like rose as pronounced in Scotland, 
or French beau 
ai as in bait house, like the sound in wait 
The following diphthong also occurs occasionally: 
ay as in aye. The place name Dubai is transcribed dubay. 
Doubled conson•nts 
.. CD,, TR,,637 
Doubled consonants (here written bb, nn, ss etc.) are important in 
Arabic, as they can change the meanings of words radically. They 
are only pronounced in English when they span two words, e.g. 
But Tom, my brother . .. In Arabic, however, they must always be 
pronounced carefully, wherever they occur, with a slight hesitation 
between them, e.g. gaTar is the place-name Qatar, gaTTar means 
dripped, distilled. 
Stress 
'Stress' refers to the syllable in a word which is pronounced more 
emphatically than the rest, e.g. potato, where the stress is on the 
second syllable -ta-. The stressed syllables of words have been 
marked with an acute accent: a, 8a, etc. in the glossaries and the 
first six units so that you become used to where they occur. One 
simple rule, however, is that if a word contains a long vowel (aa, 
uu, etc.) the stress falls on this; and if there is more than one, the 
stress falls on the one nearest the end of the word. 
xxiv 


The Arabic alphabet 
There are several general points to be noted: 
• Arabic is written from right to left'- the opposite of English. 
• Arabic script is always joined or cursive, i.e. there is no 
equivalent of the English text you are now reading, where all the 
letters have separate forms with spaces between them. There are 
no capital letters. 
• In cursive writing letters are joined together by means of 
joining strokes (called ligatures). As a result, Arabic letters have 
slightly different forms, depending on whether they come at the 
beginning, middle, or end of a -word. 
• A few letters do not join to the following -letter. 
• Arabic-writing looks complicated just because it is so different, 
but in fact it is not. Spelling in Arabic is easy, because, with 
a very few-exceptions, all sounds ~e written as they are 
pronounced. There are no diphthongs, i.e. combinations of two 
letters to give a distinct sound, like th, sh, etc. in English. 
• One thing you must get used to in the Arabic script is that short 
vowels, i.e. a, i or u (as opposed to the long vowels aa,·uu and 
ii), are not shown in the script. For instance, the word bank 
(which Arabic has borrowed from English), is written b-n-k. 
Because of the cursive nature of Arabic, it is necessary to give the 
initial, medial and final forms of each letter. Since some letters 
do not join to the one after ~m, a separate form has also been 
included. Although four forms of the non-joiners have been given, if 
you look carefully you will see that there are really only two shapes. 
The Arabic alphabet is given below in its traditional order. Letters 
which do not join to the following one are marked with an asterisk. 
Final is to be interpreted as final after·a joining letter. If the 
preceding letter is a non-joiner, the separate form will be used. If 
xxvi 

you look closely, you can see that final and separate letters are 
usually dongated in form, or have a 'flourish' after them. 
Also, in most cases, the initial form of the letter can be regarded 
as the basic or nucleus form. For example, if you look at baa' 
(the second letter in the following list}, you will see that its basic 
(initial) form is a small left-facing book with a single dot below it. 
The medial form is more or less the same, with a ligature coming 
in from the right (remember you are writing from right to left). 
The final form is the same as the medial, with a little flourish or 
elongation to the left (i.e~ at the end of the word), and the separate 
form is the same as the initial, but again with the flourish to the left. 
Study the letters bearing these features in mind, as many of them 
follow the same principle. The • denotes a 'glottal stop' sound which 
is explained in the pronUDCiation aod transliteration section. Fuller 
descriptions and other hints on deciphering will be given in the units.

In addition to the above, there is one combination consonant laam-
alif. This must be u$ed when this series of letters occurs, and it is a 
non-joiner:

There is a letter which the Arabs call taa' marbauTah and which 
is referred to in this book as the 'hidden t'. This is the Arabic 
feminine ending which only occurs at the end of words, so 
therefore it has only two forms: final (after joiners) and separate 
(after non-joiners). It is always preceded by a short 'a' vowel: 
Final 
Separate 
If you look carefully at this letter, you will see that it looks like a 
haa' with the two dots above of the taa' added, and this is exactly 
what it is. It is normally rendered in speech as a very weak h, 
but in certain combinations of words it is pronounced as t. It has 
therefore been transcribed ash and t accordingly. 
There is one final item called the hamza. This is nouegarded by 
the Arabs as a letter of the alphabet, but as the supplementary sign. 
Its official pronunciation is a glottal stop (as in cockney bottle) 
and it has been transliterated by means of an apostrophe ('). It is 
frequendy omitted in speech, but it is common in written Arabic, 
where it occurs either on its own, or written over an alif, waaw or 
yaa'. (In the last case, the two dots under the yaa' are omitted.) It 
can also occur written below an alif, but this is less common. The 
actual hamza never joins to anything, but its 'supporting' letters 
take the form required by their position in the word:

r.s 
Note that, at the beginning of a word, • is always written above or 
below alif. 
Vowels 
As already mentioned, in. Arabic writing the short vowels are not 
usually marked except in children's school text books; the Holy 
Koran and ancient classical poetry. 
The long vowels are expressed by the three letters alif, waaw and 
yaa'. Alif almost always expresseuhe vowel aa, but waaw and yu! 
can also be consonantal w and y- (as in English wish and yes). 
However, waaw and yaa' can also express the (only) two Arabic 
diphthongs, usually pronounced oo (with waaw) and ai (with yaa'). 
The official pronunciation of these dipthongs is ow as in dawt~ and 
ay as in aye respectively, but these are heard in informal speech 
only in a few words. 
AU this is not as difficult as it sounds, as the real key to Arabic 
words is the long vowels. It will not usually cause serious 
misunderstanding if you pronounce a word with a, u or i (short 
vowels), but it is important to get the long vowels right. 
xxx. 

One further note: the letter yaa' often oecurs at the end of words. It 
is usually pronounced -i, or -ii, but sometimes also -a. In the former 
case, it is usually written with two dots. under it (Cj) and in the 
latter without them(~), but this rule is not, unfortunately, always 
adhered to. 
General 
Since this book is intended to teach you to recognise the Arabic 
script, rather than to learn to write it, the above remarks should 
be sufficient for the purpose. As already mentioned, further 
information and tips will be given in the units. 
Finally, it is better to think of the Arabic script as basically 
handwriting (since it is always cursive, no matter how produced: 
by hand, on a typewriter or computer). For this reason- and by 
dint of what the Arabs regard as the artistic nature of the script, 
calligraphy being a highly developed art in the Arab world -you 
are likely to see more variations of the form of the letten than you 
would in English. 
The most important of these is that, very frequendy, two dots 
above or below a letter are frequendy combined into one dash, 
and three dots (which only occur above) into an inverted v like the 
French circumflex "'. Here is an example showing taa' and thaa': 
c;j 
~ 
There are many other variations, but the most important is the 
writing of(,.- cr siio and shiin as simply long lines, ironing out 
their spilces, and often with a small hook below at the beginning. 
Arabic writing is fun. Look at it as an art form!

, as-salaamu :alai-kum 
This set religious greeting is always addressed by the incomer to a 
group, and it and its reply...always take the same form regardless 
of whom they are addressed to. The same expression can also be 
used for goodbye when taking one's leave. The as- at the beginning 

is a variant of al- (the). Thit is explained in the Arabic saipt section 
at the end of this unit. 
2 kaif H8al-ak/H8al-ic:h 
No verb to be is necessary, so How your condition means How 
(is) your condition, i.e. 'How are you?' Similarly aish akhbaiar-
aklakhbaiar-ic:h means What (is) your news? 
3 Addressing people 
In Arabic you must distinguish between a man and a woman and 
more than one person when addressing people. The first part· of 
the above dialogue is between two men, so you say -ak meaning 
your (to a man) in Haal-ak and akhbaar-ak. 
When you are speaking to a woman, you must say kaif Haal-ic:h 
and aish akhb8ar-ic:h • 
..................................................................................................... 
Insight 
This is the most common pronunciation in the ·Gulf, but• 
you may also hear -ish or even -ik. It makes no difference 
whether you yourself are male or female, only who you are 
speaking to . 
...................................................................................................... 
To speak to more than one person, called the plural form, say 
kaif Haal-kum and aish akhb8ar-kum (see 1 above). 
4 al-Hamdu li-1-J.aah (thanks be to God) 
li-1-l&ah is a contraction of li- + Al-l&ah meaning to God. It is 
Arab etiquette to reply to any enquiry about your health with this 
phrase even if you have just broken both of your legs. 
5 bi-khair 
This means literally in well-being, i.e. good health.

, jaak is of course the English name Jack, muHammad is the 
common Arab name. In English it is spelled many different ways 
(Mohamed, Mohammad, etc.), the transliteration reflects how it 
should be pronounced in Arabic. ingilt&ra is England (ftom the 
French angleterre). 
Insight 
Most names of Western Countries in Arabic are similar to the 
originals. The names of the Arab countries given here are in 
their familiar forms, stripped of 'Kingdom of ..• ', 'State of ... ' 
and so on which feature in some of their official tides .

The first form is the 'correct' one, but most Gulf dialects have an 
aversion to certain combinations of two consonants at the end of 
a word, and tend to add a 'helping' vowel to ease pronunciation. 

These vowels have generally been inserted in this book( in braclcets) 
to aid your listening comprehension, or when they are optional. 
When something is added· to the,word, they are generally left out;

'Certain short words in Arabic are regarded as part of the word 
which follows them. As this often affects pronunciation, this book 
uses hyphens to mark it. The commonest example is al- (the) and its 
variants, but you also have bi- (m) as in bi-kbair and li- (to) as in 
ai-Hamdu li-1-laah, (lit. the praise to God). 
Gender refers to whether a word is regarded as masculine (male) or 
feminine (female). In Arabic, words for human beings are obviously 
masculine for men and feminine for women. However, as in F~ 
there is no neuter gender, and the things we refer to in English as it 
are either he or she in Arabic. 
You must always be conscious of gender in Arabic as it affects other 
words such as pronouns (see below). Fortunately, the vast majority of 
feminine words in Arabic are marked by the ending -ah. 
4 Prenouns 
A pronoun is a kind of shorthand word which refers to a person or 
a thing, such as he, him, his, it, me, my. 
ken min amriika 
Ken is from America. 
h6wwa min amriika 
He is from America. 
al-bait kabiir 
The house is big. (house is masculine) 
huwwa kabiir 
It (he) is big. 
awayy8arah ahUJyah

al-khaTT al-='rabl (Arabk script) ~ 
J.j..t 
al· the 
Look at the dialogues in this unit, and you will notice that al- occurs 
~uendy at the beginning of words. This is the Arabic word for the, 
which is always '\\lritten the same, although it varies sometimes in 
pronunciation (see below). It is always attached to the following word 
and' is written with two fetters, alif\ and Jaam J For obvious reasons it is 
a very common word in the language and a good one to start off with. 
It is easy to recognize as it always comes at the beginning of a word: J1 
There is a special combination Jaam-alif, which is conventionally 
written ':11. When preceded by the initial aHf of the al- it looks like this: 
':i This combination is found in one place name on the map on page 34: 
~\},. ~\ al-imaaraat The (United Arab) Emirates 
You will find the other forms (middle, final etc.) of these letters in the 
alphabet table at the beginning of the book. Note that lllif, like another 
few letters, does not, by convention, join to the letter following it. 
Pronunciation of al- the 
Althou&h it never changes in writing, al- has one peculiarity. If the 
word it is joined to begins with one of the following letters: 
t, th, d, db, r, z, s, sh, S, D, T, DH, 1, n 
the '1' of al- is dropped in speech, and the first letter of the word 
clearly doubled. This is reflected in the transcription system used in 
this book, e.g. al-kuwait, but ar-riyaaDH and ash-shaarjah. This is 
an important convention of pronunciation and you must pronounce 
the double versions of the letters listed above clearly. 
Insight 
If it helps, to begin with, leave a slight pause between them. It 
is much better to say as- ••• saiaamu :8lai-kum than a-salaamu 
:alai-kum (or, for that matter, al-salaam :alai-kum or salaam 
:alai-kum, the last very ohen heard from Europeans). 

nus 
photograph 
illustrates 
the 
unsystematic transliteration of· Arabic 
found on public signs. Whatever 
you encounter, the official correct 
pronunciation is as-suuq (heard in 
some parts of Oman and Iraq), but 
elsewhere in the Gulf you usually hear 
as-suua . 
................................................................................... 
~ .................. . 
Insight 
AB. easy way to remembet which letters this phenomenon 
occurs with is to pronounce them all from the above list. and 
think what your tongue is doing as you say them. You will' 
find that its tip always comes into contact with somewhere in 
the region bounded by the space between the top and bottom 
teeth (e.g. th, dh) and the inside front upper gum (4 d). Only sh 
is a slight exception, but none of the Miter letters set anywhere 
near this point of articulation (b, f. ketc.).

Prlldlce 
As in English (e.g. Belgium, but the Netherlands) some countries in 
Arabic have al- before them, though this the is not usually preserved 
in the English versions of their names. Look at the map and make a 
list of those which do; practise saying the names as you go. 
Now look through the unit again and look for all the Arabic words which 
haYe al- or its altued forms before them. e.g. al-Haal, 8H"tiam(u).

1 sawwaag at-taksi 
The word taxi has the the prefix, so literally it means driver (of) 
the-taxi. fUndug ash-shairaTun. The English name here has been 

Arabized and given the the prefix, so literally it says hotel (of) 
the-Sheraton.

ol.o_,Ja.. 
in shaa' Al-taah This phrase is usually the first Arabic that 
Europeans piclc up. Contrary to popular belief, it does not indica:te 
an element of vague hope or possibility, but has (by the devout 
Muslim) to be prefixed to any reference to an action which has·nof 
yet taken place. 
:afwan In Arabic, as in most languages, one is expected to say 
something in reply to thank you. In the Gulf it can also be used for 
excuse me when asking someone politely to move out of the way.

min wain, min hinaak 
It is better, though not essential, to put min before where, here and 
there when asking or giving directions. It implies which way . .. , that 
way . ... It is, however, quite acceptable to say wain as-suug? (where 
is the market?) 
Insight 
:a 1-yisaar 
'Elision' means missing out or gliding over a vowel or letter, 
and it occurs a lot in Arabic, especially with (a)l- (the). Here 
:ala + al- has been reduced to :a 1-. This is not a rule, but it is 
better to get used to hearing it. 
wal-matHaf 
This time the wa has elided with the al-. Sometimes wa sounds like 
a short English 'oo', usually when it comes before a consonant. In 
such cases it has been written w: 
. hina dairah w hinaak dubay Here is Deira and there is Dubai.

1 tis:iin kiilo 
The (borrowed) word kiilo(mit(i)r) is often shortened to kiilo as 
here. The fact that it then coincides with kiilo (ghrlam), the measure 
of weight, doesn't seem to worry anybody.

ma:luum6atthaquffyyah (Cultul'lll tips) ~~ 
ol..~ 
Most of the cities of the Gulf were laid out during the 70s and 80s, 
mainly as a result of the roclceting price of oil, and apart from the 
oldest parts or what remains of them, you find they are very spread 
out, because space is generally not at a premium. 
The exceptions are where cities have grown up around natural 
features like the creeks of Dubai and Sharjah, and where the 
mountains around the Capital Area in Oman, for example, have 
forced development within a comparatively limited space. 
A grid pattern of streets is usually linked by a number of roundabouts, 
which have such decorative features as fountains, clocks or even 
giant coffee-pots, and impressive flowerbeds and carefully tended 
lawns. The roundabouts themselves have become landmarks.

nuqaT naHwfyyah (Grammar points) ~ 
.l:.Aa· 
1 How to say please 
The most common way is to use the phraSe min fiDHl-ak which 
means something like 'by your favour'. Like kaif Haal-ak (How are 
you?) in Unit I, the ending must change according to whom you are 
directing the request to: 
min fiDHl-ak 
min fiDH1-ich 
min fiDHl-kum 
to a man 
to a woman 
to more than one person 
law samffit (if you permit) is slighdy more formal or palite. The 
endings again change, this time according to a different pattern. You 
must say: 
lawsamaHt 
lawsam8Hti 
lawsamaHtu 
2 There Is and there are 
to a man 
to a woman 
to more than one person 
These are expressed in Arabic by the word fiih. The h is silent, but 
it is convenient to write the word this way to distinguish it front fii 
meaning in. Remember there is no word for a, an. 
fiih fUndug 
There is a hotel 
fiih fUndug fii dubay 
There is a hotel in Dubai 
To make a question, just raise your voice at the end of the sentence 
fiih fUndllg? 
Is there a hotel? 
The negative (there isn't/is no ... there aren't/are no ... , ) is maa fiih: 
maa fiih bank 
There isn't a bank, there is no bank

.......................................................................................................................................... . 
Insight 
Mainly in Bahrain you will hear the Persian borrowing hast 
used instead of fiih. In Kuwait and Iraq they say aku . 
...................................................................................................... 
28 
These forms of the verb (technically lcnown as imperatives) are frequendy 
used in giving directions. Those encountered in this unit are: 
ma: 
ruuH 
)iff 
fawwit 
khudh 
go out 
go 
turn 
pass, go past 
take 
These also have to be altered according to the person spoken to, and 
they take the same endings as samaHt (see above), so you have to 
say il1a:i, niuHi, liffi, fawwiti and khudhi to a woman, and iTia:u, 
niuHu, liffu etc. to more than one person. 
4 Numbers - first, second, third etc. 
These are lcnown as ordinal numbers, because they tell us the order 
things come in, and they are obviously common in giving directions. 
awwal 
thaani 
thaalith 
raabi: 
aakbir 
first 
second 
third 
fourth 
last 
Unlike normal adjectives (see Note 5) these can sometimes come 
before the noun they describe, especially when giving directions: 
khudh awwal shaari: :ala 1-yamiin Take the first street on the right 
There is no need here for a word for the. 

s Noun/adjective phrases 
NoWlS refer to people, ~ 
and ideas; adjectives describe nouns. The 
correct use of noun/adjective phrases is fundamental to speaking Arabic. 
With the sole exception of the ordinal numbers in the previous 
section the rules are as follows: 
1 The adjective comes after the noun: noun + adjective. 
2 It agrees with the noun in gender (masculine/feminine): 
masc. noun + masc. adjective 
fem. noun + fem. adjective 
Nearly all Arabic adjectives form the feminine by adding the suffix 
(ending) -ah. 
J The use or omission of al- (the) has a powerful effect on the meaning 
of such phrases. 
The absence of al- in the following is, for emphasis, marked with 
a triangle fl. There are three basic phrase types: 
(a) no al- on either word: !l naun + !l adjective 
This produces an indefinite phrase: 
maTaar kabiir 
sayyaarah Sagh.iirah 
a big airport (masc.) 
a small car (fern.) 
(Remember that Arabic does not have a word for a or an.) 
(b) al- on both words: al- noun+ al- adjective 
This produces a definite phrase: 
al-maTaar al-kabiir 
as-sayyaarah aS-Sagh.iirah 
the big airport 
the small car 
Unlu Wherels ... J 
29 

30 
(c) al- on the noun, but not the adjective: al- noun+ ll adjective 
This produces a sentence which, in English, would have the 
verb is or are, which as you already know is not used in 
Arabic: 
al-maTaar kabiir 
as-sayyaarah Sagbiirah 
The airport is big. 
The car is small. 
These three phrase types are fundamental to Arabic. Learn the 
examples above by heart and, as you progress, constandy construct 
similar phrases and sentences with the new words you learn. Here 
are some examples from this unit: 
Type 1: 
fiih bank gariib min hina? 
Type2: 
al-bank al-waTani 
al-markaz at-tij Sari 
Type·3: 
al-fUndug ba:iid :an· 
al-maTaar 
Is there a bank near here 
(lit. a near bank)? 
the National Bank 
the commercial centre 
The hotel is far from the 
airport. 
In Type 3, a pronoun can substitute for the first noun, as in: 
laa, huwwa gariib 
No, it's near. 
If you find that you can't take all this in at once, leave it and come 
back to it. 
e How to say this Is, these ,,. 
In Arabic, the word haadha (this) is also a pronoun. It makes a verb-
less sentence if it is followed by a word without al-. 

If the noun it refers to is feminine, use h&adhi. and if it is plural, use 
haadh6ol or haadheel.

al-khan al-:6rabl (Arable script) cr..,.J I~ 
I 
Since your main purpOse in learning the script is to recognize Arabic, 
here are the next two most common letters: 

m miim in Arabic. This letter occurs frequendy because, apart from 
occurring internally and finally in words, it is a common prefix in Arabic. 
Like most Arabic letters, it has three forms, depending on whether it 
occurs at the beginning of a word, or in the middle or at the end. 
Name 
Initial 
Medial 
Final 
Separate 
Pronunciation 
miim 
..0 
..0. 
r 
f" 
m 
When it follows laam- frequendy after al- (the) ..ll (ai-m ••• ). 
Here, you will see that the ali£ has been moved to the left of the letter 
and the litde circle has been filled in. 
·············!···················································································41:•••• 
Insight 
·Remember that all Arabic letters join to the one before them 
(reading right to left). However so~e, by convention, do not 
join to the one after them (ali£ in the previous chapter was one 
of them). 'Beginning' (or 'initia.l'), 'middle' and 'final' letters 
should be interpreted in this context . 
......................................................................................................

Practice 
Try to distinguish the miims in the following words from this lesson 
and find out their meanings. The first word is the only one which 
begins and ends with miim. Can you work out which it is? The 
others are transliterated for you: 
madrasah 
miina 
al-markaz al-tijaari 
maHaiTat al-baaS 
Unlt:a .......... 1' 
35 

36 
Answer: the first word is maT:am (restaurant). 
The other very common letter which you should learn to recognize is 4. 
This letter is easy to spot as it only occurs at the end of words, and 
actually marks.the feminine ending -ah. Watch out for it on signs, 
place-names etc. Refer back to the place-names and map in Unit 1 
and see how often it occurs. 
Now look for it in some of the words you have learned in this unit:

kaif al-:aa'ilah (how is the family?) It is considered impolite to 
enquire too closely about an Arab family, especially the female 
element, unless you know that family very well. This phrase or 
the alternative kaif al-ah(a)l is the accepted way to do it. ah(a)l is 
another word for family, kinsfolk. 
Hayyaa-k Al-laah (lit. God give you life) is another well-wishing 
phrase. It can mean goodbye as here, or even thank you depending 
on context. 

Al-laah (God, Allah) has been spelled with a capital A in this book 
out of respect. It is actually composed of al- (the) plus laah which is 
a contraction of ilaah (a god) , i.e. the God. Like all words beginning 
with al- the (in this case capital) a can be elided, as you have already· 
seen in ai-Hamdu li 1-laah (praise[be] to God). 
n~qaT naHw(yyah (Grammar points) ~ 
Jcaij 
, Possessives 
Possessive constructions express the idea of belonging. 
For example, in Unit 1 the endings or suffixes, applied to the words 
Haal (condition) and akhbaar (news) denote your. 
kaif Haal-ak 
aish akhb&ar-ich 
how (is) your condition (to a man) 
what (is) your news (to a womanJ 
The same meaning of belonging can be expressed by placing two 
nouns together, the second one usually having al- (the) before it: 
saww&ag at-taksi 
SUHib ad-dukkaan 
ragam at-tilif6on 
sharikat al-khaliii li t-tiiaarah 
taxi driver (lit. driver of the taxi) 
shopkeeper (lit. owner of the shop) 
phone number (lit. number of the 
telephone) 
GulfTradmg Company (lit. company 
of the Gulf for the trading) 
The last example illustrates the important rule that feminine nouns 
ending in -ah change this to -at when they are used as the first part 
of such constructions. 
Note that the first word must never have al- placed before it. Instead 
it is placed before the second word. The indefinite equivalent of 
such phrases is saww&ag t8ksi and Sa.Hib dukkaan (a taxi driver, 
a shopkeeper).

2 Numbers

Here are all the basic Arabic numbers. You should not try to learn 
them all at once, but use this list as a reference. 
Using numbers to count things (e.g. six houses, three cars) will be 
dealt with in UnitS· Here you'll find mainly telephone numbers, and 
'abstract' numbers (e.g. in arithmetical calculations). Both of these 
use the independent form.

M•klng compound numbers 
(a) When you say any number above 20, you are making a compound 
number, and the last two numbers always have wa (and) between 
them. 
(b) The w~rds are in the same order as in English, except that the 
units come before the tens. 
(c) When you are talking about 200, you must use the special 'dual' 
form, miitain, but for 300 or more use miyyah. 
(d) When you are talking about 2000 you must also use the 'dual' 
plural, alfain, but for three thousand or more use the normal 
plural, aalaaf.

Here are two well-known Arabic story titles which include numbers: 
alf lailah wa 1ailab (a) thousand nights and (a) night, (i.e The 
Thousand and One Nights, or The Arabian Nights) 
:ali baaba wa 1-arba:iin Haraami Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves 
... and a proverb from Abu Dhabi! 
al-bild sab:ab wa 1-baHar sab:ab (lit. 'the line is seven and the sea is 
seven', used to express just making ends meet) 
(al-bild is the plumbline used to test the depth of the sea infathoms} 
J Telephone numbers 
Telephone numbers in spoken Arabic are given in a straight series of 
digits- just.like English, e.g. 123 456 (one two three, foUl' five six). 
Sifir zero, is the origin of our English word cipher. The Arabs were 
responsible for getting Europe off the Roman numbering· system 
(XVII etc.) in the Middle Ages, and introduced the zero into our 
numbering system. 
We speak of Arabic (as opposed to Roman) numerals, but the Arabs 
actually borrowed them from the Indians. Hence the different forms. 

4 Asking for people on the teleph~ne 
You simply say ... (name of person) mawjuud?. This is the standard 
phrase for asking if someone is there or present. mawj6ud· is an 
adjective, describing a thing or penon, so it has to agree in gender. 
If the person in question is a female, it becomes mawjuudah: 
:abd al-:aziiz mawjuud? 
faaTunah mawjUudah? 
aywa, :abel al-:aziiz mawjuud 
laa, faaTunah muu mawjuudah 
Is AbdelAziz there? 
Is F11timah there? 
Yes, AbdelAziz is here. 
No, F11tim~~h is not here.

al-khaTT al-='rabl (Arable script) <F~ I ~I 
In this Unit you'll take a rest from the Arabic alphabet and deal 
instead with the numbers. 
Although the Arabic script is written from right to left, the numerals 
are written from left to right as in the West. This may seem bizarre, 
but it is a fact. As your eye scans a piece of Arabic,· it has to reverse 
direction when numerals appear. 

This problem is compounded in dates of day + month + year where 
the order of these elements is right to left, but the numbers expressing 
them go in the opposite direction. So where in English the 17th of 
December 2010 would be 17/1212010, in an Arabic context it would 
be written 2010/11117-\ Y • \ • \\ Y\ \ V. 
Some bilingual English/ Arabic computer word processing packages 
even have a special way to accommodate this, so that you can keep 
typing in the same direction! 
Nevertheless the numerals are fairly easy to learn. If you look at them 
closely and use a bit of imagination, you can often see a connection 
to the European version. Try turning them sideways; for instance, 
Arabic turned 90 degrees to the left and with the tail deleted is similar 
to our 3. The same applies to 7 and some others. 
Since the computational system and direction of writing are the same 
as in the West, you have nothing more to learn.

Insight 
In handwritingt 3 is written like 
a printed 2 (i.e. with one concave 
curve at the top instead of two) 
and in such cases 2 is written 
with a convex (upward facing 
cucve) at the top: 
Some countries have adopted the western form of numerals. Look 
on this as a bonus!

Insight 
ashk6r-ak is a slightly more formal variant of sbUkran (thank 
you). Because this is a verb, meaning literally I thank you, 
the ending must change· according to whom you are speaking 
to. So to a woman you say asbkUr-icb, and to several people, 
asbkUr-kum (the same endings you are familiar with from 
kaif Haal-ak etc.). sbUkran never changes .

1 Asking the time 
The word saa:ah means in English hour, clock, or watch. As the -ab 
ending tells us, it is feminine in gender. To ask the time, say: 
kam as-s8a:ah? or as-saa:ah kam? 
kam as-saa:ah min faDID-aklich? 
What (is) the time? 
What's the time, please? 
According to context, as-saa:ah kam (but not kam as-saa:ah) can 
also mean at what time: 
as-saa:ah 1wn tiiji? 
(at) what time will you come? 

2 Telling the time

Twenty-five past and twenty-five to the hour are expressed in Arabic 
as the hour plus a half less five and the hour plus a half plus five 
respectively: 
as-saa:ah khamsah wa-nuSS ilia khams 
as-saa:ah kbamsah wa-nuSS wa khams

More formally (and less commonly) all times can be stated using the 
preceding hour plus the number of minutes:

10.45 

This is the method used by speaking clocks and other automats, 
and also sometimes on official radio and television announcements. 
These, however, usually use the literary Arabic forms of the numbers, 
which differ a lot (and are best avoided!). 
J Saying at a particular time 
Arabic requires no additional word, so as-saa:ah khamsah can mean 
(it is) five o'clock or at five o'clock: 
mUmkin tiiji s-Ua:ah thalaathah ilia nlba: 
Can you come at

before noon (am) or afternoon (pm), the Arabs have a set of words 
indicating parts of the day which may be placed after stating 
the time.

The working day in the Gulf starts between seven and eight in 
the morning, and finishes between one and two in the afternoon. 
Most ministries and other government departments are then closed 
for the day, but the souk and most shopping centres open again 
at about four in the afternoon and stay open until eight or nine 
in the evening, when the temperature has cooled down. This is the 
time for families to go out shopping together, and you see groups of 
women choosing dress materials, families buying their food for the 
week, and everybody just enjoying the chance to get out for a walk. 
Some families even take picnics to eat on the grass verges, while the 
children play around them. 
Friday is the Muslim day of prayer, and in the Gulf all offices and 
some large shops are closed on Thursday afternoon and all day 
Friday. For the souk and other small establishments, however, it is 
a seven day week.

The Gulf Arabs (both male and female) are fond of perfumes. Every 
home in the Gulf has at least one mijmar (incense burner), and these 
take many forms, depending on fashion and location. They are 
usually made of earthenware, although nowadays people often have 
electric ones. 

A few live coals are put into the 
burner, and a sweet-smelling 
substance is dropped on the 
coals. This could be sandalwood 
(the most expensive if it is of good 
quality), frankincense (a dried 
resin from Oman or Yemen), or a 
homemade mixture of resins and 
woods mixed with sugar, all of 
which are sold in the souk either 
loose or in small metal tins. 
Clouds of perfumed smoke then 
rise into the room for half an 
hour or so. The mijmar is placed 
in the sitting room for guests, or 
brought out.at the end of a visit 
and passed around the company, 
so that the smoke can be wafted into their clothes before they depart.

This is a very common expression. It is used when politely offering 
someone something, to take a seat, accept food or (as here) money, 
enter a room, car etc. It is actually an imperative verb, so it takes the 
.ending -i when addressed to a woman, and -u when addressed to 
more than one person. The first a is often omitted in normal speech.

One of the most amazing sights in any town in the Gulf is that of 
the gold souk, where dozens of small shops blaze with light and the 
glitter of gold. Generally the gold is either 18 or 22ct., and it looks 
yellower than the 9ct. gold usually sold in the West. 
Jewellery is always sold by weight, and craftsmanship doesn't much 
affect the price. Arab ladies often sell back their older pieces of jewellery 
to be melted down and made into new pieces, so that they can keep 
abreast of fashion, Nobody is interested in second-hand jewellery, 
although old silver is collected by tourists. The shopkeeper will always 
expect to bargain with you, and you should never accept his first price.

1 How to say have 
There is no verb to have in Arabic. Instead Arabs use a preposition, 
:ind, meaning something like with, in the possession of and a 
pronoun suffix. 
It is common but not essential to state the subject or the person 
before :ind: 
ana :ind-i sayyaarah I have a car (lit. with me [is] a car). 
muHsimmad :ind-uh mars&idis? Does Mohammad have a Mercedes? 
laa, :ind-uh toy6ota No, he has a Toyota. 
(ana) :ind-i 
(inta) :ind-ak 
(inti) :ind-ich 
(huwwa) :ind-uh 
(hiyya) :ind-haa 
(niHna) :ind-na 
(intu) :ind-kum 
(hU:mma) :ind-hum 
Insight 
I have 
you have (masc.) 
you have (fem.) 
he (it) has 
she (it) has 
we have 
you have 
they have 
You sometimes hear :ind shortened to :id, especially before 
suffixes beginning with a consonant, e.g. :id-na (we have). 
2 That, those 
These are not used so frequently as in English, and are usually 
restricted to emphatic or contrastive situations. The three forms are:

3 How to say prices and numbers of things 
Use this section for reference, and you will find that with practice it 
becomes second nature to you! 
(a) To say one of anything in Arabic use the singular noun followed 
by WaaHid (masc.) or waaH(i)dah (fern.) 
riyaal waaHid 
sayyaarah waaHidah 
one riyal (masc.) 
one car (fern.) 
(b) To say two of anything, Arabic uses a special form called the 
dual. To form this, add -am to the singular. 
riyaalain 
sayyaar(a)tain 
two riyals (masc.) 
two cars (fern.) (the a in 
brackets is often omitted in 
pronunciation) 
The word two is only used for special emphasis, after the no1,111: 
waladain ithnain 
bintain thintain 
Insight 
two boys 
two girls 
The stress moves to the end of the word. If the w01;d has the 
feminine ending -ah, this changes to -at. 
(c) Between three and ten of anything, use the number (agreeing in 
gender with the noun) followed by the noun in its plural form: 
thalaathah daraahim. 
thalaath sayyaaraat ~ 
three dirhams 
three cars 
Units How much II thlal 
79 

80 
(d) For 11 and above, usc the independent sender (i.e. unchanging) 
number and singular noun: 
iHda:sbar dirham 
iHda:sbar aayy&arah 
11 dirhams 
11 cars 
For quick reference, usc the table below:

4 Describing things 
In Arabic a describing word, or adjective, comes after a noun and 
has to agree with it. Nearly all adjectives form their feminine by 
adding -ah. The same feminine ending is also used when describing 
plural things (as opposed to people). 
mijmar kabiir 
silsilah rakbiiSah 
bayaatri Sagbiirah 
a big incense burner (masc. noun) 
a cheap chain (fem. noun) 
small batteries (plural of things) 
A few adjectives, mosdy referring to the main colours, have irregular 
feminine forms, e.g. 
aibyaDH/baiDHa 
8swad/s6oda 
akhi>HarlldW>Hra 
aHmar/Hamra

s Comparing things 
When you say that something is bigger or taller than something else, 
you are using a comparative adjective. English usually forms this 
comparative by 'adding -er, but -Arabic makes changes in the word, 
and the forms will be given as they occur. 
These adjective$ -are the same for both masculine and feminine, and 
the word for than is min.

The same fonnation is used for the superlative (ending in -est in English). 
(a) al- noun followed by al- comparative: 
al-fUndug al-akbar 
aT-Tayyaatah al-asra: 
the biggest hotel 
the fastest aeroplane 
Note that there is no change for gender. 
(b) comparative without -al followed by noun without -al: 
akbar fUndug 
Ura: Tayyaiarah 
aTwalwalad 
aSghar sayyaiarah 
the biggest hotel 
the fastest aeroplane 
the tallest boy 
the smallest car 
The second construction (b) is more common in practice. 
e The words for not 
muu or muub is used with nouns and adjectives, and maa with verbs 
and all other words.

In this unit you will learn to read banknotes. There are several new 
letters involved, but they will be repeated and explained more fully 
in future units. At least, if you are solvent, you will have a ready-
made crib in English on the back of the note! 
The values are generally printed in the middle of the Arabic side 
of the note at the bottom, and the writing is usually quite clear, 
although some countries use decorative calligraphy which is more 
difficult to read. The number of units is written before the currency 
name, except for waaHid according to the rules given in this lesson, 
so look carefully to see where the currency name begins. 
Wherever you are in the Arabian peninsula, your local currency 
will be either riyals, dirhams or dinars. Here is the full set of these 
currencies, phonetically-transcribed and in Arabic: 
riyaal J~,; 
dirham ~,;J 
diinaar ,;~J 
riyaalaat ~ 'i ~J 
daraahim ~I,;J 
danaanfir ~UJ 
These forms reflect the Arabic spelling more accurately than the 
English equivalents printed on the notes. Remember again that, in 
Units tt.wmuchl•thls7 
85 

86 
Arabic, the short vowels .are not usually written, so for instance, 
dirham is written simply d-r-b-m. The long vowels (doubled in our 
transcription: aa, ii, uu) are, however, represented in the saipt (so 
riyaal is r-y-aa-1).

You met the letter alif in Unit 1 as the first letter of the word al- (J •) 
the. In that word it represents a short 'a', but in the middle of words 
it usually represents a long a (aa) in the transcription. There is a long 
a in riyaal and in diinaar. The singular dirham does not have one, but 
its plural dar8ahim does. (Remember that the plural in Arabic is only 
used after the numerals 3-10, so expect it only on 5 and 10 unit notes.) 
r Look for the initial form in riyaal J ~J and dirham ~ 
J.J, and 
the final in (plural) dallaanfir ~~.J. 
y is used to mark the long ii vowels in diinaar J ~J and its plural 
danaanfir ~ 
~.J. 
occurs at the end of riyaal J~J· 
t occurs at the end of riyaalaat ~ 
~ ~J where it has its independent 
form after the non-joiner alif (here in its combination form laam-
alif, see alphabet table). 
d in its initial form occurs at the beginning of dirham ~J.J and 
diinaar .;I~.J and their respective plurals. 
h occurs in dirham ~.;.J and its plural (in both cases in its initial 
form after the non-joiners rand alif repectively). 
m It occurs here as the final letter of dirham ~.;.J and its plural 
daraahim ~I J.J. 
Practise recognising these words on your own bank notes or the 
photographs in this unit and make note of the individual letters for 
future use. 
1nsight 
On the 20 and 50 unit notes, an alif is added to the singular of 
the currency name. This is a rule of written Arabic, and does 
not alter the pronunciation.

Insight 
yai:oi lit. it means. This is perhaps the most over-used word 
in Arabic (all dialects). Depending on the tone of voice, it has 
a thousand meanings, the most common being 'I am having 
a pauu to think' (Eng. 'um, er'). Start listening for it and 
practise using it right away! 
ma:luum6at thaqutlrPh (Cultural tips) 
~lti~l.o~ 
Everywhere in the Gulf you see little stalls set up in the markets 
where fresh fruits are squeezed for juice. The most common _are 
orange and lime or lemon. Restaurants often have a colourful row 
of containers of fruit juices in the window. 

96 
Fresh fruit is widely available, as orange and lemon trees fruit 
in the Gulf in the winter, and mangoes and papayas and other 
exotic fruits ripen durins the summer. Small shops selling snacks 
and drinks may just have a fridge full of cartons and cans of 
drinks costing only a few fils or baiza each. People drink a lot of 
mineral water and all the Gulf countries have 'branded' and bottled 
spring water.

1 Verbs In the present tense 
There are only two tenses in Arabic, the present tense and the past 
tense. The present tense is used for all actions which are not yet 
complete, and the past for all actions which have been completed. 
All Arabic verbs are formed from a basic stem; both tenses are 
formed by adding prefixes and/or suffixes to the stem. 
The present tense stem for the word to drink is -shrab, so here is 
the verb with its prefixes and suffixes, separated by hyphens for 
clarity. 
The same prefixes and suffixes are used for virtually all verbs in the 
present tense, although the stem may change in certain verbs. However, 
the vowels of the prefixes are often modified to help pronunciation. In 
this unit, for example, you have aakul (I eat), yaakul (he eats), taakul 
(she eats), and n6ogaf (we stop), y6ogaf, t6ogaf. See the appendix for 
both of these types of verbs, and for present or past stems. 

Singular 
a-shrab 
I drink, am drinking 
tl-shrab 
you (mas c.) drink, are drinking 
ti-shrab-lin 
you (fern.) drink, etc. 
yl-shrab 
he drinks 
tl-shrab 
she drinks 
Plural 
na-shrab 
we drink 
ti-shrab-uun 
you (plural) drink 
yi-shrab-uun 
they drink 
l
······in~~·:·:·:·:::·=·:·:::·::···· 
and inta tisbrab equally mean you drink, you are drinking (masc.) • 
...................................................................................................... 
98 
2 Saying what you want or don't want 
yiriid = he wants: The present tense stem is -riid, so you need to add 
the prefix (and suffix if required): 
(inta) tiriid phwah? 
laa, maa ariid gahwah 
Do you want coffe~? 
No, I don't want coffee. 
Often you can use this verb with a second one as in I want to drink ... 
and where you would use the word to in English, Arabic uses a second 
present tense verb. This kind of construction is calltd a verb string. 
aish tiriidiin tishrabiin 
tiriiduun tishrabuun shay? 
nariid nashUuf bass 
ariid asht8ri kbanjar 
What do you (fem.) wtlnt to drink? 
{lit. what [do} you-want you-drink?) 
Do you (plural) want to drink 
anything? 
We ;ust want to look. 
I want to buy a dagger. 

3 saying that you prefer something 
yifaDIIDHal (to prefer): The present tense stem is faDIIDHal. 
tifaDIIDHal shaay aw g&hwah? 
afaDIIDHal shaay 
Do you prefer tea 
or coffee? 
I prefer tea. 
·················································································· ..................... ! 
Insight 
Do not confuse this with tfaDIIDHal used when offering 
something to someone, where the 't' is part of the stem . 
...................................................................................................... 
4 Saying that you like or dislike things 
If you are talking of something your feelings don't change about, use 
the verb yiHl'bb (to like, love). 
Note that what you are talking about must be definite; that is, it 
must have al- (the) before it, as in French 'j'aime le chocolat': 
(inta) tiHibb ar-riyaaDHah? 
laa, maa aHt'bb ar-riyaaDHah 
(inti) maa tiHibbiin al-18Ham? 
ana aHtob al-mooz 
Do you like sport? 
No, I don't like sport. 
Don't you ((em.) like meat? 
I like bananas. 
s Saying you might be able to do something 
In Arabic you put the word mUmkin before the verb to express the 
possibility of doing something: 
mUmkin tisawwii-li sandwiich 
baiDH bi-duun SalaTah? 
Could you make [for] 
me an egg sandwich 
without salad? 
Note that the verb must agree with the person (potentially) doing the 
action, but mUmkin never changes. 
"'*• .,... .......,

6 Me/my, you/your, hlmlhls, etc. 
These words belong to the class of pronouns. The independent 
pronouns (ana, inta, etc.) introduced in Unit 1 are used when the 
person referred to is doing something. 
However, there is another set of pronouns, in the form of suffixes, 
in such phrases as: 
aish akhbaaraak 
ism-i saalim 
What is your news? 
My name is Salim. 
When used with nouns they express possession (my, his, our, etc.), but 
in Arabic they are also used after verbs and other words to express the 
equivalent of English me, him, it, us, etc: 
nasawwii-ha 
we will make her (i.e. it) 
You have already seen these pronouns at work with :ind- the Arabic 
equivalent of to have, but literally meaning with me, with you, etc. 
(see Unit 5). 
In this book they are separated from the words they join on to by 
hyphens for the sake of clarity. 
Singular 
-i (-ni with verbs) 
me, my (This is the only one which 
has two distinct forms.) 
-ak 
you (masc.), your 
-ich 
you (fern.), your 
-uh 
him, his, it, its 
-ha 
her, it, its 
Plural 
-na 
us, our 
-kum 
you, your 
-hum 
them, their 
100 

Here are a few examples: 
(a) with a noun to show possession of a thing: 
ism-i 
akh-i 
ism-ak 
ism-uh 
my name 
my brother 
your name 
his name, its name 
(b) with a verb, where the pronoun is the object of the verb (i.e. the 
action is done to it): 
ashlair-ak 
asbuuf-ak 
kballii-na noogaf 
(c) with a preposition: 
I thank you 
I (will) see you 
let us stop (lit. let-us we-stop) 
aisb :ind-kum min akil? 
What kind of food do you have? 
(lit. What with you from food?) 
tisawwii-li 
(you) make for me (li 'for• + -i 'me') 
Note the following points: 
(a) When a noun ends in -ab, the 'hidden t' appears and the -ab 
changes to -at before the suffix: 
as-sayyaarab 
sayyaarat-ak 
sayyaarat01uliliounad 
the car 
your (masc.) car 
Muhammad's car 
(b) No word for the is used when a pronoun suffix is added. 
(c) To say my, me, use -i with nouns or prepositions, and -ni with 
verbs. All the other suffixes are the same whatever type of word 
they are used with: 
Sadiig-i 
jamb-uh 
my friend 
next to him. 

mUmkin asaa:id-ak 
a:Tfi-ni 
can I help you? 
give [to] me 
(d) If a word ends in a vowel, this becomes long and stressed, and if 
the suffix begins with a vowel, this vowel is omitted: 
with her 
let us 
ma:aa-ha (ma:a+-ha) 
khallfi-na (khllli+-na) 
aish fii-k? (fii+-ak) 
what's the matter with you? 
(lit. what [is] in you?) 
nashtarii-h (nashtliri+-uh) we buy it (him) 
Most prepositions take a suffix without difficulty, but some have to 
be modified, and we will point them out to you as you meet them.

al-khaTT al-:jrabl (Arable script) cr.~ I .JUJ I 
Vowels In Arable 
As you know, short vowels are not normally represented in everyday 
Arabic script, but only in children's text books, the Holy Koran and 
classical texts used by scholars, where they are indicated by small 
marks above and below the consonants like this: 
106 

This way of writing is possible in Arabic is because the language 
uses a restricted number of word patterns. For exa·mple, if C 
represents any consonant, there is no n'ative (written) Arabic word 
which can look like CiCuC, while CuCi (and CaCaC, CaCiC and 
others) are common. Frankly, much is leh to guesswork. Hamad 
(a man's name) and the word Hamd praise as in al-Hamdu 
li-llaah are written identically in the Arabic script. It was once 
said 'In other languages one has to read to be able to understand: 
in Arabic one has to understand in order to read'. This, as far 
as reading aloud is concerned, is not far from the truth. As your 
knowledge of the language grows, 'providing' the short vowels 
becomes much easier, as the context usually makes it clear which 
possible combination is meant. At this stage, reading road signs 
and notices and so on, you will learn what to expect as your 
vocabulary increases, and this is the only way to tackle the 
problem. 
However, long vowels are much more important than short ones, 
and are consistently shown except in a very· few common words. 
To identify word structures you should look for these long vowels. 
There are only three long vowels recognized in Arabic. TheBe" ate 
aa, uu, and ii. The other two used in this book, ·oo and ai, are 
regarded as variants of uu and ii respectively, and are written 
identically to them. aa is always written with an ali£ (except in one 
or two common exceptions), and this letter has no other sound in 
the language. 
At the beginning of a word ali£ usually represents a short a, as in J I 
al- the (see Unit 1). ii The word .;~J dinar illustrates the use of the 
Arabic letter yaa' to mark the long ii in the first syllable. Ifis easily 
recognized as it is the only Arabic letter with two dots under it. This 
same letter can mark the sound ai as in bait house. 
uu The third long vowel marker is the letter waaw. It has only two 
forms ,J and ~ as it does not join to the following letter. It is easy to 
recognize, as it looks like a large comma with a hollow top. It also 
marks the vowel oo. 
Unit. Are you hlllltiiYl i 07 

Pick out the long vowels in this well-known name. 
Remember that alif almost always represents aa, except at the 
beginning of a word, but waaw and yaa' in any position can also 
have the consonantal values of w as in 'went' and y as in 'yes'. In 
practice, though, they are more ohen long vowels. Long vowels in 
Arabic are also important to pronunciation. A lot of 'pairs' of Arabic 
first names differ only in the distribution of their vowels - but to the 
Arabs they are as different as Jules and Jim. 
In the following exercise, try to spot which name is which. This is 
not an exercise in reading, as you don't know all the letters yet, but 
practice in picking out the all-important long vowels. Remember 
that if a word has a long vowel, the stress goes on that vowel. If it 
has more than one long vowel, the stress goes on the one nearest the 
end of the word.

1 :aa'ilah (family) 
114 
The apostrophe represents a glottal stop (see Pronunciation guide 
at the beginning of the book). This is not a common sound in 
the middle of words in Gulf Arabic where it often changes to 
'y' (:aayilah). 
:aa'ilat-i (my family) is the feminine possessive where the -ah has 
changed to -at, and the sufftx ending is -i (my). 

2 aishgacld Saar la-k (how long have you ... ?) done something., Jived 
somewhere, etc. 
Saar never changes, but the suffix pronoun after 1(i)- to, few and 
the main verb (always present tense) have to be altered to suit the 
person referrtd to. 
3 aishgadd (how long, for what period/extent?)

ma:luumaat thaqaaflyyah (Cultural tips) ~lti ~L._,Ja... 
It was mentioned in Unit 3 that it is better not to enquire too clo~ly 
about an Arab family. However, once you get to know an Arab 
well, he will welcome you into his family and show a real interest in 
yours, particularly in any children. Arabs take great pleasure in their 
children, and are very indulgent towards them! 
Men should nevertheless be careful about mentioning an Arab's 
womenfolk. Of course some families are more liberal than others, 
but it is safest not to mention the female members of the family 
directly or (if you are a man) to expect to see them when you go on 
a visit or for a meal. 
Arab families (and.e~ended families) are much more close-knit than 
ours in the West, so you need to learn the relationship words (men 
bearing in mind the warning above about asking after womenfolk). 
There are a couple of relationships which we do not distinguish in 
English. Paternal uncle or aunt means your father's brother or sister, 
while. maternal refers to the same relationship on your mother's 
side. The distinction extends to a cousin, who is merely the son 
or daughter of a paternal or maternal uncle or aunt. There are no 
separate words for nephew or niece, who are son or daughter of 
brother or sister.

ab and akh usually become abu and akhu with possessive nouns and 
pronouns (see above). In the Gulf countries, it is common once you 
know people well to refer to a man as abu plus the name of his eldest 
child, and his wife as umm plus the same: 
abu SaaliH lit. father of Salih 
umm haashim mother of Hashim 
abu is also used of humans and inanimates to indicate some attribute: 
abu liHyah 
abuDHabi 
a man with a beard 
(lit. father of a beard) 
(Abu Dhabi) lit. father of gazelle (in 
which it presumably once abounded) 
umm is occasionally used in the same way. 
akhi (lit. my brother) is a term of address used between males of 
approximately equal status. 
The more formal al-akh (the brother) is used as a polite way of 
addressing a stranger. 
If an Arab is addressing an older person he does not know, he might 
say yaa :amm-i (lit. my uncle). 
Unit 7 The fllmlr 117 

The word ibn (son) is mostly used with the suffix pronouns, for 
example, ibn-i (my son).lthaa an alternative form bin used in proper 
names which; in the Gulf, often take the form of: first name + bin + 
father's first name+ al- tribal name (usually ending in -i): 
yuusif bin aHmad al-qaasimi Youssef bin Ahmed al-Qasimi. 
This means a man called Youssef, whose father's first name was 
Ahmed and who belongs to the tribe of the Qasimis. 
muHammad bin maHmuud al-kindi Mohammed bin Mahmoud 
al-Kindi (Muhammed son of Mahmoud of the Kindi family/tribe) .

2 bait al-waalid (father's house) 
Just as you add pronoun suffixes to nouns to express possession, 
you can also add another noun. In this type of construction 
(as here) the second noun usually has the al- (the) unless it is 
someone's name. The first noun never has it. If the first noun has 
the -ah ending, the 'hidden t' appears, as in wizaarat al-i:laam

Here kull-ha refers to the family (feminine).

n&iqaT naHwfyyah (Grammar points) ~ 
J..i.; 
, S•ylng you h•ve to, must do something 
This is done by using the word laazim [it is] necessary [that] . •• 
before the (present) verb: 
laazim ashtagbal yoom as-sabt I have to work on Saturday. 
laazim aruuH al-kuwait baakiri have togo to Kuwait tomorrow. 
laazim titkallam :arabi 
You must speak Arabic. 
2 S.ylng you like something 
In the previous unit you learnt to use the verb yiHibb to express a 
permanent like or dislike, as of tea or chocolate. 
If you are talking about something which just strikes you as good, 
or pleasing, use the verb ya:jib (to f1lease) and add the suffix ending 
according to who is being pleased. 
ya:jib-ai (it f1leases me) is identical to the French 'il me l'lait'. 
Remember that places are usually feminine, so the •erb prefix must 
be feminine: 
ta:jib-ak al-:ain? 
na:am ta:jib-ni katbiir 
haadhi S-SUurah maa 
ta:jib-ni 
Do you like Al-Ain? (lit. it [fem.] 
f1leases you Al-Ain?) 
Yes, I like it a lot. 
{lit. it f1leases me a lot) 
I don't like this f1icture. 
{lit. this picture does not please me) 
Arabic plurals are formed in one of three ways, depending on the word: 
(a) by changing the internal shape of the word 
(b) by adding -iin to the singular word 
(c) by adding -aat to the singular word. 
122 

(a) Many commonly-used nouns (and some adjectives) have 
'broken' plurals, foimed by changing, or 'brealcing up'- the 
internal structure of the word itself, like English mouse -+ mice, 
foot -+ feet. This type of plural, where it exists, is used for both 
human beings and things: 
walad -+ awhiad (boy) 
bait-+ buytiut (house) 
···················-····-·········································-.:···········~·························· 
Insight 
In general, it is 'shorter' nouns, i.e. those with fewer letters, 
which take broken plurals. Broken plurals can be formed from 
foreign borrowings if they meet the 'length' criterion. Compare 
the examples above with the two following types of plurals: 
film -+ afl&am (film) 
bank -+ bumiuk (bank) 
With a few exceptions, nouns have only one plural form. The two 
categories of plurals which follow do not have a brolcen plural. They 
are not alternatives. 
(b) Words which do not have a broken plural and which signify 
male human beings usually add the ending -iin to the noun. 
muhandis-+ muhandisiin (engineer) 
mudams -+ mudarrisiin (teacher- male) 
lcuwaiiti -+ lcuwaitiyyfin (Kuwaiti) 
Note that words which end in -i in the singular, add a 'helping' y 
or yy before this ending. 
A few common foreign words for males use the ending -iyya: 
draiiwil-+ draiwiliyya (driver) 
lcUuli-+ lcuuliyya (coolie, labourer) 
Unlt7 .... ......, 123 

(c) Words which do not have a broken plural and which signify 
female human beings or inanimates drop the ending -ah if 
present and add -aat: 
mudamsah-+ mudarrisaat (teacher- (em.) 
sayyaarah-+ sayyaaraat (car) 
baaS -+ baaSaat (bus) 
Note: A relatively few very common nouns denoting female 
members of the family take irregular or hybrid plurals: 
umm -+ ummahaat (mother) 
ukht -+ akhawaat (sister) 
hint -+ banaat (girl, daughter) 
sanah (year) has two plurals, sanawaat and siniin (the latter being 
the only common exception to the 'men only' rule for the -iin 
suffix). 
In the end, you jtlst have to learn the plurals along with the singulars. 
They are given iD brackets after the noun in the vocabulary, in full if 
they are broken, or with -iin or -8at. 
4 Plur•l •dJectlves 
Adjectives have plurals just like nouns, which must be used when 
you are talking about people. For things you use the feminine 
singular -ah. 
humma saakiniin wain? 
al-banaat al-kuwaitiyyaat 
sayyaaraat kathiirah 
Where are they livingl 
the Kuwaiti girls 
many cars 
A few common adjectives have broken plurals, and these will be 
given in the vocabulary in the same way as the plural of nouns. If no 
plural is given for an adjective, assume that it takes -iin.

Originally (believe it ot not!) the ancient Arabic language was 
written· with far fewer letters~ many of them havins several different 
pronunciations. To remedy the confusion which this defective 
alphabet caused, dots were added to some of the letters to distinguish 
between these varying pronunciations. The 'dot system• in Modem 
Arabic uses the following combinations: 
(a) ·one, two or three dots above the letter 
(b) one-or tWo (but not three) docs below the letter 
Of coJ;ll'Se some letters are not dotted at all. 
The dotting phenomenon enables us to divide the Arabic alphabet 
into groups or sets of letters for convenience of learning. 
The largest group contains the letters b, t, th, nand y. Three of these 
have been mentioned in earlier units, but now you have the full set. 
You know by now that, as with most of the Arabic letters, there is 
a 'nucleus• form, to which are added joining strokes or ligatures for 
the other forms. In addition, the final form used at the end of words 
&equendy undergoes some elongation or embellishment. 
Apart from the number and placement of dots, the letters in the 
following list are all identical except for variations in the final and 
separate forms of two of them. This series of letters is wricceD amall 
in height, and the 'nucleus• form is no more than a small hook placed 
on the line. They all join to both preceding and following letters.

A look at the above table will show that the letters are identical, 
except for the final and separate forms of 'n' and 'y'. Tb.e-fcmner 
extends below the line, and is an incomplete 'egg-on-end' shape, 
while the latter is a double curve, again below the line. Notice that 
the dots of the initial and medial forms of the above letters are 
centred above or below the upward pointing tooth of the letter. In 
the final and separate forms, the dots are centred above or below the 
flourish. There are no difficulties of pronunciation in this group, but 
remember that 'y' sometimes represents a long ii or ai as described in 
Unit 6. Now try to recognize the following words, which incorporate 
some of these new letters. Remember to supply the short vowels. 
Insight 
Write down the consonants with a hyphen between them, 
and see what they suggest. For example, the first word below, 
which uses three letters &om this group, is: IHl-t, i.e. hint. We 
have provided clues to help you. 
(usually after shay: this is really something else!) 
(the second letter is':'; not feeling too bright?) 
(pronounce the first letter as 'i': a pronoun) 
(a present from Arabia) 
(one syllable; middle vowel is 'ai' written with 
Arabic 'y': there's no place like it) 
(remember long vowels: delicious squeezed ... ) 
(written with a hyphen after the first letter in our 
transcription: no sugar thanks) 
(second letter is':' again: most useful word in Arabic) 
(cool, creamy and delicious)

The old Arab months, the -best-known in the West being 
ramaDHaan Ramadan, are based on the Islamic calendar which 
starts from 16th july 622 AD. Converting dates from this is not 
merely a matter of subtracting 622. Since the year consists of 
12lunar months it is about ten days shorter. For instance, 1st 
January 2000 =24th Ramadan 1420. 
There is a third set of month names which begins the year with 
the month kaanuun ath-thaam (Kanun the Second). Stick to 
the European months. 
4 To say on such and such a date use fii (in) or simply nothing at all: 
fii tis:ah yuunyo 
:asharah :asharah 
on the 9th of june 
on the 1Oth of October

The ordinary numbers are used for dates, not the ordinals 
(7th, 20th etc.) as in English .

takyfif (air-conditioning) in cars and buildings is an essential part of 
modern life in the Gulf. This is the formal word for it, but you will 
frequently hear the adapted English kandaishan. 
Although the Gul( is famed for the intense heat of its summers, in the 
northern Gulf in the winter months it can be bitterly cold. Even the 
Ulllta lnthehoMI 137 

smallest hotels will have air-conditioning units in the rooms, which 
are needed all year in the southern Gulf, but you might wish to 
confirm that there is heating if you are going to the north in winter.

nuqaT naHwryyah (Grammar points) ~ 
~ 
1 T•lklng •bout the future 
The future tense (English I shall) in Gulf Arabic is formed by the relevant 
part of the present tense prefixed with b-. Before consonants, this 
acquires a helping vowel, usually -i, and the vowels of the verbal prefixes 
t(i)-, y(i)- and n(a)-are omitted to smooth out pronunciation. (These are 
merely habits of speech, so do not worry about them unduly.) Here is 
the verb yisawwi. (to do, make) in full in both the present and the future: 
Present 
I do 
you (masc.) do 
you (fem.) do

basawwl

In most parts of the Gulf, verbs like yisawwi whose present stem 
ends in -i drop this before the suffixes -iin, and -uua. 
As in English, if the time sequence is obvious from the context, the 
simple present can be used: 
aish bitsawwi fi S-Saif? 
aruuH iqiltcrra

2 More verb strl~s 
In Unit 6 you learnt how to use two verbs together: 
uriid nashuuf 
aish tiriidiin tishribiin? 
We want to look {lit. we-want 
we-look). 
What do you want to drinkf 
In both the above cases the person doing the 'wanting' is the same 
person or people doing the 'looking' or 'drinking', and so the form 
of the verb is the same in both cases. 
If there are different people doing each action, the forms of the verbs 
have to agree accordingly: 
142 
yiT.mshuun Had yiSalliH-ub They will send someone to 
mend it {lit. they [will]-send 
someone he [will]-mend-it.)

2 to hope, intend to do something 
You will recall that the phrase in shaa' Al-laah is used wherever 
there is some doubt about what will happen. To say you hope to 
do something, put in shaa' Allaah (God willing) before the verb 
for what you intend to do in the present tense: 
in sbaa' Al-laah naruuH iskutlanda sbabar sab:ah 
We hope to go to Scotland in July (lit. 'month seven'). 
in shaa' Al-laah naruuH at-hind fi S-Saif 
We intend to go to India in the summer. 
J verbs, past tense 
See grammar points at .the end of the unit. The present tense has both 
prefixes and (sometimes) suffixes; the past tense has only suffixes. 
4 wa niHna Sughaar (when we were young). 
The Arabic idiom says literally and we young (at that time). The 
plural adjective Sughaar agrees with the (plural) human beings.

Insight 
Remember that when you are talking about things, the Arabic 
adjective takes the same form as the feminine singular, usually 
the ending -ah, e.g. hawaayaat lcatbiirah (many hobbies). 
When talking about people, use the plural form of the' 
adjective. This usually has the suffix -iin, but a number of 
common adjectives take special forms, e.g. Saghiir/Sughaar as 
here. If no plural form is given in the vocabularies, the -iin 
suffix should be used.

4 :allam + t(a):allam (teach and learn) 
This is a common type of verb pair in Arabic, equivalent to what 
is called the active and the passive in English. :allam (lit. to make 
know) and t(a):allam (to be made to know). 
ma:luumaat thaqaaflyyah (CUltural tips) ~lta ~t..._,Ja... 
The Arabs have many words for varieties of camel. jamal (plural 
jimaal) is the only one you really need, and the one from which the 
.English is derived. 
154 

Similarly there are many words for the desert, depending on whether 
it is sandy, rocky, salt-flat and so on. at-barr (the land, country) is 
the most useful general term. aS-SaHraa (whence we get Sahara) 
is the literary word, and rim8al (lit. sands) refers to that type of 
desert landscape. aMUba: al-khaali (the Empty Quarter) is a term 
not originally used by inhabitants of the area (who call it ar-rimaal), 
but everybody knows it now from literary sources.

1 kaan (was, were: verb) 
Although no verb is used in Arabic for is/are, there is a verb kaan 
(was, were). It has a present tense form yikuun, but this implies a 
future or potential event. (See Unit 10 and the verb tables at the 
end of the book for the formation of the tenses). 
kaan £i 1-bait 
kunt £ii ghurfat-i 
He was in the house. 
I was in my room. 
kaan has many other uses, the main one being to give everything 
which comes after it a past aspect:

In English you say 'he goes to work'; in Arabic there is no translation 
of the word to:

He goes to work 
(lit. he goes the work). 
We are going (to) England.

3 al-ja'WlV (the weather) 
When talking about good. bad. hot and cold weather you can use 
an adjective: 
158 
al-jaww zainlmuu zain 
al-jaww baarid 
al-iaww Haarr 
The weather is good/not good 
The weather is cold. 
The weather is hot. 
Alternatively you can use a noun: 
fiih bard 
fiih Barr 
It is cold (lit. there is cold). 
It is hot {lit. there is heat). 
This noun construction is the only one available for talking about 
any other weather condition: 
6ih shams 
6ih gbaim. 
fiihhawa 
fiihmaTar 
fiih thalj 
6ih :aaSifah 
darajat ii-Haraarah 
thalatbiin 
It is sunwy (lit. there is sun). 
It is doudy (lit. there are clouds). 
It is windy (lit. there is wind). 
It is raining (lit. there is rain). 
It is snowing (lit. there is ice. snow). 
It is stomry {lit. there is a storm). 
It is 300C {lit. degree the-heat 
[is] 30). 

4 To talk about the weather in the past, put kaan before the statement: 
5 
kaan al-jaww baarid 
kaan fiih maTar 
It was cold. 
It was raining, it rained

(a) What does the·name of the·bus mean in English? 
(b) Which word is missing from the English transliteration? 
I bi (by, by-means of) 
When you want to talk about a means of transport; you use the 
word bi (by, by means of). Note that where you say by car, p~ 
etc., in Arabic you always say by the.

ma:luumaat thaqaaflyyah (Cultural tips) ~~ o4,la.o 
As you might expect, Arabs accept hot weather as a fact of life, and 
only comment on it if the temperature rises above about 4o•c, or 
if it is excessively humid. They are however very interested in rain, 
which in most of the region generally comes in the winter. Naturally 
the success of the harvest depends on the arrival of rain, which is 
often sudden and can result in flash floods, but usually the sun

The Bedouin have many words for clouds, depending on whether they 
are rain-bearing or not. The Dhofar area of southern Oman catches 
the monsoons and has a regular annual rainfall pattern. It is covered 
with lush green vegetation for considerable periods of the year.

The Arable Verb: Past tense 
The past tense uses a past stem with suffixes only. These suffixes are 
more or less the same for all Arabic verbs, with only slight variations 
to smooth out pronunciation. There are only two verbs in Arabic 
Unit. .......end hollclllys 
161 

which could .be called irregular, and these are fully explained in the 
verb tables at the end of the book which you should look at regularly. 
All verbs in Arabic can be categorised into four types, depending on 
the nature of the stems. The following is a summary: 
TYPE A The simplest type, with one stem for each tense. 
The next three types have more than one stem in either or both of 
the tenses. Which stem is used depends on the part of the verb you 
are using (he, we, they, etc.) 
TYPE Bl has two past stems and one present stem. 
TYPE B2 also has two past and one present stem, but is of a different 
nature. 
TYPE C verbs have two stems for each of the past and present tenses. 
lmport•nt note 
Because Arabic does not have the handy infinitive form (to go, to 
read etc.) found in most European languages, we use its most basic 
part, the past tense he-form, which has neither prefixes nor suffixes. 
From this lesson onwards, verbs are given as follows: 
Past tense he-form followed by present tense he-form followed· by 
verb type, e.g. (A) given between brackets and then the meaning 
expressed as to ••• 
For example: 
raaH, yirauH (Bl) 
to go (lit. he went, he goes) 
Note: Only two parts are given for each verb. For types other than 
group (A) you must check in the verb tables. 
Below are two examples with the suffixes picked out in bold type. 
162 

TYPE A has only one past stem. An example is alchadh to take 
(actually, of course, he took): 
Singular 
Plural 
I 
akhadh - t 
we 
akhadh - na 
you (masc.) 
akhadh - t 
you (m. and f.) 
akhadh - tu 
you (fem.) 
akhadh - ti 
he/ (it) 
akhadh - (no suffix) 
they (m. and f.) 
akhadh - u 
she (it) 
akhadh - at 
TYPE Bl has two past stems. The main stem has been picked out in 
italics. An example is raaH to go (he went): 
Singular 
Plural 
I 
ruH - t 
we 
ruH - na 
you (masc.) 
ruH - t 
you (m. and f.) 
ruH - tu 
you (fem.) 
ruH - ti 
he/ (it) 
raaH - (no suffix) 
they (m. and f.) 
raaH - u 
she (it) 
raaH- at 
Insight 
Where verbs have more than one past stem the main one (i.e. 
that given first in the vocabularies and glossary) is used with 
the he, she and they form, or, put another way, when either 
there is no suffix or the suffix begins with a vowel. 
Note that as with preSent tense verbs, there is usually no need to put 
in the pronoun (I, you etc.), as it is already implied by the verb itself. 
However, in the following exercises it has ohen been supplied for 
the sake of clarity.

These are aU non-joiners, so there are really only two forms for each. 
At first the two pairs look similar. However the daal and the dhaal 
are written above the line, and have an upright stroke leaning 
towards the left. The raa' and the zaay start on the line and go 
below it, and have no upward stroke except the tiny .one where they 
meet the ligature. They have a much less pronounced hook than the 
first pair.

Also remember the r must be trilled as in Scots or Spanish. 
Since you know all the words below, this time here are some Arabic 
words and their translations for you to match up.

This is not a history book, but it is as well to know something about and 
show an interest in the Arab heritage. As mentioned in the ·dialogue, 
the Arab empire was very extensive, and their scholars and writers 
made many important contributions to science, medicine, engineering 
and other subjects. 
This generally receives scant attention in European education, which 
tends to jump from the Graeco-Roman era to the Renaissance. In 
the centuries preceding this Renaissance (i.e. 're-birth') of EUropetn 
culture, the torch of learning was carried by the Arabs, who were far 
ahead of the West in practically all fields of endeavour. 
Arab occupation of Southern Spain (roughly Andalucia which is the 
same word as the Arabic al-andalus), the last outpost of the Arab 
Empire in Europe, ended with the fall of Granada in 1492, the year 
in which Columbus discovered America.

mulaaHaDHaat (Notes) ~~ 
1 Written, especially classical, Arabic diffen from the spoken variety. 
Since all Islamic religious scriptures, especially the Holy Koran, 
Ulllt10 ,.........., ...... __ 17 5 

are couched in a high style of Classical Arabic, people tend to 
import words and phrases from this register of the language when 
discussing such subjects. 
Apart from words and phraseology, pronunciation is also affected, 
especially the letter q (see pronunciation notes, p. 15), especially in 
the Arabic word for the Koran, al-qur'aan. 
2 The verb anzal (to send down, reveal) (of the Koran) is not used 
in other contexts. 
3 Phrases such as Salla 1-laahu :alai-hi wa sallam (peace be upot~ 
him) and laa ilaaha ilia 1-laah (there is no other god but God) 
(see exercises below) also preserve some of the old Classical 
endings which have long since been dropped in everyday speech. 
Insight - hijri and miilaadi 
These are the terms used to distinguish between the Islamic 
and Christian dating systems, often abbreviated in writing to 
_.and f" written after the date. The Islamic dating system, now 
(except in Saudi Arabia) almost restricted to use in religious 
connections- although still given along with the Christian date 
on most Arabic newspapers- began on 16th June 622 AD, the 
date of the Prophet's hijrah (often spelled in English Hegirah 
fot some reason) from Mecca to Medinah.

1 Adjectives formed from nouns 
In English you have several ways of forming adjectives from nouns, for 
example adding -ic (e.g. historic, photographic), or -an (e.g. American, 

BelgUJn). Some of these- require a slight alteration to the base noun, 
e.g. the final -)1 in history has to be omitted, and the ~um from 
Belgium, 
~Arabic mainly uses .one ending -i, which becomes .,-iyyah- in the 
feminine, and usually -iyyiia in the plural when applied to human 
beings. However, changes to the base-word are also required in certain 
.cases. 
Probably the· largest class of such adjectives in Arabic are those 
referring to nationality, places of origin or tribaVfamily affiliations; 
such as: 
Country 
Mas c. 
Fern.

Note that: 
(a) If the plaa name from which the adjective is derived has the 
definite article at,., this is dropped when forming the adjective: 
al-yaman -+ yamani 
al-kuwait -+ kuwaiti 
al-urdun ·-+ urduni (Jordanian) 
(b) If it has the -ah feminine ending, this is also dropped, and there 
are certain anomalies with words ending in -a, which can omit 
this final vowel and add -i, or take the ending -aani, -aawi, or 
even use a completely different base. 
These are best learned as they come, but here are a few common 
examples. The plurals ar~ sometimes irregular:

(c) :arabi (Arab, Arabic) has the irregular plural :arab 
Insight 
These adjective formations are not restricted to countries of 
origin. Almost all penonal names in the Gulf end in such an 
attributive adjective formed from the name of a person's tribe 
or family, e.g. kbamiis bin Hamad al-baTiaashi (i.e. Khamis 
bin [son of] Hamad of the Battash tribe). 
You can improve your reading by trying to spot the Arabic 
letter fi- which is how this ending -i is spelled in Arabic - at 
the end of names on business cards or shop signs. It won't 
always be there, but there is a very good chance that it will. 
_,.,, .. 
: .,. . .,. 
he 
l.rt 

(d) This adjectival ending can be added to ordinary nouns, as for 
instance in dialogue 3 we have: 
islaami (Islamic) from islaam 
miilaadi from miilaad (AD, referring to the birth of Christ) 
The adjective used for the Islamic year hijri illustrates the dropl'inf$ 
of the feminine ending of the base noun hijrah. 
In this category fall also the 'non-primary' colours, which are adjectives 
formed from natural objects, usually fruits or flowers: 
ward ·(roses) __. wardi (pink) 
burtugaal (oranges) __. burtugaali (orange) 
banafsaj (violets)__. banafsaji (violet) 
There are more examples in the exercises at the end of the unit. 
As a final illustration, the Arabic name for the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia is: al-truimlakah al-:arabiyyah as-sa:uudiyyah (lit. the 
Kingdom the Arab the Saudi) where both Arab and Saud become 
adjectives to agree with Kingdom. 
2 The pest continuous/habitual 
You have already learned that there are only two main verb 
tenses in Arabic, the present and the past. The future is merely the 
present with the prefix b(a)-. These three will get you through most 
situations, but there are one or two more possibilities, the. main 
one being that' used to express continual or habitual action in the 
past. This shade of meaning is not always immediately apparent 
in English. For instance, when .. you say he was doing, he used to 
do, etc., the words show that you intend a continuous/habitual 
meaning. However, if you consider he worked in the oil company 
for three years, she lived most of her life in London, the bare 
past tense verb gains its continuous aspect from the context. In 
Arabic, however, the simple past tense has a sort of 'sudden death'· 
instantaneous action. This can be softened into a continuous or 
habitual happening simply by using the verb string: kaan (past 
tense) + main verb (present tense). The kaan here as usual puts 
the whole sentence in the past. Examples of this construction are 
given below. 
180 

kaan is a TYPE Bl verb. For convenience, here is its past tense in full:

3 Adverbs 
to cook 
delicious 
Adverbs are words which describe how, when or where the action 
of verb takes/took place, and in English you usually form them by 
adding the ending -ly, as in quickly, formerly. 
Arabic has two ways of forming adverbs: 
(a) Using the suffix -an, as in Tab(a):an (lit. naturally) jiddan 
(very) aHyaanan (at times). In this unit you have mathalan (for 
example) from mathal (an example). 
(b) Using a preposition + noun construction, as the English with 
ease= easily. The Arabic preposition used is usually bi-. In this 
unit we have had bi-DH-DHabT (with exactness, exaaly) and 
another common one is bi-sur:ah (with speed, quickly).

In this unit we shall look at another 'pair' of consonants, 1 and sh, the 
latter having three dots above it. The pronunciation is the English s as 
in bits (not as in bins), and sh as in shin. 
Both these letters are joiners, so there ~ 
four forms of eac:h: 
Name 
Initial 
snn 
shlln 
.. 
....., 
s 
sh 
The meaningful part of these letten ls the three little spikes, looking 
like a rounded English w, with the~ 
and final flourishes. 
They are written on the line (except for the final flourishes), and are 
dassed as small letters. 
186 
Insight 
In fact, these letters have such a low profile that, in many 
styles of handwriting and calligraphy (for instance, on shop 
signs), the three little spikes are ifoned out, and the letters are 
reduced to a long line, whiCh the eye has to pick up as a letter 

from the context. For example, the proper name Hassan-which 
has, of course, only one s in Arabic is written: 
but will often look more like this: 
with only the length of the stroke between the -c:. and the W 
telling us that there is an s in there. 
As with the only other letter which has three dots above it (0) these 
are often written on the shiin in the form of an upside-down v or a 
French circumflex accent II. (see alphabet section). 
Below are some words you already know which include these letters. 
Try to transcribe them according to the system used in this book.

192 
, ta:baao (lit. tired) 
This word is commonly used as a aJPbemism for ill, wbea the 
complaint is not severe. The real wor4 fDr ill is mariiDH. 
::a waja:, yOoja: (to give pain) 
Remember that a type A verb whose past begins with a w 
smooths this out in the present which becomes yooja:. 
3 tiruuH :ind Tabiib al-asnaan 
The :iDd here implies at the house/place of (French chez). In 
everyday English you talk about 'the dentist's', 'the doctor's' 
meaning the same thing. 

4 yikuun 
Here are two examples of yikuun putting the rest of the 
sentence into the future: yi.kuun aHsan (it will be better, you'd 
better), yikuun laazim (it will be necessary, you will have to). 
See Unit 8. 
s (al-)mafruuDH (used with or without the article) literally means 
some thing that is required of you, imposed upon you. 
Insight 
In Gulf Arabic mafruuDH is a stronger form of laazim. If one 
person says laazim, someone who agrees with him will often 
reply aywa mafruuDH. 
6 gabil maa (before) 
For this maa before verbs, see grammar points. It is not the 
negative maa. 
7 yigla: la-k sinn-ak 
The preposition li or Ia means to or for, and is often used in 
Gulf Arabic after a verb, as here, to imply a sense of immediate 
personal involvement. English will pull your tooth out for you 
gives much the same flavour. See also grammar points. 
8 laa tit:abiin nafs-ich (masc.laa tit:ab nafs-ak) 
This means either literally don't trouble yourself or, jocularly, 
don't get into a state. It is another example of the negative 
imperative . 
• idha 
Very often followed by kaan, :idha is probably the most common 
word for if in Gulf Arabic. You have also come across law in the 
phrase law samaHt (please, if you_ permit). 
,o aakhudh maw:id (I'll make an appointment) 
English says make, Arabic says take. 
....., ........ 193 

n ana ta:baan (fern. ta:baanah) shwayyah (I don't feel very well) 
This is the easiest way to say you are unwell, although there is a 
word in Arabic for feeling, Haasis (fern. HUssah): 
ana Haasis nafs-i ta:baan 
lit. I am feeling myself ill. 
12 aish fii-k or aish bii-k (fem. fii..cblbii-cb) (What is wrong with you?) 
There are three ways to say what is wrong with you: 
(a) :ind-i waja: fii ••• -i (I have a pain in my • • • ) 
(b) You can use the verb yooja: (to hurt, give pain): 
••• -i yooja:-ni (my ••• hurts (is hurting) me). 
(c) With some common ailments- especially toothache- use the 
posessive c~nstruction: 
ind-i waja: al-asnaan 
I have pain [of] the teeth. 
........................................................................................................ 
. 
. 
Insight 
There is a special word for a headache, Sudaa:, the verb from. 
which is often used figuratively when referring to problems or 
difficulties:

1 ad-doktoor (doctor, borrowed from English) 
The 'official' word for doctor is Tabiib, from the Arabic root Tibb 
(the science of) medicine. Hakiim (lit. wise man) and daldatar 
(a corruption of doctor) are also heard. doktoor only can also 
be used as a title, when it always takes the definite article~ ad-
dolrtoot :aziiz as-saalimi (Dr Aziz ai-Salimi). A dentist is referred 
to simply as doktoor although the formal word is Tabiib al-
asnaan (doctor [of the] teeth).

This irregular verb is given in full in the verb tables. Its imperative 
ta:aal (fem. ta:aali, plural ta:aalu) (come!) derives from a 
completely different root. 
J (fiih) iHtimaal (lit. there is a possibility) 
Whereas mumkin, or its verbal equivalent yimkin, can be used

it is conceivable that, can only be used for the latter, i.e. something 
that might happen.

These, you remember, are special parts of the verb used for giving 
orders, or telling people to do something. In this unit you have 
met a negative imperative, telling someone not to do something. In 
this case, use the negative laa (not), which is also the word for no, 
followed by a simple present tense verb. 
laa tit:abiin nafs-ich 
laa atkallam bi-sur:a:h kidha 
laa tiruuHuun yoom as-sabt 
Don't trouble yourself (to a UIOmlln). 
Don't speak quickly like that 
(to a man). 
Don't go on Saturday (plural). 
When these words are used before a verb, they must be followed by 
the word maa. This is meaningless in English, and has nothing to do 
with the negative maa (not). 
Examples: 
Before a noun: ba:cl al.pada 
after [the] lunch 
but, before a verb: phil maa tinaam 
before you [go to] sleep 
3 khallll-nl ashuuf let me '" (llt.IHtfe-mel-snJ 
This verb string or phrase has an imperative(+ pronoun suffix) foUowed 
by the main verb in the present tense. Remember that all WOI'ds ending 
in a vowel lengthen and stress this when a prefix is added.

Insight 
In many parts of the Gulf, verbs of the khalli type lose their 
final vowel in the ~masculine) imperative, in which case this 
phrase would be· khaii-Di. You need only be aware of this for 
listening purposes, as you will be understood whichever variety 
you use. 
4 The preposition 11-/la- (to, for) 
This little word is frequently used with pronoun suffixes and sometimes 
changes or omits its vowel: 
1-i 
to/for me (the vowel is pronounced long: I-ii; 
1-alc 
sometimes also li-yya)

Insight 
In writing the second pair, Taa' and DHaa', the bottom 'egg 
shape' is produced first, and the upright 'stick' added later at 
the next lift of the pen in the same way as we dot our i's and 
cross our t's. 
These four letters are often called the 'emphatic' letters, as they have 
a powerful sound produced by greater tongue tension and more 
violent release of breath. 
Note: In the Gulf, D and DH are both pronounced the same, (i.e. 
like an emphatic db). (See alphabet section.) 
The following exercise is of the crossword clue type (not vecy subtle). 
Remember, there are no short vowels or double letters, and t. at the 
end of a word is always the (feminine) ending -ah. Also, the al- in 
many Arabic p.l$ce names is frequendy omitted in English. 
Write down the .consonants you recognize, check them for potential 
long vowels and you should get the right answer.

mulaaHaDHaat (Notes) ~~~ 
1 Money 
The general term is filuus (the plural of fils, the smallest .division 
of many Arab currencies), or baizaat which dates back to the 
days of the rupee in the Gulf and is still used as a thousandth part 
of a riyal in Oman (sing. baizah). 
The two best known foreign currencies in the Gulf are the US dollar, 
and the jinaih (-aat) starllini (the pound sterling). 
2 Changing money 
The verb Sara£, yiSraf can be used for either to cash or to change. 
It is usually assumed that you want to change into the local 
currency, so this need not be specified. If you want some other 
currency, simply add ariid (I want) plus the. currency a.ame, or 
better :umlah plus the nationality adjective of the currmcy. 
ariid riyaalaat 
Iwant',.q..ls. 
ariid :umlah sa:uudiyyah 
I want Saudi cu"ency. 
ma:luumaat thaqaaflyyah (Cultural tips) ~~ 
ol.o_,.la.. 
There are plenty of banks in the Gulf,.but their opening hours are rather 
brief, generally about 8 am until noon (11 am on Thursdays and. closed 
all day Friday). A clerk will effect your transaction on paper, but if you 
are withdrawing money, you will have to collect this from the cashier. 
210 

Exchange rates are not sacred, so unless you have an established 
relationship with a certain bank and are sure you are getting the best 
deal (ask!) it is often worth shopping around, especially if you intend 
to exchange a significant amount. 
An alternative to the banks are the money-changers (Sattaafiin, same as 
cashiers) who have offices in the soulcs of most large Gulf towns. These 
are perfectly legal operations, and you can sometimes get a better rate. 
They also have the advantage of being open for much longer hours, 
including evenings.

its real Arabic plural formation).

2 wain-ha daa'irat al-muruur (where is the traffic department?) 
The suffix pronouns are sometimes added to wain (where) giving 
the sentence more emphasis. The wain can come either before or 
aher the noun:

wain-ha s-sayyaarah maal-ak 
Where•s Mohammad? 
Where is your car?

wiz8arah (ministry) is derived from waziir (minister) (the Vizier of the 
Arabian Nights). Ministries are usually expressed by the possessive 
construction, with the hidden -t appearing. 
Here are a few: 
wizaarat at-ta:liim 
wizaarat aS-SiHHah 
wizaarat ad-daakhillyyah 
wizaarat al-khaarijiyyah 
wizaarat ath-thaq8afah 
(Ministry of Education) 
(Ministry of Health) 
(Ministry of the Interior) 
(Ministry of Foreign Affairs) 
(Ministry of Culture) 
sifaarah embassy is derived in exactly the same way from safiir 
ambassador (itself in turn derived from safar travel). 
214 

Embassies are usually referred to by the adjectives of nationality: 
as-sifaarah 1-bwaitiyyah 
as-sifaarah 1-amriikiyyah 
as-sifaarah 1-briiTaaaiyyah 
as-sifaal'ah al-bindiyyah 
(Kut~~aiti Embasgy) 
(American Embassy) 
(British Embassy) 
(Indian Embassy) 
Note however that their official titles are often in the possessive 
construction: e.g. 
sifaarat mamlakat al-baHrain Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain 
Ministries and embassies are run by armies of muwiDHDHaf ( -iin) 
(officials) (lit. one appointed to an official position). They tend 
to open from about 8 am until 2 pm and close on Thundays and 
Fridays. 
Whatever you go for, you will inevitably be asked for several passport 
photographs, so keep a good supply with you as automatic machines 
are not plentiful in the Gulf.

' Each, every •nd.all 
These are all expressed by the single word kull (also pronounced.kill), 
which never changes. 
For each and every use it before an indefinite singular noun: 
216 
kull yoom 
kull sanah 
every day 
every year 

kull bank fii-h makiinat Sarf 
kull waaHid laazim yiSraf 
miyyat doolaar 
every bank has a cash machine. 
each one must change $100. 
····························································································-········· 
Insight 
kull sanah (or :aam, another word for year) w iata bi-khair is the 
Arabic felicitation for any annual event (birthdays, Eids, etc.), 
usually Happy .•. (birthday, Christmas etc.) in English. The 
literal meaning is every year and (may) you (be) weU. 
There are two ways to use kull for all: 
(a) Follow it by a plural noun with either the definite article or a 
suffix pronoun: 
kull al-bunuuk maftuuHah yoom al-ithnain 
All the banks are open on Monday(s). 
kull-hum kaanu mashghuuliin ams 
They wne all busy yeswdtry. 
(b)· Put the plural noun first, and then follow it with kull +the agreeing 
suffix pronoun referring back to the noun: 
al-bunuuk kull-ha maftuuHah The banks are aU open (lit. the 
banks all [of} them [are} open). 
al-ghuraf kull-ha maHjuuzah The rooms are all booked (lit. the 
rooms aU [of} them [are] booked). 
maHJ&luz 
booked, reserved 
I 
.......................................................................•.............................. 
Insight 
Remember that the plurals of non-humans are considered 
feminine singular in Arabic, hence the -ha (hn) suffix used in 
the above examples to refer to banks and rooms respectively. 
For humans you use -hum (them): 
al-muwaDHDHafiin kull-hum mawjuudiin The officials are 
all hne.

OflcW ,..._._ 217 

2 If 
The three words for if (idha, in and lawlloo) are used virtually 
interchangeably in colloquial Gulf Arabic. The last suggests a lesser 
(or even zero) chance of the condition being fulfilled, but is also used 
in the common polite phrase law sainaHt (please, .if you please, if you 
would permit). 
A strange thing about if sentences in Arabic is that the verb is often, 
though not always, put in the past tense (even though the action hasn't 
happened yet, or might never happen). 
All three words are often followed by kaan with no particular change 
in meaning. Here are a few. examples: 
idha jaa rashiid khabbirii-h :an bamaamij bukrah If Rashid 
comes, tell him about tomo"ow's programme. 
in kaan :ind-ak chaikaat siyaaHiyyah laazim tiSraf-ha If you 
have travellers' cheques; you'll have to cash them. 
law kaaa sawwa kidha, kaan aHsan If he had done this, it would 
have been better. 
loo kunt :araft baadha, maa ruHt If I had known this, I wouldn't 
have gone. 
idha tiruuH ash-shaarjah, laazim tizuur al-matHaf al-jadiid If 
you go to Shatjah, you should visit the new museum.

tamrllnaat (Exerclas) ol.l,_,..:t 
' You want to post some mail home. How would you ask the cost

(a) a letter to the USA? 
(b) a postcard to Australia? 
(c) a parcel to the Emirates? 
(d) a letter to Saudi Arabia?

This is a good opportunity to look at one of the. most coiiUilqn {Qml$ 
for first names in Arabic. 1he names of God (Allah) are said to 
220 

number 99, and an age-old naming formula is to precede one of these 
divine epithets with the word :abd (Arabic ~); worshipper (of). 
The popular English abbreviation 'Abdul' does not exist in Arabic. 
The name Abdallah or Abdullah meaning worshipper of Allah has 
an irregular spelling, with the alif of the long a-vowel in Arabic 
being missed out: dl ~ 
(:abd al-laah). 
The same thing occurs in another common name :abd ar-raHmaan 
(~.)I ~)Abdul-Rahman which features the same omission of 
the ali£ to mark the long -aa. 
Match up the following pairs. The Arabic names all begin with 
J I ~. and the divine attributes of Allah are given in transcription, 
along with their approximate meanings.

z sharikat al-:aaSimah (Capital Company, lit. Company [of the} 
Capital) 
The names of trading companies in the Gulf are often composed of 
phrases like this (possessives) followed by li (for), then the name of 
their commercial activity: 
sbarikat aHmad ash-
sh•nfari Ji bai: as-saa:aat 
J inn (that) 
Ahmed al-Shanfari Watch Company 
(lit. company [of] Ahmsd 
al-Shanfari for [the} sale [of] 
watches). 
The use of inn is very common after verbs such as pal (to say), 
khabbar (to teU, inform) and ift8kar (to think, consider, be afthe 
opinion that). This differs from the verb in the text yifakkir, which 
means to think in the sense of to devote thought to. 
iftakart inn-ha waSalat ama 
I thought she arrived yesterday. 
khallii-ai afakkir 
Let me think. 
4 balad 
The meaning of this word has to be interpreted &om the context. 
It can mean town, village or country. Its plural bilaad can mean 
towns, villages or (singular) country, nation state and this again 
has a further plural form buldaan which can only mean cot~ntria, 
nations, states. 
s al-aHsan yikuun (the best thing would be to) 
This is the present tense of kaan in its usual meaning -will be. 
would be. 
e dabal (4-wheel drive). 
This apparendy comes &om double, although the term is not 
used in this context in English. Gulf Arabic has many words 
(mainly technical) borrowed &om English (and other languages) 
like kandaishin (air conditioning), also ai sii (A C) and the proper 
Arabic word takyiif, and faiinri (refinery).

ma:luumaat thaqaaftyyah (Cultural tips) ~~ ot.._,Ja.. 
In some Gulf countries bus services are very sporadic, mainly 
transporting foreign workers to and from the cities, but in others there 
is a well-established bus network with a frequent service. 
Taxis are either service, or standard. Service means that the taxi runs 
along a (roughly) prescribed route and will pick up people if there are 
spare seats and charge a (roughly) standard fare. If you want the taxi 
solely for yourself or your party, you must specify this ),y saying ariid 
ingaij - another quaint borrowing presumably from English engage. 
This is, of course, more expensive and you should agree the fare with 
the driver before getting into the car:

1 l111per•tlve verbs: how to form them 
The imperative form of the ved> is used when you want to tell 
someone to do something, and ft.is easy to form in Arabic. Verbs in 
this book are given in the he-form, with the past tense followed by 
the present: raaH, yirauH (to go). (The verb type given in brackets 
after the verb doesn't matter in this connection.) 
Fint isolate the pre1e11t stem of the verb by removina the yi- prefix 
from the present tense: yiruuH gives ruaH. 
.... ......... , 233 

If the word resulting from this process does not begin with two 
consonants, you have the masculine singular imperative form, as 
here: ruuH (go/). 
However, if it does begin with' two- consonants, you have to add a 
helping vowel prefix, usually i- as in: intaDHar, yintaDHir (to wait). 
Removing the yi- gives ntaDHir, which begins with two consonanh 
(n and t), so you have to supply an initial i-: intaDHir (wait!). 
Insight 
The term 'beginning with two consonants' must be interpreted 
as two Arabic consonants. Combinations of English letters used 
to represent one Arabic consonant must be regarded as one and 
not twa. The combination letters used in this book are: th, kh, 
db, sh, DH, p and occasionally cb. 
For example the verb khabbar, yikhabbir yields khabbir. This 
begins with one Arabic consonant, and therefore is the correct 
imperative form and does not require any helping initial vowel . 
....................................................................................................... 
. 
. 
A few common verbs vary slightly from these rules in forming the 
imperative. These are: 
(a) verbs whose past tense begins with w. 
The: present tense of these begins with ~ 
and the imperative is 
formed by dropping the y-. The two most common verbs of this 
type are: 
waSal, yooSal (to arrive); imperative ooSal 
wagaf, yoogaf (to stop); imperative oogaf 
(b) two common verbs which have· a shortened imperative: 
akal, yaakul (to eat); imperative kul (the yaa- is dropped) 
akhadh, yaakhudh (to take); imperative khudh 
(c) the verb jaa, yiiji (to come) which has an imperative totally 
unrelated to the verbal form: ta:aal. 
234 

2 Gender 
The form obtained by the above method is the masculine singular 
imperative, i.e. used when you are telling one male to do something. 
If you are talking to a woman, add-ito the masculine form (if it 
doesn't have one already, in which case one absorbs the other): 
ruuH to a man 
ruuHi to a woman 
(go/) 
intaDHir 
intaDHiri 
(wait!) 
khudh 
khudhi 
(take!) 
khalli from khalla, yikhalli (to leave) is the same for both because it 
already has a final -i. 
For the plural, men or women, add a final-u, again omitting any final 
vowel present: ruuHu, intaDHiru,kbudhu, kballu (from sing. kbaUi, 
final -i dropped). 
Insight 
The above are the base forms and will always be understood, 
but you will hear slighdy different versions in different areas 
of the region. The golden rule is to imitate the native speakers 
around you. 
The above forms are not used when you are telling someone not to do 
something. In this case use laa +the ordinary present form ef the verb.

Although traditional Arab houses are still to be seen in villages, 
homes in the Gulf cities are mainly in apartment blocks either built 
on new ground or on the sites of traditional buildings which have 
sadly been demolished. 
The apartments in these buildings are basically western style, 
with furniture in the taste of the area, and plenty of mirrors and 
ornaments. More affluent families live in detached houses or villaa.

Whereas we, in the UK or the States, buy most of our clothes and 
furnishings ready made, people in the Middle East are accustomed 
to having things made for them, often at extremely low prices, by an 
army of craftsmen. 
Tailors will measure you and make you a suit in a couple of days, 
dressmakers can make a dress overnight, and curtains similarly can 
be made up in a day or two. 
There is a huge choice of materials &om all over the world, and 
because the cost of making-up is so low, while imported clothes 
and furnishings are relatively expensive, many people are happy 
to have some garments made for them. However, ·the quality of 
workmanship varies tremendously, and the best tailors are found by 
personal recommendation ..

Which, wh11t, whose, etc. 
We are not referring to the question words here, but the which 
featuring in sentences such as. 'The book which I ordered came in 
the post today'. These words are called relative pronouns. 
To express such sentences in Arabic, you must distinguish between 
definite and indefinite concepts. A definite concept in English is one 
either preceded by the, this, that, etc., (the book) or the name of a 
person or place Uack, Muhammad, Abu Dhabi). 
(a) If the concept is definite, the word for which, that, who etc. is iUi 
(b) If it is indefinite, no word at all is used. 
Insight 
illi does not change for gender, etc., and there are no different 
words for whom, whose or which. 
In both cases, the part of the sentence after English which, etc. must 
be able to stand on its own, like a complete utterance. 
Definite concept

kQf is quite a tall letter. It is best to write the main part of the lettet 
first, then come back to do the 'tail' at the top, or the little squiggle 
'inside at the first lift of the pen, like dotting i's and crossing t's in 
English. Note also that, while the first two forms lean to the left, the 
final and separate forms are vertical 
The baa' is more difficult. as the forms seem to bear little or no 
relation to each other. It is quite small- and you have already met 
its final form in Unit 2 in the guise of the 'hidden t' of the Jeminine 
endini' where it acquires two dots above it. You have also. ·met its 
initial form in the currency word ,-.A..>-* dirham and its.plural t-AI..JJ 
diraahim. Have another look at some bank notes! 
254 

There is one final character, the so-called b•mub. Not technically 
regarded as a letter of he alphabet, it is counted among the 'signs' 
used for the short vowels and so on. However, unlike them, it is 
usually represented in· written Arabic. Its sound is a glottal stop 
(like the tin the Cockney version of such words as bottle). The 
rules for writing it are complex and it is a common spelling mistake 
in Arabic. However, so that you can recognise it, the general rules 
for writing it are given in the alphabet section at the beginning of 
the book.

Give me a return ticket for tomorrow please. 
We have an idea to rent a car to go outside 
Dubai in order to see a bit of the country. Do 
you know a good firm that we can rent from? 
Let me think. A lot of people from here have gone 
to the Capital Company, but some of them 
have said that their prices are a bit high. Why 
don't you go to the Gulf Car Company in 
AI-Wahdah Street? It's a well-known company, 
and their prices are reasonable. 
Good, thanks. I'll go and ask them. 
Good morning. 
Good morning, we want to rent a car. Which of 
your cars are suitable for the desert? 
How many people are you? 
Four (persons). 
The best would be a car with 4-wheel drive. I have 
a Toyota Land Cruiser, an excellent clean car 
that'll go anywhere. 
Does it have air-conditioning? 
Of course. All our cars have air-conditioning 
And how much is the rental per day? 
350 dirhams. How long do you want it for? 
We want it from Thursday morning until Saturday 
morning if possible. 
~ car hire man 
All right, I'll give you a special price. 6oo dirhams 
for the whole period. 
~ Charlie 
Is that with insurance? 
i car hire man 
Yes, and 300 km free. 
! Charlie 
Fine. Can you deliver the car to us at the hotel or 
do we have to come and get it from here?

apartment we rent now. 
Where is it? 
The building is next to our building. 
The apartment is on the fourth floor, and there 
are two more apartments on the same floor 
How many rooms are there in it? 
There's a sitting room, and dining room, and three 
bedrooms, and a kitchen and two bathrooms 
and a large hall. 
And how much is the rent per month? 
The rent is 3,000 dirhams, that is soo more than 
we pay now. And if we take it, we have to pay 
two months' rent in advance. 
So what are you going to do? 
We'll think a little. We don't have to tell the 
landlord now. 
Is the apartment furnished? 
No, we'll have to bring our (own) furniture. And 
we'll possibly have to buy new chairs for the 
sitting room. It's a big, spacious sitting room, 
and the chairs we have now are small. 
What kind of electrical appliances are there? 
There's a washing machine, a fridge and a new 
cooker. The landlord got a new one because 
the previous tenants broke it. 
There's central air-conditioning, and a fan in the 
sitting room for the winter. 
And where will you put your car?

Grammar summary 
This grammar summary is intended to be used as a quick referencet 
and does not cover all the language given in the course. 
1 Definite •nd Indefinite 
In Arabic all nouns and adjectives are either definite or indefinite. 
Definite 
(a) A definite noun is specific, and can be 
• A proper noun, e.g. Cairo, Mohammed. 
• A pronoun such as I, you, they. 
• Preceded by the word al- the, called the definite article. 
al- never changes for gender or number, and is always attached to 
the following noun or adjective, e.g. al-bait the house. 
(b) al- is always the same in written Arabic. In pronunciation, if the 
preceding word ends in a vowel or -ah, the a of al- is omitted, 
e.g. al-qahwah 1-ladbiidhah the delicious coffee. 
(c) If the word begins with one of the following Arabic letters: 
In 
DH 
T 
D 
5 
sh 
1 z r dh 
d 
th tl 
the I of the al- is omitted in pronunciation, and the following letter 
is clearly doubled. 
Pronounced after a consonant 
ar-n\jul 
ash-shams 
an-nuur 
Pronounced after a vowel 
r-r6Jul the man 
lh-sham1thesun 
n-nuur the light 
.__,~ 299 

Indefinite 
There is no indefinite article, or word for a, in Arabic. bait in 
Arabic means a house. 
a Nouns 
Masculine and feminine 
In Arabic, nouns are either masculine or feminine in gender. Nouns 
ending in -ah are usually feminine, but 
• A few feminine nouns do not have this ending, e.g. umm mother. 
• A handful of masculine nouns end in -ah, e.g. khaliifah Caliph. 
Singular and plural 
The plural of Arabic words should be learned at the same time as 
the singular. The plural in Arabic refers to more than two (2+). For 
two of anything, see the section on the dual below. 
(a)' The external masculine plural, used in words for male human 
beings, is formed by adding -iin to the singular noun, e.g. 
mudarris > mudarrisiin (m.) teachers. 
(b) The external feminine/neutet plural, used for the plural of 
most females and some other nouns, is formed by dropping the 
-ah (if there is one) and adding -aat to the singular word, e.g. 
mudamsah > mudarrisaat (f.) teachers. 
(c) The internal plural, used mainly for males and for things, is 
fonned by altering the internal vowels of the word and/or 
by adding prefixes or suffixes. Although there is no general 
relationship between the singular word-shape and the plural 
word-shape, short words are more likely to take an internal 
plural, e.g. g8lam > a&IUm pens. 
(d) All plurals of things are regarded in Arabic as feminine singular 
for the purposes of agreement of adjectives and verbs. 
Dual 
The dual must be used when talking about two of anything, and 
is mostly regular for both nouns and adjectives. It is fonned by 
300 

adding an external suffix, similar to the masculine external plural, 
to the majority of nouns and adjectives. 
[ Example 
Suffix 
bait a house + -6ln ., INIIt61n 
two houses 
(a) If a word has the feminine -ah ending, this changes to -at and 
the suffix -am is added to it, e.g. sayy8arah a car becomes 
sayyaaratain two cars. 
(b) Adjectives must take the appropriate masculine or feminine 
dual ending and also agree with the noun, e.g. sayyaaratain 
kabiiratain two big cars. It is not usually necessary to insert the 
word for two.

Agreement of adjectives 
(a) Adjectives must agree in number, gender and definiteness with 
the nouns they describe, e.g.: 
al-film al-mumtaaz the excellent film 
jaiami:ah jayyidah a good university 
(b) In most cases, the feminine of an adjective is formed by adding 
-ah to the masculine, e.g. Tawiil, Tawiilah tall, long. 
(c) If there is more than one adjective, it is added after the first 
one, agreeing with it and the noun, e.g. 
al-fUndug al-kabiir al-jadiid the big new hotel 
hint jamiilah Saghiirah a beautiful young girl 
Adjectives of natlonaHty 
Adjectives indicating nationality are fo{llled by adding -ii/-iyyah to 
the name of the country, e.g. miSr Egypt, miSrii/miSriyyah Egyptian. 
Where the name of a country ends in -aa or -ah, this is omitted 
before the ending is added: 
briiT l.anya Britain. 
briiT8aniilbrii.Taaniyyah British 
............ _ ... ., 301 

If the Arabic place name has the word al- the in front of it, this is 
omitted from the nationality adjective. 
al-tirdun Jordan tirdunii/urduniyyah Jordanian 
Singular and plural adjectives 
The plurals of Arabic adjectives follow the same rules as nouns, 
adding the -iin (m.) or the -aat (f.) ending, or by means of internal 
plurals, which are given in the voca·bulary with their singulars. 
All plurals of things are regarded in Arabic as feminine singular, e.g. 
aT-Ttirug aT-Tawiilah the long roads 
Noun 
Male human beings 
Female human beings 
Things/abstracts 
Adjective 
either internal plural if it has one or+ -On. 
+-Mt 
+ -ah (f. sing.) 
The primary colours are an exception (see Unit 5). 
Word order 
The adjective comes after the noun. In sentences with verbs, the 
verb usually (but not always) comes first. 
4 Pronouns 
Subject or personal pronouns 
Subject pronouns are always definite. 
Singular 
6na/ 
fntll you (m.) 
fntl you (f.) 
hiMw•he 
h.,. she 
Plural 
nlllall we 
fntu you (both genders) 
hllmm. they (both genders) 
The English it is translated into Arabic as he or she, depending on 
the gender of the word to which it refers. 
302 

Possessive pronoun suffixes 
There is no equivalent in Arabic to English mine, yours etc. The 
words my, your, his etc. are expressed in Arabic as suffixes joined 
on to the object which is possessed, e.g. bait-bum their house, 
akb-ii my brother 
Singular 
Plural 
-1 
my 
..... 
our 
-ak 
your(m.) 
-kum 
your (both genders) 
-lch 
your(f.) 
-uh 
his 
-hum 
their (both genders) 
..... 
her 
Object pronoun suffixes 
Arabic uses the same pronoun suffixes as the possessive pronoun 
suffixes, with the exception of me, which is -ni after verbs. 
The suffixes are added to the verb to express the ob;ect of the 
sentence, e.g.: 
kall8mt-ub ams 
kbabbar-ni nwir 
s Saying to have 
I spoke to him yesterday 
Nasser told me 
There is no verb to have in Arabic. Instead, this is expressed by 
using one of the prepositions li- to/for, or :ind(a) with (French chez) 
with a noun or pronoun, e.g. li-1-walad piam the boy has a pen. 
The object of the English verb then becomes the subject of the Arabic 
sentence, e.g. he has a car :ind..ub 1ayy8arah (lit. with him (is) a car). 
&Verbs 
Is/ore sentences 
There is no Arabic equivalent to the English is/are. Instead, a 
definite concept is simply followed by an indefinite one, e.g. al-bait 
kabiir the house is big. 
······-· 303 

Past tense 
All Arabic verbs are derived from a root, usually a three-letter one, e.g. 
k-t-b which has the meaning of writing. MOst verbs are formed from 
either a past or a present stem, with a standard set of prefixes and/or 
suffixes. The same prefixes and suffixes apply to every Arabic verb. 
The Arabic past tense is used when the action of the verb is complete. 
To form the past tense, suffixes are added to the he form of the 
past stem, e.g. katab as follows: 
Singular 
Plural 
ka~A-t 
/wrote 
katjb-na 
we wrote 
katjb-t 
you (m.) wrote 
katjb-tu 
you (m. + f.) wrote 
katjb-tl 
you (f.) wrote 
kMab 
he wrote 
kMab-u 
they (m. + f.) wrote 
kMab-at 
she wrote 
• If the subject is not stated as a noun, it is usually unnecessary to 
use a subject pronoun, since the suffix expresses the subject, e.g. 
katabat she wrote. 
• If the subject is a noun: 
(a) The normal (but not exclusive) word order in Arabic is 
V-S-0: 
I ,verb 
2Subject 
3 Object/the rest 
(b) Verbs which come at the beginning of the sentence in Arabic 
can only have the he or she form, i.e. always singular, never 
plural, e.g. zaar al-w6zara at:.buy6ut.al-jadiidah the ministers 
visited the new houses 
304 
Verb 
heformfor ... 
Subject 
, One male being ' 
2 two or more male beings 
· J One object (grammatically m.) 
I 

she form for •.. 
'One female being 
a Two or more female beings 
J One object (grammatically f.) 
4 Two or more of any object 
(c) If the sentence has two verbs, the word order is Vl-S-0-Vl: 
I , 
1st Verb 
a Subject 
J Object (If any) 
42ndVerb 
The 1st verb is in the he/she form, and the 2nd verb follows the 
subject and agrees fully with it, e.g. raaH 1-awlaad ilaa s-siinamaa 
wa-shaafuu 1-film the boys went to the cinema and watched the film. 
A verb which for any reason comes after its subject must agree 
fully in number and gender. 
Saying was and were 
Although there is no verb in Arabic for is/are, the verb ban is 
necessary for was/were. 
The suffix endings are the same past tense ones used on all Ar-abic 
verbs. 
Singular 
Plural 
kun-t 
I was 
IIWn-M 
we were 
kun-t 
you (m.) were 
IIW...-
you (m. + fJ were 
IIWn-tl 
you (f.) were 
lcUn 
he was 
lk.Un-u 
they (ril. +f.) were 
k6•1H1t 
she was 
kaan usually comes first in the sentence, e~g. kaan waalid-ii 
mudarris my father was a teacher. 
Present tense 
The Arabic present tense is used if the action of the verb is 
incomplete. To form the present tense, prefixes- and suffixes 
for some parts - are added to the present tense stem, e.g. ktib, as 
follows: 
ar.m............., 305 

Singular 
Plural 
6-ktlb 
lwrl~ 
n6-ktlb 
.wwrlte 
tf-ktlb 
you (m.) write 
tl-ktlb-6un 
you (m. + f.) Write 
tl-ktlb-On 
you (f.) write 
Jf-lltlb 
he writes, Is writing 
yHdlb-6un 
they (m. + f.) write 
tf-ktlb 
she writes 
A full explanation of how to find. the present stem of the verb is 
given in the section on Arabic verbs. 
Future tense 
Spoken Arabic expresses what you will do in the future by placing 
the prefix b- before the present tense verb. Before a consonant, a 
helping vowel, usually -i, is added, and the vowels of the present 
tense prefixes t(i)-, y(i)- and n(a)- are omitted to smooth out 
pronunciation. 
Present 
Future 
........ 
I do 
.,. .... 
I sho/Vw/U do 
tl-s6wwl 
you(m.)do 
bltAwwl 
you will do 
tl-sllww-On 
you(f.)do 
bltAwwft-n 
youwllldo 
yi-Ywwl

you(pl.)do 
bltuwwtlun 
you will do 
yl-sllwwtlun 
they do 
blysMwwWn 
theywllldo 
(or byiAwwdun) 
Some dialects use the prefix Ha-. This works in the same way. 
The past continuous/habitual 
The past continuous is formed with kaan and the present tense 
verb. It is used to say what used to happen or what was habitual, 
e.g. kunna naniuH s-suuq kuU yoom. W t used to go to the mar'ket 
every day. 

Arabic verbs 
Arabic verbs have a basically simple underlying structure. There 
are no anomalies as in the English go, went, or gone. Arabic verbs 
all take the same prefixes and suffixes to form their tenses, of 
which there are only two, present and past (equivalent to English 
I go, I am going etc. and I went, have gone, etc.). 
In the vocabulary boxes in this book, verbs are given in the 
'he-form' of the present tense, followed by that of the past tense. 
There are two reasons for this. Firsdy Arabic does not have what 
is called an infinitive form of the verb in (English to go, to eat 
etc). Secondly, the 'he-form' of the past is the simplest part of the 
Arabic verb, having neither prefixes or suffixes. So when you say 
to write = katab, yiktib the Arabic words actually mean he wrote/ 
has written, he writes/is writing (The verb type is given after this in 
brackets: see below.) 
Verb terms 
To help describe verbs there are three main terms: prefixes, suffixes 
and stems. The first two should be self-explanatQry, being bits 
added to the beginning and end of words respectively. The stem 
of a verb is its main 'core' which comes between the prefixes and 
suffixes. A rough analogy in English is to say that like is the verb 
stem, occurring also with the suffixes -d (liked), and -s (likes). 
English verbs change very litde for the purposes of agreement - in 
fact in the vast majority of verbs you only add an -s or -es for the 
he/she/it form of the present tense (e.g. Ilyoulwelthey want, but 
he/she/it wants). Arabic, like French and German, has different 
verb parts for each person, and these also sometimes differ for 
gender. 
Mille.... 307 

Because of this, as you will have seen in the units, it is not usually 
necessary to use the personal pronoun with a verb, i.e. instead of 
we went, the we-form of the verb is usually sufficient. 
Past tense 
Begin with this because it is structurally simpler than the present 
tense: it only has suffixes attached to a stem. (Some verbs have two 
stems as described below, but ignore this for now.) 
Here is an example, using katab (wrote), past stem katab. The past 
tense suffixes for all Arabic verbs are in bold and separated by a 
space for clarity. Note how the accent (marked) shihs.

~tab 
they (m. and f.) wrote 
~tab 
u 
she/(it) wrote 
~tab 
at 
Notes 
, I and you masc. singular are identical. 
2 The he-form has no suffix in most verb types and consists merely 
of the stem. The original suffix for this form was -a, and it is useful 
to remember this as it occurs in some types of verbs (see below). 
J It is very useful in dealing with certain types of verbs which have 
more than one stem to note now which suffixes begin with a 
consonant (I, we and you), and which with a vowel (she, they 
and also including the dropped -a of the he form). 
4 The they-ending -u is pronounced in some dialects as -oo or _-aw, 
but you will always be safe if you say -u. 
5 Some conservative dialects preserve the £em. plural you and they, 
using the suffixes -tan and -an respectively. You may hear this, but 
308 

for practical purposes it can be ignored. The distinction mascJfem. 
in you singular (-t/-ti) is~ however, compulsory in all dialects. 
Present tense 
This consists of a stem (usually different from that of the past 
tense) with a prefix (all parts) and a suffix (some parts). The 
present stem is the he-form stripped of its prefix (usually yi-). 
Here again are the forms from katab write, present stem ktib:

yf ktlb 
they (masc.lfem.) write yl ktib· lhln 
shel(lt) writes 
tf ktlb 
Notes 
, You masc. and she are identical. 
2 Speakers of Gulf Arabic often alter or even omit the vowel 
of the prefixes yi- and ti- to what they apparendy think goes 
better with the stem, so you hear yu-, tu-, ya-, ta- or y-, t-. This 
makes no practical difference; so stick to yi- and ti- till your ear 
becomes attuned. (a- and na- do not change so readily.) 
3 Some dialects habitually omit the final n of the endings -iin and 
-uun. Again stick to the forms given till you begin to absorb 
local speech characteristics. 
4 As in the past tense above, it is very useful to notice the nature 
of the suffixes - in this case whether there is one or not. This 
helps when dealing with verbs which have more than one stem. 
s As with the past tense, some 'old fashioned' dialects preserve 
the feminine plural forms. These also end in -an: ti-ktib-an (you 
fem.) and yi-ktib-an (they fem.).

Verb types 
Arabic verbs can be classified in four types (some with slight 
variants), except for a couple which can be called irregular. These. 
type classifications depend on how many stems the verb has 
(varying between two and four•). Here is a brief explanation of 
how the various types work, so that you can fit newly acquired 
verbs into their correct category. 
•Some verbs use only one stem for both past and present, but these 
have been regarded as having two 'identical' stems. 
Type A 
These have two stems, one past and one present. In most cases the 
prefixes and/or suffixes are merely added to the stem. The example 
katab (write) has been given above. Here are a few more. The 
stems are set in bold the first time they occur, and a few sample 
parts given: 
Past 
Present 
Blab 
Tal~b-t, nlab-u etc

lntaD~r-t 
yl-nUDHir 
walt, walt for 
lshUglull 
lshtagh~l-t 
yt-sht6ghll 
work 
These verbs present no difficulties as you only need to add the 
prefixes or suffixes to the relevant stem. 
Type A has two minor variants which occur with a few common 
verbs. In the present tense of akal (eat) and akhadh (take) the 
vowel of the present prefixes is always elided before the stems 
aakul and aakhudh, hence 8akul (I eat), y-aakul (he eats), 
n-aakhudh (we take), y-aakhudh-uun (they take). 
310 

The other variant is with verbs whose past stem begins with w, tWo 
common examples being waSal (arrive), and wagaf (stop, stand). 
Here the w of the present stems (wSal and wgaf) combines with the 
prefix vowel to give an oo sound: y-OoSal (he arrives), and y-Oogaf 
(he stops). BOth of the above variants are simply to assist easy 
pronunciation. 
Type B 
These verbs have two distinct past stems and one present stem. 
The first past stem is used for he, she and they (see remarks about 
suffixes in the introduction above) and the second for all other 
parts. There are two subdivisions of this type: those which change 
the internal vowel (Bl) and those whose second stem adds -ai (B2). 
Examples: 
Bl I .. ~ 
raaH/ruH 
Present 
ruuH 
Meaning 
go 
raaH (he uient), raaH-at (she went), raaH-u (they went), but ruH-t 
(1/you masc. went), rUH-ti (you fem. went), niH-na (we went), etc. 
Present tense is always ruuH: yi-riauH (he goes), na-niuH (we go 
etc.) Four other types ofvowelling occur with this class, e.g.: 
Past stems 
Prese'llt stem 
jub/jlb 
Jllb 
bring 
num/nlm 
num 
sl~ 
arud/aracl 
rlld 
want, wish

Note: Although some of the vowel changes seem slight, you must 
preserve the .distinctions between long and short.

H8bb (he liked), IUbb-at (she liked), H8bb-u (they liked), but Habbti-t

etc.; pcesent yi-Hibb (he likes), ti-Hibb (you mascJshe likes), etc. 
lm~~rr/lllllrnl 
pass by 
] 
Note again the two vowelling possibilities in the present are, i or u. 
TypeC 
These have two stems each for both past and present. 
Past tease: stem 1 for he, she and they (as 81 above) and stem 2 for 
all other parts. 
In addition, the he-form takes a final-a (this is the restoration of 
the original suffix for this part, now dropped in all other types of 
verb). 
Present tense: stem 1 for parts without a suffix, stem 2 for all other 
parts. (The second present stem is always the same as the first with 
the final vowel dropped.) 
Present 
....., .... 
do, make 
sawwa (he did), saww-at (she did), but sawwai-ti (you fem. did), 
sawwai-tu (you plur. did).: in the present yi.:Sawwi (he does), 
ti-sawwi (you mascJshe does), but yi-sawwaun (they do) etc. 
Some examples: 
mash/mashai 
gar/garai 
naslnasii 
ishtar/shtarai 
ibtadlibtadai 
mshilmsh 
gralgr 
nsa/ns 
shtara/shtar 
btadilbtad 
go. walk 
read 
forget 
buy 
begin 
Important note: For the sake of the sense, the he-form in the past 
tense has been given in the vocabularies with the added -a. This 
should be omitted in order to determine the stem. 
312 

Irregular verbs 
There are only two verbs in Gulf Arabic which can be said to be 
irregular. These are ja or aja (to eome) and-bagba (to want, wish 
for).

This verb has an irregular imperative from an entirely different 
root: 
ta:aal, ta:aal-i, ta:aal-u 
bagha behaves like a normal Type C in the past, but does all sorts 
of strange things in the present, depending on where you are in the 
region. It can be summarised as a Type C of two different possible 
kinds: 
Past: 
bagh/baghai 
Present: 
bghalbgh (e;g. yi'bgha, yibghuun) 
b(b)ilb(b) (e.g. yt'b(b)i, yib(b)uun) 
To avoid difficulties you can always use the synonym araiad, yiriid; 
as has been done in this book.

Glossary of language terms 
Although this book is written in as plain language as possible, 
some linguistic or grammatical terms have been used. It is 
worthwhile becoming used to these as they are often a quick way 
to express a complex idea. Here is a list of the main ones used, 
with particular reference to their use in relation to Arabic. 
Accent 
Adjectives 
Adverb 
Agreement 
Article 
Cardinal 
Comparative 
314 
See stress. 
Adjectives describe a person or thing, e.g. A huge 
building, I am tired. In Arabic these have the same 
properties as the noun (q.v.) and must agree with 
it in number, gender and definiteness. So: if a 
noun is feminine, its adjective must be feminine; 
if a noun is definite, its adjective must be definite, 
if a noun is plural its adjective must be plural. 
Words which describe how (or sometimes when 
or where) the action of a verb occurs or has 
occurred. In English they usually end in -ly (He 
ran quickly up the stairs.). In Arabic they either 
end in -an or are phrases such as with speed, i.e. 
quickly. 
This grammatical term for describing changes in 
one word caused by another mainly applies to 
nouns+ adjectives (q. v.), and verbs which must 
agree with their subjects (feminine subject requires 
feminine verb etc.). 
This refers to a or an (the indefinite article), and 
the (the definite article). Arabic does not have 
an indefinite article. To say a book you just say 
book, but it does have a definite article al- which 
is attached or prefixed to the following word. 
See number. 
An adjective which compares two things. In 
English these end in -er or are preceded by the 

Conjunctions

him). See also superlatives. 
Words whiCh join.parts of sentences, such a~ and, 
or, but etc. 
The non-vowel letters: b, d, g, db, DH etc. in this 
book. 
See pronoun. 
A special form in Arabic to refer to two of 
anything; as opposed to one (singular) and more 
than two (plural). 
Where part of a word, usually a vowel, is omitted 
to smooth speech. 
Masculine Qr feminine. See noun and adjective. 
The feminine ending of a noun -ab, which in 
certain contexts changes to -at. 
The form of a verb used when telling someone to 
do something. 
Question words. See also pronoun. 
These are words used to negate or deny 
something: no, not etc. Arabic uses different 
words ,vith nouns/adjectives and verbs. 
A noun is the name of a person, thing, place or 
abstract concept, e.g. Hassan, boy, book, Dubai, 
economics. In Arabic a noun has three important 
properties: 
1. It is either masculine or feminine. (There is no 
'neuter', or it, which you use in English to describe 
inanimate objects or abstracts etc.) This is called 
gender (q.v.). 
2. It is either singular (one only), dual (two only) 
or plural (more than two). English does not have a 
dual. This is called number. 
3. It is either definite or indefinite. This is simply 
logical: the word refers either to an unspecified 
persOil, thing etc. or to a specific one. In English, 
indefinites are often preceded by a or an (the 
indefinite article), but this is omitted inArabic. 
Definites often have the, this, that etc., or his,

her. Names of people, places (words with capital 
letters in English) are automatically definite, 
e.g. Ahmed, Bahrain and so on. The concept 
of definiteness is very important in Arabic as 
it affects other words in the sentence. (Note: 
pronouns (q. v.) are always definite.) 
See noun and adjective. 
The numbers or numerals divide into two sets, 
cardinal (one, two, three, etc.) and ordinal (first, 
second, third). 
The object of a verb is the thing or person which 
the action of the verb affects. It contrasts with the 
subject (q.v.), e.g. the dog (subject) chased the cat 
(object). 
See number. 
A phrase is a part of a sentence, not necessarily 
making sense on its own, but a useful term in 
describing features of a language. 
Pitch describes whether a word or part of a word is 
higher on the musical scale than another. It is mainly 
important in .questions which, in Gulf Arabic, are 
often identical to statements except that the pitch 
rises towards the end of the phrase or sentence. 
In Arabic more than two. See noun and adjective. 
When something owns or possesses something else. 
In English you either adds to the noun (Charlie's 
aunt), or use a possessive pronoun: my father, or 
the word of, e.g. the manager of the company. 
A short part of a word added to the beginning 
of a noun or verb. In English for example you 
have un-, dis- or pre-. In Arabic prefixes alter the 
meaning of a verb. 
These are (usually) short words relating a noun to 
its place in space or time, e.g. English in, on etc. In 
Arabic a few common prepositions are prefixed to 
the word which follows them. 
Short words used as substitutes for nouns (q.v.). 
The most important is the personal pronoun. 
For example the English pronoun he has

Superlative 
three distinct forms, he, him and his (in other 
pronouns such as you some of these forms have 
fused together). It will come naturally to you to 
say he isn't at home (not him or his), and also I 
saw him and it is his house. The first of these (he) 
is called a subject pronoun· and these pronouns 
have equivalent words in Arabic. The other two 
(him, known as an object pronoun, and his, 
known as a possessive pronoun) share the same 
form in Arabic, and are not separate words, but 
endings or suffixes attached to their nouns. The 
personal pronouns are the most important, but 
there are other kinds such as demonstratives 
(this, that etc.), relatives (who, which, that 
in phrases like the one that I like best) and 
interrogatives who, what and which when used 
in questions like who goes there? 
See pronoun. 
A sentence is a complete utterance making sense on 
its own, e.g. he is in his room. In English these must 
contain a verb (q.v.), but sentences with is and are 
do not have a verb in Arabic. For instance, the 
sentence above would be in Arabic: he in his room. 
See verb. 
Also called accent. This is the part or syllable of 
a word which is most emphasised, e.g. the first 
o in English photograph. In the first few units 
of this book, stress has been marked with the 
acute accent: -a, u, etc., and it is also given in the 
vocabularies and glossaries. 
The subject of a sentence is the person or thing 
which is carrying out the action. It can be a noun, 
pronoun or a phrase as in: Bill lives in Abu Dh•bi, 
he works for the oil company, the best picture will 
win the prize. 
An ending attached to a word which alters its 
meaning. 
Applied to adjectives when they express the 
highest level of a quality. In English they end

A 'doing' word expressing an action (he reads the 
newspaper every day). Its most important feature$ 
are: 
1. Tense. This tells us when the action is/was 
performed. In Arabic there are only two tenses, 
present (I go, am going) and past (I went, I have 
gone). The future (I shall go) is the same as the 
present with a special prefix. 
2. Infleaions. This means that the prefix and/or 
suffix of the verb changes according to who is doing 
the action. In English, most verbs in, for instance, 
the present tense, undergo only one change: I go, 
you go, they go etc., but he/she/it goes. In Arabic 
there is a different verb part for each person, 
singular and plural. The part of the verb which 
remains constant in the middle of all the prefixes 
and suffixes is called the 'stem'. This is an important 
concept in learning Arabic, and may be compared 
to the go- part of goes in the example above. 
Note: a) that the verb is/are is omitted in Arabic, 
and b) the English verb to have is not a real verb 
in Arabic, but a combination of a preposition and 
a pronoun (q.v.). 
The sounds equivalent to a, e, i, o, u or 
combinations of them in English. Gulf Arabic 
has a, i, u and their long equivalents aa, ii, 
uu, and also ai occasionally o and oo. Sec also 
consonant. 
In Arabic adjectives usually follow their nouns, 
e.g. good man becomes man good. Possessive 
pronouns are also suffixed to their nouns: my 
book becomes book-my. 

Arabic-English glossary 
Note: Nouns are given in the singular followed by plural in 
brackets, with al- included only in place names and other words 
where it is always present. The feminine and plural of adjectives is 
given only if they are irregular (i.e. not -ah, -iin). Verbs are given 
in the he-form of the past tense followed by the he-from of the 
present tense and the verb group shown in brackets. The order of 
entries does not take account of the symbols : and ', or distinguish 
between capital and small letters.
