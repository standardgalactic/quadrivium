Aristotle (384 BC–c. 322 BC)
Printed batteries are an excellent alternative to conventional batteries for an 
increasing number of applications such as radio frequency sensing, interactive 
packaging, medical devices, sensors, and related consumer products. These 
batteries result from the combination of conventional battery technologies and 
printing technologies. Printed batteries are increasingly being explored for 
highly innovative energy storage systems, offering the possibility for better 
integration into devices and novel application areas.
In this context, the main motivation of the present book is to offer the first 
comprehensive account on this interesting and growing research field provid-
ing the main definitions, the present state of the art, the main research issues 
and challenges, and the main application areas. In this scope, this book sum-
marizes the frontline research in this fascinating field of study, presented by 
selected authors with truly innovative and preponderant work.
The book provides an introduction to printed batteries and the current state 
of the art on the different types and materials, as well as the printing tech-
niques for these batteries. Further, the main applications that are being devel-
oped for those printed batteries are addressed as well as the principal advantages 
and remaining challenges in this research field.
The first chapter provides a general overview of the area of printed batteries. 
It deals with definitions and the main printed batteries types such as lithium‐
ion, Zn/MnO2 and related systems. The advantages and disadvantages of

1.1  ­Introduction
Increasing technological development leads to the question of how to efficiently 
store energy for devices in the fields of mobile applications and transport that 
need power supply [1, 2]. Energy storage is thus not only essential but also one 
of the main challenges that it is necessary to solve in this century [2, 3].
Further, energy storage systems are also increasingly needed, among others, 
to suitably manage the energy generated by environmentally friendly energy 
sources, such as photovoltaic, wind and geothermal [4, 5].
Batteries are the most‐used energy storage systems for powering portable 
electronic devices due to the larger amounts of energy stored in comparison 
to related systems [2, 6]. Among them, the most widely used battery type is 
lithium‐ion batteries, with a market share of 75% [7].
Anode, cathode and separator/electrolyte are the basic components of a 
­battery, the cathode (positive electrode) being responsible for the cell capacity 
and cycle life. The anode (negative electrode) should show a low potential in 
order to provide a high cell voltage with the cathode [8–10].
The separator/electrolyte is placed between the electrodes as a medium for 
the transfer of lithium ions and also to control the number of lithium ions and 
their mobility [11].
Advances in the area of batteries in relation to printed technologies is 
expected to have a large impact in the growing area of small portable and wear-
able electronic devices for applications such as smart cards, RFID tags, remote

sensors and medical devices, among others. This in fact originated in the 
development and proliferation of smart and functional materials and microe-
lectromechanical systems (MEMS) needing on‐board power supply to provide 
capacities of 5 to 10 mAh.cm−2 with overall dimension of < 10 mm3 [12–14].
The technological advances of the past years and the need for low‐cost and 
simple processing leads to the potential replacement, in some areas, of conven-
tional processing technologies by printed technologies, as evidenced in appli-
cations such as sensors, light‐emitting devices, transistors (TFT), photodiodes, 
flat panel display solar cells and batteries, among others. Printed technology 
characteristics such as low cost, large area, high volume, light weight, and 
the  processing of multilayered functional structures on rugged and flexible 
substrates, pave the way for new production paradigms for specific application 
areas [15–17].
In fact, it is expected that the global market for printed electronics will reach 
$45 billion in 2017 and is estimated to exceed $300 billion over the next 
20 years [15, 16, 18].
This fact is also evidenced by the many articles published in scientific journal 
about inks and printed electronics, as shown in Figure 1.1.
Printed materials for electronics can be applied on different substrates such 
as paper, plastics and textiles, giving origin to the term “flexible electronics”. 
Typically, the most frequently used printing techniques for printed electronics 
are ink‐jet and screen‐printing [19], but related cost‐efficient and high‐
throughput production techniques such as solution‐processing techniques

including spin, spray, dip, blade and slot‐die have been used, as well as gravure, 
flexographic and offset printing technologies [20, 21].
The different printing techniques require the use of specific inks with accu-
rate control of viscosity and surface tension, among other things [22, 23]. 
Further, for specific printing techniques, the ink properties should be adjusted 
taking into account the specific pattern to be printed [24].
Printed electronics requires the use of different types of inks such as dielec-
tric, semi‐conductive or conductive, which are used to print the different active 
layers of the devices. Further, inks with piezoelectric [25], piezoresistive [26], 
and photosensitive [27] properties, among others, have been developed for the 
fabrication of sensor devices. Typically, inks can be defined as colloidal solu-
tions as the result of a dispersion of organic and/or inorganic particles with 
specific size into a polymer solution [28]. Moreover, these inks must be cheap, 
reliable, safe to human health, and processable at temperatures below 50 °C. 
Further, the inks should preferentially show mechanical robustness, flexibility 
and recyclability [29].
Independent of the printing process, the ink should be distributed on the 
substrate with a specific pattern in a reproducible way, which strongly depends 
on its rheological properties [30].
The rheological properties (flow behavior, flow time and tack) of the ink can 
be evaluated by using the rotational viscosimeter to measure the viscosity as a 
function of shear rate, as the material is subjected to multiple shear rates dur-
ing material processing.
In particular, it is important to prevent the agglomeration or sedimentation 
of the particles through attractive/repulsive forces, which depends on pro-
cessing shear rate, as this will strongly affect the final properties of the 
printed layer [31].
At low shear rate, the viscosity of the inks is higher due to the attraction 
between particles, which induces their flocculation and immobility. At higher 
shear rates, the viscosity of the inks decreases through the low flocculation and 
higher mobility of solvent entrapped between particles [32, 33]. However, the 
viscosity of printing inks is not only a function of the shear stress but also of 
time, which plays an important role in the flow process of the ink for each 
printed element [30].
Further, the physical and chemical stability of the inks is affected by the dif-
ferent fabrication steps (stirring, dispersion, etc.), in which the energy input 
and mixing time influence both particle stability and degree of dispersion [34].
The combination of printing and battery technologies gives rise to 
printed  batteries; for this at least one of the components should be 
­processed and deposited through printing techniques in order to keep that 
designation [12, 35].
Figure 1.2 shows the origin of the denomination and the main applications of 
printed batteries.

Further, flexible/stretchable batteries [36, 37] and solid‐state microbatteries 
[38] can be included within the printed battery area when one or more compo-
nents are produced by printing technologies. In addition, there are usually 
non‐printed components such as the current collector, which also serves as 
support for the printed structure.
Inks for printed batteries are typically composed of a polymer binder, a sol-
vent and suitable fillers, depending on the layer type: electrodes and separator/
electrolyte [35]. Suitable fillers are in the form of micro/nanoparticles, nano-
plates, nanowires, carbonaceous matter or ionic liquid, among others [29]. The 
proper transfer of the ink from the printing plate to the substrate is the main 
function of a printing process [30].
In the field of printed batteries, ink rheology is one of the key issues, due to 
the high active material loading that may be necessary for proper battery per-
formance. This ink rheology depends mainly on particle size, solid loading 
concentration and solvent type [39, 40], with adequate ink showing moderate 
viscosity and weak sedimentation behavior resulting in an homogeneous parti-
cle system within a polymer network [31].

Printed Batteries: An Overview
5
The main printed battery component is the electrode (anode and cathode) 
[22], and different inks have been reported in the literature based on different 
active materials such as lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) [41] and lithium iron 
phosphate (LiFePO4) [40] for the cathode, and graphite [42], mesocarbon 
microbeads (MCMBs) [43] and tin oxide (SnO2) for the anode [44]. The active 
material content of the electrode affects its thickness, which in turn influences 
battery capacity: increasing electrode thickness leads to mass transport limita-
tions of lithium ions in the electrolyte phase leading to a reduction in the 
capacity of the cell [45, 46]. Also the porosity of the electrodes has a strong 
impact on battery performance as it influences the effective electronic and 
ionic conductivity values [47].
On the other hand, the separator/electrolyte has not been printed very often 
due to the necessary low ionic conductivity, which leads to the use of compos-
ite gel electrolytes to achieve ionic conductivity values closer to those of con-
ventional electrolytes [35]. The separator/electrolyte component of printed 
batteries is mainly based on composite gel electrolytes where the separator 
layer is soaked in an organic liquid electrolyte (salt dissolved into an organic 
solvent or ionic liquid to produce an ion‐conducting solution in an inert porous 
polymeric membrane) in which it is important to control the swelling process 
[35, 48, 49].
Thus, one of the largest challenges is the development of inks for printing 
solid‐state separator/electrolytes with a minimum ionic conductivity of 
10−4 S/cm and mechanical and thermal stabilities [50].
The efforts and challenges involved in developing and optimizing specific 
inks for the different battery components that meet the requirements of effi-
ciency, stability and processability for different printed techniques (Figure 1.3) 
are the main focus of the present fundamental and applied research efforts in 
this field.

The key features and attributes of printed batteries are that they are: 
­customizable, thin, high power, low cost, mechanically flexible, lightweight 
and rechargeable and that they allow large printed areas. These features will 
allow the fabrication of functional systems with batteries already integrated in 
devices [51].
These features and attributes are shown in Figure  1.4 and are the main 
advantages in comparison to conventional batteries.
The production costs and processing steps for printed batteries can be 
reduced through the use of roll‐to‐roll production methods, as they enable the 
fabrication and assembly of the different layers of the batteries at high speed in 
a continuous process [52].
Some of the main differentiating factors of printed batteries in comparison 
to conventional batteries are their simple integration into devices, the possibil-
ity of production for large areas and the possibility of thickness reduction. 
Further, eco‐friendly processes and materials are also possible [53].
Currently, research efforts are focused on improving performance (­specifically 
energy and power) and on developing new fabrication processes, inks, designs 
and characteristics for applications such as smart cards, radio‐­frequency‐
identification (RFID) security and information devices, thin‐film medical 
products, and new applications including e‐labels, e‐packaging, e‐posters and 
medical disposables [54].
A common factor for many of the aforementioned products is the require-
ment of on‐board battery power supply at the microwatt‐level with specific 
designs, which can be achieved with printed batteries.

Printed Batteries: An Overview

The performance parameters (i.e., power and energy value, lifetime and dis-
charge rate) of printed batteries are established according to the application, 
the delivered capacity being between 0.7 and 90 mAh for commercial printed 
batteries [35, 55, 56].
Thus, printed batteries are being applied in an increasing number of applica-
tions and the advances in printable ink formulations and printing technologies, 
such as 3D‐printing, will allow the fabrication of fully printed batteries with 
high areal energy density to widen the range of possible application areas.
1.2  ­Types of Printed Batteries
Electrochemical power sources, defined as batteries, were invented by 
Alessandro Volta, professor at the University of Pavia, Italy, in 1800, and are 
nowadays an essential component of the electronic devices market as well as of 
hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) [57]. The “voltaic 
pile” consists of an alternating sequence of two different metal discs (zinc, Zn, 
and silver, Ag) separated by a cloth soaked in a sodium chloride solution [57]. 
Over the years, different battery types, including Zn, nickel‐cadmium and 
nickel‐metal hydride, were developed, with lithium‐ion batteries now the most 
advantageous type.
The first Li‐ion batteries were commercialized by Sony in 1991 based on the 
pioneering work of Yazami regarding the use of lithium‐graphite as a negative 
electrode [58].
Some of the main advantages of lithium‐ion batteries include being light, 
cheap, environmentally friendlier and safer as well as showing higher energy 
density, less self‐discharge, no memory effect, prolonged service‐life and 
higher number of charge/discharge cycles [9, 57].
Batteries are usually defined as primary and secondary, the latter being 
rechargeable batteries [59, 60]. Independently of the battery type, their main 
constituents are the two electrodes, anode and cathode, and the separator/
electrolyte, as shown in Figure 1.5.
The two main processes of rechargeable batteries are charging and discharg-
ing, as illustrated in Figure 1.5. During the charging process, the movement of 
ions is from the cathode to the anode electrode and during the discharge, the 
movement is in the opposite direction, i.e., from the anode to the cathode [60].
In Figure 1.5, graphite represents the anode material and lithium‐manganese 
oxide, LiMn2O4, represents the cathode material.
With respect to printed batteries, the most frequently used ones are based on 
lithium, Li, and zinc, Zn.
Lithium printed batteries are lithium‐ion with different electrodes (graphite or 
LixCn for anode and LiCoO2, LiMnO2, or LiFePO4 for cathode, lithium‐manganese 
dioxide, Li‐MnO2 and post Li, i.e., lithium‐air, sulphur‐cathode, etc.)[53].

Printed Batteries

In relation to zinc batteries, the most frequently used are zinc‐manganese 
dioxide, Zn‐MnO2 (Zn for anode and MnO2 for cathode), zinc‐air and zinc‐­silver 
oxide, Zn‐Ag2O [53]. Further, there are other electrochemical systems, such as 
nickel/metal hydride, which have been also applied in printed ­batteries [61].
As an example, for anodes based on graphite and cathodes based on LiCoO2, 
the rechargeable electrochemical reaction of a lithium‐ion printed battery sys-
tem is:
	
Li1–xCoO2+ LixC6
LiCoO2+ C6

Typically, zinc battery types are non‐rechargeable systems except for nickel‐
metal hydride. For the Zn‐MnO2 system, which is the most often used in 
printed batteries, the electrochemical reaction is:
	
Zn
MnO
H O
ZnO
MnO OH

For many small device applications in which no high voltage is required, Zn‐
MnO2 batteries can be the most appropriate due to their high energy content, 
lower internal resistance, large shelf‐life and the low cost of Zn and MnO2 in 
comparison with lithium battery materials [62].

In relation to the other printed battery types, those that stand out in the 
­literature after Zn‐Mn2O and lithium batteries are Zn‐Ag2O batteries with 1.3 
to 5.4 mAh.cm−2 at 1.5 V [63, 64].
1.3  ­Design of Printed Batteries
For conventional batteries, there are basically four main designs, which are 
coin cell, prismatic, spiral wound and cylindrical [65]. All of them have in com-
mon the fact of being rigid and bulky, and not adequate for flexible electronics 
devices.
One advantage of the use of printing technologies in the fabrication of bat-
teries is that it is possible to develop one or more layers with a specific pattern, 
i.e., design [66]. This is particularly relevant as together with the characteristics 
of the materials used for the fabrication of a battery, the geometry/architecture 
of the battery strongly affects its performance [67]. For printed batteries, the 
main types are the stack or sandwich architecture (Figure 1.6) and the coplanar 
or parallel architecture (Figure 1.7).
Figure  1.6 shows the stack or sandwich architecture, which consists of a 
­current collector for the anode, anode, separator with electrolyte, cathode, and 
current collector for the cathode, all deposited in a flexible substrate with an 
overall thickness of 0.5 mm for the printed battery.
This architecture is identical to that of conventional batteries; it leads to 
low internal resistance due to the small distance that the lithium ions travel 
by moving between the anode and cathode, which also allows shorter charging 
times.

Figure 1.7 shows the coplanar or parallel architecture for printed batteries, 
which consists of the anode and the cathode in a side‐by‐side position. This 
architecture is the most frequently used for stretchable batteries [68, 69]. In 
this geometry it may be not necessary to put the separator within the cell [53].
In this architecture, the risk of shorting during battery mechanical stretching 
is minimal.
It should be noted that, independently of the battery architecture, the sealing 
process is an essential step in printed batteries. This process consists of a seal-
ing layer based on a polymer glue, which can be processed by the application of 
heat or pressure, with the main objective of protecting the battery against 
atmospheric gas molecules such as H2O and O2 [53, 70].
Energy storage within the sandwich architecture (Figure  1.6) has been 
increased by the development of interdigitated architectures, such as the one 
represented in Figure 1.8 [71]. The interdigitated architecture is based on elec-
trode digits separated by an electrolyte, allowing increased surface area for the 
electrodes. In this architecture, the Li+ transport paths are shorter, reducing 
the electrical resistances across the battery [72]. Further, the ohmic drop of the 
interdigitated architecture is lower due to the smaller electrolyte/separator 
layer, leading to increased power.

Printed Batteries: An Overview
11
Several works have been reported on interdigitated architectures fabricated 
by printing technologies, such as screen‐printing, ink‐jet printing and 3D‐
printing [73, 74].
Printed batteries based on interdigitated architectures have been fabricated 
based on lithium inks for anode, Li4Ti5O12 (LTO), and cathode, LiFePO4 (LFP), 
with high energy density, 9.7 J cm−2, at a power density of 2.7 mWcm−2 [74], 
values compatible with their use in microelectronics and biomedical devices.
The combination of printing technologies and batteries results in novel archi-
tectures, customizable for specific applications. In this sense, Figure 1.9 shows a 
“gear architecture”, recently proposed, resulting from the application of the inter-
digitated architecture to circular batteries. This geometry is suitable for smart‐
watches, mobile phones and medical devices, among other applications [75].
Thus, printed batteries allow the development of novel architectures with 
optimized performance and better integration into specific devices [75].
1.4  ­Main Advantages and Disadvantages 
of Printed Batteries
1.4.1  Advantages
Printed batteries cannot compete with conventional batteries in applications 
where there are no size and shape limitations. On the other hand, they can fill the 
gap for small portable devices in which size, weight and improved integration in 
the device are some of the main requirements [35]. Other relevant areas for 
printed batteries are devices in which flexibility and stretch ability are required.
Other main motivations for the implementation of printed batteries is 
to  reduce production costs and/or to achieve specific design features that 
printing technologies can provide [35].

The main advantages of printed batteries are summarized in Figure 1.10.
The main advantages of printed batteries are: easy production and inte-
gration; the fact that they are compact and portable, flexible and customiz-
able; and the fact that they can be printed in series connection and allow 
fabrication of large‐area devices (Figure 1.10). Printed batteries can be thin-
ner than a millimeter, lighter than a gram, mechanically flexible and stretch-
able, allow specific designs and involve cost‐effective production on a large 
scale [35].
One of the relevant advantages of printed batteries is the series connection 
of cells through printing technologies. In fact, the fabrication of printed batter-
ies up to 15 cells has already been demonstrated [53].
1.4.2  Disadvantages
At the present moment, the higher cost of printed batteries in comparison to 
conventional batteries is one of the main drawbacks hindering the growth of 
their market share. Other problems are the need to develop new functional 
materials (inks) and to optimize processing.
It is expected that as production volumes increase and technology improves, 
the cost of printed batteries will decrease and they will compete with conven-
tional batteries in price [76].

batteries.

In particular, the cost of printing batteries will be reduced through new 
manufacturing approaches (simplification of manufacturing methods) and 
through the development of lower‐cost inks for the main components (elec-
trodes and separator/electrolyte) [66].
1.5  ­Application Areas
There is an increasing number of powered small and portable devices such 
as  RFID devices, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), micro sensors, 
powered cards, smart toys and medical devices, among others; these are the 
main application areas of printed batteries (Figure 1.12).
Medical device applications of printed batteries include health‐monitoring 
systems, wound‐care and cosmetic uses, wireless patches for patient moni-
toring (electrocardiograms, monitoring of vital signs), and patient wristbands 
[77]. Being thin, flexible and disposable are common requirements of printed

batteries for these applications. Further, it is necessary to adjust printed battery 
performance in terms of power and energy values, lifetime and discharge rate, 
depending on the application.
Thus, RFID tags require about 5.14 mW during the active state with a current 
consumption of 700 nA at 1.5 V, which represents a five‐year operation for a 50 
mAh battery [78]. In the case of transdermal‐drug‐delivery (TDD) systems 
printed batteries can power the integrated circuit that ensures the proper dos-
age control. For this system, the typical capacity value is 57 μA.cm−2 and, there-
fore, when using a printed battery with a capacity of 247 mWh, the system will 
continuously work for 12 days [35].
1.6  ­Commercial Printed Batteries
Printed batteries are already commercially available and, as previously indi-
cated, are used in small portable electronic devices [35].
Different companies offer standard printed batteries and it is also possible 
to obtain customized batteries with different application requirements [35]. 
The current main producers of printed batteries are BrightVolt [79], Power 
Paper Ltd [80], Enfucell [55], Blue Spark [56], Imprint Energy [81] and Prelonic 
technologies [82].
The main commercially available printed batteries are non‐rechargeable 
­batteries based on zinc‐manganese dioxide (Zn/MnO2) with ZnCl2 as an 
­electrolyte. They are printed on plastic substrates and the open circuit 
­voltage  is  typically over 1.6 volts for the batteries produced by Blue Spark 
and Enfucell [55, 56].
These batteries do not contain heavy metal components and the operation 
temperature range is −30 °C to 65 °C. BrightVolt produces high‐energy‐density 
printed batteries based on solid‐state electrolyte.
All commercially available printed batteries are customizable in terms of 
voltage, size, shape, capacity and polarity and the shelf‐life is from two to more 
than five years depending on the temperature [56].
Depending on its size and technology (Zn/MnO2 and lithium), the price of 
printed batteries is in the range $2 to $5 for each battery.
1.7  ­Summary and Outlook
The growing interest in and applicability of printed batteries is related to the 
increasing interest in thin and flexible energy storage devices produced at low 
cost and based on eco‐friendly materials in order to meet modern society’s needs.
Printed batteries are an excellent alternative to conventional batteries for 
applications such as small and portable devices, radio frequency sensing, inter-
active packaging, medical devices and related consumer products, but it is

necessary to further optimize the production cost and to develop new ink for-
mulations to obtain higher capacities and voltages.
This chapter provided a general overview of the main characteristics, types, 
designs, advantages, disadvantages and applications of printed batteries, topics 
which will be further explored in the following chapters of this book.
There are both non‐rechargeable and rechargeable printed batteries and the 
main types are lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) and Zn‐MnO2 batteries. One of the 
key issues for printed batteries is the development of suitable inks for high‐per-
formance printed battery components that are compatible with the desired 
print process, such as ink‐jet or screen‐printing. Thus, each ink should be pre-
pared with optimized rheological properties for each printed technology, to 
ensure reliable flow, promote adhesion between the printed features, and pro-
vide the structural integrity needed for the ­functional battery.
The main challenges for printed batteries are the development of: high‐per-
formance ink formulations for each component, fully printed batteries, and 
novel battery architectures to improve device integration. Novel ink formula-
tions for electrodes are continuously being reported in the literature but there 
is still a need to improve ink quality based on eco‐friendly materials, to increase 
functional performance and to improve processability by different print tech-
nologies, including 3D printing. Further, it is essential to develop inks for the 
separator/electrolyte layer with strongly improved ionic conductivity, electro-
chemical stability and high mechanical strength.
The development of fully printed batteries is another very important chal-
lenge. In this case it is necessary to increase the compatibility of the inks for 
each component, leading to a more efficient printing process for the multilayer 
structure, a reduction of the internal impedance of the battery and an increase 
in cycling performance.
Finally, new design/architectures for printed batteries should be envisaged 
and fabricated with suitable delivered capacity and voltage for specific applica-
tions and improved device integration.
Despite these existing challenges, it can be concluded that printed batteries 
are part of current technological development, show a bright future for an 
increasing number of applications, and will enable a new generation of low‐
cost, portable and flexible applications.

2.1  ­Introduction/Abstract
The printing process involves the application of a specific ink onto a chosen 
substrate to form a predefined patterned layer of a certain layer thickness. 
After deposition of the ink the deposited ink needs to be dried, i.e. the solvents 
needed for the printing process itself need to be evaporated.
In Figure 2.1 numerous printing and patterning technologies that are used in 
production environments are shown. Not all of them can be used for printing 
batteries or the layers thereof. The left axis (Sheet‐fed to Web‐fed) indicates 
the application area. Sheet‐based processes usually work on single sheets of 
material. Each single sheet needs to be aligned for the printing process. For 
increased speed, web‐based material is commonly used because handling will 
become easier and therefore handling and printing speed can be increased.
All printing and patterning technologies were developed long ago, when 
printing of batteries was not even thought of. Therefore, optimization pro-
cesses targeted goals other than technical application of functional layers. 
Nevertheless, developments to date are a reasonable basis for adopting print-
ing technologies for the deposition of material layers that can, for example, be 
employed in the manufacture of batteries.

In this chapter, the most common printing techniques are addressed, while 
substrate and ink issues are discussed in detail in Chapter 3.
2.2  ­Materials and Substrates
The increasing use of primary and secondary batteries in a wide range of 
­applications from smartphones and computers to electric vehicles leads to the 
need to improve their autonomy and to adjust their manufacturing process to 
specific application needs. Thus, additive manufacturing allows the fabrication 
of batteries for specific electronic devices [1, 2].
It is estimated that the global market in secondary batteries will grow more 
than 6% each year mainly due to the development of new materials but also due 
to the application of large‐scale printing methods [3–5].
The junction between batteries and printing techniques results in printed 
batteries for areas such as radio‐frequency identification (RFID) devices, trans-
dermal‐drug‐delivery (TDD) systems, powered cards, smart toys and sensors, 
among others [6, 7].
The main types of printed batteries are lithium‐ion, Zn/MnO2 and Zn/Ag, 
which differ mainly in their constitutive materials [7].
Independently of the battery type, all printed batteries are composed of 
two different current collectors, two electrodes (anode and cathode) and the 
separator, as shown in Figure 2.2.

In the case of printed batteries, all materials should first be transformed into 
inks in order to be printable. Table 2.1 shows the main constituents of the dif-
ferent components of printed batteries.
Independently of the battery type, these batteries can be printed on different 
substrates such as plastic based on PET, PEN, polyimide, paper and fibrous 
substrates, depending on the device application [19, 20]. A sufficient sealing of 
the substrate, especially for lithium‐based systems, is needed.
Ideally, these substrates should be flexible and chemically stable, as well 
as not suffering modifications at the temperatures needed for curing the inks 
[20, 21]. Further, substrates should be chosen taking into account the printing 
technique and device design [22]. Typically, it is necessary to apply a surface 
treatment to the different substrates in order to improve the adhesion of the 
ink and increase the quality of the printing [23].
Generally, the surface treatment is applied to the different substrates to reduce 
their hydrophobicity since the surface energy value determines the interaction 
between the ink and the substrate and defines the printing quality [23].
Polymer substrates are the most frequently used in printed batteries due to 
their high resistance to chemicals, and their light weight and flexibility [7].
2.3  ­Printing Techniques
All printing techniques that are employed for printing batteries were devel-
oped for applications in the graphic arts industry. The requirements of func-
tional printing are fundamentally different to those of graphics. Graphic arts

addresses solely the human eye and its perception. Therefore, all printing tech-
nologies have been optimized for deposition of small dots of color that are per-
ceived by the human eye as “nature‐like”. To achieve this goal printing technologies 
deposit layers of materials. These deposition properties as well as the patterned 
manner of the deposition of most printing technologies are the basic properties 
that make them so suitable for the well‐controlled deposition of material. We call 
this approach “additive”, indicating that we just deposit material at the pattern 
geometry where it is really needed. In contrast “subtractive” lithographic pro-
cesses first cover the whole area with a material film, pattern this film, remove 
some parts of it and carry out a chemical etching process to unveil areas.

All printing technologies have unique features in respect to feature size, 
accuracy, layer thickness and printing speed, and also the capability to handle 
inks with a certain particle size.
2.3.1  Screen Printing
Originally, the screen for the printing was made out of silk; therefore, often this 
printing technique is called “silk screen printing”. The advantage of this print-
ing technology is that it can cope with rough and big particles (up to several 
tens of µm) [24]. Furthermore, the deposited layers may vary from less than 
1 µm to more than 100 µm – in just one printing step [25]. The inks that can be 
processed are in a viscosity range from 100 cP to 100,000 cP [26]. Some applica-
tions can be found in [27–30].
Screen printing is used in graphic arts for the printing of textile fabrics, 
advertisement panels or even glass windows. Materials can be flat (plastics; 
fiber‐based, such as paper or fabrics; or metal) or 3D‐shaped (such as bottles, 
encasings or even devices). In these applications much material is needed to 
colorize the textile fabrics and to ensure a long‐lasting illustration. In all appli-
cations the robustness of the screen printing technique is the advantage. Also 
the screen is scalable to sizes up to several square meters.
It originated with stencil printing (see below). Especially for textile fabrics, 
the technique developed to include a supporting grid for the stencil layer to 
also cover isolated areas. In this development silk was the supporting material 
for the stenciled areas.
Nowadays the silk is replaced by polymeric or metal meshes.
Layer thicknesses of screen printing can be in the range 20 nm to 1 mm [31].
There are more than 50 known parameters that influence the screen printing 
process [32]. The most important parameters are given in Table 2.2.
Basically there are two main setups for screen printing: flatbed and rotary 
screen printing. The common features and the differences are discussed below. 
There are also other setups established in the industry, such as employing a 
rotary screen for flatbed printing. Also, first approaches are shown to use 
screen printing for material deposition onto 3D‐shaped objects.
Screen printing has been used in printing layers of batteries on various kinds 
of substrate: plastics [34, 35], aluminum [36], paper [37], glass [15], textile [38].
2.3.1.1  Flatbed
In Figure 2.3 the setup of the screen printing process is shown.
Screen printing is a technology in which the ink is transferred from one side 
of the printing form onto the substrate that is located beneath the other side of 
the printing form.
In flatbed screen printing the substrate is fixed to a base plate so that the 
printing area is flat. With a distance in the order of millimeter the screen is 
held in parallel (jump distance). The screen material is fixed in a metal frame

to enable a defined tension for the screen mesh. The screen itself consists of a 
fabric of threads enabling the transfer of material through open meshes. To 
determine the pattern of the transferred material one side of the meshes is 
coved by a screen emulsion. Therefore, the second function of the screen is to 
mount the stencil elements. On top of the screen the ink is placed and moved 
by a squeegee. The squeegee applies a define pressure onto the screen, so it 
gets in direct contact to the substrate in the printing line. Outside this line 
there is a gap between them, supporting the ink transfer process. The trans-
ferred ink will remain on the substrate if the adhesion and cohesion forces are 
well balanced so that only a minor fraction will remain on the screen.
The ink will be at the left side of the screen after the printing step. To move 
it back to the right side a flood bar is used (it is mounted on the left‐hand side 
of the squeegee; in moving right to left it is lifted; only for pushing the ink it is 
lowered onto the screen mesh) moving in the opposite direction to the squee-
gee. In this process the material is distributed over the whole mesh and the 
open mesh areas are filled with ink. In the printing process the stop position of 
the ink can be optimized: either kept to the left side to restrict evaporation of 
the solvent or flooded over the printing area. In the latter case the evaporation 
effects are much stronger.
2.3.1.2  Rotary
This basic principle has been modified for industrial processes to gain higher 
throughput. For example, for web‐fed applications the screen mesh is not flat 
but built as a cylinder, the so‐called rotary screen. The advantage is that after 
each rotation the printing can be continued. This is, for example, used for the 
screen printing of textiles in lengths of several hundred meters without any 
disruption. A schematic drawing is given in Figure 2.4.

The relative movement of squeegee and substrate web is still the same in this 
setup; the squeegee is fixed but the screen mesh as well as the substrate are 
being moved. Therefore, the transfer across the screen mesh is technologically 
identical.
2.3.1.3  Screen Mesh
One fundamental parameter in the screen printing process is the screen itself. 
The amount of ink is determined by the setup of the screen as well as the maxi-
mum particle size that can be transferred.
The screen type is usually referred to as a number like
	
120
24 YPW	
In this expression 120 is the threads per cm (in the U.S. per inch) and 24 is 
the diameter of the threads in µm. The letter “Y” indicates a yellow mesh mate-
rial while a “W” would indicate a white one. “PW” is indicating a plain weave 
while alternatively “TW” stands for twill weave. These parameters are shown 
in Figure 2.5.
The next parameter of the screen printing form is the emulsion layer, which 
covers all the mesh areas that should not transmit any material and therefore 
determines the print pattern. In Figure  2.6 this layer that prevents any ink 
transfer at these locations is shown.
To increase the transferred ink volume it is common to thicken this emulsion 
layer to more than the typical 8 µm [39].
When calculating the transferred ink volume one might take into account 
that only about 70% of the calculated mesh volume is emptied during the print-
ing process [39]. Taking this into calculation, [39] presents the formula for 
calculation as

where	
hs is the fabric thickness (usually 2 × dw); dw is the diameter of wire in 
fabric
kr is the relative fabric openness; kr = [(m – dw)/m]2
with	
m = 1/M is the wire pitch of fabric
M is the mesh count per unit length
Equation (1) is usually simplified to hw = hs kr [39–41].
2.3.1.4  Squeegee
The squeegee is the most important parameter besides the screen mesh and 
ink when the printing process is performed. The squeegee has several tasks to 
fulfill:
a)	 The squeegee moves the ink across the screen, fills the open meshes and 
moves inks from the closed meshes.
b)	 By applying pressure onto the screen the squeegee generates a contact line 
between ink, screen and substrate for ink transfer.
c)	 The speed and properties of the squeegee influence the ink transfer.
Depending on the pattern feature size a low printing speed is recommended 
for a high‐resolution pattern. In battery printing most patterns are very coarse 
so that a higher squeegee speed can increase the transferred layer thickness.
There are two main important properties of the squeegee: hardness and 
shape [42]. To easily differentiate the hardness there are, for example, red 
(60°–65° shore), green (70°–75° shore), and blue (75°–80° shore) elastomer 
materials used. The higher the shore number the harder (i.e. less elastic) 
the elastomer is. A very high number ensures very high pressure with low

deformation of the squeegee in the printing process, resulting in a very high 
feature size [43].
With increasing substrate hardness, the squeegee material should be softer 
to enable a reliable ink transfer.
Employing a rectangular squeegee profile will result in a narrow contact line 
while a rounded profile will have a broader contact line enabling a higher vol-
ume of ink transfer. Therefore, the type of squeegee has a big influence on the 
transferred layer thickness [44].
Also important for the printing process is the angle of the squeegee with 
respect to the screen [45]. The variation of this parameter will also influence 
the resulting pressure within the ink during the printing process and conse-
quently the amount of ink transferred.
2.3.2  Stencil Printing
Stencil printing is shown in Figure 2.7.
In a stencil pattern there are open and covered areas on the substrate. Ink is 
transferred through every uncovered area. The big disadvantage compared to 
screen printing is that due to the lack of any mounting material all stencil areas 
need to be connected to each other. Therefore, it is impossible to have isolated 
covered stencil areas without at least a small connection to the other stencil 
material.
In stencil printing there are two options in applying the ink material. The 
first is spray coating onto the substrate. The covered areas are also inked and 
the ink stays on those areas. If there is a surplus of material it will flow towards

31
the non‐covered areas and lead to an unpredictable layer thickness distribu-
tion. Furthermore, surplus material might also be swallowed between stencil 
and substrate resulting in spoilage printouts.
The second method of stencil printing is the use of a doctor blade. In this 
case the ink is deposited on one side of the stencil and moved by the doctor 
blade across the stencil form, filling the open areas. This approach is much 
more reliable compared to spray‐coating application. Nevertheless, due to 
the abovementioned restrictions screen printing is the preferred method of 
material application.
2.3.3  Flexographic Printing
Letterpress printing (a technique of relief printing) is the oldest printing tech-
nology. Starting in the middle of fifteenth century, it was most commonly 
used in the book printing process. For the following centuries, letterpress 
printing was the prevalent printing technology for newspapers and printed 
documents for government, businesses and churches. In the early 1900s, a 
modified letterpress printing method called flexography became predomi-
nant in the printing industry, since it can be used to print on almost any type 
of substrate [30, 46–49].
2.3.3.1  Letterpress Printing
Letterpress printing is a mechanical process in which the highly viscous pasty 
ink is transferred onto the substrate via the hard printing elements (for exam-
ple, lead lettering) using high pressure. In Figure 2.8, the ink is transferred from

the ink container/fountain to the raised printing elements on the hard printing 
plate via inking rollers to homogenize the layer thickness. The impression 
roller consequently presses the substrate onto the printing plate. Finally, the 
ink is transferred/printed onto the substrate.
Based on the different pressing methods involved, letterpress printing 
presses and machinery are divided into hand presses and platen, high speed 
presses and web presses. There is also an indirect letterpress printing method 
(letterset), in which the ink is transferred from the printing plate to the sub-
strate via a blanket cylinder.
2.3.3.2  Flexography
Flexography is a modified method of letterpress printing technology. It uses 
low viscosity inks and resilient, flexible printing plates and applies low pressure 
between plate cylinder and substrate. Due to the implementation of flexible 
printing plates, which are made from rubber and photopolymeric plastic, flex-
ography can be used for printing on all types of paper, cardboard, rough surface 
packaging materials and fabrics.
The printout quality of flexography for graphic arts is lower compared to the 
products of offset printing. However, the development of new types of printing 
plate, adapted ink and technical printing press has remarkably improved the 
printout quality offered by flexography.
The flexography printing process shown in Figure 2.9 utilizes an anilox roller 
to transfer the ink from the ink container with a chambered doctor blade onto 
the soft printing plate. The print image is then transferred to the substrate by 
pressing the impression roller to the printing plate.

The flexography requires a slight contact pressure to transfer ink from print-
ing plate to substrate. The resilient and flexible printing plate provides a good 
printout result even with low contact pressure. It must be considered that 
deformation and wear of the flexible printing plate can lead to considerable 
dot‐size increase and dot gain. Furthermore, the polymeric printing form may 
be damaged if incompatible solvents are used.
The rubber printing plates are manufactured by molding a matrix using 
natural rubber. The best quality rubber plate is produced by applying a laser to 
engrave the fully coated elastomer plate cylinder.
Photopolymer printing plates are manufactured using the UV light exposure 
process. The exposed photopolymer area is crosslinked and then washed‐off. 
Single layer plates are made in thicknesses from 0.76 mm up to 6.35 mm 
depending on the print products. There is also a multilayer plate with the com-
bination of a relatively hard thin layer plate and a compressible substructure. 
The multilayer plate is used for high‐quality halftone printing.
Further Development of Letterpress/Flexography Printing
Traditional letterpress printing has obviously become insignificant due to the 
advantages of flexography printing (low viscous inks, many types of substrate, 
etc.). Many developments and enhancements have been achieved in the field of 
flexography printing. The quality of printed products in flexography printing 
has improved and is close to the high quality of offset and gravure printing. 
Very good progress has been made in the prepress area of flexography printing 
as a result of computer‐to‐plate technology. The application of sleeves as print-
ing master also contributes greatly to good printout results.
2.3.4  Gravure Printing
Gravure printing started in the early fifteenth century and is a very old print-
ing process. It is a very good printing technology for illustrations, producing 
very high image quality printouts. Typical products of gravure printing 
include magazines, catalogs, carrier bags, stamps, bank notes and security 
paper. Due to its high accuracy it is also widely employed in functional print-
ing processes [50–52].
Contrary to letterpress printing technology, gravure printing technology has 
the distinctive feature that the image elements are etched/engraved onto the 
surface of the printing cylinder. These etched/engraved elements are called 
cells and the non‐printing areas are at the original level. The first step of the 
printing process (Figure 2.10) is the inking of the entire gravure cylinder (both 
the printing and non‐printing areas). The ink is then wiped out of the non‐
printing areas using a doctor blade. After the doctor‐blading process, the ink 
just remains inside the cells of the gravure cylinder. Finally, the impression

roller presses the substrate onto the gravure cylinder and the ink is transferred 
to the substrate by a high printing pressure and the adhesive force between the 
ink and the substrate keeps it there.
In Figure 2.10 the typical structure of a gravure cylinder is shown. The steel 
cylinder is coated with a very thin nickel layer (1–3 µm) and an electroplated 
base copper layer (2 mm). On the top of the base copper layer, there is one 
coating layer (100 µm) of engraving copper or Ballard skin layer which is 
engravable (cuttable). On the outmost side of the cylinder is the thin chro-
mium protecting layer, which ensures a long life for the gravure cylinder 
(Figure 2.11).
The image to be printed is broken up into single printing elements, so‐called 
printing cells. These cells are engraved into the gravure cylinder. The engrav-
ing process can be carried out by etching, electromechanical engraving or the 
laser engraving technique.

The advantages of gravure printing technology are the simplicity of the 
printing process, the high‐quality printouts and the high output and consist-
ency of products. However, a significant disadvantage is the expensive and 
time‐consuming preparation process of the gravure cylinder. Therefore, pro-
gressive attempts have been made to replace the rigid gravure cylinder with 
quickly changeable printing plates or with sleeve technology. Laser engraving 
was also developed to provide a fast, high‐precision engraving technique in 
gravure cylinder manufacturing.
2.3.5  Lithographic/Offset Printing
Lithographic printing is widely used for newspaper and job printing in print 
houses for moderate numbers of copies (1,000–300,000). It is a high‐throughput 
technique, which is depicted in Figure 2.12.
The basic printing principle is to differentiate two areas on the printing plate 
as between their surface properties: an oleophilic and an oleophobic pattern. 
For the printing process, first, water is applied to the printing plate, covering all 
oleophobic areas. After this process the oil‐based ink is applied to the printing 
plate, covering all oleophilic areas, while being repelled from all water‐covered 
oleophobic areas. The inked printing plate is transferred onto a blanket cylin-
der and then applied to the substrate. A couple of rollers are applied to the 
water as well as to the ink supply.

The whole process will generate some maculation copies until the equilib-
rium status in the printing process has been reached. This number might be 
some single copies up to several hundreds.
The main working principle is to use ink and supporting agent (for 
­example, water) with oleophilic and oleophobic properties. These require-
ments generate an obstacle for battery production, so that no application 
is known.
2.3.6  Coating
A coating technique consists in applying a solution composed of different 
components, such as polymers and particles, within a polymer solvent, in 
which a film is obtained after solvent evaporation [53]. This technique can be 
divided into doctor blade (or tape casting) and spray coating, where the main 
differences between the techniques are the application procedure and the 
different ink properties, such as ink viscosity. For spray coating, the solution 
is sprayed onto the substrate by spray guns [54] and for doctor blade coating, 
the solution is spread through the blade by unidirectional movement on a 
substrate [55, 56]. Figure  2.13 shows a schematic representation of both 
techniques.
For both techniques, the formation of the film and its quality are influ-
enced by the solution formulation, i.e. solvent type and concentration, solids 
loading and their dispersion, which affect the viscosity value, but also sol-
vent evaporation temperature and surface energy of the substrate [57]. 
These technologies are also widely used for the manufacturing of organic 
solar cells [48, 58].
In the doctor blade technique, the coating speed is related to the shear stress 
and is an important parameter with linear speeds between 1 and 100 mm.s−1 
being typically needed for meniscus formation between blade and solution.

The final thickness of the coating after solvent evaporation can be calculated 
through the following equation [59]:
	
d
g c

(1)
where g is the gap distance between the blade and the substrate, c is the con-
centration of the solid material in the ink in g.cm−3 and ρ is the density of the 
material in the final coating in g.cm−3. A decrease or increase in the blade gap 
can be correlated linearly with the thickness of the coating, which is also 
affected by the casting speed [60]. With this technique, it is possible to obtain 
thin film with a thickness of 5 µm but the typical thickness of coatings is 
above 25 µm.
Spray coating is a very fast and simple technique where the process control 
parameters are air pressure, solution viscosity and evaporation rate of the sol-
vent, as well as properties of the gun such as its geometry. Some authors state 
that the viscosity and surface tension of the solution are not particularly rele-
vant issues for this technique since the air pressure is the most important fac-
tor and can be adjusted for each gun and solution [54].
Finally, the efficiency of the spray coating is determined by other parameters 
such as the distance between the nozzle and the substrate, and the flow rate of 
the solution [61].
Table  2.3 shows the most relevant advantages and disadvantages of the 
­doctor blade and spray‐coating techniques.
Taking into consideration the advantages and disadvantages presented in 
Table 2.3, both techniques are already used for printed batteries, where the 
main advantages common to both are their simplicity and facility for produc-
ing thin films in large areas [7].

Both techniques have been applied for the development of printed 
­batteries, in which the solvent concentration of the inks should be 
between  1  and 8 mL.g−1, depending on the particle size, size distribution 
and polymer type [62].

2.3.7.1  Inkjet Printing Technology and Applications
For the last two decades the most flexible of all the printing techniques has 
been inkjet printing technology. Inkjet printing technology has been catego-
rized as a digital manufacturing technology that has several advantages over 
conventional printing technologies, such as the ability to print variable data on 
commercial articles such as bar codes, serial numbers, identification graphics, 
anti‐counterfeiting elements, etc. on packaging. The technology also offers the 
possibility of producing documents which do not require high quantities of 
consumables (e.g. ink and substrate), and each document can be individualized 
as in small office home office (SoHo) applications. In this case, documents can 
be of any kind, ranging from printing of certificates, flyers, event bookings and 
even official documentation. Another advantage is the low requirement for ink 
and substrate in the context of small and home office as the target application 
areas. The next promising aspect of inkjet printing comes from the technologi-
cal background itself – inkjet is a contactless printing technology, which means 
that there is no direct contact between the printhead and the substrate for the 
ink‐transferring mechanism [25, 63–66]. Inkjet printing technology offers 
several drop volumes in the range pL to μL, printing resolutions ranging from 
100 dpi to 5000 dpi, and resulting wet‐layer thickness ranging from 50 nm to 
10 µm depending on the ink used and the substrate implemented. These two 
basic properties of inkjet (technologically flexible and contactless) open up sev-
eral possibilities for contactless printing over irregular or asymmetric shapes and 
forms, e.g. commercial objects such as bottles, edible products, irregular pack-
ages, etc. Besides this, while the technology offers contactless ink deposition, 

Printing Techniques for Batteries
39
it can also have high deposition accuracy in the micrometer range (10 ± 5 µm). 
Also, due to the fact that the inkjet printing technology is implementation‐
wise very flexible and yet affordable, it is also widely used for research and 
development purposes in the state‐of‐the‐art application field of “printed 
functionalities” and “printed electronics or microelectronics”. Around the 
world, many researchers are focused on developing printed electronics prod-
ucts: active and passive devices such as capacitors, thin‐film‐transistors, resis-
tors, inductors, antennae, etc.; sensors and detectors based on elemental 
factors such as humidity, pressure, stress, strain, light, gas concentration, ther-
mal, etc.; energy harvesting/harnessing and power devices such as batteries, 
organic photovoltaics, piezo‐electric actuators, etc.; and at a very complex 
level, even circuits such as device arrays and voltage‐operated switching cir-
cuits based on logic gates. And on the other hand, development of printed 
functional layers such as printed sieves, lenses, haptics, photonics, etc. are 
other fascinating application areas.
In theory, there are different kinds of inkjet printing systems based on the 
backend technology, the drop‐ejection/printing mechanism, the printhead 
system architectures and the application areas. Two of the well‐known, typical 
kinds of inkjet printing technology are Drop‐on‐Demand “DoD” and 
Continuous Inkjet “CIJ”.
CIJ works on the principle of continuous drop generation. It is triggered by 
a voltage‐operated electronic transducer or actuator creating continuous 
impulse waves to force the ink out of the nozzle orifice in the form of a stream 
or jet. This stream or jet contains perturbation which breaks down in flight to 
drops of similar shape and volume. Furthermore, the drops become separated 
from each other with a specified distance and with certain drop velocity. They 
then enter the first electric field, where the drops are charged electrically with 
a single entity and now the charged drops enter a second electric field (pro-
cessed with deflection) possessing the opposite charge entity. Depending on the 
intended digitalized image (whether it is to contain a non‐printable or printable 
pixel), the opposite charge entity would not be activated (non‐­printable pixel) 
or activated (printable pixel). This process is also called deflection, and it 
allows the drops to be discriminated for printing from the continuous stream 
of flying drops. The drops that are not deflected go straight to the gutter, 
where they are redirected to the recirculation system and finally to the ink 
reservoir.
On the contrary, DoD inkjet technology works on a relatively simpler and 
very different principle. Discrimination of drops to be chosen to print a digital-
ized pixel is determined by the movement of the transducer or actuator itself. 
DoD‐based inkjet systems can be classified into two further technologies based 
on the working mechanism – thermal inkjet technology (TIJ) or piezo‐electric 
inkjet technology (PIJ). The schematics for such DoD‐ and CIJ‐based inkjet 
systems can be seen in Figure 2.14 [25, 63, 65, 66].

Printed Batteries
40
In the case of a thermal inkjet system, which is also known as bubble inkjet, 
the transducer or actuator is basically a voltage‐operated thermal resistor 
(thermistor) which can be heated up to a very high temperature. The ink gen-
erally has to be in contact with this thermistor, thereby producing a bubble‐like 
vacant structure at the interface of the ink and thermistor. This bubble, at this 
high temperature, expands and explodes in volume, and to compensate for the 
internal volume expansion and the pressure within the ink reservoir, the ink 
drops are effectively forced out of the nozzle. The amount of increase in the 
temperature of the thermistors is dependent on the application of voltage to 
them, which is controlled by the application of electronic signals for either a 
printable pixel digitalized image or non‐printable pixel digitalized image. 
Hence, it can be said that the drop‐ejection system based on thermal inkjet 
technology is very complicated and is limited in relation to the choice of mate-
rials. Only certain solvent‐based inks compatible with this technology are 
especially designed for the printing process. On the positive side, inkjet print-
ers are very suitable for low‐quantity SoHo applications and the initial invest-
ment or replacement costs are relatively low.
The mechanism of the drop ejection in the case of piezo‐electric‐based DoD 
inkjet system is very simple and can be considered similar to thermal inkjet

technology. The main principle behind drop ejection is the same, that is, com-
pensation for the expanded ink volume within the ink reservoir. As already 
indicated here the ink movement is controlled by the impulse pressure waves 
triggered by the piezo‐electric transducer or actuator. When voltage is applied 
to such piezo‐electric actuators in positive and negative entity, their neutral 
shape starts to deform inwards or outwards. This inwards movement retracts 
the ink from the main ink chamber and the outwards movement creates a pres-
sure wave impulse which propagates through the stagnant ink directed to the 
walls of the ink chamber. Then, as the pressure wave retreats it is opposed by 
the second phase of the pressure wave impulse propagated from the piezo‐
electric actuator. When these different‐phased pressure wave impulses meet, 
they superimpose over each other. Thus, there is an increase in the ink volume 
inside the chamber and in order to compensate for this, increment drops are 
jetted out of the nozzle orifice. These drops jetted out of the nozzle place them-
selves at equal distances from each other with a constant drop velocity, finally 
reaching the target substrate. This movement of the actuator is controlled by 
electronic signals that are generated by the digitalized image containing either 
printable or non‐printable pixels (image or non‐image area). Piezo‐electric‐
based DoD inkjet systems are generally more user friendly and there is an 
enormous choice of ink materials that can be used for the printing process 
whether for small SoHo applications or large industrial applications.
Another kind of inkjet technology which is very different from either TIJ‐ or 
PIJ‐based actuation technology is recently grabbing attention. This is called 
Super‐fine Inkjet Technology (SIJ), which is based on the principle of electro‐
hydrodynamic inkjet technology. In this technology, the basic principle is to 
control the droplet and its size with the help of electrostatic forces and without 
any involvement of mechanical action for drop generation or ejection. Such a 
scheme is shown in Figure 2.15 [67–71].

The main motivation of SIJ is to extend the limit of printing resolution for 
inkjet printing technology. SIJ creates an oscillating electric field or electro-
static forces between the substrate plate and the ink reservoir (ink meniscus 
within the nozzle), thereby charging the ink and controlling the ink meniscus 
to form drops by altering the electric field or the charge accumulation. The 
voltage actuation can be oscillated and this influences the strength of the elec-
tric field, resulting in a definite ink drop size. The electrical parameters of the 
substrate material and its conductivity will also affect the size of the ejected 
droplet. When the substrate material is insulating or non‐conductive, e.g. 
plastic, then the charge accumulation at the substrate surface also occurs dur-
ing the process of printing. For SIJ also, the waveform determines the size, 
volume and shape of the drop. In the case of a unipolar waveform, the charge 
accumulation will decrease the effective electric field at the ink meniscus 
leading to a smaller droplet size. Some of the very general parameters which 
can be varied for altering the drop size and shape are as follows: voltage (value 
and amplitude) for the oscillating electric field, waveform (sinusoidal or 
square depending on the ink), frequency of oscillating electric field, printing 
speed and nozzle to substrate distance. SIJ technology operates over a wide 
range of fluidic viscosity 1–30 mPas. The drop volume can be varied between 
0.1–1 fL with a small nozzle tip < 10 µm and printing speed of ~1 mm/s. With 
this technology, printed line width of < 5 µm is easily achievable, with a drop 
size of 1–5 µm. And in some cases, sub‐µm line widths are achieved when the 
drop size is further reduced, with drops exhibiting no spilling/splashing effect 
once they land on the substrate. SIJ is another very promising technology, 
which is presently used intensively from research laboratory scale to indus-
trial scale [67–71].
Inkjet can no longer be considered as suitable only for sheet‐to‐sheet (S2S) 
printing technology in DIN‐A4‐size format. It has grown massively during the 
last 20 years and has proven its existence as a relevant, mature industrial tech-
nology. The technology has been upscaled to wide‐format printing platforms 
where rolls of textiles, posters, banners, decorative table cloths, wallpapers, 
etc. are manufactured on an industrial level. Printing width has increased 
to > 5 m and production capacity to > 120 m2/h. Moreover, the basic principle 
has stayed the same, with most of the printer manufacturing companies devel-
oping their printing systems based on the DoD inkjet system mounted with a 
robotic arm which can move along the printing axis, and this is combined with 
the curing process. Mostly, ultraviolet and thermally curable inks are used in 
various commercial applications. There is also a huge choice of compatible 
inks with specific fluidic properties which generally fit the inkjet printing cat-
egory. The print and manufacturing process for certain special applications 
can be modified according to customer needs. These kinds of printing systems 
can also be in S2S format with the post‐printing processes such as slitting, 
folding and perfecting, etc. already integrated into the system.

Printing Techniques for Batteries
43
Furthermore, there are various other inkjet systems based on DoD and CIJ 
which are very much based on industrial platforms, and production in this case 
is much higher. The main focus in this kind of printing system is to print fast, 
with the unwanted compromise on printing quality. Some common examples 
would be printed products such as newspapers, low‐budget magazines, books, 
pharmaceutical items, automobile mechanical parts, labels, bar and QR codes, 
gloss or varnish, and printing on irregular articles such as bottles, chocolates, 
eggs, etc. In all these production applications the requirement of fast printing 
speeds is inevitable and strictly required. Therefore, in many situations there is 
a need to develop R2R or R2R‐like inkjet print production lines. The produc-
tion line is custom designed according to the product fabrication requirements. 
The printing resolution, speed and print width of the printing process can be 
defined by the printhead type – number of nozzles, arrangement of nozzles 
and drop volume, number of printheads stacked beside each other, native reso-
lution of the printhead or angular rotation of the printhead setup, skewing of 
the digital image, and droplet‐jetting frequency with respect to the R2R mov-
ing web. Once the inkjet‐printed layer is deposited on the moving web, it is 
essential that the ink is dried using a post‐printing curing method installed 
inline after single‐ or multi‐color printing setup. The amount or duration of 
post‐printing curing is always defined by the number of printing steps. Also, 
for such printing setups, the main motivation is to vary the digital data or con-
tent for the process, e.g. in the case of labeling and code development by print-
ing. These applications come under the category of variable data printing. The 
process can even be adjusted for printing over irregularly shaped items, along 
with variations in the data deposited on the surface of the article. In some 
extreme cases, such R2R inkjet printing systems are also integrated with an 
R2R conventional process, e.g. gravure, flexography or offset printing press. 
The speed of the conventional R2R printing system is incomparably fast, and to 
complete the printing value chain, variable data must be integrated into the 
product. In this scenario, additional printhead bars (inkjet printing unit) are 
added at the end of the print workflow so that all the variable or special data 
can be deposited onto the products at the final phase. This kind of modifica-
tion is very logical and yet impressive for high‐production pilot lines.
Finally, a special application of inkjet printing technology is meeting cus-
tomized general public needs, e.g. low‐budget commercial products that can 
be built by rapid prototyping or even by three‐dimensional (3D) printing. The 
product range is basically enormous, e.g. figures, medical and surgical appli-
cations, tools and machinery, sports applications, aerospace applications, 
product conceptualization, architecture modeling, hobbies, toys, electronic 
gadgets, decorative items and jewelry, etc. All these products can be custom-
ized according to the consumer’s demands simply by altering the digital image 
and other necessary printing consumables. There are different kinds of tech-
nologies associated with 3D printing; they can be based on binder jetting or 

Printed Batteries
44
photopolymer jetting technologies. Although the working principles behind 
both are different, they demonstrate very efficient and versatile printing work 
flows. In both technologies, what is very important is the process of the digi-
talization. Digitalization includes development of 3D objects using computer 
aided designing (CAD) software. At the beginning, the digital design contains 
only the surface of the 3D object, using unit shapes which can be multiplied. 
In the next step, this model is split into multiple steps according to the required 
printing resolution from bottom to top of the 3D object. These processes are 
combined by tessellation. Once the process of digitalization is complete, the 
file is imported to the printer software‐recognition platform. In this phase, 
conversion of the digital image to software‐intelligible data is performed. This 
is critical because this conversion can lead to a loss of data, depending on the 
printing capability of the machine. Finally, these files are passed to the indi-
vidual printing technology to develop the 3D printed object. In the case of 
binder jetting technology, using the inkjet printheads, fluids are jetted onto a 
bed of powder, and these fuse during UV curing or the thermal post‐printing 
step. The bed is replenished with a flood of new powder and jetting is repeated 
for the next layer/s. The entire process of powder flooding and jetting is 
repeated until all the layers are printed from the bottom to the top of the 3D 
object. In these cases, several different kinds of color are desired, each having 
different mechanical or aesthetic properties, which can be realized using dif-
ferent inkjet printheads and jetting fluids. When all the layers are printed, the 
3D object is extracted from the powder bath and dipped into the infiltration 
solution. Here the object becomes more mechanically stable, and densifica-
tion of the intermediate porous layers which form the structure occurs. In the 
case of photopolymer jetting technology, the same procedure is used without 
the need for powder, due to the facts that the photopolymer can be UV cured 
and that structural stability is maintained by the object itself. If a multicolored 
figure is desired, this can be realized by the use of an increased number of 
photopolymer fluids, which can be applied inside different numbers of print-
heads. The realizable printing resolution in the latter case is much better than 
in the former, due to the non‐necessity for filler or materials for supporting 
the structure. The next section will deal with the market in terms of inkjet 
technology and its manufacture.
2.3.7.2  Selective View of the Market for Inkjet Technology
The inkjet printing technology industry is enormous and presently there are 
several competitors in this industry. The world of digital printing technology 
varies based on the backend technology. Some of the technologies are classic, 
and others are “state of the art”. In inkjet printing technology, companies such 
as Canon, Fujifilm, Xerox, Agfa, Kodak, Hewlett Packard, etc. are world leaders 
in the manufacturing of laboratory‐to‐fabrication inkjet printers. A second 
class of companies such as Xaar, Konica Minolta, Ricoh, etc. are leaders in 

Printing Techniques for Batteries
45
printhead manufacturing, developing print solutions or integrations. The big-
gest technological trade fair for printing and finishing technology took place in 
May–June 2016. The trade show is called Drupa. Here it could be seen very 
clearly that the world of printing technology is shifting from conventional roll‐
to‐roll (R2R) analog printing technologies, e.g. offset lithography, gravure, 
flexography, etc., to high‐throughput digital printing technologies for sheet‐to‐
sheet (S2S), roll‐to‐sheet (R2S), and roll‐to‐roll (R2R) production processes 
directed to the application and the requirements of the intended product. The 
primary parameters differentiating such printing systems are the following: a) 
printing speed, b) printable area, c) printing resolution, d) color reproduction, e) 
backend technology and (f) industrial processing capability. Following is 
a  showcase of exemplary inkjet printers and their corresponding technical 
specifications; these aspects makes them very attractive for graphic art print-
ing press companies.
One of the companies heavily engaged in digital printing technology for 
graphic arts is Agfa. Agfa has a series of printers called Jeti Titan, based on 
piezo‐electric DoD technology. The printing capability of such printers is 
enormous, e.g. six‐color printing with white on board, printing resolution 
of 720 dpi × 1200 dpi with drop volume of 7 pL, printable area of 2 m × 3 m, 
S2S  and R2S compatibility and more options for industrial adaptation and 
usability.
The next company which is very active in this respect is Canon. Canon 
manufactures various kinds of inkjet printers that suit S2S and R2R platforms, 
using piezo‐electric as well as thermal DoD backend technologies. Some com-
mon examples are the Océ Image Stream and VarioPrint Ultra Line series, 
which have industrial capabilities, e.g. offering up to 2.7 m/s on a 76 cm‐wide 
web, throughput of over 19,200 sheets/h for B2 format (500 mm × 707 mm), 
3,500 letter (215.9 mm × 279.4 mm) images per minute, which can be printed 
with native printing resolution of 1200 dpi × 1200 dpi. The company also pro-
duces printing machines based on modified technology such as transfer inkjet 
technology to achieve high printing speeds and resolutions; this technology 
uses the transfer of an image developed on an intermediate medium, e.g. blan-
ket, to the required substrate.
One of the other eminent companies active in the market of graphic art 
printing is Fujifilm. The company produces various kinds of digital presses 
based on inkjet technology (piezo‐electric DoD). One such high‐performance 
R2R or R2S digital press is Fujifilm Jet Press 540 W, which has many capabili-
ties, such as the production of four gray‐level values from the same printhead, 
providing printing resolution of 600 dpi × 600 dpi, offering printing speeds 
up to 127 m/min, for compatible substrate width of 546 mm and for various 
substrate thicknesses and grammage, such as 64–157 gm−2 paper. The second 
industrially relevant printing machine is the S2S‐compatible Fujifilm X3. 
The  printer is a flatbed production platform which uses the technology of 

Printed Batteries
46
UV‐based inks coupled with a powerful UV flatbed curing station. The print-
head installed in this machine offers drop volume between 9–27 pL, which 
can result into up to 600 dpi × 600 dpi. Production options vary from 
40–180 beds/h for a maximum substrate size of 3.22 m × 1.6 m. Another print-
ing machine offered by Fujifilm is called Acuity LED‐1600. The printer uses 
dedicated flatbed design with high‐resolution greyscale printheads used for 
Fujifilm Uvijet UV curing inks extended for 4, 6 or 8 color channels, with 
standard (1.25 m × 2.5 m), double‐sized (3.08 m × 2.5 m) bed versions and large 
(3.05 m × 2.5 m) bed sizes that can give a throughput of up to 35–155 m2/h. It 
has added features such as a multi‐zone/dual zone vacuum table and a power-
ful instant‐curing UV system. And finally, the last example is the Fujifilm 
Uvistar Pro8, which uses the Fujifilm Uvijet UV curing system and parallel 
drop size (PDS) technology for smooth images, offering 600–1200 dpi printing 
resolution, and Fujifilm Uvijet QN–UV curing inks for eight colors, which 
also includes lights and white as options. The throughput of such system is 
enormous: up to 275–353 m2/h for a maximum printing width of 3.5–5 m, 
respectively [75, 77–82].
Even in this era, when digital printing technology for large‐volume commer-
cial printed products is needed, collaboration between companies such as 
Heidelberg AG and Fujifilm, who are masters in offset lithography and inkjet 
technology respectively, is very predictable. This marks the beginning of a new 
hybrid technology. An example can be seen with the Heidelberg AG Gallus 
Labelfire 340 (shown in Figure 2.16b), which is a printer used for producing 
individualization, e.g. barcodes, data‐matrix codes, numbers, etc. The tech-
nologies are merged, with resulting capabilities such as printing of UV films 
with inkjet (piezo‐electric DoD) using MEMS based on Samba Technology, 
production speed up to 50 linear m/min (regardless of number of colors), pro-
duction throughput of 1,020 m2/h, printing resolution of 1200 dpi × 1200 dpi 
with 2 pL drop volume, which gives approximately 2400 dpi × 2400 dpi, up to 
eight digital color units and print width of maximum 340 mm. Another exam-
ple is Primefire 106 + L from Heidelberg AG (shown in Figure  2.16a). The 
printer is again a high‐aspect R2R digital printing press using Samba Technology 
(high width and high printing resolution). Another is RotaJet L from Koenig & 
Bauer Group AG. The printing system is again based on piezo‐electric DoD 
technology, with native resolution 1200 dpi × 1200 dpi, and uses a stack of 
printhead bars in an array along with KBA RotaColor polymer pigment ink. 
The maximum printing speed ranges from 150–300 m/min for a substrate 
width of 400–1380 mm; the post‐processing of the printed films is controlled 
by infrared dryers combined with hot air blowers on the moving paper web. As 
a result, print production capability of 87–349 million A4‐sized sheets/month 
is possible with throughput of 3.3–11.8 million m2/month.
Another interesting market is the field of research and development. Here, 
much research is focused on tuning the drop volume from the inkjet printhead

for producing fine lines, graphics and security‐based application products. 
One such technology is Super‐fine Inkjet Technology (SIJ) and one of the main 
producers of SIJ products is SIJTechnology Inc. from the Flexible Electronics 
Research Center and National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and 
Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. The best‐selling product is the SIJ‐S050 
from SIJTechnology Inc, Figure 2.17. The printer is based on electro‐hydrody-
namic inkjet technology. The fundamental mechanism behind the generation 
and tuning of the drop shape and volume was explained in the previous sec-
tion. The printer offers specialties such as: downscaling of the drop volume 
from 0.1 fL to 10 pL from the same nozzle; the ability of the printer to work 
with inks having viscosities of 0.5–10,000 cps (without heating); and the drop-
lets being one‐tenth smaller in size and one‐thousandth smaller in volume 
than those that can be used for developing patterns with line resolution < 1 µm. 
However, there are some drawbacks, such as the inability to upscale to multi‐
nozzle systems and a printing area of 5 cm × 5 cm. The technology suits a

variety of inks and especially non‐graphic‐based inks such as conductive, insu-
lating, resistant, UV, solvent and protein inks, etc. that are dedicated to printed 
functionalities and electronics [70, 71].
The next upcoming commercial market of note is the 3D inkjet printing 
application area, with the development of a fourth dimension which is built 
using the pre‐existing products. An example is the Omnifire printer produced 
by Heidelberg AG. The printing system can be seen in Figure 2.18. The printer 
uses the Samba Inkjet Technology (piezo‐electric DoD) from Fujifilm and 
develops printed layers of graphics on round or cylindrical objects with a 
diameter of 10–300 mm; it allows up to four colors including opaque white, 
with protection coating as an option, and a single‐pass printhead with 360 dpi 
as native printing resolution. The printer also includes drying or curing sys-
tems based on the type of ink used, and a modular mounting system for differ-
ent objects enabled by four‐axis‐robotics to move the objects during the 
printing process [88][90].
2.3.7.3  Advanced Applications: Printed Functionalities and Electronics
Printing beyond colors is something which is gaining attention worldwide. The 
pull towards printed functionalities and printed electronics is becoming more 
attractive in laboratory‐based research and development, and also in industri-
alization of such technologies for commercial products. Prominent products 
and companies in the area are: Autodrop dispensers from microdrop 
Technologies GmbH, the Dimatix Materials Printer and other industrial inkjet 
equipment from Fujifilm Dimatix, and inkjet printers from Notion Systems 
GmbH, Ceradrop and Pixdro. All these inkjet printer manufacturing compa-
nies rely on the printhead manufacturers, e.g. Fujifilm Dimatix, Konica 
Minolta, Ricoh, Xaar, etc. to develop their printing systems. The inkjet printers 
produced in this case follow the same concept from laboratory to fabrication,

which will promote industrialization of printed functionality and printed 
products in the market.
As for applications, many products are already being investigated at labo-
ratory scale, with printed functionality products that include printed sieves 
and printed microfluidics for medical and point‐of‐care medical diagnostic 
applications [98, 99]. There are also opportunities for producing inkjet‐
printed three‐dimensional structures on paper for electronic applications 
[100]. Also, with inkjet technology, development of surfaces for light‐absorb-
ing/light‐reflecting purposes is possible. One such example is the develop-
ment of printed lenses, which is not now restricted to laboratory‐level 
research since products such as micro‐lenses are industrialized worldwide 
[101]. Other examples of printed functional structures of great interest 
include supra‐balls and printed photonics which can be produced by inkjet 
printing technology where the aggregates are self‐assembled with special 
Figure 2.18  Image of application illustrating the potential for printing of graphics on 
three‐dimensional products using inkjet technology, e.g. the Omnifire from Heidelberg AG.

polymer materials [102, 103]. Another exceptionally promising field is 
printed electronics, where many researchers have introduced materials that 
can already be used for the fabrication process. This is mainly dedicated to 
the inkjet printing process and its corresponding applications [71, 72, 104]. 
Examples include printed conductive tracks which can be used for producing 
conductive grids for displays or capacitive screens and electronically func-
tional textiles [74–78, 105]. Here the processing of the deposited materials 
plays a very important role; therefore, fine tuning of the parameters is neces-
sary. Several researchers have carried out investigations in the direction of 
developing printed active and passive devices, e.g. inkjet‐printed thin‐film 
transistors, capacitors, diodes, etc. and have also shown the potential to 
upscale the fabrication technology for industrialization [79–82, 106–109]. 
Other examples are investigations in the field of printed radio‐frequency iden-
tification tags [83, 84, 85 86, 88], energy harnessing through printed solar 
cells [85, 87], detection or sensing using printed sensors or detectors [88–90], 
and developing circuits which can be used for various electronic require-
ments such as signal rectification or filtering and electronic switching [84, 
90, 91]. All these applications and upscalable approaches show that inkjet 
technology has become mature and is capable of being implemented in 
diverse ways to reach several commercial markets.
2.3.8  Drying Process
The drying process is a fundamental common step of different printing 
­techniques whereby inks in the liquid state are dried in order to form a 
film and properly adhere to the substrate. Different procedures have been 
applied in this drying step, including ultraviolet (UV) curing, infrared cur-
ing (IR), solvent evaporation at specific temperatures, and a mixture of 
­different procedures [110, 111]. Drying by solvent evaporation is a physical 
process, the most frequently used as a drying step in printing techniques, 
and consists of the removal of solvent for the formation of the dried 
solid [112].
There are different systems for evaporation drying, including air, vacuum, 
drum and centrifugation drying [113]. The most frequently used systems for 
evaporation drying are air and vacuum drying or a combination of both. The 
evaporation of the solvent is affected by temperature, vapor pressure, surface/
volume ratio and rate of air flow over the surface [112]. In this case, the drying 
curves (mass of ink solvent vs time) shows two main stages: a constant rate 
period and a falling rate period. The constant rate is the most important stage, 
and is controlled by the fluid dynamic state of the drying air. For electrode inks 
for printed batteries, the polymer binder crystallizes and redistributes during 
this process and the particles within the ink rearrange for the formation of the 
3D interconnected structure [111, 114].

Printing Techniques for Batteries
51
The falling rate stage is limited by the rate at which the liquid can pass 
through the solid to the free surface [111].
The mass transfer rate ( mD) of the drying system is given in the following 
equation [111]:
	
m

Where h is the average heat transfer coefficient, ρ is the gas density, cp is the 
specific heat at constant pressure, Le is the Lewis number, As is the surface 
area, M is the molar mass, Cs is the solvent vapor concentration of the ink 
surface and CA is the solvent vapor concentration of air.
For low concentration of the solvent, the f ρ and cp are approximately those 
of pure air.
The difference between air and vacuum systems is that in vacuum 
­systems  the environmental pressure is reduced, which lowers the heat 
needed for rapid drying. For vacuum systems, the solvent evaporation tem-
perature does not need to be as high in comparison to air systems, and the 
drying is often faster. Typically, vacuum drying shows advantages as less 
energy is needed for drying, cutting down on the economic and environ-
mental costs and in the potential damage in the materials caused by the 
drying process [115].
Evaporation rates of the solvent generally show an inverse relationship 
to  the respective boiling point, the vapor pressure value of the solvent 
­having  particular relevance to drying systems. Typically, the value of the 
vapor pressure of solvents increases as the temperature increases. In the 
case where the solvent pressure value is 760 mmHg (atmospheric pressure), 
solvent evaporation occurs throughout the liquid mass and not only at the 
surface [116].
For ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) curing, the inks are cured under expo-
sure to different energy types, i.e., UV light and infrared radiation, respectively 
[110]. In the case of UV drying, UV radiation with wavelengths between 100 
and 380 nm initiates a radiation polymerization or crosslinking (chemical dry-
ing), transforming the liquid ink into a solid film.
For this system, control of the physical properties of the ink is very impor-
tant, since the viscosity of inks limits the choice of the molecular weight of the 
monomers, solids and cure rate [110].
The advantages of this system are the lack of emission of volatile organic 
compound, the lower energy requirement, the space saving of the curing 
equipment, good adhesion to substrates, and overall increased “environmental 
friendliness” [110].
As well as these systems, it is also possible to cure the inks through the use of 
electron‐beam [117].

Printed Batteries

2.3.9  Process Chain
The manufacturing process of printed batteries requires different steps and 
procedures.
The main procedures for the fabrication of printed batteries are shown in 
Figure 2.19. For obtaining functional layers for the different components of the 
batteries it is first necessary to use suitable inks appropriate to each printing 
technique. For preparation of the ink, fabrication involves mixing of the differ-
ent constituents (polymer binder, active material and conductive agent) that 
inks for electrodes require, whereas for the fabrication of the layers, coating, 
pressing, slitting and drying are often needed.
Each electrode and separator/electrolyte can be produced separately, the 
battery assembly process being then a critical step. In the case of printed bat-
teries, the sealing or encapsulation process is essential for keeping the atmos-
phere constant without CO2 inside the battery during its lifetime. This process 
consists in applying a sealing layer based on a polymer glue that can be pro-
cessed by the application of heat or pressure [7].
It is also necessary to have good leak tightness for the electrolyte solution.
The substrate should present excellent barrier properties and must be stable 
to thermal treatment at the temperatures (approximately 130 °C) needed to 
increase the electric conductivity of the current collectors and electrodes.
One advantage of printed batteries is their integration into the devices for 
different applications, which is a differentiating factor with respect to other 
battery types, as well as other properties such as capacity, weight and dimen-
sions compared to conventional batteries.
Another important procedure is the testing step applied to all batteries, 
which results in the activation process and the solid electrolyte interface (SEI)‐
layer formation on the anode and cathode surface. This procedure facilitates 
charge/discharge behavior, affecting battery performance, life and safety.
From a practical point of view
In a production line the abovementioned processes need to be combined to 
enable the production of batteries. The approach of combining different tech-
nologies for the application of layers with varying parameters, such as thick-
ness or density, is common in a wide spectrum of industries but is exceptional 
in the printing industry.
Setting up a production line accordingly means the careful optimization of 
various characteristics such as footprint, productivity, yield, operating time 
and cost of operation. The integration of all necessary process steps is a straight

53
approach in minimizing the required footprint, material handling times, and, 
eventually, equipment costs.
However, it must be taken into account that each of the process steps has 
different productivity, meaning optimal web speed. This is mainly associated 
with the required length of the dryer, which can be adapted for each process 
step to a target web speed. Nonetheless, most printing processes have a speed 
window optimal for the application of the ink/paste, due to its physical proper-
ties. It can thus be sensible to chain only a few processes and run the fastest 
and/or slowest processes in dedicated standalone tools when optimizing the 
production costs in relation to the targeted annual production of batteries.
Because printed batteries are not yet fully commercialized, it is also recom-
mended to follow the idea of lab‐to‐fab by scaling production with the devel-
opment of the battery. When setting up a pilot line it can be beneficial to start 
with one production tool incorporating all process technologies, and later on, 
e.g. upon arrival of a certain milestone, extend production capacities by either 
purchasing new equipment or upgrading existing equipment.
Furthermore, it must be taken into account that the functional materials 
for batteries will improve over time and likely substitute existing materials. 
However, it may be that the improved materials show other properties, thus 
requiring a different printing technology for the application. In these cases it is 
of the utmost importance that the process chain can be extended by the 
required process step or that substitution of the now superfluous process tech-
nologies can take place.
2.3.10  Printing of Layers
The layers of the different components (current collectors, anode and cathode 
electrodes and separators) in printed batteries can be produced by different 
printing techniques using suitable inks with required viscosity. Table 2.4 shows 
different printing techniques reported in the literature for manufacturing spe-
cific components of printed batteries. The references shown in Table 2.4 for 
each printing technique are representative.
The current collector layers are based on conductive inks based on carbona-
ceous fillers such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) and carbon nanofibers (CNF), 
metallic inks of silver, zinc or copper metals deposited on flexible substrates 
and conductive fabrics [26].
The most frequently printed components of printed batteries are the elec-
trodes, which have been printed using different active materials. Independently 
of the active material, the literature shows that it is possible to produce the 
electrodes by different printing techniques [7].
The battery component that requires extra attention and development is 
the  separator, as it must show high ionic conductivity and high thermal 
and  mechanical stability [7]. For printed batteries, the separator layer is

54
typically a polymer gel electrolyte with different constituents, including salts or 
ionic liquids [7].
More details about the printing layers for the different components are pre-
sented in the following chapters of this book.
2.4  ­Conclusions
Numerous printing techniques have been established. Some, such as screen 
printing or coating technologies, are ideal for the deposition of homogenous 
functional layers of defined layer thickness in large areas. These are technolo-
gies that work on web‐based substrates enabling large area throughput.
When dealing with small and sophisticated batteries, digital printing tech-
nologies such as dispensing or inkjet printing are appropriate technologies that 
may limit the particle sizes contained in the processed inks.

3.1  ­Introduction
Lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) have been used in many consumer products and 
electric vehicles in recent years. Mixing equipment and mixing processes of 
the electrode production will directly affect the manufacturing process and 
performance of batteries. Lithium‐ion batteries produced from electrodes with 
well‐dispersed particle distribution have been shown to have significantly 
improved electrochemical performance and battery life [1–12].The electrode 
slurry is a solid–liquid mixture comprising active materials, conductive parti-
cles, polymer binder and solvent medium. It has a high solid content which 
consists of nano‐ and micron‐sized particles, and is difficult to disperse in a 
highly viscous medium. Hence, good mixing of various components in an elec-
trode slurry is an essential processing step in achieving a high quality product. 
Since the slurry is black and opaque, particle distribution is difficult to observe 
with confidence using optical devices. An indirect method of assessing the 
stability and uniformity of the electrode slurry is by rheological means. A good 
electrode slurry must have the following characteristics: low sedimentation 
and agglomeration during storage; uniform particle distribution in the slurry 
and good fluidity to facilitate slurry coating; and high viscosity to prevent sedi-
mentation of particles and binder migration during drying.
The main focus of this chapter is the rheological behavior of lithium‐ion 
electrode slurries, as it is an important processing parameter in every stage of 
the electrode manufacturing process. It starts by discussing the formulation

and preparation of the slurries, followed by coating of slurries to produce wet 
electrode films and finally drying of electrodes. The rheological behavior of 
slurry and its influence on various processing stages are discussed here.
3.2  ­Slurry Formulation
The first step of the lithium‐ion battery electrode manufacturing process is 
mixing the slurry. Electrode slurry is a multi‐component, complex solid–liquid 
mixture which consists of active materials, conductive particles, polymer 
binder and solvent medium. The slurry is coated onto a metal current collector 
substrate and dried to make the electrode layer.
Table 3.1 summarizes various components commonly used for lithium‐ion 
battery electrodes [1–32]. In slurry formulation, the major ingredients are the 
active materials and the conductive agents. The active material, consisting of 
complex lithium compound, allows the electrochemical reaction to proceed. 
The conductive agent improves the electronic conductivity and increases elec-
tricity transfer in the electrode. The most commonly used active materials in 
lithium batteries for the cathode are LiCoO2, LiNiO2, LiMn2O4, LiFePO4, and 
LiNixMyCo1‐x‐yO2; and for the anode are graphite and Si‐C. The solid contents 
of both active materials are over 70wt% [1–32].
Electrode slurries can be classified into aqueous and organic systems accord-
ing to the type of solvent used. The solvent is an important component of the 
formulation for controlling the slurry dispersion. Deionized water is normally 
used for the aqueous system and NMP (N‐methyl‐2‐pyrrolidone) for the 
organic‐based system. The solid content and the viscosity of the slurry are 
dependent on the amount of solvent added.

The Influence of Slurry Rheology on Lithium‐ion Electrode Processing
65
A polymeric thickener such as CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) may be 
required for the aqueous‐based slurry system in order to increase the slurry 
viscosity and to minimize particle sedimentation. The most commonly used 
binder for electrode slurry is SBR (styrene‐butadiene rubber) for aqueous and 
PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) for organic systems. The binder provides the 
adhesion strength between particle/particle and particle/current collector. The 
content of the binder in the electrode slurry is between 1 and 10wt%. A sum-
mary of the main ingredients of electrode slurry is given in Table 3.1.
3.3  ­Rheological Characteristics of Electrode Slurry
Rheological characterization of electrode slurry is essential at various stages of 
battery processing. For suspensions, the most important rheological property 
in lithium electrode processing is the viscosity. It directly influences the behav-
ior of the slurry formulation during mixing, production of wet electrode 
through coating and subsequent drying. Other rheological properties such as 
viscoelasticity and yield stress are related to the molecular and internal struc-
ture of the electrode. Viscosity is used as a means of determining the uniform-
ity of particle dispersion during slurry formulation, the stability of the wet film 
during coating, and the extent of solvent evaporation during drying. In general, 
electrode slurry is a non‐Newtonian complex mixture which contains a large 
number of particles of various sizes and shapes, polymeric binder and water or 
organic solvent with thickener. The three main rheological characteristics of 
electrode slurries in terms of shear‐viscosity, viscoelasticity, and yield stress 
and their roles at various stages of processing are briefly discussed here.
3.3.1  Viscosity and Shear‐Thinning
Viscosity is an important physical property of a fluid, which determines the 
resistance to flow and fluid deformation, and is defined as the ratio of shear stress 
over shear rate. In a solid–liquid suspension, it is closely related to the solid con-
centration of the mixture. For a non‐interactive dilute suspension, the suspen-
sion viscosity η usually follows the well‐known Einstein equation [33, 34]:
	
s 1
2 5.
	
(1)
where ηs is the liquid viscosity, and ψ the particle volume fraction. The main 
assumptions of the Einstein equation are: the suspension contains uniform‐
size, zero‐charge, hard spherical particles; there are no interactive forces 
between particles; and the suspension is dilute with a very‐low‐volume 
­fraction (ψ < 0.01) and behaves as a Newtonian fluid. For non‐dilute systems, 
the above equation has been modified to include the higher‐order volume

fraction terms to account for the influence of the surrounding particles, as

where ηr is relative viscosity.
Equations (1) and (2) are not applicable for highly interactive suspensions 
such as lithium‐ion electrode slurries. For these suspensions, the viscosity is 
also dependent on the Brownian and hydrodynamic forces; particle sizes and 
shapes; maximum solids packing fraction; particle charges; particle/particle 
and particle/polymer interactions. Generally, they exhibit non‐Newtonian 
behavior. In addition to the shear‐dependent viscosity, the slurry may also 
exhibit time‐dependency, yield stress, and viscoelasticity. Although there are 
numerous theoretical or semi‐theoretical constitutive equations available in the 
literature to describe the non‐linear behavior of interactive concentrated sus-
pensions, these are either too complex for practical usage or limited to a specific 
system only. Hence, experimental measurements of rheological properties have 
been considered as a reliable tool for interactive complex slurry characteriza-
tion. Interested readers can refer to textbooks devoted to this field [33, 34].
Most lithium‐ion electrode slurries exhibit a shear‐thinning behavior where 
the shear‐viscosity reduces with increasing shear rate [16, 22, 35, 36]. This char-
acteristic is more pronounced for higher‐solid‐content slurries [37]. At higher 
shear rates, the strong shear force tends to destroy the network structure, forc-
ing the particles to realign themselves in a more orderly structure parallel to the 
shear field, causing the viscosity to decrease and reach a Newtonian plateau at 
high shear rates [16, 38]. Typical viscosity/shear rate behavior of lithium‐ion 
electrode slurry showing different concentrations of conductive agent (carbon 
black) in binder solution (PVDF/NMP solvent) is shown in Figure 3.1. At low 
carbon black concentration (0.25wt%), the shear‐viscosity is nearly constant, 
independent of shear rate, and the slurry can be considered a Newtonian slurry. 
The shear‐thinning behavior becomes more obvious as the particle concentra-
tion increases. The increase in viscosity at very low shear rate is nearly a hun-
dred‐fold when the solid concentration increases from 0.25 to 4.0wt%, although 
not as much in the high shear rate region due to the effect of shear‐thinning. 
This non‐Newtonian characteristic is advantageous in electrode processing 
since a low viscosity slurry is required for good coating at high shear rate condi-
tions, and a high viscosity medium can prevent or minimize particle sedimenta-
tion when the slurry is at rest or during drying [16].
3.3.2  Viscoelasticity
From a fluid mechanics point of view, viscoelasticity is important only in 
transient, accelerated or decelerated flows, and has no direct impact under 
steady flow conditions. However, this property is closely related to the

67
molecular or internal structure of the fluid or suspension. Rheological meas-
urements of viscoelasticity are normally carried out under oscillatory shear 
mode where the storage and loss moduli, G′ and Gʺ, are reported as a func-
tion of frequency or strain rate. Typically, many polymer melts, polymer 
solutions and solid/liquid suspensions exhibit a G′ greater than Gʺ at low 
frequencies until a critical frequency or strain rate is reached, when a cross‐
over occurs beyond which Gʺ > G′. At low strain rate, the external force 
exerted on the material is insufficient to cause any disruption of the material’s 
internal structure. The material behaves like an elastic solid. When the exter-
nal force is strong enough to break the structure, the material flows like a 
viscous liquid. Solid/liquid suspensions exhibiting these characteristics are 
sometimes classified as “viscoplastic” materials. The corresponding stress 
at the critical strain has been shown to be related to the yield stress of the 
material [39, 40].
Figure 3.2 represents typical viscoelastic behavior of a lithium‐ion electrode 
slurry measured at room temperature, where G′ and Gʺ are presented as a 
function of frequency [13–25]. Over the measured range of frequency (0.1 to 
200 rad/s), the storage modulus is greater than the loss modulus, suggesting 
that the slurry is behaving like a solid material. Although there are no high 
frequency data reported due to instrument limitations, the figures appear to 
indicate that the transition occurs at a frequency of around 300 rad/s. The 
material will flow like a liquid at frequencies above this critical value.

3.3.3  Yield Stress
Yield stress is an inherent material property of many high solid content suspen-
sions or slurries, as in the case of electrode slurries. When the applied stress is 
less than the yield stress, the slurry will not deform and will appear like a solid. 
However, when the yield stress is exceeded, the slurry will behave like a fluid, 
either a Newtonian or a pseudo‐plastic fluid [39]. There are many methods 
in  the literature for yield stress determination, mostly presented in either 
­constant‐stress steady or dynamic mode [39, 40].
The two simplest rheological models for yield stress of materials are:
Bingham model

Herchel‐Bulkley model

(4)
where τ is the shear force, γ is the shear rate, τ0 is the yield stress, μ is the 
­apparent viscosity, κ is the consistency coefficient, and n is the power law 
index. In the absence of yield stress, the Bingham model becomes the 
Newtonian model, and the Herchel‐Bulkley model becomes the common 
pseudo‐plastic power law model.

The Influence of Slurry Rheology on Lithium‐ion Electrode Processing
69
The presence of yield stress in electrode slurry may influence the material 
behavior during processing. In the preparation of slurry, a dead zone or a solid 
plug may be created inside the mixer. Hence, the mixer must be designed in 
such a way that during mixing, all components in the mixture are subjected to 
high shear everywhere within the mixer to ensure thorough mixing. The 
impact of yield stress on the coating process is relatively small since the shear 
stress or shear rate is sufficiently high during the usual coating operation of wet 
electrode film. However, during drying of wet film, the evaporation of solvent 
causes the solid content to increase, resulting in a higher yield stress. A higher 
yield stress is considered to be advantageous as it can hinder or minimize 
particle sedimentation under gravity.
3.4  ­Effects of Rheology on Electrode Processing
3.4.1  Composition of Electrode Slurry
Porcheret et al. [13] compared the rheological behavior of an LiFePO4 cathode 
using organic and aqueous binder/solvent systems. The organic binder solu-
tion was PVDF in NMP, and the aqueous binder solution was either CMC or 
HPMC thickener in water. It was found that at the same viscosity level, the 
organic PVDF binder system exhibited a large yield stress, followed by the 
aqueous CMC system, while the HPMC system showed no yield stress phe-
nomenon. Similar behavior was observed from the dynamic moduli measure-
ments in which G′ was greater than Gʺ for the PVDF and CMC systems, but the 
opposite trend was seen for the HPMC system. This was consistent with the 
yield stress results where the former two slurries were more solid‐like and the 
latter was more liquid‐like when subjected to lower strain motion. As indicated 
by the simulation results presented by Zhu et al. [30], particle aggregation and 
distribution in the electrode slurry was strongly dependent on the quantities 
and sizes of active material and conductive agent added. Ligneel et al. [14] 
also found that increasing solid content in the slurry would increase the yield 
stress, which would affect solvent evaporation and binder migration during the 
drying process.
Cho et al. [22] studied the effect of slurry storage time by comparing the 
thixotropic (time‐dependent) characteristics of two cathode slurries, one rest-
ing for a day and the other for seven days after formulation. It was found that 
both steady shear and dynamic viscosities were higher for the one‐day sample 
than for the seven‐day sample. The slurry impedance was also found to increase 
continuously over a three‐day period.
In order to overcome the settling issue of the active material in the aqueous 
system, Bitsch et al. [24] added octanol to the mixture to increase the slurry 
viscosity at stationary state. However, with the effect of shear‐thinning, it had

no direct impact on the coating process as the slurry was moving at relatively 
high shear rate conditions.
Table 3.2 is a summary of the rheological properties of lithium‐ion electrodes 
reported by various researchers.
3.4.2  Electrode Slurry Preparation
3.4.2.1  Mixing Methods
The homogeneity of electrode slurry is critical in the production of wet elec-
trode film through coating and drying processes, and overall battery perfor-
mance. In the mixing process, the sequence of adding various electrode 
components and the mixing method affects the slurry rheology and the degree 
of particle dispersion in the mixture. There are many mixing sequences pro-
posed in the literature [15–17, 19, 20, 26–30, 32]. In general, most suggested 
mixing methods involved three steps. The initial step was the mixing of active 
material and conductive agent, both in powder form, to establish a good con-
ductive network [33, 34]. This was followed by blending in the pre‐mixed 
binder solution to provide good adhesion between particle/particle and parti-
cle/current collector. Finally, solvent and/or dispersant was added to the mix-
ture to adjust the slurry viscosity. During the addition of electrode ingredients, 
the mixture must be continuously mixed to ensure good dispersion.
In order to improve the dispersion of the slurry, the addition of solvent in 
multiple stages was recommended [15–17, 20]. Initially, small quantities of 
solvent were added sequentially to the solid mixture until it reached the maxi-
mum packing fraction. Prior to the coating of the slurry, an additional amount 
of solvent and a small quantity of dispersant (surfactant) were added to lower 
the slurry viscosity to a level suitable for coating of wet film.
A brief review of some mixing methods [15–17, 19, 20, 26–30, 32], the choice 
of dispersants [13, 21, 23, 24, 31], and their effects on the battery manufactur-
ing processes and performance are briefly discussed here.
Kim et al. [15] compared the dispersion of the slurry using four different 
electrode component mixing sequences and the effect on the battery perfor-
mance. Firstly, the conductive additive was mixed thoroughly with solvent 
and binder, followed by the addition of the active material. Secondly, the 
order of adding the solid ingredients, active material and conductive agent, 
was reversed. Thirdly, all ingredients were mixed together at once. The final 
method was to pre‐mix the two solid components in dry state, blend in the 
binder and solvent in sequence, and then vigorously stir the mixture until 
complete dispersion was achieved. The four slurries exhibited different 
steady shear‐viscosity behavior, with the one produced by the last method 
yielding the lowest viscosity level under the same shear conditions. This 
indicated that the dispersion of this slurry was better than that of the other 
three slurries. Subsequent battery test on a battery plate produced from this

slurry also resulted in a more stable battery discharge capacity and cycle‐life 
characteristics.
Lee et al. [16] compared the rheology of two cathode slurries produced by 
different mixing methods. The first method was to thoroughly mix the liquid 
phase (PVDF binder and NMP solvent) and the solid phase (active material 
LiCoO2 and conductive carbon powder) separately, and then combine the two 
phases. The second method was to prepare a solution of PVDF containing only 
2/5 of the solvent (NMP), then mix this with the solid mixture, followed by the 
addition of the remaining solvent in equal portions in three successive inter-
vals with continued stirring. The slurry using the multi‐stage addition of sol-
vent exhibited a lower steady shear‐viscosity, and higher dynamic loss modulus 
G″ than storage modulus G′ The battery made from this cathode slurry also 
had a better C‐rate discharge characteristic.
Li et al. [17] studied the battery quality produced from aqueous electrodes 
with two mixing methods. The binder used was SBR (styrene‐butadiene rub-
ber) and the thickening solution was SCMC (sodium carboxymethyl cellu-
lose) in water. The first method was to continuously mix together the 
thickener with the active material (LiFePO4) and the conductive additive 
(KS‐6 graphite and carbon black) for one day. The binder (SBR) was then 
added and stirred for an additional three days. The second method was to 
pre‐mix the binder and thickeners first, then mix with the active material and 
conductive additive, and continuously stir the mixture for four days. A lower 
slurry viscosity was obtained using the first mixing method, indicating better 
particle dispersion in the slurry. The SEM analysis also revealed significant 
particle aggregation on the surface of the electrode produced from the slurry 
mixed by the second method. Subsequent battery performance test also indi-
cated that the battery fabricated from slurry using the multi‐step mixing 
method (the first method) had a better high C‐rate and good charge/dis-
charge cycle characteristics.
3.4.2.2  Mixing Devices
The ball mill mixer is one of the most commonly used devices for mixing 
electrode slurries. However, the energy consumption for this type of mixer is 
large and it is impractical for large‐scale production, although it has been 
industrially accepted as a reference mixer for electrode slurry preparation 
[37]. Other types of mixers such as planetary mixers, high speed mixers, and 
homogenizers have been used in industry for electrode slurry mixing [41, 42]. 
A necessary condition for a good mixer is to ensure that all particles every-
where in the container must be in constant motion during mixing. This 
can only be achieved with a mixer that can generate a uniform flow field, 
to  the greatest extent possible, in all directions. Aiming to satisfy this 
­condition in the shortest possible mixing time, Liu et al. [20] recently devel-
oped a new laboratory‐scale, 3‐dimensional cylindrical mixer, which enabled 

Printed Batteries
74
simultaneous mixing in r, θ, and z directions, and was successfully used for 
mixing lithium‐ion cathode slurries.
Figure 3.3 shows comparison of the shear‐viscosity of three cathode slurries 
mixed in different devices. A significant shear‐thinning behavior was observed 
for the slurry mixed in a Rushton turbine mixer for two hours and 40 minutes, 
as indicated by the upper curve. The viscosity continued to drop with increas-
ing shear rate over a long period of time, implying that complete mixing had 
not been achieved. The other two viscosity curves, obtained from the ball mill 
and the 3D mixers, appeared to approach a relatively constant Newtonian vis-
cosity at a lower shear rate, suggesting complete particle dispersion. However, 
the mixing times for these two mixers were significantly different. It took three 
days of continuous mixing in the ball mill as compared to an hour in the 3D 
mixer to achieve similar results. Electrical performance test of the battery 
made with the slurry prepared in multiple stages in the 3D mixer also yielded 
good battery characteristics and cycle life.
In order to further facilitate good dispersion of particles during mixing, a 
small amount of dispersant may be added to the mixture. Zhang et al. [31] 
added a small amount of surfactant (Triton X‐100) into an LiFePO4 electrode, 
and compared the electrochemical properties of this electrode with those of an 
electrode without added surfactant. The results showed that there was a sub-
stantial improvement in electrochemical properties for battery capacity and 
cycle life of the electrode with added surfactant.

3.4.3  Electrode Coating
In the coating and printing industries, solutions with a wide range of viscosity 
are encountered. For example, the viscosity could be as low as 1 mPa‐s in gra-
vure and injection printings and in spray coating, and as high as 50,000 mPa‐s 
in offset and screen printings. Depending on the application, the slot‐die coat-
ing has been shown to be a more versatile coating process. It could handle coat-
ing liquid/suspension with a wide range of viscosity. In the production of battery 
electrode film using the slot‐die coating process, the shear‐viscosity has a strong 
influence on the film stability, coating uniformity and operating coating window 
[43–46]. Usually when a solid–liquid slurry contains polymer, the viscosity and 
surface tension would be higher due to the particle/polymer interaction, which 
would influence the operating window in the slot‐die coating [47]. In addition 
to shear‐thinning, yield stress could also be present for coating of the high solid 
content electrode slurry. This would affect the velocity distribution inside the 
slot‐die, and might cause an uneven film thickness or film splitting [48]. Multi‐
layered simultaneous slot‐die coating was recently accepted as a new technol-
ogy for multifunctional electrode production. In simultaneous two‐layer coating 
of electrodes, it was necessary to have two slurries with similar rheological 
properties to ensure uniform coating. The thickness ratio of the upper/lower 
layer was an important parameter affecting the minimum film thickness, and 
was primarily controlled by the viscosities of the two coating slurries [49–55].
3.4.4  Electrode Drying
Following the production of wet electrode film by coating or other methods, 
the film must be dried, usually in a dryer, for solvent evaporation and curing. 
The final internal structure of electrode would be established after drying. 
Although there is no external shear or extensional flow directly applied to the 
wet film as it moves through the dryer, rheology could still play an important 
role in determining the internal structure of the film. The solid content of the 
wet film, particle distribution and conduction network configuration would 
change during drying due to solvent evaporation together with the migration 
of binder toward the exposed heated surface [56–62]. Particle sedimentation 
under gravity could also occur. The presence of yield stress would prevent this 
phenomenon from happening or minimize it. The viscosity of the liquid in the 
porous medium structure would affect the movement of solvent and binder 
due to its effects on mass diffusion and capillary driving forces. The change in 
the electrode internal structure could be detected from the behavior of the 
dynamic moduli obtained [63].
Finally, the rheological behavior of electrode slurry would be sensitive to 
­temperature changes. In industrial applications, the slurry temperature during 
coating is normally controlled within the range 35–65°C, and drying at around 

Printed Batteries
76
80–150o C. These temperature ranges were shown to make coating and drying of 
electrode slurries more efficient due to their effects on the slurry rheology [64].
3.5  ­Conclusion
Lithium‐ion battery slurry is a very complex mixture consisting of solvent, 
binder, active material and conductive additive. It generally behaves as a non‐
Newtonian, viscoplastic material. It exhibits various rheological characteristics 
including shear‐thinning viscosity, viscoelasticity, yield stress and time‐
dependency. The electrochemical performance of the battery depends strongly 
on the manufacturing process of the electrodes. Understanding slurry rheol-
ogy is essential as it influences the entire electrode manufacturing process, 
from the composition of the electrode components, including chemicals used, 
particle size and shape, to the preparation of the slurry, involving the mixing 
procedure and selection of appropriate mixers, to the production of wet film by 
coating, and finally the drying and curing of wet electrodes.

The huge growth of the printed‐microelectronics industry has resulted in many 
efforts being devoted to the development of printable power sources. Printing 
of power sources has become a necessity for portable autonomous devices, 
RFID cards, wearable electronics and IoT (Internet of Things) applications [1]. 
Printing or painting enables the design and integration of batteries on various 
substrates and geometries including curved and flexible surfaces with confined 
spaces. Several attempts have been made to produce primary and secondary 
thin‐film batteries utilizing printing techniques exclusively. These technologies 
are still at an early stage, and most currently printed batteries exploit printed 
electrodes sandwiched with self‐standing polymer membranes, produced by 
conventional extrusion, papermaking techniques, stretching, evaporation, and 
sintering methods followed by soaking in aqueous or nonaqueous liquid elec-
trolytes. Printing of solid polymer and gel electrolytes (GPE) remains a bottle-
neck in the all‐printed batteries and the literature is scarce. In this short 
communication, an attempt has been made to address the issue of polymer 
electrolyte printing, to compare the electrochemical performance of conven-
tional bulk batteries and printed batteries with polymer electrolytes and to pro-
pose avenues of investigation and development in this rapidly growing field.
4.1  ­Electrolytes for Conventional Batteries
Conventional batteries are fabricated by superposition of positive and negative 
electrodes coated on current collectors with an intermediate layer of a separa-
tor or polymer electrolyte. The separators (ion‐conducting membranes) are

produced as free‐standing films. Ion‐conducting membranes play a key role in 
electrochemical energy‐storage devices. Good battery performance necessi-
tates sufficiently high ionic conductivity in the bulk electrolyte, as well as a 
supply of cations to both cathode/electrolyte and anode/electrolyte interfaces 
to sustain fast charge–discharge processes [2]. Ion transport can take place 
through intrinsic conduction paths of the membrane or via impregnated liquid 
electrolyte. Separator/electrolyte compositions must be tuned to conduct ions 
easily, while simultaneously forming safe, impenetrable and electronically 
insulating barrier layers. In order to minimize the internal impedance of the 
battery, the separator should follow the contours of the relatively rough surface 
of the electrode materials. In addition, in rechargeable batteries the mem-
branes/electrolytes must have the high mechanical properties needed to with-
stand the changes in the electrode volumes during the operation of the cell.
For aqueous‐electrolyte batteries (nickel–cadmium, nickel–metal hydride, 
manganese‐dioxide, zinc‐silver oxide, zinc‐air, zinc‐mercuric oxide), with impreg-
nated NaOH‐ or KOH‐based alkaline electrolytes, the typically used materials for 
separators are: polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyamide (nylon), polypropylene (PP), 
regenerated cellulose (‘cellophane’), irradiated polyethylene, microporous poly-
propylene pretreated to increase hydrophilicity. For lead‐acid or carbon‐lead‐acid 
cells, the materials for separators are cellulose, polyvinyl chloride, organic rubber, 
polyolefin, glass, synthetic pulp and polyethylene‐silica composite.
4.1.1  Polymer/Gel Electrolytes for Aqueous Batteries
In the construction of aqueous‐electrolyte‐based rechargeable batteries, there 
is a major advantage in using a solid or gel electrolyte instead of a liquid elec-
trolyte, in terms of reliability, safety, easy design and processability. However, 
there have been only a few reports of a solid or gel electrolyte with high ionic 
conductivity for use in aqueous‐electrolyte‐based batteries. For example, in the 
zinc/carbon battery (Leclanché), a paper separator coated with gelling agent 
such as methylcellulose is used, which results in a gelled alkaline electrolyte 
absorbed into the paper separator.
The valve‐regulated lead‐acid battery (VRLA) is often referred to as a sealed 
and/or maintenance‐free lead‐acid battery. It differs from the conventional 
flooded lead‐acid battery in containing only a limited amount of electrolyte 
(“starved” electrolyte) absorbed in a separator or immobilized in a gel. The 
electrolyte is commonly immobilized by two methods. In the first, a highly 
porous absorbing mat, fabricated from microglass fibers, is partially filled with 
electrolyte, and acts as the separator/electrolyte reservoir. This is referred as 
“absorbed electrolyte”. In the second, referred to as the gelled‐electrolyte 
method, fumed silica is added to aqueous acid electrolyte, causing it to harden 
into a gel. The immobilization of the electrolyte allows the battery to operate in 
different orientations without spillage [3].

4.1.2  Electrolytes for Lithium‐ion Batteries
The high energy and power requirements of printed batteries suitable for diverse 
applications is one reason why a lithium‐ion technology should be preferred over 
other available types of battery. The electrolytes for lithium or lithium‐ion bat-
teries are based on nonvolatile, thermally and electrochemically stable aprotic 
solvents. The conductivity of the electrolyte should be at least 3 mS · cm−1 to 
make it practical. The most widely used salts are lithium hexafluorophosphate 
(LiPF6) and lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF4) [4]. In addition, a wide variety of 
alternative solvents as well as additives have been proposed, mainly aiming to 
improve the safety and compatibility of the electrolytes with high‐voltage cath-
odes. These include groups of co‐solvents with fluorinated alkyl carbonates, 
which enhance both electrode passivation and thermal stability, and non‐
flammable components such as organophosphorus compounds [5].
Currently developed high‐voltage (4.3 V) cathode materials are beyond the 
voltage window of typical carbonate‐based electrolytes; thus the organic elec-
trolyte undergoes apparently continuous oxidative decomposition during 
cycling and forms non‐passivating solid‐electrolyte‐interphase (SEI) films on 
electrodes. Some examples of additives for electrochemically stable high‐volt-
age electrolytes are biphenyl and other aromatic molecules such as propane-
sultone, butanesultone, etc.
In recent years, ionic liquids (ILs) as electrolyte additives or solvents, gel, 
hybrid, solid‐polymer and ceramic electrolytes have begun to progressively 
replace electrolytes based on organic solvents, mainly with the purpose of 
improving the safety and compatibility of the electrolytes with high‐voltage 
cathodes. ILs are characterized by unique properties, such as non‐flammabil-
ity; negligible vapor pressure; remarkable ionic conductivity; high thermal, 
chemical, and electrochemical stabilities; low heat capacity; and ability to dis-
solve inorganic (including lithium salts), organic, and polymeric materials. 
Viable lithium‐battery ILs are formed by alkyl imidazolium, saturated alkyl 
quaternary ammonium cyclic cations (pyrrolidinium, piperidinium) or acyclic 
(tetra alkyl ammonium) cations, in combination with hydrophobic perfluoro-
alkyl sulfonyl imide anions [4].
Gel electrolytes for lithium‐ion batteries are composed of a polymer host, 
solvent and lithium salt. Interacting strongly in liquid organic solutions, poly-
mers generally form chemically stable gel electrolytes [4]. Poly(vinylidenefluoride) 
(PVDF)‐based polymer electrolytes are the most common lithium‐ion gel elec-
trolytes. Because of the strongly electron‐withdrawing functional group (‐C‐F), 
PVDF can assist in greater ionization of lithium salts, thus providing a high 
concentration of charge carriers. Different approaches with the aim of 
decreasing the crystallinity of the PVDF matrix, and improving the mechanical 
properties and interfacial stability include: (1) use of branched PVDF‐HFP or 
PVDF–TrFE copolymers rather than linear PVDF monomers, (2) incorporation

of nanometric fillers such as BaTiO3, Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2 and (3) addition of 
different polymeric components to obtain blend‐polymer hosts [4]. The first 
commercial GPE Li‐ion cell was based on PVDF‐hexafluoropropylene (HFP) 
copolymer electrolyte [6]. The conductivities of blend‐polymer systems are 
between 0.98 and 4.36 mS · cm−1 at 20 °C. The addition of poly(methyl meth-
acrylate) (PMMA) decreases the crystallinity and increases the pore size, poros-
ity, electrolyte uptake and ionic conductivity of PMMA‐PVDF gel‐polymer 
electrolyte [7]. Prasanth et al. [8] reported a polymer blend of PAN/PMMA/
polystyrene (PS) electrolyte for lithium‐ion batteries which have thermal stabil-
ity up to 295 ± 5 °C and ionic conductivity of about 4 mS · cm−1.
Polymers, such as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), which strongly interact with 
solvent, tend to form very stable gels with conventional organic electrolytes, 
but these are characterized by very poor mechanical properties. Gel‐polymer 
electrolytes based on high‐molecular‐weight PEO are sticky, highly viscous 
fluids with ionic conductivity above 0.1 mS · cm−1. In order to obtain the 
best compromise between high conductivity, homogeneity and dimensional 
stability, Choi et  al. [9] proposed a hybrid solid electrolyte consisting of 
PEO, LiClO4, a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC), γ‐butyrolactone (BL) and 
poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN). The highest room‐temperature conductivity of 
2 mS · cm−1 is found for a hybrid film of 31PEO–9LiClO4 –50EC/BL–10PAN. 
This film has a conductivity similar to that of PAN‐based gel electrolytes, but 
with better dimensional stability.
Sony’s laminate‐type lithium‐ion batteries exploit hybrid‐polymer‐gel tech-
nology. The liquid organic electrolyte is locked within the polymer and kept 
in  a semi‐solid state. The replacement of the liquid electrolyte by a semi‐
solid  electrolyte results in more flexible battery shape, prolonged cycle life 
(1000 cycles with 90% high‐power capability after a year), higher energy den-
sity due to tighter package, and greater safety, less swelling and no leakage as 
compared to traditional lithium‐ion batteries [10].
Solid inorganic ceramic and polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have been inten-
sively studied as safe electrolytes for application in solvent‐free lithium‐ion 
rechargeable batteries. This is mainly motivated by their advantages, such as 
flame‐resistance and flexibility. Using solid instead of liquid electrolytes in bat-
teries simplifies encapsulation of battery components and hence increases 
shelf life and the range of operating temperatures [11]. Inorganic ceramics and 
organic polymers used for solid electrolytes in lithium‐ion batteries differ in 
their mechanical properties. The high elastic moduli of ceramics make them 
more suitable for rigid‐battery designs as in, for example, thin‐film‐based 
devices. Conversely, the low elastic moduli of polymers are useful for flexible 
battery designs. Conventional SPEs are prepared by dissolving a lithium salt in 
a polymer matrix, which, in some cases, also contains plasticizers and ceramic 
fillers. The polymer matrix must contain a Lewis base (e.g. one containing an 
ethylene oxide unit, –OCH2CH2–) to solvate the lithium salt. Over the past

30 years, great efforts have been made to develop polymer matrices with various 
structures for improving ambient‐temperature ionic conductivity; however, 
up to now, progress on all‐solid‐state polymer electrolyte systems has been 
relatively slow. In fact, the lithium‐ion polymer battery (abbreviated variously 
as LiPo, LIP, Li‐poly, among others), is a rechargeable battery of lithium‐ion 
technology in a flexible pouch format. The electrolyte used in this type of bat-
tery is of the gel type. Electrochemical cells with solid‐polymer electrolytes 
have not reached full commercialization, and are still a topic of research [12].
Solid ceramic electrolytes have been employed primarily in thin‐film 
­batteries. One of the examples is amorphous material called LiPON (lithium 
phosphorous oxynitride), which is a nonstoichiometric material of lithium, 
phosphorus, nitrogen, and oxygen. This electrolyte has higher voltage stability 
than do organic polymer electrolytes, so the LiPON battery can accommodate 
higher voltage positive materials such as lithiated cobalt oxide or manganese 
oxide. Recently, Kato et al. [13] discovered that lithium superionic conductors 
Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.3 and Li9.6P3S12 showed the highest ionic conductivity (25 
mS · cm−1) reported for lithium‐ion, and high electrochemical stability versus 
lithium metal. Typical thin‐film ceramic‐based electrolyte materials used in 
current commercial variations of thin‐film all‐solid‐state batteries are depos-
ited in vacuum chambers by RF and DC magnetron sputtering and by thermal 
evaporation. In addition, many publications report exploring a variety of physi-
cal (PVD) and chemical vapor‐deposition (CVD) processes, such as pulsed‐
laser deposition, electron cyclotron resonance sputtering, and aerosol spray 
coating [14]. It should be mentioned that ceramic films are rigid and brittle and 
create poor electrode/electrolyte interfacial contacts, leading to high battery 
impedance. The methods of their fabrication are relatively slow and require 
expensive machinery [3]. The THINERGY® MEC220 battery, produced by 
Infinite Power Solutions®, is a solid‐state, rechargeable, thin‐film Micro‐Energy 
Cell (MEC). The active materials in the device include a lithium cobalt oxide 
(LiCoO2) cathode and a lithium‐metal anode; LiPON is used as a solid electro-
lyte [15]. While this battery is rechargeable and safe, its volumetric energy 
density (about 20Whl−1) and capacity per footprint (about 0.08mAh.cm−2) are 
lower by one order of magnitude than those of commercial lithium‐ion batter-
ies with liquid organic electrolytes.
4.2  ­Electrolytes for Printed Batteries
Currently, most printed batteries employ printed current collectors and printed 
electrodes sandwiching different membranes impregnated with liquid electro-
lytes [1, 16–19]. As in the conventional battery, high ionic conductivity via 
liquid‐soaked membrane and compatibility with electrode materials are 
the essential properties for enabling high performance of the printed battery. 

Polymer Electrolytes for Printed Batteries
85
The membrane/electrolyte should be mechanically strong and rigid enough to 
sustain any mechanical stress, shock or tear. In addition, it should have suffi-
cient flexibility to be able to bend or fold and conformally cover the electrode 
surface in order to avoid short‐circuiting between layers during application of 
the next layer or during operation of the battery. The membrane should also 
display a certain degree of porosity and be able to take up appropriate amounts 
of liquid electrolyte. The membrane/electrolyte must be adherent to the elec-
trode in order to avoid delamination and maintain the structural integrity of 
the printed battery. Very few publications appear in this field, with quasi‐solid 
polymer gel or hybrid (swollen) membranes the most studied. The approaches 
for preparation of the separator/electrolyte layer by printing methods are still 
under investigation and yet again very few procedures are available in the lit-
erature. Therefore, the major challenge in the fabrication of a completely 
printed battery is the development of electrolyte inks.
Up to now, various coating procedures for electrode materials have been 
developed, most of them relying on solution‐based processing. Direct, inkjet, 
screen or laser printing and stencil brush or spray painting are the most repre-
sentative of this class. Each technique was found to be suitable for a different 
application, classification being primarily according to the process scale at 
which it can be implemented [1]. For example, laser writing is suitable for 
microscale batteries, printing for centimeter‐scale, and painting for meter‐
scale power sources. All these techniques are considered to be applicable for 
the fabrication of electrolytes and are exemplified below.
4.2.1  Screen‐printed Electrolytes
Screen‐printing has been applied mainly to the fabrication of positive and 
negative electrodes for LIBs and supercapacitors. The technique is suitable for 
thin‐film as well as for thick‐film deposition and the lateral resolution is lim-
ited by the pattern mask. Doctor‐blade (DB) and bar coating are techniques 
derived from the screen‐printing approach [1]. DB coating is the most com-
monly used printing technique for depositing battery slurries in the large‐scale 
manufacturing of conventional batteries as well [20]. It is worth mentioning 
that the doctor‐blade coating is a blanket‐coating process, such that it cannot 
be used to pattern inks over substrate as is possible with direct‐writing meth-
ods such as inkjet printing or laser printing.
It is obvious that in order to fabricate a cell using printing technologies, all 
layer materials must be available as printing inks (pastes). The rheology 
requirements of screen‐printing inks (viscosity, shear stress and shear rate) are 
similar to those of the standard battery. The inks for the electrodes are com-
posed of active‐material powder (anodic or cathodic), a polymeric binder, 
ceramic powder (for enhancing the mechanical strength of the film), electri-
cally conductive materials (usually carbon‐based) and an ionic conductive salt. 

Printed Batteries
86
The ink formulation, depending on the required film thickness for each layer 
(anode, cathode), is chosen or developed on the basis of the requirements of 
the amount of deposited active material (required capacity, energy density, 
power density), electrical properties, electrode stability and electrolyte pene-
tration. The viscosity of the ink is one of the parameters that control the film 
thickness. High ink viscosity and low vapor pressure of the solvent will result 
in thick electrodes. All the above‐mentioned requirements are applicable 
to printed polymer electrolytes, in which the major component is dielectric 
polymer material.
Wright et al. [21] created a direct layer‐by‐layer printed zinc‐based second-
ary battery with an ionic‐liquid‐based gel‐polymer electrolyte to power micro‐ 
and meso‐scale devices. The inks for each of the cell components – cathode, 
anode, and electrolytes – are prepared separately. The cathode is composed of 
67% MnO2 and carbon‐based ink (6% acetylene black, 8% PVDF‐HFP). The 
anode is composed of either zinc foil, for half‐printed cells, or Zn (84%) and 
carbon ink (7% acetylene black, 9% PVDF‐HFP) similar to the cathode ink, for 
fully printed cells. The gel‐polymer electrolyte is composed of PVDF‐HFP per-
meated with the ionic liquid 1‐butyl‐3‐methylimidazolium trifluoromethane-
sulfonate ([BMIM][Otf]) and the salt zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate 
(ZnOtf) (67% ZnOtf:[BMIM][Otf], 1:6.5 mass ratio). The fully printed 
cells and half cells were manufactured with the use of stencil printing 
(anode and cathode) and doctor‐blade coating (GPE) [21]. On cycling, 
these layer‐by‐layer printed batteries exhibited significant improvements 
of discharge capacity, cycle life, and internal resistance over cells previously 
mechanically assembled by the researchers. These improvements are in 
large part due to the increased interfacial cohesion between layers, as 
shown in the  scanning‐electron‐microscopy (SEM) images (Figure 4.1), 
afforded by direct layer‐by‐layer printing [21]. The fully printed cells exhib-
ited average discharge capacities of 0.548 mAhcm−2, volumetric energy 
density of 8.20 mWhcm−3, and gravimetric energy density of 2.46 mWhg−2, 
with some cells achieving over 1000 cycles without failure.
4.2.2  Spray‐printed Electrolytes
Spray printing is used to deposit inks with a wide range of viscosities over vari-
ous surfaces. The method is based on an airbrush device, in which a high‐
velocity compressed carrier gas atomizes ink from a reservoir. The brush is 
directed towards the target substrate. There are a number of ways to control 
the thickness of a sprayed layer, which include opening the spray nozzle, and 
varying the pressure of the carrier gas, ink composition, and the number of 
spray passes. Spray deposition can be used to print a complete battery or cer-
tain layers of the battery. Spray printing is attractive for sequentially printing 
multiple inks that share a common solvent one on top of the other. Because of

the quick drying of spray‐deposited inks, multilayer films can be printed with-
out the necessity to wait for a layer to dry before printing the next layer [20].
Fabrication of battery electrodes and electrolytes by spray printing requires 
formulation of component materials into liquid dispersions (paints) which can 
be sequentially coated onto substrates to achieve the multilayer battery configu-
ration. The potential of the fully spray‐printed battery remained unfeasible until 
recently [22–24]. In 2012, Singh et al. [22] reported fabrication of full LIBs con-
sisting of LiCoO2 and Li4Ti5O12 by a spray‐printing process. The most important 
technological achievement of this work was the unique ability to coat the gel‐
polymer electrolyte, as this had been the bottleneck of the print‐ or paint‐based 
battery‐fabrication process [1]. The polymer separator paint was prepared by 

Printed Batteries
88
dispersing a 27:9:4 (by weight) mixture of KynarRex®‐2801, PMMA and fumed 
SiO2 in a binary solvent mixture of acetone and DMF (N,N‐Dimethylformamide). 
KynarRex was used because of its good solubility in low‐boiling‐point solvents 
and electrochemical stability over a wide voltage window [1], while PMMA was 
used to promote adhesion to a variety of substrates. Kynarflex‐PMMA separa-
tors fabricated from paints in acetone had good adhesion, but had a fibrous mor-
phology with very high porosity and excessive electrolyte uptake, which made 
them mechanically unstable. The authors found that by adding DMF to the paint, 
the micro‐porosity and electrolyte uptake could be tailored to make the separa-
tors mechanically robust upon electrolyte addition. This, however, reduced the 
ionic conductivity of the MGE (microporous gel electrolyte) by a factor of four at 
11% DMF content. A further addition of 10% (w/w) fumed SiO2 to the ink helped 
offset this loss in conductivity and gave the best compromise between mechani-
cal stability, porosity and ionic conductivity [22]. The membrane was deposited 
on the previously dried cathode by spraying polymer paint on the surface, which 
had been preheated to 105 °C, the glass‐transition temperature, Tg, of PMMA. 
During spraying it was necessary to deposit the first few coats slowly and allow 
them to dry, in order to create an interfacial adhesion layer. Without this step, the 
separator peeled off the substrate. Subsequent coats of polymer paint were then 
applied up to a final thickness of 200 µm. Full LIB cells were fabricated by sequen-
tially spraying the component paints on the desired surface with the use of an 
airbrush. The paints can be sprayed through a set of masks made according to 
the desired geometry of the device. A cross‐sectional SEM micrograph of a 
spray‐printed Li‐ion cell (Figure 4.2) [22] shows component layers of reasonably 
uniform thickness and well‐formed interfaces.
Connected in parallel, nine full lithium‐ion cells could store total energy of 
about 0.65 Wh, equivalent to a 6 Whm−2 footprint [22, 25] at a thickness of 
approximately 0.5 mm [1]. The capacities of eight out of nine cells fall within 
90% of the targeted capacity of 30 mAh, suggesting good process control over 
a complex device, even with manual spray painting. Further increasing the 
energy density could be achieved by making thicker active layers. The current 
cell retained approximately 90% of its capacity after 60 cycles with a coulombic 
efficiency of above 98% [20, 22]. This performance is still lower than that of 
conventional batteries with the same electrodes (Figure 4.3).
4.2.3  Direct‐write Printed Electrolytes
Direct writing (DW), also known as digital writing or digital printing, denotes 
a group of processes which are used to precisely deposit functional and/or 
structural materials onto a substrate in digitally defined locations. With DW, 
it  is possible to produce precise features from the nm‐ to the mm‐size, 
because of its conformal‐writing capability. The main types of inkjet printing 
processes, which are related to direct‐printing methods, are continuous and 
drop‐on‐demand (DOD). As with other printing methods, the final printed

shape strongly depends on the ink viscosity, which is a function of the molar 
mass of the polymer. The printing height depends on the final dried‐drop 
diameter, which is a function of the polymer concentration [26].
The choice of materials is exceptionally wide, ranging from metals and 
ceramics to polymers and biomaterials. The application of direct‐writing tech-
niques requires the development of ink‐like mixtures of the battery compo-
nents with proper colloidal properties in order to make them compatible with 
the printing machines [27–29]. Slurries used for the inks are typically com-
posed of a polymer, active electrode material and, if necessary, additives. The 
fraction of the solvent in the ink is kept to a minimum in order to prevent sedi-
mentation, and the active‐material particles are ball‐milled to reduce the aver-
age particle size [20]. To achieve homogeneous inks, rigorous mixing sequences 
of mechanical shaking and ultrasonication are implemented [30].
Rechargeable zinc/metal oxide (MnO2) battery utilizing an ionic‐liquid‐gel 
electrolyte, prepared by dispenser printing, is presented in [30–32]. Dispenser 
printing can be used to print inks over areas ranging from 100 mm2 to 1 m2 by 
drawing patterns in the form of repeated lines or drops. Because of the non‐con-
tact nature of dispenser printing, the ink can be printed over uneven surfaces, 
something that is not possible with other roll‐to‐roll printing methods. Reports 
on batteries fabricated with the use of dispenser printing have predominantly 
involved printing the active layers and polymer electrolyte onto glass substrates 
with pre‐patterned current collectors, formed by lithography [20].
PVDF‐HFP copolymer material is commonly used in batteries and superca-
pacitors because of its ability to remain structurally robust while absorbing large 
volumes of electrolytes [30]. The gel electrolyte [30–32] is composed of a 1:1 
mixture of PVDF‐HFP and 0.5 M solution of zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate 
(Zn (CF3SO3)2, ZnTf) salt dissolved in 1‐butyl‐3‐methylimidazolium trifluo-
romethanesulfonate (BMIM + Tf-) ionic liquid. This composition was found to 
have optimal mechanical integrity and ion‐transport properties. The viscosity 
of gel electrolytes is typically an order of magnitude greater than that of neat 
ionic liquids and both show Newtonian behavior with constant viscosities 
within the range of the shear rates applied (0–1 × 104 s−1) (Figure 4.4).
Therefore, the ionic conductivity of the room‐temperature gel (0.37 mS · cm−1) 
is an order of magnitude lower than that of the neat ionic‐liquid‐based electro-
lyte (2.4 mS · cm−1). However, the gel is considered fairly conductive compared 
to dry solid‐polymer PEO‐based electrolyte [33] (0.01 mS · cm−1) and glassy 
LiPON at room temperature electrolytes (<10μS.cm−1) [34]. To fabricate 
thin samples, the PVDF‐HFP‐based gels were printed on glass substrates with 
30‐gauge (150 µm inner diameter) needles, and dried on a hotplate at 60 °C for 
45 minutes. In [31] it was found that the resulting microstructure of the gels is 
scarcely affected by printing parameters such as needle dimension, film dimen-
sions, print speed and substrate material, and more dependent on the gel com-
position and post‐process conditions, such as the drying temperature. The test

cells were printed with 0.25 cm2 footprint areas and total thicknesses of between 
80 and 120 µm. Multiple films were successively deposited to form a stacked 
microbattery configuration. Electrolyte thickness varied from 15 to 30 µm [32]. 
As can be seen from the linear‐sweep voltamogram (Figure 4.5), the electrolytes 
are stable between 0 and 2.7 V with respect to zinc. This potential range is suf-
ficient for the battery operating between 1 V and 2 V [32].
The compatibility of the gel electrolyte with the zinc electrode is critical to 
the battery’s performance. It was found that the interfacial resistance between 
the electrode and the gel electrolyte increases rapidly within the first hours 
after assembly, and is stabilized in 24 hours (Figure 4.6). Cyclic‐voltammetry 
measurements show that the passivation layer does not block the reversible 
dissolution and deposition of zinc. Over many cycles, these reactions occur 
reversibly with similar current densities. Therefore, it can be concluded that 
zinc showed good compatibility with the gel electrolyte, and when cycled 
against a manganese‐dioxide electrode. The 0.25 cm2‐footprint cell exhibiting 
storage capacities of 0.98 mAh/cm2 ran over more than 70 cycles. Energy den-
sity of 1.2 m Whcm−2 was measured [30].
It is rather well established that the corrosive nature of traditional acidic and 
alkaline aqueous electrolytes, and challenges with shape changes at the zinc 
electrode–electrolyte interface have prevented commercial zinc‐based batter-
ies from being used as rechargeable [35]. The development of the gel ionic‐
liquid electrolyte has eliminated this disadvantage.
Thin and flexible Zn/MnO2 batteries printed and laminated on thin paper 
have already been commercialized by several companies (Blue Spark, Power

smart cards, microsensors, functional packaging and media, etc. [36]. Blue 
Spark, Power Paper and Enfucell batteries are carbon/zinc primary printed 
batteries with alkaline or neutral (zinc chloride) aqueous electrolyte.
Recent progress in the high ionic conductivity (10–3 S.cm−1) of zinc polymer 
electrolytes has enabled the production of fully printable cell structures that do 
not use a separator. The polymer electrolyte layer solidifies from solution during 
drying into a self‐supporting film after being deposited directly onto the under-
lying electrode. This approach simplifies the manufacturing process and also 
allows for a mechanically integrated cell stack, as each adjacent layer is bonded 
in a monolithic stack of successive solution‐printed layers. The method enables 
the creation of a cell stack that resists delamination and is robust under flexing, 
as has been shown by dynamic flexibility testing of these printed cells [35].
ZincPoly battery technology leverages cost‐effective, stable and earth‐abundant 
zinc and manganese‐dioxide battery electrodes that have been engineered to be 
printable and compatible with the novel high‐ion‐conductivity solid‐polymer 
electrolyte. Two‐hundred‐cycle rechargeability with less than 10% capacity 
loss was measured in the cell with printed zinc polymer electrolyte at a C/2.5 
discharge rate. This high cycling stability for a secondary zinc battery is thought 
to be due to stable plating of the zinc ions from the electrolyte during recharging, 
since metallic dendrites or mossy deposits are suppressed. Three‐dimensional 
anode‐interface growth can cause electrode short circuits and degrade cell‐
cycling stability. A scalable, large‐area print process has been developed for zinc 
polymer batteries. The process has been optimized with regard to print param-
eters, compositions and film thicknesses to reach target volumetric and areal 
energy densities and capacities [35]. Figure 4.7 from [35] shows continuous high‐
discharge‐rate data and ragone plot from 10 cm2 zinc polymer cells which can be 
used to power a BTLE (Blue Tooth Low Energy) wearable wireless sensor. These 
cells are fabricated with real impedances in the range of 2–5ohms at 1 kHz. In 
terms of capacity, less than 500 micron‐thick batteries based on this technology 
demonstrated capacities of above 5mAhcm−2 when discharged from 1.8 to 1 V.
Table 4.1 compares the capabilities of printed‐zinc‐polymer technology to 
lithium and conventional zinc primary technologies. Thin secondary zinc bat-
teries could be produced at approximately 50–60% of the cost of lithium‐polymer 
cells in the 50–100mWhcm−3 capacity range. The printed‐zinc‐polymer 
technology has been scaled to a production capacity of one thousand cell 
prototypes and is scheduled to be scaled to pilot production in early 2017.
Wright et  al. [18] demonstrate an on‐glass dispenser‐printed lithium‐ion 
battery with solid‐polymer electrolyte. The electrolyte contains LiCF3SO3N 
(LiTFSI) salt with butyl‐methylimidazolium [BMIM]+ and butyl‐methyl pyr-
rolidinium [BMPyrro]+ ionic liquid. These ionic liquids have been shown to 
form solid films or self‐standing gels in a mixture with PVDF, maintaining 
good ionic conductivity. The electrolytes were printed with the use of the

homemade pneumatic printer [18]. The details are as follows: Pyrrolydinium‐
TFSI salts were mixed in 1:1 (w/w) PVDF powder. LiTFSI salt was added after 
formation of a viscous gel. The IL/PVDF/LiTFSI layer was applied on top of the 
anode with a 100 µm stainless‐steel needle. The gel was baked under a heat 
lamp for 10 minutes. By carefully controlling the dispenser pressure (40 to 70 
kPa) the 12 µm–thick layer was obtained. The printed polymer electrolyte 
exhibited electronic insulation, high ionic conductivity (2 × 10–3Scm−1 at 30 °C 
(Figure 4.8)) and mechanical stability [18].

An inkjet‐printed zinc/silver battery has been reported with an energy den-
sity of 3.95mWh.cm−2 [16]. A battery was constructed by submerging a pair 
of  silver inkjet‐printed structures into an aqueous electrolyte of potassium 
hydroxide (KOH) with dissolved zinc oxide (ZnO) powder. The optimal molar-
ity of KOH and the concentration of dissolved ZnO were investigated. In order 
to replace liquid alkaline electrolyte, an alkaline gel electrolyte has been devel-
oped. The electrolyte composition is optimized with respect to polymer 
material (polyethylene oxide (PEO and methylcellulose)), polymer molecular 
weight, and KOH:H2O:PEO/cellulose ratio [37]. On the one hand, PEO is 
known as a poor ion‐conducting polymer at room temperature. The reported 
conductivities are in the order of 10−7 S.cm−1 [37]. On the other hand, PEO 
ionically crosslinks with sodium ion in alkaline electrolyte and reduces the

corrosion of zinc. Methylcellulose was tested as one of the gel‐electrolyte 
­components on the basis of its use as a separator in alkaline battery systems. 
Alkaline gel electrolytes were fabricated by a two‐step method. First, a polymer 
solution was printed by extrusion on top of the electrodes. This was followed 
by pipetting the appropriate amount of potassium hydroxide solution [37]. 
A planar printed primary 2D silver/zinc battery with gel electrolyte was found 
to deliver areal energy density of 4.1 ± 0.3mWh.cm−2 [37].
Clarka et  al. developed a flexible zinc‐air battery that was produced by 
screen‐printing an anode based on zinc/carbon/polymer composite, and a 
vapor‐polymerized PEDOT cathode on two sides of photo‐quality paper [38] 
and applying a lithium chloride electrolyte between the two electrodes. For 
printing the electrolyte, an aliquot of the LiCl/LiOH solution was mixed with 
molten (∼60 °C) polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW 1500), in a 1:1 ratio by weight, 
to make 6 M LiCl:P(EO). Ethanol or butan‐1‐ol was added to obtain 10 mPa.s 
viscosity for inkjet printing [38]. To ensure sufficient coverage, eight layers of 
the electrolyte were printed on the substrate at a drop spacing of 20 µm and a 
cartridge temperature of 30 °C. Evaporation of the solvents caused the electro-
lyte to solidify. In other experiments, 8 M LiCl/LiOH electrolyte was formu-
lated without the addition of PEG, and ethanol or butan‐1‐ol was added to 
lower the solution viscosity for inkjet printing [38].
As already mentioned, printing of the electrolyte layer for the rechargeable 
printed battery is even more challenging than for the primary battery, since 
the electrolyte/membrane must withstand continuous volumetric changes of 
electrode materials occurring on charge/discharge and enable longevity of the

battery. A printable paste formulation for the electrolyte has been developed 
in  [39]. In order to bring the 25% caustic‐potash‐solution electrolyte into 
screen‐printable form, different binder/solvent combinations and thickener 
agents were tested. This electrolyte paste then also acts as separator [39]. 
The specifications for the Zn/MnO2 cell are as follows: 20 × 20 mm2 electrode, 
1 mA charging/discharging current and 20mAh capacity. The capacity of the 
NiMH‐cell of the same size varies from 16 to 32mAh.
The major hurdles in formulating printable gel electrolytes that remain sta-
ble over the battery life are addressed by Gethin et al. [39]. The authors suggest 
a roll‐to‐roll (R2R) process for overcoming some of the challenges of fabrica-
tion of flexible printable wearable batteries. The electrodes were screen‐printed 
while the gel electrolyte was sandwiched between them. The screen‐printing 
process enabled the sequential deposition of current collector, electrode and 
separator/electrolyte materials on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate 
in order to form flexible and rechargeable electrodes for battery application. 
The anode and cathode were based on the conducting poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxy-
thiophen), poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT, PSS) and polyethyleneimine (PEI), 
which were combined to form the electrodes. A layer of electrolyte (sodium 
styrene sulfonate – PSSNa) in the form of a gel or a precast film with a thick-
ness of about 3 µm was eventually placed and not printed over the electrode, 
covering its entire surface [39]. The difference in the redox potential between 
the two electrodes produced an open‐circuit voltage of 0.60 V and the battery 
displayed a specific capacity of 5.5mAh.g−1, which is comparable to the specific 
capacities obtained from conventional rechargeable lead/acid batteries. The 
battery developed had an active surface area of 400 mm2 and a device thickness 
of 440 microns. As this is a thin‐polymer battery and the amount of active 
material is very small, this battery can serve only limited applications, such as 
powering devices that are activated periodically for short times.
The ionogel inkjet printing method is used by Delannoy et al. [27, 40] to 
develop a fast deposition process of solid electrolyte for a microbattery. The 
authors [40] combine inkjet printing with sol‐gel technique to obtain ionogel 
electrolytes. In the sol‐gel process, the precursors for preparation of colloid 
consist of a metal or metalloid element surrounded by various ligands. The 
polymerization takes place as a result of a condensation reaction between two 
hydrolyzed precursor molecules. The most common examples of precursor are 
tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS). The sol pre-
cursor of the ionogel was prepared by mixing tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS), 
the ionic liquid N‐methyl‐N‐propylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfo-
nylimide (PYR13‐TFSI) and the lithium salt lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sul-
fonylimide (LiTFSI). The IL/TMOS, and IL/TEOS, molar ratios are 0.25 and 
1  [40]. The viscosity of the ionogel precursor (approximately 10 mPa.s) is 
appropriate for printing. The deposition was directly performed onto the 
porous composite electrodes (LiFePO4 and Li4Ti5O12 cathode‐ and anode‐active

materials respectively). Droplets from the cartridge tank are ejected on demand 
through the nozzles to form the desired pattern. The ionogel conductivity is 
found to be two orders of magnitude higher than that of LiPON for an IL/
TMOS molar ratio of 0.25.
A study of the conductivity of ionogels based on confined‐in‐silica ionic liq-
uids has been published in [41]. For 1:1 IL:TMSO the ionogel shows conductiv-
ity similar to that of PYR13‐LiTFSI liquid electrolyte. This is only one order of 
magnitude lower at room temperature than that of the standard nonaqueous 
liquid electrolyte of Li‐ion batteries (1 M LiPF6 in the EC:DMC binary solvents 
(LP30)). Half cells and complete batteries have been assembled with tape‐cast 
LiFePO4 positive and Li4Ti5O12 negative porous composite electrodes, both 
coated by an ionogel solid‐electrolyte layer. The coated electrodes are 
inserted, facing each other, into a Swagelok cell. A fiberglass separator, soaked 
in PYR13‐TFSI and LiTFSI solution, is inserted in a way that makes good wet-
ting contact between the two solid‐electrolyte ionogel surfaces. The first dis-
charge of complete cells shows a capacity of 125 mAh.g−1 at C/10. The discharge 
capacity remains above 100mAh.g−1 after 25 cycles (Figure 4.9). Areal capacity 
of 0.3mAh.cm−2 is obtained, which corresponds to a specific capacity of 
60mAh.g−1 for the LiFePO4 positive electrode. By comparison, capacities 
obtained with LP30 liquid electrolyte are 145mAh.g−1 and 0.75mAh.cm−2 
at  a  C/30 rate. Such differences are related to different ionic conductivities,

viscosities and interfacial problems. On the other hand, a capacity close to 
0.3mAh.cm−2 is much higher than that of microbatteries obtained by PVD 
(0.12–25 µAhcm−2) [40, 42, 43]. Cycleability appears to be good over 100 cycles.
On the basis of the data presented above, particularly on the thickness of 
electrodes, printed batteries can be considered as power sources intermediate 
between conventional bulk batteries and thin‐film batteries. The 3D‐printed 
battery (3D‐PB) is one of a series of printed batteries. Its structure is more 
complex than that of the 2D‐printed battery, since 3D‐PB implies high‐aspect‐
ratio, complex‐shape electrode architectures. As with 2D‐battery printing, in 
the 3D printing process of a battery, the most challenging part is the printing of 
the solid electrolyte, a problem as yet unresolved.
Hu et al. [24] have recently developed graphene oxide (GO)‐based electrode 
composite and solid membrane inks to print by DIW (direct ink writing) the 
all‐component 3D lithium‐ion battery with interdigitated electrodes. The inks 
developed are aqueous GO‐based electrode slurries, consisting of high‐­
concentrated GO with cathode‐ or anode‐active materials. The GO ­contributes 
to the formation of suitable rheological properties of the ink, which enable 3D 
printing. The electrode filaments are extruded directly from a nozzle and 
deposited layer by layer. The dimensions of the interdigitated electrode are 
7 mm × 3 mm with a six‐layer thickness. As a result of the shear stress induced 
by the nozzle, the GO flakes are aligned along the extruding direction, which 
enhances the electrical conductivity of the electrode [44]. The membrane‐ink 
composite consisting of PVDF‐ co ‐HFP and Al2O3 nanoparticles is printed 
into the channels between the electrodes. When the sample is dried, the liquid 
electrolyte is injected into the channel to fully soak the electrodes. An entirely 
3D‐printed LiFePO4/Li4Ti5O12 full cell features a high electrode mass loading 
of about 18 mg.cm−2 when normalized to the overall area of the battery. The 
full cell delivers initial charge and discharge capacities of 117 and 91mAhg−1 
with good cycling stability (Figure 4.10).
The current research in our laboratory is focused on the development of an 
extruder that will create custom‐made filaments composed of active anode, 
cathode and electrolyte materials to simultaneously print all the components 
of a high‐aspect‐ratio 3D‐microbattery.
4.2.4  Laser‐printed Electrolytes
Several laser‐printing techniques have been tested for the printing of electro-
lytes. Matrix‐assisted, pulsed‐laser evaporation (MAPLE) has been used to 
deposit a wide variety of materials, including metallic, ceramic, polymeric and 
even biological materials. However, as with hot‐melt inkjet printing, MAPLE is 
limited to patterning two‐dimensional layers or simple three‐dimensional 
structures, since the impinging molten material requires an underlying sub-
strate for support.

The direct laser‐writing technique by multi‐photon polymerization, because 
of its unique properties and characteristics, has proven to be an indispensable 
tool for high‐accuracy structuring and has been put on the map as an emerging 
technology for scaffold 3D printing. Direct laser writing (DLW) by multi‐pho-
ton polymerization (MPP) is a three‐dimensional printing technology that 
allows the construction of readily assembled structures with sub‐100 nm reso-
lution. It is based on the nonlinear photon absorption by photopolymers; the 
beam of an ultra‐fast laser is tightly focused inside the volume of a transparent 
material, causing it to absorb two or more photons and polymerize locally. 
DLW, along with classic stereolithography and selective laser sintering, make 
up a versatile class of laser‐based 3D printing techniques. In general, a material 
suitable for structuring with DLW includes at least two components: (i) a 
monomer, or a mixture of monomers/oligomers, which will provide the final 
polymer and (ii) a photoinitiator, which will absorb the laser light and provide 
the active species that will cause the polymerization. These are mainly negative 
photoresists, such as hydrogels, acrylate materials, the epoxy‐based photore-
sist SU‐8 and hybrid materials [45].
Selective laser sintering (SLS) creates three‐dimensionally patterned materi-
als by locally fusing polymer powder through laser writing. This approach was 
invented by Deckard [46] and developed by Bourell et al. [47]. It shares a com-
mon feature with 3DP in that a layer of powder is spread on a piston and

selected regions are bonded together. But where 3DP relies on binder deposi-
tion, SLS induces the desired powder adhesion by melting (or viscous sinter-
ing). Metals, ceramics, glasses, and polymers can be incorporated into the 
powder system, but a thermoplastic polymer is needed to bind the materials 
together. The powder size and melting process limit SLS to structures with 
feature sizes of ~100 µm or more [48]. Stereolithography (SLA) technology 
employs liquid ultraviolet‐curable photopolymer resin and an ultraviolet laser 
to build the object’s layers one at a time. For each layer, the laser beam traces a 
cross‐section of the part pattern on the surface of the liquid resin. Exposure to 
the ultraviolet laser light cures and solidifies the pattern traced on the resin and 
joins it to the layer below. This is the greatest difficulty in designing concen-
trated inks suitable for direct writing on the microscale. Nature has provided 
the only example of “direct ink writing” of complex structures with microme-
ter‐sized, self‐supported features, in the form of spider webs. This low‐viscos-
ity fluid undergoes solidification as it flows through a fine‐scale spinneret to 
form silk filaments. One of the advantages of the laser‐induced forward‐trans-
fer (LIFT) process is that because of its nozzle‐free nature, LIFT is capable of 
printing patterns of 3‐D pixels (or voxels = VOlume piXEL) with nano‐inks of 
much higher viscosity than that of inkjet printing, thus significantly reducing 
variations between patterns due to wetting and drying effects [49]. In the mul-
ticomponent liquid or gel systems, the desired material is suspended or dis-
solved in a liquid to form an ink, which is then spread on the substrate [50]. As 
with the inkjet approach, thick layers can be deposited and stacked. The use of 
inks enables the transferred materials to flow and coalesce, forming uniform 
and continuous coatings upon reaching the acceptor substrate. By optimizing 
laser and ink parameters, feature sizes on the order of 1–2 µm can be achieved.
One of the important attributes of DLW printing in the context of electro-
chemical systems is that it allows for the deposition of highly porous, multi-
component materials without modifying their properties. In all cases, the 
technique results in uniform transfer of the structurally complex materials 
with a porous structure that allows for good electrolyte penetration. Another 
key advantage of DLW printing in constructing electrochemical cells is the 
flexibility in the design of operating geometries.
The viscosity of the ink affects the film thickness, i.e., for high‐viscosity inks, 
thicker films are deposited per DLW pass than for lower‐viscosity inks. As the 
viscosity of the ink increases, the laser power required for its printing increases 
as well. This increase in laser power not only causes deterioration of the print-
ing resolution, but can also alter the materials suspended in the ink. Thus, 
optimization of the overall transfer process must also take into account how 
the higher laser power affects the chemical and material properties of the ink 
components [49].

Laboratory for the deposition of solid‐state ionic‐liquid electrolyte membranes. 
The solution was composed of a 1 M lithium salt (lithium‐bis‐trifluo-
romethanesulfonylimide) dissolved in an ionic liquid (1,2‐dimethyl‐3‐n‐butyl-
imidazolium‐bis‐trifluoromethanesulfonylimide—DMBI + TFSI‐), a polymer 
(poly(vinylidene fluoride‐co‐hexafluoropropylene)—PVDF‐HFP), a solvent 
(dibasic ester—DBE), and ceramic nanoparticles (25 nm TiO2). The composi-
tion of the solution was 6.4 wt.% DMBITFSI, 3.6 wt.% PVDF‐HFP, 1.1 wt.% 
TiO2, and 88.9 wt.% DBE. The suspension is spread on a borosilicate glass slide 
with a wire coater. Then an Nd:YVO4 laser (λ = 355 nm) with a µm2 spot size is 
used to irradiate the back side of the borosilicate glass slide and transfer the ink 
onto the substrate below ((~100 µm gap). Once transferred, the resulting ink 
layer is heated in a convection oven at 75 °C for 60 minutes and then placed in 
a vacuum oven and heated at 80 °C for 24 hours in order to form a continuous, 
pinhole‐free, moisture‐free ionically conductive membrane. Other important 
properties for solid‐state‐electrolyte membranes to possess are mechanical 
strength and flexibility. Figure 4.11 (a, b, c) [52] shows three optical micro-
graphs of a laser‐printed solid‐state‐electrolyte membrane deposited on a glass 
substrate. In Figure 4.11a, the optical micrograph shows the undisturbed laser‐
printed membrane. Figures 4.11b and 4.11c show the solid‐state‐electrolyte 
membrane being partially and then completely, respectively, lifted from the 
glass substrate with the use of a pair of tweezers. The membrane thickness is 
approximately 5 µm. These optical micrographs show that deposited material

forms a continuous, flexible, pinhole‐free membrane and that even at a thick-
ness of 5 µm, the membranes are strong enough and flexible enough to be peeled 
off with tweezers without causing the membranes to tear or form cracks.
The effect of the viscosity of the electrolyte suspension on the resulting solid 
IL membrane was tested. Figure 4.12 [52] shows scanning‐electron‐micros-
copy (SEM) micrographs of different‐viscosity solid electrolytes deposited on a 
cathode material (LiCoO2) commonly used for Li‐ion battery systems. As the 
percentage of dibasic ether solvent (DBE) decreases (from 91 wt.% in (a) to 
87 wt.% in (e)), one can see that the separator does not seep as far down into the 
porous cathode (LiCoO2). By controlling the viscosity of the precursor electro-
lyte suspension, one can begin with a low‐viscosity suspension that allows the 
electrolyte material to percolate and seep down into the pores of the cathode 
and anode to gain access to all of the active material. This is then followed by a 
high‐viscosity suspension that will form a solid separator layer on the surface 
of the cathode that isolates the cathode from the anode. In addition, the higher 
viscosities help to planarize the porous cathode surface in order to reduce the 
chances of short circuits when the anode is deposited.
The nanocomposite solid‐state electrolyte films exhibited ionic conductivity of 
about 1.5 ms · cm−1 at about 30 °C, (Figure 4.13) [52]. Higher values in the range of 
1.8 to 3.1 mS · cm−1 were reported elsewhere [54] as a function of TiO2 and of the 
amount of ionic liquid. These ionic conductivities are typical of ionic‐liquid‐based 
electrolytes, namely, 2–5 mS · cm−1 [51]. These results show that the process of 
laser printing does not damage the ionic conductivity of the transferred material.

A lithium microbattery was assembled using the laser‐printed polymer 
membrane, which was sandwiched between a laser‐printed LiCoO2 cathode 
and a lithium‐metal anode. This microbattery was cycled by chronopotenti-
ometry at a C/18 rate. The footprint of the active area was 9 mm2 with an active 
mass (cathode‐limited) of 483 mg. The separator thickness was approximately 
5 µm. The microbattery had a charge/discharge efficiency of ~98% and a capac-
ity per area of 205mAhcm−2. Li‐ion microbatteries were also fabricated with 
these ~20 µm solid‐polymer membranes with the use of an LiCoO2 cathode 
(30 µm) and a carbon anode [53]. The battery was charged and discharged at a 
constant current density of 40 μA/cm2 (0.1C rate) between 4.2 V and 3 V. After 
the fourth cycle, the microbattery had a coulombic efficiency of 98% with a 
discharge capacity of 0.495mAhcm−2. Both capacity values (of lithium and 
lithium‐ion cells) are higher than the value of 0.16mAhcm−2 achieved for sput-
ter‐deposited lithium microbatteries reported by Bates et al. [52].
Another work by Alberto Piqué et al. [54] demonstrates the deposition of 
sequential layers by LDW (laser direct writing) of an LiCoO2 cathode, a com-
posite solid‐polymer ionic liquid (c‐SPIL) electrolyte and a carbon anode. The 
composition of the c‐SPIL electrolyte is similar to that employed in previous 
work, except that the amount of DBE is not specified [52]. All layers are depos-
ited in a 3 × 3 mm2 laser micro‐machined pocket on a polyimide/aluminum

flexible substrate. The overall thickness of these cells is approximately 30 µm, 
corresponding to a total volume of 270 nL. The microbatteries are cycled more 
than 100 times between 4.65 and 3 V at charging and discharging currents of 
0.11 mA/cm−2.
SEM images (Figure 4.14) [54] show that the LDW‐transfer process depos-
its the c‐SPIL ink to form a uniform, pinhole‐free solid‐polymer layer. 
Because of the granular nature of the cathodic layer, the initial laser‐­deposited 
c‐SPIL separator is able to partially penetrate this material, allowing for 
enhanced surface‐area interactions between the electrolyte and the cathode. 
The LDW c‐SPIL electrolyte composed of 30 wt% PVDF‐HFP, 52 wt% 1 M Li/
BMMITFSI, and 18 wt% of 60–80 nm to 1–2 µm‐size barium titanium oxide 
particles (BTO) has an ionic conductivity in the range 0.02–1.69 mS · cm−1

(Table 4.2). The data clearly indicate that the addition of smaller particles results 
in higher ionic conductivity [51, 54]. This size dependence is similar to the 
behavior seen in PEO‐based composite polymer electrolytes [51] and thus is not 
related to the method of preparation, i.e., printing or casting. The dependence 
of the ionic conductivity on the amount of TiO2 ceramics was tested. The meas-
ured room‐temperature ionic conductivity of 2.8–3.11 mS · cm−1 (10–18 w/w% 
TiO2) is close to that of typical ionic‐liquid electrolytes. It is more than two orders 
of magnitude higher than that of LiPON [54] and 1 to 4 orders of magnitude 
higher than those of solid amorphous or crystalline polymer electrolytes. The 
TiO2 nanopowder serves as a stiffener of the nanocomposite and, in addition, 
partially absorbs the incident laser radiation during the LIFT process.

corresponding to a specific energy of 0.33mWhg−1 on the basis of the battery 
mass. The cathodic capacity of this battery is near 100mAhg−1. Thus, these LDW 
microbatteries exhibit energy densities and capacities similar to those observed 
for typical lithium‐ion batteries and state‐of‐the‐art microbatteries [54].
Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is a novel method of fabricating micro/
nanometer‐scale patterns at low cost, with high throughput and high resolu-
tion. Unlike traditional optical‐lithographic approaches, which create pat-
terns through the use of photons or electrons to modify the chemical and 
physical properties of the resist, NIL relies on direct mechanical deforma-
tion of the resist and can therefore achieve resolutions beyond the limita-
tions set by light diffraction or beam scattering that are encountered in 
conventional lithographic techniques [55]. Lee et al. use the UV‐IL tech-
nique to construct 3D shape‐conformable polymer electrolytes featuring a 
maze‐like structure with a repeating surface grating (wall thickness and 
height of 10 µm) in 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm footprint. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 
was pressed against cast layers of precursors, composed of ethoxylated tri-
methylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) monomer, photoinitiator, and alu-
mina nanoparticles. UV exposure through the stamps yielded solid replicas 
of composite gel‐polymer electrolyte. Cycling of the LiCoO2/composite 
GPE/Li cell exhibits stable charge/discharge profiles up to the 50th cycle 
with coulombic efficiency of 97% [56].
4.3  ­Summary
While the field of printed batteries is newly developed, it has progressed 
greatly within the last few years. The printing of ion‐conducting membranes 
and electrolytes remains a bottleneck in all‐printed devices, because of the 
diverse, stringent requirements imposed on electrolytes. In order to enable 
high performance of a printed battery, high ionic conductivity, and compati-
bility with electrode materials are essential properties. In addition, the print-
ing of electrolyte directly onto the electrode surface is very problematic. 
Development of electrolyte inks is the major challenge in the fabrication of an 
all‐printed battery. The composition and rheology of each ink must be opti-
mized in order to ensure reliable flow, to promote adhesion between the 
printed features, to provide the structural integrity needed to withstand dry-
ing and sintering without delamination or distortion, and above all, to main-
tain the electrochemical activity of the electrode and electrolyte materials. A 
very few publications appear in this field, with polymer‐gel or swelled mem-
branes as the most studied. Zn/MnO2, Zn/Ag, Zn/air, LiCoO2/Li4Ti5O12 and 
LiFePO4/Li4Ti5O12 are the major types of all‐printed batteries developed up to 
now. Polymers used for membranes and gel electrolytes in these batteries

include PVDF‐HFP, PMMA, PEO, PAN, methylcellulose and PDMS. Alumina, 
silica and titanium oxide nanoparticles are used as ceramic fillers to increase 
the mechanical strength and uptake of alkaline aqueous or aprotic carbonate, 
γ‐butyrolactone or ionic‐liquid‐based electrolytes. Direct, inkjet, screen or 
laser printing and stencil brush or spray‐painting methods are applied for the 
printing of gels and membranes. The ionic conductivity of printed electrolytes 
was found to be close to the conductivity of the counterpart conventional bat-
tery electrolytes. The electrochemical performance of printed batteries 
approaches and in some cases outperforms that of conventional bulk and 
thin‐film batteries. However, as opposed to the latter, there are no publica-
tions which deal with investigation of ion‐conduction mechanisms in printed 
electrolytes and interfacial electrode/electrolyte phenomena. No experiments 
and results have been published up to now on the printing of all‐solid‐state 
polymer and ceramic electrolytes.
We believe that owing to the great promise latent in the concept of the fully 
printed battery, the intensive research effort that must be devoted to the devel-
opment of printed‐electrolyte technology will be valuable both to electro-
chemical science and to the battery market. The most progressive 3D‐printing 
technique, which enables simultaneous printing of all battery components, is 
expected to contribute greatly to electrochemical energy‐storage devices.

5.1  ­Introduction
With the advent of flexible/wearable electronics and the Internet of Things 
(IoT), which are expected to drastically change our daily lives, printed elec-
tronics have drawn much attention as a low‐cost, efficient, and scalable plat-
form technology [1–3]. Printed electronics require so‐called “printed batteries” 
as a monolithically integrated power source that can be prepared by the same 
printing processes (Figure 5.1).
From the battery manufacturing point of view, conventional batteries with 
fixed shapes and sizes are generally fabricated by winding or stacking cell com-
ponents (such as anodes, cathodes, and separator membranes) and then pack-
aging them with (cylindrical‐/rectangular‐shaped) metallic canisters or pouch 
films, finally followed by injection of liquid electrolytes [3, 4]. In particular, the 
use of liquid electrolytes gives rise to serious concerns in cell assembly because 
they require strict packaging materials to avoid leakage problems and also 
separator membranes to prevent electrical contact between electrodes. For 
these reasons, conventional battery materials and assembly processes have 
caused lack of variety in form factors, thus imposing formidable challenges in 
relation to their integration into versatile‐shaped electronic devices. In con-
trast to conventional batteries, printed batteries are thinner and lighter, and 
can be easily produced through a variety of cost‐effective printing processes [4]. 
More importantly, they offer unprecedented opportunities to diversify battery

design, dimensions, and form, far beyond that achievable with conventional 
battery technologies.
Printing technology is a facile and reproducible process in which slurries or 
inks are deposited to make pre‐defined patterns [4, 5]. The slurries/inks should 
be designed to fulfill the requirements (such as rheology and particle disper-
sion) of the printing process. The development of printed batteries involves the 
design and fabrication of battery component slurries/inks. Most studies of 
printed batteries have been devoted to the development of printed electrodes. 
However, in order to reach the ultimate goal of so‐called “all‐printed batteries”, 
printed separator membranes and electrolytes should be also developed along 
with printed electrodes.
In this chapter, we describe the design principle and recent advances in 
printed batteries, with a focus on the major components. Based on this under-
standing, the current status of and research progress in various printed battery 
systems, including Zn/MnO2 batteries, supercapacitors, lithium‐ion batteries, 
and other batteries, are presented with particular attention to their aesthetic 
versatility. In addition, development direction and future prospects as a poten-
tial power source with design flexibility are discussed.

5.2  ­Design of Printed Battery Components
5.2.1  Printed Electrodes
A primary step for developing printed electrodes is the preparation of electrode 
slurry/inks, which should be tailored to ensure process compatibility with print-
ing techniques [3, 4]. Key requirements for the printed electrode slurry/inks 
include: (1) dispersion state of components, (2) rheological properties (i.e., vis-
cosity and viscoelasticity) tuned for specific printing processes, (3) structural/
dimensional stability after printing (e.g., cohesion between particles, adhesion 
with substrates and mechanical tolerance upon external stress) [6].
Among various electrode components, electrically conductive additives are 
essentially employed to facilitate electron transport in electrodes. Of readily 
available conductive additives, carbonaceous substances such as carbon nano-
tubes (CNTs) and graphenes have been extensively investigated due to their 
high electrical conductivity and also affordable electrochemical capacitance, 
which is often beneficial for electrical double‐layer capacitors (EDLCs) [7]. A 
major challenge for carbonaceous substances is their dispersion in water and 
other polar solvents. In particular, for CNT cases, strong inter‐tube affinity 
and intrinsic hydrophobicity pose a stringent problem for securing good dis-
persion state [7, 8]. In most studies, the dispersion of CNTs has been achieved 
with the assistance of CNT‐dispersing agents such as SDBS (sodium dodecylb-
enzene sulfonate), and surface functionalization of CNTs [7, 8]. An important 
note is that these additional procedures for CNT dispersion should not impair 
intrinsic electrical conductivity of CNTs.
The electrically conductive additives are mixed with electrochemically 
active materials in the presence of binders, which are used to allow cohesion 
between the electrode components and also adhesion with current collectors. 
To develop printed electrodes with various form factors and reliable physico-
chemical/electrochemical properties, control of the rheological properties of 
electrode slurries/inks is needed as an important prerequisite, along with 
rational design of the electrode chemistry. Details of the theoretical under-
standing of the rheological behavior of slurries and inks were described in 
review papers [3, 9, 10], with a particular focus on the relationship with coating 
and printing techniques. The materials, compositions, and rheology of elec-
trode slurry/inks should be fine‐tuned to meet the requirements of the chosen 
printing process. Information on materials and formulations of various elec-
trode slurries/inks, which is classified as a function of battery types, is provided 
in Table 5.1.
To enable electrodes to be electrochemically active in batteries, ionic path-
ways as well as electronic channels in electrodes should be simultaneously 
secured. One interesting point in Table  5.1 is that most of the electrode 
­slurries/inks contain only electrically conductive components (represented by 

 Table 5.1  Materials and formulations of electrode slurries/inks for various printed batteries.

carbon‐based additives) and not ionically conductive ones. As a consequence, 
the resultant printed electrodes should uptake liquid electrolytes after being 
assembled with separator membranes and packaging substances. Recently, Lee 
et al. demonstrated a new electrode slurry that afforded mixed electron/ion 
conduction (Figure 5.2) [1]. The electrode slurries were composed of electro-
chemically active powders (such as LiFePO4 (cathode) and Li4Ti5O12 (anode)),

a thermally tolerant electrolyte). In comparison to the previously reported sys-
tems, these printed electrodes possessed the electrolyte‐conductive as well as the 
carbon‐conductive additives, resulting in the elimination of liquid‐electrolyte 
injection steps and also traditional processing solvents such as water and NMP 
(N‐methyl‐2‐Pyrrolidone) that demand additional time‐/energy‐consuming 
drying processes. The rheological properties of the electrode slurries were con-
trolled by adjusting the composition ratio and solid content to show thixotropic 
fluid behavior [41, 42] that is suitable for a stencil‐printing process. The elec-
trode inks were conformally printed onto various substrates (including curvilin-
ear surfaces) by stencil printing. Subsequently, the printed electrode inks were 
solidified after exposure to UV irradiation in less than a minute. Driven by such 
well‐tuned rheological characteristics and process simplicity, the printed elec-
trodes with various form factors (such as heart‐/letter‐shapes and microscale 
patterns) were successfully realized.
Current collectors, along with electrochemically active materials, are an 
important component for fast and reliable electrochemical reactions in battery 
electrodes. Current collectors serve as an electrically conductive support in the 
form of foils, meshes, or foams that provide pathways for efficient electron 
transport towards electrochemically active layers [3]. The current collectors 
should be chemically compatible and also have good adhesion with the electro-
chemically active layers to maintain the structural integrity of the electrodes. 
In addition, a wide electrochemical‐stability window is required to prevent 
unwanted corrosion reaction during battery operation. To develop printed 
electrodes with design versatility, the current collectors should be also printa-
ble in addition to the other printed battery components. Currently, the usual 
current collectors in commercial electrodes are metallic foils; however, their 
predetermined shape and mechanical stiffness pose impediments to diversify-
ing the design and form factors of the printed batteries. Unfortunately, only a 
few works have reported on printed current collectors. Cui et al. presented the 
CNT‐coated conductive paper current collector, which showed a sheet resist-
ance of ~ 1 ohm sq−1 [43]. Another approach was the utilization of a spray‐coat-
ing method to produce a conductive CNT current collector. The spray‐coating 
solution consisted of CNT/carbon black (=8/2 (w/w)) in NMP solvent [44]. 
The sheet resistance of the resulting spray‐coated CNT current collector was 
found to be as low as ~ 10 ohm sq−1. In addition to the CNT current collector, 
a spray‐coated metal current collector was prepared using Cu (copper) inks 
[44]. This result underscores the potential applicability of metallic inks as a 
printed current collector for use in printed batteries. A variety of commercially 
available metallic inks which can be used in printed batteries are summarized 
in Table 5.2.
Substrates, onto which the electrode components are printed, also play a 
valuable role in achieving high‐precision printed batteries. For example, print-
ing on so‐called “wetting substrates”, such as conventional paper or textiles,

tends to provoke random spreading of ink droplets due to uncontrollable 
capillary force created by the inhomogeneously distributed/several‐hundred‐
micrometer‐sized pores of the substrates [45, 46]. Meanwhile, “non‐wetting 
substrates”, such as non‐porous polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films, often 
result in a ring‐like deposition (i.e., coffee‐ring formation) of ink particles [45] 
as well as having poor adhesion between the printed products and the sub-
strates [6]. To resolve substrate‐triggered printing failure, previous work has 
been mostly devoted to tuning ink materials and formulations, which often 
limits the selection of ink chemistry. As a facile and efficient approach to 
addressing this substrate issue, Lee et al. demonstrated an inkjet‐printed cel-
lulose nanomat on commercial A4 paper (Figure 5.3) [2]. The cellulose nano-
mat layers were designed to exhibit a nanoporous structure and uniform 
surface roughness, eventually providing the combined advantageous attributes 
of “wetting” and “non‐wetting” substrates. As a consequence, the cellulose 
nanomat layer contributed to broadening the chemistry/formulation spectrum 
of electrode/electrolyte inks and also to achieving high‐resolution print images 
on conventional A4 paper without the concerns of droplet spreading or cof-
fee‐ring formation.
5.2.2  Printed Separator Membranes and Solid‐state Electrolytes
Conventional rechargeable batteries have (cylindrical‐/rectangular‐shaped) 
stereotypical forms which are generally fabricated using a winding or stacking 
process. Such cell assembly has meant that power sources lack a variety of form 
factors and design flexibility. This unwanted limitation is believed to mostly 
arise from the use of separator membranes and liquid electrolytes. In most of 
the printed batteries investigated so far, separator membranes and electrolytes 
have not been a center of attention, as compared to electrodes. However, in

order to reach the ultimate goal of so‐called “all‐printed‐batteries”, printed 
separator membranes and printed electrolytes should be developed along with 
the aforementioned printed electrodes.
Subramanian et al. developed a printed, UV‐cured gel separator membrane 
[37] (Figure  5.4), which consisted of crosslinked polyacrylic acid and 
poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) fillers that improve the mechanical stability of the 
resulting separator membrane and control rheological properties. The 
crosslinked polyacrylic acid was synthesized by a free‐radical method using a 
water‐soluble photo initiator. The crosslinking density of the polyacrylic acid 
was controlled to optimize the mechanical strength and the water‐swelling 
ratio. The 1 wt% crosslinking density was found to give optimal performance 
overall. Lower concentrations resulted in incomplete gel formation with

(4 ~ 5 wt%) showed poor solubility, causing deterioration of printing processa-
bility and the properties of the printed electrolytes.
Ajayan et al. fabricated a spray‐printed separator membrane (Figure 5.5) [44]. 
The printing solution was composed of polyvinylidene fluoride‐hexafluoro-
propylene (PVdF‐HFP)/polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)/and fumed SiO2 =  
27/9/4 (w/w/w) in a solvent mixture of acetone/N,N‐dimenthylformamide 
(DMF) = 1/1 (v/v). PVdF‐HFP, which has good solubility in low‐boiling‐point 
solvents, acted as a polymer matrix to endow mechanical rigidity, while PMMA 
was chosen to promote adhesion towards substrates. The resulting spray‐
printed separator membranes showed a fibrous morphology with high poros-
ity, which was favorable for absorbing liquid electrolyte.
Lee et al. demonstrated a printed, flexible solid‐state electrolyte (Figure 5.6) 
[47, 48]. The printed solid‐state electrolyte consisted of UV‐crosslinked ETPTA 
polymer network as a mechanical framework, EC/PC‐based high‐boiling point 
electrolyte, and Al2O3 nanoparticles as a nano spacer/viscosity‐controlling 
agent. The rheological behavior of the printable electrolyte pastes was affected 
by the composition ratio and dispersion state of Al2O3 nanoparticles. At the 
optimum composition ratio, the printable electrolyte pastes exhibited shear‐
thinning behavior (i.e., decrease of viscosity with shear rate) and also crossover 
of elastic/loss modulus at a certain shear stress, revealing thixotropic fluid 
behavior. In contrast, conventional liquid electrolytes showed newtonian fluid‐
like rheological behavior. The electrolyte pastes with well‐tuned rheological 
characteristics were printed onto various substrates using a stencil‐printing 
process. After exposure to UV irradiation, the as‐printed electrolyte pastes

were solidified. Notably, the printable electrolyte pastes, in combination with 
the UV‐IL (imprint lithography) technique, enabled the fabrication of micro-
scale‐structured patterns. Similar approaches were applied to the development 
of ionic liquid‐based solid‐state electrolytes. The ionic liquid was mixed with 
the UV‐curable acrylate monomer [2] or confined in silica matrix via sol‐gel 
reaction [49], leading to printable solid‐state electrolytes.
5.3  ­Aesthetic Versatility of Printed Battery Systems
Most of the printed batteries reported to date were devoted to zinc (Zn)‐based 
electrochemistry. Exploration of other battery systems such as supercapacitors 
and lithium‐ion batteries for potential use as a printed power source has been 
recently undertaken. The types, components, printing techniques, and electro-
chemical characteristics of the printed battery systems reported to date are 
summarized in Table 5.3.
Besides the materials and associated electrochemistry, the design and con-
figuration of cell components are also important in developing high‐perfor-
mance printed batteries with aesthetic versatility. In commercial batteries, 
anodes and cathodes are stacked in series with separator membranes 
(Figure 5.7(a)). This in‐series configuration is beneficial in reducing the dis-
tance between the anode and cathode, thereby lowering internal ohmic resist-
ance of the cell. In addition to the in‐series configuration, in‐parallel model can 
be applied to batteries, wherein the anode and the cathode are positioned 
side‐by‐side (Figure 5.7(b)). The in‐parallel configuration is effective for wid-
ening the printing process window owing to the process simplicity and mini-
mal risk of short‐circuit failure. Printed batteries require a broad variety of 
form factors and shape deformability. In this respect, the in‐parallel configura-
tion could be a promising way to enrich the design and applicability of printed 
batteries. Below is an overview of various printed batteries in terms of electro-
chemical cell system and design diversity.
5.3.1  Zn/MnO2 Batteries
The R2R (roll‐to‐roll) processable Zn/MnO2 battery was fabricated using a 
fluidic cathode paste [53]. The prototype Zn/MnO2 battery consisted of a Zn 
foil as an anode and current collector, a separator membrane soaked with 
NH4Cl and ZnCl2 electrolyte solution, and a solution‐processable MnO2 paste 
as a cathode. The MnO2 paste contained MnO2 active materials, conductive 
CNT networks, and electrolyte solution, wherein the CNTs acted as a current 
collector and also conductive agent.
Steingart et al. reported printed flexible Zn/MnO2 batteries based on Nylon 
mesh‐containing electrodes. This new structure was effective in reducing the

overall electrode thickness and improving the capacity without impairing the 
power density (Figure 5.8) [54]. The Nylon mesh‐embedded electrodes were 
fabricated using a stencil‐printing process. The Zn and MnO2 slurries were 
sequentially stencil‐printed, followed by printing of a silver ink as a current 
collector. Due to the incorporation of the Nylon mesh serving as a mechanical 
scaffold, the resulting mesh‐embedded electrodes showed significantly higher 
thicknesses (>300 µm) compared to those (60 ~ 75 µm) of control electrodes 
incorporating no Nylon mesh, thereby enabling a significant increase in the 
areal capacity of the electrodes. Finally, the battery was assembled by stacking 
the mesh‐embedded electrodes and polyacrylic acid gel polymer electrolyte‐
soaked Nylon mesh separator. The resulting battery provided a discharge 
capacity of 4.5 mAh cm−2 at discharge rates of 1.0 and 2.0 mA. Notably, no 
deterioration in the cell performance was observed under the bent state (bend-
ing diameter = 0.95 ~ 3.81 cm).
Printed thin‐film batteries are expected to be combined with printed elec-
tronics using the same printing techniques, eventually leading to a monolithi-
cally integrated electronics/power source device. A challenge in this integrated 
device is the low cell potential arising from the alkaline battery (~1.5 V), which 
is not sufficient to fulfil the requirement of high working potential for printed 
electronics (e.g., thin‐film transistors (10 ~ 30 V)) [55, 56]. To resolve this

problem, a series‐connection of alkaline cells was suggested (Figure 5.9) [32]. 
The stencil‐printed unit cells were connected in series using silver intercon-
nects, providing a total potential of ~ 14 V, which is high enough to power an 
inkjet‐printed complementary 5‐stage ring oscillator.
The aforementioned Zn/MnO2 batteries still failed to achieve reliable charge/
discharge cyclability. Wright et al. reported a rechargeable Zn/MnO2 micro-
battery by use of a direct‐write dispenser‐printing technique [49]. However, 
shape change in the zinc electrode, dendrite formation, and dissolution of 
reaction products into electrolytes remained formidable challenges in securing 
meaningful electrochemical rechargeability. To address this issue, they used 
ionic liquids as an alternative electrolyte [57]. The resulting battery showed an 
areal capacity of 0.98 mAh cm−2 over 70 cycles, although the mechanism for 
such improved cyclability was not fully elucidated.

5.3.2  Supercapacitors
Printed supercapacitors were fabricated through a variety of printing tech-
niques such as screen printing [58], inkjet printing [2, 59, 60], and spraying 
[61, 62]. Cui et al. presented printed thin‐film supercapacitors based on CNT 
networks (serving as both electrodes and current collectors) and printed gel 
polymer electrolyte [61]. The printed supercapacitors showed high energy 
(6 Wh kg−1) and power densities (70 kW kg−1) which were comparable to the 
results of other CNT‐based supercapacitors.
Gogotsi et al. demonstrated textile supercapacitors based on knitted carbon fib-
ers and activated carbon (AC) ink (Figure 5.10) [63]. The textile supercapacitors 
showed capacitances as high as 0.5 F cm−2 per device at 10 mV s−1, which were com-
parable with those of conventional AC film electrodes. Also, the textile superca-
pacitor exhibited excellent electrochemical performance when bent and stretched.
Lee et al. demonstrated solid‐state flexible supercapacitors which were fabri-
cated directly on conventional A4 paper using a household desktop inkjet 
printer (Figure 5.11) [2]. The new supercapacitors looked like typical inkjet‐
printed letters or patterns commonly found in office documents. To attain high‐
resolution print images on A4 paper, a cellulose nanofibril (CNF) nanomat was 
inkjet‐printed on A4 paper in advance as a primer layer. The Ag nanowires were 
introduced onto the single‐walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT)/AC electrodes 
in order to improve electrical conductivity of the resulting inkjet‐printed

electrodes, which was followed by SWNT‐assisted photonic interwelding of the 
Ag nanowire networks. The ([BMIM][BF4]/ETPTA) solid‐state electrolyte was 
applied to the inkjet‐printed electrodes via the same inkjet printing, followed by 
the UV‐crosslinking process for solidification. The inkjet‐printed supercapaci-
tors exhibited reliable electrochemical performance over 2,000 cycles as well as 
good mechanical flexibility. The inkjet‐printed supercapacitors were easily con-
nected in series or in parallel without the extra aid of metallic interconnects, 
thereby enabling user‐customized control of the cell voltage and capacitance. 
More notably, inkjet‐printed supercapacitors with computer‐designed artistic 
patterns and letters were fabricated and also aesthetically unitized with other 
inkjet‐printed art images and smart glass cups, underscoring their exceptionally 
versatile aesthetics and potential applicability as a new class of object‐tailored 
power sources for use in forthcoming Internet of Things objects.
5.3.3  Li‐ion Batteries
Ajayan et  al. reported the painted battery using a spray‐printing technique 
(Figure 5.12) [44]. The battery components, including the electrodes, separator 
membranes, and current collectors, were prepared in the form of paint solutions 
and then spray‐coated sequentially to construct the painted battery [44]. The 
paints of the aforementioned battery components were sprayed through shadow 
masks with predetermined geometries, while the temperature of the substrates 
was controlled in the range 90 ~ 120 °C to remove solvents in the painted compo-
nents. The painted battery provided an areal capacity of > 1 mAh cm−2 with a 
working voltage of ~ 2.3 V. The battery was fabricated with a large area of 25 cm2, 
demonstrating the scalability of the adopted spraying process. Also, the painted 
battery was expected to be integrated with a photovoltaic panel to develop 
energy conversion/storage hybrid devices for various outdoor applications.
The proliferation of microscale devices, such as micro‐electro‐mechanical 
systems (MEMS) [64], biomedical sensors [65], wireless sensors [66], and actua-
tors [67], prompts the relentless pursuit of flexible power sources with various 
form factors. The 3D battery based on micro‐ and nano‐structured electrodes 
could be an appealing power source for operating the microscale devices. To 
date, however, the 3D architectures have been produced in planar and 3D 
motifs using complicated/multi‐step processes such as lithography [68–70] and 
colloidal templating methods [71]. To overcome such process complexity, 3D‐
printed microbatteries were presented [12, 51]. 3D‐printed microbatteries were 
prepared with high‐aspect‐ratio electrode arrays that were interdigitated on a 
sub‐millimeter scale (Figure 5.13). The relatively low power density, however, 
has remained a formidable challenge for practical applications; it is ascribed to 
the large interdigital distance that is needed to avoid short‐circuit problems 
between the electrodes. Moreover, high temperature post treatment was essen-
tially required during fabrication of the 3D‐printed electrodes, thus imposing 
critical restrictions on widening the material design and formulation.

Design of Printed Batteries: From Chemistry to Aesthetics

The abovementioned previous studies showed meaningful achievements in 
cell design and architecture. However, most used pre‐designed masks, supple-
mentary spatial alignments, and liquid electrolytes as an ionic medium. In par-
ticular, the use of liquid electrolytes gives rise to problems such as safety failure, 
an additional electrolyte injection step, and packaging limitation. To address 
this long‐standing issue related to liquid electrolyte, Lee et al. reported printed, 
solid‐state rechargeable lithium‐ion batteries (Figure 5.14) [1]. The UV‐cured

solid‐state composite electrolyte was incorporated in the printed electrodes, 
in addition to acting as a printed separator membrane and electrolyte. As a 
consequence, time‐/energy‐consuming solvent‐drying processes and electro-
lyte injection steps were eliminated in the cell fabrication. All of the cell 
­components were sequentially printed, followed by UV irradiation for solidifi-
cation, resulting in the fabrication of all‐solid‐state printed batteries. Elaborate 
combination of the printing technology with the solid‐state electrolyte enabled 
the seamless integration of the batteries with various objects such as paper‐
made eyeglasses and glass cups.
5.3.4  Other Systems
Zn/Ag batteries have attracted considerable attention due to their high energy 
density (200 Wh kg−1 and 750 Wh L−1) and air stability [36]. However, the high 
material cost of silver poses a barrier to broadening the application field of Zn/
Ag batteries. The printing technology can be suggested as an efficient way to 
reduce the mass consumption of silver, thus boosting research into Zn/Ag bat-
teries as a promising power source system.
Wang et al. reported a rechargeable, skin‐worn Ag‐Zn tattoo battery, which 
consisted of screen‐printed electrodes, temporary tattoo paper, alkaline gel 
electrolytes and a PDMS cover (Figure 5.15) [52]. The tattoo battery showed 
an areal capacity in the range 1.3–2.1 mAh cm−2 over 13 cycles. The open‐
circuit voltage of 1.5 V was retained over 5 days upon repeated stretching and 
bending strain cycles. The lateral arrangement of the cathode and anode 
allowed the integration of several cells in series or in parallel, resulting in 
facile tuning of capacity and voltage as initially designed. The application of 
the tattoo battery to human skin as a shape‐conformable power source was 
successfully achieved.
Subramanian et al. demonstrated the development of a photopolymerizable 
alkaline separator based on poly(acrylic acid) (Figure 5.16) [37]. This PAA 
separator showed good mechanical stability and ionic conductivity of 
0.4 S cm−1. Using the PAA separator as a core component, they presented a 
stencil‐printed, silver oxide (Ag2O)‐Zn battery with areal capacities of 
5.4 mA h cm−2 and volumetric capacities of 7.1 mA h cm−3. The batteries 
showed no loss in electrochemical performance upon flexing at a bend radius 
of 1.0 cm, indicating their potential use in flexible electronics.
5.4  ­Summary and Prospects
In summary, we have reviewed the design principle and recent research pro-
gress in the field of printed batteries, with a particular focus on slurry/ink 
chemistry, printing techniques, and aesthetic versatility.

Design of Printed Batteries: From Chemistry to Aesthetics
139
A first step in the development of printed batteries is the preparation of battery 
component slurries/inks, which should be finely tuned to ensure process compat-
ibility with printing technologies. In printed batteries, the electrodes should be 
electrochemically active, indicating that ionic channels as well as electronic net-
works must be simultaneously secured. However, most of the previously reported 
electrode slurries/inks have only had electrically conductive components, such as 
carbon additives, without ionically conductive ones. These electrodes should 
additionally uptake liquid electrolytes for electrochemical activation after being 
assembled with separator membranes/packaging substances. This poses a formi-
dable challenge for the development of printed batteries with various form fac-
tors. A new approach to fabricating electrode slurries with mixed electron/ion 
conduction was demonstrated. The electrode slurries were composed of electrode 
active powders, carbon‐conductive additives, and ionically conductive polymer 
matrix, thereby eliminating the liquid‐electrolyte injection step and also tradi-
tional processing solvents that demand the time‐/energy‐consuming drying step.

Printed Batteries
140
Conventional batteries have (cylindrical‐/rectangular‐shaped) forms which 
are generally fabricated using a winding or stacking process. Such stereotypical 
cell assembly has meant that the power sources lack a variety of form factors 
and design flexibility. This unwanted limitation is believed to mainly arise from 
the use of sheet‐type separator membranes and liquid electrolytes. In most of 
the printed batteries investigated so far, separator membranes and electrolytes 
have not been a center of attention as compared to electrodes. To reach the 
ultimate goal of so‐called “all‐printed‐batteries”, printed separator membranes/
solid‐state electrolytes should be also developed. Through the combination of 
printed separator membranes/solid‐state electrolytes with printed electrodes, 
the resultant printed batteries enabled unprecedented advances in form fac-
tors and aesthetic versatility. Representative examples include letter‐shaped 
batteries, batteries with in‐series or in‐parallel configurations, and batteries 
monolithically integrated into artistic electronic patterns and art images.

Design of Printed Batteries: From Chemistry to Aesthetics
141
Printed batteries have garnered great attention as an innovative technology 
that breaks common beliefs around power sources from the design perspec-
tive. Future research into printed batteries will be directed to the design of new 
battery component slurries/inks based on chemical/rheological understanding 
and the adoption of newly emerging printing technologies such as high‐fidelity 
inkjet, electrohydrodynamic, and 3D printing. These will eventually enable a 
new class of object‐tailored power sources with exceptional design versatility 
for flexible/wearable electronics and IoT.

The energy needs of the rapidly evolving consumer electronics industry have 
consistently pushed the boundaries of battery technology. Until the 1980s, 
products such as remote controlled toys, handheld radios, torchlights, and flash 
cameras were the primary consumers of portable batteries. Zinc‐Manganese 
Dioxide (Zn‐MnO2)‐based alkaline batteries dominated this market for many 
decades due to their low cost, high energy density, and low toxicity. In the mid‐
1980s, portable music players and video recorders were introduced in the mar-
ket, which created a demand for high energy density rechargeable batteries. 
Rechargeable Ni‐Cd batteries emerged during this period, but their adoption 
was limited due to low energy density, high self‐discharge, and toxicity of the 
cadmium electrode. In 1991, after years of research and development, SONY 
introduced the world’s first rechargeable lithium ion (Li Ion) battery. The 
batteries were designed to power SONY’s highly profitable camcorder line of 
products. SONY solved the problem of dendrite formation in the anode by 
replacing the lithium metal electrode with an insertion‐based graphite elec-
trode. The cost of the early generations of Li Ion batteries was above 3000$/
kWh, which made them suitable only for high‐end products. Nickel‐Metal 
Hydride (Ni‐MH) batteries were introduced in the mid‐1990s and they were 
adopted in many electronic products. In the 2000s the mobile phone and lap-
top market grew tremendously. Electronics companies shifted from recharge-
able Ni‐MH batteries to Li Ion batteries due to their high energy density and 
cycle life. By the 2010s, the cost of Li Ion batteries dropped below 250$/kWh, 
which made them economical for all‐electric and hybrid vehicles. Tesla motors 
were the early pioneers in the development of Li Ion battery‐powered all‐electric

vehicles. By 2013, all the major car manufacturers around the world announced 
projects on battery‐powered electric vehicles. The brief history of portable 
batteries shows that advances in battery technology have always been driven by 
the development of new products. Over the years the primary consumers of 
batteries have shifted from toys to cameras, mobile phones, and laptops, and, 
more recently, to electric vehicles.
In recent years, advances in Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) fab-
rication, low‐power microprocessors, big‐data analytics and solution‐based 
device processing opened up an array of new products, such as activity track-
ers, smart clothing, printed electronics and e‐skins. These products are part of 
a large eco‐system of devices commonly referred to as ‘Internet of Things’ 
(IOT). In this eco‐system, a swarm of low‐cost, connected devices will be dis-
tributed around us. These smart devices will sense, communicate with each 
other, take action, and provide information to the user. The battery require-
ments for these products are fundamentally different from those of a laptop or 
an electric vehicle [1]. In addition to typical characteristics such as low cost and 
high energy density, the requirements for IOT applications often include char-
acteristics such as small footprint (<1 cm2), flexibility, unique form factor and 
even stretchability for certain applications. To satisfy these unique sets of 
requirements, researchers developed additive printing technologies for fabri-
cating batteries [2–7]. Batteries fabricated with the help of additive printing 
technologies are collectively called ‘printed batteries’. We have seen tremen-
dous progress in this field since the early reports in the mid‐2000s. In recent 
years, most academic battery labs around the world have published papers on 
novel printing technologies [8, 9], ink formulations [10], and electrode designs 
[11, 12]. There are a number of startup companies that are commercializing 
printed batteries. Even the large battery manufacturers such as LG Chem, 
Samsung, Panasonic, NEC, and Sanyo have demonstrated printed flexible bat-
teries in numerous consumer electronics expos over the last couple of years. 
The interest from academia and industry demonstrates that there is going be a 
large demand for printed flexible batteries in the near future.
The term ‘printed battery’ is used to describe a battery in which most of the 
components of the battery are deposited with an additive printing technology. 
Printed batteries are available in a variety of designs, capacities, shapes and 
chemistries. Table 6.1 gives an overview of the key differences between a con-
ventional and a printed battery. Printed batteries are encapsulated within com-
pliant materials such as plastic, elastomer or metal‐laminated plastic, whereas 
conventional batteries are encapsulated in rigid metal casings. The capacities 
of printed batteries are much lower in comparison to conventional batteries. 
An Li Ion battery inside a mobile phone has a capacity in the range of 3000 
mAh whereas a printed battery with a similar footprint would have a capacity 
in the range 50 to 100 mAh. The volumetric energy densities of printed batter-
ies are much lower in comparison to conventional batteries. In many designs

the encapsulation layer is as thick as the thickness of the active components, 
which reduces the volume occupied by the active material. Most printed bat-
teries are flexible to some extent due to their thin form factor and flexible 
encapsulation material. The capacity retention after flexing depends on the 
design of the battery.
In this chapter, we will focus on the applications of printed batteries. We 
would like to point out to readers that the field of printed batteries is still in its 
early stages of development. Applications discussed in this chapter are based 
on products that are mostly likely to benefit from the characteristics of printed 
batteries. We divide this chapter into five sections. In the first section, we will 
discuss the applications of microbatteries. These batteries have a footprint in 
the mm2 range and they are useful for powering devices with a very small foot-
print. In the second section, we will discuss the applications of thin printed 
primary batteries. These batteries are thin, cheap, easy to fabricate, and useful 
for powering disposable types of electronics. In the third section, we will 
­discuss the applications of high‐performance rechargeable flexible batteries. 
These batteries have electrochemical performance comparable to conventional 
batteries. These batteries can be embedded within current generations of 
wearable products and enable new product designs, designs which are not pos-
sible with conventional batteries. In the fourth section, we will discuss the use 
of printing technologies to fabricate structured electrodes. The structured 
design helps to improve the energy density and rate performance of the current 
generation of batteries. In the fifth section, we will discuss the power electron-
ics required for charging printed batteries with harvesters.
6.1  ­Printed Microbatteries
The advances in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), sensing technolo-
gies, and low‐power wireless communications have made it possible to design 
sensing nodes with a footprint of less than 1 cm2 [13]. A typical autonomous 
sensing node contains a couple of sensors, memory, microcontroller, wireless

communication, and battery. A large number of these low‐cost wireless nodes 
can be distributed around factories, offices, and homes for sensing and actua-
tion purposes. For example, in a large factory manufacturing a moisture‐sensi-
tive product, a network of low‐cost sensing nodes can be distributed around 
the factory to monitor the humidity level. If the humidity level deviates from a 
set range, the node can send a signal to a central control unit to take action. In 
another possible application, a number of temperature sensors can be distrib-
uted in an office. In a large space it is very common to experience hot and cold 
zones due to uneven air circulation. By mapping the temperature with a net-
work of temperature sensors, the air circulation can be adjusted to ensure that 
all the regions in the office are at the same temperature. Such a sensor can also 
be designed to track the number of occupants in the room. If the room is 
empty, the heating/cooling can be turned off. Wireless nodes are also finding 
applications in large chemical and petrochemical plants to track the health of 
the pumps, pipes, and reactors. Once a problem is detected, the sensor node 
can notify the maintenance crew to check the equipment and perform neces-
sary repairs. Such sensors can help prevent a potential shutdown of the plant 
due to equipment failure.
The early generations of wireless sensors were large enough to support a 
large cylindrical or coin cell. With advances in microfabrication technologies, 
future generations of wireless nodes are expected to be much smaller in size. 
For these applications, even the smallest available coin cells in the market are 
too large in size [5, 14–16]. The need to power micro‐sensing nodes drove the 
early research efforts in developing microbatteries. Bates et al. from the Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory demonstrated the first thin film lithium batteries 
[17]. In a thin film battery, all the components of the battery, the current col-
lectors, anode, cathode, and separator are deposited at high temperature with 
a combination of sputtering and vapor deposition processes. Figure  6.1(a) 
shows a cross‐section of the thin film lithium battery. The battery is supported 
on a rigid support. These batteries are also referred to as solid‐state batteries 
since all the components of the battery are in solid state. Figure 6.1(b) shows 
the discharge curves of the battery with a footprint of 1 cm2 at various C‐rates. 
The average areal capacity of the battery is around 0.1 mAh/cm2 at a voltage of 
3.95 V. The solid‐state nature of the active layers and the separator limits the 
speed at which lithium ions can move in the battery. The thicknesses of the 
electrodes are limited to 3 to 5 micron to reduce mechanical stresses and 
reduce polarization during charging and discharging. Even with the advantage 
of high temperature stability, and thin form factor, thin film batteries are not 
suitable for many applications due to their low capacities and high cost of 
production.
The disadvantages and cost constraints of solid‐state microbatteries were 
addressed by taking advantage of printing technologies to fabricate microbat-
teries [2, 5, 15, 16, 18]. Printing processes are well developed, and inexpensive, 
and only the required amount of material is deposited over the target area. 

Printed Batteries
148
The energy and material consumption required for fabricating printed batter-
ies is much lower in comparison to that of solid‐state batteries. Printed micro-
batteries can be easily customized based on the space available for the battery 
and the power requirements of the device. The groups of Prof. Paul Wright and 
James Evans at the University of California, Berkeley, produced initial demon-
strations of printed microbatteries [2, 3, 15, 19–21]. A dispenser‐based print-
ing technology was adopted to fabricate the printed microbatteries. The 
fabrication process starts by formulating slurries for the anode, cathode, and

Steingart et al. demonstrated a dispenser‐printed Li Ion polymer microbat-
tery [2]. In this design, a pre‐patterned copper pad on a printed circuit board 
(PCB) served as a support for the printed layers and as a current collector for 
the cathode. The fabrication process was carried out by sequentially printing 
mesocarbon micro beads (MCMB), an ionic liquid with PVDF and lithium 
cobalt oxide (LCO). Figure  6.3(a) shows optical images of the battery after 
printing of the graphite, PVDF, and LCO layers. This was one of the earliest 
demonstrations of dispenser‐printed Li Ion microbatteries in which the micro-
battery was printed directly on a circuit board. This technology can be used to 
print batteries over dead spaces on a printed circuit board. Christine Ho et al. 
demonstrated a novel chemistry based on Zn‐MnO2 and an ionic liquid as the 
electrolyte [3]. The battery was fabricated with dispenser‐printing technology. 
Thin nickel foils served as the current collector and a support for the MnO2 
electrode. The battery was fabricated by sequentially printing the MnO2, 
PVDF‐HFP‐ionic liquid, and Zn ink on the nickel foil. Figures 6.3(b) and (c) 
show the schematic of the fabrication process and cross‐sectional SEM micro-
graph of the battery. The thickness of the battery ranged 80–120 microns. The 
total footprint of the cell was 0.25 cm2. Figure 6.3(d) shows the discharge char-
acteristics of the battery. The voltage of the charged battery was around 1.8 V 
and it dropped to 0.4 V at the end of discharge. The capacity of the battery after 
the activation process was around 1.0 mAh/cm2. The technology was spun‐out

are very high, which can lead to significant energy losses due to polarization. 
Polarization can induce side‐reaction within the battery and reduce the life-
time of the battery. In order to reduce polarization in microbatteries and enable 
high discharge rates, a concept of 3‐D architecture was applied to printed 
microbatteries [8, 13, 16, 19, 22–26]. In a 3‐D battery, the rate capability of the 
battery is improved by increasing the overall surface area of the electrode and 
by reducing the distance between the anode and cathode. The group of Prof. 
Jennifer Lewis at the University of Illinois demonstrated the first all‐printed 
three‐dimensional interdigitated Li Ion battery [8, 16]. The components of the 
battery were deposited with a custom dispenser‐printer. Multiple layers of the 
active materials were deposited on top of each other to increase the areal load-
ing of the electrodes. The interdigitated design improved the rate capabilities 
of the battery. Figure 6.4(a)–(d) shows the schematic of the fabrication process. 
The process starts by evaporating and patterning gold electrodes on a glass 
substrate to form the current collectors for the anode and cathode. Thick slur-
ries of lithium iron phosphate and lithium titanate oxide were printed on the 
gold electrodes with a dispenser‐printer. The slurries were formulated to 
ensure they retained their tubular shape after dispensing from the needle. 
Multiple layers of the electrodes were printed on top of each other. The battery 
is encapsulated within a PMMA‐based enclosure. Figures  6.4(e) and 6.4(f) 
show SEM micrograph of the electrodes after the deposition process. 
Figure 6.4(g) shows the discharge capacities of the batteries with 8 and 16 lay-
ers of electrodes at various discharge rates. Figure 6.4(h) shows the optical 
image of the battery after encapsulation. Such battery can be used as a power 
source for sensing nodes that required large quantities of power but have a 
small volume.
There are a number of challenges that need to be addressed before printed 
microbatteries can be adopted in commercial products. Most printed micro-
batteries demonstrated in the literature are based on dispenser‐printing tech-
nology [1]. Dispenser‐printing is slow in comparison to traditional large‐area 
printing methods such as slot‐die and gravure printing. Printed microbatteries 
can benefit from the development of new printing technology, which will speed 
up the fabricating process [1]. Currently the size of the encapsulation for 
microbatteries is much larger than the size of the battery. The development of 
a thin printable encapsulation material is necessary to reduce the volume of the 
battery.

as toys, radios, watches, and cameras before the introduction of Ni‐MH and Li 
Ion batteries. One of the early demonstrations of a printed primary battery was 
the ‘Flat‐Pack Zinc‐Manganese Dioxide P‐80 Battery’ developed by Polaroid in 
the early 1970s for their Instant Camera line of products [27]. Figure 6.5(a) 
shows the cross‐section schematic of the P‐80 battery. The major innovation in 
this product was integration of a flat battery with the film pack. Until recently

it was very common for the user to carry an extra set of batteries while operat-
ing a camera. The integration of the battery with the film pack meant that the 
user did not have to worry about carrying extra batteries. The flat battery 
design was a major engineering achievement. Most primary batteries at the 
time utilized a cylindrical or coin cell design, in which the active component of 
the battery was supported inside a rigid metal casing. The flat‐shaped batteries 
helped to reduce the total volume occupied by the battery and allowed for easy 
integration of the battery with the photographic films. The battery pack con-
sisted of four cells connected in series to increase the voltage of the battery to 
6.0 V. The fabrication process started by coating a vinyl film with a conductive 
material to serve as the current collector for the anode and cathode. Slurries of 
MnO2 and Zn were deposited on the vinyl film with slot‐die coating to serve as 
the cathode and anode of the battery, respectively. A cellophane film was 
placed between the anode and cathode to serve as the separator. The battery 
pack was encapsulated within aluminum casing to protect the battery. The 
theoretical capacity of the battery was around 270 mAh. Figure 6.5(b) shows 
the discharge characteristics of the battery at various discharge rates. While 
taking a photograph, the battery was discharged at a rate of 2 A for 50 ms. The 
battery pack was engineered to provide high pulses of power, which was neces-
sary for powering the flash. The use of the flat battery packs was limited to the 
Polaroid cameras. In the late 2000s there was a reemergence of interest in flat 
printed primary batteries.
The availability of low‐cost microelectronics, and advances in printed elec-
tronics led to the development of low‐cost, disposable types of electronics for 
environmental sensing, activity tracking, and health monitoring purposes [28]. 
Primary batteries are more suitable than rechargeable batteries since these 
devices have a lifetime of a few days to a week. After the end of use, users can 
dispose of the sensor. Figure  6.6(a) shows a schematic of a printed battery 
­laminated with a flexible electronic circuit. Figure 6.6(b) shows an example of 
a printed temperature sensor which can be placed on a human body to meas-
ure body temperature. In another example, a temperature sensor can be placed 
on temperature‐sensitive produce or goods during shipping. The sensor can 
periodically transmit data to a mobile phone or control unit via a Bluetooth 
connection. In this type of sensor, a primary printed battery can be laminated 
with the sensor to power the electronics and communication. There is also 
considerable research effort into developing disposable tattoo‐like sensors for 
measuring biological signals from human skin such as glucose and lactate lev-
els during exercise (Figure 6.6(c)) [29]. The sensor works by measuring the 
concentration of glucose and lactate biomarkers in the sweat. If the level falls 
beyond a set limit, the user will be notified. Primary printed batteries are 
advantageous for these applications, since they are much safer in comparison 
to Li Ion batteries and they can be easily customized based on the require-
ments of the application.

Applications of Printed Batteries

With the hope of taking advantage of this market, companies such as Enfucell 
and Blue Spark commercialized printed primary batteries in the late 2000s. 
The battery designs adopt conventional zinc‐carbon chemistry. A conductive 
carbon paste is used to serve as the current collector for the anode and cath-
ode. The impedance of these batteries is generally high (100 ohm) in compari-
son to conventional batteries (0.5 ohm) due to the low conductivity of the 
carbon electrode. These batteries are well suited for applications that required 
low amounts of power for extended periods of time. The typical voltage of a 
primary battery is around 1.5 to 1.65 V. The thickness of the battery ranges 
from 500 to 800 micron. Commercially available printed batteries are flexible 
to some extent due to their thin form factor but they are not designed for 
repeated flexing and twisting. Since the early 2010s there has been tremendous 
interest in academia in the design and fabrication of printed flexible primary 
batteries.
Pritesh et al. from the University of Cambridge in collaboration with Nokia 
Research Labs demonstrated one of the early designs of a printed flexible alka-
line battery [30]. Figures  6.7(a) and 6.7(b) show the schematic and optical 
image of the battery, respectively. In this design, an electrospun carbon fiber 
electrode was used as the current collector for the MnO2 electrode. During the 
printing process a part of the slurry was embedded inside the carbon fiber 
sheet, which improved the flexibility and adhesion of the electrode. A thin zinc 
sheet served as the anode in the battery. Due to the high conductivity of the 
zinc foil, no additional current collector was necessary. A dry TiO2‐doped 
PEO‐based solid‐state electrolyte was developed to serve as a separator 
between the electrodes. Figure 6.7(c) shows the discharge curves of the battery

with varying thickness of the carbon fiber. The ohmic resistance in the battery 
decreases with varying diameter of the carbon fiber. Figure 6.7(d) shows the 
performance of the battery when the battery was flexed to various bending 
radii. The battery was stable until a bending radius of 4 cm, beyond which 
cracking and delamination of the electrode occurred, which led to fluctuation 
of voltage during discharge. Delamination and cracking of the electrode are the 
most common modes of failure in printed batteries during flexing. Delamination 
increases ohmic losses within the battery, which decreases the energy density 
of the battery. Cracking increases particle‐to‐particle resistance and under cer-
tain conditions a part of the active layer can lose electrical contact with the rest 
of the layer, which reduces the capacity of the battery. The problem of delami-
nation and cracking gets worse as the thickness of the electrode is increased or 
when the batteries are flexed to a lower bending radius.
Gaikwad et  al. demonstrated a unique mesh‐embedded electrode design, 
wherein the active layer of the battery was embedded inside a mesh [11]. 
Figure  6.8(a) shows a schematic of the process flow of creating the mesh‐
embedded electrodes. The mesh provides support and reinforcement for the 
active layers. With the mesh design the active layer can be completely folded 
without any delamination or cracking of the electrode. The fabrication process 
starts by dip coating the mesh with a slurry of the active material, followed by 
printing of a thin layer of silver ink over the electrodes to serve as the current 
collector of the electrodes. The printed current collector improves adhesion to 
the active layer and is more flexible in comparison to metal foils. Figures 6.8(b) 
and 6.8(c) show the discharge curves of the battery at various C‐rates and the 
capacity retention of the battery when the battery is flexed at various bending 
radii. Figure 6.8(d) shows the battery with mesh‐embedded electrodes power-
ing a green‐LED even after the battery is completely folded. A non‐woven 
fabric can also be used in the place of a mesh. In both designs, the capacity of 
the battery depends on the thickness and the porosity of the support. The areal 
capacity and rate capabilities of the battery depend on the thickness of the 
support. Figures 6.8(e) and 6.8(f) show a flexible battery pack consisting of 
two cells stacked in series, which is integrated with an interactive strain sensor. 
When the sensor is flat the blue‐LED display shows FLAT and when the sensor 
is flexed, the display shows BEND [31]. The flexible battery pack is used to 
power both the display and the microcontroller.
Electronics based on solution‐processed organic transistors have been of 
interest since the early 1990s for application in flexible and large‐area sensing 
[32–34]. Solution‐based processing enables the fabrication of electronics from 
inks with the help of conventional high‐speed printing technologies. Transistors 
are the basic building blocks of electronic circuits. Over the last 20 years, there 
has been tremendous progress in the design and synthesis of high mobility, 
oxygen‐stable, n‐ and p‐type organic semiconductors, which have reduced the 
operating voltages of transistors considerably [35]. However, in order to

improve the device yield and decrease device‐to‐device variability, the channel 
lengths and dielectric thicknesses in most printed circuits are still very large. 
The potential of a battery ranges from 1.5 to 4.2 V, which is lower than the 
voltage required for powering printed circuits. A DC‐DC converter can 
increase the output voltage from the battery to the desired levels, but DC‐DC 
converters are often inefficient and require the addition of more components 
into the system, and are therefore not recommended. It would be beneficial to 
fabricate a high voltage printed battery pack which can be laminated with the 
organic circuit (Figure  6.9(a)). Gaikwad et  al. demonstrated a high voltage  
Zn‐MnO2 flexible battery where ten Zn‐MnO2 cells were printed on a porous 
substrate and connected in series to increase the voltage of the battery [18]. 
The schematic and photograph of the battery are shown in Figure 6.9(b). In

with stencil printing. Silver ink was spray printed on the electrodes to form the 
current collectors. A hydrophobic amorphous Teflon dispersion was dis-
penser‐printed between the electrodes to serve as a hydrophobic barrier for 
the aqueous electrolyte and prevent ionic contact between neighboring cells. 
The cells were connected in series by spray printing silver interconnects 
between the cells. After each printing step, the substrate was heated in an oven 
to dry the ink. A polymer gel electrolyte of KOH and ZnO was dispenser‐
printed on the electrodes and the substrate was folded along the dotted line to 
activate the battery. The design demonstrated by Gaikwad et al. can be easily 
adopted in a roll‐to‐roll fabrication process. Since all the cells of the battery are 
fabricated on a single substrate, the fabrication process was greatly simplified. 
The use of a printed Teflon barrier for the electrolyte reduced the dead space 
related to encapsulating each cell separately. The high voltage flexible battery 
was used to power an all‐printed five‐stage ring oscillator. The oscillator was 
fabricated with an inkjet printing process. Figure  6.9(c) shows the optical 
micrograph of the printed oscillator. The battery was used to power the oscil-
lator for a period of 15 minutes (Figure 6.9(d)). With an input voltage of 14 V, 
an oscillatory output with a frequency of 100 Hz was observed. During the 
period of 15 minutes, the voltage of the battery remained the same since a very 
low current was required to drive the circuit.
At this point, primary printed battery technology is mature. In the last couple 
of years there have been numerous demonstrations by printed battery startup 
companies on the possible applications of disposable printed batteries. Products 
such as temperature sensors, smart tags, and golf swing trackers were demon-
strated in collaboration with electronics companies. Currently there still is not 
a product available in the market that has achieved commercial success. The 
future of primary printed batteries will depend primarily on the development of 
new products and devices that leverage their unique characteristics.
6.3  ­Printed Rechargeable Batteries
The tremendous interest in wrist‐worn health and fitness trackers and smart 
watches drew early efforts to develop printed rechargeable batteries as a poten-
tial power source to replace rigid Li Ion batteries [1, 28, 36]. Presently, the size 
of wearable devices is dictated by the size of the battery. It is not uncommon to 
see the battery taking up more than half the volume of the device. The availa-
bility of a high‐performance, flexible, rechargeable printed battery opens up 
the opportunity to embed a battery within the strap of the watch. Such a design 
can help to reduce the overall thickness of the smart watch. Flexible batteries 
can also enable new product designs which were not possible previously. Other 
potential applications of rechargeable printed batteries include smart bank-
cards, smart labels, foldable devices, smart clothing, and tattoo‐like sensors.

The first activity trackers were available in the market in the late 2000s. 
These devices were clip‐on devices, which could be attached to clothing or 
embedded within shoes. A typical activity tracker contains a 3‐axis accelerom-
eter to track the movement of the user, gyroscope to measure orientation and 
rotation, microcontroller to process signals, rechargeable Li Ion battery to 
power the electronics, and Bluetooth to transmit the data. The raw data from 
the accelerometer and gyroscope are analyzed with an algorithm and converted 
to useful data such as the number of steps taken, total active time and calories 
burned. A simple activity tracker with a small LED display has a power con-
sumption of around 5 to 15 mAh/day. Most activity trackers are powered with 
a small pouch‐type Li Ion battery with a capacity in the range 30 to 70 mAh. 
On a single charge, the tracker can run for a period of 5 to 7 days. The clip‐on 
activity trackers were soon replaced with wrist‐worn activity trackers and 
smart watches. The barrier to adoption for the wrist‐based devices was low 
since consumers were accustomed to wearing watches on their wrist. The first 
smart watches were introduced in the market in 2012. In addition to tracking 
activity levels and having Bluetooth connection, a smart watch contains a large 
color display, pulse sensor, GPS, and a media player. Smart watches are pow-
ered by Li Ion batteries with capacities in the range of 250 to 400 mAh. Smart 
watches typically last for a day on a single charge. The excessive use of the GPS 
function or the media player can drain the battery completely in a couple of 
hours. Nowadays, many smart watches have fast‐charging capabilities, whereby 
the battery can be charged to 70–80% of its capacity within 30 minutes. 
Electronics companies such as Samsung, LG, and Philips have shown numer-
ous demonstrations of futuristic, completely flexible devices such as bendable 
phones, displays, and tattoo‐like health sensors. Excitement around these 
products galvanized research efforts into printed rechargeable batteries. Fully 
flexible devices are still in the early stages of development and are not expected 
to be available commercially for the next couple of years. In the meantime, 
wrist‐worn devices are expected to be the primary consumers of printed 
rechargeable batteries. Currently, the electronics in smart watches are inte-
grated on a rigid board with a footprint of a couple of cm2 and a soft elasto-
meric strap is used to hold the sensor around the wrist. The straps have a total 
area in the range of 5–7 inch2 and a thickness of 3–5 mm. Based on the avail-
able volume, a thin flexible printed battery with a capacity in the range around 
50–100 mAh can be easily embedded inside the strap [37]. These batteries can 
serve as a primary power source for the simple activity trackers, or as a second-
ary back‐up power source for smart watches that require higher battery capac-
ity. Improving total battery capacity is particularly important for high‐end 
smart watches since they last for less than a day on a single charge. In addition, 
it may be possible to design a system wherein the straps are attached to the 
sensor with a magnetic holder. If the battery in the device dies, the user can 
replace the dead batteries with charged ones and continue using the device. 

Printed Batteries
162
A printed battery, when worn around the wrist, will experience compressive 
and tensile stresses which can lead to delamination of the active layer from the 
current collector film, swelling of the active layer, or loss of contact between 
the separator film and the electrode. Printed batteries for bendable applica-
tions should be designed to reduce mechanical stresses and prevent mechani-
cal failures. Researchers have demonstrated numerous innovative designs to 
prevent cracking and delamination of the active layers. Some of the novel 
designs will be discussed in this section.
Liangbing Hu et al. reported one of the early designs of a printed rechargea-
ble Li Ion battery [38]. In this design, the metal current collector foil was 
replaced with a carbon nanotube film to improve the flexibility of the elec-
trode. Figures 6.10(a) and 6.10b show the schematic of the fabrication process. 
The fabrication process starts by blade coating carbon nanotube (CNT) solu-
tion on a stainless steel film, followed by blade coating slurries of the active 
layer (lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) or lithium titanate oxide (LTO)) on top of the 
CNT film. The CNT active layer film is removed from the stainless steel foil by 
a transfer process in water. The anode and cathode films are attached on either 
side of a Xerox paper with a PVDF binder. The Xerox paper serves as a separa-
tor between the anode and cathode, and a support for the electrodes. 
Figure 6.10(c) shows a photograph of the battery after the lamination process. 
Figure 6.10(d) shows a cross‐section SEM micrograph of the electrode show-
ing the interlayer between the current collector, active layer, and separator 
film. Figure 6.10(e) shows the charge–discharge characteristics of the battery. 
The battery retained its electrochemical performance even after repeated flex-
ing cycles. Figure 6.10(f) shows a photograph of the battery powering a red‐
LED even under flexed state. This was one of the early demonstrations of using 
carbon nanotubes in a battery to improve its flexibility.
Carbon‐based current collector electrodes have a lower conductivity in com-
parison to metal foils, which can lead to ohmic potential drops at high C‐rates. 
To reduce ohmic potential drops, the conductivity of the flexible current col-
lector films should be comparable to metal foils. Towards this goal, Lee et al. 
demonstrated a printed Li Ion battery where a nickel‐coated textile film served 
as the current collector for the battery [39]. Figure 6.11(a) shows a schematic of 
the battery with nickel‐coated textile as the current collector. Figure 6.11(c) 
shows the SEM micrograph of the nickel‐coated textile fabric. The nickel is 
deposited on the textile fabric with an electroless deposition process. The 
design takes advantage of the fibrous structure of the fabric. A part of the active 
layers gets embedded within the fabric, which improves the adhesion between 
the current collector and active layer. The electrodes were highly flexible and 
no delamination or cracking occurred even after repeated folding and unfold-
ing cycles. Figure 6.11(b) shows the textile after depositing of the metal and the 
slurry. Figures 6.11(d) and 6.11(e) show a comparison between a battery with 
the textile current collector and one with conventional metal foil, respectively.

The battery with standard current collector foil failed after repeated flexing, 
while the textile battery retained its capacity. The textile batteries are suitable 
for powering watches and smart clothing. Figures 6.12(a) and 6.12(b) show the 
integration of the textile battery with clothing and smart watches.
The authors used this technology to develop large‐area flexible battery mod-
ules with output voltages of 7.5 and 30 V by integrating multiple batteries in 
series [40]. Figure 6.13(a) shows an illustration of a high voltage battery mod-
ule, which can be rolled up when not in use. Figure 6.13(b) shows details of the 
battery module. The performance of the battery module was comparable to the 
performance of individual cells. High voltage flexible battery modules are use-
ful for powering applications that require high driving voltages. Figure 6.13(c) 
shows the integration of the high voltage textile battery module with a tent. 
Figure  6.13(d) shows the integration of the battery module with window 
binder. The battery module can be used to store energy generated by flexible 
solar cells.
The use of thin metal foils in printed flexible batteries has been limited due 
to the sharp edges of the foil, which are likely to penetrate through the separa-
tor and create a short. Choi et al. solved this problem by developing a coplanar 
battery architecture [41]. Figures 6.14(a) and 14(b) show an optical image and 
schematic of the interdigitated battery. In this design, the slurries for the anode 
and cathode are deposited on conventional metal foils. The electrodes are then 
cut into fork‐shaped patterns with a custom‐designed knife. The anode and

cathode electrodes are then placed in an interdigitated design and encapsu-
lated within metal‐laminated pouches. Two batteries are connected in series to 
form a flexible battery module with an output voltage of 7.4 V. This design 
helps to prevent shorting of the battery during flexing. The authors demon-
strated numerous applications of the coplanar batteries. Due to their thin form 
factor, these batteries are suitable for smart card applications. Figures 6.15(a), 
6.15(b) and 6.15(c) show the integration of the battery with a wrinkle‐smooth-
ing cosmetic patch, smart bank cards and smart watches, respectively.
For many wearable applications such as smart clothing, tattoo‐like sensors 
and health trackers, in addition to flexibility, stretchability is necessary to ensure 
conformal contact between the device and body [8, 42, 43]. Stretchable batteries 
are difficult to design and in the past couple of years there have only been a 
handful of stretchable batteries reported in the literature [12, 44–46]. Kettlgruber 
et  al. demonstrated a rechargeable stretchable Zn‐MnO2 battery where the 
active layers were embedded inside a nickel mesh [47]. Figure 6.16(a) shows a

and encapsulation for the battery. The battery retained its capacity even after 
stretching the battery to a strain of 75% (Figure 6.16(b)). The accessible capacity 
of the battery dropped by 50% after 100 electrochemical cycles due to irrevers-
ible reaction on the cathode side. Figure  6.16(c) and 6.16(d) show optical 
images of the battery before and after stretching, respectively. The voltage of the 
battery remained constant even after stretching. The group of Prof. Hanqing 
Jiang from Arizona State University demonstrated a novel battery design based 
on the ancient Chinese art of kirigami [48, 49]. In this design, thin metal foils are 
cut in predetermined patterns which allow them to stretch and twist, in‐plane 
or out‐of‐plane. Once the current collector is cut, the slurry of cathode and 
anode are printed over the current collector foils and dried. The electrodes are 
stacked together with a thin porous separator between the anode and cathode, 
and encapsulated within metal‐laminated pouches. Figures 6.17(a) and 6.17(b) 
show optical images of the kirigami battery under the compressed and most 
stretched state. The kirigami battery was able to continuously power a Samsung 
Galaxy Gear smart watch even after stretching of the battery (Figures 6.17(c) 
and 6.17(d)). Figures 6.17(e) and 6.17(f) show discharge curves of the kirigami 
battery discharged at 2.9 and 48 mA, respectively, representing the standby 
mode and watching a video on the watch.
Printed rechargeable Li Ion batteries are going to play an important role in 
the success of flexible electronics. Printed Li Ion batteries benefit directly from 
the developments in rigid Li Ion batteries because new materials, electrode 
designs, and additives can be easily applied to the printed Li Ion batteries. 
Currently the areal capacities of printed Li Ion batteries are much lower than 
those of conventional batteries. The development of new battery designs 
described in the following section can increase the areal capacities of the bat-
teries and make them more attractive for commercial products.
6.4  ­High‐Performance Printed Structured Batteries
The high energy density and long cycle life of Li Ion batteries have made them 
the primary choice of battery chemistry for powering consumer electronics 
and electric vehicles (EV). The conventional Li Ion battery adopts a ‘jellyroll’ 
design, in which thin foils of copper and aluminum serve as the current collec-
tor for the anode and cathode, respectively. Slurries of the anode and cathode 
material are deposited on the current collector foils with the slot‐die printing 
method. The anode, separator, and cathode layers are stacked together and 
winded to form a ‘jellyroll’ [50]. The jellyroll is soaked with an electrolyte solu-
tion containing lithium salt and encapsulated under compression within 
metal‐laminated pouches [13]. Even though the basic design of an Li Ion bat-
tery has remained the same over the last 25 years, a year‐by‐year increase in 
energy density of around 5 to 10% has been consistently achieved by the

shrinking of the thickness of the inactive components, and incremental 
improvements in the material design. The thickness of the current collector 
and separator films in the early generations of Li Ion batteries were around 30 
to 50 micron. In the current state‐of‐the‐art Li Ion batteries, the thickness of 
the current collector and polymer separator films is as low as 5 micron. The 
transition from metal casings to metal‐laminated pouches in the early 2010s 
also played an important role in improving the energy density of Li Ion batter-
ies. The pouch architecture allows for custom designs based on the power 
requirements of the device. Many mobile products such as cell phones, tablets, 
and laptops have shifted to non‐replaceable pouch batteries in recent years, in 
which the battery is fixed to the circuit board. This design helps to reduce the 
overall volume of the product. Battery packs are quickly reaching the limits of 
practical energy density possible by the engineering route. A leap from the 
current technology will require new battery designs and advances in novel 
chemistries such as magnesium‐ion, lithium‐air and lithium‐sulfur batteries. 
New battery technologies generally take a very long time to develop and com-
mercialize. In the meantime, battery engineers are investigating novel printing 
technologies as a tool to fabricate structured battery electrodes to improve the 
rate performance and energy density of Li Ion batteries.
A battery electrode is composed of electrochemically active materials mixed 
with carbon‐based conductive additive, and a polymeric binder to hold the 
electrode together. After the slurry is deposited on the current collector foil 
and dried, a porous structure is formed. The electrodes are calendared (com-
pressed) to a porosity of 20–30% to increase their density and particle‐to‐par-
ticle contact [51–54]. The percolative network of pores between the solid 
particles is filled with an electrolyte solution. The energy density of the batter-
ies can be improved by further increasing the density of the active layers or the 
thickness of the electrodes. As the porosity of the electrode is reduced, the 
tortuosity increases, which increases the distance the lithium ions have to 
travel as they move between the anode and cathode. For battery electrodes 
with fast reaction kinetics and high electrical conductivity, the rate perfor-
mance is limited by the diffusion of lithium ions through the electrolyte [55]. 
The increase in tortuosity of the electrode will increase polarization losses at 
high rates. On the other hand, increasing the thickness of the electrodes can 
increase the fraction of the volume occupied by the active materials in the bat-
tery. But electrodes beyond 100 micron are mechanically weak, which can 
reduce the calendaring life of the battery. The effective tortuosity of the battery 
also increases with the thickness of the electrode, which degrades the rate per-
formance of the battery. Hence increasing the density or thickness of the elec-
trode may not be a viable option for increasing the energy density of the battery, 
in particularly for applications where high discharge rates are required.
Researchers are actively looking into printing technology as a tool to fabri-
cate battery electrodes with structured designs [2, 8, 16, 19]. In a conventional 

Printed Batteries
172
battery electrode, the density and porosity of the active layer is homogeneous 
throughout the battery. Additive printing technology opens up the possibility 
of fabricating electrodes with a gradient of porosity and conductivity across its 
thickness. Such a design can help to improve the energy density and rate capa-
bilities of the batteries. In an Li Ion battery, the reaction boundary during 
charge and discharge processes starts at the interface near the separator and 
then moves toward the current collector. At high C‐rates, a part of the elec-
trode near the current collector does not take part in the reactions due to slow 
diffusion of Li Ion through the electrolyte phase. By using printing technolo-
gies, a structured electrode can be fabricated to overcome the diffusion limita-
tions and increase utilization of the electrode. For example, Figure  6.18(a) 
shows design of an electrode in which the density of electrode changes along 
its thickness such that the electrode near the separator is more porous in com-
parison to the material near the current collector. Such a design can help with 
the transport of Li Ion between the electrodes and increase utilization at high 
rates. A similar concept can also be used to vary the electrical conductivity 
across the electrode such that the interface near the separator is more conduc-
tive than the region close to the current collector, to ensure that current can be 
easily passed and removed from regions away from the current collector. 
The  porosity or conductivity variation in the electrode can be achieved by 
printing multiple layers of slurries with different formulations on top of each 
other. The conductivity and porosity of the electrode can be changed by

varying the weight of carbon additive and solvent content. Printed structured 
electrodes can also be used to improve the mechanical flexibility of batteries. 
Repeated flexing leads to swelling of the electrodes, which can lead to a loss in 
particle‐to‐particle contact and delamination of the electrodes. The mechani-
cal degradation due to flexing can be prevented by printing islands of the active 
material on the foils rather than printing a homogenous layer (Figure 6.18(b)). 
The gap between the islands can serve as a buffer to absorb the stresses during 
flexing. The gap can also help to increase the rate capability of the battery by 
providing pathways for rapid diffusion of Li Ion through the electrodes.
Researchers at Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) developed a co‐extrusion 
method to deposit high aspect ratio electrodes at print speeds of 20 cm/s 
[19, 56]. This technology was initially developed to deposit high aspect ratio silver 
electrodes to serve as interconnects in silicon solar cells. The printer head was 
later modified to print battery slurries. Figure 6.19(a) shows a schematic of the 
co‐extrusion print head. The printer was designed to print thick electrodes with

alternating strips of high‐ and low‐density regions (Figure 6.19(b)). The high‐
density regions are energy dense and store the bulk of the energy of the battery. 
The narrow low‐density regions have low tortuosity, and they provide pathways 
for fast Li Ion diffusion through the electrode. With the multi‐porosity design, 
the thickness and the energy density of the electrodes can be increased without 
affecting the rate performance of the batteries. Using this concept, the volumet-
ric energy density of the battery can be increased by 10% by increasing the 
thickness of the electrodes without affecting rate performance.
There are a number of challenges battery engineers must solve before struc-
tured electrodes can be used in commercial batteries. The primary challenge is 
the cost of the battery. Presently the money and time cost of printed structured 
electrodes is high in comparison to that of slot‐die printed electrodes. Any 
increase in production time will add to the cost of the battery. Batteries with 
structured electrodes should present at least a 10–15% improvement in energy 
density before they will be economically viable for adoption by battery manu-
facturers. The calendaring life of the battery is closely related to the mechanical 
strength of the electrodes. The strength of the electrode decreases exponen-
tially as the thickness of the electrode is increased beyond a limit of 60 to 
80 microns. The battery should be designed carefully based on the application 
to prevent any mechanical degradation during use.
6.5  ­Power Electronics and Energy Harvesting
When designing a battery system for a given application, one essential choice 
is whether to use a primary or secondary battery. Primary batteries based on 
stable and low‐cost alkaline chemistries are of great interest for powering dis-
posable electronics, such as smart labels and some medical devices. Many 
reusable consumer electronics also rely on primary batteries with standardized 
dimensions, such as coin cells and AA cells, which must be replaced periodi-
cally by the user. Replacing a printed and flexible battery is less straightforward 
since standardized flexible battery shapes do not yet exist. Therefore, if the 
desired product life is longer than the battery life, it is preferable to use a sec-
ondary (rechargeable) battery instead.
To charge secondary batteries, many options are available. Wired charging, 
for example, using the universal serial bus (USB) standard, is commonly used 
for batteries in consumer electronics. However, some systems, such as flexible 
or stretchable wearable electronics and electronics which may be exposed to 
water, cannot tolerate bulky USB connectors or exposed metal. The batteries in 
these systems can still be charged on demand using wireless methods such 
as inductive charging or radio frequency (RF) power transmission. Batteries 
can also be charged with energy‐harvesting devices that collect energy from 
ambient sources such as light, heat, and motion. Energy harvesting is especially 

Applications of Printed Batteries
175
important for applications such as sensor networks with large numbers of 
nodes or devices in hard‐to‐access locations which must operate for long peri-
ods of time without any user involvement.
Since battery charging requires direct current (DC) and a particular voltage 
range (dependent on the battery chemistry), power electronics are needed 
when these requirements differ from the output characteristics of the energy 
source. If the energy source produces alternating current (AC), for example, a 
rectifier is necessary. Figure 6.20(a) shows a common rectifier circuit, which 
uses a diode bridge to rectify the AC signal and a capacitor to smooth the DC 
output. If the source produces DC power at a different voltage from the bat-
tery, a DC‐DC converter such as the boost converter shown in Figure 6.20(b) 
is  needed. This circuit uses a combination of passive components and two 
transistors switched alternately to convert from a lower voltage to a higher 
voltage. A similar circuit with the input and output reversed can be used to 
convert from a higher to a lower voltage. For sources such as solar cells, which 
produce maximum power at a particular voltage, DC‐DC converters known as 
maximum power point trackers (MPPT) are often used to ensure the device is 
operating at that voltage regardless of the voltage of the battery or load. DC‐DC 
converters can also be connected between the battery and the load, in systems 
where the load requires a well‐regulated voltage or a different voltage than that 
which the battery produces.
Battery management systems (BMS) are also very important to maximize 
the performance and safety of batteries. One critical function of a BMS is to 
terminate charging when the battery reaches its maximum voltage, prevent-
ing over‐voltage from occurring. This can be accomplished using a transistor 
in series between the energy source and the battery or, for current‐limited 
sources, a transistor or diode in parallel with the battery to shunt away excess 
current when the battery is charged. Li Ion battery management systems in

and off at opposite times; the conversion ratio Vin/Vout is controlled by the duty cycle of the

particular often enforce a constant‐current constant‐voltage charging profile, 
charging the battery with a constant current until it reaches its maximum 
voltage, then maintaining that voltage and allowing the current to decay to 
zero. The constant‐current portion charges the battery most of the way at a 
high rate, and the constant‐voltage portion ensures the battery receives a 
complete charge without exceeding its voltage limit. Another important func-
tion of a BMS is to disconnect the load from the battery when the battery 
reaches its minimum voltage, corresponding to the discharged state. Some 
BMSs also monitor the battery temperature and adjust the charging and 
­discharging conditions appropriately.
Typically, these circuits are produced by soldering surface‐mount compo-
nents to a circuit board, but there is growing interest in developing printed and 
flexible components for power electronics. Numerous printed and flexible 
diodes have been reported for rectifier applications. Printed inductors and 
capacitors have been optimized for use in DC‐DC converters and have shown 
performance competitive with their surface‐mount counterparts. Flexible thin 
film transistors (TFTs) have also been employed in a number of power elec-
tronic circuits although further research is required for the TFT performance 
to be competitive with silicon transistors for these applications.
Among energy‐harvesting sources, photovoltaics (PV), which generate elec-
tricity from light, are particularly appealing because the available power density 
from sunlight and even indoor light is relatively large. Each PV cell produces a 
voltage of the order of several tenths of a volt, which varies roughly logarithmi-
cally with illumination. The PV current varies roughly linearly with illumina-
tion, ranging from tens of μA/cm2 under indoor lighting up to tens of mA/cm2 
in full sun. To charge a battery, multiple PV cells are usually connected in series 
to reach the battery voltage. Flexible amorphous silicon PV modules are com-
mercially available and have therefore been utilized alongside batteries in a 
number of energy systems. Figures 6.21(a) and (b) show a flexible energy sys-
tem combining such a module with a printed Li Ion battery in a layered thin film 
structure [37]. The particular PV module was selected because it produces its 
maximum power output when operated over the battery voltage range, under 
both indoor and outdoor illumination conditions, as shown in Figure 6.21(c)–(d), 
allowing the system to operate efficiently without MPPT. There is also a great 
effort toward using solution‐processable materials such as organics and perovs-
kites to fabricate low‐cost printed PV modules. For example, we have developed 
the printed organic PV modules shown in Figure 6.22(a) and integrated them 
with a BMS and a printed Li Ion battery as shown in Figure 6.22(b). Under 
­sunlight, the solar module charges the battery as shown in Figure 6.22(c), with a 
current of approximately 2 mA.
Since many applications of printed batteries involve moving objects, harvest-
ing energy from motion is also of great interest. For example, energy can be

harvested from body motions such as footsteps or movement of joints and 
used to power wearable health sensors. Similarly, energy harvested from vibra-
tions of industrial and manufacturing equipment can be used to power condi-
tion‐monitoring sensors. Two leading methods of harvesting energy from 
movement are piezoelectrics and triboelectrics. Piezoelectric materials change 
their polarization when subjected to an external force, thus creating an electric 
potential in one direction under tension and in the other direction under

compression. A triboelectric generator, on the other hand, employs two mate-
rials, which experience electron transfer when brought into contact. An exam-
ple of a triboelectric generator is shown in Figure 6.23(a), in which nickel‐coated 
fibers and parylene‐coated fibers are woven into a textile. Contact between the 
fibers induces electron transfer from the nickel (blue) to the parylene (yellow); 
when the materials are separated again the electrons flow in the opposite direc-
tion if there is a pathway through an external circuit. Using this triboelectric 
generator, energy from the motion of the arm past the side of the body was 
collected to charge a flexible Li Ion battery integrated into a belt, and to power 
a wearable heartbeat monitor as shown in Figure  6.23(b)–(e). Since most 
motions produce an AC signal, a rectifier such as that shown in Figures 6.20(a) 
and 6.23(d) is needed for battery‐charging applications. These generators tend 
to produce high voltages, often many volts at open circuit, but relatively low 
currents. Therefore, multiple generators are often connected in parallel to 
increase the charging rate.

Human bodies and operating machines also produce heat, which can be har-
vested using thermoelectric generators. Both the voltage and the current pro-
duced by a thermoelectric generator are proportional to the temperature 
difference the device experiences. To harvest a large amount of power, there-
fore, the heat source must have a high temperature and be in good contact with 
one side of the thermoelectric generator, while the opposite side of the genera-
tor must be cooled sufficiently. Thermoelectric generators have been devel-
oped with a number of form factors, including wearable textiles [57–60] and 
patches for harvesting body heat, as well as a variety of rigid and flexible struc-
tures that could be attached to pipes and other equipment. While the flexible 
generators provide excellent conformability to surfaces, they often produce 
only a few millivolts each. Thus, reaching a voltage adequate for battery charg-
ing requires connecting hundreds of generators in series or employing a step‐
up DC‐DC converter. Figure 6.24 shows an example thermoelectric battery 
charging system, consisting of a printed thermoelectric generator, printed bat-
tery, and DC‐DC converter.
Controllable wireless charging methods such as RF and inductive power 
transfer are advantageous when ambient energy sources are unreliable or 
insufficient to meet a system’s demands. In inductive charging, a receiving 
coil in the same package as the battery is brought close (typically within a 
few  millimeters) to a transmitting coil. The magnetic field caused by an 
­alternating current in the transmitting coil induces a current in the receiving 
coil, transferring energy. Inductive charging of printed and flexible batteries 
has been demonstrated using the widely accepted Qi standard as well as cus-
tomized configurations. In RF power transfer, resonant circuits are used to 
transmit and receive power at specified frequencies over longer distances. 
This approach is commonly used to charge the batteries in active radio fre-
quency identification (RFID) tags. Both inductive coils and RF antennas 
can  be readily printed on flexible substrates, enabling integration with 
printed and flexible batteries. In addition to the receiving elements them-
selves, diode rectifiers are needed to produce the DC power required for 
battery charging.
In summary, there are numerous approaches for charging and managing 
printed and flexible batteries. The choice of charging method is highly depend-
ent upon the details of the application, such as the load power consumption, 
desired charging frequency, required form factor, and power density available 
from the various ambient sources. Power electronics, which must be chosen 
appropriately for the energy source, are critical to ensure efficient, safe, and 
reliable battery operation. Finally, novel power electronic circuit topologies 
and physical integration schemes have been developed in order to charge bat-
teries using multiple energy sources, enabling reliable and multifunctional 
power systems.

7.1  ­Introduction
The demand for flexible thin film batteries is increasing as new portable 
­consumer electronics products, wearables as well as medical and pharmaceutical 
sensing devices, are developed, with this predicted to reach market maturity 
within the next few years [1–4]. To meet the requirements of this new category 
of flexible products, the batteries powering these devices also must be flexible. 
Conventional consumer batteries, which had been characterized and optimized 
over decades and thus are reliable power sources, are available in a variety of 
types, sizes, configurations and electrical specifications. Flat cells, cylindrical 
configurations and button configurations of batteries are predominant in the 
household and commercial sectors [5]. With respect to these new applications, 
the disadvantage of conventional batteries is their rigid casings. The integra-
tion of conventional batteries into flexible circuits requires on the one hand the 
use of discontinuous pick‐and‐place technologies, which contradicts a highly 
preferred cost‐effective manufacturing process, while on the other hand, the 
use of conventional batteries in this type of product results in inflexibility 
of the products.
Using printing technologies for the production of thin film batteries offers 
many advantages compared to the conventional coating process [6]. Printing 
technologies are characterized by a large range of freedom with respect to the 
substrates and materials that can be processed. A wide range of polymer‐based 
single‐layered films or multilayered composite substrates with different

properties as regards physical stability as well as gas and vapor permeation rates 
are available on the market. Furthermore, various primary and secondary elec-
trochemical systems where the active masses of the electrodes are transferable 
into printing pastes can be processed by printing technologies. The possibility of 
producing batteries with customized layouts and defined operating voltages, 
capacities and service lives without extensive modification of assembly lines 
causing considerable conversion costs on coating machines makes printing tech-
nologies even more interesting as a manufacturing method. Process parameters 
evaluated in laboratory scale can be scaled up to industrial printing processes 
using roll‐to‐toll technologies. Therefore, production capacities of graphical 
printing machinery already installed can be used. The modular construction of 
many printing machines enables the installation of special equipment like pre-
treatment units, drying ovens or sealing units. This enables adaptation of print-
ing technologies to the special requirements of battery manufacture. The ability 
to realize parallel and series arrangements of batteries by simply replacing print-
ing forms and assuming verified process parameters allows a quick response to 
market demands or layout changes requested by the customer.
The printability of well‐known and emergent electrochemical systems which 
can be processed in an ambient environment is currently the subject of 
research, with many different approaches and manufacturing techniques being 
investigated [6–12]. Still, many challenges remain until fully printed batteries 
can be produced in high quantities. This includes the optimization of printing 
pastes with respect to particle sizes and extended processing times as well as 
the investigation of appropriate sealing methods, physical and chemical stabil-
ity of the printed functional layers, and a reliable in‐line quality assurance sys-
tem that detects and sorts out batteries containing errors.
This chapter provides a detailed overview and an evaluation of printing tech-
nologies that can be used to produce printed thin film batteries in high quanti-
ties. Advantages and disadvantages of particular printing technologies will be 
discussed, with consideration of the technological aspects, battery‐specific 
requirements and output capacities. Furthermore, the current status of and 
recent progress in the fabrication of fully printed zinc‐based batteries will be 
presented, specifying the obstacles that must be overcome for a laboratory‐scale 
printing process to be transferred to an industrial printing process. Concepts of 
possible applications for printed batteries in flexible electronic devices will be 
discussed as well as the industrial perspective of these applications.
7.2  ­Printing Technologies for Functional Printing
The worldwide availability of printing technologies is driven by a steady 
demand for products like newspapers, magazines, books and packaging. 
Every printing technology has its own specific field of application due to 

Industrial Perspective on Printed Batteries

characteristic machine constructions and configurations, printing forms, ink 
rheology, type of ink transfer and throughput capacity. However, functional 
printing sets quality requirements for printing technologies that are different 
to those in graphical printing. This is why quality assurance for these func-
tional layers is another challenge in the field of printed electronics. Beyond 
visual inspection, characterization methods with respect to electrical func-
tionality of the printed patterns, lines or layers must be developed and installed 
in printing machines. Willmann et  al. argue that the combination of “[…] 
all necessary manufacturing steps into one in‐line production is the long‐
term goal of printed electronics” [13]. Achieving this goal requires a high 
degree of extensibility of printing machinery. Assuming mass‐production of 
printed electronics applications with roll‐to‐roll machines, in‐line quality 
assurance systems have to work reliably at high printing speeds, as error‐
containing products must be detected, marked and sorted. Table  7.1 lists 
major quality aspects that need to be considered in the fields of graphical and 
functional printing.
Additionally, a variety of products exist in the field of printed electronics 
with different requirements regarding print resolution, layer thickness, surface 
homogeneity and the types of substrate that can be processed. The choice of 
the preferred printing technology depends on product‐specific properties and 
the materials that need to be processed.
For example, the front‐side metallization of silicon solar cells requires the 
printing of fine line contact fingers with a high aspect ratio to reduce shading 
loss and enhance electrical conductivity at the same time. Contact fingers with 
line widths in the range of 30 µm, often realized with double prints to achieve 
sufficient electrical conductivity, can only be printed assuming an efficient reg-
istration control and customized printing pastes. Special printing equipment 
and highly viscous screen printing silver pastes with a solid content up to 90%

and silver particles with sizes of less than 5 µm are available for those applica-
tions [14]. In contrast the electrodes of printed thin film batteries are realized by 
processing printing pastes containing highly‐abrasive particles with sizes up to 
75 µm. Whereas the resolution of the electrodes to be printed is insignificant in 
a certain range, layer thicknesses of 100 µm and more are needed to ensure suit-
able electrode capacities. Yet, sufficient registration control is needed in this 
field of application as stack‐type batteries and coplanar batteries can be manu-
factured by multilayer printing. Table  7.2 gives a comparative overview of 
selected parameters of the traditional printing technologies.
Since Table 7.2 shows significant differences in the values of the ink viscosity, 
print resolution and wet‐film thickness that can be achieved, a more detailed 
view of the characteristics of the individual printing technologies regarding the 
manufacture of batteries will be given. Since there is currently enormous pro-
gress in the development of digital printing solutions for functional printing, 
only printing technologies with permanent printing forms will be discussed.
7.2.1  Flexography
In flexographic printing a flexible rubber or photopolymer relief printing plate 
or sleeve is used as printing form. Printing plates are available in a variety of 
parameters with respect to plate thickness, plate hardness and relief depth. 
A specific plate type is selected according to the requirements of the layout to 
be printed as well as the surface properties of the substrate to be printed. The 
printing elements of the printing plates are raised and the relief is formed by 
photopolymerization. After mounting the flexible printing plate onto the plate 
cylinder, the raised parts of the printing plate are inked up with an anilox roller 
made of chrome or ceramics. The ink transfer can be controlled by selecting 
an anilox roller with a specific dip volume and screen frequencies of up to

The substrate to be printed runs on a hard impression cylinder while the 
plate cylinder with the soft printing plate being mounted is pressed against 
the substrate. Ink transfer onto the substrate is realized by ink‐splitting from 
the raised parts of the printing plate to the substrate. Multicolor web‐fed 
­printing machines with 8–10 printing units and high throughput capacities 
with printing speeds of up to 500 m/min are predominant in the field of flexo-
graphic printing. Sheet‐fed printing machines are also available and are used 
for special applications [16]. Figure 7.1 shows the main features of a flexog-
raphic printing unit.
Various types of substrate can be processed by flexographic printing includ-
ing paper, cardboard, metal and plastic film, as well as composite substrates, as 
this printing technique is traditionally used to produce packaging. Additionally, 
the modular construction of the printing machines and the soft photopolymer 
printing plates that can realize line widths up to 30 µm make this printing tech-
nology attractive for printed electronic applications like the printing of contact 
fingers of silicon solar cells [16]. The polymer‐based printing plates and the 
ceramic anilox roller enable production of batteries free of contamination by 
the active masses of the electrodes. Low viscosity conductive and non‐conduc-
tive printing inks based on water or organic solvents have been developed and 
optimized for flexographic printing. Figure 7.2 shows an example of a flexog-
raphic printing plate with a detailed view of the raised printing elements.
Recent investigations demonstrated interest in using flexographic printing as a 
printing technique for zinc‐based batteries [17, 18]. Printed wet‐film thicknesses 
with a maximum of 8 µm can be achieved with a single printing stroke. To achieve 
printed‐layer thickness of the electrodes necessary to ensure electrical perfor-
mance, multiple printing steps must be performed on the same substrate.

This requires either the installation of additional printing units printing the same 
layout or multiple printing cycles with precise registration control. For the pro-
duction of fully printed batteries with printed current collectors, electrodes and 
electrolyte, printing machines with more than ten printing and drying units are 
needed; however, this is not an economically feasible manufacturing process for 
printed batteries.
7.2.2  Gravure Printing
The printing form of a rotogravure printing machine consists of a hard cylin-
der mainly made of a steel core coated with a copper layer acting as the image 
carrier. The printing elements are cells which are engraved into the copper 
surface of the cylinder by laser engraving, mechanical engraving or an etching 
process, while the non‐printing elements remain on the original surface level 
of the cylinder. For long print runs the engraved cylinder can be chromium 
plated to extend run resistance. The printing unit of a rotogravure printing 
machine consists of the printing cylinder, an ink reservoir, an impression cylin-
der and a doctor blade. Before printing, the whole printing cylinder is flooded 
and the engraved cells are filled up with low viscosity ink. Before contact 
between printing cylinder and the substrate is made, a doctor blade removes 
excessive ink from the non‐printing areas and ensures that ink remains only in 
the engraved cells. Ink transfer from the cells onto the substrate is realized by 
applying high printing pressure of approximately 3 MPa [15]. Sometimes ink 
transfer is optimized by use of an electrostatic printing assist system which

supports the emptying of the cells [19]. Gravure printing is a high‐speed print-
ing technology which is mainly used for high‐volume print runs of magazines 
and packaging, and decorative and securities printing. Predominantly, multi-
color roll‐to‐roll printing machines are installed but sheet‐fed machines also 
exist. The construction principle of a printing unit of a rotogravure printing 
machine is illustrated in Figure 7.3.
The advantages of rotogravure printing are the flexibility of the printing 
format and the potential to print products in large quantities. While printing 
cylinders are usually available in widths between 200 mm and 4,320 mm [19], 
the manufacturing costs of the printing forms are relatively high compared to 
other printing technologies, as a single printing cylinder is needed for every 
separation to be printed. Figure 7.4 shows a detailed view of a chromium‐plated 
rotogravure printing cylinder with its recessed printing elements.
The possibility of simultaneously printing thin layers at high print resolution 
and at large scale intensified research into the use of gravure printing in the 
area of printed electronics in recent years. The fabrication of organic solar cells 
[20] and wireless sensor‐signage tags [1] and the patterning of flexible sub-
strates with silver nanowires [21] or graphene inks [22] is just a selection of 
gravure printing applications currently being investigated. The advantage of 
printing thin layers at high print resolution represents a disadvantage when 
batteries have to be printed. As discussed earlier (see section 7.2.1) electrodes 
of batteries require a certain layer thickness to achieve sufficient capacity. 
Furthermore, contamination of printing pastes consisting of the active masses 
of the electrodes cannot be ruled out as printing cylinders are made of steel, 
copper and chromium. This seems to be another reason why gravure printed 
batteries have not been reported as yet.

7.2.3  Offset Printing
In offset printing the printing elements and the non‐printing elements are vir-
tually located on the same layer of the printing form. The adhesion of the high 
viscosity inks on the printing elements is caused by differences in the value of 
surface energy compared to the non‐printing elements of the aluminum‐based 
printing form. The imaging of the printing plate is usually realized by photoli-
thography or in some cases by contact print copy with a film. In conventional 
offset printing, the printing unit consists of a dampening unit, a multi‐roller 
inking unit, a plate cylinder with the printing form mounted, a blanket cylinder 
which transfers the ink from the printing plate onto the substrate, and an 
impression cylinder (see Figure  7.5). Before the ink is transferred onto the 
printing plate the whole plate is damped with a water‐based dampening solu-
tion. The non‐printing elements exhibit hydrophilic behavior, which results in 
ink‐repellant properties, whereas the printing elements can accept the printing 
ink due to their oleophilic properties. Figure 7.6 exemplarily shows an offset 
printing form with printing and non-printing elements. During printing, the 
ink is initially transferred onto the blanket cylinder before being transferred 
onto the substrate by ink‐splitting at a high printing pressure of about 1 MPa. 
Waterless offset printing technology is also available. Silicone‐coated printing 
plates are imaged by photolithography to realize the distinction between ink‐
accepting and ink‐repelling elements. Printing machines are available in sheet‐
fed and web‐fed constructions [15, 23].
The multi‐roller construction of offset printing units impedes the processing of 
functional printing pastes containing coarse particles of electrode materials. 
Another restriction of this printing technique in the desired field of application is 
Figure 7.4  Detail view of a chromium‐plated rotogravure printing cylinder with recessed 
printing elements.

the limitation of the layer thickness that can be achieved with a single printing 
stroke. Furthermore, the presence of the water‐based dampening solution and the 
requirements regarding viscoelastic behavior of the printing pastes prevents offset 
printing technology being used as a manufacturing method for printed batteries.
7.2.4  Screen Printing
In screen printing the making of the printing form and the ink transfer onto 
the substrate is completely different as compared to the printing technologies

described in the sections above. Woven meshes made of polyester, polyamide 
or stainless steel with defined counts of threads having defined diameters 
­provide the basis for making a screen printing form. Initially, the meshes are 
stretched by applying a selected tension and then glued to a frame, made 
mainly of aluminum or steel, by means of adhesives. Printing elements are 
characterized as open mesh areas allowing the ink or paste to be transferred 
onto the substrate. The patterning of the printing form with a specific layout 
is realized by stencil making. Therefore, the open mesh area is coated 
­uniformly with a photosensitive emulsion which can be exposed with UV irra-
diation by contact print copy after drying. As right reading positives are used 
as a film, the unexposed areas of the emulsion can be washed out after the 
exposure has finished, thus creating the printing elements of the stencil. The 
printing unit of a flatbed screen printing machine, as shown in Figure 7.7, 
consists of the printing form, a doctor blade and an angled squeegee made of 
polyurethane or combinations of rigid materials and polymers. Besides ­flatbed 
screen printing, which is predominant if printing jobs with precise register 
accuracy need to be done, a variety of machine configurations are available for 
special printing jobs, including for shaped objects like glassware, tools or 
­barrels. Rotary screen printing is also available and is mainly used for printing 
ceramic tiles or labels [24].
Screen printing offers the possibility of adapting the printing technology to 
the specific requirements of the products to be printed, rather than the reverse. 
Understanding of the interaction of essential printing parameters allows the 
processing of a variety of substrates and functional printing pastes with a wide 
range of viscosity as well as multilayer prints with different layer thicknesses 
within one printing cycle. Modification of printing parameters like mesh count 
and thread diameter, blade geometry of the squeegee and printing speed 
­enables control of the print resolution and the thickness of the printed ink 
layer, as well as the coarseness of the particles dissolved in the printing pastes.

A detailed view of mesh parameters enables a deeper understanding of the 
flexibility of screen printing technology with respect to the printing jobs and 
materials that can be processed. The mesh geometry is defined by the thread 
diameter d, the mesh count n and the mesh opening w, as illustrated in 
Figure 7.8. These parameters enable calculation of the open mesh area αo 
representing the percentage of the ink‐permeable area affecting ink‐release 
characteristics and the thickness of the printed layers. Another essential fac-
tor is the theoretical ink volume Vth, which allows an approximate calcula-
tion of ink consumption and the maximum achievable thickness of the 
printed wet layer on non‐absorbent substrates for each individual screen 
printing mesh.
The main factors that need to be considered when printed electronic devices 
are realized are the print resolution with respect to line‐edge sharpness and the 
layer thickness of the deposited printing pastes on the substrate. The determi-
nation of mean particle sizes of printing pastes is necessary in advance for 
selection of an appropriate screen printing mesh capable of processing the 
particular printing paste. Sufficient ink penetration can be ensured by selecting 
meshes with a mesh opening that is three times the value of the mean particle 
size of the printing paste [24].
The resolution is an important criterion in the area of fine line printing of 
electronic circuits and when parallel battery architectures are realized. The 
dependency between the value of thread diameter and mesh opening deter-
mines the ability to print sharp edges. A screen printing mesh having a 
greater mesh opening than the thread diameter can be used to print fine lines

at a higher resolution. Assuming a proper stencil technique, the characteris-
tic visual appearance of screen‐printed lines is minimized as is the risk of 
interruptions affecting electrical functionality. The availability of a variety of 
screen printing meshes made of dissimilar materials in various mesh counts 
and thread diameters allows ideal adjustment of the screen printing equip-
ment to the desired layer thickness, line‐edge sharpness and particle sizes of 
the preferred printing pastes. This freedom of process design is the major 
advantage of screen printing technology and the main reason for the wide-
spread use of this technology for printing functional layers. Figure 7.9 shows 
a detail view of the printing side of a screen printing form made with a thick 
capillary film.
Characterized as a cost‐effective and versatile manufacturing method, screen 
printing technology is now used on an industrial scale for realizing the front‐
side metallization of crystalline silicon solar cells [25], for antennas for auto-
motive applications [26] and for sensors for medical applications [27]. It is also 
a promising technology for economically producing flexible batteries on a 
large scale, as the technical features of the printing forms allow an adjustment 
of the mesh geometry according to the desired printed film thickness and the 
mean particle size of the active masses of the electrodes. In recent years, 
research has focused on the development of screen printing pastes of well‐
known electrochemical systems for flexible thin film batteries for wearables 
or other portable devices [9, 11]. As fully screen‐printed zinc‐carbon 
­batteries and nickel‐metal hydride (NiMH) batteries have been successfully

Printing elements are characterized as open mesh areas allowing the printing paste to be

demonstrated [6, 28], other electrochemical systems like primary or secondary 
zinc‐air batteries are currently drawing the attention of several research groups 
[7, 12], since these batteries consist mainly of eco‐friendly materials.
7.2.5  Conclusion
As can be seen, substantial technological differences with respect to ink 
transfer, ink‐splitting, print resolution and materials accessible persist 
between the traditional printing technologies using a permanent printing 
form. Existing variations in the construction principles of the printing forms, 
printing units and printing machines determine individual process charac-
teristics affecting quality of registration control, layer thickness achievable 
with a single printing stroke, and possible risk of contamination of the print-
ing pastes of the electrodes.
The flexibility and extensibility of screen printing technology meet the 
requirements for the manufacture of printed batteries. The characteristics of 
the printing forms allow individual control of printed‐layer thickness and print 
resolution, even within one printing cycle. Many functional printing pastes 
have been optimized for screen printing technology and variation of the mesh 
geometry of the printing form enables formulation of printing pastes based on 
different types of solvents and particle sizes. The extension of screen printing 
machines with specially modified equipment from other technologies in the 
field of packaging allows the integration of various in‐line sealing methods. 
Compared with other printing technologies, screen printing has the highest 
level of vertical integration, assuming fully printed batteries on an industrial 
scale, and is therefore the technology of choice in this field of application.
7.3  ­Comparison of Conventional Battery 
Manufacturing Methods with Screen 
Printing Technology
Production and assembly lines for the manufacture of conventional batteries 
with standardized layouts consist of multiple stations of highly innovative and 
productive machine components. Only a few specialized engineering compa-
nies are able to construct technologically advanced production and assembly 
lines with output capacities of 100 or more batteries per minute. All processing 
steps needed to produce complete batteries are included within the production 
line, as well as in‐line quality monitoring systems. Figure 7.10 exemplarily illus-
trates a fully automated production line for lithium‐ion batteries, indicating the 
vital process steps. Both electrodes are realized by a continuous coating process 
(e.g. slot die coating) of the active masses on carrier substrates, while current 
collectors are integrated by pick‐and‐place technologies of pre‐punched metal

foils. Staples of cells are formed and packed into pouches before the electrolyte 
is inserted in a precise quantity into the nitrogen atmosphere by dispensing 
technology. The final steps include preliminary sealing of the pouches followed 
by degassing and resealing of the pouches before functional checks and initial 
formation of the batteries are performed.
As shown in Figure 7.10, the dimensions of production lines for the manu-
facture of lithium‐ion batteries require significant investment costs with 
respect to machine configurations and corresponding infrastructure. The 
capacities of these machines are sufficient for realizing high quantities of 
standardized batteries at low reject rates. These batteries are needed to meet 
the growing demand for energy storage systems for smartphones, tablets, note-
books and many other portable electronic devices. Switching to other battery

designs or materials like carrier substrates causes considerable conversion 
costs for fully automated production lines, with an initial evaluation of each 
individual process parameter.
Compared to this technology, investment costs for sheet‐fed or rotary screen 
printing lines with multiple printing stations are modest. While screen print-
ing technology offers the possibility of switching battery designs in a short time 
at low cost, all process steps shown in Figure 7.10 must be transferred into 
printing steps. For example, the positioning of pre‐punched metal foils for the 
realization of current collectors can be replaced by an initial printing of highly 
conductive silver pastes before the electrodes are deposited at the subsequent 
printing stations. Sealing procedures can be substituted by printing adhesives, 
lamination or ultrasonic welding processes that are known from the area of 
packaging technology. The modular construction of screen printing machin-
ery offers a high degree of extensibility which allows integration of a variety of 
process technologies into the manufacturing line. Figure 7.11 gives an over-
view of a possible configuration of a manufacturing line for the production of 
zinc‐based batteries consisting of two roll‐to‐roll screen printing machines 
having multiple printing units, followed by drying units and a sealing unit rep-
resenting the final assembly steps for the batteries.
As can be seen, there are significant differences in the two technologies with 
respect to the level of vertical integration, output capacity, flexibility of proces-
sible materials and in‐line quality monitoring and assurance. Competition 
between the two manufacturing methods can be excluded as different fields of

application are served by the respective technologies. Screen printing is a 
promising technology when flexible thin film batteries with changing layouts 
must be produced at low costs. Therefore, further research work with respect 
to the adaptation of printing technology and materials to the special require-
ments of battery manufacture is a necessity.
7.4  ­Industrial Aspects of Screen‐printed 
Thin Film Batteries
7.4.1  Layout Considerations
The transformation of conventional consumer battery architectures with 
rigid casings to printed battery layouts requires the development of new con-
struction principles for batteries. Printed batteries are predominantly gener-
ated in layers beginning with the application of current collectors. Two 
architectures, sandwich and parallel, have been proven at laboratory scale and 
are suitable for industrial‐scale production of fully printed batteries. At the 
production level, differences in the two architectures exist in the requirements 
regarding the standard of quality of printing machinery and equipment. 
The electrical performance characteristics of both construction methods in 
relation to short‐circuit currents, extractable capacities and shelf‐lives is still 
the subject of research.
7.4.1.1  Sandwich Architecture (Stack Configuration)
All functional elements of printed batteries having a sandwich architecture are 
successively generated in printing layers either on the same sheet of the carrier 
substrate or on one individual carrier substrate for each electrode, with both 
substrates brought together at the sealing unit, representing the final process 
step and thus the encapsulation of the battery (see Figure 7.11). Figure 7.12 
depicts a schematic drawing of the construction method for a printed sand-
wich‐type battery naming all required components. If printed on the same 
layer of a sheet, which is the preferred manufacturing method for this architec-
ture, one printing unit followed by a drying unit is needed for every functional 
layer printed. Folding techniques must be applied after the separator is either 
printed or placed by pick‐and‐place technology on at least one electrode, 
ensuring contact of both electrodes with the separator and the ionic conduc-
tive electrolyte. Sealing and encapsulation of the batteries can be realized by a 
patterned printing of adhesives.
The arrangement of the terminals on the same layer facilitates the electric 
connection of the battery with other printed or non‐printed electronic 
devices. The option of printing sandwich‐type batteries sets lower 
­requirements for the registration control of the printing machines and allows 

Industrial Perspective on Printed Batteries
201
manufacture with both sheet‐fed and roll‐to‐roll screen printing machinery 
with high throughput capacities. It also represents a reduced risk of contami-
nation with particles of the opposite electrode since the distance between the 
electrodes on the printing substrate can be significantly larger than that in 
batteries with a parallel architecture. The realization of this battery architec-
ture by screen printing technology allows production of single‐cell and multi-
cell configurations of batteries in series or parallel arrangements exhibiting 
specific voltages and capacities.
Figure 7.13 shows screen‐printed electrodes of an NiMH battery before the 
separator and electrolyte are placed. Current collectors consisting of printed 
silver and additional carbon black passivation layers have been realized, to 
avoid any negative interaction of the silver particles with the electrochemistry 
of the battery.
7.4.1.2  Parallel Architecture (Coplanar Configuration)
Screen printing of batteries having a parallel architecture, also called coplanar 
architecture, sets higher requirements for the registration control of printing 
machines as well as for the quality standards of the printing forms. Sheet‐fed 
screen printing machines with three‐point alignments are preferred when 
coplanar batteries need to be printed since a more precise registration control 
can be assured. All functional layers, including both electrodes, are printed on 
the same layer of the sheet and separated only by a gap with a defined width. 
Electrical contact between any functional layers due to insufficient registration 
control has to be avoided as this would cause short‐circuits resulting in mal-
function of the battery. Contacts of the positive and negative terminals are 
located on the same layer, which facilitates the connection of the battery to 
other electronic devices.

The main benefit of this battery architecture is the reduction in the use of 
printing forms, required printing units and subsequently drying units, which 
enables faster and more cost‐effective production of these batteries on existing 
printing machinery without large modification. The printing of current collec-
tors and passivation layers requires only one printing form, which also acceler-
ates the drying procedures for the printed layers. Figure 7.14 gives an overview 
of the layers that must be printed during the manufacturing process of a printed 
coplanar battery.

As folding processes are not needed for the encapsulation of coplanar batter-
ies, possible integration of circuits of other electronic devices in the manufac-
turing process is substantially easier. For example, antennas for near‐field 
communication (NFC) or RFID communication can be printed on the same 
carrier substrate with the particular layout being placed on the same printing 
form as is used for the current collectors, assuming the use of identical conduc-
tive inks for both structures. Another advantage of coplanar batteries is the 
absence of a separator, which simplifies the manufacturing process. The elec-
trolyte can also be deposited by screen printing, whereby the amount of elec-
trolyte being deposited can be controlled by selecting screen printing meshes 
with an adjusted theoretical ink volume.
As can be seen, printed coplanar batteries have a higher manufacturing 
depth compared to sandwich‐type batteries, as all process steps can be realized 
by in‐line screen printing technology followed by application of well‐known 
packaging technologies (e.g. lamination process), which makes the printing of 
adhesives as sealants redundant. A higher risk of contamination of the pre‐
printed electrode areas with active masses of the opposite electrode printed at 
the following printing unit can be excluded when high‐quality printing forms 
are used. Electrode sizes can be adjusted to the available printing format of the 
printing machines and desired battery capacity. Recently, fully printed single‐
cell and multicell zinc‐carbon batteries in series and parallel arrangements 
have been demonstrated successfully. They are used to power autonomous 
working temperature sensors for a recording period of several months (see sec-
tion 7.5.1). Figure 7.15 shows an example of a fully printed zinc‐carbon battery 
(single‐cell, ZnCl electrolyte) in an individually designed coplanar configura-
tion and the corresponding discharge curve.
7.4.2  Carrier Substrates and Multifunctional Substrates 
for Printed Batteries
Before the most appropriate carrier substrate for the manufacture of printed 
batteries is identified and selected, consideration must be made of the desired 
electrochemical system, battery layout, and manufacturing methods with 
respect to printing machines, drying procedures and sealing technologies. 
Various types of substrate can be used for the production of printed batteries. 
This includes paper substrates, plastic films, metal foils and any combination 
of these materials resulting in multilayered composite substrates with defined 
properties of chemical and physical resistance as well as defined transfer rates 
of gases and water vapor from the ambient environment. Multilayered com-
posite substrates like packaging pouches from the area of food packaging meet 
the demanding requirements that are set by printed batteries. Besides their 
flexibility, those substrates can be sealed and have adequate barrier capabilities 
as regards gases, moisture and various aqueous electrolyte systems. Despite 

Printed Batteries
204
those advantages and the high availability of these substrates in industrial 
quantities, most packaging materials have an asymmetrical construction of 
different types of plastic film on the interior and exterior sides, which results in 
curling behavior when necessary thermal treatment procedures are applied. To 
ensure proper alignment at all printing units, a symmetrical construction of 
suitable substrates is highly preferred in the area of printed batteries, especially

when sheet‐fed printing machines are used. Recently, various approaches have 
been made to develop specially designed substrates for the production of 
printed batteries.
7.4.2.1  Barrier Requirements and Material Selection
The chemical properties of the particular electrochemical system to be printed 
sets the requirements regarding the selection of materials for the manufacture 
of a proper substrate. Excellent barrier capabilities are required to avoid trans-
fer of various gases and water vapor into and out of the encapsulated electro-
chemical systems of many batteries.
For example, the electrochemical systems of NiMH batteries and alkaline 
zinc‐carbon batteries are sensitive to gas and water vapor transfer into and 
out of the battery. On the one hand, those batteries must be protected 
against the penetration of carbon dioxide (CO2) from ambient air into the 
battery as this would cause and increase oxidation of the aqueous potassium 
hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte to crystalline potassium carbonate (K2CO3), 
resulting in a decrease of the electrical performance due to the insulating 
behavior of the carbonates. On the other hand, evaporation and loss of water 
from the aqueous electrolyte forces a drying out of the battery with a 
decrease in the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. In contrast to the elec-
trochemical systems of those batteries, the manufacture of zinc‐carbon bat-
teries with aqueous or gel‐like zinc chloride as an electrolyte is less 
demanding regarding the encapsulation specifications of the substrates to 
be printed. As zinc chloride shows hygroscopic behavior, it can accept water 
vapor from the ambient air in a certain range, which extends battery shelf‐
life and service life. Obviously, loss of the electrolyte due to insufficient seal-
ing has to be avoided as well, as this would cause malfunction of the battery. 
Multilayered composite substrates made of thin aluminum foils enclosed by 
protecting plastic films meet the requirements for impermeable carrier sub-
strates for printed alkaline batteries. While the aluminum layer successfully 
impedes the transfer of gases and water vapor into the battery, the surround-
ing plastic films protect the aluminum layer from interaction with the elec-
trolyte and enables sufficient printability at the same time due to a better 
wetting behavior for printing inks. In the area of zinc‐carbon batteries with 
zinc chloride as an electrolyte, plastic films made of PE or PET offer suffi-
cient encapsulation behavior to protect the electrochemistry from contami-
nation and loss of electrolyte.
Electrochemical systems having an open cell design such as zinc‐air batter-
ies and other printable metal‐air systems need a special combination of indi-
vidual carrier substrates for each electrode. In the example of zinc‐air batteries, 
the zinc anode should be printed on high‐barrier substrates whereas the cata-
lytic cathode needs oxygen from ambient air to maintain the electrochemical 
redox reaction that converts zinc to zinc‐oxide during discharge. Therefore, 

Printed Batteries
206
porous membranes that are permeable to gases and simultaneously exhibit 
hydrophobic behavior preventing leakage of electrolyte are required. In this 
case, the presence of CO2 in ambient air is another challenge as it supports the 
degradation and carbonation of the electrolyte consequently clogging the 
pores of the porous cathode with potassium carbonate, which results in a 
decreased cycle stability of this electrochemical system. While porous mem-
branes made of PTFE are predominantly used as functional carrier substrates 
for cathode manufacture in conventional zinc‐air batteries, the printability of 
these membranes represents a major challenge. The realization of printed 
primary and secondary zinc‐air batteries with alternative substrates to PTFE 
in the manufacture of gas diffusion cathodes is currently the subject of 
research by several research groups and seems to be the key factor in making 
this electrochemical system accessible by screen printing technology. 
Table 7.3 gives a comparative overview of printable primary and secondary 
electrochemical systems and their respective specifications for the construc-
tion of carrier substrates.
As can be seen from Table 7.3, the characteristics of the particular electro-
chemical system principally define the specifications of suitable materials for 
utilization as carrier substrate. Besides these material standpoints, additional 
factors that need to be considered for industrial production of printed batteries 
are the process stability of the respective substrates during printing and the 
subsequent application of drying procedures. Those standpoints will be dis-
cussed in the upcoming section.
7.4.2.2  Process Requirements of Qualified Materials
The thickness of the carrier substrate mainly defines the overall thickness of 
the manufactured battery and also affects its flexibility. Assuming low‐cost 
production of flexible batteries having high volumetric energy densities, thin 
substrates are most likely to be preferred, but the deficit of suitable barrier 
capabilities contradicts their usage. Thin substrates like single‐layered plastic 
films also complicate the processing of the highly viscous screen printing inks 
that are predominantly used in the area of printed batteries. Thin substrates 
tend to stick at the printing side of the screen during ink release. Registration 
control with proper alignment of the substrate at the vacuum table of sheet‐fed 
printing machines is also negatively affected due to insufficient handling capa-
bility. Furthermore, a certain layer thickness of heat‐sealable plastic is required 
when hot‐sealing techniques or ultrasonic welding processes from the area of 
packaging technology are applied for encapsulation. Therefore, multilayered 
composite substrates are the material of choice in the field of printed batteries. 
Figure 7.16 depicts a schematic diagram of a multilayered and paper‐based 
composite substrate exclusively developed and manufactured by Schoeller 
Technocell (Osnabrück, Germany) for the production of printed NiMH and 
zinc‐carbon batteries.

The combination of dissimilar types of materials in a composite substrate as 
depicted in Figure 7.16 results in a typical layer thickness of 0.2 mm or more 
with an extended stiffness of the substrate compared to single‐layered films. 
Whereas this thickness value seems quite high, neither flexibility nor the appli-
cation of folding techniques are restricted, enabling the manufacture of batter-
ies having sandwich or parallel architectures. The major benefit of this 
construction is represented by a reinforcement of the composite substrate with 
the enclosed paper layer, which provides dimensional integrity when thermal 
treatment procedures are applied before and after printing steps. Initially, 
these thermal steps are necessary before printing to remove the internal stress 
of the materials and to avoid shrinkage of the substrate after the first printing 
unit, which would make proper alignment at subsequent printing units impos-
sible. After initial thermal treatment, curling behavior of many composite sub-
strates with asymmetric construction can be observed. The additional paper 
layer prevents the substrate from curling and rolling up. Further thermal treat-
ment steps are required for heat curing of the functional printing inks estab-
lishing the percolative conductive network of the current collectors, passivation 
layers and electrodes.
The aluminum layer provides sufficient barrier capabilities against gases and 
moisture whereas the thickness of the outer plastic layers enables printability 
as well as the possibility of applying encapsulation techniques like heat sealing 
or ultrasonic welding processes without physical damage to the lower layers 
including the aluminum barrier layer. To enhance the wetting ability of the 
plastic surface to be printed, pretreatment methods like atmospheric plasma 
or corona that are conventionally used in graphical printing can be integrated

in printing machines and applied before the first layer is printed. Another 
essential factor that needs to be considered is the safety of the battery regard-
ing physical damage by possible leakage of the electrolyte during its life‐cycle. 
While the construction of the composite substrate is able to withstand 
mechanical damage in a certain way, the sealing layer seems to be the weak 
point of printed batteries. Suitable encapsulation techniques that can be inte-
grated with or connected to printing processes will be discussed in detail in 
section 7.4.6.
In conclusion, for printed batteries, many material aspects and the final 
application of the battery must be considered before the proper substrate can 
be selected and evaluated. The availability of a wide range of substrates is due 
to their widespread use in the field of food packaging. Modifications of existing 
carrier substrates as well as the development of new substrates can be realized 
in coordination with manufacturers of packaging material to achieve an 
optimum trade‐off between economic aspects, barrier capabilities and process 
stability.
7.4.3  Current Collectors
Current collectors of conventional consumer batteries like lithium‐ion batter-
ies consist of pre‐punched or tailor‐made metal foils of aluminum and copper 
with the active masses of the respective electrode directly coated onto the sur-
face of the foils. The transformation of those materials to the area of printed 
batteries requires the printing of electrically conductive but also electrochemi-
cally inert patterns. Printed electronic inks like silver inks or carbon inks have 
been optimized over years for screen printing applications and thus are prom-
ising candidates for the realization of printed current collectors.
After thermal drying procedures are applied, the sheet resistance of the 
printed layers should be in a low‐single‐digit ohmic range whereas the wetting 
ability of the surface layer needs to be sufficient at the same time to promote 
good adhesion for printing of electrode layers free of defects. This ensures low 
contact resistance between the active masses of the electrodes and the current 
collectors. Whereas the printing of silver inks represents an enormous expense 
factor with material costs of 1,000 €/Kg or more, other printing inks based on 
nickel or semi‐conductive polymers like PEDOT:PSS exhibit either toxicity 
or low conductivity which impedes printing of those materials. The consump-
tion of silver printing inks can be controlled and reduced to a minimum by 
selecting screen printing meshes with adjusted theoretical ink volumes. 
Another approach in reducing ink consumption is variation of the layouts of 
the current collectors. Whereas solid‐tone patches in current collectors are 
highly ink consuming, the printing of grid‐like structures may be a useful 
option when they are subsequently coated with carbon black ink, ensuring 
accessibility of electrons to the complete electrode layer. In any case, 

Printed Batteries
210
passivation of the silver layer is necessary to prevent chemical interaction of 
silver particles with the electrochemistry of the battery. Therefore, protection 
of the silver ink layers by extensive overprinting of carbon black ink with suf-
ficient layer thickness has to be applied. Since carbon black exhibits excellent 
chemical resistivity against acidic and alkaline solutions, it additionally pro-
tects the silver layer from corrosion, which is of particular importance in the 
area of alkaline battery systems. Thermal treatment procedures must be 
adapted to the requirements demanded by the printing inks for heat curing as 
well as to thermal stability specifications of the carrier substrate. While most 
conductive printing inks need a curing time of 10–15 minutes at temperatures 
of 90–120 °C, printing speeds must be adjusted to the length of drying ovens to 
achieve adequate curing and electrical conductivity. Recent developments in 
the area of functional printing inks aim to reduce curing temperatures to val-
ues of 40–50 °C at shorter drying periods. This represents an enormous benefit 
regarding the materials available to printed battery manufacturing, as well as 
accelerating drying procedures through installation of shorter drying ovens, 
and also reduces energy costs.
To ensure long‐term stability of printed current collectors resulting in 
extended service life for the manufactured batteries, the chemical and physical 
stability of the printed layers must be characterized individually in laboratory 
tests before larger printing runs are performed. The physical adhesion of 
printed current collectors and passivation layers to the particular carrier sub-
strate can be examined by cross‐hatch cutting or evaluation of folding pro-
cesses, allowing visual quality control of the printed layers after the application 
of physical stress. Cyclic voltammetry allows the simulation of charge and dis-
charge cycles in close succession enabling determination of the achieved 
chemical resistance of the printed passivation layers. Electrolytic corrosion of 
current collectors is mainly responsible for the delamination of those struc-
tures from the carrier substrate despite sufficient wetting behavior of the sur-
face layer. Figure 7.17 shows electrolytic corrosion of the current collectors of 
a printed NiMH battery with subsequent delamination of the terminals from 
the carrier substrate. Further investigation and characterization of materials 
for the manufacture of current collectors for printed batteries exhibiting long‐
term stability represents an enormous challenge. While printability and high 
availability of the desired materials has to be ensured for cost‐effective large‐
scale production, interaction of any component forming part of the construc-
tion of the battery with its particular electrochemistry must be excluded.
7.4.4  Electrodes
The main challenge of printed batteries is the formulation of printing inks 
based on the active masses of the electrochemical systems. Those raw materi-
als are available in a variety of specifications with respect to particle size and

particle form. The properties range from finely dispersed metal powders or 
oxides in the single‐digit micron range to coarse particles of around 70–100 µm 
having dissimilar surface morphologies. Spherical particles or flakes of differ-
ent diameters are the predominant forms in the area of metals for the prepara-
tion of printing inks for negative electrodes while fine powders of oxides or 
alloys are used to prepare positive electrode printing inks. Figure 7.18 is a detail

Compromises must be made when good printability at satisfactory pro-
cessing times with sufficient electrical functionality must be ensured at the 
same time. The selection of proper solvents or binding agents has to be 
adjusted in view of the porosity and thus the wettability of each individual 
active mass as well as adjusted to their chemical characteristics. Another 
requirement of printed electrode layers is flexibility in a certain range allow-
ing for further processing without breaking of the layers, which would result 
in decreased electrical performance or malfunction of the batteries. For 
example, Wendler et al. proved that the formulation of printing pastes based 
on organic solvents results in reduced electrical performance parameters of 
printed zinc‐carbon and NiMH batteries. It was observed that oxidation of 
the active masses had already occurred before the printing of the electrodes 
started. This chemical reaction was identified by determination of the elec-
trical performance of the manufactured batteries and also by visual inspec-
tion of the printed electrode layers. After the ink formulation of solvents and 
binding agents was switched to water‐based systems, a significant increase in 
the open‐circuit voltages of the manufactured batteries compared to the 
theoretical values was observed. The results of comparative impedance 
measurements on batteries with electrodes realized with printing inks based 
on different types of solvents exhibited a decline in ohmic resistance in 
charged states when water‐based printing inks were used. Those measure-
ments represented metrological proof of the optimization of the electro-
chemical performance without quantifiable oxidation of the printing pastes 
prior to printing [28].
Another aspect that is often overlooked in the field of printed batteries is the 
adjustment of screen printing equipment to the special requirements of print-
ing inks based on active masses for electrodes. Metallic contamination of the 
printing pastes has to be avoided in any case to ensure proper functionality of 
the electrochemical systems without parasitic side reactions negatively affect-
ing the performance of the battery. This adjustment involves nearly all process 
steps from mixing of the components of the printing pastes, to stencil making 
and up to the printing of the electrodes. In the field of graphical printing, inks 
are often stirred up using dissolvers with metal discs to ensure proper homog-
enization of the inks with the pigments dispersed uniformly within the print-
ing ink. To exclude any metallic contamination, metal discs need to be replaced 
by plastic discs or plastic‐coated metal discs when electrode printing pastes are 
stirred. Printing pastes need to be stored in plastic containers and should be 
stirred up with plastic ink spatulas directly before printing. While doctor 
blades made of stainless steel seem to be noncritical, plastic alternatives should 
be considered as well to exclude any incalculable variations of electrical perfor-
mance of the batteries within a patch.

Industrial Perspective on Printed Batteries
213
The production of printing forms for printing electrodes requires specially 
adapted materials as well. Before printing forms are made, the geometry of 
screen printing meshes has to be adjusted to the particle sizes of the particular 
printing inks and to the desired electrode layer thickness that needs to be 
achieved. Furthermore, the type of solvent the printing paste is based on deter-
mines the type of emulsion or capillary film that can be used for stencil mak-
ing. Assuming water‐based printing inks, water‐resistant emulsions with 
adequate physical stability against the coarse and abrasive particles of the 
active masses dispersed within the printing pastes need to be selected and vali-
dated with respect to desired stability and printing times. If this is ignored, 
physical stress caused by the movement of the printing ink and its dispersed 
abrasive particles by the squeegee and the doctor blade during the printing 
process can lead to a precocious destruction of the stencil with risk of contami-
nation of non‐printing areas with active masses. Reduced print quality with 
respect to line‐edge sharpness, which is a requirement especially when copla-
nar batteries are printed, is also a result of a spoiled printing form.
The selection of printing meshes with defined mesh geometry in combina-
tion with the geometry of the installed printing squeegee affects and enables 
control of the printed‐layer thickness of the electrodes. Depending on the 
­particular mesh geometry, the viscosity of the printing paste and the geometry 
of the squeegee, uniform printed electrode layer thicknesses in the range of 
60–100 µm have been achieved with single printing strokes. The challenge in 
transferring a laboratory‐scale screen printing process to an industrial‐scale 
printing process is represented by the deficit of adequate in‐line quality assur-
ance systems. Besides a visual inspection of the printed electrode layers with 
respect to surface defects, quality specifications should include continuous 
measurements of layer thickness and sheet resistance. While in‐line monitor-
ing systems exist in the field of graphical printing, ensuring identical reproduc-
tion of tonal values, these systems could also be used to recognize and mark 
electrodes having defects in surface homogeneity. Another major problem is 
represented by the deficit of working in‐line measurement techniques with 
respect to printed‐layer thickness, which is important to exclude any variations 
of capacities of the manufactured batteries within a patch. Irregular layer 
thickness across the printed layer is caused by a continuous evaporation of 
solvents out of the printing pastes, which affects rheological behavior and 
results in an increase in the ink viscosity. Progressive drying of the printing ink 
in the meshes of the printing form also has a negative effect on the quality of 
the printed electrode layers. Selective measurements that are performed man-
ually to determine layer thicknesses are time consuming, but are still the 
method of choice in the field of quality assurance of printed batteries.
These problems are exacerbated by the need for consecutive manufacturing 
with subsequent assembly of the printed batteries, since printed electrode 
layers oxidize at an ambient environment if not stored in a controlled 

Printed Batteries
214
environment. Therefore, batches of primary batteries, which have the advan-
tage of being fabricated in a charged state and thus are ready to use, should 
only be printed on demand as self‐discharge cannot be avoided over storage 
time, resulting in a decreased OCV on the first day of usage. Secondary sys-
tems need an initial formation process with a charging procedure before the 
batteries can be used as a power source. As self‐discharge of these systems 
before usage can be excluded, they are also susceptible to long storage periods 
as the electrolyte can support corrosive reactions inside the battery. Another 
factor that has significant impact on the shelf‐life of printed batteries is proper 
encapsulation of the electrochemistry. In section 7.4.6, proven sealing methods 
will be discussed in detail in relation to industrial‐scale production of printed 
batteries.
7.4.5  Electrolytes and Separator
The purpose of the electrolyte is to conduct the ions from one electrode to the 
other depending on their charge. On the other hand, an electrolyte should not 
conduct electrons, which would cause an internal short‐circuit leading to a 
high self‐discharge rate. For that purpose, the presence of ions and a certain 
ion mobility within the electrolyte is required. Usually the electrolyte is liquid 
with a conducting salt dissolved in an aqueous or non‐aqueous solution at high 
concentration. In this case the ion conductivity is quite high. If the gap between 
the two electrodes is not guaranteed by mechanical means, this may lead to a 
short‐circuit and a separator is needed. Usually the separator is made of fleece, 
woven or non‐woven, and having high porosity. For special types of batteries 
like lithium‐ion batteries, microporous membranes made of PE, PP and other 
plastic materials are used as separators.
It is possible to transform the electrolyte into a near solid state by adding 
binding agents to the extent that the electrolyte exhibits a rubber‐like consist-
ency. In this case the electrolyte can also be printed as a paste when coplanar 
batteries with parallel architecture are being printed. During the drying proce-
dure the electrolyte nearly solidifies but retains its high ionic conductivity 
making the existence of a conventional separator redundant. The printing of 
electrolytes for the manufacture of sandwich‐type batteries in stack configura-
tion requires the addition of further additives acting as spacers to assure 
mechanical distance between the two electrodes. Those types of electrolyte/
separator combinations can also be realized with screen printing technology 
but require additional modification of the printing equipment ensuring print-
ability as well as homogeneous distribution of the coarse particles used to real-
ize the mechanical distance within the printed layers.
Most recently, the investigation of solid electrolytes was reported. In this 
case the electrolyte forms a polymer layer with the ions moving along the poly-
mer chain in the absence of any liquid phase. As yet, the resulting ion 

Industrial Perspective on Printed Batteries
215
conductivity of these systems is far too low in the ambient temperature range, 
allowing use of these types of electrolytes only at elevated temperatures in all‐
solid‐state batteries (ASSB) [29].
7.4.6  Encapsulation Technologies
Several sealing techniques mainly from the area of food packaging are available 
for the realization of encapsulations of printed batteries. Well‐known tech-
nologies like contact heat sealing or ultrasonic welding can be integrated in 
production lines by connecting them after the final printing unit. To avoid 
interruption to or deceleration of the printing process, these sealing technolo-
gies have to perform at identical process speeds to those of the printing pro-
cess. Additionally, suitable sealing methods must be selected according to their 
compliance with the carrier substrate and the particular thickness of the heat‐
seal polymer layer, as well as the sensitivity of the particular electrochemical 
system to mechanical stress and heat input. Another promising approach to 
the encapsulation of printed batteries is the structured printing of adhesives as 
sealant layers.
7.4.6.1  Screen Printing of Adhesives
Screen printing of adhesives is the preferred sealing method as it can be directly 
integrated into the existing manufacturing process allowing in‐line manufac-
turing of printed batteries without large modification of the printing process 
and the printing machine. Another benefit is the variability in printing layouts 
by the replacement of the particular printing forms. The widespread use of 
screen‐printable adhesives is typically unknown but the variety of usage ranges 
from self‐adhesive products like decals to innovative applications in the auto-
motive and electronics industries (e.g. membrane keypads, touch panels, visual 
instrument panels). In accordance with this wide range of application, a variety 
of specially designed screen‐printable adhesives with different types of curing 
mechanisms are available to the market. Acrylic systems, water‐based disper-
sion systems, hot melt adhesives and UV‐curable adhesives are the predomi-
nant systems available to screen printing technology. The selection of a certain 
type of adhesive should be based on criteria such as the chemical resistance 
against the electrolyte that needs to be enclosed inside the battery, the require-
ments regarding tensile forces or peeling forces the bond has to withstand, and 
the type of curing mechanism that can be applied according to the properties 
of the carrier substrate.
Screen printing of dispersion‐based adhesives and hot melt adhesives has 
been successfully demonstrated as an encapsulation method for screen‐printed 
NiMH and zinc‐carbon batteries [6]. Printed adhesive layers must be designed 
to be thinner than the overall height of the electrode layers and the separator 
to assure proper contact of the electrodes with the separator and the ionic 

Printed Batteries
216
conductive electrolyte after sealing is finished. Depending on the type of adhe-
sive printed, contact pressure has to be applied to the adhesive surface to 
ensure proper adhesion. To avoid air pockets within the battery, it is necessary 
to ensure that excessive ambient air is removed before the last side of the adhe-
sive layer is sealed. Thicker layers of printed adhesives or the existence of air 
pockets facilitate delamination of the electrodes from the separator resulting 
in a sharp voltage drop with consequent failure of the battery. Adhesive layer 
thickness needs to be controlled by adjusting the theoretical ink volume of the 
screen printing meshes to the calculated layer thickness. It should be consid-
ered that the layer thickness of the printed adhesive and the applied contact 
pressure directly influence resistance of the bond to the application of peel or 
shear forces. Preliminary tests to determine actual printed‐layer thickness and 
resistance to the application of peel or shear forces are necessary and must be 
performed for each combination of adhesive and substrate in laboratory tests 
before larger printing runs are realized. Printing adhesives are suitable for the 
encapsulation of batteries with parallel and sandwich‐type architectures in 
single and multicell arrangements. The resulting barrier capability of the bond-
ing has to be determined in a series of experiments in environmental condi-
tions at different temperatures and moisture ranges, allowing calculations of 
shelf‐life and service life of the manufactured batteries.
7.4.6.2  Contact Heat Sealing
Contact heat sealing is a joining technology basically known from the area of 
food packaging and is applied for sealing tubular bags that have been filled with 
a particular product. Contact heat sealing is realized by attaching both sides of 
two heat‐sealable polymer layers facing one another, with a heat jaw pressed 
against the outer layers of the substrates. Heat is conducted from the outer 
surfaces of the substrates to the inner layers, and the bonded surfaces are 
heated to the temperature needed for the layers to soften and melt. The bond-
ing of the two substrates is completed by the application of pressure, forming a 
characteristic seam, with a subsequent cooling down after the pressure of the 
heat jaw is released.
The application of this sealing technique requires carrier substrates with 
heat‐sealable thermoplastic surface layers having low melting points, which 
enables welding temperatures of less than 140 °C. Surface layers made of PE or 
PP with layer thicknesses of at least 20–30 µm are suitable for contact heat 
sealing [30]. While this technique allows excellent encapsulation of printed 
batteries by the direct bonding of the thermoplastic layers of the carrier sub-
strates, it must be considered that even a short period of contact between the 
substrate and the heat jaw causes considerable heat input to the electrochemi-
cal system inside the battery. Reliable heat sealing without damaging the 
printed lead‐out structures of the terminals or the carrier substrate by tearing 
at the heat‐sealed edge depends on controlling the temperature, applied

pressure and pressing time of the heat jaws. In the area of food packaging, 
pressing times of usually less than 0.5 s are applied to achieve proper melting of 
the thermoplastic layers of the substrate, resulting in excellent encapsulation, 
with the barrier capability being defined by the particular material composi-
tion of the substrate. While manual contact heat sealing can be realized by use 
of handsealers (see Figure 7.19), the significant investment costs necessary for 
the sealing unit and individual sealing‐tools for the heat jaws when the layouts 
of the batteries to be encapsulated are changed represents a major drawback of 
this technology. Furthermore, process parameters must be validated according 
to the printing speed and individual material properties to prevent thermal 
degradation of the electrolyte or the carrier substrate.
7.4.6.3  Ultrasonic Welding
Another approach to sealing printed batteries is the application of ultrasonic 
welding, which is also used in the field of food packaging as well as for packag-
ing of many other consumer products, such as electronic devices (e.g. blister 
packaging). Ultrasonic welding is an industrial joining technology whereby 
mechanical sound waves in a thermoplastic are converted into frictional heat 
which is locally applied to substrates held together under pressure, creating 
material bonding at the molecular level and resulting in a solid‐state seam. 
Ultrasonic acoustic vibrations in frequency ranges between 20 kHz and 70 kHz 
are used for ultrasonic welding in the area of packaging materials at advantageous 
sealing times of between 80 ms and 200 ms, enabling short cycle times [31]. 
Figure 7.20 shows details of the components of an ultrasonic welding machine 
with the booster, sonotrode (active tool) and contoured anvil (passive tool) 
Figure 7.19  Manually realized encapsulation of a printed zinc‐based battery with a

defining the shape of the seam. In Figure 7.20 two PET films are welded with 
printed silver tracks of different widths being crossed by the seam. Electrical 
conduction of the printed silver tracks was measured before and after welding 
of the substrates, allowing determination of possible damage to the tracks by 
the generation of the seam.
This technology allows the joining of dissimilar materials, which makes 
ultrasonic welding attractive for the encapsulation of printed batteries consist-
ing of different types of carrier substrates (e.g. printed zinc‐air batteries). 
Another advantage is the local generation of the heat needed for melting of the 
thermoplastics just inside the sealing zone, preventing the carrier substrate 
and the particular electrochemistry of the battery from being thermally 
degraded or damaged. The mechanical vibrations that are introduced into the 
sealing zone prevent any contamination of the melt and thus the bonding by 
driving the contents out of the sealing zone [31]. This is a benefit when batter-
ies with aqueous electrolytes are encapsulated and assures flawless seams. 
Process parameters must be validated for each individual substrate with its 
particular material composition and layer thickness to achieve tight and strong 
bonding of the substrates without destruction of the lower layers, which is nec-
essary for physical stability and barrier capability. Once validated, the settings 
of the process parameters can be digitally saved in a settings file allowing high 
reproducibility of this joining technology. From the materials standpoint, 
ultrasonic welding appears to be the ideal sealing technology for printed bat-
teries as excellent bonding of the substrates can be achieved. Evaluation of 
process parameters is essential to prevent damage to the lead‐outs of the

terminals crossed by the seam, which may result in the electrochemistry of the 
manufactured battery being electrically inaccessible. The design of the 
sonotrode has to be adapted to the particular layout of the printed battery as 
well as to the desired carrier substrate, which causes high tooling costs com-
pared to the printing of adhesives. This technology can be integrated in pro-
duction lines like roll‐to‐roll screen printing machines but it is only an 
economically astute investment when high volumes of printed batteries with 
identical layouts are produced.
7.4.7  Conclusion
The interaction of many materials and processes is vital and determines 
the level of vertical integration in the field of printed batteries. Excellent 
interaction and process capability of all materials and process steps are 
mandatory requirements for high‐volume printing of batteries with reliable 
electrical ­performance characteristics. Table  7.4 shows an evaluation 
matrix of the ­technology‐readiness levels of individual components involved 
in the manufacture of printed NiMH and zinc‐based batteries at ambient 
environment.

The evaluated criteria in Table 7.4 show that significant progress has been 
made in the field of printed zinc‐carbon batteries, with zinc chloride as elec-
trolyte constituting the most technologically advanced printed battery system 
thus far. Excellent interaction and process capability of the individual compo-
nents enable production of zinc‐carbon batteries in industrial quantities with 
sheet‐fed or roll‐to‐roll screen printing machines. Despite being a promising 
technology with a high level of vertical integration, a major drawback that has 
impeded industrial manufacture of printed batteries until now is represented 
by the deficit of automated in‐line quality assurance systems with respect to 
electrical functionality and encapsulation.
7.5  ­Industrial Applications and Combination 
With Other Flexible Electronic Devices
During the past decade many market analyses with the aim of identifying suit-
able applications for printed batteries have been performed. Various criteria 
need to be taken into account before devices powered by printed and flexible 
batteries are designed:
●
●primary or rechargeable battery
●
●separate battery or “printegration”
●
●costly but high‐quality application or low‐cost application.
These aspects need to be evaluated carefully before a type of battery is 
selected for each particular application. From an economic point of view, these 
aspects determine whether the desired application is feasible and reasonable or 
not. Potential applications can be located in various market segments ranging 
from low cost, like advertising, gaming or RFID, over medium cost, like moni-
toring of environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, humidity, gas composi-
tion), up to high cost, like health‐monitoring devices (e.g. blood glucose, 
lactate). Thus far, two areas of application have been identified as having the 
most promising outlook for widespread implementation of printed batteries in 
high quantities.
7.5.1  Self‐powered Temperature Loggers
These objects consist of a printed circuit, an antenna, a printed battery and a 
silicon chip. The attached silicon chip provides all functionalities necessary: 
temperature sensor, analog‐to‐digital converter (ADC), μController and near‐
field communication data transmission. Initially, the circuitry and antenna are 
printed with a highly conductive silver printing paste on the substrate. The 
battery can be hybridized or directly printed on the substrate in subsequent 
printing steps. Finally, the chip is mounted by pick‐and‐place technology.

Industrial Perspective on Printed Batteries
221
Printing technologies enable the possibility of producing smart labels that 
combine sensor functionality and temperature‐data‐logging capabilities in a 
cost‐effective way. These printed temperature loggers (T‐Loggers) can be tai-
lored to customer‐specific requirements. Furthermore, the small and particu-
larly thin credit card‐sized form factor enables temperature logging at item 
level and not just at pallet or package level. Figure 7.21 shows two possible 
layout variations for temperature loggers, both with the same overall footprint 
but with different antenna and battery area usage. The adaptability of the sys-
tem components, e.g. the capacity or the nominal voltage of the battery, which 
can be modified by printing series‐ or parallel‐connections, enable adaptation 
of the T‐Logger to product‐specific requirements.
The manufactured smart labels can be programmed and controlled to record 
a temperature history at defined intervals via the corresponding smartphone 
app. The data is stored in the attached silicon chip and can be read out by a 
smartphone or other device with NFC capability anytime and anywhere 
throughout the supply chain. Once the data set has been read out by a mobile 
device, it can be directly uploaded to the cloud for further data processing.
The charts presented in Figure 7.22 and Figure 7.23 show exemplary data 
protocols recorded in a freezer and a heating cabinet and thus demonstrate 
the typical temperature limits of these printed battery‐powered NFC logging 
devices.
The charts presented in Figures 7.22 and 7.23 demonstrate clearly that the 
battery voltage is directly related to the occurring temperatures. The battery 
voltage decreases in cold environments and increases when the battery is 
heated. This makes the battery the active element of such self‐powered logging 
devices by which the operating temperature range is defined. Typical operating 
temperatures range between –20 °C and 50 °C. The temperature accuracy and 
the temperature resolution are defined by the type of sensor integrated into the 
silicon chip. The memory size and thus the recording period of the T‐Logger 
are defined by the specifications of the silicon chip that is selected and attached.

7.5.2  Smart Packaging Devices
Devices for smart packaging are predicted to have a broad range of fields of 
application. They can be used for advertising purposes, such as talking packag-
ing, for illuminated boxes, such as high‐value packaging, for noble beverages, 
and for logistical purposes in a similar way to RFID transponders.
The specified applications involve smart objects consisting of several printed 
components that are combined to provide the desired functionality. The 
printed battery can be hybridized or directly printed on the particular object, 
which is referred to printegration. From the cost and production point of view 
it is important that all components can be printed on the same substrate.

Industrial Perspective on Printed Batteries
223
Combinations of components printed on different types of substrate increase 
the complexity of the production process by the need for connecting elements. 
Furthermore, any process that cannot be integrated into a continuous produc-
tion process decreases production speed resulting in increased manufacturing 
costs as well as increased unit costs of the final product.
Basically, an increased number of components also increases the degree of 
complexity and complicates the transfer of the production process to an indus-
trial scale. Growing complexity of products also reduces production yield 
because a higher number of components may potentially fail during the manu-
facturing process. Components that cannot be realized by printing technolo-
gies must be attached by other technologies like pick‐and‐place. In general, the 
combination of printed batteries with other printed objects opens entirely new 
areas of applications and access to large and predominantly self‐perpetuating 
markets like the packaging or medical sectors.
7.6  ­Industrial Perspective on Printed Batteries
Printed batteries must be seen in the context of traditionally manufactured 
batteries. Conventional batteries are produced with state‐of‐the‐art (SOA) 
technology and machine techniques. The casings are made separately of metal 
or plastic and the electrodes are produced as pellets, pastes or foils. The sepa-
rator is made of fiber fleece or microporous membranes made of plastics and 
the electrolyte is usually in a liquid state. Accordingly, the production equip-
ment is built of highly advanced machinery that automatically mounts and 
handles objects at high process speeds and in short cycle times. The tooling 
costs are significant and the design flexibility is low. The mechanical limit of 
the electrode thickness is in the order of 1 mm.
In contrast to conventional batteries the production of printed smart 
objects can be realized on standard sheet‐to‐sheet or roll‐to‐roll printing 
machines that are widely used for the production of labels or packaging 
material. Many process steps are well known and layout changes can be easily 
performed at comparatively low costs. Printed batteries are only applicable 
for overall thicknesses of up to 1 mm to ensure the advantage of their thin 
and flexible character.
7.6.1  Competition with Conventional Batteries
For the reasons given above, printed batteries are at present unable to com-
pete with conventional batteries. Conventional batteries reveal higher energy 
densities due to better volume ratio of the active masses to the passive compo-
nents. While the volume of the casings is comparatively low, most of the over-
all volume of the batteries can be captured by the active masses of the 

Printed Batteries
224
electrodes. Applications like portable electronic devices (e.g. smartphones, 
tablets, notebooks) require high energy and high power and thus will be 
equipped with SOA batteries into the future. The advantage of printed batter-
ies is the provision of thin and flexible power sources with overall thickness of 
less than 1 mm, thus opening new markets that are inaccessible to SOA batter-
ies. The energy densities of printed batteries are comparatively low due to the 
adverse volume ratio of active masses and passive materials. For example, the 
active masses of printed ZnMnO2 batteries are represented by the zinc anode 
with typical layer thickness of approximately 75 µm and the manganese diox-
ide cathode layer with typical thickness of about 100 µm. Components that are 
passive as regards the electrochemical cell reactions are represented by the 
particular carrier substrate with usual thickness of around 120 µm, the cur-
rent collectors (10 µm), the passivation layer made of carbon (35 µm) as well as 
the electrolyte/separator combination, exhibiting a characteristic thickness of 
about 20 µm if printed. The specified values are for coplanar batteries and 
need to be doubled for sandwich‐type batteries in stack configuration. These 
aspects exclude printed batteries from competing with conventional manu-
factured batteries with standardized layouts. But their thin and flexible design 
makes printed batteries the product of choice when flexible and non‐stand-
ardized power sources are needed.
The production of conventional batteries as a separate item is a benefit of 
SOA batteries. The separate production of the power source allows 100% 
monitoring of important quality parameters of each individual battery. Usually 
quality control comprises measurement of the open‐circuit voltage (OCV) and 
closed circuit voltage (CCV). The separate production of the battery and the 
particular application or product is economical and highly standardized.
Quality assurance is also possible for printed batteries that are used for 
hybridization and connected afterwards to the particular product on a sepa-
rate assembly line. Thus, testing of the functionality of the batteries can be 
performed after the final process step of battery manufacture. Failed samples 
can be marked and excluded from further production steps. Performance 
checks can also be performed on printegrated batteries at the end of the pro-
duction. In this case quality assurance covers function testing of the complete 
application. If a malfunction is detected, the complete product has to be 
rejected; this causes high expense if quality defects are not detected at an early 
stage of the manufacturing process.
Higher voltages can be realized by printing series connections of the particu-
lar electrochemical system. The nominal voltage of a single cell is then multi-
plied by the number of cells printed. Figure 7.24 shows a fully printed series 
connection of an alkaline zinc‐carbon battery realized by screen printing of 20 
cells and a printed electrolyte/separator combination.
Series connections of primary battery systems can be printed without prob-
lems. The resulting capacity of the series connection is equal to the lowest 

Industrial Perspective on Printed Batteries
225
capacity of the single cells. Printing of rechargeable battery systems may cause 
problems by an uneven state of charge (SOC) of the single cells. Then the low-
est cell can be deeply discharged and driven into reverse followed by complete 
destruction of the particular cell. Protective circuitry is available and provides 
a charge balancing between the single cells of large SOA batteries in multicell 
configurations. The proper function of this protective circuitry requires a bat-
tery management system (BMS); otherwise these circuits are inoperable. 
Precise and repeatable printing of the electrode layers and continuous quality 
assurance with respect to layer thickness and determination of the deposited 
active masses of the electrodes avoids the manufacture of cells with uneven 
states of charge and thus deep discharges of individual cells during their life‐
cycle. Market development for printed batteries strongly depends on future 
market trends for smart objects. Those market trends are driven by customer 
demands but even more by political directives.
7.6.2  Cold Chain Monitoring
Cold chain monitoring is a reasonable and promising application for T‐Loggers 
powered by printed batteries for an individual recording period. Up to now it 
has been important to control and track the cold chain of products during 
transport. Fields of application for T‐Loggers range from consumer products 
of daily life, such as frozen food, to highly sensitive areas like the monitoring of 
transport conditions for blood reserves, when a certain temperature cannot be 
exceeded. The existing measurement equipment is too expensive and makes

zinc‐carbon battery (alkaline) with a nominal voltage of 30 V consisting of 20 cells.

number: FP7 – 287568.

Printed Batteries

controlling and tracking of temperatures of individual products impossible. 
High availability of self‐powered and fully printed T‐Loggers at acceptable 
prices would initiate increasing demand, with more and more transported 
goods being equipped with these monitoring devices.
7.6.3  Health‐monitoring Devices
Demographic change in populations has led to an ever‐increasing number of 
older people who need to be supported in their daily lives. Growing demand 
for affordable health‐monitoring equipment for the surveillance of blood pres-
sure, heart rate, breathing rate, blood‐glucose levels and many more values is 
noted. The development of flexible and self‐powered monitoring devices ena-
bles improvements in the care and treatment of older people. Existing moni-
toring devices are powered by small SOA batteries and thus are inconvenient 
to carry due to their rigid construction. Printed thin and flexible devices would 
make the lives of patients and older people much easier through their adaptable 
designs. Future trends in the medical sector must be observed carefully so that 
the industry is prepared when the need for printed smart objects increases.
7.7  ­Conclusion
The large number of current research activities in the area of printed batteries 
indicates the continuing interest in getting this technology ready for the mar-
ket. Innovative and directly printegrated applications like self‐powered moni-
toring devices are predicted to be the most likely to enter the market in high 
quantities within the next few years. Compared to conventional battery manu-
facturing methods, printing technologies are characterized as cost‐effective 
and highly flexible technologies and thus as economic solutions for both small 
and larger batch sizes of printed batteries and other functionalities with indi-
vidual layouts and specifications.
Recently, the first T‐Loggers powered by fully screen‐printed primary bat-
teries for cold chain monitoring of logistic services were reported. Extending 
the product range for printed battery applications requires further research in 
the areas of material sciences, functional printing technologies and packaging 
technologies. With more primary and secondary electrochemical systems 
being accessible by printing technologies, the number of potential applications 
and devices with higher demands on battery voltages and power outputs 
will subsequently increase. Further improvements in printed batteries with 
respect to electrical performance parameters, life‐cycle and reliability are of 
the highest importance as well.
For the moment, printed electronics, especially printed batteries, are con-
sidered more likely to be a technology‐push. It is essential to motivate and

persuade customers to generate a significant market‐pull for printed and 
­flexible electronics devices. Progress will be the greatest when technology‐
push and market‐pull have nearly reached a balanced level. This condition is 
foreseen to accelerate the development of further innovative products with 
integrated printed power sources.

The battery proposed by Volta in 1800 showed the possibility for storing 
­electrical energy using chemical reactions. Today, it remains a technological 
highlight and a revolutionary discovery. Throughout the last century, many 
types of batteries, including NiCd: nickel‐cadmium, NiMH: nickel‐metal 
hydride, and, in particular, Li‐lithium, have been developed, representing 
­relevant technological advances [1].
In light of advances in printed electronics, the junction between battery 
technologies and printing techniques has resulted in printed batteries, which 
represent an alternative to conventional batteries in many applications, such as 
wearable and portable devices.
As we have seen in this book, the main printed battery types that have been 
developed are Zn/MnO2 and lithium‐ion, and one of the most important 
attributes of printed batteries is their being customizable for small, thin, light-
weight devices, an area where a promising future is expected.
Figure 8.1 summarizes the main characteristics of printed batteries; the most 
relevant challenges to be tackled are to increase current and energy density of 
the battery.
Cost, safety and ease of integration are also challenges that require particular 
attention.
These challenges are important not only for current applications of printed 
batteries such as RFID devices, smart cards, sensors and wearable and medical 
devices, but also for smart objects, increasingly demanded in the scope of the 
growing “Internet of Things, IoT” concept [2] (Figure 8.2).

Thus, the continuous and increasing advances in the areas of smart and 
functional materials technology strongly support the Internet of Things to 
become a ubiquitous network where everything is connected to the Internet 
[3, 4]. This new paradigm brings new functionalities to the service and pro-
duction sectors, among others, allowing increasing efficiency, speeded up 
processes and the incorporation of more complex and flexible organizational 
systems [5, 6].
In the rapidly growing field of the Internet of Things, smart things/objects 
require batteries that are flexible, light and cheap, with rapid charging and a 
large variety of durations; thus, printed batteries are among the most suitable 
solutions for many applications.
For the fabrication of printed batteries, the choice of printing technique 
requires particular attention, taking into account the ink properties for each

component of the battery, with inkjet, screen and spray printing being the most 
frequently used printing techniques.
Recently, 3D printing technologies are being applied to the development of 
printed batteries. This technology has been successfully applied to all compo-
nents of the battery (electrodes and separator/electrolyte) and can be appro-
priate for industrial‐scale production [7].
Thus, 3D‐printed interdigitated electrodes have been developed, leading to 
fast insertion kinetics of ions at increasing specific currents [8].
Further, 3D Li‐ion batteries based on LiMn0.21Fe0.79PO4 (LMFP) nanocrystal 
cathodes exhibited better long‐term stability than the coated‐electrode Li‐ion 
battery, also showing high charge/discharge rate and high capacity in com-
parison to conventional batteries [9]. Similarly, 3D printable Li‐ion battery 
electrolyte has been produced, yielding a high‐performance printed electrode 
membrane assembly [10].
Control of the ink properties is an essential step in the successful develop-
ment of printing devices. Thus, the rheology of the ink for each component of 
the battery should be optimized to ensure reliable flow, promote adhesion 
between each printed layer and electrical and mechanical stability, provide 
structural integrity and avoid cracking during the drying process. Inks have to 
be tailored for a specific printing technology in terms of viscosity and surface 
tension. Further, the substrate and its intrinsic properties are other important 
factors that affect the application of printing systems and the production of 
printable materials [11]. The majority of printable materials are in the form of 
solutions, which require specific properties to allow proper printing, such as 
nanoparticle dispersion or a moderate and suitable level of chemical and physi-
cal stabilities [12].
Among the different components of printed batteries, the one that requires 
special attention is the separator/electrolyte, due to its high ionic conductivity 
and electrochemical, thermal and mechanical stability.
This battery component needs further development and the incorporation 
of ionic liquids in the polymer solutions appears a promising solution for 
improving the actual performance of printable separators/electrolytes. Further, 
novel engineered (nano)materials for the different components are continu-
ously being developed, allowing further increase in printed battery energy 
density.
It is important to note that printed batteries also allow the development of 
new, unconventional geometries, allowing better integration into planar, flexi-
ble devices or devices with complex geometries.
The most relevant issues to be overcome in order to increase battery perfor-
mance are related to the understanding and optimization of the interfaces of 
the different printed layers. This issue must be solved, not only to increase 
battery performance, but also to improve scalability of printed batteries and 
reduce production costs.

Open Questions, Challenges and Outlook
233
The aforementioned primary challenges, among others, will drive the main 
research activity in this field, allowing printed batteries to move forward and 
to provide a new generation of wearables, portable devices and smart solu-
tions for the Internet of Things, thus powering a lighter, friendlier and more 
flexible future.
