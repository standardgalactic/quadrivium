About the Authors
Larry Ullman is the Director of Digital Media Technologies at DMC Insights, Inc., and the
author of several computer books. In addition to writing, Larry develops dynamic Web
applications, conducts training seminars, and is an Extension Instructor for the
University of California at Berkeley. He’s been working with Apple computers for more
than 20 years, starting with the Apple IIe back in the dark (or monochrome) ages.
When he’s not tinkering on his Mac, Larry spends his time reading, remodeling his
house, and, given the time, napping in front of the fireplace. Larry currently lives outside
of Washington, D.C., with his wife of nine years, Jessica.
Marc Liyanage is a senior software engineer at futureLAB AG, a research and develop-
ment company focusing on emerging Internet, telecommunications, and wireless 
technologies.
He’s been using and programming Macintosh computers professionally for 15 years for
desktop publishing, video and TV screen design, and software development. He’s been a
UNIX user and software engineer for the past ten years in the Internet/ISP industry,
doing commercial Web application work and large-scale ISP systems design and imple-
mentation using open source software packages. He has also taught classes on XML and
trained junior software engineers.
He’s been a Mac OS X user and developer since the first beta versions, and he’s very
excited about this OS because it brings together the elegance of the Macintosh with the
power of UNIX. In his spare time, he runs the developer-oriented Mac OS X Web site
www.entropy.ch, writes Cocoa software, and tinkers with his Mac.
His other spare-time interests include graphic design, typography, and digital photogra-
phy. He enjoys watching and reading science fiction movies and books. Marc lives in
Zurich, Switzerland.


Dedication
We dedicate this book to the good people at Apple. Thanks for designing wicked hard-
ware, putting out the best operating system we’ve ever used (that’d be OS X), giving
away some top-notch software, and demonstrating that there’s nothing wrong with a
computer that’s cool, feature-rich, secure, and stable.
Marc would like to also dedicate this book to his mother, Martina.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
As always, thanks to Jessica for her support.
Our thanks to everyone at Wiley and at Waterside.
A special shout-out to David at Apple, for being such a swell guy.
Thanks to my excellent co-author, Marc, both for his much-needed assistance with this
book as well as for the copious amount of work and support he has done for the Mac OS X
platform over the years.
Last but not least, my sincerest gratitude goes out to you, the reader. Thanks for having
such good taste in both computers and books!
—Larry Ullman
First and foremost, big thanks to Larry Ullman for inviting me to join him on this book
project and for being a great guy to work with. I enjoyed every minute and learned a lot
on the way.
Thanks to my friends at futureLAB for making this the best work place in the world!
Finally, thanks to my brother Andy for being a great friend.
—Marc Liyanage

Introduction
W
e’re fairly smart people, and presumably you’re a really smart per-
son (you are looking at the right book, after all), but it seems like
technology evolves faster than we do. Even the magical Mac — the
symbol of all things easy in the computer world — is chock full of features
and gadgets and bells and whistles and pretty lights. (Okay, the lights are
on the outside, but . . .) Make no mistake: You’ll love these things, once
you know what they all are and how to use them, that is. So the question
is How do I get from point A (merely having the features) to point B (doing
what I want/need to do, quickly and easily)?
By reading this book, of course!
But if that isn’t enough to convince you (and we can’t imagine why not;
after all, we’ve never lied to you before), take a moment or two to read
through this introduction. We tell you where we’re coming from, what this
book offers, and how it’ll make you fall in love with your Mac all over again.
Saving Time with This Book
The Timesaving Techniques For Dummies books focus on high-payoff tech-
niques that save you time, either immediately or over the long haul. And
these books get to the point in a hurry, with step-by-step instructions to
take you through the tasks you need to do, without any of the fluff you
don’t want. We’ve identified more than 60 techniques that Mac OS X Tiger
users need to know to make the most of their computers. In addition, each
technique includes lots of figures that make following along a breeze.
Decide for yourself how to use this book: Read it cover to cover if you
like, or skip right to the technique that interests you the most.
In Mac OS X Tiger Timesaving Techniques For Dummies, you can find out
how to

Tame time-consuming tasks: Because we demystify the inner workings
of Mac OS X Tiger for you, letting you in on more than 60 tips and
tricks along the way, you can spend more time making computer magic
and less time fussing around.

Take your skills up a notch: You’re already familiar with the basics of
using Mac OS X. Now this book takes you to the next level, helping you
become an even savvier Mac user. The things you’ll discover will amaze
your friends, scare your enemies, and duly impress your boss.

Introduction
2
well, we release a new version of this book. And for
good reason, too: There’s oodles of new information
you ought to have.
For starters, there are five entirely new techniques in
this book. The first is a guide for users switching
from Windows to a Mac. (We know you’re out there.)
The second offers interface suggestions to those
Mac users with special needs, a strong suit of Tiger
and one that many people aren’t aware of. Third,
we’ve been using the Address Book more and more
and feel you should, too, so we now give that appli-
cation its own treatment. The same goes for Safari:
We use other Web browsers, yes, but Safari really
earns its Mac dominance. Therefore, we dedicate a
second Safari chapter to customizing and tweaking
the application, adding features you won’t believe
you lived without. The fifth new chapter shows you
how to use Automator, Tiger’s scripting tool. If you
have sequences you often do, knowing how to auto-
mate them goes a long way towards increasing your
productivity. 
Beyond the new techniques, we did revamp all the
other existing material so that it continues to show
you the most accurate, timesaving ideas we know of.
In some cases, this means highlighting new features of
the operating system (like searching for files by using
Spotlight). In other cases, this means showing you
how to use some great piece of free- or shareware. 
All in all, every single page has been reviewed, re-read,
checked for accuracy, and partially rewritten. Besides
being more up to date, a rough calculation determined
that this book is now 37 percent more timesaving-y.
Foolish Assumptions
Every book is written with certain assumptions
about the reader, and this one is no exception. Don’t
be alarmed: We aren’t looking for an advanced
degree in computer science or the ability to recall
long lists of Mac trivia at parties. We do expect two
things of you:

Customize Mac OS X to meet your needs:
Spending some upfront time customizing Mac OS
X so that it works faster, more reliably, and more
like how you work on a daily basis can save you
time (and aggravation) later. Even if you’re not
an organized person by habit, rest assured that
at least your Mac will be in shipshape condition.
What’s New in Tiger
Tiger has big new features and applications as well
as nice, little additions to existing software. On the
big scale, there is Spotlight, a most excellent search
tool for finding things on your computer (see
Technique 21). There is also Dashboard, a widget
mechanism that’s part of Exposé (Technique 15),
which is both cool and useful. Last, in Part IX of the
book, you find out how to use Automator, our new
best friend.
If you’re the kind of person that appreciates the little
things, you’ll like the Safari changes, like the ability to
access RSS feeds (in you don’t know what these are,
march on over to Technique 30). You might also enjoy
the transformation of iChat AV, which can now do
video or audio conferencing (Technique 36). These
are just a few of the 150 changes Apple says are in
Tiger. We haven’t counted them all ourselves, but we
do like what we see and think you will, too.
Apple also added a whole slew of other behind-the-
scenes features to Tiger: new graphics and video tech-
nology; support for 64-bit processors (like the G5); a
new kernel (the very, very heart of the operating sys-
tem); and improved support for multi-processor Macs.
Yes, these additions are nice and new and they’ll pos-
sibly make your computer do some things faster, but
that’s all we really have to say about them with
respect to timesaving techniques in this book.
What’s New in This Book
When Apple says “Jump,” we say “How high?” When
Apple releases a new version of its glorious OS, we,

A Macintosh, running Tiger (Mac OS X v.4):
Well, to be perfectly frank, if you aren’t running
Tiger (but are running another version of Mac OS
X), you can still get a lot of things out of this
book; you just can’t do everything this book says
you can do. This requirement is more of a highly
advisable suggestion.

Basic familiarity with your computer: In some
ways, this is the same kind of For Dummies book
you’ve come to know and love, but it isn’t the
kind that shows you how to plug in a printer or
save a document. (It shows you how easy it is to
share a printer on a network and how you can
save documents faster, though.) We promise that
you won’t be overwhelmed by anything in this
book, but keep in mind that you won’t be spoon-
fed, either.
Having a fast Internet connection will help you get
the most out of this book, and so will a little extra
spending money (but just a little). But neither of
these are required as long as you have a Mac and a
willingness — or a need — to discover how to use
your computer better.
How This Book Is Organized
As devoted Mac users, we’ve amassed a gazillion
pieces of useful knowledge. By sheer luck, it turned
out that these little pieces could be organized 
into techniques, which are chapter-like sections
grouped by application or the general concept
being discussed. These techniques were then
herded together into larger parts, which we’re 
calling (appropriately enough) parts (we’re clever
that way). Right here we give you the highlights 
as to what each part is all about, but remember
that you can approach this book the way you want
to. Read a part straight through, skip from technique
to technique, or just pick out the little pieces most
relevant to the way you work. This book has a struc-
ture, but you can be a free thinker. You own a Mac,
after all!
Part I: Starting, Stopping, and Running 
Your Mac Faster
This first part of the book focuses exclusively on how
to get the machine and operating system to load and
run faster — in other words, how to speed up the
process between pushing the power button and actu-
ally doing anything. While we’re at it, we also discuss
some faster aspects of the installation process and
the easiest ways to shut down and log out. These
might be the basics of using your computer, but even
here, you find ways to do things more efficiently.
Finally, if you’re new to the Mac world, the chapter
on making the conversion from a Windows mindset
should help ease that transition. (Here’s a preview:
It isn’t as big of a jump as you might think.) 
Part II: Optimizing Your Interface
Comprehending how best to interact with your com-
puter is the foundation for just about everything.
Hence, this is the general guide to doing anything
better. The heart of Part II is navigation techniques,
both with the keyboard and the mouse. You also dis-
cover how to customize the Finder, windows, and
the Dock. All in all, the absolutely most-universal
and most-helpful timesaving techniques are here.
Part III: Handling Files (And Other Stuff) Quickly
Like a teenager’s closet, your Mac is full of stuff. Who
knows what it all is? Okay, we know, and we think
you should, too. Although your hard drive might not
yet be bursting, there’s always going to be a lot of
junk in there. This third part of the book demon-
strates how to best organize, manage, and find your
(and your computer’s) stuff. You also see how to
save hard drive space and remove clutter by trash-
ing unnecessary files.
Part IV: Improving Application Performance
Included on your computer (see Part III) are 
applications — software that does stuff with other
stuff (not to be too technical about it). The focus

your software up to date, and the like. Think of this
as the An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of
cure section of the book.
Part IX: The Scary Or Fun Stuff
Whether you know it or not, your Mac is a powerful
machine capable of some really, really cool things.
The final part of the book strongly emphasizes our
friend, the Terminal, and gives a nod to Automator,
a tool for making your own timesaving techniques.
If you’re looking for something more fun and less
scary, check out the technique on using your cell
phone with your Mac or the one on screen savers.
Conventions Used in This Book
This book has a lot of visual stuff in it to help guide
you along the way. You know . . . different fonts and
icons, indentations, and a few funny characters.
Here’s a Rosetta Stone as to what they all mean:

Keyboard shortcuts: This book has a healthy
amount of keyboard shortcuts in it. These use a
conjoining minus sign to indicate that two (or
more) keys should be pressed in harmony. So
when you see something like Ô-A (the Select All
shortcut), you should press and hold Ô, press A
once, and then release both. Something like
Control-click means that you hold down the
Control key while clicking the mouse button once.

Menu bar: The menu bar is the thing going
across the entire top of your window. It has all
the, you know, menus, but in bar form.

Menu sequences: Sequences of menus are refer-
enced with an arrow. For example, Go➪Recent
Folders means that you should click the Go
menu (on the menu bar) and then choose the
Recent Folders submenu from there.

Apple menu: The Apple menu, represented by
the Ú symbol, is that blue Apple symbol in the
upper-left corner of your window. (It’s shaded
differently from the rest of the menu bar in Tiger.)
isn’t on any one specific application here but rather
on some useful knowledge for using any application
more efficiently.
Part V: Cranking Up Your Internet Activities
As Homer Simpson says, “They have the Internet on
computers now.” Well, the man’s never been more
correct. Accessing e-mail and the World Wide Web
are why many people have computers. Most folks
spend a decent portion of their computing life in this
realm. Part V covers Web browsers, performing
searches, using e-mail, and other online timesaving
techniques. Tips on stopping spam and using Google
effectively can save you minutes per day — minutes
you could spend surfing the Internet.
Part VI: Optimizing Your Network
The networking section of the book is Part V’s coun-
terpart. Although not every user has advanced net-
working needs, most could benefit from using
locations, working with an iDisk, and knowing how
to easily connect to other computers when the time
comes. You have a network of some sort, you have a
bunch o’ wires (or not), and you need to make them
all play nicely together.
Part VII: Fast and Furious Multimedia
Apple markets itself as the multimedia machine, and
with good reason: The free software that comes with
the operating system is exceptional. In the multi-
media section of the book, we take a few of these
applications and demonstrate how to more efficiently
use them. For you lucky iPod users, you see what
else that beautiful little toy can do for your day-to-
day productivity.
Part VIII: Security and Maintenance 
Okay, so your Mac pretty much takes care of itself.
Still, a little TLC couldn’t hurt. Part VIII (that’s eight
to you and me) offers you all the motherly advice
you can use on viruses, creating backups, keeping

Comments and Questions


Application menus: When we refer to an applica-
tion menu, we mean the menu that has the title of
the application and appears between the Apple
menu and the File menu. So in the Finder, it’s
called Finder; in Microsoft Word, it’s called Word;
in iTunes, it’s called iTunes. 

Monospace font: Web sites (URLs) and e-mail
addresses are in their own special monospace
font, which looks like www.apple.com. On-screen
messages and text in the Terminal also look
like this.

User entry: Stuff you should type appears in
bold, like this: Type How now, brown cow?.
Icons Used in This Book
This book is littered with lots of little tidbits and
notes, set aside by different icons. In due time, you’ll
probably identify the pattern for what each icon rep-
resents, but here’s a quick heads-up:
Tips are just extra ideas that we think you’ll
appreciate. Although not life-altering, tips are
our way of saying, “Hey, you know what else
you could try?” 
These icons reemphasize the timesaving point
we’re making in a certain section. If you don’t
feel like reading through all those pesky words
and get tired of our trite jokes, look for these.
This icon means that you’ve seen this idea
before, you’ll see this idea again, and you
ought to keep it in mind. These are publish-
ing’s version of sticky notes or Stickies, in Mac
terms. 
For crying out loud, pay close attention to any-
thing marked with this icon! If you don’t believe
anything else that we say, trust us on these
warning icons. Think curiosity and cat here and
how that went. You won’t see many warnings
in this book, but when you do, understand that
you might be about to take an irrevocable step. 
Comments and Questions
We’d like to think that this book was everything you
wanted or needed, and that you have no more com-
ments, problems, questions, and the like. But writing
can be a cruel mistress (we don’t know what that
means, either, but it sounds bad), and no book is
ever comprehensive. If you have something to say or
ask, here are some places to turn:

Web site. Feel free to leave all sorts of feedback,
including praise (Woo-hoo!), complaints (D’oh!),

Mac OS X Tiger Timesaving Techniques For
Dummies, the Web site (www.dmcinsights.
com/mactst): At Larry’s Web site, we’re maintain-
ing a separate section that focuses solely on this

forth. Plus, you can also find our contact infor-
mation and the link to the supporting forum.

e-mail), but you’ll also hear what other readers
have to say. Make sure, though, that you mention
what version of OS X you’re using (Panther,
Tiger, and so on), just to be clear.

Installing Tiger
without the Hassle
B
efore you can discover the magic of Apple’s latest, greatest operating
system, you need a version of it running on your Mac. You might
even wonder whether Mac OS X Tiger is right for you. Because
you’re holding this book, the answer is presumably yes, but to explain why,
we begin this technique by discussing some of Tiger’s benefits and new
technologies.
The installation process itself has a few variables, and comprehending
the different choices can not only save you time during the installation
process but give you a more appropriate version of the operating system.
You should also be able to make knowledgeable decisions about format-
ting and partitioning your hard drive before you install the OS. Finally, we
show you how to breeze through the Setup Assistant (Apple’s program for
easing you through the startup process) and then wrap up with a discus-
sion of foolproof file transfers.
What Tiger Can Do for You
Whereas Panther added a ton of obvious new features to the operating
system and Apple applications, Tiger’s additions are more subtle,
although no less useful. Compared to its predecessor (Panther), what
you find new in Tiger is

Apple also recommends that you have at least 128MB of
RAM (we recommend 256MB or more, but you can get
away with less if you never use Tiger’s Classic mode), a sup-
ported display, and at least 2GB of available hard drive
space. (You need 3.5GB if you want to install the Developer
Tools, as well.) You’re welcome to attempt to install Tiger
even if you don’t meet the requirements, but you do risk
having a bum computer and wasting a whole heck of a lot
of time in the process.
Choosing an Installation Method
If you just purchased a brand new Mac, making 
yourself the envy of the neighborhood, you should
be sitting there with a fresh copy of Tiger purring
away. In that case, you can skip ahead to the section
“Working with Setup Assistant” to see how to whip
through the Setup Assistant. If you don’t have Tiger
installed yet but are the proud owner of some shiny
new installation discs (or a single shiny DVD), it’s
time to put them to use.
Before you begin, take a minute to think about what
type of installation you want. You have three options:

Upgrade a previous version of Mac OS X:
Upgrading is the easiest and least time-consuming
option to use — in the short run, that is. One
drawback, however, to upgrading an existing OS is
that your hard drive becomes bloated with dead-
wood files. The resulting OS can be a little buggy,
inheriting problems from its predecessor.
If you want to install Tiger and get on with
your life with a minimum of fuss, choose the
upgrade option.
Apple has also made quite a few behind-the-scenes
alterations that you probably aren’t aware of but
which might make for a faster Mac. Tiger supports 
64-bit addressing (a good but very geeky thing); dual
processors (like the higher end G5); a new kernel (an
even geekier thing); and new graphics and video infra-
structure. There’s really nothing more to say about
these new features in this book (because, well, they
just do their thing behind the scenes), but we wanted
you to know that Tiger adds more than just the visible
applications and features that we mention.
All these improvements and new features can be
yours for the low, low cost of . . . okay, the not-so-low
cost of $129. But it is a beauty of an operating system.
The price of Tiger ($129) is the same whether
you’re upgrading from an earlier version of
OS X or buying a version of OS X for the first
time. 
To further convince you, consider that an overriding
benefit of installing Tiger is that you’ll be using the
most current version of Apple’s operating system.
This means that you can take advantage of all of
Apple’s future development of applications and
patches, which will be designed with Tiger in mind.
If you own more than one Mac, consider the
Family Pack version of Tiger, which gives you
license to install the OS on up to five machines
for the bargain price of $199. If time truly is
money, this tip alone could save you hours!
Minimum System Requirements
To use Tiger, Apple recommends that you have one of the
following computers:

Managing Your Hard Drives
11

Erase and Install: This option is the most taxing,
time-consuming, and drastic of the three. On the
bright side, you do end up with an untouched
hard drive and a brand spankin’ new OS. On the
other hand, you wipe out all your files and appli-
cations in the process.
Absolutely, positively do not use the Erase and
Install option unless you’ve got multiple back-
ups of all your files, drivers, and software. This
option does exactly what it says: erases the
contents of your entire hard drive.

Archive and Install: This happy medium between
the other two installation choices creates a new
system folder with new copies of all the OS stuff,
but it also allows you to maintain all the user files
and non-Apple applications. Although Apple 
doesn’t promote this feature as the recommended
type of installation, we’re quite fond of it our-
selves. It gives you the benefit of a clean system
folder (minus the deadwood created by an
upgrade) without the serious drawback of having
to reinstall all your applications and files.
The Archive and Install option throws all the
existing system files and Apple applications in
a folder called Previous Systems. After you’re
convinced that no valuable information has
been overwritten by the recent installation,
delete this folder to clear up space on your
hard drive.
Managing Your Hard Drives
Along with deciding what type of installation you
want to perform, another topic worth your consider-
ation before you install Tiger is the formatting and
partitioning of your hard drive (or drives). To clarify:

Formatting a hard drive is the process of erasing
its contents and telling the blank drive how to
structure the files that will later be stored on it.

Partitioning a hard drive is the process of break-
ing a single drive into multiple volumes. Your
computer still has the same number of physical
hard drives, but the operating system behaves as
if there were more. (Each volume appears as a
separate drive in Finder and other software.)
Practically anything you do with the Disk
Utility application requires erasing your entire
hard drive. Although Disk Utility warns you
before it does anything so drastic, we advise
you not to use the application unless you’ve
first backed up everything that you need.
You accomplish both of these tasks by using the
Disk Utility application (see Figure 1-1), which you
can find in the Utilities folder and on the first (or
only) Tiger installation disc. If you have multiple
drives or volumes, Disk Utility can format or parti-
tion any volume except for the one on which it
resides (because it can’t erase itself). If you want to
format or partition the drive that contains Disk
Utility, you need to boot your Mac from the installa-
tion discs.
• Figure 1-1: The Disk Utility application manages your
hard drives.

Technique 1: Installing Tiger without the Hassle
12
 Mac OS Extended (Journaled): You don’t
really need to understand the details of what
journaling does to appreciate that it allows
you to more accurately recover your com-
puter in the event of a disaster. Feel free to
use this format because Apple now uses it as
the default.
 Mac OS Extended: This used to be the default
format and is also a safe choice.
 MS-DOS: MS-DOS . . . a Windows-compatible
format. Yuck.
 UNIX File System: If you choose to format
with UFS, you render the hard drive unrecog-
nizable by some operating systems (in partic-
ular, OS 9). For this reason, we advise you to
stay away from it.
4.
Enter the volume’s name (see Figure 1-3) in the
Name text box.
• Figure 1-3: Reformatting a hard drive’s volume.
5.
Click Erase to reformat the volume.
When reformatting a hard drive, you can
choose from several options by clicking the
Security Options button. The options range
from Don’t Erase Data to 35-Pass Erase.
Choosing anything other than Don’t Erase
If you plan either an Upgrade or an Archive and
Install installation, do not reformat or partition
your hard drive because there will be nothing
to upgrade or archive. If you’re performing an
Erase and Install, the installer can handle basic
formatting (but not partitioning) for you.
1.
Start your computer with the first (or only)
Tiger installation disc.
2.
At the first screen that appears (for language
selection), choose Utilities➪Disk Utility (see
Figure 1-2).
3.
Follow the appropriate steps in one of the next
two sections to either format or partition your
drives and volumes.
• Figure 1-2: Open the Utilities menu to access Disk Utility.
Formatting a Volume
To format a volume with Disk Utility:
1.
Click the volume icon in the left column. 
A hard drive’s volumes appear under the hard
drive’s icon.
2.
Click the Erase button.
3.
Select a Volume Format.
The volume formats are:

Data exponentially increases how long it takes
to reformat the drive, but it’s the best way to
both clean the drive and ensure that it’s work-
ing properly. If you’re very security conscious
and/or a little paranoid, the 35-Pass Erase
option rewrites your disk 35 times, making the
data virtually impossible to recover. It also
takes hours or days to complete!
Partitioning a hard drive
To partition a hard drive into multiple volumes:
1.
Click the drive’s icon in the left column.
The drive will have a strange name consisting of
the size and model of the device.
2.
Click the Partition tab.
The Partition tab is an option only when you
select the entire hard drive.
3.
Select a scheme from the Volume Scheme drop-
down list (see Figure 1-4).
A volume’s scheme refers to how many parti-
tions you want to create. Hard drives 20GB or
larger can be nicely divided into two partitions.
• Figure 1-4: Opting for two partitions as the volume’s
scheme.
4.
One at a time, select every partition in the vol-
ume scheme window (named Primavera and
Data in Figure 1-4). 
Disk Utility automatically partitions a hard
drive into equally sized volumes. You can
override this by clicking and dragging the bar
that separates the volumes in the scheme win-
dow. Alternatively, you can specify a size for
each partition (in gigabytes) by using the Size
text box.
5.
Type a name in the Name text box and select a
format type in the Format drop-down list for
each partition.
6.
Click the Partition button to enact the changes.
Installing Tiger
The installation process is fairly obvious, particu-
larly after you understand the options, but we run
through the steps and highlight a few important con-
siderations nonetheless. To install Tiger:
1.
Update your computer’s firmware.
Apple always recommends that you do this, point-
ing you to www.apple.com/support/downloads.
When you’re there, click your computer model
under Updates by Product in the right column.
This takes you to a results page where you proba-
bly won’t find an update for your firmware. We’re
not suggesting that you skip this step, but don’t
be surprised if it’s less than fruitful.
2.
Insert the first Tiger disc into the disc drive
(make sure that you have all three CDs or a sin-
gle DVD), double-click the Install Mac OS X
icon, click Restart (see Figure 1-5), enter your
password if prompted, and then wait for your
Mac to reboot.

Technique 1: Installing Tiger without the Hassle
14
6.
On the Select a Destination page that appears,
select the destination drive for the installation
but don’t click Continue just yet (see Figure 1-6).
The installer presents a list of available volumes
where you can place Tiger. The installer even
marks the recommended destination with a green
arrow and unusable destinations with a red X.
• Figure 1-6: The destination determines where Tiger will
be installed.
If you have a decent-sized hard drive (20GB or
more), hopefully you partitioned it into two or
more separate volumes. If so, you can do a
clean install of an OS onto the second volume,
maintaining all your files and applications on
the original volume, just in case. See “Managing
Your Hard Drives” for more information on 
partitioning.
7.
Before you leave the Select a Destination page,
click Options at the bottom of the window.
8.
In the Options dialog that appears (see Figure
1-7), select the appropriate installation method
(see the earlier section “Choosing an Installation
Method”).
Your choices are
 Upgrade Mac OS X
 Archive and Install
 Erase and Install
• Figure 1-5: Restart your computer to begin installing Tiger.
You can also begin installing Tiger by holding
down the C key while your computer starts up
or selecting Mac OS X Install Disc 1 or Mac OS
X Install DVD in the Startup Disk preferences
panel (assuming the CD/DVD is in the CD/DVD
drive).
3.
Select the language that you want to use and
then click the arrow.
4.
Read through the introductory text on the first
two pages, and click Continue to go on.
5.
Accept the license agreement by clicking
Continue in the main window and then Agree
on the sheet that appears from the top of the
window.
You don’t have to accept the license 
agreement — unless you want to install Tiger,
that is. If you click Disagree, you exit the
installer and are returned to your normal
operating system world. One could argue,
therefore, that to save time, you just skip
reading the agreement (because you have to
agree with it regardless). We’d never be so
irresponsible as to suggest that you skip read-
ing the agreement, though. (Cough, cough.)

Installing Tiger
15
• Figure 1-7: The Options dialog is where you select your
installation type.
If you select the Archive and Install option,
you absolutely, positively want to select the
Preserve Users and Network Settings check
box; otherwise, you’ll need to recreate all your
files from the archive, which is an unnecessary
hassle.
If you select the Erase and Install option, you have
the choice of formatting with the options pre-
sented earlier in this chapter. You almost certainly
want to use Mac OS X Extended (Journaled), but
read the “Managing Your Hard Drives” section for
more information.
If you perform an Erase and Install of Tiger, all
your existing applications — along with your
files — are wiped out. If you don’t have all the
application discs and write down the serial
numbers somewhere, you also lose some soft-
ware in your transition.
9.
Click OK to close the Options dialog, and then
click Continue in the Select a Destination 
window.
10.
On the Easy Install page that appears, click the
Customize button at the bottom of the screen.
11.
In the Customize dialog that appears, deselect
all the features that you won’t use (see 
Figure 1-8).
• Figure 1-8: Customize your installation to fit your needs.
The most important timesaving consideration
when installing Tiger is to avoid installing fea-
tures that you’ll never need. This saves you time
now and hard drive space in perpetuity. The
options that you can choose to forgo include
 Printer Drivers: If you don’t have a printer,
you won’t need these at all, so deselect this
option and save a whopping 1.1GB of hard
drive space. If you do have a printer, choose
to install the drivers that correspond to the
make and model of your printer.
 Fonts: Although Apple’s been kind enough to
include the fonts, an informal poll of ours con-
cluded that most Tiger users don’t read much
text written in Inuktitut or Gujarati. If that accu-
rately describes you, drop all the fonts, along
with the standard Asian ones (Japanese,
Chinese, and Korean). You save yourself 130MB
of room (possibly for MP3s) in the process.

Technique 1: Installing Tiger without the Hassle
16
You can quit the installer any time up until
you click the Install button. After you do that,
get out a good book because you’ll have to
wait out the installation (easily 15 to 30 min-
utes, depending upon your computer and the
installation choices made).
13.
Wait patiently as the installation happens.
The installation process could easily take
upwards of an hour, so you may want to grab a
good book while you’re waiting.
The first step that the installer takes is to check
for problems on the installation disc. Then it
checks for problems on the destination volume.
You have the option of skipping this step (click
Skip in the lower-right corner), but you should
let the installer do its thing.
If the installation process stops because there’s
a problem with the integrity of your hard drive
(you see an obvious error indicating such), you
need to repair the hard drive before installing
Tiger. To do so, reboot your computer from the
Tiger installation disc, then choose Utilities➪
Disk Utility. The Repair option is under the First
Aid tab.
14.
When the installation finishes, your computer
automatically restarts. 
You can also click Restart at the prompt.
15.
If necessary, follow the on-screen instructions
to insert discs 2 and 3.
After your computer reboots — and is therefore
running off the new OS on your hard drive — the
installation process might continue if you’ve
elected to install some of the optional compo-
nents listed in Step 10. For example, if you’re
installing extra fonts and printer drivers, the
installer prompts you for disc 2; if you elected to
install X11, disc 3 is required. Obviously, if you’re
using the single DVD, you don’t need to insert
anything else.
 Language Translations: If everyone using the
computer primarily reads and writes English,
deselect the 1GB of language translations that
the OS will never use.
Depending upon what Apple decides to do in
later installers (we were using a beta version
when writing this), you might also be able to
install
 Additional Applications: The Additional
Applications include Internet Explorer, StuffIt
Expander, iTunes, iMovie, iPhoto, iCal, and
iSync. You’ll probably want all of these, but go
ahead and drop those you won’t use.
 Additional Speech Voices: The speech voices
require only 28MB of space, but that’s 28 more
megabytes than necessary if you never use
them. (You would use them if you have your
Mac speak text and other stuff to you and you
want a variety of speakers.)
 X11: This option is admittedly close to our
hearts and requires a meager 82MB of space.
Installing it opens up your Mac to a whole
world of free (free!) software and makes these
geeky authors proud. X11 provides a graphi-
cal user interface to UNIX applications, such
as The GIMP image manipulation tool, games,
various text-editing programs, and a wide
array of scientific tools. Although these UNIX
applications don’t look or act as nice as native
Mac OS X applications, the ability to run them
is still very valuable, and the price is right.
If you don’t install the BSD Subsystem, be
aware that you won’t be able to use many of
the more techie features of Tiger, including a
few that we list in this book. This includes
command line utilities and some Internet and
networking software.
12.
After you select what you want installed, click
Upgrade or Install to begin the actual installa-
tion process. 
The button you see depends upon the installa-
tion type you chose. You can also click Easy
Install to cancel the customization.

Working with Setup Assistant
17
You can also use the installer CDs for three
administrative purposes: changing the Startup
Disk, resetting a password, and accessing a
version of Disk Utility not running on the main
hard drive (see “Managing Your Hard Drives”).
Each of these is accessible through the Installer
menu.
Working with Setup Assistant
If you perform an Erase and Install installation of
Tiger or if you’re using your computer for the very
first time, you get the magic of the Setup Assistant
when your computer reboots. Like its Windows
counterpart, Setup Assistant asks you a series of
questions intended to make using the computer eas-
ier. Here are the highlights of the process so that you
can whip through it more quickly:
1.
Select your country.
2.
Answer the Do You Already Have a Mac? 
question.
This new feature makes it easier to transfer all
your existing information from your old Mac to
your new one. The three options are
 Yes, Transfer My Information from Another
Mac: This is useful only if you have another
Mac, they both have a FireWire connection,
and you have a FireWire cable. If you have all
three requirements, this is most assuredly the
way to go.
 Yes, Transfer My Information from Another
Partition on This Mac: If you performed a
clean installation of Tiger on another partition
or drive on the same computer, you can easily
move all your personal stuff over.
A very quick and reliable way to install Tiger is
to place the operating system on a separate
partition and then use the transfer feature to
copy over the data from the previous, existing
partition.
 No, Do Not Transfer My Information: Even if
you choose this option, you can move stuff
over manually later. See “Transferring Files
Flawlessly” at the end of this technique.
If you select either of the first two options, the
Setup Assistant then instructs you on what you
should do.
3.
Select your keyboard layout.
For this and for Step 1, the defaults will most
likely work. Apple is kind enough not to display
all the options, but you can get them by clicking
the check box at the bottom of the window.
4.
Decide what you want to do for an Apple ID.
You have three options:
 Enter your existing ID, if you have one.
 Create a new Apple ID.
 None of the above.
You already have an Apple ID if you’ve registered
for any of the special areas at www.apple.com or
if you have a .Mac account (which will be the
same as your Apple ID).
If you don’t already have an Apple ID or a .Mac
account, we strongly recommend creating one,
which will give you a 60-day trial .Mac account. If
you like the trial, you can pay for a permanent
account. We both have one and think it’s well
worth the $99 yearly price.
You can get a free trial .Mac membership
when you go through Setup Assistant. Because
we refer to some .Mac stuff throughout this
book, you really ought to consider signing up,
even temporarily.
5.
If you want, register.
Unlike Windows XP, which requires activation of
the operating system, you can forgo Tiger registra-
tion entirely. If you don’t feel like registering, press
Ô-Q to quit the registration application. The 
Setup Assistant then gives you the option to skip
registration entirely (and continue with setup
process), shut down the computer, or cancel.

Technique 1: Installing Tiger without the Hassle
18
 Phone number (for telephone dialup)
 Subnet mask, router address, DNS hosts, and
domain names (for DSL, cable modems, and
other networks)
Your Internet service provider should give you
detailed connection information to use during
the Internet setup process.
10.
Set up Mail.
Depending upon what choices you’ve made thus
far, you might also be able to set up your Mail
accounts at this time. Doing so is just a matter of
using the provided form. You can always do this
in the Mail application later, as well.
11.
Sync your Mac.
A few items can be synced across multiple Macs.
If this is something you’ve used before, you can
immediately sync your new Mac with this old
data by following the prompts.
12.
Select your time zone, confirm the current date
and time, and start using Tiger!
Transferring Files Flawlessly
In Technique 16, we discuss how to organize and
maintain your files and folders. Tiger comes with a
good implicit organization scheme that you really
ought to follow. If you do so, you can restore all your
documents, bookmarks, e-mail, and so forth merely
by copying the contents of your old Home directory
to your new user directory. Even if you use the pain-
less Archive and Install installation option, saving
the contents of the Users folder to an external
source before you begin installation (hard drive,
CD-ROM, DVD) is a prudent move.
While we’re at it, we recommend that you have at
least one reliable backup of all your data at all times.
If you’re installing a new version of the operating
system, you want two or more backups that use dif-
ferent media. (You can never be too careful.)
6.
Answer a few more questions and then check
out Apple’s Privacy Policy.
7.
Create your user account.
To create your account, enter your full name,
your short name (which the computer will treat
as your username), and a password. Ideally, your
short name should consist only of letters, num-
bers, and the underscore, and be eight charac-
ters in length or shorter.
You can skip the password and verify prompts
if you’d rather not have a password. This will
expedite many tasks but will also make your
computer far less secure.
8.
Select your Internet access type and then click
Continue.
You have three options:
 Set Up a Free Trial Account with EarthLink
 Use My Existing Internet Service
 I’m Not Ready to Connect to the Internet
9.
Follow the prompts to complete the Internet
setup.
As long as you didn’t select I’m Not Ready to
Connect to the Internet in Step 8, you’re led
through a connection setup wizard. If you’re
using an existing service, have your Internet
information written down and ready for when
you go through Setup Assistant. Getting the
information correct here will save you the hassle
of configuring your network later, although you
always have that option.
You need to know some combination of the 
following:
 Connection type (telephone modem, cable
modem, and so forth)
 Username
 Password

Transferring Files Flawlessly
19
The Backup application is provided free to
.Mac users. Version 2 of the application can
back up files to your iDisk, a CD or DVD, and
even external hard drives.
Be sure that your backups aren’t in a proprietary for-
mat (for example, the Retrospect Express cataloging
system; www.dantz.com) because you won’t be able
to get to the data until your computer can read that
format again.
We highly recommend making a CD-ROM of
installed applications that also contains a text
document with all your serial numbers. This
fairly simple step makes restoring the software
on your computer a snap!

Starting Up 
with Speed
A
s soon as you have Tiger running on your Mac, it’s time to make it
purr. In this technique, we cover ways to make your computer
usable as quickly as possible. These timesaving ideas focus on the
period from the time you press the power button to using the actual
applications.
We begin by pointing out the benefits of never shutting down your com-
puter, which helps you start faster and is a reasonable option for many
Tiger users. Then we show you how to best manage computers in a
multi-user environment and how to bring up your must-have applications
as soon as you log in to Tiger. This last little technique is a valuable time-
saver for pretty much any Mac user, so we then show you a more specific
example with the System Preferences panel.
Faster Startups: Never Shut Down
Although obvious, many people never think of this: The fastest way to
get your computer to start up is to never shut it down. Even on the
fastest machines, the startup process takes several minutes — minutes
that you don’t need to spend sitting idly. The UNIX operating system —
which is at the heart of Mac OS X — was designed to run 24 hours a day,
and your Mac is perfectly capable of this as well. Granted, keeping your
computer on all the time racks up the electrical bill a few cents per
month, but that minimal extra cost can be easily offset by your increased
productivity. Now, we’re not arguing that you should never shut your
computer down (like if you’re going on vacation), but here are some
viable alternatives to shutting down if you use your Mac a lot:

Put the computer to sleep overnight.

Whenever you need to, set the sleep mode (see Figure 2-1) by clicking
the Show Details button within the Sleep tab of the Energy Saver panel.

Technique

Scheduling Your Startups
21
• Figure 2-1: You can adjust your computer’s sleeping
habits in the Energy Saver panel.
You can access the Energy Saver panel by
choosing System Preferences from the Apple
menu and then clicking the Energy Saver icon
in the Hardware section. Figure 2-1 shows the
Energy Saver panel for a laptop, which has a
few more features than the same panel on a
desktop machine.

Turn off the monitor (desktop users only).

Close your laptop’s monitor to engage the sleep
mode (laptop users only).

Leave the computer active but engage the screen
saver.
If you aren’t going to use your computer for
days on end (like over a weekend or during a
long holiday), shut it down. But you don’t have
to shut down your computer every night,
especially if you use your computer off and on
all day.
Scheduling Your Startups
Tiger’s scheduling feature can save time in starting
your Mac. This is particularly useful in labs or offices,
where computers are used in regular intervals. Even if
you’re a home Mac user, if you know the Mac is never
used after midnight or before 8 a.m., you can sched-
ule its up time accordingly. This saves you starting or
stopping your computer yourself.
1.
Open the System Preferences panel (choose
Apple➪System Preferences).
2.
Click the Energy Saver icon, under Hardware.
3.
In the Energy Saver panel, click the Schedule
button.
The Schedule button is always available, whether
or not you have the other details displayed.
4.
In the resulting prompt (see Figure 2-2), select
the Start Up or Wake check box.
• Figure 2-2: Use the Schedule window to set when your
Mac should start, wake, sleep, or shut down.
5.
In the top-middle drop-down list, choose which
days to schedule your Mac to start.
You can specify an individual day (like if you use
your Mac only on Thursdays), weekends, week-
days, or every day.
6.
Set the time by using the box in the top-right
corner.
You can set the hour, minute, and AM/PM fastest
by clicking once on the digit in question and then
typing in the desired value. For example, in
Figure 2-2 you might click the 8 and type 6 — but
only if you’re an early bird.

Technique 2: Starting Up with Speed
22
Tiger includes many nice touches for using the com-
puter in a multi-user environment. Simplify and
speed up the login process like this:

If you’re the most frequent computer user, set
the computer to automatically log in under your
username by following these steps:
1. Open the System Preferences panel (choose
Apple➪System Preferences).
2. Click the Accounts icon, under System.
3. Click the Login Options button at the bottom
of the left column.
4. Select the Automatically Log In As check box.
5. Select your username from the drop-down list
(see Figure 2-4).
• Figure 2-4: Use the Login Options link in the Accounts
panel to secure and speed up access to your
computer.
6. Click the lock in the bottom-left corner to
make this setting permanent.
Any locked System Preferences panel needs to
be unlocked in order for changes to be made.
Unlocking a panel requires an administrator’s
password. If you are the only administrator of
7.
Select the check box next to Shut Down to set
either a shut down or sleep time.
8.
In the bottom first drop-down list, select either
Shut Down or Sleep.
You can schedule your Mac to either shut
down and start up or sleep and wake up. 
9.
Use the day of the week and time fields as you
did on the top row.
10.
Click OK to exit.
Don’t worry about your Mac shutting down when
you’re in the middle of finishing the Great American
Novel: 

Tiger prompts you well in advance of a regularly
scheduled shut down, as shown in Figure 2-3. 

Tiger can’t shut down if any open application has
an unsaved document. 
• Figure 2-3: Tiger prompts you before performing a
scheduled shut down.
Speeding Up the Login Process
If your computer has multiple users, you have to
deal with the same types of questions as with multi-
ple operating systems:

Should a user be automatically logged in?

If a user should be automatically logged in,
which user?

How do you quickly switch to another user?

Starting Applications Automatically
23
your Mac, using the lock on any System
Preferences page means that no one else can
change that setting.
If you log in automatically, anyone who has
physical access to your computer can now use
your computer without restraint. If your com-
puter stays at home and you trust your dog,
this might not be an issue; if security may be
an issue for you, though, do not use the auto-
matic login feature.

If you must use the login prompt, select the List
of Users radio button in the Login Options sec-
tion of the Accounts panel. You can skip typing
your username while still requiring a password: a
reasonable security compromise.
Security versus convenience
You might have to compromise security for greater con-
venience (or speed). In many of the examples of this book,
you need to decide whether you want something to be eas-
ier or more secure. Factors in making this decision include

Whether you share your Mac

What information is stored on your Mac

Who might have physical access to your computer

Whether your computer is likely to be stolen
For example, the most secure login method is to require
users to enter both a username and password to log in to
the computer, but this is really annoying if you’re the only
one who can access your Mac. In this case, automatically
logging in as yourself but password-protecting sensitive
files on your computer (such as a Quicken document) and
keeping regular backups of everything makes sense.
This book has many techniques for making things conven-
ient and many for making things secure. In the end, only
you can decide where your total Mac usage falls on that
scale.
Starting Applications
Automatically
After your computer is up and running and you’ve
logged in, you’re ready to use applications. Part IV
covers applications in detail, but we give you a
related technique here. From the Accounts panel,
you can set applications to launch automatically
when you log in to your computer. This saves you
from waiting while Mail, Safari, and whatever else
loads.
Your computer must expend some time and a
bit of power to start up applications. You
should add applications to your list of startup
items only if you always use them every time
you start the computer.
1.
Open the System Preferences panel (choose
Apple➪System Preferences).
2.
Click the Accounts icon, under System.
3.
Select your username from the list of users on
the left (if you have multiple users).
4.
If the panel is locked, unlock it to make
changes.
To unlock, click the lock icon in the lower-left
corner and enter the administrative password.
5.
Click the Login Items tab (see Figure 2-5).
At this stage, you have two options:
 Open your Applications folder, and then drag
and drop the application(s) into the Accounts
panel.
This first method is much, much faster than
the second.
 Click the plus sign under the list of Login
Items, navigate to the application by using the
Open sheet that appears, select the applica-
tion, and press Return.

Technique 2: Starting Up with Speed
24
Now your Mac plays that tune while it’s starting up. When
you’re sick of hearing “Good Day, Sunshine,” switch to
“Happiness is a Warm Gun” instead. 
This trick works with any kind of file. You can automatically
open a Word document at startup (that novel you’ve been
hacking away at) or an Xcode project.
While you’re messing around with System Preferences,
it’s a good time to make the autoloading applications
do their things. For example:

Set Mail to automatically check for new e-mail
every so many minutes. 
Use Mail’s General preferences panel (see Figure
2-6), accessed through Mail➪Preferences.
• Figure 2-6: Have Mail automatically fetch new messages
if you have an always-on Internet connection.

Set Safari to automatically open a specific URL
when it’s launched.
Use Safari’s General preferences panel (choose
Safari➪Preferences) to set a Home page and indi-
cate that all new windows should open with that.
• Figure 2-5: Larry’s list of must-be-running applications is
included in his list of startup items.
6.
After you finish, click the lock icon to finalize
the changes.
Speed up the startup process by disabling
automatic startup applications when you won’t
need them: Hold down Shift after logging in.
This trick works only if you’ve gone through
the login panel. (It doesn’t work with auto-
matic logins.)
Start the day with a song
Have your Mac greet you with a song. It won’t save you a
lick of time, but it might brighten up your day. Here’s how:
1.
Open the Login Items panel by using the previous
instructions.
2.
Switch over to iTunes.
3.
Find the song du jour in iTunes.
4.
Select File➪Show Song File or press Ô-R.
This highlights the actual song file as it exists on your
computer.
5.
Drag the song file into the Login Items panel.

Keeping the System Preferences Handy
25
Keeping the System 
Preferences Handy
Many of the techniques in this book involve going to
one of the System Preferences panels. And it’s not
uncommon to change some setting in some panel at
least once every day. For this reason, we make the
entire System Preferences application more readily
available with these steps:
1.
Add System Preferences to the list of automati-
cally opened applications (refer to Figure 2-5).
See the instructions in the preceding section for
specifics. The System Preferences application
itself is in your Applications folder. 
2.
If you want, select the Hide check box.
This step hides the System Preferences window
after it opens so that it doesn’t clutter your screen.
3.
To access a specific System Preferences pane,
Control-click the System Preferences Dock icon
(see Figure 2-7).
The Dock icon presents panes in alphabetical
order, which is easier to navigate. 
4.
Select the specific pane you want from the list
that appears.
• Figure 2-7: Control-click the System Preferences Dock
icon to bring up a contextual menu.

L
ike many of the other techniques in the first part of the book, steps
in this technique show you how to save time primarily by adjusting
system-wide settings. They’re of the “do it once and forget about it”
variety, except for the first list of steps, which is more of a “do it monthly
and you’ll be happier” kind.
First, we show you how routine maintenance can improve your Mac’s
performance. Much in the same vein, you then see some best practices
that help Tiger run most effectively. For laptop users, we give some atten-
tion to the related ideas of energy management and extending your bat-
tery’s life. Finally, we cover the best ways to improve your computer’s
performance by adding hardware. (As you might expect, throwing some
money at a sluggish computer can go a long way.)
Optimizing Your System through Maintenance
Your Mac is a complex machine with lots of software and moving parts
and doodads and cogs. Using your Mac inevitably adds extra clutter and
confusion to the machine, which slows it down. This sounds bad, but it’s
perfectly normal. We don’t advocate that you leave your computer off
(although, ironically, never turning on your Mac is the best way to keep it
running quickly), but we recommend some routine maintenance to
improve its performance.
We haven’t experienced any problems during optimization, but you’ll
be working on your system files and removing some cached data, so
you can never be too careful. One very good idea is running a thor-
ough backup before optimizing the system. (See Technique 49 about
that backup.) This way, should there be a problem, you won’t lose
your valuable data.

Technique

Optimizing Your System through Maintenance
27
We demonstrate the optimization steps by using the
Disk Utility application and the Finder, but you’ll
probably find it a lot easier to use a shareware appli-
cation, such as Cocktail (www.macosxcocktail.com,
$15), if you’re willing to spend the money. Cocktail
provides a simple interface for you to do most of
these tasks easily.
Mac OS X sets maintenance tasks to run when
you aren’t using the computer. Most of these
are scheduled to run during the middle of the
night or early morning. Often, these routines
are never executed because the computer is
off or asleep overnight. If you normally shut
down your machine overnight, shareware
tools such as Cocktail also address these main-
tenance needs.
We recommend periodically running the Disk Utility
application and clearing caches.
To run the Disk Utility, follow these steps: 
1.
Open the Disk Utility application.
Disk Utility can be found in the Applications➪
Utilities folder, as you might expect.
2.
Click your main hard drive’s name in the left
column (see Figure 3-1).
Click the name of the hard drive (Hard Drive,
Main, Tiger, or Macintosh HD), not the hard drive
icon above that (which is the size and model of
the hard drive).
If you have multiple hard drives or partitions,
click the name of the hard drive or partition
where Tiger runs.
3.
Click the Repair Disk Permissions button under
the First Aid tab.
4.
Read ahead a few pages of this book while Disk
Utility does its thing (see Figure 3-2).
The permissions repairs could take a while with
a large drive or slower Mac.
5.
After the repairs are complete, quit Disk Utility.
• Figure 3-1: Tiger’s hard drive is selected in the Disk
Utility application.
• Figure 3-2: The Disk Utility window shows the status of
the repairs.
Tiger stores caches in a Caches folder within a
Library folder (/Library/Caches). The /Library/
Caches folders are at the top of the main Tiger hard
drive or partition and in your Home directory.
Deleting your caches might temporarily slow down
some actions, such as loading common Web sites for

Technique 3: Running Tiger Faster
28
3.
Press Ô-A or choose Edit➪Select All to select
everything in the folder.
4.
Press Ô-Delete to send it all to the Trash (or
choose File➪Move To Trash).
5.
Enter your password at the prompt (see 
Figure 3-4).
• Figure 3-4: Deleting system files requires administrative
authentication.
6.
Press Ô-Shift-Delete to empty the Trash (or
choose Finder➪Empty Trash).
7.
If the Are you sure you want to remove the

appears, click OK or press Return.
When emptying the Trash, click the Continue
button if you see this error: The operation
cannot be completed because the item
someitem is in use. The next time you
log into your computer you can finish empty-
ing the Trash.
If running the Disk Utility and clearing caches (or
using something like Cocktail) don’t return your Mac
to full speed, you can take the more drastic step of
zapping your PRAM. The PRAM stores system set-
tings. Resetting this bit of memory can get rid of
some gremlins, although you have to re-establish
some settings afterwards. Here’s what you do:
1.
Restart your Mac while holding down Ô-Option-
P-R (yes, all at the same time).
the first time. But overall, deleting these files should
help your Mac do that thing it does. Use the follow-
ing steps to clear each /Library/Caches folder:
1.
Open a new Finder window if one isn’t already
open.
Part 2 shows oodles of ways to get to the
Finder, such as clicking the Finder icon in the
Dock, using Exposé, and pressing Ô-Tab. The
same goes for creating a new Finder window:
pressing Ô-N, choosing File➪New Finder
Window, and so on.
2.
Navigate to the /Library/Caches folder that
you want to clear. 
You can find the folder in one of two places:
 At the top of the main Tiger hard drive or 
partition.
The easiest way to get here is to click the
main Tiger hard drive icon in the Sidebar
(assuming it’s there), open the Library folder,
and then open the Caches folder within it. 
 In your own Home directory (/Users/
yourusername).
The easiest way to get here is to click your
Home directory icon in the Sidebar (a house
next to your username, assuming it’s there),
open the Library folder, and then open the
Caches folder within it (see Figure 3-3).
• Figure 3-3: Your computer’s cache contains miscellaneous
stored files that can be deleted.

Disabling Unnecessary Features
29
2.
Wait until you hear the special chime two or
three times.
3.
Release all the keys to let your Mac boot 
normally.
Speeding up specific applications
You can improve the performance of your favorite applica-
tions by giving processor priority to specific ones. The Speed
Freak utility from Big Fat Stinking Software (http://home.
comcast.net/~jeff.ulicny/software, donationware)
can do this for you. Tiger gives all applications (processes, in
technical terms) the same priority. Speed Freak lets you give
preferential treatment to particular applications (Safari or
Adobe Photoshop), so they run faster. Applications you care
less about will run more slowly, but sacrifices have to be
made.
Disabling Unnecessary Features
A tough balance exists between features and per-
formance. The more features you run, the more your
computer has to do. The more your computer has to
do, the slower it becomes. The trick is to balance
functionality and speed. Therefore you should adjust
your operating system and computer usage so that
your Mac doesn’t waste precious resources doing
unnecessary things.
You can enhance your speed with these common
techniques:

Remove CD-ROM discs and external hard drives
when you aren’t using them. Your Mac has to
keep track of all mounted disks (and discs), be
they CD-ROMS, DVDs, or external hard drives. 
 Tracking discs requires processor effort,
which could be better used elsewhere.
 Keeping an eye on large FireWire drives takes
a noticeable toll on your Mac. (Dismounting
and unplugging an external drive might cut
that electricity bill a bit, too.)

Turn off the iDisk synchronization. Tiger has
built-in support for iDisk, so your iDisk can be
available for access and in synchronization at all
times. This means that your computer is con-
stantly checking the status of your iDisk and
updating it. This is a drag in performance, net-
work speed, and hard drive space.
To disable automatic iDisk synchronization, do
the following:
1. Open the Internet & Network section of the
System Preferences panel.
2. Click the .Mac icon.
3. Click the iDisk tab. 
4. Check whether the tab says iDisk Syncing Off
(see Figure 3-5).
If iDisk synchronization is on, click the Stop
button to shut it off.
• Figure 3-5: Keep iDisk synchronization off for better
performance.
Having an iDisk is one of the benefits of paying
for a .Mac account (both of which we cover in
Technique 42). Simply put, the iDisk is 250MB
of online storage. (It used to be 100MB, but
Apple has increased the allotted space.) There’s
a little more to it than that — like a .Mac Web
page, a .Mac mailbox, an easy way to download
software, and a method for sharing documents
online — but that’s the gist of the idea.

Technique 3: Running Tiger Faster

applet to follow a Cubs game, instant messaging
your friends, and transferring files via FTP. For
some inexplicable reason, your computer is
incredibly sluggish. By making better decisions
(your friends can wait, so turn off iChat; wouldn’t
you rather listen to a CD anyway?), Tiger starts
purring again.
With Mac OS X, most open applications don’t
affect the overall performance when they
aren’t being used. You can save yourself time
without bringing the computer down by not
continually closing and reopening applications.

Turn off your AirPort Card when you aren’t
online. Using an AirPort Card requires some pro-
cessing and battery power. If you aren’t currently
online, turn off the AirPort Card. See Technique
38 for other wireless-network-related ideas.
Longer Battery Life
If you’re using a laptop, the life of your battery
directly affects how fast you can get things done. If
you don’t believe us, try doing anything on a dead
battery with no outlets in sight. To minimize or alto-
gether eradicate such occurrences, keep in mind the
following principles:

Calibrate the battery before using it. The man-
ual that came with your Mac (you read it, right?)
tells you how to do this. Do yourself a favor and
make sure you do.

Disable unnecessary features. See the preceding
section of this technique.

Avoid opening applications. Starting and stop-
ping applications drains the battery more than
running them. Open only the applications you
need and keep them open until you’re finished.

Close CPU-hogging applications. A few applica-
tions use a lot of CPU power even when they’re
in the background and they should be doing
nothing. For example, Microsoft Office applica-
tions can easily use 10 percent of your CPU when

Turn off the items in the Sharing panel if they
won’t be used regularly (see Figure 3-6). Tiger
supports several network-related services:
Personal Web Sharing, Personal File Sharing, and
Printer Sharing. Each of these requires an actively
running process. Most wait quietly in the back-
ground, but you don’t need to have them turned
on if you aren’t regularly using them. Click the
Sharing icon under the Internet & Network section
of System Preferences to access the panel and
check Technique 40 for the details (including the
related security issues).
• Figure 3-6: The Sharing panel provides easy access to
different services.
The good people at Apple were smart enough
to have all the Sharing items turned off by
default. If you change these settings, try to
remember that and turn them back off again
when the time is right. For example, if you’re
traveling (and therefore not on your normal
network), you don’t need to enable File or
Print sharing.

Don’t overburden your Internet connection.
Imagine simultaneously listening to online music
through iTunes, running ESPN’s GameCast Java

Longer Battery Life
31
you aren’t actively using them. Use the Activity
Monitor (see Technique 4) to find CPU hogs and
quit them when they’re unused for long periods
of time.

Minimize how often the computer accesses the
hard drive. Writing to and reading from any
drive is a big drain on a laptop’s battery. 
Most iLife applications suck the blood from your
battery. Avoid listening to iTunes, editing videos
in iMovie, or working with iPhoto unless you
really have to or don’t mind the shortened bat-
tery life.

Remove CDs and DVDs from the disc drive.
Your Mac must pay some attention to all
mounted drives. Removing them saves your Mac
from having to perform this chore.

Run the battery down monthly. This isn’t a
problem for most laptop users, but you should
use the battery quite a bit with some frequency,
letting the battery charge back up afterwards.
(Perpetually running your laptop plugged in kills
a battery.) Ideally, you should completely drain
and recharge your battery monthly.

Change your energy settings to Better Battery
Life. Head over to the Energy Saver panel (see
Figure 3-7) under System Preferences. One of the
default configurations is Better Battery Life
(assuming you have a laptop). This option auto-
matically configures your display, sleep, and
other settings accordingly to get the most out of
your battery.
• Figure 3-7: Laptop users should keep an eye on the Energy
Saver panel.
If you’re using a laptop, get in the habit of dis-
playing the battery status in the menu bar
while you aren’t plugged in and disabling it
otherwise. You’ll want to monitor it when
you’re using battery power, but it only clutters
up your screen if you’re not. To access this
area, open the Energy Saver panel, click the
Show Details button, then click the Options
tab, and then select the Show Battery Status in
the Menu Bar check box (see Figure 3-8).
• Figure 3-8: Tiger includes more energy management
options.

Keep the screen as dim as possible. A fair portion
of your battery’s power goes into illuminating the
monitor. To maximize your battery’s life, dim 
the monitor as much as you can. (Use the screen
brightness keys on the keyboard to do so.) If
you’re working in a particularly dark place or at
night, you can get away with dimming the monitor
almost entirely and still be able to read it.
If your laptop is running off the battery but
you want to keep it awake when you aren’t
actively using it (for example, if it’s processing
something or playing iTunes), dim the monitor
to the point of blackness. You save yourself
lots of power for later use.

Technique 3: Running Tiger Faster
32

Add more RAM ($40–$200). Adding RAM is far
and away the most foolproof method for improv-
ing your computer’s performance. RAM has
become cheaper and cheaper and is ridiculously
affordable these days. If you haven’t maxed out
your computer’s RAM capabilities, consider
doing so now.
We recommend at least 384MB of RAM in
your computer. You don’t necessarily need to
go up to 2GB, but 512MB is a nice, even num-
ber and befits most Tiger users.

Purchase a faster hard drive ($80–$300). Hard
drives spin at different speeds (measured in 
revolutions per minute, or rpms). The faster the
spin, the faster the drive. Most laptops use a
4,200 rpm drive by default, but 5,400 rpm drives
can be acquired for a few dollars more. Desktop
machines commonly use 7,200 rpm drives, but
these can be replaced with 10,000 rpm drives
without breaking the bank.

Purchase an external FireWire drive ($150–
$400). If you need more storage space but don’t
want to replace your existing hard drive, add an
external one. Such a device can be used only
when you need it and can be shared among many
computers. If you have a FireWire 800 connec-
tion, definitely spend the extra case for a match-
ing FireWire 800 drive (as opposed to the older
FireWire 400).

Install a better video card ($150–$400). People
who aren’t hard-core gamers often don’t value a
good video card and often don’t know how a
faster card improves the overall performance.
Everything that happens on-screen has to go
through this device, so the performance impact
is significant. Laptop users have little to no room
for improvement in this area, but desktop users
have many options. Consider buying a new card
with as much RAM as possible (64MB is fair) and
use that Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) slot if
you have it.

Don’t play DVDs or CD-ROM-based games.
Nothing drains a battery faster.

Turn off the illuminated keyboard. If you’re
lucky enough to have one of the new PowerBooks
with the backlight keyboards, you have another
energy-saving option. Go to the Keyboard tab of
the Keyboard & Mouse System Preferences panel
and deselect the Illuminate Keyboard in Low
Light Conditions check box. The backlight key-
board is a great feature, but when you need extra
juice, you can easily do without the light.
Improving Performance 
through Hardware
You can do a fair amount of tweaking by using the
built-in Tiger software and running shareware, but if
you really want to enhance your computer’s perform-
ance, you have to part with some cash. Here are
some hardware improvements that you can make
(from least to most expensive):
How to upgrade your hardware
If you don’t like to open a computer and mess around with
the insides, you have a couple options to get the job done:

Have it installed at the store where you purchase the
upgrades.

Go to an official Apple store.

Take your Mac to an authorized Apple dealer, such as
CompUSA.
Any of these places install the new hardware for a nominal
cost (maybe $30, depending on the item in question).
If you don’t mind a little tinkering — and are willing to
assume the risks involved — new RAM, hard drives and
video cards can often be installed by using only basic tools.
You’ll most likely find installation instructions with the 
purchased hardware or online. Search Google or the appro-
priate Apple manual (www.info.apple.com/support/
manuals.html) for specifics.

Improving Performance through Hardware
33
Make sure that the video card manufacturer
supports Tiger with the appropriate drivers. If
they don’t, either you won’t reap the perform-
ance benefits or the card might not work at
all. Check a manufacturer’s Web site for com-
patibility information before making the
investment!

Replace the motherboard (desktop users only,
$400–$900). This is a pricey step and comes
close to being impractical because motherboards
are often almost as expensive as a new computer.
But if you have a nice machine that you want to
work with, you can upgrade to a newer, faster
processor for a few hundred big ones.

Get that new Mac ($500–$3,000). It used to be
that as a Mac user, you knew that you would
spend more for your computers, get less in
return, and have fewer options than your
Windows friends, but those days are long gone.
Apple has had great success in developing sepa-
rate computer lines (professional and home)
with a decent range of prices and capabilities.
You can now pick up an impressive eMac for
under a grand and a low-end iBook for just over
that amount. Or, for the very budget-conscious,
the Mac mini starts at just $500.

Take out a second mortgage and get a new dual-
processor G5, with all the RAM that you can
cram into it and a new 23-inch studio display
($5,000). Buy each of us one while you’re at it.
If you’re looking through this book in a library
or bookstore, we highly recommend that you
purchase your own copy (or better yet, buy
several, and you’ll never need to read the
same copy twice). The small price is well worth
the timesaving techniques!

iger is a most excellent operating system — perhaps the best that
we’ve ever used. However, we still encounter the occasional prob-
lem or misguided application that mucks up the works. Fortunately,
OS X has protected memory: a stalled-out application no longer brings
down the whole machine. But stalled applications gum up the works and
leave your computer hanging. These techniques show you the best and
fastest ways to monitor and shut down problematic software. In an ideal
world, you’d never need to use these techniques, but in reality, following
these steps can keep your system going. As a last resort, you also see the
safest, most effective method for unsticking a stuck Tiger.
Slaying Stalled Apps with the Dock
Tiger lets you kill errant applications from the keyboard or the screen.
Always attempt to quit an application in the usual way before per-
forming a force-quit. Always give your quits and force-quits a few
moments to work before trying anything more drastic.
Before you cancel a slow app, make sure that you haven’t assigned
this application some monumental task (such as heavy image or video
processing) that explains its sluggishness.
From the keyboard, just press Ô-Option-Esc to bring up the Force Quit
Applications window (see Figure 4-1).

• Figure 4-1: The Force Quit Applications window allows
you to shut down applications.
You can also bring up the Force Quit
Applications menu by choosing Apple➪Force
Quit.
On-screen, you can use the Dock to kill stalled appli-
cations. Here’s how:
1.
If an application doesn’t respond, click and
hold its Dock icon to bring up a contextual
menu (see Figure 4-2).
• Figure 4-2: Clicking and holding a Dock item brings up a
contextual menu.
2.
If the Force Quit option isn’t already visible,
press Option while still clicking the Dock icon
to get it. 
The application’s contextual menu should now
be visible
3.
If the application’s contextual menu reads
Application Not Responding and you aren’t
doing something intensive with it, choose Force
Quit.
4.
Wait a couple minutes to let the system stabi-
lize; then reopen the application.
Gaining Better Performance
through Activity Monitoring
Tiger’s Activity Monitor is found in the Utilities
folder. This application does exactly what you’d
think: It monitors the activity of the computer. The
interface of the application is a bit techie, but it can
be a very useful tool for catching problems and fine-
tuning your computer’s performance. 
Activity Monitor can set up a floating CPU window
that allows you to continuously monitor your CPU’s
activity. You can use the CPU window to catch apps
that might be slowing down your system perform-
ance. Follow these steps to set up the window:
1.
Open the Activity Monitor, located in the
Utilities folder.
2.
Choose Window➪Show Floating CPU Window
and then choose either Vertically or
Horizontally (see Figure 4-3).
By default, the Activity Monitor doesn’t display a
floating CPU window. This step keeps the win-
dow visible even after you hide the Activity
Monitor application.
Instead of using the menu bar, you can also
create the floating CPU window by pressing
Ô-4 or Ô-5.

Technique 4: When Good Applications Go Bad
36
The Activity Monitor’s Dock icon can be used
to show CPU usage or history (see Figure 4-5),
network or memory usage, or hard drive activ-
ity. Select which one you want by choosing
View➪Dock Icon.
6.
Click the %CPU column heading so that CPU
usage is displayed by process in descending
order (see Figure 4-6).
If a process name appears in red in the process
list, the application is no longer responding and
needs to be shut down.
• Figure 4-6: Sort by the CPU usage to see what
applications are hogging the machine.
7.
Determine whether it’s reasonable to kill the
application.
If the application in question is performing some
intensive task (like iMovie compositing a video
clip or iPhoto importing pictures), the high CPU
usage makes sense. However, if you haven’t
asked the application to do something taxing or
it’s a normally less intensive application (like
Safari), you have a problem.
8.
If the application should be stopped, try quit-
ting it.
To quit the application, highlight it and click the
Quit Process icon (shaped like a stop sign) on
the toolbar, which attempts to kill the applica-
tion through normal means.
• Figure 4-3: Choose a type of floating CPU window to
display: Horizontal or Vertical.
3.
While you have the Activity Monitor open,
adjust the update frequency by choosing
View➪Update Frequency➪Less Often.
Setting the Activity Monitor to update less
often minimizes the performance effect that
running the monitor has on your computer.
4.
If the floating CPU window (see Figure 4-4)
turns to solid green or solid green and red for
more than a few seconds, a program is using up
all the available processing power (which slows
down everything else).
• Figure 4-4: The Activity Monitor creates a bar graph
indicating CPU usage.
5.
Click the Activity Monitor icon in the Dock and
press Ô-1 to bring up the Activity Monitor
screen (if it isn’t already up).
The Activity Monitor icon can look like the moni-
tor image next to the Dock’s Finder icon in Figure
4-4, or it can be a graph itself (see Figure 4-5).
• Figure 4-5: The Activity Monitor can also be represented
by a history graph of CPU usage.

quit by using one of the methods outlined in
“Slaying Stalled Apps with the Dock,” earlier in
this technique.
If you have some time to kill or just really want
to know what your computer is doing and why,
the Activity Monitor is the perfect tool to spend
some time with. You can also use it to extend
your laptop battery’s life by quitting applica-
tions that use too much CPU power.
Understanding processes
In the UNIX world, a process is an active (running) applica-
tion, a daemon (a special type of constantly running utility),
or another type of service. (In fact, the UNIX operating sys-
tem blurs the lines between these ideas.) Tiger uses the
same notion of processes, so it introduces an idea that
might be foreign to you if you have no UNIX experience
(which is most of the world’s population). The Activity
Monitor displays not only your open applications but also
behind-the-scenes system processes.
To find out more about any particular process, click the
Process ID in the Activity Monitor and then press Ô-I. This
brings up another window with details for that particular
application, as shown in the following figure. When you’re
done with your investigation, click the red button in the
upper-left corner to close the window. Don’t click Quit — it
tries to shut down the process.
Another tool for monitoring your performance is
iPulse, which is a shareware application created by
the good people at the Iconfactory ($12.95 at http://
iconfactory.com/ip_home.asp). iPulse tracks the
CPU, memory, and hard drive usage and displays
them graphically on the Desktop or Dock. It even
monitors the temperature of your motherboard.
If you want a free solution that monitors only CPU
usage, check out Xload (http://s.sudre.free.fr/
Software/Xload.html). If you are using a multi-
processor Mac, it even reports on each processor
individually.
Crashing Your Mac
Very, very rarely, your beloved Mac might come to a
grinding halt, seemingly frozen and incapable of
doing anything. Unlike those poor Windows souls,
such an occurrence should be at most an annual
event. If you find your Mac dead to the world, these
practices can solve the problem:
Periodic backups and other maintenance can
help your computer run more smoothly and
minimize the potential loss in case a crash
occurs.
To prevent and smoothly recover from crashes:
1.
Give it some time.
Don’t rush your Mac or yourself. If your Mac
seems to be hanging, give the operating system a
few minutes to recover on its own.
2.
Try to find and kill the offending application.
Sometimes the problem is in one application,
which can be terminated. If the offending appli-
cation is the Finder, you might need to shut
down or reboot.
3.
Quit every other application before rebooting.
If, for example, the Finder is the problem, you
should still be able to switch to and quit (like
normal) every other application. Doing so mini-
mizes problems and lost documents in those
applications.

Technique 4: When Good Applications Go Bad
38
Keep journaling enabled on your hard drive to
limit the damage from a crash. Journaling
helps your Mac recover from sudden crashes.
This option can be enabled during installation
(see Technique 1) or from the Disk Utility.
4.
When all else fails, press and hold the power
button to shut down.
5.
Give it some time.
Wait a few minutes for both your Mac and your-
self to cool down before booting up again.

Logging Out and
Shutting Down
W
hen the time comes to call it a night, you want to get off your
Mac and on the road (or couch) as quickly as possible. In this
technique, we show you a few inside tips for speeding up that
process, covering the range of options: You can choose to log out of your
computer, switch over to another user’s account, or shut down the com-
puter. Don’t forget, of course, that you can also save time by just putting
your Mac to sleep or by scheduling it to start and stop when you like
(see Technique 2).
Logging Out
Before we cover logging out techniques, we need to make clear that log-
ging out of your computer is necessary under only two conditions:

The Mac is used by more than one person.

You want to make sure that no one messes with the computer while
you’re away from it.
If neither describes your situation or how your Macintosh is used, stick
with your one login account and continue on your merry way.
If you share the computer and want to log out with ease, try any of the
following:

Go to the Apple menu and choose Log Out User (where User is your
username; see Figure 5-1).

If you’ve enabled Fast User Switching (see the next section of this
chapter to find out how), go to the user menu in the upper-right cor-
ner of the screen and choose Login Window (see Figure 5-2).
Fast User Switching is a must-use Tiger feature for multi-user 
computers.

Press Ô-Shift-Q to quit all applications and log out.
You get a warning message, as shown in Figure 5-3. Just press Return
to log out or Esc to cancel.
Technique
Save Time By
 Logging out in different
ways
 Switching between users
quickly
 Shutting down fast

Technique 5: Logging Out and Shutting Down
40
To cut a step out of the log out process, hold
down the Option key when choosing Log Out
from the Apple menu or while pressing the
keyboard shortcut (Ô-Shift-Q). This eliminates
Apple’s warning.
Every method of logging out has these two results:

The system automatically attempts to log you
out after two minutes if you don’t click either the
Log Out or Cancel button (see Figure 5-3).

The main login screen appears after logging 
you out.
If you want to temporarily log out of your
machine with the intention of returning to
your work, enable Fast User Switching and log
out from the user menu. 
Unless you’re using the Fast User Switching method
of logging out, remember these two facts:

Each logout method closes any open applications.

If you have an unsaved document in any applica-
tion, you can’t log out until you opt to either
Save or Don’t Save that file.
Neither of these options applies to Fast User
Switching because the state of your account remains
the same (meaning that all open applications and
documents remain open).
Adding user icons
Each user on a Mac running Tiger can have his or her own
icon. This icon appears next to the username in the System
Preferences➪Accounts panel, in the main login screen, and
in the Fast User Switching menu. Besides being a nice rep-
resentation of you and your personality, user icons make
finding your login name in a list of names easy. You can
change your icon by using the Picture tab after selecting
your account in the System Preferences➪Accounts panel
(as in this image).
• Figure 5-1: The Apple menu gives the option of 
logging out.
• Figure 5-2: The Login Window option makes it so that a
password will be required to re-access your
stuff.
• Figure 5-3: Logging out the standard way causes this
annoying prompt.

Securing Your System with a Screen Saver
41
From there you have four options:

Click one of the default Apple icons in the rightmost
column.

Click the Edit button and drag an image into the win-
dow from the Finder (see the figure).

Click the Edit button and take a picture of yourself by
using an attached camera.
If you have a FireWire video camera (including iSight)
connected to your Mac, your image appears in the
Edit window, and you can click the Take Video
Snapshot button to make a literal iconic representation
of yourself.

Click the Edit button and then click the Choose button
to find the image on your Mac.
If you click the Choose button in the Edit window, you
get a dialog (like the Open/Save ones) so that you
may navigate to and select an image on your hard
drive.
The user icon you select also is updated in your Address
Book and in iChat. If you like switching icons often, both
iChat and the Edit window from the Accounts panel
remember your most often used images.
Securing Your System 
with a Screen Saver
If what you really want to accomplish by logging out
is to protect your computer while you’re away from
your desk, here’s a simple step: Use your screen
saver and set it to require a password to deactivate.
1.
Open System Preferences by choosing Apple➪
System Preferences.
2.
Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon under
the Personal heading.
3.
If the panel appears in the Desktop mode, click
the Screen Saver tab (see Figure 5-4).
4.
Make sure that the screen saver is set to start
after a certain length of time.
For more security, set a hot corner that starts
the screen saver. This way, you can immedi-
ately enact the screen saver before you leave
your desk. Otherwise, you’re trusting that no
one gets to your machine between the time
you leave and when the screen saver turns on.

Technique 5: Logging Out and Shutting Down
42
• Figure 5-5: You can password-protect your computer
through the Security panel.
Fast User Switching
The main benefit of Fast User Switching is that a
user can log out without quitting every application.
In other words, it maintains everything exactly as
you have it but doesn’t let anyone back in without
entering your password first.
To enable Fast User Switching, do the following:
1.
Open System Preferences.
2.
Click the Accounts icon under the System head-
ing (see Figure 5-6).
3.
In the Accounts panel (see Figure 5-7), click the
Login Options button at the bottom of the left
column.
The Login Option panel appears.
4.
In the Login Options panel, check the Enable
Fast User Switching option (see Figure 5-8).
• Figure 5-4: The Screen Saver preferences panel.
Hot, hot, hot corners
Your Mac has a feature called hot corners. You can assign
special meaning to the different corners of your screen. So,
for example, moving the mouse into the upper-left corner
might turn on your screen saver, and moving the mouse
into the lower-left corner might engage Exposé. Moving
the mouse back out of a corner reverts the screen to its pre-
vious state (turns off the screen saver or Exposé, in these
examples).
You enable and assign hot corners by using either the Hot
Corners button in the Screen Savers panel (see Figure 5-4)
or by using the Active Screen Corners section of the Exposé
tab (see Technique 15).
5.
Choose View➪Security.
6.
In the Security panel (see Figure 5-5), select the
Require password to wake this computer
from sleep or screen saver check box.
While in the Security panel, you can also set
your computer to log out after so many min-
utes of inactivity. You might find this option to
be great (because it’s more secure) or a pain
(as you’re consistently logging back in).

Fast User Switching
43
Follow these steps to switch to another account 
(or switch back) with Fast User Switching:
1.
Choose the account from the Fast User
Switching menu in the upper-right corner of
your screen (refer to Figure 5-2).
• Figure 5-6: Configure Fast User Switching from the
Accounts panel.
• Figure 5-7: The Accounts panel manages a computer’s
users.
2.
Enter the user account’s password and click
Log In (see Figure 5-9).
3.
To switch back to a previous account, follow
Steps 1 and 2.
• Figure 5-8: Multi-user Macs should enable Fast User
Switching.
• Figure 5-9: Enter the proper password to log in as
another user.

Technique 5: Logging Out and Shutting Down
44

The old-fashioned method is to choose Shut
Down from the Apple menu (refer to 
Figure 5-1).

You can shut down your computer by pressing
the power button on your Mac or keyboard.
This brings up a prompt of options (see Figure
5-11). At this prompt, press Return to shut down
your computer, Esc to cancel, S to sleep, and R to
restart, or click the appropriate button with your
mouse.
• Figure 5-11: Use this prompt to specify what action your
Mac should take.
From the Energy Saver panel (in System
Preferences), you can set your computer to
automatically shut down at set times. This is
great for lab environments or if you tend to
forget to shut down your computer at the end
of the day. Technique 2 covers scheduling
your Mac.

Hold down the Option key while you choose
Apple➪Shut Down. Holding down the Option
key causes your computer to shut down immedi-
ately without any other prompts.
The Option key trick for suppressing the con-
firmation prompt also works for restarting the
computer, putting it to sleep, or logging out.
You can add features and minimize the menu
bar requirements of Fast User Switching (see
Figure 5-10) by installing WinSwitch (www.
wincent.com, donationware).
• Figure 5-10: WinSwitch creates a smaller Fast User
Switching menu bar icon and adds other
options.
If users share a Mac, the Fast User Switching
feature allows them to switch between
accounts (having different preferences, docu-
ments, and Home folders) without losing their
place or re-establishing the work environment
upon return.
Making the Quick Exit
After you finish for the night (or morning or after-
noon) and it’s time to close up for the day, you prob-
ably want to shut down your computer. Every Mac
user knows how to do this, but not every Mac user
knows how to do it as quickly as possible.

Goodbye Microsoft,
Hello Mac!
S
o you’ve made the decision to give up that annoying Windows oper-
ating system and start using Macs. Maybe this is because you’ve
seen how great iTunes and the iPod are. Maybe it’s because that
Mac Mini is priced right. Maybe you’re making the switch out of spite for
Microsoft (because you can’t keep rewarding such shoddy workman-
ship). In any case, you’ve made the right decision. But, you might ask,
“What do I need to know about using Macs?”
In this technique, we give you a nice little introduction to your Mac from
a Windows-user perspective. For starters, you find out who stole the Alt
key, what that key is next to the space bar, why your Mac has only one
mouse button (perhaps), and other basic stuff. Then you get an introduc-
tion to System Preferences, which is your new control panel. After that,
we let you know how to get help. Finally, a short list of useful Mac-related
resources is provided.
One of the most important things to understand from the get-go is
that your Windows software doesn’t run on your Mac. So don’t try
installing Office for Windows. But many Windows applications are
also available in Mac versions (which you might be able to purchase
at an upgrade price). More importantly, your documents should
transfer with little or no problem. A Word document for Windows will
open in Word for Mac. It will also open in iWork’s Pages application!
Where Is the Alt Key? Mac Basics
The Mac setup — from the keyboard to the mouse to the main screen —
is just foreign enough to confuse a lifelong Windows user. The first thing
to realize is that the Mac setup is a lot simpler than it looks, and it’s defi-
nitely easier to work with than Windows. In this initial section, we famil-
iarize you with some of the basics.

• Figure 6-1: Control-click to create a right-click on the
Desktop or on a file.
Here are a couple tricks to help ease the transition:

Pull out the cheat sheet from the front of this
book to be able to quickly reference the most
important keyboard commands.

Use the menus at the top of the screen while
you’re getting the hang of things. Nearly all the
keyboard shortcuts refer to a menu option (for
example, Ô-C for Copy is the same as going to
the Edit menu and choosing Copy). So while
you’re learning the ropes, feel free to use your
mouse with these menus. Speaking of the mouse,
check out the following section.

If you miss the Alt key, pry it off your old key-
board and wear it as a key chain. We hear this
is all the rage with the kids these days.
Your new keyboard
A keyboard is a keyboard, right? Well, for the most
part. If you’re a handy keyboard user on a Windows
machine, you probably got used to using the Ctrl
and Alt keys as shortcuts (for closing or opening
things, quitting applications, whatever). As you’ll
quickly pick up, those keys don’t exist on the Mac
keyboard. Instead you have Control, Option, and Ô
(the Command key, which is also the historical Open
Apple key). We reference these keys hundreds of
times throughout the book, but here are some quick
facts about the most important keys:

The Ô key is the most important key. The vast
majority of shortcuts use the Ô key. Everything
from opening and closing windows to getting
information (think “properties”) about a file uses
this key.

The Ô key is the Alt key, more or less. For
example, on Windows you would use Alt-F4 to
close an application; on your Mac, you use Ô-Q
(for Quit). 

The Ô key is somewhat like your old Ctrl key.
Did we mention that the Ô key is the most
important? Well, it is.

Hold down the Control key while using the
only (or the left) mouse button to create the
equivalent of a right-click (see Figure 6-1).

The Option key is a modifier. Using the Option
key with other shortcuts (like Ô-W to close a
window) modifies that behavior (so Ô-Option-W
closes all windows).

The Shift key is also sometimes a modifier.

The Return key (the Enter key’s better-looking
sibling) doesn’t always do what you’d think it
does. Specifically, in the Finder (the main inter-
face you have — think of it like your Windows
Desktop), the Return key doesn’t open a file or
application but rather lets you rename it. This is
odd, yes, but that’s the way it is. Otherwise, the
Return key is pretty much your old friend the
Enter key.

How to use a one-buttoned mouse
One of the hardest ideas for new Mac users to grasp
is the single-button mouse. Macs ship with these by
default, but dozens of multi-buttoned mice — and
you’ll probably want to get one eventually — are
available. If you have an Apple laptop, you have a
trackpad that comes with but a single button.
Whatever Mac you use, you have only one mouse
button because you really need only one. That’s all
there is to it. But we should also point out

If you’d like to open something, just double-click
it by — yes! — clicking it twice in succession.

You can adjust a mouse’s behavior within the
Keyboard & Mouse System Preferences panel.
You find out more about System Preferences
later in this technique.

You can achieve a Windows right-click by hold-
ing down the Control key while clicking. This
creates what Mac users call a contextual menu
(CM), and they are just awesome. Beyond offer-
ing the standard stuff (like the Windows right-
click), the CM can be modified in many different
ways to make them more useful. See Technique
14 for more on the wonder of contextual menus.

Multi-buttoned mice are often programmable
(see Figure 6-2). If you buy a different mouse
down the road, it will most likely come with soft-
ware to adjust the behavior of the buttons.
Working with the Finder, your new Desktop
The most important application on your Mac is the
Finder (see Figure 6-3), which is the Mac equivalent of
the Windows Desktop. It will often be how you access
your files, applications, and so on. Part II of this book
is largely dedicated to the Finder. Compared to your
Windows interface, what you find is that

A Mac has no Start menu. Instead, you open
applications from the Dock (see Technique 13);
from the Applications directory; or by using
Favorites (see Technique 17). The Apple menu in
the upper-left corner also adds Start Menu–like
functionality.

Icons normally line up on the right side of the
screen instead of the left.
• Figure 6-2: The software for programming a multi-
buttoned mouse.
• Figure 6-3: The Finder: your home away from home.

Technique 6: Goodbye Microsoft, Hello Mac!
48
As you can see in Figure 6-5, the System Preferences
interface is organized by categories (Personal,
Hardware, and so on). Within each category is a list
of what panels are available (such as .Mac, Network,
QuickTime, Sharing). Each panel lets you adjust your
Mac’s behavior and features for that specific techno-
logical area. To access a panel, click just once on
that icon. Some other useful information:
• Figure 6-5: The main interface to System Preferences.

You can use the View menu to quickly access a
panel without using the main interface.
The View menu is the fastest way to switch
from one System Preferences panel to another.
It’s organized alphabetically.

If a System Preferences panel is locked (Figure
6-6 shows a locked option), you need to unlock
it if you want to make changes.
Locking preferences panels is a great way to
make sure that changes aren’t made without the
proper authority. To unlock a panel,
1. Click the lock.
2. Enter your administrative password at the
prompt.

You probably have hard drive icons instead of
My Computer.

You can access CDs and DVDs more directly. By
default, mounted discs appear on the Desktop,
so you no longer have to look inside My
Computer to access the CD you just inserted.

The Trash (in the Dock) works like the Recycle
Bin. And, just out of curiosity, are you really
recycling that stuff on Windows? We think not.
It’s a Trash bin. Period.
Now that you have a little introduction to the inter-
face, you can move on to other important concepts.
Setting System Preferences
System Preferences is an important tool and one we
reference frequently in this book. It controls how
your Mac behaves and how you interface with it. It’s
very much like the Control Panel in Windows. To
open it, choose System Preferences from the Apple
menu (see Figure 6-4).
• Figure 6-4: Use the Apple menu to get to System
Preferences.

3. Click OK.
To relock a panel, click the open lock icon.

unauthorized changes.

Some utilities install extra System Preferences
panels.
You can find these listed at the bottom of the
main window, under Other (refer to Figure 6-5).

You can search the System Preferences panel.
This feature is new in Tiger and very useful for
Windows folks. For example, if you know you
need to do a printing activity, try this:
1. Open System Preferences.
2. Type print in the Search box in the top-right
corner.
As you type, a list of logical categories
appears underneath the Search box. Related
System Preferences panels are highlighted.
3. Use the arrow keys to select a specific topic
(see Figure 6-7).
The corresponding System Preferences panel
for the selected topic is highlighted more
prominently.
• Figure 6-7: Search the System Preferences panel to
quickly find the pane you need.
4. Click a topic to pursue that activity.
After you click it, the proper System
Preferences panel flashes and then opens.
5. Click the X in the Search box to close the
search.

Some panels have multiple subsections.
If a panel has subsections, they are available as
a series of tabs. Click a tab heading in order to
switch to a different tab within the same panel.

The tips and steps in this technique are just the tip
of the proverbial iceberg when it comes to transi-
tioning to the Mac. Oodles of resources are available
to assist you. Of those, the most useful are

Apple’s Switch site (www.apple.com/switch):
Apple discusses how you can best make the
switch and provides links to more resources
through this section of the Apple site. For 
some basic information, check out the Top 10

Apple’s Support site (www.apple.com/support):
In particular, consider using the Discussions sec-
tion, where other people post questions and
answers about various topics. If you click the
Advanced Search link on the main Support page,
you can search the Knowledge Base, Apple’s
library of useful articles.
To find out how to use the Knowledge Base
more effectively, check out this article: http://

Move2Mac (www.apple.com/switch/howto/
move2mac, $50): This application, available
through Apple’s online and brick-and-mortar
stores, automates the transition from Windows
to Macintosh. The software runs on both
Windows and the Mac OS and takes all your 
documents from your old PC and puts them into
the right location on your new Mac.
Many of the applications that come on your Mac, as
well as those you install, also have their own help
pages, which you can access through their Help
menus. As an example of using the Help menu, open
up the glossary page:
1.
Switch to the Finder if it’s not currently the
active application.

Making Your Mac
More Accessible
N
ot everyone who uses a computer has 20/20 vision or tireless
wrists. Moreover, computers can be quite hard on the human
body, making the need for special assistance even greater. Tiger
comes with many ways to customize how you and your Mac interact,
allowing for different or just easier interactions. As you look into this
technique, you find that these features are quite useful for all Mac users,
not just those with special needs.
You can adjust your Mac’s behavior in four primary areas: 

Setting Tiger to provide audible clues

Using your own speech to control your Mac

Changing the display appearance

Altering the keyboard and mouse settings
In this technique, we cover each of these in detail, primarily focusing on
the sections of System Preferences that you’ll want to use. (In case you
do not already know, you can access System Preferences through the
Apple menu.)
When searching for more information online regarding your Mac and
this subject, use the keywords Mac and assistive technology. You can
also use Mac and accessibility. Within the Mac’s Help files, the word
accessibility brings up a number of articles, many of which we cover
within this technique.
Listening to Your Mac
For users with limited vision, the Mac has several strategies for relaying
information in non-visual ways. The main feature, called VoiceOver, is
enabled within the Universal Access panel (see Figure 7-1). VoiceOver, in
short, provides an audible narration for what’s happening on your Mac.
This narration ranges from the basic, such as reading alerts and notifying
you of what window is open, to the thorough, such as reading entire sec-
tions of text.

You can also set VoiceOver to do other neat
tricks, such as speaking
 The text that the mouse cursor is currently
over
 When the mouse enters a window
 When a modifier key (Shift, Control, Option) is
pressed
 When the Caps Lock key is engaged (so that
you know you’re typing in all capital letters)
• Figure 7-2: Control how active the VoiceOver is by using
the Verbosity tab.
3.
Click the Navigation tab and adjust the settings
there.
The Navigation aspect of VoiceOver helps you
with just that: getting around. There’s a top sec-
tion dedicated to Web pages, followed by one
section for tracking cursor movement and
another related to text.
4.
Click the Voices tab and modify the Mac’s voice
(see Figure 7-3).
To turn on VoiceOver, click the On button or press
Ô-F5. (This keyboard shortcut works no matter what
application you’re in.) You should immediately hear
“Welcome to Macintosh” or another greeting. After
you enable VoiceOver, you probably want to tweak
how it behaves:
• Figure 7-1: The Universal Access pane is visually easier to
work with than other panes.
1.
Click the Open VoiceOver Utility button.
2.
Click the Verbosity tab and adjust the settings
there (see Figure 7-2).
You use the Verbosity tab to determine how
much your computer speaks to you. For starters,
you can adjust how VoiceOver handles
 Punctuation (which standard users might not
need to hear but technical writers would)
 Alterations of text (for example, when text has
italic or bold formatting)
 Text that you type

tions (content, attributes, status, whatever).
The Voices tab is one of the most important
for successfully using VoiceOver. Use a voice
that you like and at a rate that makes sense
for how quickly you do things on your Mac.
5.
Click the Display tab and turn on the Caption
Panel.
The Caption Panel displays, at the bottom of the
screen, the essence of what VoiceOver is also
saying. You can modify its size and transparency
to improve its visibility.
6.
Finally, click the Pronunciation tab and adjust
how VoiceOver pronounces abbreviations.
You can see some examples listed there, and
hear them by clicking them. You can add and
subtract pronunciations as needed, and edit the
pronunciation of an item by double-clicking it.
This feature is particularly good for people in
fields with a specialized vocabulary.
Editing or creating the pronunciation of some-
thing isn’t as difficult as you would think. You
can start by checking out the included pro-
nunciation definitions. After that, type letters
and words that you think are appropriate, and
then use spaces and hyphens to create pauses
and break up syllables. When creating your
pronunciation, use the Play button to hear the
result and then modify the pronunciation until
it’s just right.
A second way to have your computer vocalize infor-
mation for you is by using the Text to Speech fea-
ture. Found within the Speech pane (see Figure 7-4),
Text to Speech simply speaks particular things. You
can turn it on for

 Links to the Speech panel and a window of
speakable commands (click the down arrow
to access these).
You can click and drag this bubble around to
position it where it’s most convenient. It will
always remain on top of every other window.
• Figure 7-5: This round little guy shows that Speech
Recognition is on.
3.
Read the prompt on how to most effectively use
Spoken Commands, and then click Continue to
close the prompt.
The prompt provides very important informa-
tion. As you see,
 You need to hold down Escape when speaking
a command so that your Mac hears you.
 You have to use specific commands, listed in
the Commands area.
 You should speak loudly enough that you con-
sistently hit the green levels in the micro-
phone window (see Figure 7-5).
4.
Select a sound or voice for command acknowl-
edgement.
Tiger lets you know whether it understood a
command. By default, it does this by playing a
sound, but you can set it to repeat the command
back to you by selecting the Speak Command
Acknowledgement check box.
In the Date & Time section of System
Preferences, you can set your Mac to
announce the time at regular intervals, using a
favorite voice.
If you use Text to Speech, make sure to choose a
voice and a speaking rate that’s most effective for
you. A Play button is available so that you can test
the various settings.
Talking Back to Your Computer
Assuming that your Mac has a microphone (most
laptops have them built in), not only can your Mac
talk to you, but you can talk right back. Speech-
recognition software lets you control your Mac —
make it do things — by saying the proper commands.
Your Mac is able to perform certain actions,
such as saving a document or quitting an
application, by using the software built into
Tiger. If you want to be able to dictate e-mails
or text files, you need third-party software like
iListen (www.macspeech.com, $150 and up).
To work with your computer by using your voice,
you need to enable some of Tiger’s speech recogni-
tion features. Repeat after us. . . .
1.
From the System Preferences panel, open the
Speech pane.
2.
Click the radio button to turn on Speakable
Items.
After you enable Speakable Items, you see a
round window appear (see Figure 7-5). This 
window
 Shows what key needs to be pressed so that
your Mac listens to you speaking. (The key is
Escape by default, which you don’t see in the
figure because the key is already being
pressed.)
 Shows the sound input levels when you’re
speaking.

Using Visual Clues
57
To test the Speech Recognition software, hold
down Escape and say “Tell me a joke.” Note
that we aren’t suggesting you’ll hear a good
joke!
5.
Click the Commands tab.
6.
Select and deselect the command groupings as
necessary (see Figure 7-6).
Here you decide what types of commands Tiger
should listen for. Click any item to see a descrip-
tion and then select or deselect the check box as
appropriate.
• Figure 7-6: Check out what types of commands you can
speak, and limit them if you need to.
If you type speakable in the Mac Help Search
box (see Technique 6) and press Return, you
find some instructions for creating your own
new speakable commands.
7.
Click the Open Speakable Items Folder to see a
list of speakable commands.
In order for Speakable Commands to work, you
have to know what commands are available.
These are listed, by application, within the
/Library/Speech/Speakable Items folder.
You can also see some, but not all, of the avail-
able commands by selecting Open Speech
Commands Window from the Speakable
Commands floating window (see Figure 7-5).
This resulting Speech Commands Window
also shows the most recently spoken com-
mands, and marks those commands you
spoke that it didn’t comprehend as question
marks.
Using Visual Clues
The Universal Access pane has a few other settings
that are useful for people with limited vision. These
include

Zooming in on sections of the screen

Displaying white text on a black background (as
opposed to black on white)

Using grayscale colors

Adjusting the contrast

Having your Mac flash when alerts sound (under
the Hearing pane)
The last four options are easy to enable and use,
requiring very little thought or customization. The
zoom feature merits further discussion because it
has its own keyboard shortcuts and customization
options:
1.
Open the Universal Access pane.
2.
Turn Zoom on.
3.
Memorize the keyboard shortcuts.
To zoom in, press Ô-Option- = (equal sign). To
zoom out, press Ô-Option-- (hyphen).
Fortunately these two keys (- and =) are right
next to each other, making these combinations
easier to remember.
4.
Click the Options button to further customize
how the zoom works (see Figure 7-7).

Technique 7: Making Your Mac More Accessible
58
1.
Open System Preferences, if it isn’t already
open.
2.
Go to the Keyboard & Mouse pane.
3.
Adjust the Key Repeat Rate and Delay Until
Repeat settings if you’re having problems with
the same key being repeated (see Figure 7-8).
The Key Repeat Rate dictates how many lower-
case x’s (or whatever) are repeated if Tiger
thinks a key is being held down. The Delay Until
Repeat rate sets how much time must pass for
Tiger to think a key should be repeated. If you’re
a slower typist, increasing the Delay Until Repeat
rate and decreasing the Key Repeat Rate might
minimize typing errors.
• Figure 7-8: Set keyboard repeating rates in the 
Keyboard & Mouse pane.
4.
Adjust the mouse behavior in the correspon-
ding tab.
You can adjust your mouse’s behavior with
respect to its tracking speed (how fast the cursor
moves) and its double-click speed (how quickly
you have to click in succession). You can also —
depending upon the mouse in use — adjust the
speed of the scroll wheel and determine the 
• Figure 7-7: The zoom feature has its own set of
customizable options.
After you zoom in, move your mouse around —
without clicking any buttons — to move the
focus around your screen.
Tiger’s zooming ability can be useful for Mac
people of any kind. It’s very easy to use, doesn’t
interfere with your normal operations, and can
come in handy under a multitude of circum-
stances. Graphic designers in particular will
find it useful.
Customizing the Keyboard and
Mouse to Suit Your Needs
One final way in which you might want to customize
your Mac’s behavior is to adjust how your input
devices function. Slower typists, users with
restricted motor skills, and people who easily
become fatigued can benefit from adjusting the key-
board and mouse settings. There are two related sec-
tions of the System Preferences panel into which you
should delve:

Customizing the Keyboard and Mouse to Suit Your Needs

primary mouse button (which is great if you’re
left-handed and want the right button to be 
primary).
If you have a programmable input device, you
also might be able to adjust how quickly the
device moves the cursor on-screen.
5.
Adjust the trackpad behavior by using the
Trackpad tab (if applicable).
Like the mouse, you can adjust your trackpad’s
behavior with respect to its tracking speed (how
fast the cursor moves) and its double-click speed
(how quickly you have to click in succession).
You can also set important trackpad qualities,
such as whether the trackpad is ignored if a
mouse is present. 
6.
Within the Keyboard Shortcuts tab, turn on
Full keyboard access for all controls.
Doing so lets you more fully navigate your Mac
from the keyboard alone. Technique 10 discusses
this concept in greater detail.
The Keyboard Shortcuts tab is also critical in
that it displays many of the keyboard shortcuts
available within Tiger. Most of these won’t
appear in any menu, so this is the only place
to find them (outside of Mac Help).
7.
Choose View➪Universal Access.
You tweak the remaining settings within
Universal Access.
8.
On the Keyboard tab, set the Sticky Keys and
Slow Keys properties (see Figure 7-9).
Sticky Keys lets you use a difficult keyboard
shortcut, like Ô-Option-H (for Hide Others), with-
out holding down all the keys simultaneously.
The Slow Keys feature adds a delay between the
time you press a key and when your Mac regis-
ters it. On this tab, you can also tell Tiger to beep
when one of the modifier keys has been pressed
and display the pressed keys on your screen.
• Figure 7-9: The keyboard behavior can be customized in
many ways.
9.
On the Mouse & Trackpad tab, turn on Mouse
Keys if you have a numberpad.
The keyboard’s numberpad can be used to con-
trol your mouse. This is a useful adjustment if you
have trouble with mice or trackpads. That being
said, if you don’t have a separate numberpad on
your keyboard (for example, if you have a laptop),
you’ll probably find the pseudo-numberpad to be
much less convenient.
10.
On the Mouse & Trackpad tab, adjust the size
of the cursor if it’s too small for you.
The cursor itself can be hard to see and find on
the screen, so use the sliding bar to increase its
size to a more discernable format.
11.
When you finish adjusting settings, close the
Universal Access pane.
12.
Use your Mac normally, and then readjust the
various properties if needed.

Technique 7: Making Your Mac More Accessible
60
When customizing how you and your Mac inter-
act, remember that this isn’t a static relationship.
How — and how quickly — you’re able to work
might change over time, meaning that you might
have to re-tweak the applicable settings to make
them better represent your current needs.
If you have difficulty typing or using the key-
board, remember that you can also key in let-
ters by using your mouse and the Character
Palette. The Latin category displays the alpha-
bet in upper- and lowercase from which you
can select characters (double-click to insert a
character into the current document). See
Technique 28 for more on the Character
Palette.
Using macros and automated processes
Besides the controls that you can adjust within the System
Preferences panel, you can facilitate your interactions with
your Mac in many other ways. Here are just a couple 
examples:

Use Microsoft Word’s macros to automate typing, for-
matting, and more.

Create Workflows in Automator (see Technique 61) to
perform a sequence of actions, even across multiple
applications, with one simple step.

Use AppleScripts — those you can program yourself or
ones available for download — to run through com-
mon tasks.

Use Microsoft Word’s AutoCorrect feature to create
abbreviations of words.
Although these options aren’t necessarily geared toward
people with special needs, they can be just as or more use-
ful in that capacity.

Working with
Displays
T
he distant ancestor of today’s Macs, the Apple IIe, had a small glass
monitor that supported two colors: black and green. Today’s mod-
ern computers come equipped with beautiful monitors, some of
them liquid crystal display (LCD) or plasma flat-screen, capable of dis-
playing millions of colors, and with a viewing area of nearly two feet. But
there’s more to your monitor than just the physical hardware: You also
use many pieces of software to control what you see and how you see it.
In this technique, you find out a thing or two about what screen resolu-
tion is, how to choose the proper setting, and how to easily manage
these settings. Determining and setting the optimal resolution for your
monitor gives you more screen space to work with, a better interface,
and more reliable results (for graphic designers). Then you work with
color management in Tiger by using ColorSync. We introduce how Mac
OS X handles fonts, why you might want to adjust that behavior, and how
to do it. Finally, we cover how to configure your Mac to make the best
use of multiple monitors.
Managing Your Display Resolution
Most beginning computer users, whether they use a Mac or a PC, never
concern themselves with the display resolution. So why should you?
Because adjusting the display resolution directly affects everything you
do with your computer. (Because it all goes through the monitor, right?)
Monitors create everything that you see on-screen by using pixels, which
are small squares of colored light. Your screen resolution is set in terms
of pixels, such as 800 x 600 pixels. Common measurements for standard
monitors are

800 x 600

1024 x 768

• Figure 8-1: A folder icon at two different resolutions, the
one appearing bigger than the other.
You set screen resolutions from the Displays dialog:
1.
Choose Apple➪System Preferences➪Displays.
2.
Make sure that the Display tab is selected (see
Figure 8-2). 
3.
Select a higher resolution than the current
(presumably default) one.
The screen sizes available for use depend on 
 The display itself
 The video card in the computer (in particular,
the amount of VRAM — Video RAM — that 
it has)
• Figure 8-2: Control your screen resolution from the
Display tab.

You also find these weird numbers if you use laptops
or a cinema display:

896 x 600

1152 x 768

1280 x 854
The screen resolutions used on a display corre-
spond to its aspect ratio. Like televisions, most
traditional monitors use a 4:3 (width:height)
ratio. Most Apple laptops and all Apple cinema
displays use a modified widescreen ratio (like a
movie theater screen or a widescreen televi-
sion) that is closer to 16:9.
These numbers refer to how many pixels comprise
the width and height of the monitor; therefore, a
higher resolution has more pixels. How does this
affect you in practical terms?
For example, compare the images on the left and
right side of Figure 8-1. A higher resolution means
that

You can display more folder icons in the same
monitor space (because the high resolution
offers more pixels).

Each individual folder icon is smaller because the
pixels take less physical monitor space.
A higher resolution allows you to display more
stuff, but everything is smaller.
A higher screen resolution might increase
your productivity (you’ll spend less time tog-
gling around), but also your need to see an
ophthalmologist (you’ll be looking at tiny, tiny
things on-screen). So don’t just accept the
default screen resolution set for your Mac —
find one that works best for you.

Adjusting the Colors
63
4.
Select the Show Displays in Menu Bar 
check box.
Marking this check box creates a monitor control
in the menu bar (shown in Figure 8-3), saving you
trips to the Display panel.
Click the Detect Displays button whenever
you add or remove another monitor, including
a projector. Doing so allows your Mac to rec-
ognize what monitors are currently in use.
Alternatively, you can choose Detect Displays
from the pop-up menu that appears when you
click the menu bar Display icon.
• Figure 8-3: The little monitor icon in the menu bar can be
used to control display settings.
5.
Set the Number of Recent Modes pop-up menu
to 3, if you have that option.
The Recent Modes drop-down list dictates how
many resolutions appear in the menu bar’s
Display menu. You probably have no reason to
show more resolutions than three unless you’ve
got some hog-wild resolution switching going on.
6.
Close the Displays panel.
7.
Experiment with the new monitor setting.
If it’s too hard on the eyes, switch to another res-
olution with either
 The menu bar Display tool (refer to Figure 8-3)
 The Display preference pane (refer to 
Figure 8-2)
As a compromise for your vision, you can use
a high resolution and increase the default font
sizes of the system (see “Handling Fonts” later
in this chapter) and your applications.
Virtual desktops
If you never seem to have enough monitor space for all
your stuff, you can get more screen space for your buck
with an application such as DesktopManager (http://
wsmanager.sourceforge.net, free). This program cre-
ates virtual desktops. A virtual desktop is exactly like the
Finder’s Desktop except that you can have many of them
instead of just the one.
After you create multiple desktops, each can have its own
personality. Each individual Desktop can have its own back-
ground, Dock, set of preferences, open windows, and even
open applications. For example: If you have multiple proj-
ects going on at once, a different Dock can be used for
each environment. Or, you can have one Desktop in which
you’re playing games and using iTunes and another where
you’re actually working.
This is familiar territory for users of the Linux operating sys-
tem. Linux (and other variants of UNIX) primarily uses the
Gnome or KDE application as its version of the Finder. Each
of these applications supports multiple desktops.
You might like the idea of virtual desktops — and you might
not — but if you’re whittling away time one afternoon, it’s
certainly worth your consideration. And the price — free! —
can’t be beat!
Adjusting the Colors
Your monitor doesn’t necessarily display colors in a
manner that’s consistent with other users’ monitors:
It’s a foreign concept to many computer users and a
hard lesson for the novice graphic designer to learn.
In fact, historically, the colors of a Mac have been
slightly brighter than those of a Windows PC. This is
because coloring is a software issue. To help adjust
for these variations, you can create different profiles
with Apple’s ColorSync application. For example,
you can calibrate different color profiles for different
purposes (graphic design, general use) and then
switch among them from the Display panel. To cre-
ate a custom ColorSync profile:

Technique 8: Working with Displays
64
4.
Click the Calibrate button to begin the auto-
mated calibration process.
The Display Calibrator Assistant appears (see
Figure 8-5).
• Figure 8-5: Use the Display Calibrator Assistant to create
your monitor’s color profile.
5.
Follow the on-screen instructions to create
your profile.
The assistant is easy to use and has clear
instructions to help you through the process.
The Display Calibrator Assistant even offers an
expert mode, although if your needs are
advanced enough to require that, you probably
don’t need our help.
If you have a laptop, adjusting the brightness
of your monitor from the Display panel will
throw off your colors.
6.
To change from one profile to another, select
from the available options in the Color section
of the Display panel (see Figure 8-6).
Your Mac probably comes with a couple profiles,
and every profile you add also is listed here.
Select the new profile to make the switch.
1.
Choose Apple➪System Preferences➪Displays
to bring up the Display panel (refer to 
Figure 8-2).
2.
Make sure that the Colors pop-up menu is set to
Millions and that the Refresh Rate drop-down
list is set as high as possible.
The number of colors is just that: how many dif-
ferent colors the monitor will display. We can’t
name 256 colors (let alone a million), but we can
definitely tell the difference between the two set-
tings on the monitor.
The refresh rate determines how often every-
thing on-screen is redrawn. (When you see
computer monitors on television and in
movies with lines scrolling down the page, a
refresh is taking place.) The higher the num-
ber that you select in the Display panel, the
faster the refresh. Even though you’ll probably
never be aware of it, except on the lowest set-
tings, higher refresh rates are easier on the
eyes.
3.
Click the Color tab (as shown in Figure 8-4).
• Figure 8-4: The Color panel of the Displays dialog.

Handling Fonts
65
• Figure 8-6: All the available profiles appear under the
Color panel of the Displays System
Preferences panel.
Graphic designers can create a Mac profile for
everyday use and a Windows profile for seeing
how their work will look on that other operat-
ing system. After you create the two profiles,
switching between the two is a snap!
Handling Fonts
How the system treats fonts affects your overall
Tiger experience. On your Mac, you can adjust how
the operating system handles anti-aliasing. As any
graphic designer will tell you, anti-aliasing minimizes
the jagged edges of characters to produce a
smoother appearance. Like the refresh rate issue,
this is something that you might not consciously
appreciate, but it could have a subtle effect. You can
adjust anti-aliasing by using the Appearance dialog:
1.
Open System Preferences, and under the
Personal heading, click the Appearance icon.
2.
At the bottom of the Appearance dialog that
appears (see Figure 8-7), select the appropriate
font-smoothing style.
• Figure 8-7: The Appearance dialog adjusts many cosmetic
and user interface settings.
 If you don’t like making decisions, select
Automatic and let Tiger do the thinking 
for you.
 If you’re using a traditional monitor, select
Standard.
 If you’re using a flat-screen display (such as a
plasma cinema display or a laptop), select
Medium.
 If for some reason you want the least amount
of font adjustment possible (like us, when
writing this book), use Light.
 If none of these options apply to you and
you’re overwhelmed by the roughness of the
fonts, opt for Strong.
3.
Just below the Font Smoothing Style pop-up
menu, determine to what point sizes font
smoothing should be applied.
From this pop-up menu, you can select 4, 6, 8, 9,
10, or 12. Any font of the size that you choose or
smaller will be anti-aliased. Larger fonts won’t be.
4.
Close the Appearance dialog.

Technique 8: Working with Displays
66
You need an extra video-out port to use mul-
tiple monitors with your Mac. Laptops have an
extra port by default; desktops need either a
second video card or a video card with two
ports.
If you have two monitors (or a monitor and a projec-
tor), there are two ways you can use them. The first
is to have them mirror each other, so that they both
display the exact same information, as if you only
had one monitor. This is useful for presentations or
if you just want to use a bigger monitor for your lap-
top. The second option (nonmirroring) lets the mon-
itors act separately. One monitor will be the primary,
with the menus; the other is just extra screen space.
While very useful, not all Macs — even if they have
an extra video port — can support separate moni-
tors (not without hacking the software, that is). This
includes iMacs, eMacs, and iBooks (consumer line
products).
To configure your Macintosh to work with two moni-
tors (or a monitor and a projector), follow these
steps:
1.
Connect both displays to your Mac.
When connecting any new display, turn off the
display (monitor, television, or projector), make
the connection, and then turn on the display. You
don’t have to turn off your Mac when connecting
a display.
You don’t need to restart your Mac to connect
or disconnect another monitor.
2.
Open the Displays dialog in System
Preferences.
3.
Click the Detect Displays button.
This button brings the new monitor to the Mac’s
attention.
4.
Click the Arrangement tab in the main display
window.
When using the Displays dialog with multiple
monitors, you see two separate windows: 
How TinkerTool can help
TinkerTool, a must-have freeware application provided 
by Marcel Bresink (www.bresink.de/osx/TinkerTool.
html), adds many customization options to Tiger. It’s been
so popular in its many incarnations that its features fre-
quently end up in later versions of OS X. One adjustment
that TinkerTool can make is what fonts to use as the default
system fonts, as shown in the following figure.
By adjusting these fonts, you can have a more personalized
interface, correct for a screen resolution’s settings, and
more accurately control when font smoothing takes place.
Using Multiple Displays
Many Mac users already benefit from the Mac’s ease
of using multiple monitors. Graphic designers and
video editors frequently use multiple monitors to
improve workspace efficiency. High-end applications
such as Apple’s Final Cut Pro, Adobe Photoshop, and
even Macromedia Dreamweaver have so many win-
dows open at once that you almost need to have one
monitor for open windows and another for the work
in progress itself. Laptop users can connect to
another monitor, using both it and the laptop’s built-
in display simultaneously. (The same principle
applies if you hook up a Mac to a projector for a
presentation.) In each of these cases, you need to be
able to manage all the displays. It’s pleasantly simple
with Tiger.

Using Multiple Displays
67
 The main display window (see Figure 8-8)
appears on the display that also has the Dock
and the menu bars.
• Figure 8-8: The main display panel controls the
arrangement of multiple monitors.
 The second display (see Figure 8-9) appears
on the subordinate monitor.
• Figure 8-9: A secondary display panel controls only the
resolution and color settings for the second
monitor.
5.
In the main display, move the monitor icons
around so that they correspond with their
physical relation to each other.
The two connected displays are represented by
the two blue squares in the box below the
Arrangement tab (refer to Figure 8-8). The main
display has a white bar across the top of an icon,
which represents the menu bar. When you under-
stand which icon represents which monitor, you
can click and drag the icons to arrange them the
same way your displays are physically arranged.
If you’re using a monitor and a projector, how
they are arranged in the Displays panel doesn’t
matter (because the screens aren’t next to each
other), but you still need to visualize how the
two screens meet up.
If you’re using two monitors in a nonmirroring
format, you have essentially one large work-
space created by virtually combining the two
display areas. Consequently, the cursor scrolls
off the edge of one monitor and onto the
other. For those to work best, the monitors
should be arranged in the Displays dialog as
they are physically arranged in your work area
or you need to comprehend how the cursor
gets from a monitor to the projector’s screen
(by scrolling off of one side or the other).
6.
Move the menu bar icon to dictate which moni-
tor is the primary.
The primary monitor will have the menu bar and
a Dock at the bottom; if your Dock is on the side
of your screen, it will appear on the leftmost or
rightmost screen side, accordingly.
The white bar on the top of the one display icon
represents the menu bar. You can click and drag
this from one monitor icon to the other to set the
primary computer. Your primary computer will
show the menu bar at the top, the Dock at the
bottom (if that’s your setting), and any mounted
volumes on your Desktop (if it’s set to do so).
If you have two monitors, they can mirror each
other. Mirroring means that both monitors display
the same thing at the same time — which is useful
when giving presentations because you can work on
your computer while still controlling the overhead
projection. The cursor moves in sync on both dis-
plays. To use mirroring

Technique 8: Working with Displays
68
1.
If you haven’t already, enable the Display
menu bar icon (see “Managing Your Display
Resolution,” earlier in this chapter).
The Display menu bar tool provides you with
quicker access to your monitor settings,
including mirroring, resolution, and detecting
new displays.
2.
Click the Display menu bar icon.
3.
Choose Turn On Mirroring from the menu that
appears (see Figure 8-10).
4.
Set the appropriate screen resolution for both
monitors in the Display menu (see Figure 8-10).
In earlier versions of OS X, both monitors had to
use the same resolution for mirroring to work;
fortunately, this is no longer the case.
• Figure 8-10: Control mirroring and the resolution of both
monitors by clicking the Display menu bar
icon.

Use the menu bar Display icon to turn mirror-
ing on and off as necessary.
When giving a presentation, you can use your
Mac’s ability to easily turn monitoring on and
off to your advantage. If you want both moni-
tors to present the same information, turn on
mirroring. If you’d like to do something with-
out everyone in the room seeing it, temporar-
ily turn off mirroring and then use the
nonprojected display.
Quartz Extreme
Tiger supports a feature called Quartz Extreme. Quartz is
the underlying technology that handles 2-D graphics,
which is most everything that you see on a daily basis. A
system that uses Quartz Extreme performs significantly
faster than one that isn’t.
Unfortunately, running a second monitor might disable the
Quartz Extreme feature because it requires AGP 2x
(Advanced Graphics Port) with 16MB VRAM. Running
Quartz Extreme on two monitors requires a video card that
can provide these minimum requirements for each. To find
out whether your system is Quartz Extreme–accelerated (as
shown in the following figure), check out the free Quartz
Extreme Check tool on Marc’s Web site (www.entropy.
ch/software/macosx).

f you read only one technique in this entire book, make it this one. If
you read only two, read the next one, as well. Both of these chapters
discuss keyboard shortcuts: tricks for quickly getting around and
doing stuff with your fingers firmly placed on the keys. Remember: Every
time that your hands have to leave the keyboard to access the mouse,
you lose seconds that could be better spent typing (or playing games).
We divide all the requisite keyboard navigation techniques into two
broad categories: moving around within Finder windows and the more
specific “Getting Places” section, which discusses how to get yourself to
spots on the computer and your network. The first and longest section of
this chapter covers all the ins and outs of navigating windows, which are
the basic unit of the Finder. This is preceded by a brief introduction to
the various keyboard shortcut symbols that you find in Tiger — a sort of
Rosetta Stone for these commands. We also cover the Desktop because
not everything you do takes place inside a window. The final section
shows you how to quickly access parts of your Mac. These shortcuts can
be used inside or outside of Finder windows.
Keyboard Characters
Many of the keyboard navigation techniques can be found on-screen —
for example, on the Go menu (see Figure 9-1). To use these shortcuts, you
have to first know what the symbols mean. In case you never knew or
simply forgot, Table 9-1 shows how Tiger symbolically refers to the modi-
fier keys (Command, Control, Shift, Option, and Del).

Moving Around in a 
Finder Window
Navigating, manipulating, and otherwise using the
Finder windows is such an integral part of getting
the most out of Tiger that we devote this and the
next three techniques to covering it. In Tiger, the
windows are highly customizable so that you can
tweak them to their own particular preferences.
If you really, really, really want to be able to
use your Mac faster, learn to type well.
Knowing how to type is infinitely quicker than
hunting and pecking. It also improves the
speed benefits of these keyboard shortcut
chapters.
The Finder has many shortcuts. Beginners might be
a bit overwhelmed at first. The shortcuts can vary
depending on what view mode you’re using. The
Finder supports three view modes:

Icon view

List view

Column view
In this technique, we discuss some keyboard short-
cuts that work in every view mode and then cover
those that work only in a particular view mode.
While in a window, use Ô-1 to switch to icon
view, Ô-2 to go to list view, and Ô-3 for col-
umn view. These shortcuts correspond to the
order of the View icons at the top of the
Finder window.
Navigating in any view mode
These navigational tips apply in every view mode:
• Figure 9-1: The Go menu can help you navigate with the
mouse, and it lists the keyboard equivalents.

Moving Around in a Finder Window
71

Type a letter to go to the first item whose name
begins with that letter.

If multiple items begin with the same letter, type
two or more letters to be more selective.

Press Tab repeatedly to jump alphabetically
through a window’s contents.

Hold down Shift while pressing Tab repeatedly to
scroll backwards alphabetically through a win-
dow’s contents.

Press Ô-[ or ] to move backward or forward,
respectively, like clicking the Back and Forward
buttons in a Web browser.
A Finder window can contain any combination
of files, applications, folders, network links, and
even volumes (hard drives, removable drives,
discs). We use the generic items to collectively
refer to all these things. (In other words, items
means things you might find in a Finder 
window.)

Use Ô-~ (the tilde, found in the upper-left corner
of the keyboard) to toggle among the open win-
dows and the Desktop.

Use the arrow keys (left, right, up, down) to
move as you would expect (namely, left, right,
up, or down).
Which view mode you use is best determined
by context and personal tastes. Technique 12
discusses the merits of each individually and
helps you decide when you should use which.
Navigating in icon view
The icon view mode (see Figure 9-2) shows the win-
dow’s contents as, well, icons. Although icon view
also shows each item’s name, you mostly see the
icons themselves. The basic shortcuts that we
describe in the previous section also work in icon
view.
• Figure 9-2: Icon view mode is familiar to every Mac user,
although yours might look slightly different.
Use Ô-1 to switch to icon view.
In addition, here are some Ô options that you can
use to navigate in icon view:

Press Ô-↑to go up one level (to the parent
folder).

Use Ô-↓to go into the selected folder (see the
Documents folder in Figure 9-3).
• Figure 9-3: In icon view, a folder is marked as selected
when the name is highlighted in the selection
color.

Press Ô-O to go into a selected folder.

Technique 9: Speedy Keyboard Navigation
72
Use Ô-2 to switch to list view.
Here are some basic commands for navigating
through list view:

Use the up and down arrows to move up and
down the list.

Press the right arrow to expand a selected folder
(see Figure 9-5). This is the equivalent of clicking
the little right-pointing triangle next to an item’s
name with your mouse pointer.

Use the left arrow to close an expanded folder,
assuming that it’s selected. This is the equivalent
of clicking a down-pointing triangle with your
mouse.
• Figure 9-5: Expand a selected directory by pressing the
right arrow.
On top of these basic commands, all the Ô keyboard
shortcuts that work for the icon view also work in
the list view. For a refresher on those, refer to the
section, “Navigating in icon view.”
Navigating in column view
The column view mode is the most complex of the
three. It works a little like the list view mode but also
allows you to navigate forward and backward by
viewing the hierarchy as a series of columns within
the Finder window (see Figure 9-6).
Ô-O is the keyboard shortcut for opening
items in general. You can use it to navigate by
opening a folder, to start an application by
“opening” its icon, or to open a file.

Press Ô-Shift-O to open the currently selected
folder in a new window.
Would you like a new window with that?
If you really like windows, you can set the Finder to open all
directories in their own new windows. To do so
1.
Press Ô-, (comma) to bring up the Finder prefer-
ences panel.
2.
Select the Always Open Folders in a New
Window check box.
3.
Press Ô-W to close the Finder preferences
panel.
If you enable this option, Tiger opens up a new window
every time you open a directory. We find that this habit cre-
ates a very busy work environment, so we prefer to simply
use Ô-Shift-O to manually request a new window when we
need one.
Navigating in list view
The list view (see Figure 9-4) shows the contents of a
folder as an itemized list. It always lists the names of
the items, but might also display various other prop-
erties. (You can customize what properties are
shown. For more information, see Technique 12.)
• Figure 9-4: The list view mode.

Moving Around in a Finder Window
73
listed in the second column are all in the
Application Support folder, which is high-
lighted in gray in the first column.
The quickest way to navigate through columns
is to type the initial letter of an item to select
it, and then press the right arrow to move to
the next column. Repeat until you find the
item or directory you’re looking for.
Tiger offers you the choice of using column view as
your default view mode. To do so
1.
Get yourself over to the Finder by clicking the
Desktop or the Finder icon in the Dock.
2.
Press Ô-, (comma) to bring up the Finder pref-
erences panel.
3.
Click the General button if it isn’t already
selected.
4.
Select the Open New Windows in Column View
check box (see Figure 9-8).
• Figure 9-8: Use the Finder’s preferences panel to set
column view as the default.
5.
Close the preferences panel by pressing Ô-W.
• Figure 9-6: The curious but extremely useful column
view mode.
Use Ô-3 to switch to column view.
Here are some frequently used shortcuts for column
view:

Use the up and down arrows to move up and
down within a column.

Press the right arrow to move one column to the
right (see Figure 9-7).
• Figure 9-7: The right arrow moves you into a subfolder’s
listing column.

Use the left arrow to move one column to the
left.
When in column mode, the currently selected
item is highlighted with your selection/high-
light color. The gray highlight in preceding col-
umn indicates which folder’s contents are
listed in the current column. For example, in
Figure 9-7, the currently selected item is the
folder called AddressBook, which is high-
lighted in the selection color and whose 
contents appear in the third column. The items

Technique 9: Speedy Keyboard Navigation

Navigating the Desktop
The Desktop has some keyboard navigation tricks of
its own, most of which get you to a Finder window.
Some of these options are limited based on how
you’ve customized your Desktop (for example, what
hard drives, servers, and devices will appear there).
The basics are

Pressing the arrow keys works as expected, mov-
ing you up, down, left, and right.

Pressing Tab moves you alphabetically from item
to item.

Pressing Shift-Tab moves you reverse alphabeti-
cally from item to item.

Typing the first letter or two of any item’s name
selects that item.
Within Open/Save dialogs, Ô-D is the shortcut
to your Desktop.
The following four shortcuts all require the ever-
popular Ô key:

Ô-N creates a new Finder window showing the
default directory.
Use the Finder’s preferences to determine
which directory a new window should open by
default (refer to Figure 9-8).

Ô-Shift-↑takes you to the boot disk drive on the
Desktop (the volume on which the running oper-
ating system is installed; see Figure 9-9).

Ô-O opens a folder, volume, file, or application.

Ô-↓opens a folder or volume.
Exposé, which we cover in Technique 15,
brings with it its own keyboard shortcuts.
• Figure 9-9: Pressing Ô-Shift-↑on the Desktop highlights
the boot volume.
Getting Places
You can get to important spots on your Mac with a
number of specific keyboard shortcuts. These work
whether you’re in a Finder window or just on the
Desktop itself. The first three are the most useful:

Ô-Shift-A takes you to the Applications directory.

Ô-Shift-U goes to the Utilities directory.

Ô-Shift-H moves you to your Home folder.
Most of these keyboard shortcuts are 
duplicated — and listed — in the Finder’s Go
menu (refer to Figure 9-1).
These are handy typing tips, but you might never
need them:

Ô-Shift-K brings up the window displaying avail-
able networks.

Ô-K brings up the Connect to Server prompt.

Ô-Shift-I mounts your iDisk (for .Mac users only).

Ô-? retrieves the Help Viewer application. (This
is technically Ô-Shift-/ because you need to
press Shift to get the question mark.)
One of the shareware applications that we rec-
ommend most often in this book is LaunchBar,
created by Objective Development (www.
obdev.at; $39 for businesses, $20 for per-
sonal use, free for limited use). Use LaunchBar

Getting Places
75
The Keyboard Shortcuts panel is a potent tool
if you know how to use it. You can even use it
to add your own customized shortcuts. See
Technique 10 for further examples.
The default keyboard shortcuts, listed in the
Shortcut column shown in Figure 9-11, primarily use
the Control key in conjunction with your function
keys. Under the Keyboard Navigation heading in
Figure 9-11, you see that:

Control-F2 takes you to the menu bar. (It’s just
like clicking the menu bar with your mouse.)

Control-F3 takes you to the Dock.
• Figure 9-11: The Keyboard Navigation shortcuts can really
minimize the need to use the mouse.
After you select the Dock by pressing Control-
F3, you can toggle from icon to icon by using
the left- and right-arrow keys or Tab and Shift-
Tab. Press Return to select a highlighted icon.
When you’re in the toolbar of a window, use
Tab and Shift-Tab to move around. You can
use the spacebar to select an item, just like
clicking it with your mouse.
to quickly and easily get to applications, send
e-mails, open Web pages, and more without
ever leaving your keyboard. In fact, that’s the
entire point: LaunchBar lets you do many
common tasks just by typing short abbrevia-
tions. Techniques 23, 32, and 34 show specific
examples.
Another method of getting around your computer is
to use Full Keyboard Access. Full Keyboard Access
enables you to use the Tab, arrow, and other keys to
select on-screen items. To enable this, follow these
steps:
1.
Open the System Preferences panel.
2.
Click the Keyboard & Mouse icon.
3.
Click the Keyboard Shortcuts tab of the
Keyboard & Mouse panel that appears.
4.
Click the radio button next to All Controls 
(see Figure 9-10).
5.
Under Description, click any of the right-
pointing arrows to expand a section.
6.
Select the check box next to a shortcut or short-
cut group to enable or disable it.
• Figure 9-10: Use the Keyboard Shortcuts tab to enable
Full Keyboard Access for all control elements.

Technique 9: Speedy Keyboard Navigation
76
Using the Go To Folder dialog
In the Finder, the Ô-Shift-G keyboard shortcut brings up
the Go To Folder dialog (shown in the following figure),
which you can use to quickly navigate to specific directories.
Using the Go To Folder dialog offers the following benefits:

A new Finder window is opened if one isn’t open
already.

If a Finder window is open, the Go To Folder dialog
operates within it.

Tab completion (which allows you to type just a few
characters and then press Tab to complete the entry)
saves you from typing in long names.

The Go To Folder dialog is case-insensitive.

You can access hidden directories that don’t otherwise
appear in the Finder.

For those familiar with the cd command, the Go To
Folder dialog works identically to it.
The only trick to using the Go To Folder dialog is that you
need to know the path name for your desired destination.
A path name is the path of folders that you must follow to
find something on the computer. For example:

The base (root) level is /.

Apple’s e-mail client is in /Applications.

A file on Larry’s Desktop would be under /Users/
larry/Desktop (larry is the short username that 
he registered with).

Larry’s Desktop could also be written in shorthand as
~/Desktop; ~ (the tilde) represents the current user’s
Home directory.

A folder on a secondary volume would have a path
name of /Volumes/volumename/foldername.
This might seem like more trouble than it’s worth, but if
you have a basic understanding of where things are on
your computer, Tiger really helps you out.
To start:
1.
Bring up the Go menu prompt by pressing 
Ô-Shift-G.
2.
Start typing the path name with either
 ~/ (refers to your Home directory)
 / (refers to the root or base level of the computer)
3.
Begin typing the first letter or first few letters of
the directory that’s next in the path name.
For example, if something is in your Documents
folder, type Do or Doc after the ~/. If it’s on your sec-
ond hard drive, type /Vo. In the figure, I begin with
~/Do to start heading into my Documents folder.
4.
Press Tab to have Tiger complete the directory
name.
Or, if you wait just a moment, the directory name is
automatically filled in. This next figure shows how
~/Do was turned into ~/Documents/.
5.
Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until the full path name 
of the folder that you want to explore is 
written out.
6.
Press Return or click the Go button to load that
directory in a Finder window.

Getting Places
77
All in all, the Go To Folder dialog is a really smart way to
quickly hop to specific destinations on your computer.
Furthermore, getting comfortable with this system makes
the transition to using the Terminal for command line tasks
less daunting. (And most power users eventually take the
Terminal for a spin.)

Technique
Essential Keyboard
Shortcuts
I
n this technique, we focus on more general keyboard shortcuts 
(as opposed to Technique 9, which covers navigation specifically).
These are really the most important keyboard shortcuts on your Mac
because they let you quickly do all the things you commonly do: Open
items, save documents, print things, and so forth.
We begin with a hodgepodge of keyboard combinations that you should
know if you don’t already. These combinations cover several common
tasks. Then we go over application-related shortcuts — the key combina-
tions that you use to navigate among open applications and those that
work within all applications. Finally, this technique covers the function
keys and how to set your own keyboard shortcuts.
The Most Essential of the Essential 
Keyboard Shortcuts
This and the preceding technique present a cornucopia of useful and
worthy keyboard shortcuts, but you might have difficultly memorizing
them all. These, therefore, are the most important all-purpose shortcuts:

Pressing Return is the same as clicking OK, Yes, Continue, or whatever
the default action is for a button in a prompt (see Figure 10-1).
• Figure 10-1: Pressing Return is the same as clicking the highlighted button.


Pressing Esc is the same as clicking Cancel.

Ô-A selects everything in the currently used
directory or document.

Ô-C copies the selected (or highlighted) text or
image to the Clipboard.

Ô-X copies the selected (or highlighted) text or
image and stores it on the Clipboard and then
deletes it from its current location.

Ô-V pastes the current contents of the Clipboard
into the current document, window, or other
location.

Ô-Z undoes the previous action, whatever it is.
Most people know that the Ô-Z trick works in
applications to undo the last action, but it also
functions in the Finder. You can use this short-
cut to undelete a deleted (but not trashed) file
or to unmove something. Pretty much what-
ever you just did can be undone with Ô-Z,
with some exceptions.

Ô-O opens anything (folders, files, volumes, or
applications).

Ô-F brings up the Find prompt (see Figure 10-2
for an example of a Find prompt; this one is from
Safari) or a new search window in the Finder.
• Figure 10-2: Safari’s Find prompt.

Ô-Shift-N creates a new folder within the current
directory.

Ô-N creates a new Finder window.
In the Finder preferences panel, you can use
the New Finder Windows Open pop-up menu
to set in which directory each new Finder win-
dow automatically opens (see Figure 10-3).
Bring up this panel by choosing Preferences
from the Finder menu and clicking the
General tab.
• Figure 10-3: Use the Finder’s preferences to adjust a new
window’s default behavior.

Ô-Delete sends an item to the Trash.

Ô-Shift-Delete takes the Trash to the curb (which
is to say, empties it).
Those are the most critical keyboard shortcuts, but
here are a few more that are easy to remember and
quite useful:

Technique 10: Essential Keyboard Shortcuts


Ô-W closes the active window.

Ô-Option-W closes every open window.

Ô-M minimizes the active open window.

Ô-Option-M minimizes every open window.

Ô-P prints a document.

Ô-I brings up the Get Info prompt, where you can
find information about (as well as control) some of
the properties of a file, a folder, or an application.

Ô-J brings up a window’s (or the Desktop’s) view
options.

Ô-Shift-Q lets you log out.
You can often find most or all of the shortcuts
available within a particular application, includ-
ing the Finder, by searching with the word
shortcut in that application’s Help pages.
Alternatively, KeyCue (www.ergonis.com/
products/keycue, $15) displays in a floating
window every menu keyboard shortcut for the
current application.
Most of the preceding shortcuts work in the Finder,
and most of them also function within applications
(particularly those by Apple). The following short-
cuts are more particular to the Finder:

Ô-D duplicates the currently selected item or
items.
If you can’t or don’t want to remember that
Ô-D duplicates items, you can always select
the item, copy it by pressing Ô-C, and then
create the duplicate by pasting the copied
item with Ô-V.

Ô-L makes an alias to the currently selected item
or items. An alias (what Windows calls a
shortcut) is a reference to an item. We cover
these in Technique 17.

Ô-R locates an original file that an alias or a
pointer represents.
The Ô-R shortcut is most useful in two specific
instances. In the Finder, if you select an alias, it
takes you to the item that the alias points to.
In iTunes, if you select a particular track, 
Ô-R takes you to the physical file on your
computer.

Ô-T adds the selected item to the window’s side-
bar (see Technique 12 for more).

Ô-E ejects the selected disk or disc. (This disc
could be an external FireWire hard drive, a Zip or
floppy disk, a CD-ROM or DVD, or a mounted disk
image.)
When it comes to doing things on your Mac in
the most convenient way, don’t forget
Universal Access, a special set of accessibility
tools for improving the standard Tiger inter-
face. We cover this and similar concepts in
Technique 7.
Application Shortcuts
Pretty much everything that you do on your Mac
takes place within an application. (Technically,
everything you do takes place within an application
because the Finder is considered an app.) You’ll
probably have several applications open at the same
time. Although Part IV of this book really covers
applications in all their glory, this section covers the
highlights that should be second nature.
Technique 24 addresses application switching
in greater detail, discussing several shareware
applications that can be used expressly for this
purpose, such as LiteSwitch X (www.proteron.
com/liteswitchx, $15). Technique 23 dis-
cusses the similar concept of launching appli-
cations, for which a slew of tools exists.
Here’s an easy way to switch applications:

Application Shortcuts
81
1.
Begin by holding down Ô and then pressing
Tab to bring up a palette listing the currently
open applications, with the most recently 
used application automatically selected (see
Figure 10-4).
• Figure 10-4: The list of currently running applications.
2.
While holding down Ô, press Tab repeatedly
to move among the application icons until the
desired application is selected.
Press Ô-Shift-Tab to go in reverse order.
3.
Release Ô to bring up the selected application.
4.
Press Escape to cancel the switch.
The Finder, Safari, and a few other applica-
tions all have a command similar to Ô-Tab.
You can use Ô-~ (tilde) to toggle among the
open windows.
Working with many applications and windows has
two primary considerations: switching among them
and clearing out the clutter. Knowing how to hide
current and background applications goes a long
way toward creating a neater workspace and giving
you peace of mind.

Use Ô-H to hide the current application.

Use Ô-Option-H to hide all the background 
applications.
Exposé, Tiger’s window management tool, cre-
ates special mouse and keyboard commands
to access all the open windows for the current
application or the whole operating system. 
Get thee over to Technique 15 to find out all
about it.
Getting fancy with Ô-Tab
Strange as it might seem, you can also use your mouse (or
other input device) in conjunction with Ô-Tab. After you
bring up the palette, you can hover your cursor over an
application’s icon to select it and then release the Ô key to
travel there. You don’t even need to click the mouse for this
to work.
This means that you can perform drag-and-drop actions
with Ô-Tab and your mouse or other input device:
1.
In an open application, select the text, image, or
whatever you want to copy elsewhere.
2.
Click and hold the selection.
3.
While continuing to hold your mouse click, drag
the selection slightly off in any direction.
4.
Press Ô-Tab to bring up the open application’s
palette.
5.
Use either your cursor or Tab to select the desti-
nation application (while continuing to hold both
the mouse button and the Ô key).
6.
Release the Ô key to bring up the destination 
application.
7.
Position your cursor in the appropriate location
in the new application.
8.
Release the mouse key to complete the move.
This process might seem foreign at first, but it’s remarkably
effective and a good alternative to copying and pasting.

Technique 10: Essential Keyboard Shortcuts
82
Function Keys
The purpose of the function keys changes dramati-
cally based on whether you’re using a desktop or
a laptop Mac. Desktop Macs don’t have overriding
default function key purposes, although existing
applications and Finder shortcuts use many of them.
If you have a laptop, you might need to hold
down the fn key to use the function keys for
other than their default purposes (such as
changing the brightness or the volume).
If you have a laptop, familiarize yourself with using
these default functions:

F1 dims the display.

F2 brightens the display.

F3 mutes the sound.

F4 lowers the sound volume.

F5 increases the sound volume.

F6 engages the number lock feature, turning the
keypad into a number pad.
The function keys can perform other, lesser-
known shortcuts. Holding down Option while
pressing any of the brightness control keys
brings up the Display System Preferences
panel. Holding down the Option key while
pressing any of the sound control keys brings
up the System Preferences Sound panel.
You can change the behavior of function keys by
using shareware (sweet, sweet shareware):

uControl (http://gnufoo.org/ucontrol/
ucontrol.html, free) lets you
 Change the function (ha!) of your keys, includ-
ing the function keys. (In other words, you
can reprogram what a key does.)
 Use Mac laptop function keys without holding
down the fn key.

SimpleKeys (www.pidog.com, $15) is a more
advanced version of uControl. Not only can you
program the function keys, you can also execute
AppleScripts or paste text with keyboard 
shortcuts.
Programming Your Own
Keyboard Shortcuts
The Mac has supported programming the function
keys in many ways over the years, but Tiger includes
a utility that does even more. From the Keyboard
Shortcuts pane, you can create your own keyboard
shortcuts that call menu commands. These short-
cuts can work in a particular application or in all of
them. Here’s a primer on how to use it, making a key-
board shortcut for the Finder’s File➪Create Archive
command.
1.
Open System Preferences.
2.
Click the Keyboard & Mouse icon (under
Hardware).
3.
In the Keyboard & Mouse pane, click the

(see Figure 10-5).
Even if you never want to create your own
keyboard shortcuts, the Keyboard Shortcuts
pane is still great for reminding you of many
of the existing shortcuts that you can use.

b. In the Menu Title text box, enter the name of
the menu command that you want to assign
the shortcut to.

After you log out and log back in or restart
your computer, the new shortcut is available
(see Figure 10-7).
• Figure 10-7: The new keyboard shortcut has been added

Many applications have a system for creating
your own shortcuts as well. For example, in
Microsoft Word, you can create a macro and
assign it to a keyboard shortcut.
You must enter the name exactly as it appears
in the menu except for replacing ellipsis (. . .)
with a semicolon (;).
c. Immediately enter the keyboard shortcut by
pressing the key combination.

Technique
A Faster Finder
T
he Mac OS X Finder is the most important and most used applica-
tion on the Mac, yet many people don’t take advantage of its full
potential. It is the main interface for you to access files, applica-
tions, CD-ROMs, and more. Being familiar with it and knowing how to 
customize its behavior to suit your tastes is critical to saving time on
your Mac.
This technique begins with the Finder preferences that can be set within
Tiger. Included after this section is a treatment of the Finder’s many
menus. Then a number of input-device-related shortcuts are covered 
(the clicking equivalent of many of the keyboard shortcuts listed in the
preceding two techniques). 
Finder Preferences
Customizing the Finder involves using two tools: the Finder preferences
panel and the Desktop’s View Options panel. (You can also customize the
Finder windows themselves, which is an entirely different topic; see
Technique 12.)
To bring up the Finder preferences panel, either

Press Ô-, (comma).

Click Finder on the menu bar and then choose Preferences.
To customize the Desktop, press Ô-J or choose View➪Show View
Options. We cover this topic in Technique 16.

Finder Preferences
85
The preferences panel (see Figure 11-1) is divided
into four sections: General, Labels, Sidebar, and
Advanced.
• Figure 11-1: The Finder’s preferences panel.
General
The General section has a few important controls:

Show These Items on the Desktop: We recom-
mend marking all these check boxes, which
makes accessing these items and knowing what’s
connected or mounted to your computer easier.

New Finder Windows Open: Use this pop-up
menu to determine what folder is the default
folder when opening new windows. Setting this
value saves you a navigational step (for example,
hopping over to your Home directory) with each
new window.
If you keep your Home directory organized as
Apple and the authors of this book recom-
mend and you use it accordingly, set the
Finder to open all new windows in the Home
directory, where every document that you
need will be stored.

Always Open Folders in a New Window:
Selecting this check box is useful only if you
really, really like having lots of open windows
around.

Open New Windows in Column View: Column
view is the only view mode that can be set as the
default view for new windows. If you like it, mark
this box.

Spring-Loaded Folders and Windows: Spring-
loaded folders and windows pop open when you
drag something onto them. If you start dragging
a file and hold it over a folder, that folder springs
open so that you can place the file within a sub-
folder. You can even continue to spring open sub-
folders, allowing you to place a file several
directories into your hard drive without navigat-
ing there first.
Labels
After dropping off the radar in earlier versions of
Mac OS X, Labels — the OS 9 color-coded decorating
tool — has made a triumphant comeback. In fact, it’s
better than ever. Labels allow you to mark items
with a special highlight color, each color having its
own particular meaning. To assign what the colors
represent, do the following:
1.
Open Finder’s preferences panel by pressing
Ô-, (comma).
2.
Click the Labels button (see Figure 11-2).

Technique 11: A Faster Finder
86
• Figure 11-3: Add a label to an item from its contextual
menu.
In icon view mode, the item’s name is highlighted in
the label color (see Figure 11-5). In list and column
view mode, the entire line is highlighted. After
you’ve begun using labels, you can add the Label
column to the list view windows (see the section
“Show View Options” later in this chapter for
instructions) and then sort by this value (see
Figure 11-6).
If you use numbers in your label names (for
example, 1 Critical, 2 Important, down to 7
Low), you can easily sort a Finder window of
items by label, and they sort in numeric order.
• Figure 11-2: The Labels panel with its default values.
3.
Highlight a color name and change the text to
whatever label makes the most sense to you.
4.
Tab to the next label and change that text.
Repeat until a label name is set for each color.
5.
Close the Finder’s preferences panel.
To use the Labels, follow these steps
1.
Select the item or items in a Finder window.
2.
Control-click the item to bring up the contex-
tual menu (see Figure 11-3).
3.
Under the Color Label heading on the contex-
tual menu, click the appropriate color.
When you click each color, the contextual menu
shows the label associated with each color to
make the selection easier and more accurate. 
(In Figure 11-4, the label reads “Urgent.”)

Finder Preferences
87
• Figure 11-4: When selecting a label color, the contextual
menu shows the corresponding text label.
• Figure 11-5: Labeled items in icon view mode.
• Figure 11-6: Sorting by label in list view mode.
Sidebar
The Sidebar preferences panel (see Figure 11-7)
affects which items appear in a window’s sidebar:

The top half of the Sidebar preferences panel dic-
tates what appears in the top half of the window
sidebar.

The bottom half controls whether three specific
folders — the Desktop, your Home directory, or
the Applications folder — appear in the bottom
half of the window sidebar.
Enable or disable the items in the Sidebar
preferences panel that you don’t need to use
or access on a regular basis.
The Sidebar panel is the only place where you
can customize the top half of the window’s
sidebar. You can also customize the bottom
half manually. See Technique 12 for more.
Advanced
The Advanced pane of the Finder preferences win-
dow has just two options in the current version of
Tiger (see Figure 11-8).You can set the Finder to
always show the file extensions if you’re most com-
fortable dealing with files in this manner. (Note: A
file’s icon also implies its extension most of the
time.) You can also set whether you see those pesky
warnings when taking out the Trash.

Technique 11: A Faster Finder
88
• Figure 11-7: The Sidebar preferences panel.
• Figure 11-8: The Advanced section of the Finder’s
preferences panel.
If you trust your trashing capabilities, disable
the Show Warning Before Emptying the Trash
option in the Advanced panel.
Changing themes
Another way to customize your Finder is to adjust what
theme it uses. By default, the Finder uses the Aqua theme,
which controls the appearance of windows, buttons, alerts,
fonts, and more. (Basically everything that gives the operat-
ing system a consistent look from application to application
is set in the theme.)
Changing your theme isn’t for the faint of heart (Apple
generally discourages the practice) and, arguably, has a
minor payoff. If you like to tinker, head over to www.
resexcellence.com/themes
to download different
themes and find links to useful shareware. You’ll probably
want one of the following:

ShapeShifter (www.unsanity.com/haxies/shape
shifter, $20), which lets you change themes in the
least intrusive way possible.

Duality 4.0 GT (http://carpestellarem.com/
Products/Duality), which allows you to change the
themes (they call them schemes). Duality is available in
both free and professional (paid) versions.

ThemeChanger (http://sourceforge.net/
projects/themechanger), which also changes
themes and is also free.
Show View Options
You can access the Finder’s second area of cus-
tomization by either

Choosing View➪Show View Options.

Pressing Ô-J.
The View Options settings apply to the currently
active window, if one is open and active. If no win-
dow is open and active, the View Options panel
applies to the Desktop.
When you apply the View Options to the Desktop
(see Figure 11-9), you control only how items appear
on the Desktop. (View Options can affect Finder win-
dows more dramatically.) Here’s the two-second
guide to what the options mean:

Menus
89

The first three settings — Icon Size, Text Size,
and Label Position — do what you’d expect:
They control how big an item’s icon is in pixels,
adjust the point size for the item’s name, and
position the item’s name either underneath or to
the right of the item’s icon.
• Figure 11-9: The View Options panel for the Desktop.
If your monitor is set at a high resolution (see
Technique 8), you can increase the size of your
icons and label text to accommodate this.

The final four check boxes in the View Options
dialog affect how items are arranged on the
Desktop and what information is revealed. 
The most important of the four check boxes is
Keep Arranged By, which allows you to maintain
order in an otherwise chaotic universe (or
Desktop). Mark this check box and use the drop-
down menu to arrange your Desktop by Name,
Date Modified, Date Created, Size, Kind, or Label.
If you select the Show Item Info check box,
image sizes are displayed along with their
names, and size of hard drives and discs
(including remaining space) are listed below
their names. The Show Icon Preview check
box turns an image’s icon into a miniature
representation of the actual image (in icon
view only).
Menus
The Finder, like any other application, has a series of
menus across the top of the display where you can
access commonly used features. The Finder’s menus
are located in two areas:

In the upper-left corner are the standard menus
(see Figure 11-10).

In the upper-right corner are extra and third-
party menus (see Figure 11-11).
• Figure 11-10: The standard Finder menus.
• Figure 11-11: The extended Finder menus, including third-
party additions.
To rearrange or remove an item from the right
side of the menu bar, hold down Ô while
clicking the icon. Then you can either drag the
item off to remove it (it disappears in a cloud
of smoke) or drag it side to side to move it
(the other icons move out of its way).

Technique 11: A Faster Finder
90

Window: The Window menu controls the open
Finder windows (much like an application’s
Window menu gives you access to the open doc-
uments in that application). Although it does
give you an easy way to handle the mess of mul-
tiple windows, you might find Exposé to be an
easier solution.

Help: Need help? Use this menu to bring up the
Help Viewer application.
The right side menu area is a more flexible place;
what’s there depends on what you’ve enabled. For
example:

The Fast User Switching menu appears here if
Fast User Switching is enabled under Accounts.

The system clock reveals itself if you have it set
to do so in the Date & Time control panel.

The display menu makes an appearance if you
have it set to do so in the Displays panel.

The volume control appears here if you have it
set to do so in the Sound panel.

The Keyboard Menu shows up if you’ve set it to
do so under System Preferences➪International➪
Input Menu.

Laptops show their battery status here if you’ve
set it to do so in the Energy Saver panel.
Furthermore, extensions and applications add
menus here.
Many freeware and shareware applica-
tions exist to modify or otherwise add to
the menu bar. A quick sample includes
the ever popular TinkerTool
(www.bresink.de/
osx/tinkertool.html, free), wClock
(www.wolfware.com/wclock.html, free),
FruitMenu (www.unsanity.com/haxies/
fruitmenu, $10), and Classic Menu
(www.sigsoftware.com/classicmenu, $10).
The standard menus include

Apple: The Apple menu (Ú) is the catch-all for
Tiger. Including system tools such as Software
Update and System Preferences, it allows you to
change the Dock settings and your network loca-
tion, and it also lists the most recently used
items. The bottom half of the Apple menu is for
force-quitting applications, shutting down,
restarting, putting your Mac to sleep, and logging
out. (Read more on some of these in Technique 5.)

Finder: The Finder menu gives you access to its
preferences panel (see earlier in this technique),
controls the showing and hiding of applications,
and links to Services (see Technique 29).

File: The File menu is for basic file-management
stuff (such as opening and closing) and includes
most of the often-used commands and keyboard
shortcuts.

Edit: The Edit menu, like any application’s Edit
menu, gives you access to editing shortcuts, the
keyboard equivalents of which should be second
nature to any power user. Two interesting fea-
tures here show you the contents of the
Clipboard (useful if you forget what you copied
there) and bring up the Character Palette to
access special characters.

View: The View menu is mostly useful with
respect to windows (see Technique 12). Most of
the options are grayed out (unusable) unless
you’re in a Finder window. The remaining
choices affect the Desktop.
The View menu lets you customize a selected
Finder window or the Desktop. Conversely, the
Window menu lets you control windows: You
can switch among open windows, minimize a
window, and bring all windows to focus.

Go: The Go menu is a nice little navigational tool,
giving you links and the keyboard equivalents for
quickly accessing common places. We prefer the
keyboard shortcuts ourselves, but the menu
option is handy to have, and you can find the
keyboard shortcuts listed there as a reminder.

Using Your Input Device
91
AppleScript’s Script Menu
AppleScript is a powerful automating tool that has been
part of the Mac operating system for years. It’s so easy to
work with that even nonprogrammers can grasp its con-
cepts, and yet potent enough that seasoned programmers
will be pleased. Not only does Tiger come with literally
dozens of prebuilt AppleScripts, but it even comes with a
tool for easily accessing them: Script Menu.
To enable Script Menu and add a menu icon for it
1.
In the Finder, navigate to
Applications➪AppleScript.
2.
Double-click the AppleScript Utility icon to open
it.
3.
Select the Show Script Menu check box in menu
bar to enable the AppleScript menu.
4.
Click the new AppleScript logo located on the
right side of the Finder menu.
The logo looks like a stylized S, or a scroll (as in the
figure).
5.
Browse through the folders of scripts and select
any script to run.
You can also download and install other scripts created by
Apple:
1.
Go to www.apple.com/applescript/scriptmenu.
2.
Download any of the extra scripts available
there.
3.
Open the downloaded archive(s).
4.
From the ApplesScript menu, select Open Scripts
Folder and then choose one of the subfolders
from this menu (see the figure).
5.
Drop the downloaded scripts into the Scripts
folder window that was opened in Step 4.
The new scripts will be available at the bottom of the Script
Menu. Depending upon which option you took in Step 4
(affecting which folder was opened), the new script will be
available just within a specific application, just for you, or for
all users on the Mac.
Using Your Input Device
Your input device, be it a trackpad, mouse, trackball,
or graphic tablet, has some pretty impressive power.
Using input devices with the Finder automatically
brings with it a slew of useful timesaving techniques,
much like the keyboard shortcuts that the previous
two chapters highlight.


Press the spacebar while dragging an item onto a
folder or volume to make it pop open immedi-
ately (assuming that you have the spring-loaded
feature enabled under General preferences). 
Here are some basic mouse moves that any Mac
maven must memorize:

Click any item to select it.

Click and drag to select multiple items.

Double-click any file to open it in its default
application.

Double-click any folder to open it.

Double-click any application’s icon to launch it.

Click and hold a Dock icon to bring up a menu.

Double-click a window’s title bar to minimize it.

Drag an item over a folder or volume to make 
it pop open (assuming that you have the 
spring-loaded feature enabled under General
preferences).
You can accomplish even more with your mouse by
clicking in combination with various modifier keys,
such as Control or Option:

Control-click any item to open its contextual
menu.

Control-click a Dock icon to bring up its menu.

Ô-Option-click a Dock icon to switch to that
application and hide every other window.

Customizing
Windows for Your
Convenience
T
he Finder window is the basic currency of the operating system. You
use the Finder to access applications and files, move items around,
organize your data, and much, much more. Hence, customizing your
Finder windows is crucial to more productively using your Mac.
In this technique, we start by covering the three view modes that you
can use in your Finder windows: icon, list, and column, each of which has
its own benefits. Then we show you how to customize the window’s
appearance and features. We conclude with how to navigate among mul-
tiple open windows.
Understanding the View Modes
The Finder’s window can display the items in a folder in three view
modes: icon, list, and column. Each has its own benefits (and keyboard
shortcuts, see Technique 10), so take some time to figure out which view
mode works best under what circumstances. This is mostly a matter of
taste, but certain principles can help you make the best decision.
To switch among the view modes, use Ô-1 for icon, Ô-2 for list, and
Ô-3 for column. If you have trouble remembering these shortcuts,
they correlate to the order of the icons in the window’s toolbar, from
left to right (as shown in Figure 12-1).
• Figure 12-1: Click the icons to change view modes or use the keyboard shortcuts.

Icon view
Icon view is familiar territory for almost everyone
and is often the default view mode for mounted
CD-ROMs and disk images. Icon view (see Figure
12-2) is best when you’re dealing with a directory
containing only a few items or if you just prefer the
look and feel of icons. Selecting a group of items (by
using the mouse to click and drag) can be an easy
and natural task in icon view.
• Figure 12-2: A directory displayed in icon view mode.
Icon view is limiting if you’re dealing with a directory
containing lots of items or if you’ll be running
through multiple subfolders.
If you’re viewing a directory of images, turn on
Show Icon Preview in the View Options panel
and then use icon view. This displays thumb-
nails of the window’s contents. (After you’ve
selected a window, press Ô-J or choose
View➪Show View Options to bring up the
View Options panel.)
If Snap to Grid is enabled (meaning that icons
are arranged along imaginary grid lines
instead of free-form), icon view shows a small
grid icon in the lower-left corner of the win-
dow (refer to Figure 12-2).
Setting backgrounds in icon view
Icon view mode is the only mode that allows you to cus-
tomize the background of the window. Although this fea-
ture might seem like nothing more than eye candy (and it
certainly can be), it has its advantages. The best way to use
the background is to set a different background color or
image for different folders. That way, when you minimize
them, you can more easily know which window is which by
looking at the window’s icon in the Dock.
This allows you to distinguish between them more easily. To
set a background:
1.
Open the window in question.
2.
Bring up the View Options panel by pressing 
Ô-J or by choosing View➪Show View Options in
the Finder.
3.
Within the View Options panel, select the This
Window Only radio button (at the top) so that
the changes affect only this window.
4.
At the bottom of the window, select either the
Color or the Picture radio button.
5a.
If you select Color in Step 4:
a. Click the color block that appears next to the word
Color to bring up the Colors palette.
b. Click the color that you want to use.
c. Click OK.
You see the window’s background change colors, as in
this figure.

1.
Press Ô-J to bring up the View Options 
(see Figure 12-4).
• Figure 12-4: View Options displays different choices
based on the current view mode.
2.
Use the radio buttons at the top to make these
options apply to this window only or to all 
windows.
To create a default window setting for all your
windows, select All Windows in the View
Options dialog before customizing the 
settings.
3.
Set the icon and text sizes.
The icon and text sizes can be increased to make
up for a high monitor resolution, or these can
both be reduced to make list view windows show
more in a smaller space.
5b.
If you select Picture in Step 4:
a. Click the Select button that appears next to the
word Picture to bring up the Select a Picture dialog.
b. Use the Select a Picture dialog to navigate to the
desired picture.
c. Click Select to close the dialog.
6.
Press Ô-J to close the View Options panel (or
click the little red circle in the upper-left corner).
List view
List view is an easy-to-use-and-understand format for
pretty much any user. It has two primary advantages:

Items are displayed as a sortable list.

Multiple item details are displayed simultane-
ously (see Figure 12-3).
• Figure 12-3: The same directory from Figure 12-2, now in
list view mode.
Because of these considerations, list view is the
obvious choice if you need to sort a folder’s con-
tents or view any information (such as size, modifi-
cation date, kind, creation date, and label). Also, if
you need to compare contents of subfolders, list
view is great because you can show multiple sub-
folders within the one window by expanding them.
This means that you can also select items from mul-
tiple subfolders in the list view.
To get the most out of list view, you must know how
to customize and use the column headings. In an
open window:

Technique 12: Customizing Windows for Your Convenience
96

Comments: Listing an item’s Comments is very,
very useful — if you use comments, that is. If you
don’t (like most users), leave it deselected. You
might use comments to note a text file’s contents
or information about an image.
You can add comments to any item by open-
ing Get Info using the Ô-I keyboard shortcut
or the File menu’s Get Info choice.

Label: Viewing the Labels, like Comments, is
great if you use them. See Technique 11 for infor-
mation on using Labels to your advantage.
After you establish what columns to use, you should
understand these facts:

The default view is to sort the items by name in
ascending order.
You can control the sorting of your files by
adding special characters to a file’s name.
Filenames that begin with a space always
come first; filenames that begin with symbols
always go last. Just don’t start a filename with
a period; it will become hidden if you do.

Click any column heading to sort the list view
contents by that column in ascending order.
Click the same column again to sort the contents
in descending (reverse) order.

You can rearrange the columns by dragging
them, except for the Name column, which is
always in view and is always listed first.
The quickest way to see a long filename
(which can be cut off in list and column view
modes) is to hover the cursor over the file-
name. After a brief moment, the file’s full
name appears. To make it appear immediately,
hold down the Option key while you hover
the cursor above the file (see Figure 12-5).
4.
Select which columns you want list view to
show.
See the guidelines that follow this step list for
more information.
5.
Press Ô-J to close the View Options dialog
(or click the little red circle in the upper-left
corner).
Here are some good rules for what you might want
to include in list view:

Date Modified: The Date Modified option is most
useful for sorting your windows by modification
date. Doing so brings the most recently altered
file to the top.

Date Created: The Date Created option is slightly
less useful than the Date Modified option but
works the same way.

Size: The Size value is quite handy, particularly if
you’re looking for small (such as text docu-
ments) or large (like Photoshop files) items. This
column can also be used to help you distinguish
between multiple versions of the same file.
Sizes aren’t calculated for folders unless the
Calculate All Sizes check box is enabled in the
View Options panel. Keep in mind that large
directories take some time to calculate, so
those values don’t immediately appear in a
window.

Kind: The Kind attribute of the list view is rarely
illuminating. The information that it lists (for
example, Folder, Microsoft Word document, TIFF
document) can normally be ascertained by the
item’s name and icon. It does, however, allow
you to sort by the file’s type.

Version: Frankly, we haven’t turned on a win-
dow’s Version option in years. We can’t imagine
why you would, either.

Customizing Windows
97
• Figure 12-5: You can view a file’s full name by hovering
your cursor above it.
Column view
Column view mode is unique:

It shows a list of a folder’s contents, like the list
view, but without any extra details. 

Column view opens subfolders in columns.
(Opening a folder moves you one column to the
right; closing a folder moves you one column to
the left.)
For these reasons, column view mode is the fastest
for quickly navigating through multiple directories.
You can even set the Finder to use column view
mode by default by enabling the appropriate check
box in the Finder preferences panel.
To save space in column view mode, disable
Show Icons in the View Options panel.
The trick to using column view mode is knowing
how to change the column sizes. By adjusting the
size, you can fit more columns on the screen or
show more of an item’s name. Here are some tips:

Click and drag the bottom-right corner of a win-
dow to expand it.

Click and drag the two vertical lines separating
columns to adjust one column’s width. The col-
umn to the left of the vertical lines is resized.

To adjust every column’s width, hold down the
Option key while clicking and dragging any two
vertical lines.
One of the best benefits of column view is
that it previews different file types for you. You
can use it to view images, listen to sounds, and
play movies, as shown in Figure 12-6. You can
enable or disable this feature by using the
View Options panel.
• Figure 12-6: Column view mode can show an image or a
movie or play a sound.
Scrolling through columns
Many mice and trackballs these days include a scroll wheel.
If you have one and use it, you’re probably aware that you
can use it to move up and down within documents, Web
pages, even Finder windows. What many people aren’t
aware of is that by pressing the Shift key while scrolling, the
movement goes from being vertical to being horizontal.
Scrolling horizontally through the column view windows
can be the fastest way to access deeply nested folders.
Customizing Windows
Aside from choosing which view mode you use, you
can customize the Finder’s windows in many other
ways. The view modes themselves customize the
window’s content area, but you can also customize
the toolbar along the top, the Sidebar along the side
(appropriately enough), and even tinker with how
the scroll bars appear and function for larger 
windows.

Technique 12: Customizing Windows for Your Convenience
98
• Figure 12-8: The Customize Toolbar sheet.
The best way to customize the toolbar depends on
how you use it:

Some options — Get Info, iDisk, Connect, and
Customize — are rarely used and can be 
omitted. 

Burn and Eject are also options in the Sidebar if
you have volumes mounted there. 

Almost all the icons have keyboard equivalents
or can be re-created by Control-clicking.
Here are some other toolbar tips and shortcuts to be
aware of:

If your window becomes too small to show all
the toolbar features, double arrows appear. Click
them to see the hidden options (see Figure 12-9).

Click the oval button in the upper-right corner of
the toolbar to switch between a fancy Tiger win-
dow and a plain version. Strangely enough, you
can also use Shift-click, Control-click, or Option-
click to do the same thing.
Toolbar
The toolbar along the top of the window has been
around and customizable for a while now. Panther
added to it by adding the Action pop-up (which is
just another way to access contextual menus, see
Technique 14) and the Search box, both of which are
still present. To customize the toolbar:
1.
Control-click the toolbar (see Figure 12-7).
• Figure 12-7: Control-click the toolbar to customize it.
2.
Select Customize Toolbar from the contextual
menu that appears.
This is the equivalent of selecting Customize
Toolbar from the View menu in the Finder. A
Customize Toolbar sheet appears.
3.
Add items to the toolbar by dragging them
from the sheet to their desired location on the
toolbar (see Figure 12-8).
4.
Remove items from the toolbar by dragging
them off the window.
5.
Use the pop-up menu and check box at the bot-
tom of the window to dictate 
 How much information should be shown in
the toolbar (Icon & Text, Icon Only, or Text
Only).
 Whether it should be in small size.

Customizing Windows
99
• Figure 12-9: The double arrows create a menu of hidden
toolbar options.

Ô-clicking the oval button toggles among very
subtly different versions of the window.

You can also access the Path by Ô-clicking the
window’s name in the title bar. A folder’s path
indicates where the folder is on the hard drive,
like /Users/larry/Desktop/Stuff.
Ô-clicking the window’s name is a good trick
to remember. Many other applications also
use this technique to show you the file path
(BBEdit) or your browser’s history (Safari).

Hold down the Ô key while clicking and dragging
to move or remove toolbar items without using
the Customize Toolbar panel.

Drag any icon from the Desktop or a Finder win-
dow to add it to the toolbar.

Control-click the toolbar to switch view modes.
Control-click a toolbar icon or tool to remove 
it — or just Ô-drag it off.
You can add a Delete button to the toolbar so
that you can delete a file by selecting it and
then clicking Delete. You can also trash a file
by dropping it on the toolbar’s Delete button.
Sidebar
The Sidebar (see Figure 12-10) contains two separate
parts. The top section lists major resources, such as
volumes, mounted disk images, and discs. This can
be customized under the Sidebar panel of the
Finder’s preferences panel. Anything listed in the
Sidebar can be accessed with a single mouse click.
(These items don’t need to be opened with a double
click.)
• Figure 12-10: The side panel on the left of the window is
new to Panther and is customizable.
Resize the Sidebar width by clicking and drag-
ging the dividing line between it and the win-
dow’s contents. If you make the sidebar really
small, you can see only the icons, but you can
see each item’s full name by hovering the
mouse over the icon.

Technique 12: Customizing Windows for Your Convenience
100
The contents of the Sidebar also appear in
Open/Save dialogs, thus saving you time navi-
gating around the computer.
The bottom section of the Sidebar is partially cus-
tomizable from the Finder’s preferences panel. This
area should be used to access frequently used direc-
tories, such as

The Desktop

Your Home folder

The Applications folder

Your Documents folder
Select any object and press Ô-T to instantly add it to
your Sidebar. Similarly, you can drag an item to the
Sidebar to add it or drag it off to remove it. Sidebar
items can also be rearranged by clicking and drag-
ging them.
The Ô-T shortcut used to add an item to your
Favorites directory but now adds items to the
Sidebar. There is no longer a shortcut to add
items to the Favorites directory.
Scroll bars
Scroll bars appear on the right side and/or bottom of
the window when the window is too small to display
every item. These settings are adjusted in the
Appearance panel of System Preferences (see Fig-
ure 12-11). You can customize the scroll arrows to
appear like the following:
• Figure 12-11: Part of the Appearance panel also controls
the Finder window scroll bars.
Here are some things that you can do in the top part
of the Sidebar:

Easily access any hard drive.

Access your iDisk without formally connecting to
it. (We cover iDisk in Technique 42.)

View mounted disk images and discs without
going to the Desktop.

Eject mounted disk images and discs.

Burn CD-Rs and DVD-Rs.

See what servers you’re currently connected to.
Using the window’s icon to move folders
In the title bar of a window, the folder icon that appears
next to the window’s name is the listed folder’s icon (also
called the proxy icon). Therefore, this icon is the same as
the icon for the directory that you would find in its parent
folder. By clicking and holding the window’s icon, you can
move this entire directory around without going up one
folder. For example:
1.
Open two different folders in two different win-
dows in the Finder.
2.
Click and hold the title bar icon of the folder 
that you want to move.
You need to click and hold for just a second to get 
the system to engage.
3.
Drag this icon into the other window.
4.
Release the mouse button.
You now see the first window as a subdirectory in the sec-
ond. However, the first window is still open; only its location
has changed.
Proxy icons are also in other applications (for example,
Word documents have an icon next to the document’s
name) and are a useful concept to familiarize yourself with.
You can find other examples in this book where using the
proxy icon might be the easiest way to move a document
(such as attaching a file to an e-mail).

Moving Windows Around
101

Separate, at the top and bottom of the window

Together at the bottom of the window
While you’re at it, you can tweak how clicking in the
scroll bar area affects the window or document.
Select one of the following radio buttons:

Jump to the Next Page: Moves a page at a time.

Jump to Here: Moves to a particular location.
Both of these settings are more for personal taste
than anything, but you should understand what
you’re getting when you make your selections. (For
the record, we tend to keep our scroll bars together
and set clicking in the scroll bar to move one page at
a time.)
If you install the free TinkerTool (see
Technique 54), you have even more scroll bar
options, including having both together at the
top and bottom of the window.
The last two settings that you can enable are 

Smooth scrolling: It makes your scrolling look
pretty, but it really drags down your Mac’s per-
formance. Turn off smooth scrolling for a faster
window response.

Double-clicking windows to minimize them: It’s
handy, but you can also minimize a window by
either
 Single-clicking the yellow button 
 Using Ô-M
Moving Windows Around
Despite the fact that Exposé (see Technique 15) has
greatly facilitated moving about open windows,
plenty of other tips and tricks are still left to be dis-
covered. Window management is critical to using the
operating system efficiently, particularly if you open
every folder in a new window. Here are the best tips:

Finder windows use three standard buttons in
the upper-left corner. They are color-coordinated
to represent what they do: red (close), yellow
(minimize), and green (zoom).

Option-click the yellow button to minimize every
open window.

Option-click the red button to close every open
window.

If you place the mouse cursor over an inactive
window’s buttons, they light up, allowing you to
close, minimize, or zoom a window without it
being in front (and therefore active).

You can move background (non-active) windows
by holding down the Ô key and clicking them
with the mouse.

Double-click the toolbar to minimize a window, if
enabled.
The Appearance panel allows you to turn on
the window-minimizing feature when double-
clicking the window’s title bar or toolbar.

You can directly access any particular window
by clicking Window on the menu bar and select-
ing from the list of windows.

The shortcut Ô-~ scrolls you forward through
the open windows. Ô-Shift-~ rotates you 
backward.

Minimized windows are stored in the right side
of the Dock.

By placing your cursor over a window’s Dock
icon, you can see the name of the window (see
Figure 12-12).
• Figure 12-12: A window’s title reveals itself when you
hover over its icon in the Dock.

Establishing an

T
he Dock, that curious little bar at the bottom of your screen, is
such a particular aspect of your operating system that it merits its
own technique. A new concept to Mac OS X, the Dock has been
much maligned in its various incarnations, but we feel that with the right
treatment, the Dock can be an important ally in the war for productivity.
We begin this technique with a discussion on customizing and organizing
the Dock, with the focus on making it as useful as possible. Then we
demonstrate the myriad ways that mouse and keyboard shortcuts can be
used to work with the Dock more efficiently. Finally, we introduce a cou-
ple of the more popular shareware applications that add to or mimic the
Dock’s purpose and behavior.
Customizing the Dock
The Dock is like a pet: You need to take care of it. Okay, it’s really nothing
like a pet, but you should still spend a bit of time doing two things: cus-
tomizing its behavior and organizing its contents and layout. You can
customize the Dock’s behavior from the Dock pane of System Preferences
(see Figure 13-1).
• Figure 13-1: Use the Dock System Preferences pane to set the Dock’s behavior.
13
Technique

Customizing the Dock
103
You can adjust much of the Dock’s behavior
from the Dock submenu of the Apple Menu
(see Figure 13-2). It gives you immediate access
to the Dock preferences panel without forcing
you to navigate through System Preferences.
• Figure 13-2: The Dock submenu is located under the
Apple menu.
You can adjust the following Dock properties, some
of which are just cosmetic and some of which are
actually useful:

Size

Magnification (whether it’s on and how potent 
it is)

Position on the screen (left, bottom, or right)

The effect used when windows and documents
are minimized into the Dock (Genie and Scale are
your choices)

Whether opening applications are animated

Whether the Dock automatically hides and
shows itself
The size, position, and hiding features of the Dock
all directly relate to how you interact with your
computer — and therefore, can have an effect on
your productivity. That being said, how you set
them is largely a matter of taste. Here are some gen-
eral suggestions:

Automatically hiding and showing the Dock is a
good way to keep your screen clear if you have a
smaller monitor (15 inches or less) or a laptop.

Placing the Dock on the side makes more sense if
you have a widescreen display (where you have
more screen space on the sides than you do on
the top and bottom).

If you use the Desktop a lot and have folders, vol-
umes, and other icons automatically arranged
(meaning that they’re located on the right side of
the screen), don’t put the Dock on the right, or
it’ll always be in the way.

Adjust the size of the Dock so that it’s as small as
reasonable while still allowing you to read it.
The Dock’s size automatically shrinks if the
number of items in the Dock makes it too
large to fit on-screen. In System Preferences,
you can also make the Dock really small, but
use magnification to see the items more
clearly (see Figure 13-3).
• Figure 13-3: Magnification increases an icon’s size as your
mouse goes over it.
The minimizing effect, the animation of opening
applications, and (to a lesser degree) the magnifica-
tion are cosmetic. Turn them on to impress or annoy
your friends; turn them off if you think it’ll make
things happen faster (though it really won’t).
The TinkerTool freeware application (www.
bresink.de/osx/TinkerTool.html) lets you
customize your Dock in other ways. This
includes positioning the Dock at the top of the
screen, adjusting the alignment (left/top, cen-
ter, right/bottom), making the Dock icons for
hidden applications transparent, and adding a
Dock shadow. It also adds a “Suck In” minimize
effect for people who appreciate eye candy.

Technique 13: Establishing an Efficient Dock
104
3.
Add frequently accessed folders to the right
side of the Dock by dragging their icons from
the Finder onto the Dock.
We recommend putting your Favorites folder
(which links applications and files that you use
less frequently), your Home folder, and perhaps
your Documents folder on the right side of the
Dock. You should also consider dragging the
folders for your current projects and documents
there. If you want, add the Desktop folder there
to immediately access Desktop items.
Use customized icons for your Dock folders
(before adding them to the Dock) to help you
find a desired folder among multiple folders
stored there. See Technique 17 for instructions
and resources.
4.
Organize your applications so that those used
in conjunction are placed together.
For example, if you regularly use multiple Web
browsers, place these next to each other. If you
use BBEdit (a text editor) with Fetch or Transmit
(FTP applications), line them up.
Icons placed in the center of the Dock are the
most stable because they’re less affected by the
expansion and contraction of the Dock. As your
Dock grows, applications found near the center
of your Dock remain near the center of your
screen. Conversely, items on the ends of the
Dock move closer and closer to the end of the
screen, making them slightly harder to get to.
Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts
for the Dock
To get the most out of the Dock, you must be able to
customize it properly and also use it with ease. This
comes down to understanding the various keyboard
and mouse shortcuts that you can use to perform
common tasks.
With your mouse (or other input device), here are
the basics that you should know:
Organizing the Dock
The Dock is divided into two sections: the left side
(where applications live) and the right side (where
you can find documents, folders, and the Trash).
The two sides are divided by a separator bar (a verti-
cal line that runs the height of the Dock).

To add any item to the Dock, drag its icon there. 

To remove any item (except the Finder and the
Trash, which are permanent), drag its icon off
the Dock. 
The Dock always shows every icon that you add to it
as well as other currently running applications
(which are marked with an upward-pointing black
triangle; refer to Figure 13-3).
Technique 2 shows you a trick for making the
System Preferences panels more accessible:
just add the System Preferences to your Login
Items. Then you can Control-click the System
Preferences Dock icon to access an individual
control.
To organize your Dock:
1.
Remove any of the default icons that you won’t
regularly use; just click and drag them off the
Dock.
Apple likes to give you immediate access to
every Apple application that comes installed on
your Mac, so your Dock has iMovie, iPhoto, iCal,
Mail, and the Address Book by default. If you
don’t frequently use some of these (like iMovie),
drag the icon off the Dock to make it disappear in
a puff of smoke.
You can’t remove two particular Dock icons: the
Finder, which is always on the far left (or the
top, if the Dock is on the side); and the Trash,
which is always on the far right (or bottom).
2.
Add every application that you use on a daily
basis to the left side of the Dock by dragging
their icons from the Finder onto the Dock.

Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts for the Dock
105

Click any application’s icon to bring that applica-
tion to the front.

Click any folder’s icon to show that folder in a
Finder window.

Click the Trash icon to see what’s in the garbage.
Hierarchical pop-up menus in the Dock
Clicking an icon in the Dock takes you to that application,
but clicking folders in the Dock can give you different
behavior. Both of these features are quite useful and an
easy way to access your documents:

When you click a folder’s icon, that directory is 
opened in a new Finder window.

When you Control-click or click and hold a folder’s
icon, a hierarchical menu is created of the folder’s 
contents, as shown in the following figure.
This method allows you to navigate directly to a sub-
folder or document buried deep inside — the hierar-
chy of folders is revealed while you navigate. In
previous versions of Mac OS X, you were limited to
only a handful of submenus, but now you can literally
fill your screen up with menus to reach the file that
you want, as shown in the following figure.

Click a Dock item to make that item active, open
it if it isn’t already open, and reshow minimized
documents or windows.

Click and hold a Dock icon to bring up its contex-
tual menu (or a hierarchical menu for a folder).

Use the contextual menu to quit, hide, and go to
the item’s location in the Finder.

Check the contextual menus for different applica-
tions to see what options they provide.
For example, the Mail application gives you the
option to check your e-mail (see Figure 13-4).
Many others, such as BBEdit or Safari, allow you
to preselect which open document (in that appli-
cation) you want to view (see Figure 13-5).
• Figure 13-4: The Mail contextual menu in the Dock.
• Figure 13-5: The Safari contextual menu in the Dock
shows open Web pages.

Click and drag the Dock’s separator up and down
to adjust the Dock’s size.

You can eject disk images, CDs, DVDs, floppy
disks, Zip disks, and external hard drives by
dragging their icons onto the Trash icon, which
turns into an Eject button.

Technique 13: Establishing an Efficient Dock
106
• Figure 13-7: Use the up- and down-arrow keys to
navigate the contextual menus in the Dock.
To empty the Trash by using the Dock and
your mouse, click and hold (or Control-click)
the Dock’s Trash icon and then choose Empty
Trash from the menu that appears.

Ô-Option-click a Dock icon to hide all the other
applications.

Ô-click a Dock icon to reveal the icon’s original
file in the Finder. This is the same as selecting
Show In Finder from the contextual menu.
You can also control many of the Dock’s settings by
using your input device and the modifier keys. For
starters:

Control-click the Dock separator (the line between
the left and right sides of the Dock) to access the
Dock’s preferences (see Figure 13-8).

Press Option-click while dragging the Dock sepa-
rator to change the Dock’s size to standard icon
sizes.

Pressing Ô-Shift-click while dragging the Dock’s
separator bar left and right allows you to move
the Dock around the screen (from left to bottom
to right).
When using only the keyboard, you’re fairly limited
by what you can do with the Dock, but to start
1.
Make sure that Full Keyboard Access is turned
on for All controls in the Keyboard & Mouse
panel of System Preferences (under Keyboard
Shortcuts).
2.
Press Control-F3 to access the Dock (see 
Figure 13-6).
• Figure 13-6: Pressing Control-F3 highlights an icon in the
Dock.
Laptops might need fn-Control-F3 to access
the Dock.
3.
Use the arrow keys to move left and right (you
can also Tab and Shift-Tab).
4.
After an item is highlighted, press the spacebar
to make it active.
5.
Use the up- or down-arrow keys to launch the
contextual menu for that item (see Figure 13-7).
6.
Press Return to select an option highlighted in
the contextual menu.
7.
Press Esc at any time to leave the Dock.
Another keyboard shortcut to remember is
pressing Ô-Option-D to show or hide the Dock.
What you can do with the mouse — or the mouse
and keyboard together — is much more impressive:

Control-click a Dock icon to bring up its contex-
tual menu. You can also just click and hold to 
see it.

Option-Control-click to change the contextual
menu’s Quit option to Force Quit.

Shareware for the Dock
107
• Figure 13-8: You can adjust the Dock’s preferences from
the Dock’s contextual menu.

An application’s contextual menu allows you to
add the item to the Dock. You can also accom-
plish this by moving a Dock icon, which makes it
a permanent addition.
You can open a file by dragging it onto an
application’s icon in the Dock. The problem is
that the Dock might mistake your intentions
and frequently move the application icon out
of the way so that the file can be added to the
Dock. To make the Dock behave itself, hold
down the Ô key when dragging the file. To
force an application to attempt to open a file,
use Ô-Option while you’re dragging the file
onto the Dock icon.
Shareware for the Dock
After you get the hang of the Dock, investigate some
of the shareware applications that either add to its
functionality or otherwise duplicate its utility.
The following programs provide you with multiple
Docks. They either create separately accessible
Docks or one tabbed Dock (one Dock with multiple
subpanels, each of which can contain its own items):

DragThing (www.dragthing.com, $25) is a very
popular application and consistently reviewed
well by Mac users.

Drop Drawers (www.sigsoftware.com/
dropdrawers, $20) has an extra emphasis on
storing stuff (text, images, and the like) in a Dock
drawer.

DockSwap (www.pidog.com/OSX, $12 suggested)
allows you to have multiple Docks, switching
easily among them.
Launcher programs can quickly bring up applica-
tions, Web pages, and contextual menus. These can
be a dockling, pop-up menu, or menu bar extension:

Snard (www.gideonsoftworks.com/snard.html,
$10) is a pop-up menu that gives you quick
access to just about anything on your Mac. It’s a
very unique utility, releasing you from the con-
fines of a Dock-centric world.

DockExtender (www.codetek.com/dockextender,
$20) is highly customizable, taking the functional-
ity of the Dock to universally-accessible pop-up
menus.
A dockling is a special type of application that
resides in the Dock and adds extra functionality
to your computer. Unlike other Dock items, you
never really use it as a standalone application.

ClearDock (http://unsanity.com/products/
free, free) by Unsanity lets you customize the
Dock on a more aesthetic level. You can 
 Entirely get rid of the Dock’s background 
(letting your Desktop show through). 
 Change the color of the triangles that appear
below open applications.

A-Dock X (http://jerome.foucher.free.fr/
ADockX/ADockX.html, $10) provides both func-
tional and cosmetic alterations to the Dock. With
it you can use different themes for your Docks or
alternative Trash icons (there are more features,
too, but we like the occasional eye-candy).

Saving Steps with
Contextual Menus
C
ontextual menus have been part of the Macintosh operating system
for several incarnations now, yet many Mac owners underuse them
or don’t use them at all. Contextual menus provide an immediate
listing of options; usually frequently performed tasks such as invoking
Get Info, changing a label, or making a copy. Although contextual menus
exist in both applications and the Finder, they differ greatly across appli-
cations. Therefore, this technique specifically addresses the Finder’s con-
textual menus (often abbreviated as just CMs).
First, we cover a smattering of the basics about contextual menus. Then
we cover, in greater detail, some of the specific contextual menu items
that you can add to your system. These include many common third-
party and shareware applications. Finally, you see how AppleScripts, 
oh-so-wonderful AppleScripts, can be called by using CMs.
Grasping the Basics of Contextual Menus
When you Control-click an item, whether it’s a window, the Desktop, or
an icon, a contextual menu appears, listing the things that you can do
with that item. Different objects in your system offer different options.
For example, here are the CMs for a folder (Figure 14-1), a file (Figure
14-2), and a window. (A window’s CM can be accessed by clicking on its
background, as shown in Figure 14-3.)
If you use contextual menus a lot — and you really should — and you
have a programmable input device (such as a trackball or mouse),
you must program one of the buttons to act as a Control-click. Doing
so saves countless hours because you can access common features
more easily. In fact, most two-button mice treat the right button as
Control-click by default.

• Figure 14-1: A contextual menu for a folder.
• Figure 14-2: A contextual menu for a file.
• Figure 14-3: The default contextual menu for a window.
The Help and Get Info options are common to all
three of the listed CM examples. A window has the
fewest number of options, by default, whereas files
generally give you the most. Some common uses of
the contextual menu include

Creating a new folder within a directory, in case
you get tripped up with the Ô-Shift-N shortcut.

Adding, deleting, or changing the Label.

Sending the selected item to the Trash.

Opening a file with a specific application (see
Technique 25).

Archiving an item.

Duplicating or just copying the item.

Creating an alias.
If you want to know what CM options are
available to you in any application, including
the Finder, Control-click to investigate. Get in
the habit of Control-clicking within windows,
on icons, on the toolbar of windows, and on
Dock icons.

functionality that allows you to open a file with
an application other than the default application.
It takes this principle a small step further by
allowing you to 
 Set applications, such as Preview, Photoshop,
or BBEdit, to always appear
 Prevent selected applications from ever
appearing as an option
 Disable Classic applications as an option if
Classic isn’t open

The DesktopPictureCM tool from Azine Software
(www.azinesoftware.com/other.php, free) sets a

having to go through System Preferences.

QuickAccessCM from Abra Code (http://free.
abracode.com/cmworkshop, free) grants you
immediate access to commonly used folders (see
Figure 14-4), files, and even applications. With it,
you can move, copy, or even make an alias of a
selected item in another directory.
• Figure 14-4: The QuickAccess contextual menu provides,
um, quick access to folders.
Items in the Dock and the Dock itself have their
own contextual menus. To see a menu, Control-
click a Dock icon or Control-click the Dock. (The
menu differs depending on whether you click
the Dock separator or in a blank area.)
Opening your packages
If you’re a techie user, a contextual menu allows you to view
the contents of packages (special bundles of information pre-
sented as one cohesive item). These are used frequently in
Mac OS X, but you can view a package’s contents only in the
Terminal unless you use the Show Package Contents CM.

Control-click a file with the .pkg extension to
bring up the file’s contextual menu.
2.
Choose Show Package Contents from the CM.
3.
A window of the package’s contents appears. In
it, you commonly find
 Two text (XML) files that store version and other
information about the package
 An archive file
 A resources directory
These files can then be examined, copied, or (if you know
what you’re doing) modified. This concept isn’t unlike using
a resource editor like ResEdit back in earlier versions of
Mac OS.
As you explore this concept, you’ll notice that the /Library/
Receipts folder tracks what was installed by creating pack-
ages. Also, many installers come in a package form. Even
most of Tiger’s default applications, like Mail, are packages
whose contents can be viewed.
Using CMs with Third-Party
Applications
Many third-party applications, including commercial
apps, shareware, and freeware, take advantage of
Tiger’s contextual menus. Here are a few of the best:

OnMyCommandCM, also from Abra Code
(http://free.abracode.com/cmworkshop, free),
lets you invoke UNIX commands (like those
you’d type in the Terminal) or AppleScripts from
a contextual menu. It’s a must-have for power
Mac users!
Abra Code provides a slew of handy contextual
menu scripts. They’re all free and available at

FinderIconCM (www.pixture.com/macosx.php,
free) is the fastest way to change icons, saving
you lots of Get Info’s, copies, and pastes. In
Technique 17, you see how to use this to quickly
change an item’s icon.

StuffIt Deluxe (www.stuffit.com, $80) comes
with several contextual menu options. The popu-
lar utility (see Figure 14-5), whose main use is for
compressing and decompressing files and fold-
ers, creates CM tools to immediately archive or
open pretty much anything. You can also access
the StuffIt preferences through the CM and use
sequential tools such as Archive and Mail.
• Figure 14-5: StuffIt adds many useful items to the
contextual menus.

StickyBrain (www.chronosnet.com, $40 or poten-
tially free with .Mac) is the Stickies application on
steroids, providing you with an amazing asset for
managing information. This application creates
contextual menus that incorporate StickyBrain
into nearly any other application. See Technique

link so that you can search Dictionary.com,
Thesaurus.com, Google, and other sites for
words you select.
Search Google or www.versiontracker.com
for more contextual menu applications that
you can use.
Almost all of these applications come with their own
installers. After installation, log out and log back in
to take advantage of your new contextual menus. To
save time, install a number of contextual menus at
once, then log out and log back in (rather than log-
ging out after each installation).
AppleScript, Contextual 
Menus, and You
A special subsection of contextual menus exists
thanks to AppleScript. Without too much work, you
can trigger (or run) AppleScripts from contextual
menus.
You can also invoke Workflows you’ve created
with Automator through contextual menus.
See Technique 61 for an introduction to this
great application, examples of how to use it,
and instructions for making your work there
CM-accessible.

Which options you see depend on what’s selected
when the contextual menu is brought up. (Hence the
name contextual menu.) To install and use Big Cat:
1.
Download the latest version of Big Cat from
http://ranchero.com/bigcat.
2.
Double-click the downloaded file, called some-
thing like BigCat1.0.sit, to open it.
3.
Open the resulting folder, called something
like Big Cat 1.0.
The contents should resemble Figure 14-8.
• Figure 14-8: The contents of the Big Cat folder.
AppleScript for the uninitiated
AppleScript is a programming tool for the Mac. Because it’s
very easy to use but still powerful, it’s remained a popular
application over the years. 
Apple has a vast supply of ready-made AppleScripts avail-
able for download. They’re organized by application at www.
apple.com/applescript/apps.
For more juicy AppleScript details, pick up a copy of
AppleScript For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Tom Trinko (pub-
lished by Wiley).
Big Cat, created by Ranchero Software (www.
ranchero.com), is a free application that adds the
ability to run AppleScripts from contextual menus.
Big Cat creates two separate categories of scripts:

Text: For example, you can copy, open a selec-
tion in TextEdit, or search with Google (see
Figure 14-6).
• Figure 14-6: Big Cat’s textual tools.

Files: These include scripts such as Copy Path
and Make Alias on Desktop (see Figure 14-7).

Move the Big Cat Scripts folder to ~/Library/
Application Support, where ~ refers to your
Home directory.
5.
Move the file BigCat.plugin to the ~/Library/
Contextual Menu Items folder, again where ~
refers to your Home directory.
If you don’t already have an Application
Support or a Contextual Menu Items folder
in your Library directory, create one (using the
exact same spelling, capitalization, and spacing).
6.
Log out of your computer and then log back in.
In this case, you can’t use Fast User Switching to
log out because that doesn’t close your session.
7.
When you log back in, you should now have
the Big Cat options listed under Scripts when
invoking contextual menus.
8.
To install your own AppleScripts to use through
Big Cat, drop them into the text or file sub-
folder of the ~/Library/Application Support
directory (see Figure 14-9).
• Figure 14-9: You can add any AppleScripts that you want
to the appropriate Files or Text folder.

Easily Managing
Windows with
Exposé
N
ew in Panther and added to in Tiger is a window management sys-
tem called Exposé. Exposé allows you to access and switch among
open windows either throughout the entire operating system or
just in the current application. It also gives you immediate access to the
Desktop.
In this technique, we introduce you to Dashboard & Exposé and all the
benefits that it has to offer. We also show the default mouse and key-
board shortcuts for using Exposé and how you can alter these. Then we
demonstrate a few techniques that you can use, thanks to Exposé.
Knowing how to switch documents within an active application, how to
drag and drop files more quickly, and how to use Exposé without the
mouse goes a long way toward helping you speed through routine tasks.
Finally, we introduce you to the Dashboard, a new feature in Tiger.
Introducing Exposé
You enable and control Exposé from the Dashboard & Exposé panel,
which is found under the Personal section of System Preferences.
1.
Open System Preferences by going to the Apple menu or by clicking
its icon in the Dock.
2.
Click the Dashboard & Exposé icon.
The Dashboard & Exposé pane appears (see Figure 15-1).
3.
Set the corner activation settings for Exposé.
Exposé, like a screen saver, can use a feature called hot corners. Hot
corners are just the corners of your screen that have been assigned
special meaning. Moving the cursor into a certain corner activates a
function; moving it out of the corner deactivates that function. For
example, if you’re in Safari, moving into one corner might reveal the
Desktop. When you move the cursor back out, Safari is revealed again.
Before you can use any hot corner, though, you need to assign func-
tions to them in the Exposé pane.
15
Technique

Introducing Exposé
115
• Figure 15-1: The Dashboard & Exposé pane.
The pop-up menus in this pane correspond to
their positions on-screen. In other words, the
upper-left pop-up menu controls the upper-
left corner of your screen, and so on.
 You can set one corner to show every open
window (All Windows).
 You can set another corner to reveal every
open window for the currently active applica-
tion (Application Windows).
 You can set another corner to access the
Desktop (Desktop).
 You can set another corner to start your
screen saver.
 You can set another corner — you’re at five
corners now, so you need to start making
choices — to disable the screen saver.
 You can have a corner do nothing whatsoever
(just, you know, sit in the corner).
4.
Use the pop-up menus in the Keyboard section
to set your function keys to also perform cer-
tain Exposé- and Screen Saver–related tasks.
The Exposé pane also allows you to set hot
corners to start and disable the screen saver.
These controls are duplicated — even for
Exposé — under the Desktop & Screen Saver
System Preferences.
You might find all these options intimidating. Here
are our best rules for customizing Exposé:

You might want to skip setting a Desktop short-
cut in Exposé because you can also access the
Desktop by clicking it or by clicking the Finder
icon in the Dock.

Because the All Windows and Application
Windows features are very similar, place the hot
corners on the same side of the screen and use
contiguous function keys for them.

If your function keys aren’t readily accessible (or,
as with laptops, require the use of the fn key to
work), avoid setting the function key shortcuts
or otherwise ignore them.

If your function keys are already being used for
other purposes, skip setting the function keys
and just use the hot corners instead.

If your function keys are already being used for
other purposes, you can add a modifier key to
the keyboard shortcut by holding down the 
Shift, Ô, Option, or Control key while you select
the corresponding function key (see Figure 15-2).

Multiple displays (see Technique 8) probably
still only have four corners, even though it might
seem that you physically have eight.
Strange as it might seem, some multiple dis-
plays might have five or more screen corners.
If the two displays aren’t aligned exactly, there
can be an extra corner or two between the
two displays, as shown in Figure 15-3. This
isn’t necessarily a problem or an asset but just
a curiosity to be aware of.

Technique 15: Easily Managing Windows with Exposé
116

If you have a multi-button input device, you can
set the extra buttons to trigger Exposé, with or
without modifier keys (see Figure 15-4).
• Figure 15-4: You can set modifier keys and extra mouse
buttons to use Exposé.
The most natural way to trigger Exposé is
probably to use the hot corners with the
mouse. For many people, the function 
keys aren’t as easy to access and use as the
mouse is.
Getting the Most out of Exposé
After you get Exposé set up the way you want it, you
need to know how to get the most out of its poten-
tial. Aside from revealing the Desktop, Exposé either
displays all the open windows (including Finder win-
dows, Web browser windows, and documents) or all
the open windows for the current application. Here
are the basics for using Exposé.
• Figure 15-2: You can also trigger Exposé by using the
function keys and a modifier key (or keys).
• Figure 15-3: The arrangement of your displays dictates
how many corners your system has.

If you have a Mac with a small display (such as
an iBook or the 12-inch PowerBook), you might
find the hot corners a nuisance. They tend to
cause funny Exposé things when your cursor
(even accidentally) nears a corner.

Getting the Most out of Exposé
117
To switch to a different document within the current
application:
1.
Depending on how you’ve set your System
Preferences, press the keyboard shortcut, use
the mouse shortcut, or move your cursor to the
hot corner to bring up all the open windows for
the current application (see Figure 15-5).
• Figure 15-5: The Exposé display for the active application.
2.
Place your cursor over each window (the rest
of the screen will be dark) to view its title. (See
the middle image of Figure 15-6.)
• Figure 15-6: Exposé shows a window or document’s title
when you hover the mouse over it.
Exposé shows only open windows and docu-
ments. Minimized windows and documents
are never revealed.
3.
Click the desired window to make it active.
You can always press Esc to leave Exposé with-
out switching windows or applications.
To switch to a document in another application:
1.
By using the keyboard shortcut, the mouse
shortcut, or the hot corner, bring up all the
open windows.
Check out the party in Figure 15-7 (and that’s not
even a particularly busy day).
• Figure 15-7: The Exposé display for every open
application.
2.
Place your cursor over each window (the rest
of the screen will be dark) to view its title.
3.
Click the appropriate window to make it active.
This tip’s just too cool for school: After you use
Exposé to show all the open windows and
documents, you can access all the windows or
documents for specific (open) applications by

Technique 15: Easily Managing Windows with Exposé
118
2.
Begin dragging the selected item by clicking
with the mouse and moving your cursor
slightly.
3.
While continuing to hold down the mouse but-
ton, use Exposé to show either all the currently
open windows or all the open windows for the
current application.
Do so by moving the cursor into the correct hot
corner or by pressing the associated keyboard
shortcut to engage Exposé.
4.
While continuing to hold down the mouse but-
ton, select the appropriate window or docu-
ment by moving the cursor over it (see the
lower-left corner of Figure 15-9).
• Figure 15-9: To add an attachment to an e-mail, select
the e-mail’s image by hovering over it.
5.
While (still!) continuing to hold down the
mouse button, activate the highlighted window
or document by pressing the spacebar.
Exposé also automatically switches over to a
document or window if you hover the cursor
over it for a couple of moments.
6.
While (of course) continuing to hold down the
mouse button, move the cursor within the win-
dow or document to where you want to drop
the selected item.
pressing the Tab key. The end result is much
like rotating through Exposé’s current applica-
tion listing without actively switching from one
application to another. If you have a lot of clut-
ter or want to view a particular window or doc-
ument in a larger size, this is the way to go.
Dragging and dropping with Exposé
One of the coolest features of Exposé is that you can
use it for drag-and-drop purposes, like when you
want to quickly add an attachment to an e-mail or
copy and paste some text from one application to
another. This might not be obvious on first exposure
(insert groan here), but it’s a really cool technique.
Here’s the skinny:
1.
Select the item or items that you want to drag
and drop (see the 579630 ch14.sit file in
Figure 15-8).
• Figure 15-8: To attach a document to an e-mail, first
select the document in the Finder.
For example, you can select
 A file in the Finder to attach to an e-mail
 Text in an e-mail to drop into BBEdit
 An image in Photoshop to view in your Web
browser
 Text in a Word document to copy into another
Word document
 Files in a Finder window to duplicate or move
to another Finder window

7.
Release the mouse button to complete the drop.

• Figure 15-10: The completed drag-and-drop attaches the
file to the e-mail.
8.
Apply hot and cold compresses to your tired,
aching, mouse-clicking finger as needed.
Using Exposé without the mouse
This technique is for you if you never take your hands
off the keys or if you use the mouse as a toy for your cat.
You can use Exposé without touching the mouse
at all.
1.
In the Exposé panel, make sure that you have
the keyboard shortcuts enabled.
2.
Press the appropriate keyboard shortcut to
launch Exposé.
By default this is
 F9 to see all open windows
 F10 to view all the current application’s open
windows (or documents)
 F11 to head to the Desktop
3.
Use the arrow keys to select the window or doc-
ument that you want.
The arrow keys move you around the window
listings as you would expect: left, right, up, and
down.
4.
Press the spacebar to make that window or
document active.
5.
If you brought up all the active windows in
Step 2, you can rotate among the windows of
the different active applications by pressing
Tab. Use the arrow keys to select a window and
the spacebar to make it active.
Dashing to the Dashboard
New to Tiger and Exposé is a whole world called the
Dashboard. The Dashboard gives you one-button
access (the F12 key) to widgets. A widget is a term
referring to a mini-utility designed to do one simple
thing (such as show a clock). People with minimal
skills can write new widgets, which can later be
added to Tiger. Out of the box, Tiger comes with
14 widgets:

Access to your Address Book

• Figure 15-12: The X in the upper-left corner lets you
close (but not delete) a widget.

To change the city setting for the clock
1. Hover your mouse over the clock widget.
2. Click the “i” symbol that appears in the lower-
right corner.
3. Select a continent from the first pop-up menu
(see Figure 15-13).
• Figure 15-13: You can customize some widgets, such as
the world clock.
4. Select a city from the second pop-up menu.
5. Click Done.
As you can see in Figure 15-11, you can have as many
widgets open at once as you want, and often multi-
ple copies of the same widget (for example, there are
two clocks in the image).
• Figure 15-11: The Dashboard has some of its widgets
open.
Besides pressing F12 to get to the Dashboard, here’s
what else you might want to know:

Open a new widget by clicking its name on the
widget bar.

Hover your mouse over the widget bar and then
click the More tab that appears to see more
options (such as more widgets or a Trash icon
for getting rid of widgets).

Minimize the widget bar by clicking the X. It
rotates into a plus symbol, which you can click
to maximize the widget bar.

Hover your cursor over any widget to create an 
X that allows you to close that widget (see 
Figure 15-12).

Click the red button at the bottom of the 
Address Book to launch the actual Address Book
application.

Part III
Handling Files (And
Other Stuff) Quickly


16
Organizing Your
Home Directory
P
icture this: You’re sitting there reading this book. You’ve got a
lovely Macintosh in front of you. Tiger — Apple’s latest and greatest
operating system — is purring along. You might have read Part II of
this book and picked up some navigation tips, discovered how to work
the Finder, organized your Dock, toyed with contextual menus, and
(hopefully) begun using Exposé. But the real question haunting your
mind is this: What do I do with all my stuff? That’s what we tell you in
this technique.
This technique is all about your stuff: you know, those files and folders in
your Home directory, most of which were created by default, and some of
which you might have added. The first section of this technique is a
primer on the Home directory, how it’s organized, and how to most effi-
ciently use it. We then take you on a brief tour of your Library folder,
which is a special area for special files. The third section delves into the
Desktop: what you ought to know about it and some good ideas on how
to use it. Finally, we briefly discuss the Dock, just to make sure that
you’ve really started using it.
Your Stuff, Your Home Directory, and You
Mac OS X revolutionized the way files are managed on the hard drive 
(for Mac users, at least). This is largely thanks to the more secure multi-
user environment. All users have their own directories, located within
the Users directory on the boot operating system’s hard drive, as shown
in Figure 16-1. Each user’s directory is named after the user’s short name,
as entered when the account was created.
• Figure 16-1: The Users directory and its contents.

/Users/marc. If Larry is logged in, ~ means
/Users/larryullman. Thus, ~/Documents
can stand for either /Users/larryullman/
Documents or /Users/marc/Documents, but
it is always the current user’s Document folder.
By default, your Home directory consists of what
you see in Figure 16-2:
• Figure 16-2: The standard user’s Home directory.

Desktop: The Desktop folder contains all the files
and folders stored on the Desktop. The Desktop
might also show volumes, CDs, DVDs, disk
images, and more, but those aren’t actually in
the Desktop folder.

Documents: The Documents folder was created
as a place for you to store your, um, documents
(such as your Word files, work-related projects,
downloaded stuff, and more). Things you look at,
edit, read, delete, create, and so forth all go in
the Documents directory.
The Documents directory should be the folder
that you work with the most! By keeping all
your documents in it, they are easier to find,
open, search for, and save.

Library: The Library could actually be the most
important part of your Home folder (or second
most important after the Documents folder). The
Library stores everything the operating system
needs to know about you. This includes
In the Users directory, the current user’s 
Home folder is always marked by a little house
icon. (See the folder named larryullman in
Figure 16-1.)
Although separating the users this way might seem
like a hassle, here are some benefits:

The structure is more secure: Each user can
access only his or her own files (assuming that
folks log in as themselves).

The operating system is safer: Because your
stuff is no longer interspersed with the operating
system’s stuff, you’re far less likely to do some-
thing that messes up your whole computer.
Granted, you can still do something to mess up
your stuff, but we cover how to avoid doing that,
too (see Technique 22).

Your stuff is easier to back up: If you manage
your stuff properly, using the format suggested
by Apple, you can back up every important item
— all your e-mail, documents, pictures, music,
and even application preferences settings — 
simply by backing up this one directory.

Your stuff is easier to restore: Should a disaster
ever strike, you can fully recover all your stuff as
long as you’ve backed up your Home directory.
Whether you use backup software or just copy
the entire directory to an external drive, restor-
ing your files is never very complicated. 

Your files are easier to transfer: If you want to
move your files from one computer or hard drive
to another, copying the contents of your Home
directory does the trick.

Operating system upgrades are less intrusive:
Whereas previous Mac OS upgrades could affect
your data, OS X upgrades avoid touching the
Users directory altogether, making these transi-
tions less painful.
In this book and other resources, you often
seen path names: the full name of a folder on
your computer. In path names, the ~ (tilde)
refers to the current user’s Home directory. 
For example, if Marc is logged in, ~ refers to

Your Stuff, Your Home Directory, and You
125
 Address Book records
 iCal calendars
 Favorites
 Keychains
 The Mail application’s data
 Preferences files
 Web browser bookmarks
 Stickies contents
Because the Library folder is so important, we
cover it a bit more in this technique.

Movies: The Movies directory was intended as
the default directory for creating movies in
iMovie. It’s one of the few optional folders in the
Home directory.

Music: The Music directory is the iTunes equiva-
lent of the Movies directory. It’s intended to
store your music collection and the text files that
iTunes uses to manage that collection.

Pictures: The Pictures directory is the iPhoto
equivalent of the Movies and Music folders. The
iPhoto application uses it by default, but it’s also
a logical place to store any graphics that you
have.

Public: The Public folder is a special case. It’s
designed to provide a storeroom for files that
will be accessible by other users on your
Macintosh or on your network. Within the Public
folder is a Drop Box folder so that others on your
Network or Mac can give you files.
If a number of files need to be accessible by
everyone on your Mac, place them in the
Shared folder within the Users directory. Every
user can read from and write to this folder,
making it a great document management tool.

Sites: The Sites folder is for Web pages, which
can be accessed by going to http://localhost/
~username/ or http://your.ip.address/~
username/ (see Figure 16-3).
• Figure 16-3: The Sites folder holds Web pages that you
can access through browsers like Safari.
Here are our top ten tips for organizing and using
your Home directory:

Don’t delete or rename any of the existing 
folders.
As a general rule, you can add folders or files
to your Home directory, but you shouldn’t
delete or rename any of the default folders. In
particular, tinkering with the Desktop or
Library folders would be a grave mistake.

Use the Desktop as a temporary storage place.
See “A Cluttered Desktop Is a Sign of a Cluttered
Mind,” later in this technique.

Use the Documents folder for all your 
documents.
Go wild with it. Organize your documents as logi-
cally as possible, creating subdirectories for files
based upon their type (what application created
them) or purpose (personal, school, work).
Most applications use the Documents folder as
the default place to save or open files. Go with
the flow on this point: It will save you endless
time spent wandering around your computer
in search of a file.

Technique 16: Organizing Your Home Directory
126

Add fonts, contextual menu items,
AppleScripts, screen savers, and other add-ons
to the operating system in the corresponding
folders of your Library, not the system library.

Back up your entire Home directory fre-
quently, often, regularly, consistently, without
fail, and on a regular basis. See Technique 49
for backup utilities and best practices.
Checking Out Your Library
The Library is, in some ways, the most important
item in your Home directory. It contains all the infor-
mation about you and how you use the computer.
Here’s a rundown of some of the Library’s important
folders and how they relate to your use of the com-
puter:

The Application Support folder contains critical
files for many applications (check it out in 
Figure 16-4), including
 Your Address Book data
 iCal information (other than calendars)
 Extensions to the Terminal application
Third-party applications also use the Application
Support folder:
 The LaunchBar utility keeps its settings there.
 The Camino Web browser stores preferences
and bookmarks.
 Big Cat stores AppleScripts for contextual
menus.
 The Fire list of accounts and preferences is
saved here. (Fire is an instant messaging
application.)

If you have enough hard drive space, place all
your music, movies, and pictures in the appro-
priate media folders.
Apple’s iLife applications (iTunes, iPhoto,
iMovie, and iDVD) can use directories that are
located outside of your Home directory for
their files. This is normally an option within the
particular application’s preferences.

If you create Web sites, place all the associated
files within the Sites directory. (Don’t split 
the files between the Sites and Documents
directories.)

If an application gives you the option of
installing it system-wide or just for your use,
install it just for your use.
If you install the application for yourself, the files
go into your Home directory and are retained
through any operating system transitions that
follow.

Store smaller-sized software that you simply
must have — such as drivers for an input
device or printer — in your Home directory so
that they’ll be easy to find if you need to rein-
stall them.
Create an Installs or Software directory within
your Documents folder to store small applica-
tions that you will probably need to install
again. For example, the driver for your mouse
might be only 2MB in size and needs to be
reinstalled with every major operating system
upgrade. Keeping a copy of the installer saves
you a trip online the next time you need to
install it.

Create a text document listing all the software
and corresponding serial numbers that you use
on your computer — and then store it in your
Home folder.
Print this document for reference as well.

As you can see, pretty much everything except for
your applications and your files (images, documents,
and what-not) gets stored in the Library directory.
For this reason, be sure to treat it with respect and
include it in your daily backups. (You are doing daily
backups, right?)
Aside from backing up your Library folder and
possibly adding a few things to it, don’t mess
around with it unless you really know what
you’re doing. If you delete something you
shouldn’t, you can cause yourself a lot of pain.
How many Libraries does one 
computer need?
Your Macintosh actually has several Library folders on it . . .
three at least. Strange as this might seem, these libraries all
serve approximately the same purpose. The main differ-
ences are the priority and scope that each Library has. You’ll
find a Library folder in

The root of the system disk (/Library)
The /Library folder is primarily for third-party appli-
cations and other developers to install items for all
users. During OS upgrades, Apple doesn’t mess with
the /Library folder.

Technique 16: Organizing Your Home Directory
128
• Figure 16-6: The Desktop as viewed in the Finder.
• Figure 16-7: The Desktop as just another directory in a
Finder window.
The main difference between the Desktop and your
other folders is that the Desktop’s contents are
pretty much always visible because it’s the bottom
layer (so to speak) of what’s on your monitor. On the
bright side, anything that’s stored there is readily
accessible. But if you’ve got a lot going on there, it
can quickly become overwhelming.
Because the Desktop is almost always visible
and can become cluttered quickly, we strongly
advocate that you use it primarily for tempo-
rary storage and to access hard drives, CD-
ROMs, and the like. You might even want to
create subfolders on the Desktop for longer-
term (yet still temporary) storage to cut down
the mess.

The System folder (/System/Library)
The /System folder is basically for Apple and only
Apple usage. Apple has carte blanche with /System
during upgrades.

Each user’s Library folder (~/Library)
For example, each of these Libraries might have a
Contextual Menu Items folder. Items in your CM folder will
be available only to you. Items in the /System/Library
CM folder are available to every user on the computer and
were probably put there by Apple. In future versions of the
operating system, those CM items might be upgraded.
Those in the /Library folder are available to all users and
should remain unharmed by upgrading the OS. In case
you’re the curious type, note that the contents of the 
various libraries are loaded in this order: /Library,
/System/Library, ~/Library.
One important consideration with the Libraries is that
things stored in either /Library or /System/Library
might be replaced with every new installation of an operat-
ing system. If you perform an Erase and Install, an Archive
and Install, or even an Upgrade, these contents will likely be
replaced or overwritten. The contents of your Library folder
will remain, though, making it a good place to store all your
stuff! 
A Cluttered Desktop Is a Sign 
of a Cluttered Mind
The Desktop exists in two worlds. Yes, that’s right —
the Desktop is both a dessert topping and a floor wax:

It’s the base level of the Finder, appearing on
your screen underneath everything else (as
shown in Figure 16-6).

It’s another folder within your Home directory
that can be used to store your stuff (see 
Figure 16-7). 

A Cluttered Desktop Is a Sign of a Cluttered Mind
129
Aside from tinkering with how much stuff lingers on
your Desktop, you can customize its behavior in
three ways:

Use the Desktop & Screen Saver panel of
System Preferences (see Figure 16-8).
This panel allows you to set what color, graphic,
or picture is used as the backdrop of the
Desktop. Although it’s an aesthetic decision, hav-
ing a visually pleasing Desktop goes a long way
toward preserving your sanity.
To change your Desktop background:
1. Control-click the Desktop to bring up the con-
textual menu.
2. Select Change Desktop Background from the
contextual menu.
3. In the resulting window (see Figure 16-8),
select a broad category from the left column.
Only one of the options behaves uniquely: If
you click the Choose Folder option, you’re
given an Open dialog in which to find a folder
on your hard drive. After you find the folder
you want, click the Choose button or press
Return.
4. Click one of the options that appears in the
right column to select a specific color or
image.
5. Quit the System Preferences panel.
If you really like eye candy, set the Desktop
panel to rotate its picture every so often by
using the Change Picture drop-down list. You
can also do a hack to make screen savers run
as the background to your Desktop. It’s a very
processor-intensive thing to do, slowing down
your computer noticeably, but it’s soooo cool.
See Technique 62 for instructions and helpful
tools.

Use the Finder preferences panel (see 
Figure 16-9), under General.
• Figure 16-8: The Desktop & Screen Saver panel sets the
graphical appearance of your Desktop.

Revisiting Our Friend, the Dock
We give a good amount of attention to our friend, the
Dock, in Technique 13. We’d like to revisit (or visit, if
you haven’t read that other technique yet) one
aspect of organizing the Dock.
The Dock has two sides: the left, where applications
are docked, and the right, which contains the Trash
and any folders or files that you choose to dock
there. After you get your stuff organized, it’s a good
time to add key components to the right side of the
Dock. We recommend these (see Figure 16-11):
Here you can indicate whether you want hard
drives, CDs, DVDs, iPods, and connected servers
to appear as icons on your Desktop.

Select View➪Show View Options (see 
Figure 16-10) in the Finder.
For how your Desktop looks and functions, the
Show View Options panel is the most critical of
the settings panels. Here you can set
 The default size of icons (in pixels)
 The default text size for names of items
 Whether an item’s name (called label in this
panel) should appear below or to the right of
an item
 Whether you want to see an item’s info (for
example, the dimensions of an image or the
size of a hard drive)
 Whether you want to see a thumbnail preview
of images as their icon
 How files should be arranged, if at all
You want to set the icon and text sizes so that
they’re easy to view but don’t take up too much
space. The arrangement of items is the most impor-
tant consideration. If you keep them arranged by
name, your hard drives, discs, and such appear in
the upper-right corner. Remaining items are listed in
alphabetical order, just as you’d see them in the list
or column view of a Finder window.
If you prefer your Desktop to be more 
entertaining than useful, consider iLuxo, 
a free application from The iOS Zone (www.
ios-software.com). This utility adds anima-
tion and sound to your Desktop but is best
used only if you have a speedy computer.

Technique
Managing Aliases,
Favorites, and Icons
T
his technique deals with aliases, Favorites, and icons: all the things
that give you quick access to the files and folders that you use
most.
This technique has three main sections, each of which shows you how to
deal with the contents of your computer indirectly. In the first section,
we talk about aliases: what they are, how you create them, and how you
want to use them. In the second section, we go into Favorites, which are a
specific grouping of aliases. In the final part of this chapter, you find out
about icons, which are the visual representation for your stuff.
Also Known As: Working with Aliases
Your computer is loaded (perhaps overloaded) with many different files,
folders, and applications. Each of these items is located in a specific spot
on your hard drive, represented by an icon and a filename. An alias is a
secondary pointer to the same item. It can be (and normally is) placed in
another location; it can have a different name; and it can even have a dif-
ferent icon. However, by default, an item’s alias uses the same icon as the
original except for the addition of a little black arrow in the lower-left cor-
ner (see the bottom icon of Figure 17-1). The alias is created with the
same filename as the original except that the word alias is also appended
to the end under most circumstances.

Also Known As: Working with Aliases
133
• Figure 17-1: An alias looks like the original file save for
the black, curved arrow.
Aliases offer the following benefits:

They allow you to have virtually the same item
existing in many locations.

They’re relatively small in size. For example, 
the alias of a 6MB MP3 file might take up only a
few KB.

They enable you to create groups of aliases to
related items without shuffling around the origi-
nal items.

They are very easy to create, manage, and
delete.

They make accessing files, folders, and applica-
tions easier without undermining any organiza-
tional structures.
The operating system makes use of aliases all
over the place. Items in the Dock, in the left
side of a Finder window, and some menu
items are aliases. You might not be aware of
these aliases and they might not have the 
little black, curved arrows, but the principle
remains.
Here’s how aliases work:

Opening an alias of a file has the same effect as
opening the original file.

Opening an alias of an application is the same as
opening the application by using its original icon.

Opening an alias of a folder opens the original
folder.

Deleting an alias has no effect on the original
item at all.
An alias isn’t a copy of an item. If you open
and edit the alias of a file, the effect is the
same as if you open and edit the original file.
But if you delete an alias, the original remains.
After you select an item, you can create an alias in
any of five ways:

Press Ô-L.

Hold down the Option and Ô keys while drag-
ging the item with your mouse.
If you use this method, the cursor turns into the
little curved alias arrow.
If you use the Ô-Option-drag method to
make an alias, it adds the word alias to the
filename if you drop the file within the same
folder as the original (because a folder can’t
contain two items with the same name). If you
create the alias in another folder, it doesn’t add
the word alias. In either case, the curved black
arrow is added to the icon, indicating its alias
status.

Technique 17: Managing Aliases, Favorites, and Icons
134
• Figure 17-3: Using the QuickAccess contextual menu to
make an alias.
To find the original item for an alias, select the alias
and do one of the following:

Press Ô-R.

Choose Show Original from the Finder’s File
menu.

Control-click the alias and choose Show
Original from the contextual menu.
Remarkably, aliases continue to work no matter
what you do with either the alias or the original file
as long as you don’t remove either from the volume
in which it was created. If an alias can’t find the orig-
inal file, you see a prompt (as shown in Figure 17-4)
that allows you to reselect the original or delete the
alias.

Go to the Finder’s File menu and choose Make
Alias (see Figure 17-2).
• Figure 17-2: The Make Alias command is located in the
Finder’s File menu.

Control-click the item and select Make Alias
from the resulting contextual menu.

Use the QuickAccessCM’s Make Alias In option
(see Figure 17-3).
This contextual menu is mentioned in Technique
14. One of the many features it adds is the ability
to make an alias and place it in another direc-
tory, all in one step.

These Are a Few of My Favorites Things
135
These Are a Few of My Favorites
Things
In Mac OS X, Apple introduced Favorites: a collection
of aliases for your favorite things. By default, your
Favorites were linked as a folder in your Dock, allow-
ing you to access those items by Control-clicking 
(or clicking and holding) the icon (see Figure 17-5).
• Figure 17-5: The Favorites folder in the Dock.
In previous versions of Mac OS X, the Ô-T shortcut
added the selected item to your Favorites, but this
feature has been eliminated. (In Tiger, that shortcut
now adds the item to the Finder window’s Sidebar.)
But we still like the idea of Favorites, so here’s the
easiest way to access your Favorites:
• Figure 17-4: Opening an alias whose original file can’t be
found generates this prompt.
A UNIX alias: Symbolic links
The Macintosh alias is the equivalent of the UNIX symbolic
link (and the Windows shortcut, too, but who cares about
Windows?). A symbolic link is just a secondary pointer to the
original file, application, or folder. Because Mac OS X is
based on the FreeBSD version of UNIX, you can also make
symbolic links in it by using the Terminal application.
The syntax for linking to a file is ln -s alias_name
original_file_name. If you aren’t in the same directory
as both the original and the alias or if you otherwise want to
be exact, you probably want to include the path to both the
link and the original file: ln -s /path/to/original_
file_name /path/to/alias_name. If you want to create
an alias to a folder, the same syntax applies: for example,
ln -s /Users/larry/Sites /Users/larry/Desktop/
Sites_alias or simply ln -s ~/Sites ~/Desktop/
Sites_alias. As with standard aliases, a symbolic pointer
is created by this command, pointing to the original item.
Like UNIX, with the Mac you can create hard or soft links.
The -s option creates a soft link, and omitting it creates a
hard one. A soft link is exactly like an alias. A hard link is like
having another copy of the data itself and also has the
restriction that hard links can’t point to an item on another
volume (a disk drive or partition). You really should stick to
soft links because hard links are likely to cause problems in
one way or another.
One advantage that the Mac’s aliases have over symbolic
links is that you can move an alias from one location to
another, and it still works — it finds the original just fine.
Conversely, symbolic links can never be moved. They must
be deleted and re-created instead.
If you’re keen on symbolic links but tired of the Terminal,
check out the MakeSymlink contextual menu (www.
naratt.com/MakeSymlink.html, $12). It allows you to
create actual symbolic links in the Finder.

3.
Begin dragging the selected item toward the
Favorites icon in the Sidebar.
4.
While still dragging but before reaching the
Favorites icon, hold down the Option and Ô
keys so that the Make Alias icon appears with
your dragged selection.
5.
To confirm that the item was added to your
Favorites, click the Favorites icon in the
Sidebar to bring up the directory (see 
Figure 17-7).
• Figure 17-7: A Favorites folder, with aliases for
applications and directories.
Whether you use Favorites is up to you, but
the idea of collecting, organizing, and access-
ing a collection of aliases to your favorite
applications, documents, and files is one worth
pursuing. After you place items in your
Favorites folder, you can quickly launch appli-
cations, open files, or find directories by using
the Favorites link in the Sidebar or the Dock.
You don’t have to limit yourself to only one
Favorites folder. Create a second or a third
Favorites folder and then add these folders to
your primary Favorites directory. This way you
can have subgroups of applications by use or
files by project. Many sequences of steps that
you frequently take can be expedited by using
aliases and Favorites.
1.
Open a Finder window.
2.
Navigate to the Library folder in your Home
directory (~/Library).
3.
Select the Favorites folder.
4.
Press Ô-T to add the Favorites to the window’s
Sidebar (see Figure 17-6).
• Figure 17-6: Your Favorites appear in the Sidebar with a
heart-shaped icon.
5.
If you want, also drag the Favorites folder onto
your Dock so that it’s accessible there.
After your Favorites are readily available, you’ll 
want to actually add your favorite things to this 
collection:
1.
From the Finder window, navigate to the item
that you want to add to your Favorites.
2.
Select the item.

If You Can, Icon
137
If You Can, Icon
An icon is the visual representation of an item, and it
tells you a lot about the item in question. Knowing
how icons work and how to manipulate them goes a
ways toward more productively using your com-
puter. Here are some basics:

All folders use a default icon that looks like a,
well, folder.

Files use an icon showing what application
they’re associated with.

Applications normally use their own custom
icon.
How your computer treats icons is dictated by the
View Options panel. You can bring this up by either

Pressing Ô-J

Choosing View➪Show View Options
The View Options menu controls these icon settings:

The icon size in pixels.

The size of the text associated with an icon (the
item’s name).

Where the item’s name (called the label in the
Show View Options panel) appears (underneath
or beside the icon).

How icons are arranged on the Desktop or in a
window.
In icon view mode only, you can dictate whether
and how icons are automatically arranged. Your
options are by Name, Data Modified, Date
Created, Size, Kind, and Label.
Select the Show Icon Preview check box under
the View Options panel to have all images
represented by a thumbnail of the actual
image. This feature is nice but can slow down
your computer when you open directories
with lots of images.
The View Options panel is also discussed in
Technique 12, which covers how to customize
the Finder windows.
In all likelihood, you won’t change the default icons
for your files or applications, but you could (and fre-
quently should) use new icons for your folders.
Doing so helps you more easily recognize a particu-
lar folder, whether it’s in a Finder window or the
Dock. You can create your own icons by using Adobe
Photoshop, the open source The Gimp application,
or other graphics software (see the sidebar “Making
your own icons”), or you can download free icons
that others have made. Check out these resourceful
sites:

custom icons without much effort. Two popular tools for
doing so are Folder Icon Maker X (http://homepage.
mac.com/niteowl69, $5) and IconBuilder Pro (www.
iconfactory.com/ib_home.asp, $69), an add-on tool
for Adobe Photoshop. A free alternative is Viou (http://

Addressing Your
Addresses
I
n this technique, we delve into the Address Book, which is much more
useful and important than you might think. It “only” manages a list of
people and contact information, but that’s a pretty big task. More
importantly, the Address Book ties into the Mail application and is even
represented in the Tiger’s new Dashboard. So using and mastering this
one application is well worth your time.
Getting to Know the Address Book
The Address Book has been around since the beginning of OS X. The new
features added in Panther and Tiger make it even more useful. Those fea-
tures include

Printing mailing labels and envelopes

Autoformatting phone numbers

Creating your own default templates for records

Listing relations, friends, and associates for the people in your
Address Book

Smart Groups, for easily making dynamic groups of people

Recording birthdays, which can appear in an iCal calendar
If you use the Address Book a lot, make sure that you back up the
contents just in case of disaster. The Address Book database is stored
in your Home directory (in the Library/Application Support/
AddressBook folder), but you can manually back it up by choosing
File➪Back Up Address Book in the Address Book.

Technique 18: Addressing Your Addresses
142
One good reason to use the default applications that
Apple includes with the operating system (such as
the Address Book, Mail, and iTunes) is how well they
work together. Take the Address Book, for example.
If you use it to store and manage your contacts,
you’ll appreciate how nicely it works with Mail or
with the faxing software. Most of what the Address
Book does is self-explanatory. In this technique, we
cover a few tricks and habits that you might not
know . . . but might find useful.
If you have Bluetooth and a Bluetooth-enabled
cellular phone, you can dial phone numbers
by using the Address Book (see Technique 55).
Customizing the Template
When you add contacts to your Address Book,
you’re given a default template with set fields of
records that can be entered for each contact, such
as name and e-mail address. In all likelihood, these
preset fields and formats don’t adequately reflect
the information that you want to record or use. The
first thing that you should do with the Address Book
is to customize this default template.
Taking the time once to create a default
Address Book template makes adding or edit-
ing records easier and more efficient.
However, changing the template neither
deletes nor changes any previously existing
records. The template determines only what
fields are shown for new records — not what
information can be recorded or displayed.
To customize the default Address Book application:
1.
Open the Address Book application.
2.
Choose Address Book➪Preferences or press Ô-,
(that’s a comma).
3.
In the Preferences dialog that appears, click
the Template pane (see Figure 18-1).
Accessing your Address Book
The most obvious way to find a person’s information is to
launch the Address Book itself and search it, but that’s not
the only or necessarily the fastest method. Other options

you can browse your contacts.
The contents of your Address Book also are automatically
available in the Mail application. When sending an e-mail to
a person in your book, you never have to go to the Address
Book first.

Customizing the Template
143
• Figure 18-1: The Template panel allows you to customize
the Address Book’s default template.
4.
Change any existing fields that you don’t like to
ones that you will use.
For example:
 If you want the template to have a home
phone field by default but no work phone,
change the work phone listing by clicking the
word work next to Phone and selecting home
from the drop-down list that appears.
 If you want to list a person’s spouse instead of
friend or assistant, click the word next to
Names (this is “friend” by default) and select
the appropriate alternative from the drop-
down list that appears.
 If AOL Instant Messaging (AIM) isn’t the
instant messaging application that you use
most often, change it to another from the
drop-down list, as shown in Figure 18-2.
• Figure 18-2: You can access more options by clicking the
up and down arrows to open this drop-down
list.
5.
Delete all the fields that you won’t be using by
default by clicking the red minus sign next to
an item to remove it.
Your Address Book records must have the
First (Name), Last (Name), Company, Image,
and Note fields. These are the only ones that
can’t be deleted.
6.
Add multiple fields of the same type by using
the green button with the plus sign on it.
If you want several phone options or e-mail list-
ings in your default template, click the green plus
button to add another field of that type. Then
select a description from the drop-down list. For
example, add another e-mail address by clicking
the green button next to Email (marked as
“home”). Then select Work, Other, or Custom
from the new field’s drop-down list.

Technique 18: Addressing Your Addresses
144
• Figure 18-4: Use the Phone panel to set the default
format for phone numbers.
Creating Your Own vCard
The Address Book uses the vCard format, which is
the default format for personnel records. If you cre-
ate your own record in the Address Book (the appli-
cation creates a record for you automatically), you
can export the record as a vCard and e-mail it to
friends or co-workers. They can then import it into
their own contacts application whether they use
Address Book or another application, such as
Microsoft Entourage, which saves them the trouble
of typing the information.
1.
Open the Address Book application.
2.
Navigate to your record by choosing Card➪
Go to My Card. 
You can see a card in Figure 18-5.
7.
Use the drop-down list at the top of the window
to add any other fields that you want.
Use the top drop-down list, shown in Figure 18-3,
to add new fields (such as a birthday or nick-
name) or standard ones that you’ve removed
(e-mail addresses and phone numbers).
• Figure 18-3: Use the Add Field menu to add fields not
currently listed in the template.
8.
When you finish creating the template, close
the Preferences window by clicking the Close
button or pressing Ô-W.
After you finish defining the Address Book
template, go to the Phone panel, where you
can establish the default format for phone
numbers (see Figure 18-4). If you check the
Automatically Format Phone Numbers box,
those numbers that match the default format
are formatted, while others (like international
numbers) are safely left alone.

Creating Your Own vCard
145
• Figure 18-5: My default Address Book record.
You can have more than one record for your-
self (or anyone), but you can mark only one as
your official record in the Address Book. This
way, you can make different records for per-
sonal or business purposes.
3.
Click the Edit button at the bottom of the card
panel.
You can toggle between edit and view mode
with the Ô-L keyboard shortcut.
4.
Edit your information, adding, changing, and
removing fields as necessary.
You can add other fields to the card by using
the Add Field option under the Card menu.
5.
Add your image — if you want — by double-
clicking the image icon.
Double-clicking the image icon in the edit mode
brings up the image panel (see Figure 18-6). With
it, you can
 Drag an image file from the Finder into the
window.
 Use an attached video camera to take a snap-
shot of yourself.
If you have a FireWire video camera con-
nected to your computer — like one you
would use for video conferencing with 
iChat — your mug appears in this window.
You can capture yourself by clicking the Take
Video Snapshot button.
 Click the Choose button to navigate to and
select the image to use.
• Figure 18-6: The image panel lets you add a graphical or
pictorial representation of yourself to your
card.

Technique 18: Addressing Your Addresses
146
Technique 34 covers the Ô-Y shortcut (found
within the Mail application) that creates an
Address Book entry for the sender of the cur-
rently selected (or viewed) e-mail.
Creating and Using Groups
Every record in your Address Book can also be a
member of one or more groups. (They don’t have to
be, though; a record can be independent of all
groups.) Defining groups brings you three main 
benefits:

Better organization for finding a record

Ability to send an entire group (like your family)
updated contact information with the click of a
button

Ability to send e-mails to a defined set of people,
such as everyone in your department, by refer-
ring to the group name in the Mail application
You can create a group in four ways:

Using the New Group From Selection tool

Manually

Duplicating an existing group

Using Tiger’s new Smart Groups feature
Hold down the Option key when you have
selected a person’s record in the Name col-
umn to see what groups that person is in.
Using the New Group From Selection tool
A quick way to create a new group is to choose
File➪New Group From Selection.
1.
Make sure you are in Cards and Columns mode
by pressing Ô-1 (see Figure 18-8).
Address Book supports three modes (all avail-
able through the View menu): Cards and
Columns, Card Only, and Directories. Cards and
Columns is the best for creating groups.
After you select your image, click the Set button
to apply the changes. Then you return to the
Card panel, where you can continue editing your
record.
6.
When you’re done editing your record, click
the Edit button to complete the changes.
7.
Choose File➪Export vCard.
8.
Save the vCard (see Figure 18-7).
You most likely want to use your name as the
name of the file (with no file extension) and save
it in your Documents directory or other sub-
folder of your Home directory.
• Figure 18-7: Export your vCard to your Documents
directory.
After you create your vCard, you can attach it to
e-mails so that people can add your record to their
virtual Rolodexes (whether or not they use Address
Book). In fact, adding and editing your own card is a
great way to feel comfortable with the process and
the application for when you start adding other peo-
ple’s information. If someone e-mails you a vCard,
add it to your Address Book by dragging and drop-
ping it onto the application.

Creating and Using Groups
147
• Figure 18-8: Address Book’s Cards and Columns mode.
2.
Click the All option under Group to display

3.
Ô-click the names listed in the Name column to
select the group members.
4.
Choose File➪New Group From Selection (see
Figure 18-9).
A new group is created in the Group column.
This new group’s name (“Group Name” by
default) is highlighted, ready for you to type the
new name.
• Figure 18-9: The New Group From Selection option eases
the group creation process.
5.

6.
Press Return to complete the transaction.
Creating a group manually
To create a group manually:
1.
Make sure that you’re in Cards and Columns
view mode; choose it from the View menu or
press Ô-1.
2.
Click the plus sign in the lower-left corner to
create a new group.
3.
Type the new group’s name in the new, high-
lighted field that appears (see Figure 18-10).
• Figure 18-10: When you add a new group, it’s given a
default name that you can easily change.
4.
Search or browse through the Address Book
names, adding people to the new group by
dragging their cards onto the group name.
To delete a group member, select the mem-
ber’s name from under the Group listing and
then press Delete. Press Return at the prompt
that appears (see Figure 18-11) to remove the
user only from this group (not from the whole
Address Book).

Technique 18: Addressing Your Addresses
148
• Figure 18-12: The smart group prompt.
3.
Create as many conditions as you need to limit
your search (as shown in Figure 18-13).
Use the two drop-down lists and the text box to
add a condition, and then click the plus sign if
you want to add another condition.
Conditions can be based on virtually any piece of
address book information, including the person’s
name, the company for which she works, when
her birthday is, or in which state she resides.
• Figure 18-13: The conditions you create dictate what
people are in your Smart Group.
With multiple criteria, another drop-down list
appears, giving you the option to require any
or all of the criteria. If you select all, each con-
dition makes your search narrower. If you
select any, each condition makes your search
broader.
4.
Click OK when you’re ready to create the smart
group.
The Smart Group creates two groups of every
record that matches your conditions. Both
groups have the same name:
 A normal group with a normal icon
 A smart group (with the special smart group
icon) at the bottom of the group list (as
shown in Figure 18-14)
• Figure 18-11: When you delete a user from a group, you
have to clarify your intentions.
Duplicating an existing group
If you want to create a new group that contains some
of the members of an existing group (like the imme-
diate family subset of your extended family group),
you might want to simply duplicate the existing
group and edit members accordingly. Here’s how:
1.
Select the existing group in the Group listing
(the left column).
2.
Choose Edit➪Copy or press Ô-C.
3.
Choose Edit➪Paste or press Ô-V to create a
copy of that group.
4.
Rename the new group (called Old Group
Name copy) by double-clicking the group’s
name.
5.
Edit the group’s members by using the steps
outlined in the preceding section.
Creating Smart Groups
Tiger has an entirely new way to create a group in
the Address Book: Smart Groups. They’re much like
the Finder’s Smart Folders, iPhoto’s Smart Albums,
or iTunes’ Smart Playlists. (Tiger is one smart
cookie.)
To create a Smart Group:
1.
Choose File➪New Smart Group.
You can also Option-click the plus sign in the
lower-left corner of the Cards and Columns view.
2.
In the resulting prompt, give the group a name
(see Figure 18-12).

Other Cool Address Book Tricks
149
• Figure 18-14: Two Family groups are created: one normal
and one smart.
5.
To edit the members of the group manually, use
the plain group.
Click the normal group’s icon and you can delete
and add records as you would any other group.
Deleting a record from the Smart Group 
itself — the one with the special Smart Group
icon — deletes that record from the entire
Address Book. Deleting a record from the
plain group (the one created by the Smart
Group) is safe.
6.
To edit the Smart Group criteria, Option-double-
click the smart icon and reuse the prompt.
Because Smart Groups are so amazingly
smart, they automatically update themselves
as your address book data changes. For exam-
ple, if your friend marries your brother and
you change her last name in Address Book,
her record is added to the Family group. If you
later add another person’s record (like when
your uncle finally gets a computer), that record
also is added to the group, if the Smart
Group’s conditions are met.
7.
After changing a Smart Group’s conditions,
update the normal group by copying the con-
tents of the Smart Group into the plain group.
Other Cool Address Book Tricks
Apple put a lot of thought into the Address Book,
and it has its fair share of cool tricks. Here are the
ones that you should know, in case you don’t:

If you change your contact information, use the
Send Updates option (under the File menu) to
automatically e-mail your new information to
others. By selecting among the groups you have
already created, you can notify your friends and
family every time you move or change Internet
providers.

Click the address link for a home page to go to
that site.

Click the caption next to a person’s e-mail
address to open a contextual menu so that you
can send the person an e-mail (see Figure 18-15).

Managing
Information
Effectively
I
n this technique, we delve into just a few of the applications that you
can use to manage your miscellaneous information. You probably
already use Microsoft Office for word processing and spreadsheets,
and maybe you use iPhoto for your images, but where do you store that
important note or that quote you liked? Instead of writing this stuff down
and throwing it in a desk drawer where it’s never seen again, use the
tools that we cover here.
The first application we discuss is Stickies, which has been around in
Mac OS X for a while now. Then we move on to the Dashboard’s own ver-
sion of Stickies. After that, we look into a commercial product called
StickyBrain. Finally, we list a few scrapbook-like applications that you can
use to manage and organize sporadic bits of information, create to-do
lists, make outlines, and so forth.
Storing Information as a Sticky Note
If you aren’t already using Stickies — an Apple application that comes
with Tiger — you’re missing out on a useful little tool for storing little tid-
bits of info. Stickies creates small text files with sticky note–like behavior.
Unlike using TextEdit, with Stickies you can create color-coded notes,
quickly make a note by using Services (see Technique 29), and keep a
note at the front of your screen while you’re using another application.
Some good Stickies tips include the following:

In the Finder and any Cocoa application (such as Mail, Safari, TextEdit,
and the Address Book), create a new sticky note out of highlighted text
by pressing Ô-Shift-Y.

Change a note’s formatting based upon its purpose or category. You
can use many colors for your sticky notes, and you can change both
the note background and the font color. Use different colored sticky
notes for different purposes (even though Figure 19-1 is in grayscale,
you get the idea). You can change a note’s color by using the Color
menu, and you can alter the fonts by using the Font menu or the Font
palette (which you can access by pressing Ô-T).

Stickies Lite: Using Dashboard
Dashboard, the widget-running tool that’s associated
with Exposé, has its own version of Stickies. The
main advantage of Dashboard Stickies is that you
can invoke it no matter what you’re currently doing.
However, Dashboard Stickies isn’t as feature-rich as
Stickies proper. A Dashboard sticky note


Can’t float so that it’s available while working in
other applications.
But if these aren’t features you use or need, and 
if what you really want is instantaneous access, 
Dashboard is the tool for you. Here’s how to use
Dashboard Stickies:
• Figure 19-1: You can assign colors to sticky notes to help
you remember whether they’re personal,
work related, and so forth.

When you find a note color and style that you
like, choose Note➪Use as Default option under
the Note menu. Then, when you create a new
note, it will automatically be formatted in your
preferred style (existing notes will not be
affected).

Check the spelling in a note from the contextual
menu (Control-click a note) or choose Edit➪
Spelling.

Stickies supports Services (see Technique 29),
meaning that you can access many different
shortcuts from within the Stickies application.
You can also interact with Stickies from other
applications that support Services, like Mail (see
Figure 19-2).

Have a sticky note float above other applications
by clicking it and pressing Ô-Shift-F or choosing
Floating Window from the Note menu. A floating
sticky note is never hidden by other applications:
It always appears at the “front” of the screen.

Stickies can store more than just text. You can
also put images, videos, and sounds in them.
This capability makes Stickies much like the
long-gone Scrapbook application.

Working with Files
T
his, the third part of the book, is all about your stuff: where to put
it, how to file it, and what to do with all the things that fill up a
computer. In this technique, we talk about files (as opposed to fold-
ers or applications) and Tiger. We should, therefore, talk a little bit about
how the operating system treats your stuff. Being able to comprehend
and make the most of this relationship (between the operating system
and your files) goes a long way toward being able to use your computer
more effectively.
We begin by discussing a file’s properties. This includes Tiger’s naming
conventions, locking files, adding comments, and more. We conclude
with how to solve some common file problems that most users
encounter eventually. In the process, we get a little technical but not
overwhelmingly so. After all, the benefit of owning a Mac is that you
don’t need to be a rocket scientist to use it.
Understanding a File’s Properties
The files on your computer have many properties, such as name, exten-
sion, size, and type. You’ll work with filenames more than any other prop-
erty, but understanding and manipulating the other file properties
effectively is also important. Doing so can make the time that you spend
on your computer more efficient and secure.
Most of a file’s properties can be parameters for advanced searches
(see Technique 21).
You can discern some file properties, such as name, extension, size
(depending on how the window is customized), type, and default opening
application, just by looking at the file in the Finder (see Figure 20-1).

Technique 20: Working with Files
156
We discuss the Get Info panel extensively in this
technique (and you use it often in day-to-day Tiger
usage), so you really should get to know your way
around it. In this technique, we go through its sub-
parts and how they relate to you and your stuff.
Note that each item on the Get Info panel has a right-
pointing arrow next to it: Click that arrow to expand
its section and see more information, as shown in
Figure 20-2.
• Figure 20-2: Most of the Get Info panel’s subparts are
hidden until you expand them.
The General panel
The General panel shows you the basics, almost all
of which can appear in the list view mode of the
Finder window. The only three things that you can
change here are

Stationery Pad: If you select the Stationery Pad
check box, the currently selected file becomes a
template with its own special icon (see Figure
20-3). When you open a Stationery Pad file, Tiger
creates and opens a copy of it, allowing you to
work with the copy without altering the original.
• Figure 20-1: You can tell a lot about a file just by looking
at its name and icon in the Finder.
These and other properties are viewable and editable
in the Get Info panel. If you aren’t familiar with this
panel, it’s about time to become so. After you select a
file, you can bring up the Get Info panel by

Control-clicking and choosing Get Info from the
contextual menu.

Pressing Ô-I.

Choosing File➪Get Info.
Hold down the Option key while using one of
these methods to open an Inspector panel. It’s
almost exactly like the standard Get Info panel
except that it changes to represent the cur-
rently selected item. The standard Get Info
panel stays focused on the originally selected
item.

Understanding a File’s Properties
157
• Figure 20-3: Template files use a slight modification of
the default file type.

Locked: If you enable the Locked check box, the
file is safeguarded against changes or incidental
deletions. A locked file’s icon features a small
padlock (see the bottom file icon in Figure 20-4).
Locked files can be opened but not deleted nor
altered.
Lock a file to protect it from being changed or

The More Info panel
Tiger introduces the More Info section (see Figure
20-5). Although there’s nothing for you to change
here, it can be very useful. Depending on the item
you’ve selected, the More Info panel might display
the following:

The last time the item was opened

An image’s size in pixels (see Figure 20-5)

The original source of a downloaded file (see

• Figure 20-7: The Name & Extension section of a file’s Get
Info panel.
• Figure 20-5: The new More Info panel is below the
General panel.
The Name & Extension panel
You likely know what a file’s name is and what it
means. (If you don’t, perhaps it’s time you pick up
Bob Levitus’s Mac OS X Tiger For Dummies, Wiley
Publishing, Inc.) You can change a file’s name by
these three methods:

Click the filename (not the icon but the actual
filename) in the Finder and type the new name.

Select the item, press Return, and type the new
name.

Type the new name in the Name & Extension text
box of the Get Info panel (see Figure 20-7).

Understanding a File’s Properties
159
Tiger has very few rules for how to name a file, and
here they are:

Filenames shouldn’t begin with a period.

Filenames can’t contain a semicolon.

Filenames shouldn’t contain a slash.

The maximum filename length is 255 characters,
although you might not be able to see a filename
this large under many conditions.

Two files within the same directory can’t have
the same name.
Strangely enough, you can change the name
or even the location of a file without disrupt-
ing the Recent Documents listing in the Finder
and applications. This is because the operating
system uses a different method of referring to
files rather than the more obvious name and
location.
Although a file’s extension is an issue that has been
mostly hidden from Mac users over the years, it’s
critical for many reasons. The file’s extension (and
kind, which is related) dictates what application is
used by default to open it. (See “The Open With
panel” section.) You can change a file’s extension by

Changing the file’s name in the Finder, if the
extension is also shown
Hide or show a file’s extension by checking
the appropriate box in the Name & Extension
panel (refer to Figure 20-7).

Typing the filename and its new extension in the
Name & Extension section of the Get Info panel
When you change a file’s extension, Tiger displays a
prompt (see Figure 20-8) confirming whether you
truly want to make this change because it affects
what application opens it. Unfortunately, you can’t
avoid this prompt — Tiger is trying to behave in
your best interest. Most commonly, you might
change the extensions on text files, Web pages, and
downloaded files. Doing so isn’t really a problem —
primarily it just affects what application opens the
file by default — and you can also change the file’s
extension back, if necessary.
• Figure 20-8: Before you can change a file’s extension,
you must confirm the action through this
prompt.
The Open With panel
The Open With panel shows you what application
opens a file by default. The drop-down list also
allows you to change this setting for a particular file.
The Change All button lets you enact the change for
every file of this type. See Technique 25 for more
techniques for opening files.

The Preview panel, as you might expect, shows you
a preview of the file. For many file types (such as
text files, spreadsheets, and Web pages), you see
only the file’s icon. For image file types, this panel
shows a thumbnail of the image itself (see Figure
20-9). With movies and sound files, you can actually
play them by clicking the Play button of the preview
(the right-pointing triangle, Figure 20-10).
The Preview panel of the Get Info panel is
replicated by the column view mode of a
Finder window, where the final column is used
for the preview.

Technique 20: Working with Files
160
The Ownership & Permissions panel
The Ownership & Permissions panel of the Get Info
panel is its most complex panel because it’s based
on a UNIX concept. (See the “UNIX permissions”
sidebar if you really want to know more.) The first
rule for this area is to leave it alone unless you really
know what you’re doing.
Permissions are a sticky subject. Toying with
them without fully understanding the ramifica-
tions can affect the security and operability of
your system.
UNIX permissions
The UNIX operating systems have an elaborate set of per-
missions for files and folders based on who owns a file and
who can do what with it. The first issue you can control is
the specific user and group that owns a file.
By default, the owner of a file is whoever created it — in
Tiger, that means your short username for most of your
stuff. Permissions are also based on groups. Again, by
default, this is the group that the owner is a member of. Of
course, a user can be part of many different groups, too, in
which case one of those groups will be used.
The UNIX command for changing an owner — which must
be entered by using the Terminal — is
chown owner filename
Of course, you need to be an administrative-level user to
do this. To change the group, you use either of the follow-
ing commands:
chgrp group filename
chown owner:group filename
The second controllable file permissions issue is who can do
what with the file. The options are read, write, and execute (for
a file) or search (for a directory). Each of these options can be
specified for the owner, for the group, or for everyone. The
options for a specific file are represented in the Terminal by a
string of eight letters, as shown in the figure here. Starting from
the left, the first letter represents owner write, and the string is
read across in the following order: read, execute; group write,
read, execute; and everyone write, read, execute. A w means
writable, r means readable, and x means executable/search-
able. A dash means that the permission isn’t granted, and an
initial d indicates that the file is actually a directory.
• Figure 20-9: The preview of an image file.
• Figure 20-10: The preview of an MPEG or MP3 allows
you to play the sound file.

Understanding a File’s Properties
161
In the figure, for example, the file 558129 ch20.doc has
read permissions for everyone and write permissions for
larry. The owner is larry, who is part of the group larry.
Assuming that you have the permission to do so, you can
change permissions by using chmod. The syntax is
chmod permissions file
The permissions are assigned by using a three-digit num-
ber (although they can also be adjusted by using an alpha-
betic system). The first of the three numbers represents the
owner’s permission, the second is the group, and the third
is everyone else (others). Each number is made by adding
up the write permissions (worth 4), read permissions (2),
and search/execute permissions (1). A file with 777 permis-
sions is writable, readable, and executable by everyone. To
give yourself write and read permissions and everyone else
just read permissions on a file, use
chmod 622 filename
For more information on any of these tools, type man
chmod, man chgrp, or man chown in the Terminal.
The Spotlight Comments panel
Adding comments to files, folders, and applications
has been part of the Mac operating system for years,
although most people don’t use them much. Tiger
has two features that can make them more useful:
finding files by words in their comments with
Spotlight and showing comments in a Finder win-
dow. As an example:
1.
Select the file in the Finder.
2.
Press Ô-I to bring up the Get Info panel.
3.
Click the arrow for the Comments box if it isn’t
currently pointing down.
4.
In the box, type any comments that you want to
add (see Figure 20-11).
• Figure 20-11: Add comments to a file by using the Get
Info panel.
5.
Close the panel by clicking the red Close but-
ton in the upper-left corner.
6.
Set your window to list view by clicking the
icon in the toolbar or by pressing Ô-1.
7.
Customize the window settings by choosing
View➪Show View Options or by pressing Ô-J.
8.
In the list of options, enable the Comments
check box.
9.
Close the View Options panel by pressing Ô-J
or clicking the red Close button.
You should now see your comments in the
Finder window (see Figure 20-12).
• Figure 20-12: With Tiger, you can show comments in the
list view mode.
You can use comments to remind yourself of
the purpose or contents of a file. If a comment
is too long to view in the window, hover your
cursor over it to view the whole thing in a
pop-up window.

Technique 20: Working with Files
162
5.
Go ahead and delete the file as you normally
would.
If you don’t want to see the confirmation
prompt every time you go to empty the Trash,
disable the Show Warning Before Emptying
the Trash check box under the Finder’s
Advanced preferences.
Ejecting stuck disk images
A somewhat common occurrence is that you can’t
eject a disk image (whether a mounted hard drive, a
CD-ROM, or whatever). This usually happens because
Tiger thinks that the disk is currently in use. Even if
you promise Tiger that it isn’t, your options are lim-
ited. Here are three good ways of solving the problem:

Quit all open applications and try again.

Log out and log back in by using the Apple menu
or by pressing Ô-Shift-Q (but not by using Fast
User Switching).

Ignore the problem for now. The next time you
reboot, you’ll be able to eject the image without
issue.
A file can’t be deleted if it’s currently in use.
This is almost always because the application
that the file was being used in is still running
(and the file itself might still be open). Close
the file and application and try again.
Finding the original for an alias
If Tiger can’t find the original file that an alias refers
to, it gives you a prompt (see Figure 20-13) with
three options:
• Figure 20-13: The error prompt for when Tiger can’t find
an alias’s original file.
Finding out about files via shareware
If you really, really get into manipulating a file’s properties
(you know who you are), check out these shareware appli-
cations to facilitate the process:

Bare Bones’s Super Get Info (www.barebones.com,
$20) makes altering a file’s type (or kind) easier. It also
lets you work with invisible files and empty the Trash
even when the Finder says you can’t.

piDog Software’s InfoDog (www.pidog.com/infodog,
$10 suggested) is similar to Super Get Info but also has
a file browser built into it.

Marc likes File Buddy (www.skytag.com/filebuddy,
$40), which is like a Get Info tool and file utility all in
one. It not only helps you manage individual files but
also provides system-wide features and troubleshooting
techniques.
Solving Common File Problems
You likely won’t have too many problems when
dealing with files in your operating system, but they
will occur occasionally. Here’s your file-specific
troubleshooting guide:
You’ll minimize some problems by using the
Repair Disk Permissions tool in the Disk Utility.
Run this monthly on the hard drive that con-
tains the operating system for smoother sailing.
Deleting locked files
As a security feature, locked files can’t be trashed.
There is absolutely no keyboard shortcut to over-
ride this. The only way to delete a locked file is to
unlock it first.
1.
Select the file in the Finder.
2.
Press Ô-I to bring up the Get Info panel.
3.
Deselect the Locked check box to unlock it.
4.
Close the panel by clicking the red Close but-
ton in the upper-left corner.

Solving Common File Problems
163

Delete Alias: Obviously, this option gets rid of
the alias, which fixes the problem.

Fix Alias: If you select what’s behind door num-
ber two, you are presented with a window (see
Figure 20-14) so that you can select a new origi-
nal for this alias.
• Figure 20-14: You can use this dialog to navigate to the
file an alias should point to.

OK: If you click OK or press Return, nothing
happens.
You can also select a new original for an alias
(whether there’s a problem with it or not) by
clicking the Select New Original button under
the Get Info’s General panel (see Figure 20-15).
Sharing files with another OS
This technique isn’t really a problem-solver for Mac
users — because Tiger is such a great operating 
system — but rather for those less fortunate souls
not running Mac OS X. While sharing files on other
operating systems (whether through a network or a
disc), you can ease potential conflicts by abiding by
these rules:

Use filenames that are shorter than 32 charac-
ters in length.

Stick to alphanumeric characters in a filename.

Avoid using spaces in the filename. (Hint: Use an
underscore instead.)

Keep the file’s extension as part of the filename.
The last point is important because many oper-
ating systems used to or still do rely on a file’s
extension to know what application should be
used to open it.
• Figure 20-15: You can change the original for an alias by
pulling up the Get Info panel while the alias
is selected.

Finding Things 
in Tiger
R
egardless of how well you organize your stuff and how on top 
of things you stay, you inevitably go looking for something that
you just can’t find. Old-school Mac users might be familiar with
Sherlock (the file detective), and Panther users should know about the
Find tool, but Tiger has taken looking for stuff to a whole new level.
Tiger has done away with Sherlock and incorporated the Finder’s Find
utility into a Finder window. On top of this, Tiger has added the truly
amazing Spotlight utility and the ability to save searches as Smart
Folders.
The most frequently used search method is the Search box, present in
the Finder windows. This is an easy and fast way to locate what you
need. On a more advanced level, you can use the Finder’s Find tool,
which is an extension of the basic Finder window search. From there we
unfold Smart Folders, which are saved searches, like Smart Playlists in
iTunes. Next we introduce our latest love, Spotlight. Spotlight is to
searching what the Great Wall of China is to decorative lawn edging.
Basic Finder Window Searches
For simple searches, you can’t beat the Finder windows. Although the
search capability has been part of the Finder window for some time,
Tiger has added some new features. The Search box, by default, appears
in the upper-right corner of the Finder window (see Figure 21-1).
21
Technique
• Figure 21-1: The Finder
window Search
box.

Basic Finder Window Searches
165
Use the Search box to perform a case-insensitive
search on the names of the folders, files, and appli-
cations located on your hard drives. The Finder win-
dow search turns up any match found anywhere in a
name. For example, searching for cat brings up files
such as Catalog.pdf, subcat.php, or Pictures of My
Cats. Even better, the search returns documents with
the word cat (or variations of it) in them!
If you can’t see the Search box because the
window is too narrow — but you know it’s
there — click the double right-facing arrows 
in the upper-right corner and then choose
Search from the menu that appears (see
Figure 21-2).
• Figure 21-2: If the Search box disappears, you can
retrieve it with the double arrows.
To use the Search box:
1.
Click in the Search box and begin typing the
name of the file or folder that you want to
locate.
Alternatively, you can use the Ô-Option-F key-
board shortcut to select the Search box.
If you don’t have a Search box in your win-
dow’s toolbar, you can customize the toolbar
to add it (see Technique 12). If the current 
window doesn’t have a toolbar at all, choose
View➪Show Toolbar.
The Finder instantly begins searching your hard
drive. Even so, you can continue to type in the
full file or folder name.
2.
If you see the file that you’re looking for before
the search is finished, click the Stop button
(which bears an X) in the lower-right corner of
the window to stop the search.
While the Finder continues its search, it shows
the results in the top panel and the status in the
bottom of the window.
A new feature in Tiger is that search results are
now grouped by kind. So all the AppleScripts
that match the search are grouped together, as
are all the images, applications, and so forth. To
hide any kind of group, just click the triangle
next to the group name.
3.
To cancel the search, click the Stop button (the X)
in the Search box.
Clicking the Stop button in the Search box stops
the search, wipes out any results, and returns
the Finder window to its previous directory.
4.
After the search is completed or you’ve stopped
it, scroll through the results to see which files
matched the search (see Figure 21-3).
• Figure 21-3: The search results, organized by file type.
Attempting to scroll through the search
results, let alone open one of these files, while
the search is still going is a pain because the
window and its contents keep changing. We


Open any file, application, image, or what-have-
you by double-clicking it.

If you didn’t find the file you want, try a differ-
ent search term or use the Find window for a
more advanced search.
You can also further alter your searches by clicking
the plus symbol to the right of the Save button. This
lets you add criteria to your searches, turning this
into a more formal Find, which you discover more
about if you keep reading.
Using a Find Window
For more sophisticated searches, use Finder’s built-
in Find command. This has replaced Sherlock’s Find
Files feature (if you used Macs that far back). It’s
accessible by using the universal Ô-F keyboard
shortcut or by choosing File➪Find in the Finder. Find
in Tiger just takes the simple window search several
steps further.
The Find tool lets you establish multiple parameters
for your search beyond just the file’s name or its
recommend either stopping the search if you
see what you were looking for or waiting for it
to complete.
When it comes time to review the search results,
keep these tips in mind:

To limit your search to a specific area, click the
labels at the top of the results window (see
Figure 21-4). By default, you can search in three
areas: Servers, Computer, and Home. If you store
all your stuff within your Home directory (as you
should be doing), clicking the Home button
should appropriately limit your search.
• Figure 21-4: The results shown in Figure 21-3 have been
restricted to my Home folder.

To find out more about a particular result, click
it once to select it. You see the item’s location —
called its path — at the bottom of the search
window.

To get more information about most items, click
the Get Info icon on the right side of the window
(see Figure 21-5). The Get Info icon is the light
blue circle with a lowercase i in it. You’ll see these
along the right side of window. Alternatively, if
you’ve added a Get Info option to your window’s
toolbar (see the solid blue circle with the white i
at the top of the window), you can click it.

To see a slideshow of the matching images,
click the Play icon in the Images bar.
Image results can be listed in either icon or 
list view, by using the buttons in the Images
title bar.

contents. You can even use ranges and conditionals
with many of the parameters, greatly expanding the
possibilities.
For starters, use the row of locations at the top 
to choose what parts of the computer should 
be searched (see Figure 21-6). By default, your
options are
• Figure 21-6: The Find Finder window.

Servers: Includes all mounted volumes, such as
CD-ROMs and even mounted servers.

Computer: Includes all the hard drives on the
computer.

Home: This, sensibly enough, is just your Home
Directory.
If you don’t specify an area to search, Tiger
searches every place it can think of. You can
limit your search to a specific folder by navi-
gating to that folder and then pressing Ô-F.
That folder is then listed as an option label at
the top of the Find window.
Underneath the search locations are parameters you
can set. By default, the Find window opens with two
default parameters. You can easily add more by click-
ing the plus sign or subtract one by clicking the
minus sign. For each item, you use the drop-down list
to select your first criteria. Then, more drop-down
lists or text boxes appear, letting you add more
details to that search (for example, a part of a name
or a range for a date).
The available criteria include

Kind: The Kind drop-down list lets you limit the
search to whether the file is of a certain type.
The list of types is alias, application, folder, docu-
ment, sound (audio file), image, or movie.
The second Kind menu lets you choose spe-
cific kinds of items: documents, images, PDFs,
music, and so on. It also has an Others option,
where you can specify very particular kinds,
like an alias, a Photoshop gradient, or an iCal
To-Do item. These options are based on the
kinds of files and information found on 
your Mac.

Last Opened, Date Modified, or Date Created
Dates: If you have a sense of one of these three
dates as they relate to the desired item, this is a
great way to locate it. In the Find tool, you can
use
 The first drop-down list to select which date
you want to work with
 The second list to decide whether the file
should have a specific date or fall within a
range
 Use the third list (if given the option) for set-
ting that range
Using dates, you can search for a file whose rele-
vant date is
 Today
 Within a certain time period relative to today
(see Figure 21-7)
 Before a particular date
 After a particular date
 On a particular date

Keywords: Keywords are what’s known as meta-
data, information used to describe a thing. A key-
word might be Image or Document.

Label: If you use the Labels feature, you can also
search over whether the file has a particular
label. See Technique 11 for more.

Technique 21: Finding Things in Tiger
168
choose megabytes or gigabytes from the third
menu that appears. 

Other: This might be the most specific option you
can choose, but you have to really know what
you’re looking for to use it. When you select
Other, a sheet appears with a vast list of criteria
(see Figure 21-9). From here you can factor in
such things as: the number of pages in a docu-
ment; the ISO speed that was used to take a digital
image with a camera; or a specific font. Note that
this Other is different from the Other in the Kind
drop-down list, which lists different kinds of files,
not their properties like this Other does.
• Figure 21-9: The Other options with which you can
search.
Because Other offers so many search attrib-
utes, you can literally search the Other search
list! Use the Search box in the upper-right cor-
ner of the Other sheet to quicken the hunt.
Mark any Other criteria as a favorite and it’s a
quick option in your list of search criteria.
The following section shows an example of a Find
search, which you then save as a Smart Folder.
Working With Smart Folders
All in all, Tiger is a whole lot smarter than Panther.
You now have Smart Mailboxes and Smart Albums
and Smart Groups (in the Address Book) and, in the
• Figure 21-7: The date drop-down lists are very flexible,
allowing you to specify dates or a range.

Filename: Unlike the window Search box, the
Name text box gives you the secondary option of
selecting whether the entered text should start,
end, exactly match, or simply be in a matched
filename (see Figure 21-8). With this, you can
more effectively fine-tune the returned results.
• Figure 21-8: The drop-down lists let you further limit a
search.

Contents: The Find by Contents feature searches
through the contents of a file (for example, a
Word document, a plain text file, or even an
HTML page) for matching text. This is clearly the
most exhaustive search that you can execute.

Size: If you know the approximate size of the item
in question, you can add a size is greater than or
size is less than search criterion. Unfortunately,
you can’t add two size options at the same time
to create a range of acceptable values. The size
text box is listed in kilobytes but you can also

Finder, Smart Folders. Like anything else that’s
“Smart,” the premise is that you save a set of criteria
as the definition of that folder’s contents. As the
stuff on your computer changes, the contents of this
folder are dynamically updated to represent the cur-
rent status.
Pay attention to this little detail: Smart Folders
contain aliases to stuff that’s located elsewhere
on your computer. It doesn’t contain the actual
stuff. So, if a Smart Folder tracks images of a
certain size, the images that fit the size range
appear in the Smart Folder, but those are just
aliases. You still find the real images in their
original location on the computer.
Smart Folders are just saved searches, so this exam-
ple shows you how to create a Smart Folder that
lists the most recently viewed Microsoft Office 
documents:
1.
Open a Find window by either pressing Ô-F in
the Finder or choosing File➪Find.
2.
Click the Home button at the top of the window
to narrow the search.
3.
For the first criteria, select Kind and 
then Documents from the second list (see
Figure 21-10).
You could also select Other from the second list
and then specify a document type, such as
Microsoft Word document.
4.
For the second criteria, select Last Opened
from the first list and select This Week from the
second list.
5.
Click Save.
6.
At the prompt (see Figure 21-11), save the
search by taking the following actions:
a. Give it an appropriate name.
b. Save it where it makes the most sense.
c. Decide whether you want this Smart Folder in
your Sidebar.
• Figure 21-10: Use the Kind criteria to search specific
documents.
• Figure 21-11: Use this prompt to create your Smart
Folder.
By placing the most useful Smart Folders in
the Sidebar of your Finder windows, you make
them universally accessible. With this method,
your Smart Folders also appear in the Open/
Save dialogs in any application.
7.
To change the criteria for a Smart Folder, open
it in the Finder, and then click the Edit button.

Preferences by choosing this last item from the
basic search results window. You can also access
it by going to the Spotlight System Preferences
panel. If you don’t want Spotlight searching for
certain things (such as Applications, Movies, or
System Preferences), deselect the appropriate
check boxes here to exclude those items from
searches (see Figure 21-14).

Change the Spotlight keyboard shortcut if it
conflicts with exiting software. Third-party
launching tools, like QuickSilver and LaunchBar,
use the Ô-Space keyboard shortcut. If you use an
application that already looks for Ô-Space,
change the assigned shortcut either in that appli-
cation or for Spotlight, again using the System
Preferences panel.
Searching for Things

your display (at the end of the menu bar). But
enough talk. Start using it!
1.
Click the Spotlight icon.
2.
Enter a term (or terms) in the Spotlight Search
box (see Figure 21-12).
3.
Assuming you found what you were looking
for, you now have two options:
 Quickly selecting it by clicking the item in 
the list.
 Clicking the Show All link to bring up the
Spotlight results window (see Figure 21-13).
4.
The next time you click Spotlight, the previous
results are still there, so click the X to clear them.
It’s really that simple! But you can improve upon
your Spotlight success by doing these things:

Memorize the two keyboard shortcuts to
quickly access Spotlight. By default, you can
launch and access Spotlight by pressing Ô-Space.
You can go straight to the Show All search results
window by using Ô-Option-Space.

Restrict Spotlight access to specific directories
by using the Privacy pane. Also under Spotlight’s
System Preferences (see Figure 21-14) is a section
where you can tell Spotlight what folders it
shouldn’t search. If you don’t want items in certain
directories showing up in searches, don’t give
Spotlight that option.

Alter search criteria in the Show All search
results box. The Spotlight search results are dis-
played by group, as they are in a Finder window

Your Hard Drive
I
t never fails to happen: All that extra space you thought you’d never
fill up is suddenly gone. Sadly, that’s just as true whether you’re talking
about a new house, apartment, or that 60GB hard drive that you
believed would allow you to download the whole Internet to your com-
puter. Eventually, the time comes to either clean house or upgrade.
Knowing what you can get rid of and how to do it saves you the time and
expense of upgrading a hard drive (and makes your computer perform
slightly better). This begins with doing nothing: that is, not installing
applications and files that you won’t use. After that, you need to look at
getting rid of the files on your hard drive that you no longer need. You
can do this manually with a little prudent knowledge. Third-party appli-
cations are also available to help you remove the hidden system files you
no longer need. Finally, we send up some warning flares to remind you of
the things that you absolutely, positively shouldn’t get rid of.
Avoiding Unnecessary Installations
During the Tiger installation process, you can customize your installation
so that only the features you need are installed. A new Tiger installation
can take anywhere from a few hundred megabytes to multiple gigabytes.
Because you can’t easily uninstall parts of Tiger, you’re better off not
installing them in the first place — assuming you won’t need them, that
is. The worst offenders, in terms of hard drive space, are

Printer drivers: Tiger supports many common printers — which is
great — but it does so at a huge cost of hard drive space. Installing all
the printer drivers would take nearly 1GB. This is definitely one area
where you should use some judgment about what to install and what
to leave out. Three good options are
 If you don’t have a printer, don’t install any printer drivers.
 If you have a printer, see whether the manufacturer provides a
driver for your specific model by checking the support, software, or
22
Technique

drivers section of its Web site. That driver
might be only a few megabytes in size and
therefore much smaller than the one-size-fits-
all driver provided by Apple for that manufac-
turer’s printers.
 If the printer manufacturer doesn’t provide a
driver for your specific model, install only the
drivers for your make of printer.

Language Translations: Language Translations
allow your Mac to display system controls (menus
and such) in languages other than English.
Although it’s great that Apple recognizes the
global, multilingual community, if all the people
using your computer speak the same language,
avoid Language Translations. These take 400 or
more megabytes.

Fonts: Tiger can install fonts for you to use a
dozen non–Indo-European languages with your
Mac. These fonts enable you to read Japanese,
Chinese, Korean, and other languages in your
applications. Naturally, if you don’t see that
happening, you don’t need to install these 
fonts.
Be prudent when installing applications. Most
installers give you the option of customizing the
installation process (as Photoshop does in Figure
22-1) so that unnecessary pieces don’t clutter up
your computer. As a general rule, hard drive-hogging
applications — for example, Adobe Photoshop or
Apple’s Final Cut Pro — give you more flexibility to
customize installation.
Many installers, including Tiger, allow you to
dictate what gets installed. If you won’t use
something, don’t install it. If you later realize
that you need something you didn’t install,
you can always add it by running the installer
again.
• Figure 22-1: Many installers let you customize the
installation itself.
Weeding Your Hard Drive:
Manually Deleting Files
As a general rule, Mac OS X doesn’t use uninstallers
for the operating system or for individual applica-
tions. Thus, after you’ve installed the junk . . . er,
files . . . on your computer and realize that you no
longer need them, you must delete them manually.
You might want to do some judicious weeding in
these four general areas: your Home folder, the
Applications folder, the System folder, and other disk
drives and partitions.
Use Ô-Delete to send a selected item (or items)
to the Trash.
Back up the contents of your computer before
going hog-wild deleting items that you believe
to be unnecessary. A good backup makes
restoring items a snap if you inadvertently
delete something important in your house-
cleaning frenzy. See Technique 49 for every-
thing you need to know about backups.

Technique 22: Slimming Down Your Hard Drive
174
Although an archive can cut down on the amount of space a
file takes up, it won’t work on every type of file. Specifically,
PDFs, movies, and some image types are not compressible.
Thinning out no-longer-required applications
Applications can take up a huge amount of space on
your computer. If you’re actually using the applica-
tions, it’s no big deal. But after you’ve stopped play-
ing a certain game or found a better alternative to an
application, you might want to get rid of it. Because
you normally won’t find an uninstaller for an applica-
tion, here are the steps to take:
1.
Locate the application’s file or folder within the
Applications directory.
Simple applications are wrapped in a single icon,
which can be deleted (such as Internet Explorer).
More involved applications have their own fold-
ers (for example, Netscape Navigator).
2.
Move the file or folder to a temporary location.
Instead of deleting the files immediately, we rec-
ommend temporarily setting them aside as a
just-in-case measure. You can either
 Create a folder on the Desktop for this purpose.
 Move them onto an external driver or CD.
3.
Open the Library folder of your Home directory.
If you really want to clean house, get rid of the
corresponding application stuff that was placed
within your directory. This includes supporting
materials and preferences.
4.
Check these folders folder for files associated
with the application and move any applicable
items to the temporary folder:
 Application Support: Only a few applications
have files here, but if you want to be thorough,
it’s worth checking out.
 Preferences: Pretty much every application
adds at least one file to your Preferences
folder. Although these files are small, they’re
still worth getting rid of.
Pruning your Home directory
Your Home directory is where you’re most likely to
get rid of extraneous stuff. Fortunately for you, it’s
generally the safest place to make cuts as well.
Here’s what you can do:

Clean up the contents of your Desktop folder.

Delete anything that you no longer want in the
Documents folder.

Free up some space in the Movies, Music, and
Pictures folders.
If you actively use iPhoto, your Home direc-
tory can quickly fill up with pictures. When
you have 650MB or more of photos, burn a
CD (or two, for safe keeping) of your albums,
and then delete these files from your hard
drive to save space.

Get rid of anything that you don’t want in the
Public folder unless it’s still needed by others on
your computer or network.

Remove files from the Sites directory. The Sites
directory is where you store Web pages. These
directories become easily cluttered with old ver-
sions of files. Remove them to save some room
here and there.
If the contents of the Movies, Music, or Pictures
folders are managed by iMovie, iTunes, or
iPhoto, you’ll be better off deleting these files
from within those applications because they
have associations with the physical files.
The archive alternative
If you like the idea of keeping all your stuff on your Mac
but don’t like how much space it requires, try archiving 
old files. Any file that you don’t access frequently but still
want kept around can be compressed by using the Finder’s
Create Archive tool (under the File menu). If you later need
to access an archived file, double-clicking the archive
expands it for you.

Weeding Your Hard Drive: Manually Deleting Files
175
5.
Wait a few days. Then, if you don’t see any
problems caused by moving these files, delete
the temporary folder.
A fast way to max out your hard drive is to
perpetually download and install demos and
shareware. Game demos are particularly large.
Personally, we don’t install shareware or demos
of applications that we don’t reasonably expect
to buy. Doing so only wastes time and clutters
up the hard drive.
If you installed an application, you should be
able to safely remove it. Applications installed
by Tiger shouldn’t be messed with. This
includes items in the Applications folder such
as System Preferences and Internet Connect.
Cleaning out your System and Library folders
If you check out the size of your system files, stored
both in the Library and the System folders, you’ll see
that they take up a lot of space (in Figure 22-2). That
being said, you don’t want to go traipsing through
there to remove files. The reward for clearing up some
room is normally slight, but the risk that you take will
be grave. As the worst case, you would trash some-
thing that renders your computer inoperable. For the
most part, you’re better off leaving these files alone.
Some applications also store resources in the
/Library/Application Support folder.
Although you need to be extra careful when
deleting stuff from this directory, doing so can
pay off. For example, GarageBand — which we
love having but rarely play with — takes up
55MB for the application itself and 2.1GB (!!!)
for sound files in the /Library/Application
Support folder.
However, here’s one thing that you can do with sys-
tem files: If you performed an Archive and Install
installation of Tiger, the installer creates a Previous
Systems folder to store the old system files. If every-
thing’s running okay with the new operating system,
you can delete this entire folder.
• Figure 22-2: A minimal installation of Tiger can put at
least 1GB of files in the System folder.
Don’t remove anything (anything!) from the
System or the Library folders unless you really,
really know what you’re doing and have backed
up the entire computer.
Cleaning other volumes
Some computer users have already established multi-
ple volumes for their computer. This is accomplished
by either

Installing extra hard drives 

Partitioning larger hard drives into separate 
volumes
If you’ve done this, you’re probably using the other
volumes purely for storage purposes (because the
main volume is running the operating system and
should have your Home directory). Your other 
volumes, therefore, are a good place to get rid of 
no-longer-needed files.

Technique 22: Slimming Down Your Hard Drive
176

OmniDiskSweeper, by the good people at the
Omni Group (www.omnigroup.com, $15), offers a
good bang for very little buck. It basically repli-
cates the process of going through the Finder
and removing large files but gives you a nicer
interface. It also warns you about deleting poten-
tially critical files.

mrclean (http://arcobaleno2001.interfree.it,
free) searches your computer for duplicate files
(based on filename, file size, type, and so on).
Often these are sizable documents such as MP3s,
images, and movies.
Be certain to check out the utilities that Technique
54 lists. Besides performing routine maintenance,
many help with disk bloat by weeding out hard-to-
find system files and logs.
Hands Off: What Not to Trash
You might be the type who’ll gladly spend a day tin-
kering just to clear up a little space, but here are
some rules that you should never break:

Don’t delete or rename the Applications or
Utilities folders.

Don’t delete or rename your Home folder.

Don’t delete or rename the Desktop or Library
folders in your Home directory.

Don’t touch the System or Library folders.
The consequences of doing one of the mentioned
Don’ts range from an inability to launch an applica-
tion, to an inability to login, to an inability to boot
into your Mac! Do you want to take that risk? We
thought not.
Classic and OS 9
If you’re still running Classic or dual-booting into OS 9
(gasp!), you can trim down files particular to that operating
system. Some considerations include the following:

Drop OS 9 applications for which there are good OS
X alternatives. There’s no reason to keep two applica-
tions that do the same thing.

If you’re using Classic, there are many system exten-
sions that you won’t be using. For example, if you
won’t be using QuickTime or a printer within Classic,
you can drop many megabytes of deadwood. Getting
rid of these saves space and makes Classic launch
faster.

Keep all your files within your OS X Home directory.
You can still access them from OS 9.

Best of all, get rid of OS 9 and Classic as soon as pos-
sible, and then delete all those files!
Diet Tools: Third-Party
Applications
If you’d rather spend your weekend cleaning the 
attic and not your hard drive, you can invest in one
of many third-party applications that facilitate the
process. (The process of cleaning up your hard drive,
that is. You’re on your own when it comes to cleaning
up the attic.) In truth, these applications make more
of a quantitative than a qualitative decision. Whereas
you might know that you no longer need a particular
document or no longer like a particular song (an MP3
file), the following tools earmark files whose size and
lack of use might merit removal:

Improving Application
Performance

Launching
Applications Fast
Y
ou might think that opening (or launching, starting, or however
you want to say it) an application is so simple that you couldn’t
possibly improve on it. But surprisingly, you can use many tech-
niques and tools to improve on this common procedure. Putting some
time and effort into mastering the easiest ways to open applications goes
a long way toward expediting how you use your computer.
The first timesaving technique is to have Tiger automatically open an
application when you log in to the computer. Then we go over the multi-
tude of ways you can launch applications (such as from the Finder or
Dock), some of which you probably already know. Finally, you read about
a couple shareware tools designed to open applications in faster ways.
Auto-Launching with the Accounts Panel
The Accounts panel, which is part of your System Preferences, does
more than just allow you to manage the computer’s users. You can also
pop open the Accounts panel to adjust some of the computer’s behavior
for their accounts. The relevant subsection for opening applications is
the Login Items panel. Follow these steps to access it: 
1.
Select System Preferences from the Apple menu.
This opens the System Preferences application.
2.
Click Accounts under the System heading.
This opens the Accounts panel, where you want to be.
3.
Click your account in the left column of the Accounts panel to
select it.
4.
Click the Login Items tab (see Figure 23-1).

Technique 23: Launching Applications Fast
180
• Figure 23-2: This is the slow way to add applications to
Login Items.
After you add an item to this listing, you can choose
to have it open in hidden mode by marking the
check box next to its name (as shown in Figure 23-3).
Hiding a Login Item just means that the application
will be hidden when you log in. Essentially, it will be
as if you opened the application and then selected
Hide Application from the application menu. This is a
good option for behind-the-scenes utilities that you
don’t need to be aware of.
• Figure 23-3: Enable an application’s check box to hide it
after it’s opened.
• Figure 23-1: Use Login Items to automatically launch
applications.
Technique 2 includes a brief introduction to
using Login Items. Because it’s such a useful
idea, we cover it again, and more thoroughly,
here.
To make a program launch automatically when you
log in to your computer, add it to the Login Items
list. You can add items to the Login Items list in two
ways:

The slow way:
1. Click the plus button at the bottom of the
panel to access an Open dialog.
2. Navigate to the application you want to add
and select it (see Figure 23-2).
3. Click the Add button or press Return.

Drag an application’s icon from its folder onto
the Login Items panel.
The quickest way to add applications to the
Login Items panel is to drag them there from
the Finder.

Launching with the Finder
181
To remove an application from the Login Items panel,
you have only one method:
1.
Select the item in the list by clicking it.
2.
Click the minus button at the bottom of the 
window to remove the item.
You might be wondering, “How do I decide what
applications to automatically start?” The answer to
this depends on what kind of computer you have
and how you use it.
If you have a laptop, you probably don’t want to
overdo it with Login Items. But most Mac users will
benefit from these rules:

Add utilities and shareware that provide perpetu-
ally necessary services (for example, LaunchBar
or system clock replacements).

Add applications that you’ll always use first thing
on your computer (such as Mail or Eudora).
If you set your e-mail client to open first and
you have an always-on Internet connection
(cable, DSL, whatever), your Mac can download
your e-mail while it’s continuing to open other
applications. When all is said and done, your
apps will be up and your mail will be waiting
for you.

Include applications that you use every day (like
Safari or iTunes).

Add utilities that you should run on a daily basis
(maybe Virex or Backup).

Add applications that take a long time to load
(like Photoshop) if there’s a good chance you’ll
use them on a nearly daily basis.
Many applications, such as Virex, have options
within their preferences panels (see Figure
23-4) that have a similar effect to adding the
application to the Accounts panel Login Items
listing. Use the preferences panel to add these
to your Login Items list (because, in this particu-
lar case, the item being added is the VirexLogin
utility, not Virex itself).
• Figure 23-4: You can set up virus utilities to automatically
scan at startup.
Launching with the Finder
Even though you can launch applications in the
Finder, knowing all your options can go a long way
toward speeding up this very common task.
The fastest way to open an application is to
never shut it down. Because of how Mac OS X
handles memory, you’ll notice very little per-
formance loss by keeping applications open,
and you’ll never have to wait for the applica-
tion to launch again. 
The most common (but not necessarily the most
convenient) way of opening an application is to use
Finder windows. You can either

Navigate your way to the Applications directory.

Set up your preferences so that the Applications
folder is automatically listed in the Finder win-
dow’s left-side section (see Figure 23-5).

Technique 23: Launching Applications Fast
182
You can launch an application by opening a
file that uses that application as its default, by
dragging the file onto the application’s icon, or
by using the contextual menu’s Open With
prompt. We go into great detail about ways to
open files in Technique 25.
Here’s a common sequence for easily opening an
application by using only the keyboard:
1.
Navigate to the Finder by pressing Ô-Tab.
2.
Press Ô-Shift-A to bring up the Applications
directory.
3.
Type the first few letters of the application’s
name to highlight it.
4.
If necessary, press Tab to go to the next appli-
cation (if it wasn’t highlighted in Step 3).
5.
If you need to open the application’s folder,
press Ô-O (in icon view mode) or Ô-→(in list
and column view modes).
6.
After you select the application, press Ô-O to
open it.
Launching with the Dock
The Dock can serve many purposes (such as linking
files and folders or displaying the Trash), but the left
side of the Dock is strictly for your applications.
This area is where open applications reside (flagged
by an upward-pointing triangle, as shown in Figure
23-7), as well as any other application that can be
permanently linked there.
• Figure 23-7: The Dock indicates open applications with a
black triangle.
• Figure 23-5: Among the locations that can be listed in the
Finder window Sidebar is the Applications
directory.
Technique 12 has instructions on customizing the
Finder windows and Sidebars.
After you find your way to the application and select
its icon, you can launch the application in many
ways. Here are your options, listed from easiest to
most time-consuming:

Double-click the icon.

Press Ô-O.

Press Ô-↓.

Control-click the application and choose Open
from the contextual menu.

Choose Open from the Finder’s File menu.
If you add an application’s icon to the Finder
window’s toolbar (such as BBEdit, Safari, and
Word in Figure 23-6), you can launch the
application by clicking the icon, which then
appears in every Finder window by default.
You can place applications in the toolbar by
dragging their icons to it from the Finder (see
Technique 12).
• Figure 23-6: Add icons for critical applications to your
Finder window’s toolbar.

Launching with the Dock
183
Here are two things to consider with respect to
applications and your Dock:

What applications to dock there

How best to arrange the docked items
As a general rule, dock every application that you
use on a frequent basis. Considering all the ways you
have to access applications, making sure the right
applications are docked should be obvious to you.
What’s more important is the organization scheme
you choose. Larry prefers to organize his Dock this
way, as shown in Figure 23-8:
• Figure 23-8: Larry’s Dock (in case you’re curious).

Keep perpetually running, but infrequently
accessed, utilities on the far left.

Keep applications with similar uses grouped
together (such as Web development tools or 
multimedia software).

Place the applications that you use most often as
close to the middle of the Dock as possible.

Items in the center of the Dock seem to have a
more stable location. When the Dock expands
and contracts, these items move around less on
your screen.
Marc has the following suggestions (see Figure 23-9):
• Figure 23-9: Marc’s Dock.

Dock a select few items that are always running,
such as System Preferences, CPU Monitor, and
LaunchBar.

Dock the essential iApps from Apple: Safari, iCal
(whose Dock icon also reminds you of today’s
date when the application is open), Mail, and
Address Book.

Add the productivity applications, depending on
what kind of work you do with your Mac. Because
Marc is a software engineer, the productivity
applications that he uses most often are the
Terminal, BBEdit, Xcode, and so forth. If you’re a
graphic designer, you’d probably have things like
Photoshop, Illustrator, or InDesign here instead. If
you’re working with the bread-and-butter applica-
tions, it’s the place for Word, Excel, PowerPoint,
and so on.

Dock entertainment applications, such as iPhoto,
iTunes, and iChat.
Marc’s main goal is to have stable positions for the
items that he needs to reach most often. After a
while, you get a feeling for where in the Dock a par-
ticular application is located, and you can find it
instinctively with the mouse, just like menu items on
the menu bar.
Here’s what you need to know about working with
the Dock:

To dock an item, drag its icon to the Dock from
the Finder.
When you do so, the other Dock items make way
for their new roommate.

To remove any Dock item — particularly all
those that Apple installs there by default — drag
its icon off the Dock (while it isn’t running).

You can add any currently running application to
the Dock by dragging its icon from one location
to another or by Control-clicking the Dock icon
and selecting the Keep in Dock option from its
contextual menu.

The Finder icon will always be on the far-left side
of the Dock. It can’t be moved nor removed. The
same applies to the Trash on the far right.

Running applications that aren’t always part of
your Dock will be added to the right side of the
Dock.
If you remove an icon from the Dock while the
application is running, the item will be removed
from its permanent location in the Dock even
though it will look like it’s still there (because it’s
running).

Technique 23: Launching Applications Fast
184
Recent Items
After you close an application, you can reopen it
from the Recent Items submenu under the Apple
menu (see Figure 23-11). To adjust how many items
are listed here, use the Appearance panel under
System Preferences.
• Figure 23-11: Recently used applications are listed in the
Recent Items menu.
Launching with Shareware Tools
Many third-party applications exist explicitly for the
purpose of launching other applications.
LaunchBar (www.obdev.at/products/launchbar, $20
for personal use, free for limited use) is a utility
designed to always run on your computer. The first
time it runs, it logs every application on your hard
drive (along with your files, Safari bookmarks,
Address Book contacts, and more). To launch an
application, you simply
1.
Press Ô-spacebar to bring up LaunchBar.
Ô-spacebar is also set to launch Spotlight. If
you’ve changed the LaunchBar shortcut, use
your new one instead.
Other Ways to Launch
Applications
Although the Finder and the Dock are the most fre-
quently used way of launching applications, they
certainly aren’t your only options. Favorites, aliases,
and Recent Items are all timesavers for this task.
Favorites and aliases
Another way to launch your applications is to create
aliases of them and place those aliases in convenient
locations. This is the principle behind Favorites, a
feature worth using. (Check out Technique 17 for
coverage of Favorites and aliases.)
If you add a slew of applications (perhaps organized
by purpose) to your Favorites, you can then dock
your Favorites folder and quickly launch these apps
(see Figure 23-10).
• Figure 23-10: The Favorites folder functions as a
hierarchical menu in the Dock.

Launching with Shareware Tools

2.
Type the keyboard shortcut for the application
in question (what you type will appear in the
LaunchBar prompt).
For example:
 M for Mail
 ME for Microsoft Excel
 S for Safari
 BB for BBEdit
 PH for Photoshop
3.
Select the application that you want to launch
from the list if it isn’t already highlighted (see
Figure 23-12).
4.
Press Return to launch the application.
• Figure 23-12: LaunchBar presents a list of potential
candidates.
Alternative launching utilities
Here are some popular alternatives to LaunchBar that offer
similar functionality. Although we adore LaunchBar, you
might appreciate the lower price (sometimes free) and dif-
ferent feature sets of these applications.

HimmelBar (http://softbend.free.fr/
himmelbar/index.html, donationware) creates a
menu bar icon that provides customizable lists. With it,
you can access applications and more without going
through Finder windows.

Quicksilver (http://quicksilver.blacktree.
com, free), like LaunchBar, provides keystroke access
to applications and other things on your Mac.

XBar (http://macosx.syr.edu/spotted
software/XBar.html, free) is like a mini-Dock 
whose sole purpose is to launch applications.

DragThing (www.dragthing.com, $29) also dupli-
cates the Dock but on a very advanced level, letting
you create multiple, customized Docks so that each
can serve a different purpose (like list a different set or
category of applications).

Namely (http://homepage.mac.com/asagoo/
namely/index.html, free) is like a more minimal
version of LaunchBar, letting you launch applications
by entering very simple abbreviations.

F10 Launch Studio (http://chronosnet.com, $29)
is strictly an application-launching utility but automati-
cally finds your applications and has a beautiful 
interface.

Save Time By
 Switching among open
applications
 Hiding open applications
 Delving into all the ways
to quit open applications
Switching, Hiding,
and Quitting
Applications
U
nderstanding how to launch applications (see Technique 23) is
useful — but still something you’ll probably do only once a day
per application. You’ll probably spend a lot more time switching
among open applications, hiding them, and (when the time is right) quit-
ting them.
In this technique, we take you through the best, fastest, and easiest ways
to work with your open applications. We begin with switching: how to
effectively toggle from one application to another. After that, we quickly
address hiding open applications (which overlaps a bit with switching)
and quitting them.
Switching among Open Applications
Because you’ll probably have about a half-dozen applications open at all
times, being able to quickly switch from one to another is a critical skill
to master. Several methods for application switching are built into the
operating system, and you can also make use of third-party tools to
expand the possibilities.
Switching apps with Tiger
Perhaps the best way to switch from one open application to another is
to use the Ô-Tab keyboard technique. We cover this in other techniques,
but it bears repeating:
1.
Press and hold down the Ô key.
2.
While continuing to hold down the Ô key, press the Tab key once to
bring up the list of open applications (as shown in Figure 24-1).
• Figure 24-1: Pressing Ô-Tab presents you with a list of open applications.

Technique

Switching among Open Applications
187
3.
Continue holding down the Ô key and tab to
the application you want:
 Press Tab to sequentially highlight each open
application (they’ll be in order of most
recently on down). Each time you press Tab,
the next application is selected.
In Figure 24-2, the Finder is highlighted.
• Figure 24-2: The currently highlighted icon is surrounded
by a white border and displays its name
beneath it. 
Using the Ô-Tab technique cycles through the
open applications in the order of most recent
usage. The application that you were using
before the current, active one is highlighted
first . . . then the one before that and so forth.
If you just want to switch back and forth
between two applications, quickly press and
release Ô-Tab once.
 To select an application in reverse order,
press Shift-Tab.
4.
After you highlight the application that you
want to switch to, release the Ô key to make it
active.
To abort the application switching, press the
Escape key at any time while still holding
down the Ô key.
Mac OS X also has a nice variation on the Ô-Tab
trick that uses the mouse.
1.
Press and hold the Ô key.
2.
While continuing to hold down the Ô key,
press the Tab key once to bring up the list of
open applications.
3.
While still holding down the Ô key, move your
cursor over the application that you want to
switch to (it’s highlighted).
4.
Release the Ô key to make that application
active.
Use the cursor with Ô-Tab to quickly access
another application. If you have a dozen or so
applications open, this might be faster than
continuing to press Tab until you reach a more
latent app.
Alternatively, these keyboard shortcuts work after
you press Ô-Tab once, while continuing to hold the
Ô key:

Press the End key to go to the last item.

Press the Home key to go to the first item.

Press the tilde (~) to go backwards (same as 
Ô-Shift-Tab).
The other preferred method for switching among
open applications is to use Exposé. Technique 15
covers this tool in detail, but here’s what you really
need to know:

Exposé shows all the windows (either docu-
ments or Finder windows) for every open and
unhidden application with just one keystroke
combination or hot corner. (The keystroke or hot
corner varies, depending on how you’ve set your
preferences.)

Exposé shows all the windows for the currently
active application with a different keystroke and
hot corner.

A third key combination or hot corner takes you
to the Desktop.

A fourth key combination shows you the
Dashboard (see Technique 15).
Although Exposé focuses on windows and documents,
it can easily be used to switch from one application to
another. Just do this:
1.
Trigger Exposé by using the key combination
or hot corner to bring up every non-hidden
document or window (see Figure 24-3).

Technique 24: Switching, Hiding, and Quitting Applications
188
By using the mouse, two other easy ways to switch
from the current application to another are available:

Click the second application’s icon in the Dock.

Click a visible window (for example, a document)
in the second application.
Switching apps with shareware
If you want validation that switching among open
applications is a critical concept, just look at the
number and variety of third-party applications
designed for this very purpose. A quick search on
VersionTracker reveals many utilities, such as
LiteSwitch X (www.proteron.com/liteswitchx, $15).
The following applications aren’t necessarily switch-
ers. They’re actually advanced launching tools that
allow you to assign keys to open particular applica-
tions. Because of this, they can also be used to
switch to another application:

LaunchBar (www.obdev.at/products/launchbar,
$20 for personal use, free for limited use)

DragThing (www.dragthing.com, $29)

Keyboard Maestro (www.keyboardmaestro.com;
free for the Lite version, $20 for the full)

QuicKeys (www.cesoft.com, $100)
We discuss these programs and others, partic-
ularly LaunchBar, in more detail in Technique
23 and elsewhere in the book. Google or
VersionTracker turn up many launching and
switching applications for your consideration.
Hiding Applications
Being able to hide an application is a more impor-
tant concept than you might initially think. Hiding or
minimizing an application that you’re temporarily
not using makes for a less cluttered Mac, which
makes you more productive.
• Figure 24-3: Every visible document and window is
revealed by Exposé.
2.
Move the cursor over each document image to
view its name (see Figure 24-4).
• Figure 24-4: When you hover the mouse over a
document, its name becomes visible.
3.
After you select the document in the applica-
tion that you want to switch to, click the docu-
ment with your mouse button or press the
spacebar.

Hiding Applications
189
Hidden applications appear in the Ô-Tab appli-
cation listing but not in Exposé.
Here are several ways to hide active applications:

While the application is active, press Ô-H. This
works for most, but not all, applications.

While the application is active, choose Hide
ApplicationName from the application’s menu
(see Figure 24-5).
• Figure 24-5: Every application should have a Hide option.

While in any application, click and hold on
another application’s Dock icon (see the BBEdit
icon in Figure 24-6). Then choose Hide from the
contextual menu that appears.

While in most applications, press Ô-Option-H to
hide every other application. You can also hide
every other application by using the Hide
Others option in the application menu (refer to
Figure 24-5). Hiding every application but the
currently active one really cleans up your
screen. It’s very helpful when your active appli-
cation has a lot going on (like many windows,
palettes, and documents).
• Figure 24-6: You can hide applications that aren’t even
active just by using the Dock.
If you’re switching to another application, you
can hide the application that you’re currently
in by holding down the Option key while
clicking the second application’s Dock icon or
document window. If you hold down both the
Ô and Option keys while clicking, every other
application is hidden.

Press and hold down the Ô-Option keys while
clicking the Desktop or the Finder icon in the
Dock to go to the Finder and hide every other
application.
You can also hide an application by using the Ô-Tab
switching technique:
1.
Hold down the Ô key and press Tab once to
activate the switcher.
2.
Highlight the target application with one of
these actions:
 While still holding down the Ô key, press Tab
(or press Shift-Tab) until the target application
is highlighted.
 Put the cursor over the icon.
3.
While still holding down the Ô key, press H.
4.
Release the Ô and H keys simultaneously.

Technique 24: Switching, Hiding, and Quitting Applications
190
Force-quitting
If an application is stuck, quitting it the usual way simply
won’t work. Instead, you need to use Force Quit. You can
force-quit an application in either of two ways:

Press Ô-Option-Escape to bring up the Force Quit
window.

Choose Relaunch from the contextual menu. You can
bring up the contextual menu either by holding
Option-Control and clicking the Dock icon or by hold-
ing the Dock icon and pressing the Option key.
Fortunately, applications rarely freeze up, so you shouldn’t
need to use these techniques very often.
Logging Out and Shutting Down
The most drastic way to quit every application is to
log out, restart, or shut down your computer. If you
choose one of these options, Tiger automatically
closes every open application, assuming you don’t
have unsaved documents still open.

Pressing Ô-Shift-Q logs you out but asks you for
confirmation (see Figure 24-8).

Pressing Ô-Option-Shift-Q logs you out without
asking for confirmation.
If you log out with Fast User Switching, all your
applications remain open.
• Figure 24-8: You can avoid the confirmation prompt by
holding down the Option key when logging
out.
Quitting Applications
You might be thinking, “Why do I need to read about
quitting applications? I know how to do that.”
Although you probably know at least one way to quit
your applications, you might not know the easiest or
best way. Here’s a quick rundown of your options:

While the application is active, press Ô-Q.

While the application is active, choose Quit from
the application’s menu.

While in any application, click and hold the appli-
cation’s Dock icon (see Figure 24-7). Choose Quit
from the contextual menu that appears.
• Figure 24-7: Every application provides a Quit option in
the Dock’s contextual menu.
You can also quit an application by using the Ô-Tab
switching technique:
1.
Hold down the Ô key and press Tab once to
activate the switcher.
2.
Highlight the target application with one of
these actions:
 While still holding down the Ô key, press Tab
(or press Shift-Tab) until the target applica-
tion is highlighted.
 Put the cursor over the icon.
3.
While still holding down the Ô key, press Q.
4.
Release the Ô and Q keys simultaneously.

Opening Files
Faster
T
he Macintosh operating system has many ways to open your files
efficiently, and this number increases tenfold if you add third-party
tools such as LaunchBar to the mix. In this technique, you see sev-
eral ways to achieve the same end result. Like most timesaving techniques,
many options are available; it’s really up to you to determine which works
most efficiently for your computing habits.
Opening Files with the Finder
As you probably already know, you can open any file by double-clicking
it, in which case it automatically opens by using the default application
for that particular file type. If you’d rather open the file without your
hands leaving the keyboard, press Ô-O instead.
If you use an input device with programmable buttons (such as a
trackball or a multi-buttoned mouse), program one of the buttons to
behave as a double-click. This button saves a step (literally a click)
whenever you need to open a file. Check the software or manual that
came with your input device to see whether it’s programmable — and
if so, how.
Entering a file?
Here’s one place where we think Windows users have an advantage. To open a file
in Windows, a user simply selects the file and then presses Enter (the Mac Return
key equivalent for PC users). When Mac users press Return, they can rename the
file. This makes little sense because, frankly, files are opened much more often than
renamed. But we’d be surprised to see Apple make this change — and the conces-
sion to Microsoft — after so many years.
However, clicking once on a file and pressing Return is the fastest way to rename it.
The alternative — clicking once on a file, and then clicking again on its name but not
so quickly as to be a double-click — is much slower and often inadvertently opens
the file.

application’s icon in the Dock. For this method to
work, the application must either

Permanently reside in the Dock 

Be open
Technique 13 provides guidelines for creating
an efficient Dock.
Out of kindness (or maybe insolence), the
Dock tries to make room for the files that you
drag there, moving your application’s icon out
of the way in the process. To prevent this
behavior, hold down Ô while dragging your
files, and the Dock remains motionless.
Using Favorites to open files
If you place a link to your Favorites in the window’s
toolbar, you can pop that open and find your
favorite application, just like we suggest you can by
using the Applications folder. (Technique 17 shows
how to set up your Favorites folder to contain your
most-often-used applications, files, and folders.)
The spring-loaded folder technique works with
folders in the Sidebar but not with those in the
Dock. So although you might keep the
Favorites folder docked, trying to drag a file
onto it doesn’t work.
If you haven’t yet customized your Favorites
folder, run — don’t walk — to Technique 17
and do it now.
Opening files with a contextual menu
This method of opening a file in a specific applica-
tion is perhaps the best. Control-click a file’s icon,
and you’re prompted by a contextual menu that
offers a list of common actions that you can do with
the file, such as get info about it and archive the file
(see Figure 25-2).
Opening Files with Specific
Applications
Double-clicking a file in the Finder usually works just
fine for opening files, particularly when the file is set
to open in the application of your choosing. However,
the default application often isn’t the one that you
want to use in a specific instance. For example, you
might normally open HyperText Markup Language
(HTML) files in Safari, but maybe you want to edit a
particular HTML file in BBEdit. Likewise, images open
in Preview by default, but maybe you want to use
Adobe Photoshop to tweak a particular image. Here
are some steps to automatically open files with a spe-
cific application. At the end of this technique, we
reveal how to set the default application for a file or a
file type. This is helpful if you often need to change
the application used to open a type of file.
Using the Finder Window toolbar to open files
In Technique 12, we demonstrate the how’s and
why’s of tweaking the default Finder window setup.
One recommended addition is to put the most com-
monly used applications there (see Figure 25-1). This
makes opening a file with that application a simple
case of dragging and dropping the file onto the icon.
• Figure 25-1: By placing an application in the window’s
toolbar, you can quickly open a file by
dragging it onto the icon.
A neat trick that results from Tiger’s window
structure is that the folders in the Sidebar
spring open if files are held over them.
Therefore, you can drag a file onto the
Applications icon, which in turn opens the
Applications directory. Then you can drop the
file directly onto the appropriate application.
Using the Dock to open files
Another easy method of opening a file with a partic-
ular application is simply to drag the file onto the

Using LaunchBar
193
• Figure 25-2: A contextual menu provides quick access to
a wealth of common tasks.
One of these menu items, Open With, gives you
immediate access to other applications with which
you might want to open the file. The resulting sub-
menu (see Figure 25-3) lists the current default
application at the top along with the other poten-
tial candidates. If the application that you’re look-
ing for isn’t listed, choose Other (at the bottom)
and use the resulting Open dialog to find and select
the right app.
If you have a programmable input device, we
recommend programming one of the buttons
as a Control-click, allowing you to access a
contextual menu with just the one hand. By
default, most two-button mice use the right
button (also referred to as the second mouse
button) as a Control-click.
• Figure 25-3: The Open With submenu lists logical choices
for handling a file.
Using LaunchBar
LaunchBar (www.obdev.at) is far and away one of our
favorite third-party applications for the Mac. Its ease
of use, impressive speed, and very reasonable cost
($20 for personal use; free for limited use) make it a
must-have in our minds, particularly if you want to
shave seconds off common tasks. By following these
steps, it can quickly open files in the appropriate
application:
1.
Press Ô-spacebar to activate LaunchBar.
2.
Type the shortcut for the application that you
want to open a file with (the keys you enter will
appear in LaunchBar’s prompt).
In this example, the letter B represents BBEdit
(see Figure 25-4).

• Figure 25-6: Microsoft Word default Open dialog.
If using list view is more natural to you than
column view, click the list view icon in the dia-
log. (Unlike Finder windows, Open dialogs
don’t offer an icon view option.)
A few shareware applications allow you to set
the default folder for applications to use (such
as Default Folder X; www.stclairsoft.com/
DefaultFolderX/index.html, $35). Using
one of these saves you from navigating to the
appropriate folder when opening or saving 
a file.
Many OS X applications include their own tools for
finding files more quickly. In Microsoft Word, you can
click the Find File button at the bottom of the Open
dialog (in older versions of Word) or the Search win-
dow (in Office 2004) to help locate the file. BBEdit
provides an Open File by Name option (under File)
that locates files for you.
Recalling Recent Items
After you access a file, it becomes much, much eas-
ier to bring it up again. Tiger has (or can have) a
memory of your actions in the Recent Items menu,
found in the Finder and in many applications.
• Figure 25-4: The first two steps in using LaunchBar bring
the required application to the launch pad.
3.
From the Finder, drag the desired file onto the
launch pad.
4.
From the pop-up menu that appears, select
Open with Application (in this case, Open with
BBEdit; see Figure 25-5).
• Figure 25-5: LaunchBar offers three choices of actions
after you drop a file onto it.
Set LaunchBar to automatically open a file
dropped onto it instead of presenting a list of
options. To set this preference, click the Drag
& Drop tab under the LaunchBar preferences
and use the pop-up menus found there.
Opening Files within an
Application
If you have an application open, you can expedite
opening files from within it. For starters, every appli-
cation uses the Ô-O shortcut to bring up the Open
dialog (shown in Figure 25-6).
The standard navigational keyboard shortcuts (such
as Ô-D for the Desktop) work within the Open dialog.
You also can click the folders and files in the Sidebar
for immediate access to commonly used directories.

Recalling Recent Items
195
Recalling files from the Apple menu
The Apple menu has gone through many changes
over the years. In OS X, it’s more or less off-limits to
user customization. However, one tweakable feature
that remains is the Recent Items submenu (see
Figure 25-7).
• Figure 25-7: The Apple menu can track recently used
applications and files.
The number of items listed here can be set from the
Appearance System Preferences panel (see Figure
25-8). You can have your Mac show up to 50 recent
documents and 50 recent applications. The Apple
menu keeps each type of item (applications, docu-
ments, and servers) separate and also lists them
alphabetically (not by date or by time).
• Figure 25-8: Set how many recent files and applications (if
any) are remembered from the Appearance
panel.
If you don’t use many applications and have
your Dock, Finder toolbar, and Favorites well
organized, you probably won’t need to recall
recently used applications. If that’s the case for
you, set this value to 0 (zero) in the Appearance
System Preferences panel and save the valuable
Recent Items real estate solely for files.
One caution about using the Recent Items menu:
Tiger can’t track files that you open through certain
methods. For example, Tiger records something
opened from the Finder or by using an application’s
Open option, but it most likely doesn’t notice a file
that you open by using an application’s Recent Files
menu (see the next section).
Recalling files from application menus
This might be a chicken-or-egg debate, but either the
Apple menu inspired similar behavior in many appli-
cations, or vice versa. Regardless, most of Tiger’s
commonly used applications include their own
Recent Items menu. Examples include BBEdit,
Acrobat Reader, and Photoshop. Usually, you find a

If you have only a file or two that should

opened with Acrobat Reader instead of
Preview), don’t click Change All in the Get Info
window.

and Microsoft Internet Explorer, just to name
two — can automatically associate certain file
types with themselves. Peruse the application’s
Preferences for the appropriate setting.
Recent Items (or similarly named) submenu listed
under the File menu. Some applications, such as the
Microsoft Office products, just list the recent files at
the bottom of the File menu instead.
Setting the Default Application
for Files
The default application to be used when opening a
file is indicated by the file’s icon in the Finder. Each
application has its own look for corresponding files.
As usual, double-clicking (or using the keyboard
equivalent, Ô-O) automatically opens the file in the
assigned application. But what if you want to change
the default application? In Tiger, you can manage file
types by using the ubiquitous Get Info window by
following these steps:
1.
Select the file in the Finder.
2.
Click the file and press Ô-I (or choose File➪Get
Info) to bring up the Get Info window (see
Figure 25-9).
Reach the Get Info window by Control-clicking
the file and selecting Get Info from the con-
textual menu that appears.
3.
Click the arrow next to Open With to expand
that panel, if it isn’t already visible.
4.
Select the default application to use from the
pop-up menu.
If the application isn’t already listed, select Other
at the bottom and navigate to the appropriate
application.
5.
(Optional) Click the Change All button to set
this application to always open files of this par-
ticular type.

Saving and Printing
Files
T
his part of the book is all about your applications — not what they
specifically do, but those common elements that you’ll run across in
every application. This includes saving and printing your documents.
Although you probably know what you’re doing when it comes to these
issues, in this technique you might find a better way to do those common
tasks. We begin by discussing how to navigate and use Save dialogs
quickly. Then we go into printing your documents. Finally, we cover how to
turn any document into a PDF file, which is a widely accepted file format
for sharing documents on Macs and PCs alike.
Saving Files
Regardless of what application you’re using, when you go to save an unti-
tled document, you’re presented with a Save As dialog. (See one in Figure
26-1.) The Save As dialog appears as a sheet, meaning that it drops down
from the top of the document window.

198
• Figure 26-3: Some applications allow you to specify a file
format other than the default.
Because the Save As dialog uses the same for-
mat as your Finder windows, customizations
made to the Finder windows are reflected in
your Save As dialogs. (See Technique 12 for
customization tips.) Placing some of your
favorite directories in the Finder’s Sidebar lets
you more easily use both Finder windows and
Open or Save As dialogs.
Another nice feature of the Save As dialog is that you
can use it in either list mode (as shown in Figure
26-4) or column mode (refer to Figure 26-1). In fact,
the Finder keyboard shortcuts — Ô-2 for list view or
Ô-3 for column view — work in Save As dialogs!
Save your documents in the most logical
place. (See Technique 16 for organizing your
Home directory.) If you’re looking for a quick,
temporary storage location, use the Desktop.
The keyboard shortcut for Save is Ô-S. Some
applications have a shortcut of Ô-Shift-S for
Save As.
Tiger uses a Save As dialog format that is very simi-
lar to the Finder window format:

The top section is for the document’s name.

The down-arrow button (next to the name)
enables you to display or hide (see Figure 26-2)
your other options.
• Figure 26-2: Save dialogs can be minimal, or you can
click the down arrow to see more options.
Some applications, such as Microsoft Word (refer to
Figures 26-1 and 26-2), provide

document in another file format (see Figure 26-3)
What is available in an application’s Save prefer-
ences panel (if it has one) varies; normally you can
select a default file format and how often to perform
automatic backups.
The left side of the fully expanded Save As dialog dis-
plays volumes at the top and your favorite places at
the bottom. This is the same setup that you can find
in your Finder windows.


Press Ô-D to go to the Desktop.
The Default Folder X shareware program (www.
stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/index.
html, $35) brings many useful features to the
Save dialogs. For example, with it you can save
documents to open Finder windows or delete
and rename existing folders and files without
exiting your application.

Press Ô-Shift-H to go to your Home directory.

Use the Tab key to move forward from one area
of the Save As dialog to another.

Press Shift-Tab to move backward from one area
to another.
The Tab and Shift-Tab keyboard shortcuts
move you from the document title window to
the Sidebar to the main window area. A col-
ored box indicates the currently active area.

The directory drop-down list at the top lists the
hierarchy for the current folder.

The directory drop-down list at the top also lists
the most recently used folders (check it out in
Figure 26-5).
• Figure 26-5: Use the drop-down list to access parent or
recently used folders.

Click and drag the lower-right corner to resize a
Save As dialog.

Most of the keyboard shortcuts that function in a
Finder window also work inside Save As dialogs,
including
 Ô-[ (opening brace) to move back (in list view)
 Ô-↑to move up one folder (in list view)
 Ô-↓to move into a selected folder (in list
view)
 Ô-←to move back one folder (in column
view)
 Ô-→to move into a selected folder (in col-
umn view)
Save your work frequently! Although your Mac
will rarely crash, you certainly don’t need to risk
it. Also get in the habit of saving your work
before interruptions such as switching applica-
tions, printing, and leaving your computer.

For Dummies in the next image) and document names in
document windows (see the icon to the left of software in the
second image). If you’ve never touched a proxy icon before,
you don’t know how unbelievably useful they can be.
Proxy icons are essentially iconic representations of the
things themselves. So the icon in the Finder window repre-
sents that directory, and the icon next to a document’s
name represents the document. The reason proxy icons
rule is that they give you an easy way to move stuff around.
For example, you can drag an item’s proxy icon onto an
e-mail to attach that file. Or you can drag a Finder window’s
icon into a Save dialog to quickly navigate to that directory. 
The only trick with proxy icons is grabbing them. As you
know, you can use the title bar (in a document or window)
to move that document or window around or to minimize
it (by double-clicking the title bar). But because the proxy
icon is part of the title bar, how can the computer distin-
guish between those actions involving the title bar and
those involving the proxy icon? To indicate that you want to
grab the proxy icon and not the title bar, you have to hold
the mouse still for about half a second after clicking the
proxy icon. This indicates to the system that you want to
drag the proxy icon and not move the window. Master this
simple technique and you’ve gained a valuable skill!
Overwriting existing files
Existing files in Save As dialogs appear in gray, indi-
cating that you can’t use that filename without over-
writing another document. In the past, to force a
used name on the document that you were saving
you had to type it manually. Now, selecting a grayed-
out file automatically enters that filename as the
saved document’s name.
Marc’s cool trick for navigating in Save dialogs
If you don’t like trying to navigate all over your com-
puter system to save a file or if you’re frequently
saving multiple files to the same area (like if you’re,
um, writing a book), here’s a cool trick:
1.
Bring up the Save As dialog for the application
that you’re working in.
2.
Go to the Finder.
3.
Open the folder where you want to store the
document in a Finder window.
This trick makes the most sense (time-wise) if
you already have the destination folder open
in a Finder window.
4.
Click and hold the folder proxy icon in the
Finder window (see the sidebar “Using proxy
icons”).
The proxy icon is the representation of that
folder at the top of the Finder window, next to
the folder’s name.
5.
Drag the folder icon onto the Save As dialog.
The dialog now shows that folder as the destina-
tion for the file being saved.
If you like this technique, you can really speed it up
by using a drag and drop in conjunction with Exposé
(see Technique 15) or the Finder’s Ô-Tab trick to
quickly go back and forth between the Finder and
the primary application.
You can drag folders or files from the Finder
into a Save As dialog. The dialog moves to the
new location, and the name of the file that you
dragged is entered into the filename text box,
saving you some typing if you want to over-
write an existing file.
Using proxy icons
Proxy icons are the little icons you see next to folder names
in Finder windows (see the icon to the left of OS X Tiger TT

Printing
201
Be careful when you use an existing filename
in Save As dialogs. Doing so wipes out the
previous document, leaving you without any
recourse for recovery.
Printing
Although different printers have different features
(like the ability to print in color or on both sides of a
page), there are some great timesaving techniques
that work regardless of the hardware being used.
The following examples use Larry’s printer, but
the thrust of these tips should still applies to
whatever printer you’re using.
Customizing print settings
Many print drivers come with the ability to create
and save your print settings. This is very useful if
you frequently need to print documents in certain
ways. For example, you might adjust

The number of copies to print

What pages to print

The quality of the printing

Whether to use two-sided printing (if possible)
Larry has a few different settings created already.
One is for printing a lower-quality draft of something
double-sided. This is great for spitting out large doc-
uments that don’t require the best quality. On the
opposite end of the spectrum, Larry uses a setting
for printing photos in color and on glossy paper.
For most printers, arranging this is a matter of fol-
lowing these steps:
1.
Choose File➪Print in any application.
The keyboard equivalent of Print is Ô-P.
2.
In the Print dialog that appears, adjust all 
the settings as desired. (See some choices in
Figure 26-6.)
• Figure 26-6: Go through your printer’s options and adjust
each accordingly.
3.
Select Save As from the Presets drop-down list.
4.
In the Save Preset dialog that appears, enter a
distinctive and descriptive name for these set-
tings, like One Page Draft (see Figure 26-7) or
Color Photo.
• Figure 26-7: Give your printer settings a descriptive
name.
The next time you want to print something with
these preset settings, you can select them in the
Print dialog from the Presets drop-down list.

3.
Select your printer by clicking its name in the
list.
4.
Choose Printers➪Create Desktop Printer.
5.
In the Save dialog that appears, give your
printer a descriptive name and save it to your
Desktop.
6.
If you want, move the printer alias from the
Desktop to your Dock, a Finder window
Sidebar, or the Finder window Toolbar so it’s
more readily available.
After you create a desktop printer (even if you Dock
it), just drag any document from the Finder onto the
Desktop Printer icon to print it.
Creating PDFs
One of the coolest features of OS X is that it uses the
Portable Document Format as a standard technol-
ogy. The benefits of this are

Easy viewing of PDFs via Preview, which is the OS
X default media viewing application

Easy creation of PDFs without the need for
expensive software
With little fanfare, a cool feature called PDF Workflow
was added to the Mac OS X operating system. With
PDF Workflow, you can broaden your PDF options.
Instead of saving a document as a PDF, you could

Save it in a specific folder without prompting.

Attach the PDF to an e-mail.

Open the PDF in Adobe Acrobat Reader.
Previewing your documents
Using the Preview option turns a document into a
PDF (Portable Document Format) and sends it to
the Preview application. From there, you can scroll
through the multiple pages, print it, save the file as
a PDF, or convert it to another format. This function-
ality works in any OS X application that can print.
To find out more, see “Creating PDFs” later in this
chapter.
Using the operating system’s Preview tool is
often a better choice than the default preview
feature built into an application (if it even has
one). Remember that using any preview fea-
ture will save you paper, ink, and time by let-
ting you see the result before actually printing
your documents.
Desktop printing
In short, desktop printing is the ability to print docu-
ments (or start the print process) by using the
Finder instead of an application. It works by creating
an alias to your printer. When you drag a file onto
this alias, Tiger

Prints the file if its format is readable by Preview
(images and PDFs).

Launches the file’s default application and then
prints the file if its format isn’t readable by
Preview (Microsoft Office documents, as an
example).
Using desktop printing can save you a lot of time if
you frequently need to print documents that you
might not be currently viewing or editing — in other
words, if you print documents separately from work-
ing with them.
To create a desktop printer, follow these steps:
1.
Launch the Printer Setup Utility, found in the
Applications➪Utilities folder.
You should see a list of available printers.

Creating PDFs
203
After you turn on PDF Workflow, you can add differ-
ent shortcuts, which will be available through the
print sheet’s Actions button. To enable PDF
Workflow, follow these steps:
1.
Open your Home directory in a Finder window.
2.
Navigate to the Library folder.
3.
Create a new folder called PDF Services.
The PDF Services directory is Tiger’s link to PDF
Workflow functionality. You use it to add all the
different features you want to the PDF Workflow
menu.
PDFU, from If Then Software (www.
ifthensoft.com, free), automates the PDF
Services directory creation and adds several
useful starter services for you (see Figure 26-8).
• Figure 26-8: The Save As PDF button can work as a pull-
down menu instead.
After you create the PDF Services folder, here’s what
you can do with it:

Add aliases to other folders there, giving you a
very quick way to save a PDF file to that folder.

Add aliases to applications there.
For example, if you drop a Mail application alias
into the PDF Services folder, selecting Mail from
the pop-up menu creates a PDF that is then
immediately attached to a new, blank message in
Mail. You simply have to add a recipient and sub-
ject to the message, and then you can fire off the
PDF.

Programmers and scripters can add both
AppleScripts and UNIX scripts to the folder.
After you’ve done so, selecting the added PDF
Workflow option runs that script using the cre-
ated PDF.
For example, you could create an AppleScript
that moves the PDF onto a network server or
performs some type of post-processing.

Cut, Copy, Paste
Y
ou might be thinking to yourself, “Why is a whole technique
devoted to cutting, copying, and pasting? I already know how to do
that just fine.” Although this is probably true, the topic is so impor-
tant that you really ought to make sure you know every possible option
and method available.
In this technique, we give you everything that you absolutely must know
about editing a document: cutting, copying, and pasting (with a little
selecting thrown in). This begins with the basic and not-so-basic short-
cuts. After that, we discuss the Clipboard itself: what it is, how it works,
and how this affects you. At the same time, we introduce a couple new
tools that expand the functionality of the Clipboard. Finally, we show you
a few other related tricks and get into Tiger’s Find Clipboard.
Copying and Pasting with the 
Keyboard and Mouse
Editing is so common in everything that you do on computers these
days that if you haven’t already mastered the editing shortcuts, you’re
selling yourself short. The options on the Edit menu are fairly common
whether you’re talking about the Finder (see Figure 27-1) or BBEdit (see
Figure 27-2).
• Figure 27-1: The Finder Edit menu is rather basic.
27
Technique

Copying and Pasting with the Keyboard and Mouse
205
• Figure 27-2: The BBEdit Edit menu is much more
involved.
The Edit items apply to whatever you have selected,
including

Files, folders, icons, or applications in the Finder

Text

Images
Of the Edit menu options, these are the most 
important:

Select All highlights all the content in a window,
document, or whatever so that you can copy,
cut, or delete it.

Copy puts a copy of the selected material on the
Clipboard.

Cut removes the selected material and moves it
to the Clipboard. 

Delete discards the selected material.
In the Finder, things like files and folders are
deleted by using the Option and Delete keys
together.

Paste inserts the contents of the Clipboard.

Undo reverses your last action.

Redo restores the last action that you undid.
If you cut something (for example, text in a
document), you can always put it back by
using Paste. If you delete it, however, it might
be gone forever (depending on the application
in use). Cutting takes more memory because
the cut item is temporarily stored. Unless
you’ve selected something really large, this is
rarely an issue.
Nearly everywhere you go in your Mac, you can use
these keyboard shortcuts:

Select All: Ô-A

Copy: Ô-C

Cut: Ô-X

Paste: Ô-V

Undo: Ô-Z
You really, really, really must memorize these com-
mands. If you prefer using the mouse, these key-
board shortcuts are duplicated on Edit and
contextual menus (as shown in Figure 27-3).
Most applications use the Ô-Shift-Z shortcut
for Redo. Others use Ô-Y.

Technique 27: Cut, Copy, Paste
206

Hold down the Control key before you release
the mouse button to be given options when mov-
ing the selection from one document to another
within an application. After selecting some text,
say in a Word document, begin dragging it to
another location. After you arrive at your desti-
nation, press the Control key and release the
mouse button to see a menu of options (see
Figure 27-4).
• Figure 27-4: Contextual menus work within the Finder
and other applications while dragging stuff
around.
All these tricks work with text and other con-
tent in documents. Most also work with files
and folders in the Finder.
You can also select items (in the Finder or in an
application) by using these techniques:

Select a range of contiguous items by continuing
to hold down the mouse button while dragging
around a group of items.

Click to mark the beginning and then Shift-click
to mark the end to select a range of items.

Ô-click to add an item to the current selection
(like another file in a Finder window).
You can press Ô-click to deselect a selected item
(for example, to deselect one item from a range of
already selected items).
• Figure 27-3: The Edit options are frequently available on
contextual menus.
You can use your mouse for some neat editing tricks.
After you select an item, click it and begin dragging,
and then

Drag the item anywhere else to perform a cut
and paste.

Drag the item to the Trash to delete it.

Hold down the Option key while you drag to cre-
ate a copy of the selection in a new location
(copy and paste).

Move the item to a new volume (in the Finder) or
document (in an application) to create a copy in
the new location.

Hold down the Ô key to move the item to a new
volume without copying it (in the Finder).

Copy and Paste Tips and Tricks
207
Understanding the Clipboard
The Clipboard is an area of memory that stores the
most recently copied or cut stuff. The Clipboard has
been a part of the Mac operating system for a good
long time and is a simple and essential tool. Here are
some basic rules of how it works:

The Clipboard can contain only one selected
item at a time. The Clipboard has no history. It
can remember a group of files or a paragraph of
text or whatever, but it can only ever store one
level of copying or cutting.

The Clipboard’s contents are remembered
across the entire operating system and every
application. Even if you quit or open an applica-
tion, the Clipboard’s contents remain available.

The Clipboard’s contents are changed only
when you cut or copy something else. The
Clipboard isn’t emptied by any other option,
including pasting and deleting.

The Clipboard’s contents are dropped when you
log out, shut down, or restart your computer.
You can always view the current contents of
the Clipboard by choosing Edit➪Show
Clipboard in the Finder. See an example in
Figure 27-5.
• Figure 27-5: If you forget what’s on the Clipboard, view
its contents in the Finder.
Clipboard Shareware Alternatives
The main limitation of the Clipboard is its single-item
storage. It’s nice but limited. You don’t need to be a
power user to be hindered by its lack of history and
single-use nature. If you want just a little bit more,
here are some more potent options.

CopyPaste-X (www.scriptsoftware.com/
copypaste, $30) provides you with a Clipboard
that can automatically store ten items and also
includes a Clipboard Editor to alter the stored
contents.

iPasteboard (http://ipasteboard.
brunoblondeau.com, $15), like CopyPaste-X, is
closer to the old Scrapbook utility from OS 9 and
earlier. It provides unlimited Clipboards whose
contents are retained even after restarts.

iPaste (www.iggsoftware.com/ipaste, $13) is a
variation on the Clipboard, allowing you to cre-
ate a virtual, permanent Clipboard in which you
can store many types of items. Then, by using
contextual menus or keyboard shortcuts, you
can paste these often-needed items into docu-
ments, e-mails, and the like.

XShelf (http://homepage.mac.com/khsu/
XShelf/XShelf.html, free) is more like the Mac
OS 9 Scrapbook but can be used in place of the
Clipboard. Instead of using Cut, Copy, and Paste,
you drop selected items onto the application
(shelving them for later). When the time comes
to use the stored text, image, or what-have-you,
drag it off of the shelf and into its new location.

ClipboardSharing (www.lagercrantz.ath.cx/
software/clipboardsharing, donationware) lets
you share a Clipboard’s contents from one Mac
to another over a network.

Share Clip (http://homepage.mac.com/bnej/
shareclip, free) is like ClipboardSharing (letting
you share text over a network) but works with
the Mac OS, Windows, and Linux.

Plain Clip (www.bluem.net/downloads/
plain-clip_en, free) removes all formatting
from copied text.
Copy and Paste Tips and Tricks
To wrap up this technique, we want to discuss a few
editing tips and tricks that you should be familiar
with.

Technique 27: Cut, Copy, Paste
208
Often, people copy a word from a document and
then open the Find dialog and paste the word there.
This replaces any other text in the Clipboard, which
might still be needed. With the Find Clipboard, you
can do the same thing much quicker and without
ever opening up the Find panel. Here’s how:
1.
In an application such as Safari, Mail, or
TextEdit, select some text.
2.
Press Ô-E.
Ô-E is the keyboard shortcut for the Use
Selection for Find command.
3.
Open the Find panel for that or any other
application.
If the current application supports this feature,
this text is automatically inserted into the Find
dialog, and you can simply press Return to begin
the search.
4.
Press Ô-G to search again using the same Find
text.
For example, you might want to do this if the first
found occurrence wasn’t exactly what you were
looking for.
Instead of using the Find prompt at all, use Ô-G
to search for the selected text automatically.
Strange as it might seem, with the Find Clip-
board and the Ô-E shortcut, you can actually
use Find Again to find text even if you haven’t
run the search previously. This is another time-
saving benefit of the Find Clipboard!
Copying items within the Finder
You can use Copy and Paste to copy an item in the
Finder to another location without cluttering up the
Desktop with windows. Here’s the skinny:
1.
Open a new Finder window.
2.
Select the item or items that you want to 
duplicate.
3.
Press Ô-C to copy your selection.
4.
Navigate within the same window to the desti-
nation folder.
5.
Press Ô-V to paste the copied items there.
If you duplicate an item within a folder, the
Finder automatically adds the word copy to its
name. This is because two items within the
same directory can’t have the same name. If
you duplicate an item multiple times, the word
copy, followed by sequential numbers, is
added to the duplicates’ names.
Using the Find Clipboard
One of the interesting features in Tiger is the Find
Clipboard, which is an independent Clipboard that
stores text for which the user has been searching.
The great thing is that it is also system-wide and
works in every Apple application plus a few others
(you have to try it to be sure) while still leaving your
Clipboard contents unchanged.

Managing Fonts
E
ither because of a lack of need or because of a lack of good, inexpen-
sive tools, font management has long been a terrain where everyday
Mac users did not tread. While graphic designers used high-priced
applications to manage their fonts, the rest of us were left out in the cold.
Now, thanks to the Font Book application, you can add wacky fonts to
your Word documents or (more importantly) make your applications load
faster by enabling and disabling fonts as needed.
In this technique, we cover pretty much everything you need to know
about fonts including installing, viewing, and managing them. Along the
way, we show you our own special tricks for working with fonts in the
easiest way possible.
Fonts Supported in Tiger
To get the most out of fonts on your system, you should fully understand
how Tiger deals with fonts, particularly because this has changed signifi-
cantly in OS X.
Tiger supports several types of fonts:

Cross-platform fonts
There are many cross-platform fonts, but the most common are either
TrueType or OpenType. These types of fonts were originally made by
Microsoft. They are very common and provide good results on the
monitor and in lower-quality DPI (dots per inch) printings.

PostScript fonts
PostScript fonts, created by Adobe (and also called Type 1 fonts), look
great at even high-quality (professional level) printings.

Data fork suitcase fonts: .dfont
Similar to OpenType fonts, data fork fonts are new to Mac OS X.
Theoretically, these fonts have the best qualities of both Microsoft’s
TrueType and Adobe’s PostScript fonts.

Technique 28: Managing Fonts
210
• Figure 28-1: Add fonts to your system by placing them
within your personal Fonts folder.
If you install fonts into your Home directory
(specifically ~/Library/Fonts), they’re easy
to back up and move from one system to the
next. The only downside is that other users on
your Mac can’t access them.
To uninstall any font, just delete its file from the
Fonts folder in which it resides. Of course, you can
also install and delete fonts by using the Font Book
application, as you see in the section titled “Font
Book” later in this technique.
If you delete a font, any document that uses
that font will be forced to find a substitute.
You might not like the results, particularly
when it comes to graphics.
Viewing Fonts
After you install your fonts, you have several options
for viewing them. Although every individual applica-
tion will (or should) show you a list of available
fonts, Tiger’s tools go a step further by showing you
what the fonts look like and providing more powerful
levels of tinkering. The operating system offers three
tools for looking at your fonts: Character Palette, the
Font panel, and Font Book.

Mac TrueType fonts
Mac OS 9 and earlier used various TrueType and
bitmapped (think crude and jagged) fonts.
That’s a pretty broad range of options, meaning 
that you have an enviable list of options. Fonts from
Windows computers work on your Mac, as do old OS 9
fonts that you might still use in some documents.
Installing Fonts
Although your Mac comes with a few dozen fonts
out of the box, you can — and probably will — add
more. You can find fonts by purchasing them (either
online or in a good software store) or by download-
ing free ones from the Web.
Some of the better online font resources include

FontFreak.com: www.fontfreak.com

Adobe: www.adobe.com/type/main.jhtml

MyFonts.com: www.myfonts.com

Famous Fonts: www.smackbomb.com/famousfonts

Fonts.com: www.fonts.com
To install a font, all you need to do is drop the font
file into the appropriate location. You can install
fonts in either of the following places:

~/Library/Fonts (where ~ refers to your Home
directory; see Figure 28-1)

/Library/Fonts
Fonts used by your Classic system are stored in
the /System Folder/Fonts directory where
your OS 9 installation resides. The great thing
about this is that OS X automatically finds and
supports fonts that are installed in OS 9.
Any fonts that you install are usable the next time
you open an application. (For the Finder, this means
that the font is usable after you either restart your
computer, log in and log out, or manually quit and
restart the Finder.)

Viewing Fonts
211
Character Palette
Character Palette was new in Jaguar and replaced
the old Key Caps utility. It’s like Font Book but has
the added advantage of being accessible via the
menu bar at the top of the display. To set up your
preferences so that you can activate Character
Palette from the menu, just follow these steps:
1.
Bring up System Preferences.
2.
Select the International panel.
3.
Click the Input Menu tab.
4.
Select the check box next to Character Palette,
as shown in Figure 28-2.
• Figure 28-2: The Input Menu panel controls palettes,
keyboards, and input methods.
5.
Select the Show Input Menu in Menu Bar check
box at the bottom of the window.
Following these steps creates an icon on the menu
bar. Clicking it brings up some options (as shown in
Figure 28-3).
• Figure 28-3: Font-related tools can be made available
through a menu bar icon.
Character Palette (shown in Figure 28-4) is a useful
tool for accessing particular characters. For exam-
ple, use Character Palette if you want to insert a
symbol (such as a star, asterisk, and so on) into a
Word document or add a character with an umlaut
or tilde in an e-mail. Character Palette provides a
much faster interface for hunting down these pecu-
liar items.
You can also access Character Palette by choos-
ing Edit➪Special Characters from the Finder. 
To access special characters, use the free
CharViewer (www.macparc.ch/mirror/
CharViewer) or the fancier PopChar X (www.
macility.com/products/popcharx, $30).

favorites. Then you can quickly insert these
into documents by clicking the Favorites tab to
view them. This is the best, most efficient way
to repeatedly access nonstandard characters.
3.
Use the menu at the left to select a category.
4.
In the panel on the right, find the character that
you’re looking for and click it to highlight it.
5.
(Optional) Click the arrow next to the Character
Info label to find out more about the highlighted
character and to see related characters.
For example, if you’re looking for a special
accented character, select Roman for the View
and select Accented Latin as the Category,
which brings up the list of possible characters.
The top-right column shows primary options,
and the Character Info section shows variations
for each option (uppercase, lowercase) and simi-
lar characters.
6.
(Optional) Click the arrow next to Font
Variation to see the character in other fonts.
7.
Double-click the character that you want to
insert.
The selected character is inserted into your doc-
ument where the cursor is located.
New to Tiger is the Keyboard Viewer, which
shows all the characters of a font as they appear
on a keyboard. You might find this to be an
easier, more natural way to see what characters
or symbols are available (see Figure 28-5).
• Figure 28-5: Tiger’s Keyboard Viewer.
• Figure 28-4: Tiger’s Character Palette.
To find a particular character and insert it in the cur-
rent document, just follow these steps:
1.
Within Character Palette, use the View drop-
down list at the top of the panel to select the
appropriate alphabet.
You’ll most likely want to use the Roman alpha-
bet unless you have a need to access Japanese,
Korean, or Chinese characters. The Unicode
View shows many other symbols and characters
such as mathematical symbols, signs of the
zodiac, and Cyrillic letters.
2.
Click the By Category tab if it’s not already
highlighted.
Use the Add to Favorites button at the bottom
of the Character Palette window to add a 
frequently used character to your list of

Viewing Fonts
213
Font panel
The Font panel is a solid tool for viewing, selecting,
and tweaking fonts. It’s available in all Cocoa (native
to Mac OS X) applications, like Stickies, TextEdit,
Mail, and Safari.
Applications that support the Font panel, such
as Mail, Stickies, and TextEdit, often use the
Ô-T keyboard shortcut for accessing the Font
panel.
The primary purpose of the Font panel is to allow
you to select and customize the font used in an
application. The basic view (as shown in Figure 28-6)
shows the different font collections, families, and
sizes available. Set the font face and size to use:

Make selections in the Collection, Family, and
Typeface columns. (Navigate the Font panel like
you would a Finder window in column view
mode.)

In the Size column, enter a value or use the slider
to adjust the size. Move the slider up to increase
the font size; move it down to decrease the font
size.
• Figure 28-6: The Font panel exists in many OS X
applications.
The Font panel’s options change based on
how big the Font panel window is. Adjust the
window’s size to see more information.
If you’re looking for a particular font but you’re not
sure which collection or family it belongs to, use the
Search button at the bottom of the window to find it.
The Font panel’s greatest asset is the Actions button at
the bottom left (the thing that looks like a cog or a
gear with a downward-pointing arrow next to it),
which creates a menu of useful options (see these in
Figure 28-7). The effect of the options change depend-
ing on whether you’ve already selected a font, but
your choices include
• Figure 28-7: Click the Actions button on the Font panel
for more font options.

Add to Favorites: If you add a font to your
Favorites (Font Favorites, not the other Favorites
that your system uses), you can easily access it in
any application. Your Favorite fonts are listed in
the second column when you select Favorites
from the Collections column in the Font panel.
The wonderful thing is that the Favorites doesn’t
just recall the font itself, but also the size and any
special effects applied. So if you like a certain
style for an e-mail or a heading in a text docu-
ment, you can quickly retrieve it time and again.

Technique 28: Managing Fonts
214

Edit Sizes: The Edit Sizes menu allows you to set
the default sizes available for your fonts.

Manage Fonts: This option brings up Font Book.
Font Book
You can use the Font Book utility to view and man-
age your fonts. Font Book consists of a window that
lists the groupings or categories of fonts in the left
column, the specific fonts for that grouping in the
middle column, and a preview of the font in the right
column (although the preview can be disabled).
If you double-click any font in the Finder, it
opens in Font Book, where you can view and
manage it (see Figure 28-8). You can also
access Font Book from within your Applications
folder or from the Font panel (by choosing
Manage Fonts from the Actions menu).
• Figure 28-8: Viewing a font in Font Book.
To preview any font, follow these steps:
1.
Start by clicking the appropriate collection in
the Collection column.
2.
Select the font family in the Font column.
3.
(Optional) Click the arrow next to the font’s
name to expand the font listing, and then select
a specific subfont.
4.
Adjust the view size in the right column by mov-
ing the slider or using the Size drop-down list.
Make good use of the Font Favorites tool to
save yourself time when accessing frequently
used fonts and styles.

Show/Hide Preview: This Action option toggles
a Preview window that shows the font name in
its font to demonstrate its appearance. Use the
Preview option while you’re tweaking a font’s 
settings.

Show/Hide Effects: This setting reveals and
hides the toolbar of font effects, which lets you
customize your fonts. Using the different font
effect tools, you can adjust these font attributes:
 Underline (none, single, double, or color)
 Strikethrough (none, single, double, or color)
 Font color
 Font background color
 Shadow (opacity, blur, offset, and angle)
Unfortunately, the effects aren’t reflected in the
Preview section of the Font panel, so you need to
select the text in the document (to which you
want to apply the effects) to see how the differ-
ent adjustments look. 

Color: This brings up the Color Palette, a sepa-
rate window of color choices. The Color Palette
is used all over the operating system and has
several subpanels, each of which lets you find a
color in a different way (using a color wheel, a
box of Crayons, an image).

Characters: The Characters option brings up the
Character Palette, which we discuss in the pre-
ceding section.

Typography: Tiger includes many options for
precise typographical control, but the availability
of advanced typographical options varies from
font to font. Commonly you can tweak a font’s lig-
atures (how two characters joined together are
spaced) and glyphs (special characters). Some
fonts also have tweaks for managing em dashes
(wide dashes, —), hyphens, case, and spacing.

Managing Fonts
215
If you want, you can have Font Book preview a font
by using specific text. After you select your font,
choose Preview➪Custom or press Ô-3. In the third
column (where the font is normally previewed using
the alphabet and numbers), type the text that you
want to use as the sample (see Figure 28-9).
• Figure 28-9: You can use Font Book to preview specific
text in a font.
Font Book has a Search box in its upper-right
corner, which allows you to quickly find a font
by name or family.
Double-clicking a font’s name in the Font col-
umn opens a new window showing a preview
of the font. You can open multiple preview
windows, allowing you to compare fonts.
Managing Fonts
You can always install and uninstall fonts simply by
manually removing them from a Fonts folder and
then replacing them when needed. Although this is
effective, it’s unnecessarily slow and cumbersome.
Instead, use Font Book to manage your fonts. With
Font Book, you can

More quickly install fonts.

View every font on your Mac at once. (This is a
timesaver because fonts might be found in many
locations.)

Disable fonts without having to delete them
(which makes applications load faster).

Create font groupings so that particular applica-
tions (such as Adobe Photoshop) have access to
fonts not required by other applications.

Find duplicate fonts (Edit➪Resolve Duplicates)

Getting to Know
Services
S
ervices have been around since the introduction of OS X, but surpris-
ingly few Mac users know about them or use them with any regularity.
Services are like the geeky younger brothers of contextual menus: not
as impressive at first, but pretty cool after you get to know them. The min-
utes you spend reading this chapter will greatly improve your productivity
because Services cut to the chase in performing many common tasks.
In this technique, we give you the all-in-one treatment for Services. We
begin with a quick introduction to the concept: what they are, how you use
them, and where they work. Then we present a more advanced coverage of
the topic, going over our best tips and techniques. Finally, we point you
toward some resources for adding to your currently available Services.
What Are Services?
Services are little tools, usually chosen from a menu or keyboard short-
cut, that are essentially a part of the operating system, which makes
them available in many of your applications. Services work by providing
the functionality of one application as an option in another application.
Some common examples of what Services can do are

Opening a file

Sending selected content in an e-mail

Creating a new sticky note from selected text

Having your computer speak selected text

Opening a URL in your Web browser

Searching in Google for selected text
Services are normally applied to the current selection. Most often, this
is text, but it could also be a selected file or folder in the Finder. You’ll
also find that what Services are available (unavailable Services appear
in gray text) depends on the application you’re using and the content
you select.

Technique 29: Getting to Know Services
218
At the time of writing, all these applications (and
many more besides) support Services:

Finder

Mail

Safari

iTunes

BBEdit

Stickies

StickyBrain (a Stickies-like utility)

Camino (a Web browser)
To tell whether an application supports Services,
select some text in a document or window and
then peruse through the Services menu. If all
the options are in gray (folders won’t be in gray,
although their contents will be), the answer is
no (see Figure 29-3). If any of the options are
selectable, you’re good to go!
• Figure 29-3: The current version of Microsoft Office
doesn’t support Services.
Your Mac comes with a good dozen Services right
out of the box, and you can add more with share-
ware (see the later section, “Adding Services”).
Services are listed as menu choices on the applica-
tion menu, whether in the Finder (as in Figure 29-1)
or in Safari (see Figure 29-2). Because of their unique
nature, Services function only in certain applications
(see the sidebar, “Cocoa and Carbon applications”)
so you cannot use them all of the time.
• Figure 29-1: Services available in the Finder.
• Figure 29-2: Services available in Safari.

Grasping the Best Services Techniques
219
Cocoa and Carbon applications
Two Mac OS X terms that you might hear with some fre-
quency are Cocoa and Carbon. These came about in part to
ease the transition from OS 9 to OS X. Carbon applications
are OS 9 tools that have been modified to work in OS X: for
example, Microsoft Office. Cocoa applications are written
specifically for OS X and take advantage of its technology
(Safari, Mail, and others). Although both of these applica-
tion types run in OS X — and you don’t really need to 
know whether an application is Cocoa- or Carbon-based —
remember that almost all Cocoa applications support Services,
but some Carbon applications don’t.
Grasping the Best Services
Techniques
The world of Services is still expanding, but good,
useful Services are already available. (Services are
provided by one application to other applications
that support Services.)
Here is a quick tour of our favorites. In each of these
cases, we focus on what functionality an application
provides:

BBEdit: BBEdit offers a Service that opens a
selected file in BBEdit. For example, select any
file in the Finder and then choose Services➪
BBEdit➪Open File (see Figure 29-4). It automati-
cally opens that file — even if it isn’t a standard
BBEdit file type — in the popular text editor.
Alternatively, BBEdit’s Open Selection Service
creates a new document by using selected text.
You can use this to take HTML code or text from
a Web page and start a new BBEdit file with it.
The BBEdit Open Selection Service has the
added functionality of placing the path name
of a selected file in a new BBEdit document.

Grab: The Grab utility is useful for taking screen
shots, and it can run independently of any other
application (see Technique 45).
• Figure 29-4: The BBEdit Services menu has two useful
tools.
Grab also provides a highly specific, and
frankly odd, Service: The Grab Service can be
used to perform screen captures. However,
because Services can’t create files, you have to
use the Grab Service to place a screenshot
within another document. Figure 29-5 shows a
screenshot of a Finder window placed in a
TextEdit document.
• Figure 29-5: The Grab Service can place a screenshot
within a document.

Mail’s Send Selection and Send File: Two Mail
Services let you send selected text or files as
part of an e-mail. You can use either of these
actions:

Technique 29: Getting to Know Services
220

TextEdit’s New Window Containing Selection:
This Service, similar to Make New Sticky Note,
launches TextEdit and creates a new document
by using the selected text.

Open URL: The Open URL Service opens the
selected URL in a new browser window in your
default Web browser, saving you these steps:
1. Copying the URL to the Clipboard.
2. Navigating your way over to the Web browser.
3. Opening a new browser window.
4. Highlighting the browser’s address/location
bar.
5. Pasting the URL.
6. Pressing Return to load the page.
Get in the habit of actively checking which
Services options are available. New Services
can be added without your knowing it (when
you install applications), or you might just for-
get how useful a tool they really are.
Services provide huge timesaving potential for any
Mac user. The next time that you have a few minutes
to kill, play with the Services menu!
Services and their keyboard shortcomings
Services have one drawback: An application’s keyboard
shortcuts have precedence over those used by the Services
menu. This means that unlike the rest of the Mac OS X user
interface, these shortcuts are really inconsistently usable.
For example, the Search with Google Service, activated by
the Ô-Shift-L keyboard shortcut, might work in one applica-
tion but not another: That second application might already
use Ô-Shift-L for something else. Frankly, we think that
Apple’s Services should take precedence, but no one at
Apple is returning our calls on the issue.
If a shortcut acts unpredictably in some applications, this 
is why.
 Select a file in the Finder and then choose
Finder➪Services➪Mail➪Send File.
This brings up the Mail application. A new
e-mail is already created with the file
attached.
 Select some text in any application that sup-
ports Services and then choose Application
Menu➪Services➪Mail➪Send Selection.
This brings up the Mail application. A new
e-mail is created with the selected text in the
body.

Mail’s Send To: This Mail Service automatically
creates a new e-mail message addressed to the
selected text (presumably an e-mail address).

Make New Sticky Note: The Make New Sticky
Note Service creates a new sticky note from
selected content (be it text or an image; see
Figure 29-6).
• Figure 29-6: The Make New Sticky Note Service takes a
selected image and makes a new sticky note
with it.
You can also trigger the Make New Sticky Note
Service with the Ô-Shift-Y keyboard shortcut
(assuming that the application doesn’t have its
own Ô-Shift-Y shortcut, see the sidebar
“Services and their keyboard shortcomings”).

Search with Google: This Service searches
Google (in your default Web browser), using
selected text as the search terms.

Adding Services
221
Adding Services
You can obtain a few freeware and shareware appli-
cations that add to and improve on the default set of
Services. These Services add functionality in any
application. For example:

DEVONtechnologies offers several free Service
tools (www.devon-technologies.com/products/
freeware/freeware.php), such as
 AntiWordService, which allows you to open
Microsoft Word documents in any Cocoa text
editor
 BlueService, which enables you to send text to
a Bluetooth device (assuming your computer
is Bluetooth-enabled and the device is nearby)
Bluetooth is a wireless technology that works
over a limited range. We discuss it in good
detail in Technique 55.
 CalcService, which performs calculations
 EasyFind, which is a search tool
 HotService, which allows you to use Devon’s
Services through a keyboard shortcut
 WordService, for common conversions of text
(like changing the case or switching between
straight and curly quotation marks)

The SearchGoogle Service (http://gu.st/proj/
SearchGoogle.service, free) automatically
searches Google (by using your default Web
browser) for the selected text.
Despite its name, the SearchGoogle Service can
also perform searches at Amazon.com and the
iTunes Music Store.

CleverKeys (www.cleverkeys.com, free) looks up
definitions and synonyms online and links to
Amazon.com for shopping purposes. It installs as
both a Service and a contextual menu, so it works
even in those applications that don’t support
Services.

ICeCoffEE (http://web.sabi.net/nriley/
software, free) adds a number of Services but also
makes all your Services available as contextual
menus (in applications that support Services).
Most of these tools come with their own installers.
You can install tools without installers by dropping
them in the /Library/Services directory. (Most
Services require you to log out and log back in for
them to take effect.)

Surfing with Safari
W
hether you’re surfing the Web for personal or business use, hav-
ing the right tools and knowing how to get the most out of them
goes a long way toward improving your experience. Safari is
Apple’s default Web browser, and it should be your preferred tool for
browsing. Not only is it free with Tiger, but it’s also a pretty good
browser.
This technique shows most everything you need to know about using
Safari quickly and easily. (Searching with Google and managing bookmarks
merit their own techniques.) Although Web surfing is largely a mouse-
driven activity, we begin with some useful keyboard shortcuts that you
ought to know. Then we cover the different Safari preferences settings
and why and how you should set them. After that, you find out about the
AutoFill tool, which saves you countless minutes that you would other-
wise spend filling out Web forms. Finally, we introduce to you Safari’s new
feature — support for RSS (Really Simple Syndication) — which can save
you lots of surfing time!
If you use Safari often, check out Technique 31. It covers many cus-
tomization tools for tweaking Safari’s behavior and adding features. 
Navigation Shortcuts
You can surf the Net without using an input device (your mouse, track-
ball, or whatever), but the Web is still a mostly mouse-driven world.
Despite that, you might find these navigation-related keyboard shortcuts
really useful:

Ô-N: Creates a new browser window.

Ô-T: Opens a new tab in the current window.


Ô-Shift-→and Ô-Shift-←: Rotates among tabs
within a window.
Ô-Shift-[ and Ô-Shift-] also rotates among tabs
within a window.

Tab key: Normally moves from element to ele-
ment within a Web page.
For most Web sites, you can skip the www
at the beginning of the URL without conse-
quence. You can almost always skip the http://
part. In fact, you can access many common
Web sites by using a bare minimum of typing:
apple, microsoft, espn, adobe, and so forth.
(Whether this works for you depends on your
browsing history, but it’s worth trying.)
Standard Shortcuts
All the common Tiger keyboard commands work in
Safari:

Ô-O: Opens a file (if you want to open a saved
Web page from your hard drive).

Ô-W: Closes the open window.

Ô-S: Saves a document.

Ô-P: Prints the open document.

Ô-A: Selects everything.

Ô-C: Copies selected text to the Clipboard.

Ô-X: Cuts selected text (which is much less use-
ful in Safari than in other applications).

Ô-V: Pastes Clipboard contents where the 
cursor is.

Ô-Z: Undoes the last action.

Ô-Shift-Z: Redoes the last undone action.

Ô-F: Brings up the Find dialog (see Figure 30-2).
Safari supports tabbed browsing, which is the
ability to open multiple Web pages within a
single browser window. We discuss this in
detail in “Working with tabbed browsing.”

Ô-[ (opening brace): Goes back one page.

Ô-] (closing brace): Goes forward one page (to a
page you have previously visited).
Back and forth navigation is represented by
two sets of keyboard shortcuts. The standard
Mac shortcuts that use braces ([ and ]) work
like they do in the Finder. The standard short-
cuts for other browsers (using Ô plus the left-
and right-arrow keys) also function.

Ô-L: Highlights the address bar (or location win-
dow) and places the cursor in it. 
If no browser window is open, this command
opens a new browser window and places the cur-
sor in the address bar (see Figure 30-1).
• Figure 30-1: Use Ô-L to access the address bar.

Ô-. (period): Stops a page from loading.

Ô-R: Reloads the page.

Ô-Shift-H: Goes to your home page (as set in the
Safari preferences).

Ô-` (accent grave) or ~ (tilde): Rotates among
the open windows.

Other Shortcuts
227
• Figure 30-2: Safari’s Find dialog.

Ô-E: Adds a selection to the Find Clipboard.
The Find Clipboard (see also Technique 27) is
a separate Clipboard from the standard one.
You can add text to it by pressing Ô-E (after
selecting text) and then perform searches by
pressing Ô-G.

Ô-G: Finds the next occurrence of text after
using Find at least once.

Ô-Shift-G: Goes to the previously found item.

Ô-H: Hides Safari.

Ô-Option-H: Hides every other application.

Ô-Q: Quits Safari.

Ô-, (comma): Brings up the preferences panel
(see Figure 30-3).
• Figure 30-3: Safari’s General preferences panel.
Other Shortcuts
These keyboard shortcuts can save you time and
steps:

Ô-= (equal sign): Increases text size.
The Increase Text Size keyboard shortcut is
technically pressing the Ô and + keys at the
same time. But because pressing the Shift key
to make the plus sign is inconvenient, you can
get away with Ô-=.

Ô- -  (minus sign): Decreases text size.

Ô-K: Sets Safari to block pop-up ads.

Ô-: (colon; you could also think of this as Ô-
Shift-;): Brings up the Spelling dialog (see 
Figure 30-4).
• Figure 30-4: Apple’s spelling tool works in Safari.

Ô-; (semicolon): Checks your spelling (without
opening the Spelling dialog).
Turn on the Check Spelling as You Type option
(on Edit➪Spelling) to look smarter when you
fill out forms. After it’s enabled, text you enter
in forms is spell checked automatically.

Ô-D: Brings up the Add Bookmark prompt.

Ô-Shift-D: Adds a bookmark without using a
prompt.

Technique 30: Surfing with Safari
228
Setting Preferences
Adjusting the Safari preferences goes a long way
toward improving your Web-browsing experience.
Most of the options are easy to comprehend, so we
discuss those that most directly improve how
quickly and easily you can use the application.
Specifically, we focus on the features that you can
adjust within the General, Tabs, and Security sec-
tions of the preferences panel. (You encounter a cou-
ple of the other sections later in this technique and
in the next one.) To address the Safari preferences,
press Ô-, (comma) or choose Preferences from the
Safari menu.
Setting General preferences
The General panel (refer to Figure 30-3) affects your
entire Internet surfing experience. The best timesav-
ing techniques here are

Set your default Web browser. Although you
might use many different browsers at once (par-
ticularly for graphic design or Web develop-
ment), you should identify a primary browser.
The benefit is that every URL you click in an
e-mail, iChat session, or document automatically
opens in your preferred Web browser. Strangely,
this setting is in the Safari browser, not an
Internet preferences panel (so you use Safari to
make Firefox your default Web browser).

Set new windows to open with an empty page.
Save yourself loading time by choosing Empty
Page from the New Windows Open With drop-
down list. Every time you press Ô-N (new
browser window), a blank window is opened,
ready for you to type the address. When you
want to go to your home page or bookmarks, just
press Ô-Shift-H or Ô-Option-B, respectively.

Set your home page. Your home page can be
anything — not necessarily a traditional, cus-
tomizable site like Yahoo!, Apple.Netscape.com,
or the one provided by your ISP. 
If you’d rather not be interrupted while you’re
surfing, quickly bookmark a site by pressing
Ô-Shift-D. The bookmark is added to your
Bookmarks Menu. You can edit and reorgan-
ize your bookmarks later with the steps in
Technique 32.
Mice and Safari
A couple of mouse features can improve your Web surfing
experience.
A mouse with a scroll wheel lets you simply rotate the wheel
to move up and down within a Web page. This saves you
the time and hassle of switching back and forth between
your mouse and the keyboard. Your mice even scroll side-
ways within a page if you hold down the Shift key while
using the scroll wheel. Some mouse software (like
Kensington’s MouseWorks, www.kensington.com) lets you
set the scroll wheel to act as a button click if you press it.
If you have a programmable mouse, you can set one of the
buttons to act as a Control-click, enacting the contextual
menus. What you see in the contextual menu depends
upon what you Control-click:

If you just click a Web page without selecting any text,
you can view the HTML source, save the page, or
print it.

If you select some text and press Control-click, you
can copy that text or use it as a Google search term.

If you Control-click an image or a link, you’re given
different options, such as opening the link in a new
window or downloading the image to your computer.
You can use the mouse in even more innovative ways 
if you use Cocoa Gestures (www.bitart.com/Cocoa
Gestures.html, free). This shareware application lets you
associate commands with mouse movements made while
holding down the primary mouse button. For example, you
can set Cocoa Gestures so that if you hold down the mouse
button and move the mouse to the left, Safari goes back to
the previous page. Gestures are an odd concept to wrap
your head around, but you’ll love them after you start using
them. They let you perform common tasks without switch-
ing over to the keyboard or moving your cursor up to the
proper buttons.

Setting Preferences
229
In the past, Larry made Google his home page,
but now he’s just as likely to use www.espn.com
(which must be checked several times per day).
Your home page — like your Home directory
in the Finder — can be quickly viewed by
pressing the Ô-Shift-H keyboard shortcut.
(Both shortcuts only work within each specific
application.)

Set where Safari saves downloaded files. When
your browser downloads a file, you want as little
interruption as possible:
 Use the Save Downloaded Files To drop-down
list to have Safari automatically download
files to either the Desktop (where you can eas-
ily find them) or to a spare hard drive or parti-
tion (where they’re out of the way).
 In the Remove Download List Items drop-
down list, select the Upon Successful
Download option to have downloaded items
automatically removed after a download is
successfully completed.
 Clear the Open “Safe” Files After Downloading
check box, so that you aren’t interrupted.
If you do this, you can easily see and access
your downloaded files by Ô-Option-clicking
the Desktop (which hides all other applica-
tions in the process).

Set Safari to open links from applications in a
new window. Select the In a New Window radio
button.
Without this option selected, every URL that you
click in any application wipes out the contents of
the current browser window. (If you click several
links within an e-mail, as an example, each
replaces its predecessor.) To look through them
all, you would need to do some savvy navigation
within the same browser window. Avoid the has-
sle and just have Safari create a new window for
each new link. They’re easy enough to cycle
through (Ô-`) or close (Ô-W) anyway.
To adjust the appearance of the browser win-
dow, you can show/hide the address bar, sta-
tus bar, and Bookmark Bar by either using the
options on the View menu or by using the
keyboard shortcuts (Ô-Shift-| to toggle the
address bar off and on, Ô-/ for the status bar,
and Ô-B for the Bookmark Bar).
Working with tabbed browsing
Tabbed browsing is a relative newcomer to the
world of Web browsers, and it’s a most welcome
addition.
Tabbed browsing lets you have multiple documents
(Web pages) nicely organized and displayed within
one document window. Each page has its own tab
that you can click for access quickly and easily. This
helps keep things organized during regular use and
lets you access bookmarks in novel ways.
To set up tabbed browsing:
1.
Click the Tabs icon on the Safari preferences
panel (see Figure 30-5).
• Figure 30-5: Enable tabbed browsing from the Tabs panel.
2.
Select the Enable Tabbed Browsing check box.
3.
Make sure that the Select New Tabs As They
Are Created check box is deselected.
One of the biggest benefits of tabbed browsing is
that you can click links without disrupting the
flow of reading through a page, so selecting this

Technique 30: Surfing with Safari
230

The Ô-Shift-→shortcut rotates one tab to the
right.
The Ô-Shift-] shortcut also rotates one tab to the
right.

Pressing Ô-Shift-←rotates one tab to the left.
The Ô-Shift-[ shortcut also rotates one tab to the
left.

Hold down the Option key while clicking a link to
view it in a new window (as opposed to a tab).
If tabbed browsing is enabled, holding down
the Option key when you click a link opens
that link in a new window, as opposed to
opening it as a tab. If tabbed browsing isn’t
enabled, holding down the Option key when
you click a link downloads the link to your
computer.

Use Option-Shift-click to open a link in a new win-
dow in front of the active window.
The keyboard shortcuts for tabs come down to
this: Ô means a new tab, and Shift means that
the new tab should be selected (opened in
front). Option makes a new window, so press-
ing Option-Shift makes a new window in front
of the others.
If a browser window has multiple tabs

Pressing Ô-W closes the current tab.

Clicking the little X icon next to the tab’s title
closes that tab. (This goes for any tab and not
just the active one.)

Clicking the window’s red button in the upper-
left corner closes the entire window and every
tab in it.

Control-click a tab’s title to see a contextual
menu (see Figure 30-7). With this menu you can
close that tab or all the others, or reload that tab
or every other.
option defeats that purpose. If you want to imme-
diately view a tabbed link, hold down Ô-Shift
while clicking a link. Otherwise, leave this 
check box clear so that each tab appears in the
background.
4.
Make sure that the Always Show Tab Bar check
box is also deselected.
The tab bar automatically appears and disap-
pears as needed, so you don’t need to have it
always hanging around. (That just uses up
screen space.)
If you find all of these shortcuts hard to
remember, just be certain to keep the status
bar visible. It shows you what each action does
before you take it. For example, if you hold
down the Ô key while hovering over a link,
the status bar reads Go to whatever-URL-
the-link-is in a new tab behind the
current one. Ô-click the link and Safari does
just that.
To use tabbed browsing:

Hold down the Ô key while clicking a link to view
it in a tab (see Figure 30-6).
• Figure 30-6: A browser window with multiple tabs.

Hold down the Ô and Shift keys while clicking a
link to view it in a new tab immediately. (In other
words, open the new tab in front of the existing
tab.)

Blocking Pop-Up Windows
231
• Figure 30-7: Contextual menus work on tabs in Safari.
If you enter any text in the address bar or
Google search bar and press Ô-Return, the
result opens in a new tab. Pressing Ô-Shift-
Return opens it in a new tab at the front.
Blocking Pop-Up Windows
Pop-up windows, the Web’s version of spam, are one
of the most annoying things around (except for
maybe Geico commercials, that is). Fortunately, you
don’t have to see pop-ups if you don’t want to. We
highly recommend that you do one of the following
to block pop-up windows:

While in Safari, press Ô-K to turn on pop-up win-
dow blocking (pressing it again turns pop-up win-
dow blocking back off, if you miss the extra
windows).

In the Security panel of the Safari preferences,
mark the Block Pop-Up Windows check box.
The nice thing about this Safari feature is that pop-
up windows that you request (for example, by click-
ing a link) still appear. Windows requested by the
page itself (read: advertisements for travel deals,
super-fast weight loss, and phenomenal hair
regrowth) never appear.
Setting Safari to block pop-up windows saves
you a lifetime of effort spent closing annoying
little windows. You’re still on your own with
the Geico commercials (and that stupid
gecko), though!
Caching, history, cookies, and you: 
Your browsing history
Web browsers use many concepts behind the scenes so
you can surf the Web faster:

History records places you visit. You can access them
again by either using the History menu or letting the
application automatically complete the URL when you
begin typing it. 
You can clear the entire history by using the Clear
History option at the bottom of the History menu.
(You can’t set a default number of days or pages to
track.)

Cache saves text, images, videos, and other content to
your hard drive. The next time the page is loaded,
Safari can recall content from the disk without waiting
to download it again.
Most browsers let you limit the size of the Web page
cache saved by your browser (which keeps your cache
from getting too big). However, Safari doesn’t let you
adjust the amount of disk space used by its cache. (In
fact, Safari provides few of the usual browser options
for such advanced concepts as refreshing the browser
and managing your history.) Instead, you simply
empty the cache when you feel like it. To empty the
cache, either choose Safari➪Empty Cache or use the
Ô-Option-E shortcut. Either of these makes Safari
rebuild each page directly from the source, without
relying upon any cached materials. This is particularly
useful if you’re creating Web pages and want to
ensure that Safari is reflecting the most recent
changes.

Cookies are controlled on the Security tab. There you
can adjust how Safari handles cookies, or you can view
stored cookies by clicking the Show Cookies button. In
the resulting window, you can delete any cookies by
selecting them from the list and clicking Remove (or
by clicking the Remove All button to really sweep
away the cookie crumbs).

Technique 30: Surfing with Safari
232
Safari’s AutoFill tool is another reason to use
your Address Book: That’s where Safari gets its
information from, after all. Furthermore, if you
move, you need only to change your address
record in the Address Book, and Safari’s
AutoFill values are automatically updated.

Usernames and Passwords: Safari can help with
two types of username/password combinations: 
 The most common are those associated with
login forms, like when you log in to
Amazon.com or NewYorkTimes.com. 
 Less common are combinations that limit
access to Web pages or sections of a Web
page. 
These use a separate pop-up window
(although it isn’t the same kind of browser
pop-up window used by advertisers), not a
standard Web-based form. 
In both cases, Safari — if you let it — remembers
the username and password for each individual
Web site.
The passwords stored by Safari are safe
because they can’t be retrieved without a per-
son knowing your system’s master password.
Safari uses the keychain (see Technique 53) to
store these passwords, where they are only
visible after revalidating using the account’s
login password.

Other forms: This catchall option records (if you
want it to) the text you entered in, er, other
forms. These values might be for a preferences
page of a Web site or an address entered into
MapQuest.
After you enable AutoFill, it automatically fills in val-
ues when you encounter personal information forms
(if the Web site’s form inputs are named logically so
AutoFill recognizes them). If the AutoFill doesn’t
immediately engage, use the Ô-Shift-A shortcut to
activate it.
If you’re security-conscious (or paranoid), you have a cou-
ple of cover-up options:

Wipe out your cache, history, cookies, AutoFill values,
and Google searches all in one fell swoop by choosing
Safari➪Reset Safari.

Always make yourself invisible by enabling Private
Browsing on the Safari menu. With this feature on, no
record is kept of your activities, such as the sites you
visited or the files you download.
Saving Time with AutoFill Forms
Surfing the Internet often comes down to filling out
forms. Passwords, Search boxes, order pages, and
other forms require you to constantly enter the
same information again and again. You can save
yourself tedium and time with Safari’s AutoFill Forms
feature.
Select the check boxes on the AutoFill panel of the
preferences dialog (as shown in Figure 30-8) to
enable three types of AutoFill:
• Figure 30-8: The AutoFill preferences panel.

Using Info from My Address Book Card: This
option lets Safari fill in your name, company
name, e-mail address, phone number, and mail-
ing address, using the information you’ve estab-
lished in your Address Book record. 
This AutoFill option saves the most time and cre-
ates the fewest security risks.

Managing Usernames and Passwords
233
The AutoFill tool marks in yellow the form
inputs that it fills out. If you have multiple
options for an input (for example, you might
have several e-mail addresses), begin typing
the first few letters of the one that you want
and then select it from the option menu that
appears.
For usernames and passwords, and for other forms,
Safari automatically fills these out at a Web site by
using the values you entered in the previous visit.
Managing Usernames and
Passwords
When you first encounter a site that requires a user-
name and password, create a username and pass-
word and then submit them. Safari then asks you
whether you want to save this password as an
AutoFill entry, giving you three options (check them
out in Figure 30-9):
• Figure 30-9: Let Safari manage your usernames and
passwords.

Never for This Website

Not Now

Yes
For almost every instance, choosing to have Safari
remember the values is the smart move, saving you
the time of re-entering that information upon your
next visit. If the site in question is of a particularly
sensitive nature (such as your online banking), you
might want to ask Safari not to remember the values
and never prompt you again. If you aren’t certain
what to do, opt for door number three (Not Now),
and you’re prompted again the next time that you
enter that username and password.
To have Safari forget some remembered values
1.
Click the Edit button next to User Names and
Passwords of the AutoFill panel (refer to 
Figure 30-8).
2.
In the resulting panel, select the site whose val-
ues should be forgotten (see Figure 30-10).
• Figure 30-10: Forget submitted username and password
combinations by using this window.
3.
Click the Remove button.
Do not click Remove All in this window unless
you really want to spend the time retyping
every username and password everywhere
you go.
4.
Repeat Steps 2 and 3 as necessary.
5.
Click Done when you finish.
AutoFill can slow down Safari’s performance in
some instances (because Safari must spend
time looking to autofill forms there). If you find
that a particular Web site is becoming too slow
(Safari hangs a bit before loading it), delete the
AutoFill record for that site by using the
AutoFill preferences panel. Just click the Edit
button next to Other forms, select the prob-
lematic Web site from the list, and click
Remove.

4. Mark the resulting page for SnapBack by
choosing Mark Page for SnapBack on the
History menu.
5. View all the books you want and add them to
your cart as desired.
We highly recommend picking up a few copies
of Mac OS X Tiger Timesaving Techniques For
Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
6. Return to the original Mac OS X books page
(what you set in Step 4) by clicking the orange
SnapBack arrow.

Every Google search page is marked for
SnapBack. The Google Search box appears next
to the address bar (you can show and hide it by
using the View menu) and has its own SnapBack,
entirely independent from the location/address
SnapBack.
Here’s an example of how you might use this
technique:
1. Click in the Google Search box to place your
cursor there.
2. Enter your search terms and press Return.
For example, you can search for “Larry
Ullman” or “Marc Liyanage.”
3. Click any link returned by Google to visit that
page.
4. If you need to return to the Google search
results page, click the SnapBack icon found in
the Google Search box.
The keyboard shortcuts for working with 
SnapBack are

Ô-Option-K: Marks a page for SnapBack.

Ô-Option-P: Goes to the SnapBack page.

Ô-Option-S: Returns to the Google search
SnapBack.
Marking Pages with SnapBack
A really, really, really great feature in Safari is
SnapBack, which is kind of like a temporary book-
mark. There are two different SnapBacks in Safari:
one for the main page of a Web site and another for
your Google searches. With SnapBack, you can des-
ignate a place as a SnapBack page and then return to
that page immediately without being forced to navi-
gate back through all the intermediary pages.
An alternative to both the SnapBack and the
History features is to use the browser win-
dow’s title bar. Ô-click the title and you see a
menu of previously visited pages (Figure 30-11),
like the path hierarchy of a Finder window.
• Figure 30-11: See, and quickly go back to, places you’ve
been in a Web site by Ô-clicking the
browser window title.
Safari automatically manages the two SnapBack
pages:

When you go to any site, Safari marks it for
SnapBack. After you browse from there, the
orange SnapBack arrow appears. Clicking it
returns you to the original page. This also works
for bookmarks you load.
Here’s an example of how you might use this 
feature:
1. Open Amazon.com in Safari.
2. Click the Books tab.
The original URL is now marked for SnapBack.
3. Navigate through the Browse Subjects pages
to access the books on, say, Mac OS X.

Working with Really Simple Syndication
235
Working with Really Simple
Syndication
New to Safari 2.0 is support for RSS, which stands for
Really Simple Syndication. Some Web sites provide
RSS feeds of their content. When you access these
feeds by using Safari or another RSS reader, you’re
presented with a synopsis of that site’s content (see
Figure 30-12). The specific details depends upon the
content provider, but normally you see headlines,
short summaries, and posted dates. If you’re inter-
ested in pursuing an item, click its link to go to the
full account.
• Figure 30-12: Viewing the New York Times’ RSS feed for
sports stories.
If you regularly visit certain sites, are a news
junkie, or have specific interests (such as the
latest Mac or iTunes info), using RSS can be
the most efficient way to access information.
You can use RSS to get a quick glimpse of
what a site has to offer without extraneous
images, advertising, or even outdated and pre-
viewed content!
You can access an RSS feed in different ways:

If a site offers an RSS feed, there’s usually a
link somewhere on the site. Click this link so
that it opens in Safari. 

Use the existing list of RSS bookmarks. Safari
comes with dozens of RSS feeds bookmarked for
you. You can access them through the All RSS
Feeds category (see Figure 30-13) or through the
organized RSS Feeds folder.
• Figure 30-13: Safari has pre-bookmarked a ton o’ RSS
feeds for you.

Have your browser autodetect the RSS feed.
If a site is set up properly, it contains HTML
tags in the head section that announce the RSS
feeds to the browser. When visiting a site with
RSS feeds, Safari shows an RSS icon in the
address bar.

Bookmark RSS feeds yourself. To Safari, an RSS
feed is much like any other Web site, meaning
that you can bookmark it — and organize your
RSS bookmarks — as you would any other page.
After you find the RSS feeds you like, here’s how you
can most easily read them:

Technique 30: Surfing with Safari
236

Use the Search box on the right side of the
browser window to restrict the list of articles.
The Search box works much like a Finder win-
dow Search box.

Move the Article Length slider all the way to
the right to see the longest possible description
of each item.

Click one of the Sort By links to change how
the items are ordered. This is particularly useful
if you’re viewing links from multiple feeds or
from a large date range.

Use the Recent Articles links to restrict items to
a specific time period. This is good for both
restricting the results to the most recent items as
well as trying to find an older item.
If you’re big into RSS but Safari’s handling of it
doesn’t do much for you, check out Pulp
Fiction from Freshly Squeezed Software
(http://freshlysqueezedsoftware.com/
products/pulpfiction, $25). This applica-
tion is like a cross between the Mail applica-
tion and how Safari does RSS. A demo is
available for you to test drive the full version,
and a free, scaled-down “lite” version is also
available.

Use the RSS preferences panel (see Figure
30-14) to adjust RSS settings. Specific important
concepts are having Safari automatically
 Update your feeds
 Color new articles
 Remove outdated articles
• Figure 30-14: Safari has a separate preferences panel for
adjusting how it treats RSS feeds.

Customizing Safari
S
afari is the official Web browser of the Apple world. Fortunately, it’s
also a really good browser, with many smart features. Another
advantage that the Safari browser has over its competition (the
exception being Firefox) is the number of ways you can customize its
behavior to suit your needs. This technique introduces a dozen or so util-
ities that customize how Safari runs and what features it has. These alter-
ations run the gamut from tweaks that everyone can appreciate to
specialized hacks that only Web developers might want.
For starters, we cover some tools for changing the surfing experience as
a whole. From there we focus specifically on applications that improve
Safari’s searching capability. Then you see a couple utilities that improve
how Safari handles bookmarks. Finally, we devote a section to using
JavaScript with Safari in ways you might not have come up with yourself.
Most of these utilities either have their own installer or are separate
applications that you run just like any other. In a worst-case scenario,
you might have to use a README file that tells you how to get the
utility working. Just understand that the changes won’t take affect
until the next time you start Safari. As for undoing the effects of
these utilities, most of them also have a tool for resetting the changes.
With some, you must delete a file installed in a special location.
Improving Your Surfing Experience
This first category of Safari hacks affects how Safari as a whole looks and
behaves. Some of the applications and modifications you see here are
mostly cosmetic, but others can save you heaps of time. You may not
need to tap into all these resources but should certainly appreciate what
a couple of them has to offer. The most useful resources to know are the
following:

Cascading style sheets: If you’re comfortable
with cascading style sheets (CSSes), create your
own style sheet and set Safari to always use it
(on the Advanced preferences panel). How much
or how little you dictate in the style sheet is up
to you. In-depth coverage of CSSes is outside the
scope of this book, but if you want to read up on
the subject, check out Cascading Style Sheets For
Dummies, by Damon Dean and company (Wiley
Publishing, Inc.).

Safari Aquafier (www.scifience.net/aquafier.
html, donationware): It replaces the brushed
metal look of Safari’s windows with a brighter,
more pleasing appearance. In essence, it changes
the overall look of the Safari application.

SafariSpeed (www.scifience.net/safarispeed.
html, donationware): SafariSpeed perks up your
browsing experience by doing two things:
 It removes a delay built into Safari that loads
pages after a quick pause. 
 It turns off Safari’s support for favorite icons
(customized icons that represent a site and
appear next to its address, in your book-
marks, and so forth).
To make these changes, you just need to run the
SafariSpeed application once.

Safari Enhancer (www.lordofthecows.com/
safari_enhancer.php, free): Safari Enhancer
does a lot for your browsing experience. For
starters, it enables the Debug Menu (see Fig-
ure 31-1, and also check out the sidebar) and 
lets you control your overall and favorite icon
caches. It also tweaks how hyperlinks appear,
lets you drop the brushed metal appearance of
Safari, and adds a few modifications to the
Search box. In short, Safari Enhancer does what
several other utilities do, but in one fell swoop.
Just run the application and select the appropri-
ate options in order to enhance Safari as you 
see fit.
• Figure 31-1: You can enable the Debug Menu in Safari by
using third-party tools.
Safari’s Debug Menu
If you’re a really techie user, you’ll appreciate this little trick:
Safari has a Debug Menu, which isn’t present by default.
The easiest way to make this menu visible is to use Safari
Debugger (www.scifience.com/debugger.html, dona-
tionware), an AppleScript that lets you enable or disable the
Debug Menu. (For the record, many of the other applications
that we list in this technique also enable the Debug Menu.)
The Debug Menu offers many features that Web develop-
ers can use, including

The ability to have Safari identify itself as a different
browser

Import and export bookmarks from other browsers

A tool for testing how pages load
The menu has quite a few other features, and even the
most basic Safari user can appreciate the Debug Menu’s
option of listing all of Safari’s shortcuts. 

Saft (http://haoli.dnsalias.com/Saft, $10):
Saft brings oodles of features to Safari. Here’s a
quick list of some of the most useful features:
 You gain the ability to search your browsing
history.
 Saft lets you use the Search box for non-
Google searches.
 It installs the Debug Menu.
 Saft has an expanded PDF export feature, let-
ting you customize what kind of PDF Safari
can create.

Pith (www.blacktree.com/apps/pith/index.
html, free): If you tend to have a lot of Web pages
open at once, you’ll really like Pith. This little
utility uses a window to show the list of currently
open sites. Switching from one to another is then
just a matter of clicking an icon instead of trying
to hunt through multiple browser windows.
Another nice benefit is that if Safari crashes, Pith
can recall all of the previously open sites.

SafariSource (www.tildesoft.com/Misc.html,
free): SafariSource works with SIMBL (see the
sidebar) to do one thing: provide a color syntax
highlighting when you view the source of a Web
page. So instead of looking at all black code,
HTML tags appear in one color, HTML attributes
in another, plain text in a third, and so on.
For Web designers, this extra nicety is an
absolute must!
What is SIMBL?
SIMBL (Smart InputManager Bundle Loader) lets you alter
how some applications in Mac OS X function. It provides
an interface through which different plug-ins can tie into
applications such as Safari, iChat, and the Terminal. You 
can get SIMBL from http://culater.net/software/
SIMBL/SIMBL.php, although it also comes in the Safari
Source download.
To install SIMBL, the SIMBL.bundle file is placed with a
SIMBL folder in the /Library/InputManagers directory.
Then plug-ins can be stored in the /Library/
Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins folder (you can
also install SIMBL into your own Home directory).
In this technique, we mention three plug-ins for SIMBL:
SafariSource, PithHelmet, and fiwt. Another good one is iCar
(iChat Auto-Reply, www.pygmysoftware.com/software/
icar), which makes iChat’s auto-reply feature work better
with AOL Instant Messenger. More subtle plug-ins are
around, such as InvisRay (www.davidestes.net/invisray
html), which changes the transparency of windows.

PithHelmet (www.culater.net/software/
PithHelmet/PithHelmet.php, free): PithHelmet
takes the idea of pop-up blocking one step fur-
ther. It can block advertisements, Flash and
Shockwave animations, and sounds. With it you
can also more finely tune your cookie settings
(for example, allowing cookies only from the site
you’re visiting).

Safari Extender (http://batista.org/extender.
html, $10): Safari Extender works as a contextual
menu within Safari. It has a slew of tab-related
features (if you’re tab-happy) and a few Mail-
related shortcuts. It also lets you easily increase
or decrease the font size and load or not load
images in a Web page.

fiwt (www.nondeterministic.net/hack/fiwt,
free): Another SIMBL plug-in, fiwt (find it while
typing) lets you search for text on a page without
bringing up the Find dialog. After you load a Web
page, start typing the word you’re looking for
and fiwt highlights the first occurrence. Press
the backslash key to find the next occurrence.

Technique 31: Customizing Safari
240
uses the concept of keywords to let you search
non-Google sources. For example, the keyword
imdb might stand for the site www.imdb.com (the
Internet Movie Database). So searching with
imdb Scorsese in the Search box effectively
searches that site, instead of Google. This is but
one example. The product comes pre-configured
with many keywords, and you can easily add
your own.

Sogudi (www.atamadison.com/w/kitzkikz.php,
free): Sogudi is a lot like SafariKeywords, letting
you quickly search sites by using abbreviations.
One difference is that it lets you perform these
searches from the address bar. It also allows you
to just quickly access your favorite sites (like
going to www.apple.com by just typing a in the
address bar and then pressing Return).
Contextual menus and Services offer shortcuts
for Search with Google and Open URL, thanks
to Safari. With these, you can quickly start
common Safari tasks from within other appli-
cations. See Techniques 14 (on contextual
menus) and 29 (on Services) for more.
Shareware utilities like LaunchBar and
QuickSilver also tie into Safari for searching
and accessing bookmarks.
Bookmark-Related Utilities
When you have several dozen bookmarks, keeping
them organized, finding particular ones, and making
sure they’re still valid becomes nothing short of a
chore. For better or for worse, Safari comes with a
few dozen bookmarks out of the box (not even
counting the RSS feeds)! To make your bookmarking
life easier and more productive, use these utilities
and be certain to read Technique 32.

SafariSorter (http://dearjerry.home.mind
spring.com/raisinland/SafariSorter/SafariS
orter.html, free): SafariSorter simply alphabet-
izes all your bookmarks and folders. It has a sur-
prising number of preferences that you can set
for alphabetization rules and the like (see Figure
Safari Search Enhancements
One important category of enhancements is search-
ing. You can customize how Safari’s Search box func-
tions. The default Google Search box — at the end of
the address bar — is fantastic, but you can make it
even better by using these products:

AcidSearch (www.pozytron.com/acidsearch,
free): This fine product adds different “channels”
to your Search box, letting you search Google
Images or Google News (see Figure 31-2). It also
lets you search other search engines instead of
Google.
• Figure 31-2: Change your Search box by using
AcidSearch.

SafariKeywords (http://safarikeywords.
sourceforge.net, free): SafariKeywords takes a
little thought to get used to but is very handy. It

31-3). If you have certain folders that are organ-
ized in a special way (like the Bookmarks Menu
or the Bookmarks Bar), you can exclude these.
Really, a very nice little application!
• Figure 31-3: SafariSorter automatically organizes your
bookmarks per your instructions.

Safari Menu (www.edot-studios.com, free): You
know how you’ll be working in Microsoft Excel
and absolutely, positively must check out
ESPN.com? Well, Safari Menu is the tool for you.
This utility creates a menu of your bookmarks
that is always available through the menu bar,
saving you a couple steps (switching to Safari,
opening a browser window, viewing the book-
marks collection, finding the bookmark, and 
double-clicking it).

iLynX (www.ios-software.com/index.php3?
page=projet&quoi=23, free): iLynX is a great
third-party bookmark manager. With it you can
synchronize bookmarks across multiple Web
browsers, make bookmarks available to any Web
browser, and easily share bookmarks.

SafariBookmarkChecker (www.coriolis.ch/
article22.html, free): Another one of our
favorites, you can use the SafariBookmark
Checker to make sure that URLs that you’ve
bookmarked are still good. It’s amazingly fast and
gives you a nice report on which bookmarks
were no longer reachable (see Figure 31-4).
• Figure 31-4: Check whether bookmarks are still good by
using SafariBookmarkChecker.
New in Safari 2.0 is the ability to search your
bookmark collection. Use the Search box at
the bottom of the Bookmarks window to find
the URL you’re looking for.
What Your Parents Never Told
You About JavaScript
JavaScript, which is most commonly used to add fea-
tures to Web pages, can be used independently of
Web sites and pages. By bookmarking JavaScript
code, you create a bookmarklet, adding functionality
to your Web browser. We show you how to create a
simple bookmarklet, and then point you toward
other good resources.
To clear up a common misconception,
JavaScript and the Java programming lan-
guage have nothing to do with each other.
Java is a very popular object-oriented pro-
gramming language used to make applications
that (theoretically) run on many different 
operating systems. JavaScript is a Web-based
tool. (Technically, JavaScript is now called
ECMAScript, although no one ever calls it that.)

Apple (www.apple.com/applescript/safari/
bookmarks.html): Apple has provided a couple
good examples in the Safari AppleScript pages.
Some tie into Sherlock (which doesn’t exist in
Tiger), but you’ll probably find the iTunes ones
to be quite handy.

Entropy.ch (www.entropy.ch/links/welcome.
php#BookmarksBar_Bookmarklets): This book’s
very own Marc Liyanage has a gaggle of book-
marklets available on his Web site (where you
can also stare in wonder at the vast number of
bookmarks he has amassed). His bookmarklets
are especially great for Web developers, with util-
ities that
 Validate the HTML or CSS of a page
 Show tables and DIV elements
 Let you send the current URL to someone in
an e-mail
 Resize the browser window

Jesse’s Bookmarklets Site (www.squarefree.
com/bookmarklets): This site has some very nice
bookmarklets, particularly for Web developers.

Favelets (http://tantek.com/favelets): Along
with the standard HTML and CSS validation
bookmarklets (or favelets, as this site calls
them), you can find nice ones for translating the
current page into other languages.
To install other people’s bookmarklets, all you
normally have to do is drag the link onto your
Bookmarks Bar. Because bookmarklets are
meant to be quick and useful, consider creat-
ing a folder (or several) on the Bookmarks Bar
in which you can store them.
Creating a print button
You probably find yourself printing the occasional
Web page, but it’s such a pain to choose File➪Print
or press Ô-P. Instead, make a JavaScript print but-
ton. Here’s how:
1.
Open a browser window in Safari.
2.
Type javascript:window.print(); in the address
bar, but don’t press Return (see Figure 31-5).
• Figure 31-5: You can type JavaScript code in the address
bar to make a bookmarklet.
3.
Drag the globe icon (left of the word javascript)
onto the Bookmarks Bar.
4.
At the prompt, give the bookmark a good
name, like Print.
5.
Click the Print icon in the Bookmarks Bar any-
time you want to print a page.
Downloading existing bookmarklets
If you don’t know how to code JavaScript or you sim-
ply don’t want to spend the time, use somebody
else’s work. Here are four great resources for book-
marklets:

Managing Bookmarks
Better
S
urfing the Internet would be a much more tedious process if it
weren’t for the advent of bookmarks. Bookmarks (or Favorites, as
they’re also called) are URLs that you save in a browser and then
organize the way you like for easy access. We don’t discuss bookmarks
much in previous techniques because they really merit their own discus-
sion, particularly if you use multiple browsers.
The focus in this technique is the Safari Web browser, which we recom-
mend you use as your default. We first talk about bookmark management
within Safari, and then we go into sharing bookmarks across multiple
browsers (which is a good thing whether you actively use multiple
browsers or just switched to a different one). Finally, we wrap up with
some tips and techniques for bookmark management that you might
want to employ.
Managing Bookmarks in Safari
Because we assume that you’re using Safari as your primary Web
browser, we cover bookmarks in that application most specifically.
Safari’s bookmarks tools have taken the best qualities from every other
browser and wrapped them into one package. With Safari, you have three
bookmark locations:

The Bookmarks window (see Figure 32-1): The Bookmarks window is
the least accessible (it just requires an extra click to access it) but
helps to manage all your bookmarks. The Bookmarks window is where
you store the majority of your bookmarks, and it’s also where you can
add, edit, or delete bookmarks that appear on the Bookmarks Bar and
Bookmarks Menu.

• Figure 32-3: The Bookmarks Bar appears underneath the
address bar.
A fourth related tool is the History menu. This
menu doesn’t contain bookmarks per se but is
rather a history of pages that you’ve visited.
Those URLs you’ve been to appear on the
History menu and within the Bookmarks win-
dow (the fifth item under Collections in the left
column of Figure 32-1). The History menu dis-
plays the most recent few pages visited, fol-
lowed by other pages grouped by the date on
which you were there.
To add bookmarks, access the Bookmarks window
or Bookmarks Bar. To create new folders for organiz-
ing your bookmarks (in the Bookmarks window),
you can use the Bookmarks Menu (refer to Figure
32-2) or the following keyboard shortcuts:

Ô-D: Creates a bookmark for the current page.

Ô-Shift-B: Toggles to show and hide the
Bookmarks Bar.

Ô-Option-B: Displays the Bookmarks window.

Ô-Shift-N: Creates a new folder within the
Bookmarks window.
Safari comes with many bookmarks and fold-
ers already grouped into News, Mac, Kids,
Sports, and more. This is important because
creating a folder for each category of Web
page that you want to bookmark helps you
find your bookmarks faster. Some good fold-
ers you might want to add are Work, Mac OS
X Software, Local Interest, and any other types
of pages that you visit frequently.

The Bookmarks Menu (see Figure 32-2): The
Bookmarks Menu lists bookmarks, which you
can access by selecting a site from the list. Figure


The Bookmarks Bar (see Figure 32-3): This is an
area intended for your most frequently used
bookmarks because they can appear in your
browser window at all times, making them the
easiest to access. The Bookmarks Bar can dis-
play individual URLs (like Apple and Amazon in
Figure 32-3) and folders of sites (News and
Localhost). It also provides a link to the
Bookmarks window (the open book icon on the
far left).

Managing Bookmarks in Safari
245
Bookmarking a page
To bookmark a page, follow these steps:
1.
Load the page in your Web browser.
2.
Press Ô-D.
This brings up the Add Bookmark prompt, as
shown in Figure 32-4.
• Figure 32-4: Use the Add Bookmark prompt to mark a
page.
3.
If desired, enter a new title for this bookmark.
The default bookmark name comes from the title
of the page as it appears in the browser win-
dow’s title bar. For some pages, this is quite long
or not very descriptive, so you might want to
devise a new name that makes sense to you.
4.
Use the drop-down list to select the location for
the bookmark.
An important part of managing your bookmarks
is placing them in the right folder in the first
place. If you’ve adequately organized your book-
marks, you already have a folder available to
store them in.
You can immediately add a site to your
Bookmarks Menu or Bookmarks Bar by choos-
ing the appropriate location from the Add
Bookmark prompt’s drop-down list (refer to
Figure 32-4). More immediately, you can add
a site to your Bookmarks Bar by dragging the
site’s icon (found just to the left of the URL in
the address bar) onto the Bookmarks Bar.
Using the Bookmarks window
The Bookmarks window is a special browser page
that you can use to view and manage your book-
marks. The left column (Collections; refer to Figure
32-1) shows the different groupings of bookmarks
that you have. These include Bookmarks Bar,
Bookmarks Menu, History, the folders that came
with Safari, and the folders that you create. When
you select an item in the Collections column, its con-
tents are listed in the right side of the window.
Here are some tips and techniques for working with
this window:

Create a new folder by pressing Ô-Shift-N or
clicking the + button at the bottom of the 
window.
Depending upon which plus sign you click,
you can create a new primary folder (by click-
ing at the bottom of the Collections column)
or a new secondary folder (by clicking at the
bottom of the Bookmark column). If you click
the + underneath the Bookmark column, a
new folder is created within the currently
selected Collection.

Alphabetize your folders by dragging and drop-
ping them to reorder them.

Don’t mess with the folders named Imported IE
Favorites or Imported Netscape/Mozilla
Favorites, if you have them. Leaving these fold-
ers intact lets you access bookmarks that you’ve
set in those browsers.

Nest related folders inside each other to main-
tain order without cluttering up the main set of
collections. For example, you might want to cre-
ate a Software folder inside the Mac folder or add
a Movies folder to Entertainment.

Rename a folder by pressing Return after you
select it.

If you want to copy a bookmark from one loca-
tion to another (from one folder to another or
from the Bookmarks window to the Bookmarks
Bar), hold down the Option key as you move it.

Technique 32: Managing Bookmarks Better
246
You aren’t really limited to a certain number of
bookmarks on the Bookmarks Bar, but if the
titles of all the bookmarks run longer than the
width of the browser window, some book-
marks won’t be shown. Instead, double arrows
appear at the far-right side of the bar, and you
need to click them to access the other book-
marks. This behavior is exactly the same as it
is with Finder window toolbars if the window
isn’t wide enough to show every tool.
To manage the Bookmarks Bar
1.
Open the Bookmarks window by pressing 
Ô-Option-B.
2.
Click the Bookmarks Bar title at the top of the
Collections column.
3.
In the right pane, delete any bookmark or
folder that you don’t want to appear on the
Bookmarks Bar by pressing Delete.
4.
Add any bookmark by dragging it from another
location into the Bookmarks Bar listing.
5.
Arrange the bookmarks by clicking and drag-
ging them to suit your preferences.
You can also add pages to the Bookmark Bar
by dragging the URL directly onto the bar in
the browser window. You can remove items by
dragging them off, and you can rearrange the
order by clicking and dragging the bookmark
names.
One of the best features of the Bookmarks Bar is the
ability to group bookmarks into folders. For exam-
ple, Safari already comes with the News folder on its
Bookmarks Bar, containing links for CNN.com, The
New York Times, BBC NEWS, and more. Folders on
the Bookmarks Bar are marked with a down-pointing
triangle, which displays a pop-up menu of the book-
marks in that folder when you click it, as shown in
Figure 32-5.
Using the Bookmarks Menu
The Bookmarks Menu is a useful tool, but be careful
not to place too many bookmarks there because it
can quickly become cluttered and less useful. The
two ways to add sites to the Bookmarks Menu are

Selecting Bookmarks Menu from the drop-down
list in the Add Bookmark prompt (refer to 
Figure 32-4).

Using the Bookmarks window (drag existing
bookmarks onto the Bookmarks Menu listing in
the Collections section).
To delete a bookmark from the menu, just do this:
1.
Open the Bookmarks window.
2.
Click the Bookmarks Menu title in the
Collections column.
3.
Select the bookmark to be deleted in the right
column.
4.
Press Delete.
While you’re in the Bookmarks window, you
can add folders to the Bookmarks Menu to
create an organized, hierarchical menu of
favorite sites. Doing so lets you put more
bookmarks in the menu without too much
clutter.
Working with the Bookmarks Bar
The Bookmarks Bar is a special section of the book-
marks world that can appear as part of the browser
window. The Bookmarks Bar has a limited amount of
visual real estate, so you must be judicious when
selecting Web pages to put there, but you have
plenty of configuration options.

Managing Bookmarks in Safari
247
• Figure 32-5: Bookmarks Bar folders are presented as
pop-up menus.
Here’s how to add a folder to your Bookmarks Bar:
1.
Open the Bookmarks window by pressing 
Ô-Option-B.
2.
Click the Bookmarks Bar title at the top of the
Collections column.
3.
Create a new folder by pressing Ô-Shift-N or
by clicking the + sign at the bottom of the
Bookmark column.
4.
Give the new folder a name.
5.
Drag all the bookmarks that you want to add to
the folder.
If you hold down the Option key while drag-
ging a bookmark into a folder, a copy of the
bookmark is placed there, and the original
remains.
6.
If desired, click the Auto Click box, which
appears between the Bookmark and Address
columns.
The Auto Click feature means that instead of pro-
viding a drop-down list of bookmarks in the
folder, clicking the folder name in the Bookmarks
Bar automatically opens every bookmark at
once, using multiple tabs.
Use bookmark folders to create groups of
related bookmarks. Use the Auto Click feature
to make a collection of related bookmarks to
be opened together (see Figure 32-6).
• Figure 32-6: Auto Click folders open all at once in a
multitabbed browser window.
Setting bookmark preferences in Safari
You can control Safari’s bookmarks somewhat by
using the Bookmarks preferences panel (see Figure
32-7), which you can access by choosing Safari➪
Preferences and clicking Bookmarks. With it, you can
decide whether to add Address Book or Bonjour
bookmarks to any of three places: the Bookmarks
Bar, the Bookmarks Menu, or the Collections panel
of the Bookmarks window.

Technique 32: Managing Bookmarks Better
248

Ô-click a bookmark on the Bookmarks Bar to
open it in a new tab.

Ô-click a Bookmarks Bar folder to open its con-
tents at once in separate tabs.

Use the Bookmarks Menu to access bookmarks
stored there.

Click the open book icon on the far left of
the Bookmarks Bar to access the Bookmarks 
window.

Choose the Open in Tabs option at the bottom of
the Bookmarks Menu (refer to Figure 32-2) to
open every menu bookmark at once (within a
single browser window but in separate tabs).
One of the coolest features of Safari is that it auto-
matically numbers your Bookmarks Bar bookmarks
in order from left to right so they’re accessible via a
keyboard shortcut. For example, in Larry’s
Bookmarks Bar (as shown in Figure 32-8), the Apple
bookmark is launched by pressing Ô-1, My Excite is
launched by pressing Ô-2, and so forth. Folders are
skipped in the numbering sequence so that (again
referring to Figure 32-8) PHP is associated with Ô-6.
• Figure 32-8: The Ô shortcuts for the Bookmarks Bar start
with 1 and are numbered from left to right.
This trick works for all the bookmarks not in folders
and even works if no browser window is open!
New to Safari 2.0 in Tiger is the ability to
search through your bookmark collection. At
the bottom of the Bookmarks window is a
standard Search box (see Figure 32-9). As you
enter search terms, Safari returns the qualified
bookmarks (using folder names, URLs, and
descriptions to compare against). Using the
Search box’s drop-down list, you can even
limit your search to specific collections.
• Figure 32-7: Add Address Book and Bonjour bookmarks
automatically using the Bookmarks
preferences panel.
If you select the Include Address Book check box
next to the Bookmarks Bar heading, for example,
Safari loads all the URLs stored in the Address Book
as a folder on your Bookmarks Bar. Each URL is
accessible through the person’s name with whom
it’s associated.
You can also tell Safari to include the Book-
marks Bar on the Bookmarks Menu. This is
worthwhile mainly if you don’t already display
the Bookmarks Bar.
Accessing Safari Bookmarks
After you organize and create all your bookmarks,
you need to access them with ease. Here’s all the
information you need to know:

Click a bookmark on the Bookmarks Bar to 
open it.

Click a folder on the Bookmarks Bar to view the
list of bookmarks in it (and then select from the
options, refer to Figure 32-5).

Sharing Bookmarks across Browsers
249
• Figure 32-9: Safari’s new search feature makes it easier to
find your bookmarks.
Sharing Bookmarks across
Browsers
The biggest downfall to using multiple Web browsers
or switching to a different browser is trying to re-
establish all your bookmarks. Fortunately, some of
the Web browsers have acknowledged this and 
can automatically import bookmarks from other
applications.

Safari automatically imports Internet Explorer
and Netscape/Mozilla bookmarks. (They appear
as folders in the Collections panel of the
Bookmarks window.)

Camino, Mozilla, and Netscape automatically list
Internet Explorer bookmarks.

Opera can import bookmarks from other applica-
tions in certain formats.
In Technique 42, we go over iSync, which is an
Apple tool. One of its features is the ability to
synchronize your Safari bookmarks with your
.Mac account, letting you access all your book-
marks online when you’re away from your
computer. It lets you synchronize Safari book-
marks across multiple computers as well.
If you have only a few bookmarks to move around,
your best bet is to drag and drop them from one
application to the other. Or, you can investigate one
of the many bookmark-management applications
available (most of them aren’t free) if you’re in a seri-
ous bookmark quandary. For example, if you’re mov-
ing from another browser to Safari or want to import
someone else’s Safari bookmarks into your Safari,
Safari Enhancer (www.lordofthecows.com, free) adds
an Import Bookmarks option on a Debug Menu that
the utility can add to Safari.
In Technique 31, we discuss several applica-
tions that modify Safari’s behavior. Along with
Safari Enhancer, you find out about Safari
Sorter, Safari Menu, and SafariBookmark
Checker.
Transferring your bookmarks 
to a new Mac
Different applications can access the bookmarks managed
by other applications because bookmarks are stored as text
files on your computer. Specifically:

Safari uses an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) file
stored in ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist.

Camino uses an XML file stored within your
Application Support folder.

Mozilla uses a HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
file stored with the ~/Library/Mozilla directory.

Internet Explorer uses an HTML file stored within the
~/Library/Preferences/Explorer directory.
This system has two benefits for you, the end user. First,
you can easily transfer all your bookmarks from one com-
puter to another just by copying over the appropriate file.
Second, you can manually tweak your bookmarks by edit-
ing these files in any text editor.

Technique 32: Managing Bookmarks Better
250
After you do this

Open that file to open the Web site in your Web
browser.

Add the file to your Startup Items to automati-
cally load the URL when you log into your com-
puter. (See Technique 2 for more on Startup
Items.)

Add the file to your Favorites (see Technique 17)
or a docked folder (see Technique 13) to keep it
out of the way, yet easily accessible.
One of our favorite shareware applications,
LaunchBar (www.obdev.at/products/launchbar; free
for limited use, $20 for personal use), can be used to
open many things, including your favorite Web
pages. As we demonstrate in detail in Technique 23,
LaunchBar lets you perform tasks by typing a key
combination. For starters, you can use LaunchBar to
open or switch to applications, but LaunchBar also
reads through and indexes all your bookmarks, mak-
ing them only a couple keys away. To try this, follow
the example in Technique 23 but use a logical key-
board combination for one of your bookmarks (like
CT for Chicago Tribune).
Bookmark Tips and Tricks
In this section, we mention a couple other cool book-
mark tips.
You can make a bookmark as a file on your computer
by dragging the URL from your browser’s address
bar onto the Desktop (or anywhere else). This cre-
ates a special webloc file type, which is like an alias
to that Web site (see an example in Figure 32-10).
• Figure 32-10: URLs saved on your computer have a

Speedy Searches
with Google
T
he World Wide Web wouldn’t be half as useful without the search
engines that make its content findable. Throughout the history of
the Internet, several search engines have been popular, but the 
current reigning champ is Google.
Most search engines help you find what you need, but there’s a lot to be
said for Google in particular. Knowing how to use it and all its options
goes a long way toward improving the speed and accuracy with which
you find stuff. We start this technique by going through some more
advanced Google navigation tips. Then you discover how nicely Safari
and Google work together. Lastly, this technique mentions a handful of
different tips that, although not universally useful, are quite handy to
know.
Doing Basic Google Searches
Google is one of those wonderful tools that people can use on a basic or
advanced level. In other words, any Joe Bag-o’-Doughnuts can use it for
everyday purposes, whereas rocket scientists can really tweak the heck
out of it. Basic searches involve typing a few words (or just one) in the
Search box and then clicking the Google Search button. Beyond this, here
are some rules to follow that you might (or might not) be aware of:

The more keywords you use, the more specific the search is. Too-
general searches tend to return an unwieldy number of results.
Google, by default, returns only results that include all the search
words.

Be as precise with your keywords as possible. It’s far, far more likely
that Google will return too many results than too few, so you should be
as specific as you can when you have a good sense of what you’re
looking for.

word, it skips common terms and numbers. By
using the plus sign before a word (without a pre-
ceding space), you can insist upon its use.
• Figure 33-1: The plus sign makes otherwise omitted
words required.

Use a minus sign (-) to rule out a keyword. For
example, if you want to search for apples — the
fruit, and not the computers — you could use
apple -computer -mac as your search terms.
Remember: Do not include a space between the
search term(s) and the minus sign(s).

Place phrases within quotation marks (see
Figure 33-2). Using phrases is a much more exact
way to execute a search. For example, searching
for Larry Ullman turns up about 118,000 search
results, whereas searching for “Larry Ullman”
returns only 31,000.
• Figure 33-2: Quotation marks change search words to
phrases.
As you might have noticed, Google suggests
alternate search terms if you’ve possibly mis-
spelled a word or words. Click the suggested
alternative link to see the search results for the
corrected keyword(s).

Order your keywords by importance. The order
of your keywords affects the results of the
search. Enter the most important terms first.
If a particular result is very close to what you
were looking for, click the Similar Pages text at
the end of that record to perform a search on
Google for similar sites.

Skip common words. Google automatically
ignores very common words, such as conjunc-
tions (and), articles (a, an, the), being verbs
(are, is), and interrogatives (who, what, why), so
you might as well save Google the trouble and
not use them in the first place.
Google is a case-insensitive search by default.
This means that word, WORD, Word, and
WoRd are all treated the same. Save yourself
some effort by not wasting time fixating on
the proper capitalization of your search terms.
Doing Advanced Google
Searches
After you master the basics, here are some fancier
tools that you can use:

Use the OR keyword to make a less restrictive
search. Google normally requires that every
search term be in a search result, but you can
overrule this behavior by typing OR between
each word. Note: The OR keyword should be in
uppercase letters, and be sure to add a space
after it.

Use a plus sign (+) before a word to indicate
that the word is required (see Figure 33-1).
Although Google always searches for every

Doing Specialized Google Searches
253
If you’re bored one day, search for yourself on
Google. This is called Ego Surfing. Or, if you
want a real challenge, try Googlewhacking —
finding two words which, when searched in
Google, return only one record.

To further limit your searches without relying
upon keywords, check out Google’s directory
feature. The Google directory, which is accessi-
ble at www.google.com/dirhp, breaks the Web
down into a series of categories. To limit search
results, search within a category.

Use the site: restrictions to search a particular
site. The site: keyword restricts a search to a spe-
cific Web address or domain type. For example:
 You can use Google to search Apple’s Web site
by including site:www.apple.com.
 You can limit your searches to schools with
site:edu.
 Search only a particular country realm with
site:ch (ch stands for Switzerland).
To find the domain name abbreviation for a
country (or find what country an abbreviation
represents), head to www.iana.org/cctld/
cctld-whois.htm. There you can find out
that .tv is Tuvalu and the Vatican is .va.
 Check out United States government pages
with site:gov.
Finally, Google provides an advanced search page
that can be accessed by clicking the Advanced
Search link. This page has numerous other options,
the two best of which are

In the Date drop-down list, you can restrict the
returned records to a certain date range.

In the Occurrences drop-down list, you can
specify where in a page the search should run:
 Selecting In The Title dictates that the key-
words must be found in the page’s title.
 Selecting In The Text dictates that the key-
words must be found within the page’s text
(ignoring links and titles).
Doing Specialized Google
Searches
Google’s default search takes place within the Web,
meaning that it looks through Web pages. You can
also have Google search for or through the following:

Images: http://images.google.com

Newsgroup postings: http://groups.google.
com

Mail-order catalogs: http://catalogs.google.

Specific technical topics (like BSD, Apple, and
Microsoft): www.google.com/options/special
searches.html

University Web pages: www.google.com/
options/universities.html
Google also has the ability to search for specific file
types. You can request a specific type of file by
adding the filetype:type designation to your search
parameters, where type is the file extension. You can
omit a specific type with -filetype:type.
The types of files that Google can search for are

Google Tips and Tricks
Google is much more than just a search engine. The
fine folks at Google have been continually adding
new widgets and features over the years, expanding
its capabilities. Here are some of our favorites.
Google, the dictionary
You can use Google to look up a word for you.
1.
Open Google in your Web browser.
2.
Type define word or define phrase, replacing
word or phrase with the actual word or phrase
that you want defined.
3.
Click the Google Search button.
If you’re using Safari, you can just type define
word or define phrase in the Google Search
box and then press Return.
4.
You find the definition listed first in the search
results, by the heading Web Definition (see
Figure 33-5).
• Figure 33-5: Google’s definition trick retrieves the
meanings of words for you.
If you use define: word (note the colon),
Google instead takes you to a page of defini-
tions, without any other search results.
5.
If desired, click the More Definitions link to
see, surprisingly enough, more definitions.
Alternatively, if you do an ordinary search for
a single word and Google can find a definition
for it, this word is underlined in the blue bar at
the top of the Google window (check out
Figure 33-6). Click that word to view its 
definition.
• Figure 33-6: Google automatically finds definitions for
your search terms, if it can.
Google, the mathematician
Did you know that Google can do your math home-
work for you? Okay, maybe not, but it can perform
basic calculations. See Table 33-1 for the operators
and terms you’ll usually use. (Most of them are com-
mon sense.)

bers with or without the commas (indicating
thousands) and returned results use spaces
instead of commas.

Technique
Mastering Mail
A
long with surfing the Internet, the ability to send and receive
e-mail might be the most common reason people use computers
today. Sadly, until the Mac operating system turned over the 
OS X leaf, there was no such thing as an Apple-made e-mail application.
Today’s Tiger user can rest assured that Apple’s solution — Mail — isn’t
only available and free, but it’s pretty darn good, too.
This technique distills the abundance of information on Mail into the
most critical bundle for timesaving techniques. You don’t get much in the
way of introductions or basics here except as they apply to using this
application more efficiently. This technique begins with some keyboard
shortcuts and then goes into setting some preferences. We follow this
with tips on organizing your mailboxes and performing searches within
them. Finally, we tack on some information about signatures (the kind
you put at the bottom of an e-mail message, not your John Hancock), and
a few other useful Mail-related tidbits that didn’t fit in elsewhere.
Mail has received a pretty thorough overhaul in Tiger, adding new
features and a new appearance. One of the most important new fea-
tures is Smart Mailboxes, which follows in the footsteps of Smart
Albums in iTunes and Smart Folders in the Finder. You might also
appreciate the improved account information (such as how much
server disk space an account requires) and the Connection Doctor
(which helps you figure out why Mail isn’t getting new messages).
Using Keyboard Shortcuts
E-mail is overwhelmingly a keyboard-based technology. (You can proba-
bly compose an entire e-mail by using just your mouse and the Character
Palette, but don’t plan on doing anything else that day.) If you memorize
the right keyboard shortcuts and figure out how to navigate around the
application, you can get away with barely using your mouse, if at all. Mail
has a lot of keyboard shortcuts. Most are convoluted, so this technique
sticks to the most useful.

Using Keyboard Shortcuts
259
If you can’t recall a keyboard shortcut, just
peruse through the menus to remind yourself.
Navigation shortcuts
Certain keyboard commands are critical for getting
around within Mail, saving you from having to jump
over to your mouse. These are

Tab: Use the Tab key to move from the message
window (where your e-mails are listed) to the
Preview panel (where an e-mail is displayed) to
the Search box.

↑: Use the up arrow to view the previous mes-
sage (while in the messages window).

↓: Use the down arrow to view the next message
(while in the messages window).

Page Up: Use Page Up to go up within a message
(while in a message).

Page Down: Use Page Down to scroll down
within a message (while in a message).

Ô-N: Ô-N moves you to specific mailboxes,
where N is one of the following numbers:
 1: Inbox
 2: Outbox (which you might or might not have
listed in Mail)
 3: Drafts
 4: Sent
 5: Trash
 6: Junk
Other shortcuts
Besides the navigation shortcuts just listed, you’ll
want to memorize just a few other, general-purpose
ones:

Ô-N: Creates a new e-mail message.

Delete key: Sends the selected message to the
Trash.

Ô-R: Creates a reply to the selected message.

Ô-Shift-R: Creates a reply to all the recipients of
a message.

Ô-Shift-F: Forwards a message.

Ô-Shift-V: Pastes Clipboard text as a quotation
(see Figure 34-1).
• Figure 34-1: Mail can paste text as a quotation, which is
marked with a vertical bar.

Ô-Y: Adds the sender of the selected message to
your Address Book.

Ô-Shift-D: Sends an e-mail.

Ô-Shift-A: Attaches a file to the e-mail.

Ô-Shift-N: Retrieves new e-mail.

Ô-Shift-M: Shows and hides the Mail drawer.

Ô-K: Empties the Trash.

Ô-Option-N: Creates a new viewer window.

Technique 34: Mastering Mail
260

Strange as it might seem, you can use the Mail
application to set your default e-mail client to be
something other than Mail. You probably don’t
want to do this, though.

Use the Check for New Mail drop-down list to
control how often Mail checks for new messages.
If you have a persistent (always-on) Internet
connection, have Mail automatically fetch your
new messages, saving you the step. If you use
a dialup connection, disable this and do it
manually when you’re online.

If you have a .Mac account, you can now syn-
chronize your Accounts, Rules, Signatures, and
Smart Mailboxes across multiple Macs.
Setting Composing preferences
You use the Composing panel (see Figure 34-3) to set
your preferences for how Mail behaves when you
write e-mail. Because you’ll write messages fre-
quently, it’s a good idea to pay attention to these
options.
• Figure 34-3: Mail’s Composing preferences affect how
you write and reply to e-mail.
All the standard Mac shortcuts work within
Mail as well: Ô-S (Save), Ô-W (Close), Ô-P
(Print), and so forth. See Technique 10 for
more.
Customizing Mail’s Appearance
and Behavior
We trust that you can make your way through Mail’s
preferences panel without any handholding. But
because you might not yet appreciate the ramifica-
tions of some of the options, we give you a heads-up
on a few of them.
The Junk Mail and Rules sections of the pref-
erences panel are important to merit their own
discussions. We focus on them — and their
usage — in Technique 35.
Setting General preferences
The General panel (as shown in Figure 34-2) is 
fairly simple, but a couple facts are worth 
mentioning:
• Figure 34-2: Mail’s General preferences panel.

Customizing Mail’s Appearance and Behavior
261
On this panel, you can make Mail do the following:

Check spelling as you type: This doesn’t really
save you time, but it makes you look more pro-
fessional, and that’s got to be worth something.
If Mail catches a spelling error, the error is
underlined in red. Control-click the underlined
word to bring up a contextual menu of options
for fixing the boo-boo (see Figure 34-4).
• Figure 34-4: Don’t forget about contextual menus in Mail!
They’re very useful.

Automatically complete addresses: As you type,
Mail looks up addresses for you by using your
Address Book and/or a Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP) server, if you have one.
With this method, you need to type only a few
letters and then select the appropriate address.

Include selected text (if any) when replying:
Assuming that you selected the Quote the Text of
the Original Message check box, you can set up
Mail to quote original text in your reply in one of
two ways:
 Simply replying quotes the entire message in
your reply.
 Selecting a section of text and replying to the
message quotes just that section in your
reply.
Customizing the Mail toolbar
Just like the Finder window toolbars, you can (and
should) customize Mail’s toolbar so that it sports
the features you use most often. To bring up the cus-
tomization window (see Figure 34-5), you can either
• Figure 34-5: Mail’s Customize Toolbar window provides
oodles of options.

Choose View➪Customize Toolbar.

Control-click the toolbar and choose Customize
Toolbar from the contextual menu that appears
(see Figure 34-6).

Technique 34: Mastering Mail
262

Ô-click the oval-shaped white button in the
upper-right corner to rotate among various ver-
sions and sizes of the toolbar (icons only, text
only, plus different sizes of each).
Customizing the messages window
Another area of the Mail application that you ought
to customize is the message window itself, which is
the area where your messages are listed. From the
View menu (as shown in Figure 34-7), you can dictate
what columns are listed and also adjust the sorting
column.
• Figure 34-7: The View menu lets you customize the
message window layout.
Like with standard Finder windows, you can also
adjust how the columns are sorted by clicking the
column headers. Furthermore, you can rearrange the
columns by clicking and dragging them.
Be certain to use the Organize by Thread option
(available on the View menu or by clicking the
Threads button on the toolbar), particularly if you
use message groups and news lists. If you have 
this turned on, Mail automatically sorts incoming
messages by thread (think of a thread as a more 
• Figure 34-6: Quickly access the Customize Toolbar
window from a contextual menu.
Use the Mail toolbar for a while to see what
tools you never use and which ones you use
frequently, and then adjust the toolbar accord-
ingly. Of course, you can tweak the toolbar’s
settings at any time.
The default set gives you an idea of what you want
to accomplish. Basically, by dragging and dropping
icons onto the toolbar, you can

Add items that you use but might not remember
the keyboard shortcut for.

Organize items into similarly themed groups.

Use separators and spaces to divide groups.

Place a Search box on the right.
Using both icons and text in the toolbar pro-
vides you with two visual clues as to what a
button is. The small size setting lets you put
more items in the toolbar.
While we’re discussing the toolbar, we should let
you know of these universal toolbar shortcuts:

Click the oval-shaped white button in the upper-
right corner of the Mail application to show and
hide the toolbar.

formal subject declaration), using the e-mail head-
ers. Even the heated political discussions you have
with your uncle are kept organized because repeated
messages on the same topic are grouped together.
Maintain a neater Inbox by using the
Organize by Thread option (on the View
menu). Multiple e-mails on the same topic are
listed as one item. Clicking the item shows all
the e-mails that are part of that thread.
Clicking the arrow next to the thread subject
expands and contracts that listing, like the list
view in a Finder window.
Customizing the New Message window
Another area for customization is the New Message
window. You can customize the toolbar and cus-
tomize the default layout of a new message. Just do
this:
1.
Press Ô-N to create a new message.
2.
Control-click the message’s toolbar to bring up
the contextual menu.
3.
Choose the Customize Toolbar option.
This brings up the Customize Toolbar sheet.
4.
Customize the toolbar as you want it for indi-
vidual messages.
Things to consider putting there are
 The Send button
 The Attach button, for attaching files
 The Address button, to bring up your
addresses
5.
Click Done when you’re, well, done.
6.
Click the Actions menu, which appears to the
left of the Account menu.
7.
Choose Customize from the menu that appears
(see Figure 34-8).
The top section of the New Message window
expands to show all the possible options: To, Cc,
Bcc, and so on.
• Figure 34-8: The New Message Actions menu offers
other options.
8.
Select the check boxes next to the text boxes
that you want to appear as defaults (see 
Figure 34-9).
Even if you don’t set a text box, such as
Carbon Copy (Cc), to appear as a default in
your message window, that doesn’t mean it
isn’t an option. You can make text boxes visi-
ble to individual messages by using the View
(refer to Figure 34-7) or Action (refer to 
Figure 34-8) menus.
9.
Click OK when you finish.
If you view an e-mail you’ve received in its
own window, this is a fourth (yes, fourth!) win-
dow you can customize.

Technique 34: Mastering Mail
264
• Figure 34-9: Customize what fields a new message has to
suit your needs.
Understanding and using mail headers
An e-mail actually begins with a hidden series of lines called
mail headers, which are used for many purposes, including

Identifying the sender

Identifying the recipient

Indicating the subject line

Marking the time and date when the e-mail was sent

Flagging the message as it’s handled by mail servers
Tiger’s Mail and any other e-mail client turn most of these
headers into a more user-friendly display, like the headers
that you see in the messages window or in the Preview
panel for a single message. However, you can still get a
more techie viewpoint of a message, if you’d like.
To show all the headers for a message, use the Ô-Shift-H
shortcut or choose View Message Long Headers. For
example, the following image shows how a Junk e-mail
might appear in Mail.
By viewing the Long Headers version of the message, you
get something like what appears in the following figure.
Similarly, you can have Mail display a message as the raw
source, invoked by choosing the View➪Message➪Raw
Source or with the Ô-Option-U keyboard shortcut.
The raw source view helps you look at messages written in
HTML that aren’t displaying properly. You can also weed
out spam by checking out either the raw source or the long
headers. For example, if a message has an @aol.com
return address, but was never sent through an AOL mail
server, that means that the address was faked.

Organizing Your Mailboxes
265
Organizing Your Mailboxes
Organizing your mailboxes is as important to effi-
ciently handling your e-mail as organizing your
Home directory is to handling your stuff. If you want
to be able to find anything again, you better put it 
in the right place. By default, Mail has several 
mailboxes:

In: Stores incoming messages waiting to be read.

Drafts: Stores messages that you’re composing. 
If you save a message before sending it, a copy is
placed in the Drafts box. This message remains
there until it is sent.

Trash: Holds messages that you delete. Use Ô-K
to empty the Trash, or you can set the Mail appli-
cation to do this automatically.
To set how the Mail application handles the
Trash, open the preferences panel and then
click the Accounts pane. Select an account
from the left column and then click Mailbox
Behaviors in the right column. At the bottom
of the resulting page, you can dictate how
Mail handles deleted messages for that one
account.

Junk: Holds e-mail marked as junk. (See
Technique 35 for more on how to use Mail to
snuff out spam.)

.Mac Account: Shows only if you have a .Mac
account. You really don’t need to concern your-
self with this one too much.
Most of these boxes are subdivided for your multiple
accounts (see Figure 34-10). If you want to view all
the messages for all the accounts at once, click the
main Inbox icon. If you want to view only the new or
sent or trashed messages for a particular account,
click the appropriate subfolder.
• Figure 34-10: Click the arrow to access a box’s subfolders.
Before you get too heavily invested into Mail, add
new folders to the On My Mac box so that you can
store and organize the messages you keep. Later in
this technique, you see how to create the very
handy Smart Mailboxes.
Creating and maintaining a good organization
scheme with your mailboxes makes finding
messages — particularly using searches —
much, much faster.
All your mailboxes appear in the Mail drawer, which
is a panel that resides on either the left or right side
of the main viewer window. But the Mail drawer is
more than just a collection of mailboxes. Here are
some tips for working with the Mail drawer:

Click the Actions icon at the bottom of the win-
dow (it looks like a cog) to access common tools
(see Figure 34-11).

From the Actions menu that appears, choose the
Use Small Mailbox Icons option so that the mail-
box takes up less room.

Use Ô-Shift-M to show and hide the Mail drawer.

Technique 34: Mastering Mail
266
As soon as you enter text into the Search box,
Mail begins searching. This slows down the
process. Set all your search parameters first
and then enter your search terms.
2.
Use the Mail drawer to select a specific mailbox
or subfolder to search.
If you’re looking for an e-mail that you sent,
begin with the Sent mailbox. If the message was
sent from a particular address, select that sub-
folder instead. If you expect that you would have
stored the e-mail in the Jobagadonuts folder
under Clients, select that. When you do this, all
the messages in that box or folder appear in the
messages window. You can also Ô-click to select
multiple mailboxes.
3.
Enter your search term or terms in the 
Search box.
As you type, the search results appear in the
main window.
4.
Limit your search by using the labels at the top
of the search results window (see Figure 34-12).
• Figure 34-12: You can change the search criteria by using
the different labels.
After you begin your search, you can further
expand or narrow its focus. For example, you can
change the searched mailboxes. You can also
change to what fields your search term is
applied:
• Figure 34-11: The Actions menu lets you create new
mailboxes, delete e-mail, and more.

You can manually back up any single mailbox or
folder by dragging its icon from the Mail drawer
into the Finder. This creates an mbox file, which is
a standard format that you can import back into
most e-mail applications.
Performing Searches
Inevitably, you’re going to need to hunt down that
message your boss sent you two weeks ago (in
which he changed the project) or the one from your
mother (in which she reminded you of her birthday).
Fortunately, Mail has a sweet search engine built
into the application. Here’s the easiest way to use it:
1.
Don’t begin by typing anything in the 
Search box!

Creating and Using Signatures
267
 The entire message
 The From address
 The To address
 The Subject name
If your original search provides too many results,
click the different labels at the top of the results
window to alter the focus.
5.
Use the search results in the message window
to find the right message.
6.
If you still didn’t find the right message, change
the scope of the search or the search terms and
try again.
7.
If it’s a search you’re likely to perform again,
click Save to create a Smart Mailbox with these
search terms.
We also cover Smart Mailboxes at the end of this
technique.
You can create pseudo-searches by using
Rules. See Technique 35 for some examples of
using Rules.
Creating and Using Signatures
Signatures, in e-mail terms, are footers that appear at
the bottom of people’s e-mail addresses (as shown
in Figure 34-13). People use signatures to add con-
tact information, Web links, or disclaimers (in com-
pany e-mails). Here’s how you can create and use
signatures in Mail:
1.
Open the Mail preferences panel.
2.
Click the Signatures icon (see Figure 34-14).
3.
Select an account in the left column.
In the Tiger version of Mail, you can create signa-
tures for a specific account or for any account. If
you want to create a signature not associated
with a specific account, click the All Signatures
item in the left column.
• Figure 34-13: Marc’s signature is both informative and
amusing.
• Figure 34-14: Mail’s Signatures preferences panel.
4.
Click the plus sign under the middle column.
A new signature is created in the middle column,
with a name like Signature #1.
5.
Give the signature a name.
After you click the plus sign in Step 4, the default
signature name that appears is already high-
lighted, so typing replaces it.
6.
In the rightmost column, type all the text 
that you want to use as your signature (see
Figure 34-15).

268
• Figure 34-16: Mail automatically adds signatures to new

Discovering the Best Mail Tips
and Tricks
The following sections include some of the best Mail-
related tips and tricks.
Mail is one of the applications that Automator
supports out of the box. Technique 61 shows
how you can create repeatable processes
involving the Mail application.
Using the Dock icon
The Mail’s Dock icon is your friend. Not only does it
indicate how many new messages you have, but you
can also use it to perform (or at least start) common
tasks. After you Control-click the Mail icon to bring
up its contextual menu (see Figure 34-17), you can
do the following things:
• Figure 34-15: Add a new signature here.
You can add as much text as you want. Separate
multiple lines by pressing Return. The signature
should be informative and communicative — not
showy and bulky — so follow these general rules:
 Begin your signature with two dashes and a
space (- - ) on the first line, which helps mail
readers understand that your signature is
beginning. However, people use this practice
less and less.
 Use plain text.
 Restrict yourself to four to seven lines.
 Avoid long lines (more than 80 characters).
 Resist the urge to create elaborate graphics
using spaces and keys.
7.
Close the preferences panel when you
finish.
In the Signatures panel, you can automatically
associate signature behavior to specific
accounts. Just click the account in the leftmost
column, and then use the Choose Signature
drop-down list (see Figure 34-16) to determine
a signature policy for that account. If a created
signature isn’t listed, click the All Signatures
item and then drag the signature from the
middle column onto the account name in the
left column.


Retrieve new messages.

Create a new e-mail. (You’re taken to the Mail
application, where a new message window is
opened for you.)

Choose what document to view (for example, the
Viewer window or an open e-mail).
The number of new messages in your Inbox
also appears as part of the Mail icon in the
application switcher palette.
Sending attachments
You have a choice of many ways to add attachments
to an e-mail:

Press Ô-Option-A to bring up the Open dialog
(while composing an e-mail).

Choose File➪Attach File.

Click the Attach button on the message toolbar.
If your message doesn’t have an Attach but-
ton, customize the message toolbar (see
“Customizing Mail’s Appearance and
Behavior,” earlier in this technique).

Drag and drop a file from the Finder or other
application onto the message.

Drag and drop a file from the Finder onto the
Mail’s Dock icon, which creates a new message
window with the file already attached to it.
For a cool technique on dragging and drop-
ping by using Exposé, check out Technique 15.
When sending attachments, you ought to seriously
consider compressing anything that you send.
Compression both cuts down on the size of the file
and makes it easier for the receiver to distinguish
between the message and the attachment. (Some
attachments are displayed inline in the message
itself rather than as an icon that the recipient has to
click to open.) The easiest way to compress any file
or folder is to select it in the Finder and choose
File➪Create Archive. 
Creating Smart Mailboxes
New in Tiger and Mail 2.0 is the ability to create
Smart Mailboxes. These are simple dynamic mail-
boxes that you define with a set of rules. The con-
tents of that mailbox vary, always representing the
messages that match your set of rules. The previous
search section shows how you can quickly turn a
search into a Smart Mailbox. Here’s another way to
create a simple Smart Mailbox:
1.
Choose Mailbox➪New Smart Mailbox.
You can also use the Action menu in the Mailbox
drawer.
2.
Give the Smart Mailbox an appropriate name
(see Figure 34-18).
In this example, we created a Smart Mailbox that
stores all the e-mails coming from family mem-
bers. So the mailbox name is Family Emails.
• Figure 34-18: The Smart Mailbox prompt.
3.
Edit the first condition.

Technique 34: Mastering Mail

5.
When you finish, click OK.
The new Smart Mailbox is created and added at
the bottom of the other Smart Mailboxes.
If you want, reorder your Smart Mailboxes by click-
ing and dragging their folders.
Double-click any Smart Mailbox folder icon to
see and edit its governing rules.
Using the first drop-down list (refer to Figure
34-18), select Sender Is Member of Group. Then
select Family from the second drop-down list.
This example assumes that you’ve already cre-
ated a Family group in the Address Book. If 
you haven’t, head on over to Technique 18 to 
see how.
4.
If you want, add more criteria by clicking the
plus sign and using the menus and prompts.
For example, if you want this Smart Mailbox to
store only unread messages from family mem-
bers, add that as a criterion.

Stopping Spam 
in Its Tracks
S
pam is nothing short of a pox on the world of the Internet and
e-mail. Unwanted and unsolicited e-mail is slowing down networks,
costing businesses billions of dollars, and cluttering up mailboxes.
Okay, maybe it is or isn’t all of that, but it is a pain and a fact of e-mail
life. Despite the overwhelming existence of this plague, you can take
steps to fight this time-waster. In this technique, we put forth two
approaches to spam: 

Handling it after you receive it in your mail application

Avoiding it in the first place
The first two sections of this technique focus on the Apple Mail program
specifically. The concluding section discusses software, techniques, and
steps that you can follow to take a bite out of the amount of spam that
you receive. These ideas are useful regardless of what application you
use for e-mail.
Fighting Spam with the Junk Mail Button
One of Mail’s strongest suits is its ability to identify and filter out spam.
We can’t think of a single reason why you wouldn’t want to use this fea-
ture. It’s a breeze to get going and, over time, teaches itself to be more
accurate at guessing which messages are spam.
1.
Open the Mail preferences panel.
You can do this by either choosing Mail➪Preferences or by pressing
Ô-, (comma).
2.
Click the Junk Mail icon (see Figure 35-1).

• Figure 35-2: The Junk mailbox is expressly for
temporarily storing spam.
4.
Select these check boxes:
 Sender of Message Is in My Address Book
This exempts these senders’ messages from
filtering. Presumably people in your Address
Book don’t send you spam, so these messages
shouldn’t be filtered. People — like those in
your Address Book — who are assumed to
send valid e-mail are on a white list (the oppo-
site of a black list).
People in your Address Book might end up
unintentionally sending you viruses (particu-
larly if your friends run Windows). Viruses can
be handled by using the Rules feature, which
we discuss in the upcoming section, “Creating
and Using Rules.”
• Figure 35-1: Use the Junk Mail panel to adjust spam
settings.

Make sure that these options are selected:
 Enable Junk Mail Filtering
This check box should be enabled in new
installations of Tiger. Keep it that way.
Junk Mail filtering is enabled by default in
Tiger. That’s a good thing, and you shouldn’t
mess with it.
 Leave It in My Inbox
Use the training mode for about a month
(depending upon how much e-mail and junk
you receive).

Mail filter move spam to the Junk mailbox
(found below the Trash, as shown in Figure
35-2), you won’t have to look at those e-mails,
but you can review the messages later.

Creating and Using Rules
273
 Sender of Message Is in My Previous
Recipients
This makes those recipients’ messages
exempt from filtering. Spam is often sent from
different permutations of an e-mail address;
therefore, you aren’t likely to get spam from
the same address twice. Enabling this option
helps to avoid false positives (mail that has
been incorrectly identified as spam).
 Trust Junk Mail Headers Set by Your Internet
Service Provider
Many ISPs use their own software to filter
spam. Some providers automatically block
those from ever reaching you. Others send
the messages anyway but mark them as spam.
In those cases, you want Mail to trust the pre-
liminary spam designation. In the worst case,
you just need to fish non-spam messages out
of the Junk mailbox later.
5.
Close the Junk Mail preferences panel.
• Figure 35-3: Use the Junk icon to manually mark a
message as spam.
If spam still slips through the cracks, select the
message and click the Junk icon (see Figure
35-3) on the toolbar to let Mail know that the
message is spam.
If you don’t have a Junk button in your tool-
bar, customize the toolbar by using the steps
in Technique 34.
Go to the section “Bouncing spam” to see what to do
with all your spam now stored in the Junk mailbox.
What, exactly, is spam?
Spam is unsolicited junk e-mail sent to many people at
once. These messages usually are about

Get-rich-quick schemes

Physical enhancement products

Sexually explicit content

Trendy products or ideas
Businesses might send out spam-like messages as well, but
these don’t qualify as spam if they fit both of these criteria:

Users can opt out of receiving the messages.

The messages advertise actual products or services.
Such e-mails also tend to come from a company with which
you’ve had previous interactions.
If an e-mail is spam, you need to fight it by using the meth-
ods in this chapter. If it’s an advertisement from a business
that you know and probably have ordered from before,
simply following the opt-out instructions should stop the
messages from coming.
Creating and Using Rules
The Junk Mail filter does an admirable job identify-
ing spam, but it isn’t perfect. Fortunately, it isn’t the
only tool that you have in your arsenal. Mail also
includes the Rules feature. To use it, you establish
certain criteria (for example, if the subject contains
certain words) and then decide what Mail should do
when messages meet criteria (such as move the
e-mail to a specific folder or highlight it in a particu-
lar color). Using Rules is like having a really great
personal assistant go through your inbox before you
start looking at the messages. Here are just a few
uses of Rules:

Technique 35: Stopping Spam in Its Tracks
274
4.
In the dialog that appears, type the Rule’s name
in the Description text box.
Give your Rule a descriptive name, indicating
what it does or what it applies to (an e-mail
address, a particular virus, a certain subject).
5.
Create the Rule’s criteria.
For each criterion, perform these steps.
 Select Any from the first drop-down list.
 Select Subject from the second first drop-down
list.
 Select Contains from the third drop-down list. 
 Type the text in the text box, as shown in
Figure 35-5.
Rules are case-insensitive by default.
You can set as many criteria as you need. Just
click the plus sign to add another criterion. The
SoBig virus sent out e-mails titled That Movie,
Your Application, Thank You, and so forth. For
this Rule, Larry set up multiple criteria so that if
the subject of an e-mail contains any of these
phrases, it’s picked up by his Rule.
• Figure 35-5: Add as many criteria as you want to a Rule.
6.
Under Perform the Following Actions, select
Move Message from the first drop-down list and
Trash from the second to move the message to
the Trash (see Figure 35-6).

Rules aren’t specifically tied to handling or fil-
tering spam. You can, and most likely will, use
Rules to manage legitimate e-mail. We cover
Rules here because the feature is very similar
to the Junk Mail filter (which is actually a com-
plex type of Rule).
Another use is to create a Rule to handle particular
types of spam. For example, when the latest
Windows virus hits, Larry might get a couple hun-
dred e-mails (because his address is on computers
around the world). When he sees a wave of mes-
sages entitled Wicked Screensaver or Your
Application, within a matter of minutes, he sets Mail
to start trashing these. Here’s how:
1.
Bring up the Mail preferences panel.
2.
Click the Rules icon (see Figure 35-4).

Stopping Spam before 
It Gets to You
The bulk of this technique revolves around dealing
with spam after it hits your mailbox (acknowledging
that “spam happens”). But a more critical — and dif-
ficult — task is cutting down on the amount of spam
that you receive. The quickest way to stop spam is
to not have an e-mail address, but that’s a drastic
step that most people aren’t willing to take these
days. Here is some more practical advice:

Don’t use an AOL, Yahoo!, MSN, or Hotmail
e-mail account. The big providers of e-mail serv-
ice (commercial or free) are major targets for
spammers. These users are frequently hit not
because their address got put on a list but sim-
ply because spammers use every combination of
names and popular domains — for example,
@aol.com — that their spam software can come
up with.

Watch what you sign up for online. Most regis-
tration forms require your e-mail address and
then assume you want to receive e-mail from that
business. Although this isn’t spam (technically),
it’s often e-mail that you don’t want. Look for opt-
out boxes during registrations.

Never respond to the spam that you receive.
This just lets spammers know that they’ve hit an
active e-mail address.
Absolutely, positively don’t follow the Click
Here to Unsubscribe or Reply to Unsubscribe
suggestions included in spam. These steps
only confirm for the spammers that they had a
valid e-mail address. The likely result? You get
even more spam!

Try to keep your e-mail address off the
Internet. Many spammed addresses come from
spiders that scour the Internet looking for some-
one@address.com text. These are normally found
on contact pages of Web sites or on public mes-
sage boards. If you do use a resource that 
publishes users’ e-mail addresses (which is com-
mon), set up a separate e-mail address for this
purpose.

Use separate e-mail addresses. A smart move is
to have one e-mail address for your friends and
family, which is used (hmmm) only for your
friends and family. Create a second e-mail
address for work or school. Then, create a sepa-
rate e-mail address that you use only for riskier
behavior (like posting messages online). When
this address becomes overrun with spam, delete
it and create a new one.
One of Mail’s best features is its ability to eas-
ily manage multiple e-mail accounts. Using
temporary e-mail accounts in the war against
spam is far less of an inconvenience than you
might expect.

Render Web bugs useless. Some spammers use
a trick called a Web bug to validate your e-mail
address. When you open a piece of spam with
this special hidden graphic in it, it relays a mes-
sage back to the spammer letting him know that
the e-mail address is valid. By turning off the
loading of graphics (under the Viewing prefer-
ences panel, shown in Figure 35-7), you can cir-
cumvent this trick. For legitimate e-mails, a quick
click on the Load Images button renders them
complete.

Technique 35: Stopping Spam in Its Tracks
276
2.
Press Ô-A to select every message.
3.
Looking at the Subject names and From
addresses, Ô-click any messages that might not
be spam to deselect them.
You or the Junk filter might have erred in mark-
ing a message. In those cases, you don’t want to
bounce the message.
4.
Double-check to make sure that all the high-
lighted messages are spam.
5.
Click the Bounce icon on the toolbar or press
Ô-Shift-B.
6.
Click OK at the prompt (see Figure 35-8).
• Figure 35-8: Mail confirms that you want to bounce these
messages.
After you bounce an e-mail, it’s moved from the
Junk mailbox into the Trash. When you empty
the Trash, those bounced e-mails will also be
deleted.
7.
Review the remaining messages (which you
deselected in Step 3) and click the Not Junk
button (see Figure 35-9) to tell Mail that a mes-
sage wasn’t spam.
• Figure 35-9: If Mail wrongly marks a message as junk,
there’s a Not Junk button to undo that flag.
The Not Junk button is just as important as
the Junk button in teaching Mail how to iden-
tify bad e-mail.
• Figure 35-7: Not loading graphics in your e-mails might
help minimize the amount of spam you
receive.

Pay attention to your ISP’s spam controls. Most
ISPs provide a method for reporting spam. By
participating in this process, you help ISPs stop
spam before it gets to you.

Pay attention to the law. The United States gov-
ernment and many states are working hard to cut
down on spam. The FTC also tracks spam, and
some states are starting to sue spammers. Pay
attention to what laws have been passed and
what recommendations these government agen-
cies have.
Bouncing spam
Recent studies suggest that one effective method
of stopping spam is to indicate that e-mail address
wasn’t valid. You can do this by bouncing the e-mail
back to the sender. When you bounce a message, it
indicates to the sender (or the sender’s computer)
that the e-mail address doesn’t exist. With luck, this
gets you off the offender’s list. Here’s how Larry han-
dles this:
1.
Click the Junk mailbox to view its contents.
Over the course of the day, Larry’s Junk mailbox
gets filled up with the messages that Mail
thought was junk or that he manually marked as
junk.

Stopping Spam before It Gets to You
277
There’s a good chance that some bounced messages
will be returned to you with a Mail Undeliverable (or
similar) message. This just indicates that the original
sender’s e-mail address was bogus. You can either
delete the undelivered messages or make a Rule to
automatically send undelivered mail to the Trash.
Other spam tools
You can use many other applications to combat
spam. Here are six popular choices:

SpamSieve (www.ccommand.com/spamsieve/
index.shtml, $25) is a very solid piece of soft-
ware that adds junk-mail-filtering capability to
other e-mail applications (such as Mail, Eudora,
Mailsmith, and Entourage).

JunkMatcher (http://junkmatcher.source
forge.net, free) uses a handful of tools (such as
regular expressions and existing blacklists) to
very accurately identify spam. In fact, the only
slight against JunkMatcher is that it might be too
effective; it often has false positives until you
more narrowly define its criteria.

Spamfire Pro (www.matterform.com, $40) 
filters all your mail before it gets to your e-mail
application.

SpamCop (www.spamcop.net) provides you with
spam-filtered e-mail for $30 per year and has
tools to set up spam-filtering software for entire
companies.

Mailblocks (www.mailblocks.com, $10) routes
all your existing e-mail addresses through a new
Mailblocks address, filtering out the spam in the
process. It works with most major e-mail applica-
tions, including Mail, and is ridiculously cheap.

SpamSlam (www.ilesa.com, $25) uses two of the
best spam-stopping techniques:
 Filtering spam based upon content (which is
what Mail does)
 Requesting confirmation of e-mails from
senders not in your Address Book (the first
time the person send you an e-mail)

 Picking up some tips and
tricks
Technique
Innovative iChat
i
Chat is Apple’s answer to America Online’s Instant Messenger (AIM)
application. The application works by using your .Mac account or an
AIM account, if you have one. You can use it to communicate with
other iChat users or AIM denizens.
In this technique, we assume that you understand the fundamentals of
using iChat, so we focus instead on some of the little extras that make
using the application more productive. We begin with the keyboard and
mouse shortcuts that you should use, and then we go through some of
the customizing techniques that you might not know about. Finally, we go
through a few specific tips for common tasks.
Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts
iChat doesn’t offer you many shortcuts. The principle is very basic: Type
some text and press Return. But you ought to know about the following
shortcuts:

Option-Return: Creates a carriage return (letting you start a new 
paragraph).
By default, pressing Return sends the typed text within an instant
message (IM) window. Therefore, to insert a return into a message (so
that text goes onto the next line), use Option-Return.

Ô-L: Logs you out.

Ô-N: Creates a new, private chat room.

Ô-K: Creates a hyperlink.

Ô-1: Brings up your Buddy List window (see Figure 36-1).

Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts
279
• Figure 36-1: Larry’s Buddy List (while logged in to his
.Mac account) shows that his buddy Larry
(using an AIM account) is logged in.

Ô-2: Brings up the Bonjour window.
Bonjour is Apple’s technology that instantly
recognizes other computers, hardware and
users on your network. iChat’s Bonjour win-
dow shows other AIM and .Mac users who 
are currently online and on the same network
as you.

Ô-Shift-G: Shows and hides the groups bar.

Ô-Option-E: Sends an e-mail to the selected user.

Ô-Option-F: Opens the prompt for sending a file.

Ô-I: Gets the info of a user selected in the Buddy
List.
The Get Info panel for a particular user serves
two purposes. First, it displays some of that
person’s Address Book information (see Figure
36-2). Second, you can use it to associate spe-
cific actions with this user (see Figure 36-3).
For example, you can configure a user’s Info
setting so that a specific sound is played when
that person comes online or sends you a 
message.
• Figure 36-2: Get Info on a buddy to edit his record in
iChat.

Ô-Shift-I: Gets the information for a user in 
an IM.

Ô-Shift-A: Adds a buddy.

Ô-S: Saves the chat transcript.
With the mouse — iChat is admittedly not a mouse-
driven application — the most important pointers
are these:

Click a person’s name in your Buddy List to
select her.

Double-click a person’s name in the Buddy List
to send him an instant message.

Click the red button in the upper-left corner of
the IM window to close the message.

Technique 36: Innovative iChat
280
• Figure 36-4: iChat’s Menu Bar menu lets you control the
application without making it active.
iChat’s Menu Bar tool (enabled in iChat’s
General preferences) lets you set your status
and see who’s online without opening iChat.
You can instant-message a buddy by selecting
his name from the Menu Bar list, at which
point iChat opens for you. iChat also launches
itself if someone sends you an IM.

Add a new icon to represent you during chat ses-
sions by dragging it onto your icon in the Buddy
List window.

Click your icon in the Buddy List window for a
choice of icons that you’ve used (as shown in
Figure 36-5).
• Figure 36-3: Set iChat to do certain things when particular
users log on or send you messages.
Customizing iChat
Rather than go through all the preferences settings —
which you can do very well on your own — we con-
centrate on some of the most important and interest-
ing customizing options. All these fall under the useful
or cool categories:

Use Bonjour to help iChat automatically recog-
nize people on your local network (see detailed
instructions in Technique 39).

Enable the Show Status in Menu Bar option
(choose iChat➪Preferences➪General) to control
iChat without opening the application. Figure
36-4 shows the Menu Bar menu.

Customizing iChat
281
• Figure 36-5: Choose your icon from the list of icons
you’ve used in the past.

Add a background to your IM by dragging an
image onto it.

Have iChat use sounds to let you know when cer-
tain people come online or send you messages.

Have iChat check your spelling while you type
(hint: to make you look smarter than you are!).

Customize your status to make it more specific
and useful.
Your status is the message others can see that indi-
cates your availability. iChat comes with the default
status options of Available, Away, and Current iTunes
Track, but you shouldn’t have to restrict yourself to
those. Follow these steps to create a custom status:
1.
Click the status text below your name.
2.
In the drop-down list that appears (see Figure
36-6), select Custom from either the Available
or Away sections.
• Figure 36-6: Use the status drop-down list to indicate
your availability.
3.
In the resulting text box, enter your new status
label.
4.
Press Return to make this status active (see
Figure 36-7).
Larry has created a Taking a Nap status for this
example.

282
• Figure 36-7: Larry’s new status takes effect immediately.
Alternatively, you can use the Edit Status
Menu option (refer to Figure 36-6) to create
and manage multiple status options at once
(see Figure 36-8). Select a message and click
the minus sign below it to delete it. Click the
appropriate plus sign to add a message.
Double-click a message to edit it. Press Return
(or click OK) when you’re finished.
• Figure 36-8: The Edit Status menu is a fast way to add or
remove multiple statuses.
Logging iChat sessions
If you want to remember an idea or URL that someone
gave you or you want proof that someone said something,
save your instant message session. To save a session while
you’re in it, either choose File➪Save or press Ô-S. You’re
given a prompt so that you can save the file on your com-
puter. (By default, the filename is Instant Message with
Username.)
Because of the unique format of an iChat session, you can’t
just open it in any old text editor. To view the iChat logs,
you can either 

Open them in iChat. (This happens automatically if
you double-click the saved file.) 

Use Logorrhea (http://spiny.com/logorrhea,
free). This application parses iChat logs and provides
other nice tools for searching through them.
Transferring Files with iChat
Did you know that you can use iChat as a quick and
easy way to transfer files? It’s remarkably simple:
1.
Begin an Instant Message conversation with a
user.
2.
Switch to the Finder.
Press Ô-Tab, click the Finder Dock icon, or click
the Desktop itself to switch from iChat to the
Finder.
3.
Browse for the file that you want to attach.
4.
Drag the file from the Finder onto the IM win-
dow in iChat.
Drag the image into the text box area (where you
type) — not the main window itself.

Using the Videoconference
283
If the file is already open (like a Word document
in Microsoft Word), you can attach the file by
dragging its proxy icon (the icon of the file that
appears in the title bar next to the file’s name)
onto the IM window. You can also use the
Exposé or the Ô-Tab drag-and-drop techniques
that we discuss in Techniques 15 and 10,
respectively. Another option is just to copy the
file in the Finder (select it, press Ô-C), and then
paste that into your IM box.
5.
Add some text (if desired) and press Return to
send the file.
Depending upon the other user’s instant messag-
ing client, you normally have to wait a bit while
iChat requests approval from the receiver. Then
the file appears in the main window of the
Instant Message, along with its name (see Figure
36-9 for the sender’s IM window).
• Figure 36-9: The file appears with its icon in your iChat.
Here are a few other facts that you should know
about sending files in iChat:

You can send files to people running iChat or
AIM.

The File feature, in conjunction with Bonjour,
makes a great way to send files to other people
on your network (for example, co-workers).

If you send images in iChat, they appear in the IM
window, as shown in Figure 36-10. If you resize
the IM window, the image also is resized.
• Figure 36-10: Images can be included inline (in the
message) during an IM.
Using the Videoconference
The latest version of iChat is technically called iChat
AV because of its audio/visual capabilities. With it,
you can videoconference or audioconference with
other iChat users. (It’s like Buck Rodgers come to
life!) Besides being really, really cool, this means that
you can have free, long distance phone calls — while
playing solitaire — or, if you’re writing a book, video-
conference with your coauthor in Switzerland, 
hypothetically.
iChat AV in Tiger is extra special! You can
videoconference with up to three other people
at once. (Previously you were limited to a one-
on-one chat.) You can also audioconference
with up to ten people!

Technique 36: Innovative iChat
284
 A green telephone indicates that he’s ready
for audio.
 A green camera indicates that he’s ready for
video.
• Figure 36-11: Turn on AV features at the bottom of the
Audio menu.
iChat indicates audio and video capability in
the Buddy List via camera and telephone
icons. A grayed-out camera icon indicates the
user is currently videoconferencing with some-
one else.
5.
Begin an audio- or videoconference by clicking
the green symbol next to the person’s name.
The user gets an invitation to join you for a con-
ference, which he can either accept or decline.
While the call is being set up, you see your own
image so that you can adjust the camera framing.
To use iChat AV’s videoconferencing feature, you
need

A FireWire video camera (like Apple’s iSight)

At least a 600 MHz G3 processor 

A high-speed Internet connection
If you don’t meet the requirements and really
want to give videoconferencing a whirl, check
out iChatUSBCam (www.ecamm.com/mac/
ichatusbcam, $10). It makes iChat work with
many USB cameras (which are much cheaper
than FireWire ones) and lowers the processor
requirements.
If you want to use only the audio aspect, the require-
ments are more lax:

A USB or built-in microphone

A 56 Kbps dialup connection or better
You can easily set up an iChat AV audioconference or
videoconference. To use iChat AV, do the following:
1.
Connect a supported camera, if you have one.
Apple created the iSight ($149) specifically for
this task, but any FireWire camera should work.
2.
Open iChat.
3.
Under iChat’s Audio menu, make sure that
Camera Enabled and Microphone Enabled are
marked (see Figure 36-11).
4.
Select someone to conference with from your
Buddy or Bonjour List.
The other iChat user has one of two icons (which
appears next to his iChat icon in the Buddy or
Bonjour List) indicating his capability for audio
or video chatting:

Creating URLs
285
If you have a camera and/or microphone but
your partner does not, you can still start a one-
way video- or audioconference. The person on
the other end of the conference sees and/or
hears you, and both of you can use the regu-
lar text Chat feature. To use this, select the
other person in the Buddy List, and choose
Invite to One-Way Video/Audio Chat, either
from the contextual menu of the Buddy List
entry or from the Buddies menu.
Here are some tricks to keep in mind when using the
AV features:

In the Video preferences panel (see Figure 36-12),
lower the Bandwidth Limit for video to 500 Kbps
to improve the audio quality.
• Figure 36-12: Use the Video panel to test and tweak your
settings.

Press Ô-Option-S to take a snapshot from the
video feed.

You can resize the video image or make it full-
screen, but this slows down the performance of
your computer.
If you connect a video camera to your com-
puter for videoconferencing, you can also use
it to take a snapshot. You can use this snap-
shot as your representative icon in the operat-
ing system and certain applications. See
Technique 18 to find out how to do this in the
Address Book.
Creating URLs
As you probably know, iChat automatically turns any
typed or pasted URL into an active Web link. When it
does so, it displays the URL text as the link name by
default (see Figure 36-13). But you can create links
with specific names if you want.
• Figure 36-13: URLs automatically become links in IMs.
In order for iChat to automatically process
URLs, they must include the initial http://,
https://, ftp://, and so forth. Just using
www.sitename.com doesn’t work.
1.
In the iChat instant message window, type
some text that you want to be the name of the
link.

Technique 36: Innovative iChat
286
• Figure 36-14: Use the Ô-K shortcut to make a named
link.
2.
Select the text.
3.
Press Ô-K.
4.
In the resulting prompt, type the URL for the
link (see Figure 36-14).
5.
Press Return or click OK.
Dragging a site’s proxy icon (the icon which
appears next to the URL in the location bar)
from the Safari browser into iChat creates a
link for that Web site by using its name.

Part VI
Optimizing Your
Network

Getting Your Mac
Online
P
retty much every computer is connected to a network of some kind
or another, whether this network is a home setup, at the office, or
just logging on to the Internet with your modem. In this technique,
we discuss some of the tricks to getting your Mac online. We cover every-
thing that you need to know to quickly create new locations, and then we
go through modem settings. Finally, we cover some tips and tricks that
are helpful if you frequently switch locations (in other words, if you move
your Mac or change your networking configurations).
Defining a Location
To connect your Mac to any network, including the Internet, you need to
define a location. A location is a saved setting that defines your network
information. You normally base a location on where your computer is
physically located because the network particulars change depending
upon where you are at:

If you have only one computer that never travels (a desktop machine),
you need to define and use only one location. 

If you have a laptop that travels at all, you want to create multiple
locations. You might have locations for
 Your home cable or DSL modem
 A dialup connection at home
 The network at your office
 When you visit your aunt and uncle in another state
 Traveling out of town for work
When you move your computer — and therefore change networks —
add a new network instead of altering your existing network settings.
(That is, unless you’ve moved permanently or no longer need the
original settings for some reason.)

Enter a descriptive name for this location in the
prompt that appears (as shown in Figure 37-3)
and then click OK.
This is Larry’s location for when he visits
Bethany Beach, Delaware. Because this is the
only Bethany he knows, it’s a descriptive enough
name. You might also use At the Office or Home
Broadband.
5.
Select Network Port Configurations from the
Show drop-down list.
6.
Deselect any ports that this connection doesn’t
need (see Figure 37-4).
If you opted for any Internet service at all when you
first used Tiger (or if you upgraded to Tiger), you
already have a location named Automatic. If you want
to use your computer in a new location (for example,
if you take your laptop into work), you have to add
another. To add a location, follow these steps:
Every user of a networked Mac can use every
location created by any user.
1.
Open System Preferences and click the
Network icon.
The Network icon is displayed under Internet &
Network (see Figure 37-1). After you click it, the
Network panel appears. 
• Figure 37-1: Click the Network icon to manage your
locations.
2.
Make sure that the Network panel is unlocked.
If the padlock icon in the lower-left corner of the
Network panel appears locked, you need to
unlock it. Just click it, enter your administrative
password at the prompt, and then press Return.
After you do this, you can make changes to the
Network settings.

Defining a Location
291
• Figure 37-3: Give this location a name that lets you know
where and when to use it.
• Figure 37-4: Configure the network ports after adding a
new location.
Your computer connects to networks using a 
single port (access point). What port you use
depends upon what ports your computer has and
what ports the network supports. Ports include
 Your modem
 A built-in Ethernet connection
 An AirPort or AirPort Extreme card
 A Personal Computer Memory Card
International Association (PCMCIA) card
(wireless or not)
 An Infrared Data Association (IrDA; infrared)
connection
 A FireWire port
 Bluetooth
 A USB port
The Network panel automatically enables every
port for a new location, but you don’t need to
keep them all on because most locations won’t
use multiple ports. Disable each port that you
won’t use by following these steps:
a. Select the port in the window.
b. Disable the port. You can either clear the
check box (to disable the port without delet-
ing it) or click the Delete button and then
click Delete at the prompt.
Disabling a port and deleting it has the same
effect. However, some ports can’t be deleted
(such as your internal modem and built-in
Ethernet), but others can (such as a second
modem or a FireWire port).
7.
Choose Show➪Network Status.
You see the name of the port being used (like
Built-in Ethernet) and a red, yellow, or green bub-
ble, along with some text (refer to Figure 37-2). 
8.
Check whether your network is already fully
functioning in this new location. 
 If you see a green bubble and the message
that you’re already connected to the Internet,
you’re good to go. 
 If you see a yellow or red bubble, the port is
active but an Internet connection hasn’t been
made. You need to either configure the port
or dial up to the Internet via your modem (as
we describe in the “Fixing Port Problems”
sidebar).

3.
From the Show drop-down list, select your
modem (probably Internal Modem). 
4.
On the PPP tab (see Figure 37-5), enter 
 The dialup settings that your ISP provided you
 Your password (so every user can use this
connection)
• Figure 37-5: The PPP tab of the modem configuration
pane is where you enter your ISP
information.
5.
Click the PPP Options button.
The PPP Options dialog appears. (See Figure 37-6.)
6.
Configure your dialup settings.
Keep yourself online by 
 Setting Tiger to prompt every so many minutes
(30 at the most) to maintain the connection.
 Deselect the Disconnect If Idle For xx Minutes
option.
If you frequently have trouble dialing in, set
Redial to 4 or 5, with a 5- or 10-second interval
between redials.
Fixing port problems
If your active port didn’t immediately get you an Internet
connection, you need to do one of the following:

Configure your modem (and then make the phone
call). See “Using a Modem” later in this chapter.

Configure AirPort or another wireless connection. See
Technique 38.

Configure your Ethernet connection. Use either the
information provided by your ISP or the method rec-
ommended by your router’s manual (if you’re using a
router).
9.
Click the Apply Now button to use this network
immediately.
10.
Click the padlock icon to ensure that the net-
work settings aren’t changed.
If you ever have trouble with the Network
panel, click the Assist Me button at the bottom
of the window or click the question mark icon
(bottom right) to bring up Mac help. 
Using a Modem
If you’re dialing up to get your Internet access,
properly configuring your modem improves the
experience. To configure the modem, either

Select Internal Modem from the Show drop-down
list in the Network panel (if you have an internal
modem). 

Select the appropriate port from the Show drop-
down list (if you have an external modem). 
To optimize your modem’s configuration, we recom-
mend the following steps:
1.
Open the Network System Preferences panel.
2.
From the Location drop-down list, select your
location.

Using a Modem
293
The first four options in the PPP Options dialog
have a big effect on when you go online and
whether you stay online. Dialup connections are
notorious for kicking off users. Fine-tune these
settings to minimize those occurrences. For
example, if you get disconnected after about 
15 minutes, set the prompt to every 10 minutes
to maintain the connection.
• Figure 37-6: Set the PPP options to keep yourself online.
7.
Click OK to return to the Network preferences
dialog.
Don’t worry about the TCP/IP and the Proxies
tabs — you probably don’t want to mess with
them.
8.
Use the Modem tab to make your life easier
(see Figure 37-7):
 Select the Off radio button next to Sound if
you get tired of hearing the end-of-the-world-
like dialing-up noise.
 Under Connection, decide whether you want
to be interrupted by incoming calls.
 Show the modem status in the menu bar (see
Figure 37-8) to control your connection with-
out using the Network panel.
• Figure 37-7: Adjust the modem’s behavior in the 
Modem tab.
• Figure 37-8: The Modem menu lets you go online 
with ease.
9.
Click the Apply Now button to activate your
changes.
You can also set multiple dialup settings (dif-
ferent phone numbers and passwords) in the
Internet Connect application, which you can
access from the Modem menu bar tool.

294
Switching locations on the fly
If you have multiple locations set up, you can easily
switch from one to the other without going through
the Network panel:

The Location menu (see Figure 37-9) is under the
Apple menu. To switch locations, just choose
from the list of options there.
• Figure 37-9: Quickly switch networks from the Apple
menu.
The Location menu is also a quick shortcut to
get to your Network preferences panel.

Location X (http://homepage.mac.com/
locationmanager, $20) is a utility that adds a
menu to the menu bar at the top of your screen.
Location X also lets you
 Order your list of locations so that they
appear according to your demand for them.
 Set individual passwords for each location.
 Change e-mail settings, default Web page, time
zone, and printer configuration.
 Use AppleScripts and shell scripts.
 Add to its feature set by using plug-ins.
What’s a protocol anyway?
Networks make use of protocols. These are guidelines for
computers to speak to each other. Tiger supports just about
every protocol you can name, including

AppleTalk: AppleTalk has been around for years and
used to be how a Mac talked to other Macs and
peripherals. People well-versed in the protocol still use
it, but its popularity is dwindling.

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol): TCP/IP is the primary protocol for comput-
ers connecting to the Internet.

PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol): PPP is used by modems
to connect to the Internet.

PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet): This
protocol uses an Ethernet connection but simulates a
dialup PPP session.

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol): HTTP is the
default protocol for Web pages, which makes sense
because you access sites by using http://. Similar to
HTTP is HTTPS, which is a secure Web connection.

FTP (File Transfer Protocol): FTP is a very common
way to transfer files over the Internet (for example, to
upload pages to a Web site). FTP is normally accessed
by using an FTP application such as Fetch or Transmit.
SFTP, a secure version of FTP, is replacing FTP for
many users.

SMB (Server Message Block): SMB is the most com-
mon way to share files with Windows users.
You can also find Bonjour, which is a special technology
created by Apple to let computers automatically identify
other computers and peripherals. It isn’t a protocol, but it
uses these other protocols to function. We discuss this in
Technique 39.
Networking Tips and Tricks
Setting up a network connection isn’t the hardest
thing in the world. After you create one, numerous
networking tips and tricks are at your disposal. We
highlight the best of them here.

Networking Tips and Tricks
295
Ordering your ports
If you have several ports active in a single location —
for example, an AirPort and an Ethernet connection —
they can be active at the same time. The important
thing is that you can order these to give preference to
the most reliable connection. 
If you have multiple ways of connecting to the
Internet, you can order the connections so that
your computer uses the strongest option first, if it’s
available:
1.
Open the Network panel in System Preferences.
2.
Select Network Port Configurations from the
Show drop-down list.
3.
Click and drag any port to reorder the list.
If you have several networks active and acces-
sible to your computer, order your ports to
use the best network. You could have your
Internet connect via AirPort by default, but
back up to the Ethernet port as necessary.
Dialing with a calling card
If you’re in a hotel or somewhere else where you
might incur huge charges by dialing into an ISP, have
hope. You can use your calling card to dial up. Most
calling cards have a sequence of steps like this:
1.
Dial the calling card number (1-800-888-8888).
2.
Wait for the prompt, and then enter your mem-
ber number (2222222).
3.
Wait for the prompt, and then enter the phone
number to call (555-555-5555).
If you place all these numbers together, your modem
dials them all at once, missing the prompts. To wait for
prompts, use commas to indicate two-second pauses.
For example, you might change the modem telephone
number to be 18008888888,,,2222222,,,5555555555. Use
this as the Telephone Number value on the PPP tab
(when you show the modem configuration in the
Network panel). You’ll probably want to use this in a
new location, for when you travel.
Using FireWire over IP
You can network two computers with a FireWire
cable. This feature is quite useful for transferring
data between two Macs, if you

Don’t have an Ethernet cable

Have a FireWire cable

Don’t want to reboot one of the machines to use
FireWire target mode
Follow these steps to network with FireWire:
1.
Plug a FireWire cable into both computers.
2.
Open the Network System Preferences panel.
3.
Select Network Port Configurations from the
Show drop-down list.
4.
Select the Built-In FireWire check box.
If Built-In FireWire isn’t available as an option,
follow these steps to add it:
a. Click the New button.
b. Give the connection a descriptive name.
c. Select Built-In FireWire from the drop-down list.
d. Click OK.
5.
Click Apply Now (see Figure 37-10).
After you network two Macs with a FireWire
cable, you can follow the steps in Technique 40
to share a Mac’s Internet connection, using the
FireWire connection as the port. Then the sec-
ond computer can either access the Internet
through the first computer or access files stored
on the first computer.

The Wonderful
World of Wireless
Networking
W
ireless networks have increased in popularity in recent years
partly because the technology has improved and the prices
have come down. Simultaneously, the sales of Apple laptops
have increased, and many people use laptops as their primary comput-
ers instead of a conventional, wired desktop machine. The joys of a wire-
less connection can be seen in homes, college campuses, airports, and
coffee shops. The wireless world is no longer restricted to people who
have money to burn or a degree in Information Technology.
If you have the right hardware, creating and using a wireless network is
amazingly simple. But you can still gain more knowledge to facilitate your
wireless networking habits. In this technique, we first discuss what you
want in a base station and network card. Then we go over the basic steps
of creating an AirPort network. After that, we go over encryption, which
is an essential security concept. Finally, we show you some tips for
speeding up your wireless network.
What to Look for in a Wireless Network
Wireless networking requires two physical devices:

An access point (a base station or router) that connects to the Internet
(via a modem or over broadband) and passes along this connection to
the computers

A wireless network card for each computer to receive the information
transmitted by the base station
Your computer needs both a network card (like AirPort Extreme) and
the software for that card to work on your operating system in order to
function. The AirPort software comes with Tiger. The hardware is built-
in for some higher-end models, and optional for others (labeled AirPort
ready by Apple, meaning that the AirPort card must be purchased sep-
arately). If you want to use a non-Apple network card, make sure that
the manufacturer also provides Tiger-compatible software.

Technique 38: The Wonderful World of Wireless Networking
298
If you can plug a printer into your access
point, you can make your Mac even more
wireless. And Bonjour makes it easy for your
Mac to find and use networked hardware (see
Technique 39).

iTunes broadcasting: AirPort Express can act as
an intermediary between the iTunes collection
on your Mac and your home stereo. By connect-
ing this device to your receiver, you can play
your MP3s throughout the house!

Ethernet ports to support wired computers:
Most access points can network computers
either wirelessly or by using a standard Ethernet
cable. Having a couple Ethernet ports is useful if
you have computers without wireless cards or 
if a visitor wants to hop on your network via a
computer that doesn’t have a wireless card.

A long range: There’s a big difference between a
base station’s advertised range and its true
range. The true range is also affected by the
materials used in the building where the network
is (concrete and steel are killers), the distance
the network covers, and how many/what kind of
dense objects the connection must go through.
You want a true range that’s the size of your
building but not so large that it’s easily picked up
by neighbors. Most base stations can broadcast
up to around 100 feet, which is fine for apart-
ments and smaller houses. People in bigger or
multi-storied buildings might require multiple
base stations to cover the entire area.

Support for encryption: Encryption is critical to
maintaining a secure wireless network. See
“Understanding Encryption” later in this tech-
nique for more.
We recommend buying a network card and
base station from the same manufacturer to
ensure that you can use encryption on your
network. Encryption schemes can be incompati-
ble between different manufacturers’ hardware.
You also get better technical support if the net-
work card and access point are made by the
same people.
In simplified terms, the access point (AP) is like a
radio station sending out signals, and the network
cards are like antennas, catching those signals out of
the air.
In this section, we use the terms router and
base station synonymously. Technically, a
router connects networks, like connecting a
number of computers in a home or office to the
Internet. A base station is a transmitter/receiver
that’s used to handle wireless signals. Base 
stations and routers often serve other purposes,
like assigning IP addresses to computers, creat-
ing a firewall (see Technique 41), and connect-
ing peripherals, such as printers. Manufacturers
blur the lines in these definitions as well. For
example, Larry’s access point is called a router
by D-Link (who makes it), but Marc’s access
point is an Apple AirPort Express. Both provide
wired and wireless connectivity to Macs and
PCs alike.
You don’t have to use the Apple AirPort Base Station
or AirPort Card in order to have a wireless network.
In fact, you can pretty much get most base stations
to work with most network cards. When choosing a
base station, look for the following features:

Built-in firewall: Most routers have a firewall or
a Network Address Translation (NAT) system to
protect your computer. See Technique 41 for
more information.

The ability to use a modem instead of an
Ethernet Internet connection: Most access
points connect to the Internet via a broadband
connection. More expensive routers also provide
modems to use a dialup connection as a backup
system. Alternatively, you can use a modem as a
primary Internet connection if one is built into
your access point.

Support for a printer: The latest AirPort Base
Station and the AirPort Express both include a
USB port to plug in a printer, letting you network
this device. (More expensive printers have
Ethernet connections so that they may be plugged
into any router.) Sure, your base station is wired
to the printer, but your desktop model or laptop is
freed.

Creating an AirPort Network
299

The ability to extend the antenna: Some base
stations can have their ranges expanded by
adding to or otherwise extending the antenna.

Support for the 802.11g wireless protocol: Two
protocols are widely available: 
 802.11g supports faster transfer speeds 
(54 Mbps) but has the annoyance factor of dis-
ruption from cordless phones and microwave
ovens. Apple’s AirPort Extreme and AirPort
Express can use either 802.11g and 802.11b.
 802.11b (Wi-Fi) is an older protocol that’s
used by basic AirPort.
A faster wireless protocol is headed down 
the pipeline, but it isn’t here at the time of this
writing.
Upgrading to the 802.11g protocol doesn’t
make file downloads or Web surfing faster.
The faster transfer speed improves transfers
only between computers and devices within
your network. The 802.11b standard already is
faster than your Internet connection.

Made by Apple: Although you can use many dif-
ferent kinds of hardware with your Mac, you have
the least work and the most compatibility if you
purchase Apple AirPort products. Furthermore,
most Macs are made to take an AirPort or AirPort
Extreme Card without using up a PC Card slot (a
common expansion area on desktop computers)
or USB port.
Wireless network alternatives
Not many manufacturers have created Mac OS X–compat-
ible network cards. (In other words, they haven’t developed
the software or drivers for your Mac.) If you want to save
some money and give yourself more network card options,
these manufacturers offer drivers for OS X:

WirelessDriver (http://wirelessdriver.
sourceforge.net, free): WirelessDriver works on
a couple dozen cards (see the list at the Web site),
but you won’t get much support and it isn’t the most
feature-rich driver. However, it’s free.

IOXperts (www.ioexperts.com, $20): For a reason-
able cost, IOXperts offers its own 802.11b driver. It 
also works with a number of different cards from 
various manufacturers but has better support and
development behind it. Visit this site for documenta-
tion, support, and a trial version of the driver.
Creating an AirPort Network
Because Apple believes that you don’t need to be a
rocket scientist to use its computers or equipment,
setting up an AirPort network isn’t a Herculean task.
In fact, even accessing a non-Apple base station with
an Apple AirPort Card is pretty easy, thanks to the
AirPort Setup Assistant. Here, then, is how you cre-
ate your wireless network with this utility:
1.
Install the AirPort card on your Mac.
If you’re installing the AirPort card yourself, 
follow the manual’s instructions exactly. Be
absolutely certain that the computer is off and
cooled — and that you discharge any static elec-
tricity before touching your computer’s innards.
2.
Turn on your Mac (if it isn’t already) and make
sure that you already have a working Internet
connection.
The base station uses the same Internet connec-
tion information as your Mac (because it replaces
your Mac for connecting to the Internet). Before
proceeding, make sure that your Mac can already
access the Internet. If you’ve never connected to
the Internet with your computer, your ISP pro-
vides this information for you.
3.
Install and turn on your base station.
Follow the manual’s instructions that come with
your base station. This might involve installing
the antenna and then plugging in the power cord.
(Yes, it’s usually that simple.) If you use a modem
to connect to the Internet, you need to connect
the base station’s modem port to a phone jack. If
you use a broadband connection, you need to run
an Ethernet cable from the base station to the
cable or DSL modem.

• Figure 38-2: Use this prompt to manually add a wireless
network.
6.
Enjoy your wire-free world!
To create an entirely non-AirPort network
(where Apple makes neither the base station
nor the wireless card), you go through similar
steps but use the software provided by your
hardware’s manufacturer instead. You should
have good instructions in the manuals that
come with the base station and network card.
Understanding Encryption
One problem with wireless networks is their
increased security risk. When you use a wireless
connection, all the transmitted data is floating
around the airwaves, ready to be intercepted. With
that in mind, we present a list of things that you
should know about security on wireless networks:

Use encryption. Your encryption options
depend on the networking hardware and soft-
ware in use:
 Use WPA Personal encryption if you can.
WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is an improved
encryption that corrects some flaws of WEP
(see the next item). If your network card and
Place your base station in a central location (as
central as possible) to provide the maximum
range throughout your home, office, or apart-
ment. Try to keep it clear of walls (and out of
closets) and away from electronic equipment
that puts out or interferes with radio-like waves.
This includes stereo speakers, microwaves, and
cordless phones.
4.
Run the AirPort Setup Assistant on your Mac by
double-clicking its icon in the Utilities folder.
5.
On the second page (see Figure 38-1), select
what you want to do and then click Continue.
 If this is your first time establishing an AirPort
network, choose the first option, and then fol-
low the prompts.
There are a number of steps here, depending
upon what decisions you make. The assistant
gives you detailed instructions along the way.
If you are ever unsure about an option, use
the default choice recommended (or selected)
by the assistant.
 If you’re modifying an existing AirPort network,
choose option number two.
• Figure 38-1: Use the AirPort Setup Assistant to connect
to an existing network or set up a new one.
If you have trouble connecting to an existing
network after running through the AirPort Setup
Assistant, select Other from the AirPort menu

Finding Networks
301
access point support WPA (most new AirPort
devices do), use it.
 Use WEP if WPA isn’t an option. The older
encryption method, WEP (Wired Equivalent
Protocol), can encrypt and decrypt transmit-
ted data, but it isn’t perfectly secure. It’s better
than no encryption.
Hackers have cracked WEP-protected networks.
Someone may listen to the data transmission
occurring between your computer and the base
station. They can steal your passwords, bank
account information (if you do online banking),
and more! This is the main disadvantage of
wireless networking. For most home networks,
it would take a long time for a hacker to crack
WEP (because of the smaller amount of traffic),
but don’t fool yourself into thinking that WEP
encryption is 100 percent safe.
Use at least 128-bit encryption with WEP. The
more bits, the harder the encryption is to
crack. Apple’s AirPort Extreme supports up to
128-bit encryption.

Use a really, really good password or key. Your
WEP key and WPA passwords let you log in to a
network (and keep those who don’t know it out).
It can be either hexadecimal (restricted to the
numbers 0 through 9 and the letters A through F)
or ASCII (plain text). Come up with the most ran-
dom key or password you possibly can.

Use encrypted network protocols whenever
possible. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connec-
tions to Web sites, MD5 authentication to e-mail
servers, and Secure FTP (SFTP) connections for
transferring files are far more secure options
than the unencrypted alternatives.
Finding Networks
Away from home or the office, you don’t have much of
a wireless experience if you can’t find a network. The
availability of wireless networks creates hotspots —
public areas where users can hop onto live connec-
tions. Some hotspots are intentionally free and legal
to use; others require an hourly usage charge; and
still others you can use for free (thanks to someone’s
lapse in security) even though doing so is technically
illegal. Good places to find wireless networks include

Coffee shops

Bookstores and libraries

Airport concourses

Hotel lobbies
Remember that an available network isn’t the
same as a network that you can legally use.
And, note that if you can access a network,
other computers on a network — and a net-
work administrator — can see and potentially
access your computer, too. So don’t think that
you’re safe or stealthy by using what should
be a private network.
Another good reason to use and require WEP
encryption on your wireless networks is that it
prevents neighbors from piggybacking your
connection. Without the proper key, other
computers can’t use your access point.
The easiest way to find available networks is to
adjust your Network settings accordingly:
1.
Open System Preferences.
2.
Click the Network icon, under Internet &
Network.
3.
Select your network card from the Show menu.
4.
Click the TCP/IP tab.
5.
In the resulting window (see Figure 38-3), select
Using DHCP from the Configure IPv4 drop-
down list.
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), a
very common protocol, is the preferred method
for most routers, wireless networks, and broad-
band connections. It lets your Mac receive its
connection information from the connection
provider rather than establishing set parameters.

of your own), you can set it to automatically
join a specific network. Just choose Preferred

enter all the requisite information in the boxes
that appear.

JiWire (www.jiwire.com, free): JiWire is similar
to WiFinder, listing over 50,000 hotspots avail-
able in over 90 countries.

WiFi Finder (www.kensington.com, $30): The
WiFi Finder is a little device that finds wireless
networks. It requires no other software and
works independently of your Macintosh.

WiFinder (www.wifinder.com, free): WiFinder is
an online resource for finding publicly available
wireless networks based upon geographic loca-
tion. You can perform searches there, and it even
lists both free and pay access points.
Being able to find a wireless network doesn’t
mean that you can connect through it. Secure
networks use some sort of encryption (see
earlier in this technique), meaning that you
need a password or key in order to connect.
So although you might be able to see an
available wireless network, you might not be
able to use that network.

onjour is Apple’s protocol for instantly recognizing other computers
and devices on the same network. In this technique, we give you the
skinny on what Bonjour is, what you can do to configure it on your
Mac, and how it works with some popular software and hardware. If you’ve
never had to try your hand at networking, you might not appreciate how
much easier Bonjour makes things, but by reading these pages you will see
how simply you can network printers, share music, and use iChat.
Why You Should Use Bonjour
Bonjour, simply put, is the most valuable timesaving tool that you can
use if you need to network computers and devices. Furthermore, Bonjour
brings some nice added features to many of the applications that you use
daily. However, if you have a single computer that isn’t connected to any
network, you can’t benefit from Bonjour. 
If you have multiple computers or a network, you can use Bonjour easily
perform tasks like these:

Find computers by name — not Internet Protocol (IP) address

Locate people in iChat

Listen to other music collections in iTunes

View iPhoto pictures on another person’s Mac

Use a printer not connected to your computer
In the non-Apple world, the Bonjour concept is referred to as Zeroconf,
for zero configuration. For more information on the technology as a
whole, see www.zeroconf.org.

Technique

Using Bonjour with Software
305
Setting Up Bonjour
You don’t have to do anything to begin working with
Bonjour, but you can make your computer more
identifiable to others on the network by giving it an
appropriate Bonjour name. Although your computer
will have a default Bonjour name, here’s how to cre-
ate your own:
1.
Open System Preferences and click the Sharing
icon (under Internet & Network).
In the Sharing panel that appears (as shown in
Figure 39-1), your computer name appears in the
Computer Name text box. 
Your default Bonjour name is your computer
name plus the suffix .local.
• Figure 39-1: The Sharing panel controls how your
computer is identified.
If your computer name contains characters
that are invalid in Bonjour (such as a space),
Tiger converts them to valid characters. For
example, G4 iBook becomes G4-iBook.local
in Bonjour. Likewise, It’s a name! becomes its-
a-name.local.
2.
Click the Edit button.
3.
At the prompt (see Figure 39-2), enter a new
Bonjour name in the Local Hostname text box.
Only letters, numbers, and hyphens are
allowed in a Bonjour name. Fortunately, this
prompt doesn’t let you enter characters that it
doesn’t like.
• Figure 39-2: Use the prompt to create a new Bonjour name.
Try to name your computer something mean-
ingful to other computer users. They’re the
ones who’ll see it in their Bonjour-enabled
applications.
4.
Click OK.
5.
Close System Preferences.
If Bonjour doesn’t recognize a computer, it
names that computer Macintosh.local.
Using Bonjour with Software
Bonjour works with many applications, adding cool
new features to already fantastic tools. Most of these
applications come from Apple, but an increasing
amount of third-party software supports Bonjour.
Here’s a highlight of what each application brings to
the table:

iChat: iChat finds people on your network who
are available for instant messaging, chatting, and
video- or audioconferencing. Bonjour automati-
cally adds available people and removes them
when they go offline. To do this, see the upcom-
ing section, “Using Bonjour with iChat.”

Technique 39: Sharing the Wealth with Bonjour
306

BBEdit (www.barebones.com/products/
bbedit/index.shtml, $179): The best of all pos-
sible text editors now supports Bonjour for find-
ing FTP and SFTP servers on your network. It’s
much like Transmit except that it’s also a text
editor.

Games: Many games coming out now use
Bonjour to find other players. Aspyr (www.
aspyr.com) was one of the first developers to
start using this feature.

World Book Encyclopedia (www.worldbook.com):
This encyclopedia application — which ships for
free with some new computer purchases — lets
students share their work.
• Figure 39-3: Larry has added Bonjour bookmarks to his
Collections so they appear in the Bookmarks
window.
Using Bonjour with iChat
To automatically add available people and remove
them from iChat when they go offline, follow these
steps:
1.
Enable Bonjour Messaging by either
 Selecting the Use Bonjour Messaging check
box when you start iChat AV for the first time
(see Figure 39-4).
If you use wireless networking in a public area,
are in a large network, or dial up to a network
by using a modem, you could easily become
overwhelmed with the number of people that
Bonjour finds. 

iTunes: iTunes might take the cake for cool
Bonjour features. It just has one Bonjour feature,
but it’s a good one: Bonjour on iTunes lets you
listen to other people’s music. To do this, see the
upcoming section, “Using Bonjour with iTunes.”

iPhoto: The most excellent photograph manage-
ment application has a new feature in version 4:
You can share images over a network by using
Bonjour.
You can buy the latest version of iPhoto in one
of two ways. On the expensive side, if you buy
a new Mac, it comes with the latest version of
iPhoto. The more economical path is to pur-
chase iLife for $50 (store.apple.com), which
gives you the latest versions of iPhoto, iMovie,
iDVD, and GarageBand.

Safari: Safari can access local Web addresses by
using Bonjour. To enable this, select one of the
three Include Bonjour check boxes in the
Bookmarks preferences panel (as shown in 
Figure 39-3). Then you see bookmarks for sites
that Bonjour finds added to your Bookmarks 
Bar, Bookmarks Menu, or Collections in the
Bookmarks window. (See Technique 30 for more
on Safari.)

SubEthaEdit (www.codingmonkeys.de/
subethaedit, $35): SubEthaEdit (apparently its
former name, Hydra, was just too easy to spell)
is a text editor that allows people to work
together on the same document at the same time
without worrying about messing up each other’s
work. You can use it over the Internet or on a
network with the help of Bonjour.

Transmit (www.panic.com/transmit, $25): This
popular File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client lists
local FTP servers using Bonjour. Because it also
supports Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP),
Transmit is a good way to transfer files to net-
worked users who’ve enabled Remote Login.

Using Bonjour with Software
307
• Figure 39-4: When you first use iChat, you’re given the
option to enable Bonjour.
 Choosing iChat➪Preferences and then clicking
the Accounts icon. Then select the Bonjour
account in the Accounts preferences panel
(see Figure 39-5) and edit the Account
Information settings.
• Figure 39-5: You can always turn Bonjour on and off in
iChat through the preferences panel.
2.
Open the Bonjour window by using either
 The Window menu 
 The Ô-2 keyboard shortcut
When you launch iChat or turn on Bonjour in
iChat, Bonjour automatically finds other users on
your network who are online. These people are
displayed in the Bonjour window (see Figure
39-6), which behaves almost exactly like your
Buddy List.
• Figure 39-6: Bonjour in iChat managed to find Larry’s
other self!
3.
Chat, instant-message, or send a file to a found
Bonjour person as you normally would.
When you use Bonjour, you now have two lists
(windows) of people you can chat with: your
Buddy List and the Bonjour window. You can work
with both windows — and the people listed in
them — exactly the same. Double-click a person’s
name to send an instant message, Control-click 
a name to see a contextual menu, and so forth.
Marc has found that using Bonjour with iChat
during business meetings is surprisingly useful
and productive. After you have everyone rec-
ognized in your iChat, you can easily transfer
files back and forth through the Instant
Message window.

Technique 39: Sharing the Wealth with Bonjour
308
The shared name is for the benefit of other
people on your network — not yours. You can
leave them guessing with Hip DJ 72 or be
plain and descriptive with Larry’s Music.
7.
Decide whether you want to require a password.
By setting a password, you can let your friends
listen in but keep your mean co-workers or
annoying sibling out. If you set a password, users
see your collection listed but can’t see any
specifics until they enter the correct password
(see Figure 39-8).
• Figure 39-8: You can password-protect your playlists if
you want to share your music selectively.
8.
Click OK to save the sharing settings.
Now other users who’ve enabled the Look for
Shared Music option can see your music collec-
tion and playlists in their Collections window
(see Figure 39-9).
A nice message reminds you that sharing music
is for personal use only. In other words, this fea-
ture isn’t meant to be used as a radio station or
as a way to steal music.
Click the down arrow next to the collection name
to view the playlists.
You must keep iTunes open and your com-
puter awake for people to continue listening 
to your music. To see how many people are
connected to your tunes, look at the Status
heading at the bottom of the iTunes Sharing
preferences panel (see Figure 39-10).
Using Bonjour with iTunes
To set up Bonjour and iTunes so that you can listen
to other people’s music (if they are sharing) and
share your music with them, follow these steps:
1.
Open iTunes.
2.
Choose iTunes➪Preferences and click the
Sharing icon.
3.
In the resulting Sharing panel (see Figure 39-7),
enable the Look for Shared Music check box.
This setting actually lets you see other people’s
music — and while you’re sharing yours, you
might as well look for theirs, too.
• Figure 39-7: Enable sharing in iTunes to let others see
(and hear) your good taste in tunes.
4.
Enable the Share My Music check box.
5.
Under the Share My Music check box, set
iTunes to share either your entire library or
just selected playlists.
6.
In the Shared Name text box, give your music a
meaningful name.

Using Bonjour with Software
309
• Figure 39-9: Other people’s music collections appear as
playlists with a special blue icon. 
• Figure 39-10: Only one person is currently accessing
Larry’s music.
Using Bonjour with iPhoto
To set up Bonjour and iPhoto so that you can see
other people’s photos and they can see yours, follow
these steps:
This works only in iPhoto version 4 and later.
1.
On the computer that’s sharing the images,
open iPhoto.
2.
Open the iPhoto preferences panel and click
the Sharing icon.
3.
In the resulting Sharing panel (see Figure
39-11), enable the Look for Shared Photos
check box.
If other people have enabled Bonjour sharing
within their iPhoto application, you’ll now be
able to peruse their albums.
• Figure 39-11: Enable sharing in iPhoto to let others check
out your visual artistry.
4.
Enable the Share My Photos check box.
5.
Under the Share My Photos check box, set
iPhoto to share your entire library or just
selected albums.
6.
In the Shared Name text box, give your collec-
tion a meaningful name.

Technique 39: Sharing the Wealth with Bonjour
310
As of the time of this writing, Bonjour can locate

Other Macs (running OS 10.2 or later)

Printers
You can use Bonjour to find a printer on your
network or to find a printer connected to
another computer on your network. Brother,
Canon, Epson, Hewlett-Packard, Lexmark, and
Xerox create printers that support Bonjour.

Storage devices (such as Redundant Array of
Inexpensive Disks, or RAID)

TiVo units

Digital cameras

Scanners
For specific information on using Bonjour to find
other computers and printers, see Technique 40. 
The shared name is for the benefit of other
people on your network, so that they know
whose files they’re accessing. 
7.
Decide whether you want to require a password.
By setting a password, you can let be more judi-
cious in letting people see your photographs. If
you set a password, users see your collection
listed but can’t see any specific albums or
images until they enter the correct password.
8.
Now other users who’ve enabled the Look for
Shared Photos option can see your collection
and albums in their collections window.
Using Bonjour with Hardware
You can use Bonjour with hardware as well as soft-
ware. In these cases, instead of finding people in
iChat or music in iTunes, Bonjour helps you access
networked devices, such as

Y
our Mac can interact with other computers on your network in
many ways. For the beginner, this normally means accessing some
other computer to view a Web page or retrieve files. But by making
judicious use of Tiger’s Sharing features, you can easily and securely
share your wealth — files, connected hardware, and even your Internet
access — with others as well.
This technique focuses on the many types of sharing that your Mac can
do. We begin by addressing the security risks involved with these fea-
tures. From there we move on to Web sharing, which involves hosting
Web sites on your Mac. Then we dig into file sharing — a great way to
move documents around. After that, you see how easily you can share
your printer or Internet access with other users.
If you find yourself frequently turning the different sharing tools on
and off, consider SharingMenu, (www.mani.de/en, free). This share-
ware (in every sense of the word) creates a menu bar item that gives
you quick access to the various sharing options offered by Tiger.
Safe Sharing
Sharing your computer creates some security risks. By letting others
access your computer, you run the risk of them doing bad things, ranging
from stealing information to crashing the system. Bad things don’t
always happen . . . but they can. Here’s a nonscientific hierarchy of the
most-secure to least-secure sharing options. You enable these (except
Internet access) on the Services tab of the Sharing dialog of System
Preferences:

directory, but it doesn’t have to stop there. With this
tool — after the proper configuration — you can also
run the following Web development tools:

PHP scripts

JavaServer Pages

Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts

WebObjects pages

WebDAV
For more information on any of these Web-
development tools, search Google or check out
O’Reilly’s MacDevCenter (www.macdevcenter.
com). Marc has created an installer for adding
PHP to your Mac (check out the Mac OS X
software section of www.entropy.ch), and
Larry has written many books about PHP (by
using a Mac as his primary test computer).
To turn on and use Web sharing, follow these steps:
1.
Open System Preferences.
2.
Click the Sharing icon under Internet &
Network.
3.
Enable the Personal Web Sharing check box
(see Figure 40-1).
After you turn on Personal Web Sharing, Tiger
shows you a few test hyperlinks at the bottom
of the Sharing panel. Click any of these to
open your site in your default Web browser.
4.
Place the files for your site within your Sites
folder (in your Home directory).
5.
Open Safari on your computer.
6.
Go to http://localhost/~username (see 
Figure 40-2).
If you attempt to go to http://localhost in
your Web browser and it reports that the
address can’t be found, Personal Web Sharing
isn’t turned on.
You can feel pretty safe sharing Web sites,
printers or Internet access. These don’t require
usernames or passwords, and they don’t allow
access to your Mac’s operating system or the
file structure at large.

The most prudent decision that you can make
is to turn on only those sharing services that
you need — and only when you need them.
Turn off services when they aren’t necessary.
Most importantly, never give out the user-
name and password of a Mac’s administrator.
If others must log on to your computer, set up
a basic, non-administrative user for this pur-
pose. (Use the Accounts panel under System
Preferences to create the new user.)
Sharing a Web Page
Personal Web Sharing is Apple’s fancy description of
hosting Web sites. Little did you know that your Mac
has a very sophisticated Web-hosting tool built into
it. With this feature, you can develop Web sites on
your Mac — and, if your ISP allows it, you can host
sites that are available to anyone in the world.
Personal Web Sharing lets you access Web
pages running on your own computer and
also lets other computers on your network or
the Internet access them. If you develop Web
sites, you can fully build them on your com-
puter and then upload them to a live server
after they’re finished.
Personal Web Sharing lets you run static HyperText
Markup Language (HTML) pages from your Sites

What’s in a Name (Or URL?)
313
• Figure 40-1: Web sharing is now running.
• Figure 40-2: This is the default Web page placed in a
user’s Sites directory.
What’s in a Name (Or URL)?
After you enable Web sharing, you have many ways
to access your Web site. From your own computer,
you can point your browser to one of these two
locations:

http://localhost/~username

http://127.0.0.1/~username
The word localhost and the IP address
127.0.0.1 are two different ways to refer to
your own machine (and they always refer to
just your own computer). If your computer is
on a network (online, that is), it has a second
IP address that is unique to your computer —
127.0.0.1 is how every computer refers to
itself. You can also use this second IP address
to find your machine in the Web browser.

http://your.ip.address/~username (for exam-
ple, http://192.168.0.100/~username)
From another computer, your Web site can be
accessed through
http://your.ip.address/~username
Advanced Apache management
Personal Web Sharing is really just the Apache Web server —
the most popular (and arguably the best) Web server appli-
cation available. From the Terminal application, you can con-
trol Apache with

sudo apachectl start to turn on Personal Web
Sharing

sudo apachectl stop to turn off Personal Web
Sharing

sudo apachectl graceful to restart Personal 
Web Sharing
Your Personal Web Sharing (Apache) relies upon the /etc/
httpd/httpd.conf file to control its behavior. You can
modify this file if you know what you’re doing. (You should
probably back it up first, just in case.) For example, if only one
user on your machine will use Personal Web Sharing and
you’d rather use http://localhost or http://127.0.
0.1 instead of http://localhost/~username or http://
127.0.0.1/~username to access those pages, you can
change these settings. You can also edit the httpd.conf file
to turn on and off features you might want, such as support
for PHP or WebDAV.

314
• Figure 40-3: Personal File Sharing is now running.
5.
As a security measure, go back to the Sharing
panel and turn off Personal File Sharing after
the files no longer need to be shared.
When you disable Personal File Sharing, you’re
given an option of how quickly to disconnect it
and what message to send to connected users.
These messages appear as alerts in the Finder
of connected Mac users.
Now that you’ve enabled Personal File Sharing and
made some files available, other users can access
the files. To do so, follow these steps:
1.
On another Mac, choose Network from the
Finder’s Go menu or press Ô-Shift-K.
2.
In the resulting window (see Figure 40-4), double-
click the icon for the computer you want to
access.
3.
In the resulting prompt (as shown in Figure 40-5),
select Guest.
You don’t need to enter a username or password.
Fun with File Sharing
If you want to share your stuff with other computer
users or make it easier for them to share their stuff
with you, use file sharing. The two main tools for file
sharing are

Personal File Sharing: Personal File Sharing is an
easy way to let other Mac users access the
Public folders found within every user’s Home
directory on your Mac.

Windows Sharing: You need to use Windows
Sharing to let a Windows user access your files
or use a Mac printer. 
From Windows, the user can go to //your.ip.
address/username and then log in with your user-
name and password. For this reason, you might
want to create a new account without administra-
tive privileges. (Choose System Preferences➪
Accounts to create the new user, making sure that
the Allow user to administer this computer option
isn’t enabled.)
Read on to discover how to easily use Personal File
Sharing to transfer files between two Macs.
Personal File Sharing
To turn on Personal File Sharing, follow these steps:
1.
Open System Preferences.
2.
Click the Sharing icon under Internet & Network.
The Sharing window appears.
3.
Select the Personal File Sharing check box (as
shown in Figure 40-3).
After you turn on Personal File Sharing, text
appears at the bottom of the Sharing window
(above the padlock icon) that tells you how to
access your computer.
4.
Place files to be shared within your Public
folder (in your Home directory).

New to Tiger is an Actions drop-down list in
the login prompt that appears when you log in
as a registered user (see Figure 40-6). One
possible action is to change a remembered
password. Another (Options) brings up a win-
dow of different security-related settings you
can tweak.
4.
In the resulting Finder window (see Figure
40-7), double-click the user’s folder that you
want to access.
• Figure 40-6: The new and improved login prompt has an
Actions menu.
• Figure 40-7: If the Mac has multiple users, decide which
user’s public files you want to access.
5.
Double-click the mounted network drive on
your Desktop to open it in a Finder window
(see Figure 40-8).
After you successfully log in to a networked com-
puter, it appears like a removable drive on your
Desktop, although with a special network icon.
After you open this in a Finder window, you can
 Transfer files to that computer by dropping
them in the Drop Box folder.

• Figure 40-9: Shared printers should automatically appear
in the Printer Setup Utility.
3.
Select the shared printer and click the Make
Default icon.
4.
Print to the shared printer as you would to a
connected printer.
The next time you go to print a document, the
networked printer appears as the default printer
(as long as it’s turned on and connected and the
primary computer is on). You can send your
document to this networked printer as if it were
connected to your Mac.
Sharing Your Internet
Connection
A pretty cool feature built into Tiger is the ability to
share an Internet connection. This means that one
Mac can be online (through a dialup modem, cable
modem, DSL, or other type of Internet connection),
and another computer can access the Internet
through the first computer’s connection.
If you have multiple computers but use a
modem dialup connection or don’t have 
a router to allow multiple computers on a
broadband network, use Internet Sharing.
Here’s how to set up and enable Internet Sharing:
1.
Open System Preferences and click the
Network icon.
The Network panel appears.
2.
Select Network Port Configurations from the
Show drop-down list (see Figure 40-10).
 Transfer files from that computer if they’re
available in the Finder window (like the
Ch_40_figures folder in Figure 40-8).
• Figure 40-8: The contents of Larry’s Public folder.
6.
Drag the mounted drive icon from the Desktop
onto the Trash in order to log off of the server
once you are done.
Print Sharing
Between Bonjour (see Technique 39) and Printer
Sharing, sharing one printer on a network is surpris-
ingly easy. Here’s how to set it up:
1.
Make sure that the printer is turned on and
connected to the primary computer that will be
doing the sharing.
2.
On the primary computer, open the System
Preferences.
3.
Click the Sharing icon under the Internet &
Network heading.
4.
Select the Printer Sharing check box.
To use a shared printer from another Mac:
1.
On the secondary computer, open the Printer
Setup Utility (in the Utilities folder).
2.
Click the down arrow next to Shared Printers
(see Figure 40-9).

Sharing Your Internet Connection
317
• Figure 40-10: Check your active network ports before
sharing a connection.
3.
Make sure that at least two ports are active (to
make them active, select them in the list box):
 You need one port that provides this computer
with Internet access (from your telephone,
cable, or DSL modem).
 You need another port for connecting the sec-
ond computer to this one.
4.
Click the Apply Now button to activate the 
settings.
5.
Select Network Status from the Show drop-
down list and make sure you have an active
Internet connection.
There’s no point in trying to share something you
don’t have, so make sure the sharing (or host)
computer is actually online first. Use the informa-
tion in Technique 37 to get your Internet connec-
tion up and running if any problems occur.
6.
Select Sharing from the View drop-down list.
The following steps use the Sharing panel.
7.
Click the Internet tab.
8.
In the Share Your Connection From drop-down
list, select the port where you get your Internet
connection.
This might be your AirPort or other wireless
card, your modem, or your built-in Ethernet port.
9.
In the To Computers Using list, select the check
box next to the port through which the second
computer will connect (see Figure 40-11).
For example, this might be your built-in Ethernet
port or a FireWire port.

This should match the port selected in Step 9 in
the preceding step list.
5.
Click the Apply Now button to activate the 
settings.
• Figure 40-12: Tiger gives you one last word of advice
before turning on Internet sharing.
For the other Mac to use this shared Internet connec-
tion, follow these steps:
1.
Connect the two computers by using the appro-
priate cable and access ports.
The choice you made in Step 9 in the preceding
list (the sharing port) dictates what kind of con-
nection to make. So you might connect from one
FireWire port to another or from one Ethernet
port to another.

Network Security
I
f your Mac is on a network, you need to be mindful of security.
Whether your computer is on a company’s intranet or just uses a
modem to dial up to the Internet, if your computer ever talks to
another computer you have to be a little careful. Mac OS X is fairly
secure in its default state (much more so than, say, um, Windows), but
that doesn’t mean you can’t still use a trick or two.
In this technique, we suggest taking three steps to protect your Mac.
First, we show you what to do to secure your Mac using Tiger. Second,
we recommend that you run a firewall. Finally, we recommend some tools
you can use to check for potential security violations. By following a few
simple rules, you can use your computer without worrying about
unwanted intruders.
Keeping Your Mac Secure
Network security is first and foremost a matter of turning off features you
aren’t using. The Sharing System Preferences panel (see Figure 41-1) lets
you turn different features on and off by selecting or deselecting the check
boxes on the Services tab. Each of these features adds functionality — but
at the cost of decreased security. The most secure rules for sharing your
computer are

Leave all Sharing options turned off at all times, if you can.

If you must use a type of sharing, enable it only as long as it’s 
necessary.

Try to use the most secure type of sharing for what you need to
accomplish.
Note the list of the hierarchy of security at the beginning of 
Technique 40. For example, using the FTP Access options is less secure
than Remote Login, but you can use both for the same purposes. 

Use a firewall to protect your computer (see the following section).

through every port. (A port is a gateway into 
a computer.) If you need to turn on some
Sharing features, you can explicitly open those
ports to make the sharing feasible.
To enable a firewall, follow these steps:
1.
Open System Preferences.
2.
Click the Sharing icon, under the Internet &
Network heading.
3.
In the Sharing panel, click the Firewall tab.
If you want something a little more user-
friendly than the built-in firewall, check out
Firewalk X 2 (http://pliris-soft.com, $35)
or ContentBarrier X (www.intego.com, $60).
Both are easy-to-use products, but they essen-
tially provide the same functionality as the
built-in firewall (and at a higher price).
4.
On the Firewall tab, click the Start button (see
Figure 41-2).
• Figure 41-2: Use the Firewall tab of the Sharing panel to
enable and control your firewall.
• Figure 41-1: Turn off all Sharing options when you aren’t
using them.
Using a Firewall
A firewall is a special type of security device that 
creates a barrier between your computer and other
computers. You can normally create a firewall by using
a combination of hardware and software. A firewall
allows your computer to do everything it needs to do
but prevents other computers, Trojan horses (software
that does malicious things under false pretenses), and
the like from getting into your computer or your data.
Software firewalls
Earlier versions of Mac OS X had a built-in firewall
but didn’t provide a good graphical user interface to
it. Most users resorted to using third-party applica-
tions to easily manage their firewall. Fortunately for
all of us, Tiger includes a firewall configuration tool,
also found in the Sharing panel.
To protect your computer from outside intru-
sions, turn on the built-in firewall. The firewall
is exclusionary, meaning that it denies access

Using a Firewall
321
A firewall doesn’t affect any outgoing traffic
(things you do) except for your FTP applica-
tion. If you have your firewall enabled, you
might have difficulty accessing remote servers
via FTP unless you select the Use Passive FTP
Mode (PASV) check box on the Proxies tab of
the Network panel (see Figure 41-3).
• Figure 41-3: Enable PASV to use FTP when your Mac is
behind a firewall.
5.
If you use any of the Sharing services, make
sure the appropriate check box for that service
is selected on the Firewall tab of the Sharing
panel.
 Select the iChat Bonjour check box (see
Figure 41-4) if you want others to recognize
you by using Bonjour with iChat.
For Bonjour to work, it needs the freedom to
scan certain ports. If you have a firewall
enabled, other iChat users can’t see you
unless you grant that access.
 Select the iTunes Music Sharing check box 
if you want others to listen to your iTunes 
collection.
iTunes Music Sharing won’t work for other
users unless the proper port is open.
• Figure 41-4: At the bottom of the window are the options
to let iChat and iTunes find your computer.
 Select the iPhoto Bonjour Sharing check box if
you want others to see your iPhoto pictures.
If you need a little assistance understanding
how any item works, move your mouse over
the item’s description. A yellow box appears,
displaying more information (see Figure 41-5).
Hardware firewalls
You can put your computer behind a firewall with a
router on your network, such as an AirPort Base
Station. Routers create Network Address Translation
(NAT) firewalls for your network. Essentially, the
router appears as the machine being online: It’s part
of the wide area network (WAN). All the computers
connected to the router are 

Hidden from the WAN 

Part of the local area network (LAN)
If you have more than one computer at home,
school, or the office, spending $100 (or often less)
on the right router might be your easiest option.

Technique 41: Network Security
322
Blocking access to specific Web sites
If you’d like to keep people on your computer from access-
ing specific Web sites, you can do so by modifying the
/etc/hosts file. Here’s how:
1.
Open the Terminal.
2.
Type sudo pico /etc/hosts
This step opens the hosts file in the pico editor.
Adding information to this file adjusts how your com-
puter accesses Web sites.
3.
Enter the administrator’s password.
4.
At the end of the file in your text editor, add
127.0.0.1 someurl.com.
Replace someurl.com with the actual URL you want
to ban, such as google.com or espn.go.com. (You
should omit the initial http:// and www.) You can
add as many items as you want here by using this 
syntax, with each going on its own line.
5.
Press Control-X to exit.
6.
Press Y at the prompt to save the changes.
7.
Press Return at the final prompt.
8.
Restart your Mac.
The next time any user attempts to go to the named URL
in any browser, he is redirected back to his own computer.
This results in either a default, meaningless Web page
being displayed or a Server Not Found error message. This
is a great way for parents to keep kids out of particular sites,
for corporations to keep employees out of certain sites, or
to play practical jokes.
Checking for Security Problems
If you’re really paranoid (er, security conscious), you
can use an application to monitor network activity
on your Mac. The intention of such software is to
notify you of behind-the-scenes activity, so you’re
alerted if something unexplained is going on. These
tools won’t catch people trying to break into your
Some routers let you bypass the firewall for a
particular computer through specific ports (see
Figure 41-6). This is useful if you play games
online, do video conferencing, and the like.
• Figure 41-5: Hover your mouse over a listing to receive
helpful advice.
• Figure 41-6: The D-Link router has a control panel for
tweaking the firewall.

computer, but they see whether something on 
your computer is trying to access the Internet with-
out your knowledge. This could happen with Trojan
horses and some applications. (See the sidebar,
“Applications and your network.”)
Applications and your network
Some applications use a network connection without you
knowing it. For example, an application might harmlessly
check for software updates or check other computers on
your network to ensure that multiple copies of the same
software (that is, the same single-use serial number) aren’t
being used repeatedly. If you want to stop this behavior,
run these commands in the Terminal:
sudo ipfw add 0 deny tcp from any to
any 3464
sudo ipfw add 0 deny tcp from any to
any 2222
You enter the administrator’s password once, but both
ports are blocked.
Here are some popular tools for keeping an eye on
your computer’s network traffic:

MacScan (http://macscan.securemac.com,
free): MacScan looks for the various types of
malicious software that lingers on your computer
and tries to make connections to the outside
world. If it finds any, you’re notified and given the
option to remove the offending application.
The SecureMac.com Web site (www.
securemac.com) is generally good at keeping
you informed of network and general security-
related issues.

Little Snitch (www.obdev.at/products/
littlesnitch, $25): Little Snitch alerts you when
any application attempts to use a network con-
nection. You can then allow the connection to
occur, deny it, or tell Little Snitch what to do
when this happens.

Nmap (www.insecure.org/nmap, free): Nmap
scans your computer for potential security
holes, including open ports (gateways into your
computer). It can work on an entire network or
just a single computer.

326
If you list the iDisk in the Sidebar of the Finder
windows, you can also directly save files there
within applications from the Save dialog.
Naturally, you can also then open files from
your iDisk within an application by using the
Open dialog. See Technique 12 for customiz-
ing the Finder window Sidebar.
• Figure 42-3: Make your iDisk a constant presence by
adding it to the Finder window Sidebar.
Your iDisk mounts as an icon on your Desktop. After
you open this icon, you can work with the iDisk like
any other folder in the Finder (as shown in Figure
42-4). Your iDisk is organized like your Home direc-
tory, with a couple exceptions:

Your Documents, Music, Pictures, Movies, and
Library folders are private. They aren’t directly
available to other users.
If you store items in the Documents directory,
only users who have username and password
access to your iDisk can see them. This is a
good place to store files that you might need
to retrieve while traveling.

Your Sites folder is where your Web pages go.
Currently the .Mac account comes with a total
of 250MB of disk space. This space must be
allocated separately to your e-mail and to your
iDisk, which you do through the www.Mac.com
Web site (under Account). Even if you allocate
20MB of space for e-mail, which should be
more than enough, you still have 230MB for
your iDisk. You can buy more space if you
need it.
An iDisk is a pretty handy thing if you have a
fast Internet connection. If you don’t, you
might not find the iDisk to be that grand, par-
ticularly if you need to dial up every time you
need to access the thing.
To use your iDisk, you must mount it on your com-
puter first. As always, you have many ways of doing
this:

Press Ô-Shift-I in the Finder.

Choose Go➪iDisk➪My iDisk in the Finder (see
Figure 42-2).
• Figure 42-2: The Finder’s Go menu gives you access to
your iDisk as well as other people’s.

Use Finder’s preferences to add iDisk to the list
of items that appear in the Finder windows (see
Figure 42-3).

your_username points directly to your Sites
folder. This URL is case-insensitive, so http://
homepage.mac.com/YOUR_USERNAME and
http://homepage.mac.com/Your_Username
also work.

The Public folder is for sharing files with oth-
ers. (See the section titled “Making your iDisk
secure,” later in this chapter.)

The Backup folder is where the Backup applica-
tion stores files. You can download files from the
Backup folder by using the mounted iDisk, but
only the Backup application can modify this
folder’s contents (by adding or deleting items).

The Software folder is where Apple places Mac
software that you might like. Updates to Apple
applications appear in the Apple subfolder. The
Members Only subfolder contains bonus applica-
tions given out to .Mac members. You can find
out about newly available software by visiting (in
Safari) www.apple.com/software and www.
mac.com (the .Mac home page).
Making your iDisk secure
The Public folder of your iDisk is automatically
accessible to the world at large. Be careful with it.
Follow these steps to secure the folder:
1.
Open System Preferences.
2.
Click the .Mac icon (under the Internet &
Network heading).
3.
In the .Mac panel that appears, click the iDisk
tab (see Figure 42-5).
You use the iDisk preferences panel to tweak
your iDisk settings. It takes a few seconds to load
each time you click it while it attempts to syn-
chronize with your iDisk.
• Figure 42-5: Adjust your iDisk settings in the .Mac panel.
4.
Make sure that the Read Only radio button is
selected under Your Public Folder.
You can give people the option of both down-
loading (the Read Only radio button) and upload-
ing (the Read & Write radio button) files to your
Public folder. There’s really no need to let users
write to your iDisk unless you have to do some
serious file sharing and don’t want to use one of
the many other file sharing tools available (see
Technique 40).
5.
Select the Use a Password to Protect Your
Public Folder check box.
By selecting this check box, you require users to
enter a password to access this folder. You’re
given a prompt (as shown in Figure 42-6) to enter
the password.

Using another .Mac member’s iDisk
You can easily access another .Mac member’s iDisk
with Tiger. The iDisk submenu (under the Finder’s Go
menu, refer to Figure 42-2) gives you these options:

Other User’s Public Folder: To mount another
user’s Public folder, you need only his .Mac user-
name. Mind you, you can download files from a
person’s Public folder, but you can’t add files to it,
delete files from it, or otherwise change the Public
folder’s contents (unless you choose the Other
User’s iDisk option; see the next bullet). If the
folder is password protected, you’re prompted to
enter that password before you can read (down-
load) any files.
You can also mount a user’s Public folder by
using the Finder’s Connect to Server tool (under
the Go menu or press Ô-K). Use http://
idisk.mac.com/username as the address. If
you use this method, you can bookmark an
iDisk by adding it to your list of favorite servers
(see Figure 42-7). To do so, just enter the con-
nection address in the box and click the plus
sign. Access a Favorite Server by selecting it
from the list and clicking Connect. To quickly go
back to any recently accessed server, click the
clock icon (beside the plus) to view a drop-down
list of your server history.
• Figure 42-7: Bookmark Public iDisk folders by using
Connect to Server.

Other User’s iDisk: To mount someone else’s
iDisk, you need her .Mac username and pass-
word. If you have this, you can control that disk
as if it were your own.
• Figure 42-6: Enter a password here twice to set it for
your Public folder.
Click the key icon in the password prompt to
bring up the Password Assistant. It helps you
come up with good, secure, random pass-
words. You can easily change your iDisk Public
folder password by clicking the Set Password
button in the iDisk panel, after you’ve set the
password once.
6.
Close System Preferences.
You can’t turn off the sharing capability of the
Public iDisk folder. The best you can do is
password-protect it and remember not to
place sensitive information there!
iDisk syncing: Using a local 
copy of your iDisk
While you’re in the iDisk panel, you can decide whether
you want Tiger to maintain a local copy of your iDisk. This
means that your computer keeps a backup of your iDisk on
your Mac. Larry personally finds this to be a little annoying
and completely unnecessary for these reasons:

In all likelihood, your iDisk is a backup of stuff
already on your computer.

If you have this set to automatically update, a good
amount of time is spent by your Mac syncing your
iDisk with the local copy. This is really annoying.

If you have to manually update the copy, you need
to remember to do so.
Feel free to use this feature if you must, but Larry turned it
off almost immediately and hasn’t missed it since. That
being said, if you’re on a slow Internet connection and you
use the iDisk for storage, you can drop things in your local
copy of the iDisk and then update the online version the
next time you connect.

Synchronizing Data with .Mac
329
Synchronizing Data with .Mac
One benefit of having a .Mac account is that it pro-
vides you with an offsite location to store some of
your most important information. But .Mac does
more than just that: It even synchronizes certain
types of data, so that any changes in the data can be
harmoniously updated elsewhere. Synchronization
provides three really keen benefits:

A backup of your valuable data

The ability to use these items on multiple 
computers

Online access to your bookmarks and Webmail
contacts 
In Mac OS X.3 (Panther), you can synchronize
data with your .Mac account by using the iSync
application. In Tiger, synchronization works
from within the .Mac System Preferences panel.
After you synchronize your data from one Mac (com-
puter A) to your .Mac account, you can then update
the data on a second Mac (computer B) by using 
the same .Mac account. This is great if you’ve just
acquired a new computer or you regularly use two dif-
ferent Macs. Furthermore, by synchronizing through
.Mac, changes made to your data on one computer
(say, a person’s e-mail address in Address Book) can
be updated on the second computer without the risk
of losing other important information (like all the
other Address Book data). For this to work, you need
to log in to the same .Mac account on both computers
(by using the .Mac section of System Preferences).
Using .Mac’s synchronization feature can guar-
antee that you always have the most up-to-
date version of your Address Book, Safari
bookmarks, and iCal data on the computer
that you’re using.
To use .Mac synchronization across two computers,
follow these steps on both computers:
1.
Open the .Mac System Preferences panel.
2.
Set your .Mac username and password, if you
haven’t already (see Figure 42-8).
• Figure 42-8: Tell the .Mac System Preferences panel what
your username and password are to enable
access.
3.
Click the Sync tab.
4.
On the Sync tab, select the Synchronize with
.Mac check box and select an option from the
drop-down list (see Figure 42-9).
• Figure 42-9: You can set .Mac synchronization to be
automatically scheduled or a manual
process.

330
If the synchronization process encounters any
problems, it tells you what you can do. Usually,
when a data conflict occurs, you can either
 Replace one set of data.
 Merge the two data sets. (This is the safest
route.)
.Mac is kind enough to remind you in the
Advanced pane which computers have syn-
chronized their data and when. You can also
“forget” a computer (like one you got rid of)
by selecting it from the Registered Computers
box and then clicking the Unregister button.
(See Figure 42-11.)
• Figure 42-11: Manage your synced computers in the
Advanced panel.
5.
Select the check box next to any data type you
want synchronized.
Here is where you select what information you
want to be synchronized, choosing from Safari
Bookmarks, Address Book Contacts, and iCal
Calendars, Keychains, Mail Accounts, and so
forth. If you don’t use any of these, you don’t
need to synchronize them.
6.
Click the Sync Now button.
The first time you run the application, it takes a
little time. You know it’s completed when it
shows a Last Sync date and time on the left side
(see Figure 42-10).
• Figure 42-10: The .Mac panel shows the last time
synchronization occurred.
By selecting the Show Status in the Menu Bar
check box, a sync icon appears on your menu
bar. By clicking it, you can quickly synchronize
your data without going through the System
Preferences area.

iTunes: Rockin’ in
the (Partially)
Free World
O
f the many free applications that Apple has included with its oper-
ating system, iTunes is the shining star. The first of the iLife prod-
ucts, iTunes has become so popular that even Windows users now
have it. (Who would’ve thunk it?) All iTunes does is manage and play
music, but that’s a pretty useful thing. If you’ve never used iTunes before,
this technique shows you the fastest ways to use the application. If
you’re a seasoned iTunes veteran, you’re still bound to discover many
new, efficient techniques.
This technique begins with the most critical preferences settings and
how to adjust the iTunes window itself. Afterwards, you see how to man-
age your music collection. Finally, we cover how to spend your life’s sav-
ings at the iTunes Music Store.
Also see Technique 47, which specifically discusses burning CDs from
iTunes, as well as Technique 39, which covers using iTunes with
Bonjour.
Tweaking Your Preferences
After you get iTunes up and running, you should immediately customize
your preferences to make it work exactly as you’d like it to. If you used
the Setup Assistant, many settings already are determined. Our best
advice for tweaking iTunes follows. We take you step by step through the
preferences panels, omitting only the cosmetic issues:
1.
Open the iTunes preferences by pressing Ô-, (comma) or choosing
iTunes➪Preferences.
2.
In the On CD Insert drop-down list box of the General panel (as
shown in Figure 43-1), choose from four options of what iTunes
should do when you insert a CD:
 Show the songs on the CD.
 Begin playing the CD.

 Show Genre When Browsing
 Group Compilations When Browsing
 Show Links to Music Store
The Show Links to Music Store option puts a
little arrow within a circle next to songs and
artist names within the Library and your
playlists. Clicking any of these circles takes you
to the iTunes Music Store page for that artist.
If you Option-click these circles, iTunes takes
you to the Browse page for that artist within
your own Library. This is a quick way to find,
for example, all the Ani DiFranco songs you
have in your collection.
If you don’t use any of these, by all means dis-
able them, saving yourself some screen space.
For example, if you don’t have a high-speed
Internet connection, you probably won’t use the
radio, so why bother showing it?
The General panel also lets you choose whether
iTunes should automatically check for updates.
If you regularly update your software with
Tiger’s Software Update tool (see Technique 51),
you can update iTunes from it, meaning that
you don’t need iTunes to update itself.
4.
Click the Audio icon at the top and select the
Sound Check check box (see Figure 43-2).
This setting ensures that iTunes automatically
adjusts the song volume so that it maintains a
consistent level. Opting for this saves you the
hassle of constantly adjusting the volume.
If you don’t use AirTunes, disable the Look for
remote speakers connected with AirTunes
check box. No reason your Mac should look
for something you don’t have, right? On the
other hand, if you travel with a laptop, you
might be able to tie into a friend’s AirTunes.
 Import the songs from the CD (copy them to
your music collection).
 Import the songs from the CD and then eject
the disc.
You most often want to leave this on the Show
Songs setting. That being said, if you’re about to
rip your entire music collection onto your com-
puter, set iTunes to import the songs and eject
the CD to facilitate the process.
You can also set the Finder to automatically
open audio CDs in iTunes. See Technique 47
for instructions.

• Figure 43-2: Use the Audio panel to provide a consistent
listening experience.
5.
Click the Importing icon at the top (see Figure
43-3) and set your import configurations.
These values are critical if you import a lot of
music from CDs. The Import Using drop-down
list affects how large the files are and where you
can play them. The Setting drop-down list also
affects how large the files are and how good they
sound. For more on these settings, see the side-
bar “A word on music formats,” elsewhere in this
chapter. Finally, the Create File Names with Track
Number check box dictates whether CD track
numbers are used in filenames.
A cool feature of iTunes is the ability to look 
up CD and song names online. However, you
don’t necessarily need to be connected to the
Internet to use this. If you import a CD, you can
look up the songs later. The next time you’re
online, select the entire imported CD and then
choose Advanced➪Get CD Track Names.

Click the Sharing icon at the top (see Figure
43-4) and decide whether you’re a borrower, a
lender, or both.

Click the Advanced icon (see Figure 43-6).
Here, you can
• Figure 43-6: Use the Advanced panel to dictate whether
iTunes manages your music files.
 Use the Change button to tinker with the
Music folder location.
If you move your music files from one drive to
another or want to use iTunes on a different
music collection, change the Music folder loca-
tion on the Advanced preferences panel.
 Set the Streaming Buffer Size to Large. (You
really should.)
 Select the Keep iTunes Music Folder
Organized check box. (Trust the app.)
There are two schools of thought when it
comes to letting iTunes manage your music
files. If you don’t want to think about this
process at all, let iTunes do the work and don’t
go meddling in the Music folder yourself. On
the other hand, if you like a more hands-on
approach, turn off the Keep iTunes Music
Folder Organized option and you’ll never have
your files rearranged just because you made
some edits to a file in the iTunes application
(like changing a song or album name).
The Sharing panel has two main settings:
 Look for Shared Music controls whether
iTunes should look for other music collections
on your network. If your iTunes finds other peo-
ple’s music collections, they appear as a blue-
colored playlist in the left column. You can then
access any of those songs — and potentially
the playlists — that the user created.
You can’t change the information of a song 
on another user’s computer, alter a rating,
increase the play count, or copy songs to your
computer. If a particular song was purchased
through the iTunes Music Store, you need that
user’s access information to play it.
 Share My Music determines whether you let
others listen to your iTunes. If you decide to
share your music — and you really ought to,
to be nice — you can decide whether to share
the entire library or just specific playlists
(and therefore, specific songs). While you’re
at it, give your share a descriptive name and
password-protect it if you want to make sure
that only friends tune in. After you turn on
this feature and click OK, you’re given the
Sharing Music Is for Personal Use Only
prompt (as shown in Figure 43-5) where you
should select the Do Not Show This Message
Again check box.
• Figure 43-5: Yes, yes. Stealing music is bad. We get it!

iTunes do the work.)
You can override the iTunes setting that copies
music to your folder when added to your

when you drag a song into iTunes. That way,
you can listen to a track with iTunes without
making it part of your permanent collection.

If you have an iPod, click the iPod icon (see
Figure 43-7).
• Figure 43-7: Adjust how iTunes and Tiger work with your

it best works with your iPod.
If you have an iPod that can hold your entire
iTunes collection, opt for Automatically
Update All Songs and Playlists. If you have to
be particular about what goes on your iPod,
choose either the manual option or establish
particular playlists that are synchronized with
your iPod.
 On the General tab, establish how Tiger
should recognize your iPod.
The first choice is to open iTunes when your
iPod is attached. The second choice (Enable
Disk Use) lets you see the iPod on your
Desktop so that you can store other data
there.

After you tweak all your settings, click OK.

Enjoy iTunes!
A word on music formats
Before you import music into iTunes and onto your com-
puter, you have to make a few decisions. These decisions
affect the size that each file takes up on your computer and
the sound quality that it provides. Note that there’s gener-
ally a direct relationship between the two: the higher the
quality, the larger the file size. All the important sound set-
tings can be made using the two drop-down lists on the
Importing preferences panel.
iTunes supports multiple audio formats:

AAC: AAC is the default setting for iTunes. It provides
a better quality than MP3 at a smaller file size. The
only drawback to AAC is that not all computers or
players can recognize the format. If you play your
music as MP3s in a CD player or don’t use an iPod as
your portable device, avoid this format until it’s better
supported.

AIFF: AIFF is an uncompressed standard format for
sound files on the Macintosh. It provides great quality
but at a high price in terms of disk space. A CD is in
AIFF format normally, taking up around 700MB (as
opposed to 70MB in MP3 format).

Apple Lossless: Relatively new to iTunes is the Apple
Lossless format. This format provides a sound quality
rivaling AIFF but at around half the disk space. If you
want to keep audio files in a pure form, this is a good
choice, but your music collection requires a ton of disk
space and it limits how many songs can be put onto
your iPod (and only newer iPods support this format).

• Figure 43-8: Both the full-screen and optimal versions of
iTunes look more or less like this.
• Figure 43-9: Use the minimized version of iTunes to
display the bare necessities.
Within the minimized version, you can still see
the song name and time. Click the song name
to rotate among song, artist, and album. Click
the time to rotate among song length, how
much of the song has been played, and how
much is remaining. Click the small circle on
the right to switch between the display and
the equalizer. If multiple tasks are going on
(like importing a CD or copying music to an
iPod), clicking this circle cycles through that
information as well.

The really small version: If you’re in the mini-
mized version, you can make it smaller by resizing
the window, using the lower right-hand corner.
Figure 43-10 shows the really small version.

MP3: MP3 is the format that started the whole digital
music boom. It turned music into files one-tenth of
their normal size without significantly sacrificing sound
quality. Although AAC is better quality at about the
same file size, MP3 is a more universal format still.

WAV: WAV is the Microsoft version of AIFF. Yuck!
iTunes lets you adjust some of the specific audio settings by
choosing Custom from the Setting drop-down list. You find
three drop-down lists for configuration:

The Stereo Bit Rate affects both your file size and the
sound quality.
The higher the bit rate, the higher the quality and the
bigger the file. The 128 Kbps is the default setting,
but you might want to up this some, particularly if
you’re likely to burn audio CDs from your iTunes col-
lection, in which case there will be potentially notice-
able quality loss. Larry normally opts for a setting of
192 Kbps, which is a nice compromise between qual-
ity and file size.

Leave both the Sample Rate and Channels settings on
Auto. There’s no need to mess with these.
Redecorating the iTunes
Window
Before doing your thing with iTunes, you ought to
customize the iTunes window. Start with which ver-
sion of the window you’d like to see:

The full-screen version: You can see this version
in Figure 43-8.

The optimal version: To view the full iTunes
screen optimally (so that it takes up as much
space as needed or as it can), Option-click the
green button in the upper-left corner of the 
window.

The minimized version: Switch to this format by
clicking the green button. Click the green button
again to go back to the full-screen version. You
can see this version in Figure 43-9.

• Figure 43-10: If you want to control iTunes and nothing
more, use this window version.
Within the full-screen version, you can do a lot to
customize the window.
1.
Bring up the View Options window (as shown
in Figure 43-11) by choosing Ô-J or choosing
Edit➪View Options.
• Figure 43-11: Customize the iTunes window like you
would any window in the Finder.
2.

to view.
3.
Deselect the check boxes for every column that
you don’t need (or don’t need regularly).
Yes, we’re talking about the Beats Per Minute 
column.
The only column that you can’t remove or
even move is the Song Name. It isn’t even
listed in the View Options window (refer to
Figure 43-11).
4.
Click OK to close the View Options window.
5.
In the iTunes window, click and drag the col-
umn names to rearrange them.
6.
Control-click any column heading to bring up
its contextual menu (see Figure 43-12).
• Figure 43-12: Use contextual menus in iTunes to work

7.
Choose Auto Size All Columns to adjust the col-
umn widths automatically.
You can also add and remove columns via the
contextual menu if you don’t feel like using
the View Options prompt.
Managing Your Music
After you import or purchase a slew of music, you
need to be able to manage and navigate through it
with ease. In this section, we cover the best tech-
niques, without any of the beginner step-by-step
stuff you’ve probably already figured out.

Technique 43: iTunes: Rockin’ in the (Partially) Free World

• Figure 43-13: The Browse button appears at the top of
the iTunes window.

Choose a category from the Search drop-down
list to narrow your search before you enter your
keywords (see Figure 43-14).
The Search box in iTunes immediately begins
searching as soon as you begin typing. This is
both handy and a pain. If you know you’re
searching specifically for an artist or a song,
select a category first, and then enter your 
keywords.
• Figure 43-14: Fine-tune a search by clicking the magnifying
glass icon.
If you use multiple Macs and you’re annoyed
by never having the right song on the right
Mac, check out syncOtunes (http://
homepage.mac.com/oligrob/syncOtunes/
syncOtunes.html, donationware). This little app
synchronizes your collections, saving you oodles
of time comparing lists and manually import-
ing tracks. Similarly, hundreds of AppleScripts
are available at Doug’s AppleScripts for iTunes
(www.malcolmadams.com/itunes/index.php)
that perform various useful tasks.
Editing song information
You can edit information for individual songs in many
ways:

Select a song and press Ô-I to bring up the Get
Info panel.

Click within any one field to change just that field.

Select multiple songs and press Ô-I to edit infor-
mation for several songs at once.
With this method, you only want to tweak broad
factors, like the artist name, the year of release,
the album name, and the genre.
If you keep your music organized, editing
songs becomes really quick thanks to iTunes’
AutoFill feature. From your existing library of
artists, albums, and genres, iTunes guesses what
you’re typing in these fields and fills it in for you.
Searching for tracks
iTunes supports two methods for finding specific
songs: browsing and searching. Our three best tips
for finding a song or artist are

Click the Browse button (it looks like an eye, in
the upper-right corner) or press Ô-B to open and
close the browsing panels (see Figure 43-13).
Use the Browse tool to browse by artist or
album. If you enable Show Genre when
browsing in the General preferences panel,
you can also browse by genre.

Managing Your Music
341

Select a playlist in the left column to browse or
search within it.
By default, the Search and Browse tools look
through an entire collection, but you can limit
both of these by selecting a playlist and then
searching or browsing.
Creating playlists
You can save yourself a lot of time, or just kill some
time, by playing around with playlists. Here are some
of the cool things that we’ve come to appreciate:

Press Ô-Delete to remove a song or playlist with-
out getting the confirmation dialog. (Deleting a
song from a playlist doesn’t remove it from your
collection; to do that, remove a song from the
Library list.)

Create a new playlist by
 Selecting a bunch of songs and then Shift-
clicking the Add button.
 Selecting a bunch of songs and dragging them
into a blank area in the Source column.
 Selecting a bunch of songs and pressing 
Ô-Shift-N.
 Selecting a bunch of songs and choosing
File➪New Playlist from Selection.

Option-click the Add button to create a Smart
Playlist. Standard playlists have set songs in
them (selected by dragging the song from the
Library into the playlist). Smart Playlists let you
set parameters (such as the artist name, the year
the song was released, your ranking of the song,
the genre, and more). iTunes then creates a
playlist that matches your criteria. You can fur-
ther limit your Smart Playlist to a certain length,
like eight hours of total music (say, if you’re tak-
ing an eight-hour road trip).
If you’re trying to work between multiple
playlists or between a playlist and your
Library, use multiple iTunes windows. Just
double-click the space to the right of a
playlist’s name to open that playlist in its own
window. Then you can easily drag files from
the one window to the other.
Controlling iTunes
If you frequently sit at your computer while listening
to iTunes, you quickly come to realize how often you
feel compelled to skip a song, remind yourself who
the artist is, or rate an unrated track (if you’re
addicted to the ratings). Constantly switching from
the application you’re in over to iTunes to perform
one menial task is a complete waste of time. So to
put those precious moments back into your day, use
a utility that lets you control iTunes without leaving
the application you’re using:

iTunes: One way to gain easy, constant control
over iTunes is to use the minimized or really
small version of the iTunes window. If you select
the check box for the Keep Mini Player on top of
all other windows option in the Advanced prefer-
ences panel, then the iTunes player always is 
visible. Because the Mini Player doesn’t take up
much screen space, it shouldn’t interfere, even in
front of the Web page you’re viewing or the Word
document you’re editing.

SizzlingKeys (http://yellowmug.com/sk4it,
free): SizzlingKeys is Larry’s personal favorite.
Not only is it free (mmm . . . free), it’s highly cus-
tomizable. One feature is that it can briefly dis-
play a box when each new track starts (see
Figure 43-15), letting you know what’s coming.
You can also skip, repeat, and rate songs by
using easy-to-remember keyboard controls.
• Figure 43-15: SizzlingKeys can present information on
the currently playing track.

• Figure 43-16: Adjust the iTunes Music Store settings in
the preferences panel.

If you’re on a slow network connection (read:
modem), select the Load Complete Preview
Before Playing check box to improve your pre-
view quality.
Within the iTMS itself (see Figure 43-17), here are a few
shortcuts with which you should familiarize yourself
(so that you can spend more time buying). These are

Ô-[ (opening bracket): This shortcut takes you
back a page.

Ô-] (closing bracket): This shortcut takes you
forward a page.
The Ô-[ and Ô-] shortcuts also work to move
forward and back among the panels of the
Preferences and Get Info panels. It’s an almost
universal Mac shortcut (for Apple applications,
at least).

Click the house icon: This takes you to the iTMS
main (home) page.

Click the Browse button (the eye): This lets you
browse the entire iTMS by genre, artist, or album.

Open the Search box drop-down list: This lets
you limit the scope of your search.

Girc (http://homepage.mac.com/the_macman/
hazard/girc.html, free): Girc is more than just
an obscure name, it’s also a floating toolbar for
controlling iTunes. It’s a wee little guy so it won’t
interfere with other applications.
Blowing Your Paycheck at the
iTunes Music Store
The iTunes Music Store looks like it just might be the
most popular (legal) music downloading software
around. It was an immediate hit with Mac users, and
even our lesser Windows brethren can finally under-
stand exactly the kind of things that we’ve been
crowing about for years: 50 percent innovation, and
50 percent really, really cool.
To use the iTunes Music Store (we just call it the
iTMS for short), you need either an Apple ID or a
.Mac account. First, click the Music Store option in
the Source column. Then click the Sign In button
next to Account (on the far right of the screen) and
you’re taken through these steps that follow. If you
have a .Mac account, Apple most likely already has
your credit card, saving you a step (for better or for
worse).
Within the preferences panel, click the Store icon to
adjust a few of its preferences (see Figure 43-16).
This is what you need to know:

If you don’t want to be tempted, deselect the
Show iTunes Music Store check box.

If you’re of the instant gratification type, opt for
1-Click shopping.

If you prefer larger debits on your credit card, go
with the Shopping Cart.
If you use the iTMS shopping cart, the Music
Store playlist becomes an expandable folder
that shows both your purchased music and
your shopping cart. You can add items to the
shopping cart over multiple sessions and buy
them all when that paycheck comes in.

You can drag songs from the iTunes Music Store into
a playlist. This is a great trick you can use to keep a
list of what songs or albums you’re thinking of pur-
chasing. Just:
1.
Create a new playlist with a meaningful name
(like iTunes Music Wishlist).
If you start your playlist name with a special
character, like • (created by Option-8), it
appears at the top of your list of playlists, right
after the list of Smart Playlists.
2.
While you’re in the iTunes Music Store, book-
mark any song by dragging it into your playlist.
3.
Click your playlist to view all the songs in your
wishlist (see Figure 43-18).

Working with iPhoto
I
f you have a digital camera and you’re not using iPhoto already, you’re
really missing out. iPhoto is a simple, yet effective, application for
managing your digital photographs. In this technique, we shy away
from the basics (such as importing and viewing images), instead focusing
on the best and quickest ways to do specific things within the applica-
tion. Then we address your digital library: what to do with all those
images you’ve imported over the years. Finally, we demonstrate a couple
techniques for posting your images as an online, viewable catalog.
iPhoto used to be a free download, available to all Mac users. The
only way to get iPhoto now is to either buy the iLife package ($79) or
a new Mac. (iLifes comes installed on new Macs.) In this technique,
we use iPhoto 5, so some of the features might not be available to
you if you’re using an older version of the application. (Versions 4
and 5 both brought significant new features to the application.)
Best iPhoto Practices
The basics of using iPhoto are easy to master, but you can do a number
of little things to use the application more productively. We go through
these in somewhat random order.
Preferences
Some of the settings in the iPhoto’s General preferences panel affect your
productivity, such as

• Figure 44-1: iPhoto’s General preferences panel.
Whatever you decide to do with the double-
click setting, click the Select Application but-
ton to choose your external editor, such as
Photoshop Elements. After you do so, you can
just Control-click an image to bring up a con-
textual menu that offers you the option of
editing the image in your external editor (see
Figure 44-2).

Rotate: Different cameras display rotated images
in different directions (clockwise versus counter-
clockwise). Change your rotate button to match
your camera so you can easily adjust how the
image is displayed.
If your Rotate setting works correctly for you
most of the time but you need to rotate an
image the other way on occasion, hold down
the Option button while clicking Rotate within
the main iPhoto window.

Mail: One of the nice features in iPhoto is the
ease in which you can e-mail a picture to some-
one. For this feature to work, however, iPhoto
must know what mail application you use.
Establish that here, select an image in the main
iPhoto window, and then click the Email icon to
be prompted (see Figure 44-3) for how the photo
should be formatted when you send it.
• Figure 44-2: iPhoto’s contextual menu offers quick access
to frequently used features.
• Figure 44-3: When e-mailing a picture, you can adjust the
image’s size and information in iPhoto first.

Technique 44: Working with iPhoto
346
Creating a Smart Album
As of version 4, iPhoto has the ability to create
Smart Albums. Just like Smart Folders in the Finder
or Smart Playlists in iTunes, to create a Smart Album
you generate a list of criteria and iPhoto populates
that album with matching images. Furthermore,
iPhoto dynamically updates the contents of your
Smart Albums as your digital library changes. To 
create a Smart Album:
1.
Open iPhoto.
2.
Choose File➪New Smart Album.
3.
In the corresponding prompt (see Figure 44-4),
give the album an appropriate name.
• Figure 44-4: The New Smart Album prompt.
4.
Use the menus to define the first criterion.
Your criteria can be based upon a number of fac-
tors, such as
 Album name (photos from particular albums
can be used in a Smart Album)
 Text or comments
 Date (specific dates or even ranges)
 Filename
 Keyword
 Rating
 Roll name
 Image Title
For each factor, which option you select in the
first menu dictates what other menus or prompts
are given.
Creating a new Photo Album quickly
The iPhoto application uses Photo Albums to help
you organize your digital images. Even though all
your images are primarily stored in the Photo
Library — the first item listed in the left column —
subsets can be grouped into albums, organized
based upon theme, location, and so forth. (Think of
Photo Albums as the equivalent of the iTunes
playlist.) You can create a new Photo Album by
choosing New Album from the File menu and then
dragging all your images into this new folder, but
this method is faster:
1.
Open iPhoto.
2.
Select Library in the left column to view all
your images.
If you want to create a new Photo Album by
using the last imported group of photos, begin
by clicking the Last Roll icon instead. You can
even set, using the preferences panel, how
many previous rolls to list in the Source column.
3.
Ô-click images to select the images for the
Photo Album.
4.
Drag these images into the blank area in the
left column, below the Trash.
You see a green plus circle appear, along with the
number of images being moved in a red circle.
5.
The new album (called untitled album)
appears with the photos in it.
6.
Double-click the new album’s name to change it.
7.
Delete the default name, type a new one, and
you’re done!
You can also create a new album by dragging
a folder of images from the Finder into the
Source list column. The album is created with
the same name as the folder, and all the
images are imported automatically.

Working with Your Digital Library
347
For the Smart Albums to be most effective,
you have to add descriptive data to your
images as you would to songs in iTunes. This
includes adding descriptive titles, keywords,
and comments, as well as rating images.
5.
To add another criterion, click the plus sign
and repeat Step 4.
You can add as many criteria as necessary.
6.
If you have multiple criteria, select either All or
Any from the Match drop-down list.
Selecting All makes the criteria exclusive, mean-
ing that every criteria must be matched. This
should decrease the number of photographs in
your album. Selecting Any makes the criteria
inclusive, increasing the number of photographs
in the album.
7.
Click OK.
Within the General preferences panel, you can
enable two other Smart-like albums. One dis-
plays the last X number of rolls — a roll is a
group of images imported at the same time —
and the other displays the images taken and
imported over the past Y number of months.
Editing images with ease
After you import your images, you might want to
tweak them. You can accomplish this by using
iPhoto’s basic tools or with an external application,
such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Elements, or the
open source The GIMP. We don’t have space in this
book to discuss basic editing techniques, but here
are our best editing-related tips:

Set your preferences for a default action when
you double-click (refer to Figure 44-1); other-
wise, use the contextual menu (refer to Figure
44-2). If you want to use iPhoto for your editing,
make this explicit in your preferences (by select-
ing Opens in Edit View under Double-Click). If
you’d rather use another application, set the
double-click to launch that (by using the Select
button after selecting Opens in Other). In either
case, when you want to edit an image by using
something other than the default tool, Control-
click to see your options.

After you edit a photo, you can undo the
effects by selecting Revert to Original from the
contextual menu that appears when you
Control-click an image. This feature works even
after you’ve quit and returned to iPhoto because
iPhoto doesn’t let you make alterations to the
original photo. Instead, it creates a copy of the
image and makes changes to it.
If your camera can take pictures in the RAW
format, you can use them in iPhoto 5. With
the RAW format, the camera records a more
literal version of the image (in layman’s terms).
If you really know what you’re doing when it
comes to editing images, you can use iPhoto 5
to adjust the exposure, color saturation, and
the like.
Working with Your 
Digital Library
If you take a lot of digital photographs, your hard
drive will quickly fill up with images. This isn’t ideal
for your computer and, more annoyingly, will bog
down iPhoto every time you use it. From the experi-
ence of importing and managing several thousand
photos (no, we aren’t making that up), here’s our
best timesaving advice for importing, managing, and
storing your digital photographs.
Importing images
One of the ways in which iPhoto has grown is its
streamlined importing capability. You can now hook
up your camera to your Mac (depending upon the
camera and the Mac) and import your images
directly into iPhoto.

Technique 44: Working with iPhoto
348
1.
Make sure that you can view most of the images
and you can see the orientation clearly.
Use the Zoom slider to present the images at an
appropriate size.
2.
Select all the images that need to be rotated
clockwise.
You can select multiple images by Ô-clicking.
3.
Click the Rotate button.
Remember to use the iPhoto Preferences to set
the default rotation direction.
4.
Select all the images that need to be rotated
counterclockwise.
5.
Hold down Option while clicking Rotate.
You can easily edit the information — the title,
date, and comments — for a group of images
using the Photos➪Batch Change option.
After an image is in iPhoto, you can

Drag it into Photoshop or another application for
editing.

Click the Desktop button to set the selected
image as your Desktop (see Figure 44-5).
• Figure 44-5: Use the tools in the bottom bar to quickly
do common tasks with an image.
You can import an image from a disc (instead
of a camera) by dragging the folder containing
the images into the photo viewing area of
iPhoto. The application will use the folder’s
name as the film roll name. If your folder is
nested with subfolders, each subfolder becomes
its own film roll.
The process of importing images is straightforward
enough, but be aware of a few tips:

Let iPhoto erase the camera contents after each
transfer. As Marc has painfully discovered, if you
use your camera’s media card for photos and
movies (which many cameras are now capable
of), you can easily forget the movies and acciden-
tally delete them by manually reformatting the
media. By letting iPhoto take care of deletions,
your photos will be deleted, but everything else
will remain untouched. Just select the Erase
Camera Contents after Transfer check box before
clicking the Import button (under the Import tab).

Use a media reader adapter instead of a direct
connection to your camera. For very little
money — $10 to $20 — you can purchase a
media adapter so that you can access your vir-
tual “rolls of film” without using your camera. In
all likelihood, such a connection would be much,
much faster than the likely USB cable that your
camera uses, particularly if you pick up a
FireWire model. After you mount a media card,
you can import the images by dragging them
from the Finder into iPhoto.

Have iPhoto store your photographs in your
Pictures directory. That’s what it’s there for,
after all. Plus, your images will be backed up with
the rest of your Home directory.
iPhoto 5 can also manage video clips that your
camera records.
Managing your images more efficiently
After downloading a batch of images, you usually
want to rotate the ones in portrait orientation first.
We recommend this timesaving procedure:

Working with Your Digital Library
349

Create a printable book of photographs, with
titles.

E-mail it to a buddy by clicking the Mail icon.
Deleting an image in iPhoto doesn’t actually
delete the image from your hard drive. You
must choose iPhoto➪Empty Trash to formally
remove the photograph (which also deletes
the image from your computer).
How many megapixels are enough?
Today’s digital cameras take images starting at 2 mega-pixels
and easily going up to 5 or 6 megapixels, even for consumer-
level cameras. But how many megapixels do you really need
to use? All digital cameras let you adjust the size (in number
of pixels) and quality (based upon format and compression)
of the pictures that they take. Choosing a lower image size
has many benefits:

You can fit more images on whatever media your
camera uses.

You use far less hard drive space.

It doesn’t slow down iPhoto the way choosing larger
images does.

You get smaller file sizes, which makes placing images
on the Web or e-mailing them easier.
Use the maximum number of pixels only if you plan on
printing the images in sizes larger than 5 x 7 inches. Images
with small file sizes result in poor image quality in a print that
size.
Our advice is to use an image size around 2 to 3 megapix-
els but at the highest image quality. This gives you a high-
enough resolution for editing and lets you use an image as
your Desktop without stretching — but still gives you a very
printable picture.
Storing your images to save space and time
You don’t want to keep all your photographs in
iPhoto at all times for three reasons:

Digital images take up an incredible amount of
hard drive space.

iPhoto’s performance suffers.

Finding images is much harder.
If your Photo Library is getting large (over 600MB),
burn your archived images to a CD to save space:
1.
Select the Library in the Source column to
select the entire photo library.
2.
Click the Information button (which bears an i)
at the bottom of the column.
The Information panel (see Figure 44-6) shows
you how large the selected library is on your
hard drive.
• Figure 44-6: See how much space your collection takes
up by using the Information panel. 
You can archive a subsection of your library by
clicking one of the groupings under Library
(Early Photos, 2002, 2003, and so on).
3.
Select Share➪Burn Disc to archive the library
to a disc.
4.
Insert a blank CD-R.
iPhoto prompts you for one.
5.
Confirm that the images will all fit on a disc
(see Figure 44-7).
If the disc is full, you see the disc icon highlighted
in red, indicating that the images won’t all fit. If
the disc icon is green, you’re okay to continue.

Creating an Online Photo Album
Putting your photos online is really easy if you have
the right software. If you have a .Mac account, you
can put your photos online by following these steps:
1.
Select a photo album in the left column.
2.
Click HomePage (or choose Share➪HomePage).
3.
Edit the page title, picture frame style, and so
forth from the Publish HomePage dialog (see
Figure 44-9).
You can determine what theme your pub-
lished album should use by selecting one from
the theme list on the side of the Publish
HomePage window.
4.
Click the Publish button.
iPhoto uploads all the images, which takes a few
minutes, depending upon your connection
speed and the number and size of the photos
you are publishing. The beauty of this system is
that iPhoto automatically resizes the images to
be more Web-friendly and creates a page of
thumbnails.
• Figure 44-7: If you see a Disc Full message, you can’t
burn all the images onto one disc. 
6.
If all the images won’t fit, select a subset of
images by clicking the different listings in the
Source column (see Figure 44-8).
• Figure 44-8: With a blank disc in your drive, iPhoto will
show how much room will be taken up on it.
7.
After you decide on the files you want to
archive, click the Burn button.
8.
After the CD has been made, delete the photos
from your library.
9.
Insert the CD at any point in time to review the
stored images.

• Figure 44-9: Quickly customize how you want your Web
site to look. 
You can publish only up to 48 images at once
by using these steps. If you have more images
than that in a photo album, break them up
into multiple albums.
5.
When iPhoto is finished, it gives you the URL
for your new site (see Figure 44-10).
• Figure 44-10: You are prompted after iPhoto finishes
uploading your new site.
You can also use the .Mac Slides Publisher tool
to turn your online pictures into a screen saver
for other Mac OS X users.
If you don’t have a .Mac account, you still have
options. Both of these tools generate the Web pages
for you, but you need to have your own Web site in
order to make them public (or be able to host Web
sites on your computer, see Technique 40). After one
of these applications creates the pages, just upload
them to their final destination. (Your ISP — which
will most likely provide a limited amount of free Web
space — or Web hosting company will provide you
with the requisite details.)

Use Image Capture. The Image Capture applica-
tion can also build Web pages for you. After you
connect a camera, open Image Capture. Then
choose Build Web Page from the drop-down list.
The Web pages themselves will be created and
stored in your ~/Pictures folder.

Use My Photo Album (www.x-industries.com/
mpa) or JAlbum (http://jalbum.net). These
free applications can both create the HTML
pages necessary for you to put your albums
online.

Use a commercial tool such as SnapMania
(www.snapmania.com). There are many commer-
cial online photo galleries available. SnapMania
comes to mind because Marc has helped create
it, but you can easily find others by searching
Google.

Save Time By
 Taking simple screen

of Snapz Pro X
Snapping
Screenshots Fast
W
hether you want to show some cool on-screen feature to a
friend, you need to do some debugging work with tech support,
or you’re writing a book, being able to quickly and easily take
shots of your screen is a valuable trick to know. You can always whip out
your camera, take a picture of the screen, have the film developed, and
scan in the photograph, but we think that you’ll prefer the techniques
that we outline here.
We start by going over the built-in system tools that Tiger has to offer:
Screen Capture and Grab. After that, we give special attention to Snapz
Pro X, the granddaddy of screenshot applications. Even if you don’t think
you have a need to capture what’s happening on your Mac, many Mac
users eventually do and reading just the first couple of pages certainly
comes in handy.
Taking Screenshots with Screen Capture
Screen Capture is part of the operating system, which means that it is
available in every application that works with OS X. Screen Capture 
is triggered by several keyboard shortcuts:

To capture the entire screen, press Ô-Shift-3.

To capture part of a screen, press Ô-Shift-4.
The cursor then turns into a crosshairs icon. Click and drag over an
area (see Figure 45-1) to select it. When you release the mouse button,
the image is taken, and you hear a snapshot sound.
Don’t be confused by the Image Capture program found in the
Applications directory. Despite its name, this application doesn’t capture
screenshot images. Its actual role is to import images from a digital
camera. You can also use it to network and share a digital camera or
scanner.
45
Technique

Taking Screenshots with Screen Capture
353
• Figure 45-1: The Screen Capture tool highlights in gray
the area to be captured.
The keyboard shortcuts for image capturing
are listed under Keyboard Shortcuts of the
Keyboard & Mouse System Preferences panel.
You can capture just a window or an object by using
the last method in the preceding list. Alternatively,
follow these steps to get a more precise screenshot:
1.
Press Ô-Shift-4.
Again, the cursor turns into the crosshairs icon.
2.
Press the spacebar.
The cursor turns into a camera icon.
3.
Move the camera cursor over the window or
object that you want to capture.
When you move the cursor over an object, it
becomes highlighted.
4.
After you highlight the window that you want,
click the mouse anywhere on the window or
object to take the screenshot.
You can take screenshots of items in the back-
ground as long as you can see a piece of
them. For example, if you’re in Microsoft Word
and can see a corner of a Finder window, you
can get a screenshot of the whole Finder win-
dow by highlighting and taking a shot of just
the visible portion.
Here are a few facts that you should know when
using this method:

Screen Capture saves the screenshots as PNGs.
No other format options are available. That being
said, you can use the Preview application’s Save
As feature (under File) to covert a PNG to a JPG,
TIFF, PDF, and more.

The screenshots are automatically saved to
your Desktop with such useful names as Picture
1 and Picture 2.

You can’t capture the cursor.

Unlike digital cameras, which normally allow
you to adjust the size of the picture taken in
pixels, you can’t change the resolution of shots
in Screen Capture. You can adjust the size of
your screenshots only by adjusting the resolu-
tion of your monitor.

With the Ô-Shift-4 shortcut, you can toggle back
and forth between a section of the screen and a
window by continuing to press the spacebar.

With the Ô-Shift-4 shortcut, press Escape to
cancel the operation.

If you hold down the Control key while trigger-
ing the screenshot utility (using either Ô-Shift-3
or Ô-Shift-4), the image is sent to the Clipboard
and isn’t saved as a file.
Hold down the Control key to send the cap-
tured image to the Clipboard. Then you can
paste this image into an e-mail, a document,
or an iChat session.
If you want to place an image within the document
you’re working on rather than create an image as a
file on your computer, here’s how:
1.
In your document, place the cursor where you
want the image to go.
2.
Toggle over to the application where you want
to take the screenshot.
3.
Capture the image while holding down the
Control key.
Holding down the Control key copies the image
to the Clipboard. You can use Ô-Control-Shift-3 to
capture the entire screen or Ô-Control-Shift-4 
to capture a section of the screen or an entire
window.
4.
Toggle back to your document.

Technique 45: Snapping Screenshots Fast
354

Capture images in TIFF format. Whereas Screen
Capture takes only PDFs, Grab takes only TIFs.
You can use Preview to export an image in a dif-
ferent format.

Use a more intuitive menu system rather than
keyboard shortcuts.
Grab comes with its own keyboard shortcuts, which
are also duplicated in the Capture menu (see Figure
45-3). These are

Ô-Shift-A: Captures a selection of the screen.

Ô-Shift-W: Captures a window.

Ô-Z: Captures the whole screen.

Ô-Shift-Z: Brings up Timed Screen (see 
Figure 45-4).
• Figure 45-3: Use the Capture menu in lieu of or to
remind you of the keyboard shortcuts.
Timed Screen captures let you take images
while you’re in the process of doing some-
thing. This is the easiest way to capture com-
plex actions, like dragging a document onto
an application’s icon.
• Figure 45-4: Grab can take delayed snapshots.
5.
Press Ô-V to paste the captured image from the
Clipboard into your document.
If you live within the Terminal, you can even
take screen captures while in that application.
To find out how, type screencapture within a
Terminal window. By using different flags, you
can: capture the entire screen or just a window
or selection; capture the cursor or not; choose
the file name of the image; copy the capture to
the clipboard; and more. It’s crazy, just crazy.
Taking Screenshots with Grab
The other Tiger option for taking screen shots is
Grab. Grab is located, appropriately enough, in the
Utilities folder. It has certain benefits over the built-
in Screen Capture tool. With it, you can

Capture the cursor.

Decide what cursor to view.
If you want a cursor in your screen shots, select
the cursor type from Grab’s Preferences panel
(see Figure 45-2).
• Figure 45-2: Use the Preferences panel to tell Grab what
cursor to capture, if any.

Taking Screenshots with Grab
355
After Grab has done its magic, it loads the image as a
new document. This can then be saved as a file any-
where on your computer by pressing Ô-S or select-
ing Save from Grab’s File menu.
In the earlier “Taking Screenshots with Screen
Capture” section of this technique, we discuss how
to capture images and paste them into a document.
If you’re using an application that supports Services
(such as TextEdit or Mail), you can accomplish the
same thing by using the Grab tool as a Service.
Follow these steps:
1.
In your document, place the cursor where you
want the image to go.
2.
Decide what Service to use:
 If you want to capture the whole screen (not
necessarily the current one), use the Screen
Service.
 If you want to capture a part of any screen
(not necessarily the current one), use
Selection.
 If you want to capture the entire screen but
need a few seconds to get yourself organized,
use Timed Screen.
3.
From the application menu, choose the 
appropriate Service from Services➪Grab (see
Figure 45-5).
The Screen Grab prompt appears.
4.
To capture the entire screen, toggle to
whichever view you want to capture and 
then click anywhere outside the prompt (see
Figure 45-6).
To capture a part of the screen, toggle to
whichever screen you want to use and then click
and drag over the area that you want captured
(see Figure 45-7).
You can also click a window once to have it
automatically captured.
If you chose Timed Screen, you have ten seconds
to set up the screen as you want it.
• Figure 45-5: You can use Grab as a Service in applications
that support it.
• Figure 45-6: Follow the instructions to capture the entire
display.
• Figure 45-7: Click and drag to grab a section of the
screen.
5.
Toggle back to your document.
You see the image already inserted into it.

 Movie (video)
4.
If you select Objects in Step 3, click the object
that you want to capture.
5.
If you select Selection in Step 3, click and drag
to select an area to capture.
If you have Snapz Pro X set to let you choose a
filename (under Capture Options in the main
panel), you’re prompted for the file’s name.
6.
Just type in the desired name and press Return.
You hear Snapz Pro X making some shutterbug
sounds and the newly taken picture is saved in
the target directory (the Desktop or your
Pictures folder).
If you change your mind about taking a screen
capture, press Escape to exit Snapz Pro X (or
press Escape twice if you’re already at the file-
name prompt).
If you’re already using Snapz Pro X, you can use
plenty of timesaving techniques:

In the Snapz Pro X Extras folder are three
AppleScripts that can automate the utility.

You can automatically resize your images as you
take them. To do so, use the scale menu found in
the Object Settings prompt (see Figure 45-8).

After invoking Snapz Pro X by pressing the key-
board shortcut, set the default filename for the
image from the Preferences tab and disable
Choose File Name on the main tab.
• Figure 45-8: Resize your images with Snapz Pro X.
Using Snapz Pro X
Snapz Pro X from Ambrosia Software (www.
ambrosiasw.com, $29) has long been the preferred
screenshot utility for Mac writers and developers. In
part, this is because there were no good alternatives
(like Grab) prior to OS X. If you need to do any seri-
ous amount of image capturing, Snapz Pro X is defi-
nitely the way to go. Here’s what it can do for you:

Take images in many formats (JPG, GIF, PNG,
TIFF, BMP, PICT, PDF, and Photoshop)

Resize images

Perform color conversions (say from color to
black and white)

Create borders for your images

Capture or create video (if you purchase the $69
version)
If you haven’t used Snapz Pro X before, here is all
you need to do to take a quick screen capture:
1.
Open the application by double-clicking its
icon (assuming you’ve installed it).
Snapz Pro X loads and then runs in the back-
ground, hidden from you until you press the
proper keyboard shortcut. Alternatively you can
have Snapz Pro X automatically load when you
log in. Simply add it to your Login Items list (see
Technique 2).
2.
Press Ô-Shift-3 to bring up the Snapz Pro X
interface.
This is the default keyboard shortcut — overriding
Screen Capture — and it can be changed using
Snapz Pro X’s Preference.
3.
Click one of the buttons across the top to
choose your capture type.
Your options are
 Screen (the whole screen)
 Objects (documents, windows, and such)

Using Snapz Pro X
357
If you need to make a series of numbered
images like Steps 001.tiff, Steps 002.
tiff, and so on, let Snapz Pro X do the work
for you. Set the Prefix for the filenames under
the File Naming Settings section of the
Preferences tab (for example, Steps). Each
screen capture is named starting with that pre-
fix and numbered sequentially.

Use the File Creator drop-down list to associate
the taken image with a particular application.

Have Snapz Pro X automatically change the col-
oring of the image (see Figure 45-9).

Hold down the Control key to zoom in where the
cursor is currently pointing (when using the
Objects or Selection options).
• Figure 45-9: Use the Color Change menu to take, for
example, black and white images.

Change the modifier keys to have Snapz Pro X
launch by using a different key combination than
the default.

When capturing objects, use the Shift key to add
or subtract objects to the selection.

Staying on Schedule
with iCal
i
Cal is Apple’s nice little scheduling application that, along with the
Address Book, pretty much means that you never need to buy any
Personal Information Management (PIM) software again. Not only does
iCal have all the features that you would ever use, but it also uses a stan-
dard format that makes it compatible with alternative software. This is a
great asset if you share calendars with other users who might (or might
not) also be using a Mac.
In this technique, you find out the fundamental keyboard shortcuts and
some best-usage techniques. Then you see how to easily subscribe to
someone else’s calendar and publish your own calendars online. After
that, pick up some cool tips and tricks for using iCal. But first, we make
sure that you know how to create and use a basic Calendar.
Creating Calendars and Events
Everything in iCal relies upon one basic thing: a Calendar, which is more
than just a collection of hours, days, weeks, and months. A Calendar is a
collection of data — starting with hours and days, plus events (scheduled
occurrences) and To-Do list items — grouped into subjects. 
iCal comes with two Calendars from the start:

Home (meant to record your personal happenings)

Work (Meant to record work happenings)
You can add other Calendars by either

Subscribing to special calendars (see “Subscribing and Publishing”),
like U.S. holidays, the schedule of Chicago Bulls games, and listings of
movie releases

46
Technique

Creating Calendars and Events
359
Here are the benefits of this multi-calendar structure:

Search and browse Calendars by subject (such
as work, home, or school).

Share specific Calendars with others. (Share a
work Calendar but not your personal one.)

Color-code your life to make managing your
schedule easier.
You can create specific events and whole Calendars.
Creating events
An event is just a scheduled thing, like a meeting or
a birthday or a trip. It’s something you put on your
calendar for a specific day and/or time. Follow these
steps to create a new event:
1.
Select a Calendar by clicking its name in the
Calendars window.
Choose which Calendar the event goes in
before it can be added. If an appropriate
Calendar doesn’t yet exist, use the steps later
in this technique to add one.
2.
Double-click the event’s day (or the day it starts)
to add the event.
The easiest way to add an event is to double-
click the day of the event. 
Be sure to click underneath the day’s number if
you want to add a new event. Clicking the num-
ber itself displays the day’s events without
adding a new event.
3.
Click the i in the lower-right corner of the iCal
window to bring up the Info panel (if it isn’t
already visible).
4.
Enter the event’s information by clicking the
fields in the Info panel and typing the proper
values (see Figure 46-1).
Adding and editing events from the Info panel is
very easy. Just click a field (like the event name
or date), type in the new values, and press
Return. Select the All-Day check box to schedule
the event for the entire day or for several days.
• Figure 46-1: The Info panel, showing the details for a
specific event.
Creating Calendars
To create a Calendar, just do this:
1.
Choose File➪New Calendar.
A new Calendar appears in the Calendars list in
the upper-left column of the iCal window (see
Figure 46-2).
• Figure 46-2: The new Calendar appears at the bottom of
the Calendars window.
2.
Type the new Calendar’s name.
After you create a new Calendar, it’s named
Untitled by default but is already highlighted.
Just begin typing to rename the Calendar.
3.
Press Return to finish the renaming.
To hide any Calendar, clear the check box next to
its name.

iCal’s Main Keyboard Shortcuts
iCal, like most applications, has oodles of keyboard
shortcuts available. Rather than provide an 
un-learnable list of them all, here are the most useful
for performing common tasks:

Ô-T: Moves to today.

Ô-Shift-T: Gives you the Go to Date prompt (as
shown in Figure 46-4).
• Figure 46-4: Use this prompt to jump to another date.

Ô-N: Creates a new event (Calendar entry).

Ô-K: Creates a new To-Do item.

Ô-1: Switches to the Day view.

Ô-2: Switches to the Week view.

Ô-3: Switches to the Month view.

Ô-R: Refreshes the selected Calendar.

Ô-Shift-R: Refreshes every Calendar.

Ô-→: Moves you to the next unit (day, week, or
month).

Ô-←: Moves you back a unit (day, week, or
month).

Ô-I: Hides and shows the Information panel (see
Figure 46-5).

Ô-Option-T: Hides and shows your To-Do list.

Tab: Cycles you through the events.
The check box next to a Calendar’s name indi-
cates whether that Calendar (and its events
and To-Do items) is visible. By toggling these
check boxes, you can more easily see only the
information you want.
4.
To change a Calendar’s properties, click the i in
the lower-right corner of the iCal window to
bring up the Info panel (see Figure 46-3).
Within the Info panel, you can
 Rename a Calendar (click its name).
 Change its color (click the arrows next to the
color).
 Add a description.

here) in detail.
Best iCal Practices
Using iCal is easy, but using it well is a whole differ-
ent matter. Here are our suggestions for getting the
most out of this application.

Keep many different organized calendars. Get
in the habit of creating new Calendars for special
projects, particular events, or when the Calendar
is shared with others.
Color-coding your calendars and turning them
on and off is so easy that using several differ-
ent calendars is a snap. Do yourself a favor
and keep your information organized by using
multiple calendars.

Use your .Mac account to back up and synchro-
nize your Calendars across multiple computers
(see Technique 42).

Use iSync to synchronize your Calendars with
an iPod or a PDA.

Discover what contextual menus can do for you
(see Figure 46-6 and Figure 46-7). As with any
application, most of the common tools are easily
accessible by using a contextual menu. Just
Control-click an item — like a To-Do list task in
Figure 46-6 or a Calendar in the Calendars win-
dow in Figure 46-7 — to see what shortcuts are

a new Calendar; double-clicking a date creates a
new event; double-clicking in the To-Do list 
creates a new task.
Subscribing and Publishing
The primary role of iCal is to handle your own
scheduling, but you can also subscribe to other peo-
ple’s calendars and publish your own so that others
can see it.
Where to find subscriptions
You can subscribe to different calendars for all kinds
of reasons. Maybe you want a calendar that lists all
the San Antonio Spurs games or all the major
Hollywood movie premieres. You can find such cal-
endars and many others like them through these
sources:

Apple: www.apple.com/ical/library

dotmac.info: www.dotmac.info/index.html/
category/6
When you find a calendar that you want to subscribe
to, just click the Subscribe link provided on the Web
site. This brings up iCal, and you’re prompted to
subscribe to that calendar. Then iCal gives you sub-
scription options (see Figure 46-9).
• Figure 46-9: Subscription options for online calendars.
The calendars to which you subscribe don’t have to
be corporate and impersonal. For example, you can
You have a Search box at the bottom of the
iCal window! This is the fastest way to find
specific events and To-Do list items. Use the
drop-down list (click the magnifying glass) to
help limit your search. 

Have iCal show people’s birthdays. A great fea-
ture added to iCal is the ability to tap into your
Address Book’s birthday information (this is yet
another reason to fully utilize the Address Book).
If you add people’s birthdays to their Address
Book records, those dates can appear in iCal.
Here’s what you want to do:
1. Open the iCal Preferences.
2. Under the General tab, select the check box
next to Show Birthdays calendar (Figure 46-8).
• Figure 46-8: iCal’s General preferences pane.
3. Close the Preferences tab.
4. Use the newly added Birthdays calendar to
remind yourself of special occasions.

Double-click your way to a shortcut.
Double-clicking creates a new Calendar, a new
event, or a new To-Do item, depending upon
what blank area you double-click. For example,
double-clicking in the Calendars window creates

subscribe to a friend’s calendar to see where and
when her band will play. After someone publishes a
calendar to .Mac or another service, she can provide
you with a URL. To subscribe to it, choose Calendar➪
Subscribe and enter that URL in the prompt that
appears.
The subscription options prompt has three options:

Refresh
The refresh tells iCal to automatically compare
your subscribed version of the calendar every so
often (15 minutes, every hour, every day, or
every week), updating your copy as necessary.
You can also manually update a subscribed cal-
endar by choosing Refresh from the Calendar
menu.

Remove Alarms

Remove To-Do Items
We recommend that you select the Remove Alarms
and Remove To-Do Items check boxes because that
information, if present, won’t be worth much to you.
Publishing your Calendar with .Mac
To share one of your Calendars (so that others might
subscribe to it), you must first publish it online. For
example, you could create a Calendar of your travel
schedule or your children’s soccer games and then
share this with family members via the Internet.
Whenever you make changes to your Calendar,
those who have subscribed to it can also retrieve
these changes.
To publish a Calendar by using your .Mac account,
follow these simple steps:
1.
In the left column of iCal, select the Calendar
that you want to share.
2.
Choose Calendar➪Publish.
3.
In the Publish Calendar As text box of the dia-
log that appears (as shown in Figure 46-10),
give the calendar a title.
• Figure 46-10: Fill out this prompt to publish your Calendar.
Your Calendar’s title must abide by standard
URL rules. This means that non-alphanumeric
characters such as punctuation and spaces 
are replaced by representations. For example,
the title Writing Schedule becomes
Writing%20Schedule, which isn’t the desired
result. Instead, use Writing_Schedule, which is
acceptable.
4.
Decide whether to update the Calendar 
automatically.
This option is important for keeping subscribers
abreast of your most current Calendar.
5.
Decide what extra parts of the Calendar you
want to share:
 Titles and notes
 Alarms
 To-Do items
6.
Make sure that .Mac is selected in the Publish
On drop-down list.
7.
Click the Publish button.
When iCal is done, you see a message indicating
two URLs for the Calendar (see Figure 46-11).
The first is for those who use iCal; those who
don’t can use the second URL to view your
Calendar in any Web browser.
8.
Give the URLs to family, friends, and co-workers.
You can click the Send Mail button to start
spreading the news.

respect to attending. What a brilliantly simple way to
schedule meetings or family gatherings!
1.
Create an event in iCal.
2.
Make sure that the Information panel is 
visible.
3.
Press Ô-Option-A to open the People window
(see Figure 46-12).
• Figure 46-12: The People window uses your Address
Book data.
4.
Drag names from the People window onto the
event in the Information panel.
The event displays the list of attendees as you
add them.
5.
Click Attendees and then choose Send
Invitations from the pop-up menu that appears
(see Figure 46-13).
iCal opens your Mail application and sends the
message.
All the participants then receive an e-mail inviting
them to the event (see Figure 46-14). When a recipi-
ent clicks the embedded link, she is given the option
of accepting the event and the option of e-mailing
you her response.
• Figure 46-11: Note the URLs for your Calendar.
Publish your Calendar without .Mac
If you don’t have a .Mac account, you can publish
your Calendar with these tools:

iCal Exchange: www.icalx.com

iCalShare: www.icalshare.com

Your Web site: If you have a hosted Web site,
you can use Findley Designs’ iCal FTP (www.
findleydesigns.com, free) to publish calendars
there.

Your Mac: If you have a permanent Internet con-
nection (broadband, not dialup), you can use the
WebDAV features of your Mac to publish iCals. A
good tutorial on doing so is at www.gregwestin.

iCal Tips and Tricks
iCal can do many things, but here are a feature and
an add-on that you might truly appreciate.
iCal and Mail
iCal works with your Address Book and the Mail
application in an unbelievably easy way. From the
contacts stored in your Address Book, you can add
potential attendees to events and then have iCal and
Mail send them e-mails and handle their replies with

• Figure 46-14: iCal sends an e-mail inviting people to 
an event.
AppleScript
iCal is, naturally, AppleScript-able. If you’re savvy with
AppleScript, you can write your own. If you’d rather
ride on the coattails of others (which is fine), check
out some of the 250 AppleScripts that Doug Adams
provides at his Web site. (Go to www.malcolmadams.
com/itunes/index.shtml, and then look for iCal in the
left column.) A couple of AppleScripts are particularly
useful for iCal users:

iCal Calling iChat: This script automatically
changes your iChat status message (normally
Away or Available) so that it reflects your
Calendar’s schedule. For example, if you have a
meeting with Marc from 1 until 3, this script
changes your iChat status during that time to
read Meeting with Marc.

iCal Calling iTunes: This script uses iCal to
schedule iTunes playlists. You can have iCal start
and stop playing different lists that you create in
iTunes. For example, you can have iCal automati-
cally start a playlist or radio station when you
log on in the morning and then stop iTunes when
you go to lunch.

n this technique, we cover every possible timesaving technique in exis-
tence (well, maybe we missed one or two) related to CDs and DVDs. If
you have a CD-write (CD-R), CD-rewrite (CD-RW), DVD-write (DVD-R), or
DVD-rewrite (DVD-RW) drive in or attached to your Mac, use the good tips
here for burning discs. If you don’t have a write drive of any sort, at least
go through the first section to tell Tiger how to handle your discs.
Setting Your System Preferences
Setting System Preferences to automatically handle discs is an important
configuration step to take. Adjusting these settings once saves you a life-
time of making decisions later.
1.
In the Finder, open the Finder preferences panel.
2.

This setting makes your discs appear in the
Sidebar of Finder windows when they’re
mounted (as shown in Figure 47-2). It applies to
disk images as well as CDs and DVDs.
• Figure 47-2: You can easily access inserted discs via the
Finder window Sidebar.
4.
Click the General icon.
5.
Select the CDs, DVDs, and iPods check boxes
(see Figure 47-3).
This setting guarantees that mounted discs also
appear on the Desktop.
• Figure 47-3: Show discs on the Desktop to make them
readily available.
6.
Open System Preferences and click the CDs &
DVDs icon (under Hardware).
7.
Use the drop-down lists to tell Tiger what to do
when different types of discs are inserted (see
the choices in Figure 47-4).
For most users, the default settings are just fine.
How and what you change depends upon how
you use your computer:
 If you always burn CDs from iTunes and never
from another application (like the Finder,
Backup, or Disk Utility), you can set blank CDs
to trigger iTunes.
The same applies to blank DVDs: Open iDVD
when they’re inserted.
 If you don’t use the default Apple application
for a particular disc type (for example, you
don’t use iPhoto or DVD Player), choose your
preferred application in the CDs & DVDs
System Preferences panel.
• Figure 47-4: Save yourself a step by customizing these
settings.
Use the CDs & DVDs System Preferences 
panel to indicate the default action for different
media. You can then overrule this action as
needed (for example, if you want to make a CD
by using the Finder and not iTunes, or open a
picture CD in iView Media instead of iPhoto).
When those times come, let Tiger open the
default application and then switch over to (or
open) the application you’d rather use.

Technique 47: Working with CDs and DVDs
368
To burn CDs or DVDs with the old, standard
way, you need as much free space on your
hard drive as you’re burning. Thus, to make a
CD, you must have around 700MB of free
space in which to store the burned files. For
burning DVDs, this means you must have a
whopping 4GB or more of space available!

Always burn the latest version of a file, no matter
when it was added to the burn folder.

Are faster to set up.
You don’t need to wait for files to be copied
(which you do with the old method).
Burn folders aren’t much harder to make than ordi-
nary folders or standard burnable discs:
1.
In the Finder, open a new Finder window.
2.
Navigate to a logical location for your burn
folder.
Likely candidates would be the Desktop or your
Home folder.
3.
Choose File➪New Burn Folder.
4.
Give the new burn folder an appropriate name.
The folder appears with a special icon: a folder
with a burn circle on it. The default folder name —
cleverly, Burn Folder.fpbf — is highlighted (see
Figure 47-5) so that typing creates the new name.
• Figure 47-5: A new burn folder.
5.
Add items to this burn folder by dragging them
onto either burn folder icon.
Scripting CDs
If you want to get really fancy, you can set Tiger to run 
specific AppleScripts when different types of discs are
inserted. All you need to do is select Run Script from the
appropriate drop-down list in the CDs & DVDs preferences
panel and then select the script on your hard drive by using
the prompt that appears.
Sample ideas might include

Opening Backup when a blank CD is inserted and
automatically running a particular type of backup

An AppleScript that runs a command line utility and
writes the event log to your CD instead of the hard
drive
You can create the scripts yourself or download them from
any of the common AppleScript resources online. The best
AppleScript sites include

Mac Scripter: www.macscripter.net

Apple: www.apple.com/applescript

Script Web: www.scriptweb.com
This feature can be extended for external drives (like a
FireWire drive you occasionally use) thanks to Do Something
When (www.azarhi.com/projects/DSW/index.php, free).
With its configuration tool, you can have a game automati-
cally launch when its CD is inserted or open iTunes when the
hard drive with your music on it is mounted.
Using the New Burn
Folders Feature
A less-promoted but great new feature in Tiger is the
ability to create burn folders. The premise behind
the burn folder is that aliases to the files are stored
in a special folder. Then, when it’s time to actually
burn the disc, the original files (whose aliases are
stored in the folder) are retrieved and written to the
disc. Burn folders have several benefits over the old
way of making CDs (which we cover in the next sec-
tion). They . . .

Require less hard drive space.

Burning CDs
369
Tiger never copies or moves a file to a burn
folder. Instead, an alias of the object is placed
within the burn folder. When you burn the
folder to disc, Tiger follows the folder’s aliases
back to their original items and burns the origi-
nals to disc. Therefore, the most current versions
of the items are burned. So even if you change
a file after it was added to a burn folder, those
changes are reflected in the burned disc.
6.
When you’re ready to burn this folder to disc,
either
 Click the burn icon (it looks like a little hazard
symbol) next to the folder’s name in any
Finder window.
 Select the burn folder in a Finder window and
select File➪Burn Disc.
7.
Insert a blank CD or DVD at the prompt (see
Figure 47-6).
As soon as it recognizes the blank media, Tiger
will burn all of the original files onto the disc.
• Figure 47-6: Tiger prompts you to insert a blank disc.
When you no longer need the burn folder, delete
it by dragging it to the Trash. (Your files are safe
because the folder contains only aliases.)
Burning CDs
If you have a CD-R drive built into your Mac or
attached externally, you can easily rip audio, video,
or data CDs at your leisure. Considering the cheap
cost of blank CD media, this is a nearly ideal medium
for you to use. Making CDs in Tiger isn’t rocket sci-
ence, but we go through a few tips and tricks that
you can use in the different applications. Specifically,
we target the Finder, iTunes, and iPhoto.
Tiger’s built-in disc-burning applications are
sufficient for most users. If you want some-
thing a little nicer and more customizable,
Toast from Roxio (www.roxio.com, $100) is
the reigning king.
Making CDs in the Finder
Unless you’ve told Tiger to do otherwise (by setting
in the CDs & DVDs panel), the Finder asks you what
to do when a blank disc is inserted (see Figure 47-7).
At this point, you can choose a specific application
to open and give the disc a name. After you do this,
the disc is mounted on the Desktop. A faster way to
create discs in the Finder is to do this:
• Figure 47-7: The Finder prompt when blank media is
inserted.
1.
Set the preferences to show discs in the Finder
window Sidebar (see earlier in this chapter;
refer to Figure 47-1).
2.
Insert a blank disc.

Technique 47: Working with CDs and DVDs


Audio: For an audio CD, select the Use Sound
Check box to give the CD a more consistent vol-
ume level. Set the Gap Between Songs to 2
Seconds. If you like smoother transitions, under
the Audio pane, set Crossfade Playback to 2
Seconds for a more professional feel.

MP3: The MP3 format retains information about
a file. For example, it associates such metadata
(information that describes a thing) as the artist
name, song, and album with the file. This infor-
mation is lost when you make a standard audio
CD. MP3 CDs also hold about ten times as many
songs as standard audio CDs.
To make an MP3 CD, which many new com-
pact disc players can play, the songs must be
in MP3 format. If you use the AAC encoder —
the Apple standard — when you import music,
these might not be playable on many other
devices.

Data: A data disc is just that . . . and probably
something you don’t want to be doing with
iTunes. If you want to create data discs, just use
the Finder like you would with any other CD.
• Figure 47-9: Tell iTunes what kind of CD to make.
3.
Give the disc a name at the prompt.
4.
Open a Finder window.
The blank disc should appear in the Sidebar of
the Finder window (see Figure 47-8).

Backup Images here).
5.
Use the content area of the window to find the
files that you want to write to the disc.
6.

Sidebar.
7.
Click the Burn icon (looks like a fallout shelter
sign) in the Sidebar window to create the disc.
Mount disc images in the Finder Sidebar to
create discs using only a single window.
Making an audio CD in iTunes
The crucial considerations for making CDs in iTunes
are tweaked in the iTunes Burning preferences panel
(as shown in Figure 47-9). Use the radio buttons to
dictate your CD’s format:

Burning CDs
371
Making picture CDs in iPhoto
To burn a CD in iPhoto, all you need to do is select a
photo album in the left column and then choose
Share➪Burn Disc. Just follow the prompts and you’ll
be done in no time! Making CDs in iPhoto retains all
your album information along with the images. If you
use these CDs on your Mac or share them with other
Mac users, this is perfect. If what you want instead is
just a disc of images, use the Finder, Toast, or Disk
Utility to burn a data disc.
iPhoto can’t copy photo libraries and albums
across multiple discs. You must either subdi-
vide your collection and burn it separately or
use the Finder and lose all the photo data.
When an iPhoto CD is loaded onto another Mac, it can
be displayed in iPhoto, retaining all the information
from the original user. The new user can do anything
with the images he wants except for editing them
(unless the images are imported first). You can eject a
CD in iPhoto by dragging the disc icon onto the
iPhoto Trash icon, just as you would in the Finder.
Also see Technique 44 on using iPhoto to
manage your digital library.

Getting More Than
Music out of Your
iPod
I
f you own an iPod, we don’t have to tell you how great it is for listening
to music while you’re out and about. What you might not know is that
your iPod can do a lot more than play music. In this technique, we tell
you about some of those other useful, timesaving capabilities.
First, we look at some of the things that you can do with the tools
included in Tiger, allowing you to store other data on your iPod. Next, we
show you useful tricks with third-party programs and shareware tools.
Many of these use the features of the iPod in new and creative ways.
All of these uses do, of course, require free space on your iPod (any-
where from a few kilobytes to a gigabyte or more, depending on what
you’re trying to do), so if you have it filled to capacity with music
already, you have to make some room first. If you run into this problem,
check out the final section to see how to clean out some space.
Using the iPod for Data Storage 
and Transfer
The iPod is a very good place to store important files. By doing so, you
create backups and you gain the ability to take your stuff with you when
you travel. Because the iPod connects to the Mac via a FireWire connec-
tion, you can transfer even very large files efficiently.
Here are some things you can do with the iPod:

Transfer media files between computers (like large video files from a
DV camera).

Retain disk image (.dmg) files of big software installers for installation
of the same software on several identical machines (useful if you work
in a computer lab).

Keep sensitive information on the iPod instead of the computer’s hard
drive so you can always take it with you (see “Secure, Encrypted
Storage on the iPod”).
48
Technique

Secure, Encrypted Storage on the iPod
373

Store backups of the most important data. (See
“Backing Up Your Data to an iPod,” later in this
technique.)

Use your iPod to help diagnose and repair bro-
ken OS X installations (see “Emergency Rescue
iPod”).
The organization of your data on the iPod is really
simple:

Use iTunes to manage your music on the iPod.

Use the Finder to store non-music files and fold-
ers that you want to carry around or just store
there. (The iPod, when mounted, appears like
any other volume on the Desktop or Finder win-
dow. The volumes icon differs, though, looking
like a miniature iPod. If the volume doesn’t
appear, select the Enable Disk Use check box in
the iPod preferences in iTunes.)
The place on the iPod where the music is stored
is hidden from the Finder. Similarly, your non-
music files aren’t visible in iTunes. Therefore, the
iPod provides a perfect and clean separation
between the two kinds of data.
Because the music directories are hidden in
the Finder, you usually can’t mess up any-
thing. However, if you’re using the Terminal or
disk- or file-management utilities, you can see
these hidden music directories. If you erase or
otherwise modify your music files outside of
iTunes, you corrupt the iPod’s music database
and have to re-download all of the music from
iTunes.
Sharing your iPod between 
Mac OS X and Windows
If you need to move files (especially large ones) between
your Mac and a computer running Windows, you can use
your iPod (with a dock connector) to do just that. The iPod
is perfect for moving office documents between your
Windows PC at work and your Mac at home, for example.
Assuming you’ve been using your iPod on a Mac until
now, you need to do these three things in order to share
your iPod between Windows and Mac OS X:
1.
Buy a second iPod cable to connect the iPod to the
Windows PC, one that goes from the dock connector
to a USB port (instead of the dock-to-FireWire cable
used on a Mac).
2.
Make sure you have backups of everything currently
on your iPod because it’s all about to go (temporarily)
bye-bye.
3.
Reformat your iPod to allow a Windows computer to
access data stored on an iPod. You can reformat your
iPod by using Apple’s iPod Updater program for
Windows (www.apple.com/ipod/download). You
want to format the iPod in the FAT file system, which 
is a format understood by Windows.
Reformatting the iPod is necessary for Windows compatibil-
ity because a Mac iPod is formatted with the HFS+ file sys-
tem. Even with the correct USB connector cable, a Windows
PC can’t recognize an iPod formatted this way. Note that all
your data on the iPod is lost during the reformatting process.
After you format the iPod by using FAT, your Mac won’t
have any problems using it because Mac OS X knows how
to read and write FAT-formatted hard drives. The only quirk
is that the iPod’s icon in the Finder might revert to a plain
hard drive icon, but you can easily fix that by using a tool
such as Finder Icon CM, which we present in Technique 17.
Secure, Encrypted Storage 
on the iPod
If you have sensitive data that you want to keep in a
really safe place, this is for you! Create an encrypted
virtual volume in the form of a disk image on the
iPod. A disk image is a virtual hard drive whose
entire contents are stored in an ordinary file, the
disk image file. Double-clicking the disk image file
mounts the hard drive on the Desktop so that you
can use it.

Technique 48: Getting More Than Music out of Your iPod
374
5.
Still in the Save As dialog, choose your iPod
from the Where drop-down list or from the list
of volumes in the left column (if the more
expanded prompt is shown).
6.
Pick a reasonable size for your disk image
from the Size drop-down list — the smaller the
better — and enable AES encryption by choos-
ing it from the Encryption drop-down list.
7.
Make sure that the Format drop-down list box
is set to Read/Write Disk Image.
8.
Click Create.
9.
At the prompt that appears, enter a new 
password.
Pick a password that’s hard to guess.
If you lose this password, you lose all your data
on the encrypted volume. You can’t recover 
a lost password! Because your encrypted 
data is most likely very important to you, you
absolutely must not lose this password. Also,
remember to make regular backups of this disk
image.
As always, storing the password in the key-
chain is a big timesaver, so you should enable
the Keychain check box. However, if you’re
really paranoid about the data on this disk
image, clear the Keychain check box in this
case and just type in the password every time.
See Technique 53 for information on pass-
words and the Keychain Access application. 
10.
Disk Utility automatically mounts the new vol-
ume, and you can immediately begin storing
files there.
11.
When you’re finished transferring files, eject
the virtual volume by dragging it to the Trash
on the Dock.
From now on, you have to double-click the disk
image file on the iPod volume every time you want
to work with the data. The disk mounts, and you can
use it like any other removable medium to store files
and folders there (see Figure 48-2).
Using an encrypted disk image is secure for two 
reasons:

The data doesn’t stay on your computer’s hard
drive. When you’re done working with your data,
you simply disconnect the iPod, and nobody can
get physical access to your sensitive information.

The data is encrypted and password-protected
by using the state-of-the-art, 128-bit Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES) encryption built
into Apple’s disk images.
Mac OS X already includes everything that you need
to create a disk image:
1.
Make sure that your iPod is connected to your
Mac.
2.
Open Disk Utility.
Disk Utility is stored in the Utilities folder, 
naturally.
3.
In the Disk Utility main window, choose New
Image from the toolbar.
4.
In the resulting prompt, enter a name for your
encrypted disk image in the Save As box, as
shown in Figure 48-1.
• Figure 48-1: Settings for the new, encrypted disk image.

Backing Up Your Data to an iPod
375
• Figure 48-2: The disk image file on the iPod and the
virtual volume where the confidential data is

Backing Up Your Data 
to an iPod
You can back up your data to an iPod in several
ways, including simply dragging files and folders to
the iPod in the Finder. We also show you two backup
programs in this section.
Regardless of the method that you use, keep in mind
that the iPod differs from the typical backup medium
in a few ways:

The iPod’s hard drive is geared toward light
use during music playback. Don’t perform full
backups to it every day. Writing and reading mas-
sive amounts of data very often could shorten
the iPod’s life span.

The iPod’s capacity is probably a lot smaller
than your computer’s hard drive. Be selective
and back up only important files, like your docu-
ments. Leave out things like applications or driv-
ers, which you can always reinstall from
installation CDs.
Using .Mac and Backup
If you’re a .Mac member (currently $99 per year; see
Technique 42 for more information), you can use
Apple’s Backup utility. Starting with version 2.0, it
can back up to an external FireWire drive, which is
exactly what an iPod is.
If you haven’t installed Backup on your computer,
install it now. You can download the software after you
log in to the .Mac member Web site at www.mac.com.
For more detailed instructions on using Backup
(without an iPod), see Technique 49.
To set up Backup for the first time, do the following:
1.
Launch Backup by double-clicking the Backup
icon in the Finder (presumably in the
Applications or Utilities folder), which looks
like a small umbrella.
2.
Choose Back Up to Drive from the drop-down list
in the upper-left corner of the Backup window.
3.
Decide what to back up by selecting the check
box for each item that you want to back up.
Backup shows you a list of items in your Home
directory (see Figure 48-3). For a full backup,
choose everything. However, we suggest leaving
out as much as you can. For example, you don’t
need to back up the iTunes collection because it
takes a lot of space (and thus backup time) and
because you can always reimport the music from
CDs. Furthermore, you probably already have a
backup of your music collection on the iPod,
anyway!
4.
Use the + button to add other items to the list,
especially items that aren’t stored in your
Home directory.
5.
Click the Set button to choose the backup 
location.
6.
Click the Create button in the dialog that 
pops up.

Using Carbon Copy Cloner
Apple’s Backup utility is tied to a .Mac membership,
even if you back up only to local drives and not to
the .Mac servers. However, if you don’t have a .Mac
account, you can choose from plenty of other tools
to perform backups. An inexpensive and reliable one
that we like is Carbon Copy Cloner by Bombich
Software (www.bombich.com/software/ccc.html; free
but donation requested).
Do this to back up your computer:
1.
Launch Carbon Copy Cloner (see Figure 48-5).
2.
In the main window, pick a source disk from
the drop-down list.
3.
Remove any unwanted items from the Items to
Be Copied list.
To remove an item, select it from the Items to Be
Copied list and click the Delete button (the red
circle with the slash through it).
4.
From the Target Disk drop-down list, select
your iPod.
• Figure 48-3: The list of items to back up in the
application’s main window.
7.
In the Save dialog that appears, select your
iPod in the list of available volumes on the
left.
8.
In the Save As text box, enter a descriptive
name for this backup.
Marc used Laptop-backup in the example (see
Figure 48-4).
9.
Click Create to make the new backup location
and return to the main Backup window.
10.
Perform the backup by clicking the Backup
Now button.
You can set up automated, scheduled backups
by using the Schedule button at the bottom of
the window (the one that looks like a calendar).
You have to make sure that your Mac is turned
on, your iPod is connected to your Mac, and
you’re logged in at the scheduled time. You
could, for example, leave your machine running
through the night and have it start the backup
at a fixed time. This way, your computer does
the hard work while you’re sleeping.

Click the Preferences button to edit your 
preferences.
Carbon Copy Cloner can create two kinds of
backups: identical, bootable copies; and disk
images. In the preferences dialog that appears
(see Figure 48-6), select the Create a Disk Image
on Target check box unless you really plan to
boot from the iPod later on. Booting from the
iPod can be handy in case of a problem with
your computer’s main startup disk. Click Save to
close the preferences dialog.
6.
Click the little lock symbol and enter your pass-
word in the dialog that appears.
7.
Click the Clone button to start the backup
process.
The backup usually takes a while, so plan on get-
ting a bite to eat or taking a nap while it does its
thing.
• Figure 48-6: Carbon Copy Cloner’s preferences dialog.
Emergency Rescue iPod
If your computer’s startup hard drive gets cor-
rupted, you need to boot from a secondary device in
order to repair and/or rescue the main drive. The
iPod is an ideal device for this purpose.
You can install a stripped-down Mac OS X package
onto the iPod, which includes Apple’s Disk Utility for
hard drive first aid. Optionally, you can add third-
party hard drive repair products such as Norton
Utilities (www.symantec.com), DiskWarrior (www.
alsoft.com), or Data Rescue (www.prosofteng.net).
To create a bootable emergency Mac OS X installa-
tion on your iPod, follow these steps:
1.
Insert the first Mac OS X installation CD.
2.
Launch the installer and follow the on-screen
instructions.
A reboot might be required (see Technique 1 for
more information).
3.
In the Destination screen, select your iPod vol-
ume and click the Continue button.
By default, the reformat option is disabled,
which is probably what you want (so you don’t
erase any existing data or songs on your iPod).

3.
In the iSync dialog, click the Sync Now button
to perform the first synchronization.
For maximum efficiency, allow iSync to launch
and synchronize whenever you connect your
iPod by marking the Automatically Synchronize
When iPod Is Connected check box. This way,
the data on the iPod is always up to date with-
out you having to think about synchronizing
(see Figure 48-8). Click the iPod icon in iSync’s
main window to see these settings.
You can view your Contacts and Calendars
under Extras on your iPod.
• Figure 48-8: Enabling automatic synchronization.
4.
Click the Customize button as soon as it
appears.
5.
Make sure to remove as many of the optional
Mac OS X components as possible.
This includes printer drivers, language versions,
and so on. You really want a bare-bones system
to save space on the iPod.
6.
After the installation is complete, unplug the
iPod to make sure that your computer boots
from the main drive and then reboot your Mac.
7.
Open the Finder, connect the iPod, and install
any other disk repair utilities that you have.
To boot from the iPod when an emergency actually
happens, plug in your iPod and hold down the
Option key during a reboot. You see a list of con-
nected, bootable devices. Click the iPod icon and
click the right arrow to continue the boot process.
Synchronizing with iSync
Apple adds more PDA-like features to the iPod’s soft-
ware all the time. Currently, this means read-only
access to your iCal and Address Book data. (You
can’t edit this data through your iPod.) Somehow
these Contacts and Calendars need to be synchro-
nized from your computer to your iPod, and that’s
what the iSync program does.
To set up synchronization, do the following:
1.
Launch iSync.
2.
Choose Add Device from the Devices menu and
double-click your iPod’s icon in the Add Device
dialog that appears (see Figure 48-7).
• Figure 48-7: Add your iPod to iSync’s list of devices.

Keeping Notes on Your iPod
379
Keeping Notes on Your iPod
The new iPods (with a dock connector) can store
text Notes in addition to Contacts and Calendars. To
store Notes, simply drag short text files such as gro-
cery shopping lists and To-Do items to the Notes
folder on the iPod in the Finder (see Figure 48-9).
• Figure 48-9: Storing small text Notes on the iPod.
Some specialized freeware and shareware tools are
available to make working with iPod Notes even
quicker. We picked out a few and describe them in
the following sections.
Using Notes on older iPods
If you own an older iPod that doesn’t directly sup-
port Notes, utilities are available to pack up Notes as
Contacts and store them in the Contacts list. This
trick works fine for most short Notes.
A good utility that does this is the free Text2iPod X.
Simply drop your Note text file onto the application’s
icon, and the application stores the file on the iPod if
the iPod is connected. The program is available at
http://homepage.mac.com/applelover/text2ipodx.
Viewing outlines on the iPod
If you use the (highly recommended) OmniOutliner
program to organize information, you’ll appreciate 
a little script addition to the program called Omni-
Outliner iPod Export. It exports an outline directly to
the iPod. It even supports older iPods by storing the
Note disguised as a Contact (see Figure 48-10).
• Figure 48-10: Export an OmniOutliner outline file directly
to an iPod.
You can download the script for free at www.
omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/extras.
Downloading driving directions to the iPod
PodQuest is an application that allows you to down-
load driving directions from the MapQuest service
to your iPod. It installs an icon on your menu bar.
From there, you can look up directions (see Figure
48-11) and download them directly to your iPod.
To download PodQuest, go to www.mibasoft.dk/
podquest.html ($9.95).
• Figure 48-11: Download driving directions from
MapQuest to the iPod.

If you want a completely fresh start, reformat the
iPod by using Disk Utility. Be sure to select the
indented iPod volume in the list at the left. Open the
Erase tab in the right half of the window and then
click the Erase button (see Figure 48-12).
The next time that you launch iTunes, it responds as
if a new iPod has been connected and asks you what
to do.
Don’t reformat your iPod unless you’re prepared
to completely wipe out everything on it!
• Figure 48-12: Reformatting the iPod.
Using the iPod as a limited PDA
Pod2Go combines many tasks into one application.
It can collect useful information from the Internet —
such as news headlines, movie showtimes, driving
directions, unread e-mail messages, and weather
forecasts — and store them as text on the iPod. It
can also automatically back up files from your com-
puter to the iPod every time you synchronize.
Pod2Go is available at www.kainjow.com/pod2go.
Housekeeping on the iPod
After you use your iPod for a while for music play-
back and data storage, it might fill up. For many rea-
sons, including being able to do some of the other
things that we mention in this chapter, you might
want to clean out the data on it quickly. You have
three choices to free up space on the device:

Erase music via iTunes.

Erase data on the iPod volume from the Finder.

Reformat the drive with the Disk Utility program,
which erases everything (both music and data).
The nice thing about the way the data is stored on
the iPod is that your music and your other data are
kept completely separate. If you erase files from the
iPod in the Finder, you don’t lose any of your music;
if you clean up music in iTunes, you don’t lose any of
your data.

Better Backups
with rsync and
.Mac
I
f you care about any of the data on your computer, you’d better back it
up. It’s that simple. Although today’s computers are more reliable than
their predecessors, you absolutely must back up your stuff. Accidents
still happen, hard drives crash, laptops get dropped, and computers are
stolen. Without a backup, you’re in trouble if any of these things happen
to you.
We begin this technique by going over the best backup policies to abide
by. Then we take you through an easy and free backup utility, rsync,
which is quite handy but unfamiliar to many Mac users. After that, we
demonstrate Apple’s Backup software, which is available to .Mac mem-
bers only. Finally, we mention several other third-party tools that might
be to your liking if rsync or Backup don’t fit your needs.
Maybe you’ve never lost data. Maybe you don’t even know anyone
who has. Still, be sure to back up your computer (either the entire
hard drive or just the most important files). It costs very little, doesn’t
take much time, and makes you look like a savvy, pre-emptive com-
puter user.
Smart Backups
An effective backup requires a plan. Be sure to

Back up your data frequently. Ideally, you should back up your Home
directory daily and your entire computer either weekly or monthly.
When it comes to making backups, the question to ask yourself is,
“How much data can I afford to lose? One day’s worth? A week’s
worth?” You need to be burned only once to rethink your entire
backup philosophy.

Make multiple backups. You don’t want to discover after your com-
puter crashes that your only backup is also corrupted.

copying only the altered parts of a file. For
example, if you edit a text file, the new
changes are copied, not the entire file.

It doesn’t need to be run as an administrator.

It maintains file ownership and permissions.

Did we happen to mention that it’s free?
The only drawbacks to this application are

You must use the Terminal.

You can’t back up to a CD or DVD.

It has no pretty graphical user interface to
admire.

It has problems backing up resource forks. (See
the sidebar, “rsync, resource forks, and why you
should care about them.”)

You can’t deduct the purchase price from your
taxes.
You can use rsync in many ways. The three most
important and common are

Backing up files locally (from one drive to
another on your computer)

Backing up files remotely (from your computer to
a remote computer)

Backing up remote files locally (from a remote
computer to your computer)
rsync can back up files either to or from a
remote server (if it’s also running rsync). If
you’re a Web developer, this can be a very
handy tool!
To use rsync, pull up the command line tool (the
Terminal application, found in the Utilities folder)
and enter a command with this basic syntax:
rsync -options sourcedirectory 
targetdirectory
 Use multiple backup locations. Save your first
backup to one set of CDs or DVDs and then
save the next backup to a different set of CDs
or DVDs.
 Rotate your backup sets — use one backup
set for a month, use a second set for the next
month, and then go back to the first for a
month, and so forth.

Back up to different media. Rotate your back-
ups among your available sets, such as external
hard drives, CDs, and DVDs.

Keep a backup copy in a different building
from your computer. If your only backup copy is
in your home office next to your computer and
the house burns down, you’ve lost everything.
Leave one of your multiple backups in a fire-
proof safe, at school, at the office . . . some-
where other than where your computer is.

Test your backup. This confirms that the backup
worked and that you know how to use it if you
need it. If you have a spare computer or drive,
restore your entire backup to it. Otherwise,
restore part of your backup to an arbitrary loca-
tion on your computer, just for testing purposes. 
rsync: The Geek’s Backup Utility
If you don’t mind a little command-line work, you
can use the rsync utility to perform your backups.
The benefits of using rsync include

It’s free!

It’s very, very fast.

rsync copies only the changed files, saving time
and hard drive space.
Most backup utilities perform incremental
backups: They copy only altered and new
files. Unchanged files aren’t copied after the
initial backup. rsync takes this further by

rsync: The Geek’s Backup Utility
385
For example, a simple way to use the tool would be
to run this command:
rsync -a ~/Documents/WorkFiles/ /Users/
Shared/MyWorkFiles
This would copy the entire contents (the a means
that an exact copy should be made) of the WorkFiles
directory (located within the Documents folder of
the current user’s Home directory) to a folder called
MyWorkFiles, located in the Shared users folder. By
copying these files over to the Shared users folder,
other Mac users can access them. Repeated uses of
this command ensure that the most recent versions
of the files in Larry’s WorkFiles folder are copied
over to the public directory.
rsync syntax options
The most important options are (these can, and
often are, combined)

a: Creates an exact archive.

n: Runs a test backup to show you what rsync
will do without actually doing it.
If you’re a little nervous about using rsync,
run it with the -n option to see what files it
will copy without actually copying the files (see
Figure 49-1). The -a indicates that an exact
archive should be created, the -z says to use
compression, but the -n dictates that a trial
run should be taken first.
• Figure 49-1: Run a test backup to see what happens.

v: Gives you a verbose response.

z: Uses compression to save space.

--exclude: Skips backup of selected files.
For example, to exclude the contents of the
Preferences directory, use
rync -az --exclude=Preferences/ /Users/
larry /Volumes/Backup

--progress: If you want to see a progress report
while rsync runs, use --progress.

--quiet: If you don’t want a lot of feedback, use
--quiet. (This is essentially the opposite of the
verbose option.)

--stats: To see basic statistics on the backed-up
data (number of files involved, total data backed
up, and so on), use --stats (see Figure 49-2).
• Figure 49-2: Get more detailed reporting with --stats.
If you use a trailing slash with your source
directory name, you back up that directory’s
contents but not the directory itself. In other
words, rsync -az ~/Documents/ /target
copies everything in Documents to the target
without making a Documents folder.
Backing up Home to an external hard drive
A good way to use rsync is to back up your Home
directory to an external hard drive. Follow these
steps to do just that:

Technique 49: Better Backups with rsync and .Mac
386
Because the Terminal has problems with spaces
in filenames, spaces must be escaped (preceded
with a backslash) in all path names. (In the
Finder, the drive is called 40 GB Firewire, which
is then shown as 40\ GB\ Firewire in the
Terminal.)
See Technique 56 for more on escaping and using
tab completion or the Finder to easily enter path
names.
The only problem you’re likely to see from run-
ning this command is if your pathnames (the
location of the volumes and directories) are
incorrect. If you see such an error, change your
pathnames accordingly.
5.
When you’re ready for the backup, run rsync
with this command:
rsync -az —progress —stats ~/ /Volumes/
<drive>/path/to/folder
Figure 49-5 shows a successfully executed
backup.
• Figure 49-5: Running the actual backup.
1.
Mount an external drive.
You can use an external FireWire or USB drive, or
even a Zip disk if it’s large enough.
2.
Open the Terminal by double-clicking its icon
in the Utilities folder.
3.
At the prompt, type ls /Volumes/ to list the
drives (see Figure 49-3).
This command lists the currently connected
drives, along with their names. Before using
rsync, make sure that your drive is available.
• Figure 49-3: Larry’s computer has a main drive (Macintosh
HD) and an external drive (40GB Firewire)
mounted.
4.
Preview the backup operation by typing this
command:
rsync -azn ~/ /Volumes/<drive>/path/to/
destination
The a and z flags tell rsync to archive and com-
press the files. The n flag states that you want to
preview the operation.
In Figure 49-4, Larry’s Home directory (~/) is
being backed up to /Volumes/40\ GB\
Firewire/G4\ iBook\ Backup.
Figure 49-4: Test the backup.

Backup for .Mac Users
387
Usually, running this command doesn’t reveal or
cause any problems. (It’s just a backup, after all.)
However, if you see a Permission Denied mes-
sage or it seems like an extraordinary amount of
information is about to be copied, you might
want to rethink your rsync command.
6.
After rsync has completed its task, check the
destination drive in the Finder to make sure
that the files were backed up.
A cron (a UNIX task-scheduling program) can
automatically call rsync at set times. This way,
you can back up your computer at regular
intervals (maybe every night) without any
extra effort. See Technique 54 for more.
Restoring a backup
You need to restore all or part of a backup if:

You accidentally deleted some files

Your hard drive crashed and had to be 
reformatted

You want to make the files accessible on another
computer
To restore a backup, just use rsync again, with the
appropriate parameters:
1.
Mount the external drive containing the
backup.
2.
Open the Terminal by double-clicking its icon
in the Utilities folder.
3.
At the prompt, type ls /Volumes/ to list the
drives (refer to Figure 49-3).
4.
Restore the backed-up files to a new location
by using this command:
rsync –av /Volumes/<drive>/path/to/
folder ~/Desktop
This command copies the entire folder directory
to your Desktop. It’s the easiest, most foolproof
method of being able to re-access previously
saved data. After the files are on the Desktop,
you can move or edit them as you see fit.
rsync, resource forks, and why you 
should care about them
A resource fork is a special file that contains an application’s
resources (like the icons and images it uses). rsync doesn’t
recognize old-style resource forks, which might be linger-
ing on your computer. Resource forks are still used by a
number of UNIX applications that have been brought into
the Mac OS X platform. This means that some of the
backed-up files stored via rsync might not be usable when
restored to your Mac. For this reason, you should 

Use rsync only for your personal files, not the appli-
cations or the whole operating system.

Test rsync by restoring some files to make sure that it
works for the files that are important to you.
If you need to backup applications that have resource forks,
you have a couple command-line options:

The ditto command. See the manual for ditto (type
man ditto in the Terminal) for more information. 

The asr utility (Apple Software Restore). Its specific
purpose is to copy disk images in order to make
clones of drives. It’s not designed for routine backups
but will do the trick.
Backup for .Mac Users
If you have a .Mac account, you have a pretty good
backup tool — appropriately called Backup — which
is free for all .Mac users. (A .Mac membership costs
$99 per year, but you get some pretty nice other fea-
tures as well.) In the latest version of Backup, you
can copy files to

Select one of the three backup options from the
drop-down list (as shown in Figure 49-7).
 iDisk: If you select your iDisk, you don’t need
to do anything more except connect to the
Internet — go to the section, “Deciding what
to back up,” later in this technique.
If you’re a trial .Mac member, you can back up
stuff only to your iDisk. These files are lost if
you drop your membership. Use Backup only
if you plan on keeping your account.
• Figure 49-7: Back up to your iDisk, an optical disc (CD or
DVD), or a drive.
 CD: If you choose CD, Backup displays how
many CDs are required at the bottom of the
window.
 Drive: If you choose Drive, follow these steps:
a. Click the Set button, next to the drop-down list.
b. Click the Create button at the prompt (see
Figure 49-8) to make a new backup location. If
you’ve already created a backup location,
click Open instead.
• Figure 49-8: This prompt appears if you choose to back
up to a drive.
In fact, Backup can now perform backups over multi-
ple volumes or types of volumes. For instance, you
can back up your entire hard drive to a combination
of DVDs and CDs.
If you have a .Mac account, you can also use
iSync to back up (or synchronize) your
Address Book data, iCal Calendars, and Safari
bookmarks online.
The best way to demonstrate all the timesaving
techniques involved with Backup is to run through
a quick example, highlighting the key points along
the way.
Getting started with Backup
To begin using the Backup application, you must
establish to what resource you will backup your data:
1.
Open Backup.
Backup takes a second to open while it checks
the status of your iDisk. Your current iDisk usage
is shown at the top of the Backup window (see
Figure 49-6).
• Figure 49-6: Start here to use Apple’s Backup application.

Backup for .Mac Users

c. Navigate to where you want to create the
backup or navigate to the existing backup
location and then press Return.
Deciding what to back up
After you decide where to back up your data, the next
important decision — in fact, the most important 
decision — is what to back up. The Backup utility uses
QuickPicks, which automatically identifies common
files and file types (refer to Figure 49-6). These include

Safari bookmarks

Keychains

Address Book contacts

Stickies files

iCal Calendars

AppleWorks stuff

iPhoto and iTunes libraries

Microsoft Office documents

E-mail
To back up any of these items, select the check box
next to its name in the Back Up column. 
To see more details about an item, bring up the
Info panel (as shown in Figure 49-9). Select the item
and either click the Info button (which bears a low-
ercase i) or press Ô-I.
To add items to be backed up, you can either

Click the + button and navigate to the item.

Drag the item from the Finder and drop it into
Backup.
The easiest and most thorough way to use
Backup is to drag your Home folder into the
application.
If you don’t like the list of options made available to
you, use the Edit menu (see Figure 49-10) to quickly
make changes to the list.
• Figure 49-9: Use the Info panel to preview a group 
of files or fine-tune your selections.
• Figure 49-10: Use the Edit menu to remove items or
select and clear all the items at once.
Finalizing the backup
The last step for backing up your stuff is to click the
Backup Now button. You’re prompted for a disc
name if you’re burning to a CD/DVD (you might as
well use the default name Backup provides). Then
you see a progress bar while Backup continues.
When the backup is finished, click the calendar icon
at the bottom of the screen. A dialog in which you

• Figure 49-11: After you use the application once, you can
schedule incremental backups.
The downside to using Backup is that if you
stop paying for .Mac, you can no longer use
this application. Back up your files with a differ-
ent system before you cut your service, or else!
Other Backup Options
If none of the preceding options are to your liking
(perhaps they’re too expensive), here are some
other backup utilities that you might appreciate:

Battling Viruses
M
ac users have always been fortunate because relatively few
viruses target the Mac operating system. Some people have com-
plained that there isn’t much software written for the Mac, but
the upside is that not many viruses are written for the Mac, either. Still,
you have to be careful.
In this technique, we tell you what you need to know about viruses, how
you can avoid getting them, and what to do if your Mac becomes infected.
We focus on using McAfee’s Virex for this purpose, but we list other
options at the end of this technique, too.
What You Should Know about Viruses
A virus is a special type of application that can make copies of itself.
Viruses can be either mere nuisances that do nothing but spread them-
selves around or malicious evildoers that try to destroy your data or cre-
ate security holes. Roughly speaking, the three kinds of viruses are

Worms are the A-list celebrities of viruses — they get all the attention.
Worms spread via e-mail applications (Outlook Express on Windows is
a particular favorite), removable media (such as CDs or Zip disks), or
network holes (open gateways into your machine; again, Windows pro-
vides for plenty of these). Every time a new worm comes out, you hear
about it in the news as it spreads around the globe, shutting down
servers and causing billions of dollars in damage.

Trojan horses pretend to provide services (like remembering your
Web passwords) but really do something else in the background (like
e-mailing your Web passwords to somebody else). Trojan horses are
spread by people downloading and installing software that they
assume to be safe.

Macro viruses use advanced features of scriptable applications as
their medium for trouble. They are attached to documents and are
activated when that document is opened. The most common macro
viruses affect the Microsoft Office suite. Simple macro viruses wreak

firewall. See Technique 41 for more information,
including how to enable firewalls on your Mac
(see Figure 50-2).
• Figure 50-2: Tiger’s built-in firewall configuration panel.

Be careful whom you give your e-mail address
to. If few people have your e-mail address, you
have less of a chance that folks send viruses to
you. It’s that simple.
Limiting the visibility of your e-mail address
minimizes the number of viruses and amount
of spam that you receive. Try to keep your
e-mail address off public message boards and
Web pages. You can also follow the antispam
suggestions from Technique 35.

Don’t open attachments to e-mails. Receiving 
a virus as an attachment to an e-mail isn’t a 
security risk. Trouble starts when you open this
attachment. If you really want to be safe, don’t
open any attachments. If you find this rule to 
be unreasonable and excessive (and it is), scan
attachments with antivirus software and abide
by the next rule.
havoc with the application in question and with
documents in that format; more troublesome
macros use your e-mail client to propagate 
themselves.
Because of the problems with macro viruses,
many applications (such as Microsoft Word,
see Figure 50-1) prompt you before enabling
the macros.
• Figure 50-1: Microsoft Word asks whether you want to
use the macros in the document being
opened.
Other operating systems have much more trouble
with viruses than Mac OS X does, but you should
still be careful. The rest of this technique shows
what you can do to limit your risk of infection and
what you can do should the worst happen.
Things You Can Do 
to Limit Viruses
The most important step for safe computing is know-
ing how not to get infected in the first place. These
are our best practices for protecting your Mac:

Use a firewall on your network. Many worms
spread through network holes. Firewalls — 
special software programs that establish bar-
riers between a computer or network and the
Internet — prevent traffic from going through
these holes. Whether you’re using a single com-
puter on a dialup connection or you’re one of a
dozen computers on a network, you can use a

Things You Can Do to Limit Viruses
393

Don’t open Visual Basic Scripts or executable
attachments in e-mails. Many Trojan horse
viruses work by posing as one thing while being
another. For example, several popular viruses
were spread as a file with the extensions
.txt.vbs or .jpg.exe. People recognized .txt
and .jpg as benign, but the .vbs (Visual Basic
Script) and .exe (executable) extensions were
actually the ones that counted. These are both
specifically Windows examples, but you get the
point.
To be safe with e-mail attachments, always try
to open them from within a specific applica-
tion rather than double-clicking them. See
Technique 25 for particular methods for open-
ing files.

Keep your antivirus software up to date. About
500 new viruses are discovered each month. If
your antivirus software is out of date, you might
as well not even have it. We discuss one popular
antivirus application, McAfee’s Virex, in the sec-
tion “Using Virex,” later in this technique.
Many virus applications, like Virex, provide for
automatic updates each time they run. This is
a very good thing (but requires an Internet
connection).

Perform daily virus scans. If you have a virus
application, run it every time you log in. Most
antivirus applications make this an option in
their preferences.

Don’t network with Windows computers. A
Windows virus can’t infect your computer, but
that doesn’t keep it from trying and trying and
trying, which can be an annoyance. If you can,
avoid networking with Windows computers. If
you must, make sure that the Windows users do
everything they must do to protect their
machine.

Be careful if you use Virtual PC. You can 
be affected by Windows viruses if you run
Windows on your Mac with Virtual PC. If you 
use it, research all the recommended security
procedures for Windows users. Then abide by
these procedures as best as possible within the
virtual environment.
One useful resource for virus and security-
related issues is the National Security Agency.
On its Web site (http://www.nsa.gov/snac),
it has dozens of thorough documents recom-
mending best security policies. The topics
cover specific operating systems, Web
browsers, applications, and more. 

Use Rules in Mail. When the next wave of
Windows worms hits, Mac users usually are
pelted with hundreds of messages. You can
establish a Rule in your Mail application to auto-
matically delete these annoyances (see Figure
50-3). Technique 35 shows you how to set up a
Rule in detail.
• Figure 50-3: Define Rules to handle annoying worms.

Turn off all Sharing tools. This goes along with
using a firewall to shut down network holes. Your
Mac comes with every Service turned off as the
default; none are turned on unless you specifi-
cally turn them on. If you turned something on
and don’t need it now, be certain to turn it off.
Services are controlled through the Sharing
System Preferences tab, which we discuss in
Techniques 40 and 41.

Don’t assume that you can trust attachments
from a familiar sender. The most successful
worms work because they use a person’s Address
Book (or Windows equivalent) to send them-
selves out to the world. John Smith receives an
e-mail from his friend, Jane Doe, so he opens the

394
Using Virex
McAfee’s Virex (www.mcafee.com) is a popular anti-
virus application, partially because it comes free with
your .Mac account (although that account costs $99
per year). Using it is simple, but using it efficiently
and effectively requires a little more thought. Here is
a recommended configuration procedure to go
through with Virex:
Some people — including one of the authors
of this book — has experienced significant
problems with the 7.5 version of Virex. Back
up your computer before installing Virex and
keep older, working versions of the Virex
installer around just in case.
1.
Open Virex by double-clicking the Virex icon
found in either the Applications or Utilities
folders.
2.
Open the Preferences panel (see Figure 50-4).
• Figure 50-4: The Virex Preferences panel.
3.
Within the Preferences panel, select the follow-
ing check boxes:

attachment, launches the virus, and inadvertently
sends it to everyone in his e-mail client’s Address
Book. Even if a friend sends you a file purpose-
fully, your friend might not know that it has a
macro virus attached to it.

Scan every file you download, borrow, take
from CD, copy from a disk, and so forth, with a
virus tool. If you have a virus application — and
you should have one — use it to scan files that
are new to your computer. Even if files come
from a reputable source, such as a CD-ROM, it
can’t hurt.

Let people know if they sent you a virus. Help
yourself by helping others. If someone sent you a
virus, she might not even know it.

Eat healthy, get regular exercise, and take your
vitamins. This keeps you from getting a virus, not
your computer, but it’s still sound advice.
Although it won’t prevent getting viruses,
keeping recent backups of your data makes it
easier to recover after a virus strikes.
Tips if you use Windows
Okay, this book is about the Mac, but you might also use
Windows on a regular basis. We all have our crosses to
bear. If you have to use Windows, here are a few quick tips
on minimizing viruses on that operating system:

Don’t use Outlook Express.

Don’t use Internet Explorer.

Turn off every feature that you don’t use.

Set Windows to display file extensions.

Use an antivirus application and keep it up to date.
One reason why Windows is less secure is that many 
applications — such as Outlook Express and Internet
Explorer — are tied into the whole operating system.
Vulnerabilities in those applications can be used to manipu-
late vulnerabilities in Windows. For both security and aes-
thetic reasons, we recommend Mozilla’s Firefox for your
Web needs and Thunderbird for e-mail. They’re both freely
available at www.mozilla.org.

Using Virex
395
 Active virus detection: This feature tells Virex
to be on the lookout for viruses that are cur-
rently running (as opposed to those that are
just on your computer).
There have been reports of the active virus
detection interfering with mounted devices
such as Palm Pilots. You might find that you
need to turn off Virex (or turn off this feature)
when syncing with a handheld or similar
device.
4.
Click the More Options button.
5.
On the More Options pane (see Figure 50-5),
select the following check boxes:
 Check files for virus-like characteristics: This
might be overkill, but it’s better for your virus
utility to be too thorough than not thorough
enough.
 Find potentially unwanted applications and
joke programs: This isn’t a security feature 
so much as a good way to get a sense of 
what applications you might no longer need.
Removing unnecessary applications saves you
hard drive space and clears up the clutter.
6.
Set the When a Virus Is Found drop-down list to
Notify.
You really don’t want Virex — or any virus 
utility — cleaning or deleting files on its own. 
Let the program notify you of potential problems,
and then use your best judgment on what to do.
One good example of why you shouldn’t have
Virex automatically clean or delete infected
files is that some people lost entire Mail mail-
boxes this way when using Virex 7.5!
7.
Click the red button in the upper-left corner to
exit the Preferences panel.
After you have Virex configured properly, it’s easy to
use effectively. To manually scan your files, follow
these steps:
• Figure 50-5: The expanded Virex Preferences panel.
1.
On the main screen (see Figure 50-6), click
where it says “Drop items or click here.” 
This brings up a standard Open/Save dialog for
you to choose a volume or directory to scan.
2.
In the resulting dialog, select your Home folder
in the leftmost column (see Figure 50-7) and
click Select Location to return to the main
screen.
3.
Click Start to begin the virus check (see
Figure 50-6).
4.
Read a good book, check your e-mail, or surf
the Web while Virex does its thing.
Virus scanning can be fairly processor-intensive,
so don’t plan on doing much while it’s working. 

Technique 50: Battling Viruses
396
With the first two options, you should probably
sneak over to the Finder and make a copy of the
original, just in case the clean messes up the file
or you might need it later (regardless of the
potential infection). 
6.
Exit the application when you finish.
Once a week or so, have Virex inspect your entire
computer. Follow the preceding steps, but select
your hard drive (or drives) instead of just the Home
folder (in Step 2).
If you use StuffIt Expander (www.aladdinsys.
com) to decompress files, you can set it to auto-
matically scan files when decompressing them.
Opt for this through the Expansion tab of the
StuffIt Preferences panel (see Figure 50-8).
• Figure 50-8: Have StuffIt Expander scan files that you
download or get from other sources.
Other Antivirus Software
We highlight using Virex as a protection tool because
it’s been a popular choice for years, and it comes
with a .Mac account (which seems like a good Apple
endorsement). But you have other options, as
always:
• Figure 50-6: The Virex main window.
• Figure 50-7: Choose an area to inspect by using this panel.
5.
If Virex reports on a virus, decide how to 
handle it.
With the notify setting on in the Preferences
panel, Virex prompts you if it finds a potentially
infected file or currently running virus. The
prompt gives you three options:
 Clean the file
 Move the file to the Trash
 Ignore it

Other Antivirus Software
397

Norton AntiVirus (www.symantec.com/nav/
nav_mac, $70): Norton AntiVirus is a solid appli-
cation and has been around for a long time. In
fact, Norton’s other applications have been inte-
gral to maintaining Macs for years. Norton
AntiVirus (NAV for short) performs live updates
of its virus definitions to stay current and cer-
tainly does the trick.

Technique
Keeping Your
Software Up 
to Date
K
eeping your operating system and applications up to date is an
important aspect of maintaining your computer. For performance,
security, and features, the little time that you spend updating soft-
ware should be considered time well spent.
We begin this technique discussing how you can update your operating
system and other Apple applications (it’s pretty simple, if you didn’t
know). Then we discuss some best practices when it comes to updating
non-Apple applications found on your computer. Finally, we go through a
few references that you can use to stay informed when updates become
available.
Using Software Update
Keeping your operating system up to date is an absolute must for these
two reasons:

It’s the only way for Apple to plug security holes. Having security
holes in your computer is a bad thing. Continuing to have security
holes after they’ve been made public is even worse.

It’s the only way for Apple to fix bugs. Nobody’s perfect, and Apple’s
no exception. The more complex a piece of software is, the more likely
it is to have bugs. Apple’s pretty good about fixing bugs, but you need
to update your software for those fixes to take effect.
The Software Update utility (see Figure 51-1) is the tool to use to perform
all operating system updates. Just select the check boxes next to the items
you want to install and then press Return to begin the process. (You’re
prompted for the administrator’s password.) Software Update has the
added benefit of updating other Apple applications as warranted, such as
iTunes and QuickTime. Although you can access this tool through System
Preferences, choosing Apple➪Software Update (see Figure 51-2) is much
faster if you want to quickly update your computer (you can run an update
at your prompting or schedule updates to occur periodically). In fact, the
Software Update panel in System Preferences (see Figure 51-3) is actually
the preferences page for the Software Update utility.

• Figure 51-1: Apple’s Software Update application makes

• Figure 51-2: Use the Apple menu to quickly access
Software Update.
Updating your software with these tools is fairly
straightforward. We recommend these settings for
the best results:

Set Software Update to run weekly. You can’t
specify a day and time for it to run, so you’re best
off choosing Weekly from the Check for Updates
drop-down list. This drop-down list is located on
the Update Software tab of the Software Update
preferences panel (see Figure 51-3). At some ran-
dom time — probably while you’re doing some-
thing critically important — Software Update
pops up and does its thing.
• Figure 51-3: Use System Preferences to adjust Software
Update settings.
Because you have to enter your password to
run any updates (and possibly click OK for a
licensing agreement), you can’t update your
OS at night or when you’re away from your
computer.

If you don’t have a high-speed Internet connec-
tion, select the Download Important Updates in
the Background check box. With this option,
also in the Software Updates preferences panel
(refer to Figure 51-3), you can continue using
your computer while the files are downloading.
Then you’re notified that the installation is ready
to take place.

Set Software Update to ignore the updates that
you don’t need. As an example, if you don’t have
an iPod, you don’t need to update your iPod soft-
ware. The same applies to applications you don’t
use. You can effectively delete anything by follow-
ing these steps:
1. Run Software Update and select the item to be
ignored in the list of updates that appears.
2. Ô-click to select multiple items (as shown in
Figure 51-4).

Technique 51: Keeping Your Software Up to Date
400
• Figure 51-4: Ô-click to select multiple installers.
3. Choose Ignore Update from the Update menu
or press Ô-Delete.
You’re prompted to confirm this action (see
Figure 51-5). Rest assured that you can access
deleted updates again later (like after you pur-
chase that iPod).
• Figure 51-5: Like emptying the Trash, ignoring updates
gives you a confirmation prompt.
4. To reactivate an update that you’ve previ-
ously deleted, choose Reset Ignored Updates
from the Software Update menu.
Doing so redisplays all ignored updates, so
you can install those you need and ignore
those you still don’t require.

If you have multiple Macs to update, opt for the
Install and Keep Package or Download Only
options. By using these methods — found on the
Update menu — you can download the new
installations once and then run them on multiple
computers. This is a good policy if you have more
than one Mac and a slow Internet connection.
If you use the Install and Keep Package update
method, you find the installed package in the
/Library/Packages folder after the installa-
tion is complete. Tiger opens this directory in a
new window for you.
Updating Other Applications
Application updaters work in two different ways:
Some modify the existing software, and others replace
it altogether. Using either of these is straightforward
(and they should come with instructions), but make
and keep a backup copy of the software before per-
forming the update just in case problems occur.
Although we’ve never personally experienced
a problem, you should back up your files
before updating any software. This is especially
true when it comes to installing major updates
to the operating system. Although unlikely, an
update gone awry can potentially wreck your
system.
Updates versus upgrades
Technically, two kinds of software changes exist for 
applications: 

Updates are normally minor version changes (like
from 7.0 to 7.0.1) that fix bugs and security holes.
These are the most important (for obvious reasons)
and should be provided for free from the application’s
manufacturer.

Upgrades are normally major version changes (like
from 6.0 to 7.0) that add features. These normally cost
you money and are a much larger download (or come
with their own CDs).
(continued)

Staying Informed about Updates
401
In this technique, we primarily focus on updates.
Although calling something an update instead of an
upgrade is largely a syntactical difference, some people
have taken issue with Apple for releasing what seems to be
an update (going from Mac OS X 10v.3 to 10v.4) and
charging $129 for it. Considering the number of features
added to each new release, Apple could just as easily
silence the critics by calling the versions Mac OS XI, XII,
and so forth. Or by not charging quite so much. . . .
Some applications come with their own updaters
built into the software. You see two general types of
built-in updaters:

Automatic updaters: For example, QuickTime
has its own updater, called QuickTime Updater.
Cocktail (www.macosxcocktail.com; see Figure
51-6), a utility that performs various system
maintenance routines, checks for newer versions
as well.
• Figure 51-6: One of the features of good applications,
such as Cocktail, is their ability to check for
updates.
Some advanced applications automatically
check for updates at set periods of time (every
two weeks, for example) or every time the
application starts.

Links to a supporting Web page: Other applica-
tions let you check for updates by taking you to
their Web sites. This isn’t as useful, but it’s an
easy way to keep your software up to date.
Be sure to create a backup of the existing ver-
sion of an application before either upgrading
or updating it. For example, many users have
had problems with the 7.5.x version of Virex.
Those who kept the installer for the earlier
7.2.x versions were able to reinstall the old,
working copy. With applications that don’t
have installers — like Fire (an IM client), you
can copy the older version to another location
before you update it. 
To find out whether an application has an updating
system built-in, check the following:

The application’s preferences panel

On the application menu

The application’s manual

The application’s Help pages (if they exist),
which are accessible through the Help menu
And, as a last resort, the manufacturer’s Web site
might list any updates.
Staying Informed about
Updates
Before you can update any software, you need to
know that an update is available. Although Apple’s
Software Update utility checks for your Apple soft-
ware, you need an easy way to keep informed for
everything else. Here are some recommended
resources to keep informed about what updates are
available:

VersionTracker (www.versiontracker.com): A
whole cult exists around VersionTracker, which
is one of the premier application information
sites around. Some fanatics check it daily to see

Technique 51: Keeping Your Software Up to Date

updates is the “security-announce” list, which
notifies you of security-related updates available
for the operating system. Sign up for this, and
you’re one of the first to know when a new patch
comes up.

Apple Developer Connection e-mails (http://
developer.apple.com): You don’t have to be a
software engineer to be a member of the ADC.
This free membership provides you with a ton of
information. You can also sign up for the ADC
update e-mail, which tells when new software or
upgrades to existing applications come out. 

Application e-mails: Many manufacturers have
mailing lists that you can sign up for that aren’t
(thankfully) spam. If you want to know when a
new version of StuffIt or BBEdit is available, sign
up at the appropriate Web site or when you reg-
ister the application. Most registration forms let
you opt-in for product updates while still opting
out of other “related” e-mails that they think you
might be interested in. (You could call this sec-
ond category “spam-like.”)
what updates are available for their favorite
applications. It’s also a great way to see what’s
new for Mac OS X and to find alternatives to
tools you’re already using. Signing up for
VersionTracker’s daily mailings is a great way to
be informed when new software or new versions
of existing software are released.
Anyone can use VersionTracker for free, but
people with a membership can take advan-
tage of more useful tools. (Membership starts
at $25 per year.)

MacUpdate (www.macupdate.com): MacUpdate is
similar to VersionTracker but is completely free.
The site e-mails you when particular applications
are updated and lets you create custom watch
lists to track your favorite software.

Apple mailing lists (http://lists.apple.com):
Apple maintains a number of mailing lists for var-
ious subjects. Almost all of them have a moder-
ate amount of traffic, so signing up shouldn’t
overwhelm your inbox. Most important for

Securing Files
S
ecurity comes in many forms: for example, the security issues
involved with Internet transactions, or the physical security of mak-
ing sure that someone can’t steal or physically tamper with your
computer. You also face the issue of protecting your passwords (see
Technique 53). This particular technique is all about securing individual
files and folders on your computer. If your computer never leaves the
house, this might not be a concern, but if you work in an office or travel
with your Mac, protecting sensitive documents is critical.
The primary tool for this is FileVault. In this technique, we show you how
to use that utility most efficiently. Then we show you some other popular
shareware options, just in case FileVault isn’t sufficient for your needs.
Finally, we let you in on the Secure Empty Trash feature, which allows
you to safely (and permanently) delete files.
Making the Most of FileVault
FileVault is a new technology that was added in Panther and is still alive
and well in Tiger. FileVault makes use of a 128-bit version of the Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt your stuff. (Encryption is the
process of translating data into an unreadable form, requiring a pass-
word or similar key to make it legible again.) After you enable FileVault, it
encrypts and decrypts the contents of your Home directory while you
work, meaning that you automatically have this security without needing
to constantly manage the process.
If you use FileVault, make sure that you store everything within your
Home directory. Anything kept elsewhere isn’t protected!
Keeping unencrypted copies of your stuff and storing it in a secure
location is prudent. For example, you could routinely back up your
Home directory to CDs or an external hard drive and place those in a
home safe or underneath your mattress. (Well, we’re just kidding
about the mattress, but you get the idea.)

You use the master password to control access
to every encrypted Home directory on the com-

both the master password and the user’s login
password.
If you lose or forget your master password and
your login password, you’re up a creek without

After reading the warning, click the Turn on
FileVault button (which appears in a prompt).
The dialog shown in Figure 52-4 appears to warn
you of the consequences of forgetting your master
password. (It doesn’t bode well for you if you’ve
already forgotten the password.)
• Figure 52-4: The very stern warning reminds you to
remember your password.
9.
Log back in after FileVault finishes doing its
thing.
FileVault logs you out and then spends a few min-
utes encrypting your Home directory. How long
this takes depends on the size of your Home
directory.
While you’re in the FileVault control panel (refer to
Figure 52-2), consider selecting the check boxes for
these other security features, too:

Require Password to Wake This Computer from
Sleep or Screen Saver

Disable Automatic Login

Require Password to Unlock Each Secure System
Preference

Log Out After x Minutes of Inactivity
Each of these features makes your computer more
secure but also slightly more tedious to work with. 
If you’re the only one who uses your computer and
it’s in a safe place, leave the check boxes cleared. If
you have sensitive data on your computer, keep your
Mac in an environment where others can access it —
or just generally want the peace of mind — enable
these options.
Other Encryption Tools
FileVault is built into Tiger, exhaustive in its cover-
age (your entire Home directory) and self managing.
But it has its downsides, too. If FileVault doesn’t
exactly float your boat, you can use a number of
other applications to encrypt and decrypt files. Here
we provide you with some assistance in finding the
right security tool for your situation.
One of the downsides of FileVault is that it
slows down your computer when you’re work-
ing with files in your Home directory. If you’d
rather not bog down your computer or if you
require only certain things to be protected,
use one of the other pieces of software that
we discuss in this section of the chapter.
Disk Utility
Apple’s Disk Utility helps you manage discs (like
burnable CDs), hard drives, and disk images. This
last category, in case you aren’t familiar with it, is a
file that can be stored anywhere (on your hard drive
or on a CD). When you need to work with the disk
image’s contents, you mount it like any other disc,
then open, add, and delete files as needed. For secu-
rity purposes, Disk Utility allows you to create
encrypted disk images by using the same encryption
protocol as FileVault. Disk Utility has a couple neat
features:

You can make the disk image’s contents accessi-
ble only when you need them. 

You can store in the disk image only those files
that must be encrypted. (For example, you 
can save time and space by not encrypting the
8GB of music on your hard drive, as FileVault
would do.)

Technique 52: Securing Files
406
 Select AES-128 in the Encryption drop-down
list.
This is the key step in making a secure disk
image.
 Leave Read/Write Disk Image selected in the
Format drop-down list.
4.
Click the Create button.
5.
At the prompt (see Figure 52-6), enter a pass-
word twice and then click OK.
• Figure 52-6: This password allows access to the disk
image and its files.
If you store the disk image password in your
keychain, you can open it without entering the
password. This means that anyone else with
access to your computer can open it, too. You
have to decide between optimal security and
more convenience here.
6.
Copy files to the mounted disk image.
The disk image is automatically mounted by the
operating system. You can now use it like any
other disk or folder.
7.
Eject the disk when you’re finished with it.
When you need to access the files, remount the disk
image by double-clicking on it.
To use Disk Utility
1.
Open Disk Utility by double-clicking its icon in
the Utilities folder.
2.
Choose File➪New➪Blank Disk Image.
3.
In the resulting dialog (see Figure 52-5), make
the following selections:
• Figure 52-5: The prompt for creating a disk image.
 Give the disk image a name in the Save As 
text box.
Don’t use a give-away name like Bank Account
Info. Instead, give your disk image a creative
name that doesn’t indicate its purpose. Doing
so helps make important information seem less
appealing (or entirely unappealing) to would-be
snoops. On the other hand, if you’re likely to
forget that the disk image named Brautigan
Thesis is actually your bank information, use a
meaningful name and trust that the encryption
safely protects your data.
 Decide where to save the image and set the
location in the Where drop-down list.
 Select an appropriate size from the Size drop-
down list.
The size of your disk image is a cap on how
much information it can store. It’s also how
much room the file takes on your hard drive,
so choose this value wisely.

StuffIt
If you pay for the full version of Aladdin System’s
StuffIt (www.stuffit.com, $80), you can create
encrypted StuffIt and Zip archives. A password is
required to access the archives’ contents. If you
already have and use this application, then it’s an
easy choice for protecting important files.
Mac GNU Privacy Guard
Mac GNU Privacy Guard (http://macgpg.
sourceforge.net, free) is a free implementation of
the popular Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) software. It
provides a framework for using PGP within other
applications, such as Mail, Entourage, or Eudora. It
requires a little bit of configuration and work on
your part, but the price is right.
PGP
This is the commercial version of PGP software
(www.pgp.com, $50), which you can use to encrypt
your e-mail and create secure disk images. It isn’t
free, but it’s easier to get started with than the Mac
GNU Privacy Guard.
SubRosaSoft and CodeTek Studios
Both SubRosaSoft (www.subrosasoft.com) and
CodeTek Studios (www.codetek.com) develop numer-
ous security-related products, including larger scale
packages. For example, CodeTek’s SafeData
Technology Suite ($50) cleans out your Internet his-
tory, encrypts and decrypts files, and securely
trashes files.
Using the Finder’s Secure 
Empty Trash Option
Most computer users think that once they’ve deleted
a file, that it no longer exists but this is not truly the
case. What most operating systems do is delete the
reference to the file but leave the actual file data on
your hard drive until later actions happen to over-
write it. Thus, a normal Empty Trash command has
little to no security benefit.
Tiger’s Secure Empty Trash option was introduced in
Panther. You find it under the Finder menu (see
Figure 52-7). Secure Empty Trash deletes files by
writing over the file data on the hard drive before
deleting the file’s reference. Think of it like pouring
ink on a piece of paper, crumpling it, putting it inside
a bag, and then throwing the bag away.
Unlike with the normal Empty Trash com-
mand, you can’t recover a file from Secure
Empty Trash. For this reason,  double-check
the contents of the Trash before proceeding
with a Security Empty Trash. (You can see
what’s in the Trash by clicking its icon in the
Dock.)
• Figure 52-7: Secure Empty Trash provides a level of
security that the Department of Defense
would endorse (literally).

Watch the Trash progress bar in action.
Secure Empty Trash takes much longer than the
standard method. This makes sense, considering
the many extra steps taking place behind the
scenes.
This feature is nice, but most snoops don’t
know how to recover data that has been
deleted through the standard Empty Trash
anyway. The Secure Empty Trash option is
great if you either have truly sensitive data to
delete or fear that a particularly geeky snoop
might get hold of your computer. Otherwise,
save yourself some time by sticking to the
standard Empty Trash.
This feature is pretty easy to use. Just follow these
steps:
1.
Trash a file by either
 Moving it to the Trash 
 Pressing Ô-Delete after selecting it
2.
Choose Secure Empty Trash from the Finder
menu.
3.
Click OK at the prompt.
If you’d rather not see the “Are you sure?”
warning, clear the Show Warning Before
Emptying the Trash check box under the
Finder’s Advanced preferences panel (see
Figure 52-8) or hold down the Option key
while selecting Secure Empty Trash (or Empty
Trash) from the Finder menu.
• Figure 52-8: Clear the Show Warning check box if you

Save Time By
 Creating a secure 
password
 Getting the most out of
Apple’s Keychain Access
 Changing your login 
password
Proper Password
Policy
T
he security of your computer partially depends on the passwords
you use to log in, access Web sites, and encrypt files. The first step
is to choose good, secure passwords. The second step is to use
Apple’s keychain technology to manage your passwords for you. Finally,
you need to know how to change your login password.
To improve both the convenience and security of using your computer,
the Mac OS X operating system uses keychains: virtual places to store and
retrieve sensitive information. The first time you use any key (a password
required by a file or encrypted disk image, your .Mac account information,
or login values used by Web sites), you can opt — through a prompt or
check box — to store that information in the keychain. The passwords
and such are kept in a secure format so that they aren’t easily viewable.
Your keychain (the collection of all of your keys) is unlocked when you log
in to your Mac, and the different keys are then automatically used as
needed. (For example, when you revisit a Web site or attempt to open a
password-protected file, the proper values are entered for you.) Although
Tiger handles all of this seamlessly, Tiger’s Keychain Access utility gives
you more specific control over your keys and keychains.
Creating a Good Password
Good security begins with selecting good, secure passwords. There are
specific recommendations when coming up with your passwords. Here is
the party line on the subject:
Good passwords use

Both letters and numbers

Both uppercase (capital) and lowercase letters

At least eight characters

A combination of symbols and punctuation, if allowed

Technique 53: Proper Password Policy
410
 Don’t keep it in your wallet.
 Don’t indicate what the password is for.
If you have trouble creating your own pass-
words, use the Password Assistant (see Figure
53-1), which you can get to by clicking the
question mark when changing your Login
password (see later in this chapter). The
Password Assistant offers suggestions of good,
secure passwords. Because these passwords
are random, they’re even more secure than
something you thought up!
• Figure 53-1: Tiger’s brand new Password Assistant utility
does the thinking for you.
Working with Apple’s 
Keychain Access
Mac OS X’s main tool for managing passwords is
Keychain Access (see Figure 53-2), found in the
Utilities folder. This application stores and retrieves
your passwords, including those used by

Web sites

E-mail accounts

FileVault

iChat

.Mac accounts

Encrypted disk images

Wireless networks

Servers
If those policies help generate good passwords, what
is it that you shouldn’t do? Well, check out this list:

Don’t use words that are in a dictionary.

Don’t use passwords that people can easily
guess, such as 
 Names of your pets, children, or spouse
 Digits from your phone number, address,
birthday, or Social Security number

Don’t use the same password for multiple things.
The most important consideration is that your
login password is unique. Make your login
password distinct from the root user’s pass-
word, if one has been set.
The problem with these rules is that they can make
remembering your passwords impossible. So what
can you really do?

Use the Keychain Access to remember your
passwords. See “Working with Apple’s Keychain
Access” later in this technique for more.

Use the first letters of the words in a phrase to
come up with a password. Just like you used the
mnemonic Roy G. Biv to memorize the colors of
the rainbow, you can take a phrase and create an
abbreviation to create a memorable password.
For example, the abbreviation for the phrase
Larry Ullman and Marc Liyanage wrote a book
together creates the password LUaMLwabt. This
makes for a pretty decent password, and it isn’t
impossible to recall.

Take existing words and add numbers and
punctuation. For example, you can take the word
original and turn it into 0r!gina_L. This password
uses upper- and lowercase letters, a number, and
punctuation.

Write down important passwords and store
them securely. If you forget your login password,
you’re in trouble. If you must write down pass-
words to prevent disaster, 
 Don’t post it on your monitor.
 Don’t leave it in a desk drawer.

Working with Apple’s Keychain Access
411
• Figure 53-2: The Keychain Access tool makes password
management easy.
Check out Technique 62 for how you can use
the Security panel to require passwords to
access your computer after it’s been sleeping,
idle, and so forth.
Tiger uses the keychain automatically, so there’s lit-
tle you need to do to enable it. However, note these
best policies here:

Use Keychain Access as much as possible. This
is a good, secure application, designed to make
your life easier. Take advantage of this!

Make a very secure login password. The key-
chain uses your login password as its master
password. If someone can get into your com-
puter and guess your master password, he can
then get access to all your other passwords.

Regularly back up the keychain database. The
keychains are stored in your ~/Library/
Keychains directory. They’re automatically
backed up if you back up your entire Home direc-
tory, or you can manually move the files from
there to a CD or a USB thumbnail drive (a small,
portable hard drive).
The Backup application that comes with a
.Mac account ($99 per year) automatically
presents your keychain database as an option
to back up. See Technique 49.

Use the keychain menu bar tool. If you do a lot
with keychains, choose Show Status in Menu Bar
from the Keychain Access General preferences
panel. This creates a menu bar shortcut to 
keychain-related tasks (see Figure 53-3).
• Figure 53-3: Make the most of Keychain Access by using
the menu bar tool.

Change the keychain settings for improved
security. Your keychain automatically unlocks
when you log in and then remains unlocked. This
can be a security risk, particularly if others have
access to your computer when you step away. To
change this behavior, go to the First Aid prefer-
ences panel and deselect all but the top box (see
Figure 53-4). Now you have to manually unlock
your keychain when you want to access it.
• Figure 53-4: Change a keychain’s settings for heightened
security.

When prompted, grant applications permission
to always allow access to the keychain. When
an application needs to access the keychain, you
see a prompt that lets you choose to deny this,
allow this once, or always allow this action. You
might as well always allow this so that you won’t
have to worry about it in the future.

itself. To later view the contents of any note, just fol-
low these steps:
1.
Open the Keychain Access application.
2.
Click Secure Notes in the Category column (see
Figure 53-6).
When you select a category, you see all the key-
chain items for that category. When you click
once on any individual item, you see its informa-
tion in the top half of the window. This includes
the item’s name and modification date. At this
point, you can’t see any of the secure values them-
selves (such as a note’s contents or a password).
• Figure 53-6: The list of secure notes.
3.
Double-click the note’s name in the list of key-
chain items.
4.
In the resulting window, select the Show Note
check box.
5.
Enter your keychain password at the prompt
and click Allow Once (see Figure 53-7).
The Keychain Access password is the same
value as your login password, unless you’ve
changed the Keychain Access password 
separately.
You can also use your keychain to store sensitive
data, such as your ATM PIN or credit card informa-
tion, by creating a Note. This is a more secure option
than placing such information in a plain text file or a
sticky note. With the Keychain Access utility, you
can encrypt and protect any little tidbit you want.

2.
If your keychain is currently locked, unlock it.
You can do this in three ways:
 Click the Lock icon in the upper-left corner.
 Choose File➪Unlock Keychain KeychainName.
 Press Ô-L.
At the resulting prompt, enter your keychain
password — which should be the same as your
login password — and press Return.
3.
Select File➪New Secure Note.

Using Open Firmware Password
To really protect your computer, use of the Open Firmware
Password utility. If you enable this feature, people can’t access
your computer by booting from another volume. This also
means that you need to enter this password to boot from 
a CD-ROM or even zap your PRAM (the process of resetting
your computer’s special parameter memory, which is some-
times required to fix erratic behavior). The basic steps, which
are detailed at http://docs.info.apple.com/article.
html?artnum=106482, are
1.
Make sure that your computer supports Open
Firmware Password (see the Web page).
2.
Download the installer.
3.
Install the Open Firmware Password application.
4.
Open the application.
5.
Enable the Require Password to Change Open
Firmware Settings option.
6.
Enter the password twice.
7.
Click OK.
8.
Quit the application.
Changing the Login Password
Routinely changing your login password is a smart
security policy. Some operating systems prompt you
to do this every so many months, although Mac OS X
does not. (It’s a nice security check, but it’s kind of
an inconvenience, too.)
To change your login password
1.
Open System Preferences.
2.
Click the Accounts icon, under the System
heading.
3.
Select your account from the list in the left col-
umn (see Figure 53-9).
• Figure 53-9: Change your login password in the Accounts
System Preferences panel.

At the prompt (see Figure 53-10), enter 
 Your current password
 The new password
 A verification of the new password
• Figure 53-10: The Change Password prompt.
6.
Click Change Password.
When you change your login password, Tiger
also changes your Keychain Access password.
If these aren’t the same, your keychain isn’t
unlocked when you log in.
Resetting the administrator’s password
If you forget the administrator’s password, you still have some
hope: The Mac OS X Installation discs let you reset this value.
Boot your computer from the first installation CD. When the
installer begins, choose Reset Administrative Password from
the Installer menu and follow the prompts.

Useful Utilities
A
big part of using your Mac effectively is choosing and using the 
right tool for the job. In this book, we discuss a variety of software
options, most of them as a means to a timesaving end. But some
applications don’t fit neatly into the predefined categories or otherwise
merit their own consideration. In this technique, we go over the benefits —
both timesaving and cosmetic — of using a couple more utilities.
Special attention is first given to TinkerTool, one of the best free applica-
tions around. Then we mention CronniX, a graphical user interface to the
cron scheduling utility. After that, we introduce you to some good main-
tenance tools. Finally, we give brief notice to a smattering of other soft-
ware worthy of your consideration.
Working with TinkerTool
TinkerTool, which we mention in other techniques of this book because
it’s so helpful, is available from www.bresink.de/osx/TinkerTool.html for
free. TinkerTool has been consistently developed over the years, and
considering its cost — free! — you have no reason to ignore it. Some of
the best features of TinkerTool are the abilities to

Show hidden files in the Finder

Automating Tasks with cron
One of the cool technologies built into UNIX is cron, a
command-line utility for scheduling actions. Seasoned
UNIX users define a crontab: a list of what actions
your operating system should take and at what times.
The cron daemon (a perpetually running process)
calls the commands set in the crontab when the time
is right. You can control all this from the Terminal
(see the “Using cron in the Terminal” sidebar), but 
the easiest way to control cron is to use CronniX
(http://h5197.serverkompetenz.net/cronnix, free).
Some example uses of cron are 

Scheduling backups

Accessing Web pages

Performing maintenance

Retrieving stock quotes

Scheduling interactions with databases
The CronniX utility also lets you view the system
crontab file (see Figure 54-3) and provides an inter-
face for scheduling your own actions. If you need to
take advantage of the cron service, you’d be crazy
not to use CronniX. Even if you just want to keep
your Mac running well, CronniX can come in handy.
• Figure 54-3: The operating system runs these commands
between 3 and 5 a.m.

Add a pair of arrows to both ends of a 
scroll bar

Set system fonts (see Figure 54-2)
• Figure 54-2: Use TinkerTool to set different system 
fonts.
TinkerTool doesn’t really do anything in its
own right. What it really does is provide a
graphical interface for changing system and
application settings that are otherwise difficult
to tweak. For this reason, the features of
TinkerTool depend on the features of the Mac
OS X operating system.
Some of these features are merely cosmetic, but oth-
ers are very practical. 
The popularity of TinkerTool has spurred its creator
to break it into two products: TinkerTool (free) and
TinkerTool System (approximately $10). The free ver-
sion is for personalizing your own account settings,
which is all most Mac users need. The System version
can make system-wide alterations and is oriented
more towards advanced Mac users, like network
administrators. In this book, including this technique,
we focus on the free version, which is what you most
likely want. If you’re an IT professional, setting up
Macs in multi-user environments, you might appreci-
ate the different features that TinkerTool System pro-
vides at a rather inconsequential price.

Automating Tasks with cron
417
As an example, your Mac relies on privileges in order
to properly deny or allow access to files. These privi-
leges can become muddled, having undesirable
results. Fortunately, you can easily fix the permis-
sions by running the Disk Utility’s Repair Disk
Permissions tool (under the First Aid tab). But how
are you to remember to do this? By letting CronniX
do it for you, of course! Follow these steps:
1.
Open CronniX. 
After you install CronniX, you can double-click
its icon to open it.
2.
Choose the appropriate crontab with which
you’d like to work.
You can establish crons for any user and which
crontab you edit affects what commands can
actually be executed. For a command to run on
an administrative level (like fixing the disk per-
missions), choose File➪Open System Crontab.
CronniX opens the current user’s (that is, your)
crontab by default. Many commands, like
accessing a Web page or performing a back
up, can be executed through your crontab so
there’s no need to open the System crontab
file.
3.
Click New.
The Schedule prompt appears.
4.
In the Schedule prompt, set these parameters:
 Hour and minute 
Figure 54-4 shows 0 as the minute and 12 as
the hour, so this task runs at noon.
 Date and month
We don’t want to limit this task to a date or
month, so we select the Any check box.
 Day of the week 
To run this task every Wednesday, select We.
• Figure 54-4: Scheduling a new automated task.
5.
Enter the command to be run in the command
box.
To run the Disk Utility’s Repair Disk Permissions
command on the whole hard drive, enter the fol-
lowing code 
diskutil repairPermissions /
The slash indicates that the repair should be
applied to the entire drive.
6.
Click New.
You now see the command added to the list of
scheduled tasks.
7.
Save the added task as part of the crontab by
pressing Ô-S.
8.
Enter the administrator’s password at the
prompt.
Because the added task runs as the administra-
tor, you need to authenticate yourself.
9.
Quit CronniX by pressing Ô-Q.

Performing Maintenance
For improved performance and free hard drive
space, check out some of the many utilities available
for routine maintenance. Most of these utilities do
the tasks scheduled as a system cron (refer to Figure
54-3) as part of their feature-set. These tasks include
things like cleaning out log files and caches. But
because those tasks often aren’t run — due to their
late schedule — or just to take a more hands-on
approach to maintenance, consider the following
two applications:

MacJanitor (http://personalpages.tds.net/
~brian_hill/macjanitor.html, free): MacJanitor
gives you a nice interface for performing the
scheduled maintenance tasks that your Mac
wants to do late at night (while you’re computer
is off). Running this application on your own (see
Figure 54-5) can help clear up some hard drive
space and perk up an otherwise sluggish Mac.
Brian Hill, maker of MacJanitor, has a number
of other good utilities available at his Web 
site (http://personalpages.tds.net/
~brian_hill). These include Pseudo ($15), for
running applications as another, more privi-
leged user; Launcher ($15), a file, application,
and directory opening tool; and xFiles ($20), 
a sophisticated tool for changing a file’s 
properties.

Cocktail (www.macosxcocktail.com, $15):
Cocktail does what MacJanitor does (running
system maintenance utilities) and more. It also
cron works only if the computer is on. If you
have a task scheduled to run at three in the
morning and your Mac is always off at that
time, the task never runs. To work around this,
you can use the free utility Anacron (www.
alastairs-place.net/anacron.html). It
remembers tasks and runs them as needed
(for example, if something was supposed to
happen at 3 a.m. and your computer just came
on at 8 a.m., the command will be run then).
Using cron in the Terminal
The cron utility uses the information stored in the
crontab file to know what commands to run when. You
can edit the crontab file in your default text editor by typ-
ing crontab -e in the Terminal.  Here’s the syntax for each
crontab entry’s time, date, day, and command:
minutes hours dates months days command
For example, the command entered into CronniX looks like
this in a crontab file:
0 12 * * 3 diskutil repairPermissions /
The time/date/day values in each crontab entry follow
these rules:

Each value is separated by a space.

Values are entered as integer numbers (days are num-
bers from 0 to 6 so Sunday is 0; months are num-
bered from 1-12).

Range values are joined by a hyphen. 
For example, if you want a command to run from
January through April, the month value is 1-4.

Multiple entries for the same value are joined with
commas. 
For example, if you want a command to run at 5, 6, 7,
and 9 a.m., the hour value can be either 5,6,7,9 or
5-7,9.

An asterisk indicates that you want the command to
run for each possible value. 
For example, If the minute value is *, the command
runs every minute (60 times) for each hour that the
crontab entry is active.

lets you tweak network settings, adjust the hid-
den Finder and Dock options such as TinkerTool,

Other Useful Utilities
Without covering their usage in detail, we mention a
few more popular and useful utilities. Although not
every user needs every one of these, you’re bound
to discover something that you didn’t know existed,
which might really improve how you use your com-
puter. For example, as great as Dashboard is, its
functionality has been available to Konfabulator
users for years. For another example, Marc is a huge
fan of gestures, a foreign concept to even the very
attentive Mac user.

Pacifist (www.charlessoft.com, $20): Pacifist lets
you access specific files and folders from package
installers. This is very useful if you know you need
a particular item but don’t want to reinstall all the
software again. If you’d like to get one file from
one of Apple’s huge installers, Pacifist can really
simplify and hasten that process.
CharlesSoft also makes a free product called
DockDisks, which adds mounted disks
(CD-ROMs, DVDs, disk images, and so on) to
your Dock. With this tool, you can access
mounted disks without going to the Desktop.

Cocoa Gestures (www.bitart.com, free): Cocoa
Gestures is a clever little tool that lets you associ-
ate actions with mouse movements. For example,
you could set it so that when you Option-click a
file and move up your mouse, the Get Info panel
appears. Marc uses Cocoa Gestures to associate
mouse movements with the Back and Forward
Safari buttons. The Cocoa Gestures functionality
is far more useful than you might imagine, and its
free price makes it worth trying. If you like Cocoa
Gestures, bitart Consulting also offers the $30
CocoaSuite, with many, many added features,
including the ability to
 Turn your laptop’s trackpad into a virtual
scroll wheel.
 Change existing menu shortcuts in 
applications.
 Quickly run AppleScripts.

Konfabulator (www.konfabulator.com, $25):
Konfabulator is an application that runs widgets
(little segments of code designed to perform spe-
cific tasks) written in JavaScript. Even if you
don’t write JavaScript code, you can download
hundreds of widgets at the Konfabulator Web
site. Looking at a random sample of the widgets,
you see that different widgets can
 Download stock quotes
 Get weather reports
 Act as clocks or alarm clocks
 Provide you with simple games to play
 Manage To-Do lists
If you’re thinking that this all sounds quite simi-
lar to Dashboard, it is (which indicates how use-
ful Konfabulator is). The price might seem a little
high — particularly when you have Dashboard —
but the widgets are free, so $25 buys many, many
tools at once. 
Until people develop more Dashboard widgets,
Konfabulator might still be the best option
around.

Controlling
Cellphones with
Bluetooth
M
ac OS X includes extensive support for Bluetooth, which is a wire-
less networking standard. Many new Macintosh computers now
have Bluetooth hardware built in. It’s an exciting and versatile
technology. In this technique, we show several examples of how Bluetooth
can help you save time.
Many new cellphones are Bluetooth-enabled. With a bit of configuration,
your computer and your cellphone can talk to each other and exchange
data. This one-time setup procedure is what we look at first. We also 
take you on a tour of the things that you can do with Apple’s Bluetooth-
compatible applications, and then we highlight some useful third-party
applications.
What Is Bluetooth?
Bluetooth (www.bluetooth.com) is a wireless communications protocol
used to connect up to seven compatible devices to each other within a
limited range, usually less than 30 feet. Designed to be small and inexpen-
sive, integration into today’s digital entertainment and communications
gadgets is technically and economically feasible. The list of Bluetooth-
enabled devices now includes mobile phones, portable music players,
digital cameras, printers, laptops, PDAs, and even computer mice and
keyboards.
Because it doesn’t require a clear line of sight between the communicat-
ing devices, Bluetooth is more convenient than infrared connections. You
can leave your mobile phone in your pocket and still use it to connect to
the Internet with a PDA or receive a phone call on your headset.
Bluetooth is designed for lower cost and more versatility than the AirPort/
802.11x family of wireless networking protocols (WiFi and its cousins). You
use Bluetooth to connect your computer to small communications and
entertainment devices; AirPort connects your computer to other com-
puters on a network.

Technique 55: Controlling Cellphones with Bluetooth
424
If you know that you have Bluetooth but it isn’t
active on your Mac or your cellphone, follow these
recommendations:

If your Mac uses a USB Bluetooth adaptor, make
sure it has a good connection:
 Unplug and replug it.
 Make sure that it’s seated firmly in the USB
port.
 Try another USB port (preferably one directly
on the computer).

If your cellphone isn’t available, it might need dif-
ferent settings. Make sure that
 Bluetooth is enabled on the phone.
Bluetooth is often automatically disabled by
cellphones when it is not being used (to save
battery time).
 The phone is in Discoverable mode (either
permanently or just for the next few minutes).
These settings vary for each manufacturer, so
check the phone’s menu options or documenta-
tion for information or specific details.
Setting Up Your Connection
The Bluetooth control panel is where you set up the
connection between the computer and phone. This
process — pairing two devices — is a security fea-
ture to assure that nobody can interact with your
Bluetooth equipment without you knowing it.
To set up the connection between your Mac and
your phone:
1.
On your Mac, open the Bluetooth control panel
and click the Devices tab (see Figure 55-2).
2.
Click the Set Up New Device button.
The Bluetooth Setup Assistant launches. 
3.
Click the Continue button to start.
Bluetooth has a slower speed and shorter
range than AirPort/802.11x.
If you want to find out more about it, start by visit-
ing Apple’s Bluetooth Web site at www.apple.com/
bluetooth.
Getting Started with Bluetooth
To follow the steps in this technique, both your com-
puter and cellphone need to be Bluetooth-enabled.
You have a couple Bluetooth options with Macs.

If you use a recent Mac (such as an aluminum-
series PowerBook), it probably includes every-
thing you need for Bluetooth communications.

If your Mac doesn’t have built-in Bluetooth hard-
ware, you have to use a USB Bluetooth adapter.
This is a tiny device that plugs into the USB port.
(Apple sells these devices for about $50 in the
Apple Store. See Figure 55-1.)
You can determine whether your computer’s
Bluetooth system is working by checking the
Bluetooth system control panel in the Hardware 
section of System Preferences. If a problem exists,
the Bluetooth Device Name is displayed as Not
Available.
• Figure 55-1: A USB Bluetooth adapter, manufactured by
D-Link.

and then click Continue.
• Figure 55-3: Select your Bluetooth device type.
5.
On the Bluetooth Mobile Phone Set Up screen,
select your phone from the list, and then click
Continue (see Figure 55-4).
A numeric passkey appears (see Figure 55-5).
If your device doesn’t appear in the list, make
sure that it’s still in Discoverable mode and that
it’s within a short distance of your computer.
• Figure 55-4: Searching for devices in range.
• Figure 55-5: The Setup Assistant generates a passkey.
6.
Tell your cellphone how to connect to your Mac. 
If your cellphone is on and Bluetooth is enabled,
your cellphone should recognize that a Bluetooth
signal is coming from your Mac. After it does . . .
a. When the phone asks how to pair the two
devices, select the Add to Paired option (see
Figure 55-6).
The specifics for your device might be slightly
different, but basically you need to tell the
device to accept the request coming from
your Mac.

8.
If you want to use your cellphone to provide 
an Internet connection, enter the Internet 
connection settings that you want to use (see
Figure 55-9).
Ask your mobile carrier or ISP for this informa-
tion if you don’t know it. 
Leave the fields empty if you don’t plan to use
the Internet connectivity. 
If you don’t plan to use Internet connectivity
on your cellphone,  leave the Access the
Internet option (see Figure 55-8) selected —
just leave the fields blank (as in Figure 55-9).
Some of the tricks that we show you won’t
work unless the phone is configured for
Internet access even if you won’t actually use
the phone for this purpose.

Click Continue.
You’re finished setting up the connection (see
Figure 55-10).

Working with Your Address Book
427
• Figure 55-10: See your list of known devices after
successful pairing.
Working with Your 
Address Book
The most elegant and useful features of Bluetooth
are in Apple’s Address Book application. 
To use these features most effectively, always keep
all Address Book entries up to date, especially the
mobile phone numbers. 
Tell the Address Book to look for your mobile
phone. Click the little Bluetooth button near
the upper-left corner of the window (see Fig-
ure 55-11; look for the angular capital B). The
button should turn blue — now you’re ready
to use your cellphone from within Address
Book.
Dialing from within Address Book
To call somebody directly from within the person’s
Address Book entry, just follow these steps:
1.
Click the category word (such as mobile or
work) to the left of the phone number that you
want to dial (see Figure 55-11).
A pop-up menu appears.
• Figure 55-11: Click the Bluetooth button to use it with
the application.
2.
Select the Dial With option. 
Your cellphone should now dial the number.
Using the Address Book to call people is much
faster than dialing the cellphone itself.
Display incoming call alerts
If you keep the Address Book open and connected 
to your phone in the background, it pops up a small
dialog if somebody calls you (see Figure 55-12).
Usually you just pick up the phone and accept the
call as usual (or click the Answer button). If you
can’t take the call, you can use one of the other
options offered by the dialog:

Voice Mail forwards the call to your voice mail-
box so the caller can leave a message there.

SMS Reply rejects the call and allows you to send
a short text message to the caller’s cellphone
(like “I’m in a meeting right now, will call back”).

Log Call adds a short entry to the Notes section
of the person’s card in the Address Book.

If the incoming cellphone number isn’t yet known
in the Address Book, an Add Card button lets
you add a new card in the Address Book for the
calling person.

Technique 55: Controlling Cellphones with Bluetooth

1. Click the Reply button.
An empty text field appears.
2. Type your message. 
3. Click Send (see Figure 55-14).
• Figure 55-14: Writing the SMS reply.

To send a new message, follow these steps:
1. Open the Address Book.
2. Find the person’s card to whom you want to
send the message.
3. Click the Mobile category label to the left of
the mobile phone number.
4. Choose SMS Message from the pop-up menu
that appears (see Figure 55-15).
• Figure 55-15: Use the pop-up menu to send an SMS.
5. Type your text into the field that appears and
then click Send.
• Figure 55-12: An incoming call alert.
Sending and receiving SMS messages
SMS stands for Short Message Service. It’s available
on some advanced cellular networks. Using SMS, a
short alphanumeric message of up to 160 characters
can be sent to a cellphone. The receiving device 
displays the message and allows you to respond.
Replacing the functionality that people used to get
from pagers, SMS messaging is much like Instant
Messaging over a phone.
If you use your cellphone to send text messages, you
know how awkward and annoying typing them on 
a tiny phone keypad can be. Address Book lets you
send and reply to text messages with the comfort of
your computer keyboard.

If someone sends you a new message and
Address Book is hooked up to the phone, your
computer displays the text in a pop-up window
(see Figure 55-13). To reply:
• Figure 55-13: An incoming SMS.

Synchronizing with iSync
429
Your Mac has a much better keyboard than
the phone’s 10-digit keypad! Use your Mac
when you can.
Dialing Your Phone from 
a Text Selection
You can download a great little (and free!) applica-
tion called T68iDialer that dials phone numbers 
that you select in any piece of text. For example, if
you find a phone number on the contact page of a
company’s Web site, T68iDialer lets you select that
phone number with the mouse and then dial it imme-
diately on your cellphone. How cool is that?
This program currently works with the T39m, T68m,
or T68i Ericsson cellphones. It might work with oth-
ers, and because it’s free, you can try it with no com-
mitment. As of this writing, we don’t know of a similar
utility for other cellphones, but they’re bound to
come along sooner or later.
T68iDialer publishes a service to accomplish its
function. (See Technique 29 on Services for more
information about how Services work.)
Here’s how to try out the T68iDialer:
1.
Download the latest version from www.
macupdate.com/info.php/id/8913.
2.
Move the application into the Applications
folder.
3.
Log out of your Mac and log back in.
4.
Launch any program that supports Services.
Mail is a good choice because many e-mail mes-
sages end with a signature that includes phone
numbers.
5.
Select a phone number and choose Mail➪
Services➪Dial Number (see Figure 55-16).
T68iDialer launches (if it isn’t already running)
and inserts the phone number into the corre-
sponding field in its main window.
• Figure 55-16: Select a phone number in any application
and choose the Dial Number Service.
6.
Click Dial to dial the number (see Figure 55-17).
• Figure 55-17: The dialer window.
Enable the Service Dial Immediately option in
the program’s preferences. That way, you don’t
have to click the Dial button anymore. Instead,
T68iDialer dials the selected number as soon as
you choose the Service menu command.
Synchronizing with iSync
Bluetooth-equipped cellphones usually have an
Address Book and a Calendar. Some of these phones
can be synchronized with the Address Book and 
iCal data on your computer with Apple’s iSync 
application.

Technique 55: Controlling Cellphones with Bluetooth
430
• Figure 55-18: Adding a new device to iSync.
3.
Double-click the phone to add it to iSync’s list.
New in Tiger is the iSync Agent, which makes
syncing your device much easier. If, during
these steps your Mac suggests that you per-
form some extra tasks (such as installing other
software), trust its recommendation and just
follow the instructions.
4.
In the For First Sync drop-down list, select the
first-time data synchronization behavior option
that you prefer.
Use the Merge Data on Computer and Device
option unless you really want to erase all exist-
ing Contact and Calendar information on the
phone (see Figure 55-19).
5.
Use the check boxes and drop-down lists to
indicate what to synchronize (contacts and 
calendars).
6.
Click Sync Now.
After you set up iSync to work with your cell-
phone, you only have to click Sync Now to start
the synchronization. It usually takes a while, espe-
cially for the first synchronization. You should
sync regularly because this feature is most useful
when all data is up to date all the time.
Synchronization means that

All data is available in both places.

Any additions or changes made on either the
computer or the mobile phone are effective on
the other device.
For example, if you add to new contact information
to your cellphone’s address book, this information 
is automatically transferred into a new card in your
Address Book application on the Mac the next time
you synchronize the computer with the cellphone.
On the other hand, if you add a new card for a per-
son while working at your computer, you don’t have
to remember to also store the person’s mobile
phone number into your phone manually; synchro-
nization does this for you automatically.
To discover whether your particular phone (or a
phone that you’re thinking about buying) can be
used with iSync, go to Apple’s device compatibility
list at www.apple.com/isync/devices.html. The best
way to be sure is to check that list . . . or to try it out
before buying, if possible.
Setting up iSync
To start synchronizing with your phone, you need to
add it to iSync’s list of devices, unless the Bluetooth
Setup Assistant has already done so.
iSync is really good at recognizing available
devices, so you might or might not need to go
through these steps to add a device.
1.
Launch iSync.
2.
Choose Add Device from the Devices menu.
Your phone should appear in the list of recog-
nized devices (see Figure 55-18). If it doesn’t, 
put your device into Discoverable mode and 
try again.

Your Cellphone as a Remote Control
431
• Figure 55-19: iSync synchronization options.
You should enable the iSync menu bar icon in
the application’s preferences, which you can
find in the iSync menu. This allows you to start
a synchronization very quickly without having
to launch iSync.
Your Cellphone as 
a Remote Control
If you use a Sony Ericsson cellphone (or a Palm
PDA), you can use one of the hottest Bluetooth-
related utilities, Salling Clicker (www.salling.com,
$10). It installs a menu on your phone that allows
you to control your computer from the phone or 
to view information about the computer on the
phone’s display. Examples of some things you can 
do include

Starting, stopping, or skipping music in iTunes

Displaying information about the current iTunes
song

Controlling DVD playback

Adjusting or muting the sound volume

Controlling slides in a presentation program,
including the ability to display slide notes on the
phone’s display
Salling Clicker also has a proximity sensor. You can
use this to trigger certain actions when you (or more
accurately, your cellphone) enter or leave the prox-
imity of your computer. Examples include

Stopping iTunes or muting the volume when you
leave the room

Restarting iTunes when you return to the machine

Changing your iChat availability when you leave
or return.
Here’s how to quickly get started with Salling Clicker:
1.
Download and install the software.
2.
Open the Salling Clicker panel in System
Preferences.
3.
Click Select Phone and choose the cellphone
on which you’d like the menu installed.
If the phone you would like to use as a remote
control doesn’t appear in the list, make sure that
the phone is in Discoverable mode.
4.
In the main Salling Clicker window, click the
Connect to Phone button to install the menu on
your phone (see Figure 55-20).
If the connection setup was successful, you can
now control your Mac from the special menu
that was installed on your phone.
The location of the menu in the phone’s screens
varies depending on the model that you have. 
On Marc’s T68i, it’s under Connect➪Accessories.
Have fun!

Storing Notes and Pictures 
on a Cellphone
Modern Bluetooth phones can accept text and pic-
ture files. The text feature is especially handy for
storing items like shopping lists, travel itineraries,
and travel directions.
Tiger includes the Bluetooth File Exchange
application to send files to and from a 
mobile phone. Make sure to select the Show
Bluetooth Status in the Menu Bar check box
on the Settings tab of the Bluetooth control
panel (see Figure 55-21). That way, you always
have instant access to the File Exchange appli-
cation by choosing the Send File command
from the menu (see Figure 55-22).
An even quicker way to send short snippets of text
to your cellphone is to use a Services menu com-
mand. Follow these steps to add the command:

Follow these steps to send the text from your Mac to
your cellphone:
1.
On your Mac, select a piece of text in an 
application that supports Services, and then
choose Send to Bluetooth Device from the
Application➪Services menu.
Your note should be transmitted to the cell-
phone.
Some applications don’t support Services. First
try this command in an application that you
know works with Services, such as Safari or
Mail first.
2.
On your phone, choose Accept to receive the
file and store it.
Each cellphone manufacturer uses a different
message. Check the documentation for your
model if you’d like more info on how to accept 
a file.

 Getting around within the
Terminal
 Making the Terminal and
the Finder work together
 Editing in the Terminal
Technique
The Terminal, the
Finder, and You
T
he Terminal is Tiger’s bridge between the beautiful Mac interface
and the awesome UNIX infrastructure. Still, you don’t have to be 
a UNIX geek to use and appreciate this application. After you dis-
cover the basics of getting around and have picked up a few key com-
mands, you’ll see how useful the Terminal can be.
In this technique, we begin with the quickest and easiest ways to move
around within the Terminal. Then we demonstrate some cool and handy
tricks to use, including how you can use the Terminal and the Finder
together. Finally, we cover some efficient ways to make edits in the
Terminal.
If you have some UNIX and command line experience, you’ll be
thrilled to see how most of those skills (plus a few more) apply to
your Mac. If you’ve never tinkered in this area before, this and the
subsequent techniques open a whole new — and quite useful — 
universe to you.
Navigating within the Terminal
When you start using the Terminal, you figure out pretty quickly that the
standard Finder navigation techniques don’t work. In fact, without mas-
tering some commands, you can’t get anywhere in the Terminal. Luckily,
figuring out these things isn’t hard.
The Terminal window greets you with a lot of information (see Figure 56-1).
The most important of this is the command prompt line itself, which is
where you find the cursor. This line is formatted as
ComputerName: CurrentDirectory CurrentUser
In Figure 56-1, you can tell that Larry is connected to his G4 iBook, that he
is in his Home directory (indicated by the tilde; ~), and that he is logged in
as the user named larry. The $ reflects that Larry is logged in as a normal
user. (A number sign indicates a root user — techie speak for a user with
unlimited power.)

Navigating within the Terminal
435
• Figure 56-1: The basic Terminal window.
If you ever forget where you are, you can use the 
pwd (print working directory) command to have the
Terminal tell you (see Figure 56-2).
• Figure 56-2: Use the pwd command to find yourself (but
not in a New Age-y way).
Getting around in the Terminal
When you know where you are, it’s time to get a
move on. To move around within the Terminal, you
use the cd (change directory) command, like this:
cd /path/to/directory
To go to the Applications directory, enter cd
/Applications (as shown in Figure 56-3). This is the
equivalent of opening a folder in the Finder (by 
double-clicking or otherwise).
When it comes to moving around, you should know
these basic facts:

/: A forward slash is called the root directory.
The root directory is the topmost folder on
your computer and is the equivalent of open-
ing your main hard drive in the Finder. If you
Command prompt line
have multiple hard drives or partitions, the one
with the operating system is at the root level;
the other drives and partitions are found under
/Volumes. (And, just to be clear, the root direc-
tory has nothing to do with the root user. Or
root beer, for that matter.)
• Figure 56-3: Larry is now in the /Applications directory,
which is also indicated by /Applications after
the colon.

~: The tilde refers to the Home directory of the
currently logged-in user.

.: A single period refers to the current directory.

..: Two periods refer to the parent directory of
the current directory (for example, Applications
is the parent of Utilities).
To effectively navigate within the Terminal, you need
to know also these basic commands:

Use cd to go to your Home directory.

Use cd ~ to go to your Home directory.

Use cd .. to go up one directory.
The current directory is referred to as . (single
period). The parent directory of the current 
one is .. or ../. A subdirectory is simply
directoryname or directoryname/.
Tab completion
The best tool to use in the Terminal — which is unbe-
lievably helpful — is tab completion. Tab completion
automatically completes words for you, requiring less
typing and cutting down on the number of errors that
you might make. For example, to use tab completion

Technique 56: The Terminal, the Finder, and You
436
you can make a relative path to it (just start 
typing Doc) or you can be extra precise by start-
ing with ~/ before the Doc .
Capitalization matters!
You can move around by using either absolute
or relative paths. An absolute path is accurate
no matter where you’re currently located. A
relative path is accurate only with respect to
your current location. For example, /Users/
larry/Documents/Books/ is an absolute path
(as is ~/Documents/Books/), but Documents/
Books/ is relative (and accurate as long as
Larry is currently in his Home directory).
4.
Press Tab.
The remaining folder name (Documents/) should
be filled in automatically.
If the Terminal can’t find a match for tab 
completion, it does nothing. If it finds several
matches, it either does nothing or completes
the text that all the matches have in common.
For example, if a directory contains filename.
txt and filename.pdf, and you type fi
and try to do a tab completion, the Terminal
returns filename. (with the period). Pressing
tab again normally returns a list of potential
options.
5.
Type Bo and press Tab.
The folder name Books/ is filled in automatically.
6.
Type Mac and press Tab.
The folder name Mac OS X TST FD is filled in
automatically (with the spaces escaped).
7.
Press Return to complete the command (see
Figure 56-5).
You can use tab completion on files and direc-
tories. You can also use it with practically any
command, not just cd.
to move into the Mac OS X TST FD folder within the
Books folder within the Documents folder of your
Home directory (as a completely hypothetical exam-
ple), do this:
1.
Open the Terminal application, which you can
find in the Utilities folder.
2.
In the Terminal window, type cd.
The command that you want to eventually 
type is
cd ~/Documents/Books/Mac\ OS\ X\ TST\ FD
For this example, you need to type the command
(cd) itself and then use tab completion as much
as possible.
Spaces in filenames are common in the Finder
but somewhat problematic in the Terminal
because a space delineates a command. To
work around this potential problem, escape
the space by using the backslash, as in Mac\
OS\ X\ TST\ FD, which looks like Mac OS X
TST FD in the Finder. Escaping is the process
of preceding problematic characters with a
backslash, so that they don’t cause problems.
In this example, the backslash-space combina-
tion is interpreted as a space character.
3.
Type ~/Doc (see Figure 56-4).
• Figure 56-4: Tab completion lets you type a minimum of
characters.
To get to this destination, you must first go into
the Documents directory. Because the Terminal
automatically starts you in your Home directory,

Viewing directory contents
If you’re in a directory and need to see what’s there,
use the ls (list) command. The ls command pres-
ents you with a list of a directory’s contents, much
like you would see in a Finder window . . . but with-
out the icons. Common ways to use ls include

Type ls to list the basic contents of the current
directory.

Type ls -G to show the list in color (assuming
that the Disable ANSI Color check box isn’t
selected in the Terminal➪Window Settings➪
Color panel).

Type ls -a to show every file, including hidden
ones.
The –a flag makes the ls command show
many other items. These include hidden files
(filenames that begin with a period), a line
for the current directory (marked by a single
period), and a line for the parent directory, if
one exists (marked with two periods).

Type ls -l to show more file information.

If you like, you can combine parameters, (for
example, ls -al or ls -aG).

Add a directory name to view a directory other
than the one you’re in. Here are three ways 
to do it:
ls –G ~/Documents
ls –al /usr/local/php
ls /Applications/Utilities
To see the last of the three examples in action,
take a glance at Figure 56-6.
• Figure 56-6: You can view a directory’s contents without
being in it.
Navigating among open Terminal windows
The Terminal opens a new window for you when you
open the Terminal application, but you don’t need to
restrict yourself to just a single session. You can open
more windows by either choosing File➪New Shell or
using the Ô-N keyboard shortcut.
Each Terminal window opens with the default
user logged in and located in their Home
directory. There is no relationship between 
different Terminal windows, and no history is
maintained from one to the other.
Working with multiple Terminal windows is great if
you’re trying to accomplish many things at once. If
you’re working in two directories at the same time,
you can use two windows (one for each directory) so
that you don’t have to keep moving yourself around.
When you have multiple Terminal windows open,
you can easily move from one to the other:

Technique 56: The Terminal, the Finder, and You
438
come with a help manual (called man files) you can
read. For example, to find help for the ls (list) com-
mand, do the following:
1.
Open the Terminal.
2.
Type man ls.
This displays the manual for the ls command
(see Figure 56-8).
• Figure 56-8: The manual for the ls command.
3.
Scroll through the manual with these keys:
 Press the spacebar or F to go forward.
 Press B to go backward.
4.
Press Q to quit (at any time).
Many commands have a help option, which is
like a short version of the manual. If it’s sup-
ported by a command, you type command-
name --help to see that command’s help
information.
A command of history, or a history of commands
One of the best ways to save time is to make use of
the Terminal’s memory. We don’t mean memory in a
RAM sense; the Terminal remembers your history of
commands. For example, you can use history to re-
enter a previously used command:

Use Ô-←and Ô-→to move back and forth.

Use Ô-~ to rotate among them.

Use Ô-1 to access the first window, Ô-2 to access
the second, and so forth.
Other commands
Here are a few other must-know commands that we
should mention:

clear: Clears the Terminal screen.

Control-C: Stops the currently running command.

exit: Logs out (see Figure 56-7).
• Figure 56-7: When you’re done using the Terminal, log
out with exit.
You can set the Terminal to automatically close
the window after you exit. Check out Technique
60 or the Shell panel of the Window Settings
panel.
Terminal Tips and Tricks
In the next four techniques, we cover various tips
and tricks involving broader subjects — finding files,
handling output, viewing files, and customization.
Here we include a few miscellaneous little tricks that
you’ll appreciate.
Getting help
The world of UNIX is a world of commands, but you’d
have to be a genius to remember how to use them
all. Fortunately, you don’t have to. Most commands

Terminal Tips and Tricks

1.
Press the up arrow to display the previously
entered command.
Continue to press the up arrow to find earlier
commands.
2.
Press the down arrow if you went too far.
3.
Edit an existing command as needed.
4.
Press Return to re-execute it.
A more elaborate but related tool is the history
command. After you’ve used the Terminal for a
while, type history and press Return (see Figure 56-9).
The history command shows you what you’ve done
(in order), numbering each command. With this
knowledge, you can

Type !n to repeat a command listed by history
(n is the line number associated with the 
command).
As you can see in Figure 56-9, each command 
is numbered. To rerun the pwd command, for
example, type !4 and then press Return (see
Figure 56-10).

Type !command to repeat the last version of a
specific command (see Figure 56-11).
• Figure 56-9: The history command reveals the
commands you’ve recently entered.
• Figure 56-10: Repeat commands with the !n syntax.
• Figure 56-11: The history tool also provides shortcuts by
command name.
This version of the history trick tells the
Terminal to repeat the last version of whatever
the command was. For example, !ls might 
actually call ls /Applications/Utilities,
which you had previously entered.
Don’t use the !command trick with the rm
(remove) command. This probably permanently
removes something that you don’t want to
remove. Or, it might attempt to remove some-
thing that you’ve already deleted (because that
command has already been run).

Technique 56: The Terminal, the Finder, and You
440
You can control the Apache Web server through
the Sharing System Preferences panel or via the
command line by using apachectl. However, you
must be an administrator to use the command
line. Therefore, trying to control Apache as your-
self creates errors.
• Figure 56-13: Even administrators can’t start Apache
when logged in as themselves.
3.
Type sudo apachectl start.
To run any command as a more powerful user,
preface it with sudo.
4.
Enter your administrative password at the
prompt (see Figure 56-14).
• Figure 56-14: The first time you use sudo, a strong
warning is displayed.
You need to use sudo when you get a 
permission-denied error message in the
Terminal.
The sudo command recalls your administra-
tive password for five minutes after you last
used it. If you don’t use sudo for a few min-
utes, you’re required to enter the password
again.

Use the !command:p or !n:p syntax to see what a
command would be (see Figure 56-12).
The :p addition reminds you of what a particular
command was without executing it. You can use
it with the numbering system (!4:p) or with the
command syntax (!ls:p).
• Figure 56-12: The :p flag gives you a preview of what
command a shortcut would be.
Role playing: Executing commands 
as another user
One trick that you inevitably need to know is how to
execute commands as other users. These are com-
mon situations: 

You need to execute a command as a more pow-
erful user.
For example, you may need to pretend to be the
super-powerful root user. I explain this concept
in the sidebar. 

You need to access another user’s files (on your
Mac or another). 
The sudo command lets you run a command as
another user. In the following example, we show you
one use of sudo: controlling the built-in Web serving
application:
1.
Open a Terminal window.
2.
Try starting Apache by using apachectl start
(see Figure 56-13).

Making the Terminal and the Finder Play Together Nicely
441
Creating a root user
Your Mac has many users on it, users that are entirely dif-
ferent than those you use to login and access the computer.
Of these system users, the most critical is the root user. The
root user has unlimited powers but isn’t enabled by default.
This is a good thing because it protects your computer
from highly detrimental mistakes (only the root user can do
very serious damage).
On the other hand, working as the root user is sometimes
useful. Switching over to the root account lets you do those
things you need to do without preceding each command
with sudo. To use the root user feature, you must enable it
and create a password, by following these steps:
1.
Open the NetInfo Manager application, which
you can find in the Utilities folder.
2.
Choose Security➪Authenticate.
3.
At the prompt, enter your administrative pass-
word.
4.
Choose Security➪Enable Root User.
5.
Read the prompt (shown here) and click OK.
6.
Use the second prompt (see the accompanying
figure) to enter the new password and then 
click OK.
7.
Quit the NetInfo Manager.
8.
In the Terminal, type su root and press Return.
9.
Enter the new root user’s password.
10.
Be very, very, very careful!
Even though you can create a root user password, you
really, really should avoid creating it unless you really know
what you’re doing and absolutely need a root user.
Making the Terminal and the
Finder Play Together Nicely
One of the nice things about the Terminal is how
easily it interacts with the Finder. Here you find a
couple tricks to make interactions between the two
more seamless.
Using the open command
The open command is a pretty useful little tool. It
uses the Finder to open a file, directory, or even a
URL. Essentially, open works in the Terminal exactly
the way opening a file, folder, URL, or application
works in the Finder.

open .: Opens the current directory in a Finder
window (see Figure 56-15).
Marc has created an AppleScript that can 
be added to your Finder window toolbars
(www.entropy.ch/software/applescript/
welcome.html, free). When you click it, it
opens the Finder directory in the Terminal.

open directoryname: Opens the directory in a
Finder window.

open /Applications/application_name: Opens
the application.
Applications in the Applications folder can 
also be opened by using the -a (open with
application) flag (for example: open –a
Calculator. app).

Technique 56: The Terminal, the Finder, and You
442
4.
Navigate to the directory that you want to use
in a Finder window.
5.
Click the directory’s proxy icon in the win-
dow’s title bar and drag the icon into the
Terminal window.
6.
Switch back to the Terminal (see Figure 56-16).
• Figure 56-16: Dragging a folder into the Terminal copies
that folder’s path there.
7.
Press Return to execute the command.
You can drag and drop anything from the
Finder into the Terminal, including folders,
files, and applications.
Editing between the Terminal
and the Finder
You can also make edits between the Terminal and
the Finder. You use the Clipboard (of course) to tem-
porarily store and retrieve text, but you have two
ways of using it:

You can select text in the Terminal by using the
mouse and then pressing Ô-C to copy it.

You can use the pbpaste and pbcopy commands.
These two commands are very handy but require
piping. Head over to Technique 58 for information on
piping and how to use it with pbpaste and pbcopy.
• Figure 56-15: The open command makes quick
transitions between the Terminal and 
the Finder.

open http://www.espn.com: Opens the URL in
your default Web browser.

open -a ApplicationName filename: Opens the
file in the particular application.

open -e filename: Opens the file in TextEdit.
Drag and drop with the Finder
If the tab completion trick that we discuss in an ear-
lier section isn’t good enough for you, here’s another
timesaver: You can drag and drop items from the
Finder into the Terminal.
1.
Open a Terminal window.
2.
Type cd, followed by a space.
3.
Switch to the Finder.

Managing and
Finding Files Fast
Y
ou can do countless tasks with the Terminal and a command line
interface. Many of them, including managing and finding your files,
you actually can do faster in the Terminal than in the Finder. Plus,
the command line options provide for flexibility and automation of tasks
that can’t be replicated elsewhere.
In this technique, you find out the easiest ways to copy, move, rename,
and delete your files and directories by using the Terminal. Then you see
two ways to search your hard drive for files and directories.
Copying, Moving, Renaming, 
and Deleting Files
Managing your files in the Finder is easy and relatively quick. But you 
can also perform the same tasks in the Terminal with many benefits. For
example, you can

Move or copy files from one folder to another without having multiple
windows open.

Delete files without having to empty the Trash. (It’s a one-step process.)

Manage files by using just a few commands, not a bunch of keyboard
shortcuts.

Apply changes to files that meet a certain naming scheme.
To copy a file, use the cp (copy) command:
cp source target
For example, to make a copy of myfile.jpg called myfile2.jpg (both of
which are in the current directory):
cp myfile.jpg myfile2.jpg
cp ~/Documents/Books/chapter.doc ~/Desktop/chapter.doc

mand to find your stuff

Technique 57: Managing and Finding Files Fast
444
No actual rename command exists in the Terminal.
Instead, use mv and provide a new name:
mv myfile.txt newname.txt
mv ~/Desktop/afolder ~/Desktop/bfolder
The mv command can’t create a path, but cp can.
In other words, if you try to copy filename.txt to
/Users/larry/Document/newfiles/filename.txt and
the newfiles directory doesn’t exist, the cp com-
mand creates it for you.
To delete a file, use the rm (remove) command:
rm filename
rm mydocument.doc
Be very, very careful with the rm command.
Unlike deleting something in the Finder —
which places the item in the Trash to be
deleted (emptied) or recovered later — the 
rm command is an immediate deletion. The
command has a -W (capital W) flag that
attempts to undelete a deleted file. It might 
let you undelete a file for a few minutes after
deletion, but you can’t count on that.
The rm command can also delete directories, using
the -R flag:
rm -R mydirectory
Command names (rm, cp, mv) are case-
insensitive, so RM, Cp, and mV work equally
well. Flags (like the -R flag added to rm), file-
names, and directory names are case-sensitive.
As with cp and mv, the -i flag asks for confirmation
before completing the deletion.
The absolute worst command that you can
ever use is rm - R /, which attempts to
delete everything on your computer. To avoid
running this risk, don’t use rm with sudo
(see Technique 56), don’t use rm when you’re
logged in as root, and always use the -i
option to be prompted before disaster strikes.
To copy an entire directory, add the -R flag (you must
use a capital R):
cp -R myfolder ~/Desktop/myfolder
The cp command doesn’t warn you if you’re
about to overwrite an existing file (as the
Finder does). To prevent doing something
you’ll regret, use the -i flag: cp -i source
target. Then cp prompts you before over-
writing an existing file (see Figure 57-1).
• Figure 57-1: The -i flag tells the Terminal to prompt you
before overwriting any files.
What a difference a slash makes
Note the obscure difference between cp -R myfolder and
cp -R myfolder/. The former copies the directory and its
contents to the destination. The latter, because of the trailing
forward slash, copies the contents of the directory but not the
folder itself. The result of this can be very messy.
The difference between using the trailing slash and not can
be very confusing to beginners, especially because the tab
completion always appends the forward slash. This also
applies to the mv command.
If you want to move a file, use the mv command:
mv source target
For example
mv myfile.txt ~/Desktop/myfile.txt
mv ~/Desktop/afolder /Volumes/Main/afolder
Like the cp command, the mv command 
doesn’t warn you if you’re about to overwrite
an existing file. Use the -i flag to be prompted
when this might happen.

Creating and Listing Directories
445
Another common Finder trick that is replicated in
the Terminal is the ability to make an alias. In UNIX
terms, these are symbolic links. They’re created with
the ln (make link) command.
ln -s file alias
ln -s directory alias
Creating and Listing Directories
If you’re in the Finder, you always see a directory’s
contents whether you’re in icon, list, or column view
mode. In the Terminal, you don’t see any directory
contents unless you specifically ask for them by
using the ls (list) command. (See Figure 57-2.)
ls
ls ~ 
• Figure 57-2: The listed contents of Larry’s Home
directory.
The nice thing is that the ls command lets you view
the contents of a directory you’re not even in! For
example, to see the contents of the Games folder, use
ls /Applications/Games
Like most commands, ls takes several arguments.

-a: View every file, including hidden ones (see
Figure 57-3).

-A: View every file, including hidden ones, with-
out listing the current and parent directories
(see Figure 57-4). 
 The current directory is represented by one
period.
 The parent directory is represented by two
periods.
• Figure 57-3: The -a flag reveals hidden files.
• Figure 57-4: The -A flag is like -a, but it omits the current
and parent directories.

-l: Use -l (lowercase L) to view more information
about the directory contents (see Figure 57-5).
• Figure 57-5: The -l flag shows permissions, ownership,
modification date, and more.

-r: Sort the directory contents in reverse order
by name.

Technique 57: Managing and Finding Files Fast
446
mv *.jpg /path/to/new/destination

You can delete all the files that begin with the
word chapter:
rm -i chapter
The best way to figure out how to use wildcards is 
to test your command first by preceding it with echo.
The result of this is to display (in the Terminal
screen) the affected files without actually affecting
the files (see Figure 57-6).
• Figure 57-6: Use echo to preview the results of a
command.
Run your rm commands with echo first to see
the effect before you remove a bunch of files.
Using the find Command
The find command alone is a really good reason to
use the Terminal. It provides a quick and flexible
search capability. Although you can use find in many
different ways, the easiest way to use it is like so:
find -f directory --name ‘filename’
For example:
find -f ~/Documents --name ‘chapter.doc’
To search for a file in the current directory, use
find . --name ‘filename’
Other options include the ability to search for files
by type. A type of f restricts the find to files, and d
limits it to directories.
find -f ~ --name ‘book*’ -type f
find -f ~ --name ‘book*’ -type d

-S: Sort the directory contents by size in descend-
ing order.

-t: Sort the directory contents by date and time
in descending order.
In the Finder, you can create a new directory by mak-
ing a new folder. In the Terminal, you use the mkdir
(make directory) command:
mkdir directoryname
mkdir junk
With this command, you can even make a directory
without being in the parent directory:
mkdir ~/Documents/By\ Application/Excel
The rmdir (remove directory) command deletes an
empty directory:
rmdir directoryname
rmdir junk
rmdir ~/Documents/By\ Application/Excel
To delete a directory that has stuff in it, you
need to use rm -R directoryname. To 
delete an empty directory, use rmdir 
directoryname.
Using Wildcards
The true power of the basic Terminal commands
comes with using certain wildcards to make less-
specific statements.

*: The asterisk represents zero or more 
characters.

?: The question mark represents a single 
character.

[ ]: You can place options within brackets.
Here are a couple examples:

If you have a folder full of images, you can move
all the JPGs with

Using the locate Command
447
You can add a number to the end to indicate a modi-
fication date within a certain number of days from
now. The following applies only to files modified in
the last 24 hours:
find -f ~ --name ‘book*’ -type f -1
The find tool can also be used without a filename, in
which case it returns all the contents for the named
directory and all its subdirectories, as shown in
Figure 57-7:
find ~/Sites
• Figure 57-7: All the directory contents and subdirectory
contents are listed by using find.
In this way, the find tool can be a much more potent
version of the ls command. In fact, another easy-to-
remember trick is to use the -ls flag with find, as
shown in Figure 57-8:
find ~/Sites -ls
• Figure 57-8: The same directory as in Figure 57-7,
displaying more information.
All in all, the find tool is one of the most useful 
command line utilities. As an example, if you’re 
looking for a file called something like quotes.doc
or quotations.doc, and it’s somewhere in your
Documents directory, do this:
1.
Open a Terminal window.
2.
Type find -f ~/Documents --name quot*.doc -type
f and press Return (see Figure 57-9).
This command searches through the Documents
directory (and its subfolders) looking for a file
whose name begins with quot and ends with .doc.
• Figure 57-9: The directories searched and the files found
are returned.
3.
If you see your desired file, open it with open
/path/to/filename.
4.
If you don’t see your desired file, rerun the
find command with new parameters.
You can also use grep to find files. grep is a
regular expressions tool (regular expressions
being a very useful, and not easy to learn,
method of creating patterns to match). For
more information, either see a good UNIX (or
regular expressions) book or search the
Internet for tutorials.
Using the locate Command
Another option for finding files is to use the locate
command. But before you can use this, you need to
create the locate database and then update this
database often. You use the updatedb command to
create and update the locate database:
1.
Open a Terminal window.
2.
Type sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb to cre-
ate the database.
3.
Type locate filename to look for a particular
file.

Technique 57: Managing and Finding Files Fast
448

Create a cron (see Technique 54) to automati-
cally run the updatedb command.

Use wildcards in your filename to create a more
flexible search.

For a good tutorial on locate, see 
www.kingcomputerservices.com/unix_101/
using_find_to_locate_files.htm
locate is faster than find but requires the initial cre-
ation of a database (which is really just an index) to
function. Here are some tips for getting the most out
of this simple command:

Run the updatedb tool often (to update the data-
base) for your searches to be up to date and
accurate.

Piping and
Redirecting Output
with the Terminal
M
ost beginning command line users are able to execute simple
commands in the Terminal to accomplish basic tasks. But the
advanced user also understands the concepts of standard input
and output: controlling where a command’s results are directed. You can
do this with piping and redirection output. This technique focuses prima-
rily on those two subjects, but we first discuss a few other useful com-
mands that you can use with piping.
Handy Commands to Use with Piping
This book’s techniques relating to the Terminal cover the most efficient
ways to use the most common and useful commands, but we also want to
mention a few other tools that you’ll likely appreciate. These commands
can be used independently, but they’re particularly useful with piping
and output redirection.
You can use the wc (word count) command to count the number of lines,
words, and characters in a file:
wc filename
wc chapter58.txt
The output of this command is very simple. It returns the number of
lines, words, and characters (see Figure 58-1). In the figure, you can see
that the Installer Log File contains 0 lines, 3,803 words, and 47,647 char-
acters. If you want to see only some of these values, use the different
flags to control output:

l: For lines

w: For words

c: For characters

You can actually use sort to see whether a file
is already sorted: Use sort -c filename.
The ps command lists currently running processes
(think process status). A process is UNIX-speak for a
running application, service, or technology. This
command is very easy to use:
ps flags
The relevant parameters (flags) for this command are

a: Shows all processes, not just the ones you’re
running.

c: Shows a minimal version of the process name.

m: Sorts the list of running processes by memory
usage.

r: Sorts the list of running processes by CPU
usage.

U: Shows the process for a particular user.
The functionality of the ps command is dupli-
cated in the Finder by the Process Viewer utility.
Finally, the du command displays disk usage statis-
tics. It takes several flags:

k: Returns the statistics in megabytes.

h: Makes the result more readable for humans.

s: Shows the results for every file.

c: Totals the statistics.
Here are several practical examples of this com-
mand: 

To view the total disk usage of the current direc-
tory, type du -sh (see Figure 58-2).

To see the disk usage of individual files in the
current directory (and its subdirectories), type
du -h (see Figure 58-3).
• Figure 58-1: Run wc to get statistics on a file.
You can also change the position of the flags to 
control the order in which results are returned. For
example, wc -wl filename returns just the number
of words and lines; wc -cw filename returns the
number of characters and then the number of words.
You can use the wc command with piping to
return the number of items in a directory. For
more information, see “Combining Commands
with Pipes.”
As with most things in the Terminal, command
names (wc, sort, ps) are case-insensitive, so
WC, Sort, and pS work equally well. Flags (like
the -w flag added to wc), filenames, and direc-
tory names are case-sensitive.
The sort command sorts a file alphabetically and
returns the sorted list:
sort filename
The sort command takes several arguments to
adjust its parameters:

b: Ignores any blank spaces at the beginning of 
a line.

d: Sorts in phone-directory order (ignoring
everything but letters, numbers, and blank
spaces).

f: Performs a case-insensitive sort.

r: Sorts in reverse order.

• Figure 58-2: Larry’s Home directory uses a whopping
3.9MB of space.
• Figure 58-3: The du command can show the size of every
file.

To display the disk usage of a specific directory,
type du -h ~/Desktop (see Figure 58-4).

To view the size of a specific file in kilobytes,
type du filename (see Figure 58-5).
• Figure 58-4: You can limit du to a specific directory.
• Figure 58-5: Show a file’s size.
Combining Commands 
with Pipes
Pipes are one of the most important timesaving 
command line tools. As you can see, commands nor-
mally send their output (the result of the command)
to the display (the Terminal). By using pipes, you
can send the output of one command to be used 
as the input for another. This is accomplished by 
the pipe operator, a vertical bar (created by press-
ing Shift-backslash), to join multiple commands
together:
output_command | input_command
For example, here’s how you find the number of
processes that you have running:

Type ps -auxU username to see all your
processes.

Type ps -auxU username | wc -l to view the
number of your processes (see Figure 58-6).

Technique 58: Piping and Redirecting Output with the Terminal
452
The find command returns all the files in the current
directory and subdirectory. This list is then sent to
the grep utility, which allows you to perform very
flexible searches. In this case, grep finds every file
that includes some version of tif. (The i flag means
that it should ignore case.) The result is then sent to
the Terminal (see Figure 58-8).
• Figure 58-8: Use a pipe with grep to help narrow a search.
Another good use of piping is to find the largest direc-
tories on your computer. You can do this by combin-
ing the du and sort commands (see Figure 58-9).
• Figure 58-9: Use piping to find the largest directories by
size.
• Figure 58-6: Use the pipe with multiple commands to
fine-tune your results.
If you want to see how many items you have in a par-
ticular directory, do this:

Type ls directoryname to list the files in the
directory.

Type ls directoryname | wc -l to view the num-
ber of files in the directory.

Type ls -A directoryname | wc -l to view the
number of files in the directory, including hidden
files (see Figure 58-7).
• Figure 58-7: Use the pipe with multiple commands to
fine-tune your results.
If you want to find every file with an extension of
TIFF or TIF or tiff or tif, you can use the find com-
mand with grep:
find . | grep -i tif

Combining Commands with Pipes
453
du -sk * | sort -nr
The du -sk * syntax calculates the size of all the
items (indicated by the asterisk) in the current direc-
tory. (Larry was in his Home directory when he ran it,
so it checked his files.) This is then piped through the
sort command, which places this list in numerically
reverse order. You can repeat this process for other
folders by using cd to go into a directory and then
using the history command’s !du (see Technique 56)
to repeat this piping procedure:
cd Library
!du
The pbpaste and pbcopy commands allow you to
move data on and off the Clipboard while you’re
working with the command line. This means that
these two commands are the ultimate glue for trans-
ferring text between regular Mac applications and
UNIX tools:

pbpaste outputs the current contents of the
Clipboard to the Terminal. You then use output
redirection or a pipe to feed this output to a file
or to a second UNIX program that does some-
thing useful with the data.

pbcopy puts data onto the Clipboard. The data
is placed on the right side of a pipe, which means
that the output of some other UNIX program is
piped into pbcopy. The output of the first pro-
gram is stored on the Clipboard, where it can be
accessed from Mac applications by pressing Ô-V.
As an example, here’s how to use these commands
to create a TextEdit file that lists the contents of the
/etc directory:
1.
Open a Terminal window.
2.
Type ls -A /etc | pbcopy and press Return (see
Figure 58-10).
• Figure 58-10: Send the results of a command to the
Clipboard.
The ls command is executed (the -A means it
should list everything), but you won’t see any
results displayed in the Terminal. Instead, the
results are pasted onto the Clipboard.
3.
Open TextEdit.
4.
Create a new document.
5.
Press Ô-V to paste the Clipboard contents into
the document (see Figure 58-11).
• Figure 58-11: The results of the ls command have been
passed into the TextEdit document.

Technique 58: Piping and Redirecting Output with the Terminal
454
command, which returns the number of items (by
counting the number of lines).
Redirecting Output
Your Terminal uses the notion of STDIN (standard
input), STDOUT (standard output), and STDERR
(standard error) to control the flow of information.
These are each channels for information to travel
through. For example, the ls command receives
arguments through the Terminal (STDIN) and sends
its results to the Terminal screen (STDOUT). But it
doesn’t have to work this way. As you can see with
piping, you can send the standard output to another
command, not the Terminal. Likewise, a command
can take its input from the output of another com-
mand. You can also add files to the mix by using out-
put redirection.
To indicate that a command should take its input
from a file, use <:
command < sourcefile
Use < in cases where the command normally
takes its input from the keyboard. Many com-
mands — including more, head, tail, pine,
and vi — take filenames as arguments by
default, so using < is unnecessary.
Comparatively, to redirect standard output to a file
instead of displaying it in the Terminal screen, use >:
command > filename
For example, you can create a text file listing the
contents of a directory by using
ls -la ~/Documents >
~/Desktop/documents_listing.txt
You should be aware that this technique overwrites
any existing file contents and creates the file if it
doesn’t already exist. If you want to build on an
existing file or not risk overwriting a file, use >>:
Alternatively, you can use pbpaste to do something
with the Clipboard contents. For example, if you’re
writing an e-mail and want to know how long it is, 
do this:
1.
Open your e-mail message in Mail.
2.
Select the entire message body by pressing Ô-A.
3.
Open a Terminal window.
4.
Type pbpaste | wc -w and press Return (see
Figure 58-12).
• Figure 58-12: Piping the Clipboard contents through the
word count command.
5.
If you want, you can store the number of words
back in the Clipboard by using pbpaste | wc 
-w | pbcopy.
A more advanced level of piping uses the tee com-
mand. tee lets the output go to a command but also
saves it to a file (think of it like a plumbing T, where
the water splits in two opposite directions):
output_command | tee filename | 
input_othercommand
ls -A /path/to/directory | tee 
~/contents.txt | wc -l
The preceding command lists (ls) all (-A) the 
contents of a directory. Instead of displaying these
contents, they are instead stored in a text file called
contents.txt (located in the Home directory). The
result of the ls command is also sent to the wc

Redirecting Output
455
command >> filename
This syntax appends the output to the existing file,
adding it at the end. For example:
ls -l ~/Documents >> ~/Desktop/listing.txt
ls -l ~/Music >> ~/Desktop/listing.txt
ls -l ~/Pictures >> ~/Desktop/listing.txt
Essentially, this is how your system logs function: All
messages created by the process being monitored
are appended to the existing system log.
The > operator erases any existing contents in
the named file. To be extra careful, use >>
instead!

Technique
Viewing and Editing
Text Files
T
his is the last of the major Terminal techniques, and here we dis-
cuss viewing and editing text files. Although you can easily work
with text files through the Finder using applications such as TextEdit
or BBEdit, the following are some good reasons for working with text files
in the Terminal:

Accessing hidden files is easier in the Terminal.

If you’re already in the Terminal, you might not want to switch 
applications.

You might already be working on a remote server.
In this technique, you master two basic commands for viewing a text file.
Then you see two other handy commands that display only a portion of a
text file — a real timesaver. Finally, you see how to perform basic edits of
a text file in the Terminal by using the pico editor.
Viewing Files
Because UNIX uses a gazillion little utilities with a specific function, there
are separate commands for viewing files and editing files. Obviously, you
can use an editing tool to just view a file, but why would you want to? By
using one of the two commands for viewing a file, you can simplify the
experience.
cat
The cat command is actually short for concatenation, which is the process
of appending one thing to another. The command’s intention is to take
several files as arguments and then display them all in order, as if their
contents constituted one large file. You can use cat to do this, showing
multiple files at once, or you can use it to display a single file (see Fig-
ure 59-1).

Viewing Files
457
• Figure 59-1: Use cat to view Apache’s configuration file.
The syntax for this command is simply
cat filename
For example, to view the Apache Web Server’s con-
figuration file, type
cat /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
These two examples demonstrate how you can use
cat to view multiple files at once (each appended to
the next):
cat myfile.txt myfile2.txt
cat myfile.txt ~/Documents/myfile2.txt ~/
Desktop/myfile3.txt
You can make cat a little more useful by using either
the -n flag to number the lines as they’re displayed
or by using -b, which numbers all but the blank lines.
You can also use cat with the pipe or output redirec-
tion. (For more on output redirection and piping, see
Technique 58.) For example, the following command
creates a new file (named newfile.txt in this exam-
ple) by putting the other two files (myfile1.txt and
myfile2.txt) together:
cat myfile1.txt myfile2.txt > newfile.txt
This command tells you how many lines the two files
together contain (1,687 in the example shown in
Figure 59-2):
cat myfile1.txt myfile2.txt | wc -l
• Figure 59-2: Use cat to pipe two files through the wc
command.
Don’t try to concatenate two files with the
command cat myfile1.txt myfile2.txt 
> myfile1.txt. This doesn’t append the
myfile2.txt contents to myfile1.txt; it
destroys the original myfile1.txt contents
and then adds the myfile2.txt contents to 
it. If you want to concatenate myfile1.txt to
myfile2.txt, do so in a new file.
more or less
The cat utility lacks certain features. Namely, you
can’t move around too much within the cat com-
mand. As a step up from this, UNIX normally comes
with a more command, which displays a file one page
at a time. After the more command is displaying a
file, you can then press the spacebar (or F) to pagi-
nate forward or Q to quit.
Sadly, your Mac doesn’t have more on it. What it 
has instead is its successor, less (and no, we’re not 
making this up). The less command is faster than
more and lets you page backward, too. To use less,
simply type
less filename
For example (the result of the second command is
displayed in Figure 59-3):
less ~/Documents/myfile.txt
less /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
Familiarize yourself with less because all 
man pages are displayed by using it. For 
more on the man (manual) command, see
Technique 56.

Technique 59: Viewing and Editing Text Files
458
• Figure 59-4: The help page for less.
Your Mac has a utility called more on it, but it’s
the same thing as less. (It isn’t really more, it’s
just called more.) In fact, if you check out the
manual for more (man more), you can see the
manual for less. Marc’s explanation for this
phenomenon is that sometimes less is more.
You can’t argue with that.
Viewing Parts of Files
If you don’t need to view an entire file, you have no
reason to use less. Viewing just the part that you
need saves time:

Use the head command to view just the first few
lines of a file. 
head myfile.txt

Use the tail command to view just the last few
lines of a file.
tail ~/Documents/file.txt
• Figure 59-3: Use less to view a file one page at a time.
Here are the basic commands for moving around
when you’re in less:

Press F to scroll forward one page.

Press B to scroll backward one page.

Press Return to scroll forward one line.

Press D to scroll forward one-half page.

Press Y to scroll backward one-half page.

Press G to go to a specific line number.
You can precede the d, b, f, Return, and y commands
with a number to move that many lines. For example,
10f moves forward 10 lines, and 20b moves back-
wards 20 lines.
Note that g behaves differently: a g preceded by a
number goes to a specific line. (1g goes to the first
line, and 169g moves to line 169.)
Two very important other shortcuts are

Press H at any time to see all the commands (see
Figure 59-4).

Press Q to quit.
Type man less or less --help to see all the options,
including how to perform searches.

Editing Files
459
Both of these commands take an n flag to dictate
how many lines to display (see Figure 59-5 and
Figure 59-6):
head -n 5 /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
tail -n 15 /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
• Figure 59-5: When using head, you can view just the first
few lines of a file.
• Figure 59-6: When using tail, you can view just the last
several lines of a file.
The tail command has a couple other useful flags.
These are

-r: Shows the lines in reverse order.

-f: Keeps the tail utility running. (tail contin-
ues to show the last lines of a file — even as lines
are added to the file — until you press Control-C
to stop it.)
You can view system logs with tail by using
tail -f logname. This keeps the tail utility
running, persistently updating you as the sys-
tem log changes. In other words, the last ten
lines (the default number of lines to display)
are always displayed on-screen, even as lines
are added to the log. This is essentially the
functionality duplicated with the Console util-
ity. This is extremely useful to Web developers
and system administrators.
Editing Files
If you want to edit files in the Terminal, you have
several options:

pico: A bare-bones application.

vi: A more advanced text editor.

vim: A modified version of vi.

emacs: Perhaps the most powerful text editor.
To keep this simple, we briefly discuss pico in this
chapter. If you find yourself doing command line
editing frequently, you should learn vim or emacs.
(Tiger has vim instead of the tradition vim.) Here is
the good, the bad, and the ugly about vi, vim, and
emacs:

They’re all very powerful after you master them.

They’re difficult to master and not even remotely
intuitive to learn.

Never, under any circumstances, suggest to
someone that vi or vim or emacs is any better
or worse than any other text editor. If you do,
you’ll never hear the end of that person’s dia-
tribe. (This is a point of serious contention
among computer geeks.)
In Technique 60, we demonstrate how to set
your default text editor.
Editing with pico
The pico editor is really easy to use. Here’s all you
need to know:

Press Control-K to cut the selected text.
To copy or move text in pico, follow these steps:
1.
Use the preceding numbered steps to cut the
original text.
2.
If you want to copy the text without deleting it
from its original location, press Control-U to
paste the selected text back into its original
location.
If you want to move the text to another location, skip
this step.
3.
Move the cursor to the new location where you
want to paste the original text.
4.
Press Control-U to paste the selected text into
the new location.
3.
Press Control-O to save your work.
After you press this command, you’re prompted
with what filename to use (see Figure 59-8). 
Press Return to use the default filename listed.
To change the filename, press the Delete key to
delete the default name and then type in the new
name.
• Figure 59-8: Saving a file in pico.
4.
Press Control-X to exit pico.
If you haven’t saved your work, you’re given the
option to do so (pico calls the changes a modi-
fied buffer) before exiting.
1.
Type pico filename to open a file.
Type pico newfilename to create a new file
with that name.
2.
Write and edit the file as you need.
 Type the text you want (see Figure 59-7).
Unlike other command line text editors, you
can begin typing in pico without entering a
keyboard shortcut or command first. For
example, vim requires you to press I to begin
inserting characters. 
• Figure 59-7: Working in the pico text editor.
 Press Delete to remove characters.
 To copy, move, or cut a section of code, follow
the steps in the sidebar, “Rearranging text.”
Rearranging text
To cut text in pico, follow these steps:
1.
Place your cursor where you want to begin.
You must use the arrow keys. You can’t use the
mouse to move around.
2.
Press Control-Shift-6 to mark the beginning of
the area to be cut.
3.
Move your cursor to the end. 

Editing Files
461
Editing with Finder tools
Don’t forget that you can also edit text files by using
Finder tools — but launch those from the Terminal.
For example, you can use these commands:

open -e filename: Opens a file in TextEdit.

open -a applicationname filename: Opens a
file in the named application.

bbedit filename: Opens a file in BBEdit.
BBEdit has an option to open hidden files
directly in the application.

Technique
Customizing Your
Terminal
B
ecause several of the previous techniques — and much of what you
might do — depends upon the Terminal application, knowing how to
adjust its behavior is well worth the time spent. In this technique, we
begin with the preference settings the application itself has to offer and
how they relate to using this tool most effectively. Then we show you the
benefits of the different shells that you can use. (A shell is a tool that
allows you to interact with the operating system.) Afterward, you figure
out how to use special preferences files that affect your shell. Finally, we
discuss a few cool related freeware and shareware applications.
Adjusting Terminal’s Preferences
The Terminal actually has two areas for setting its preferences. Both of
these areas are accessible under the Terminal menu.
Terminal Preferences panel
The Terminal Preferences panel (see Figure 60-1) is great for customizing
the application if you know what you’re doing.

Adjusting Terminal’s Preferences
463
Usually, the only Terminal Preferences setting you
should consider changing is what, if any, .term file to
open when a new Terminal window is created. This
can be handy. We cover it in the section “Creating
Terminal Preferences Files” later in this technique.
You probably shouldn’t change two specific
Terminal settings. The first is what to execute
when a new Terminal window is created and
the second is how to identify the type of
Terminal.
Window Settings
Window Settings, also called Terminal Inspector (see
Figure 60-2), is for general-purpose and cosmetic
adjustments.
• Figure 60-2: The Terminal’s Window Settings controls
much of the Terminal’s behavior.
The Window Settings dialog lets you adjust many
features. Each setting can be altered by selecting an
option (listed next) from the drop-down list at the
top of the window. After selecting an option, each
subsequent panel uses some combination of radio
buttons, check boxes, and/or drop-down lists.

Shell: The only thing you can do here is dictate
what the Terminal does when you exit a shell.
Most likely, you’ll want to close the window.
To change what shell you use by default, use
the Terminal Preferences panel. Read about
the different shells in the upcoming section,
“Choosing Your Shell.”

Processes: Don’t touch the processes unless you
really, really know what you’re doing. For the
most part, the best use of the Processes panel is
to see what processes are running, particularly if
you have some going in the background.

Emulation: The Emulation panel lets you control
how the Terminal behaves (in other words, what
other tools it behaves like). You probably don’t
want to mess around here unless you decide to
turn on the audible and visual bells.

Buffer: The Buffer panel controls how much of
the data the Terminal has received is retained in
memory. You definitely want to enable this, and
the 10,000-line default usually is enough. You can
also tweak the Scrollback settings here.

Display: Use the Display panel to set how your
Terminal looks (see Figure 60-3). You can choose
a cursor, a font, and how characters look on the
screen. 
Select the Enable Drag Copy/Paste of Text
check box so you can easily copy (using the
mouse) and paste between the Terminal and
the Finder.
If you spend a lot of your time using the
Terminal to access UNIX servers, you might
have better luck changing the encoding (by

being run (vim) and the keyboard shortcut to
access this window (Ô-1).
• Figure 60-4: For the truly stylish Terminal geek, use an
image for the background.
• Figure 60-5: Customize your Terminal title with the
Window panel.
If you use the Terminal a lot, you can save a lot
of time by giving your Terminal windows a 
useful title. A title lets you easily select the right
Terminal window by seeing its name in Exposé or
when it’s minimized in the Dock. We recommend
that your Terminal title contain
 The active process name
 The .term filename (if a .term file — see
“Creating Terminal Preferences Files” — is
being used)
 The command key (Ô) shortcut
list) to ISO Latin 1. Local filenames might look
strange with this setting, but your remote file-
names (which are normally in ISO format) will
look correct.
• Figure 60-3: Use the Display panel to make your
Terminal more cosmetically pleasing.

Color: This panel is completely cosmetic, but
what’s wrong with that? Most likely you’ll want
to use black text on a white background for legi-
bility, but if you don’t worry about your eyesight,
go wild. You can even use an image as the back-
ground, although you’ll have to be careful with
the text color or else you’ll have a hard time
using the Terminal (see Figure 60-4).

Window: This panel is worth tinkering with.
You’ll want to set the dimensions of the Terminal
so that it fits nicely on your screen. The title sec-
tion of this window lets you give your Terminal a
useful or silly title. In Figure 60-5, for example,
the Terminal title shows the current command

Adjusting Terminal’s Preferences
465
You can also resize the Terminal window at
any time by clicking and dragging the lower-
right corner. This is likely to mess up the exist-
ing Terminal display, though.

Keyboard: The Keyboard tool is just downright
fantastic for people who use the Terminal regu-
larly. It allows you to map commands or text to
certain key combinations.
For example, with the Keyboard tool, you could
make a shortcut to list the current directory’s con-
tents as you want them:
1.
Open the Keyboard panel of the Window
Settings (see Figure 60-6).
• Figure 60-6: The Keyboard Terminal Inspector panel.
2.
Select the F5 line in the list of keys.
You don’t have to use F5, we’ve just selected that
arbitrarily.
3.
Click the Edit button.
4.
In the resulting dialog, select Shift from the
Modifier drop-down list.
5.
Leave the Action drop-down list as is (“send
string to shell”).
6.
In the text box, type du -sk * | sort -nr (see
Figure 60-7).
This is the basic command that you want to exe-
cute. It returns a list of files or folders and their
disk usage, sorted from most to least.
• Figure 60-7: Use the prompt to add a keyboard shortcut.
7.
Hold down the Option key and then press
Return.
The Option-Return combination adds a Return 
to the end of the command so that you don’t
have to press Return after using the keyboard
shortcut.
8.
Click OK or press Return.
9.
To use the shortcut, press Shift-F5 (or Shift-fn-F5
on a laptop).
See the results in Figure 60-8.
You can add new keyboard shortcuts (instead
of editing existing ones) by clicking the Add
button in the Keyboard panel.

Technique 60: Customizing Your Terminal
466
• Figure 60-9: The Terminal creates a .term file when you
save a window.
To use the .term file, you can

Choose it from the File➪Library menu (see
Figure 60-10).

Drag the .term file from the Finder onto the
Terminal icon.

Double-click the .term file (if it’s set to open in
the Terminal by default).
After you create a .term file, you can edit it in any
text editor.
You can edit a .term file manually by using
any text editor, although you’ll find that trying
to change colors in the file is ridiculously hard.
Even more handy than saving your preferences, your
.term files can automatically run commands when
they’re opened. Follow these steps to have the
Terminal immediately execute a command when you
open a new Terminal window:
• Figure 60-8: Create keyboard shortcuts to run common
commands quickly.
After you customize the Terminal, click the Use
Settings as Defaults button. If you want to create a
temporary set of preferences, use a .term file, which
we discuss in the next section.
Creating Terminal 
Preferences Files
If you use the Terminal, you probably use it a lot.
Changing your settings for each circumstance is
inconvenient. To work around this, you can create
.term files, which are like saved Terminal settings.
Follow these steps:
1.
Create a Terminal folder within the ~/Library/
Application Support folder.
2.
Open the Terminal.
3.
Adjust the settings as necessary.
See the preceding section for which settings you
want to work with.

Open the saved .term file in any text editor.
3.
Look for the code that reads
<key>ExecutionString</key>
4.
Between the <string></string> tags on the 
following line, type the command that you
want to run.
To execute multiple commands, separate each
with a semicolon.
5.
Save the file.
The next time you open this .term in the
Terminal, the commands are executed.
You can have the Terminal use this .term
automatically by selecting it in the Terminal
Preferences panel.
Choosing Your Shell
When you’re running the Terminal, you’re really
using a shell. A shell is a tool that allows you to inter-
act with the operating system. In other words, from
the command line, you don’t tell the OS anything
directly. You tell the shell what you want to do, and
the shell makes it happen. The only reason you need
to know this obscure fact is that you must know
what shell you’re running to be able to configure it.
Your Mac has all the popular shells:

sh: The Bourne shell.

csh: The C shell.

tcsh: A enhanced version of the C shell (called
the T shell).

bash: The Bourne Again shell. (Yes, that is its
name.)

zsh: A geeky, lesser-used shell that’s very 
powerful.
Tiger’s Terminal uses the bash shell by default. If
you’d rather use tcsh or any other shell, follow these
steps:
1.
Open the Terminal Preferences panel.
2.
Select the Execute This Command (Specify
Complete Path) radio button.
3.
Enter /bin/shellname as the command.
All the shells are located in the /bin directory.
To use tcsh instead of bash, type /bin/tcsh in the
text box (see Figure 60-11).
4.
Close the Terminal Preferences panel to save
your settings.
Features such as tab completion, using the
asterisk as a wildcard, and many other tricks
are parts of your shell, not the operating sys-
tem or the Terminal. You can find out more
about any shell by typing man bash or man
tcsh (for the man files on each) in the Terminal.

Technique 60: Customizing Your Terminal
468
Technique 59 shows how to use the pico text
editor.
2.
Enter different commands to customize your
shell.
 To have the Terminal print a message, type
echo “This is a message.”
The echo command prints out a string. You
can use anything as your message.
 To have the Terminal execute a command,
type it on its own line.
For example, you could have the Terminal
show you a calendar by entering cal on its
own line.
 Set your default text editor by typing setenv
EDITOR /path/to/editor.
If you’d like your shell to use a particular edi-
tor by default (for example, vi or emacs),
change this environmental setting. All the
command line editors are in /usr/bin, so
setenv EDITOR /usr/bin/vim makes vim
your default editor.
 Create aliases.
If you’re using tcsh, type alias aliasname
‘command’ — for example, alias mysite ‘ssh
-l user www.mysite.com’. If you’re using bash,
type alias aliasname=’command’.
Aliases let you use shortcuts for longer 
commands.
3.
Save the file and close pico.
4.
Create a new shell/Terminal window (by press-
ing Ô-N) to use the customization file (see
Figure 60-12).
A great site for information about configuring
shells is www.dotfiles.com. (But be sure to
take a rest first if you’re feeling a bit shell-
shocked.)
• Figure 60-11: You can tell the Terminal which shell to use.
Customizing Your Shell
Knowing what shell you’re using is important because
then you can create special files to customize its
behavior. Each shell automatically loads a configura-
tion file when a new shell is created (like when you
open a new Terminal window). You can use these con-
figuration files to

Print a message.

Create shortcuts for common commands.

Adjust your environment settings.

Automatically execute commands.
In these steps we demonstrate how to configure
your shell, using some sample configuration ideas:
1.
In the Terminal, type pico filename (filename is
the file for your shell).
 If you’re using bash, type pico .bash_profile.
 If you’re using tcsh, type pico .tcshrc. 
You don’t have to use pico to edit these, but
because they are hidden files (note the initial
period in the filename), you won’t see them in
the Finder.

Shareware Tools for Working
with the Terminal
You can use dozens of shareware and freeware appli-
cations with the Terminal. Some of the best free
tools are

Terminal Pal (http://freshlysqueezed
software.com/products/freeware) lets you
launch .term files from the Dock, which saves
you the step of loading the Terminal and then
selecting the .term file from the File➪Library
folder.

Terminal Here plug-in (www.pyehouse.com/
lynn/termopen.php) creates a contextual menu
item that allows you to instantly open the
Terminal but in the current directory.

Marc’s very own Open Terminal Here script
(www.entropy.ch/software/applescript)
resides in your Finder window toolbars and
opens the current directory in the Terminal.

Terminal Services (http://homepage.mac.
com/stas/terminalservices.html) creates a
service for running the selected text in the
Terminal. Another service option that it provides
is to fetch a URL in the Terminal by using the
curl tool.

Technique
Automating Your
Routines
O
ne big new feature in Tiger is a handy utility called Automator. This
application makes it easy for everyday Mac users to, um, automate
their routines. You can think of it like the non-programmer’s ver-
sion of AppleScript. Automator provides essentially the same functional-
ity as AppleScript without all that pesky code (although you can tie
AppleScripts and even shell scripts into Automator).
In this technique, we present a soup-to-nuts discussion of Automator. For
starters, you get a basic introduction to the application and why you
might want to use it. Then we run you through a simple example to get
your Automator blood pumping. Next you see how and where you can
save your example so that you can run it whenever you have the need.
And finally, we demonstrate a more elaborate and helpful use of this fine
new application by creating a multi-step routine that uses both the
Finder and Mail.
Introducing Automator
After you’ve used your Mac for any length of time, you develop certain
routines. For example, you might frequently need to

Resize a bunch of images imported from your digital camera.

Add more songs to your iPod.

Send an e-mail to someone whose birthday is coming up.

Load a certain collection of Web sites at once.
Some of the things you do are multi-step processes that require little
thought but lots of repetition. Others might not be that involving but can
still be done faster if automated. This is where our new favorite toy,
Automator, comes in.

Creating a Simple Workflow
471
Check out the Web site AutomatorWorld
(www.automatorworld.com). There you find
news about new Automator support for non-
Apple software as well as existing Workflows
(see the following section) that you can down-
load and run on your Mac.
The premise behind Automator is that by using a
simple interface and not much computer savvy, you
can have Tiger automatically run entire routines.
These routines are called Workflows in Automator,
and you find out how to create them in the following
section.
Creating a Simple Workflow
You use Automator to create Workflows, which are
memorized sequences of steps. Workflows are cre-
ated by defining which steps (Actions) are taken with
an application. The beauty of Automator is that it
already knows all the available Actions for Apple
applications. (Apple’s getting better and better at
convincing you to use its software.) When you know
what you’re trying to accomplish, automating that
process is just a matter of clicking and dragging your
way through Automator. We go through one simple
example in this section, and then show you how to
create another, more elaborate sequence in the sec-
tion “Creating a More Complex Workflow.”
Automator, as it ships in Tiger, has defined
Actions for Apple applications. But you proba-
bly use applications that aren’t made by Apple
as well, right? If so, check out the resources for
those applications to see whether or when that
manufacturer starts supplying Actions for its
software.
In this first example, you create a basic Workflow
that sets the Desktop picture. It’s a somewhat trivial
use of the technology but does a great job of demon-
strating the process and giving you a starting point.
1.
Open Automator (found in the Applications
directory).
2.
Click the Finder title in the Library column,
under Applications.
The Library column contains three folders by
default:
 Applications
 Example Workflows
 My Workflows
The Applications folder is where you find a list of
all Automator-supported applications. Obviously
it’s the most important folder when it comes to
creating Workflows. The Example Workflows
folder lists completed, sample routines and the
My Workflows folder is where you store and find
your completed work.
Automator comes with a handful of Workflows
already. You find these in the Example
Workflows folder, toward the bottom of the
Library window. Even if none of the included
Workflows are useful to you, checking them
out can help you better understand how to
use the application as a whole.
3.
Click on the Ask for Finder Items option in the
Action column (see Figure 61-1).
All of the available Actions for the application
selected in the Library column appear in the
Action column. Clicking once on any of these
Actions selects it and shows a description of
that Action in the bottom panel.
4.
Drag the Ask for Finder Items Action into the
rightmost column (see Figure 61-2).
This is all you need to do to add a step to your
sequence. The Ask for Finder Items Action pres-
ents a standard Open dialog so that the user may
select a file.
You can delete an Action by clicking the X in
the upper-right corner of that Action’s box.
Clicking once on an action in the third column
shows its description again. If you add an
Action for an application that isn’t currently
open, Tiger opens it for you.

Technique 61: Automating Your Routines
472
 What type of thing the user can select
Use the Type drop-down list to change this
value. You can allow the user to select just
Files, both Files and Folders, or just Folders.
For this example, Files is the proper option.
 What directory the dialog should start out in
Use the Start At drop-down list to change this
value. Because this example chooses a new
Desktop picture, it makes sense to have the
dialog open within the user’s Pictures folder.
 The prompt given to the user
This is what the user sees when running the
Workflow. It should be informative, like
Choose a file to use as the Desktop picture.
 Whether to allow multiple selections
If the user should be able to select multiple
files, select the Allow Multiple Selection check
box. This makes sense if you’re e-mailing mul-
tiple documents or resizing a bunch of images
at once. For choosing a Desktop picture, if the
user selects multiple files, the Desktop rotates
through them in timed increments.
• Figure 61-3: You can customize an Action.
6.
Drag the Set the Desktop Picture Action into
the third column (see Figure 61-4).
• Figure 61-1: Find out what an Action does by selecting it
and viewing the description.
• Figure 61-2: The first step has been added to the
sequence.
5.
Customize the Ask for Finder Items Action (see
Figure 61-3).
Different Actions can be customized in different
ways. For the Ask for Finder Items Action, you
have four options:

Saving and Running Your Workflow
473
Add the new Action after the first one because
that’s the order in which you want the steps 
to run. (When you drag a new Action into the
steps column, it’s automatically numbered for
you.) This particular Action can’t be further 
customized.
• Figure 61-4: The complete two-step sequence.
Frequently, the results of one step are fed
into the next step. For example, an image
is selected and then used as the Desktop pic-
ture. If you attempt to create a sequence that
doesn’t make sense (such as selecting an
Address Book record and trying to copy those
files), Automator shows its confusion by high-
lighting the input and output of the steps in
red. If you see this, you’ve done something
wrong. Pay attention to the Input and Result
fields of the Action descriptions, insuring that
they match (see Figure 61-5)!
7.
Test your Workflow by clicking the Run button.
Before saving a sequence, make sure that it
works. Clicking the Run button starts the steps.
In this case, the Finder should present you with 
a dialog in which you can choose a picture and
then this picture should be set as your Desktop.
• Figure 61-5: An invalid sequence, where the output of
one step doesn’t match the expected input
of the next one.
Now that you’ve developed a working Workflow, you
need to discover how to save and run it. The options
are numerous, so see the following section.
Saving and Running 
Your Workflow
Discovering how to create a Workflow is an impor-
tant and obvious step, but understanding how you
can save your Workflow is just as critical. How you
save a Workflow dictates how easily you can run the
sequence when you need to. After you’ve written
and tested your Workflow, these are the next logical
steps to take:

Save the Workflow by choosing File➪Save.
After you do this, you’re presented with a Save
dialog. Give the Workflow a proper, descriptive
name (such as Set Desktop Picture), and save it
somewhere in your Home directory (you might
want to create an Automator folder within
Documents). You can run Workflows saved this
way by opening them in Automator and clicking
the Run button (or by pressing Ô-R).

Technique 61: Automating Your Routines
474
put this plug-in in several places, making it avail-
able through different channels. Five of the most
useful options are
• Figure 61-7: Saving a Workflow as a plug-in.
 Finder
If you create a Finder plug-in, it’s available as
a contextual menu item (see Figure 61-8).
• Figure 61-8: Workflows saved as Finder plug-ins can be
run using a contextual menu.
 Folder Actions
Folder Actions are sequences assigned to 
specific folders. For example, you could have
a folder that automatically resizes any image
dropped in it. To assign a Workflow as a
If you save a Workflow in your Home direc-
tory (not in a subfolder therein), it’s automati-
cally added to your My Workflows folder,
which makes it more accessible. If you’d rather
store your Workflows in another directory,
that’s fine, but you’ll need to open or import it
into Automator (using the corresponding File
menu option) before you can run or edit it.
Get in the habit of always first saving
Workflows by using the File➪Save method.
This way you can open the Workflow and edit
it at a later time. You might also want to then
save your Workflows by using these other
methods because they have their own bene-
fits. You should do a standard save first,
because if you save your Workflows as only a
standalone application or as a plug-in, you
won’t be able to edit them later.

Save the Workflow as a standalone application.
The Save dialog also provides a drop-down list
(see Figure 61-6), letting you save the Workflow
as just a plain Workflow or as a standalone appli-
cation. If you choose the latter, you can run the
sequence without opening Automator. To do so,
just double-click the file in the Finder (the
Workflow runs through the Automator Launcher
instead).
• Figure 61-6: You can save a Workflow as a standalone
application.

Save the Workflow as a plug-in by choosing
File➪Save As Plug-In (see Figure 61-7). If you
choose File➪Save As Plug-In, you really increase
the ease of rerunning your sequence. You can

Creating a More Complex Workflow
475
Folder Action, just select Folder Action from
the Plug-In For drop-down list, and then select
the desired folder from the Attached to Folder
drop-down list that appears.
 Font Book
The Font Book application has its own Actions
(see Technique 28). Any plug-in added there is
an option the next time you open Font Book.
 Print Workflow
The Print Workflow is a special button of
options that appear in a Print dialog (see
Technique 26). If you have a printing-related
sequence, save it as a Print Workflow plug-in
to quickly run it the next time you print a 
document.
 Script Menu
The Script Menu appears in the menu bar at
the top of the display (assuming that you’ve
enabled it by using the AppleScript Utility in
the Actions➪AppleScript folder). Added
Workflow plug-ins can be stored here, making
them easily and universally available.
How you save a Workflow affects how and
from where you can run it. Make good use of
the plug-in option in order to access your
Workflow through contextual menus, the
Script Menu, and so forth. You can even save
the same Workflow as multiple types of plug-
ins so it’s always readily available!
Creating a More Complex
Workflow
The basic example, although practical and functional,
doesn’t really demonstrate how easily you can use
Automator to create a sequence of steps. So in this
last section you create a more involved Workflow. The
demonstration will be a “start the day” Workflow,
using three different applications. First, iTunes will
start playing a specific playlist. Then, Safari will open
two favorite Web sites. Finally, the Mail application
will check for new e-mail.
For more complex Workflows, think or write
out what you want to accomplish and what
you think those steps will be before going into
Automator.
This is what you need to do to make this happen:
1.
Open Automator, if it isn’t already open.
2.
Click the iTunes item in the Library column.
The majority of your Workflows probably involve
the Finder to some extent.
3.
Drag the Get Specified iTunes Items Action into
the rightmost column.
This Action lets you choose, in advance, a song
or playlist. 
4.
Customize the Get Specified iTunes Items
Action.
What you need to do is add a specific item (or
items). To do so, 
a. Click the plus button to bring up the prompt
(see Figure 61-9).
• Figure 61-9: The prompt shows my iTunes library so that I
may select items from it.

Technique 61: Automating Your Routines
476
• Figure 61-10: The third Action has been added and
customized.
10.
Click the Mail item in the Library column.
11.
Drag the Get New Mail Action into the third 
column.
12.
Customize the Get New Mail Action, as needed
(see Figure 6-11).
• Figure 61-11: If subsequent Actions are unrelated, you
can sometimes tell Automator to have the
one ignore the other.
b. Select a playlist from the top part of the win-
dow or select a song from the bottom part of
the window.
c. Click Add.
You can add multiple items by repeating these
steps (click the plus sign and so forth) or by
Ô-clicking multiple items within the iTunes
prompt. The prompt also has a Search box so
that you can more easily find a specific item.
5.
Drag the Start iTunes Playing Action into the
third column.
iTunes begins playing the items selected in the
previous step.
6.
Click the Safari item in the Library column.
Now you can customize what you want Safari to
do in this Workflow.
7.
Drag the Get Specified URLs Action into the
third column.
This Action is much like the Get Specified iTunes
Items Action, letting you dictate what URLs
should be used in the following step.
8.
Customize the Get Specified URLs Action (see
Figure 6-10).
For this Action, it’s a matter of adding URLs
(Apple’s URL is automatically added). Simply:
a. Click the plus button.
b. Double-click URL name, the newly added
item’s bookmark title. (Each new item will
appear at the top of the list with URL name
as the title and http:// as the address.)
c. Type in the name you want to give this item.
d. Press Tab.
e. Type in the URL for this item.
f. Press Return.
9.
Drag the Display Webpages Action into the
third column.
This Action will do the actual loading of the URLs
set in the previous Action.

Creating a More Complex Workflow
477
One option is to choose for which accounts new
e-mail should be downloaded. Another step you
can take is to tell this Action to ignore the results
from the previous Action (refer to Figure 61-11).
In this example, the previous Action results in
Safari documents, which aren’t needed by the
Get New Email Action. Telling this later Action to
ignore the previous results isn’t required, but 
is a good idea.
13.
Test your Workflow by clicking the Run button.
14.
Save your Workflow by using the options that
we outline in “Saving and Running Your
Workflow.”
Just because you’ve created a Workflow that
runs on your computer doesn’t mean that 
it’s good only for you. You can share your
Workflows with family and friends because
most Workflows run on other computers (at
least ones that run Tiger, that is) with little or
no modification.

Technique
Entertaining
Yourself with
Screen Savers
T
he Mac has always been an attractive operating system, complete
with some pretty nice screen savers. Unlike all those boring ones
that Windows users see — most of which just promote Microsoft
and its products — your Mac can display flying toasters, an aquarium, or
complex fractals. Even though screen savers no longer serve any practi-
cal purpose whatsoever (it’s virtually impossible to burn an image onto
your display), there’s nothing wrong with some good old-fashioned eye
candy.
This technique is long on cool and short on boring. We begin with some
information about Tiger and screen savers. This section is practical for
most users, and you’ll see some nice tips. Next, we tell you where you
can get more screen savers (for those of you addicted to them) and how
to install the suckers. Finally, we show you one way-cool trick, which is of
absolutely no practical benefit to you at all! All in all, you’re not going to
find much in the way of increasing your productivity here (just the oppo-
site, in fact), but all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, right?
Configuring Screen Savers in Tiger
If you don’t like screen savers, you should at least read this section of 
the book to know how to turn the things off. If you like screen savers, you
should read this section to discover how to configure them. If you’re
indifferent toward screen savers, read this anyway. What do you care?
You can control your screen savers from the Screen Saver tab of the
Desktop & Screen Saver panel of System Preferences (see Figure 62-1).
The left column lets you choose what screen saver to run. The right col-
umn displays a preview of the selected screen saver. Under the preview
is the Options button, which lets you configure the selected screen saver
(for those that are configurable; see Figure 62-2) and the Test button to
preview it.

• Figure 62-1: Control your screen saver settings here.
• Figure 62-2: If a screen saver can be configured, clicking
the Options button brings up a configuration
panel.
Toward the bottom of the Screen Saver tab are two
important controls:

A Start Screen Saver slider that lets you control
when to start the screen saver: You can set the
screen saver to start after a certain amount of
idle time or never at all. Keep in mind that if this
value is longer than the sleep or display sleep
settings in the Energy Saver panel (see Figure
62-3), you’ll never, ever see the screen saver.
Your machine goes to sleep before the screen
saver ever kicks in.
• Figure 62-3: Your computer’s Energy Saver settings could
affect whether you ever see the screen
saver.
To disable screen savers, set the Start Screen
Saver slider (in the Screen Saver panel) to
Never. It doesn’t matter which screen saver is
selected.

A Hot Corners button that lets you set hot cor-
ners: Here’s our advice: Don’t use hot corners to
activate your screen saver. Save them for Exposé
and Dashboard, which are far more useful and
important than a screen saver. Also, there’s a
decent chance that you’ll set a hot corner to acti-
vate the screen saver and then inadvertently hit

Technique 62: Entertaining Yourself with Screen Savers
480
The best, perhaps only, reason to set a hot cor-
ner to activate your screen saver is if you set
up your computer to require a password to
return from displaying a screen saver. If you’re
in a multi-user environment, select the Require
Password to Wake This Computer from Sleep
or Screen Saver check box in the Security
panel (see Figure 62-4), and then move your
cursor to the hot corner before you leave your
desk. By using this method, you can quickly
secure your computer before you walk away
from it. (Any mischief-makers must enter your
password to wreak havoc with your system.)
Adding to Your Screen 
Saver Library
Your Mac comes with a half-dozen screen savers out
of the box, but you don’t have to be satisfied with
those. You can download and use dozens of screen
savers. Here are some Web sites where you can find
collections to download:

WhiteBox: http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/

Many, but not necessarily all of the collections in the
preceding list, are free (free!).
These are some of our particular favorite individual
screen savers:

After Dark X + Fish: http://en.infinisys.
co.jp/product/adx/index.shtml, $18
After Dark was the screen saver for many years.
Then people stopped using screen savers
that corner when you’re working (or playing a
game) and momentarily throw your whole system
out of whack. If you’re doing a presentation, you
might find the Disable Screen Saver hot corner
useful (configurable by clicking the Hot Corners
button), but if you’re doing a presentation, you
ought to disable screen savers entirely anyway.
The Desktop & Screen Saver and Exposé pan-
els both let you set the hot corners for screen
savers and Exposé functions.
The Desktop & Screen Saver panel isn’t the only
panel that affects how screen savers run on your
computer, and we’re not just talking about the
Energy Saver panel. A much more critical option is
found within the Security panel of System
Preferences (see Figure 62-4). There you can set
Tiger to require a password when the computer is
awoken from sleeping or returns from displaying a
screen saver. This protects your computer while
you’re away if you’re in a multi-user environment
(like an office) or have some rambunctious pets that
like to walk across your keyboard.

to enter a password to reactivate the
computer.

entirely (or so the story goes). Then came
Marine Aquarium (see the next bullet), which
opened up the world’s eyes to how fun a screen
saver can be. The latest version of After Dark,
put out by Infinisys, has many modules, from the
toasters to the aquarium to a Mandelbrot set.
Definitely worth the sawbuck!

Marine Aquarium 2:
www.serenescreen.com/product/maquariumx/
index.php, $20
Marine Aquarium 2 (from SereneScreen) creates
a beautiful virtual fish tank, using dozens of
types of fish plus a healthy dose of coral. You
can run this as a screen saver or all by itself.
Another version of the Marine Aquarium is avail-
able, and it displays the current date and time on
a crystal located in the tank.
To install a screen saver, follow these steps:
1.
Download the file from the Web site.
2.
Decompress and/or mount the downloaded file.
The downloaded file is most likely in some sort
of compressed format, like .sit or .gz. You’ll
need to use StuffIt Expander to decompress it. If
the file then has a .dmg extension, double-click it
to mount it as a disk image. After you have either
a folder or a disk image left (see Figure 62-5), you
can install the file.
• Figure 62-5: The downloaded screen saver, as it appears
as a mounted disk image.
3.
Move the screen saver file to ~/Library/Screen
Savers, where ~ refers to your Home directory
(see Figure 62-6).
The screen saver itself has a .saver file extension.
Move this into your Library/Screen Savers
folder to add it to your available entertainment.
• Figure 62-6: Add the new screen saver to your Screen
Savers folder.
If your Library folder doesn’t already have a
Screen Savers directory, create one. You can
also add screen savers to /Library/Screen
Savers, which makes them available to all
users. If you do this, though, they won’t be
backed up with the rest of your stuff and can
easily be lost during operating system upgrades
or transitions from one computer to another.
4.
Open System Preferences.
You can’t select and use your screen saver
unless you open the Screen Saver panel after
the screen saver has been added to your 
system. If the panel was open when you
added the new file, quit and reopen System
Preferences.
5.
Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon.
6.
Click the Screen Saver tab.
7.
Select and configure the new screen saver (see
Figure 62-7).
The screen savers that you’ve installed appear in
the middle group of listings in the left column.
Here’s another really cool way to add screen
savers: Use iPhoto. Your photo albums in
iPhoto are automatically added as potential

Technique 62: Entertaining Yourself with Screen Savers
482
Using the Desktop 
as a Screen Saver
In a technique that discusses nothing but eye candy,
this trick takes the cake. You can have a screen
saver — any screen saver — run in place of the
Desktop image. It slows down your computer like
few other things can, but it looks so cool.
Unless you have a Quartz Extreme–compati-
ble computer with a really good processor (or
a dual-processor, ideally), don’t plan on doing
anything else when running a screen saver on
your Desktop. We found this to be really slug-
gish on a 550 MHz G4 PowerBook but not
too bad on a 933 MHz G4 iBook.
1.
Go to http://software.couthouis.com and
download a copy of CoolBackground.
2.
Unstuff the downloaded file if it doesn’t auto-
matically unstuff, and then open the resulting
folder.
3.
Copy the CoolBackground application to your
Applications or Utilities folder.
4.
Run the CoolBackground application (see
Figure 62-9).
• Figure 62-9: CoolBackground has a very simple interface.
slideshows at the bottom of the list of screen
savers. You can select a photo album to run as
a slideshow and even configure it (see Figure
62-8). Alternatively, if you have album cover
art in your iTunes library, that can be used as a
screen saver.
• Figure 62-7: Select and configure the new screen saver.
• Figure 62-8: Select and configure a new screen saver
from iPhoto images.

Using the Desktop as a Screen Saver
483
5.
Configure CoolBackground as you want, and
press Start.
The result is the selected screen saver run-
ning as your Desktop (see Figure 62-10)! If you 
have multiple monitors, one monitor runs the
screen saver while the other has a solid black
background.
Here’s a good tip for any Mac user: if you like
the shareware provided by others, encourage
the developers by paying for it. Click the
CoolBackground Contribute button to donate
a couple bucks for a job well done.
