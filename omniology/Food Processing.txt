Preface
Preface
The increasing global demand for processed foods has led to a greater prominence of the food industry, its specific needs and 
processing challenges. Consequently, in recent times the role of the engineer in the food industry has gained considerable 
prominence. In contrast to other more traditional processing industries, the raw materials or ingredients that are used 
tend to be of greater complexity in nature. While processing conditions are also more moderate in that temperatures even 
in hottest ovens may not exceed 200oC and pressures rarely exceed one or two bar, the materials themselves are highly 
complex in composition, textural and flavour characteristics. During their handing and processing, many changes to 
their properties occur. The extent of these changes is often a strong function of their process history. In the food industry 
one plant frequently is required to perform one purpose. To produce a product which is constituent and desirable to the 
consumer’s expectations in terms of appearance, texture and taste all year round from raw materials which may be derived 
from different sources or suppliers together with seasonal variability, requires a sound understanding of the physical and 
chemical properties of the food materials being processed and the detailed understanding of the function of various units 
operations. In all of this, food safety is paramount. Understanding the nature and sources of contamination is essential, 
and its control critical to ensure that the processed foods are safe to eat. Product safety is as critical as process safety.
This e-book is aimed at undergraduates and practitioners who have an interest in food process engineering. It is designed 
to provide an overview of the many operations associated with the processing of raw food materials to produce products 
which are creative, palatable and safe to eat. If you should find any errors or inaccuracies, or wish to offer feedback or 
suggestions for improvements, you are encouraged to email me. I hope the reader will find this e-book useful.

Introduction
1	 Introduction
Over the past couple of decades, the role of the engineer in the food industry has gained considerable prominence. 
The food processing industry is extremely complex, diverse and evolved. With a consumer market becoming evermore 
sophisticated and demanding, there is a continual need for process innovation. Even allowing for the demands of the 
consumer for product consistency and quality, the consumer expects excitement, novelty, value for money and a product 
that is safe in tamper-proof packaging. For the food process engineer, the challenge is to use process plant and associated 
equipment which is sufficiently flexible to respond to any changes in demand. 
The complexity and challenges of food processing engineering is best illustrated by considering the mixing criteria used 
in the food industry. Process engineers will be more familiar with the handling and mixing of robust components with 
the aim of achieving homogeneity in which liquids have low viscosity or exhibit straightforward Newtonian behaviour 
and where scale-up is based on simple power-to-volume ratios.
In contrast, the criteria for food mixing involve ingredients which have complex components with each exhibiting very 
different chemical and physical properties. They often have high viscosities and exhibit non-Newtonian behaviour. They 
may also be fragile in nature and easily damaged during high shear mixing in which there is a complex and intimate 
relationship between the mixing patterns and product characteristics. The scale-up of equipment is governed by the need 
to maintain textural properties of food.
All of this is further complicated by the need to maintain product quality in terms of texture, colour, appearance, rheology, 
functionality, aeration, droplet size and particulate integrity particularly when the raw materials used are subject to possible 
day-to-day and seasonal variations. It is essential that the food products are safe to eat, free from contamination, produced 
in a safe environment that conforms to food safety standards and other legal requirements. Finally, the process engineer 
must ensure that the process operation is energy efficient and has minimal environmental impact.
Further, the food process engineer is not only required to have a high regard for all the technical aspects associated 
with the processing of foods but that the needs and requirements of the consumer are fully appreciated. Consumers are 
increasingly demanding foods which are nutritious and healthy such as fortified organic and minimally processed foods. 
There is also a considerable demand for foods which are highly processed such as sausages, burgers, baked beans and 
dehydrated foods, and foods which have long shelf-life and total sterility such as canned and bottled foods with packaging 
that is tamper-proof yet can be easily opened.
Yet if that isn’t sufficient, the food process engineer must also have a high regard for the food and drink marketplace which 
is characterised by short time-to-market and competitiveness, production innovation and product complexity. Production 
runs are becoming ever shorter as tastes and fads change.

Introduction
While food processing may be classified into either chemical, physical or biological operations, there are many major 
issues affecting food process engineering including molecular genetics with the use of GMOs, the use of animal cloning, 
new regulatory procedures, ethical issues, public concerns, planetary considerations and a number of major socio-
economic considerations. The underlying requirements for technological progress in food processing are a minimum 
of risks acceptable for the benefits gains, as well as a full public understanding. The role of the food process engineer is 
critical in all of this.
1.1	
Food Processing
The fundamental necessity for food is to sustain life. The principal reason for the processing food is to make it 
microbiologically safe to eat. Processing foods can transform unpalatable or unacceptable raw materials into attractive 
and desirable products.
Nutritional requirements are required to be met throughout the year. Before the development of preservation techniques, 
winter diets were based mainly on cereals, grains and fruit that were dried on the plant before harvesting. In Northern 
Europe livestock such as pigs and cows were once slaughtered in the autumn, as there were insufficient foods available 
to sustain them during the winter months. The meat was then preserved by salting and curing allowing it to be available 
for out-of-season consumption.
In the processing of foods, it might be assumed that a food product ought to resemble the appearance and taste of the raw 
food material. While this is the case for tinned or frozen garden peas, foods such as smoked sausages and canned baked 
beans are quite different from their fresh precursors and are, in some cases, even more popular. 
Over the centuries, producers and consumers have become geographically separated through increased urbanisation; 
supermarkets have flourished which can now handle foods with a minimum of specialised equipment. Tinned and 
bottled products have a long storage life and require little specialist storage. Diary products with a short shelf-life such as 
pasteurised milk require little more than refrigeration.
1.2	
Food Safety and Control
The highest priority of the food industry is to ensure that the foods which are processed are safe to consume. In recent 
times, there has been much publicity concerning major issues such as BSE in beef, genetically modified crops, nitrates in 
water, dioxins in livestock, listeria in blue cheese, E. coli 0157 in cooked meats and melamine in infants’ milk to name 
but a few. A major cause of illness in humans is due to foods contaminated due to poor processing conditions, sanitation, 
working practices and packaging.
Storing food to prevent spoilage often involves destroying or inactivating contaminating pests such as insects, rodents and 
microorganisms. When these are capable of producing disease in humans (that is, they are pathogenic) this becomes even 
more important. The cooking of meat, for example, destroys both spoilage and pathogenic organisms. If care is taken by 
the provision of a suitable barrier, as in canning, to ensure that they are not reintroduced, the storage life of the product 
may be extended from a few to hundreds of days.

Introduction
Once a contaminated food is ingested, the organism continues to multiply inside the body, reaching a population size 
sufficient to cause noticeable symptoms. Depending on the organism and food, control is either by ensuring that the 
contaminating organism is unable to infect the food in the first place or by destroying it during a cooking process.
As examples, the harmful bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, is readily destroyed by the normal cooking process. Its toxin, 
however, is very resistant to boiling. Botulism is a very serious type of poisoning caused by eating food containing the 
toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum for which the spores are very resistant to many cooking processes.
It is not always necessary to eliminate all contaminating organisms. It may often be necessary to ensure a satisfactory level 
of safety under given storage conditions. Commercial sterilisation is designed to destroy all micro-organisms and spores, 
which if present, could multiply in the food while pasteurisation is designed to destroy only those microorganisms which 
are pathogenic. It makes no attempt at destroying all the microorganisms that may be present.
The growth and viability of micro-organisms in foods is influenced by the availability of water. The presence of high 
concentrations of osmotically active substances such as salt or sugar also influences growth and viability as well as the 
presence of acids. Preserved foods vary from neutral pH to acidic. Only fungi are likely to grow below pH 3.7 although 
a mild heat treatment is often desirable for foods in this category to stop fungal spoilage and inactivate enzymes. Acidic 
foods, such as fruit, require pasteurisation to destroy vegetative organisms. It is not always necessary for spores to be 
destroyed in this pH range, as any spores present are unable to germinate below pH 4.5. Low acidic foods such meat, fish 
and milk require sterilisation to ensure that resistant spores are destroyed. 
Since heat treatment often affects the quality, appearance, texture and taste of food as well as micro-organism content, 
the choice of heat treatment conditions is important. Heat is an effective way of eliminating microbial hazards when 
combined with adequate hygienic practices, such as the hygiene of personnel and sterilisation of equipment. This also 
helps to minimise the chance of infection with the larger human parasites such as tapeworms and roundworms.
Heat treatment is a requirement by law for many products. UK and European regulations require that food consisting of 
meat, fish, milk and egg must be stored below 10oC or above 62oC unless displayed for sale or intended for immediate 
consumption. This is because the pathogenic bacteria, Salmonellae, Staphylococci, Streptococci and Clostridia are unable 
to reproduce outside this temperature range. 
1.3	
Food Quality
The properties and qualities of foods, which affect acceptability to the consumer, are referred to as organoleptic properties. 
It is impossible to quantify the definition of food quality because it varies between each person’s expectations. Food may 
be liked or indeed disliked as a consequence of many factors which may be religious, cultural, social, psychological or on 
health grounds, as well as certain expectations of appearance, texture, flavour and aroma.

Introduction
Consumers are generally concerned that the quality of a food product has a consistent standard, which may be defined in 
terms of its organoleptic properties. Food producers, farmers, caterers and food manufacturers must therefore be capable 
of maintaining certain objective quality standards. The quality of certain products can be tested by a trained panel of 
experts who can detect whether a product has attained a necessary standard. However, it is rather expensive to use expert 
panels. Mechanical or electronic techniques and instruments are therefore frequently used which are capable of providing 
an objective measurement of a particular attribute.
1.3.1	
Temperature
The temperature of a food is the easiest attribute to measure and involves a thermocouple linked to a data logger. This 
can provide important information on the physical, chemical and microbiological changes taking place before, during 
and after processing.
1.3.2	
Colour
The perception of colour depends on both physical and psychological factors. Spectral colour is defined by the predominant 
wavelength of light while saturation is defined as the degree of mixture of that dominant colour with white. Brightness, 
on the other hand, is associated with the total amount of light energy reflected or transmitted by the food. The colour of 
food is most easily measured by matching with standard colours under standard lighting conditions.
Standard lighting colour, along with humidity and temperature control is used during sensory analysis with trained 
assessors as shown in the photograph below.
1.3.3	
Texture
Texture is a complex property relating to the physical and chemical structure of the food. Foods range from hard to soft, 
brittle to chewy. Hardness is a measure of the force required to cause a given deformation. Softness means that food can be 
squashed easily between the teeth although disintegration may occur. Cohesiveness and gumminess is the strength which 
holds the food together and the resistance to the withdrawal of teeth, respectively. In contrast, chewiness is the energy 
needed to disintegrate the food. The elasticity of foods is the rate at which a deformed material returns to its original 
shape and adhesiveness is the work necessary to overcome the attractive forces between the surface of the material and 
the other surfaces in contact with it. Brittleness is the force necessary to cause fracture. Applied to liquids, viscosity is a 
measure of its thickness or thinness.

Introduction
To measure the texture of foods, various instruments such as penetrometers are used. These are probes which travel a 
certain distance into a sample of food when subjected to an applied force. Viscometers are used to measure the consistency 
of sauces, dressings, purées and batters.
1.3.4	
Flavour and Taste
Foods may be liked or disliked based on flavour and taste alone. Flavour components may be present in food in minute 
quantities. Flavour can be distinguished into the four elements of sweetness, acidity, bitterness and salt. All are sensed by 
specific cells on the tongue. Taste is these basic flavours combined with odours, sensed in the nose, which arise from the 
volatile components of the food. Sweetness, for example, is associated with sugars while acidity is associated with organic 
acids such as vinegar, or mineral acids such as phosphoric acid in cola. A number of compounds in addition to common 
salt give rise to saltiness, including sulphates, bicarbonates, nitrates and phosphates of calcium, potassium, magnesium 
and ammonium. Bitterness arises from tannins in tea.

Constituents of Food
2	 Constituents of Food
2.1	
Introduction
In order to process foods by converting raw materials into creative, desirable, attractive and appealing products that are both 
safe to consume and have year-round consistency, its essential that the food process engineer has a firm understanding of 
the food constituents and their interacting behaviour. Foods by their very nature are often complex and multi-component 
in composition. As well as water, foods also include carbohydrates, proteins, fats and oils. Also present in lesser but 
nonetheless important amounts are flavours, vitamins, minerals and additives such as preservatives. Not all foods contain 
all of these components nor in equal quantities.
2.2	
Water
In many foods, water is the most abundant constituent. Fruit, vegetables, juices, milk, fish and meat all contain high levels 
of water. Cheese, bread, biscuits and cakes on the other hand, contain relatively less levels of moisture while dehydrated 
foods and powders contain virtually none. The presence of moisture is critical in the textural properties of a food but is 
often responsible for its microbial, enzymatic and chemical deterioration.
2.3	
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates provide much of the energy in our diets. Most is found in the form of polysaccharides as starch derived 
from plant cells. Simple sugars as mono or disaccharides are mainly derived from cane, beet sugar and honey which 
contribute to sweetness, texture and colour in foods. 
The main constituents of starch are amylose and amylopectin. Starch in maize is entirely made up of amylopectin molecules, 
whereas in wheat a quarter is amylose with the remainder being amylopectin. Starch does not dissolve in cold water, but 
when heated to 60oC, water diffuses through the walls of the starch granules, causing swelling and the viscosity of the 
starch suspension to increase. Further heating causes the granules burst giving a viscous gel. Thick sauces and gravies 
are prepared using flour. When starch is heated in an acidic medium, however, the starch becomes partly hydrolysed to 
a mixture of sugars and dextrins causing a reduction in viscosity.
There are many types and derivations of sugar types. Many are used in the manufacture of confectionary. Non-crystalline 
confectionary includes caramels, brittles, marshmallows and gumdrops whereas crystalline confectionary includes fudge 
and fondants. 
Candies are made of sucrose, water or some other liquids. Their manufacture involves producing a supersaturated sucrose 
solution. This involves heating the concentrated sugar solution and allowing it to cool undisturbed. Upon cooling the sugar 
crystallises. For crystallisation to occur, nuclei must form either spontaneously or by seeding to initiate crystallisation. 
The size of the resulting crystals depends on the number of nuclei, rate and temperature of crystallisation, agitation and 
impurities in the solution. Butter is often added to deliberately interfere with the formation of crystal growth.

Caramelisation is the application of heat to the point that sugars dehydrate and breakdown and polymerize. This is called 
“non-enzymatic browning” because it does not involve enzymes. Caramel has a pungent taste and is often bitter. It is much 
less sweet than the original sugar from which it is produced, is non-crystalline, and is soluble in water. Both the extent 
and rate of the caramelisation reaction are influenced by the type of sugar being heated. Galactose, sucrose and glucose 
all caramelise around 160oC whereas fructose caramelises at 110oC and maltose at about 180oC. 
The Maillard reaction is the reaction between the amino group of a protein or amino acid and the reducing group of a 
reducing sugar. The type of sugar and the type of amino acids influence the colour obtained which may range from yellow 
to red. Not all sugars are reducing sugars. The most effective reducing sugars are fructose, glucose, maltose, galactose and 
lactose. Note that the commonly used sugar sucrose is not a reducing sugar. 
2.4	
Fats and oils
As well as being a major source of energy in the diet, fats and oils play an important role in the palatability of foods. In 
terms of bakery properties both fats and margarine are important in that they:
• 
influence eating properties
• 
influence flavour release
• 
influence batter and baking properties
• 
provide coherence and consistency to doughs
• 
allow aeration to be possible
• 
contribute to colour
• 
provide a shining or glossy appearance to bread
• 
influence shelf-life through moisture loss reduction
The main difference between fats and oils is that oils are liquids at room temperature whereas fats are solid. The term “fat” 
is commonly used for lard (pork fat) or tallow (beef fat). The extraction of fats and oils is achieved by:
• 
Rendering: used mostly for fat tissue from slaughtered animals. This includes beef, pork, deer, sheep and 
fish.
• 
Pressing: used for oil-containing seeds and fruits. The colour, taste and aroma are specific to the type of seed 
or fruit. Oils include peanuts, olive, corn, sesame, soy, sunflower, rape and palm.
• 
Extraction: used for fat-containing material using organic solvents.
Most refined fats and oils are used as a raw material for the production of margarine, mayonnaise and fat for frying, 
baking and roasting. The process of changing their consistency includes:
• 
Hydrogenation: This hardening process gives a firmer consistency to oils.
• 
Fractionation: Used to separate fats into fractions with different melting points.
• 
Esterification: Used to give a suitable firmness and spreadability as fats.

Edible fat is a mixture of animal and/or vegetable fats. The term “butter” is applied only for the fatty substance from milk, 
which has been obtained from the butter-making process. The term “margarine”, on the other hand, is a copy of butter.
The type of fat or oil present directly affects the textural qualities of foods, including a smooth mouth-feel and the flavour 
of many dishes and foods. Chips cooked in a vegetable oil have a different flavour from those cooked in lard. The texture 
of a fat is dependent on its physical state; suet (beef fat) is hard at room temperature of 20oC, whereas vegetable cooking 
oils are liquid and some margarines are soft at this temperature. The melting point of a fat or oil depends on the fatty 
acid chain length and their degree of saturation.
Chemically, fats and oils consist of glycerol esterified with three fatty acids to form a triglyceride. There are more than 
50 different fatty acids and vary structurally in terms of chain length (2 to 24 carbon atoms) and the number of double 
bonds between the carbon atoms. Where there are more than one or more double bonds, they are termed mono or 
polyunsaturated fatty acids, respectively (see Tables 2.1 and 2.2).
The melting point of a fat increases with fatty acid chain length (Table 2.3). Suet, which is composed of stearic acid, has 
a higher melting point than butter, which contains butyric acid. The presence of double bonds lowers the melting point. 
Olive oil contains unsaturated oleic acid and melts at a lower temperature than stearic acid. Oleic acid can be converted 
by the addition of hydrogen into saturated stearic acid giving a harder fat.

Constituents of Food
A high percentage of unsaturated fatty acids in triglycerides results in a more liquid consistency at room temperature 
while a high percentage of saturated fatty acids gives a more solid consistency (Table 2.4). In vegetable oils, the double 
bond present in the saturated fatty acids are called cis double bonds and can be transformed into the trans isomer as in 
the preparation of margarine. Trans fatty acids are said to increase the serum cholesterol and thus contribute to the causes 
of heart disease. The consumption of unsaturated fatty acids with cis double bonds, and in particular cis-cis linoleic acid, 
is therefore recommended in preference to animal fats in which trans fatty acids occur.
In addition to triglycerides, natural fats and oils contain other components. These include waxes, phospholipids and 
hydrolysis products (di- and mono-glycerides and fatty acids) as well as other non-related chemicals such as sterols, 
pigments such as carotenes and chlorophyll, and vitamins such as A, D, E and K.
With the exception of frying, there is a structural change to fats and oils during processing. With intense heating, fats 
are oils increase in viscosity with a darkening colour and the formation of polymeric compounds. With repeated heating, 
olive oil and other oils may undergo a reaction that leads to oxidative rancidity, associated with bitter “off” flavours and 
acrid odours, found in vegetable oils. Oxidative rancidity is affected by the presence of metals such as copper or iron, blue 
or ultra-violet light, moisture, salt and haematein compounds found in meat. 
When fat is heated to a very high temperature as in frying, it begins to smoke. This smoke consists of gaseous products 
resulting from the breakdown of fats into glycerol and free fatty acids. Glycerol itself may break down to give a sharp 
smelling, irritant compound called propenal (or acrolein) which gives an unpleasant flavour to the cooked food. It is 
therefore desirable to use fats or oils with a high smoke point for frying. Even so, prolonged and repeated use results in 
rancidity and an increase in fat viscosity, as rancid products may combine with fats to increase the chain length of the 
fatty acids.
The term margarine applied to certain types of shortenings as well as spreads and is manufactured from vegetable oils that 
have been hydrogenated or crystallised to form the required spreading texture. The vegetable oils may also be blended 
with lesser quantities of animal fats. Like butter, there is a legal requirement for margarine to contain no less than 80% 
fat. Since oils are virtually all fat, water is added usually in the form of milk or cream to produce the desired water-in-oil 
emulsion. Emulsifiers are also added along with salt, butter flavour and a permissible level of preservatives such as sodium 
benzoate. Vitamins A and D may also be added.
In the manufacture of margarine, separate preparations are made of water and fat-soluble ingredients. The two mixtures 
are then emulsified with vigorous agitation to form a continuous phase and then chilled before passing into a crystalliser 
to solidify further and plasticise the fat. The semi-solid margarine is finally continuously extruded and packaged.

Proteins
As well as providing nutritionally essential amino acids, proteins contribute to the acceptability of foods. Many of the 
properties if proteins are also utilised in many cooking processes. When meringue is made, for example, the egg white 
protein complex albumen is beaten allowing air to be incorporated. As the albumen foam is gently heated in an oven, the 
transparent liquid protein denatures, turns white and solidifies, thus ensuring that the structure of the meringue is held firm.
Meat is a major dietary source of protein, which consists of muscle cells held in a matrix of connective tissue, composed 
of the protein collagen. This is usually dispersed throughout the muscle, but forms major concentrations as gristle near 
skeletal joints. When meat is cooked the collagen of the connective tissue is hydrolysed to gelatine. Gelatin, in common 
with other proteins, has the ability to imbibe water and swell. It dissolves in warm water to form a colloidal solution, but 
gels when cooled, as occurs when jellies are made, or when the juice from roast meat is allowed to cool and set. Muscle 
proteins also have the ability to hold water in a bound form; this is termed the water binding capacity of the protein. 
When meat is cooked this capacity is reduced, so that the muscle proteins lose water and shrink. As this occurs, so the 
muscle fibres themselves become tougher, although the connective matrix softens as a result of gelatinisation.
Plant and animal proteins are composed of amino acids, which can be combined in a variety of ways to form muscle, tendons, 
skin, fingernails, feathers, silk, haemoglobin, enzymes, antibodies and hormones. Proteins are therefore polyamides and 
the order in which amino acids are sequentially joined together in a protein molecule is called the primary structure. 
Unsurprisingly, the word protein is derived from the Greek proteios, which literally means primary.

The shape into which a protein molecule folds its backbone is called the secondary structure. Further folding of the 
backbone upon itself by molecular forces to form a spherical structure is called the tertiary structure. The secondary and 
tertiary structures are collectively referred to as the higher structure of the protein. The functional properties of a protein 
are due specifically to the higher structure.
The precise shape or conformation of a protein molecule is due to weak non-covalent intermolecular forces across the 
higher structure. These include hydrogen bonding between side chains, disulphide cross-links, and salt bridges (ionic 
bonds such as RCO2
- +H3NR between side chains). The most stable higher structure is the one that has greatest number 
of stabilising interactions. 
The orderly and distinguishable secondary structure consists of α helical structures and β (or pleated) sheets. Helical 
structures involve hydrogen bonds between one amide-carbonyl group and an NH group while the sheet arrangement 
consists of single protein molecules are lined up side by side and held together by hydrogen bonds between the chains.
Milk and egg white are soluble globular proteins. Their solubility is due to their tertiary structure. Polar hydrophilic side 
chains are positioned on the outside of their spherical structure increasing water solubility while non-polar hydrophobic 
side chains are arranged on the inside surface where they may be used to catalyse non-aqueous reactions. The unique 
surface of globular proteins enables them to recognise certain complementary organic molecules. This recognition allows 
enzymes to catalyse certain reactions but not others.
Protein denaturation is the loss of the higher structural features caused by dis­ruption of hydrogen bonding and the non-
covalent forces that hold it together. The result is the loss or change in many of the functional properties of the protein. 
Pressure, temperature, pH, detergents, radiation, oxidising or reducing agents can also cause denaturation. Boiling an egg 
is an example of an irreversible denaturation in which the colourless albumins unfold and precipitate resulting in a white 
solid. Likewise, when milk sours, the change in pH arising from lactic acid formation causes curdling or precipitation of 
soluble proteins.
Some proteins are quite resistant to denaturation, while others are more susceptible. Denaturation may be reversible if a 
protein has been subjected to only mild de­naturing conditions. Under certain conditions a protein may resume its natural 
higher structure in a process called renaturation. Renaturation, however, may be very slow or may not actually occur at all.

Vitamins and Minerals
Vitamins and minerals are substances normally present in many different foodstuffs in very small amounts and are essential 
in the diet to maintain normal growth and development of the human body. The vitamin and mineral requirement of the 
human body is usually adequately met by a balanced diet. A lack of vitamins and minerals cause a number of different 
unpleasant deficiency symptoms to occur which disappear again as soon as the vitamin or mineral is supplied in sufficient 
quantity. Deficiency symptoms can also be caused by stress and disease. People nowadays are increasingly taking vitamin 
and mineral supplements in pill form with the notion that by taking them it will prevent these symptoms from occurring 
and strengthen their immune systems as well as cure cancer and prevent rheumatism. Little, however, is known about 
exactly how vitamin pills affect the body. New functions of vitamins in the body are still being discovered.

Minerals are the constituents left in biological materials after incineration. They are classified into being either abundant 
or trace quantities as shown in Table 2.5.
Table 2.5 Abundant and Trace Minerals in the Human Body 
Within the body, vitamins behave as biological catalysts starting chemical reactions without themselves becoming involved. 
Some vitamins, however, are only a part of a catalyst. Vitamin K, for example, is important for the blood’s ability to clot, 
or coagulate. New-born babies, whose intestinal bacteria are not yet fully developed, are sometimes given an injection of 
vitamin K shortly after birth to enable their blood to coagulate normally.

Constituents of Food
Perhaps surprisingly, most vitamins were only first discovered a hundred years ago. It was the Polish biochemist Casimir 
Funk in 1911 who claimed that food generally contained vital substances which provided the necessary protection against 
the diseases beriberi, pellagra, rickets and scurvy. These he called vitamins: a word he derived from vita meaning life and 
amine based on the fact that they contain nitrogen.
Since the isolation of vitamin A, from butter and eggs in 1913, all 13 vitamins have been extracted from foods and can 
now be synthesised in the laboratory. Of these, four are fat soluble (A, D, E and K) with the rest being water soluble (C 
and the B vitamins). All with the exception of B12 can be synthesised with a total annual world production of vitamins 
in the order of 123,000 tonnes in an industry worth in excess of $ 5.0 billion with Hoffman-La Roche and BASF being 
the world’s major producers.
A recommended daily allowance (RDA) serves as a useful guide for evaluating the adequacy of a person’s nutritional intake. 
The RDA values vary from one country to another but do allow consumers to estimate whether their daily intake meets 
recommended levels. The amount of a vitamin in a food product is expressed on the food label as a percent of the RDA.
Even though severe vitamin deficiency can lead to classical deficiency diseases such as scurvy, deficiency symptoms do 
not always present themselves immediately. Marginal vitamin C deficiency may weaken the body’s immune system long 
before the signs of scurvy appear. Symptoms of marginal vitamin B deficiency may include a loss of appetite and irritability.
It is sometimes wrongly assumed that exceeding the RDA solves the problems of deficiency. Generally, the intake of 
vitamins is safe beyond the RDA. Fat-soluble vitamins require fat to be absorbed in the intestine and is the reason why 
they should be taken at meal times. Excessive amounts of fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body’s fatty tissues so it 
is important not to overdose on this form of vitamin. Harmful side effects or poisoning can result by taking too high a 
dosage over a long period. Ten times the RDA for vitamin A, for example, is considered safe but above that it can cause 
damage to the liver, spleen, cause weakness and fatigue as well as cause poor vision and weight loss.
Water-soluble vitamins do not present the same risk since any excess is excreted in the urine. On the other hand, vitamin 
deficiencies occur more easily within this group.
2.6.1	
Fat Soluble Vitamins
Vitamin A: Found in liver and milk, vitamin A is necessary for maintaining the mucous membranes of the respiratory and 
digestive systems, and the cells of the skin in a healthy condition. Vitamin A is also involved in the visual cycle chromo 
proteins in the blue, green and red cone cells and the rods in the retina. The chromo proteins are formed in the dark. In 
the light they break down releasing energy, which cause impulses in the sight nerves. A lack of vitamin A impairs vision 
making it harder to see in the dark. The magical effects of liver have been known for millennia. The ancient Egyptians 
ate liver to be able to see better in poor light while the Greek physician Hippocrates (460-377 BC) was reputed to have 
cured night blindness with ox liver. Fritz Lipmann (Germany) was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1953 for the 
discovery of the coenzyme A.

Retinol acid, a form of vitamin A, is effective in the treatment of acne since it opens the pores of the skin. Cream 
preparations, which contain retinol acid, however, also increase the skin’s sensitivity to ultraviolet light causing the skin 
to become easily irritated on exposure to the sun.
Beta-carotene is a preliminary stage of vitamin A or pro-vitamin and occurs as the orange colouring in certain vegetables, 
and in particular, carrots. It was originally thought that the vitamin might be effective against lung cancer. 
Vitamin D: The main function of vitamin D is to help the body to absorb phosphorus and deposit calcium in the bones 
so that they become hard and strong. A lack of the vitamin may therefore be the reason for a higher occurrence of broken 
hips in the elderly. Children and young people require additional calcium to build up their bones, otherwise there is a 
risk that they could develop rickets. The symptoms of rickets are a hollow chest, curved back, bow legs and loose teeth. 
Vitamin D is considered the most poisonous of all vitamins. Excessive doses can cause nausea, thirst, loss of weight and 
a risk of kidney failure.
Vitamin D is found in oily fish, cod-liver oil and fish oil, and is also created in the skin when it is exposed to the sun. People 
who live in countries with little sunshine do not always produce sufficient amounts of vitamin D to cover their needs.
Vitamin E: An important antioxidant in that it neutralises free radicals within the body. Solar radiation, air pollution and 
the degradation of proteins are the cause of free radicals and reactive oxygen compounds are constantly being formed within 
the body. Unless controlled, free radicals can destroy cell membrane as well as alter genetic material (DNA) increasing 
the risk of cancer. Like other antioxidants vitamin E can prevent this damage from occurring.
Vitamin E is responsible for regulating the balance of certain hormones in the body. The male sex hormone testosterone 
depends on vitamin E to produce sperm in the testicles while the female hormones oestrogen and progesterone need 
both vitamin E and B to be biologically active. Vitamin E is therefore important for normal pregnancy and may lead to 
sterility in men if deficient. Found widely in wheat, cereal, peas and lettuce it is an approved food additive.
Vitamin K: A derivative of 2-methyl 1,4 napthequinone and is essential in blood-clotting mechanisms, vitamin K is 
found in green vegetables such as kale, spinach, cauliflower and nettles. Deficiency causes reduced activity of prothrombin 
resulting in haemorrhage. Henrik Dam (Denmark) and Edward Doisy (USA) were awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine 
in 1943 for the discovery of vitamin K.
2.6.2	
Water Soluble Vitamins
Vitamin B: Perhaps the first case of using vitamin B in treatment was in 1867 when a young Dutch doctor, Christian 
Eijkmann, travelled to Java to identify the cause of a mysterious illness. The illness was particularly prevalent amongst 
soldiers, mine-workers and prisoners which failed to respond to any kind of medical treatment. The symptoms of the 
illness were fatigue, paralysis and respiratory difficulties resulting in death. Dr Eijkmann called the disease beriberi which, 
in Singhalese, means tired-tired.

Dr Eijkmann noticed that chickens when fed on the leftover polished rice of those suffering from the disease began to 
show the same symptoms. He was quick to draw the connection between the chicken feed and the disease and was able 
to then prepare an extract from the husks of the rice, which he successfully used as a medicine. Christian Eijkmann was 
awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1929 for the discovery of the antineuritic vitamin.
Vitamin B consists of a group of related substances. For practical reasons the individual B3 vitamins were numbered B1, 
B2, B3, B6 and B12. The gaps in the numbering are due to other substances that scientists once (wrongly) thought were B 
vitamins. Three other B vitamins have a name instead of a number: pantothenic acid, biotin and folic acid.
The B vitamins each function differently. Some affect the metabolism of the cells in the body and the production of energy, 
while others are responsible for the formation of red blood corpuscles and DNA. The classical deficiency disease of vitamin 
B3 (niacin) is pellagra, which affects the skin, digestion and nervous system. Pellagra in Latin literally means coarse skin. 
In extreme cases deficiency causes dementia and emaciation to occur and, if untreated, can be fatal.
Once a worldwide problem, pellagra was thought to have been caused either by a fungus or by bacteria. The connection 
between the illness and vitamin B3 deficiency was established in 1930. Pellagra is still common in certain parts of the 
world today, particularly in areas where maize or millet is the staple diet.
Vitamin B1 (Thiamin): Essential for the well-being of the nervous system and the digestion of carbohydrates in food. 
Thiamin is the coenzyme, which helps to break up carbohydrates. Severe deficiency leads to beriberi, a loss of muscle 
function as well as neurological and cardiac problems. It is found in yeast, the germ of cereals and potatoes.

Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): Promotes growth and healthy skin and eyes. It forms complex molecules which act as hydrogen 
carriers in oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions and is part of the two co-enzymes which are responsible for catalysing 
a series of chemical reactions necessary for energy formation in the mitochondria. The vitamin is widely distributed in 
foods such as liver, eggs, cheese and green vegetables. Deficiency symptoms are therefore rare although a symptom is 
cracking of the skin.
Vitamin B3 (Niacin): Responsible for maintain the healthy skin and the intestinal tract vitamin B3 is found as the co-
enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) or its phosphorylated form NADP+ which are important to the cells’ 
energy production. Deficiency leads to pellagra. Symptoms include dermatitis, diarrhoea and mental disturbance. Occurs 
in food as nicotinic acid and found in yeast, meat, liver and cereals.
Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine): B6 is vital for the normal breakdown of proteins in food as well as maintaining healthy skin 
and nervous system. Deficiency leads to epilepsy, dermatitis and anaemia.
Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin): Like folic acid, B12 is important for the formation of the genetic material DNA. It is the 
only vitamin not to be synthesised but is instead derived from animal sources with an annual world production of around 
14 tonnes of which 55% is used for animal nutrition. There are deficiency problems for people on vegan diets (no meat 
or fish or products of animals such as milk or eggs). A symptom of deficiency is pernicious anaemia.
Pantothenic acid: Essential for metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, and the formation of certain hormones. 
Deficiency includes nervous and intestinal disorders. Widely distributed in foodstuffs.
Biotin: Produced by intestinal bacteria and important in fatty acid biosynthesis and gluconeogenesis. It is essential to 
many chemical systems in the body. Deficiency rarely occurs although symptoms include dermatitis and loss of hair. This 
is sometimes referred to as B8 or vitamin H.
Folic acid: Important for synthesis of the component comprising the genetic material DNA. It is recommended that 
expectant mothers supplement their diets in the early stages of pregnancy. It is also vital for the correct functioning of 
the blood-forming organs. Deficiency symptoms are intestinal disorders and anaemia.
Vitamin C: Scurvy is a vitamin-deficiency disease brought on by a lack of fresh vegetables and fruit and was once a 
widespread and fatal disease. For centuries, the dreaded disease plagued seafarers on long sea voyages. When the fifteenth 
century Portuguese mariner Vasco da Gama opened up a sea route to India by sailing around the Cape of Good Hope, 
100 of his crew of 160 died from the illness. The Portuguese-born explorer Ferdinand Magellan - born in 1480 and known 
as the greatest explorer of his age - was also no newcomer to the appalling disease. A member of one of his expeditions 
wrote in his chronicle, “We were three months and twenty days without getting any kind of fresh food. We ate biscuits 
which was no longer biscuit but powder of biscuits swarming with worms”, adding, “The gums of both the lower and 
upper teeth of some of our men swelled, so that they could not eat under any circumstances and therefore died.”

Over two centuries later, in 1747, the Scottish naval surgeon Dr James Lind performed an experiment on a group of 
sailors suffering from scurvy. Dr Lind showed that by taking a daily supplement of oranges and lemons the disease could 
be prevented from occurring. His claims were met with much scepticism and disbelief. British maritime explorer Captain 
James Cook, however, was quick to realise the value of a diet of fresh fruit and vegetables on long sea voyages and was 
almost militant in enforcing dietary rules to prevent scurvy amongst his crews. In spite of Captain Cook’s success in his 
battle against the disease, it took a further fifty years for the British Admiralty to prescribe a daily ration of lemon juice 
for all sailors in the Navy. By the beginning of the 19th century scurvy was no longer a threat to the British fleet.
Even though citrus fruits were known to have prevented scurvy, it was not until the Hungarian Nobel Prize winner for 
Medicine Albert Szent-Györgyi (1937) successfully isolated the vitamin. He named it ascorbic acid as an abbreviation of 
anti-scorbutus, which is Latin for against scurvy.
Ascorbic acid has many important roles in the body and is particularly concerned with the growth and repair of body 
cells and tissue helping to fight infection, and with the absorption of iron from food. Iron is required in the manufacture 
of haemoglobin; the red pigment in the blood which transports the vital oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. 
The vitamin is also important for the formation of the protein collagen, which strengthens the cells that build up bones.
A severe deficiency leads to scurvy which causes bleeding in the skin and joints, around the bones and from gums and 
can lead to death. Potatoes, green vegetables and citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons are the commonest sources and 
blackcurrant and rosehip extracts are particularly rich.
Dietary studies have shown that by eating large quantities of fresh fruit and vegetables that are rich in vitamin C the risk 
of contracting certain diseases reduces. There are also claims that high doses of vitamin C can help fight cancer cells. 
There are no studies, however, that unequivocally support this claim.
Taking large quantities of vitamin C in tablet form over a long period of time can cause a risk of kidney stones; the excess 
vitamin is turned into oxalate which, when combined with calcium, is transformed into kidney stones. 
2.6.3	
Vitamin Loss
Vitamins in fruit and vegetables may be destroyed or lost in several ways between harvesting and consumption. The 
water-soluble vitamins of the B-complex and vitamin C tend to be more unstable during cooking and processing than 
the fat-soluble vitamins (Table 2.6). In addition, both water-soluble vitamins and minerals may be lost by diffusion from 
the food into the cooking medium. In some cases these nutrients may still be consumed, as the cooking water may be 
used for making sauces or gravy. Similarly, the liquid syrup from canned fruit is normally consumed, but in many cases 
the cooking water is discarded.

The fat-soluble vitamins are more stable than the water-soluble vitamins under normal conditions. Vitamin D is completely 
stable; both vitamin A and carotene, from which it can be derived, are stable below 100oC. However, both forms suffer 
losses during frying, exposure to sunlight, dehydration and during the storage of dehydrated food.
The tocopherols (vitamin E) are natural antioxidants, but in protecting fats and vitamin from oxidation during storage, 
cooking and processing are themselves oxidised. The most unstable fat-soluble vitamin is vitamin K, which is destroyed 
in the presence of acids, alkalis, oxidising agents or sunlight and by prolonged heating.
The exact amount of vitamins lost during boiling of vegetables depends on the type of vegetables being boiled (Tables 
2.7, 2.8 and 2.9).

Flavours and Aromas
The term “flavour” is used to describe the quality of food but it is neither very well defined nor properly understood. In 
fact, flavour describes the complex and interacting set of sensations experienced when food is consumed. Flavour is a 
distinctive taste and savour and may be defined as “that quality of something which affects the sense of taste or gratifies 
the palate: savour is the blend of taste according to smell sensations evoked in a substance in the mouth.”
Flavour is a subtle combination of the four distinguishable elements of sweetness, sourness, bitterness and saltiness. In 
recent years, a fifth distinguishable flavour has become accepted. It is best known in the form of monosodium glutamate 
(MSG). The Japanese named this new taste umami, which means roughly “savoury” in English.

Natural products contain many aroma chemicals. Tarragon essential oil, for example, contains up to 77 components and 
coffee over 800. Others, on the other hand, contain fewer major components. Vanilla, for example, contains the major 
ingredient vanillin, which was first synthesized in 1874. Whilst some synthetic flavourings are prepared by using such 
major components as the key ingredient, the majority are complex mixtures of the many important aroma chemicals 
found in nature.
Many flavours are the result of specific chemical processes such as fermentation (cheese, yogurt, alcoholic drinks) or 
roasting and frying (meat, chocolate, toast, deep-fat-fried food). Fermentation, roasting and toasting create specific 
chemical reactions in foods. The sweet caramelly taste of fried onions, gravy, or the crackling on pork involves a chemical 
reaction between proteins and carbohydrates in a non-enzymatic brown reaction first discovered by the French chemist, 
L.C. Maillard, in 1912. 
Variations on the browning reaction produce many of the most desirable flavours. Examples include allylpyrazine which 
gives a roasted nut-like flavour; methoxypyrazines earthy vegetables; 2-isobutyl-3 methoxypyrazine gives green pepper, 
and acetyl-l-pyrazines popcorn; 2-acetoxy pyrazine produces toasted flavours. During World War II two scientists, H.M. 
Barnes and C.W. Kaufman, discovered that the reactions between sugars and proteins could produce not only the off-
flavours but also desirable flavours. In 1947 a maple syrup flavour was patented as the first Maillard reaction flavour.
Flavours are additives that create or improve flavours and many, depending on the strength of the flavour desired, range 
from 0.01% to 2%. The usage in foods can correspondingly range from a few kilogrammes per year to several thousand 
tonnes. These may be either natural (ie obtained from plant or animal sources), natural identical (ie chemically synthesised 
but chemically identical) or artificial (ie not produced in plants or animals).
Alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters and lactones are classes of compounds that occur most frequently in nature and 
artificial flavours. The majority of flavours have molecular masses of around 200 and are rarely above 300.

Ethyl ethanoate, b.p. 88oC, has the characteristic aroma of brandy and can be made by condensing together ethanol, 
b.p.78.5oC, and ethanoic acid, b.p. 118oC. The reaction is reversible. Write a balanced equation for the formation of ethyl 
ethanoate from ethanol and ethanoic acid. Suggest a way in which the rate of reaction can be increased and why distillation 
is not a suitable process for purifying the ester.
Solution:
The reaction can be promoted by the addition of a suitable acid. Distillation is not suitable since ethanol has the lowest 
boiling point and therefore drives the reaction in favour of the reactants and not the products.

Additives and Antioxidants
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is the keystone of European Union (EU) risk assessment regarding food 
safety working in close collaboration with national authorities has produced a list of permissible food additives. The so-
called E-numbers are a systematic way of identifying different food additives. The E-number is only given to an additive 
that has passed all the necessary food safety checks.
Many food additives are anti-oxidants and used to preserve or enhance certain foods. All foodstuffs are vulnerable to 
oxidation. The most familiar examples are the browning of cut apples or potatoes when exposed to air. The use of lemon 
juice demonstrates the principle of anti-oxidation since lemon juice contains vitamin C (E300), which is one of the most 
potent antioxidants. 
Atmospheric oxygen is not the only oxidizing agent. It is combined in the form of oxides and peroxides in atmospheric 
pollution, cigarette smoke and in some normal bodily processes. Oxidation can cause breaks in DNA (and hence the risk 
of cancers), oxidise polyunsaturated fatty acids, and thus contribute towards heart disease and strokes and can damage 
proteins. The proteins in the eye are particularly vulnerable because light also assists the oxidation process. Increasing 
the intake of antioxidants has a preventative effect against both cancer and heart disease. The oxidation of lipids is one 
factor in the development of heart disease.
Besides all their other advantages, antioxidants confer huge economic and environmental benefits in preventing wastage 
of food. 
Acids are a major component of natural foods. Zest is a highly desirable attribute in food, and sharpness of flavour is 
always due to acids. Phosphoric acid (E338) gives the sharpness in cola drinks. All fruits contain characteristic acids such 
as citric in lemons, malic in apples, tartaric in grapes. The acids that are added to food are all, except phosphoric acid, 
found in natural foodstuffs. Besides imparting sharpness of flavour, acids are used because the overall acidity of foods 
can be crucial.

Acids also have preservative and antioxidant properties. In jam-making the acidity of the fruit determines its setting 
properties The most commonly used acid is citric acid (E330). Originally derived from citrus fruits it is now produced 
by fermentation of molasses by an aspergillus mould. Besides adding tartness, it is also an antioxidant and a preservative. 
Phosphoric acid (E338) is the next most commonly used acid.

The main processes used to produce foods of satisfactory biological standards and acceptable eating quality, are mechanical 
processes, heating, cooling, the use of additives, and fermentation processes. Each of these has a range of effects on the 
organoleptic properties of food. Recent developments in food processing methods include aseptic processing, irradiation 
(non-thermal), pulsed electric fields (non-thermal) and high pressure processing (non-thermal). 
3.2	
Mechanical Processes
Many raw food materials undergo a preliminary treatment by a mechanical process. Many first involve size reduction 
such as cutting into smaller pieces such as potatoes into small chips before frying. Size reduction processes can, however, 
involve injury to living cells and may therefore affect the appearance of the foodstuff in undesirable ways.
In some fruit and vegetables, enzymatic browning may occur. The grey-black discolouration found in cut potatoes and 
the brown discolouration found in cut apples is due to the action of the enzyme polyphenoloxidase (PPO) on phenolic 
compounds or tannins. These substances are normally colourless in intact living plant tissue. When cells are damaged by 
bruising or cutting during the preparation of food, the phenolic compounds are oxidised forming brown or black grey 
polymers. PPO is present in apricots, cherries, pears, bananas, avocados and sweet potatoes.
A similar enzyme reaction can occur between the vitamin C in fruits and the enzyme ascorbic acid oxidase. Such enzymatic 
reactions can be prevented or reduced several ways:
• 
Chilling reduces enzymatic reaction rates
• 
Lowering pH to below 2.5 inhibits enzyme activity
• 
Additives inhibit enzyme activity such as the use sodium metabisulphate, salt, sugar, potassium phosphate 
and ascorbic acid
• 
Heat inactivates enzyme activity such as the use of blanching
• 
Complete exclusion of air (oxygen) prevents oxidative reactions
Other mechanical treatments of foods include filtration and centrifugation, which are used to separate fluids from solids, 
or from liquids of different density. In a cream separator, less dense fat globules are separated from the water and dissolved 
lactose and proteins of milk.
The final form of mechanical treatment is protective packaging. This is a physical barrier such as a can, jar or plastic sachet, 
for protection against spoilage, organisms, dirt, and mechanical damage. Packaging technologies are classified into either 
modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) or controlled atmosphere packaging (CAP).

Raw Material Preparation
The objective of raw material preparation is the removal and separation of contaminating materials from the food in order 
to attain a suitable condition for further processing. Contaminants may be soil, micro-organisms and pesticide residues. 
Washing is widely applied as a first processing step to root crops, potatoes, fruits and vegetables. Soaking is predominantly 
applied to the processing of legume seeds.
Large volumes of water are often required for washing root vegetables, which carry a lot of soil, and also for leafy vegetables, 
which have a large surface area. Mechanical or air flotation techniques are used to assist soil removal and reduce the 
quantity of water used. Water re-circulation or re-use from other food process operations is commonly used. Waste water 
from pre-washing mainly contains field debris and soil particles with small fragments of the fruit or vegetable. Detergents 
can increase cleaning efficiency but also contribute to the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the waste water.
Washing is carried out by vigorous spraying with water, which may be chlorinated, and by immersion, with the aid of 
brushes or by shaking and stirring. Surface active agents and warm water are sometimes used. The use of warm water, 
however, can increase both the chemical and microbiological spoilage, unless careful control on the washing process is 
carried out. Once loosened, soil can be separated and recovered by sedimentation.
The soaking of legume seeds in water varies with variety and species and with the duration and conditions of storage. 
Dry beans can be soaked in cold water for between 8 and 16 hours while high temperature soaking increases the rate of 
hydration.
Dry cleaning procedures are used for products which have a low moisture content and high mechanical strength such as 
nuts and grains. Typical equipment used includes air classifiers, magnetic separators, sieving and screening.
Most raw materials for processing may contain contaminants; have inedible components or irregular physical characteristics. 
Processing techniques such as sorting, grading, screening, de-hulling and trimming are therefore necessary to reach 
uniformity prior to further processing.
Sorting and screening are used to separate raw materials into categories on the basis of shape, size, weight and colour. 
In size-sorting, solids are separated into two or more fractions by sieving and screening. Size-sorting is important where 
over or under-sized material may lead to over of under cooking or cooling. Various types of screens and sieves, with fixed 
or variable apertures, are used while screens may be stationary, rotary or vibrating.
Shape-sorting is carried out either manually or mechanically such as with belt-and-roller sorters. Weight-sorting is used 
for more valuable foods such as cut meats, eggs, exotic fruits and vegetables. Image-processing is used to sort foods on 
the basis of length, diameter, number of surface defects and orientation of food on a conveyor. The images of the surface 
are digitally recorded by a digital camera or sensor and the data compared with pre-programmed specifications. Colour-
sorting uses photo detectors to record reflected colour and compared with pre-set standards. Products are then either 
rejected by blasting away the compressed air or can be moved into a group with similar characteristics.

Grading is the assessment of a number of characteristics of a food to obtain an indication of the overall quality of a 
particular food. It is mainly carried out by trained operators. Fish and meats are all examined by inspectors for disease, 
fat distribution, size and shape. Other graded foods include cheese and tea. Grading is more expensive than sorting due 
to the high costs of skilled personnel. Trained operators have the benefit of being able to assess many characteristics 
simultaneously. 
Trimming involves the removal of inedible parts or parts with defects and cutting to a size appropriate for further processing. 
It usually is carried out manually or by rotating knives.
Many vegetables and some fruits require peeling. Peeling can be achieved by mechanical cutting or abrasion, or by the 
application of steam, hot water or heated air. The use of caustic in peeling involves a dilute solution of sodium hydroxide 
and is used to soften the cortex so that the peel can be more easily removed by mechanical scrubbers or high pressure 
water sprays. This also removes any residual caustic and may lead to pH fluctuations in the waste water. Certain fruit such 
as tomatoes requires strong caustic solutions and the addition of wetting agents. 
Flash steam peeling is carried out as a batch process. Roots and tubers are treated in a pressure vessel and exposed to 
steam at a pressure of up to 20 bar. The high temperature causes a rapid heating and cooking of the surface layer within 
15 to 30 seconds. The pressure is then instantly released which causes flashing-off of the cooked skin. Remaining traces 
are sprayed off with water.
In knife peeling, fruits and vegetables to be peeled are pressed against stationary or rotating blades to remove the skin. 
Knife peeling is used for citrus fruits where the skin is easily removed causing little damage.

In abrasion peeling, the material is fed onto carborundum rollers or fed into a rotating bowl, which is lined with 
carborundum. The abrasive carborundum surface removes the skin, which is then washed away with water. Normally 
carried out normally at ambient temperature, this has a significantly higher product loss than flash steam peeling. 
Developed for onions, a flame peeler consists of a conveyer belt which transports and rotates the onion through a furnace 
heated to temperatures in excess of 1000oC. The skin, which consists of a paper shell and root hairs, is rapidly burnt off. 
The skin is removed by high-pressure water sprays.
Grinding and milling are used for size reduction of solid dry material and used extensively in the flour milling, brewery, 
sugar and dairy industries. Various techniques and equipment are used for specific types of food for both dry and wet 
applications. In wet processes, smaller particle sizes can be attained while dry processes combined with sieving or air 
classification permits the collection of a particle size range. The common types of mill used in food industry include:
Hammer mills: The mill consists of a horizontal cylindrical chamber lined with a steel breaker plate. Hammers along its 
length disintegrate the material by impact force. 
Ball mills: The mill consists of a slowly rotating, horizontal steel cylinder, half filled with steel balls between 2.5 and 15 
cm in diameter. The particle size attained depends on the speed and size of the balls.
The purpose of cutting, slicing, chopping and pulping is to reduce the size of fibrous material usually to improve the 
eating quality or produce foods for further processing. These activities are applied in processing of meat, fish, cheese, 
vegetables, fruits, potatoes, and various other crops. Slicing equipment consists of rotating or reciprocating blades. The 
material may be pressed against the blades by centrifugal force. For slicing meat products, the material is held firm while 
it travels across the blade. Harder fruits such as apples are simultaneously sliced and decored.
Dicing is applied to vegetables, fruits and meats in which the material is first sliced and then cut into strips by rotating 
blades. These are then fed to a second set of rotating knives, which operate perpendicular to the first set and reduce the 
strips into cubes.
Many products such as meat, fish and vegetables require reducing to small particles. Mincing is mainly used for size 
reduction and homogenisation. In bowl chopping, material is placed in a slowly rotating bowl and subjected it to a set 
of blades rotating at high speed. This technique is widely used in the production of sausages in which the degree of 
comminution can be varied depending on knife-speed and cutting time. In extreme cases the material will be reduced 
to an emulsion.

Forming, Moulding and Extrusion
Forming, moulding and extruding are widely applied for the production of bread, biscuits, cheese, confectionery and pies. 
In forming and moulding, the material is prepared as a soft mixture which firms on processing such a baking.

Extrusion is widely used for the production of meat sausages, pasta products such as spaghetti and starch-based snack 
food. As a continuous process of shaping, the material is kneaded under high pressure and pressed continuously through 
openings of the required shape using the action of rotating screws. In cooking extruders, the material is also heat treated 
or cooked to solublise the starches. 
3.3	
Heating
As well as destroying pathogens and other spoilage organisms, heating is used to improve food palatability. Heating also 
provides a rapid means of removing moisture and as well as producing a number of physical and chemical changes.
3.3.1	
Steam and Water Heating
Blanching is an important step in processing of fruits and green vegetables and involves their exposure to high temperatures 
for a short period of time. The primary function of blanching is to inactivate or retard surface bacterial and enzyme action, 
which causes rapid degeneration of quality. Blanching is also able to expel air and other gases from products. 
Blanching may be carried out either by immersion in hot water (80oC to 100oC) or exposure to live steam depending on 
the fruit or vegetable to be blanched. The residence time in the blancher can vary from approximately one second to five 
minutes depending on the fruit or vegetable being blanched.
3.3.2	
Evaporation
Evaporation is the partial removal of water from liquid food by boiling. Evaporation is used to pre-concentrate, increase 
the solid content and to change the colour of food. It is used to process milk, starch, coffee, fruit juices, vegetable pastes 
and concentrates, seasonings, sauces as well as sugar processing.
Steam or vapour is usually used as the heating medium, the latent heat of condensation is used to raise the temperature to 
the boiling point of the liquid food causing evaporation of the water. Since many liquid food products are heat sensitive 
it is often necessary to work at reduced temperatures. This is achieved by boiling under part vacuum. Evaporation occurs 
normally between 50oC to 100oC.
The most commonly used equipment consist shell and tube evaporators which are either climbing or falling film types. 
Wiped film evaporators and thin film evaporators are used for the evaporation of highly viscous products.
For large-scale evaporation requiring significant energy such as the processing of sugar beet or evaporation of milk and 
whey, multiple-effect evaporators are used. These use fresh steam to boil off water vapour from the liquid in the first effect. 
The evaporated water retains sufficient energy to be used as the heat source for the next effect, and so on. A vacuum is 
applied in a ple effect chain in order for the water to boil off. The liquid food is passed from one evaporator effect through 
the others so that it is subject to multiple stages of evaporation.

Pasteurisation, Sterilisation and UHT
The treatment of foods by heat is principally used in their preservation. It prevents bacterial and enzyme activity otherwise 
resulting in the loss of product quality. Various temperature-time combinations can be applied with each depending on 
product properties and shelf life requirements. For complete sterilisation, the product is canned or bottled and then heat-
treated in a retort in hot water or steam in either a batch or continuous operation. 
In pasteurisation, a heating temperature below 100oC is applied. This results in a partial reduction of the enzyme and 
bacterial activity within a product giving a limited shelf life. Sterilisation commonly means a heat treatment in excess of 
100oC to achieve a stable and extended shelf life. 
Ultra high temperature (UHT) processing uses a temperature exceeding 135oC for very short times. It is applied to low 
viscosity liquid products. This uses indirect heating in plate and frame or tubular heat exchangers. Direct steam injection 
or steam infusion can alternatively be used.
Batch wise pasteurisation is carried out in agitated vessels. For beer and fruit juices, pasteurisation is applied after bottling 
or canning. The packaged products are immersed in hot water or led through a steam tunnel. For continuous pasteurisation 
flow-through tubular or plate and frame heat exchangers with heating, holding and cooling sections are used.

Hot Air
Baking and roasting are forms of hot air heating involving both convective and radiative heat transfer. Baking is used 
to improve eating quality by way of taste and texture of a food. It is also a means of preservation by the destruction of 
micro-organisms and reduction of water activity at the surface of the food. The shelf life of most baked foods, however, 
is limited, unless they are refrigerated or packaged.
Operating either batch or continuously, baking is applied on a large scale to flour-based products such as bread and 
bakery products as well as to fruit and vegetables. Baked products include pies, pizza and snack foods. In the baking 
process, the moisture at the surface is evaporated and removed by circulating hot air. When the rate of moisture loss at 
the surface exceeds the rate of transport of moisture from the interior of the product to the surface, the surface dries out 
forming a crust.
The purpose of roasting is to dry and enhance the aroma as well as structure of the food product. Typical roasted 
products include coffee, cereals, nuts, cacao and fruits. In roasting, water contained within the product is evaporated 
and the moisture content may fall to below 1%. At temperatures exceeding 120oC chemical reactions may take place in 
the product. Maillard reactions (see 2.3) are particularly important in the formation of aromas in coffee and cacao. The 
duration of the roasting process is dependent on the product and the specific aromas that are required. The roasting of 
coffee may range from one to twenty minutes. The Maillard reactions are stopped either by cooling the product with air 
or by quenching with water followed by cooling with air.
As with baking, roasting ovens can operate either batch or continuously. Typical equipment for batch roasting ovens 
includes drum, column, rotating or fluidised bed roasters. In each, the product is heated and agitated simultaneously. The 
product can be in direct contact with the hot convective air or in contact with a heated conductive surface. In practice, 
it is usually a combination of both. 
In drying and dehydration processes, the shelf life of foods is extended by the reduction of water activity. Typical applications 
include milk, coffee, tea, flavours, powdered drinks and sugar. In hot air drying, the heat transferred from the air to the 
product causes water evaporation. The main types of hot air dryers include bin, tray, tunnel, conveyor or belt, fluidised 
bed, kiln, pneumatic, rotary and spray dryers.
In fluidised bed dryers, there is good thermal control over the drying conditions. They have very high rates of heat and 
mass transfer and consequently short drying times. Drying can take place below 100oC.
3.3.5	
Hot Oil
Frying involves cooking food in edible oil at temperatures in the region of 200oC. Vegetable oils are normally used. Raw 
material such as fish, meat and potatoes can be fried to produce products such as fish fingers, burgers and French fries.

Food Processing Operations
Frying may be either batch or continuous. In continuous frying, the chamber contains the heated oil. A belt feeds the 
product into the main fryer belt and controls the frying time. The take-out belt at the end of the fryer lifts the product 
out of the oil, allowing the product to drain and transfer onto product inspection and packing belts. The residence time 
in the fryer can range from 30 seconds to 6 minutes depending on the product.
3.3.6	
Heat Removal
Cooling and Chilling: The purpose of cooling and chilling is the reduction of the rate of biochemical and microbiological 
change, in order to extend the shelf life of fresh and processed foods. Cooling involves reducing the temperature of 
the food from the processing to the storage temperature. Chilling involves maintaining the temperature of a food at a 
temperature of between -1oC and 8oC.
The cooling of liquid foods is typically carried out by passing it through a heat exchanger which is cooled using water. 
In cryogenic cooling, the food is in direct contact with a refrigerant, which can be either solid, liquid carbon dioxide or 
liquid nitrogen. Refrigerant boiling, evaporation or sublimation removes the heat from the food causing rapid cooling.
Freezing: Freezing is a method of preservation where the temperature of a food is reduced below its freezing point and 
a proportion of the water undergoes a change in state to form ice crystals. Several types of food can be frozen including 
fruit, vegetables, fish, meat, baked products and ice cream. The equipment for freezing foods includes blast, belt, fluidised 
bed, cooled surface, immersion and cryogenic freezers.
In freeze-drying or lyophilisation, water is removed through sublimation and desorption. The aim is to preserve sensitive 
material that can not be dried by evaporation at elevated temperature because of the sensitivity to degradation of specific 
components at high temperature resulting is loss of taste or other quality aspects. The technique is typically used for 
drying coffee extract, spices, soup vegetables, instant meals, fish and meat. Typical lyophilisation equipment consists of a 
drying chamber with temperature controlled shelves. The chamber is cooled by refrigerant through the shelves and the 
chamber itself is under vacuum. A condenser is used to trap water removed from the product in the drying chamber and 
facilitate the drying process.
Example: 
There is a 50% destruction of a vitamin at 115oC in 15 minutes where, for the vitamin, E is 109 kJ.mol-1. Determine the 
extent of the vitamin destruction at 120oC after 15 minutes of processing.

The thermal destruction is dependent on temperature and can be given by the Arrhenius equation:
Assuming a first order model then the rate constant is
From the Arrhenius formula
The rate constant at 120oC is therefore
The fraction of vitamin remaining is therefore
That is, a 65% destruction of the vitamin. This result corresponds to a fixed temperature. In reality, there will be a period 
of heating which will correspond to an accumulative loss of the vitamin, which will slow again on cooling. The overall 
effect for a period of heating and cooling can be calculated using increments of time and accumulating the loss of vitamin.

Mixtures and Emulsions
Most foods are prepared and consumed as mixtures. Mixing is essential to encourage certain desirable reactions to occur 
between the constituents and various emulsions. This may involve the bringing together of dry, free-flowing solids through 
to complex viscous liquids, slurries, pastes and doughs. Agitation of these materials involves many complex interfaces 
and free surfaces. The flow properties of the components and those of the mixture at any point during mixing are both 
complex and time-dependent. 
Emulsification occurs when two liquids which are not soluble in one another are dispersed into fine droplets within each 
other. Water-in-oil emulsions, such as butter, consist of very fine droplets of water containing dissolved salts, lactose and 
lactic acid are dispersed throughout the butter fat or oil phase. Oil-in-water emulsions, such as mayonnaise consists of 
minute droplets of a vegetable oil are dispersed in an aqueous solution of vinegar. 
To prevent liquids in an emulsion from separating into two layers, an emulsifying agent is used. Egg yolk, which contains 
a lecithoprotein, is used as the emulsifying agent, and prevents the droplets of oil from coalescing. This is due to the 
structure of lecithoprotein which comprises two parts; a hydrophilic (water-loving) protein and hydrophobic (water-
repelling) protein, which is attracted to lipid materials such as vegetable oil. 
Mixing is one of the most commonly encountered operations in the food industry. As a blending process, it involves the 
combination of different materials and their spatial distribution until a certain degree of homogeneity is achieved. Various 
mixing operations can be distinguished.
Solid/solid mixing: Used for mixed feed, blends of tea and coffee, dried soup, cake mixes, custard, ice cream.
Solid/liquid mixing: Used for canned products, dough, dairy products
Liquid/gas mixing: Used for making ice cream, whipping cream.
A wide variety of food mixers are available with equally wide-ranging capabilities. Some are designed for specific 
applications such as emulsification or solid dispersion into liquids. Others tend to be required to carry out various duties. 
The design of most mixers is rarely based on theoretical considerations. Instead, design is often based on past experience. 
The dispersion of food ingredients by the agitator may require high levels of shear as in the case of making fine dispersions 
and emulsions while the mixing of nuts into yoghurt, on the other hand, may require low shear. Many foods contain 
particles of different sizes, some of which are fragile. These particles may have to be dispersed into viscous liquids such as 
a sauce. It is therefore difficult to produce a uniform product composition in which particle segregation is often a problem.
Regardless of the shape or size of the mixer, its design features must ensure hygienic and safe operation, as well as provide 
for in-place cleaning. Mixers used in the food processing industries may be conveniently classified according to the 
materials to be mixed as dissolving and dispersion of liquids, blending of particulate material and mixing of solids and 
liquids to form doughs, batters and pastes.

Emulsification
Emulsification of foods is one of the most complicated unit operations since the nature of the final product is dependent 
on the method of preparation. Even the method of addition of components and the rate of addition can significantly 
affect the emulsion quality. Oil-in-water emulsions are widely used and may be produced in impeller-agitated vessels 
operating at high rotational speeds, colloidal mills or high-pressure valve homogenisers. Continuous processing may be 
achieved by in-line mixers, which consists of a high-speed rotor inside a casing into which the components are pumped 
and subjected to high shear. Emulsions are formed under extremely high specific power.
3.4.2	
Mixer Performance
The performance of mixers in the food industry is typically expressed in terms of fluid velocity generated, total pumping 
capacity of the impeller, and total flow in the tank, or in terms of blending time or some readily evaluated solids-suspension 
criterion. If the application is relatively simple, a complete and detailed examination of the complicated fluid mechanics 
in a mixing tank is not usually necessary. If the process is complex then a full analysis of fluid shear rates and stresses, 
two-phase mass transfer, turbulence, and micro-scale shear rate and blending may be required.
It is sometimes possible to express a complex mixing process in terms of only one, or a few, simple velocity and pumping 
capacity relationships. Design in such a case is therefore straightforward and simple. Problems, however, can arise in 
distinguishing processes to which comparatively simple physical and visual concepts can be applied and those for which 
more elaborate qualitative and quantitative aspects are required to be considered.

Mixing of Powders, Pastes and Batters
The mixing of dry powders is normally carried out as a batch process in either vertical or horizontal mixers. Vertical 
mixers have a movable bowl in which the contents are mixed by mechanical agitation. Paddle agitators are commonly 
used and the shape of the impeller frequently conforms to the vessel walls. Planetary motion devices are commonly used 
in vertical mixers in which the agitator revolves in circle in addition to rotating on its own axis. This ensures that the 
entire mixer volume receives beating action and that there are no dead spaces. 
Horizontal mixers are widely used for doughs in which gluten development is desirable. The mixers have a jacketed 
U-shaped trough. Water flowing through the jacket enables heat removal. 
Example:
A largely aqueous-based liquid food is mixed in batch vessel. Assuming a Power number of 5 (for Re>5000) determine the 
power input through the impeller if an impeller has a diameter of 70 cm and speed of 30 rpm. The density and viscosity 
of the liquid food is 1000 kg.m-3 and 0.02 Pa.s, respectively.
Solution:
The Power number for an impeller is
The power for mixing is therefore
The power is 105 W. As a check, the Reynolds number is 
A Power number of 5 is therefore valid for Re greater than 5000.

Novel Food Processing
In addition to conventional food processing, there are considerable demands on the food processing industry to develop 
new creative products in innovative ways. Some of the foods and processes do not conform to existing techniques and 
methods. A novel food is defined as a food which has not had an appreciable level of consumption or a process which has 
not previously been used. Such foods are required to be authorised according to the Novel Food Regulations legislation 
(EC) No 258197 of the European Parliament.

High Pressure Food Processing
The novelty and purpose of using high pressure instead of heat - as in conventional cooking - is to preserve and even 
improve food quality in terms of taste, flavour, texture and colour. Consumers nowadays generally expect the food that 
they buy to be of a high quality, minimally processed, ‘natural’, additive-free and high in nutritional value. The unique 
effects of pressure appear to be able to meet these requirements. Significantly, the covalent bonds of food components 
including saccharides, vitamins, lipids and pigments are able to resist the effects of high pressures in contrast to the highly 
damaging effects of heat. Pressure is generally only able to affect the weaker bonds and forces sufficient to alter the delicate 
molecular structures - as in the case of proteins. 
High pressure food processing has been used in the destruction of micro-organisms, the activation and deactivation of 
enzymes, the change of functional properties such as foams, gels and emulsions, and the control of phase change such as 
fat solidification and ice melting point. The sterilisation properties of high pressure food processing have been compared 
to that of heat treatment. Like heat, micro-organisms differ significantly in their ability to withstand pressure. Bacteria, 
yeasts and moulds are readily killed by high pressure while bacterial spores and some viruses are particularly resistant; 
spores being only inactivated by pressure after germination. As an analogy to the heat treatment of pasteurisation, the 
pressure sterilisation is appropriately termed pascalisation.
Another difference between thermal and high pressure processing is that while heat is conducted through the exterior 
of foods to penetrate the interior, which takes time and often with over-cooking of the surface, pressure is applied 
instantaneously and uniformly. Also, unlike heat treated food, pressure processing is more dependent on the quality of 
the raw food material.
An interesting effect of high pressure is the depression of the freezing point of water. At 200 MPa, for example, the freezing 
point is reduced to -22oC. The problem with conventionally storing frozen food is that much of the textural quality is lost 
during the freezing or thawing often due to the damaging effects of ice crystals. A possible application of high pressure 
may be to cool food below its freezing point at high pressure and then by releasing the pressure instantly freeze the food. 
Tests have shown that the rapid and uniform freezing effect has been found to preserve better food texture on thawing.
The cost of pressure-processed food is currently higher than that of heat processed food even though pressure processing 
actually consumes less energy. The cost of reaching a pressure of 400 MPa is about the same as heating from only 20oC 
to 25oC. The reason for the high cost is because the equipment needed is very expensive and makes up about 80% of the 
total production costs. In spite of the high cost of the equipment, the sales of high pressure processes foods continue to 
rise despite retail prices being typically twice those of conventionally processed products. At the moment the improved 
quality to be gained by pressure processing has found a niche market among certain consumers who are willing to pay 
a premium. The future may well lead to pressure processed foods eventually being more commer­cially competitive and 
affordable to all.

Food Processing Operations
The processing of foods by high pressure offers the creation of many entirely new and exciting food textures. Pressurised 
beef muscle has a texture like raw ham but without a change in taste. Fish and pork muscle become more glossy, transparent, 
dense, smooth and soft. Fruit-based jams, jellies, purées and juices have exceptional ‘just squeezed’ flavour and striking 
natural colour. Protein from soya, milk and eggs can form soft gels that can be used to make new types of desserts and 
yoghurts. The foaming and emulsifying properties of egg white albumins can also be influenced by pressure by careful 
control of the molecular unfolding.
The way in which food is pressurised is similar to the way food is heated. Solid-type foods are first sealed into plastic 
bags and then loaded in a thick-walled steel pressure vessel. Once loaded with food packages and closed, the vessel is 
filled with a liquid such as water mixed with a small amount of soluble oil for lubrication and anti-corrosion purposes. 
Liquid foods, on the other hand, are placed directly into the vessel. The thickness of the vessel wall is determined by the 
operating pressure, volume and the expected number of times the vessel is to be used.
After removing any remaining air from the vessel, the vessel is pressurised by a powerful piston. A variety of jams, fruit 
yoghurts, fruit jellies, salad dressings and fruit sauces are now already being processed by high pressure. Citrus juices can 
typically be made at a rate of up to 6000 litres per hour.
While the many technical problems that have previously hampered high-pressure research and development have now 
been overcome, there is still much of the fundamental science of high pressure to be understood, particularly at the 
molecular level.

Introduction
Food safety has become one of the biggest consumer issues of recent years. From the public perception that food additives 
are harmful, to the high profile scares about Listeria, Salmonella and BSE (mad cow disease), there has been an increasing 
public feeling of distrust of the mass-market food industry. This is despite the fact that modern processing methods can 
now deliver a range of high quali­ty foods at unprecedented levels of production. Nevertheless, these same pro­duction 
methods bring with them a responsibility to ensure that the processed foods can be stored and used safely in the home. 
Yet despite public concerns about issues such as genetic modified foods, pesticides, fer­tilisers and animal feeds, one of 
the biggest threats to food safety remains food poisoning bacteria.
The challenge for the food industry is to use methods of preparation and processing that destroy pathogens and prevent 
re­contamination of food. Given the variety of food poisoning organ­isms and how they can thrive, this is by no means a 
small challenge.
There are several bacteria that pose a significant threat to food safety. Most can be killed by cooking and re-infection can 
be avoided by preventing cross con­tamination and by appropriate cold storage. The bacterium Bacillus cereus is found on 
virtually every agricultural commodity, but generally at levels too low to cause illness. Eating foods on which the organism 
has grown and formed toxins, however, will result in food poisoning. Toxins are responsible for illness, causing diarrhoea 
and vomiting. These can be very resistant to heat and extremes in pH. In mild cases, full recovery may be within 24 hours.
Only in the past decade or so has Campylobacter bacteria been recognised as the cause of enteritis. Many cases of infection 
have been asso­ciated with unchlorinated water and unpasteurised milk, but it is also often found raw poultry meat. The 
bacterium infects the intestinal tract, excreting toxins causing abdominal pain, fever, and diarrhoea and vomiting. The 
illness usually up to a week to mate­rialise and full recovery can take a further week.
Occurring on almost all foods, the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum bacterium is among the most toxic of all 
naturally occurring substances. The lethal dose may be as little as 0005mg. Fortunately, it is inactivated by heating at 90oC 
for just a few seconds. Symptoms of infection include weakness and fatigue followed by blurred vision and difficulty in 
swallowing. Death is usually the result of respiratory failure.
Through careful control, incidents of poisoning by C. botulinum from commercially processed foods are rare. Cooking a 
food container to ensure that its slowest heating point is exposed to temperatures equivalent to 121oC for three minutes 
(known as a Botulinum Cook) is generally sufficient to kill the organism.
Listeria monocytogenes can survive well for several weeks at -18oC in various foods. However, it does not normally survive 
commercial pasteurisation. Most L. monocytogenes cases occur in people predisposed to the infection such as those with 
illness. Not all strains of L. monocytogenes are pathogenic but those that are, are haemolyphic in that they destroy red 
blood cells. Infection usually occurs via the intestine.

There are over two thousand identifiable strains of Salmonella. The two strains of concern in Europe are S. enteritidis 
and S. typhimurium. Salmonellae invade the small, and sometimes the large intestine, where they may overcome body 
defences to reach the bloodstream and give rise to abscess­es on various tissues. Invasive strains pass into the lymphatic 
system and are engulfed by phagocytes. These bacteria re­-enter the bloodstream causing septicaemia. Since low numbers 
of salmonellae can cause illness it is important to ensure their absence from ready-to-eat foods. Salmonellae are also often 
associated with raw eggs and poultry products.
Staphylacoccus aureus occurs widely on the skin and mucous membranes of warm-blooded animals, including humans. 
Food can be contaminated through poor hygiene and storage, allow­ing food poisoning enterotoxins to form. S aureus 
cells are eas­ily destroyed by heat, but the toxin is heat resistant and will survive some sterilisation processes. Symptoms 
of enterotoxins include nausea, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea. In severe cases headache and collapse may occur. 
Recovery is usually rapid.
There are ten species of Vibrio which have food-borne pathogenic potential. Found in seafood, the bacteria prefers to grow 
in the presence of salt and is easily destroyed by drying. Food poison­ing is thought to be associated with the production 
of a heat resistant haemolysin causing the destruction of red blood cells. The symptoms are therefore similar to those for 
salmonellosis.
There four types of pathogenic Escherichia coli bacteria that have been associated with food-borne disease. The most 
notorious of these is E. coli 0157. Though often associated with undercooked meat, E. coli 0157 has been found on many 
uncooked foods, and has caused many food poisoning cases during the past decade, some of which have been fatal. 
4.2	
HACCP
The emphasis on food safety within the industry around the globe is based on the principles of prevention rather than 
cure. There has been universal adoption of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles for identifying 
hazards and putting in con­trol procedures to minimise risk. Testing is now seen as a means of verifying the HACCP 
system, rather than checking on the safety of food. 
Originally developed by NASA for the prevention of contamination in space, HACCP was designed to be a system and 
set of procedures for prevention. Applied to the food industry, it means that all elements of contamination risk in a food 
operation are checked thoroughly and is a systematic method of assessing and minimising or, if possible, eradicating risk. 
The globalisation of the food industry means that foods may be comprised of components which are harvested, processed 
and shipped from many countries. Improper storage or handling at any point or place can result in the overall food being 
contaminated from unidentifiable sources. Under HACCP the food processor is required to develop and follow a HACCP 
plan that identifies the possible hazards, the steps at which controls must be applied to prevent the hazards from occurring, 
the safety limits that apply to the control point, and the monitoring and record-keeping necessary to document and veri­fy 
that the control has been applied.

Food Safety
An example of a control point is a cooking step in which the food must be subjected to temperatures sufficient to kill any 
harmful organisms. The HACCP plan would include the temperature that the cooking must attain, and also the means of 
monitoring that temperature, the type of record used for documenting the reading; the corrective action steps to take if 
the required cooking temperature is not met; and procedures for ver­ifying that the plan is being properly implemented.
A likely source of microbial hazards to be controlled under HACCP is cross-contamination. Personal hygiene of food 
han­dlers is the main source of cross-contamination, but pests such as rodents, birds, flies and cockroaches can also cross-
contami­nate food during processing. Sanitation programmes must include pest controls to prevent live, mobile pests from 
cross-contaminating food during processing and storage. These con­trols are the basis for good manufacturing practices.
Under HACCP, these sanitation programmes are called pre­requisite programmes because they provide the foundation for 
the HACCP controls and must be properly applied if the HACCP controls are to be effective. They should not introduce 
additional hazards. The chal­lenge is therefore to identify all hazards and develop and implement a HACCP plan that is 
able to control all food safety hazards. 
HACCP applies to every food handling site and also includes cafés, restaurants, bakeries and other food handling sites, 
including abattoirs. Whatever the operation, there must be a practical system in oper­ation, ensuring that the highest 
standards of hygiene and food safety are main­tained for the benefit of the pub­lic. If a site, company or organisation does 
not have an HACCP pro­cedure, severe penalties can be imposed including fines, closure, and recall of all foods sold to 
the public. A breach of major severity may lead to a custodial prison sentence.
The HACCP consists of seven distinct steps:
1.	 Assess the hazards
2.	 Identify critical control points
3.	 Set up control procedures and standards for critical control points
4.	 Monitor the critical control points
5.	 Take any corrective actions
6.	 Establish effective record keeping
7.	 Verify that the system is working
For food handling sites HACCP monitors the minimum num­ber of critical points necessary to ensure a safe product. 
Deci­sions about the existence of critical points are based on scien­tific facts and statistics. A well-run HACCP system can 
con­trol each critical point to eliminate occurrence of hazards.

Hygienic Design
The design of process equipment and plant should ensure that the food being processed can be processed safely without 
the risk of contamination either through expose to contaminated air, liquids or surfaces. Contamination may also be due 
to food process operators. Equipment should therefore be manufactured from approved food-grade materials and be 
designed such that the equipment can either be disassembled and cleaned manually or cleaned automatically in place. There 
should be no dead spots and cleaning programmes designed to remove chemically and physically any material which may 
have adhered to the surface. The cleaning agents should also be thoroughly washed from the equipment after cleaning. 
From raw ingre­dients to the finished product, a food processing facility may have areas con­sisting of warehousing, dispatch, 
raw ingredient storage, cold storage, chillers, ingredient mixing, production, packag­ing, utensil and equipment wash, 
laboratories, plant rooms, mezzanine decks, staff changing rooms, toilets and offices. Each area has its own particular 
requirements for design.
It is essential that floor finishes satisfy all legislation. In high-risk zones the floor finish is required to be seamless, hygienic, 
durable and easy-to-clean and maintain. The flooring must also be able to withstand all, or a combination of chemi­cal 
resistance, thermal shock, impact, abrasion resistance, flexibility on mezzanine decks. All facilities require a floor finish 
to be slip-resistant, hygienic and easy to maintain. Floor materials should be able to withstand aggressive and abrasive 
cleaning as well as steam cleaning process­es that are essential for maintaining hygiene. The floor is likely to have to impact 
resistance and well as resistance to chemical attack and high temperatures. Careful planning is needed in the replacement 
or refur­bishment of existing floors, to make maximum use of down­time, to keep lost production to a minimum and to 
avoid any risk of odour contamination.

Food Safety
Although there is a wide variety of flooring materials available only a few are suitable for the food industry. Seamless resin 
compounds and slip-resistant heavy duty vinyl flooring materials are the most popular for high risk zones and can satisfy 
most or all of the requirements of food manufacture and retail. Resin flooring systems range from high solid content 
coatings for low-traffic areas to heavy-duty screeds for high-risk zones, such as ingredient mixing and blending, production, 
warehousing, freezers and chillers. There are many resin systems available, including acrylics, polymers, polyesters, epoxy 
and polyurethane. Modern resin systems such as polyurethane screeds are at the forefront of resin development and 
constructed for the harsh environment of food processing and manufacturing offering excellent chemical resistance. In 
less demanding low-risk areas of laboratories, staff changing rooms and toilets, epoxy resin systems or slip-resis­tant vinyl 
materials offer a wide range of finishes, thickness and a firm grip underfoot.
Good housekeeping and maintaining general tidiness is essential to ensure risks are reduced to a minimum and the 
avoidance of contamination. This can be improved by installing trays for the collection of waste. Sweeping, shovelling or 
vacuuming of spilt material rather than hosing it down the drain should be used. Procedures for manual cleaning processes 
should also ensure that hoses and water lances use trigger controls to minimise the amount of wash down water. High 
pressure, low volume water systems are preferable.
In using cleaning chemicals, operators should be trained in the handling, making up of working solutions and their 
application. The concentration of the chemical agent should not be too high and the overuse of chemicals avoided, 
particularly where manual dosing is used.
In the design of Cleaning-in-Place (CIP) systems, remnants of dry product should be expelled or removed before the start 
of the wash cycle by gravity draining, pigging or air blowdown. A pre-rinse is then used to enable remaining product to 
be recovered for re-use or disposal. Turbidity detectors can be used to maximise product recovery.
A CIP programme should be optimised for the plant or vessel size and soiling type to ensure that the automatic dosing of 
chemicals are set at the correct concentrations (see Table 4.1). The programme should include internal recycling of water 
and chemicals, a recycle control on conductivity rather than time with a continuous cleaning of re-circulated solutions.
Processing equipment and production facilities are cleaned and sanitised periodically, with the frequency varying according 
to products and processes. The aim of cleaning and sanitation is to remove product remnants from the foregoing process 
and remove other contaminants and microbes.
Manual cleaning means that the equipment to be cleaned is taken apart and manually cleaned (brushed) in a cleaning 
solution. Only mild conditions, with regard to temperature and cleaning agents, can be used.
Cleaning in place (CIP) is used especially for closed process equipment and tanks. The cleaning solution is pumped 
through the equipment and is sometimes distributed by sprayers. The cleaning programme is mostly run automatically and 
includes a pre-rinse with water, circulation with a cleaning solution, and intermediate rinse, disinfection and a final rinse 
with water. In automatic CIP systems the final rinse water is often reused for pre-rinsing. Typical cleaning temperatures 
are around 90oC and used together with strong cleaning agents.

In high-pressure jet-cleaning, water is sprayed at the surface to be cleaned at a pressure of about 40 to 65 bar. Cleaning 
agents are injected in the water and temperatures up to 60oC are used. An important aspect of the cleaning action is due 
to the mechanical effect of cleaning. There are, however, hygiene implications of over-splash and aerosols.
In foam cleaning, a foaming cleaning solution is sprayed on the surface to be cleaned. The foam adheres to the surface 
and remains on the surface before being rinsed away. High-pressure jet-cleaning and foam cleaning is generally applied 
for open equipment, walls and floors.
Cleaning agents used in food and drink industry include alkalis such as sodium and potassium hydroxide, sodium 
carbonate, acids such as nitric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid and gluconic acid. Formulated cleaning agents containing 
chelating agents include EDTA, NTA, phosphates, polyphosphates, phosphonates as well as and surface active agents.

Food Packaging
The function of food packaging is to provide protection from physical damage, chemical attack, environmental 
contamination and tampering and as well as forming good product utilisation. Food packaging is designed for each food 
product in order to make it easier or more convenient for a consumer to use. The packaging is also designed to provide 
good communication to the consumer or user. In particular, packaging should convey details of the product identity, 
the mount and number of servings, ingredient contents, nutritional content, preparation instructions, consumer service 
information and include coupons, recipes and any promotional offers.
Food packaging is required to be non-toxic, sanitary, durable, easy to use, economical, recyclable, designed to extend 
product shelf-life and provide a good barrier. Packaging may therefore be designed to be permeable, semi-permeable, 
or impermeable to water as a liquid or vapour, oxygen, carbon dioxide, volatiles and light. After use, packaging can be 
re-used, recycled, sent to landfill or incinerated.

Metal (Steel Cans) 
Fabricated from steel with a thin tin and/or polymer coating, coatings protect the steel and prevent electrochemical reactions

Thermal Processing
5	 Thermal Processing
5.1	
Introduction
The purpose of thermal processing foods is to destroy pathogenic and spoilage micro-organisms and their spores as well 
as to inactivate enzymes and metabolic reactions resulting in senescence. However, high temperatures can also degrade 
product appearance, texture, and nutrient quality. The advantages of thermal processing in terms of food safety and 
increased shelf life must be balanced with the disadvantages of loss of nutrient and sensory attributes.
A number of thermal processing methods are commercially used each using a different temperature and treatment time 
strategy:
Blanching:
This is a mild heat treatment, usually applied to fruits and vegetables to denature enzymes and is often used before freezing. 
It uses either hot water above 80oC or live steam.
Pasteurisation:
Pasteurisation destroys pathogenic micro-organisms and extends the shelf life of a food. Pasteurised products may still 
contain many viable organisms capable of growing and causing spoilage defects. An example is milk in which pasteurisation 
is usually combined with another means of preservation such as refrigeration. The levels of pasteurisation used to thermally 
process milk are: 
• 
Low Temperature Long Time (LTLT): 63°C for 30 minutes
• 
High Temperature Short Time (HTST): 72°C for 15 seconds
• 
Ultra High Temperature (UHT): 135°C (or above ) for 2 seconds
Commercial Sterilisation:
Commercial sterilisation refers to the destruction of all pathogenic and toxin-forming organisms, as well as other types 
of organisms which, if present, could result in food spoilage under normal handling and storage conditions. These foods 
may contain a small number of heat resistant bacterial spores, but under normal handling and storage conditions will not 
multiply. Types of commercially sterile processes include canning, bottling, and aseptic processing. Most commercially 
sterile food products have a shelf life exceeding two years.
Sterilisation
Sterilisation refers to the complete destruction of all micro-organisms, including both vegetative cells and spores. 
Called the logarithmic order of death, bacteria are destroyed by heat at a rate that is proportional to the number present 
in the food being heated. Expressed as the “D-value,” or decimal reduction time this is the time in minutes at a specific 
temperature required to destroy 90% (or one log cycle) of the organisms in a population. The time (or number of D-values) 
required depends on the processing temperature, type of micro-organism(s) that are in the food and the physical and 
chemical characteristics of the food product.

Thermal Processing
Example:
Consider a food containing 1,000,000 viable, pathogenic micro-organisms. The D-value for killing this pathogen is one 
minute at 121°C. Determine the time taken to reduce the population to 1 viable cell. 
Solution:
The reduction of pathogenic micro-organisms in a food that is thermally processed at 121°C is given by
This is referred to as a “6D process,” in which only 1 in 1 million bacteria survive the thermal processing. In a 12D process 
1 in 1 million million cells survive. This is commonly used in commercial canning.
The important factors for assuring adequate thermal processing include size and shape of the can, ingredients and pH 
of the food product and viscosity of the food product. The mechanisms of heat transfer are radiation, conduction and 
convection. In radiation, infrared energy is absorbed by food surface while conduction is the transfer of heat through the 
solid body and convection is through convection currents in liquids and gases.
Not all packaging materials conduct heat at the same rate. The cold point in a can or food mass is the location that is 
last to reach the final heating temperature. A thermocouple can be used to determine location of the cold point. Higher 
temperatures facilitate shorter processing times for microbial destruction, and shorter time favours retention of desirable 
quality attributes. 
5.2	
Thermal Death
As with all living things, micro-organisms are sensitive to heat. To destroy a micro-organism requires thermal energy that 
must be sufficient to be lethal. This energy must be held for a sufficient period of time to ensure death. For each type of 
micro-organism it is necessary to identify the temperature and exposure time that is required.
Temperature is a measure of the vibrational energy of molecules. There is a certain probability that the organism will die 
after a given time above some threshold temperature. The cause of thermal death is thought to be due to the irreversible 
denaturation of certain enzymes critical for DNA or RNA replication.

Empirical observations have shown that at constant temperature, many micro-organisms will die at a rate that is first 
order with respect to time. The time rate of change of organisms that have survived the heat treatment, can be described 
mathematically as
By considering isothermal conditions the assumption that k is a constant is valid. The equation holds true for a wide range 
of organisms even when more than one species of organism may be present. The number of surviving micro-organisms 
is therefore found from

where N(to) is the number of organisms initially present at time to. Note that the number of remaining viable organisms 
will approach zero only as the treatment time approaches infinity. In other words, sterility can not be achieved according 
to this model. The model is, however, widely used. This is because the model is based on probability. This is due to the 
fact that this is a mathematically continuous model used to describe the behaviour of a collection of discrete organisms, 
each of which will react to the application of heat in a slightly different way. 
The time required to reduce the population of a particular contaminating micro-organism by a factor of ten is a commonly 
mentioned quantity and is calculated as
The Decimal Reduction Time is the time taken at constant temperature for a ten-fold reduction in surviving micro-
organisms. For a food to be sterile will require a number of log cycles. A 12 cycle reduction or 12D cook is required for 
canned processes. This is called the thermal death time, tD, and is a term used with thermal processing of foods and is 
defined as the time required for the complete kill of all organisms in a given suspension. Experimentally, measurements 
can be made of the number of organisms surviving a particular treatment and then extrapolating to zero. Practically, a 
commonly used approach to estimate the thermal death time is to determine the thermal death constant, and calculate 
the time required to reduce the viable count to one organism.
Defining the initial concentration of organisms as 10B, then
Note that where there is a significant time for heating and cooling of the solution, the heating time and the cooling time 
also contributes to the killing of organisms, as well as to the denaturation of other heat sensitive materials. It is therefore 
necessary to integrate the kinetic death model from the time at which the lethal temperature is first reached until the time 
when the solution is cooled below this temperature. 
A widely used term is the F121 value. This the thermal death time at 121°C. Another term is the Z parameter which is the 
temperature rise required to bring about a ten-fold decrease in the thermal death time (see Table 5.1).

The thermal death times of spores of a contaminating micro-organism in a food product are 6 minutes at 120°C and 2

Canning 
Canning is used as a long term storage method for many food products. When meat, fish or fruit products are hermetically 
sealed in a container, any accompanying micro-organisms, if not otherwise destroyed, will multiply if conditions are 
favourable. Microbial destruction is therefore the core to the process of canning. High temperatures are required the 
completely destroy bacterial spores although high temperatures may also influence the organoleptic properties of the 
contents of the cans. It is therefore necessary to determine the time and temperature required to sterilise the food and 
still produce a desirable product.
In the canning of meat, meat is delivered to the canning factory in the form of carcasses, quarters, or smaller pieces. 
After it has been checked for quality, it is freed from bone, tendons and fat, sorted, trimmed and then cut into small 
pieces which helps filling. The meat is partially cooked meat is filled into cans. More meat is overfilled to compensate for 
moisture loss during sterilisation. Meat jelly is prepared and added which acts as a binder and improves the appearance 
and palatability of the canned meat. A lid is then placed and sealed, and the cans then placed in a steam autoclave to be 
heated for a specified time.

Milk Processing
The dairy industry which has been established on practical experience over centuries is today a highly complex organisation 
responsible for producing and distributing processed milk and its associated products. Production of milk begins on the 
farm. The milk that is of interest comes from cows, goats and, to a certain extent, sheep. Breeds and characteristics of dairy 
animals influence the milk quality. From the farms, the milk is sent to milk processing plants where it is subdivided into 
heat-treated milks (pasteurised or sterilised) and homogenised, soft curd, irradiated and fermented milks. The treatment of 
milk is focussed on the destruction of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli that is responsible for causing tuberculosis, 
which is a disease of the lungs. 
The composition of milk varies with the age and breed of animal, the way the animal is fed and the elapsed calving time. 
Raw milk is blended so as to annul any variations. When milk is heated extra care is taken to ensure that milk composition 
remains unaltered.
Named after the 19th centaury scientist Louis Pasteur who first discovered that spoilage organisms in wine could be 
inactivated by applying heat at temperatures below its boiling point, the pasteurisation of milk depends on the total count 
of heat resisting organisms present. To produce a pasteurised product of satisfactory quality, it is essential that the raw 
milk supply is also of good hygienic quality. Pasteurisation methods are usually standardized and controlled by national 
food safety agencies. In the UK, a temperature of not less than 71.7°C for at least 15 seconds is used (see Figure 5.1)
The conditions of pasteurisation are similar worldwide albeit with minor variations in time–temperature combinations, 
cooling temperatures and testing procedures. The pasteurisation process, which is a mild form of heat treatment in which 
the milk has no appreciably cooked flavour and a low whey protein denaturation of between 5% and 15%, is either carried 
out as a batch or continuous process.

Holder Process
The Holder thermal process requires a temperature of not less 62.8°C not more than 65.6°C for at least 30 minutes, and 
then immediately cooled to a temperature of not more than 10°C. Regarded as being uneconomic on the large scale, 
it is used as a batch process for pasteurisation of human breast milk for neonatal purposes due to its low temperature 
preserving essential growth hormonal components. 
5.4.2	
High Temperature Short Time HTST
In the HTST process, raw milk at 10°C enters the process through the regeneration section. Raw milk and is heated to 
68.6oC by hot milk, which, in turn, cools. The now warm milk enters the final heating section where hot water or electricity 
is used to heat it to the desired temperature. It then passes through a holding tube and through the regeneration section, 
and enters the main water and chilled water-cooling sections. 
Most HTST pasteurisers use plate heat exchangers, which offer a large surface area for heat transfer within a compact 
space. The gap between the plates is narrow so as to induce turbulence and to maintain the required pressure drop in the 
system. Such heat exchangers are suitable for low viscosity fluids, which are sensitive to heat.

Homogenisation
Homogenised milk is produced from raw milk that is first warmed and then forced through a fine aperture. This breaks 
down fat globules into smaller particles that remain distributed through the milk. The milk is then either pasteurised by 
bottling, sealing and heat treating at 110°C to 115°C for 20 to 30 minutes and allowing it to cool, or it is UHT processed.
5.4.4	
Ultra High Temperature UHT
Invented in the 1960s, UHT is used to kill spores found in milk but is also used for processing fruit other liquid diary 
products, fruit juices and soups. UHT processing involves short times of one to two seconds at temperatures exceeding 
135°C. Continuous UHT process equipment is similar to that used in the HTST pasteurisation process and uses plate 
heat or tubular heat exchangers. 
The of shelf life UHT processed milks is typically nine months. However, due to the high temperatures used in UHT 
processing, Maillard browning can occur resulting in a change in taste and darkening of colour.

Introduction
All living things age with time. For fruit and vegetables, ageing can be extended beyond harvesting. The process of ripening 
can be slowed by cold storage. However, a carefully controlled temperature must be maintained that is sufficient to slow 
down the ripening processes and the activities of bacteria and fungi yet sufficient to prevent it from failing to ripen, 
ripen too quickly and go rotten, or be very prone to attack by fungi. Grapefruit, oranges and tomatoes, for example, are 
required to be stored at 7°C while bananas require a higher temperature of between 12°C and 14°C and. Apples range 
from -1°C to 4°C.
The fact that the activity of bacteria is reduced at low temperatures is of great importance in extending the shelf life of 
foods. It means that meat can be eaten which has taken several weeks to arrive from overseas in cold storage. Lamb 
produced in New Zealand, for example, is frozen before it is packed into the refrigerated holds of meat-carrying ships in 
which the temperature is held at -13°C to -12°C. Very little flavour is lost during the long voyage to Europe. If stored for 
longer than three months, flavour and tenderness is lost and the meat begins to deteriorate through surface dehydration.
For some kinds of food, such as wet fish, a damp atmosphere is maintained in cold stores. Poultry, on the other hand, 
are generally wet and warm when it arrives at the cold store. Dry, cold air is circulated so that excess moisture and heat 
are removed.
6.2	
Definition of Freezing
Freezing will occur at different rates at different points in the piece or package of food. The location that cools slowest is 
known as the thermal centre and the freezing times are usually defined with reference to this point. The highest temperature 
at which ice crystals have a stable existence in a food material is conventionally known as the freezing point of that material. 
However, because of the nature of foodstuffs and the presence of water-soluble constituents, not all of the water solidifies 
at this temperature. Under equilibrium conditions and at a temperature just below the freezing point, a certain fraction of 
the water present remains in a fluid phase. This fraction falls when the temperature is lowered and the eutectic mixtures 
may separate from the unfrozen fluid, but unfrozen water is still present at comparatively low temperatures. Thus, it is 
not possible to define a clear endpoint to the freezing process.
The freezing time of a body may be defined as the time taken for its thermal centre to fall through the zone of maximum 
ice crystal formation. A body may be regarded as quick frozen if the period is two hours or less. The effective freezing 
time has been defined as the time required to reduce the temperature of the product from its initial average value to a 
given thermal centre. If the temperature is monitored at the thermal centre of a food as heat is removed, a characteristic 
curve shown in Figure 6.1 is obtained.

Figure 6.1 Freezing curve
The main features of the curve are:
AS	
The food is cooled to below its freezing point, which, with the exception of water, is always below 0°C. At point 
S the water remains liquid, although the temperature is below the freezing point. This phenomenon is known as 
super-cooling and may be as much as 10°C below the freezing point.
SB	
The temperature rises rapidly to the freezing point as ice crystals begin to form and latent heat of crystallisation 
is released.
BC	
Heat is removed from the food at the same rate as before. Latent heat is removed and ice forms, but the temperature 
remains almost constant. The freezing point is depressed by the increase in solute concentration in the unfrozen 
liquor, and the temperature therefore falls slightly. It is during this stage that most of the ice forms.
CD	
One of the solutes becomes supersaturated and crystallises out. The latent heat of crystallisation is released and 
the temperature rises to the eutectic temperature for that solute.
DE	
Crystallisation of water and solute continues. The total time taken for the freezing plateau is determined by the 
rate at which heat is removed.
EF	
The temperature of the ice-water mixture falls to the temperature of the freezer. 
The total amount of heat to be removed by the freezing equipment consists of sensible heat change needed to cool the 
food to its freezing point, the latent heat of fusion involved in solidifying the liquid water in the food to ice and, finally, 
the sensible heat change to cool the frozen piece to its final temperature. Thus

There are various ways in which the specific heat of a food material can be expressed. 
The change in enthalpy of cooled foods can alternatively be determined from experimental data which, by convention, 
the enthalpy is taken as 0 kJ.kg-1 at -40°C. The specific enthalpy and thermophysical properties of some foods are given 
in Tables 6.1 and 6.2.
It is worth noting at this point that the thermal conductivity of ice is some five times greater than that of water and the 
thermal diffusivity is some ten times greater than that of water. It is therefore easier to propagate temperature in ice 
rather than water. The thermal conductivity for foods is less than that for ice because not all the food is ice and also food, 
generally, has a large voidage.
Example:
The latent heat of a food is found by experiment to be 2.3x105 J.kg-1. Estimate the moisture content of the food from this 
value.

Solution:
Using data in Table 6.2, the time for the block to reach its freezing point is therefore determined from
or about 17 minutes.
6.1.1	
Quick-Freezing
As an advance on cold air storage, “quick-freezing” was developed the result of the early pioneering work of Clarence 
Birdseye in the 1930s in which he noticed how the Eskimos of Arctic Canada kept food in the intense cold of the open 
air for several months and yet were able to eat it as fresh when it was thawed. It was found that food that is frozen quickly 
and kept at a sufficiently low temperature loses little flavour or textural properties and can still be fresh many months later.
When food is frozen slowly, large ice crystals form in the cells of the food. The crystals rupture the cell walls as they grow. 
When the food is thawed the water drains away carrying salts and other minerals with it. The food consequently loses 
it flavour and value. In the “quick-freeze” method the ice crystals are formed much more quickly and are much smaller. 
All the moisture in the food freezes before the crystals have had time to reach a size sufficient to rupture the cell walls. 
When the food is thawed no moisture is lost.
6.1.2	
Freezing Kinetics
Formulae are available for estimating the effective freezing time, although calculations involving unsteady state heat 
transfer with a change of phase are not always straightforward. Such formulae are usually based on the assumptions that 
the body to be frozen is initially at a uniform temperature and is cooled by a constant temperature medium. It is also 
assumed that the body has a constant thermal conductivity and the specific heat are different for the frozen and unfrozen 
states, has a constant density that does not vary with temperature or alter during the freezing process and that there is a 
definite freezing point at which all the latent heat of fusion is liberated. 
If the body to be frozen is initially at its freezing point and that there is no pre-cooling period, hence no heat flows in 
the unfrozen material, the calculation of its freezing time is comparatively simple. Further simplification occurs if the 
material at the thermal centre at the end of the freezing process is assumed to be frozen, but still at its freezing point. The 
freezing time calculated on these assumptions may be termed the calculated freezing time. The effective freezing time can 
be estimated from the calculated freezing time by applying corrections to allow any pre- and post-cooling.

Formulae for the calculated freezing times can be simplified by making use of three dimensionless groups. Two of these, 
the Biot (Bi) and Fourier (Fo) numbers, are commonly used for unsteady state heat transfer and are given by:
and
where h is the surface heat transfer coefficient at the surface of the body, l is the characteristic dimension of the body, k 
is the thermal conductivity of the frozen body and α is the thermal diffusivity of the body given by:
where ρ is the density and cp is the specific heat of the food.
It is often important to determine the temperature at the centre of a body in the final stages of heating and cooling. When 
a solid body changes temperature from T1 to T0 it is convenient to express the temperature, T, of a point within it at time 
t during the change as a dimensionless temperature, V, as
Clearly V will have an initial value of 1.0 and will tend to zero as the change progresses. Formulae for V are conveniently 
expressed in the terms of the Bi and Fo numbers. Expressions giving V as a function of time are available but are cumbersome. 
Charts are available for determining V at certain points in slabs, rods, cylinders, spheres and brick-shaped bodies.
In calculating the Biot and Fourier numbers, the characteristic dimension is the shortest distance from the thermal centre 
to the surface of the body being frozen. The calculated freezing time and the thermal constants used are those for the 
frozen material. Figures 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 are used to determine the temperature of a food found from the dimensionless 
temperature, V, and Fourier number.

Freezing of a Slab
To determine the time taken to freeze a semi-infinite slab of food, assume that the foodstuff is a finite slab of thickness 
2l with a heat transfer coefficient at both surfaces as shown. The slab is considered to be semi-infinite since the width far 
exceeds the thickness so end effects are not needed to be taken into consideration. 
Now assume also that the slab is already at its freezing point and that the material does not change in density and a 
phase change takes place at a specific phase transition temperature. Consider one face of the slab where a thickness dx 
is frozen in time dt. 
The rate of heat release unit area, q, (flux) at the freezing front is therefore
The rate of heat transfer by conduction per unit area through the frozen layer is given by
where k is the thermal conductivity of the frozen foodstuff and x is the thickness of ice formed at the surface. Thus
The rate of convection from the surface per unit area is given by

Sliced pork is quick frozen in a continuous blast freezer using chilled air. The air with a mass flow of 20 kg. m-2.s-1 is 
passed through a stack of trays at -34°C in a duct of mean hydraulic diameter of 0.1m. Assuming that the pork slices, 
which have a slab of thickness 1.0 cm, are considered to be infinite in each direction perpendicular to the heat flow, that

General Case for Freezing
The Plank equation can be developed from first principles for other geometries such as cylinders and spheres. Plank’s 
work may by summarised in the dimensionless form
where the constants D and G are determined by the geometry of the body being frozen. G takes the value ½ for the infinite 
slab, infinite cylinder and sphere. The constant D is given by

where V is the volume of the body and a is the area of its cooled surface. For the infinite slab, infinite cylinder and sphere 
D takes the values 1, ½ and ⅓, respectively.
In practical applications it is often difficult to decide on an appropriate value for the heat transfer coefficient, h. For the 
blast freezing of unpacked food heat transfer coefficients can be calculated from standard formulae.
Example:
Determine the geometric constant D for the freezing of spherical shaped foods such as peas.
Solution:
The geometric index is given by
6.4	
Chilling
The chilling of foods is a process by which the temperature of a food is reduced to a desired holding temperature just 
above the freezing point and is usually in the range of -2°C to 2°C. The effect of chilling is to slow the rate of deterioration 
and reactions that are temperature dependent. The chilling of food therefore extends shelf-life.
The rate of chilling is governed by the laws of (unsteady state) heat transfer. To determine the rate of chilling, it is 
necessary to evaluate the surface heat transfer coefficient, the resistance offered to heat flow by any packing material and 
the unsteady state conduction.
Although the shape and geometry of most foods are not regular, they often approximate to the shape of slabs, bricks, 
spheres and cylinders.

or about 1 hour and 3 minutes. It is worth noting that a complete analysis should take into account the mass transfer from 
the surface of the food in which moistures is drawn from the surface effectively drying the food.
Example:
Rectangular blocks of food 2 cm high, 5 cm deep and 8 cm broad are to be frozen in a continuous blast-freezing tunnel 
on a belt 1.5 m wide. The blocks are to be placed on the belt, which offers negligible resistance to heat flow to the face in 
contact with it. The blocks are to be placed so that the 8 cm breadth is across the belt while the 5 cm depth is along the 
belt in the direction of travel.
Three forms of placement are possible, with the blocks being packed together in a slab, lined up across the belt in bars 
5cm apart, or individually spaced 5cm apart as shown below in Figure 6.7:

Assuming that the heat transfer coefficient at every exposed face is the same and is not influenced by the arrangement, 
determine which arrangement will give the highest plant throughput. The second geometric coefficient in Plank’s equation, 
G, may be assumed to be equal to ½ in each case.
Solution:
In each case the time for freezing for a slab is given by
Thus for the three cases, the time is proportional to the geometric index, D. So
This shows that the individual blocks freezing 39% quicker than those closely packed. However, the number of blocks 
spread over the belt (taking a 1.0 length of belt) is
The relative throughput is therefore
The best arrangement is therefore to compress the blocks together in spite of the slower freezing time.

the burger centres along the length of the belt and the belt is perforated so that the freezing may be assumed to take 
place equally from both sides. The burgers are initially at their freezing point of -2°C and emerge from the freezer with
