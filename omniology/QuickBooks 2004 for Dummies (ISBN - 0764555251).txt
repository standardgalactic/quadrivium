About the Author
Stephen L. Nelson, MBA, CPA, has a simple purpose in life: He wants to help
you (and people like you) manage your business finances by using comput-
ers. Oh, sure, this personal mandate won’t win him a Nobel Prize or anything,
but it’s his own little contribution to the world.
Steve’s education and experiences mesh nicely with his special purpose.
He has a B.S. in accounting and an MBA in finance. He’s a CPA in Redmond,
Washington. He used to work as a senior consultant and CPA with Arthur
Andersen & Co. (er, yeah, that Arthur Andersen — but hey it was 20 years
ago). Steve, whose books have sold more than 4 million copies in English and
have been translated into 11 other languages, is also the bestselling author of
Quicken 2003 For Dummies (from Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Dedication
To the entrepreneurs and small-business people of the world. You folks
create most of the new jobs.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Hey, reader, lots of folks spent lots of time working on this book to make

taloupe, eating grapes, and looking for the perfect peach.
Those folks include my acquisitions editor, Bob Woerner, and my editors, Kim
Darosett, Kevin Kirschner, and Joey Carstensen. 
Thanks to all for a job well-done!

Introduction
I
think that running, or working in, a small business is one of the coolest
things a person can do. Really. I mean it. Sure, sometimes the environment
is dangerous. Kind of like the Old West. But it’s also an environment in which
you have the opportunity to make tons of money. And it’s an environment in
which you can build a company or a job that fits you. In comparison, many
brothers and sisters working in big-company corporate America are furiously
trying to fit their round pegs into painfully square holes. Yuck.
You’re wondering, of course, what any of this has to do with this book or with
QuickBooks. Quite a lot, actually. The whole purpose of this book is to make
it easier for you to run or work in a small business by using QuickBooks.

Let me start off with a minor but useful point. QuickBooks comes in several
different flavors: QuickBooks Basic, QuickBooks Pro, QuickBooks Premier,
and QuickBooks Premier: Accountants Edition.
This book, however, talks about QuickBooks Premier.
Does this mean that I’ve somehow left you adrift if you’ve got one of these
other flavors? No way. I wouldn’t do that to you. QuickBooks Premier is a
superset of QuickBooks Basic and QuickBooks Pro, so by describing how you
use QuickBooks Premier, I also tell you how to use the other flavors of
QuickBooks.
What’s more, for the readers of this book, there’s no discernible difference
between QuickBooks Pro and either flavor of QuickBooks Premier. You’re not
reading this book to prepare for the CPA exam, right? Right. The extra whis-
tles and bells that make QuickBooks Premier, well, “premier” are all things
that only accountants care about: remote access to QuickBooks and your
QuickBooks data, reversing general entries, extra security for general ledger
closings, and so on.
The bottom line? Yes, there are several flavors of QuickBooks, but if you’re
just trying to get started and want to use QuickBooks, this book works for
QuickBooks Basic, QuickBooks Pro, and QuickBooks Premier.

About This Book
This book isn’t meant to be read from cover to cover like some Harry Potter
page turner. Instead, it’s organized into tiny, no-sweat descriptions of how 
you do the things you need to do. If you’re the sort of person who just doesn’t
feel right not reading a book from cover to cover, you can, of course, go ahead 
and read this thing from front to back. You can start reading Chapter 1 and 
continue all the way to the end (which means through Chapter 21 and the
appendixes).
I actually don’t think this from-start-to-finish approach is bad, because I tell you
a bunch of stuff. I tried to write the book in such a way that the experience isn’t
as bad as you might think, and I really do think you get good value from your
reading.
But you also can use this book like an encyclopedia. If you want to know about
a subject, you can look it up in the table of contents or the index. Then you can
flip to the correct chapter or page and read as much as you need or enjoy. No
muss, no fuss.
I should, however, mention one thing: Accounting software programs require
you to do a certain amount of preparation before you can use them to get
real work done. If you haven’t started to use QuickBooks yet, I recommend
that you read through the first few chapters of this book to find out what you
need to do first.
Hey. There’s something else I should tell you. I have fiddled a bit with the
Windows display settings. For example, I’ve noodled around with the font
settings and most of the colors. The benefit is that the pictures in this book
are easy to read. And that’s good. But the cost of all this is that my pictures
look a little bit different from what you see on your screen. And that’s not
good. In the end, however, what the publisher has found is that people are
really happier with increased readability. Anyway, I just thought I should
mention this here, up front, in case you had any question about it.
What You Can Safely Ignore
Sometimes I provide step-by-step descriptions of tasks. I feel very bad about
having to do this. So to make things easier for you, I describe the tasks by
using bold text. That way, you know exactly what you’re supposed to do. I
also provide a more detailed explanation in the text that follows the step. You
can skip the text that accompanies the step-by-step boldfaced directions if
you already understand the process.
2
QuickBooks 2004 For Dummies

Here’s an example that shows what I mean:
1. Press Enter.
Find the key that’s labeled Enter or Return. Extend your index finger so
that it rests ever so gently on the Enter key. In one sure, fluid motion,
press the Enter key by using your index finger. Then release your finger.
Okay, that example is kind of extreme. I never actually go into that much
detail. But you get the idea. If you know how to press Enter, you can just do
that and not read further. If you need help — maybe with the finger part or
something — just read the nitty-gritty details.
Can you skip anything else? Let me see now. . . . You can skip the Technical
Stuff icons, too. The information next to these icons is really there only for
those of you who like that kind of stuff.
For that matter, I guess that you can safely ignore the stuff next to the Tip
icons, too — even if the accumulated wisdom, gleaned from long hours slaving
over a hot keyboard, could save you much weeping and gnashing of teeth. If
you’re someone who enjoys trying to do something another way, go ahead
and read the tips.
What You Should Not Ignore 
(Unless You’re a Masochist)
Don’t skip the Warning icons. They’re the ones flagged with the picture of 
the nineteenth-century bomb. They describe some things that you really
shouldn’t do.
Out of respect for you, I’m not going to put stuff such as “don’t smoke” next 
to these icons. I figure that you’re an adult. You can make your own lifestyle
decisions. So I’m reserving the Warning icons for more urgent and immediate
dangers — things akin to “Don’t smoke while you’re filling your car with 
gasoline.”
Three Foolish Assumptions
I’m making three assumptions:
 You have a PC with Microsoft Windows 95 or later or Windows NT 4.0 or
higher. (I took pictures of the QuickBooks windows and dialog boxes
while using Windows XP, in case you’re interested.)
3
Introduction

 You know a little bit about how to work with your computer.
 You have or will buy a copy of QuickBooks, QuickBooks Pro, or
QuickBooks Premier for each computer on which you want to run the
program.
Personally, I use QuickBooks Premier, so this book includes some features
unique to the Pro and Premier versions. If you’re trying to decide which
version to buy, I should tell you that QuickBooks Pro and Premier include
networking capabilities (which I describe in Chapter 3) and the ability to
create estimates and bids (which I describe in Appendix C). The standard
version of QuickBooks doesn’t include these features.
This book works for QuickBooks 2004, although in a pinch you could prob-
ably also use it for QuickBooks 2003 or 2005. (I’ve got to say, however, that if
you have QuickBooks 2003, you might instead want to return this book and
trade it in for QuickBooks 2003 For Dummies by yours truly, which is also
published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.)
By the way, if you haven’t already installed QuickBooks and need help, refer to
Appendix A, which tells you how to install QuickBooks in ten easy steps. And
if you’re just starting out with Microsoft Windows, peruse Chapter 1 of the
Windows User’s Guide or one of these books on your flavor of Windows, such
as Small Business Windows 98 For Dummies, which I wrote; or Windows 98 For
Dummies, Windows 2000 Professional For Dummies, Microsoft Windows Me For
Dummies, or Windows XP For Dummies by Andy Rathbone (all published by
Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into five mostly coherent parts.
Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace
Part I covers some upfront stuff that you need to take care of before you can
start using QuickBooks. This part also introduces the networking capabilities
of QuickBooks Pro. I promise I won’t waste your time here. I just want to
make sure that you get off on the right foot.
Part II: Daily Chores
The second part of this book explains how you use QuickBooks for your daily
financial record keeping: preparing customer invoices, recording sales, and
paying bills — that kind of stuff.
4
QuickBooks 2004 For Dummies

I guess you could say that these chores are just data entry stuff. And you’d be
correct. But you’ll be amazed at how much easier QuickBooks will make your
life. QuickBooks is a really cool program.
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often
Part III talks about the kinds of things you should do at the end of the week,
the end of the month, or the end of the year. This part explains, for example,
how you print checks, explore QuickBooks online resources, do payroll, bal-
ance your bank account, create reports, take care of some housekeeping
tasks, and create a business budget.
While I’m on the subject, I also want to categorically deny that Part III con-
tains any secret messages that you can decipher by reading backward. Yllaer.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Gravity isn’t just a good idea; it’s a law.
By tradition, the same is true for this part of a For Dummies book. The Part of
Tens provides a collection of lists: ten tips for Webifying your business, ten
things you should do if you own a business, ten things to do when you next
visit Acapulco — oops, sorry about that last one. Wrong book.
Also by tradition, these ten-item lists don’t need to have exactly ten items.
You know the concept of a baker’s dozen, right? You order a dozen dough-
nuts but get 13 for the same price. Well, For Dummies ten-item lists have
roughly ten items. (If the Dummies Man — the bug-eyed, paleface guy suffer-
ing from triangle-shaped-head syndrome who appears on the cover of this
book and on icons throughout these pages — were running the bakery, a ten-
doughnut order might mean that you get anywhere from 8 to 13 doughnuts.)
Do you believe that I’m an accountant? So exacting that it’s scary.
Part V: Appendixes
An unwritten rule says that computer books have appendixes, so I’ve
included three. Appendix A tells you how to install QuickBooks in ten easy
steps. Appendix B explains small business accounting, provides a short biog-
raphy of an Italian monk, and explains double-entry bookkeeping. Appendix C
describes project estimating.

Introduction

Conventions Used in This Book
To make the best use of your time and energy, you should know about the
conventions I use in this book.
When I want you to type something such as with a stupid grin, Martin
watched the tall blonde strut into the bar and order grappa, it’s in bold
letters. When I want you to type something that’s short and uncomplicated,
such as Jennifer, it still appears in boldface type.
Except for passwords, you don’t have to worry about the case of the
stuff you type in QuickBooks. If I tell you to type Jennifer, you can type
JENNIFER. Or you can follow poet e. e. cummings’ lead and type jennifer.
Whenever I tell you to choose a command from a menu, I say something like,
“Choose Lists➪Items,” which simply means to first choose the Lists menu
and then choose Items. The ➪separates one part of the command from the
next part.
You can choose menus and commands and select dialog box elements with
the mouse. Just click the thing you want to select.
While we’re on the subject of conventions, let me also mention something
about QuickBooks conventions because it turns out that there’s not really
any good place to point this out. QuickBooks doesn’t use document windows
the same way that other Windows programs do. Instead, it locks the active
window into place and then displays a list of windows in its Navigator pane,
which is like another little window. To move to a listed window, you click it.
You can tell QuickBooks to use windows like every other program does, how-
ever, by choosing View➪Multiple Windows. (I did this in chapters to make the
figures bigger and, therefore, easier for you to read.) You can even remove the
Navigators pane by choosing View➪Open Window List. (You can also move
the other locked pane, which lists windows and is called the Shortcuts List,
by choosing View➪Shortcut List.)
Special Icons
Like many computer books, this book uses icons, or little pictures, to flag
things that don’t quite fit into the flow of things:
6
QuickBooks 2004 For Dummies

Sometimes, I use made-up examples (along with examples from my own expe-
rience) to help you understand how some topic or area of QuickBooks helps
you and your business. Just my way of continuing the giving.
This icon is a friendly reminder to do something.
This icon points out nerdy technical material that you may want to skip 
(or read, if you’re feeling particularly bright).
Whee! Here’s a shortcut to make your life easier!
And this icon is a friendly reminder not to do something . . . or else.

In this part . . .
A
ll accounting programs — including QuickBooks —
make you do a bunch of preliminary stuff. Sure, this
is sort of a bummer. But getting depressed about it won’t
make things go any faster. So if you want to get up and go
with QuickBooks — and if you want to ﬁnd out about the
cool network features QuickBooks offers — peruse the
chapters in this ﬁrst part. I promise that I’ll get you
through this stuff as quickly as possible.

 Supplying the missing numbers
I
know that you’re eager to get started. You’ve got a business to run. But
before you can start using QuickBooks, you need to do some upfront work.
Specifically, you need to prepare for the QuickBooks EasyStep Interview, and
then you need to walk through the EasyStep Interview. (The EasyStep Interview
is just a thorough question-and-answer session that QuickBooks uses to set
itself up for you.) After you finish with the EasyStep Interview, you also proba-
bly need to fiddle with QuickBooks to get everything working just right. In this
chapter, I describe how you do all this stuff.
I assume that you know how Windows works. If you don’t, take the time to
read Chapter 1 of your Windows User’s Guide. Or try the appropriate edition
of Windows For Dummies by Andy Rathbone (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Getting Ready for the Big Interview
You need to complete three tasks to get ready for the EasyStep Interview:
 You need to make an important decision about your conversion date
(the date you convert from your old accounting system to QuickBooks).
 You need to prepare a trial balance as of the conversion date.
 You need to go on a scavenger hunt to collect a bunch of stuff that you’ll
need or find handy for the interview.

The big decision
Before you start fiddling with your computer or the QuickBooks software,
you need to choose the date — the so-called conversion date — on which you
want to begin using QuickBooks for your financial record keeping.
This decision is hugely important because the conversion date that you
choose dramatically affects both the work you have to do to get QuickBooks
running smoothly and the initial usefulness of the financial information that
you collect and record by using QuickBooks.
You’ve got three basic choices you can make:
 The right way: You can convert at the beginning of your accounting year
(which is almost certainly the same as the beginning of the calendar year).
This way is the right way for two reasons. First, converting at the begin-
ning of the year requires the least amount of work from you. Second, it
means that you have all the current year’s financial information in one
system.
 The slightly awkward way: You can convert at the beginning of some
interim accounting period (probably the beginning of some month or
quarter). This approach works, but it’s slightly awkward because you
have to plug your year-to-date income and expenses numbers from the
old system into the new system. (If you don’t know what an interim
accounting period is, read Appendix B.)
 The my-way-or-the-highway way: You can convert at some time other
than what I call the right way and the slightly awkward way. Specifically,
you can choose to convert whenever you jolly well feel like it. You create
a bunch of unnecessary work for yourself if you take this approach, and
you pull out a bunch of your hair in the process. But you also have the
satisfaction of knowing that through it all, you did it your way — without
any help from me. 
I recommend the right way. What this choice means is that if it’s late in the
year — say, October — I suggest that you just wait until January 1 of the next
year to convert. If it’s still early in the year, you can also retroactively convert
as of the beginning of the year. (If you do this, you need to go back and do
your financial record keeping for the first part of the current year by using
QuickBooks: entering sales, recording purchases, and so on.)
If it’s sometime in the middle of the year — say, Memorial Day or later — then
you probably want to use the slightly awkward way. (I’m actually going to use
the slightly awkward way in this chapter because if you see how to convert to
QuickBooks by using the slightly awkward way, you know how to use both
the right way and the slightly awkward way.)
12
Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 

The trial balance of the century
After you decide when you want to convert, you need a trial balance.
“Yikes,” you say. “What’s a trial balance?” A trial balance simply lists all 
your assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity account balances as well as the
year-to-date income and expense numbers on a specified date (which, not
coincidentally, happens to be the conversion date). You need this data for 
the EasyStep Interview and for some fiddling around that you need to do
after you complete the EasyStep Interview.
Creating a trial balance doesn’t have to be as hard as it sounds. If you’ve 
been using another small-business accounting system, such as Intuit’s simpler
Quicken product or Computer Associates’ Simply Accounting program, you
may be able to have your old system produce a trial balance on the conversion
date. In that case, you can get the balances from your old system. (Consider
yourself lucky if this is the case.)
If your old system is rather informal (perhaps it’s a shoebox full of receipts)
or if it tracks only cash (perhaps you’ve been using Quicken), you need to do
a bit more work:
 To get your cash balance, you need to reconcile your bank account or
bank accounts (if you have more than one bank account) as of the con-
version date.
 To get your accounts receivable balance, you need to tally up the total of
all your unpaid customer invoices.
 To get your other asset account balances, you need to know what each
asset originally cost. For depreciable fixed assets, you also need to pro-
vide any accumulated depreciation that has been claimed for that asset.
(Accumulated depreciation is the total depreciation that you’ve already
expensed for each asset.)
By the way, refer to Appendix B if you have questions about accounting
or accounting terminology, such as depreciation.
 To get your liability account balances, you need to know how much you
owe on each liability. If you trust your creditors — the people that you
owe the money to — you may also be able to get this information from
their statements.
You don’t need to worry about the owner’s equity accounts. QuickBooks can
calculate your owner’s equity account balances for you, based on the differ-
ence between your total assets and your total liabilities. This method is a bit
sloppy, and accountants may not like it, but it’s a pretty good compromise. (If
you do have detailed account balances for your owner’s equity accounts, use
these figures — and know that you’re one in a million.)
13
Chapter 1: The Big Interview

If you’re using the slightly awkward way to convert to QuickBooks — in other
words, if your conversion date is some date other than the beginning of the
accounting year — then you also need to provide year-to-date income and
expense balances. To get your income, cost of goods sold, expenses, other
income, and other expense account balances, you need to calculate the year-
to-date amount of each account. If you can get this information from your old
system, that’s super. If not, you need to get it manually. (If you suddenly have
images of yourself sitting at your desk, late at night, tapping away on a ten-
key, you’re probably right. What’s more, you probably also need to allocate
half of another Saturday to getting up and running with QuickBooks.)
Just for fun, I’ve created the sample trial balance shown in Table 1-1. This
table shows you what a trial balance looks like if you convert at some time
other than at the beginning of the accounting year.

Chapter 1: The Big Interview
About those debits and credits
Don’t get freaked out about those debits and
credits. You just need to keep them straight for
a few minutes. Here’s the scoop: For assets and
expenses, a debit balance is the same thing as
a positive balance. So a cash debit balance of
$5,000 means that you have $5,000 in your
account. And $20,000 of cost of goods sold
means that you incurred $20,000 of costs 
of goods expense. For assets and expenses, 
a credit balance is the same thing as a nega-
tive balance. So, if you have a cash balance 
of –$5,000, your account is overdrawn by $5,000.
In the sample trial balance shown in Table 1-1,
the accumulated depreciation shows a credit
balance of $2,000, which is, in effect, a negative
account balance.
For liabilities, owner’s equity accounts, and
income accounts, things are flip-flopped. A
credit balance is the same thing as a positive bal-
ance. So, an accounts payable credit balance of
$2,000 means that you owe your creditors $2,000.
A bank loan credit balance of $10,000 means that
you owe the bank $10,000. And a sales account
credit balance of $60,000 means that you’ve
enjoyed $60,000 of sales.
I know that I keep saying this, but do remember
that those income and expense account bal-
ances are year-to-date figures. They exist only
if the conversion date is after the start of the
financial year.

The mother of all scavenger hunts
Even after you’ve decided when you want to convert to QuickBooks and have
come up with a trial balance, you still need to collect a bunch of additional
information. I’m just going to list these items in laundry-list fashion. What
you want to do is find all this stuff and then pile it up (neatly) in a big stack
next to the computer.
 Last year’s federal tax return. QuickBooks asks which federal income
tax form you use to file your tax return and also about your taxpayer
identification number. Last year’s federal tax return is the easiest place
to find this stuff.
 Copies of your most recent state and federal payroll tax returns. If 
you prepare payroll for employees, QuickBooks wants to know about the
federal and state payroll tax rates you pay as well as some other stuff.
 Copies of all the unpaid invoices that your customers (or clients or
patients or whatever) owe you as of the conversion date. I guess this is
probably obvious, but the total accounts receivable balance shown on
your trial balance needs to match the total of the unpaid customer
invoices.
 Copies of all unpaid bills that you owe your vendors as of the conver-
sion date. Again, this is probably obvious, but the total accounts
payable balance shown on your trial balance needs to match the total of
the unpaid vendor bills.
 A detailed listing of any inventory items you’re holding for resale. This
list should include not only inventory item descriptions and quantities,
but also the initial purchase prices and the anticipated sales prices. In
other words, if you sell porcelain wombats and you’ve got 1,200 of these
beauties in inventory, you need to know exactly what you paid for them.
 Copies of the prior year’s W-2 statements, W-4 statements for anybody
you’ve hired since the beginning of the prior year, detailed informa-
tion about any payroll tax liabilities you owe as of the conversion
date, and detailed information about the payroll tax deposits you’ve
made since the beginning of the year. You need the information shown
on these forms to adequately and accurately set up the QuickBooks pay-
roll feature. I don’t want to scare you, but this is probably the most
tedious part of setting up QuickBooks.
 If you’re retroactively converting as of the beginning of the year, you
need a list of all the transactions that have occurred since the begin-
ning of the year: sales, purchases, payroll transactions, and every-
thing and anything else. If you do the right way conversion
retroactively, you need to reenter each of these transactions into the
16
Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 

new system. You actually enter the information after you complete the
EasyStep Interview that I describe later in this chapter. But you may as
well get all this information together now, while you’re searching for the
rest of the scavenger hunt items.
If you take the slightly awkward way, you don’t need to find the last item that
I described in the previous list. You can just use the year-to-date income and
expense numbers from the trial balance.
Doing the EasyStep Interview
After you decide when you want to convert, prepare a trial balance as of the
conversion date, and collect the additional raw data that you need, you’re
ready to step through the EasyStep Interview.
Before you begin the interview, you have to start QuickBooks 2004. To do
so, choose Start➪Programs and then click the menu choices that lead to
QuickBooks. (For example, I choose Start➪Programs➪QuickBooks Premier➪
QuickBooks Premier.)
QuickBooks comes in several flavors. The most common flavors are Quick
Books Basic, QuickBooks Pro, and QuickBooks Premier. These three programs
differ in several significant ways: QuickBooks Pro adds the advanced job-
costing and time-estimating features. It also includes the ability to share a
QuickBooks file over a network, as I describe in Chapter 3. QuickBooks
Premier adds features to QuickBooks Pro for accountants and auditors who
want to use QuickBooks for rather large small businesses. I used QuickBooks
Premier for writing this book, by the way, so the figures you see here may
look a wee bit different from what you see on-screen in one or two special
cases. But other than minor cosmetic differences, the three programs work
the same way.
If this is the first time you’ve started QuickBooks, QuickBooks displays a mes-
sage box that asks you how you want to start. For example, you can click a
button that indicates you want to open a sample data file. What I suggest 
you do, however, is jump right into the fray. If you’ve never used QuickBooks
before — the likely case if you’ve started your reading here — click the Set Up
a New Data File for a Company button, which starts the EasyStep Interview. 
(If you’ve already been using an earlier version of QuickBooks or Quicken, click
the buttons corresponding to these choices. QuickBooks then starts an abbre-
viated version of the EasyStep Interview.)
The real fun begins at this point. The EasyStep Interview starts automatically,
displaying the dialog box shown in Figure 1-1.
17
Chapter 1: The Big Interview

If you’re not starting QuickBooks for the first time but you want to step
through the EasyStep Interview to set up a new company anyway, choose
File➪New Company. Or, if you want to step through the interview for a com-
pany you’ve already set up (but perhaps set up incorrectly or incompletely),
choose File➪EasyStep Interview.
To begin the interview, click the Next button. The next page of dialog box
information asks whether you’re upgrading from a previous version of
Quicken or QuickBooks. You’re probably not (or you wouldn’t be reading this
chapter), so click the No, I’m Not Upgrading option and then continue with
the interview by clicking the Next button. Each time you finish a page of the
interview, click the Next button to continue.
After QuickBooks starts, you may also see a message box that asks whether
you want to register QuickBooks. You can use the product roughly a couple
dozen times and then — whammo — either you register it or you can’t use 
it. I don’t like being forced to do something, but getting worked up about
having to register QuickBooks is a waste of time. The simplest option is to
just register. Here’s how: When QuickBooks displays the message box that
asks whether you want to register, click Online to register online or Phone to
register over the phone. If you go with the phone option, QuickBooks dis-
plays another dialog box that gives you a telephone number to call and pro-
vides a space for you to enter your registration number.
I’m not going to provide you with a blow-by-blow account of what happens
when you take the interview. A much better approach is for me to provide
you with a handful of key tips that you can read now and then use later
(during the interview) to make the process as easy and as fast as possible.
Figure 1-1:
The
EasyStep
Interview
dialog box.
18
Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 

Tip 1: Learn the interview protocol
For the most part, to complete the EasyStep Interview, all you do is fill in text
boxes with the information that QuickBooks requests (see Figure 1-2) or
answer questions by clicking buttons clearly marked Yes or No.
If you ever decide that you want to change some piece of information that
you’ve entered on a previous page of the EasyStep Interview dialog box, you
can just click the Prev button to back up. If you get partway through the inter-
view process and decide that it’s not worth the time, just click the Leave
button in the lower-right corner, and QuickBooks closes the EasyStep Interview
dialog box. If, after leaving the interview, you realize that you’ve made a mis-
take, all you have to do is choose File➪EasyStep Interview and then use the
tabs shown in Figure 1-2 to go back and change something you entered.
Here are a few extra notes that may come in handy:
 The EasyStep Interview dialog box appears every time you start a new
company (which you do by choosing File➪New Company).
 When you click the tabs on the right side of the EasyStep Interview
dialog box, the tabs at the top change accordingly. This change comes in
handy when you’re leafing through the 60 or 70 pages of information
that appear in the EasyStep Interview dialog box.
 QuickBooks purposely makes it difficult to delete a company you create
in QuickBooks, so don’t make up an imaginary company to play with
unless you’re familiar enough with your operating system to delete files.

Tip 2: Take your time
As you step through the interview process, the EasyStep Interview dialog box
displays a bunch of different pages with suggestions, instructions, and advice.
Take the time to read this information. Click the Help button if you have ques-
tions. If the EasyStep Interview suggests that you view some related document
with helpful information, do so.
Tip 3: Get industry-specific advice
Industry-specific advice is one of the handiest QuickBooks features. For
example, are you a rancher or a farmer? QuickBooks includes a detailed
online document that describes some of the unique accounting challenges
your business faces, provides tips for making your record keeping easier, and
points out QuickBooks features that may be of particular interest to someone
like you. Are you a retailer? A manufacturer? A writer? A consultant? You can
get this same sort of information, too.
QuickBooks displays industry-specific tips and tidbits of information
throughout the interview. Keep your eyes peeled for the green arrows that
mark these little hints. Let me mention one other quick pointer about this
industry-specific information stuff: You may not understand everything you
read. That’s okay. You still want to read the tips and maybe jot them down on
a piece of paper as you go along. As you work with QuickBooks and find out
more about it, you’ll find that more and more of the information provided in
the industry-specific tips makes sense.
To view a document of industry-specific information at any time, click
Support on the Navigation bar and click the Industry-Specific Information
hyperlink. Click the List of Industries hyperlink and then select your industry
from the list in the Help window that QuickBooks displays. To print a copy of
the information, click the Options button and choose Print Topic from the
drop-down menu.
Some of the hyperlinks lead to resources at the www.quickbooks.com Web
site, so you may be prompted to make an Internet connection to access that
information.
Tip 4: Accept the suggested 
filename and location
A few minutes into the EasyStep Interview, QuickBooks asks you to specify a
name and location for the file that it uses to store your accounting information
20
Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 

(see Figure 1-3). This will normally be your company name, anyway. I can think
of no good reason why you need to fiddle with or change the suggested file-
name or location. Don’t do it. Let QuickBooks name the QuickBooks file
whatever it wants and let QuickBooks store the file wherever it wants.
Tip 5: Go with the suggested 
chart of accounts
Immediately after you name the file that QuickBooks uses for storing your
financial information, the EasyStep Interview displays a dialog box that shows
a list of accounts that QuickBooks wants to use for tracking your business’s
financial condition. This dialog box also asks whether the list of accounts is
the one that you want to use. Unless you know quite a bit about accounting
and are willing to learn just as much about QuickBooks, I recommend that you
accept the suggested chart of accounts. You make your future record keeping
much easier by doing so.
Tip 6: Consider tracking all your 
expenses with your checkbook
You get two choices regarding how to record your expenses:
 By using just your checkbook
 By creating a bills-to-pay list
Figure 1-3:

doing so.

Chapter 1: The Big Interview

QuickBooks asks this question in the dialog box page shown in Figure 1-4. I
want to be careful about what I say next because the decision you make in
this dialog box can really screw up your business. But here’s my suggestion: I
think that you should consider taking the first option — the one that says
you want to record bills by using your checkbook. You choose the first
option, which I’m hesitantly recommending here, by clicking the Enter the
Checks Directly option button.
Now before you rush off to the next EasyStep Interview question, confident
and happy in my suggestion, let me tell you about the implicit trade-off you’re
making. If you choose the Enter the Checks Directly option, you do simplify
your record keeping — which is why I suggest that you take this route. But the
catch is that you can’t track your unpaid bills as closely. Until you sit down to
actually write checks for your bills, you don’t really know (precisely) how
much money you owe vendors. What’s more, you can’t separate the actual
incurring of some expense from the cash outflow that pays the expense. So, by
taking the Enter the Checks Directly option, you’re unable to do finely tuned
accrual-basis accounting (unless you pay bills when you incur them). And you
aren’t able to closely monitor the money that you owe to vendors.
In my business, I do use the Enter the Checks Directly option. I do so to sim-
plify my record keeping. But I’m probably a little unusual (at least for a small
business) for a couple of reasons. First, almost all my expenses get negotiated
upfront and then get fixed by contract. (With the help of other writers and 
a team of editors and desktop publishers, I write and package books and tech-
nical reference materials.) For this reason, I don’t use and don’t need to use
QuickBooks to keep track of and remind me about my unpaid bills. In effect,
the negotiations and contracts do that.
Second, I’ve actually been in business for quite a while — more than 15 
years, in fact. So I don’t have the cash flow problems that many (most?) small
Figure 1-4:
Simplify
your bill
paying by
choosing to
record bills
when you
write
checks.
22
Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 

businesses have, which means that if I want to produce an accurate profit
and loss statement or an accurate balance sheet — one that includes all my
expenses — I can just pay all my unpaid bills.
I guess the bottom line here is this: If you don’t need to use QuickBooks to
closely monitor your unpaid bills and if you don’t mind the profit-calculation
precision that you lose because of the lag between the time you incur some
expense and the time you pay the bill by writing a check, go ahead and use
the Enter the Checks Directly option. This choice greatly simplifies one area
of your record keeping. Otherwise, go with the second option. (To choose the
second option, mark Enter the Bills First and Then Enter the Payments Later,
as shown in Figure 1-4.)
Tip 7: Add accounts you need
As you step through the interview’s questions, QuickBooks asks a few times
whether you want to add an account (see Figure 1-5). Go ahead and do this —
and feel comfortable doing so. Adding accounts isn’t hard. (You need an
account for each individual asset, liability, income, or expense amount you
want to track.)
Tip 8: Provide inventory, customer, vendor,
and other financial information
The last part of the EasyStep Interview asks you to describe in detail your
inventory, your customer receivables, your vendor payables, and most
(maybe all) of the other business assets and business liabilities that your
firm owns or owes.
Figure 1-5:

23
Chapter 1: The Big Interview

Provide this information in detail, and be very careful so that what you enter
is correct and makes sense. If your current accounting system doesn’t pro-
vide this data or seems rifled with errors and inconsistencies, you want to
clean up your financial records before you enter this information into
QuickBooks.
The Rest of the Story
Throughout the preceding sections in this chapter, I describe how you prepare
for and then step through the EasyStep Interview. But even after the EasyStep
Interview is over, you probably need to take care of two other little jobs:
 If you want to use accrual-basis accounting, you need to make an
adjustment.
 You need to describe your current business finances.
These chores aren’t time-consuming, but they are the two most complicated
tasks that you need to do to set up QuickBooks. (If you’re not sure what the
big deal is about accrual-basis accounting, I respectfully suggest that you
take a break here and read Appendix B.)
Should you get your accountant’s help?
Oh, shoot. I don’t know. If you follow my directions carefully and your busi-
ness’s financial affairs aren’t wildly complex, I think that you can probably
figure out all this stuff on your own.
Having said that, however, I suggest that you at least think about getting your
accountant’s help at this juncture. Your accountant can do a much better job 
of giving you advice that may be specific to your situation. In many cases, your
accountant can give you your beginning trial balance amounts that agree with
your tax returns. The accountant probably knows your business and can keep
you from making a terrible mess of things, just in case you don’t follow my
directions carefully.
By the way, if you do call upon your accountant to help you with the tasks 
in this chapter, bookmark the page with the sidebar “For accountants only”
(elsewhere in this chapter) and ask your financial wizard to read it. The side-
bar summarizes what you’ve accomplished thus far. (If you’re going to do all
this stuff yourself, reading the sidebar isn’t a bad idea.)
Just so you know, one of the things that, as a CPA, I do for my clients is help
them set up QuickBooks. Because I do this, I can give you a couple of pieces
of useful information about getting a CPA’s help in setting up. First, your CPA,
24
Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 

assuming he or she already knows QuickBooks, should be able to help you
through the setup process in a couple of hours. So, your CPA will do it (or
help you do it) much faster than you can on your own. Second, an hour or so
of tutoring from your CPA should mean that you get enough help to record all
your usual transactions. With just this help, you can find out how to pay your
bills, how to invoice customers exactly the way you want, and how to pro-
duce reports. I used to pooh-pooh this kind of hand-holding, but the older
(and hopefully wiser) I get, the more I see that business owners and book-
keepers benefit from this upfront help. A bit of planning and expert advice in
the beginning can save you a whole lot of trouble later on.
Adjusting for accrual-basis accounting
If you want to use accrual-basis accounting — and I recommend that you do —
you need to camouflage a couple of goofy accounts, called suspense accounts,
that QuickBooks creates when you set up the Item, Customer, and Vendor lists.
(Accrual-basis accounting more accurately measures your profits and financial
condition by using a handful of accounting tricks, so you really do want to use
accrual-basis account. Check out Appendix B for more information.)
Figure 1-6 shows a sample trial balance after I’ve entered the inventory,
accounts receivable, and accounts payable balances. (These account balances
get set up indirectly, as noted in the nearby sidebar containing information
for accountants. When you set up your Item, Customer, and Vendor lists, you
also create account balances for inventory, accounts receivable, and
accounts payable.)
You can produce your own half-complete trial balance from inside QuickBooks
by choosing Reports➪Accountants & Taxes➪Trial Balance. QuickBooks
displays the trial balance report in a document window.
If you need to do so, enter the conversion date in the As Of box by clicking
the box and typing the conversion date in MM/DD/YYYY fashion. Figure 1-6,
for example, shows the conversion date 8/31/2004 in the As Of box. You can
set the From box to any value. The From to To range just needs to end with
the conversion date. Make a note of the credit and debit balances shown for
the Uncategorized Income and Uncategorized Expenses accounts.
Note: To make the figures bigger and therefore easier to read, I’m just show-
ing the actual report window in which the trial balance report appears. Your
on-screen windows will look a little different from this — unless you choose
the View➪Multiple Windows command (which is what I’ve done).
If you want, you can print the report by clicking the Print button and then,
when QuickBooks displays the Print Report dialog box, by clicking its Print
button. Yes, you click two Print buttons.
25
Chapter 1: The Big Interview

After you have the conversion date balances for the Uncategorized Income
and Uncategorized Expenses accounts, you’re ready to make the accrual
accounting adjustment. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Choose Lists➪Chart of Accounts to display that window.
QuickBooks displays the Chart of Accounts window, shown in Figure 1-7.
2. Double-click Opening Bal Equity in the Chart of Accounts list to dis-
play that account.
Opening Bal Equity is listed after the liability accounts. QuickBooks dis-
plays the register — just a list of transactions — for the account named
Opening Bal Equity. Figure 1-8, coincidentally, shows this register.
3. Select the next empty row of the register if it isn’t already selected
(although it probably is).
You can select a row by clicking it, or you can use the up- or down-arrow
key to move to the next empty row.
4. Type the conversion date in the Date field.
Move the cursor to the Date field (if it isn’t already there) and type the
date. Use the MM/DD/YYYY format. For example, you can type either
08312004 or 8/31/2004 to enter August 31, 2004.

Chapter 1: The Big Interview

5. Type the Uncategorized Income account balance (from the trial balance
report) in the Increase field.
In Figure 1-6, for example, the Uncategorized Income account balance is
$190,000. In this case, click the Increase field and type 190000 in the
field. (You don’t need to include the dollar sign or the comma;
QuickBooks adds the punctuation for you.)
6. Type Uncategorized Income (the account name) in the Account field.
Select the Account field, which is on the row under the word Payee, and
begin typing Uncategorized Income, the account name. As soon as you
type enough of the name for QuickBooks to figure out what you’re
typing, it fills in the rest of the name for you. When this happens, you
can stop typing.
7. Click the Record button to record the Uncategorized Income adjust-
ment transaction.
8. Again, select the next empty row of the register.
Click the row or use the up- or down-arrow key.
9. Type the conversion date in the Date field.
Move the cursor to the Date field (if it isn’t already there) and type the
date. You use the MM/DD/YYYY format. You can type 8/31/2004, for
example, to enter August 31, 2004.
10. Type the Uncategorized Expenses account balance in the Decrease
field.
In Figure 1-6, for example, the Uncategorized Expenses account balance
is $75,000. In this case, you click the Decrease field and then type 75000
in the field. I’ve said this before, but I’ll say it again because you’re just
starting out: You don’t need to include any punctuation, such as a dollar
sign or comma.
11. Type Uncategorized Expenses (the account name) in the Account field.
Select the Account field, which is on the second line of the register
transaction, and begin typing Uncategorized Expenses, the account
name. As soon as you type enough of the name for QuickBooks to figure
out what you’re typing, it fills in the rest of the name for you.
12. Click the Record button to record the Uncategorized Expenses
adjustment transaction.
Figure 1-9 shows the Opening Bal Equity register with the correction
transactions. The correction transactions are numbered with a 5 and a 6.
See them? They’re at the bottom of the register.
28
Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 

You can close the Opening Bal Equity register, too, at this point. You’re fin-
ished with it. (One way to close it is to click the Close button — this is the
little button with an X in the upper-right corner of the register window.)
You can check your work thus far — and checking it is a good idea — by pro-
ducing another copy of the trial balance report. What you want to check are
the Uncategorized Income and Uncategorized Expenses account balances.
They should both be zero — as shown in Figure 1-10.
You can produce a trial balance by choosing Reports➪Accountant & Taxes➪
Trial Balance. QuickBooks displays the trial balance report in a document
window. If you need to enter the conversion date in the As Of box, click the
box and type the conversion date in MM/DD/YYYY fashion into the box.
If the Uncategorized Income and the Uncategorized Expenses account bal-
ances don’t show zero, you (with my help, of course) may have botched 
the accrual adjustment. To fix the mistake, redisplay the Opening Bal Equity
register, select the adjustment transactions, and then check the account,
amount, and field (increase or decrease). If one of the fields is wrong, select
the field and replace its contents by typing over them.

Chapter 1: The Big Interview

Supplying the missing numbers
You’re almost done. Really. Your last task is to enter the rest of the trial bal-
ance into QuickBooks. To perform this task, of course, you need to already
have a trial balance as of the conversion date. But you should have one. (I
talk about this earlier in the chapter in the section, “The trial balance of the
century.”) Follow these steps:
1. Display the General Journal Entry window.
Choose the Company➪Make Journal Entries command. QuickBooks dis-
plays the Make General Journal Entries window, shown in Figure 1-11.
2. Type the conversion date in the Date field.
Move the cursor to the Date field (if it isn’t already there) and type the
date. As you may know by now, you use the MM/DD/YYYY format. For
example, type 10/31/2004 for October 31, 2004. (Or 10312004, if you
don’t want to put the slashes in.)
Figure 1-10:

30
Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 

3. Type each trial balance account and balance that isn’t already in the
half-completed trial balance.
Okay. This step sounds confusing. But remember that you’ve already
entered your cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts
payable account balances, as well as most other liability account bal-
ances and a portion of the Opening Bal Equity account balance as part
of the EasyStep Interview.
So what you need to do now is enter the rest of the trial balance: specifi-
cally, the year-to-date income and expense account balances and the
remaining portion of the Opening Bal Equity. To enter each account and
balance, use a row of the Make General Journal Entries window’s list
box. Figure 1-12 shows how this window looks after you enter the rest of
the trial balance into the list box rows.
4. Click Save & New to record the general journal entries that set up the
rest of your trial balance.

Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 
For accountants only
If you’re reading this sidebar, I assume that
you’re an accountant who’s been asked to help
your client with the last piece of the QuickBooks
conversion. Of course, you understand double-
entry bookkeeping, and presumably you’re
familiar with the general mechanics involved in
converting to new accounting systems. With
those two caveats, you’re ready to start.
First, your client has probably already installed
QuickBooks and then, by running something
called the EasyStep Interview, partially set up a
chart of accounts and loaded three master files:
the Item list, the Customer list, and the Vendor
list. The Item list master file describes the inven-
tory account balances. (QuickBooks uses an
average costing assumption.) The Customer list
master file describes the accounts receivable
balances. The Vendor list master file describes
the accounts payable balances. Because your
client has set up these master files, QuickBooks
has made three journal entries, which I
describe in the following paragraphs. (I’m using
Xs to represent numbers, in case you’re not
familiar with this convention.)
To set up the conversion date inventory balance
(if inventory exists), QuickBooks has created the
following entry:
Debit
Credit
Inventory Asset
$X,XXX
Opening Bal Equity
$X,XXX
To set up the conversion date accounts receiv-
able (A/R) balance (if A/R exists), QuickBooks
has created the following entry:
Debit
Credit
Accounts Receivable
$X,XXX
Uncategorized Income
$X,XXX
To set up the conversion date accounts payable
(A/P) balance (if A/P exists), QuickBooks has
created the following entry:
Debit
Credit
Accounts Payable
$X,XXX
Uncategorized Expenses
$X,XXX
To complete the picture, you need to do two little
housekeeping chores. If your client plans to use
accrual-basis accounting, you need to get rid of
the credit to the Uncategorized Income account
and the debit to the Uncategorized Expenses
account. (These two accounts are really just
suspense accounts.) And you need to load the
rest of the trial balance. I describe the steps 
for accomplishing these tasks in the section
“Supplying the missing numbers,” elsewhere in
this chapter.
Checking your work one more time
Checking your work again is a good idea. Produce another copy of
the trial balance report, as shown in Figure 1-13. Check that the
QuickBooks trial balance is the same one that you wanted to enter.

Chapter 1: The Big Interview

Remember that you can produce a trial balance by choosing Reports➪
Accountant & Taxes➪Trial Balance. Be sure to enter the conversion date in
the As Of box. If the QuickBooks trial balance report agrees with what your
records show, you’re finished.
If the QuickBooks trial balance doesn’t agree with what your records show,
you need to fix the problem. Fixing it is a bit awkward but not complicated.
Choose Reports➪Accountant & Taxes➪Journal. QuickBooks displays a report
or journal that lists all the transactions that you or QuickBooks has entered
as part of setting up. (The Dates, From, and To text boxes need to specify the
conversion date.) Scroll through the list of transactions until you get to the
last one. The last transaction is the one that you entered to set up the rest of
the trial balance, and it names recognizable accounts and uses familiar debit
and credit amounts. Double-click this transaction. QuickBooks redisplays the
Make General Journal Entries window with the botched transaction. Find the
mistake and then fix the erroneous account or amount by clicking it and
typing the correct account or amount.
Congratulations! You’re done.

I
f you’ve just finished going through the EasyStep Interview (see Chapter 1),
don’t look at the title of this chapter and think to yourself that you’re
ready to throw in the towel because you’re sick and tired of creating lists. As
a matter of fact, if you’ve just finished the EasyStep Interview and carefully
entered the names of all your products, employees, customers, and vendors
into lists, you can kick up your heels and relax because you probably don’t
even need to read this chapter just yet. The lists that you need are already
set up. But as time goes by, I bet you’ll find that your lists need updating. You
will get new customers and begin working with new vendors. You may even
hire a new employee. In this chapter, I describe how you add to the lists that
you’ve created in the EasyStep Interview.
I recommend that you periodically check your trial balance, especially 
after you (or someone else!) add to your lists, to make sure that you haven’t
created uncategorized transactions by entering balances for inventory items,
customers, or vendors. You can produce a trial balance by choosing Reports➪
Accountant & Taxes➪Trial Balance.
The Magic and Mystery of Items
Before you start adding to your Item list, I need to tell you that QuickBooks
isn’t very smart about its view of what you sell. It thinks that anything you
stick on a sales invoice or a purchase order is something you’re selling.

If you sell blue, yellow, and red coffee mugs, for example, you probably figure
(and correctly so) that you need to add descriptions of each of these items to
the Item list: blue mug, yellow mug, and red mug. But if you add freight charges
to an invoice, QuickBooks thinks that you’re adding another mug. And if you
add sales tax to an invoice, well, guess what? QuickBooks again thinks that
you’re adding another mug.
This wacky definition of items is confusing at first. But just remember one
thing and you’ll be okay: You aren’t the one who’s stupid. QuickBooks is. No,
I’m not saying that QuickBooks is a bad program. It’s a wonderful accounting
program and a great tool. What I’m saying is that QuickBooks is only a dumb
computer program. It’s not an artificial intelligence program. It doesn’t pick
up on the little subtleties of business — such as the fact that, even though
you charge customers for freight, you’re not really in the shipping business.
Each entry on the invoice or purchase order — the mugs you sell, the subto-
tal, the discount, the freight charges, and the sales tax — is an item. Yes, I
know. This setup is weird. But getting used to the wackiness now makes the
discussions that follow much easier to understand.
If you want to see a sample invoice, take a peek at Figure 2-1. See those first two
items: Blue mugs and Red mugs? You can see the sense of calling them items,
right? These mugs are things you sell. But then suppose that you give frequent
buyers of your merchandize a 10-percent discount. In order to include this dis-
count in your accounting, you need to add a Subtotal item to tally the sale and
then a Discount item to calculate the discount. Figure 2-1 also shows this. See
it? Kind of weird, eh? And then look at the Shipping item — which charges the
customer $50 for freight. Yep, that’s right: another item. In sum, everything that
appears on an invoice or a purchase is an item that needs to be described in
your Item list.
I describe creating invoices in Chapter 4 and creating purchase orders in
Chapter 7.
Adding items you may include on invoices
To add invoice or purchase order items to the Item list, follow these steps:
1. Choose Lists➪Item List.
QuickBooks, with restrained but obvious enthusiasm, displays the Item
List window, shown in Figure 2-2.
2. Click the Item button at the bottom of the Item List window and
choose New from the drop-down menu.
QuickBooks displays the New Item window, shown in Figure 2-3.

Chapter 2: Lots of Lists

3. Categorize the item.
Select an item type from the Type drop-down list box. The Item list that
you see is dependent on the type of business you told QuickBooks you
were in when you set up the program, so use the following as a sample —
the amount and type of items you need depend on the business you’re in.
Select one of the following item types by clicking the name in the list:
• Service: Select this type if you charge for a service — such as an
hour of labor or a repair job.
• Inventory Part: Select this type if what you sell is something that
you buy from someone else — and you want to track your holdings
of the item. If you sell thingamajigs that you purchase from the
manufacturer Thingamajigs Amalgamated, for example, you specify
the item type as Inventory Part. (For more information on using
QuickBooks to track inventory, see Chapter 7.)
• Inventory Assembly: Select this type if what you sell is something
that you make. In other words, if you buy raw materials or other
components and then assemble these things to create your fin-
ished product, the finished product is an Inventory Assembly item.
• Non-Inventory Part: Select this type if what you sell is something
that you don’t want to track as inventory. (You usually don’t use
this item type for products that you sell, by the way. Instead, you
use it for items that you buy for the business and need to include
on purchase orders.)
Figure 2-3:
The
QuickBooks
New Item
window.
38
Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 

• Other Charge: Select this item type for things such as freight and
handling charges that you include on invoices.
• Subtotal: This item type adds everything before you subtract any
discount, add the sales tax, and so on.
• Group: Use this item type to enter a bunch of items (which are
already on the list) at one time. This item is a nice timesaver. For
example, if you commonly sell sets of items, you don’t have to
specify those items individually every time you write an invoice.
• Discount: This item type calculates an amount to be subtracted
from a subtotal.
• Payment: This option is wacky, but if your invoice sometimes
includes an entry that reduces the invoice total — customer
deposits, for example — select this item type. If you’re confused by
this item type, just ignore it.
• Sales Tax Item: Select this item type for the sales tax that you
include on the invoice.
• Sales Tax Group: This item type is similar to the Group item type,
but you use it only for sales taxes that are collected in one transac-
tion and owed to multiple agencies.
4. Type an item number or name.
Press the Tab key or use your mouse to click the Item Name/Number
text box beneath the Type drop-down list box. Then type a short
description of the item.
5. (Optional) Make the item a subitem.
If you want to work with subitems — items that appear within other
items — check the Subitem Of check box and use the corresponding
drop-down list box to specify the parent item to which a subitem
belongs.
If you set up a parent item for coffee mugs and subitems for blue, yellow,
and red mugs, for example, you can produce reports that show parent
items (such as mugs) and subitems (such as the differently colored
mugs). Subitems are just an extra complexity, so if you’re new to this
QuickBooks stuff, I suggest that you keep things simple by avoiding them.
6. Describe the item in more detail.
Move the cursor to the Description text box and type a description. This
description then appears on the invoice. Note that if you specified the
item type as Inventory Part in Step 3, you see two description text
boxes: Description on Purchase Transactions and Description on Sales
Transactions. The purchase description appears on purchase orders,
and the sales description appears on sales invoices.
39
Chapter 2: Lots of Lists

7. If the item type is Service, Non-Inventory Part, or Other Charge, tell
QuickBooks how much to charge for the item, whether the item is sub-
ject to sales tax, and which income account to use for tracking the
income that you receive from selling the item.
• For a Service type, use the Rate text box to specify the price you
charge for one unit of the service. If you charge by the hour, for
example, the rate is the charge for an hour of service. If you charge
for a job — such as a repair job or the completion of a specific 
task — the rate is the charge for the job or task.
• For a Non-Inventory Part type, use the Price text box to specify the
amount you charge for the item.
• For an Other Charge type, use the Amount or % text box, which
replaces the Rate text box, to specify the amount you charge for the
item. You can type an amount, such as 20 for $20.00, or you can type
a percentage. If you type a percentage, QuickBooks calculates the
Other Charge Amount as the percentage multiplied by the preceding
item shown on the invoice. (You usually put in an Other Charge after
using a Subtotal item — something I talk about in the “Creating other
wacky items for invoices” section, later in this chapter.)
• For all three types, use the Taxable check box to indicate whether
the item is taxed. (Note that the Taxable check box appears only if
you told QuickBooks in the EasyStep Interview that you charge
customers sales tax.)
• For all three types, use the Account drop-down list to specify
which income account you want to use to track the income that
you receive from the sale of this item.
8. If the item type is Inventory Part, tell QuickBooks how much to
charge for the inventory part, how much the inventory part costs, and
which income account to use for tracking the product sales income.
For an Inventory Part item type, QuickBooks displays the New Item
window, as shown in Figure 2-4.
You use the extra fields that this special version of the window displays
to record the following information:
• Description on Purchase Transactions: Describe the part. This
description appears on the documents (such as purchase orders)
used when you buy items for your inventory.
• Cost: Specify the average cost per unit of the items you currently
have. This field acts as the default rate when you enter the item on
a purchase transaction.
• COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) Account: Specify the account that you
want QuickBooks to use for tracking this item’s cost when you sell
it. (QuickBooks suggests the Cost of Goods Sold account. If you’ve
created other accounts for your COGS, select the appropriate
account.)

Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 

• Preferred Vendor: Specify your first choice when ordering the
item for your business. (If the vendor isn’t on your Vendor list,
QuickBooks asks you to add it. If you say, “Yeah, I do want to add
it,” QuickBooks displays the Add Vendor window, which you can
then use to describe the vendor.)
• Description on Sales Transactions: Type in a description of the
item that you want to appear on documents, such as invoices and
so on, that your customers see. (QuickBooks suggests the same
description you used in the Description on Purchase Transactions
text box as a default.)
• Sales Price: Enter the amount that you charge for the item.
• Tax Code: Indicate whether the item is taxed.
• Income Account: Specify the account that you want QuickBooks to
use for tracking the income from the sale of the part. This is proba-
bly the Resale Income or Sales account. You typically use the
Resale Income account to track wholesale (nontaxable) sales and
the Sales account to track retail (taxable) sales.
• Asset Account: Specify the other current asset account that you
want QuickBooks to use for tracking this Inventory item’s value.

Chapter 2: Lots of Lists

• Reorder Point: Specify the lowest inventory quantity of this item
that can remain before you order more. When the inventory level
drops to this quantity, QuickBooks adds a Reminder to the
Reminders list, notifying you that you need to reorder the item. (To
see the Reminders list, choose Lists➪Reminders.)
• On Hand: Leave this field at zero. If you enter a number now, you’ll
record an uncategorized transaction, and you don’t want to do that.
• Total Value: Leave this field at zero, too.
• As Of: Enter the current date.
9. If the item type is Inventory Assembly, tell QuickBooks which cost of
goods sold and income account to use for tracking the item, how much
to charge for the inventory assembly, and how to build the item from
other component inventory items.
For an Inventory Assembly item type, QuickBooks displays the New Item
window, shown in Figure 2-5.

Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 

You use the extra fields that this special version of the window displays
to record the following information:
• COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) Account: Specify the account that you
want QuickBooks to use for tracking this item’s cost when you sell
it. (QuickBooks suggests the Cost of Goods Sold account. If you’ve
created other accounts for your COGS, select the appropriate
account.)
• Description: Type in a description of the item that you want to
appear on documents, such as invoices and so on, that your cus-
tomers see. 
• Sales Price: Enter the amount that you charge for the item.
• Tax Code: Indicate whether the item is taxed.
• Income Account: Specify the account that you want QuickBooks to
use for tracking the income from the sale of the part. This is proba-
bly the Resale Income or Sales account. You typically use the
Resale Income account to track wholesale (nontaxable) sales and
the Sales account to track retail (taxable) sales.
• Components Needed: Use the Components Needed list box to
identify the component items and the quantities needed to make
the inventory assembly.
• Asset Account: Specify the other current asset account that you
want QuickBooks to use for tracking this inventory item’s value.
• Build Point: Specify the lowest inventory quantity of this item that
can remain before you manufacture more. When the inventory
level drops to this quantity, QuickBooks adds a Reminder to the
Reminders list, notifying you that you need to make more of the
item.
• On Hand: Leave this field at zero. If you enter a number now, you’ll
record an uncategorized transaction, and you don’t want to do
that.
• Total Value: Leave this field at zero, too.
• As Of: Enter the current date.
10. If the item type is Sales Tax Item, tell QuickBooks what sales tax rate
to charge and what government agency to pay.
Note: The Sales Tax Item version of the New Item window looks a little
different than the window shown in Figure 2-5.
If the item type is Sales Tax Item, you need to tell QuickBooks what the
sales tax rate is and which government agency you remit sales taxes to.
43
Chapter 2: Lots of Lists

But this is straightforward stuff. Enter the sales tax rate into the appro-
priate box and the state (or city or whatever tax agency name) into the
appropriate box.
• Tax Name and Description: Specify further details for later
identification.
• Tax Rate: Specify the sales tax rate as a percentage.
• Tax Agency: Name the state or local tax agency that collects all the
loot you remit. If the tax agency isn’t on the list, you can add it by
picking Add New from the drop-down list box.
11. If the item type is Payment, describe the payment method and how
you want QuickBooks to handle the payment.
Note: The Payment Item version of the New Item window looks a little
different from the window shown in Figure 2-5.
Use the Payment Method drop-down list to specify the method of pay-
ment for a Payment item. QuickBooks provides a starting list of several
of the usual payment methods. You can easily add more payment types
by choosing Add New from the drop-down list box. When you choose
this entry, QuickBooks displays the New Payment Method dialog box. In
the dialog box’s only text box, identify the payment method: cows,
beads, shells, or some other what-have-you.
When you’re finished, use the area in the lower-left corner of the New
Item window to either group the payment with other undeposited funds
or, if you use the drop-down list box, deposit the payment to a specific
account.
12. Click OK or Next when you’re finished.
When you finish describing one item, click OK to add the item to the list
and return to the Item List window. Click Next to add the item to the list
and keep the New Item window on-screen so that you can add more items.
13. If you added a new Inventory item, record the purchase of the item.
After you’ve finished describing any new inventory items, you need to
make another transaction in order to categorize the purchase of the
items (unless they just showed up one morning on your doorstep). For
an explanation of these transactions, turn to Chapter 7.
Creating other wacky items for invoices
In the preceding section, I don’t describe all the items that you can add. For
example, you can create a Subtotal item to calculate the subtotal of the items
you list on an invoice. (You usually need this subtotal when you want to cal-
culate a sales tax on the invoice’s items.) You may want to create other
wacky items for your invoices as well, such as discounts. I describe these
special types of items in the next few sections.
44
Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 

Creating Subtotal items to stick subtotals on invoices
You need to add a Subtotal item if you ever want to apply a discount to a
series of items on an invoice. To add a Subtotal item to your Item list, choose
Lists➪Item List, click the Item button, and choose New from the drop-down
menu. This displays the New Item window — the same one you’ve seen sev-
eral times already in this chapter. Specify the item type as Subtotal and then
provide an item name (such as “Subtotal”).
When you want to subtotal items on an invoice, all you do is stick this Subtotal
item on the invoice after the items you want to subtotal. Keep in mind, though,
that QuickBooks doesn’t set up a subtotal feature automatically — you have to
add a Subtotal item; otherwise, you can only apply a Discount item that you
create to the single item that immediately precedes the discount. A Discount
item, by the way, calculates a discount on an invoice.
Creating Group items to batch stuff you sell together
You can create an item that puts one line on an invoice that’s actually a com-
bination of several other items. To add a group item, display the New Item
window and specify the item type as Group. QuickBooks displays the New
Item window shown in Figure 2-6.
Figure 2-6:
The
QuickBooks
New Item
Window

Chapter 2: Lots of Lists

If you purchase two items — blue mugs and red mugs — but sometimes sell
the items together in a set, for example, you can create an item that groups
the two items. Note that when you create a group, you continue to track the
group member inventories individually and don’t track the inventory of the
group as a new item.
In the New Item window, use the Item/Description/Qty list box to list each item
included in the group. When you click an item line in the Item/Description/Qty
list box, QuickBooks places a downward-pointing arrow at the right end of
the Item column. You click this arrow to open a drop-down list of items. (If
the list is longer than can be shown, you can use the scroll bar on the right to
move up and down the list.) If you click the Print Items in Group check box,
QuickBooks lists all the items in the group on invoices. (In the case of the
mugs, invoices list the individual blue and red mugs instead of just listing the
group name, such as “mug set.”)
Creating Discount items to add discounts to invoices
You can create an item that calculates a discount and sticks the discount on
an invoice as another line item. To add a Discount item to the list, display the
New Item window, specify the item type as Discount, and provide an item
name or number and a description.
Use the Amount or % text box to specify how the discount is calculated. If the
discount is a set amount (such as $50.00), type the amount. If the discount is
calculated as a percentage, enter the percentage, including the percent
symbol. When you enter a percentage, QuickBooks calculates the discount
amount as the percentage multiplied by the preceding item shown on the
invoice. (If you want to apply the discount to a group of items, you need to
use a Subtotal item and follow it with the discount.)
Back in Figure 2-1, I showed an invoice that uses both a Subtotal item and a
Discount item. If you’re interested in how this works, look back there.
Use the Account drop-down list to specify the expense account that you want
to use to track the cost of the discounts you offer.
Click Apply Discount Before Taxes if you want to use this option. (This option
appears only if you indicated in the EasyStep Interview that you charge sales
tax.) If you need to collect sales tax and you didn’t set up this function in the
EasyStep Interview, follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences.
The Preferences dialog box appears.
2. Click the Sales Tax icon from the list on the left, click the Company
Preferences tab, and mark the Yes option button in the Do You Charge
Sales Tax area.
3. Then add the Sales Tax item(s) to your Item list.

Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 

Creating Sales Tax Group items to batch sales taxes together
Sales Tax Groups enable you to batch several sales taxes that you’re sup-
posed to charge as one sales tax so that they appear as a single sales tax on
the invoice. Combining the taxes is necessary — or at least possible — when
you’re supposed to charge, say, a 6.5 percent state sales tax, a 1.7 percent
county sales tax, and a 0.4 percent city sales tax, but you want to show one,
all-encompassing 8.6 percent sales tax on the invoice.
To add a Sales Tax Group item, display the New Item window and specify the
item type as Sales Tax Group. QuickBooks displays the New Item window
shown in Figure 2-7. Use the Tax Item/Rate/Tax Agency/Description list box to
list the other sales tax items that you want to include in the group. When you
click an item line in the list box, QuickBooks places a down arrow at the right
end of the Tax Item column. You can click this arrow to open a drop-down list
of Sales Tax items.
Editing items
If you make a mistake, you can change any piece of item information by dis-
playing the Item List window and double-clicking the item so that QuickBooks
displays the Edit Item window. You then can use the Edit Item window to
make changes.

Adding Employees to Your Employee List
If you do payroll in QuickBooks or if you track sales by employees, you need
to describe each employee. Describing employees is pretty darn easy. Choose
Lists➪Employee List to display that window. Then click the Employee button
and choose New from the drop-down menu to have QuickBooks display the
New Employee window, shown in Figure 2-8.
See Figure 2-8? It’s pretty straightforward, right? You just fill in the fields to
describe the employee.
Lesser computer book writers would probably provide step-by-step descrip-
tions of how you move the cursor to the First Name text box and type the
person’s first name, how you move the cursor to the next text box, type
something there, and so on. Not me. No way. I know that you can tell just by
looking at this window that all you do is click a text box and type the obvious
bit of information. Right?
Figure 2-8:
The New
Employee
window.
48
Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 

I’ll tell you a couple of important things about the New Employee window,
however. When you release an employee, it’s important to enter the release
date for the employee after you’ve written that final paycheck on the
Employment Info tab. This way, when you process payroll in the future, you
can’t accidentally pay the former employee. As for the Type field, most
employees probably fit the regular category. If you’re uncertain whether an
employee fits the guidelines for corporate officer, statutory employee, or
owner, see the Circular E publication from the IRS. And sleep tight.
The Additional Info tab enables you to create customizable fields, in case you
want to keep information that isn’t covered by the QuickBooks default fields —
favorite color and that type of thing. Note, too, that you can include the infor-
mation shown in Figure 2-9 by choosing Payroll and Compensation Info from
the Change Tabs box. Again, what you need to do on this tab is fairly straight-
forward. By the way, if you’ve told QuickBooks that you want to do payroll,
QuickBooks prompts you to enter the information it needs to calculate things
like federal and state income taxes, payroll taxes, and vacation pay.
Figure 2-9:

Info tab in

Chapter 2: Lots of Lists

After you finish describing an employee, click OK to add the employee to the
list and return to the Employee List window. Or click Next to add the
employee to the list and add more employees.
You can also inactivate an employee from your list if it starts to get cluttered
with names of employees who may no longer work for you. Read about inacti-
vating items, employees, customers, and vendors in the sidebar “Inactivating
list items” later in this chapter.
Customers Are Your Business
This is sort of off the subject of lists, but I read about a survey that some
business school had conducted. In the survey, people who wanted to start a
business were asked what is the most important thing that a person needs to
start a business. Almost all of them answered, “Cash.” The same survey also
asked a large number of people who had already started businesses — many
of whom had been running their businesses successfully for years — what’s
the most important thing that a person needs to start a business. They all
answered, “Customers.”
50
Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 
Inactivating list items
One of the neat features in QuickBooks is that it
enables you to simplify your lists by hiding items
that are no longer active, including those that
you expect to be active again later. If you have
seasonal employees, you can hide them from
your Employee list for the times of the year
when they don’t work. Or if you sell commemo-
rative key chains only every five years, you can
keep them from cluttering your Item list in the
off years. You can also inactivate customers
and vendors from their respective lists.
To inactivate something from a list, all you have
to do is open the list and double-click the item.
When QuickBooks opens the item, employee,
customer, or vendor that you want to inactivate,
check the Item Is Inactive box. (The name of the
box changes, depending on what you’re trying
to inactivate.) Then click OK. QuickBooks hides
this member from your list. The next time you
display the list, the Show All box appears.
To view and edit hidden members of your list,
just click the Show All box. Any inactive mem-
bers show up with little hand icons beside them.
If you want to reactivate a member, all you have
to do is click the hand icon, and the member is
reactivated.

Weird, huh? I do think that those survey results are true, though. You need
customers to get into business. Everything else — including cash — is sec-
ondary. But I’ve sort of gotten off track. I’m supposed to be describing how
you add to your Customer List. Here’s the blow-by-blow:
1. Choose Lists➪Customer:Job List.
The Customer:Job List window appears.
2. Click the Customer:Job button and choose New from the drop-down
menu.
QuickBooks displays the Address Info tab of the New Customer window,
as shown in Figure 2-10. Use this window to describe the customer in as
much detail as possible.
3. Type the customer’s name.
Enter the name of the customer as you want it to appear in the
Customer list. You can list customers by company name or by the repre-
sentative’s last name.
4. Give the company name.
That’s right, type the customer’s company name.

Chapter 2: Lots of Lists

If you see a Check Credit button in the New Customer window, you can
click it to get credit information from Dun & Bradstreet — all the inside
dirt on the very customer you’re describing. This service isn’t free. For a
subscription, you’ll pay roughly $20 to $40 a month, depending on the
level of service; or, if you’re not a subscriber, you’ll pay roughly $15 for
each credit report. Dun & Bradstreet credit reports, in case you haven’t
seen one before, are pretty interesting. You know who the firm owners
are and generally get information both on a firm’s revenues and its cur-
rent payment practices. Two cautions, however. Some of the information
is provided by the customer (so you can’t know how good the informa-
tion is). Also, some of the information is often rather, well, out-of-date. In
spite of these problems, however, the information is often very useful for
assessing the financial condition of your more important customers.
5. (Optional) Give the name of your contact, along with other pertinent
information.
Move the cursor to the Mr./Ms. text box and type the appropriate title.
Same with the First Name, M.I., and Last Name text boxes. (QuickBooks
automatically types the names into the Contact text box as you type
them. Nice touch, eh?)
Go ahead and fill in the Phone, FAX, Alt. Ph. (alternate phone), and 
E-mail text boxes while you’re at it.
6. (Really optional) Give the name of your alternate contact.
Move the cursor to the Alt. Contact text box and type the name of the
alternate contact.
7. Give the billing address.
You can use the Bill To text box to provide the customer’s billing
address. QuickBooks copies the Company and Contact names to the first
lines of the billing address, so you need to enter only the address. To
move from the end of one line to the start of the next, press Enter.
8. Give the shipping address.
You can use the Ship To text box to provide the customer’s shipping
address if this address differs from the Bill To address. (If it’s the same,
just click Copy.) You enter this information in the same way that you enter
the Bill To address. A few deft mouse clicks. Some typing. You’re done.
9. (Optional) Click the Additional Info tab and record some more data.
If you want, click the Additional Info tab. When you do, QuickBooks dis-
plays the tab shown in Figure 2-11. You can use this tab to describe the
customer in more detail.
10. (Optional) Click the Payment Info tab and record some more data.
You can click the Payment Info tab and then use its boxes to record bits
of customer information, such as the account number that should be
included with any payments. I’m not showing the Payment Info tab here.

11. (Optional) Click the Job Info tab to add specific job information.
Because you’re creating a new customer account, not invoicing by jobs,
I’ll wait and explain this step in the next section. If you’re the “can’t-
wait” type, feel free to take a look. You can add a specific job to the new
customer’s information.
12. Save the customer information.
When you finish describing a customer, click OK to add the customer to
the list and return to the Customer:Job List window. Or click Next to add
the customer to the list and keep the New Customer window on-screen
so that you can add more customers.
If you want to change some bit of customer information, display the
Customer:Job List window, double-click the customer account you want to
change, and then make changes by using the Edit Customer window.
QuickBooks enables you to synchronize the contact information in your
name lists with Microsoft Outlook or Best Software’s ACT!. To do so, choose
Company➪Synchronize Contacts. Follow the steps of the Synchronization

once.)

It’s Just a Job
In QuickBooks, you can track invoices by customer or by customer and job.
This may sound kooky, but some businesses invoice customers (perhaps sev-
eral times) for specific jobs.
Take the case of a construction subcontractor who does foundation work for
a handful of builders of single-family homes. This construction subcontractor
probably invoices his customers by job, and he invoices each customer sev-
eral times for the same job. For example, he invoices Poverty Rock Realty for
the foundation job at 1113 Birch Street when he pours the footing and then
again when he lays the block. At 1028 Fairview, the same foundation job takes
more than one invoice, too.
To set up jobs for customers, you need to first describe the customers (as I
explain in the preceding section). Then follow these steps:
1. Choose Lists➪Customer:Job List.
QuickBooks displays the Customer:Job List window.
2. Select the customer for which you want to set up a job.
This step is simple. Just click the customer name.
3. Click the Customer:Job button at the bottom of the window and
choose Add Job from the drop-down menu.
QuickBooks displays the New Job window (shown in Figure 2-12). You
use this window to describe the job. A great deal of the information in
this window appears on the invoice.
4. Give the job name.
The cursor is in the Job Name text box. Just type the name of the job or
project.
5. Identify the customer.
On the off chance that you selected the wrong customer in Step 2, take a
peek at the Customer drop-down list box. Does it name the correct cus-
tomer? If not, activate the drop-down list and click the correct customer.
6. (Optional) Name your contact and fill in other relevant information.
You can enter the name of your contact and alternate contact in the
Mr./Ms., First Name, M.I., and Last Name text boxes. QuickBooks fills in
the Contact text box for you. You probably don’t need to be told this,
but fill in the Phone and FAX text boxes just so that you have that infor-
mation on hand. If you want to get really optional, fill in the Alt. Ph. and
Alt. Contact text boxes. Go ahead: Take a walk on the wild side.
54

7. Give the job’s billing address.
You can use the Bill To text box to provide the customer’s job billing
address. Because chances are good that the job billing address is the
same as the customer billing address, QuickBooks copies the billing
address from the Customer list. But, if need be, make changes.
8. Give the Ship To address.
You can use the Ship To text box to provide the job’s shipping address.
Click the Copy button if the shipping address is the same as the Bill To
address.
9. (Massively optional) Click the Additional Info tab to categorize 
the job.
You can use the Customer Type drop-down list box to give the job type.
The only initial types in the default list are Corporate and Referral. You
can create other types by choosing Add New from the Customer Type
drop-down list box (so that QuickBooks displays the New Customer
Type dialog box) and then filling in the dialog box blanks.

10. Set the customer’s credit limit.
If you click the Payment Info tab, you can set the customer’s credit limit
using the Credit Limit box. That is, enter it if you’ve set one.
11. Type 0 (zero) for the Opening Balance.
Move the cursor to the Opening Balance text box and type 0 (zero).
12. Enter the current date.
Move the cursor to the As Of text box and enter the current date.
13. (Optional) Add specific job information.
Click the Job Info tab, shown in Figure 2-13, and fill in the information
about the job. You can use the Job Status drop-down list box to choose
None, Pending, Awarded, In Progress, Closed, or Not Awarded,
whichever is most appropriate. The Start Date is (I know that this one is
hard to believe) the day you start the job. As anyone knows, the
Projected End and the End Date aren’t necessarily the same. Don’t fill in
the End Date until the job is actually finished. The Job Description field
can contain any helpful information you can fit on one line, and the Job
Type is an extra field you can use. (If you do use this field, you can add a
new job type by choosing Add New from the Job Type list box.)
14. Save the job information.
After you finish describing the job, click OK to add the job to the list and
return to the Customer:Job List window. Or click Next to add the job to
the list and keep the New Job window on-screen so that you can add
more jobs.

The little things do matter
If you’re not familiar with how payment terms
work, you can get a bird’s-eye view here. For the
most part, payment terms just tell the customer
how quickly you expect to be paid. For example,
Net Due Upon Receipt means that you expect to
be paid as soon as possible. If Net is followed
by some number, as in Net 15 or Net 30, the
number indicates the number of days after the
invoice date within which the customer is sup-
posed to pay. So Net 15 means that the cus-
tomer is supposed to pay within 15 days of the
invoice date.
Some payment terms, such as 2% 10 Net 30,
include early payment discounts. In other
words, the customer can deduct 2 percent from
the bill if it’s paid within 10 days. Either way, the
customer must pay the bill within 30 days. For
more information on how to make early pay-
ment discounts work for you, see Chapter 21.

You can edit job information the same way that you edit customer informa-
tion. Display the Customer:Job List window by choosing Lists➪Customer:Job
List. When QuickBooks displays the list, double-click the job and use the Edit
Job window that appears to make the changes.
Adding Vendors to Your Vendor List
Adding vendors to your Vendor list works the same basic way as adding cus-
tomers to your Customer list does. Here’s how to get the job done:
1. Choose the Lists➪Vendor List command.
QuickBooks displays the Vendor List window. Along with listing your
vendors, it lists any sales tax agencies that you identified as part of set-
ting up Sales Tax items.
2. Click the Vendor button and choose New from the drop-down menu.
QuickBooks displays the Address Info tab of the New Vendor window, as
shown in Figure 2-14. You use this window to describe the vendors and
all their little idiosyncrasies.

3. Give the vendor’s name.
The cursor is already in the Vendor Name text box. All you have to do is
type the vendor’s name as you want it to appear on the Vendor list. If
you want to list your vendors by company name, enter the company
name. To list them by the first or last name of the sales representative,
enter one of these names.
4. (Optional) Give the name of your contact.
Fill in the Mr./Ms., First Name, M.I., and Last Name text boxes.
QuickBooks fills in the Contact text box for you automatically.
5. Give the address to which you’re supposed to mail checks.
You can use the Address text box to provide the vendor’s address.
QuickBooks copies the Company and Contact names to the first line of
the address, so you need to enter only the street address, city, state, and
zip code. To move from the end of one line to the start of the next, press
Enter.
6. (Optional) Give the vendor’s telephone and fax numbers and, if avail-
able, the e-mail address.
Figure 2-14:

The window also has an Alt. Ph. text box for a second telephone number.
They thought of everything, didn’t they?
7. Verify the Print on Check As text box.
QuickBooks assumes that you want the company name to appear on any
checks you write for this vendor. If not, change the text box to whatever
you feel is more appropriate.
At this point, click the Additional Info tab. The window you see on-
screen hopefully bears an uncanny resemblance to Figure 2-15.
8. (Optional) Give your account number.
If the vendor has assigned account numbers or customer numbers to
keep track of customers, type your account or customer number in the
Account No. text box. You can probably get this piece of information
from the vendor’s last invoice.
An account number is required if you want to use QuickBooks’ online
bill payment feature (which I describe in Chapter 11) to pay the vendor.
QuickBooks transfers the account number to the memo field of the
payment check.

9. Categorize the vendor.
See that Type drop-down list box? You can use it to assign the vendor a
type. If you activate the drop-down list by clicking its arrow, you see the
initial QuickBooks list of vendor types. You can pick any of these types,
but my suggestion is that you diligently identify any vendor to whom you
need to send a 1099 as a 1099 contractor. (A 1099 contractor is any unin-
corporated business to whom you pay more than $600 during the year.)
To create a new vendor type, choose Add New from the drop-down list
and fill in the blanks in the New Vendor Type dialog box that QuickBooks
displays. You can create as many new vendor types as you need.
10. Specify the payment terms that you’re supposed to observe.
Activate the Terms drop-down list and click one of its terms. QuickBooks
has already set up all the usual ones. (If you want to, you can choose
Add New to set up additional payment terms.)
If a vendor offers an early payment discount, it’s usually too good of a
deal to pass up. Interested in more information about early payment dis-
counts? Is yours an inquiring mind that needs to know? See Chapter 21
to find out about the advantages of early payment discounts.
11. (Optional) Specify your credit limit, if the vendor has set one.
This procedure is obvious, right? You click the Credit Limit text box and
enter the number.
12. (If applicable) Store the vendor’s federal tax identification number
and check the Vendor Eligible for 1099 check box.
This number may be the vendor’s Social Security number if the vendor
is a one-man or one-woman business. If the vendor has employees, the
federal tax identification number is the vendor’s employer identification
number. You need this information only if you’re required to prepare a
1099 for the vendor.
13. Type 0 (zero) in the Opening Balance text box.
You don’t want to enter the amount you owe the vendor because you do
that later, when you pay your bills.
14. Type the date on which you opened an account with the vendor.
Move the cursor to the As Of field and enter the date you first purchased
goods from the vendor.
15. Save the vendor information.
After you finish describing the vendor, click OK to add the vendor to the
list and return to the Vendor List window. Or click Next to add the
vendor to the list and leave the New Vendor window on-screen so that
you can add more vendors.

The Other Lists
Throughout the preceding sections, I cover almost all of the most important
lists. A few others I haven’t talked about yet are Fixed Asset, Price Level,
Sales Tax Code, Classes, Other Names, Sales Rep, Customer Type, Vendor
Type, Job Type, Terms, Customer Messages, Payment Method, Ship Via, and
Memorized Transactions. I’m not going to give blow-by-blow descriptions of
how you use these lists because you don’t really need them. The other
QuickBooks lists are generally more than adequate. You can usually use the
standard lists as is, without building other lists.
Just so I don’t leave you stranded, however, I want to give you quick-and-
dirty descriptions of these other lists and what they do.
To see some of these lists, choose the list from the Lists menu, or choose the
Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists command and choose the list from
the submenu that QuickBooks displays.
The Fixed Asset list
If you buy fixed assets — things such as vehicles, various pieces of furniture,
miscellaneous hunks of equipment, and so on — somebody is supposed to be
tracking this stuff in a list. Why? You need to have this information at your
fingertips (or at your accountant’s fingertips) to calculate depreciation. And
if you later dispose of some item, you need this information to calculate the
gain or loss on the sale of the item.
For these reasons, it’s pretty neat that QuickBooks 2004 includes a new fixed
assets list feature. Figure 2-16 shows the New Item window used to describe a
fixed asset and thereby build a list of fixed assets. All you have to do is provide
a description and the original cost. You can, however, provide additional infor-
mation using, for example, the Notes box.
Note: I should tell you that your CPA or tax accountant already has such a list
that he or she has been maintaining for you. So don’t, like, freak out because
this is the first you’ve heard about this fixed assets business.
The Price Level list
The first time I encountered QuickBooks’ Price Level feature, I was sorely con-
fused about how the feature worked. I’m still a little confused — not about
61
Chapter 2: Lots of Lists

how the feature works but about who’d really want to use this feature. But,
heck, what do I know. Here’s the deal: Price Levels enable you to adjust an
item price as you’re creating an invoice. For example, you can create a price
level that increases the price for some item by 20 percent. And you create a
price level that decreases the price for some item by 10 percent. You adjust a
price by selecting a price level from the Price field on an invoice. (This may
not make much sense until you see the Create Invoices window, which I
describe in Chapter 4, but it’s fairly straightforward.)
The Sales Tax Code list
The Sales Tax Code list just maintains a list of sales tax codes. These sales tax
codes, when used on an invoice or bill, tell QuickBooks whether items are
taxable.
Figure 2-16:

Asset New

Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 

The Class list
Classes enable you to classify transactions by department or location, for
example, so that you can track trends and assess performance across parts of
your business. Classes are cool, really cool. But they add another dimension to
the accounting model that you use in QuickBooks. So I’m not going to describe
them here. I urge you — nay, I implore you — to get comfortable with how the
rest of QuickBooks works before you begin mucking about with classes. I’ll just
tell you that you can display the Class list by choosing Lists➪Class List.
You can probably perform basic class-tracking activities easier and better
with a clever chart of accounts or a Customer:Job List.
You don’t see a Class List command on the Lists menu if you indicated during
the EasyStep Interview that you don’t want to use classes.
The Other Names list
QuickBooks provides an Other Names list that works as a watered-down,
wimpy Vendor and Employee list combination. You can write checks to
people named on this Other Names list, but you can’t do anything else. You
can’t create invoices or purchase orders for them, for example. And you
don’t get any of the other information that you want to collect for vendors or
employees.
You’re really better off working with good, accurate, rich Vendor and
Employee lists. If you don’t like this suggestion, however, just choose Lists➪
Other Names List to display the Other Names List window, click the Other
Names button, choose New from the drop-down menu, and then fill in the
blanks in the New Name window.
The Sales Rep list
You can create a list of the sales representatives you work with and then indi-
cate which sales rep sells to a customer or generates a sale. To do this, choose
Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Sales Rep. When you choose the
command, QuickBooks displays the Sales Rep List window, which lists all the
sales representatives. To add sales representatives, click the Sales Rep
button, choose New from the drop-down menu, and then fill in the window
that QuickBooks displays.
63
Chapter 2: Lots of Lists

Customer, Vendor, and Job Types list
You can create lists of customer types, vendor types, and job types and 
then use these lists to categorize customer, vendor, and job information. 
This is probably no surprise, but to do this, you need to use the appropriate
command:
 Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Customer Type List
 Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Vendor Type List
 Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Job Type List
When you choose one of these commands, QuickBooks displays the appro-
priate List window, which lists all the Customer types, Vendor types, or Job
types. To add types, click the Type button, choose New from the drop-down
menu, and then fill in the window that QuickBooks displays.
How you use any of these type lists depends on your business. But in a situa-
tion where you want to sort or segregate customers, vendors, or jobs in some
way that’s unusual, use the Customer Type, Vendor Type, or Job Type list.
The Terms list
QuickBooks maintains a Terms list, which you use to specify what payment
terms are available. To add terms, choose Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile
Lists➪Terms List. When you choose this command, QuickBooks displays 
the Terms List window. To add more terms, click the Terms button, choose
New from the drop-down menu, and then fill in the window that QuickBooks
displays.
The Customer Message list
This list is another minor player in the QuickBooks drama. You can stick mes-
sages at the bottom of invoices if you first type the message in the Customer
Message list. QuickBooks provides a handful of boilerplate messages. You can
add more messages by choosing Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪
Customer Message List. When QuickBooks displays the Customer Message
List window, click its Customer Message button and choose New. Then use
the New Customer Message window that QuickBooks displays to create a new
message.
64
Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 

The Payment Method list
Now this will be a big surprise. (I’m just kidding.) QuickBooks provides
descriptions for the usual payment methods. But, of course, you can add to
these by choosing Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Payment Method.
When you choose the command, QuickBooks displays the lost city of Atlantis.
Okay, not really. QuickBooks actually displays the Payment Method window.
To add more methods, click the Payment Method button, choose New from
the drop-down menu, and then fill in the window that QuickBooks displays.
The Ship Via list
QuickBooks provides descriptions for the usual shipping methods. These
descriptions are probably entirely adequate. If you need to add more, how-
ever, you can do so by choosing Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪
Ship Via. When you choose the command, QuickBooks displays the Ship Via
List window, which lists all the shipping methods that you or QuickBooks has
said are available. To add more methods, click the Shipping Method button,
choose New from the drop-down menu, and then fill in the window that
QuickBooks displays. Friends, it doesn’t get much easier than this.
The Memorized Transaction list
The Memorized Transaction list isn’t really a list. At least, it’s not like the
other lists I describe in this chapter. The Memorized Transaction list is a list
of accounting transactions — invoices, bills, checks, purchase orders, and so
on — that you’ve asked QuickBooks to memorize. To display the Memorized
Transaction list, choose Lists➪Memorized Transaction List.
You can have QuickBooks memorize transactions so that you can quickly
record them later or even put them on a schedule for recurring usage. This fea-
ture can save you lots of time, especially for transactions you regularly make.
The Reminders list
Here’s a list that’s not accessible from the Lists menu. QuickBooks keeps track
of a bunch of stuff that it knows you need to monitor. If you choose Company➪
Reminders, QuickBooks displays the Reminders window. Here you see such
entries as invoices and checks that need to be printed, inventory items you
should probably reorder, and so on.
65
Chapter 2: Lots of Lists

Organizing and Printing Lists
To organize a list, you must be in single-user mode if you aren’t already. (I
describe multi-user mode in Chapter 3.) Here are some ways you can orga-
nize your list:
 To move an item and all its subitems, click the diamond beside the item
and drag the item up or down the list to a new location.
 To make a subitem its own item, click the diamond beside the item and
drag it to the left.
 To make an item a subitem, first move the item so that it’s directly
beneath the item you want it to fall under. Then click the diamond
beside the item and move it to the right.
 To alphabetize a list, click the button in the lower-left corner of the list
window. (The name of this button changes, depending on the list that
you’re displaying.) Then choose Re-sort List from the pop-up menu.
Sensing that you definitely mean business and don’t want it fooling
around, QuickBooks displays a message box that asks whether you’re
sure that you want to re-sort your list. Click OK to alphabetize.
You can’t reorganize the Vendor list.
Jotting down notes for list items
To enter more information about a name on a list, display the list and select
the customer, vendor, employee, or other name. Then click the button in the
lower-left corner of the list window. (The name of this button changes,
depending on the type of list.) Choose Notepad from the pop-up menu. In the
Notepad dialog box that appears for the person, type your notes and click
OK. You can also click Date Stamp to stamp the current date on the note.
Printing lists
You can print a list by displaying the list, clicking the button in the lower-left
corner of the list window, and choosing Print List. However, the best way to
print a list is often to print a list report. You can create, customize, and print
a list report by choosing Reports➪List and then choosing the list that you
want to print. You can also create one of a handful of list reports by clicking
the Reports button in the list window and choosing a report from the pop-up
menu. For more information on printing reports, see Chapter 14.
66
Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 

Click the Activities button in a list window to quickly access common activi-
ties associated with the items on that list. Or, click Reports to quickly access
common reports related to the items on the list.
Exporting List Items to 
Your Word Processor
If you use QuickBooks to store the names and addresses of your customers,
vendors, and employees, you can create a text file of the contact information
for these people. You can then export this file to another application, like a
word processor, to create reports that use this information. Or, you can use
the contact information for things such as mass mailings or mailing labels.
The Company menu provides a Print Mailing Labels command for producing
mailing labels for customers and vendors.
To export list information to a text file, click the button in the lower-left corner
of the list window and choose Print List. When QuickBooks displays the Print
dialog box, mark the File option button, click Print, and then provide a filename
when prompted.

Chapter 3
Sharing QuickBooks Files
In This Chapter
 Understanding how QuickBooks works on a network
 Installing QuickBooks for network use
 Setting up user permissions
 Specifying multi-user mode
 Working with a shared QuickBooks file
O
kay, here’s a cool deal: You can use the standard version of QuickBooks
to set up user permissions, which lets you specify who has access 
to which areas of your QuickBooks file. And if you have the Pro or Premier
versions of QuickBooks, you can also work with your QuickBooks file on a
network and in a multiple-user environment, using a powerful new feature
called record locking.
If you work on a network and need to use or just want to learn about the
QuickBooks network features, you should read this chapter. If your computer
isn’t connected to a network but you want to designate unique permissions
for different people using a QuickBooks file on a single computer, you should
read the section “Setting Up User Permissions” in this chapter. And if you’re
the only one using QuickBooks, you can skip this chapter.
Sharing a QuickBooks File on a Network
Two important features power the QuickBooks Pro multi-user network capa-
bility: user permissions and record locking. The user permissions feature lets
multiple users of a QuickBooks file have unique permissions settings to
access different areas of QuickBooks. (The standard version of QuickBooks
also includes user permissions, which you can use on a standalone computer,
but it’s especially pertinent for network users of QuickBooks.) Record locking,
a feature specific to the Pro and Premier versions, allows more than one
person to log on to and work with a QuickBooks file at once.

User permissions
QuickBooks lets you set user permissions so that you can give different
QuickBooks users different privileges. For example, Jane Owner may be able
to do anything she wants because, metaphorically speaking, she’s “Da Man.”
But Joe Clerk may only be able to enter bills. Joe, a lowly clerk of perhaps
dubious judgment and discretion, may not have the ability to view the com-
pany’s profit and loss statement, print checks, or record customer payments.
This idea makes sense at a practical level, right? In a situation where a bunch
of people access the QuickBooks file, you want to make sure that confidential
information remains confidential.
You also want to make sure that people can’t intentionally or unintentionally
corrupt your financial records. For example, you don’t want someone to
enter incorrect data (perhaps because they stumble into some area of the
QuickBooks program where they have no business being). And you don’t
want someone fraudulently recording transactions — like fake checks that
they then go cash.
I think that if you reflect on this user permissions stuff, you’ll realize, “Hey,
yeah, that only makes sense!” So I’m not going to talk a bunch more about it.
But let me conclude by throwing out a couple of general observations about
how you decide which user permissions are appropriate:
 Data confidentiality: This issue probably has the most to do with your
management philosophy. The more open you are about stuff, the less
you probably have to worry about people snooping around for stuff. I
want to point out, however, that payroll is always a touchy subject. If
everybody knows what everyone else is paid, some interesting discus-
sions occur. But you already knew that. . . .
 Data corruption: Regarding data corruption, you need to know that
people usually apply two general rules:
• Don’t give people access to tools they don’t know how to use.
That’s only asking for trouble.
• Make sure that no one person gets to muck around unsupervised
in some area of the accounting system — especially if that person
records or handles cash.
If at all possible, employ a “buddy” system where people do stuff together so
that people always double-check — even if only indirectly — other people’s
work. Maybe Joe records a bill, for example, but Jane always cuts the check
to pay the bill. Maybe Raul records customer invoices, but Chang sends them
out. Maybe Saul records cash receipts, but Britt deposits them. You see the
pattern, right? If two people deal with a particular economic event — again,
especially one that involves cash — it’s a really good idea for Joe and Jane,
Raul and Chang, and Saul and Britt to look over each other’s shoulders.
70
Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 

Record locking
The easiest way to understand record locking is to compare it to the other
variety of locking, file locking. Most of the other programs that you use —
perhaps every one but QuickBooks — use file locking. What file locking means
is this: If one person on the network has, for instance, a word-processing docu-
ment open, nobody else on the network can open that document. Other people
may be able to open a copy of the document that they can save on their own
computers, but they can’t edit the original document. The operating system
“locks” the original document, or file, so that only one person can fool around
with the file at a time. This locking assures the integrity of the data and the
changes that people make to the data. (If this business about assuring integrity
seems weird, think about the difficulty of making sure that both people’s
changes end up in a word-processing document that both people are simulta-
neously editing.)
Record locking works differently. With record locking, more than one person
on the network can open and edit the same file at once. But only one person
can work with a specific record.
A record is a part of a file. For example, in a file of bills you owe to vendors, the
file is the entire collection of bills. The individual bills are records within the
file. So more than one person can open the file of bills. But individual bills —
the individual records that make up the file — are locked when a person grabs
a record.
This information sounds like too much confusion, but differentiating between
files and the records within a file is what makes sharing files possible. In
QuickBooks, for example, if Jane is entering one bill for the Alpha Company in
a file, Joe can edit a bill for Beta Corporation, because the two bills are differ-
ent records. However, Jane can’t — because of record locking — fool around
with the Beta Corporation bill that Joe’s editing. And Joe can’t — again
because of record locking — fool around with the Alpha Company bill that
Jane’s entering.
71
Chapter 3: Sharing QuickBooks Files
Just what is a network, anyway?
A network is a set of computers that someone
has cabled together so that the people who use
the computers can share information. Uh, well,
er, this is somewhat self-serving, but let me say
that if you don’t currently use a network,
Networking For Dummies, 6th Edition, by Doug
Lowe, and Home Networking For Dummies by
Kathy Ivens (both published by Wiley Publishing,
Inc.), explain how to set up a small business net-
work in a couple of hours and live to tell about it.

Restated more generally, no two people can edit the same record in the file at
the same time. Record locking enables employees to use a file in a multi-user
environment because it lets more than one person work with a file.
Installing QuickBooks for Network Use
To install QuickBooks Pro for network use, you must first install QuickBooks
on all the computers on the network that need to access and work with the
QuickBooks file. This task isn’t tricky. You don’t need to install QuickBooks in
any fancy way to be able to share QuickBooks files.
You need to purchase a copy of QuickBooks Pro for each computer that’s
going to run the program. So if you have five computers on which you want
to use QuickBooks, you need to buy five copies of QuickBooks. Or you can
buy the special five-license version of QuickBooks. If you attempt to install a
single copy of QuickBooks (with a single key code) on multiple computers,
QuickBooks won’t allow two computers using the same key code to share a
file in multi-user mode.
When you create the file that you want to share, you need to make sure that
you store the file in a location where the other QuickBooks users can access
it. You may need to store the file on a server. You can also store the file on a
client computer as long as you designate sharing permissions for either the
folder or the drive on which you save the QuickBooks file.
72
Part I: You Gotta Start Someplace 
Choosing a good password
The administrator has access to all areas of
QuickBooks, so picking a good password is
especially important. Other users (especially
those with higher levels of access permission)
also need to select their passwords carefully.
A good password is one that you can easily
remember but others can’t easily guess.
Combinations of letters and numbers are the
best way to go. For example, use your grade
school nickname plus the number of your
favorite basketball player. Or use a random
number combined with the name of your
favorite restaurant (as long as you don’t walk
around all day muttering, “Number nine,
number nine, number nine,” and raving about
your love of this particular eatery). Avoid using
telephone numbers, family names, and family
dates (such as the birthday of a family member).
And absolutely do not use banking PIN numbers
or Social Security numbers.
One last tip: QuickBooks lets you create pass-
words from zero to 16 characters in length. As a
general rule, choose a password that’s five or
more characters in length.

Another important thing: Whoever creates the QuickBooks file automatically
becomes the file administrator. The file administrator has access to all areas
of the file and sets up the other file users. So, you don’t want just anybody
setting up the QuickBooks file. Either the business owner or the head of
accounting is well suited for this job. In any case, the person who sets up the
file should be trustworthy, regularly around the office, and easy to reach for
any questions or problems that arise. And this person probably should have
a strong background in accounting. See the following section for more details.
Setting Up User Permissions
You can tell QuickBooks who else will use the file and set permissions for
these other people during the EasyStep Interview. You can also give
QuickBooks this information later. To do it later, use the User List dialog box
shown in Figure 3-1. To display this dialog box, choose Company➪Set Up
Users.
1. Click Add User.
Doing so displays the first dialog box of the Set Up User Password and
Access Wizard, as shown in Figure 3-2. You use this wizard to add new
users and specify user permissions.
2. Type a user name and password for the additional person you want to
be able to use the QuickBooks file; type the password again in the
Confirm Password box.
Reentering the password confirms that you typed the password cor-
rectly the first time.
From this point forward, when someone opens the QuickBooks file,
QuickBooks asks for a user name and password. So in order for another
person to access the QuickBooks file, he or she must enter the user
name and password that you’ve set.
Figure 3-1:
The User
List dialog
box.

Chapter 3: Sharing QuickBooks Files

3. Click Next.
QuickBooks displays a dialog box (not shown here) asking whether you
want the person to have access to all areas of the QuickBooks file or
only some areas.
4. Click All Areas or click Selected Areas and then click Next.
If you specify that you want to give access to only some areas,
QuickBooks displays a series of dialog boxes (starting with the Sales and
Accounts Receivable dialog box shown in Figure 3-3) that allow you to
set permissions for each area.
Can I alert you to a potentially dangerous security flaw in QuickBooks? I
don’t want to unnecessarily alarm you, but the CPAs that I teach
QuickBooks to tell me that it’s very common for embezzling employees
to print something like an invoice but then not save the invoice. (Take a
peek at the dialog box shown in Figure 3-3. See how you need to decide
whether someone can print invoices?) By printing and then sending an

invoice, the embezzler tells some customer of yours that they need to
pay your firm money . . . but because QuickBooks doesn’t make you save
a transaction before you print it, the invoice may never be recorded in
the QuickBooks system. That means, sadly, that when the customer
sends you payment, the embezzler can just steal the check without your
being the wiser. The morale of this little story is this: Think carefully
about the access permissions you set.
5. Designate the access permission level for each area in the Set Up User
Password and Access Wizard.
Click No Access to make the area off-limits for the user. Click Full Access
to give the user permission to create and print transactions and reports
in the area, or click Selective Access to give partial access to the area. If
you click Selective Access, specify the limited access. Click Next after
supplying each area’s access information to proceed to the next area.
The other areas’ dialog boxes look and work the same way.
6. Tell QuickBooks whether you want the user to be able to change or
delete existing transactions and those recorded before the closing
date you specify.
After you go through the access permissions for all the areas, QuickBooks
displays the dialog box shown in Figure 3-4. Use the option buttons in this
dialog box to restrict user access to existing transactions. By specifying a
closing date, you can prevent users — for example, new QuickBooks users
or new employees — from altering data before a given date.
To set a closing date, log on to the QuickBooks file as the administrator.
Then make sure that you’re working in single-user mode. (If you aren’t,
choose File➪Switch to Single-User Mode.) Then choose Company➪Set Up
Users and click the Closing Date button. In the Set Closing Date dialog box,
enter the date on and before which you want to restrict changes to trans-
actions into the Date Through Which Books Are Closed box and click OK.

Chapter 3: Sharing QuickBooks Files

7. Click Next.
Specify whether you want the user to be able to access QuickBooks data
from another application, such as TurboTax.
8. Review the permissions that you’ve granted the new user.
Figure 3-5 shows a summary of the permissions for a user. Click Prev if
you need to go back and change permissions for an area.
9. Click Finish to finish setting up the new user.
QuickBooks displays the User List dialog box again, but with the new
user added. Click Add User to add another new user, click Edit User to
edit the selected user, or click Close to close the dialog box.
A user can log on and open a QuickBooks file from any computer on the net-
work, as long as the computer has QuickBooks installed and has network
access to the QuickBooks file. If a person attempts to open a restricted area
or perform an unauthorized action, QuickBooks displays a message box that
indicates that the person lacks the permissions necessary to perform the
action.
Individual users can specify and save their own personal preferences for
working with QuickBooks. For example, a user can decide to display and even
customize the QuickBooks icon bar or set options for graphs, reminders, and
warnings. Users can access their individual preference settings by choosing
Edit➪Preferences. Select an area by clicking an icon (such as General) on the
left. Click the My Preferences tab if it isn’t already selected.

Specifying Multi-User Mode
For more than one person to work with the QuickBooks file at once, the users
must work with the QuickBooks file in what is called multi-user mode. The
first person who opens the file needs to specify multi-user mode for others to
be able to open the file. To specify multi-user mode, choose File➪Switch to
Multi-User Mode. When you choose this command, QuickBooks displays a
dialog box alerting you that you’ve switched to multi-user mode, as shown in
Figure 3-6. Then it redisplays the QuickBooks file. You can tell that you’re
working in multi-user mode because the QuickBooks title bar indicates so.
When other people open the QuickBooks file, it automatically opens in multi-
user mode. For another user to work in single-user mode, the other users
must close the QuickBooks file.
Working in Multi-User Mode
Sharing a QuickBooks file over a network involves a couple of tricks. First,
you need to make sure that no one is using the file that you want to open in
single-user mode. If someone is and you try to open the file, QuickBooks dis-
plays a message that indicates that someone is currently using the company
file in single-user mode. Tell the person to switch to multi-user mode and
then click Try Again.
As soon as you begin creating or editing a transaction, QuickBooks locks the
transaction. This way, no one else can edit the transaction as you work on it.
You can tell whether you have a transaction open in edit mode by what
QuickBooks indicates in the title bar at the top of the form: QuickBooks puts
the phrase “Editing Transaction” in the title bar. Other users can open the
transaction as you edit it in edit mode, but they can’t make changes to it until
you’re through.
For example, if you attempt to edit a transaction that your coworker Harriet
already has open in edit mode, QuickBooks displays a message that says,
“Excuse me, Bubba? Harriet is working with that transaction. You need to
come back later.”

O
kay. You’ve got QuickBooks set up. Or maybe you
were lucky enough to have someone else do all the
dirty work. But all that doesn’t matter now. It’s in this part
where the rubber really hits the road. You need to start
using QuickBooks to do a bunch of stuff on a regular, and
maybe daily, basis. Invoice customers. Record customer
payments. Pay bills. This part describes how you do all
these things.

I
n this chapter — you may be surprised to hear — I describe how to create
and print invoices in QuickBooks, as well as how to create and print credit
memos.
You use the QuickBooks invoice form to bill customers for the goods you sell.
You use its credit memos form to handle returns and canceled orders for
which you’ve received payments.
Making Sure That You’re Ready 
to Invoice Customers
I know that you’re probably all set to go. But first, you need to check a few
things, okay? Good.
You already should have installed QuickBooks, of course. (I describe how in
Appendix A.) You should have set up a company, a chart of accounts, and all
of your lists in the EasyStep Interview. You also should have entered your
starting trial balance or talked your accountant into entering it for you, as I
describe in Chapter 1.

As long as you’ve done all this prerequisite stuff, you’re ready to start. If you
don’t have one of the prerequisites done, you need to complete it before
going any further.
Sorry. I don’t make the rules. I just tell you what they are.
Preparing an Invoice
After you complete all the preliminary work, preparing an invoice with
QuickBooks is a snap. If clicking buttons and filling in text boxes are becom-
ing old hat to you, skip the following play-by-play commentary and simply
display the Create Invoices window — by choosing Customers➪Create
Invoices, for example — and then fill in this window and click the Print
button. If you want more help than a single sentence provides, keep reading
for step-by-step instructions.
In the following steps, I describe how to create the most complicated and
involved invoice around: a product invoice. Some fields on the product
invoice don’t appear on the service or professional invoice, but don’t worry if
your business is a service or professional one. Creating a service or profes-
sional invoice works basically the same way as creating a product invoice —
you just fill in fewer fields. And keep in mind that you start with Steps 1 and 2
no matter what type of invoice you create. Without further ado, here’s how to
create an invoice:
1. Choose Customers➪Create Invoices.
As an alternative to the Customers➪Create Invoices command, you can
also click Customers in the Navigators box and then click the Invoices
icon.
The Create Invoices window appears, shown in Figure 4-1.
2. Select the template, or invoice form, that you want to use from the
Template drop-down list box.
QuickBooks comes with four predefined invoice forms: Product,
Professional, Service, and Progress. Which one appears by default
depends on which one you told QuickBooks you wanted to use in the
EasyStep Interview. You can download additional templates by choosing
Download Templates from the drop-down list. Or create your own custom
invoice template (or modify an existing one) by clicking the Customize
button. I describe customizing invoice forms in the “Customizing Your
Invoices and Credit Memos” section, later in this chapter.

Part II: Daily Chores 

3. Identify the customer and, if necessary, the job.
Activate the Customer:Job drop-down list by clicking the down arrow at
the right end of the box. Scroll through the Customer:Job list until you
see the customer or job name that you need, and then click it.
4. (Optional) Assign a class to the invoice.
If you use classes to track expenses and income, activate the Class drop-
down list and choose an appropriate class for the invoice. To turn this
handy way of categorizing transactions on or off (which is overkill for
some businesses), choose Edit➪Preferences, click Accounting on the
left, click the Company Preferences tab, and then select or clear the Use
Class Tracking check box. (Figure 4-1 doesn’t show the Class box.)
5. Give the invoice date.
Press Tab several times to move the cursor to the Date text box. Then
enter the correct date in MM/DD/YY format. You also can use the follow-
ing secret codes to change the date:
• Press + (the plus symbol) to move the date ahead one day.
• Press – (the minus symbol) to move the date back one day.
Figure 4-1:
The Create
Invoices
window.
83
Chapter 4: Invoices and Credit Memos

• Press T to change the date to today’s date (as specified by the
system time that your computer’s internal clock provides).
• Press M to change the date to the first day of the month (because
M is the first letter in the word month).
• Press H to change the date to the last day of the month (because H
is the last letter in the word month).
• Press Y to change the date to the first day of the year (because, as
you no doubt can guess, Y is the first letter in the word year).
• Press R to change the date to the last day of the year (because R is
the last letter in the word year).
You can also click the button on the right side of the Date field to display
a small calendar. To select a date from the calendar, just click the date
you want. Or click the arrows on the top-left and top-right sides of the
calendar to display the previous or next month.
6. (Optional) Enter an invoice number.
QuickBooks suggests an invoice number by adding 1 to the last invoice
number that you used. You can accept this addition, or, if you need to
have it your way, you can tab to the Invoice # text box and change the
number to whatever you want.
7. Fix the Bill To address, if necessary.
QuickBooks grabs the billing address from the Customer list. You can
change the address for the invoice by replacing some portion of the
usual billing address. You can, for example, insert another line that says,
“Attention: William Bobbins,” if that’s the name of the person to whom
the invoice should go.
8. Fix the Ship To address, if necessary.
I feel like a broken record, but here’s the deal: QuickBooks also grabs the
shipping address from the Customer list. So, if the shipping address has
something unusual about it for just this one invoice, you can change the
address by replacing or adding information to the Ship To address block.
9. (Optional . . . sort of) Provide the purchase order number.
If the customer issues purchase orders, enter the number of the pur-
chase order that authorizes this purchase in the P.O. Number text box.
(Just for the record, P.O. is pronounced “pee-oh.” Not “poh” or “poo.”)
10. Specify the payment terms.
To specify the payment terms, activate the Terms drop-down list box
and select something from it. I have only one request to make: Don’t
offer a customer an early payment discount without reading the first
couple of sections in Chapter 21. Please. I’m only looking out for your
welfare. Really.
84
Part II: Daily Chores 

11. (Optional) Name the sales representative.
Rep doesn’t stand for Reputation, so don’t put three-letter editorial com-
ments in here. (Although I can’t, for the life of me, imagine what you could
do with three letters.) If you want to track sales by sales representative,
use the Rep drop-down list box. Simply activate the list box by clicking its
arrow, for example, and then pick a name. Sales representatives can
include employees, but they can also include other people you’ve entered
in your other lists. To quickly add a sales rep, choose Add New and then
use the handy-dandy dialog boxes QuickBooks displays. To work with the
Sales Rep list, choose Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Sales Rep
List.
12. Specify the shipping date if it’s something other than the invoice date.
To specify the date, simply move the cursor to the Ship text box and
then type the date in MM/DD/YY fashion. You can move the cursor by
pressing Tab or by clicking the text box.
Oh — one other quick point: Remember all those secret codes I talk
about in Step 5 for changing the invoice date? They also work for
changing the shipping date.
13. Specify the shipping method.
You can probably guess how you specify the shipping method, but paral-
lel structure and a compulsive personality force me to continue. So, to
specify the shipping method, move the cursor to the Via drop-down list,
activate the list, and then select a shipping method.
By the way, you can add new shipping methods to the list by choosing
Add New and then filling out the cute little dialog box that QuickBooks
displays. Setting up new shipping methods is really easy. Really easy.
14. Specify the FOB point by using the F.O.B. text box.
FOB stands for free-on-board. The FOB point is more important than it
first seems — at least in a business sense — because the FOB point
determines when the transfer of ownership occurs, who pays freight,
and who bears the risks of damage to the goods during shipping.
If a shipment is free-on-board at the shipping point, the ownership of the
goods being sold transfers to the purchaser as soon as the goods leave
the seller’s shipping dock. (Remember that you’re the seller.) In this
case, the purchaser pays the freight and bears the risk of shipping
damage. You can specify the FOB shipping point either as FOB Shipping
Point or by using the name of the city. If the shipping point is Seattle, for
example, FOB Seattle is the same thing as FOB Shipping Point. Most
goods are shipped as FOB Shipping Point, by the way.
If a shipment is free-on-board at the destination point, the ownership of
the goods that are being sold transfers to the purchaser as soon as the
goods arrive on the purchaser’s shipping dock. The seller pays the
85
Chapter 4: Invoices and Credit Memos

freight and bears the risk of shipping damage. You can specify the FOB
destination point either as FOB Destination Point or by using the name
of the city. If the destination point is Omaha, for example, FOB Omaha is
the same thing as FOB Destination Point.
15. Enter each item that you’re selling.
Move the cursor to the first row of the Quantity/Item Code/Description/
Price Each/Amount/Tax list box. Okay, I know that isn’t a very good
name for it, but you know what I mean, right? You need to start filling in
the line items that go on the invoice. After you move the cursor to a row
in the list box, QuickBooks turns the Item Code field into a drop-down
list box. Activate the Item Code drop-down list box of the first empty
row in the list box and then select the item.
When you select the item, QuickBooks fills in the Description and Price
Each text boxes with whatever sales description and sales price you’ve
entered in the Item list. (You can edit the information for this particular
invoice if you need to.) Enter the number of items sold in the Quantity
text box. (After you enter this number, QuickBooks calculates the
amount by multiplying Quantity by Price Each.) If you need other items
on the invoice, use the remaining empty rows of the list box to enter
each one. If you checked the Taxable check box when you added the
item to the Item list, the word Tax appears in the Tax column to indicate
that the item will be taxed. (If the item is nontaxable [or you feel like
being a tax evader for no good reason], click the Tax column and select
Non.)
You can put as many items on an invoice as you want. If you don’t have
enough room on a single page, QuickBooks adds as many pages as nec-
essary to the invoice. Information about the invoice total, of course,
goes only on the last page.
Click the Time/Costs button at the top of the form to display the Choose
Billable Time and Costs dialog box. Use this dialog box to select costs
you’ve assigned to the customer or job. Use the Items tab to select items
purchased for the job. Use the Expenses tab to select reimbursable
expenses and enter markup information. Use the Time tab to select bill-
able time recorded by the Timer program, the Weekly Timesheet, or in
the Time/Enter Single Activity window.
16. Enter any special items that the invoice should include.
If you haven’t worked much with the QuickBooks item file, then you
have no idea what I’m talking about. (For more information about adding
to and working with lists in QuickBooks, cruise through Chapter 2.)
To describe any of the special items, activate the Item Code drop-down
list box of the next empty row and then select the special item. After
QuickBooks fills in the Description and Price Each text boxes, edit this
information (if necessary). Describe each of the other special items —
subtotals, discounts, freight, and so on — that you’re itemizing on the
invoice by filling in the empty rows in the list box.
86
Part II: Daily Chores 

If you want to include a Discount item and have it apply to multiple
items, you need to stick a Subtotal item on the invoice after the inven-
tory or other items you want to discount. Then stick a Discount item
directly after the Subtotal item. QuickBooks calculates the discount as a
percentage of the subtotal.
17. (Optional) Add a customer message.
Click the Customer Message box, activate its drop-down list, and select a
clever customer message. To add customer messages to the Customer
Message list, choose Add New and then fill in the dialog box that
QuickBooks displays. (I know that I talk about the Customer Message
box in Chapter 2, but I want to quickly describe how to add a customer
message again so that you don’t have to flip back a bunch of pages.)
18. Specify the sales tax.
If you specified a tax rate in the Customer list, QuickBooks uses it as a
default. If it isn’t correct, move the cursor to the Tax list box, activate
the drop-down list, and select the correct sales tax.
19. (Truly optional) Add a memo.
You can add a memo description to the invoice if you want to. This
memo doesn’t print on invoices — only on the Customer Statement.
Memo descriptions give you a way of storing information related to an
invoice with that invoice. Figure 4-2 shows a completed Create Invoices
window.
20. If you want to delay printing this invoice, unmark the To Be Printed
check box that’s below the column of buttons in the lower-left area of
the Create Invoices window.
I want to postpone talking about what checking the To Be Printed check
box does until I finish the discussion of invoice creation. I talk about
printing invoices a little later in the chapter. I promise.
21. Save the invoice.
To save a completed invoice, click either Save & New or Save & Close.
QuickBooks saves the invoice that’s on-screen. If you clicked Save &
New, QuickBooks displays an empty Create Invoices window so that you
can create another invoice.
You can page back and forth through invoices that you created earlier
by clicking the Next and Previous buttons.
When you’re done creating invoices, you can click the invoice form’s
Close button. The Close button, also known as the Close box, is the little
box marked with an “X” in the upper-right corner of the window.

Chapter 4: Invoices and Credit Memos

Fixing Invoice Mistakes
I’m not a perfect person. You’re not a perfect person. Heck, very few people
are. So everyone makes mistakes. You don’t need to get worked up over mis-
takes that you make while entering information in invoices, though, because
in the following sections, I show you how to fix the most common mistakes
you might make on your invoices.
If the invoice is still displayed on-screen
If the invoice is still displayed on-screen, you can just move the cursor to the
box or button that’s wrong and then fix the mistake. Because most of the bits
of information that you enter in the Create Invoices window are short and
sweet, you can easily replace the contents of some fields by typing over
whatever’s already there. To start all over again, just click the Clear button.
To save the invoice after you’ve made your changes, click Save & New.
If you need to insert a line in the middle of the invoice choose Insert Line or
Delete Line from the shortcut menu that appears.
Figure 4-2:
A completed
Create
Invoices
window.
88
Part II: Daily Chores 

If the invoice isn’t displayed on-screen
If the invoice isn’t displayed on-screen but you haven’t yet printed it, you can
use the Next and Previous buttons to page through the invoices. When you get
to the one with the error, simply fix the error as I describe in the preceding sec-
tion. If you make an error fixing the invoice, you can click the Revert button to
go back to the saved invoice. The Revert button replaces the Clear button
when you’re viewing an existing invoice — an invoice you’ve already saved.
If you’ve printed the invoice, you also can make the sort of change I describe
in the preceding paragraphs. For example, you can page through the invoices
until you find the one (now printed) that has the error. And you can change
the error and print the invoice again. I’m not so sure that you want to go this
route, however, if you’ve already sent out the invoice. You may want to con-
sider fixing the invoice by issuing either a credit memo (if the original invoice
overcharged) or another invoice (if the original invoice undercharged). The
reason I suggest issuing a credit memo (which I show you how to do in the
appropriately titled section “Preparing a Credit Memo,” later in this chapter)
or another invoice is that life gets awfully messy if you or your customer has
multiple copies of the same invoice floating around and causing confusion.
Deleting an invoice
I hesitate to mention this, but you also can delete invoices. Procedurally,
deleting an invoice is easy. You just display the invoice in the Create Invoices
window and choose Edit➪Delete Invoice. When QuickBooks asks you to con-
firm your deletion, click Yes. But read the following paragraph first. You may
not want to delete the invoice. . . .
Even though deleting invoices is easy, it isn’t something that you should do
casually or for fun. Deleting an invoice is okay if you’ve just created it; only
you have seen it, and you haven’t yet printed it. In this case, no one needs to
know that you’ve made a mistake. It’s your private secret. But the rest of the
time — even if you’ve created an invoice that you don’t want later — you
should keep a copy of the invoice in the QuickBooks system. By doing so, you
have a record that the invoice existed, which usually makes it easier to
answer questions later.
“But how do I correct my books if I leave the bogus invoice?” you ask.
Good question. To correct your financial records for the invoice that you
don’t want to count anymore, simply void the invoice. The invoice remains in
the QuickBooks system, but QuickBooks doesn’t count it (it loses its quantity
and amount information). Good news — voiding an invoice is just as simple
as deleting one. Just display the invoice in the Create Invoices window and
then choose Edit➪Void Invoice.
89
Chapter 4: Invoices and Credit Memos

Preparing a Credit Memo
Credit memos can be a handy way to fix data-entry mistakes that you didn’t
find or correct earlier. Credit memos are also handy ways to handle things
such as customer returns and refunds. If you’ve prepared an invoice or two in
your time, you’ll find that preparing a QuickBooks credit memo is a lot easier
than using old-fashioned methods.
In the following steps, I describe how to create the most complicated and
involved kind of credit memo: a product credit memo. Creating a service or
professional credit memo works basically the same way, however. You just fill
in fewer fields.
1. Choose Customers➪Create Credit Memos/Refunds to display the
Create Credit Memos/Refunds window.
QuickBooks displays the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window, shown
in Figure 4-3.
2. Identify the customer and, if necessary, the job.
Activate the Customer:Job drop-down list. Then select the customer or
job by clicking it.
3. (Optional) Specify a class for the credit memo.
If you’re using classes to categorize transactions, activate the Class
drop-down list and select the appropriate class for the credit memo.
4. Date the credit memo (going steady is optional).
Press Tab to move the cursor to the Date text box. Then enter the cor-
rect date in MM/DD/YY format. You also can use the secret date-editing
codes that I describe in the section “Preparing an Invoice” earlier in the
chapter. Oh, boy.
5. (Optional) Enter a credit memo number.
QuickBooks suggests a credit memo number by adding 1 to the last
credit memo number you used. You can accept the number or tab to the
Credit No. text box to change the number to whatever you want.
6. Fix the Customer address, if necessary.
QuickBooks grabs the billing address from the Customer list. You can
change the address for the credit memo by replacing some portion of
the usual billing address. Typically, you should use the same address for
the credit memo that you used for the original invoice or invoices.
90
Part II: Daily Chores 

7. (Optional . . . sort of) Provide the purchase order number.
If the credit memo adjusts the total remaining balance on a customer
purchase order, you should probably enter the number of the purchase
order into the P.O. No. text box.
Here’s my logic on this suggestion for those readers who care: If you
billed your customer $1,000 on P.O. No. 1984, which authorizes a $1,000
purchase, you’ve “used up” the entire purchase order — at least accord-
ing to the customer’s accounts payable clerk who processes your
invoices. If you make sure that a credit memo for $1,000 is identified as
being related to P.O. No. 1984, however, you essentially free up the
$1,000 purchase balance, which may mean that you can use, or bill on,
the purchase order again.
8. If the customer is returning items, describe each item.
Move the cursor to the first row of the Item/Description/Qty/Rate/
Amount/Tax text box. In the first empty row of the box, activate the Item
drop-down list and then select the item. After you select it, QuickBooks
Figure 4-3:
The Create
Credit
Memos/
Refunds
window.
91
Chapter 4: Invoices and Credit Memos

fills in the Description and Rate text boxes with whatever sales descrip-
tion and sales price you entered in the Item list. (You can edit this infor-
mation if you want, but it’s not necessary.) Enter the number of items
that the customer is returning (or not paying for) in the Qty text box.
(After you enter this number, QuickBooks calculates the amount by mul-
tiplying Qty by Rate.) Enter each item that the customer is returning by
filling in the empty rows of the list box.
As with invoices, you can put as many items on a credit memo as you
want. If you don’t have enough room on a single page, QuickBooks keeps
adding pages to the credit memo until you’re finished. The total informa-
tion, of course, goes on the last page.
9. Describe any special items that the credit memo should include.
If you want to issue a credit memo for other items that appear on the
original invoice — freight, discounts, other charges, and so on — add
descriptions of each item to the Item list.
To add descriptions of these items, activate the Item drop-down list of
the next empty row and then select the special item. (You activate the
list by clicking the field once to turn it into a drop-down list box and
then by clicking the field’s down arrow to access the list box.) After
QuickBooks fills in the Description and Rate text boxes, edit this infor-
mation (if necessary). Enter each special item — subtotal, discount,
freight, and so on — that you’re itemizing on the credit memo.
If you want to include a Discount item, you need to stick a Subtotal item
on the credit memo after the inventory or other items that you’ve dis-
counted. Then stick a Discount item directly after the Subtotal item. In
this way, QuickBooks calculates the discount as a percentage of the
subtotal.
10. (Optional) Add a customer message.
Activate the Customer Message list and select a clever customer message.
11. Specify the sales tax.
Move the cursor to the Tax list box, activate the list box, and select the
correct sales tax.
12. (Optional, but a really good idea. . . .) Add a memo.
You can use the Memo text box to add a memo description to the credit
memo. I suggest that you use this description to explain your reasons
for issuing the credit memo and to cross-reference the original invoice
or invoices. Note that the Memo field prints on the Customer Statement.
Figure 4-4 shows a completed Create Credit Memos/Refunds window.
92
Part II: Daily Chores 

13. If you want to delay printing this credit memo, clear the To Be Printed
check box.
I want to postpone talking about what checking the To Be Printed check
box does until I finish the discussion of credit memo creation. Coverage
on printing invoices and credit memos comes up in the following section.
14. Save the credit memo.
To save a completed credit memo, click either Save & New or Save &
Close. QuickBooks saves the credit memo that’s on-screen and then, if
you clicked Save & New, displays an empty Create Credit Memos/Refunds
window so that you can create another credit memo. (Note that you can
page back and forth through credit memos that you created earlier by
clicking the Next and Previous buttons.) When you’re done creating
credit memos, you can click the credit memo form’s Close button.
To print a refund check, click the Check Refund button after you’ve filled out
the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window. QuickBooks displays the Write
Checks window and automatically fills out the check, linking it to the memo.

Chapter 4: Invoices and Credit Memos

Fixing Credit Memo Mistakes
Sure, I can repeat the same information that I gave you in the section, “Fixing
Invoice Mistakes,” and leave you with a strange feeling of déjà vu. But I won’t.
Here’s everything you need to know about fixing credit memo mistakes: You
can fix credit memo mistakes the same way that you fix invoice mistakes. If
you need more help, refer to the earlier section “Fixing Invoice Mistakes.”
Printing Invoices and Credit Memos
As part of setting up QuickBooks, you selected an invoice type. I assume that
you have the raw paper stock for whatever invoice type you chose. If you’re
going to print on blank letterhead, for example, I assume that you have letter-
head lying around. If you decide to use preprinted forms, I assume that
you’ve ordered those forms and have received them.
I also assume that you’ve already set up your printer. If you’ve ever printed
anything, your printer is already set up. Really.
Loading the forms into the printer
This part is easy. Simply load the invoice forms into the printer the same way
you always load paper. Because you have one of about a jillion different print-
ers, I can’t give you the precise steps that you need to take, but if you’ve used
a printer a bit, you should have no problem.
Wait a minute. What’s that? Your printer is brand-new, and you’ve never used
it before? Okay, here’s one of my weird ideas: Use a pencil or something else
that’s heat-resistant (so that it won’t melt and gum up the insides of the
printer) to draw an arrow on a piece of paper. (Do not, repeat, do not use
crayon. And don’t let your children watch you do this.) Draw the arrow so
that it points toward the top edge of the paper. Load the paper in the printer,
with the arrow face up, and note which direction the arrow is pointing. Print
something. Anything. When the paper comes out, notice whether the image
faces the same direction as the arrow and whether it’s on the same side of
the paper as the arrow. With this information and a little logic, you should be
able to figure out how to load forms correctly.

Part II: Daily Chores 

Setting up the invoice printer
You need to set up the invoice printer only once, but you need to specify a
handful of general invoice-printing rules. These rules also apply to credit
memos and purchase orders, by the way.
To set up your printer for invoice printing, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Printer Setup and, in the Form Name drop-down list box,
select Invoice.
QuickBooks displays the Printer Setup dialog box, shown in Figure 4-5.
2. Select the printer that you want to use to print invoices.
Activate the Printer Name drop-down list to see the installed printers.
Select the one that you want to use for printing invoices and purchase
orders.
3. (Optional) Select the printer type.
The Printer Type drop-down list describes the kind of paper your printer
uses. You have two choices: Continuous and Page-Oriented. Continuous
means that your paper comes as one connected ream with perforated
edges. Page-Oriented means that your paper is in single sheets.
4. Select the type of invoice form.
Select the option button that describes the type of form that you want to
print on: Intuit Preprinted Form, Blank Paper, or Letterhead. Then mark
the Do Not Print Lines Around Each Field check box if you don’t like the
nice little boxes QuickBooks creates to separate each field.

5. (Optional, but a really good idea. . . . ) Print a test invoice on real
invoice paper.
Click the Align button. When QuickBooks displays the Align Printer
dialog box, choose the type of invoice you want to print from the list and
then click OK. When QuickBooks displays the Fine Alignment dialog box,
shown in Figure 4-6, click Print Sample to tell QuickBooks to print a
dummy invoice on whatever paper you’ve loaded in the invoice printer.
The dummy invoice that QuickBooks prints gives you a chance to see
what your invoices will look like. The invoice also has a set of alignment
gridlines that prints over the Bill To text box. You can use these gridlines
if you need to fine-align your printer.
6. Fix any form-alignment problems.
If you see any alignment problems after you complete Step 5, you need
to fix them. (Alignment problems usually occur only with impact print-
ers. With laser printers or inkjet printers, sheets of paper feed into the
printer the same way every time, so you almost never need to fiddle
with the form alignment.)
To fix any big alignment problems — like stuff printing in the wrong
place — you need to adjust the way the paper feeds into the printer.
When you finally get the paper loaded as best you can, be sure to note
exactly how you have it loaded. You need to have the printer and paper
set up the same way every time you print.
For minor, but nonetheless annoying, alignment problems, use the Fine
Alignment dialog box’s Vertical and Horizontal boxes to adjust the
form’s alignment. Then print another sample invoice. Go ahead and
experiment a bit. You need to fine-tune the printing of the invoice form
only once. Click OK in the Fine Alignment dialog box when you finish to
have QuickBooks redisplay the Printer Setup dialog box.
Clicking the Options button in the Printer Setup dialog box (refer to
Figure 4-5) opens the selected printer’s Windows printer setup informa-
tion, where you can do such things as specify quality settings or print
order. Because this information relates to Windows and not to
QuickBooks, I’m not going to explain it. If you’re the curious type or acci-
dentally click it and then have questions about what you see, refer
either to your Windows User’s Guide or the printer’s user guide.

7. Save your printer settings stuff.
After you finish fiddling with all of the Printer Setup dialog box’s boxes
and buttons, click OK to save your changes. 
If you want to always print a particular form using some particular set-
tings (maybe you always print two copies of an invoice, for example),
see the “Customizing Your Invoices and Credit Memos” section, later in
this chapter.
You can print invoices and credit memos either one at a time or in a batch.
How you print them makes no difference to QuickBooks or to me, your
humble author. Pick whatever way seems to fit your style the best. The fol-
lowing sections show you how.
Printing invoices and credit 
memos as you create them
If you want to print invoices and credit memos as you create them, follow
these steps:
1. Click the Print button after you create the invoice or credit memo.
After you fill in the boxes in the Create Invoices window or the Create
Credit Memos/Refunds window, click the Print button. QuickBooks, ever
the faithful servant, displays either the Print One Invoice dialog box
(shown in Figure 4-7) or the Print One Credit Memo/Refund dialog box
(which looks almost like the Print One Invoice dialog box).
Figure 4-7:

Chapter 4: Invoices and Credit Memos

2. (Optional) Select the type of invoice or credit memo form.
If you’re using a different type of invoice or credit memo form than
you’ve described for the invoice printer setup, select the type of form
that you want to print on in the Print On box. You can choose Intuit
Preprinted Forms, Blank Paper, or Letterhead.
You shouldn’t have to worry about printing test-invoice or credit-memo
forms or fiddling with form-alignment problems if you addressed these
issues when you set up the invoice printer. So I’m not going to talk about
the Align button here. If you want to do this kind of stuff and you need
help, refer to the preceding section, “Setting up the invoice printer,” in
which I describe how to print test forms and fix form-alignment problems.
3. Print the form.
Click the Print button to send the form to the printer. QuickBooks prints
the form.
4. Review the invoice or credit memo and reprint the form, if necessary.
Review the invoice or credit memo to see whether QuickBooks printed it
correctly. If the form looks wrong, fix whatever caused the problem (per-
haps you printed it on the wrong paper, for example) and reprint the
form by clicking the Print button again.
Printing invoices in a batch
If you want to print invoices in a batch, you need to check the To Be Printed
check box that appears in the lower-left corner of the Create Invoices
window. This check mark tells QuickBooks to put a copy of the invoice on a
special invoices-to-be-printed list.
When you later want to print the invoices-to-be-printed list, follow these
steps:
1. Display the Create Invoices window (choose Customers➪Create
Invoices), click the arrow next to the Print button, and choose Print
Batch from the drop-down menu.
QuickBooks displays the Select Invoices to Print dialog box, shown in
Figure 4-8. This box lists all the invoices you marked as To Be Printed
that you haven’t yet printed.
2. Select the invoices that you want to print.
Initially, QuickBooks marks all the invoices with a check mark, indicating
that they will be printed. You can check and uncheck individual invoices
on the list by clicking them. You also can use the Select All and the
Select None buttons. Click Select All to check all the invoices. Click
Select None to uncheck all the invoices.
98
Part II: Daily Chores 

3. Click OK.
After you correctly mark all the invoices you want to print — and none
of the ones you don’t want to print — click OK. QuickBooks displays the
Print Invoices dialog box, shown in Figure 4-9.
4. (Optional) Select the type of invoice form.
If you use a different type of invoice form than you described during the
invoice setup, select the type of form that you want to print on by using
the Print On options. You can choose Intuit Preprinted Forms, Blank
Paper, or Letterhead.
5. Print the forms.
Click the Print button to send the selected invoice forms to the printer.
QuickBooks prints the forms and then displays a message box that asks
whether the forms printed correctly.
Figure 4-9:
The Print
Invoices
dialog box.

Chapter 4: Invoices and Credit Memos

6. Review the invoice forms and reprint them if necessary.
Review the invoices to see whether QuickBooks printed all of them cor-
rectly. If all the forms look okay, click OK in the message box. If one or
more forms don’t look okay, enter the invoice number of the first bad
form in the message box. Then fix whatever problem fouled up the form
(perhaps you printed it on the wrong paper, for example) and reprint the
bad form(s) by clicking the Print button again. (The Print button is in
the Print Invoices dialog box.)
Printing credit memos in a batch
If you want to print credit memos in a batch, you need to check the To Be
Printed check box that appears in the lower-left corner of the Create Credit
Memos/Refunds window. Checking this box tells QuickBooks to put a copy of
the credit memo on a special credit-memos-to-be-printed list.
Printing credit memos in a batch works similarly to printing invoices in a
batch. Because I describe how to print invoices in a batch in the preceding
section, I’m going to speed through the following description of printing
credit memos in a batch. If you get lost or have questions, refer to the pre-
ceding section.
When you’re ready to print the credit memos that are on the to-be-printed
list, follow these steps:
1. Display the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window, click the arrow
next to the Print button, and choose Print Batch from the drop-down
menu.
QuickBooks displays the Select Credit Memos to Print dialog box.
2. Select the credit memos that you want to print.
3. Click OK to display the Print Credit Memos dialog box.
4. Use the Print Credit Memos dialog box to describe how you want your
credit memos to be printed.
5. Click the Print button to send the selected credit memos to the
printer.
QuickBooks prints the credit memos.

Sending Invoices and Credit 
Memos via E-Mail
If you have e-mail already set up on your computer, you can e-mail invoices
rather than print them. To e-mail an invoice or credit memo, click the Send
button, which appears at the top of the Create Invoices window. (The button
shows a picture of a little envelope with a green arrow.) QuickBooks displays
the Send Invoice window, shown in Figure 4-10.
Figure 4-10:

Chapter 4: Invoices and Credit Memos
What am I printing on?
Sometimes people get confused about the dif-
ference between preprinted forms, letterhead,
and plain paper. Here’s the scoop: Preprinted
forms have your company name, perhaps your
logo, and a bunch of other boxes and lines
(often in another color of ink) already printed on
them. Preprinted forms are often multipart
forms. (Examples of preprinted forms come in
the QuickBooks box.)
Letterhead is what you usually use for letters
that you write. It has your company name and
address on it, for example, but nothing else. To
save you from having to purchase preprinted
forms, QuickBooks enables you to use letter-
head to create invoices and forms. (To make the
letterhead look a little more bookkeeperish,
QuickBooks draws lines and boxes on the let-
terhead so that it looks sort of like a preprinted
invoice.)
Plain paper is, well, plain paper. Nothing is
printed on it. So QuickBooks needs to print
everything — your company name, all the
invoice stuff, and optionally, lines and boxes.

To send your invoice via e-mail, enter the e-mail address of the business you
want to bill or refund money to, edit the message as appropriate (make sure
to click that Check Spelling button), and then click the Send Now button.
If you want to wait to send your invoice, click the Send Later button while in
the Send Invoice window, or check the To Be Sent box in the lower-left corner
of the invoice window; QuickBooks batches your e-mail invoices together.
You can send the entire batch later by clicking the arrow next to the Send
button and choosing the Send Batch command.
You can also fax invoices and credit memos from inside QuickBooks if you
have a modem installed. To do this, click the Print button at the top of the
Create Invoices or Create Credit Memos/Refunds window, select your
fax/modem from the Printer Name drop-down list box, and then use the
wizard that appears to send the fax via your modem (long-distance charges
may apply — and Carrot Top can’t help).
Customizing Your Invoices 
and Credit Memos
With QuickBooks, you can easily customize the invoice and credit memo tem-
plates or create new invoices and credit memos based on one of the existing
QuickBooks templates. All you have to do is open the form that you want to
customize and click the Customize button. When QuickBooks displays the
Customize Template window, select an existing template and click Edit to edit
it, or click New to build a new template. If you’re creating a new invoice form,
QuickBooks displays the Customize Invoice dialog box shown in Figure 4-11.
You can use the tabs of the Customize Invoice dialog box to customize almost
everything on your invoice. You can choose what you want in the header,
footer, and fields of your invoice and in what order you want the information.
You can choose which information should print and which should appear on-
screen. You can rename the fields and columns. You can also change the
fonts or add a logo to your invoice.
If you want to always print a particular form using specific settings (for exam-
ple, maybe you always print credit memos in landscape mode on legal paper,
just for kicks), click the Printer tab, select the Use Specified Printers Settings
Below for This Invoice option, and then have at it.
If you’re creating a new invoice template, click the Layout Designer button on
the Customize Invoice dialog box to open the Layout Designer window, shown
in Figure 4-12. In this window, you can become a true layout artist and observe
how the overall look of your invoice changes when you move fields around
the page with your mouse.

Reeling In the Dough
In This Chapter
 Recording and printing sales receipts
 Special tips for retailers
 Fixing sales receipt mistakes
 Recording customer payments
 Correcting mistakes in recording customer payments
 Tracking customer open invoices and collections
 Assessing finance charges
You need to record the amounts customers pay you when they fork over
cash, whether at the time of a sale or after you invoice them. In this
chapter, I describe how to record these payments and explain how to make
bank deposits, track the amounts that customers owe and pay, and assess
finance charges.
If you’ve been using QuickBooks to prepare customer invoices, you’re ready
to begin recording payments. You’ll have no problem. If you haven’t been
invoicing customers, you need to make sure that you have a couple of things
ready to go before you can record cash sales.
First, you need to make sure that your lists are up-to-date. (I describe updating
these lists in Chapter 2.) And second, if you want to print sales receipts, you
need to have your printer set up to print them. You do so by choosing File➪
Printer Setup and then selecting Sales Receipt from the Form Name drop-down
list box. Setting up your printer to print sales receipts works just like setting it
up to print invoices and credit memos (as I describe in Chapter 4).
Recording a Sales Receipt
You record a sales receipt when a customer pays you in full for the goods at
the point of sale. Sales receipts work similarly to regular sales (for which you

first invoice a customer and then later receive payment on the invoice). In
fact, the big difference between the two types of sales is that sales receipts
are recorded in a way that changes your cash balance rather than your
accounts receivable balance.
In earlier versions, QuickBooks called sales receipts by another name: cash
sales.
In the following steps, I describe how to record sales receipts for products,
which are the most complicated type of cash sale. Recording sales receipts for
services works basically the same way, however. You simply fill in fewer fields.
1. Choose Customers➪Enter Sales Receipt.
Alternatively, select Customers from the Navigators list and click the
Sales Receipt icon.
The Enter Sales Receipts window appears, as shown in Figure 5-1.
Your Enter Sales Receipts window may not look exactly like mine for a
couple of reasons. The first is that QuickBooks customizes its forms to
fit your particular type of business. The second reason is that forms in
QuickBooks are really easy to customize. You can customize the Sales
Receipt form by clicking the Customize button in the Enter Sales
Receipts window.

Sales
Receipts

106
Part II: Daily Chores 

Customizing sales receipt forms works in a similar way to customizing
invoices and credit memos, as I describe in Chapter 4. If your Enter Sales
Receipts window includes more fields than I describe here, you can also
turn to that chapter for help on how to fill out the additional fields or
turn them off.
2. Identify the customer and, if necessary, the job.
Activate the Customer:Job drop-down list by clicking the down arrow to
the right of the box. Scroll through the Customer:Job list until you see
the customer or job name that you want and then click it. Note that
unlike invoices, the Customer:Job field is not required for cash sales.
3. (Optional) Specify a class for the sales receipt.
If you’re using classes to categorize transactions, activate the Class
drop-down list and select the appropriate class for the sales receipt.
4. Date the sales receipt.
Press Tab to move the cursor to the Date text box. Then type the correct
date in MM/DD/YY format. You can change the date by using any of the
date-editing codes. (You can find these codes in Chapter 4 and on the
Cheat Sheet at the front of the book.)
5. (Optional) Enter a sale number.
QuickBooks suggests a cash sale number by adding 1 to the last cash
sale number you used. Use this number, or tab to the Sale No. text box
and change the number to whatever you want.
6. Fix the Sold To address, if necessary.
QuickBooks grabs the billing address from the Customer list and uses
the billing address as the Sold To address. You can change the address
for the cash sale, however, by replacing the appropriate part of the usual
billing address.
7. Record the check number.
Enter the customer’s check number in the Check No. text box. If the cus-
tomer is paying you with cold hard cash, you can leave the Check No.
text box empty.
8. Specify the payment method.
To specify the payment method, activate the Payment Method drop-
down list and select something from it: cash, check, Visa, MasterCard, or
whatever. If you don’t see the payment method that you want to use,
you can add the method to the Payment Method list. Choose Add New
to display the New Payment Method dialog box. Enter a description of
the payment method in the text box and click OK.
9. Describe each item that you’re selling.
Move the cursor to the first row of the Item/Description/Qty/Rate/
Amount/Tax list box. When you do, QuickBooks turns the Item field into
107
Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough

a drop-down list box. Activate the Item drop-down list of the first empty
row in the list box and then select the item. When you do, QuickBooks
fills in the Description and Rate text boxes with whatever sales descrip-
tion and sales price you entered in the Item list. (You can edit this infor-
mation if you want, but that probably isn’t necessary.) Enter the number
of items sold in the Qty text box. (QuickBooks then calculates the
amount by multiplying the quantity by the rate.) Describe each of the
other items you’re selling by filling in the next empty rows of the list
box.
If you’ve already read the chapter on invoicing customers (see Chapter 4),
what I’m about to tell will seem very familiar: You can put as many items
on a sales receipt as you want. If you don’t have enough room on a single
page, QuickBooks adds as many pages as you need to the receipt. The
sales receipt total, of course, goes on the last page.
10. Describe any special items that the sales receipt should include.
If you didn’t set up the QuickBooks item file, you have no idea what I’m
talking about. But here’s the scoop: QuickBooks thinks that anything
that you stick on a receipt (or an invoice, for that matter) is something
that you’re selling. If you sell blue, yellow, and red thingamajigs, you
obviously need to add each of these items to the Item list. But if you add
freight charges to your receipt, QuickBooks thinks that these charges
are just another thingamajig and requires you to enter another item in
the list. The same is true for a volume discount that you want to stick on
the receipt. And if you add sales tax to your receipt, well, guess what?
QuickBooks thinks that the sales tax is just another item that needs to
be included in the Item list. (For more information about working with
your Item list and adding new items, refer to Chapter 2.)
To include one of these special items, move the cursor to the next 
empty row in the Item box, activate the drop-down list by clicking the
arrow on the right side of the box, and then select the special item. After
QuickBooks fills in the Description and Rate text boxes, you may need to
edit this information. Enter each special item — subtotals, discounts,
freight, and so on — that you’re itemizing on the receipt by filling in the
next empty rows of the list box.
If you checked the Taxable check box when you added the item to 
the Item list, the word Tax appears in the Tax column to indicate that the
item will be taxed.
If you want to include a discount item (so that all the listed items are
discounted), you need to stick a subtotal item on the receipt after the
inventory items or other items you want to discount. Then stick the
discount item directly after the subtotal item. In this way, QuickBooks
calculates the discount as a percentage of the subtotal.
108
Part II: Daily Chores 

11. (Optional) Add a customer message.
Click the Customer Message box, activate its drop-down list, and select
a clever customer message. To add customer messages to the customer
message list, choose Add New. When QuickBooks displays the New
Customer Message box, fill it in and click OK.
12. Specify the sales tax.
If you specified tax information when you created your company file
during the EasyStep Interview — remember how QuickBooks asked
whether you charge sales tax? — QuickBooks fills in the default tax
information by adding together the taxable items (which are indicated
by the word Tax in the Tax column) and multiplying by the percentage
you indicated when you created your company file. If the information is
okay, move on to Step 13. If not, move the cursor to the Tax box that’s to
the right of the Customer Message box, activate the drop-down list box,
and select the correct sales tax. For more information about setting a
default sales tax for a customer on the Customer List, refer to Chapter 2.
13. (Truly optional and probably unnecessary for cash sales) Add a memo
in the Memo text box.
You can include a memo description with the cash sale information. This
memo isn’t for your customer. It doesn’t even print on the cash receipt,
should you decide to print one. The memo is for your eyes only. Memo
descriptions give you a way to store information that’s related to a sale
with the sales receipt information.
14. Decide how you want to handle the resulting payment.
The option buttons in the lower-left corner enable you to designate
whether to group the payment with other undeposited funds or deposit
it directly to an account. To decide how to handle the payment, look at 
a previous bank statement. If your bank lists deposits as a transaction
total, you should probably click the Group with Other Undeposited
Funds option button. If your bank lists deposits individually by check,
you should probably click the Deposit To option button and use the
drop-down list box to designate the account to which you want to
deposit the payment. (I also describe how to handle deposits in the 
“In the Bank” section, later in this chapter.)
15. Decide whether you’re going to print the receipt.
If you’re not going to print the receipt, make sure that the To Be Printed
check box is empty — if not, click it to remove the check mark.
Figure 5-2 shows a completed Enter Sales Receipts window.

Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough

16. Save the sales receipt.
To save a completed sales receipt, click either Save & Close or Save &
New. QuickBooks saves the sales receipt that’s on-screen and then, if
you clicked Save & New, displays an empty Enter Sales Receipts window
so that you can create another sales receipt. (Note that you can page
back and forth through receipts that you created earlier by clicking the
Next and Previous buttons.) When you’re done creating sales receipts,
you can click the Enter Sales Receipts window’s Close button.
Printing a Sales Receipt
To print a single sales receipt as you’re recording the information, click the
Print button in the Enter Sales Receipts window. The Print One Sales Receipt
dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-3. The following steps tell you how
to complete this dialog box:
1. Select the type of sales receipt form.
If you’re using a different sales receipt form type than you described for
the invoice/PO printer setup, select the type of form that you want to
print on by clicking an option button in the Print On box. You can
choose Intuit Preprinted Forms, Blank Paper, or Letterhead. (See
Chapter 4 for more on these printer options.)

Part II: Daily Chores 

You shouldn’t have to worry about printing test receipts or fiddling with
form alignment problems if you addressed these issues during the
invoice/PO printer setup, so I’m not going to talk about the Align button
here. If you want to print a test receipt or need to change the alignment,
refer to Chapter 4 for information on how to proceed.
2. Print that puppy!
Click the Print button to send the form to the printer. QuickBooks prints
the sales receipt. 
3. Review the sales receipt and reprint the form, if necessary.
Review the sales receipt to see whether QuickBooks printed it correctly.
If the form doesn’t look okay, fix whatever problem fouled up the prin-
ting; perhaps you forgot to include the company name and address, for
example. Then reprint the form by clicking the Print button (in the Enter
Sales Receipts window) again, selecting the form on which you want to
print (again), and then clicking the Print button in the Print One Sales
Receipt dialog box (you got it — again).
To print a batch of receipts, make sure that you check the To Be Printed box on
each receipt that you want to print and then display the Enter Sales Receipts
window, click the arrow beside the Print button, and choose Print Batch from
the drop-down list. QuickBooks displays the Select Receipts to Print dialog
box, which enables you to choose which receipts to print. Choose the desired
receipts by putting a check in the first column and then click OK. The Print
Sales Receipts dialog box appears. This dialog box resembles the Print One
Sales Receipt dialog box in just about every way, and the instructions work in
exactly the same manner. For help with this dialog box, refer to the sections on
printing invoices and credit memos in batches in Chapter 4.

Special Tips for Retailers
Are you a retailer? If so, you’re probably saying to yourself, “Hey idiot, what
you just described is way too much work to do every time someone walks
into the store and buys, for example, some $3 item.”
You know what? You’re right. So here’s what retailers do to record their sales.
Retailers record the day’s sales using one, two, or three sales receipt transac-
tions. Retailers don’t record each individual sales receipt transaction. 
For example, say that some coffee mug retailer had sold 300 Rainbow coffee
mugs for the day and given everybody a 10 percent discount. (Perhaps the
discount was given because of a storewide sale or something.) In that case, at
the end of the day, the retailer would need to record total sales of $300, a $30
discount, and then the sales tax (in our example, sales tax equals 8.8 percent).
Using these example numbers, the daily sales would be recorded using a sales
receipt transaction like the one shown in Figure 5-2.
Pretty straightforward, right? And that’s not too much work, all things 
considered.
Let me share a handful of other tips for recording retail sales:
 You probably want to record a sales receipt transaction for each deposit
you make. In this manner, you can indicate that a particular sales receipt
transaction (really a batch of sales) is deposited at one time into your
bank account — which will make reconciling your bank account relatively
easy.
 You probably want to separate cash sales from credit card sales because
often credit card sales are handled differently. Your credit card proces-
sing company, for example, may hold onto credit card sales for a few
days, or it may deduct a fee before depositing the money into your bank
account. You want to record a separate sales receipt transaction for
each deposit you make (or some other company makes) into the bank
account — again to make reconciling the bank account easier.
 If you don’t use the Item list to monitor your inventory (because you
have way too many items to store in the QuickBooks Item list), use items
that are designated as non-inventory parts. For example, you might use
non-inventory part items like “daily cash sales,” “daily AmEx sales,” and
“daily Visa/MC sales” if you make three deposits every day for cash and
check sales, for American Express sales, and for Visa and MasterCard
sales. If you don’t track inventory in your items file, your CPA handles
the inventory and cost of goods sold calculations on your tax return. He
or she probably also records a journal entry transaction to get your
account balances right as of the end of your fiscal year.
112
Part II: Daily Chores 

 You may want to look at the QuickBooks Point of Sale system. The
QuickBooks Point of Sale system makes it easy to quickly record cash
register sales. In fact, the more expensive version of the QuickBooks
Point of Sale system comes with a scanner, a receipt printer, and a cash
drawer. When you use the QuickBooks Point of Sale system, the software
automatically records your sales and the effect on inventory and cost of
goods sold when you ring up a sale.
Correcting Sales Receipt Mistakes
If you make a mistake in entering a cash sale, don’t worry. Here’s a list of
common problems and how to fix them:
 If the sales receipt is still displayed on-screen: If the sales receipt is 
still on-screen, you can move the cursor to the box or button that’s
wrong and then fix the mistake. Most of the bits of information that you
enter in the Enter Sales Receipts window are fairly short or are entries
that you’ve selected from a list. You can usually replace the contents 
of some field by typing over whatever’s already there or by making a
couple of quick clicks. If you really messed up and want to start over
from scratch, you can click the Clear button. To save a receipt after
you’ve entered it correctly, click Save & Close or Save & New.
If you need to insert a line in the middle of a sales receipt, right-click
where you want to insert the line and choose Insert Line from the short-
cut menu. To delete a line, right-click it and then choose Delete Line
from the shortcut menu.
 If the sales receipt isn’t displayed on-screen: If the sales receipt isn’t
on-screen and you haven’t yet printed it, you can use the Next and
Previous buttons to page through the sales receipts. When you get to
the one with the error, fix the error as I describe in the preceding bullet.
If you make a mistake while editing a receipt, you can click the Revert
button to go back to the saved receipt and not save your changes.
Even if you’ve printed the customer’s receipt, you can make the sort 
of change that I just described. For example, you can page through the
sales receipts by using the Next and Previous buttons until you find the
receipt (now printed) with the error. And you can correct the error and
print the receipt again. I’m not so sure that you want to go this route,
however. Things will be much cleaner if you void the cash sale by dis-
playing the sales receipt and choosing Edit➪Void Sales Receipt. Then
enter a new, correct cash sales transaction.
113
Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough

 If you don’t want the sales receipt: You usually won’t want to delete
sales receipts, but you can delete them. (You’ll almost always be in
much better shape if you just void the sales receipt.) To delete the
receipt, display it in the Enter Sales Receipts window (choose
Customers➪Enter Sales Receipt, and then page through the sales
receipts by using the Next and Previous buttons until you see the cash
sale that you want to delete) and then choose Edit➪Delete Sales Receipt.
When QuickBooks asks you to confirm the deletion, click Yes.
If you want to see a list of all your cash sales, choose Edit➪Find Sales
Receipts from the menu (if you’re already viewing a sales receipt) and
then click the Find button. If you’re elsewhere in QuickBooks, choose
Edit➪Simple Find from the menu, choose Transaction Type from the Filter
list box and Sales Receipt from the drop-down list, and then click the Find
button. When you click the Find button, another screen pops up that asks
for details of the Sales Receipt you’re looking for first. Click the Find
button on that screen and QuickBooks gives you a list of your cash sales.
Recording Customer Payments
If your customers don’t always pay you upfront for their purchases, you need
to record another type of payment — the payments that customers make to
pay off or pay down what you’ve invoiced them. To record the payments, of
course, you need to first record invoices for the customer. If you issue credit
memos that customers can use to reduce the amounts they owe, you also
need to first record credit memos for the customer. (Check out Chapter 4 for
how to record these items.) The rest is easy.
To access a wealth of customer information all on one page, choose
Customers➪Customer Center. The Customer Center appears, listing out-
standing balances, unbilled time and costs, and customers by profitability.
To display the Receive Payments window, choose Customers➪Receive
Payments. Or select Customers from the Navigators list and then click the
Receive Payments icon. Then describe the customer payment and the
invoices paid. If you want the gory details, read through the following steps:
1. Choose Customers➪Receive Payments.
The Receive Payments window appears, as shown in Figure 5-4. (You
may be asked whether your company accepts credit cards — click Yes
or No to close the dialog box.)
2. Identify the customer and, if necessary, the job.
Activate the Received From drop-down list and select the customer (and
job, if necessary) by clicking it. QuickBooks lists the open, or unpaid,
invoices for the customer in the big Applied To list box at the bottom of
the window.

3. Specify the payment date.
Press Tab to move the cursor to the Date text box and type the correct
date in MM/DD/YY format. To edit the date, you can use the secret date-
editing codes that I describe in Chapter 4 and on the Cheat Sheet at the
front of the book.
4. Enter the amount of the payment.
Move the cursor to the Amount line and type the customer payment
amount.
5. (Optional) Specify the payment method.
Activate the Pmt. Method drop-down list and select the payment
method.
6. (Optional) Give the check number.
You can guess how this works, right? You move the cursor to the Ref./
Check No. line. Then you type the check number from the customer’s
check. Do you need to complete this step? Naw. But this bit of informa-
tion may be useful if you or the customer later have questions about
what checks paid for what invoices. So I’d go ahead and enter the check
number.

Payments
window.

Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough

7. (Optional) Add a memo description.
Use the Memo description for storing some bit of information that will
help you in some way. Note that this field prints on the Customer
Statement.
8. Decide how you want to handle the payment.
The option buttons in the lower-left corner of the window should look
somewhat familiar because they also appear in the Enter Sales Receipts
window. These options enable you to designate whether to group the
payment with other undeposited funds or deposit it directly to an
account.
9. If the customer has any outstanding credits, decide whether to apply
them in this payment.
QuickBooks totals the amounts of any of the customer’s existing credits.
They could be anything from an overpayment on a previous invoice to a
return credit or anything else.
If you want to apply a credit memo to a specific open invoice, select 
the invoice and then click the Set Credits button. When QuickBooks dis-
plays the Credits tab of the Discount and Credits dialog box, as shown in
Figure 5-5, click the credit memo you want to apply and then click Done.
10. Identify which open invoices the customer is paying.
By default, QuickBooks automatically applies the payment to the open
invoices, starting with the oldest open invoice. You can change this
application by entering amounts in the Payment column. Simply click
the open invoice’s payment amount and enter the correct amount.
Figure 5-5:
The Credits
tab of the
Discount
and Credits
dialog box.
116
Part II: Daily Chores 

You can leave a portion of the payment unapplied, if you want to. You
also can create a credit memo for the unapplied portion of a customer
payment by clicking the Print Credit Memo button. (For information on
what steps you need to follow next to print a credit memo, refer to
Chapter 4.)
If you want to apply the customer payment to the oldest open invoices,
click the Auto Apply button. If you want to unapply payments that
you’ve already applied to open invoices, click the Clear Selections
button. Clear Selections and Auto Apply are the same button.
QuickBooks changes the name of the button, depending on whether
you’ve already applied payments.
11. Adjust the early payment discounts, if necessary.
If you offer payment terms that include an early payment discount,
QuickBooks reduces the open invoice original amount (shown in the
Orig. Amt. column) by the early payment discount you specify to calcu-
late the adjusted amount due (shown in the Amt. Due column).
To specify the discount, select the open invoice that has the early pay-
ment discount that you want to change. Then click the Set Discount
button. With little or no hesitation, the Discount tab of the Discount and
Credits dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-6. Type the dollar
amount of the discount in the Amount of Discount text box. Then specify
the expense account that you want to use to track early payment dis-
counts by activating the Discount Account drop-down list and selecting
one of the accounts. (Interest Expense is probably a good account to
use, unless you want to set up a special early discounts expense account
called something like Discount Expense or Discounts Given. After all,
early payment discounts amount to interest.)
When you’re finished, click OK to return to the Receive Payments
window. (For more information on the costs and benefits of early pay-
ment discounts, see Chapter 22.)

Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough

12. Record the customer payment information.
After you identify which invoices the customer is paying — the unap-
plied amount should probably show as zero — you’re ready to record
the customer payment information. You can do so by clicking Save &
New or Save & Close. QuickBooks saves the customer payment shown
on-screen. If you click Save & New, QuickBooks then displays an empty
Receive Payments window so that you can enter another payment.
You can return to customer payments you recorded earlier by clicking
the Previous button.
Correcting Mistakes in Customer
Payments Entries
You can correct mistakes that you make in entering customer payments in
basically the same way that you correct mistakes that you make in entering
cash sales.
First, you display the window you used to enter the transaction. In the case of
customer payments, you choose Customers➪Receive Payments to display the
Receive Payments window. Then use the Next and Previous buttons to page
through the customer payments you entered previously until you see the one
that you want to change. And then you make your changes. Then you click
Save & Close. Pretty straightforward, right?
In the Bank
Whenever you record a cash sale or a customer payment on an invoice and
mark the Group with Other Undeposited Funds options, QuickBooks adds the
cash to its list of undeposited funds. These undeposited funds could be a
bunch of checks that you haven’t yet deposited, or they could consist of cur-
rency and coins. (I wanted to use the word coinage here because that’s what
your bank deposit slip probably uses. My long-suffering editor, however,
overruled me, saying coinage is a crummy word and overly complex.)
Eventually, though, you’ll want to take the money out from under your mat-
tress and deposit it in the bank. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Choose Banking➪Make Deposits.
Or, alternatively, select Banking from the Navigators list and click the
Deposit icon.
118
Part II: Daily Chores 

The Payments to Deposit dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-7.
This dialog box lists all the payments, regardless of the payment
method. Amounts from sales receipts are listed as RCPT, and amounts
from invoice payments are listed as PMT.
2. Select the payments that you want to deposit.
Click a payment or cash receipt to place a check mark in front of it,
marking it for deposit. If you want to uncheck a payment, click it again.
To uncheck all the payments, click the Select None button. To check all
the payments, click the Select All button.
3. Click OK.
After you indicate which payments you want to deposit, click OK.
QuickBooks displays the Make Deposits window, as shown in Figure 5-8.
4. Tell QuickBooks into which bank account you want to deposit the
money.
Activate the Deposit To drop-down list and select the bank account in
which you want to place the funds.
5. Specify the deposit date.
Press Tab to move the cursor to the Date text box and type the correct
date in MM/DD/YY format. Use the secret date-editing codes if you need
to edit the date. (Get these codes from Chapter 4 or the Cheat Sheet at
the front of the book if you don’t know them.)
6. (Optional) Add a memo description, if you want.
I don’t know what sort of memo description you would add for a
deposit. Sorry. A bank deposit is a bank deposit. At least to me.
Figure 5-7:
The
Payments
to Deposit
dialog box.
119
Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough

If you need to redisplay the Payments to Deposit dialog box — maybe
you made a mistake or something, and now you need to go back and fix
it — click the Payments button. Note, though, that QuickBooks won’t
display the Payments to Deposit dialog box unless the undeposited
funds list still has undeposited payments in it.
7. Specify the cash back amount.
If you want cash back from the deposit, activate the Cash Back Goes To
drop-down list box and select a cash account. Then enter a memo in the
Cash Back Memo text box and the amount of cash back you’re taking in
the Cash Back Amount text box.
8. Record the deposit.
Click Save & Close or Save & New. If you click Save & New, QuickBooks
displays a new blank Make Deposits window.
If you sometimes take cash from the register or from the day’s collections to
spend on business supplies, for COD payments, and even for salaries, you
enter the cash payment transaction as another transaction line in the Make
Deposits window shown in Figure 5-8. For example, if you use $50 from the
cash register to pay for office supplies from Acme Office Store, you would
enter another line into the Make Deposits window. You would enter Acme
Office Store into the Received From column, your office supplies expense
account into the From Account column, and –50 into the Amount column.

Deposits
window.

Improving Your Cash Inflow
I’m not going to provide a lengthy discussion on how to go about collecting
cash from your customers. I do, however, want to quickly tell you about 
a couple of other things. You need to know how to monitor what your cus-
tomers owe you and how to assess finance charges. Don’t worry, though.
I explain these two things as briefly as I can.
Tracking what your customers owe
You can track what a customer owes in a couple of ways. Probably the simplest
method is to display the Customer Detail Center for the customer. To do so,
choose Customers➪Customer Detail Center. QuickBooks whips up a page that
lists open invoices for the customer and recent payments received from the
customer. It also shows the customer’s contact information. Figure 5-9 shows
the Customer Detail Center for a customer.
Figure 5-9:
The
Customer
Detail
Center.
121
Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough

You also should be aware that QuickBooks provides several nifty accounts
receivable, or A/R, reports. You get to these reports by choosing Reports➪
Customers & Receivables. QuickBooks then displays a submenu of about half
a dozen reports that describe how much money customers owe you. Some
reports, for example, organize open invoices into different groups based on
how old the invoices are. (These reports are called agings.) Some reports sum-
marize only invoices or payments. And some reports show each customer’s
open, or unpaid, balance.
In Chapter 14, I describe, in general terms, how you go about producing and
printing QuickBooks reports. So refer to Chapter 14 if you have questions. Let
me also say that you can’t hurt anything or foul up your financial records just
by printing reports. So go ahead and noodle around.
You can print a statement to send to a customer by choosing Customers➪
Create Statements. Use the Select Statements to Print dialog box to describe
which customers you want to print statements for and the date ranges you
want the statements to show, and then click OK to print the statements.
Statements are a handy way to remind forgetful customers or clients about
overdue amounts. You don’t, by the way, need to send statements to every-
body or every month. In my CPA practice, I send out statements a couple of
times a year to clients with past-due accounts. This friendly reminder always
produces a handful of quick payments and friendly apologies.
Assessing finance charges
I wasn’t exactly sure where to stick this discussion of finance charges. But
finance charges seem to relate to collecting the cash your customers owe, so
I figure that I’m okay talking about assessing finance charges here.
To assess finance charges, follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences.
To be able to assess finance charges, you need to first set them up.
Only the QuickBooks administrator can change the company finance
charge settings, and he or she can do so only in single-user mode.
To set up finance charges, choose Edit➪Preferences. Then click the
Finance Charge icon in the list on the left and click the Company
Preferences tab.
QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 5-10. (If
you’ve assessed finance charges before, QuickBooks displays the Assess
Finance Charges window. You can display the Preferences dialog box and
check or edit your finance charge settings by clicking the Settings button
in the Assess Finance Charges window.)

Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough
Using QuickBooks to write a letter
With QuickBooks Pro, you can seamlessly inte-
grate your QuickBooks data to create collection
letters in Microsoft Word. You can also use the
QuickBooks business letter templates to speed
up the process of writing business letters. To
have QuickBooks help you write a letter, choose
Company➪Write Letters. Then click the option
button for the type of letter you want to create
or edit and click Next.
If you’re creating a collection letter, you can
specify which customers and jobs you want
QuickBooks to search for money owed to you.
You can tell QuickBooks whether you want to
create a separate letter for each customer who
owes you money or each job on which you’re
owed money. You can also specify the limit 
for how overdue an invoice must be to warrant 
a collection letter. After you set the parame-
ters and click Next, QuickBooks searches for
overdue invoices that fit your criteria.
If you’re creating a type of letter other than 
a collection letter, QuickBooks offers many
choices based on whether you’re sending the
letter to a customer, a vendor, an employee, or
someone else. For example, you can create
credit approval, credit denial, or credit request
letters. You can create birthday or apology let-
ters. And you can create faxes or bounced
check letters, just to name a few.
After you specify the information about the type
of letter that you want to create, QuickBooks
asks you a few questions about how you want
to sign the letter. It then creates the letter and
displays it in Microsoft Word so that you can
edit the letter as necessary and then print or
save it.

2. Enter the annual interest rate that you want to use to calculate finance
charges.
Move the cursor to the Annual Interest Rate (%) text box and enter the
annual interest rate.
3. (Optional) Enter the minimum finance charge — if one exists.
Move the cursor to the Minimum Finance Charge text box and enter the
minimum charge. If you always charge at least $2.00 on a past due
invoice, for example, type 2.
4. Enter the number of days of grace that you give.
Days of Grace. That sounds kind of like an artsy movie or serious novel,
doesn’t it? Basically, this number is how many days of slack you’re will-
ing to cut people. If you type 3 in the Grace Period (Days) text box,
QuickBooks doesn’t start assessing finance charges until three days
after the invoice is past due.
5. Specify which account you want to use to track the finance charges.
Activate the Finance Charge Account drop-down list and select an
account. Finance charges are, essentially, interest that you charge your
customers. So unless you have some other account that you want to
use, you may just want to use the Interest Income account that appears
on most of the standard charts of accounts.
6. Indicate whether you want to charge finance charges on finance
charges.
Does this statement make sense? If you charge somebody a finance
charge and they don’t pay the finance charge, eventually it becomes
past due, too. So then what do you do the next time you assess finance
charges? Do you calculate a finance charge on the finance charge? If you
want to do this — and if state and local laws let you — check the Assess
Finance Charges on Overdue Finance Charges check box.
7. Tell QuickBooks whether it should calculate finance charges from the
due date or the invoice date.
Select either the Due Date or Invoice/Billed Date option button. As you
may guess, you calculate bigger finance charges if you start accruing
interest on the invoice date.
8. Tell QuickBooks whether it should print finance charge invoices.
Check the box for Mark Finance Charge Invoices “To Be Printed” if you
want to print invoices later for the finance charges that you calculate.
9. Click OK.
After you use the Preferences dialog box to tell QuickBooks how the
finance charges should be calculated, click OK.
124
Part II: Daily Chores 

10. Choose Customers➪Assess Finance Charges.
Or, alternatively, select Customers from the Navigators list and click the
Finance Charges icon. The Assess Finance Charges window appears, as
shown in Figure 5-11. This window shows all the finance charges that
QuickBooks has calculated, organized by customer.
11. Give the finance charge assessment date.
Move the cursor to the Assessment Date text box and enter the date
when you’re assessing the finance charges, which I’m willing to bet is
the current date. (This date is also the invoice date that will be used on
the finance charge invoices, if you create them.)
12. Confirm which customers you want to be assessed finance charges.
QuickBooks initially marks all the finance charges, which means that it
sets up a new invoice for each finance charge. (QuickBooks marks
finance charges with a little check mark.) If you want to unmark (or later
mark) a finance charge, click it. To unmark all the charges, click the
Unmark All button. To mark all the charges, click the Mark All button.
You can produce a collections report for any of the customers or jobs
listed in the Assess Finance Charges window by selecting the customer
name and then clicking the Collection History button.
13. Indicate whether you want finance charge invoices to be printed.
If you do, check the Mark Invoices “To Be Printed” check box.
Figure 5-11:

Finance
Charges

Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough

14. Click Assess Charges.
When the Assess Finance Charges window correctly describes the
finance charges that you want to assess, click Assess Charges. You’re
finished with the finance charge calculations and assessments.
I’m not going to describe how to print invoices containing finance
charges because I already slogged through invoice printing in pains-
taking detail in Chapter 4. If you have questions about how to print 
the invoices, you may want to visit that chapter.
126
Part II: Daily Chores 
A word of advice from an accountant
While I’m on the subject of tracking what your
customers owe you, let me share a thought
about collecting this money. You should have
firm collection procedures that you follow faith-
fully. For example, as soon as an invoice is a
week or so past due, it’s very reasonable to
place a friendly telephone call to the customer’s
accounts payable department and verify that
the customer has received the invoice and is in
the process of paying. You have no reason to be
embarrassed because some customer is late in
paying you! What’s more, you may find out
something surprising and essential to your col-
lection. You may discover, for example, that the
customer didn’t receive the invoice. Or you may
find out that something was wrong with the
gizmo you sold or the service you provided.
As soon as an invoice is a month or so past due,
you need to crank up the pressure. A firm letter
asking that the customer call you to explain the
past due amount is very reasonable — espe-
cially if the customer assured you only a few
weeks ago that payment was forthcoming.
When an invoice is a couple of months past due,
you need to get pretty serious. You’ll probably
want to stop selling the customer anything more
because it’s unclear whether you’ll be paid. And
you may want to start a formal collection
process. (Ask your attorney about starting such
a process.)

Paying Bills
In This Chapter
 Using the Write Checks window to pay bills
 Using the accounts payable method to pay bills
 Deleting and editing bill payments
 Reminding yourself to pay bills
 Tracking vehicle mileage
 Paying sales tax
QuickBooks gives you two ways to pay and record your bills. And you have
many options when it comes to deciding when to pay your bills, how to
pay your bills, and how to record your bills for the purposes of tracking inven-
tory and expenses.
In this chapter, I explain not only how to pay vendor bills but also how to pay
that all-important bill that so many businesses owe to their state and local
governments. I’m talking, of course, about sales tax.
Pay Now or Pay Later?
When it comes to paying bills, you have a fundamental choice to make. You
can either record and pay your bills simultaneously, or you can record your
bills as they come in but then pay them as they’re due. The first method is
easiest, as you may guess, because you do everything at once. The second
method, called the accounts payable method, gives you more accurate finan-
cial records and makes for more precise management of your cash and out-
standing bills.
If you have a small business with little overhead, you may just as well 
record and pay bills simultaneously. But if you need precise measurement 
of your expenses and bills — if you want to use what’s termed accrual-basis
accounting — you should use the accounts payable method of paying bills. I
should note, too, that using the accounts payable method with QuickBooks is
not as difficult as it may seem at first.

And now you’re ready to begin. In the next section of this chapter, I describe
how to pay bills by writing checks. A little later in the chapter, in the
“Recording Your Bills the Accounts Payable Way” section, you find out how to
pay bills by using the accounts payable method.
Recording Your Bills by Writing Checks
When you record bills by writing checks, you’re doing cash-basis accounting.
In a nutshell, this means that you count bills as expenses when you write the
check to pay the bill.
I talk a little bit about cash-basis accounting in Appendix B. But let me say
here that a tradeoff is implicit in the choice to use cash-basis accounting. If
you use cash-basis accounting — which is what I do in my little business —
you greatly simplify your bookkeeping. But you lose precision in your mea-
surement of your expenses. And you don’t keep track of your unpaid bills
inside QuickBooks. They just stack up in a pile next to your desk.
As long as you understand this tradeoff and are comfortable with it, you’re
ready to begin using this method, which you do by following the steps pro-
vided in the paragraphs that follow.
The slow way to write checks
You can write checks either from the register or from the Write Checks
window. Using the Write Checks window is the slow way, but it enables you to
record your expenses and the items (if any) that you purchase. Using the
Write Checks window is the best choice in the following situations:
 You’re paying for an inventory item.
 You’re paying for something for which you have a purchase order.
 You plan to be reimbursed for the bill that you’re paying.
 You want to record what job or class this bill falls under.
To use the Write Checks window to write checks, follow these steps:
1. Choose Banking➪Write Checks.
Alternatively, select Banking from the Navigators list and then click the
Checks icon. The Write Checks window appears, as shown in Figure 6-1.
Notice that this window has three parts:
128
Part II: Daily Chores 

• The check part on the top, which you no doubt recognize from
having written thousands of checks in the past.
• The buttons on the top and bottom.
• The Expenses and Items tabs near the bottom of the window. This
part is for recording what the check is for, as I explain in Steps 7, 8,
and 9.
2. Click the Bank Account drop-down list and choose the account from
which you want to write this check.
This step is very important if you have more than one account. Make
sure that you choose the correct account; otherwise, your account bal-
ances in QuickBooks will be incorrect.
3. Specify the check date.
Click in the Date box and type the check date. I don’t keep reminding you
about this, but because I’m still in the early part of this book, remember
that you can enter today’s date by pressing the T key. You can also click
the button to the right of the Date box to get a pop-up calendar. To select
a date from the pop-up calendar, click the calendar day that you want 
to use.
Figure 6-1:
The Write
Checks
window.
129
Chapter 6: Paying Bills

4. Fill in the Pay to the Order Of line.
If you’ve written a check to this person or party before, the AutoFill fea-
ture fills in the name of the payee in the Pay to the Order Of line for you
after you start typing the name. (AutoFill does so by comparing what
you type with names shown in the Customer, Vendor, Employee, and
Other Names lists.) AutoFill also puts the payee’s address in the Address
box. The AutoRecall feature can even fill out the entire check for you,
based on the last check that you wrote to this vendor. (You can enable
AutoRecall by choosing Edit➪Preferences, clicking the General icon, and
selecting the Automatically Recall Last Transaction for This Name box
on the My Preferences tab.)
Does the check look all right? Maybe all you need to do is tab around,
adjusting numbers. Otherwise, read the next 12 steps. (Another 12-step
program?) In these steps, I explain how to record information about a
new vendor and pay a check to that vendor in one fell swoop.
If you’ve never paid anything to this person before, the program dis-
plays a Name Not Found message box after you enter the name on the
Pay to the Order Of line. You can either click Quick Add or Set Up to add
the payee name to one of your lists. (To find out how to do so, check out
the “To Quick Add or to Set Up?” sidebar, elsewhere in this chapter.)
5. Type the amount of the check.
Now comes my favorite part. I’ve always found it a big bother to write
out the amount of checks. I mean, if you write a check for $21,457.00,
how do you fit twenty-one thousand, four hundred fifty-seven dollars,
and no cents on the line? Where do you put those hyphens, anyway?
All you have to do with QuickBooks is enter the amount next to the
dollar sign and press Tab. When you press Tab, QuickBooks writes out
the amount for you on the Dollars line. At moments like this, I’m grateful
to be alive in the twenty-first century when computer technology can do
these marvelous things for me.
6. (Optional) Fill in the Address text box.
You need to fill in this box only if the address isn’t there already and you
intend to send the check by mail in a window envelope.
7. (Optional) Fill in the Memo line.
You can put a message to the payee on the Memo line — a message such
as “Quit bleeding me dry.” But you usually put an account number on
the Memo line so that the payee can record your account number.
If you try to click Save & New and close the dialog box now, QuickBooks
tells you that you can’t and tries to bite your leg off. Why? Because you
can’t write a check unless you fill out the Expenses and Items tabs. You
use these tabs to describe what the check pays.
130
Part II: Daily Chores 

8. Move the cursor down to the Account column of the Expenses tab and
enter an expense account name.
Chances are that you want to enter the name of an account that’s
already on the chart of accounts. If that’s the case, move the cursor to a
field in the Account column, and QuickBooks turns the field into a drop-
down list box. Click the down arrow to see a list of all your accounts.
You’ll probably have to scroll down the list to get to the expense
accounts. Click the one that this check applies to (most likely it’s
Supplies or Rent). If you need to create a new expense account category
for this check, choose Add New from the top of the list to see the New
Account dialog box. Fill in the information and click OK.
What if the money that you’re paying out with this check can be distrib-
uted across two, three, or four expense accounts? Simply click below the
account that you just entered. The down arrow shoots down next to the
cursor. Click the down arrow and enter another expense account, and
another, and another, if you want to.
9. Tab over to the Amount column, if necessary, and change the num-
bers around.
If you’re distributing this check across more than one account, make
sure that the numbers in the Amount column correctly distribute the
check to the appropriate accounts. Figure 6-2 shows a completed check.
131
Chapter 6: Paying Bills
To Quick Add or to Set Up?
If you click Quick Add in the Name Not Found
message box, you see a Select Name Type mes-
sage box, asking whether the payee is a Vendor,
Customer, Employee, or Other. Most likely, the
payee is a vendor, in which case you click
Vendor (but you can, of course, click one of the
other three options). The address information
that you write on the check goes in the Vendor
list — or Customer, Employee, or Other Names
list, depending on what you clicked. (Refer to
Chapter 2 if you’re in the dark about adding to
your lists.)
Choosing Set Up in the Name Not Found mes-
sage box is a little more interesting. When you
choose this option, you also see the Select Name
Type box. Click Vendor, Customer, Employee, or
Other. Click OK, and then you see the New what-
ever window that you may remember from
Chapter 2, if you’ve already added new vendors,
customers, or employees to your lists.
By the way, my long-suffering technical editor,
Mike, wants me to point out that using the Quick
Add method is sort of lazy. With Quick Add,
QuickBooks only requires you to collect a min-
imal amount of information.

10. If you want to, enter words of explanation or encouragement in the
Memo column.
Someday, you may have to go back to this check and try to figure out what
these expenses mean. The Memo column may be your only clue. Enter
some wise words here: “August rent,” “copier repair,” or “company party.”
11. (Optional) Assign the expense to the Customer:Job column.
If you plan to be reimbursed for these expenses, or if you just want to
track your expenses by job, enter the name of the customer who is going
to reimburse you. Click the down arrow to find the customer. Enter an
amount for each customer or job, if necessary.
12. (Optional) Assign the expense to a class.
You also can track expenses by class by making entries in the Class
column. Notice the usual down arrow, which you click to see a list of
classes. You won’t see the Class column, however, unless you told
QuickBooks that you wanted to use classes when you created your com-
pany. (You created the company when you worked your way through the
EasyStep Interview; see Chapter 1.)
Figure 6-2:

pleted

Part II: Daily Chores 

If you want to have QuickBooks track expenses by class, you have to set
it up to do so. To set up QuickBooks to track expenses, choose Edit➪
Preferences. When QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box,
click the Accounting icon, click the Company Preferences tab, and then
mark the Use Class Tracking check box.
13. Use the Items tab to record what you’re purchasing.
You may be purchasing inventory items or may already have filled out a
purchase order for the items for which you’re paying. If so, click the
Items tab. If you don’t have a purchase order for the items, go on to Step
14. If you do have a purchase order for the items, click the Select PO
button to see a list of purchases on order with this vendor. Check those
for which you’re paying and click OK.
QuickBooks doesn’t show its purchase-order feature unless you told it
that you wanted to use purchase orders during the EasyStep Interview. 
If you now think you want to use them, choose Edit➪Preferences. When
QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box, click the Purchases &
Vendors button, click the Company Preferences tab, and then mark the
Inventory and Purchase Orders Are Active check box.
14. Move to the Item column and enter a name for the item.
Notice the down arrow in this column. Click the arrow to see the Items
list. Does the item that you’re paying for appear on this list? If so, click
it. If not, choose Add New from the top of the list and fill out the New
Item window. (Refer to Chapter 2.)
15. Fill in the rest of the rows of items on the Items tab.
You can enter all the items you’re purchasing on this tab. Make sure that
the Items tab accurately shows the items that you’re purchasing, their
cost, and the quantity.
When you finish adding items, you may want to use one of the following
options that appear in the Write Checks window:
• Click the Print button to print the check in the Write Checks window.
This option doesn’t print all the checks that you have written and
marked to be printed, however. (I explain how to print more than
one check at a time in Chapter 10.)
• The Clear Splits button deletes any individual amounts that you’ve
entered for separate expenses or items on the Expenses and Items
tabs. QuickBooks then enters the total amount of the check in the
Amount column on the Expenses tab.
• The Recalculate button totals the items and expenses in the window.
It also puts the total on both the numeric and text amount lines of
the check.
133
Chapter 6: Paying Bills

• The To Be Printed check box designates the check for printing.
Check this box if you want to print the check with QuickBooks by
using your printer and preprinted check forms. Uncheck this box if
you’re recording a handwritten check.
16. Click Save & New or Save & Close to finish writing the check.
Click Save & Close to tell QuickBooks that you want to save the check
and close the check form. Click Save & New to tell QuickBooks that you
want to save the check and then display another blank check form. If
you don’t want to save the check, close the dialog box and then click No
when QuickBooks asks if you want to save the check.
You can also use the Next and Previous buttons to move to previously
written checks or to a blank check form. If you write check number 101,
for example, clicking Next takes you to check 102 so that you can write
that one. (Clicking Previous moves you to check 100 in case you need to
edit a check you’ve written earlier.)
Well, that’s over with. For a minute there, I thought that it would never end. . . .
The fast way to write checks
If you want to pay a bill that isn’t for inventory or that you won’t be reim-
bursed for or that you don’t need to track in any way, shape, or form, you can
write your check directly from the Checking register. This method is the fast
and easy way to go; follow these steps:
1. Choose Banking➪Use Register.
Or, alternatively, select Banking from the Navigators list and then click
the Check Register icon. The Checking register appears, as shown in
Figure 6-3. (If you have more than one bank account, you have to select
the proper account from the drop-down list and click OK.) The cursor 
is at the end of the register, ready and waiting for you to enter check
information.
2. Fill in the information for the check.
Notice that the entries you make are the same ones that you would make
on a check. You need to note three things about the register:
• If you enter a Payee name that QuickBooks doesn’t recognize, you
see the Name Not Found message box, and you’re asked to give
information about this new, mysterious vendor. To see what to 
do next, go back to the preceding set of instructions on writing a
check the slow way.
• You have to choose an account name. Chances are, you can find the
right one in the Account drop-down list, but if you can’t, enter one
of your own. QuickBooks displays the Account Not Found message
box and asks you to fill in the information about this new account.
134
Part II: Daily Chores 

• To record a check that pays more than a single expense, click the
Splits button (shown in the bottom-left corner of the window) to
display a little box you can use to input multiple expense accounts
and amounts.
As you fill out the register, if you decide that you want to be reimbursed
for this check or that you want to track expenses and items, click the Edit
Transaction button. You see the Write Checks window that you know
from Figure 6-1. Follow Steps 3 through 14 in the preceding section on
how to write a check the slow way to fill in the Write Checks window.
When you finish filling in the Write Checks window, click Save & New.
You’re back where you started, in the register window.
3. When you finish filling in the check information, click Record.
You click Record, of course, to record the check.
By the way, if you realize that you’ve made a mistake and haven’t yet
clicked Record to record the check, you can click the Restore button to
go back to square one. Clicking Restore blanks out what you just entered
so that you can start over again.
If you want to print the check (or checks) that you’ve just entered, flip to
Chapter 10 for details. In the meantime, I give you the lowdown on keeping
your checkbook in Chapter 8 — so turn there if this discussion of checks has
you really excited.

Chapter 6: Paying Bills

Recording Your Bills the 
Accounts Payable Way
The accounts payable, or A/P, way of paying bills involves two steps. The first
is a trifle on the difficult side, and the second step is as easy as pie. First, you
record your bills. If you’ve read the section earlier in this chapter on writing
checks the slow way, you’re already familiar with using the Expenses tab and
the Items tab to record bills. You need to fill out those tabs for the A/P method
as well if you want to distribute a bill to accounts, customers, jobs, classes,
and items. If you’ve read the first half of this chapter, some of what follows will
be old hat.
After you record your bills, you can go on to the second step: telling
QuickBooks which bills to pay. QuickBooks then writes the checks. You 
print them. You mail them.
To make the A/P method work, you have to record your bills as they come in.
That doesn’t mean that you have to pay them right away. By recording your
bills, you can keep track of how much money you owe and how much money
your business really has. QuickBooks reminds you when your bills are due so
that you don’t have to worry about forgetting to pay a bill.
When you record bills the accounts payable way, you’re using accrual-basis
accounting. I explain accrual-basis accounting in Appendix B.
Recording your bills
When a bill comes in, the first thing to do is record it. You can record bills
through the Enter Bills window or the Accounts Payable register. If you plan
to track bills by expense and item, you need to use the Enter Bills window. I
describe that method first. If you have a simple bill to pay that doesn’t need
to be reimbursed or tracked, skip ahead to the “Paying Your Bills” section,
later in this chapter.
To record a bill through the Enter Bills window, follow these steps:
1. Choose Vendors➪Enter Bills.
Or, alternatively, select Vendors from the Navigators list and then click the
Enter Bills icon. Figure 6-4 shows the Enter Bills window. You no doubt
notice that the top half of this window looks a great deal like a check —
that’s because much of the information that you put here ends up on the
check that you write to pay your bill. (If you see the word Credit at the top
of the form rather than Bill, click the Bill option button in the top-left
corner. You also can use this screen to enter credit from vendors.)
136
Part II: Daily Chores 

2. Select the name of the vendor you’re paying.
If you want to pay this bill to a vendor who’s already on the Vendor list,
click the down arrow at the end of the Vendor line and choose the
vendor. (QuickBooks then automatically fills the Enter Bills window with
as much information as it can remember.) But if this vendor is new,
QuickBooks asks you to Quick Add or Set Up some information about
the vendor — the address, credit limit, payment terms, and so on. You
provide this information in the New Vendor window. If you’re not famil-
iar with this window, make a brief visit to Chapter 2.
If you have one or more unfilled purchase orders with the vendor you
select, QuickBooks asks you whether you want to receive against a
purchase order. Click Yes if you do or No if you don’t. If you choose 
to receive against a purchase order, QuickBooks displays the Open
Purchase Orders dialog box, shown in Figure 6-5. It lists the open pur-
chase orders you’ve recorded. When you select one or more purchase
orders to receive against, QuickBooks fills in the items and amounts
from these orders for you, which you can modify as necessary.
Figure 6-4:
The Enter
Bills
window.
137
Chapter 6: Paying Bills

Hey, you know what? I don’t talk about purchase orders until Chapter 7.
But here’s the CliffsNotes version: To create a purchase order, which 
is a record of items you order from vendors, choose Vendors➪Create
Purchase Orders. When QuickBooks displays the Create Purchase Orders
window, describe your order. You print and edit purchase orders, by the
way, in the same manner as you print invoices and credit memos.
3. Select the payment terms that describe when the bill is due.
In the Terms line, open the drop-down list and select the payment terms
(if the information isn’t already there from when you set up the vendor).
4. (Optional) Enter a memo to describe the bill.
You can enter a note in the Memo box. The note that you enter appears
on the A/P register.
5. Move the cursor down to the Account column of the Expenses tab and
enter an expense account name.
Chances are that you want to enter the name of an expense account
that’s already on the chart of accounts. If that’s the case, click the down
arrow to see a list of all your accounts. You probably have to scroll
down the list to get to the expense accounts (a fast way to move down
the list is to start typing the account name — you go straight down the
list). Click the account that this bill represents (most likely it’s Supplies
or something like that).
If you need to create a new expense account category for this bill, choose
Add New from the top of the list. You see the New Account dialog box. Fill
in the information and click OK.
What if the money that you’re paying out because of this bill can be split
among two, three, or four expense accounts? Simply click below the
account that you just entered. The down arrow appears. Click it to enter
another expense account, and another, and another, if you want to.
6. Tab over to the Amount column, if necessary, and change the numbers.
If you’re splitting this bill among several accounts, make sure that the
numbers in the Amount column add up to the total of the bill.
Figure 6-5:

138
Part II: Daily Chores 

7. (Optional) Enter words of explanation or wisdom in the Memo column.
8. (Optional) Assign the expense to a Customer:Job.
If you plan to be reimbursed for these expenses, or if you just want to
track your expenses by job, enter the customer who is going to reim-
burse you. Enter an amount for each account, if necessary. You can use
the down arrow to find customers and then click them.
9. (Optional) Assign the expense to a class.
You also can track expenses by class by making entries in the Class
column. Notice the usual down arrow and click it to see a list of classes.
(You don’t see a Class column unless you’ve told QuickBooks that you
want to use classes.)
If you want to have QuickBooks track expenses by class, you can set it
up to do so. To set up QuickBooks to track expenses, choose Edit➪
Preferences. When QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box,
click the Accounting icon, click the Company Preferences tab, and then
mark the Use Class Tracking check box.
If you want, click the Recalculate button to total the expenses.
10. Use the Items tab to record the various items that the bill represents.
Click the Items tab. Enter the items you purchased and the prices you
paid for them.
If you realize after partially completing the bill that the bill does indeed
pay a purchase order, click the Select PO button, which appears on the
Items tab of the Enter Bills window.
From the Vendor drop-down list, click the name of the vendor who sent
you the bill. In the list of open purchase orders, click in the column on
the left to put a check next to the purchase order (or orders) for which
you’re paying. Easy enough? Click OK when you’re done, and
QuickBooks fills out the Items tab for you automatically.
11. Move to the Item column and enter a name for the item.
Notice the down arrow in this column. Click it to see the Item list. Does
the item that you’re paying for appear on this list? If so, click that item. If
not, choose Add New from the top of the list and fill out the New Item
window (refer to Chapter 2).
12. Fill in the rest of the rows of items on the Items tab.
You can enter all the items you’re purchasing here. Make sure that the
Items tab accurately shows the items that you’re purchasing, their costs,
and their quantities. If you want to, click the Recalculate button to total
the items.
13. Save the bill.
Click Save & New to save your record of the bill and then enter another
bill. Or click Save & Close to record your bill but not enter another bill.
139
Chapter 6: Paying Bills

Entering your bills the fast way
You also can enter bills directly in the Accounts Payable register. This
method is faster, but it makes tracking expenses and items more difficult.
If you want to enter bills directly in the Accounts Payable register, follow
these steps:
1. Choose Lists➪Chart of Accounts.
The chart of accounts opens.
2. Open the Accounts Payable account.
When QuickBooks displays your chart of accounts, double-click the
Accounts Payable account in the list. You see the Accounts Payable
register window, shown in Figure 6-6. The cursor is at the end of the
register, ready and waiting for you to enter the next bill.
3. Fill in the information for your bill.
Enter the same information that you would if you were filling in the Enter
Bills window that I describe at the beginning of this chapter. In the Vendor
text box, click the down arrow and choose a name from the Vendor list.
Figure 6-6:
The
Accounts
Payable
register
window.
140
Part II: Daily Chores 

If you enter a vendor name that QuickBooks doesn’t recognize, you see
the Vendor Not Found message box, and QuickBooks asks you to give
information about this new, mysterious vendor. Either click Quick Add 
to have the program collect the information from the register as you fill
it out or click Set Up to see the New Vendor dialog box. (I describe the
choice between Quick Add and Set Up in the “To Quick Add or to Set
Up?” sidebar, elsewhere in this chapter. I explain how to set up new
vendors in Chapter 2.)
You have to choose an account name. You can probably find the right
one in the Account drop-down list, but if you can’t, enter one of your
own. You see the Account Not Found message box, and QuickBooks asks
you to fill in information about this new account.
If you decide as you fill out the register that you want to be reimbursed for
this check or that you want to track expenses and items, choose the Edit
Transaction button to see the Enter Bills window. (Refer to Figure 6-4.)
Follow Steps 2 through 12 in the “Recording your bills” section (earlier 
in this chapter) to fill in the Enter Bills window. When you finish filling in 
the window, click Save & New. You’re back where you started — in the
Accounts Payable window.
4. When you fill in all the information, click Record.
The Restore button, located just right of Record, is there in case you fill
out the register but decide that you want to start all over again before
you’ve recorded the transaction. Click Restore to clear the information
on-screen, and you have a clean slate.
Deleting a bill
Suppose that you accidentally enter the same bill twice or enter a bill that
was really meant for the business next door. (Just because you’re tracking
bills by computer doesn’t mean that you don’t have to look over the things
carefully anymore.) Here’s how to delete a bill that you entered in the
Accounts Payable register:
1. Locate the bill in the Accounts Payable register by using one of the
following methods:
• If you know roughly what day you entered the bill, you can scroll
through the list to find it. The entries are listed in date order. (Click
the 1-Line check box to display each bill on one line rather than on
two lines to make the scrolling go faster.)
• If you don’t remember the date, use the Edit menu’s Simple Find
command.
And now, back to the Accounts Payable register window that you have in
progress. . . .
141
Chapter 6: Paying Bills

2. Select the bill that you want to delete by putting the cursor anywhere
in the bill.
3. Choose Edit➪Delete Bill.
QuickBooks confirms that you really, truly want to delete the transac-
tion, and if you click OK, it dutifully deletes the bill from the A/P register.
Remind me to pay that bill, will you?
You can tie a string around your finger, but the best way to make sure that
you pay your bills on time is to have QuickBooks remind you. In fact, you can
make the Reminders message box the first thing that you see when you start
QuickBooks.
To adjust the QuickBooks reminder options, you must be logged on as the
administrator in single-user mode. Then choose the Edit➪Preferences com-
mand. When QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box, click the
Reminders icon from the list on the left and then click the Company
Preferences tab to access the dialog box shown in Figure 6-7. See the ninth
item on the list: Bills to Pay.
Make sure that its Show Summary or Show List option button is marked, and
then give yourself several days’ notice before you need to pay bills by typing
a number (10 is the default and usually works well) in the Days Before Due
Date text box, in the Remind Me column.
142
Part II: Daily Chores 
Using the Find dialog box
When you can’t remember the information you
need to find a particular entry or transaction,
you can search for the information by using the
Find dialog box. For example, if you can’t recall
when you entered the bill, choose Edit➪
Advanced Find to open the Find dialog box.
Choose a filter (the category to search by). The
box to the right changes to include drop-down
list boxes or text boxes that you can use to
specify what you want to search for.
Choose as many filters as you like, but be careful
to enter information accurately, or QuickBooks
will look for the wrong information. Also, try to
strike a balance, choosing only as many filters 
as you really need to find your information. The
more filters you choose, the more searching
QuickBooks does, and the longer the search
takes.
After you finish choosing filters, click the Find
button, and the transactions that match all your
filters appear in the list at the bottom of the
window. Click the transaction that you want to
examine more closely and then click Go To.
QuickBooks opens the appropriate window and
takes you right to the transaction. Very snazzy, I
do believe.

If you click the Show Summary option (the first button to the right of 
the option), you get a summary of the bills you owe each time you start
QuickBooks. If you choose Show List (the second button to the right of the
option), you get the details about each bill.
Be sure to review the Reminders window when you start QuickBooks or open
a new company file. The window lists reminders (like forms you need to print
and payments you need to transmit) and tells you which unpaid bills you’re
supposed to pay. You can see this list by choosing Company➪Reminders.
Paying Your Bills
If you’ve done everything right and recorded your bills correctly, writing
checks is a snap. Just follow these steps:
1. Choose Vendors➪Pay Bills.
Or, alternatively, select Vendors from the Navigators list and then click
the Pay Bills icon. You see the Pay Bills window, shown in Figure 6-8.
2. Change the Payment Date box (in the lower-right corner) to the date
that you want to appear on the checks.
By default, this box shows today’s date. If you want another date on the
payment check — for example, if you’re postdating the check — change
this date. (See the Cheat Sheet at the beginning of this book for some
secret date-editing codes.)
Figure 6-7:
The
Preferences
dialog box.
143
Chapter 6: Paying Bills

3. Set a cutoff date for showing bills.
In the Show Bills Due On or Before date box, tell QuickBooks which bills
to show by entering a date. If you want to see all the bills, click the Show
All Bills option button.
4. Use the Sort Bills By drop-down list box to tell QuickBooks how to
sort the bills.
You can arrange bills by due date with the oldest bills listed first, arrange
them alphabetically by vendor, or arrange them from largest to smallest.
5. Identify which bills to pay.
If you want to pay all the bills in the dialog box, click the Select All Bills
button. If you want to clear all the bills you’ve marked, click the Clear
Selections button. If you want to pick and choose, click to the left of the
bill’s due date to pay the bill. A check mark appears where you click.
Note that after you apply a payment, the Clear Selections button
replaces the Select All Bills button.
6. Change the Amt. To Pay figure if you want to pay only part of a bill.
That’s right, you can pay only part of a bill by changing the number in
the Amt. To Pay column. (Of course, they can always just send you
another bill. . . .)
Figure 6-8:
The Pay
Bills
window.
144
Part II: Daily Chores 

7. Get the early payment discount rate on your bills, if any.
You may be eligible for an early payment discount on some bills. To find
out how much of a discount you get, click the Amt. To Pay field and then
click the Set Discount button to see the Discount tab of the Discounts &
Credits dialog box. Use the Discount tab’s Amount of Discount box to
give the dollar amount of the discount. Use the Discount tab’s Discount
Account box for specifying which account should be used for recording
the money saved through the discount.
8. Get a list of credit memos that you can apply to the payment.
Click the Set Credits button to see the Credits tab of the Discount &
Credits dialog box. If you want to use one of the credits listed to reduce
the amount of the bill, click it and then click Done.
9. Choose a payment method.
Use the Payment Method drop-down list box to select the payment
method you want to use: Check or Credit Card. If you have more than
one checking account or credit card account, click the down arrow next
to the drop-down list box and choose the account that you want to use.
If you’ve subscribed to and set up the QuickBooks online bill payment
feature, you have another payment method choice, online payment. I
describe making online payments in Chapter 11.
10. If you plan to print the check, click the To Be Printed option button.
Many businesses use QuickBooks to keep track of checks, but instead 
of printing the checks, they write them by hand. If your business uses
this method, select the Assign Check No. option button. Then, when
QuickBooks asks how it should number the check, either give the
number by typing it into the appropriate box or tell QuickBooks to auto-
matically number the check.
11. Click Pay & Close to pay the bills and close the Pay Bills window.
Or, alternatively, click Pay & New to enter more bills. Regardless,
QuickBooks goes into the Accounts Payable register and notes that you
paid these bills; it then goes into the Checking register and “writes” the
checks. Figures 6-9 and 6-10 show you exactly what I mean.
QuickBooks shows the original bill amount as the amount that’s paid,
not the original bill amount minus the early payment discount. It needs
to use this method to completely pay off the bill.
In the Accounts Payable register, you see BILLPMT in the Type column and
the amount paid in the Paid column. The Due Date and Billed columns are
now empty.
In the Checking register, you again see BILLPMT in the Type column.

Part II: Daily Chores 

But don’t kid yourself — these bills aren’t really paid yet. Sure, they’re paid in
the mind of QuickBooks, but the mind of QuickBooks extends only as far as
the metal (or trendy plastic) box that holds your computer. You still have to
write or print the checks and deliver them to the payees.
If you’re going to write the checks by hand, enter the check numbers from
your own checkbook into the QuickBooks Checking register’s Number
column. You want these numbers to jibe, not jive. (I know, a pun is the lowest
form of humor.)
If you plan to print the checks, see Chapter 10.
Tracking Vehicle Mileage
QuickBooks includes a vehicle mileage-tracking feature that lets you track your
business miles. To track vehicle mileage in QuickBooks, choose Company➪
Enter Vehicle Mileage. Then in the Enter Vehicle Mileage dialog box that
appears, record the vehicle, date, miles driven, odometer settings, and reason
for the trip.
May I briefly tell you the IRS rules for deducting business miles? Essentially,
you have two approaches you can choose from. The easiest method — and
the one that I use because I’m lazy — is to record as a business expense an
amount per business mile driven. The rate per mile is roughly $0.35 — which
is far less than the actual cost of driving most cars. But, hey, that’s the price
of slothfulness.
The hard method for tracking business miles is to track all your vehicle
expenses — including gas, oil, repairs, insurance, and vehicle depreciation —
and then record as a business expense the business use portion of these
expenses.
To get the business-use portion of your vehicle, you use the ratio of business
miles to total miles. For example, if over the year you drive 6,000 business
miles and your total miles are 12,000, your business-use percentage equals 50
percent. In this case, you could record as a business expense 50 percent of
your vehicle expenses.
Usually with the hard “actual expenses” method, you get a higher business
vehicle expense deduction, but you should note that the IRS limits the
amount you can include as vehicle depreciation. So you don’t get as high a
deduction as you might at first think. (You may want to consult your tax advi-
sor for details.)
No matter which method you use, you want a record of your actual business
miles, which the Enter Vehicle Mileage command lets you do. By law, you
need a good record of business mileage to legitimately claim the deduction.
147
Chapter 6: Paying Bills

Paying the Sales Tax
To ingratiate itself with you retailers, QuickBooks includes a special dialog
box for paying sales tax. However, to use this dialog box, you have to have
sales tax items or a sales tax group already set up. See Chapter 2 for a thor-
ough explanation of items and groups.
To see how much sales tax you owe and to write checks to government agen-
cies in one fell swoop, choose Vendors➪Sales Tax➪Pay Sales Tax to access
the Pay Sales Tax dialog box, shown in Figure 6-11. Or, alternatively, select
Vendors from the Navigators list and then click the Pay Sales Tax icon.
This dialog box is similar to the Pay Bills window. (Refer to Figure 6-8.) The
buttons basically work the same way.
Put a check mark in the Pay column next to all the items that you want to pay
by clicking in the Pay column. Checks are written automatically in the
Checking register. Your payments are likewise recorded in the Sales Tax
Payable register.
A Quick Word on the Vendor 
Details Window
If you choose Vendor➪Vendor Detail Center, QuickBooks displays a window
that summarizes a bunch of information about the vendor in question. This
feature doesn’t actually provide you with new information. But — and this is
noteworthy — it does give you a slick way to get all the information you have
regarding a particular vendor. Note that you can select which vendor’s infor-
mation appears in the Vendor Detail window by selecting the vendor from the
drop-down list box that appears at the top of the window.

or small and growing businesses, inventory is one of the toughest assets
to manage. First, of course, you need to physically care for stuff. Second,
you’ve got to make sure that you don’t run out of some item or have too
much of some other item.
QuickBooks isn’t, unfortunately, all that sophisticated in its inventory manage-
ment features. But it is easy to use. And with a little jiggering, you can probably
get it to work in any simple case. (The one tricky part that I talk about a little
later in the chapter is what you can do when you keep inventory in multiple
locations. But I’m going to hold off on that discussion for a bit. That’d be like
jumping off the deep end of the dock before you’ve learned to swim.)
Setting Up Inventory Items
Before you can track your inventory, you need to do two things. First, you
need to tell QuickBooks that you want to track inventory. To do this, choose
Edit➪Preferences. When QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box,
click the Purchases & Vendors icon from the list on the left. Your screen
should look remarkably similar to the one in Figure 7-1. (You may have to
click the Company Preferences tab first.) Make sure that the Inventory and
Purchase Orders Are Active box and the Warn if Not Enough Inventory
Quantity on Hand (QOH) to Sell box are checked.

To make changes to company preferences, you must open the QuickBooks
file in single-user mode as the administrator.
Here’s the second thing you need: an Item list. This list is a description of all
items that you may conceivably put on an invoice. In other words, all items
that you order and sell belong on the Item list.
You should have set up your initial Item list in the EasyStep Interview. If you
need to add an item to your list, choose Lists➪Item List. Then click the Item
button, choose New from the drop-down menu, and fill in the New Item
window. If you want the blow-by-blow, go to Chapter 2 and get it straight from
the horse’s mouth. (Wait a second — did I just say that?)
After the inventory stuff is turned on and your Item list is set up and is up-to-
date, you can track your inventory.
When You Buy Stuff
As you unload items from a truck, receive them in the mail, or buy them from
a street peddler, you have to record the items so that QuickBooks can track
your inventory. How you record the items and pay for them depends on
whether you pay cash on the barrelhead, receive a bill along with the items, or
receive the items without a bill (in which case you’ll pay for the items later).
And you may have filled out a purchase order for the items that you’re receiv-
ing. If that’s the case, receiving the items gets a little easier. If you receive
items for which you’ve already filled out a purchase order, see the section
“How Purchase Orders Work,” later in this chapter. I strongly recommend fil-
ling out a purchase order when you order items that you’re going to receive
and pay for later.

Recording items that you pay for upfront
Okay, you just bought three porcelain chickens in the bazaar at Marrakech,
and now you want to add them to your inventory and record the purchase.
How do you record inventory you paid for over the counter? By using the
Write Checks window, of course — the same way you record any other bills
you pay for upfront. Just make sure that you fill out the Items column as I
describe in Chapter 6.
Recording items that don’t 
come with a bill
What happens if the items come before the invoice? Lucky you, you have the
stuff, and you don’t have to pay for it yet. However, you do have to record the
inventory you just received so that you know you have it on hand. You can’t
do that in the Write Checks window because you won’t be writing a check to
pay for the stuff — at least not for a while. How do you record items that you
receive before paying for them? Read on:
1. Choose Vendors➪Receive Items.
Or select Vendors from the Navigators list and click the Receive Items
icon. You see the Create Item Receipts window, shown in Figure 7-2. This
window is similar to the Enter Bills window (described in Chapter 6). (You
see the Enter Bills window again when you receive the bill for items.)
2. Fill in the top part of the window.
If you want to record items from a vendor who’s already on the Vendor
list, click the down arrow and choose the vendor. If the vendor is a new
vendor, choose Add New from the list and click Set Up to set up informa-
tion about the vendor — the address, the credit limit, payment terms,
and so on. You enter the information in the New Vendor dialog box.
3. Click the Items tab.
You need to click the Items tab only if it isn’t already displayed. It proba-
bly is. But the computer book writers’ code of honor and a compulsive
personality require me to tell you that there’s another tab — the
Expenses tab — and it could possibly be displayed instead.
4. Move to the Item column and type a name for the item.
Notice the down arrow in the Item column. Click it to see the Item list.
Does the item that you’re paying for appear on this list? If so, click it. If
not, enter a new item name. You see the Item Not Found message box.
Click Set Up and fill out the New Item dialog box. (See Chapter 2 for help
with describing new items.)
151
Chapter 7: Inventory Magic

You may just as well go down the packing slip, entering the items on the
Items tab. Make sure that the Items tab accurately shows what’s on the
packing slip. And put a brief description of the items in the Memo field
because that description may prove useful later when you want to
match up your item receipt with the bill. When you finish, the Create
Item Receipts window should look something like what you see in 
Figure 7-2, earlier in this chapter.
5. Click Save & New or Save & Close to record the items you just received.
Now the items are officially part of your inventory. The item receipt has
been entered on the Accounts Payable register. And not only that, but
you’re all ready for when the bill comes.
Paying for items when you get the bill
The items arrive, and you fill out an item receipt. Three weeks pass. What’s
this in your mailbox? Why, it’s the bill, of course! Now you have to enter a bill
for the items that you received three weeks ago. This job is easy:
Figure 7-2:
The Create
Item
Receipts

152
Part II: Daily Chores 

1. Choose Vendors➪Enter Bill for Received Items.
Or select Vendors from the Navigators list and click the Receive Bill
icon. The Select Item Receipt dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-3.
2. Click the Vendor drop-down list and choose the name of the vendor
who sent you the bill.
You see one or more item receipts in the box, with the date you put on
the receipt, its reference number, and the memo that you wrote on the
receipt.
3. Select the item receipt for which you want to enter a bill and click OK.
The Enter Bills window, shown in Figure 7-4, appears. Does this informa-
tion look familiar? It should — it’s the same information that you put in
the Create Item Receipts window, only now you’re working with a bill,
not a receipt.
4. Compare the Items tab in the window with the bill.
Are you paying for what you received earlier? Shipping charges and
sales tax may have been added to your bill. You may also need to adjust
the price because you may have been guessing when you recorded
receiving the items. If so, add and adjust the original receipt information
using the Items tab. (You can click the Recalculate button to add the
new items.)
How many days do you have to pay this bill? Is it due now? Take a look
at the Terms line to see what this vendor’s payment terms are. Change
the payment terms if they’re incorrect by selecting a different entry from
the drop-down list. Remember, you want to pay your bills at the best
possible time, but to do so, the terms in the Enter Bills window must
match the vendor’s payment terms.
5. Click Save & New or Save & Close to record the bill.
Of course, you still need to pay the vendor’s bill. Fair enough. Take a
look at Chapter 6 if you need help.

Chapter 7: Inventory Magic

Recording items and paying 
the bill all at once
Suppose that you receive the bill when you receive the goods. The items are
unloaded from the elephant’s back, and the elephant driver takes a bow and
hands you the bill. Here are the steps you follow:
1. Choose Vendors➪Receive Items and Enter Bill.
Or select Vendors from the Navigators list and click the Receive Items
with Bill icon. You see the Enter Bills window. (Refer to Figure 7-4.) If
you’ve been reading this chapter from its beginning, you’re familiar with
this window, and you know exactly what it is and what it does. If you
landed cold turkey on this page by way of the index, you need to know,
for inventory purposes, how to record the items you’re paying for.
2. Fill out the top part of the window.
This stuff is pretty basic. Choose a vendor from the drop-down list and
make sure that the vendor’s terms for paying this bill are shown correctly.
If this vendor is new, choose Add New. QuickBooks asks you to fill in an
information dialog box about the vendor. Do it. See that you fill out the Bill
Due line correctly.
Figure 7-4:
The Enter
Bills
window.
154
Part II: Daily Chores 

3. Click the Items tab and list all the items that you’re paying for.
To see the Item list, move the cursor to the Item column and click the
down arrow that appears. Make sure that the quantity and cost of the
items are listed correctly on the Items tab.
4. Click Save & New or Save & Close.
QuickBooks adds the items you listed to the Item list and makes them an
official part of your inventory.
When You Sell Stuff
In Chapter 4, I tell you how to list the items on the invoice. Maybe you noticed
the similarities between the Items tab in the Enter Bills window and the
Quantity/Item Code/Description/Price Each/Amount box at the bottom of 
an invoice. QuickBooks uses both for keeping inventory.
When you sell stuff, QuickBooks automatically adjusts your inventory. In
other words, if you buy 400 porcelain chickens and sell 350 of them, you have
only 50 on hand. QuickBooks updates records for this change. No muss, no
fuss. Gosh, isn’t this great? No more lying awake at night, wondering whether
you have enough chickens or wombats or whatever. The same thing happens
when you make cash sales. When you list the items on the sales receipt,
QuickBooks assumes that they’re leaving your hands and subtracts them
from your inventory.
The moral of this story is “Keep a good, descriptive Item list.” And the other
moral is “Enter items carefully on the Items tab of checks and bills and in the
Item/Description/Qty/Rate/Amount box of sales receipts and invoices.”
How Purchase Orders Work
If you have to order stuff for your business, consider using purchase orders.
Create QuickBooks purchase orders even if you order goods by phone or by
telegraph or even via the World Wide Web — that is, whenever you don’t
request goods in writing. Filling out purchase orders enables you to deter-
mine what items you have on order and when the items will arrive. All you’ll
have to do is ask QuickBooks, “What’s on order, and when’s it coming,
anyway?” Never again will you have to rack your brain to remember whether
you’ve ordered those thingamajigs and doohickeys.
155
Chapter 7: Inventory Magic

And when the bill comes, you’ll already have it itemized on the purchase
order form. Guess what? Having written out all the items on your purchase
order, you don’t have to fill out an Items tab on your check when you pay the
bill. Or, if you’re paying bills with the accounts payable method, you don’t
have to fill out the Items tab in the Enter Bills window. (Look at Chapter 6 if
you don’t know what I’m talking about here.) When the items arrive, all you
have to do is let QuickBooks know — the items are added immediately to
your inventory list.
Use purchase orders for items that you order — that is, for items that you’ll
receive and pay for in the future. If you buy items over the counter or receive
items that you didn’t order, you obviously don’t need a purchase order. What
you need to do is just pay the bill and inventory the items you just bought, as
I explain in the first half of this chapter.
Choosing a purchase order form for you
The first thing to do when you use purchase orders is to design a purchase
order form for your business. (Thankfully, you only have to do this once.)
Follow these steps:
1. Choose Vendors➪Create Purchase Orders.
Or select Vendors from the Navigators list and click the Purchase Orders
icon. QuickBooks displays the Create Purchase Orders window.
2. Choose Customize from the Form Template drop-down list box in the
upper-right corner of the window.
QuickBooks displays the Customize Template dialog box.
3. Choose to either edit the QuickBooks Purchase Order template for your
business or create a new template based on the QuickBooks template.
If you’re like me and enjoy being able to experiment with things as much
as you want, click the New button. This way, you always have a fresh,
clean template to start from if you ever want to create more customized
purchase orders.
QuickBooks displays the Customize Purchase Order dialog box, shown
in Figure 7-5. This dialog box has seven tabs for determining what your
purchase order looks like. 
4. Play around with this window for a while until your purchase order
comes out just right.
Click the different tabs to see what you can customize. Some options
that are listed on the left side apply to the purchase orders for your
business; some don’t. If you want to use an option that you see on-
screen, click the Screen check box next to that option. Likewise, do the
156
Part II: Daily Chores 

same for printed purchase orders. Click the Print check box if you want an
option to appear on the order when you print it. In the Title text boxes,
type the word or words that you want to see on purchase orders. The
Other options on the Fields and Columns tabs are for putting a field or
column of your own on the purchase order.
To see how your choices look on a purchase order, click the Layout
Designer button. Here you can use the mouse to drag and drop fields
around the page to make it look just the way you want. Click OK to return
to the Customize Purchase Order dialog box. If your purchase order
doesn’t look right, click Cancel and start all over again. And if your pur-
chase order gets too wacky, you can always click the Default button in
the Customize Purchase Order window to go back to the default headers,
fields, columns, and footers.
5. When your purchase order looks magnificent, click OK in the
Customize Purchase Order dialog box. If you created a brand-new
template, you also have to give it a name.
QuickBooks returns you to the Create Purchase Orders window.
If you later decide that you want to change one of your templates, all you
have to do is choose Customize again from the Custom Template drop-down
list box and then select the template you want to edit from the list and click
the Edit button.

Chapter 7: Inventory Magic

Filling out a purchase order
Perhaps you’re running low on gizmos, or doohickeys, or some other item on
your Item list, and you’re ready to reorder these things — whatever they are.
Follow these steps to fill out a purchase order:
1. Choose Vendors➪Create Purchase Orders.
Or select Vendors from the Navigators list and click the Purchase Orders
icon. You see the Create Purchase Orders window, which is similar to
what’s shown in Figure 7-6. Note that the exact details of this window
depend on how you customize your purchase order form.
2. Choose a vendor from the Vendor drop-down list.
Click the down arrow to see a list of your vendors. Click a vendor to see
its name and address in the Vendor box. If you can’t find the name of the
vendor on your list, click Add New from the list and fill in the informa-
tion about the vendor in the New Vendor dialog box.
Figure 7-6:

Purchase
Orders
window.

Part II: Daily Chores 

3. If you track your inventory by class, choose a class from the Class
drop-down list.
The Create Purchase Orders window may not have a Class drop-down list.
If it doesn’t and you want it to have one, you have to set up QuickBooks to
track expenses by class. To do so, first open the QuickBooks file in single-
user mode as the administrator. Then choose Edit➪Preferences and click
the Accounting icon from the list on the left. (You may also need to click
the Company Preferences tab.) Finally, mark the Use Class Tracking 
check box.
4. (Optional) Choose a Rep, Expected Date, and FOB (which I describe in
Chapter 4) if you’re using them on your purchase order.
You may have to fill in other fields before you get to the item-by-item
descriptions at the bottom. Again, these fields may not appear if you
haven’t indicated that you want them on your form.
5. Move to the Item column and start entering the items you’re ordering.
Entering the items is the most important part of creating a purchase
order. When you move into the Item column, it turns into a drop-down
list box. Click its down arrow to see the Item list. You may need to scroll
to the item that you want to enter. A fast way to scroll to the item is to
type the first few letters in the item name. If you type the name of an
item that isn’t on the Item list, QuickBooks asks whether you want to set
up this item. Click Set Up and fill in the New Item dialog box.
Enter as many items as you want in the Item column. QuickBooks will fill
in an item description for you, but you can edit whatever it puts into the
Description column if need be. In the Qty column, indicate how many of
each item you need.
6. If you want to, fill in the Vendor Message field — and definitely fill in
the Memo field.
The Message field is where you put a message to the party receiving
your order. You could write, “Get me this stuff pronto!”
No matter what you do, be sure to fill in the Memo field. What you write
in this field appears in the Open Purchase Orders dialog box and is the
surest way for you to identify what this purchase order is for. Write
something meaningful that you can understand two weeks, three weeks,
or a month from now when you pay for the items that you’re ordering.
At the bottom of the Create Purchase Orders window is the To Be Printed
check box, which tells you whether you’ve printed this purchase order. If
you want to print the purchase order, make sure that this box is checked.
After you print the purchase order, the check disappears from the box.
159
Chapter 7: Inventory Magic

7. Print the purchase order.
Click Print to print the purchase order. If this purchase order is one of
many that you’ve been filling out and you want to print several at once,
click the arrow beside the Print button and choose Print Batch from the
drop-down menu. Before you print the purchase order, however, you
may want to click the arrow beside the Print button and choose Preview
to see what the purchase order will look like when you print it.
QuickBooks shows you an on-screen replica of the purchase order. I
hope it looks okay.
You use the History button after you receive the items you’re so carefully
listing on the purchase order. After you receive the items and record their
receipt, clicking this button tells QuickBooks to give you the entire his-
tory of an item — when you ordered it and when you received it.
As for the other buttons at the top, I think that you know what those are,
and if you don’t, go to Step 8.
8. Click Save & New or Save & Close to record the purchase order.
QuickBooks saves the purchase order and displays a new, blank pur-
chase order window where you can enter another order.
Checking up on purchase orders
You record the purchase orders. A couple of weeks go by, and you ask yourself,
“Did I order those doohickeys from Acme?” Choose Vendors➪Purchase Orders
List to see the Purchase Orders List window with a list of outstanding purchase
orders, as shown in Figure 7-7. Or select Vendors from the Navigators list and
click the PO List Items icon. Double-click one of the orders on the list, and it
magically appears on-screen. 
You can then change any information you need to. Click Save & New to go
back to the Purchase Orders List. You can also enter a new purchase order
from this list by clicking the Purchase Orders button and choosing New.
Do you want to delete a purchase order? Just keep the Purchase Orders
window open, highlight the purchase order that you want to delete, click the
Purchase Orders button, and choose Delete.
Receiving purchase order items
Now that the doohickeys and gizmos have arrived by camel train, you need
to record the receipt of the items and add them to your Item list.
160
Part II: Daily Chores 

The first thing to do is note whether the stuff came with a bill and decide how
you want to pay for it. These decisions are the same ones that you have to
make if you receive goods without having first filled out a purchase order.
You record purchase order items that you receive the same way you record
other items you receive:
 If you pay for purchase order items with a check, you use the Write
Checks window.
 If you receive the purchase order items without a bill, you use the Create
Item Receipts window.
 If you receive the purchase order items with a bill, you use the Enter
Bills window.
Regardless of the window you’re using, when you select the vendor who sold
you the purchase order items, QuickBooks alerts you that open purchase
orders exist for the vendor and asks you if you want to receive against a pur-
chase order. Of course you do. (Receive against simply means to compare
what you ordered to what you received.) When you click Yes, QuickBooks
displays the Open Purchase Orders dialog box, shown in Figure 7-8. Select the
purchase order(s) you’re receiving against and click OK. QuickBooks fills out
the Items tab to show all the stuff you ordered. If what QuickBooks shows is
not what you received, you may have to make adjustments.

Chapter 7: Inventory Magic

Assembling a Product
QuickBooks includes a cool tool for accounting for the manufacture of items.
For example, suppose that Pine Lake Porcelain, the example business used in
this book, mostly just buys and resells coffee mugs and other porcelain doo-
dads. But also suppose that, once a year, Pine Lake Porcelain assembles a col-
lection of red coffee mugs into a boxed St. Valentine’s Day gift set. In this case,
QuickBooks can record the assembly of a boxed gift set that combines, for
example, four red coffee mugs, a cardboard box, and some tissue wrapping
paper.
Identifying the components
Each component that makes up the assembly — in our example, the St.
Valentine’s Day boxed gift set — needs to be an item on your Item list.
Chapter 2 describes how to add items to the Item list, so I won’t repeat that
information here. Figure 7-9, however, shows something that you don’t see
every day: The New Item window filled out to describe how a St. Valentine’s
Day boxed gift set is assembled: four red coffee mugs, a cardboard gift box,
and some tissue paper that loved ones can use when they become emotion-
ally overwhelmed with the generosity of this thoughtful gift.
Building the assembly
To build some assemblies, choose Vendor➪Inventory Activities➪Build
Assemblies. QuickBooks displays the Build Assemblies window (see Figure
7-10), which looks complicated but really isn’t. All you do is choose the thing
you want to build from the Assembly Item drop-down list box and then the
quantity you (or some hapless coworker) has built in the Quantity to Build
box. Then you click either Build & Close or Build & New. (Click Build & New if
you want to record the assembly of some other items.)

163
Chapter 7: Inventory Magic

Because I’m on the subject, let me make a handful of observations about the
Build Assemblies window and the Build Assemblies command:
 In the top-right corner (roughly) of the window, QuickBooks shows the
quantities of the assembly you have on hand and for which customers
have placed orders. That’s pretty useful information to have, so, hey,
remember it’s there.
 The main part of the Build Assemblies window shows you what goes
into your product. Not that you care, but this is called a bill of materials.
 At the bottom of the bill of materials list, QuickBooks shows you the
maximum number of assemblies you can make, given your current
inventory holdings.
 When you build an item, QuickBooks adjusts the inventory item counts.
For example, in the case where you make boxed gift sets, each with four
red coffee mugs and one wrapping tissue, QuickBooks reduces the item
counts of red coffee mugs and wrapping tissues and increases the item
counts of the boxed gift sets when you record building the assembly.
 Some of the components used in an assembly may not be inventory
items. When you use non-inventory parts in an assembly, QuickBooks
doesn’t care about the item counts.
Time for a Reality Check
QuickBooks does a pretty good job of tracking inventory, but you’re still
going to have to make that complete annual inventory of what you have in
stock. What I’m saying here is that you’re going to have to go over everything
and count it by hand. Sorry. You just can’t avoid that chore.
After you make your count, what happens if your inventory figures differ from
those QuickBooks has? First, you have to decide who’s right — you or a com-
puter program. You’re right, probably. Products get dropped. They break. And
that means that you have to adjust the QuickBooks inventory numbers.
Choose Vendors➪Inventory Activities➪Adjust Quantity/Value On Hand. Or
select Vendors from the Navigators list and click the Adjust Qty on Hand icon.
The Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand window appears, as shown in Figure 7-11.
The first thing to do is choose an account for storing your inventory adjust-
ments. Choose it from the Adjustment Account drop-down list. You also can
select a class from the Class drop-down list.
164
Part II: Daily Chores 

For what it’s worth, if it were me, I’d set up and use a special inventory
adjustments expense account. (This way, I’d have an easy way to see the
total inventory adjustments over the year.)
Go down the Item column, entering numbers in the New Qty column where
your count differs from the QuickBooks totals. Click Save & Close when
you’re done.
Dealing with Multiple 
Inventory Locations
Okay, you’ve seen now how QuickBooks handles your inventory. It’s not
fancy. But for many businesses, it gets the job done.
Unfortunately, I’ve encountered a real headache when using QuickBooks for
inventory. What if you store inventory in multiple locations — for example, in
a Michigan warehouse and in a Chicago distribution facility?
Figure 7-11:
The Adjust
Quantity/
Value on
Hand
window.
165
Chapter 7: Inventory Magic

The problem is that QuickBooks is only set up to deal with a single inventory
location. So although you can know how much inventory you have in total, if
you’re not careful you won’t know how much is in Michigan and how much is
in Chicago. And you can’t even really check on inventory shrinkage because
QuickBooks’ records don’t tie to location-specific inventory counts.
Now I need to tell you upfront that you don’t have any good way to deal with
this in QuickBooks. But, throughout the following sections, I explain a couple
of sloppy fixes that you can do.
Manually keep separate inventory-
by-location counts
If you have only a handful of items in your little business — say a few dozen —
it’s pretty easy to just keep a simple manual running tab on what you’ve got in
the Michigan warehouse and what’s in the Chicago distribution facility.
Such a system is very, er, crude. It may just be a couple of sticky notes taped
to your computer monitor. No kidding. But it lets you know how much inven-
tory you’ve got (roughly) and where it’s stored. And for some purposes, that
works okay.
Use different item numbers 
for different locations
The embarrassingly crude approach that I described in the preceding section
doesn’t work if you’ve really got a lot of items — it won’t work for a multiple
location retailer. So if you have a large number of items, I’m sorry, but I think
you probably need to set up sets of item numbers for each inventory location.
This means a lot more work for you, of course. But it’s really the only practical
way to handle your inventory if you’ve got more than a handful of items.
One more thought
I have one more thought for you. I think that we should start a letter-writing
campaign. I’m serious. I think that we should all start writing letters to Intuit,
asking that a multiple-stores or multiple-inventory locations feature be added
to some upcoming version of the program.

Keeping Your Checkbook
In This Chapter
 Writing checks from the Write Checks window
 Writing checks from the Checking register
 Recording deposits
 Recording transfers
 Voiding and deleting transactions
 Searching for transactions
T
his is it. You’re finally going to do those everyday QuickBooks things:
entering checks, deposits, and transfers. Along the way, you also find out
about some neat tools that QuickBooks provides for making these tasks easier,
faster, and more precise.
Writing Checks
Chapter 6 shows you the two ways to write checks: from the Write Checks
window and from the Checking register. In case you were asleep in the back
row of the class, here’s the short version of the instructions for writing checks.
Writing checks from the 
Write Checks window
You can record handwritten checks and other checks that you want to print
with QuickBooks by describing the checks in the Write Checks window.
To write a check from the Write Checks window, follow these steps:
1. Choose Banking➪Write Checks.
Or select Banking in the Navigators list and click the Checks icon.
QuickBooks displays the Write Checks window, shown in Figure 8-1.

2. Click the Bank Account drop-down list at the top of the window and
choose the account from which you want to write this check.
This step is really important and is something you should always check
before you write a check.
3. Enter a check number or mark the check for printing.
Check the To Be Printed box if you plan on printing the check with
QuickBooks, using your printer and preprinted check forms that you’ve
purchased. (I describe this process in Chapter 10.) If you’re recording a
check you wrote by hand, enter the check number you used for the check
in the No. box.
4. Fill in the check.
If you’ve written a check to this person or party before, the AutoFill fea-
ture fills in the name of the payee in the Pay to the Order Of line for you
after you start typing the name. How QuickBooks manages this feat may
seem akin to magic, but it’s really not that tough. QuickBooks just com-
pares what you’ve typed so far with names on your lists of customers,
employees, and other names. As soon as QuickBooks can match the let-
ters you’ve typed with a name on one of these lists, it grabs the name.
If you haven’t written a check to this person or party before, QuickBooks
asks you to add the payee name. Do that. (If you’re not sure whether you
want to add a payee or how to add a payee, refer to Chapter 6.)
Figure 8-1:
The Write
Checks
window.
168
Part II: Daily Chores 

Enter the amount of the check next to the dollar sign and press Tab.
QuickBooks writes out the amount for you on the Dollars line. It also
writes out the address if it has been filled out in the payee’s master file.
5. Fill in the Expenses and Items tabs, if necessary.
Don’t know what these are? Chapter 6 explains them in minute detail.
6. Click Save & Close or Save & New to finish writing the check.
There you have it. Your check is written, is entered in the Checking regis-
ter, and is ready to be printed and mailed.
Writing checks from the Checking register
People who’ve grown accustomed to Quicken, a cousin of QuickBooks, may
want to use the Checking register window to write checks. (Quicken users
like the register metaphor better, I guess.)
To write a check from the Checking register, follow these steps:
1. Open the Checking register.
Choose Banking➪Use Register. Or select Banking from the Navigators
list and click the Check Register icon. If you have more than one bank
account, QuickBooks displays the Use Register dialog box.
From the drop-down list, choose the checking account against which
you want to write the check and click OK. You see the Checking register
window. (See Figure 8-2.) The cursor is at the end of the register, ready
for you to enter check information. (QuickBooks automatically fills in
today’s date.)
QuickBooks uses the account name in the window title. This is why
Figure 8-2 refers to “Big Bank Checking.” That’s the name of the fictitious
bank account I set up.
2. Fill in the information for your check.
Notice that the entries you make in this register are the same ones that
you would make in the Write Checks window. If you’re more comfortable
entering checks in that window, you can click the Edit Transaction button,
which is at the top of the Checking register window, to see the Write
Checks window in all its glory and write a check there. In fact, if you want
to enter expenses or itemize what you’re paying for with the check, you
have to click the Edit Transaction button and get into the Write Checks
window.
Otherwise, just go from field to field and enter the information in the reg-
ister. Once again, use the drop-down lists to enter the Payee and Account
names. If you enter a Payee or Account name that QuickBooks doesn’t
recognize, the program asks you to give more information.
169
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook

3. When you finish filling in the check information, click Record.
Or click the Clear button if you decide that you want to go back to start
over again. Clicking Clear blanks out what you just entered.
If you write checks by hand as opposed to printing them with QuickBooks,
make sure that the check numbers in the Checking register and the check num-
bers in your checkbook match up. You may need to go into the QuickBooks
Checking register and change numbers in the Number column. When your
bank statement comes, reconciling your bank statement and your checkbook
is much easier if you entered check numbers correctly.
Changing a check that you’ve written
What if you need to change a check after you’ve already entered it? Perhaps
you made a terrible mistake, such as recording a $52.50 check as $25.20. Can
you fix it? Sure. Just go into the Checking register and find the check that you
want to change. Go to the Payment or Deposit field and make the change.
If you have more extensive changes to make (for instance, if the check is a
split transaction), put the cursor where the check is and click Edit Transaction.
QuickBooks displays the Write Checks window with the original check in it.
Figure 8-2:
The
Checking
register
window.
170
Part II: Daily Chores 

Make the changes. (Don’t forget to make changes on the Items and Expenses
tabs, too, if necessary.)
When you finish, click Save & Close. You go back to the Checking register,
where you see the changes to the check.
If you have the Write Checks window displayed, you can also use the Next
and Previous buttons to page through your checks and make any changes.
Packing more checks into the register
Usually, QuickBooks displays two rows of information about each check you
enter. It also displays two rows of information about each type of transaction
that you enter. If you want to pack more checks into a visible portion of the
register, check the 1-Line check box at the bottom of the Checking register
window. When you check this box, QuickBooks uses a single-line format to
display all the information in the register except the Memo field.
Compare Figure 8-2 with Figure 8-3 to see what the 1-Line display looks like.
Checking registers can get awfully long, and the 1-Line display is helpful when
you’re looking through a long register for a check or transaction.

Depositing Money into a 
Checking Account
You can’t write checks unless you deposit some money in your checking
account. You didn’t know that? Well, the next time you’re taking your exercise
in the prison yard, give it some serious thought. From time to time, you must
deposit money in your checking account and record those deposits in the
Checking register.
You can record deposits in two ways. Find out about those ways in the follow-
ing sections.
Recording simple deposits
If you have a simple deposit to make — a sum of money that didn’t come
from one of your customers — just make the deposit directly in the Checking
register.
For example, suppose that your elderly Aunt Iris sends you $100 with a note
explaining how, more than 80 years ago, Great-Uncle Bert started his hammock
manufacturing business with only $100, and for good luck, she’s sending you
$100 to help you along.
Recording a simple deposit is, well, pretty simple. Follow these steps:
1. Open the Checking register.
Choose Banking➪Use Register. Or select Banking from the Navigators
list and click the Check Register icon. If you have more than one bank

Part II: Daily Chores 
Paying for items with cash
To track petty cash purchases, you need a petty
cash account. You can set up a petty cash
account (which works just like a bank account)
by following the steps in “Setting up a second
bank account,” later in this chapter. To record
purchases you make from the money in that
coffee can beside your desk, use the petty cash
register. You can record cash purchases just as
you record checks. (Of course, you don’t need
to worry about using the correct check numbers
when you record cash purchases — you can
just use the numbers 1, 2, 3, and so on.) To
record cash withdrawals to be used for petty
cash in the office, just record the withdrawal as
a transfer to your petty cash account, as I
describe later in the chapter.

account, QuickBooks displays the Use Register dialog box. Select the
checking account into which you want to make the deposit and click OK.
QuickBooks displays the Checking register window. (Refer to Figure 8-2.)
2. Enter the date on which you made the deposit in the Date column.
3. In the Payee column, enter the name of the person or business that
sent you money.
Don’t worry if QuickBooks adds a check number in the Number field
when you move to the Payee column. When you enter a deposit amount,
QuickBooks changes the Number field to DEP (for deposit, of course).
4. Enter the amount that you’re depositing.
Move the cursor to the Deposit column and enter the amount.
5. Enter an account for this deposit.
Move to the Account field, click the down arrow, and choose an account
from the list. Most likely, you’ll choose an account such as Uncategorized
Income.
6. Click the Record button.
Your deposit is entered, and your checking account’s balance is fattened
accordingly. Note that all entries in the Checking register are made in
chronological order, with deposits first and checks next.
Depositing income from customers
Depositing income from customers is a little more complicated because it
involves the Payments to Deposit dialog box. Have you been recording cus-
tomer payments as they come in? (You do so by choosing Customers➪Receive
Payments or Customers➪Enter Sales Receipt as I describe in Chapter 5.) If
you’ve been recording customer payments and have told QuickBooks to group
them with your other undeposited funds, QuickBooks places these payments
in your Undeposited Funds account. Now all you have to do is transfer the
undeposited funds to your checking account. Here’s how:
1. Choose Banking➪Make Deposits.
Or select Banking from the Navigators list and click the Deposits icon.
Because you have undeposited funds, you see the Payments to Deposit
dialog box, shown in Figure 8-4. This dialog box lists the checks that
you’ve received but haven’t put in a checking account or other bank
account yet.
The View Payment Method Type down-down list box lets you see pay-
ments of only a particular type: cash, check, American Express, and so
on. If you group deposits by payment type, this box works as a slick tool
to group transactions you’ll deposit together.
173
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook

2. Select the checks that you want to deposit.
Place a check mark next to the checks that you want to deposit by click-
ing in the column next to them. Or, if you want to deposit all the checks,
click the Select All button. Click OK.
The Make Deposits window appears, as shown in Figure 8-5. Do you rec-
ognize the information in the middle of the window? It describes the
checks you just selected to be deposited.
3. Select the checking account to receive these deposits.
Select the account from the Deposit To drop-down list at the top of the
window. And while you’re at it, check the Date text box to make sure
that it shows the date you’ll deposit these checks in your checking
account. In other words, if you’re not going to make it to the bank or the
ATM machine until tomorrow, put tomorrow’s date in the Date text box.
4. Add any other noncustomer deposits to include on the deposit slip.
If your grandma, bless her heart, gave you 1,000 pennies in ten rolls, for
example, that’s ten extra dollars that you can record on this deposit slip.
At the bottom of the list of payments, enter the name of the person who
gave you the cash, the account, a memo, a check number, the payment
method (cash in this case), a class if you’re using classes, and the amount.
5. Write a note to yourself in the Memo box to describe this deposit, if
you want to, and click the Print button to get a hard copy of the
deposit slip.
Many banks accept this deposit slip, so you can print it and put it in the
envelope with your ATM deposit or hand it to the bank clerk. Whatever
Figure 8-4:
The
Payments 
to Deposit
dialog box.
174
Part II: Daily Chores 

you write on the memo appears on the Checking register. (You should
probably write a memo to yourself in case you need to know what this
deposit is years from now when you’re old and dotty.)
6. Record any cash back that you plan to get with the deposit.
If you need to get cash to replenish your petty cash account, select the
account from the Cash Back Goes To drop-down list box, write a memo,
and then record the amount of cash you want to get back from the
deposit.
7. Click the Save & Close button at the bottom of the Make Deposits
window.
Now the deposit is recorded in QuickBooks. It appears in your Checking
register next to the letters DEP, which stand for Deposit.
Transferring Money between Accounts
Account transfers occur when you move money from one account to 
another — for example, from your savings account to your checking account.
But, jeepers, why am I telling you this? If you have one of those combined
savings and checking accounts, you probably do this sort of thing all the time.
Figure 8-5:
The Make
Deposits
window.
175
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook

Oh, now I remember why I brought this up — QuickBooks makes quick work
of account transfers as long as you’ve already set up both accounts.
Setting up a second bank account
If you haven’t set up a second account, you need to set one up. To do so, open
the chart of accounts by choosing Lists➪Chart of Accounts. Then click the
Account button and choose New. Fill in the name of the account and, if you
want to, the account number or a description of the account. Then fill in the
As Of box with the date that you opened the account. Enter the opening bal-
ance as zero so that you can record your initial deposit or transfer of money
into the account. You record initial deposits the way I describe earlier in this
chapter (either as simple deposits or as customer deposits, whatever the case
may be). You record an initial transfer by completing the following steps:
1. Choose Banking➪Transfer Funds.
Or select Banking in the Navigators list and click the Transfer Funds
icon. You see the Transfer Funds between Accounts window, shown in
Figure 8-6.
2. Select the bank account from which you’re going to transfer the money.
In the Transfer Funds From box at the top of the window, choose the
account from the drop-down list.
3. Select the bank account to which you want to transfer the money.
In the Transfer Funds To drop-down list, select the account that receives
the funds.
4. Enter the amount that you want to transfer and fill in the Memo box.
Someday, you may go into the register for the account you’re writing this
check in and wonder where you transferred this money and why. Filling
in the Memo box solves this little mystery beforehand.
5. Click the Save & New or Save & Close button.
QuickBooks records the transfer, which you can confirm by opening your
Checking register. You see that the transfer has the letters TRANSFR in
the Type column and the name of the account to which you transferred
the money in the Account column. The amount you transferred shows
up in the Payment column (because you transferred the funds out of this
account). Figure 8-7 shows a $25,000 transfer — in the figure the selected
transaction is the one we’re talking about — from a checking account
called Big Bank Checking to an account called Big Bank Savings. You can
tell this transaction is a transfer because the other account name shows
up in the Account box. Note that I clicked the Splits button to show the
Splits area, which provides extra information.

Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook

About the other half of the transfer
Here’s the cool thing about transfer transactions: QuickBooks automatically
records the other half of the transfer for you. Figure 8-8 shows the other half
of the transfer from Figure 8-7. This register is for a savings account called Big
Bank Savings. The $25,000 transfer from your checking account actually made
it into your savings account. The transfer once again shows up as a TRANSFR.
Changing a transfer that 
you’ve already entered
Big surprise here, but changing a transfer that you’ve already entered works
just like changing a check. First, you find the transfer in the account register,
and then you click Edit Transaction. You see the Transfer Funds between
Accounts window with the transfer check you wrote. Make changes to the
check and click Save & New or Save & Close. You return to the register, where
your deposit is adjusted accordingly.

Part II: Daily Chores 

To Delete or to Void?
What happens if you put a transaction — a deposit, a check, or a transfer
payment — in a Checking register and later decide that it shouldn’t be there?
You have two ways of handling this situation. If you want to keep a record of
the transaction but render it moot, meaningless, or nada, then you void the
transaction. But if you want to obliterate the transaction from the face of the
earth as though it never happened in the first place, you delete it.
Decide whether you want to void or delete the transaction and then follow
these steps:
1. Find the transaction in the register.
In the next section (“The Big Register Phenomenon”), I tell you some
quick ways to find transactions.
2. Choose either Edit➪Delete Check or Edit➪Void Check and click the
Record button.
There, the deed is done. Figure 8-9 shows a Checking register window
with a voided check. The voided transaction is the one selected. Notice
the word VOID in the Memo column. If this check had been deleted, it
wouldn’t even show up in the register.
Figure 8-9:
The
Checking
register
shows 
a voided
check.
179
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook

The Edit menu changes depending on what kind of transaction shows or is
selected in the open window (that is, Void Deposit, Void Check, and so on).
The Big Register Phenomenon
If you start entering checks, deposits, and transfers into your registers, 
you soon find yourself with registers that contain hundreds, and even thou-
sands, of transactions. You can still work with one of these big registers by
using the tools and techniques that I talk about in the preceding paragraphs.
Nevertheless, let me give you some more help for dealing with . . . (drum roll,
please) . . . the big register phenomenon.
Moving through a big register
You can use the Page Up and Page Down keys to page up and down 
through your register, a screen full of transactions at a time. Some people 
call this activity scrolling. You can call it whatever you want.
You can also use the Home key to move through the register. Press the Home
key once to move to the front of the field you’re currently in. Press the 
Home key twice to move to the first field of the transaction you’re on (the Date
field), or press it three times to move to the first transaction in the register.
The End key works in a similar fashion. Bet you can guess how this works.
Press the End key once to move to the end of the field you’re in, press it twice
to move to the last field of the transaction you’re on (the Memo field), or press
it three times to move to the last transaction in the register.
Of course, you can use the vertical scroll bar along the right edge of the
Checking register, too. Click the arrows at either end of the vertical scroll bar
to select the next or previous transaction. Click either above or below the
square scroll box to page back and forth through the register. Or, if you have
no qualms about dragging the mouse around, you can drag the scroll box up
and down the scroll bar.
QuickBooks lets you sort your register in different ways, which makes scrolling
through and finding transactions much easier. To sort your register the way
you prefer, choose an option from the Sort By drop-down list box in the lower-
left corner of the Checking register window.
180
Part II: Daily Chores 

Finding that darn transaction
Want to find that one check, deposit, or transfer? No problem. I discuss this
technique earlier in the book, but it’s appropriate here, too. The Edit menu’s
Find command provides a handy way for doing just such a thing. Here’s what
you do:
1. Choose Edit➪Advanced Find.
QuickBooks, with restrained but obvious enthusiasm, displays the
Advanced tab of the Find window (see Figure 8-10). You use this window
to describe — in as much detail as possible — the transaction that you
want to find.
Choose the Edit➪Simple Find command to display the Simple tab of the
Find window. The Simple tab enables you to search for transactions by
using the transaction type, customer or job name, date, number, and
amount. You can easily switch to an advanced search by clicking the
Advanced tab.
Figure 8-10:
The
Advanced
tab of 
the Find
window.
181
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook

2. Choose a filter that describes the information that you already have.
In the figure, the Account filter has been chosen. As you click different
filters, the Find window changes.
3. Describe the filter that identifies the transaction that you want to
locate.
In the upper-left box, which is set to Account in Figure 8-10, choose the
filter that describes the subject of your search from the drop-down list.
In case of an account-based filter, for example, you can select to look at
all accounts, just income accounts, just expense accounts, and so forth.
Other filters provide different boxes and boxes for setting up the filter.
By the way, the case of the text doesn’t matter. If you type rainy, for
example, QuickBooks finds RAINY as well as Rainy.
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 as necessary.
Yes, you can filter through as many fields as you want. In fact, you can
filter so much that nothing matches your specification.
5. Let the search begin.
Click the Find button to begin looking.
If QuickBooks finds transactions that match the one you described,
QuickBooks lists them in the bottom half of the window.

In This Chapter
 Setting up and selecting credit card accounts
 Entering credit card charges
 Changing charges that you’ve already entered
 Reconciling credit card statements
 Paying the monthly credit card bill
 Handling debit cards
You can use QuickBooks to track your business credit cards in much the
same way that you use it to keep a checkbook. The process is almost the
same but with a few wrinkles.
Tracking Business Credit Cards
If you want to track credit card spending and balances with QuickBooks, 
you need to set up a credit card account — if you didn’t already do so in the
EasyStep Interview. (In comparison, you use bank accounts to track things
such as the money that flows into and out of a checking, savings, or petty
cash account.)
Setting up a credit card account
To set up a credit card account, you follow roughly the same steps that you
use to set up a bank account:
1. Choose Lists➪Chart of Accounts.
Or select Company in the Navigators list and then click the Chart of
Accounts icon. QuickBooks displays the Chart of Accounts window,
shown in Figure 9-1.

2. Click the Account button in the Chart of Accounts window and then
choose New.
QuickBooks displays the New Account window, shown in Figure 9-2.
3. Choose Credit Card from the Type drop-down list.
Choosing Credit Card tells QuickBooks that you want to set up a credit
card account. I’m sure that you’re surprised.
4. Type a name for the account in the Name text box.
Why not do it right? Move the cursor to the Name text box and enter 
the name of your credit card.
5. Type the card number in the Card No. text box.
If you’re creating a general Credit Card account for more than one card,
leave the Card No. text box empty. While you’re at it, you can describe
the card, too. You may want to type Usury! in the Description text box,
depending on your card’s interest rate.
6. Ignore the Tax Line list box.
7. In the Opening Balance text box, enter the balance that you owed at the
end of the last credit card billing period after you made your payment.
Figure 9-1:
The Chart of
Accounts
window.
184
Part II: Daily Chores 

Move the cursor to the Opening Balance text box and use the number
keys to enter the balance value. If you just got this credit card and you
haven’t bought anything with it, leave the box empty. Otherwise, enter
the balance that you currently owe. You enter the balance as a positive
number, by the way, even though you owe money.
The only time you should enter a credit card account balance equal to
something other than zero is at the time that you start using QuickBooks
and are entering your trial balance as of the conversion date. Otherwise,
you’ll foul up your owner’s equity. (Refer to Chapter 1 if you have ques-
tions about entering the trial balance or about the conversion date.)
8. Enter the As Of date on which you’ll start keeping records for the
credit card account.
You should probably use the date when you made your most recent 
payment.
9. Click OK.
QuickBooks redisplays the Chart of Accounts window (refer to Figure 9-1),
except this time the window lists an additional account — the credit card
account that you just created.
Figure 9-2:
The New
Account
window.

Chapter 9: Paying with Plastic

Selecting a credit card account 
so that you can use it
To tell QuickBooks that you want to work with a credit card account, you 
use the Chart of Accounts window — the same window shown in Figure 9-1.
Go figure!
Choose Lists➪Chart of Accounts. After you display the window, double-click
the credit card account you want to use. QuickBooks displays the Credit Card
register so that you can begin recording transactions.
Entering Credit Card Transactions
After you select a credit card account, QuickBooks displays the Credit Card
register, shown in Figure 9-3. It looks a lot like a Checking register, doesn’t it?
Figure 9-3:
The Credit
Card
Register
window.
186
Part II: Daily Chores 

The Credit Card register works like the regular register window that you use
for a checking account. You enter transactions in the rows of the register.
When you record a charge, QuickBooks updates the credit card balance and
the remaining credit limit.
Recording a credit card charge
Recording a credit card charge is similar to recording a check or bank
account withdrawal. For the sake of illustration, suppose that you charged
$5.00 for a coffee at a local watering hole, the Seattle Coffee Shop. Here’s how
you record this charge:
1. Choose Banking➪Record Credit Card Charges➪Enter Credit Card
Charges.
Or select Banking in the Navigators list and then click the Credit Card
Charges icon. The Enter Credit Card Charges window appears, as shown
in Figure 9-4.
Figure 9-4:
The Enter

187
Chapter 9: Paying with Plastic

2. In the Credit Card list box, choose the credit card that you charged
the expense against.
Click the down arrow next to the Credit Card box and choose a card
from the drop-down list.
3. In the Purchased From field, record the name of the business that you
paid with a credit card.
Move the cursor to the Purchased From line and click the down arrow.
You see a list of names. Choose one from the list.
If you’ve never dined at this fine establishment before, choose Add New.
Then add the business name.
4. Choose the appropriate option button to indicate whether the transac-
tion is a purchase or a credit.
Select the Charge option button if you want to record a purchase (which
is what you do most of the time and what this example shows you). Select
the Credit option button if you want to record a credit on your account
(if you returned something, for example).
5. Enter the charge date in the Date field.
Move the cursor to the Date line (if the cursor isn’t already there) and
type the date, using the MM/DD/YY format. For example, type either
091304 or 9/13/04 for September 13, 2004. If you’re entering this charge
two or three days after the fact, don’t enter today’s date. Enter the date
that the charge was made. Using that date makes reconciling your
records with your credit card company’s records easier when you get
your monthly statement.
6. Type the charge amount in the Amount field.
Move the cursor to the Amount line and enter the total charge amount.
Don’t type a dollar sign, but do type the period to indicate the decimal
place.
7. (Optional) Enter a memo description in the Memo text box.
Move the cursor to the Memo text box and type the specific reason that
you’re charging the item. In this case, you could type Important Business
Meeting or something like that.
8. Fill in the Expenses tab.
I’m hoping that you read Chapters 6 and 8, that you know all about the
Expenses tab, and that you’re thoroughly bored by the topic. However,
for those of you who opened the book right to this page, you use the
Expenses tab to record business expenses.
188
Part II: Daily Chores 

Move to the Account column of the Expenses tab, click the down arrow,
and choose an Expense account from the list (most likely Travel &
Ent:Meals, if this was a business lunch). If you enter a name here that
QuickBooks doesn’t already know, it asks you to set up an expense
account.
QuickBooks automatically fills in the Amount column when you enter a
sum in the Amount line. Type something in the Memo column and assign
this expense to a Customer:Job and Class, if you want to. You need to
turn on class tracking if you want to assign the expense to a class.
9. Fill in the Items tab.
Because this charge is for a meal at a restaurant, you don’t itemize the
charge. However, if you were charging lumber, paper supplies, and so on,
you’d fill in the Items tab.
If you have a purchase order on file with the vendor that you entered in
the Purchased From line, QuickBooks tells you so. Click the Select PO
button to see a list of your outstanding purchase orders with the vendor.
If you don’t know how to handle purchase orders, see Chapter 7.
10. Record the charge by clicking the Save & New or the Save & Close
button.
The charge is recorded in the Credit Card register. Figure 9-5 shows what
the Credit Card register looks like after I entered a handful of charges.

Chapter 9: Paying with Plastic

Changing charges that you’ve 
already entered
Perhaps you record a credit card charge and then realize that you recorded 
it incorrectly. Or perhaps you shouldn’t have recorded it at all because you
didn’t pay for the business lunch. (Someone else paid for it after one of those
friendly arguments over who should pay the bill. You know the type of argu-
ment I mean: “No, I insist.” “On the contrary, I insist.” You get the picture.)
You have to go into the Credit Card register and either edit or delete the
charge by following these steps:
1. Choose Lists➪Chart of Accounts.
You see the Chart of Accounts window.
2. Double-click the credit card account where the faulty charge is.
Like magic, the Credit Card register appears on-screen.
3. Select the credit card transaction that you want to delete or change.
That’s easy. Just move the cursor to the transaction.
4. Void, delete, or edit the transaction:
• To void the credit card transaction, choose Edit➪Void Credit Card
Charge and click OK.
• To delete it, choose Edit➪Delete Credit Card Charge. QuickBooks
displays a message box that asks whether you really want to delete
the transaction. Click OK.
• To edit the transaction, click the Edit Transaction button at the top
of the window. You return to the Enter Credit Card Charges window.
Make your changes there and click Save & New or Save & Close.
You also can make changes inside the Credit Card register and
click Record when you’re done.
Reconciling Your Credit Card Statement
and Paying the Bill
You reconcile, or balance, a credit card account the same way you balance a
bank account. (For help with this task, see Chapter 13.) After you successfully

Make Payment dialog box, asking how you want to pay the bill. You can either
pay by check or enter a bill to be paid later. (The second option is the accounts
payable method, remember?)
If you opt to pay the bill by writing a check, you go straight to the Write Checks
window, and the Expenses tab is all filled out for you. Fill in the name of the
card issuer, the date, and so on. Click Save & New or Save & Close when you’re
done. The payment is recorded in both the Checking register and the Credit
Card register.
If you opt to enter the payment as a bill to be paid at a later date, you go to
the Enter Bills window. Fill everything out just as you would if you were in the
Write Checks window. When you click Save & New, the transaction is recorded
in the Accounts Payable register and the Credit Card register.
See Chapter 6 if you need to know more about either the Enter Bills or Write
Checks window.
So What About Debit Cards?
Debit cards, when you get right down to it, aren’t really credit cards at all.
Using a debit card is more akin to writing a check than anything else. Rather
than withdrawing money by writing a check, however, you withdraw money
by using a debit card.
Although a debit card transaction looks (at least to your friends and the mer-
chants you shop with) like a credit card transaction, you should treat a debit
card transaction as you treat a check. In a nutshell, here’s what you need to do:
 When you charge something to a debit card, record the transaction just
as you record a regular check. You may want to enter the transaction
number as the check number or in the memo line so that you can keep
track of the transaction.
 When you withdraw cash by using the debit card, record the transaction
as a regular withdrawal (or transfer to a petty cash account), as if you’d
gone in to the bank with a withdrawal slip.
 When you make a deposit through a cash machine by using the debit
card, record the transaction just as you record a regular deposit.

In this part . . .
A
fter you start using QuickBooks, you need to 
complete some tasks at the end of every week,
month, or year. This part describes these tasks: printing
payroll checks, backing up ﬁles, printing reports, ﬁling
quarterly and annual tax returns . . . The list goes on and
on. Fortunately, QuickBooks comes with some nifty online
features to help you get the job done.

 Printing checks one at a time
 Printing several checks at a time
 Printing a register
T
his chapter covers the reductivity of the postcolonial implications in
Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness. Just kidding. I’m going to cover how
to print checks and checking registers.
Printing checks in QuickBooks is quick — well, it’s quick after you set up your
printer correctly. If you have a continuous-feed printer, you know by now that
these printers have problems printing anything on a form. The alignment
always gets messed up.
QuickBooks has check forms that you can buy, and I recommend using them
if you print checks. After all, the QuickBooks checks were made to work with
this program. And all banks accept these checks.
If you want help with printing reports, refer to Chapter 14, where I cover this
topic in almost too much detail.
Getting the Printer Ready
Before you can start printing checks, you have to make sure that your printer
is set up to print them. You also have to tell QuickBooks what to put on the
checks — your company name, address, logo, and so on. And you may try
running a few sample checks through the wringer to see whether they come
out all right.

Follow these steps to set up the printer:
1. Choose File➪Printer Setup.
After you choose this command, you see the Printer Setup dialog box,
shown in Figure 10-1.
2. Select Check/PayCheck from the Form Name drop-down list box.
QuickBooks sets your printing options differently depending on which
form you want to print. For printing out checks, you want to choose the
Check/PayCheck form from the Form Name drop-down list box at the
top of the dialog box.
3. In the Printer Name drop-down list box, select the printer that 
you have.
In the Printer Name drop-down list box, click the down arrow and look 
at the printer names. When you installed QuickBooks, it had a frank,
software-to-software talk with Windows to find out what kind of printer
you have, among other things. Your printer is probably already selected,
but if it’s not, select the correct printer.
4. Set the correct Printer Type option, if necessary.
This box is probably already filled in, too, thanks to that frank discus-
sion I mention in Step 3. But if it isn’t, click the down arrow and choose
Continuous or Page-Oriented. (The former is generally for dot-matrix
printers and the latter for laser and inkjet printers, but it really just
depends on what kind of paper you use for your printer.)
5. Select the appropriate Check Style.
Figure 10-1:
The Printer
Setup 
dialog box.
196
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

Now you’re cooking. This step is where you get to make a real choice.
Standard checks are sized to fit in legal envelopes. Voucher checks are
the same width as standard checks, but they’re much longer. When you
choose the Voucher option, QuickBooks prints voucher information as
well — the items and expenses tabulations from the bottom of the Write
Checks window. QuickBooks also provides information about the check-
ing account that you’re writing this check on. The Wallet option is for
printing checks that are small enough to fit in — you guessed it — a
wallet.
6. (Optional) Click the Options button and then adjust your printer
options. When you’re finished, click OK to return to the Printer Setup
dialog box.
After you click the Options button, QuickBooks displays your printer’s
Properties dialog box. Use this dialog box to specify print quality, number
of copies, and other options specific to your printer.
7. Click the Fonts tab of the Printer Setup dialog box and then the Fonts
button on that tab to customize the fonts on your checks.
When you click either the Font button or the Address Font button on this
tab, you see the Select Font dialog box (shown in Figure 10-2) or the Select
Address Font dialog box. You use the Address Font button to designate
how your company’s name and address look and the Font button to des-
ignate what all other print on your checks looks like. Here’s your chance
to spruce up your checks and make your company’s name stand out.
Experiment for a while with the font, font style, and type size settings.
For example, if you have a bookstore, choose the Bookman font (maybe
using bold for your company’s name and address); if you run a messen-
ger service, choose Courier; Italian mathematicians can use Times
Roman (just kidding). You can see what your choices look like in the
Sample box.
Figure 10-2:
The 
Select Font
dialog box.
197
Chapter 10: Check Printing 101

When you finish fooling around, click the OK button to go back to the
Printer Setup dialog box.
8. Click the Partial Page tab of the Printer Setup dialog box and then
choose a Partial Page Printing Style.
Fortunately, some graphics appear; otherwise, you wouldn’t have a clue
what these options are, would you? These options are for the environmen-
tally friendly among you. Suppose that you feed two checks to the printer,
but the check sheets have three checks each. You have a leftover check.
Thanks to this option, you can use the extra check. Click one of the
options to tell QuickBooks how you plan to feed the check to the 
printer — vertically on the left (the Left option), vertically in the middle
(the Centered option), or horizontally (the Portrait option). You feed
checks to the printer the same way that you feed envelopes to it.
9. (Optional) Click the Logo button and then enter a company logo or
some clip art.
In the Logo dialog box, click File and find the directory and BMP
(bitmapped) graphic file that you want to load. Click OK. Only 
graphics that are in BMP format can be used on your checks.
10. Click OK when you’re finished.
That setup was no Sunday picnic, was it? But your checks are all ready to be
printed, and you’ll probably never have to go through that ordeal again.
Printing a Check
For some reason, when I get to this part of the discussion, my pulse quickens.
Actually writing a check for real money seems terribly serious. I get the same
feeling whenever I mail someone cash — even if the amount is nominal.
I think that the best way to lower my heart rate (and yours, if you’re like me) is
to just print the darn check and be done with it. QuickBooks can print checks
in two ways: as you write them and in bunches.
First things first, however. Before you can print checks, you have to load some
blank checks into your printer. This process works the same way as loading
any paper into your printer. If you have questions, refer to your printer’s doc-
umentation. (Sorry I can’t help more on this process, but a million different
printers exist, and I can’t tell which one you even have when I look into my
crystal ball.)
198
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

A few words about printing checks
Check printing is kind of complicated, isn’t it? For the record, I’m with you on
this one. I really wish it weren’t so much work. But you’ll find that printing
checks gets easier after the first few times.
Pretty soon, you’ll be running instead of walking through the steps. Pretty
soon, you’ll just skate around roadblocks such as check-form alignment prob-
lems. Pretty soon, in fact, you’ll know all this stuff and never have to read
pretty soon again.
Printing a check as you write it
If you’re in the Write Checks window and you’ve just finished filling out a
check, you can print it. The only drawback is that you have to print checks
one at a time with this method. Here’s how:
1. Fill out your check.
Yes, I strongly recommend filling out the check before printing it. Turn 
to Chapter 6 for help with writing checks using QuickBooks.
2. Click the Print button in the Write Checks window.
You’ll see the Print Check dialog box, shown in Figure 10-3.
3. Enter a check number in the Printed Check Number text box and click
OK.
After you click OK, you see the similarly named Print Checks dialog box,
shown in Figure 10-4. The settings that you see in this dialog box are the
ones that you chose when you first told QuickBooks how to print checks.
If you change the settings in the Print Checks dialog box, the changes
affect only this particular check. The next time you print a check, you’ll
see your original settings again.
Figure 10-3:
The Print
Check
dialog box.
199
Chapter 10: Check Printing 101

4. Either click Print to accept the default settings, or make changes in
the dialog box and then click Print.
In the Printer Name box, specify which printer you want to print to. In
the Check Style area, indicate whether you want to print a Standard,
Voucher, or Wallet-sized check.
If you’re printing a partial page of forms on a laser printer, use the Partial
Page tab to indicate both the number of check forms on the partial page
and how you’ll feed them through your printer.
If you want your company’s name and address to appear on the check,
select the Print Company Name and Address check box.
See how the Number of Copies text box is grayed out? If you want to
change this setting, you need to go back to the Printer Setup dialog box
(choose File➪Printer Setup).
After you click Print, QuickBooks prints the check, and you see the Did
Check(s) Print OK? dialog box (not shown).
5. If the check didn’t come out right, type the number of the incorrectly
printed check in the Did Check(s) Print OK? dialog box and click OK.
Then click the Print button again, enter the new check number, and
click Print again.
For example, if check number 1005 printed incorrectly, type 1005. Then
click the Print button again, enter the new check number, and click Print
again. If preprinted check form 1005 is still usable (say, because you acci-
dentally printed check 1005 on blank paper instead of on the form), you
can reprint the check on check form 1005 by typing 1005 in the Print
Check dialog box (refer to Figure 10-3). If the incorrectly printed check
ruined check form 1005 (say, because you loaded the form upside down),
load your printer with a fresh check form and verify the new check
number, in this case probably 1006.
Figure 10-4:
The other
Print Checks
dialog box.
200
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

QuickBooks doesn’t automatically keep track of incorrectly printed
check forms, so you have to. If you botch a check form, be sure to write
the word VOID in large letters and permanent ink across the face of the
check. Then file the check away for your reference. Don’t throw the check
away.
If you still have questions about how to check any mistakes, see the sec-
tion “What if I make a mistake?” later in this chapter.
6. If your check looks good, click OK.
You return to the Write Checks window. Don’t forget to sign the check.
Printing checks by the bushel
What if you write a mess of checks and then decide to print them? That’s how
the process is usually done. Here’s how to print a bushel of checks:
1. Go into the Checking register and make sure that the checks that you
want to print are marked To Print.
The quickest way to get into the Checking register is to choose Banking➪
Use Register. If you have more than one bank account, select the Checking
Account register you want to open and click OK. Do the checks that you
want to print have To Print in the Number line? If not, place the cursor
in the Number line, press T, and then click the Record button. QuickBooks
automatically fills the Number field with To Print and then moves on.
(If the check you want to print already has a number, you need to replace
the number with T.)
2. Choose File➪Print Forms➪Checks.
You see the Select Checks to Print dialog box, in which you select which
checks to print (see Figure 10-5).
3. Click the check marks next to the checks that you don’t want to print
and then click OK.
All the checks are selected at first. If you want to print them all, fine. If
not, click the check marks next to the checks that you don’t want to
print so that QuickBooks removes the check marks. Or, if you want to
print only a few of the checks, click the Select None button and then
click next to the checks that you want to print so that QuickBooks
places a check in the column.
When only the checks that you want to print are marked with a check
mark, click OK to continue with this crazy little thing called check print-
ing. QuickBooks, happy with your progress, displays the Print Checks
dialog box (refer to Figure 10-4). Here you see the settings that you
chose when you first told QuickBooks how to print checks.
201
Chapter 10: Check Printing 101

4. Either click Print to accept the default settings, or make changes in
the dialog box and then click Print.
You can change the settings in this dialog box if you want them to be dif-
ferent. Any changes that you make for a particular batch of checks don’t
affect the default settings. The next time you print a check, your original
settings appear again.
In the Check Style box, indicate whether you want to print Standard,
Voucher, or Wallet-sized checks. If you’re printing a partial page of checks,
enter the number of checks on the first page in the Number of Checks on
First Page text box.
If you want your company’s name and address to appear on the checks,
select the Print Company Name and Address check box.
Note that the Number of Copies text box is grayed out. If you want to
change these settings, you need to choose File➪Printer Setup.
QuickBooks prints the checks, and then you see the Did Check(s) 
Print OK? dialog box.
5. Review the checks that QuickBooks printed. Then do one of the 
following:
• If QuickBooks printed the checks correctly, answer the Did Check(s)
Print OK? message box by clicking OK. (QuickBooks, apparently
thinking that you now want to do nothing but print checks, redis-
plays the nearly exhausted Write Checks window.)
• If QuickBooks didn’t print a check correctly, type the number of
the first incorrectly printed check in the text box and then click
OK. In this case, repeat the steps for check printing. Note, though,
that you need to reprint only the first bad check and the checks
that follow it. You don’t need to reprint good checks that precede
the first bad check.
Don’t forget to write the word VOID in large letters and permanent
ink across the front of incorrectly printed check forms. Then file
the checks for safekeeping. (Don’t throw them away.) To record the
voided check in QuickBooks, see the next section, “What if I make
a mistake?”
Figure 10-5:
The Select
Checks 
to Print
dialog box.
202
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

If the numbers of the checks you need to reprint aren’t sequential and
are, in fact, spread all over creation, make it easy on yourself. Click OK
to clear the list of checks to be printed, go into the Checking register, and
press T in the Number line of the checks you need to reprint. QuickBooks
automatically fills these with To Print. Then choose File➪Print Forms➪
Checks, as in Step 2, and continue from there.
If your checks came out all right, take the rest of the day off. Give yourself
a raise while you’re at it.
6. Sign the printed checks.
Then — and I guess you probably don’t need my help here — put the
checks in the mail.
What if I make a mistake?
If you discover a mistake after you print a check, the problem may not be as
big as you think.
If you’ve already mailed the check, however, you can’t do much. You can try
to get the check back (if the person you paid hasn’t cashed it already) and
replace it with a check that’s correct. (Good luck on this one.)
If the person has cashed the check, you can’t get the check back. If you over-
paid the person by writing the check for more than you should have, you need
to get the person to pay you the overpayment amount. If you underpaid the
person, you need to write another check for the amount of the underpayment.
If you printed the check but haven’t mailed it, void the printed check. This
operation has two parts. First, write VOID in large letters across the face of
the check form. (Use a ballpoint pen if you’re using multipart forms so that
the second and third parts also show as VOID.) Second, display the Checking
register, highlight the check, and then choose Edit➪Void Check. (This option
marks the check as one that has been voided in the system so that QuickBooks
doesn’t use the check in calculating the account balance.) If you’re voiding an
incorrectly printed check, you need to first create a transaction for the check
number that printed incorrectly and then void that transaction.
Of course, if you want to reissue a voided check, just enter the check all over
again — only this time, try to be more careful.
If you notice only after clicking OK in the Did Checks Print OK? dialog box
that a check printed incorrectly, you can tell QuickBooks you want to reprint
the check in one of two ways. If you have the register window displayed, you
can change the check’s number from 007, for example, to To Print. If you have
the Write Checks window displayed, you can select the To Be Printed box.
203
Chapter 10: Check Printing 101

Oh where, oh where do 
unprinted checks go?
Unprinted checks — those that you entered by using the Write Checks window
but haven’t yet printed — are stored in the Checking register. To identify them
as unprinted checks, QuickBooks puts To Print in the Number line. What’s
more, when you tell QuickBooks to print the unprinted checks, what it really
does is print the checks in the register that have To Print in the Number line.
All this knowledge is of little practical value in most instances, but it results
in several interesting possibilities.
For example, you can enter the checks that you want to print directly into the
register — all you need to do is type To Print in the Number line.
Printing a Checking Register
You can print a Checking register or a register for any other account, too.
Follow these steps to print a register:
1. Open the account register you want to print.
Choose Banking➪Use Register. If you have more than one bank account,
select the account register you want to print from the drop-down list box
and click OK.
204
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 
A big bad warning concerning check voiding
In general, you shouldn’t void checks from a
previous year (you would do this by using the
Void command in the Edit menu). If you do, you’ll
adjust the previous year’s expenses, which
sounds okay, but you don’t want to do this
because (a) it means you can no longer prepare
income statements and balance sheets that
correspond to your financial statements and tax
returns and (b) because you’ve already presum-
ably included the check in your deductions for
the previous year. If you do have a check that
should be voided — say it’s outstanding and has
never been cashed or was a mistake in the first
place — record a journal entry into the current
year that undoes the effect of the check.

2. Choose File➪Print Register.
You see the Print Register dialog box, shown in Figure 10-6.
3. Fill in the Date Range text boxes.
To print a register of something other than the current year-to-date
transactions, use the From and Through text boxes. This step is pretty
darn obvious, isn’t it? You just move the cursor to the From and Through
text boxes and type the range of months that the register should include.
4. If you want, select the Print Splits Detail check box.
As you know, a register doesn’t show all the messy details, such as the
Items and Expenses tab information. But you can select this check box
to include all this stuff on your printed register.
5. Click OK.
You see the Print Lists dialog box, shown in Figure 10-7.
Figure 10-7:
The 
Print Lists
dialog box.
Figure 10-6:
The Print
Register
dialog box.
205
Chapter 10: Check Printing 101

6. If everything is cool, click the Print button and skip the remaining
steps. If you want to change options in the Print Lists dialog box, pro-
ceed to the next step.
You don’t have to fool around with the Print Lists dialog box. If you want
to print a register pronto, just click Print, and QuickBooks sends the reg-
ister on its merry way to your printer. Then again, if you’re the sort of
person who likes to fool around with this kind of stuff, carry on with the
rest of these steps.
If you want to see the effect that the different settings in this dialog box
have, just experiment. You can’t hurt anything or anybody.
7. (Optional) Print the report to disk.
To print the report to disk as a text file, select the File option button and
choose one of the following Print To options:
• Choose ASCII Text File if you want to create a text file (for example,
when you want to import the register into a word-processing 
program).
• Choose Comma Delimited File to import the register into Microsoft
Excel or Lotus 1-2-3.
• Choose Tab Delimited File to, for example, import the register into
a database program. (Oooh . . . fancy. . . .)
8. Choose the paper orientation.
Which direction do you want the report to be printed — Portrait (regular)
or Landscape (sideways)? Just click the appropriate option button.
9. (Optional) Tell QuickBooks which pages to print.
Use the Print Range option buttons and text boxes to limit the pages for
QuickBooks to print.
10. (Optional) Color your world — print your report in color.
If you have a color printer and want to print the register in color, select
the Print In Color (Color Printers Only) check box.
11. (Optional) Preview the report.
To see how your settings will affect the report before you actually print
it, click Preview. QuickBooks shows you the results on-screen. This feature
has probably saved more trees than you can imagine.
12. Click Print.
After you have the report exactly the way you want it (and not one
moment before!), click Print, and QuickBooks finally prints the register.

Chapter 11
Online with QuickBooks
In This Chapter
 Using the QuickBooks online banking and payment services
 Using the QuickBooks online payroll service
 Reviewing other online services
I
n this chapter, I start by discussing QuickBooks’ online banking and bill
payment features — which are pretty cool tools for some businesses. At
the end of the chapter, I also briefly discuss the online payroll services that,
finally, I have enough practical experience with to talk about intelligently and
authoritatively.
One important Web-related feature that isn’t described in this chapter is the
QuickBooks Web Site Builder. Refer to Chapter 17 for information about how
to work with that tool — and for some down-to-earth advice on Web publishing
in general.
Doing the Electronic Banking Thing
Before I discuss using the QuickBooks online banking and payment services,
you need to consider whether these features even make sense for you and your
business. Online banking does make sense for some people — maybe even
you. But then again, it may be more like the fins on a ’62 Cadillac: cool, but not
that cool.
So what’s the commotion about?
For QuickBooks, online banking includes two parts: online banking itself and
online bill payment. Basically, online banking enables you to transmit account
transfer instructions to your bank and download, or retrieve, account informa-
tion electronically by using your computer and modem. Online bill payment
allows you to transmit payment instructions electronically. (You basically tell
your bank to write, stamp, and mail a check so that you don’t have to.)

And that, my friend, is about all there is to online banking.
A thousand reasons not to bank online
I don’t know whether you should bank online, really. But I’ll share some
thoughts with you.
On its face, online banking sounds pretty neat. And I guess it is neat — in its
own little way. I do use the service. And I save time. But online banking does
have some problems:
 To use the full-blown service, you need to use a bank that has signed up
for Intuit’s service. Many, many big banks have signed up. More banks
sign up all the time, of course, but some haven’t yet. So if your bank hasn’t
jumped on the bandwagon — that is, the Intuit bandwagon — you can’t
really jump on the bandwagon either. Or at least not as a full-fledged
member of the band. (I talk more about Intuit’s other online services later
in the chapter.)
To find out whether your bank provides online banking, choose Banking➪
Set Up Online Financial Services➪Online Financial Institutions List. After
you’re connected to the Internet, QuickBooks displays a list of the banks
that support Intuit’s flavor of online banking.
 Although a totally electronic system sounds really efficient and very slick,
you need to realize that online bill payment (a key component of online
banking) often isn’t that efficient or slick because, to be quite honest, the
system isn’t totally electronic.
“What the . . .” you’re saying. “I thought that was the point.” Let me
explain: For better or worse, most businesses are still set up to — and
still expect to — receive paper checks with remittance advises. So what
often happens when you transmit payment instructions is that the bank
or online payment service simply writes (and prints) a check for you.
Think about that for a minute. If the bank is printing your check, you still
have all the disadvantages of a printed check:
• You still need to allow extra time for mailing.
• You still have the possibility that the check will get lost.
• You still have the possibility that the check will be misapplied. (In
other words, the check to pay your power bill may instead be
applied to your neighbor’s account.)
 What’s more, you also have the extra complication of having your bank
mucking all this stuff up instead of you.
 Best of all, the bank charges for this service. (Remember that banks and
software companies think that online banking is an exciting new way for
them to make money.)
208
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

 Receiving payments from your bank, as opposed to directly from you,
also may confuse your vendors. The confusion occurs because the checks
they receive come all bundled up in these cute little envelopes that must
be torn along the perforation on just about all sides. And you can’t send
a remittance slip with an online payment. So vendors can easily credit
your account incorrectly, which can lead to problems. (My power com-
pany regularly threatens to turn off the gas to my office because even
though my electric and gas charges are included on the same bill, the
power company doesn’t like me to send one check via the QuickBooks
online bill payment system. It needs two checks — one for the electric
bill and one for the gas bill.)
One other problem bears mentioning. When you use online banking, you
create a vastly more complex system without clear responsibilities for 
problem-solving and technical support. And that means that when you 
have problems, you often can’t call someone to get help. (No kidding. Just
yesterday, some poor guy e-mailed me because his online banking stuff wasn’t
working: Intuit blamed the bank, the bank blamed his PC hardware, the PC
company blamed Intuit. . . . This guy has a problem nobody can solve or will
solve.) This is important to understand, so let me briefly outline the steps
that an online payment may take:
1. You enter the transaction in QuickBooks.
2. You or QuickBooks makes an Internet connection.
3. QuickBooks uses the Internet connection to send the transaction to 
the bank.
4. The bank typically creates a check, which it mails to the person you’re
paying.
5. The person you’re paying gets the check, hopefully, and credits your
account.
Five simple steps, right? Wrong. Any of these five steps can go wrong, and if
one does, you don’t actually make the payment or transfer, and you won’t
know why:
 If QuickBooks or your computer has a bug, it may say you’ve entered and
transmitted a transaction when in fact you haven’t. This has happened
to me.
 If your Internet connection doesn’t work or doesn’t work dependably, you
can’t send the online transaction. I’ve had problems both with online
banking at home over a dial-up Internet connection (bad telephone cord)
and at work using a network connection and a DSL connection (either an
incorrectly configured network or a bad DSL line).
209
Chapter 11: Online with QuickBooks

 If the bank screws up printing or mailing the check, well, of course your
check won’t get there. (I’ve had this happen, too, no kidding.
QuickBooks lets you enter a five-line address on a check, but the check
printed by the bank or online payment service can have only four lines.
So QuickBooks just removes the fifth line of the address block.)
I don’t mean to rant here, but whenever any of these problems occurs, you
won’t actually know what’s gone wrong — only that something has gone
wrong. And you’ll be responsible for solving the problem — even though it
may be the fault of your bank, Intuit, your Internet service provider, the tele-
phone company, or somebody else.
Making sense of online banking
So what should you do? Let me make a suggestion: If you use a bank that pro-
vides online banking, go ahead and try the service. It isn’t very expensive —
probably a few dollars a month. If, later on, you decide that you don’t like the
service, you can always go back to banking the old-fashioned way.
If you use a bank that doesn’t provide online banking services and you’re really
bummed out about it, you can try the online bill payment component of online
banking by using Intuit’s online bill payment service. Online bill payment is
the part where you send instructions either to your bank (if it provides the
service) or to Intuit to write and mail checks for you. You can use the online
bill payment service with any account — in essence, you just give Intuit per-
mission to automatically deduct money from your account to make payments
for you.
If you use a bank that doesn’t provide online banking and you couldn’t care
less, don’t try the online banking stuff, don’t read any more of this chapter,
and consider taking the rest of the afternoon off.
Signing up for the service
All you need to sign up for online banking service is to choose Banking➪
Set Up Online Financial Services➪Apply for Online Banking. QuickBooks
starts an online application wizard that walks you through the steps to apply
for the online banking service. Just follow the on-screen instructions and,
voilà, that’s it. Another benefit of being literate.
To actually begin transmitting online payments or making account inquiries,
you need to complete the application and have that application processed.
Note, too, that you can also usually complete the application by filling out
paperwork from your bank and turning that in. You don’t have to use the
online application process.

Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

Making an online payment
Plan to create and send online payments a good week before they’re due. For
the online bill payment service to process your request and then print and
send a check takes time. And a check that your bank sends doesn’t go through
the mail any faster than a check you send yourself. So don’t expect online bill
payment to save you any time over sending checks you print or handwrite
yourself.
After you sign up for online banking, making payments is easy. Just follow
these steps:
1. Choose Banking➪Write Checks.
Or select Banking in the Navigators list and click the Checks icon. If you’ve
written checks with QuickBooks before, you see your old familiar friend,
the Write Checks window, shown in Figure 11-1.
2. Click the Bank Account drop-down list at the top of the window and
choose the account from which you want to write this check.
Choosing the account is a really important step. Make sure that you’re
accessing the right account before you write a check.
Figure 11-1:
The Write
Checks
window.
Hey, this
looks
familiar,
doesn’t it?
211
Chapter 11: Online with QuickBooks

3. Select the Online Payment check box.
Selecting this check box is another important step. If you don’t select
this box, you’re not making an online payment; you’re just writing a 
regular check that you need to print or handwrite.
4. Fill in the check.
If payee appears on one of your name lists, the AutoFill feature fills in
the name of the payee in the Pay to the Order Of line after you type a
few letters. For online bill payment, you must have the correct address.
If the address is incomplete, QuickBooks warns you and asks you to 
correct it. (If you haven’t entered a transaction for this person or party
before or added them to a list, QuickBooks asks you to Quick Add or Set
Up the payee name. Do that.
By the way, QuickBooks makes you collect more information about
anyone you’re going to pay with an online payment.)
Enter the amount of the check next to the dollar sign and press Tab.
QuickBooks writes out the amount for you on the Dollars line.
5. Fill in the Expenses and Items tabs, if necessary.
Don’t know what these tabs are? Chapter 6 explains them in minute
detail. Start turning those pages.
6. Click the Save & New or Save & Close button to finish writing the
check.
Click Save & New to write another check or click Save & Close if you’re
finished writing checks for the moment. There you have it. Your check 
is written, entered in the Checking register, and ready to be sent so that
your bank or Intuit can print and mail it.
And you thought this stuff was going to be tough, didn’t you?
People who have grown accustomed to Quicken, a cousin product of
QuickBooks, may want to use the register window to make online payments.
You can use the register window in QuickBooks, too, although doing so isn’t
quite as slick. You just enter the payment in the usual way — except that you
type the word SEND in the Check Number text box.
Transferring money electronically
You can electronically transfer money between bank accounts, too — as long
as the accounts are at the same bank. (Both accounts, of course, also need to
be set for online banking.) Here’s what you need to do:
1. Choose Banking➪Transfer Funds.
212
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

Or, select Banking in the Navigators list and click the Transfer Funds
icon. You see the Transfer Funds between Accounts window, shown in
Figure 11-2.
2. In the Transfer Funds From drop-down list box, select the bank
account that you’re going to transfer the money from.
Choose the account from the drop-down list.
3. In the Transfer Funds To drop-down list box, select the bank account
to which you want to transfer the money.
Select the account that you want to receive the funds.
4. Select the Online Funds Transfer check box.
Doing so tells QuickBooks that you want to make this transfer 
electronically.
5. Enter the amount that you want to transfer in the Transfer Amount
field and fill in the Memo text box.
Someday, you may go into the register for the account you’re transferring
money from and wonder where you transferred this money and why.
Filling in the Memo line solves this little mystery beforehand.
6. Click the Save & Close button.
The transfer is recorded. After you transmit the transfer instructions
(which I describe a little later in this chapter), the transfer transaction 
is posted to your account — maybe not immediately, but as fast as a
telephone transfer or ATM machine transfer is posted.
Figure 11-2:
The Transfer
Funds

Accounts
window.
213
Chapter 11: Online with QuickBooks

Changing instructions
QuickBooks doesn’t actually send, or transmit, your payment and transfer
instructions until you tell it to. This little fact means that you can change or
edit your payment instructions (what you enter with the Write Checks window)
and your transfer instructions (what you enter with the Transfer Funds
between Accounts window) until you actually transmit them. You edit online
payments and account transfers in the same way that you edit regular pay-
ments and account transfers. Refer to Chapter 8 if you need more information.
Transmitting instructions
After you describe the online payments and account transfers that you want
QuickBooks to make, you transmit that information to the bank. To do so,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Banking➪Online Banking Center.
Or select Banking from the Navigators list and then click the Online
Banking icon. You see the Online Banking Center window, shown in
Figure 11-3.
2. In the Financial Institution list box at the top of the screen, select the
bank to which you’re transmitting payment and transfer instructions.
Choose the bank from the drop-down list.
214
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 
Finding a bank you can trust
Say you want to use Intuit’s online banking ser-
vices but your bank isn’t signed up. In response
to this problem, many people may say, “Well,
Dodo-brain, just switch banks.” But not you. You
know that switching banks is harder than it
sounds, especially for small businesses — and
often not a smart move. Many factors go into a
successful small business banking relationship:
 Convenience: Doing your banking should 
be easy.
 Trust based on a long history: That way, you
can borrow money or set up merchant credit
card accounts without using your children
for collateral.
 Good rapport with a personal banker or
loan officer: If you ever have a problem —
and I hope that doesn’t happen — you have
someone you can talk to.
Sure, online banking is neat. Like Cadillac fins.
But online banking is neither the only nor the
most important feature you need to look at when
you consider a bank.

3. Review the payment and transfer instructions one last time.
Take one last peek at the Items to Send list to make sure that the payment
and transfer instructions you’re sending are correct. If you have questions
about a particular instruction, click it and then click the Edit button. If
you know that a particular payment instruction is incorrect, click it and
then click the Delete button.
4. Click the Send button to transmit the payment and transfer 
instructions.
If you’re transmitting payment and transfer instructions for the first time,
QuickBooks probably prompts you to change your personal identification
number, or PIN. If you’ve transmitted payment and transfer instructions
before, QuickBooks prompts you to enter your existing PIN.
5. Review any transactions that the bank tells you about.
Figure 11-3 shows two items received from the online bank — electronic
statements that you can use to see cleared transactions and to reconcile
your account. To view an online statement, click the statement and then
click the View button.
6. Click the Close box.
Hey, when you’re done, you’re done.

Chapter 11: Online with QuickBooks

Message in a bottle
Doing all your banking electronically can be a little unsettling when you’re first
starting out. What if, for example, you have a question? All you do is send an
e-mail message to the bank asking the people there whatever question you
would normally ask in a telephone call or at the drive-through window. To do
so, follow these steps:
1. Choose Banking➪Create Online Banking Message.
QuickBooks displays the Home Banking Message dialog box and fills in
the bank name (as long as you use online banking services with only one
bank). If you use online banking services with more than one bank, select
the name of the bank to whom you want to send a message from the
Message To drop-down list box.
2. Click the Subject box and then type a brief description of your mes-
sage’s subject.
I may be telling you something you already know, but most e-mail readers
simply display a list of messages that includes the sender, the message
subject, and the date. Therefore, the message subject that you use is one
of the first bits of message information that the bank sees.
3. Select the online account that you’re going to discuss in the message.
4. Click the Message box and then type your message.
You’re on your own here.
5. (Optional) Click the Print button to print a copy of your message.
6. Click OK.
When you click OK, you add the message to the list of stuff that’s ready
to send the next time you go online with your bank. You can send the
instructions immediately by following the steps in the preceding section,
“Transmitting instructions.”
Using the Online Payroll Service
QuickBooks provides three payroll services: Do-It-Yourself Payroll, which is
essentially the stuff I describe in Chapter 12; Premier Payroll, which is a full-
blown service like the one that other outside payroll services such as ADP
and Paychex provide; and QuickBooks Assisted Payroll, which is an online
payroll service.
The Assisted Payroll online payroll service provides all the features of the 
Do-It-Yourself Payroll service plus some other features such as the filing of
payroll tax returns and the payment of payroll tax deposits.
216
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

Although Assisted Payroll sounds pretty good, I think it’s not a good choice
for most people. Unfortunately, it’s too little help for about half the businesses
and too much help for the other half. But let me share some comments:
 The QuickBooks online payroll service is cheaper than what you’d pay
to an outside service bureau, such as QuickBooks Premier Payroll, ADP
or Paychex, but you have to do more work with QuickBooks, so you’re
really earning your cost savings. (For what used to cost me about $1,000
a year with Paychex, I paid roughly $500 a year by using the QuickBooks
Assisted Payroll service.)
 You need to watch the fees for any payroll service because they can easily
nickel and dime you to death. I used to have a very small manufacturing
business, for example. Usually, I was preparing fewer than six paychecks
a pay period. For biweekly paychecks and all my federal and state tax
returns, I paid around $1,000 to one of the large, nationally known payroll
services, Paychex. When I moved to the QuickBooks service, I cut this
amount in half — which was cool. But read on . . .
 A service bureau, in my experience, provides far better service than even
the Assisted Payroll service (mostly because you deal with a real, live
person you can question).
I eventually canceled the Assisted Payroll service and went back to the
Do-It-Yourself service (which means I do all the work myself, as described
in Chapter 12, and pay Intuit about $130 a year for the tax withholding
information) because of the errors the Assisted Payroll service kept
making. The final straw concerning the QuickBooks Assisted Payroll 
service was when the Internal Revenue Service issued me a lien notice
because of confusion related to the service’s handling of payroll tax
deposits. (A lien notice says that the IRS is about to grab money from my
checking account.) For the record, the only money that I owed — roughly
$1,000 in penalties — stemmed from an error that the QuickBooks
Assisted Payroll service made and took weeks to clear up. Geez.
 The QuickBooks Do-It-Yourself and Assisted Payroll payroll services
probably provide you with greater flexibility than QuickBooks Premier
Payroll, Paychex, or ADP, other popular payroll services. You can do pay-
roll when you want (early, late, in the middle of the night, and so on) and
easily make last-minute changes to pay rates. And this is great. I admit it.
 If a payroll service — any payroll service — doesn’t make available state
payroll tax returns help for your state, use a local payroll service. The
paycheck calculations and the federal payroll returns are the easy ones.
The state returns are where you want the help.
 In spite of the new midyear conversion wizards supplied by the
QuickBooks Do-It-Yourself and Assisted Payroll services, you’ll probably
find it easiest to convert at the start of next year (whatever year that is
for you). By converting at the start of a payroll year, you can avoid record-
ing all the year-to-date numbers for employees.
217
Chapter 11: Online with QuickBooks

The QuickBooks.com Web site provides information about the payroll services
that Intuit provides and a form you can use to request a price quote.
A Quick Review of the Other
Online Opportunities
Intuit provides several other small-business-type services to QuickBooks
users. For example, Intuit has also arranged for a merchant credit card service,
which you can apply for online and then use online for receiving payments
and even getting charge authorizations. Finally, through its Web site, Intuit
also says it provides a small-business purchasing service that makes price
shopping over the Internet easy, or at least easier.
If you have questions about the current state of any of these products or 
services, visit the QuickBooks.com Web site and search for the name of 
the service.

P
ayroll is one of the major headaches of running a small business. When I
think of all the time I’ve wasted figuring out withholding amounts, writing
checks, and trying to fill out wickedly ridiculous payroll tax returns, it just
makes me want to scream. Fortunately, QuickBooks helps. And in a big way.
In this chapter, I explain how.
Getting Ready to Do Payroll 
without QuickBooks’ Help
The easiest way to do payroll, quite frankly, is to sign up with an outside ser-
vice bureau, such as ADP or Paychex or QuickBooks’ new Complete Payroll
service. If you have an accountant, you may want to also ask him or her about
other, cheaper local payroll services.

Of course, the easiest route is often the most expensive, and payroll 
services are no exception. In my experience, these full-meal-deal services
tend to run about twice the price of the QuickBooks Assisted Payroll 
service after you add everything up. But all you need to do is make a phone
call. (Check your telephone book for a local number or, if you’re interested 
in the QuickBooks service, check the QuickBooks.com Web site.) The 
payroll service will send someone nice out to your office. A few days later, 
all you’ll need to do is make a phone call or send a fax when you want to 
pay employees.
Getting Ready to Do Payroll 
with QuickBooks
If you want to use either QuickBooks Do-It-Yourself Payroll or QuickBooks
Assisted Payroll because you want to save money, aren’t scared of a little
paperwork, or maybe want the extra flexibility that comes with doing it 
yourself, you need to sign up for the QuickBooks Do-It-Yourself Payroll (also
known as the Basic Payroll Service) or QuickBooks Assisted Payroll (previ-
ously known as Deluxe Payroll Service.)
To sign up for either service, get ready to hop on the Internet. Follow these
steps:
1. Choose Employees➪Set Up Payroll.
Or Select Employees in the Navigators list and then click the Set Up
Payroll icon.
QuickBooks connects to the Internet and displays the first page of 
a multiple-page Web form that enables you to set up either the 
Do-It-Yourself Payroll Service or the Assisted Payroll Service (see 
Figure 12-1).
2. Follow the on-screen instructions.
I’m not going to repeat the on-screen instructions for setting up the 
payroll service. Providing that kind of information would be, well,
extremely redundant. Just carefully follow the instructions, and you’ll
have no trouble.
220
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

Doing Taxes the Right Way
You need a couple of other things if you want to do payroll the right way: 
a federal employer identification number, a state employer identification
number if you withhold state income taxes, an unemployment tax identifica-
tion number, and some W-4 tax forms. (If you want to do payroll the wrong
way, you’re reading the wrong book.)
Getting an employer ID number
To get an employer ID number, you need to file an SS-4, or Request for
Employer Identification Number form, with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
so that you can get an employer identification number. You can get this form
at the IRS Web site (www.irs.gov) or by calling the IRS and asking for one.
Figure 12-1:
One of the
pages of the
QuickBooks’
Payroll
Setup
Wizard.
221
Chapter 12: Payroll

You can also apply for and receive an employer identification number over the
telephone. You still need to fill out the SS-4 form, however, so that you can
answer the questions that the IRS asks during the short telephone application
process. (You also need to mail or fax the form to the IRS after you have your
little telephone conversation.)
Having employees do their part
You also need to do something else before you can know how to handle all
those taxes — you need to have your employees fill out W-4 forms to tell you
what filing status they’ll use and how many personal exemptions they’ll claim.
Guess where you get blank W-4s? From your friendly IRS agent or the IRS Web
site (www.irs.gov).
Paying Your Employees
After you subscribe to the QuickBooks Payroll Service, set up your payroll
accounts, and get an employer identification number, you’re ready to pay
someone. This section is going to blow your mind, especially if you’ve been
doing payroll manually. The process makes your whole decision to use
QuickBooks to do your payroll worthwhile. Here’s how:
1. Start the payroll process by choosing Employees➪Pay Employees.
Or select Employees in the Navigators list and click the Pay Employees
icon. The Select Employees to Pay window appears, which simply lists
employees, their salaries or hourly wages, and the last payroll date. If
you don’t see a name that you’re looking for in this list, then you never
added the employee to your Employee list. If you need help adding
employees to your list, read Chapter 2.
2. Change any settings that you want to.
You shouldn’t need to use any of the Select Employees to Pay window’s
boxes and buttons to change the way that QuickBooks does payroll. But
you can make several changes:
• If you’re not going to print the checks — maybe you handwrite
them and just use QuickBooks to keep the books — leave the To
Be Printed check box deselected.
• Confirm the bank account from which the employees are paid in
the Bank Account drop-down list box.
222
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

• Typically, you want to leave the Enter Hours and Preview Check
before Creating option selected, just in case. With this option
selected, QuickBooks displays a summary preview for each pay-
check you create. If you select the other option, Create Check 
without Preview Using Hours Below and Last Quantities, QuickBooks
doesn’t let you check its work first — QuickBooks just creates the
checks.
• Set the Check Date and the Pay Period Ends dates appropriately.
3. Select the employees that you’re paying and click the Create button.
If you’re paying all the employees listed, click the Mark All button on the
right side of the Select Employees to Pay screen. If you need to mark the
employees individually, click next to each one in the left column — the
column with the check mark in the heading. Then click the Create button
to have QuickBooks create “draft” versions of the payroll checks you
need for employees.
QuickBooks next displays the Preview Paycheck window if you indicated
in Step 2 that you want to preview payroll checks. This window simply
summarizes what you pay an employee. For example, if Joe worked 80
hours and he earns $15 an hour, the window shows that you owe Joe
$1,200. The window also shows the payroll tax and withholding amounts
that QuickBooks, ever the faithful companion, has calculated for you.
4. Fill out the payroll information, as necessary.
The main thing to pay attention to in the Preview Paycheck window is the
Earnings box. It shows what QuickBooks assumes you’ll pay an employee.
In the Earnings box, you fill in the number of hours the person worked
and apply these hours to a customer or job, if necessary.
The Preview Paycheck window also includes an Other Payroll Items input
area. In the Other Payroll Items box, you enter commissions, additions
(such as tips, bonuses, and expense reimbursements), deductions (such
as union dues and 401(k) contributions), and company contributions
(such as insurance benefits or 401(k) matching amounts). You also can
change the payroll item or rate or add another payroll item, if you need to.
Watch this. QuickBooks calculates the company and employee taxes and
the amount of the net check — this information appears in the Employee
Summary area and the Company Summary area of the Preview Paycheck
window. If some information is inaccurate, click the amount and change
it, either by deleting it or replacing it with the correct information.
You may also note that QuickBooks keeps totals for both the current
check and the year to date.
223
Chapter 12: Payroll

5. Click the Create button to record the paycheck transaction.
After you check all the employees’ paychecks, QuickBooks returns to
the Select Employees to Pay dialog box.
6. Print the checks.
You can print checks from the Select Employees to Pay window by clicking
the Print Paychecks button. QuickBooks prints paychecks just like it prints
regular checks.
Got questions about printing checks? Take a look at Chapter 10.
Paying Payroll Liabilities
Make no mistake. Big Brother wants the money you withhold from an
employee’s payroll check for federal income taxes, Social Security, and
Medicare. Big Brother also wants the payroll taxes you owe — the matching
Social Security and Medicare taxes, federal unemployment taxes, and so on.
So every so often you need to pay Big Brother the amounts you owe.
If you withhold money from employees’ checks for other reasons (perhaps
for health insurance or retirement savings), these amounts are payroll liabili-
ties that need to be paid to the appropriate parties.
Paying tax liabilities if you use 
the Assisted Payroll service
Fortunately, if you’re using the QuickBooks Assisted Payroll service, your fed-
eral tax liabilities and most (perhaps all) of your state tax liabilities are paid
as part of the service. In other words, Intuit withdraws money from your bank
account and uses this money to pay the appropriate federal or state govern-
ment agency.
Be sure to check which state payroll taxes QuickBooks calculates and will pay.
In Washington state, which is where my business is located, QuickBooks won’t
calculate a couple of state payroll taxes, so I have to calculate these myself
(on the payroll tax form) and pay them with a check.
224
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

Paying tax liabilities if you use the 
Do-It-Yourself Payroll service
If you’re using the Do-It-Yourself Payroll service, you need to pay the payroll
liabilities yourself. To do this, choose Employees➪Pay Payroll Liabilities,
whereupon the Select Date Range for Liabilities dialog box appears. Select the
appropriate date range and click OK. When you do so, QuickBooks displays
the Pay Liabilities window, shown in Figure 12-2.
All you have to do now is choose the liabilities or taxes that you want to pay
by clicking in the left column and indicating the portion you want to pay of
the amount due. (In Figure 12-2, no payroll liabilities show, but in a real-life
business situation you would see them listed.) Unless you’ve selected the
Review Liability Check to Enter Expenses/Penalties option, QuickBooks auto-
matically writes the check and puts it in your register. QuickBooks automati-
cally gives the check the appropriate date and schedules it to pop up in your
Reminders window at the right time.
Figure 12-2:
The Pay
Liabilities

225
Chapter 12: Payroll

When do you make payroll tax deposits? That’s a question that frequently
comes up. The general rule about United States federal tax deposits is this: If
your accumulated payroll taxes are less than $2,500 for the quarter, you can
just pay those taxes the following month with your quarterly return. This law
is called the De Minimis rule. (My understanding is that the law was named
after Congresswoman Dee Minimis.) If you owe more than $2,500, other spe-
cial rules come into play that determine whether you pay deposits monthly,
semimonthly, weekly, or even immediately. The IRS tells you, by the way, how
often you’re supposed to make payments.
If you owe a large amount of money, you’re required to deposit it almost
immediately. For example, if you owe $100,000 or more, you need to make 
the payroll tax deposit by the next banking day. Some nuances apply to these
rules, so unless you don’t owe very much and, therefore, can fall back on the
De Minimis rule, you may want to consult a tax adviser (or call the Internal
Revenue Service).
The general rule when writing payroll checks is to make the last checks you
write the ones that pay your federal and state tax deposits when they come
due. You’ll never get into late payment trouble if you follow this approach. It
will also make your life a lot easier when it comes time to fill out Schedule B
of Form 941, if you have to do so.
To make a payroll tax deposit, just deliver your check with a federal tax deposit
coupon to a financial institution that’s qualified as a depository for federal
taxes or to the Federal Reserve Bank that serves your geographical area. The
IRS should have already sent you a book of coupons as a result of your asking
for an employer ID number. And one other thing: Make your check payable to
the depository or to the Federal Reserve.
Paying other non-tax liabilities
If you’re paying non-tax liabilities for things like employee health insurance or
retirement savings — it doesn’t matter whether you’re using the Do-It-Yourself
Payroll service or the Assisted Payroll service — you also use the Pay Payroll
Liabilities command (which I describe in the preceding section).
Preparing Quarterly Payroll Tax Returns
At the end of every quarter, you need to file a quarterly payroll tax return.
(By quarters here, I’m referring to calendar quarters.) If you’re a business
owner, for example, you must file a Form 941, which is a form that you fill out
to say how much you paid in gross wages, how much you withheld in federal
taxes, and how much you owe for employer payroll taxes.
226
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

If you have to fill out Schedule B of Form 941, I hope that you heeded my earlier
advice and just paid the liabilities as they came due. This step makes filling
out Schedule B a piece of cake: The date your liability check was due is the
same as the date you wrote and deposited the check. You can use QuickBooks
to create a list of all the dates on which you wrote liabilities checks in the
quarter by finding just one liabilities check in your register and then clicking
the QuickReport button. Then set the date for the correct quarter. QuickBooks
produces a list of your liabilities checks in the blink of an eye. If, on the other
hand, you didn’t always pay your liabilities as they came due, you need to open
your Payroll Liabilities account and scroll through the whole quarter to find
the day your balance went over $2,500.
If you have household employees, such as a nanny, you must file a Form 942.
Again, Form 942 is just a form you fill out to say how much you paid in gross
wages, withheld in federal taxes, and owe in payroll taxes.
You’ll find that QuickBooks makes filling out these forms darn simple.
Using the QuickBooks Assisted 
Payroll service
If you’re using the QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service, the service fills out
and sends the payroll tax forms for you.
Using the QuickBooks Do-It-Yourself
Payroll service
If you’re using the Do-It-Yourself Payroll service, you need to fill out and send
the payroll tax forms, but don’t worry — QuickBooks prepares the 941 for you.
If you need to fill out the 942 or a state payroll tax form, QuickBooks can also
be of great help. All you really need to know for these other forms is what the
gross wages totals are.
To get the gross wages totals and the balances in each of the payroll tax lia-
bility accounts at the end of the quarter, print the Payroll Summary report.
Choose Reports➪Employees & Payroll➪Payroll Summary. QuickBooks dis-
plays the Payroll Summary report. Specify the range of dates as the quarter
for which you’re preparing a quarterly report. Scroll across to the Total
column, which shows the gross wages upon which your employer payroll
taxes are calculated.
227
Chapter 12: Payroll

The withholding account amounts are the amounts you’ve recorded to date
for the employee’s federal income taxes withheld and the employee’s Social
Security and Medicare taxes, so you need to double these figures to get the
actual Social Security and Medicare taxes owed. Choose Reports➪Employees
& Payroll➪Payroll Liabilities. QuickBooks creates a report that tallies these
amounts.
QuickBooks will create and print out a copy of Form 941 for you, so you 
don’t have to get out your calculator or mess around with lining up the 
red form in your typewriter. Just choose Employees➪Process Payroll 
Forms and then click the button for the appropriate form. QuickBooks 
runs you through a wizard that asks you for your state and the number of
employees you had over the quarter. QuickBooks then summarizes each 
line of the form. When QuickBooks is done, all you have to do is print out 
the form.
If your accountant fills out the 941 or 942 form for you, you don’t need to read
this stuff. Your accountant won’t have any problem completing the quarterly
payroll tax return by using the QuickBooks Payroll report, and in fact — I kid
you not — your accountant will probably even enjoy doing it.
Filing Annual Returns 
and Wage Statements
At the end of the year, you need to file some annual returns — such as 
the 940 federal unemployment tax return — and the W-2 and W-3 wages 
statements.
You need to prepare any state unemployment annual summary before you
prepare the 940 because the 940 requires information from the state returns.
Using the QuickBooks Assisted 
Payroll service
If you’re using the Assisted Payroll service, the service automatically fills out
and sends these forms for you.
228
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

Using the QuickBooks Do-It-Yourself
Payroll service
If you’re using the Do-It-Yourself Payroll service, you need to fill out and send
these forms in-house, but you get lots of help from QuickBooks. QuickBooks
creates and prints the 940 for you. All you have to do is choose Employees➪
Process Payroll Forms and click the button for the appropriate form.
QuickBooks asks you for a little information, and then it does the calculating
for you. Just check the QuickBooks records against your own, and if everything
matches, print that puppy out. To look over the QuickBooks data included
in the form and verify its integrity, it helps to print an Employee Earnings
Summary report.
For the W-2 statements and the summary W-3 (which summarizes your W-2s),
you just choose Employees➪Process W-2s. Select the employees from the list
and print away.
If you have a little trouble, call the IRS. If you have a great deal of trouble,
splurge and have someone else fill out the forms for you. Filling out these
forms doesn’t take a rocket scientist, by the way. Any experienced book-
keeper can do it for you.
Please don’t construe my “rocket scientist” comment as personal criticism if
this payroll taxes business seems terribly complicated. My experience is that
some people — and you may very well be one of them — just don’t have an
interest in things such as payroll accounting. If, on the other hand, you’re a
“numbers are my friend” kind of person, you’ll have no trouble at all after you
learn the ropes.
The State Wants Some Money, Too
Yeah. I haven’t talked about state payroll taxes — at least not in great detail. 
I wish that I could provide this sort of detailed, state-specific help to you.
Unfortunately, doing so would make this chapter about 150 pages long. It
would also cause me to go stark raving mad.
My sanity and laziness aside, you still need to deal with state payroll taxes. Let
me say, however, that you apply to state payroll taxes the same basic mechan-
ics that you apply to federal payroll taxes. For example, a state income tax
works the same way as the federal income tax; employer-paid state unemploy-
ment taxes work like the employer-paid federal taxes; and employee-paid state
taxes work like the employee-paid Social Security and Medicare taxes.
229
Chapter 12: Payroll

If you’re tuned in to how federal payroll taxes work in QuickBooks, you really
shouldn’t have a problem with the state payroll taxes — at least, not in terms
of mechanics. Note, however, that QuickBooks can print only federal forms,
not state forms, so you’ll need to fill in those yourself.
The one thing you need to figure out is what your state wants. To do that, you
need to get the state’s payroll tax reporting instructions. You may need to call
the state. Or with a little luck, you may find online instructions at your state’s
Web site. If your state’s Web site isn’t much help, you can probably look up the
state tax people’s telephone number in your local phone book.

The Balancing Act
In This Chapter
 Balancing a non-online bank account
 Eleven things to do if your non-online account doesn’t balance
 Balancing an online bank account
I
want to start this chapter with an important point: Balancing a bank
account in QuickBooks is easy and quick.
I’m not just trying to get you pumped up about an otherwise painfully boring
topic. I don’t think that balancing a bank account is any more exciting than
you do.
My point is simply this: Because bank account balancing can be tedious and
boring, use QuickBooks to speed up the drudgery.
Balancing a Non-Online Bank Account
As I said, balancing a bank account is remarkably easy in QuickBooks. In fact,
I’ll go so far as to say that if you have any problems, they stem from . . . well,
sloppy record keeping that preceded your use of QuickBooks.
Enough of this blather; I’ll get started by describing how you reconcile a 
non-online account. By this awkward label, “non-online bank account,” I just
mean a bank account that isn’t an account set up for online banking. I describe
the steps for balancing online accounts in the section “Balancing an Online
Bank Account,” later in this chapter.

Giving QuickBooks information 
from the bank statement
As you probably know, in a reconciliation, you compare your records of a
bank account with the bank’s records of the same account. You should be
able to explain any difference between the two accounts — usually by pointing
to checks that you’ve written but that haven’t cleared. (Sometimes deposits
fall into the same category; you’ve recorded a deposit and mailed it, but the
bank hasn’t yet credited your account.)
The first step, then, is to supply QuickBooks with the bank’s account infor-
mation. You get this information from your monthly statement. Supply
QuickBooks with the figures it needs, as follows:
232
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 
Why isn’t my opening balance the same 
as the one in QuickBooks?
An opening balance that isn’t the same as the
one shown in the Opening Balance text box can
mean a couple of things.
First, you may have mistakenly cleared a trans-
action the last time you reconciled. If you cleared
a transaction last month that didn’t go through
until this month, your opening balance is wrong.
Go back to the Checking register and start
examining transactions. Each one that’s cleared
has a check mark next to it in the narrow column
between the Payment and Deposit columns. If
one of the checks that appears on this month’s
statement has a check mark, you made a boo-
boo last month. From the Checking register,
click the check mark to remove it. You’re asked
to confirm your actions. The check now appears
in the Reconcile window.
The other reason why the opening balance is
different can be that a transaction that you
cleared in the past got changed. If you deleted
a transaction that occurred before this reconcil-
iation period, for example, it threw your balance
off. Why? Because the transaction that you
deleted helped balance your account the last
time around, but now that transaction is gone.
Whatever happens, don’t fret. If you can’t track
down the faulty transaction, you can just have
QuickBooks adjust the balance for you, which I
explain elsewhere in this chapter. If you fre-
quently find that your accounts don’t balance,
consider using the QuickBooks Audit Trail fea-
ture to track the changes you make to transac-
tions, and then create an Audit Trail report 
when it’s time to reconcile your accounts. To
turn on the Audit Trail feature, choose Edit➪
Preferences, click the Accounting icon, and
select the Use Audit Trail check box on the
Company Preferences tab.

1. Tell QuickBooks you want to reconcile an account.
You can do this by choosing Banking➪Reconcile or by selecting Banking
from the Navigators list and clicking the Reconcile icon. QuickBooks 
displays the Begin Reconciliation dialog box, shown in Figure 13-1.
2. Tell QuickBooks which account you want to reconcile.
Verify that the bank account shown in the Account list box is correct. If
it isn’t — and it might not be if you have several bank accounts — open
the Account list box and select the correct account.
3. Enter the bank statement date into the Statement Date box.
Remember that you can adjust a date one day at a time by using the 
plus (+) and minus (–) keys. You can also click the Calendar button on the
right side of the text box to select a date from the calendar. See the Cheat
Sheet at the front of this book for a list of other secret date-editing tricks.
4. Verify the bank statement opening balance.
QuickBooks displays an amount in the Beginning Balance text box.
(Refer to Figure 13-1.)
If the opening balance isn’t correct, see the sidebar “Why isn’t my opening
balance the same as the one in QuickBooks?” elsewhere in this chapter.
5. Enter the ending balance.
What is the ending, or closing, balance on your bank statement? Whatever
it is, move the cursor to the Ending Balance text box and enter the ending
balance.
Figure 13-1:
The Begin
Recon-
ciliation
dialog box.
233
Chapter 13: The Balancing Act

6. Enter the bank’s service charge.
If the bank statement shows a service charge and you haven’t already
entered it, move the cursor to the Service Charge text box and type the
amount.
7. Enter a transaction date for the service charge transaction.
QuickBooks adds one month to the service charge date from the last
time you reconciled. If this date isn’t correct, type the correct one.
8. Assign the bank’s service charge to an account.
Enter the expense account to which you assign bank service charges in
the first Account text box — the one beside the Date text box. Activate
the drop-down list by clicking the down arrow, highlight the category by
using the arrow keys, and press Enter. I bet anything that you record
these charges in the Bank Service Charges account that QuickBooks sets
up by default.
If you told QuickBooks that you also want to track income and expense
amounts using classes, QuickBooks adds Class boxes to the Begin
Reconciliation dialog box so that you can collect this information. 
Figure 13-1 shows these boxes, for example.
9. Enter the account’s interest income.
If the account earned interest for the month and you haven’t already
entered this figure, type an amount in the Interest Earned text box 
(for example, type 9.17 for $9.17).
10. Enter a transaction date for the interest income transaction.
You already know how to enter dates. I won’t bore you by explaining it
again (but see Step 3 if you’re having trouble).
11. Assign the interest to an account.
Enter the account to which this account’s interest should be assigned 
in the second Account text box. I bet that you record this one under the
Interest Income account, which is near the bottom of the Account drop-
down list. To select a category from the Account list, activate the 
drop-down list by clicking the down arrow, highlight the category, and
press Enter.
12. Click Continue.
After you supply the information that the Begin Reconciliation dialog box
asks for, click the Continue button. QuickBooks displays the Reconcile
window, shown in Figure 13-2.
234
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

Marking cleared checks and deposits
Using the Reconcile window shown in Figure 13-2, you tell QuickBooks which
deposits and checks have cleared at the bank. (Refer to your bank statement
for this information.)
1. Identify the first deposit that has cleared.
You know how to do so, I’m sure. Just leaf through the bank statement
and find the first deposit listed.
2. Mark the first cleared deposit as cleared.
Scroll through the transactions listed in the Deposits, Interests, and
Other Credits section of the Reconcile window, find the deposit, and
then click it. You also can highlight the deposit by using the Tab and
arrow keys and then pressing the spacebar. QuickBooks places a check
mark in front of the deposit to mark it as cleared and updates the
cleared statement balance.
Figure 13-2:
The
Reconcile
window.
235
Chapter 13: The Balancing Act

If you have a large number of deposits to make and you can identify them
quickly, click the Mark All button and then simply unmark the transac-
tions that aren’t on the bank statement. To unmark a transaction, click it.
The check mark disappears.
3. Record any cleared, but missing, deposits.
If you can’t find a deposit, you haven’t entered it into the Checking regis-
ter yet. I can only guess why you haven’t entered it. Maybe you just forgot.
Close or deactivate the Reconcile window by clicking Leave. Now open
the Checking register and enter the deposit in the register in the usual
way. To return to the Reconcile window, either reopen it or reactivate it.
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 for all deposits listed on the bank statement.
Make sure that the dates match and that the amounts of the deposits are
correct. If they’re not, go back to the transactions and correct them. To
get to a transaction, click the Go To button. You see the Write Checks 
or Make Deposits window where the transaction was originally recorded.
Make the corrections there and click Save & Close. You are then returned
to the Reconcile window.
5. Identify the first check that has cleared.
No sweat, right? Just find the first check or withdrawal listed on the
bank statement.
6. Mark the first cleared check as cleared.
Scroll through the transactions listed in the Checks, Payments, and
Service Charges section of the Reconcile window, find the first check,
and then click it. You also can highlight it by pressing Tab and an arrow
key. Then press the spacebar. QuickBooks inserts a check mark to label
this transaction as cleared and updates the cleared statement balance.
7. Record any missing, but cleared, checks.
If you can’t find a check or withdrawal — guess what? — you haven’t
entered it in the register yet. Close or deactivate the Reconcile window
by clicking its Leave button or activating another window. Then display
the Checking register and enter the check or withdrawal. To return to
the Reconcile window, reopen or reactivate it.
8. Repeat Steps 5 through 7 for all withdrawals listed on the bank 
statement.
These steps don’t take very long. Reconciling my account each month takes
me about two minutes. And I’m not joking or exaggerating. By two minutes, I
really mean two minutes.
236
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

If the difference equals zero
After you mark all the cleared checks and deposits, the difference between
the Cleared Balance for the account and the bank statement’s Ending Balance
should equal zero. Notice that I said “should,” not “will.” Figure 13-2, unfortu-
nately, shows a Reconcile window in which everything is not hunky-dory, and
a $0.36 difference exists. Bummer.
If the difference does equal zero, you’re finished. Just click the Reconcile Now
button. QuickBooks displays a congratulatory message box telling you that
the reconciliation is complete. As a reward for being such a good boy or girl,
the message box asks you whether you want to print a free, all-expenses-paid
Summary or Full reconciliation report. Click Summary or Full and click OK if
you want to print the report. Otherwise, just click OK.
Can’t decide whether to print the reconciliation report? Unless you’re a busi-
ness bookkeeper or an accountant who is reconciling a bank account for some-
one else — your employer or a client, for example — you don’t need to print
the reconciliation report. All printing does is prove that you reconciled the
account. (Basically, this proof is the reason why you should print the report if
you’re a bookkeeper or an accountant. The person for whom you’re reconcil-
ing the account will know that you did your job and will have a piece of paper
to come back to later with any questions.)
Now each deposit, withdrawal, and check that you just cleared is marked
with a check mark in your register. If you don’t believe me, open the register
and find out.
If the difference doesn’t equal zero
If the difference doesn’t equal zero — as is the case in Figure 13-2 — you have
a problem. If you click Reconcile Now, QuickBooks shows you the Reconcile
Adjustment dialog box, shown in Figure 13-3. This dialog box tells you how
unbalanced your account is and asks whether you want to adjust your malad-
justed account.
Click Return to Reconcile if you want to go back to the Reconcile window and
start the search for the missing or incorrectly entered transaction.
If you want to force the two amounts to agree, click OK. Forcing the two
amounts to agree isn’t a very good idea. To do so, QuickBooks adds a cleared
transaction equal to the difference. (I talk about this transaction a little later
in the chapter.)
237
Chapter 13: The Balancing Act

Postponing a reconciliation (by clicking Leave) and not choosing to adjust
the bank account balance is usually the best approach because you can then
locate and correct problems. (The next section contains some ideas that can
help you determine what the problem is.) Then you can restart the reconcili-
ation and finish your work. (You restart a reconciliation the same way that
you originate one.)
Eleven Things to Do If Your Non-Online
Account Doesn’t Balance
I want to give you some suggestions for reconciling an account when you’re
having problems. If you’re sitting in front of your computer wringing your
hands, try the tips in this section:
 Make sure that you’re working with the right account. Sounds dumb,
doesn’t it? If you have several bank accounts, however, ending up in the
wrong account is darn easy. So go ahead and confirm, for example, that
you’re trying to reconcile your checking account at Mammoth
International Bank by using the Mammoth International Bank checking
account statement.
 Look for transactions that the bank has recorded but you haven’t. Go
through the bank statement and make sure that you’ve recorded every
transaction that your bank has recorded. You can easily overlook cash
machine withdrawals, special fees, or service charges (such as charges
for checks or your safe-deposit box), automatic withdrawals, direct
deposits, and so on.
If the difference is positive — that is, the bank thinks that you have less
money than you think that you should have — you may be missing a
withdrawal transaction. If the difference is negative, you may be missing
a deposit transaction.
Figure 13-3:
The
Reconcile
Adjustment
dialog box.
238
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

 Look for reversed transactions. Here’s a tricky one: If you accidentally
enter a transaction backward — a deposit as a withdrawal or a withdrawal
as a deposit — your account doesn’t balance. And the error can be diffi-
cult to find. The Reconcile window shows all the correct transactions,
but a transaction amount appears in the wrong list. (The amount appears
in the Deposits, Interest, and Other Credits list if it belongs in the Checks,
Payments, and Service Charges list, or vice versa.) The check that you
wrote to Acme Housewreckers for the demolition of your carport appears
in the Deposits, Interest, and Other Credits list, for example.
 Look for a transaction that’s equal to half the difference. One handy way
to find the transaction that you entered backward — if you have only
one — is to look for a transaction that’s equal to half the irreconcilable
difference. If the difference is $200, for example, you may have entered 
a $100 deposit as a withdrawal or a $100 withdrawal as a deposit.
 Look for a transaction that’s equal to the difference. While I’m on the
subject of explaining the difference by looking at individual transactions,
I’ll make an obvious point: If the difference between the bank’s records
and yours equals one of the transactions listed in your register, you may
have incorrectly marked the transaction as cleared or incorrectly left the
transaction unmarked (shown as uncleared). I don’t know. Maybe that
was too obvious. Naaaah.
 Check for transposed numbers. Transposed numbers occur when you
flip-flop two digits in a number. For example, you enter $45.89 as $48.59.
These turkeys always cause headaches for accountants and bookkeepers.
If you look at the numbers, detecting an error is often difficult because
the digits are the same. For example, when you compare a check amount
of $45.89 in your register with a check for $48.59 shown on your bank
statement, both check amounts show the same digits: 4, 5, 8, and 9. They
just show them in different orders.
Transposed numbers are tough to find, but here’s a trick that you can try.
Divide the difference shown in the Reconcile window by 9. If the result is
an even number of dollars or cents, chances are good that you have a
transposed number somewhere.
 Use the Locate Discrepancies button. Would you mind, terribly, taking a
peek back at Figure 13-1? The dialog box shown in that figure includes a
Locate Discrepancies button, which you can click to display another
dialog box that prints reports that may help you reconcile your account.
In particular, the dialog box lets you view a report of changes made to
previously cleared transactions (which would be pretty suspicious book-
keeping activity and would definitely foul up your reconciliation) and also
a report that lists transactions marked as cleared during previous recon-
ciliations (which might be interesting because maybe you erroneously
marked a transaction as cleared before it really was cleared).
239
Chapter 13: The Balancing Act

 Have someone else look over your work. This idea may seem pretty
obvious, but I’m amazed at how often a second pair of eyes can find some-
thing that I’ve been overlooking. Ask one of your coworkers or employees
(preferably that one person who always seems to have way too much
free time) to look over everything for you.
 Be on the lookout for multiple errors. If you find an error by using this
laundry list and you still have a difference, start checking at the top of
the list again. You may, for example, discover after you find a transposed
number that you entered another transaction backward or incorrectly
cleared or uncleared a transaction.
 Try again next month (and maybe the month after that). If the difference
isn’t huge in relation to the size of your bank account, you may want to
wait until next month and attempt to reconcile your account again.
Before my carefree attitude puts you in a panic, consider the following
example: In January, you reconcile your account, and the difference is
$24.02. Then you reconcile the account in February, and the difference is
$24.02. You reconcile the account in March and, surprise, surprise, the
difference is still $24.02. What’s going on here? Well, your starting account
balance was probably off by $24.02. (The more months you try to recon-
cile your account and find that you’re always mysteriously $24.02 off, the
more likely that this type of error is to blame.) After the second or third
month, I think that having QuickBooks enter an adjusting transaction of
$24.02 is pretty reasonable so that your account balances. (In my opinion,
this circumstance is the only one that merits your adjusting an account
to match the bank’s figure.)
If you’ve successfully reconciled your account with QuickBooks before,
your work may not be at fault. The mistake may be (drum roll, please)
the bank’s! And in this case, you should do something else. . . .
 Get in your car, drive to the bank, and beg for help. As an alternative to
the preceding idea — which supposes that the bank’s statement is correct
and that your records are incorrect — I propose this idea: Ask the bank
to help you reconcile the account. Hint that you think the mistake is prob-
ably the bank’s, but in a very nice, cordial way. Smile a lot. And one other
thing — be sure to ask about whatever product the bank is currently
advertising in the lobby (which encourages the staff to think that you’re
interested in that 180-month certificate of deposit, causing them to be
extra nice to you).
In general, the bank’s record keeping is usually pretty darn good. I’ve
never had a problem either with my business or personal accounts. (I’ve
also been lucky enough to deal with big, well-run banks.) Nevertheless,
your bank quite possibly has made a mistake, so ask for help. Be sure 
to ask for an explanation of any transactions that you discover only by
seeing them on your bank statement. By the way, you’ll probably pay 
for this help.
240
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

Balancing an Online Bank Account
In a nutshell, don’t actually reconcile your account with the bank when you
balance a bank account that you’ve set up for online banking. Every time you
send online payments or transfers to the bank, QuickBooks retrieves a list of
recent bank account transactions — essentially an online bank statement.
You can and should compare these statements to your own records.
To make this comparison, take the following steps:
1. Send your online banking transactions in the usual way.
I won’t repeat the discussion that I provide in Chapter 11; heck, you know
how to turn a few pages. But all you do is choose Banking➪Online Banking
Center, click the Send button, and provide your PIN when prompted.
2. Display the online statement.
After you exchange information with the bank, double-click the bank state-
ment item in the Items Received from Financial Institution list. This list
appears at the very bottom of the Online Banking Center window, so even
though I’m not providing a figure, you’ll have no trouble locating the darn
thing. After you double-click the statement, QuickBooks displays the
Match Transactions window. The Match Transactions window is just 
a special version of the register window. The top half of the window
shows the bank account using the traditional register window format.
The bottom half of the window provides a list of downloaded transac-
tions that you “match” to transactions already recorded in your register.
3. Add missing transactions.
To add transactions that your bank shows (such as banking service fees
or interest income) but are missing in your register, click the transaction
in the online transactions list and then click the Add to Register button.
QuickBooks partially records the transaction into the register. You need
to complete the recording — such as by adding the account and by click-
ing Record.
4. Match transactions.
QuickBooks attempts to match transactions in the online statement
(shown in the bottom half of the Match Transactions window) with those
you recorded for the bank account (shown in the top half of the Match
Transactions window). If QuickBooks matches a transaction, it marks the
online transaction as “match.” You can manually match a transaction,
however, by clicking the transaction in both the online transactions list
and the bank register and then clicking the Match button. (To unmatch a
transaction, duh, you click the Unmatch button.)
241
Chapter 13: The Balancing Act

5. Click Done.
At the point that you’ve added any missing transactions and matched all
the transactions, you’re done. You’ve essentially reconciled the account.
Click the Done button. QuickBooks returns you to the Online Banking
Center window.

information on forms, account registers, or lists by merely clicking the mouse.
In this chapter, I tell you how to prepare reports, how to print them, and how
to customize reports for your special needs.
What Kinds of Reports 
Are There, Anyway?
If you run a small business, you don’t need all the reports that QuickBooks
offers, but many of these reports are extremely useful. Reports can show you
how healthy or unhealthy your business is, where your profits are, and where
you’re wasting time and squandering resources.
To make sense of what may otherwise become mass confusion, QuickBooks
organizes all its reports in categories. You can see what all the categories are
by pulling down the Reports menu. The names of the reports read a bit like
public television documentary names, don’t they? “Tonight, Joob Taylor
explores the mazelike federal budget in Budget Reports.” You select a report
category to see a list of report names.

In Table 14-1, I describe reports by category, along with a short description of
the major reports in each category. To get a thorough description of a partic-
ular report, go to the Help feature. To find out what a standard profit and loss
report does, for example, choose Help➪Help Index. Type profit in the text box
and then double-click the profit and loss reports entry, or click the Display
button. The screen displays a list of topics relating to profit and loss reports.
To read the details about a topic, click that topic in the list.

Finder. Just choose Reports➪Report Finder, select a report type from the
drop-down list box at the top of the Report Finder window (see Figure 14-1),
and then select a report from the list to preview that report. You can specify
the date range you want to include in the report by using the other boxes 
in the Report Finder window. Then click Display to display the report.

Creating and Printing a Report
After you decide what report you need, all you have to do is select it from the
appropriate menu. To create a standard profit and loss report, for example,
choose Reports➪Company & Financial➪Profit & Loss Standard.
Depending on how much data QuickBooks has to process, you may see a
Building Report box before the report appears on-screen in all its glory.
Figure 14-2 shows a standard profit and loss report, also called an income
statement. (If you see a Customize Report dialog box instead of a report, you
can tell QuickBooks to change this option. To do so, choose Edit➪Preferences.
Then click the Reports & Graphs icon from the list on the left. And click the
My Preferences tab if you have one and it isn’t already selected. Then remove
the check in the Display Modify Report Window Automatically box.)
You can’t see the entire on-screen version of a report unless your report is
very small (or your screen is monstrously large). Use the Page Up and Page
Down keys on your keyboard to scroll up and down, and use the Tab and
Shift+Tab keys to move left and right. Or, if you’re a mouse lover, you can use
the scroll bar.

To print a report, click the Print button at the top of the report. QuickBooks
displays the Print Reports dialog box, shown in Figure 14-3. To accept the
given specifications, which are almost always fine, click the Print button.
You’ll never guess what happens next: QuickBooks prints the report!
The first time you print a report, QuickBooks displays a Printing Features
dialog box that explains a few things about the mechanics of choosing and
printing reports.
Before I forget, I want to tell you that you can click the File option button in
the Print To panel to tell QuickBooks to save the report as a file instead of
printing it. You can then choose the file format: ASCII, Comma Delimited File,
and Tab Delimited File. You can use either delimited file format if you want to
later open the file with a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel. After
you click Print, use the Create Disk File dialog box to specify the filename and
storage location.
The Orientation setting tells QuickBooks how the report is supposed to appear
on the paper. The Page Range settings specify the pages you want to print. The
Fit Report to Page(s) Wide check box enables you to shrink the report so that
it fits on the number of pages you specify. The purpose of the Print in Color
(Color Printers Only) check box is probably pretty self-evident.
QuickBooks includes two page-break options for creating easier-to-read
reports:
 Click the first check box to keep items that belong in the same group on
the same page.
 Click the second check box to give each major group its own page.
You also can preview the report by clicking the Preview button.

Visiting the report dog-and-pony show
You can do some neat things with the reports you create. Here’s a quick 
rundown of some of the most valuable tricks:
 QuickZooming mysterious figures: If you don’t understand where a
number in a report comes from, point to it with the mouse. As you point
to numbers, QuickBooks changes the mouse pointer to a magnifying glass
marked with a Z. Double-click the mouse to have QuickBooks display a
list of all the transactions that make up that number.
This feature, called QuickZoom, is extremely handy for understanding
the figures that appear on reports. All you have to do is double-click any
mysterious-looking figure in a report. QuickBooks immediately tells you
exactly how it arrived at that figure.
 Sharing report data with Microsoft Excel: If you’re using QuickBooks Pro
or Premier, you can export report data to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet
by clicking the Export button in the report window. QuickBooks displays
the Export Report to Excel dialog box. You can use this dialog box to
specify whether you want to create a new spreadsheet for the report data
or whether you want to add the report data to an existing spreadsheet.
Editing and rearranging reports
You may have noticed that when QuickBooks displays the report document
window, it also displays a row of buttons: Modify Report, Print, Memorize,
Export, Refresh, and so on (as you can see in Figure 14-2 if you look carefully).
Below this toolbar are some drop-down list boxes that have to do with dates
and a drop-down list called Columns. (Not all these list boxes are available in
every report document window. I don’t know why, really. Maybe just to keep
you guessing.)
You don’t need to worry about these buttons. Read through the discussion
that follows only if you’re feeling comfortable, relaxed, and truly mellow, okay?
Modifying
When you click the Modify Report button, QuickBooks displays the Modify
Report dialog box, shown in Figure 14-4. From this dialog box, you can change
the information displayed on a report and the way that information is arranged
(using the Display tab), the data used to generate the report (using the Filters
tab), the header and footer information (using, predictably, the Header/Footer
tab), and the typeface and size of print used for a report (using the Fonts &
Numbers tab).
248
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

Memorizing
If you do play around with the remaining buttons, you can save any custom
report specifications that you create. Just click the Memorize button.
QuickBooks displays the Memorize Report dialog box (shown in Figure 14-5),
which asks you to supply a name for the customized report and assign the
memorized report to a report group. After you name and assign the cus-
tomized report, QuickBooks lists it whenever you choose Reports➪Memorized
Reports and then the report group. Whenever you want to use your special
report, all you need to do is select it from the list and click the Report button.
QuickBooks memorizes the print orientation with the report, so if the print
orientation isn’t the way you want it for the report, you should first change it
by choosing File➪Printer Setup. Select the orientation you want to memorize,
click OK, and then memorize the report.
The other buttons and boxes
If you want to see how the Hide Header, Collapse, and Dates stuff work, just
noodle around. You can’t hurt anything.

Chapter 14: Reporting On the State of Affairs

If you change the report dates, click the Refresh button to update the report.
(To set refresh options for reports, choose Edit➪Preferences. Then click the
Reports & Graphs icon from the list on the left and click the My Preferences
tab if necessary. Click one of the Reports and Graphs options and click OK.)
Reports Made to Order
If you intend to print a large number of reports and, more importantly, if 
you intend to print a large number of reports and show them to customers,
investors, and other significant people, you want your reports to look good
and be easy to understand. I believe that beauty is in the eye of the beholder,
so I’m not going to get into the aesthetics of report layouts. What I am going
to do is explain how you can make QuickBooks reports look exactly the way
you want them to look.
Choose Edit➪Preferences. Then click the Reports & Graphs icon from the list
on the left and the Company Preferences tab to see the Preferences dialog box,
shown in Figure 14-6, for reports and graphs.
You need to be logged in in single-user mode as the administrator to change
company preferences.

Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

Here are your options:
 Accrual: Accrual is one of those cruel accounting terms that’s hard to
understand at first. If you choose Accrual in the Summary Reports Basis
panel, you tell QuickBooks to date all your transactions, purchases,
expenses, and so on, from the moment they’re recorded, not from the
time you receive or pay cash for them.
Accountants follow the accrual method because it gives a more accurate
picture of profits. Also, the Internal Revenue Service says that big corpo-
rations must use accrual accounting for their tax returns.
 Cash: If you choose Cash, all the financial transactions in your reports
are dated from the time payments are made.
 Age from Due Date: If you click Age from Due Date in the Aging Reports
panel, QuickBooks counts your expenses and invoices from the day that
they fall due. Otherwise, QuickBooks counts them from the day they’re
recorded.
 Format: Click the Format button if you want to improve the look of 
your reports. In the Report Format Preferences dialog box, shown in
Figure 14-7, you can use the Header/Footer tab to choose preferences for
displaying the company name, the report title, the subtitle, and so on.
You can use the Fonts & Numbers tab to choose preferences for display-
ing numbers, decimal fractions, and negative numbers. You also can fool
around with different fonts and point sizes for labels, column headings,
titles, and other things in your reports.
Figure 14-7:
The Report
Format
Preferences

251
Chapter 14: Reporting On the State of Affairs

Click the Revert button in the Report Format Preferences dialog box to undo
your customization changes.
Processing Multiple Reports
Want to print several reports at once? No problem. Choose Reports➪Process
Multiple Reports. When QuickBooks displays the Process Multiple Reports
dialog box, shown in Figure 14-8, select the reports that you want to print.
The reports all appear in windows on-screen when you do this. The technical
editor for this book is concerned, probably rightly so, that some QuickBooks
users may be confused by all the open windows. I think that if you remember
you can use the Window menu to move from one window to the next, things
should work out okay for you.
Last but Not Least: The QuickReport
The last kind of report is the QuickReport, which is one of the best kinds of
reports, so I saved it for last. You can generate a QuickReport from a list, from
invoices and bills with names of people or items on them, and from account
registers. QuickReports are especially useful when you’re studying a list and
you see something that momentarily baffles you. Simply make sure that the
item you’re curious about is highlighted, click the Reports button, and choose
the QuickReports command for the item from the drop-down menu.

You can also right-click an item and choose the shortcut menu’s QuickReport
option to create a QuickReport of the item.
Figure 14-9 shows a QuickReport produced from a Checking register. I clicked
the QuickReport button to display this Register QuickReport window with the
transaction information for a vendor, the fictitious but profitable Little Bertha’s
Workshop.
The QuickReport option is also on the Reports menu. You can display a
QuickReport from a form — even though no QuickReport button appears —
by choosing the menu option. For example, if you’re writing a check to a
vendor, you can enter the company’s name on the check and choose Reports➪
QuickReport to see a report of transactions involving the company.

In This Chapter
 Backing up QuickBooks data
 Deciding when and how often to back up your data
 Restoring your QuickBooks data (if you lose it)
 Using Accountant’s Review
 Condensing your QuickBooks data
O
kay, you don’t need to worry about chasing dust bunnies in QuickBooks,
but you do have a few housekeeping tasks to take care of. In this chapter,
I describe these chores and how to do them correctly with minimal hassle.
Backing Up Is (Not That) Hard to Do
Sure, I can give you some tricky, technical examples of fancy backup strategies,
but they have no point here. You want to know the basics, right?
The guiding rule is that you back up anytime you work on something that 
you wouldn’t want to redo. Some people think that a week’s worth of work 
is negligible, and others think that a month’s worth of work is negligible.
So here’s what I do to back up my files. I back up every week after I enter my
data for the week. Then I stick the disk (you may use any removable disk, such
as a Zip disk or writable CD) in my briefcase so that if something terrible hap-
pens (like a tornado hits my office building), I don’t lose both my computer
and the backup disk with the data. (I carry my briefcase around with me — a
sort of middle-age security blanket — so that it won’t get destroyed in some
after-hours disaster.)
Sounds like a pretty good system, huh? Actually, I admit that my strategy has
its problems:

 Because I’m backing up weekly, I may have to reenter as much as a week’s
worth of data if the computer crashes toward the end of the week. In my
case, I wouldn’t lose all that much work. However, if you’re someone with
heavy transaction volumes — if you prepare hundreds of invoices or write
hundreds of checks each week, for example — you probably want to back
up more frequently, perhaps every day.
 A second problem with my strategy is only remotely possible but still
worth mentioning: If something bad does happen to the QuickBooks files
stored on my computer’s hard disk and the files stored on the backup
floppy disk, CD-R, CD-RW, or Zip disk, I’ll be up the proverbial creek 
without a paddle. (I should also note that a removable disk [especially 
a floppy] is far more likely to fail than a hard drive.) If this worst-case
scenario actually occurs, I’ll need to start over from scratch from the
beginning of the year.
To prevent this scenario from happening, some people who are religiously
careful circulate three sets of backup disks to reduce the chance of this
mishap. They also regularly move one copy off-site, such as to a safe-deposit
box. In this scenario, whenever you back up your data, you use the oldest set
of backup disks.
Say you back up your data every week, and your hard disk not only crashes
but also bursts into a ball of flames rising high into the night. To restore your
files, you use the most recent set of backups — one week old, max. If some-
thing is wrong with those, you use the next recent set — two weeks old. If
something is wrong with those, you use the last set — three weeks old. This
way, you have three chances to get a set that works — a nice bit of security for
the cost of a few extra disks. I should also add that, generally, one company
account’s backup file doesn’t fit on a single floppy disk, so you probably want
to have a high-density removable disk for your backups such as a writable CD
or a Zip disk — especially if you’re maintaining multiple backup copies of the
QuickBooks file.
You know what else? All backup files are condensed to save disk space. 
If you’re so inclined (I’m not), open Windows Explorer or My Computer and
look in the Program Files\Intuit\QuickBooks folder for your company’s
file. (The backup file is, of course, on the disk you specify in the backup proce-
dure, which I describe in the following section.) If you set Windows Explorer
to show file size — click the Views button and choose Details from the drop-
down menu to do so — you’ll notice that your backup file (the one with the
.QBB extension displayed, if you don’t have your file extensions hidden) is a
fraction of the size of its regular company file counterpart (the one with the
.QBW extension). QuickBooks shrinks the backup file to keep the disk from
getting too crowded.
If you can’t fit your backup QuickBooks file on a single floppy and you want
to use floppy disks, you can back up across multiple floppies.
256
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

Backing up the quick-and-dirty way
You’re busy. You don’t have time to fool around. You just want to do a passable
job of backing up, and you’ve decided how often you plan to do it. Sound like
your situation? Then follow these steps:
1. Insert a blank disk in your drive.
You can back up to any removable disk, including floppy disks, Zip disks,
and writable CDs.
Heck, I should admit that you can back up to any fixed disk, such as your
hard disk or a network disk, but the advantage of a removable disk is that
you can store it in some other location. As a compromise, you can also
use a network disk. You typically don’t want to use your hard disk
(although this is better than nothing) because one of the disasters that
may befall your QuickBooks data is a hard disk failure.
2. If you store data for more than one company, make sure that the 
company whose data you want to back up is the active company.
Yes, I know that all your companies are active — I’m hoping they’re not
dead in the water. My point is that you want to back up the right com-
pany. To find out whether the right company is active, just look at the
QuickBooks application window’s title bar, which names the active com-
pany. (If you don’t remember setting up multiple files, don’t worry. You
probably have only one file — the usual case.)
3. Choose File➪Back Up to begin the backup operation.
QuickBooks displays the Back Up Company File tab of the QuickBooks
Backup dialog box, as shown in Figure 15-1.
If you use QuickBooks in multi-user mode, you need to switch to single-
user mode before you back up your file. For more information on how to
make this switch, see Chapter 3.
4. To identify the backup drive, click the Disk option button and then
click the Browse button.
QuickBooks displays the Back Up Company To dialog box (see 
Figure 15-2).
5. Click the Save In drop-down list and select the letter of the drive that
you stuffed the disk into.
QuickBooks 2003 includes new backup options — Verify Data Integrity
and Format Each Floppy During Backup — which appear as check boxes
on the Back Up Company File tab of the QuickBooks Backup dialog box
(refer to Figure 15-1). You can check these boxes to have QuickBooks
double-check the data it copies to the backup disk and, if necessary, to
have QuickBooks first format the backup floppy disk. As the Back Up
Company To tab indicates, however, these options do slow down the
backup process.

6. Click Save.
QuickBooks returns to the Back Up Company File tab of the QuickBooks
Backup dialog box (refer to Figure 15-1).
7. Click OK.
QuickBooks backs up your company file. When it finishes, it displays a
message telling you that the backup worked.
Getting back the QuickBooks 
data you’ve backed up
What happens if you lose all your QuickBooks data? First of all, I encourage
you to feel smug. Get a cup of coffee. Lean back in your chair. Gloat for a
couple of minutes. You, my friend, have no problem. You have followed
instructions.
Okay, you may have one or two problems, but you probably can blame PC
gremlins for those. If the disaster that caused you to lose your data also
trashed other parts of your computer, you may need to reinstall QuickBooks.
You also may need to reinstall all your other software.
After you’ve gloated sufficiently (and pieced your computer back together
again if it was the cause of the disaster), carefully do the following to rein-
state your QuickBooks data:
1. Get your backup disk.
Find the backup disk you created and carefully insert it into one of the
disk drives.
2. Start QuickBooks and choose File➪Restore.
QuickBooks closes whatever company file you have open. QuickBooks
displays the Restore Company Backup dialog box.
3. Use the Filename and Location boxes in the Get Company Backup
From area to identify the backup file you want to use.
If you know the company filename and location, you can enter this infor-
mation in the boxes provided. If you don’t know this information, click
the Change button. QuickBooks displays the Restore From dialog box.
Use the Look In box to identify the drive that contains the file you want
to back up. Then select the file you want to restore and click Open.
259
Chapter 15: QuickBooks Dirty Work

4. Use the Filename and Location boxes in the Restore Company Backup
To area to identify the file you want to replace.
If you know the company filename and location, you can enter this infor-
mation in the boxes provided. If you don’t know this information, click
the Change button. QuickBooks displays the Restore To dialog box. Use
the Save In drop-down list box to make sure that you place the restored
file in the correct folder on the correct drive.
5. Click the Restore button.
If the file you’re trying to restore already exists, you see a message box
telling you so. Either click Yes to overwrite or replace the file with the
one stored on the floppy disk, or click No to keep the original copy.
QuickBooks may ask you for your password to verify that you have adminis-
trative permission to restore the file. Then, if everything goes okay, you see a
message box that says so. Breathe a deep sigh of relief and give thanks.
Oops. I almost forgot:
 When you restore a file, you replace the current version of the file with
the backup version stored on the floppy disk. Don’t restore a file for fun.
Restore a file only if the current version is trashed and you want to start
over by using the version stored on the backup disk.
 You need to reenter everything you entered since you made the backup
copy. I know. You’re bummed out. Hopefully, it hasn’t been all that long
since you backed up.
260
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 
Backing up files online
You can quickly and easily back up your data
online. By doing so, you no longer need to
remember to make backups and take them off-
site. To find out more about online backup, click
the Tell Me More button on the Back Up Company
File tab of the QuickBooks Backup dialog box.
(Refer to Figure 15-1.) To back up online, click
the Online option button shown in Figure 15-1
and then click OK.
The Online Backup service is a pretty good idea
if you have a fast Internet connection, but the
service isn’t cheap. You pay at least $80 a year
and as much as $240 a year depending on the
level of service. But you can set up the service
so that QuickBooks automatically backs up your
data on a regular basis.
Just for the record, I don’t think you need to
worry about the security. You can read more
about the security measures at the QuickBooks
Web site, but your data is as secure online as it
is in your office.

Accountant’s Review
Hey. While I’m on the subject of the housecleaning stuff you can do with your
QuickBooks files, let me mention the Accountant’s Review feature.
Accountant’s Review allows your accountant to make adjustments in a special
copy of your QuickBooks data file while you continue to enter your daily trans-
actions in the master file. When your accountant returns the updated file, you
can then merge the changes back into the master file.
To use Accountant’s Review, choose File➪Accountant’s Review➪Create
Accountant’s Copy. Select a location for the accountant’s copy and click Save.
To import the accountant’s changes, choose File➪Accountant’s Review➪
Import Accountant’s Changes. If you need help with this feature, you should
talk to your accountant.
Shrinking Files That Are Too 
Big for Their Own Good
You can enter a large number of transactions in a QuickBooks company file.
Even so, you may want to shrink or condense the .QBW or working set of your
data file. Working with files of a manageable size means that QuickBooks runs
faster because your computer has more memory and disk space available.
QuickBooks files can become dangerously large, just for the record. The
QuickBooks support Web site warns that QuickBooks files shouldn’t be larger
than 40MB in size, for example. But, you know what? I’ve noticed strange, inex-
plicable problems with files that get larger than 20MB in size — like you have
trouble condensing and archiving the files — and I suspect the real explanation
is that the files are just getting too large to be easily handled.
Condensing defined
If your company file has become too big for its own good, you can knock it
down to size by condensing it. As part of condensing the file, QuickBooks lets
you decide which parts should be condensed and which parts should be read-
ily accessible. You make this decision based on a cutoff date of your choice.
In other words, if you have two or three years’ worth of data records and the
stuff from three years ago doesn’t pertain to you for the most part, you can
condense it. You also can delete unused accounts, information on inactive
customers and vendors, old invoices, and Audit Trail information.
261
Chapter 15: QuickBooks Dirty Work

Condensing means that you get to work with a smaller file. And that, in turn,
means QuickBooks runs faster. (The memory thing comes into play again.)
And a smaller file should make backing up easier because you can probably
keep your file small enough to fit on a single floppy disk.
Condensed information isn’t lost — it’s merely summarized. QuickBooks
retains numeric totals and dates of the transactions but deletes other details,
such as the names. In other words, if you wrote a check to Tuggey’s Hardware
on July 31, 1997, for office supplies, QuickBooks includes the amount of the
check in its office supplies expense total for July 1997, but loses the hardware
store name, the check amount and date, and other transaction specific 
information.
Don’t despair about losing crucial data. In all its wisdom, QuickBooks can tell
if a data item that you want to condense still bears on transactions that you
enter in the future, and QuickBooks won’t condense these transactions. If you
choose to condense all information from before January 1, 1999, and you just
so happen to have skipped a monthly rent payment in December 1998, for
example, QuickBooks still retains all accounts payable information pertaining
to your missed payment. And quit trying to pull a fast one, you rascal.
Here’s some other stuff QuickBooks won’t condense, even if you ask it to
nicely:
 Unpaid invoices, bills, and credit memos; undeposited customer pay-
ments that have been applied to invoices; unreconciled transactions in
credit card and checking accounts; and anything whatsoever that has
been checked To Be Printed are not condensed.
 For the purposes of tax liability, QuickBooks doesn’t condense any of your
tax data. QuickBooks retains all information about taxable items and tax
vendors. If you’re audited, you won’t be able to point to your computer
and say, “There you are. Just uncondense that, Mr. Taxman.” (Technically,
what QuickBooks does is create general ledger journal entries that sum-
marize each month’s activity, so you can still create financial statements
and explain tax return data.)
Condensing made simple
To condense a QuickBooks file, follow these steps:
1. Start from a blank QuickBooks screen.
Close registers, reports, or anything else on-screen.
If you use QuickBooks in multi-user mode, you need to switch to single-
user mode before you back up your file. For more information on making
this switch, see Chapter 3.
262
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

2. Choose File➪Archive & Condense Data.
QuickBooks displays a portrait of Barry Nelson, the first actor to portray
James Bond. No, not really — I just wanted to see if you were awake.
Actually, QuickBooks displays the first dialog box of the Archive and
Condense Data Wizard, as shown in Figure 15-3.
3. Specify a cutoff date.
In the Remove Closed Transactions On or Before line, enter a cutoff date.
QuickBooks keeps all transactions with dates that fall after this cutoff
date. But all transactions with dates that fall on or before this cutoff date
are condensed (with the exceptions I note earlier in this chapter). 
Figure 15-4 shows you how the first of these babies looks.

4. (Optional) Select other items in the Select Additional Criteria for
Removing Transactions list.
Click Next to move to the next dialog boxes of the Archive & Condense
Data Wizard. These subsequent dialog boxes enable you to tell
QuickBooks which items to remove or summarize. 
5. Click Next a few times.
Because QuickBooks is an exceptionally courteous program, it may 
display a few messages to make sure it’s doing what you want it to.
6. Click Begin Condense, finally, to begin scrunching the file.
By the way, before condensing the data file, QuickBooks asks you to
make a backup file.
Condensing your file may take a while, depending on how large it is. 
So expect a little whirring and humming from the computer. After
QuickBooks condenses the file, you see a message box confirming the
process.
How condensing is summarized on registers
QuickBooks summarizes data on registers into the generic GENJRNL entry. 
So if you condense all data from 2002, your Accounts Payable register for
May 2002 shows a GENJRNL entry totaling all accounts payable transactions
from that month. You don’t see the individual transactions that have been
condensed.
Condensed data affects some reports. Summary reports about your total
equity aren’t affected, but any report concerning details — classes, items,
and so on — isn’t as complete.
Using an Audit Trail
For some curious reason, in the post-Enron world of accounting, people are
much more interested in the QuickBooks Audit Trail feature. In fact, some
readers of past editions of this book have tracked me down like wounded 
animals so they can ask about audit trails in QuickBooks. Because of this
renewed interest, let me share the four things you need to know about using
the QuickBooks Audit Trail feature:
264
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

 An audit trail is simply a list of changes. The QuickBooks Audit Trail —
which is a simple report that lists the changes to the QuickBooks data
file — lets you see who changed what.
 To turn on QuickBook’s Audit Trail feature, choose Edit➪Preferences,
click the Accounting icon, click the Company Preferences tab, and then
check the Use Audit Trail box.
 After you turn on the Audit Trail feature, you can print the Audit Trail
report by choosing Reports➪Accountant & Taxes➪Audit Trail.
 If the Audit Trail feature is turned on, QuickBooks slows down.
Using a Closing Password
QuickBooks doesn’t require you or even let you “close” months and years 
the way that old manual accounting systems did. (When you “closed” an old
accounting period, you actually zeroed out the revenue and expense accounts
and transferred the net amount to the owner’s equity accounts.)
QuickBooks does let you use a closing date and password. The closing date
sort of prevents someone from entering transactions earlier than the specified
date. If you set a closing password, for example, someone needs to supply that
password before entering a transaction or changing a transaction dated before
the closing date. If you don’t set a closing password, someone trying to enter
a transaction or change a transaction dated before the closing date is warned.
To set a closing date, choose Edit➪Preferences, click the Accounting icon, click
the Company Preferences tab, and then enter the closing date (probably the
end of the most recently completed year) into the Date Through Which Books
Are Closed box. To use a closing password, click the Set Password button and
use the dialog box that QuickBooks displays to create the closing password.

 Powerful tips for business budgets
 Setting up a budget
 Reviewing QuickBooks’ new Planning & Budgeting tools
I
don’t think that a budget amounts to financial handcuffs, and neither
should you. A budget is just a plan that outlines the way you plan to gener-
ate sales, the way you should spend your money, and your ideas about how
you can best organize your firm’s financial affairs.
Is This a Game You Want to Play?
If you’ve created a good, workable chart of accounts, you’re halfway to a
good, solid budget. (In fact, for 99 out of 100 businesses, the only step left is
to specify how much you earn in each income account and how much you
spend in each expense account.)
Does every business need a budget? No, of course not. Maybe you’ve got a
simple financial plan that you can monitor some other way. Maybe in your
business, you make money so effortlessly that you don’t need to plan your
income and outgo. Maybe Elvis Presley really is still alive and living some-
where in the Midwest.
For everyone else, though, a budget improves your chances of getting your
business wherever you want it to go financially. It gives you a way to “plan
your work and work your plan.” In fact, I’ll stop calling it a budget. The word
has such negative connotations. I know — I’ll call it The Secret Plan.

All Joking Aside: Some 
Basic Budgeting Tips
Before I walk you through the mechanics of outlining your Secret Plan, I want
to give you a few tips. After that, I want to tell you a secret. A very special
secret.
Following are five ways to increase the chances that your Secret Plan works:
 Plan your income and expenses as a team, if that’s possible. For this
sort of planning, two heads are invariably better than one. What’s more,
although I don’t really want to get into marriage counseling or partnership
counseling here, a business’s budget — oops, I mean Secret Plan — needs
to reflect the priorities and feelings of everyone who has to live within the
plan: partners, partners’ spouses, key employees, and so on. So don’t use
a Secret Plan as a way to minimize what your partner spends on market-
ing or on long-distance telephone charges talking to pseudocustomers
and relatives in the old country. You need to resolve such issues before
you finalize your Secret Plan.
 Include some cushion in your plan. In other words, don’t budget to
spend every last dollar. If you plan from the start to spend every dollar
you make, you’ll undoubtedly have to fight the mother of all financial
battles: paying for unexpected expenses when you don’t have any money.
(You know the sort of things I mean: the repair bill when the delivery
truck breaks down, a new piece of essential equipment, or that cocktail
dress or tuxedo you absolutely must have for a special party.)
 Regularly compare your actual income and outgo to your planned
income and outgo. This comparison is probably the most important
part of budgeting, and it’s what QuickBooks can help you with the most.
As long as you use QuickBooks to record what you receive and spend
and to describe your budget, you can print reports that show what you
planned and what actually occurred.
If you find that you’ve budgeted $1,000 a month for shipping costs but
you discover that you consistently spend twice that amount, you may
need to shift some money from your monthly cocktail dress and tuxedo
allowance. Unless you like coming in over budget on shipping charges.
 Make adjustments as necessary. When you encounter problems with
your Secret Plan — and you will — you’ll know that part of your plan
isn’t working. You can then make adjustments (by spending a little less
on calling the old country, for example).
268
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

 A word to the wise: Don’t gear up your business overhead or your per-
sonal living and lifestyle when you have a great year (or even a few
great years) in the business. When you have a good year or even a few
good years, keep your overhead and expenses modest. Stash the extra
cash. If you can, build up some financial wealth that’s independent and
apart from your business assets. (One great way to do this, for example,
is by contributing to an IRA or by setting up a SIMPLE-IRA or a SEP/IRA
for you and any other employees.)
A Budgeting Secret You 
Won’t Learn in College
I also have a secret tip for you. (I’m going to write very quietly now so that no
one else hears. . . .)
Here’s the secret tip: Go to the library, ask for the Robert Morris & Associates
Survey, the Risk Management Association, or RMA, Reference, the Dun &
Bradstreet Annual Financial Statement Survey, and any similar references of
business financial statistics. Once you get these books, find a nice quiet
corner of the library and look up the ways that other businesses like yours
(that is, businesses that are the same size, sell the same stuff or services, and
have the same gross and net profits) spend money.
These references are really cool. For example, Robert Morris & Associates sur-
veys bank lending officers, creating a summary of the information that these
bankers receive from their customers, and publishes the results. You can look
up what percentage of sales the average tavern spends on beer and peanuts.
Plan to spend an hour or so at the library. Getting used to the way that the
Robert Morris & Associates report, for example, displays information takes 
a while. The taverns page doesn’t actually have a line for beer and peanuts,
for example. Instead, you see some vague accounting term, like “cost of
goods sold.”
Make a few notes so that you can use the information you glean to better plan
your own business financial affairs. If you spend about the same amount on
beer and peanuts every year as the average tavern, you’re in good shape —
well, unless you own a shoe store.
The point is that you can and should use this information to get a better
handle on what businesses like yours earn and spend.
269
Chapter 16: Building the Perfect Budget

A final, tangential point. Have you ever heard business people talk about
benchmarking? The idea is that to compete in a market, you need to do at
least as well as your competitors or similar firms in other markets. And one
way to assess how you’re doing as compared to competitors is to compare
financial ratios, or benchmarks. For example, if you compare what you spend
as a percentage of revenue on advertising to what similar firms spend, you
can often glean real insights into what you should do to better your business.
You’ll learn, for example, where you’re spending too much and where you’re
spending too little. You’ll also sometimes see competitive advantages you
possess of which you were not earlier aware.
Setting Up a Secret Plan
Okay, enough background stuff. The time has come to set up your budget —
er, your Secret Plan — in QuickBooks. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Company➪Planning & Budgeting➪Set Up Budgets.
If you haven’t yet set up a budget, QuickBooks displays the Create New
Budget window, shown in Figure 16-1. If you have already set up a budget,
another window appears, and you need to click the Create New Budget
button to get to the Create New Budget window.
2. Select the year that you want to budget.
Use the box to specify the fiscal year. You use the arrows at the end of
the box to adjust the year number incrementally.
3. Choose the type of budget you want to create.
See those two option buttons on the Create New Budget window? They
let you tell QuickBooks whether you want to create a budget of income
Figure 16-1:
The Create
New Budget
window.
270
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

and expense amounts (done with a pro forma profit and loss statement)
or a budget of year-end asset, liability, and owner’s equity account bal-
ances (done with a pro forma balance sheet). Typically, you want to
budget income and expense amounts. After you indicate for what year
you want to budget and whether you want to budget income statement
amounts or balance sheet amounts, click Next.
4. Provide any additional budgeting criteria and instructions.
QuickBooks asks next if you want to budget using additional criteria,
such as customer:job information or class information. You answer this
question by marking the option button that corresponds to budgeting
criteria you want and then click Next. (If you’re just starting out, don’t
worry about specifying additional criteria. Keep things simple to start.)
5. Indicate whether you want to start from scratch. Then click Next.
QuickBooks asks next whether you want it to create a first-cut at your
budget using last year’s numbers or whether you just want to start from
scratch. To answer this question, mark the option button that corre-
sponds to your choice. For example, to budget from scratch, mark the
Create Budget from Scratch button.
After you click Next, QuickBooks displays the Set Up Budgets window
(see Figure 16-2).
Figure 16-2:
The Set Up
Budgets
window.
271
Chapter 16: Building the Perfect Budget

6. Do your budget.
You use this window to identify the budgeted amounts you plan for 
each account. If you said you want to budget by scratch, by the way,
QuickBooks shows a window with a bunch of empty columns. If you said
that you want to base the coming year’s budget on last year’s real num-
bers, you see numbers in the columns.
QuickBooks shows only a few months of budgeted data at a time. Click
the Show Next 6 Months button to move to the next part of the budget
year. To move back to the first part of the year, click the Show Prev 
6 Months button. (Only one of these “Show” buttons appears at a time.)
The Budget box, at the top of the Set Up Budgets window, lets you 
name the budget you’re creating. Why? You can work with several differ-
ent versions of your budget. (To create a new budget, click the Create
New Budget button, which steps you through the six-step process
described here.)
To copy the amount shown in the selected box across the row, click the
Copy Across button. (This lets you copy, for example, some amount
you’ve budgeted for January into February, March, April, May, and so on.)
If you want to be a little fancier, you can also select some budgeted
amount and click the Adjust Row Amounts button. QuickBooks displays
the Adjust Row Amounts dialog box (see Figure 16-3), which lets you
adjust the selected amount by some specified percentage increase or
decrease. For example, if you want to increase the budgeted amount by,
say, 0.25% a month, you use the Adjust Row Amounts button.
7. Save your budgeting work.
After you enter your Secret Plan, click Save to save your work and leave
the Set Up Budgets window open. Or click OK to save your work but
close the Set Up Budgets window.
Figure 16-3:
The 
Adjust Row
Amounts
dialog box.
272
Part III: Stuff You Do Every So Often 

I should mention, too, that you can just click Cancel if you don’t want to save
your work (in case you’ve just been noodling around).
Adjusting a Secret Plan
To later make additional changes to a budget, choose Company➪Planning &
Budgets➪Set Up Budgets. QuickBooks displays the Set Up Budgets window.
Choose the budget you want to work with from the Budget drop-down list
box, and then make your changes. All the same tools that you had for initially
setting up your forecast (described in the preceding section) are available for
editing your budget.
Working with Forecasts
QuickBooks allows you to create forecasts of future revenue and cash flows.
A forecast isn’t a budget — it’s a forecast. To create a forecast, choose
Company➪Planning & Budgeting➪Set Up Forecast. Creating a forecast works
the same way (roughly) that creating a budget works. 
Projecting Cash Flows
If you tell it to, QuickBooks attempts to project your business’s cash flows.
To tell QuickBooks to do this, choose Company➪Planning & Budgeting➪
Cash Flow Projector. Then when QuickBooks starts up its clever little wizard,
you follow the on-screen instructions. (This cash flow projector essentially
automates the same process you’d step through on a scratch pad or the back
of an envelope.)
Using the Formal Business Planner Tool
The Planning & Budgets submenu provides a command you can use to 
start the QuickBooks Business Planner, a wizard-like thing that walks you
through the steps to writing a business plan. The planner isn’t a bad tool. In
fact, it’s pretty powerful. I will say that you need to be pretty darn proficient
in accounting and finance to get through it. I can’t, for example, in a few para-
graphs supply the information you need. Heck, I can only suggest you take
the core requirements in an undergraduate business major. You’d need about
that much information to do the plan and understand the results. Sorry.
273
Chapter 16: Building the Perfect Budget

Using the Expert Analysis Tool
The Expert Analysis Tool, also available from the Planning & Budgets submenu,
lets you assess your firm’s financial condition and performance against those
of similar businesses. The Expert Analysis Tool, just so you know, steps you
through a wizard that asks you about your business, grabs information from
the QuickBooks data file, and then does some simple analysis.
I’d suggest that you experiment with this tool after you’ve used QuickBooks
for a year or two. It may provide you with some interesting insights into your
business. Nothing earthshaking, mind you. But it’s worth the ten minutes or
so the wizard takes. (I will say that you’ll find it far more valuable to make the
field trip to the library that I suggested earlier in the chapter.)
Using the Decision Tools
One final command available on the Planning & Budgets submenu deserves
mention: Decision Tools. The Decision Tools command displays a sub-submenu
of commands you can use to learn more about accounting and finance and
how to apply accounting and financial concepts to your business. For exam-
ple, the Decision Tools sub-submenu includes a command that steps you
through a wizard that explains what depreciation is and how you calculate
depreciation.
If you’re a regular Joe or Jane trying to be smart about managing your finan-
cial affairs, the Decision Tools sub-submenu offers some real nuggets of gold.
I recommend it.

(Almost) Ten Knowledge Nuggets
about Web-ifying Your Business
In This Chapter
 Getting started with your own Web site
 Discovering why the Web is so great for small businesses
 Using the tactics of other Web businesses
 Understanding the risks
I
’m not sure where to start this. Most of the time when a software company
like Intuit (or any other big developer) adds some new whistles or bells to
a program, I’m not all that excited. Most of the gizmos and gadgets that get
added to mature products like QuickBooks aren’t — in my opinion — really
worth all that much. Sorry, but that’s just the way it is.
That said, I have to emphasize that this Web publishing stuff is different. Way
different. It’s more than just a whistle or bell. It’s a very powerful new capabil-
ity. The weird part is that, while the technology and mechanics are deceptively
simple (as you find out in a few paragraphs), the strategy is a tough nut to
crack. Maybe you should do this. Maybe you shouldn’t. You have to think
carefully.
So this not-so-simple capability puts me in a difficult place with regard to the
Web Site Builder that’s part of recent versions of QuickBooks. I want to talk
about both things a bit — both mechanics and strategy — but I need to empha-
size the strategy stuff. After much hand-wringing, I’m going to treat this subject
by providing you with the best knowledge nuggets I can about how to use the
Web in your business. Along the way, I’ll briefly go over the new Web Site
Builder tool.
My discussion of that simple wizard is pretty fast-paced because that’s not the
main thing you need to know about. Quite frankly, you need to think about and
understand a bunch of big, important, strategic decisions before you take the
20 or so minutes required to run the Web Site Builder Wizard.

The Mechanics Are Simple
Here’s the first thing I want to tell you. In terms of mechanics, Web publishing
is very simple. All you’re really doing when you publish Web pages is creating
HTML documents that combine text and pictures and then storing them on a
central Web server. All the tricky stuff, I should point out, gets taken care of
by the Web server and the poor souls who have to maintain that sucker.
By the way, you probably know that HTML stands for HyperText Markup
Language; you don’t really need to know how HTML works — just that it’s a
special programming language that enables Web browsers to view Web pages.
After your HTML documents are stored on the Web server, people with Web
browsers and Internet connections can easily view them at any time of the
day or night. That’s it. Really.
If you want a good solid introduction to building your own site, check out
Creating Web Pages For Dummies, 6th Edition, by Bud Smith and Arthur
Bebak. This comprehensive guide is published by the good people at Wiley
Publishing, Inc.
Creating your new site
You can use a variety of Web publishing and Web editing programs to create
these HTML documents, or Web pages. Web browsers, such as Internet
Explorer and Netscape Navigator, provide simple Web editing capabilities.
More powerful Web publishing programs, such as FrontPage and Dreamweaver,
enable you to create and administer very sophisticated collections of HTML
documents, including Web documents that are interactive. (By interactive, I
just mean that you can collect information from the Web site visitor by using
a form and that you can also dynamically change the information shown on
the Web page.)
But if you have QuickBooks — and of course you do because that’s why you’re
reading this book — you can easily create a Web site in just a few minutes by
choosing Company➪Company Web Site. When you choose this command,
QuickBooks, through its Web Site Builder feature, starts a wizard that guides
you through the steps to building a Web site.
To use the wizard, you answer simple questions about your business, such as
what its name is, and about what information you want to appear on your Web
site. To provide this information, you either type the information into text
boxes or copy the information from another program.
278
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

This may be obvious, but I recommend that you type your information into a
word-processor document, spell-check and grammar-check the text, and then
copy and paste the information from the document into the appropriate text
boxes. In this way, you’re liable to reduce any textual errors. Especially the
embarrassing ones, like (oops!) misspelling your company’s name.
To move text between a word processor and the Web Site Builder Wizard,
select the text in the word processor, choose Edit➪Copy, switch to the Web
Site Builder, click the text box where you want the selected text to appear,
and then choose Edit➪Paste.
Previewing your new site
After you finish stepping through the wizard, the Web Site Builder constructs
the Web site. Presto. You can preview it from inside the Web Site Builder
window. A few days after you finish it, you and anyone else in the world can
view the Web site over the Internet. Yes, that’s right. As part of your running
the Web Site Building Wizard, QuickBooks sets up an Internet domain for your
Web site and publishes your pages.
You can view and edit your Web site at any time from within QuickBooks by
choosing Company➪Company Web Site.
And that, my friend, is really it. I know you’re going to find it hard to believe
that setting up your Web site can be so simple. But, aside from the work of
figuring out what you’re going to say (which I talk about later in this chapter),
using the Web Site Builder is laughably easy.
Changing your new site
The QuickBooks Web publishing capabilities fall somewhere between the
simple Web editing capabilities of a browser and the sophisticated Web pub-
lishing capabilities of a full-blown Web authoring program, such as FrontPage.
That’s good, and that’s bad. The good part is that the Web Site Builder in
QuickBooks is very easy to use, as noted. The bad part — maybe the bad
part — is that you can’t build a really sophisticated Web site with QuickBooks.
In essence, what you do with the Web Site Builder is create an online catalog
or brochure.
Oh, wait. One other thing. If you want to change something on one of your Web
pages, you also use the Web Site Builder. Choose Company➪My Company
Web Site➪Edit Web Site. Doing this lets you rerun the wizard so that you can
modify your Web site.
279
Chapter 17: (Almost) Ten Knowledge Nuggets about Web-ifying Your Business

Web Publishing Is Relatively Cheap
Let me say something else here at the very beginning: Web publishing doesn’t
have to be expensive. In fact, you can keep your Web publishing expenses very
low. If you have QuickBooks 2004, for example, you don’t need to purchase any
special software to do Web publishing. The cost to actually operate a Web site
is affordable and worthwhile for many small businesses — about $20 a month
at the time I’m writing this if you use the Web Site Builder that comes with
QuickBooks 2004. (Check with Intuit at www.intuit.com for up-to-date pricing
information.)
Not surprisingly, if you’re unconcerned about costs or if you have a big budget,
you can spend a lot of money on your Web publishing. And, predictably, if you
spend a lot of money, you can create a fantastic Web site.
If you want to create a fantastically sophisticated Web site and have the finan-
cial resources to do so — understand that you may be spending thousands of
dollars — what you need to do is locate a good Web designer. This is a person
who understands not only the aesthetic issues of designing Web pages but also
the technical issues. Your best bet may be to look at the Web sites designed
for other local businesses and see who has put together really good sites.
(Usually, Web designers identify themselves someplace on the sites they
create for people, so you may be able to track down a good designer this
way.) Another idea: Ask your accountant or attorney for a recommendation.
You may think it’s odd that accountants would know more than you do about
Web design. Think about it, though. Accountants have other business clients
besides you. And hopefully, they know somebody or somebody who knows
somebody.
Why the Web Is Better Than Paper
In the rush to get online, some people kinda forget what it is about Web pub-
lishing that’s better than paper publishing. You may already know this stuff,
but humor me by letting me recount that Web publishing provides three advan-
tages as compared with traditional paper publishing:
 Lower publishing costs
 Faster publishing schedules
 Easier editing
You know what else? There’s another subtle benefit. Be careful, though,
because this one has been overemphasized by the recent herd of dot-com
entrepreneurs: Customers can access your business 24/7. All day, all night. 
Of course, they have to know that your site exists in order to access it, but
that’s another issue altogether — one that I address later in this chapter.
280
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

If you’re seriously interested in taking your business online, read the rest 
of this chapter. If you’re still interested, check out E-Commerce For Dummies
by Don Jones, Mark D. Scott, and Richard Villars (published by Wiley
Publishing, Inc.).
Big benefit number one
The first advantage, and maybe the biggest, is that you don’t have printing or
mailing costs when you publish on the Web. This cost saving sounds small
and almost insignificant, I guess, but it’s really extremely useful.
Consider, for example, an expensive color brochure that you supply to your
customers. You pay a pretty penny — perhaps several dollars a copy — to
print in low volumes of a few hundred or a thousand copies. And while print-
ing at larger volumes, say 5,000 to 20,000 copies, drives down your per-unit
cost, those sorts of print volumes can easily push your total cost to tens of
thousands of dollars.
Web publishing works very differently. After you finish creating your HTML
documents, you don’t really have any additional costs. Oh sure, you pay some-
thing to store Web pages on a Web server someplace, and that adds up to a
few dollars a month. But you don’t have any printing costs or mailing costs.
In essence, the cost to print, mail, and view your information is borne by the
people who are browsing your Web site. Their computers, Internet connec-
tions, and printers do the work of retrieving and then displaying or printing
your Web pages.
Big benefit number two
Okay. Let me talk for a minute about the second big advantage of Web pub-
lishing. After you finish with your HTML documents, or Web pages, you can
publish them. That’s it. You don’t take time to ship stuff to a printer. You don’t
take time to wait for your printer to complete your job. You don’t take time to
have your printer return the job to you.
This is all obvious, right? Printing takes time — at least a few days and, in some
cases, several weeks. In comparison, with Web publishing, it takes a few sec-
onds or maybe a few minutes to move your HTML documents, or Web pages,
to the Web server.
After you move your Web documents to the server, you’re done. So (and 
this is a pretty cool thing) Web publishing allows you to distribute your 
publications instantaneously — which is great, unless you’re in the printing
business!
281
Chapter 17: (Almost) Ten Knowledge Nuggets about Web-ifying Your Business

Big benefit number three
Let me quickly mention the third big benefit of Web publishing: Making
changes is simple.
This makes sense, right? To correct some typographical error on a Web page,
you simply edit the HTML document — you’ve stored a copy on your com-
puter, of course — and then you move this correct copy to the Web server,
thereby replacing the old erroneous copy.
The ease of fixing small mistakes this way (or adding to your catalog a new
item that you just got in) is actually pretty cool if you think about the embar-
rassment of simple typos. And it maybe becomes lifesaving if you think about
the really serious ramifications of bad telephone numbers or addresses, prices,
or part numbers. Clearly, one of the Web’s big benefits is that you get to make
corrections immediately.
Mom, Don’t Read This
I feel a little nervous about broaching this next subject. But because I’m talking
about something very serious here — how you can use the Web as a business
tool — I want to talk with you a bit about the only type of Web publisher that,
to date, has really made serious money from the Web: the adult entertainment
sites.
Hear me out, please. This topic is very relevant to small businesses. Note that
many large businesses — including companies like Microsoft — have not, to
date, found a way to make money on the Internet from Web publishing (except,
of course, by selling hardware and software to people who want to use the
Internet).
In comparison, the adult entertainment sites (the porn sites) reportedly have
made lots of money. And while I’m not suggesting that you or I get into the
adult entertainment industry, I do think that we can learn to think more intelli-
gently and creatively about our own Web publishing efforts. We can look at
the adult entertainment sites and, in particular, at why they’ve been success-
ful. So here I go. (We’re both adults, right? We can do this.) I won’t get embar-
rassed, if you won’t.
Lessons from those “other” Web sites
Here are the lessons to be learned from the success of the adult entertainment
Web publishers:
282
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

 You need to heavily promote and actively advertise your Web site: You
need to do this in order to build traffic, and you need to maintain traffic
by providing reasons for people to keep coming back.
The first thing to note about the adult Web sites is this: Typically, they
heavily promote and advertise their products — usually photographs
and videos — by posting product samples in, er, appropriate newsgroups
and on free Web sites. These adult Web site operators also typically create
lots and lots of new content so that their customers and prospective
customers have a reason to continually revisit the Web sites.
This free content, active promotion, and fresh content result in heavy
Web site traffic — the first lesson those of us outside of the adult enter-
tainment industry should learn from the porn site operators.
If your Web site is to have a big impact on your business, you need to
build and maintain heavy traffic. There’s nothing magical about being on
the Web. People won’t visit your Web site unless they have a reason, such
as free content. And they won’t revisit your Web site unless you continu-
ally add fresh content.
 You may want to consider making money through incremental sales:
$3 to subscribe, $12 for a special book, $25 for a video, and so forth.
The second thing I want to note about these, er, Web publishers is that,
according to articles in business publications, such as The Wall Street
Journal, the adult entertainment Web sites typically rely on incremental
sales. (Mom? If you’re reading this, please note that I’m basing my infor-
mation not on personal experience but rather on written reports in 
the press.)
Here’s how this incremental sales stuff works. If you visit one of these Web
sites, you may be asked or may be required to prove your age by allowing
the site to charge your credit card for some nominal amount like $3. And
then you’ll get an offer to buy a CD of pictures for $12 so you don’t have
to spend time downloading. And then you’ll get the chance to buy a spe-
cial video for $25.
You see the pattern: $3 here, $12 there, $25 over there. With perhaps
tens of thousands of Web site visitors, if even a handful of these visitors
spends a few dollars, the Web site makes money. By some reports — and
these numbers are a bit out-of-date at this point — some of the adult sites
produce $4,000 to $6,000 a day from small incremental sales.
 You may need to use your Web site to reengineer some part of your
business: For example, you may be able to save your customers money,
time, or hassle.
Okay, the final thing I want to note about the adult entertainment Web sites is
this: In essence, the adult entertainment Web publishers have reengineered
the process by which people acquire so-called adult entertainment and 
adult products. Rather than expecting a customer to stand in line at a local
283
Chapter 17: (Almost) Ten Knowledge Nuggets about Web-ifying Your Business

convenience store or visit some garish retail outlet on the other side of the
railroad tracks, someone can anonymously visit a Web site and place an order.
This reengineering presumably gives the Web-based providers of adult enter-
tainment a big competitive advantage over their non-Web-based competitors.
Applying the lessons to your business
The three points in the previous section seem pretty abstract, I guess. So let
me give you some concrete examples about how the points might be applied
in a specific small business situation. Suppose that you own and operate a
small accounting or bookkeeping firm. Nothing fancy. Just a meat-and-pota-
toes business. You might think that the whole Internet thing is just another
fad that you can ignore.
But you know what? I think that you could try to use the Web to reengineer
your service. Call me crazy, but what if you attempted to copy the tactics
employed by the successful adult entertainment Web publishers?
For example, maybe you can build and maintain heavy traffic by maintaining
a Web page that collects news links to business or financial stories of interest
to your clients or that posts the best prices available on frequently used busi-
ness products. Or given the way that tax reporting requirements work, maybe
you could include a weekly to-do list that reminds people when they need to
make tax deposits and file payroll returns.
Maybe you could also easily and economically generate fresh, good content
by letting people write in and ask questions that you then answer online. In
other words, you could create a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) area that
enables clients and potential clients to ask things like: “What do I need to do
to start a business in my town?” “What are my chances of getting audited?”
or “Does the new tax law provide any small business tax breaks?” You’re
probably answering these questions anyway, right? Why not type up the
questions and answers and post them to your Web site?
Finally, maybe you could get incremental sales by selling business forms or
specialty, hard-to-get business how-to books. Or maybe you could include a
local business profile of one of your customers each week. Doing that doesn’t
directly produce sales . . . but it builds goodwill and loyalty. (What business
owners wouldn’t like to see an article on the Web about their business and
what it sells?)
To sum things up — and, of course, I don’t know enough about your busi-
ness to appear very smart here — maybe you could use the Web to essentially
reengineer some part of the small accounting or bookkeeping firm business.
And you could do so in a way that the large financial services companies 
284
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

neither can do nor will do. And maybe you’d charge for this service, thereby
boosting profits. Or maybe you’ll use this service to boost sales, thereby boost-
ing profits. And maybe, just maybe, you would do both.
The Web’s Information-Sharing Risk
Let me make a quick point here. Despite all the advantages of Web-based pub-
lishing, and despite the fact you may be able to use the Web or the Internet to
reengineer your business in some powerful way, the Web presents a notewor-
thy risk: Whatever you put on the Web is available immediately to everybody,
including your competitors. This means that you don’t really have any secrets
(or at least you don’t have them for long). Lower prices (or higher prices), new
services, new ways of doing business, fresh new content — all these began to
get old and stale and outdated very quickly with the Internet. And, I would
say, the better and bigger your good idea, the more quickly it loses its value.
The Web Site Builder Wizard that comes with QuickBooks Pro alludes to this,
by the way. The wizard warns you more than once that you need to be careful
about what you publish on the Web. I want to echo that warning here.
About Those Content Costs, Dude
Earlier in my discussion about using the Web Site Builder, I noted that the
actual mechanical process of creating Web pages takes only a few minutes.
That’s true. But one of the things a lot of people miss is that creating good,
rich, interesting Web page content is very time-consuming. Good content, my
friend, costs money and time.
The hard part of becoming a Web publisher isn’t running the Web Site Builder
Wizard. That’s easy. The hard part is coming up with a bunch of content to
stick on your Web site. Think for a moment about how you felt in high school
when Mrs. Magilabush asked for that six-page term paper. Ha. That was noth-
ing. A few hundred words of text. A Web site requires, probably, some multi-
ple of that . . . and a bunch of art as well.
One related point bears mentioning again here, too: In the previous para-
graphs, I discussed my notion that one of the secrets to making your Web site
successful is continually refreshing its content. If you think about that a bit,
you’ll quickly realize that a Web site is an ongoing responsibility. If you’re going
to do anything striking, you effectively become like a newsletter or magazine
publisher who, each week or month, is trying to publish a batch of new, inter-
esting, and fresh content.
285
Chapter 17: (Almost) Ten Knowledge Nuggets about Web-ifying Your Business

Most of us realize that undertaking such a venture would require more time
than we have available and would perhaps not deliver the benefits needed to
make it worthwhile.
A Scary Thought I Shouldn’t Share
Here’s a scary thought: Maybe Web publishing — especially the simple Web
publishing that you do with something like QuickBooks 2004 — doesn’t really
make sense for your small business.
Think about it. If you don’t have time to produce good content, if you’re busy
running your business, a Web site may turn out to be more work than it’s
worth — especially in the case where you have a targeted market.
Maybe, just maybe, if you do anything, you should treat your Web site as just
a big “yellow pages” ad. If you’re thinking this way, take a look at my Web site
at www.stephenlnelson.com. What I’ve done is really simple. Some may even
say crude. But it’s easy to update, cheap to maintain, and (when needed) gives
me a convenient way to make digital information available to my clients.
I’ll share a secret tip with you about the yellow pages approach to Web publish-
ing: If you can get prospective customers to your Web site, even a crude little
site like mine, you’ll find that your simple Web site is a much better advertis-
ing tool than a yellow pages listing. My little Web site costs me, for example,
about $500 a year. For that price, I get a new client each week. (Cool, right?) In
comparison, for $500 of yellow pages advertising (basically a boldface big print
listing), I get a client a year. Work out the “client acquisition” costs, and the
traditional yellow pages approach gets clients at a cost of $500 a piece whereas
a Web-based approach lets me get clients at the rate of roughly $10 a piece.
By the way, the information at my Web site took me just a few hours to collect
and polish. Your own efforts shouldn’t take much more time than that if you
go with the “quick-and-dirty” approach. I should also mention that I used
Microsoft FrontPage rather than QuickBooks to create my little Web site. I
wanted to use one of FrontPage’s Web design themes because I liked them
better than QuickBooks’ design themes.
Remember that the Web is a mass-market medium that lets you reach mil-
lions of users around the world. In some businesses, that breadth and reach
is really cool. In targeted, niche-based businesses, promoting your business
on the Web may not make sense.

Chapter 17: (Almost) Ten Knowledge Nuggets about Web-ifying Your Business
A scary prediction I shouldn’t share
A few years ago, I was at a Web publishing and
electronic commerce seminar. A big, unnamed
software company headquartered in Redmond,
Washington, sponsored the event. I won’t name
names. But pretty much what every speaker
kept saying was “Well, girls and boys, the Web
is really going to change things. With half of
your customers on the Internet, people want to
shop this way. . . .”
People in the audience were nodding their heads,
glad to be included in this thought-provoking
seminar. Everybody was pumped up. And it
seemed as if all the people in the audience had
decided that this Web-based business stuff was
the cat’s meow.
So at one particular high point in the day’s fes-
tivities, this one guy stands up — okay it was 
me — and says, “Don’t people worry that this
will erode prices?”
I got the “Hey dude, what do you mean?” stare,
so I explained myself: If you can easily compare
prices on the Web simply by clicking a couple
hyperlinks, price shopping becomes incredibly
easy and incredibly exact. It’s way easier and
way more precise than telephone shopping, for
example. I went on to say that because the Web
is free, even if you provide wonderful additional
content on your Web site to really build traffic,
the Web’s anonymous nature doesn’t help build
customer loyalty. That is, people can happily
visit your site, grab your content for free, and
then go buy the item they need from somebody
selling the item for less money.
In the end, I wondered aloud whether the Web
would simply create new, priced-based, virtual
retail businesses like Costco or Wal-Mart. Sure.
You could, of course, provide free advice and
wonderful content to get people to visit your
site, but a Web site visitor is always only a click
away from some discounter’s Web site.
After I finished my little speech, one of the prin-
cipal sponsors of the conference stood up, beat
around the bush for a bit, and then admitted that
price erosion is a risk. He also noted that he
wondered whether it was something busi-
nesses could work around, such as by not pro-
viding prices over the Net.
I didn’t want to say anymore or try to rebut his
position. I was a guest, after all. But inside I was
thinking, “You know, this Web stuff really isn’t a
good idea for everyone. It’s a special tool for
special situations.”

f you run a business and you use QuickBooks, you need to know the infor-
mation in this chapter. You can get this information by sitting down with
your certified public accountant over a cup of coffee at $100 an hour. Or you
can read this chapter.
Sign All Your Own Checks
I have nothing against your bookkeeper. In a small business, however, 
people — especially full-charge bookkeepers — can bamboozle you too darn
easily. By signing all the checks yourself, you keep your fingers on the pulse
of your cash outflow.

Yeah, I know this practice can be a hassle. I know that you can’t easily spend
three months in Hawaii. I know that you have to wade through paperwork
every time you sign a stack of checks.
By the way, if you’re in a partnership, I think that you should have at least a
couple of the partners cosign checks.
Don’t Sign a Check the Wrong Way
If you sign many checks, you may be tempted to use a John Hancock–like sig-
nature. Although scrawling your name illegibly makes great sense when you’re
autographing baseballs, don’t do it when you’re signing checks. A clear signa-
ture, especially one with a sense of personal style, is distinctive. A wavy line
with a cross and a couple of dots is really easy to forge.
Which leads me to my next tip. . . .
Review Canceled Checks Before 
Your Bookkeeper Does
Be sure that you review your canceled checks before anybody else sees the
monthly bank statement.
This chapter isn’t about browbeating bookkeepers. But a business owner can
determine whether someone is forging signatures on checks only by being
the first to open the bank statement and by reviewing each of the canceled
check signatures.
If you don’t examine the checks, unscrupulous employees — especially book-
keepers who can update the bank account records — can forge your signature
with impunity. And they won’t get caught if they never overdraw the account.
I won’t continue this rant, but let me mention one last thing: Every time I teach
CPAs about how to better help their clients with QuickBooks, I hear again and
again about business owners who haven’t been careful about keeping an eye
on the bookkeeper — and have suffered from embezzlement and forgery as a
result.
If you don’t follow these procedures, you will probably eat the losses, not 
the bank.
290
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Choose a Bookkeeper Who Is 
Familiar with Computers and 
Knows How to Do Payroll
Don’t worry. You don’t need to request an FBI background check.
In fact, if you use QuickBooks, you don’t need to hire people who are familiar
with small-business accounting systems. Just find people who know how to
keep a checkbook and work with a computer. They shouldn’t have a problem
understanding QuickBooks.
Of course, you don’t want someone who just fell off the turnip truck. But even
if you do hire someone who rode into town on one, you’re not going to have
much trouble getting that person up to speed with QuickBooks.
A bookkeeper who knows double-entry bookkeeping is super-helpful. But, to
be fair, such knowledge probably isn’t essential. I will say this, however: When
you’re hiring, find someone who knows how to do payroll — not just the fed-
eral payroll tax stuff (see Chapter 12) but also the state payroll tax monkey
business.
Choose an Appropriate 
Accounting System
When you use QuickBooks, you use either cash-basis accounting or accrual-
basis accounting. (I describe the difference between these two methods in
Appendix B.)
Cash-basis accounting is fine when a business’s cash inflow mirrors its sales
and its cash outflow mirrors its expenses. This situation isn’t the case, how-
ever, in many businesses. A contractor of single-family homes, for example,
may have cash coming in (by borrowing from banks) but may not make any
money. A pawnshop owner who loans money at 22 percent may make scads
of money, even if cash pours out of the business daily.
As a general rule, when you’re buying and selling inventory, accrual-basis
accounting works better than cash-basis accounting.
This news may not be earthshaking, but making the switch is something that
you should think about doing. You can easily switch to accrual-basis account-
ing simply by telling QuickBooks that you want reports prepared on an accrual
basis and by promptly recording customer invoices and vendor bills.
291
Chapter 18: (Almost) Ten Tips for Business Owners

If QuickBooks Doesn’t Work 
for Your Business
QuickBooks is a great small-business accounting program. In fact, I’d even go
as far as to say that QuickBooks is probably the best small-business account-
ing program available.
However, if QuickBooks doesn’t seem to fit your needs — if, for example, you
need a program that works better for a manufacturer or that includes some
special industry-specific feature — you may want one of the more complicated
(but also more powerful) small-business accounting packages.
One possibility is another popular (and more powerful) full-featured Windows
accounting program: Peachtree Accounting for Windows from Peachtree (www.
peachtree.com). If that program doesn’t work, you may want to talk to your
accountant about industry-specific packages. (For example, if you’re a com-
mercial printer, some vendor may have developed a special accounting pack-
age just for commercial printers.)
I’m amazed that PC accounting software remains so affordable. You can buy a
great accounting package — one that you can use to manage a $5 million or a
$25 million business — for a few hundred bucks. Accounting software is truly
one of the great bargains in life.
Keep Things Simple
Let me share one last comment about managing small-business financial affairs:
Keep things as simple as possible. In fact, keep your business affairs simple
enough that you can easily tell whether you’re making money and whether the
business is healthy.
This advice may sound strange, but as a CPA, I’ve worked for some very bright
people who have built monstrously complex financial structures for their busi-
nesses, including complicated leasing arrangements, labyrinth-like partnership
and corporate structures, and sophisticated profit-sharing and cost-sharing
arrangements with other businesses.
I can only offer anecdotal evidence, of course, but I strongly believe that these
super-sophisticated financial arrangements don’t produce a profit when you
consider all the costs. What’s more, these super-sophisticated arrangements
almost always turn into management and record-keeping headaches.

Ten Tricky Situations

 Obtaining and repaying loans
A
s your business grows and becomes more complex, your accounting
does, too. I can’t describe and discuss all the complexities you’ll
encounter, but I can give you some tips on handling (just about) ten tricky 
situations.
In QuickBooks, you make journal entries by using the General Journal Entry
window, which you get to by choosing Company➪Make Journal Entry. If you
don’t understand double-entry bookkeeping but you’d like to, take a gander
at Appendix B.
To track the depreciation of an asset that you’ve already purchased (and
added to the chart of accounts), you need two new accounts: an asset type
of account called something like Accumulated Depreciation and an expense
account called something like Depreciation Expense.
If you have a large number of assets, keeping track of the accumulated depre-
ciation associated with specific assets is a good idea. You can do this either
outside of QuickBooks (like in an Excel spreadsheet or with your tax return)
or inside QuickBooks (by using individual accounts for each asset’s original
cost and accumulated depreciation).

After you set up these two accounts, you can record the asset depreciation
with a journal entry such as the following one that records $500 of depreciation
expense:
Debit
Credit
Depreciation expense
$500
Accumulated depreciation
$500
The federal tax laws provide a special form of depreciation called Section 179
depreciation. Section 179 depreciation enables you to depreciate the entire
cost of some assets, which is a big break for small businesses. You can’t,
however, use more than a certain amount of Section 179 depreciation in a
year: $24,000 in 2002, for example, and $25,000 thereafter. You also need to
know some other nitty-gritty details, so confer with your tax adviser if you
have questions.
Selling an Asset
When you sell an asset, you need to back out (get rid of) the asset’s account
balance, record the payment of the cash (or whatever) that somebody pays
you for the asset, and record any difference between what you sell the asset
for and its value as a gain or loss.
If you purchase a piece of land for $5,000 but later resell it for $4,000, for
example, you use the following journal entry to record the sale of this asset:
Debit
Credit
Cash
$4,000
Loss
$1,000
Asset
$5,000
You may need to set up another income account for the gain or another
expense account for the loss. Refer to Chapter 1 for information on setting 
up new accounts.
294
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Selling a Depreciable Asset
Selling a depreciable asset works almost identically to selling an asset that you
haven’t been depreciating. When you sell the asset, you need to back out (or
get rid of) the asset’s account balance. You also need to back out the asset’s
accumulated depreciation (which is the only thing that’s different from selling
an asset that you haven’t been depreciating). You need to record the payment
of the cash (or whatever) that somebody pays you for the asset. Finally, you
count as a gain or a loss any difference between what you sell the asset for
and what its net-of-accumulated-depreciation value is.
This process sounds terribly complicated, but an example will help. Suppose
that you purchased a $5,000 piece of machinery and have accumulated $500
of depreciation thus far. Consequently, the asset account shows a $5,000 debit
balance, and the asset’s accumulated depreciation account shows a $500 credit
balance. Suppose also that you sell the machinery for $4,750 in cash.
To record the sale of this depreciable asset, you would use the following 
journal entry:
Debit
Credit
Cash
$4,750
Accumulated 
$500
depreciation
Asset
$5,000
Gain
$250
As noted earlier in the chapter, if you have a bunch of assets, you probably
want to set up individual accounts for each asset’s original cost and its accu-
mulated depreciation. The individual accounts make it much easier to make
the journal entry shown in the preceding paragraph.
Owner’s Equity in a Sole Proprietorship
Actually, tracking owner’s equity in a sole proprietorship is easy. You can use
the single account that QuickBooks sets up for you, called Opening Bal Equity,
to track what you’ve invested in the business. (You may want to rename this
account something like Contributed Capital.)
295
Chapter 19: Tips for Handling (Almost) Ten Tricky Situations

To track the money you withdraw from the business, you can set up and use
a new owner’s equity account called something like Owner’s Draws. Table 19-1
gives an example of owner’s equity accounts in a sole proprietorship.

Owner’s Equity in a Partnership
To track the equity for each partner in a partnership, you need to create three
accounts for each partner: one for the partner’s contributed capital, one for
the partner’s draws, and one for the partner’s share of the distributed income.
Amounts that a partner withdraws, of course, get tracked with the partner’s
draws account.
The partner’s share of the partnership’s profits gets allocated to the partner’s
profit share account. (Your partnership agreement, by the way, should say how
the partnership income is distributed among the partners.) Table 19-2 gives
an example of owner’s equity accounts in a partnership.

Owner’s Equity in a Corporation
Yikes! Accounting for the owner’s equity in a corporation can get mighty tricky
mighty fast. In fact, I don’t mind telling you that college accounting textbooks
often use several chapters to describe all the ins and outs of corporation
owner’s equity accounting.
As long as you keep things simple, however, you can probably use three or
four accounts for your owner’s equity:
 A capital stock par value account for which you get the par value
amount by multiplying the par value per share by the number of shares
issued.
 A paid-in capital in excess of par value account for the amount investors
paid for shares of stock in excess of par value. You get this amount by
multiplying the price paid per share less the par value per share by the
number of shares issued.
 A retained earnings account to track the business profits left invested
in the business.
 A dividends paid account to track the amounts distributed to share-
holders.
Table 19-3 shows an example of owner’s equity accounts in a corporation.

Chapter 19: Tips for Handling (Almost) Ten Tricky Situations

Multiple-State Accounting
For multiple-state accounting, you can either use classes to track sales in
each state or set up a chart of accounts that includes a complete set of
income and expense accounts (and, if necessary, a complete set of asset and
liability accounts) for each state. After you set up this chart of accounts, all
you have to do is use the correct state’s income and expense accounts to
record transactions.
If you do business in both Washington and Oregon, for example, you would
record sales in Oregon as Oregon sales and sales in Washington as Washington
sales. You would treat other income accounts and all your expense accounts
in the same way. If you use class tracking for sales in different states, you
wouldn’t have duplicate accounts for each state.
Getting a Loan
Getting a loan is the hard part. After you get the money, recording it in
QuickBooks is easy. All you do is record a journal entry that increases cash
and that recognizes the new loan liability. For example, if you get a $5,000
loan, you record the following journal entry:
Debit
Credit
Cash
$5,000
Loan payable
$5,000
You’ll already have a cash account set up, but you may need to set up a new
liability account to track the loan.
Repaying a Loan
To record loan payments, you need to split each payment between two
accounts: the interest expense account and the loan payable account.
For example, suppose that you’re making $75-a-month payments on a $5,000
loan. Also, suppose that the lender charges 1 percent interest each month.
The following journal entry records the first month’s loan payment:

ment journal entry). The following journal entry records the second month’s
loan payment:

You can record loan payments by using either the Write Checks window or the
Enter Bills window. Just use the Expenses tab to specify the interest expense
account and the loan liability account.

O
kay. I’m a little nervous about this. In fact, I had this crazy idea that
maybe I should somehow camouflage this chapter. Perhaps name it
something like “Don’t Read This” or “Really Boring Stuff You Probably Don’t
Want to Know Anyway.” My nervousness, I should point out, doesn’t stem
from the material. I dare say that what you can find here in this little chapter
may provide you more value than almost anything else in this book. And
because this chapter talks about how you can probably save at least hun-
dreds — and very probably thousands — of dollars on taxes, well, by defini-
tion, the material is interesting.
No, here’s the problem: What I talk about here is easily misunderstood. And if
you misunderstand something I say here and then get just slightly mixed up
in the way that you implement some strategy or follow some snidbit of
advice, well, all bets are off. I can pretty well guarantee you a real mess.
So here’s what I need you to do if you really want to save money on taxes:
1. Read through the tax-saving ideas that I present in this chapter.
Make sure that you understand (as best you can) the gist of each gambit.

2. Sit down with your tax adviser and ask for help implementing the two
or three ideas that make the most sense in your situation.
By following these two steps, two other important things happen. One, you
do the background research (just by reading this chapter) into which tax-
saving tricks work in your situation. And, two, you get the expert advice typi-
cally necessary to make sure that you don’t mess up and, thereby, find
yourself in a heap of trouble.
And now let the tips begin.
Trick 1: Benefit from the Appropriate
Pension Device
Let me start with the biggie. Pension plans. Here’s the deal. If you’re self-
employed, you can set up a pension fund that pretty much lets you stash as
much money as you want into things like Individual Retirement Accounts,
SEP/IRAs, Simple-IRAs, 401(k)s, and some of their more exotic brothers and
sisters — plans that go by the names of Paired Plan Keoghs and Defined
Benefit Plans.
Although this angle doesn’t sound very exciting, if your business is prof-
itable, these plans give you a way to put money into tax-deductible, tax-
deferred investment choices. In doing so, not only do you build wealth
outside of your business — which is important for reducing risk — but you
also save a heap of taxes.
I should clarify the risk-reduction angle here. In most states, money that you
store in pension plans is not available to creditors. This protection means
that if you go bankrupt, you may be able to save the money in your pension.
And if someone sues you, again, you may be able to save the money in your
pension. If you have questions about this possibility, ask your attorney.
The tax savings is easy to underestimate, so let me explain how this works.
Say you have $10,000 of profit and are considering saving this money. Further,
suppose that your marginal income tax rate — the top combined state and
federal rate you pay on your last income — is 33 percent. In this case, if you
save the $10,000 into a pension plan, you’ll actually get a $3,300 tax savings,
which is pretty impressive. With this method, much of the money you save
actually comes from the tax savings.
302
Part IV: The Part of Tens

You can calculate how big a tax savings you’ll enjoy by multiplying your pen-
sion plan contribution by the marginal income tax rate. Remember, though,
that you can further boost your tax savings and your pension plan contribu-
tions by saving your tax savings. In other words, you can also use the initial
tax savings — $3,300 in this example — to augment the amount of the pen-
sion contribution. By saving your savings, you generate further savings.
Okay, all this business about pension fund contributions probably doesn’t
sound all that exciting. But before you say to yourself, “Man, this guy is
boring,” let me tell you two things you may not know.
 The first thing you should know: My guess is that your marginal tax
rate is higher than you think. If you have a successful business in a state
with income tax, you may easily be paying a 33 percent tax rate on your
last dollars of income. And if you have a really successful business, you
may be paying close to 50 percent. People often miss this fact — and get
confused because average tax rates are lower. But we live in a country
with very progressive tax rates. And small businesses often get hit
harder by this progressivity than they realize. But anyway, that’s the first
thing you need to take away from this discussion of pension plan angles.
 The second thing you should know: You can probably save way more
money in pension plan accounts than you realize. What you’re probably
thinking is, “Oh, yeah, I know you put a couple of grand into an IRA and a
bit more into a 401(k).” But you don’t realize that other, almost-secret
pension plans, are available. And some of these other, almost-secret pen-
sion plans let you stash away oodles and oodles of money. For example,
something called a paired plan lets you save up to $40,000 a year. With
the help of a pension consultant, you can even set up pension plans that
let you save $50,000 or $100,000 a year by using something called a
Defined Benefit Plan.
I’m not going to spend any more time on this pension plan stuff. I have other
tax tips to talk about. But do recognize that if you want to build wealth out-
side of your business, you can do so by using pension plan devices that pro-
vide you with just scads of tax savings.
While the tax breaks associated with pension fund options like those
described in the preceding paragraphs seem like no-brainers, don’t go to the
work of setting up a pension plan for yourself or for employees if you can
save just as much through traditional IRA accounts. For example, an indivi-
dual can save up to $3,000 of earned income, and a married couple can save
up to $6,000 of earned income in an IRA if the taxpayer or taxpayers aren’t
covered by some other qualified pension plan. If these IRA contribution limits
are all you want to save, you don’t need a formal pension plan. And you’re
only wasting your money by paying some plan administrator $2,000 or $3,000
a year to maintain such a plan.

Trick 2: Don’t Take Any More 
Personal Vacations
Okay, I really, really want you to talk to your tax adviser about this gambit. In
fact, I’m not going to tell you about this trick unless you promise me that
you’ll consult a tax adviser first. Okay?
Okay, that caveat given, let me point out something that a tax adviser told me
a while back. He said to me, “Steve, you’re basically an idiot to be taking per-
sonal vacations.”
Now this guy wasn’t telling me I should stop taking my family to Hawaii. He
knows firsthand how gloomy and gray Seattle looks in February. His point,
really, was that I could probably get many of the same benefits from business
travel.
Rather than Hawaii, for example, he suggested a really good conference in
sunny Phoenix. In this way, my plane ticket, the car rental, and the hotel all
become business travel deductions. Of course, I can’t write off my family’s
airplane tickets. But, in truth, many of the family’s typical travel expenses —
the hotel and car rental, to name just two — do become deductible by my fol-
lowing his suggestion.
The only real trick to this gambit is that the travel needs to be real business
travel. You can’t simply call a family vacation a business trip. You need to be
doing real business.
By the way, I haven’t actually taken this “don’t take any family vacations”
advice. I have a little problem unwinding on vacation anyway. And trying to
take a working vacation just doesn’t work for someone with my particular set
of personality disorders. But you may be different. If what you really want
from a vacation is some sun (or snow), a change of scenery, and a chance to
see another part of the country or world, well, you may be able to get all
these things on a tax-deductible business trip.
You promised me earlier that you would check with a tax adviser before
attempting this gambit on your own. You need to meet very specific criteria
to deduct travel expenses as business expenditures.
304
Part IV: The Part of Tens

Trick 3: Don’t Depreciate — Expense
I mention the Section 179 election in a handful of places elsewhere in this
book. But because this is a powerful tax-saving gambit, let me again say 
that, in general, you can immediately expense up to the first $100,000 of
depreciable stuff you buy in a year. (Usually, you have to depreciate depreci-
able stuff, thereby spreading out the deduction over the estimated economic
life of the thing you bought.) In this way, you boost your deductions without
actually having to suffer a cash outflow. Note that if you buy more than
$400,000 of stuff in a year, the election amount gets phased out.
Trick 4: Incorporate
In some circumstances, you can incorporate a business and save substantial
income taxes. This step is tricky, though, because when you incorporate, the
new corporation typically becomes a new taxpayer, which means that it’s
also subject to income taxes (except in the special case where you make the
Sub S election, which I talk about in the very next trick).
The neat thing about corporations — at least for shareholder employees — is
that they let you provide lots of tax-free fringe benefits to all your employees,
including you.
But let me explain exactly how the corporation thing works. First, say you
have a sole proprietorship that makes $100,000 a year. In this situation, you
can’t provide any tax-deductible fringe benefits to yourself, and you must pay
taxes on the entire $100,000 of income. (By the way, a partnership can’t for
the most part provide tax-deductible fringe benefits to partners either.)
Okay. Now say you incorporate the exact same business, pay yourself a
salary of $60,000, and provide a generous fringe benefits package worth
around $20,000. In this case, the money you spend on the fringe benefits isn’t
taxable. And you can provide an incredibly rich fringe benefits package,
including complete health insurance and even a generous medical expenses
reimbursement plan. The medical expenses reimbursement plan, by the way,
may include money for things like kids’ orthodontia, new air conditioning
that your allergist recommends for your house, and the backyard swimming
pool your physician prescribes for your arthritis.
305
Chapter 20: (Almost) Ten Little Ideas for Saving Big on Business Taxes

Now before you run off to your attorney’s office and incorporate, let me share
with you the two complicating factors in this “incorporate and provide your-
self with massive fringe benefits” trick:
 You must provide the same set of fringe benefits to all your employees.
Obviously that’s not a big deal if the only employees are you and your
spouse or maybe you and the other shareholder. But what if your kids
work for the business, too? Or maybe you employ a bunch of other
people? Do they all deserve, for example, a physician-prescribed back-
yard swimming pool? You see the problem.
 You also face what people usually call the double-taxation problem.
Here’s how this works. You can only pay yourself a fair salary. So, in the
case where your business makes $100,000 and, out of this amount, you
pay $60,000 in salary and another $20,000 in fringe benefits, you have
another $20,000 in leftover profits. These profits — these corporate prof-
its — are taxed at the corporate tax rates. Corporate tax rates run 15
percent on the first $50,000 of income and then rather quickly rise to
rates that roughly run 35 percent to 40 percent. Now that doesn’t sound
so bad, I guess, but any money the corporation distributes to sharehold-
ers is taxed again as a dividend. So here’s what happens to that last
$20,000 of profit you can’t pay out as a salary and can’t pay out in fringe
benefits:
• First, it’s subjected to a 15 percent corporate tax, which reduces
the $20,000 to $17,000 because the corporate tax amounts to
$3,000.
• Then, when you pay out the remaining $17,000 as a dividend, you
are subjected to another income tax — this time, the individual
income tax, which will probably run roughly another 30 percent, 
or $5,100.
So you are taxed twice on the same money. And as a result, your $20,000
rather quickly dwindles to around $12,000 because of the roughly $3,000
corporate income tax and the roughly $5,000 personal income tax.
Bummer.
Now before you shake your head, let me share a little secret. And this is
another thing you need to discuss with your tax adviser. The double-taxation
thing maybe isn’t as bad as it seems if you’re saving a good deal of money on
the fringe benefits thing. For example, returning again to the case in which
you’re thinking about incorporating a business that makes $100,000 a year,
the $20,000 of deductible fringe benefits may save you around $6,000 in taxes.
The double-taxation penalty may cost you an extra $3,000 in corporate
income taxes. So in that case, you’re still $3,000 ahead.
I want to say one other thing about the double-taxation thing. Although the
IRS looks very closely at the salaries that corporations pay to shareholder
employees, I think that, in practice, you have a bit of wiggle room. Check with
306
Part IV: The Part of Tens

your tax adviser; but maybe in good years, you can pay yourself a $10,000
bonus, which adds to your salary and reduces your taxable corporate profits.
Or maybe in good years, you invest extra money in the business. Perhaps the
good years, for example, are when you buy the new equipment you regularly
need. These sorts of tricks may further reduce the damage done by double
taxation.
One other way to avoid the double-taxation problem is to elect Sub S status.
If you do so, however, you don’t get to deduct fringe benefits for shareholder
employees.
Trick 5: Consider the Sub S Election
Okay, here’s another tricky technique. And again, this is not something that
you want to do without the help of a tax adviser! Those two warnings in place,
let me say that you can sometimes save quite a bit of money by incorporating a
business and then electing S corporation status. A corporation that elects S
status doesn’t get taxed at the corporate level on its profits. The profits just get
allocated to the shareholders, and they then pay the personal income taxes on
the corporate profits. What you save by using this option isn’t income taxes
but something that’s often equally annoying: self-employment taxes.
Self-employment taxes are what self-employed persons pay in lieu of Social
Security and Medicare taxes. In effect, they are equivalent to Social Security
and Medicare taxes.
To explain how this election works, I need to set up an example. Say that you
run a sole proprietorship and you make $60,000 a year in profits. In this case,
you must pay self-employment taxes (equivalent to Social Security and
Medicare taxes) of 15.3 percent, or roughly $9,000. That’s a bummer, right?
Well, if you incorporate and then tell the IRS that you want to be treated as a
special type of corporation called an S corporation, you can split your
$60,000 into two categories: wages and dividends. The weird part is that only
your wages are subject to the self-employment taxes. You see where I’m
going, right? Say, for example, that you’re now incorporated, and that you
take $30,000 of your $60,000 of profit and treat that money as wages. And
then you take the other $30,000 of profit and treat that money as dividends.
In this case, you pay self-employment taxes of around $4,500. Why? Because
the 15.3 percent self-employment taxes you pay are levied only on the wages
you make — not on the dividends.
The only trick in this deal is that you have to pay yourself a reasonable
salary. If you’re a plumber and plumbers make $50,000 a year where you live,
for example, you can’t pay yourself $30,000.
307
Chapter 20: (Almost) Ten Little Ideas for Saving Big on Business Taxes

Trick 6: Enjoy the Best of Both Worlds
If you read Trick 4, you know that regular corporations, called C corpora-
tions, provide a neat tax-saving opportunity in the form of deductible fringe
benefits. And that’s pretty sweet. But if you read Trick 5, you know that Sub S
corporations provide a different tax-savings opportunity — the self-employ-
ment taxes gambit (plus they let you avoid the double-taxation trap).
If you have to choose between one classification and the other, you need to
sit down and work out the numbers, of course. But consider that this may not
be an “either-or” option. Maybe you really have two businesses. In this case,
you may want to treat the smaller business as a C corporation and the larger,
more-profitable business as an S corporation. In this way, you may actually
get to enjoy the best of both worlds.
Just so you don’t waste any time on this, you can’t be artificial in creating the
second business. The IRS has the ability to come in, look at the reality of your
situation, and recategorize whatever you’ve done so it matches reality. For
example, I have a CPA practice. But I can’t decide to put individual tax
returns and planning into a C corporation and then business tax returns and
planning into an S corporation. That’s clearly me being bogus. But if I also
had, say, a travel agency, I could set up separate corporations for the travel
agency business and for the public accounting practice. And one could be an
S corporation, and one could be a C corporation.
Trick 7: Create Some Legitimate 
Job for Your Kids
Here’s a clever trick I saw the partners of a CPA firm recently do. They put
together a brochure that described all the services their firm offers to indi-
viduals. The brochure, of course, included pictures of the sorts of families
they serve. And the models in the pictures were the partners’ kids, who were,
of course, fairly paid.
The neat thing about this trick is that the first bit of money a kid earns isn’t
taxable because of the standard deduction. So the partners effectively turned
several thousand dollars of taxable “partner” income into nontaxable “part-
ners’ kids” income.
A side note: My understanding is that the partners took the money that each
kid was paid and stashed it away into that kid’s college savings fund.

Part IV: The Part of Tens

Trick 8: Relocate Your Business
Different states and cities have different income tax rates, so you want to be
careful about where you locate your business. Now clearly, you don’t want to
pick a location purely for tax reasons. That truly would be a case of letting
the tail wag the dog. But you ought to look at the tax burden of each of the
locales from which you can operate your business. I save about $4,000 a year,
for example, by operating my business from the suburbs rather than from
downtown Seattle.
If you do consider the tax consequences of relocating your business, be sure 
to consider not just income taxes but also other taxes, such as payroll taxes
like unemployment and workmen’s compensation and even indirect taxes, 
such as minimum wage requirements. Recently, I was happy (Not!) to see that
Washington state, where I live, forces employers to pay the nation’s highest
hourly minimum wage and the nation’s second highest unemployment tax rate.

have some good news and some bad news for you. The good news is that
you can use some powerful formulas to better your chances of business
success and increase your profits. No, I’m not joking. These formulas do exist.
You can and should use them. And in the pages that follow, I explain the for-
mulas and how to use them.
Now for the bad news: To use these formulas, you need to feel comfortable
with a bit of arithmetic. You don’t need to be a serious mathematician or any-
thing. But you do need to feel comfortable with percentages and calculators.
By the way, you can use the standard Windows Calculator accessory, avail-
able from within QuickBooks, to calculate any of the secret formulas.
Even if you’re not particularly fond of (or all that good at) math, I want to
encourage you to skim through this chapter. You can pick up some weird
insights into the world of finance.

The First “Most Expensive Money You
Can Borrow” Formula
Here’s something you may not know: The most expensive money that you can
borrow is from vendors who offer cash or early payment discounts that you
don’t take. For example, perhaps your friendly office supply store offers a 2
percent discount if you pay cash at the time of purchase instead of paying
within the usual 30 days. You don’t pay cash, so you pay the full amount
(which is 2 percent more than the cash amount) 30 days later. In effect, you pay
a 2 percent monthly interest charge. A 2 percent monthly interest charge works
out to a 24 percent annual interest charge. And that’s a great deal of money.
Here’s another example that is only slightly more complicated. Many, many
vendors offer a 2 percent discount if you pay within the first 10 days that an
invoice is due instead of 30 days later. (These payment terms are often
described and printed at the bottom of the invoice as “2/10, Net 30.”)
In this case, you pay 2 percent more by paying 20 days later. (The 20 days
later is the difference between 10 days and 30 days.) Two percent for 20 
days is roughly equivalent to 3 percent for 30 days, or a month. So, a 2 percent
20-day interest charge works out to a 36 percent annual interest charge. And
now you’re talking serious money.
Table 21-1 shows how some common early payment discounts (including
cash discounts) translate into annual interest rates. By the way, I’ve been a
bit more precise in my calculations for this table, so these numbers vary
slightly from (and are larger than) those given in the preceding paragraph.
Table 21-1
Annual Interest Rates for Early Payment Discounts

64.04%
312
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Is it just me, or do those numbers blow you away? The 2 percent for 20 days
early payment discount that you often see works out (if you do the math pre-
cisely) to more than 37 percent annual interest. Man, that hurts. And if you
don’t take a 5 percent for 20 days early payment discount when it’s offered,
you’re effectively borrowing money at an annual rate of 96 percent. You
didn’t read that last number wrong. Yes, a 5 percent for 20 days early pay-
ment discount works out to an annual interest rate of almost 100 percent.
I want to make a couple more observations, too. Turning down a 1 percent dis-
count for paying 30 days early isn’t actually a bad deal in many cases. Look at
Table 21-1. It shows that the 1 percent discount for paying 30 days early is
12.29 percent. Sure, that rate is pretty high. But that interest rate is less than
for many credit cards. And it’s less than for some small-business credit lines.
So if you would have to borrow money in some other way in order to pay 30
days early, making an early payment may not be cost-effective.
The bottom line on all this ranting is that early payment discounts, if not
taken, represent one of the truly expensive ways to borrow money. I’m not
saying that you won’t need to borrow money this way at times. I can guess
that your cash flow gets pretty tight sometimes (a circumstance that is true
in most businesses, as you probably know). I am saying that you should
never skip taking an early payment discount unless borrowing money at out-
rageous interest rates makes sense.
Oh, yes. The secret formula. To figure out the effective annual interest rate
that you pay by not taking an early payment discount, use this formula:
Discount % / (1 – Discount %) × (365 / Number of Days of Early Payment)
So, to calculate the effective annual interest rate that you pay by not taking a
2 percent discount for paying 20 days early, calculate this formula:
.02 / (1 – .02) × (365 / 20)
Work out the mathematics, and you get 0.3724, which is the same thing as a
37.24 percent interest rate. (Note that the discount percents are entered as
their equivalent decimal values.)

Chapter 21: (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas

The Second “Most Expensive Money You
Can Borrow” Formula
You know that “most expensive money you can borrow” stuff that I talk 
about in the preceding section? The very tragic flip side to that story occurs
when you offer your customers an early payment discount and they take the
discount. In effect, you borrow money from your customers at the same out-
rageous interest rates. For example, if customer Joe Schmoe gets a 2 percent
early payment discount for paying 20 days early, you, in effect, pay ol’ Joe
roughly 2 percent interest for a 20-day loan. Using the same formula I give for
the first “most expensive money you can borrow” formula, the rate works out
to 37.24 percent.
In some industries, customers expect early payment discounts. You may have
to offer them, but you should never offer them willingly. You should never
offer them just for fun. Borrowing money this way is just too expensive. A
rate of 37.24 percent? Yikes!
Let me also offer a rather dour observation. In my experience, anytime some-
one offers big early payment discounts — I’ve seen them as big as 5 percent —
they’re either stupid or desperate, and probably both.
The “How Do I Break Even?” Formula
I know that you’re not interested in just breaking even. I know that you want
to make money in your business. But knowing what quantities you need to
sell just to cover your expenses is often super-helpful. If you’re a one-person
accounting firm (or some other service business), for example, how many
hours do you need to work to pay your expenses and perhaps pay yourself a
small salary? Or, if you’re a retailer of, say, toys, how many toys do you need
to sell to pay your overhead, the rent, and sales clerks?
You see my point, right? Knowing how much revenue you need to generate
just to stay in the game is essential. Knowing your break-even point enables
you to establish a benchmark for your performance. (Anytime you don’t
break even, you know that you have a serious problem that you need to
resolve quickly to stay in business.) And considering break-even points is
invaluable when you think about new businesses or new ventures.
314
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

As you ponder any new opportunity and its potential income and expenses,
you need to know how much income you need to generate just to pay those
expenses.
To calculate a break-even point, you need to know just three pieces of infor-
mation: your fixed costs (the expenses you have to pay regardless of the busi-
ness’s revenue, or income), the revenue you generate for each sale, and the
variable costs that you incur in each sale. (These variable costs, which also
are called direct expenses, aren’t the same thing as the fixed costs.)
 Whatever you sell — be it thingamajigs, corporate jets, or hours of con-
sulting services — has a price. That price is your revenue per item input.
 Most of the time, what you sell has a cost, too. If you buy and resell
thingamajigs, those thingamajigs cost you some amount of money. The
total of your thingamajigs’ costs varies depending on how many thinga-
majigs you buy and sell, which is why these costs are referred to as vari-
able costs. A couple of examples of variable costs include hourly (or
contract) labor and shipping. Sometimes, the variable cost per item is
zero, however. (If you’re a consultant, for example, you sell hours of
your time. But you may not pay an hourly cost just because you consult
for an hour.)
 Your fixed costs are all those costs that you pay regardless of whether
you sell your product or service. For example, if you have to pay an
employee a salary regardless of whether you sell anything, that salary is
a fixed cost. Your rent is probably a fixed cost. Things like insurance and
legal and accounting expenses are probably also fixed costs because
they don’t vary with fluctuations in your revenue.
Fixed costs may change a bit from year to year or may bounce around a
bit during a year. So maybe fixed isn’t a very good adjective. People use
the term fixed costs, however, to differentiate these costs from variable
costs, which are those costs that do vary with the number of goods you
sell.
Take the book-writing business as an example. Suppose that as you read this
book, you think, “Man, that guy is having too much fun. Writing about
accounting programs . . . working day in and day out with buggy beta soft-
ware . . . yeah, that would be the life.”
Further suppose that for every book you write, you think that you can make
$5,000, but that you’ll probably end up paying about $1,000 per book for such
things as long-distance telephone charges, overnight courier charges, and extra
hardware and software. And suppose that you need to pay yourself a salary of
$20,000 a year. (In this scenario, your salary is your only fixed cost because you
plan to write at home at a small desk in your bedroom.) Table 21-2 shows how
the situation breaks down.

With these three bits of data, you can easily calculate how many books you

Fixed Costs / (Revenue – Variable Costs)
If you plug in the writing business example data, the formula looks like this:
$20,000 / ($5,000 – $1,000)
Work through the math, and you get five. So you need to write (and get paid
for) five books a year to pay the $1,000 per book variable costs and your
$20,000 salary. Just to prove that I didn’t make up this formula and that it
really works, Table 21-3 shows how things look if you write five books.

Accountants use parentheses to show negative numbers. That’s why the
$5,000 and the $20,000 in Table 21-3 are in parentheses.
But back to the game. To break even in a book-writing business like the one
that I describe here, you need to write and sell five books a year. If you don’t
think that you can write and sell five books in a year, getting into the book-
writing business makes no sense.
316
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Your business is probably more complicated than book writing, but the same
formula and logic for calculating your break-even point apply. You need just
three pieces of information: the revenue you receive from the sale of a single
item, the variable costs of selling (and possibly making) the item, and the
fixed costs that you pay just to be in business.
QuickBooks doesn’t collect or present information in a way that enables you
to easily pull the revenue per item and variable costs per item off some
report. Nor does it provide a fixed-costs total on some report. But if you
understand the logic of the preceding discussion, you can easily massage the
QuickBooks data to get the information you need.
The “You Can Grow Too Fast” Formula
Here’s a weird little paradox: One of the easiest ways for a small business to
fail is by being too successful. I know. It sounds crazy, but it’s true. In fact, I’ll
even go out on a limb and say that business success is by far the most
common reason that I see for business failure.
“Oh, geez,” you say. “This nut is talking in circles.”
Let me explain. Whether you realize it, you need a certain amount of financial
horsepower, or net worth, to do business. (Your net worth is just the differ-
ence between your assets and your liabilities.) You need to have some cash
in the bank to tide you over the rough times that everybody has at least occa-
sionally. You probably need to have some office furniture and computers so
that you can take care of the business end of the business. And if you make
anything at all, you need to have adequate tools and machinery. This part all
makes sense, right?
How net worth relates to growth
Okay, now on to the next reality. If your business grows and continues to
grow, you need to increase your financial horsepower, or net worth. A bigger
business, for example, needs more cash to make it through the tough times
than a smaller business does — along with more office furniture and comput-
ers and more tools and machinery. Oh sure, you may be able to have one
growth spurt because you started off with more financial horsepower (more
net worth) than you needed. But — and this is the key part — you can’t sus-
tain business growth without increasing your net worth. Some of you are now
saying things like, “No way, man. That doesn’t apply to me.” I assure you, my
new friend, that it does.
317
Chapter 21: (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas

As long as your creditors will extend you additional credit as you grow your
business — and they should, as long as the business is profitable and you
don’t have cash-flow problems — you can grow your business as fast as you
can grow your net worth. If you can grow your net worth by 5 percent a year,
your business can grow at an easily sustained rate of only 5 percent a year. If
you can grow your net worth by 50 percent a year, your business can grow at
an easily sustained rate of only (only?) 50 percent a year.
You grow your business’s net worth in only two ways:
 By reinvesting profits in the business.
Note that any profits that you leave in the business instead of drawing
them out — such as through dividends or draws — are reinvested.
 By getting people to invest money in the business.
If you’re not in a position to continually raise money from new 
investors — and most small businesses aren’t — the only practical 
way to grow is by reinvesting profits in the business.
Calculating sustainable growth
You can calculate the growth rate that your business can sustain by using
this formula:
Reinvested Profits / Net Worth
I should say, just for the record, that this formula is a very simple sustainable
growth formula. But even so, it offers some amazingly interesting insights. For
example, perhaps you’re a commercial printer doing $500,000 in revenue a
year with a business net worth of $100,000; your business earns $50,000 a
year, but you leave only $10,000 a year in the business. In other words, your
reinvested profits are $10,000. In this case, your sustainable growth is calcu-
lated as follows:
$10,000 / $100,000
Work out the numbers and you get 0.1, or 10 percent. In other words, you can
grow your business by 10 percent a year (as long as you grow the net worth
by 10 percent a year by reinvesting profits). For example, you can easily go
318
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

from $500,000 to $550,000 to $605,000 and continue growing annually at this
10 percent rate. But your business can’t grow any faster than 10 percent a
year. That is, you’ll get into serious trouble if you try to go from $500,000 to
$600,000 to $720,000 and continue growing at 20 percent a year.
You can convert a decimal value to a percentage by multiplying the value by
100. For example, 0.1 × 100 equals 10, so 0.1 equals 10 percent. You can convert
a percentage to a decimal value by dividing the value by 100. For example, 25
(as in 25 percent) divided by 100 equals 0.25.
The sustainable growth formula inputs are pretty easy to get after you have
QuickBooks up and running. You can get the net worth figure off the balance
sheet. You can calculate the reinvested profits by looking at the net income
and deducting any amounts that you pulled out of the business.
I’m not going to go through the mathematical proof of why this sustainable
growth formula is true. My experience is that the formula makes intuitive
sense to people who think about it for a few minutes. If you aren’t into the
intuition thing or you don’t believe me, get a college finance textbook and
look up its discussion of the sustainable growth formula. Or do what all the
kids today are doing — search an online search engine for “sustainable
growth formula.”

Chapter 21: (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas
How growth kills businesses
I don’t want to beat this sustainable growth
thing to death, but let me close with a true and
mercifully short story.
I just saw another entrepreneur fail because he
was successful. At first, he ignored the symp-
toms of fast growth. He needed another com-
puter, so he bought it. He had to hire another
person, so he just did it. Cash flow was tight and
getting tighter, but he ignored the problems.
After all, he was making a large number of
sales, and the business was growing. Sure,
things were getting awkward, but he didn’t need
to worry, right?
Unfortunately, because his cash flow was so
tight, he paid his vendors later and later. This sit-
uation went on for a few weeks until some ven-
dors started insisting on cash payments. One
Friday, he couldn’t make his payroll. He then
committed the unpardonable sin of borrowing
payroll tax money — something you should
never, ever do.
Finally, he had a large number of bills to pay and
with no cash to pay the bills and no cash in
sight. Employees quit. Vendors said, “No more.”
This lack of cash is what ultimately killed the
business. When the telephone company cuts off
your telephone service, you’re in serious trou-
ble. When your landlord locks you out of your
business location, you’re pretty much out of
luck.
The paradox in this story is that the guy had a
successful business. He just spread his finan-
cial resources too thin by growing too fast.

The First “What Happens if . . .” Formula
One curiosity about small businesses is that small changes in revenue or
income can have huge impacts on profits. A retailer who cruises along at
$200,000 in revenue and struggles to live on $30,000 a year never realizes that
boosting the sales volume by 20 percent to $250,000 may increase profits by
200 percent to $60,000.
If you take only one point away from this discussion, it should be this curious
little truth: If fixed costs don’t change, small changes in revenue can produce
big changes in profits.
The following example shows how this point works and provides a secret for-
mula. For starters, say that you currently generate $100,000 a year in revenue
and make $20,000 a year in profits. The revenue per item sold is $100, and the
variable cost per item sold is $35. (In this case, the fixed costs happen to be
$45,000 a year, but that figure isn’t all that important to the analysis.)
Accountants like to whip up little tables that describe these sorts of things,
so Table 21-4 gives the current story on your imaginary business.
Table 21-4

Revenue

Fixed costs

All the little things: rent, your salary, and so on.
Profits
$20,000
What’s left over.
Table 21-4 shows the current situation. But suppose that you want to know
what will happen to your profits if revenue increases by 20 percent but your
fixed costs don’t change. Mere mortals, not knowing what you and I know,
might assume that a 20 percent increase in revenue would produce an
approximate 20 percent increase in profits. But you know that small changes
in revenue can produce big changes in profits, right?
To estimate exactly how a change in revenue affects profits, use the following
secret formula:
Percentage × Revenue × (1 – Variable Cost per Item / Revenue per Item)
320
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

321
Chapter 21: (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas
Using the sample data provided in Table 21-4 (I’m sorry this example is start-
ing to resemble those story problems from eighth-grade math), you make the
following calculation:
0.20 × $100,000 × (1 – 35 / 100)
Work out the numbers, and you get 13,000. What does this figure mean? It
means that a 20 percent increase in revenue produces a $13,000 increase in
profits. As a percentage of profits, this $13,000 increase is 65 percent ($13,000
/ $20,000 = 65 percent).
Let me stop here and make a quick observation. In my experience, entrepre-
neurs always seem to think that they need to grow big to make big money.
They concentrate on doing things that will double or triple or quadruple
their sales. Their logic, though, isn’t always correct. If you can grow your
business without having to increase your fixed costs, small changes in rev-
enues can produce big changes in profits.
Before I stop talking about this first “What happens if . . .” formula, I want to
quickly describe where you get the inputs you need for the formula:
 The percentage change input is just a number that you pick. If you want
to see what happens to your profits with a 25 percent increase in sales,
for example, use 0.25.
 The revenue input is your total revenue. You can get it from your profit
and loss statement. (In Chapter 14, I describe how you can create a
profit and loss statement by using QuickBooks.)
 The revenue per item sold and variable costs per item sold figures work
the same way as I describe for the break-even formula earlier in this
chapter.
The Second “What Happens if . . .”
Formula
Maybe I shouldn’t tell you this, but people in finance, like me, usually have a
prejudice against people in sales. And it’s not just because people who are
good at sales usually make more money than people who are good at finance.
It’s really not. Honest to goodness.
Here’s the prejudice: People in finance think that people in sales always want
to reduce prices.

People in sales see things a bit differently. They say, in effect, “Hey, you worry
too much. We’ll make up the difference in additional sales volume.” The argu-
ment is appealing: You just undercut your competitor’s prices by a healthy
chunk and make less on each sale. But because you sell your stuff so cheaply,
your customers will beat a path to your door.
Just for the record, I love people who are good at sales. I think that someone
who is good at sales is more important than someone who is good at finance.
But, that painful admission aside, I have to tell you that I see a problem with
the “Cut the prices; we’ll make it up with volume” strategy. If you cut prices
by a given percentage — perhaps by 10 percent — you usually need a much
bigger percentage gain in revenue to break even.
The following example shows what I mean and how this strategy works.
Suppose that you have a business that sells some doohickey or thingamajig.
You generate $100,000 a year in revenue and make $20,000 a year in profits.
Your revenue per item, or doohickey, sold is $100, and your variable cost per
item, or doohickey, sold is $35. Your fixed costs happen to be $45,000 a year;
but, again, the fixed costs aren’t all that important to the analysis. Table 21-5
summarizes the current situation.

What’s left over.
Then business is particularly bad for one month. Joe-Bob, your sales guy,
comes to you and says, “Boss, I have an idea. I think that we can cut prices by
15 percent to $85 a doohickey and get a truly massive boost in sales.”
You’re a good boss. You’re a polite boss. Plus, you’re intrigued. So you think a
bit. The idea has a certain appeal. You start wondering how much of an
increase in sales you need to break even on the price reduction.
You’re probably not surprised to read this, but I have another secret formula
that can help. You can use the following formula to calculate how many items
(doohickeys, in the example) you need to sell just to break even on the new,
discounted price. Here’s the formula:
(Current Profits + Fixed Costs) / (Revenue per Item – Variable Cost per
Item)
322
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Using the example data provided earlier, you make the following calculation:
($20,000 + $45,000) / ($85 – $35)
Work out the numbers, and you get 1,300. What does this figure mean? It
means that just to break even on the $85 doohickey price, Joe-Bob needs to
sell 1,300 doohickeys. Currently, per Table 21-3, Joe-Bob sells 1,000 doohick-
eys a year. As a percentage, then, this jump from 1,000 doohickeys to 1,300
doohickeys is exactly a 30 percent increase. (Remember that Joe-Bob pro-
poses a 15 percent price cut.)
Okay, I don’t know Joe-Bob. He may be a great guy. He may be a wonderful
salesperson. But here’s my guess: Joe-Bob isn’t thinking about a 30 percent
increase in sales volume. (Remember, with a 15 percent price reduction, you
need a 30 percent increase just to break even!) And Joe-Bob almost certainly
isn’t thinking about a 50 percent or 75 percent increase in sales volume —
which is what you need to make money on the whole deal, as shown in 
Table 21-6.
Table 21-6

Profits

$42,500
In summary, you can’t reduce prices by, say, 15 percent and then go for some
penny-ante increase. You need huge increases in the sales volume to get big
increases in profits. If you look at Table 21-6, you can see that if you can
increase the sales from 1,000 doohickeys to 1,750 doohickeys — a 75 percent
increase — you can more than double the profits. This increase assumes that
the fixed costs stay level, as the table shows.
I want to describe quickly where you get the inputs that you need for the
formula:
 The profit figure can come right off the QuickBooks profit and loss
statement.
 The fixed costs figure just tallies all your fixed costs. (I talk about fixed
costs earlier in this chapter in “The ‘How Do I Break Even?’ Formula”
section.)
323
Chapter 21: (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas

 The revenue per item is just the new price that you’re considering.
 Finally, the variable cost per item is the cost of the thing you sell. (I dis-
cuss this cost earlier in the chapter, too.)
Please don’t construe the preceding discussion as proof that you should
never listen to the Joe-Bobs of the world. The “cut prices to increase volume”
strategy can work wonderfully well. The trick, however, is to increase the
sales volume massively. Sam Walton, the late founder of Wal-Mart, used the
strategy and became, at one point, the richest man in the world.
The Economic Order Quantity (a.k.a.
Isaac Newton) Formula
Isaac Newton invented differential calculus, a fact that is truly amazing to me.
I can’t imagine how someone could just figure out calculus. I could never, in a
hundred years, figure it out. But I’m getting off track.
The neat thing about calculus — besides the fact that I’m not going to do any
for you here — is that it enables you to create optimal values equations. One
of the coolest such equations is called the economic order quantity, or EOQ,
model. I know that this stuff all sounds terribly confusing and totally boring,
but stay with me for just another paragraph. (If you’re not satisfied in
another paragraph or so, skip ahead to the next secret formula.)
Perhaps you buy and then resell — oh, I don’t know — 2,000 cases of vintage
French wine every year. The EOQ model enables you to decide whether you
should order all 2,000 cases at one time, order 1 case at a time, or order some
number of cases in between 1 case and 2,000 cases.
Another way to say the same thing is that the EOQ model enables you to
choose the best, or optimal, reorder quantity for items that you buy and then
resell.
If you’re still with me at this point, I figure that you want to know how this
formula works. You need to know just three pieces of data to calculate the
optimal order quantity: the annual sales volume, the cost of placing an order,
and the annual cost of holding one unit in inventory. You plug this informa-
tion into the following formula:
(
)/
2
Sales Volume
Order Cost
AnnualHoldingCost per Item
#
#
324
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

You buy and resell 2,000 cases a year, so that amount is the sales volume.
Every time you place an order for the wine, you need to buy an $800 round-trip
ticket to Paris (just to sample the inventory) and pay $200 for a couple of
nights at a hotel. So your cost per order is $1,000. Finally, with insurance, inter-
est on a bank loan, and the cost of maintaining your hermetically sealed, tem-
perature-controlled wine cellar, the cost of storing a case of wine is about $100
a year. In this example, you can calculate the optimal order quantity as follows:
(
$
)/$
2
2000
1000
100
#
#
Work through the numbers, and you get 200. Therefore, the order quantity
that minimizes the total cost of your trips to Paris and of holding your expen-
sive wine inventory is 200 cases. You could, of course, make only one trip to
Paris a year and buy 2,000 cases of wine at once, thereby saving travel
money, but you would spend more money on holding your expensive wine
inventory than you would save on travel costs. And, although you could
reduce your wine inventory carrying costs by going to Paris every week and
picking up a few cases, your travel costs would go way, way up. (Of course,
you would get about a billion frequent flyer miles a year.)
You can use the Standard view of the Windows Calculator to compute eco-
nomic order quantities. The trick is to click the √(square root) key last. For
example, to calculate the economic order quantity in the preceding example,
you enter the following numbers and operators:

The Rule of 72
The Rule of 72 isn’t exactly a secret formula. It’s more like a general rule.
Usually, people use this rule to figure out how long it will take for some
investment or savings account to double in value. The Rule of 72 is a cool
little trick, however, and it has several useful applications for businesspeople.
What the rule says is that if you divide the value 72 by an interest rate per-
centage, your result is approximately the number of years it will take to
double your money. For example, if you can stick money into some invest-
ment that pays 12 percent interest, it will take roughly 6 years to double your
money because 72 / 12 = 6.
The Rule of 72 isn’t exact, but it’s usually close enough for government work.
For example, if you invest $1,000 for 6 years at 12 percent interest, what you
really get after 6 years isn’t $2,000 but $1,973.92.
325
Chapter 21: (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas

If you’re in business, you can use the Rule of 72 for a couple other 
forecasts, too:
 To forecast how long it will take inflation to double the price of an
item, divide 72 by the inflation rate. For example, if you own a building
with a value that you figure will at least keep up with inflation and you
wonder how long the building will take to double in value if inflation
runs at 4 percent, you just divide 72 by 4. The result is 18, meaning that
it will take roughly 18 years for the building to double in value. Again,
the Rule of 72 isn’t exactly on the money, but it’s dang close. A $100,000
building increases in value to $202,581.65 over 18 years if the annual
inflation rate is 4 percent.
 To forecast how long it will take to double sales volume, divide 72 by
the given annual growth rate. For example, if you can grow your busi-
ness by, say, 9 percent a year, you will roughly double the size of the
business in 8 years because 72 / 9 = 8. (I’m becoming kind of compulsive
about this point, I know, but let me say again that the rule isn’t exact,
but it’s very close. If a $1,000,000-a-year business grows 9 percent annu-
ally, its sales equal $1,992,562.64 after 8 years of 9 percent growth. This
figure really means that the business will generate roughly $2,000,000 of
sales in the ninth year.)

ppendixes are like basements. Why? You use them to
store stuff that you want to keep but don’t know
where else to put. The appendixes that follow provide
instructions for installing QuickBooks, an overview of
accounting, and some help with project estimating.

Appendix A
Installing QuickBooks 
in Ten Easy Steps
I
f you haven’t already installed QuickBooks, get it over with right now:
1. Turn on the PC.
Find and flip on the computer’s power switch. (Depending on whether
you’re using Windows 95, 98, NT, Windows 2000, Windows Me, or
Windows XP, your screen may look a little different from the figures
here.) I’m using Windows XP Professional, by the way. Not that you care
or that it matters. . . .
If you’re installing QuickBooks on a computer running Windows NT,
Windows 2000, or Windows XP Professional, you need to log on as either
the administrator or a user with administrator rights. With these opera-
ting systems, Windows security features require an administrator to
install the QuickBooks program.
2. Get the QuickBooks CD.
Rip open the QuickBooks package and get out the CD (which looks
exactly like the ones that play music).
3. Insert the CD in your CD-ROM drive.
If you have any amount of luck, Windows recognizes that you’ve inserted
the QuickBooks CD and displays a little message box that asks if you
want to install QuickBooks. If you see this dialog box — you might have
to wait a few minutes — click the Yes button and skip to Step 6.
4. If nothing happened when you inserted the QuickBooks CD, open the
Control Panel window.
In Windows XP, click the Start button and then choose Control Panel. In
most versions of Windows, including Windows 2000, you click the Start
button and then choose Settings➪Control Panel from the Start menu.
Figure A-1 shows the Windows XP Control Panel window that appears.

5. Start the Windows Install program.
In most versions of Windows, you can do this by double-clicking the Add
or Remove Programs icon. When the dialog box in Figure A-2 appears,
click Add New Programs and follow the on-screen instructions. You need
to press the Enter key several times to move through some dialog boxes.
Figure A-2, I should mention, is the Windows XP Add/Remove Programs
tool. If you’re using some other flavor of Windows, the tool looks diffe-
rent. But it works in roughly the same way.
6. Tell QuickBooks how you want it to install itself.
Ultimately, the QuickBooks installation program slowly begins extracting
files from the CD. Did I mention this process is slow? Think “glacier
sliding down the side of a mountain.” Finally, the QuickBooks setup
window appears (Figure A-3). Enter the CD key code (which is printed on
a yellow sticker on the back of the CD sleeve) and click Next to begin the
installation process. Then follow the on-screen instructions. If you have
a question about an installation option, just accept the QuickBooks sug-
gestion by pressing Enter. (The suggested, or default, installation
options are fine for 999 out of 1,000 users.)
7. Click Next to begin copying the files.
QuickBooks gives you a summary of your installation choices and then
tells you to click Next to begin copying the files. Do so. As the installa-
tion program runs, you should see a little bar that shows your progress.
Figure A-1:
The Control
Panel
window.
330
Part V: Appendixes 

If you need to cancel the installation at any time, click Cancel.
QuickBooks warns you that the setup is incomplete. That’s okay — 
just start the setup from scratch next time around.
8. Take 30 seconds or so to contemplate the meaning of life or get a
drink of water.
9. After the Install program finishes, click Restart.
Congratulations. You’re finished with the installation. You have a new item
on the Programs menu and probably new shortcuts on your desktop.
10. (Optional) Celebrate.
Stand up at your desk, click your heels together three times, and repeat
the phrase, “There’s no place like home, Toto; there’s no place like
home.” And watch out for flying houses.
As soon as you’re done celebrating, you may want to flip to Chapter 1 and
find out how to register the program. You’ll probably want to register
QuickBooks before you begin using it.
If you work on a network and want to be able to share a QuickBooks file
stored on one computer with other computers on the network, you need to
install QuickBooks on all of the other computers that you want to use to work
with the file. Note: You need a separate copy of QuickBooks — such as from
the five-pack version — for each computer on which you want to install
QuickBooks.

By the way, just because I’ve had a couple of clients ask about this in the last
week: Running QuickBooks on a network with multiple QuickBooks users
isn’t super-tricky or terribly complicated. QuickBooks takes care of the hard
stuff. If you have more than one person using QuickBooks, you owe it to your-
self (and your business) to set up a network and then purchase and install
multiple copies of QuickBooks. Refer to Chapter 3 for more information.

Appendix B
If Numbers Are Your Friends
You don’t need to know much about accounting or about double-entry
bookkeeping to use QuickBooks, which, as you know, is most of its
appeal. But if you’re serious about this accounting business or serious about
your business, consider finding out a bit more; setting up QuickBooks and
understanding all the QuickBooks reports will be easier, and you’ll be more
sophisticated in your accounting, too.
Just because the accounting in this appendix is a little more complicated
doesn’t mean that you can’t understand it. To make this whole discussion
more concrete, I use one big example. Hope it helps you out! If nothing else,
it’ll inspire you to get into the rowboat rental business.
Keying In on Profit
Start with the big picture. The key purpose of an accounting system is to
enable you to answer the burning question, “Am I making any money?”
Accounting is that simple. Really. At least conceptually. So, throughout the
rest of this appendix, I just talk about how to calculate a business’s profits in
a reasonably accurate but still practical manner.
Let me introduce you to the new you
You just moved to Montana for the laid-back living and fresh air. You live in a
cute log cabin on Flathead Lake. To support yourself, you plan to purchase
several rowboats and rent them to visiting fly fishermen. Of course, you’ll
probably need to do quite a bit of fly-fishing, too. But just consider that the
price you pay for being your own boss.

The first day in business
It’s your first day in business. About 5 a.m., ol’ Peter Gruntpaw shows up to
deliver your three rowboats. He made them for you in his barn, but even so,
they aren’t cheap. He charges $1,500 apiece, so you write him a check for
$4,500.
Peter’s timing, as usual, is impeccable. About 5:15 a.m., your first customers
arrive. Mr. and Mrs. Hamster (pronounced ohm-stair) are visiting from
Phoenix. They want to catch the big fish. You’re a bit unsure of your pricing,
but you suggest $25 an hour for the boat. They agree and pay $200 in cash for
eight hours.
A few minutes later, another couple arrives. The Gerbils (pronounced go-
bells) are very agitated. They were supposed to meet the Hamsters and fish
together, but the Hamsters are rowing farther and farther away from the
dock. To speed the Gerbils’ departure, you let them leave without paying. But
you’re not worried. As the Gerbils leave the dock, Ms. Gerbil shouts, “We’ll
pay you the $200 when we get back!”
Although you don’t rent the third boat, you do enjoy a sleepy summer morning.
About 2 p.m., the Hamsters and Gerbils come rowing back into view.
Obviously, though, a problem has occurred. You find out what it is when the
first boat arrives. “Gerbil fell into the lake,” laughs Mr. Hamster. “Lost his
wallet, too.” Everybody else seems to think that the lost wallet is funny. You
secretly wonder how you’re going to get paid. No wallet, no money.
You ask Mr. Gerbil if he would like to come out to the lake tomorrow to pay
you. He says he’ll just write you a check when he gets home to Phoenix.
Reluctantly, you agree.
Look at your cash flow first
I’ve just described a fairly simple situation. But even so, answering the ques-
tion, “Did I make any money?” isn’t going to be easy. You start by looking at
your cash flow: You wrote a check for $4,500, and you collected $200 in cash.
Table B-1 shows your cash flow.
334
Part V: Appendixes 

Table B-1
The First Day’s Cash Flow
Cash In and Out

Add the cash in:
Rent money from Hamsters 
$200
(pronounced ohm-stairs)
Rent money from Gerbils 
$0
(pronounced go-bells)
Subtract the cash out:
Money to purchase rowboats
($4,500)
Equals your cash flow:
($4,300)
To summarize, you had $200 come in but $4,500 go out. So your cash flow
was –$4,300. (That’s why the $4,300 is in parentheses.) From a cash-flow per-
spective, the first day doesn’t look all that good, right? But does the cash-
flow calculation show you whether you’re making money? Can you look at it
and gauge whether your little business is on the right track?
The answer to both questions is no. Your cash flow is important. You can’t,
for example, write a $4,500 check unless you have at least $4,500 in your
checking account. But your cash flow doesn’t tell you whether you’re making
money. In fact, you may see a couple of problems with looking just at the
cash flow of the rowboat rental business.
Depreciation is an accounting gimmick
Here’s the first problem: If you take good care of the rowboats, you can use
them every summer for the next few years. In fact, say that the rowboat
rental season, which runs from early spring to late autumn, is 150 days long
and that your well-made rowboats will last 10 years.
 You can probably rent the rowboats for 1,500 days.
(150 days a year times 10 years equals 1,500 days)
 Each rowboat costs $1,500.
The depreciation expense for each rowboat is only $1 per day over 1,500
days. That’s a whopping $3 for all three boats.
Do you see what I’m saying? If you have something that costs a great deal 
of money but lasts for a long time, spreading out the cost makes sense. This
spreading out is usually called depreciation. The little $1 chunks that are allo-
cated to a day are called the depreciation expense.
335
Appendix B: If Numbers Are Your Friends

Accountants use the terms cost and expense to mean distinctly different
things. A cost is the price you pay for something. If you pay Peter Gruntpaw
$1,500 for a rowboat, the rowboat’s cost is $1,500. An expense, on the other
hand, is what you use in a profit calculation. The little $1 chunks of the row-
boat’s $1,500 cost (that are allocated to individual days) are expenses.
If this depreciation stuff seems wacky, remember that what you’re really
trying to do is figure out whether you made any money your first day of busi-
ness. And all I’m really saying is that you shouldn’t include the whole cost of
the rowboats as an expense in the first day’s profit calculation. Some of the
cost should be included as an expense in calculating the profit in future days.
That’s fair, right?
Accrual-basis accounting is cool
You don’t want to forget about the $200 that the Gerbils owe you either.
Although Mr. Gerbil (remember that the name’s pronounced go-bell) may not
send you the check for several days, or even for several weeks, he will pay
you. You’ve earned the money.
The principles of accounting say that you should include sales in your profit
calculations when you earn the money and not when you actually collect it.
The logic behind this “include sales when they’re earned” rule is that it pro-
duces a better estimate of the business you’re doing.
Say that the day after the Gerbils and Hamsters rent the rowboats, you have
no customers, but Mr. Gerbil comes out and pays you $200. If you use the
“include sales when they’re earned” rule — or what’s called accrual-basis
accounting — your daily sales look like this:
336
Part V: Appendixes 
Different names, same logic
I don’t see any point in hiding this nasty little
accounting secret from you: Accountants call
this cost-allocation process by different names,
depending on what sort of cost is being spread
out.
Most of the time, the cost allocation is called
depreciation. You depreciate buildings, machin-
ery, furniture, and many other items as well. But
allocating the cost of a natural resource —
such as crude oil that you pump, coal that you
dig up, or minerals that you extract — is called
depletion. And allocating the cost of things that
aren’t tangible — copyrights and patents, for
example — is amortization.

Day 1
Day 2
Sales

$0
If you instead use what’s called cash-basis accounting (in which you count
sales when you collect the cash), your daily sales look like this:
Day 1
Day 2
Sales
$200
$200
The traditional accrual-based accounting method shows that you have a
good day when you rent two boats and a terrible day when you don’t rent
any boats. In comparison, when you use cash-basis accounting your sales
record looks as if you rented a boat each day, even though you didn’t. Now
you know why accrual-basis accounting is a better way to measure profit.
Accrual-basis accounting also works for expenses. You should count an
expense when you make it, not when you pay it. For example, you call the
local radio station and ask the people there to announce your new boat
rental business a couple of times for a fee of $25. Although you don’t have 
to pay the radio station the day you make the arrangements for your
announcement, you should still count the $25 as an expense for that day.
Now you know how to measure profits
With what you now know, you’re ready to measure the first day’s profits.
Table B-2 is a profit and loss statement for your first day in business.

Appendix B: If Numbers Are Your Friends

Although the first day’s cash flow was terrible, your little business is quite
profitable. In fact, if you really do make about $370 a day, you’ll recoup your
entire $4,500 investment in less than three weeks. That’s pretty darn good.
Some financial brain food
Now that you know how to measure profits, I can fill you in on some impor-
tant conceptual stuff:
 You measure profits for a specific period of time.
In the rowboat business example, you measured the profits for a day.
Some people actually do measure profits (or they try to measure profits)
on a daily basis. But most times, people use bigger chunks of time.
Monthly chunks of time are common, for example. And so are three-
month chunks of time. Everybody measures profits annually — if only
because the government makes you do so for income tax accounting.
 When people start talking about how often and for what chunks of
time profits are measured, they use a couple of terms.
The year you calculate profits for is called the fiscal year. The smaller
chunks of time for which you measure profits over the year are called
accounting periods or interim accounting periods.
You don’t need to memorize the two new terms. But now that you’ve
read them, you’ll probably remember them.
 The length of your accounting periods involves an awkward trade-off.
Daily profit and loss calculations show you how well you did at the end
of every day, but you have to collect the data and do the work every day.
And preparing a profit and loss statement is a great deal of work.
I made the example purposefully easy by including only a few transac-
tions, but in real life, you have many more transactions to worry about
and fiddle with.
 If you use a quarterly interim accounting period, you don’t have to
collect the raw data and do the arithmetic very often, but you know
how you’re doing only every once in a while.
In my mind, checking your profits only four times a year isn’t enough. A
lot can happen in three months.
In the Old Days, Things Were Different
If you’re new to the arithmetic and logic of profit calculation — which is
mostly what modern accounting is all about — you won’t be surprised to
338
Part V: Appendixes 

hear that not all that long ago, most people couldn’t and didn’t do much
profit calculating.
What they did instead was monitor a business’s financial condition. They
used — well, actually, they still use — a balance sheet to monitor the financial
condition. A balance sheet just lists a business’s assets and its liabilities at a
particular point in time.
Say that at the start of your first day in the rowboat rental business — before
you pay Peter Gruntpaw — you have $5,000 in your checking account. To
make the situation interesting, $4,000 of this money is a loan from your
mother-in-law, and $1,000 is cash that you’ve invested in your business.
Here’s a key to help you understand the balance sheets and cash flow in this
section:
 A business’s assets consist of the things the business owns.
 Liabilities consist of the amounts the business owes.
 Equity is the difference between the business’s assets and its liabilities.
Interestingly, equity also shows the money the owners or shareholders
or partners have left in the business.
 If you correctly calculate each of the numbers that go on the balance
sheet, the total assets value always equals the total liabilities and total
owner’s equity value.
Your balance sheet at the beginning of the day looks like the one in Table B-3.

Appendix B: If Numbers Are Your Friends

If you construct a balance sheet at the end of the first day, the financial pic-
ture is only slightly more complicated. Some of these explanations are too
complicated to give in a sentence, so the paragraphs that follow describe
how I got each number.
Even if you don’t pay all that much attention, I recommend that you quickly
read through the explanations. Mostly, I want you to understand that if you
try to monitor a business’s financial condition by using a balance sheet, as
I’ve done here, the picture gets messy. Later in this appendix, I talk about
how QuickBooks makes all this stuff easier.
Table B-4 shows the balance sheet at the end of the first day.

Cash, the first line item shown in Table B-4, is the most complicated line item
to prove. If you were really in the rowboat rental business, of course, you
could just look at your checkbook. But if you were writing an appendix about
being in the rowboat rental business — as I am — you’d need to be able to
calculate the cash balance. Table B-5 shows the calculation of the cash bal-
ance for your rowboat rental business.

The $200 receivable, the second line item shown in Table B-4, is the money
the Gerbils owe you.
The third line shown in Table B-4, the Rowboats balance sheet value, is
$4,497. This is weird, I’ll grant you. But here’s how you figure it: You take the
original cost of the asset and deduct all the depreciation expense that you’ve
charged to date. The original cost of the three rowboats was $4,500. You’ve
charged only $3 of depreciation for the first day, so the balance sheet value,
or net book value, is $4,497.
The only liabilities are the $25 you owe the radio station for those new busi-
ness announcements (shown on the seventh line in Table B-4) and that $4,000
you borrowed from your mother-in-law (shown on the eighth line in Table B-
4). I won’t even ask why you opened that can of worms.
Finally, the owner’s equity section of the balance sheet shows the $1,000 you
originally contributed (see line 10 in Table B-4) and also the $372 of money
you earned (see line 11 in Table B-4).
It’s not a coincidence that the total assets value equals the total liabilities and
total owner’s equity value. If you correctly calculate each of the numbers that
go on the balance sheet, the two totals are always equal.
A balance sheet lists asset, liability, and owner’s equity balances as of a spe-
cific date. It gives you a financial snapshot at a point in time. Usually, you pre-
pare a balance sheet whenever you prepare a profit and loss statement. The
balance sheet shows account balances for the last day of the fiscal year and
interim accounting period. (I think that it’s kind of neat that after only a few
pages of this appendix you’re reading and understanding such terms as fiscal
year and interim accounting period.)
341
Appendix B: If Numbers Are Your Friends

What Does an Italian Monk 
Have to Do with Anything?
So far, I’ve provided narrative descriptions of all the financial events that
affect the balance sheet and the income statement. I described how you
started the business with $5,000 of cash (a $4,000 loan from your mother-in-
law and $1,000 of cash that you yourself invested). At an even earlier point in
this appendix, I noted how you rented a boat to the Hamsters for $200, and
they paid you in cash.
Although the narrative descriptions of financial events — such as starting the
business or renting to the Hamsters — make for just-bearable reading, they
are unwieldy for accountants to use in practice. Partly, this awkwardness is
because accountants are usually (or maybe always?) terrible writers. But an
even bigger problem is that using the lots-and-lots-of-words approach makes
describing all the little bits and pieces of information that you need difficult
and downright tedious.
Fortunately, about 500 years ago, an Italian monk named Lucia Pacioli
thought the same thing. No, I’m not making this up. What Pacioli really said
was, “Hey, guys. Hello? Is anybody in there? You have to get more efficient in
the way that you describe your financial transactions. You have to create a
financial shorthand system that works when you have a large number of
transactions to record.”
Pacioli then proceeded to describe a financial shorthand system that made it
easy to collect all the little bits and pieces of information needed to prepare
income statements and balance sheets. The shorthand system he described?
Double-entry bookkeeping.
This system enabled people to name the income statement or balance sheet
line items or accounts that are affected and then give the dollar amount of
the effect. The profit and loss statement and the balance sheet line items are
called accounts. You need to remember this term.
A list of profit and loss statement and balance sheet line items is called a
chart of accounts. You may already know this term from using QuickBooks.
Pacioli also did one wacky thing. He used a couple of new terms — debit and
credit — to describe the increases and decreases in accounts.
 Increases in asset accounts and in expense accounts are debits.
Decreases in liability, owner’s equity, and income accounts are also
debits.
 Decreases in asset and expense accounts are credits. Increases in liab-
ility, owner’s equity, and income accounts are also credits.
342
Part V: Appendixes 

Keeping these terms straight is a bit confusing, so refer to Table B-6 for help.
I’m sorry to have to tell you this, but if you want to use double-entry book-
keeping, you need to memorize the information in Table B-6. If it’s any conso-
lation, this information is the only chunk of data in the entire book that I ask
you to memorize. Or, failing that, mark this page with a dog-ear so that you
can flip here quickly, or just refer to the Cheat Sheet.

And now for the blow-by-blow
The best way to help you understand this double-entry bookkeeping stuff is
to show you how to use it to record all the financial events that I’ve dis-
cussed thus far in this appendix. Start with the money that you’ve invested in
the business and the money that you foolishly borrowed from your mother-
in-law. You invested $1,000 in cash, and you borrowed $4,000 in cash. Here
are the double-entry bookkeeping transactions — called journal entries —
that describe these financial events.

Cash
$1,000

Debit
Credit
Cash
$4,000
Loan payable to mother-in-law
$4,000
If you add up all the debits and credits in a journal entry, you get something
called a trial balance. A trial balance isn’t all that special, but you use it to
prepare profit and loss statements and balance sheets easily. If you add up
the debits and credits shown in journal entries 1 and 2, you get the trial bal-
ance shown in Table B-7.
Table B-7
Your First Trial Balance
Debit
Credit
Cash
$5,000
Loan payable to mother-in-law
$4,000
Owner’s equity

This trial balance provides the raw data needed to construct the rowboat
business balance sheet at the start of the first day. If you don’t believe me,
take a peek at Table B-3. Oh sure, the information shown in Table B-7 isn’t as
polished. Table B-7 doesn’t provide labels, for example, that tell you that cash
is an asset. And Table B-7 doesn’t provide subtotals showing the total assets
(equal to $5,000) and the total liabilities and owner’s equity (also equal to
$5,000). But it does provide the raw data.
Take a look at the journal entries you would make to record the rest of the
first day’s financial events:

To build a trial balance for the end of the first day, you add all the first day
journal entries to the trial balance shown in Table B-7. The result is the trial
balance shown in Table B-8.

The trial balance shown in Table B-8 provides the raw data used to prepare
the balance sheet and profit and loss statement for the first day.
If you look at the accounts labeled “Balance sheet accounts” in Table B-8 and
compare these to the balance sheet shown in Table B-4, you see that this trial
balance provides all the raw numbers needed for the balance sheet. The only
numbers in Table B-4 that aren’t directly from Table B-8 are the subtotals you
get by adding up other numbers.
If you look at the accounts labeled as “Profit and loss statement accounts” in
Table B-8 and compare them to the profit and loss statement shown in Table
B-2, you see that this trial balance also provides all the raw numbers needed
for the profit and loss statement. Again, the only numbers in Table B-2 that
aren’t directly from Table B-8 are the subtotals you get by adding up other
numbers.
Blow-by-blow, part II
If you understand what I’ve discussed so far, you grasp how accounting and
double-entry bookkeeping work. I want to show you about a half dozen more
example transactions, however, to plug a few minor holes in your knowledge.
When you collect money you’ve previously billed, you record the transaction
by debiting cash and crediting receivables (or accounts receivable). In the
rowboat business, you make this basic entry when Mr. Gerbil later pays you
the $200 he owes you for the first day’s rental.
346
Part V: Appendixes 

Journal entry 8: To record a payment by a customer
Debit
Credit

Don’t record a sale when you collect the cash. The sale has already been
recorded in journal entry 5. When you pay the radio station for the advertising,
you record the transaction by debiting accounts payable and crediting cash.
Journal entry 9: To record your payment of $25 to the radio station
Debit
Credit
Payable
$25
Cash
$25
The one other thing I want to cover — ever so briefly — is inventory account-
ing. Accounting for items you buy and resell or the items you make and resell
is a bit trickier. And I don’t have room to go into a great deal of detail.
When you buy items to resell, you debit an asset account, often named
Inventory. If you purchase 300 of the $10 thingamajigs you hope to resell 
for $25 each, you record the following journal entry:
Journal entry 10: To record the cash purchase of thingamajigs
Debit
Credit
Inventory
$3,000
Cash
$3,000
When you sell a thingamajig, you need to do two tasks: record the sale and
record the cost of the sale. If you need to record the sale of 100 thingamajigs
for $25 each, for example, you record the following journal entry:
347
Appendix B: If Numbers Are Your Friends

Journal entry 11: To record the sale of 100 thingamajigs 
for $25 apiece
Debit
Credit
Receivable
$2,500
Sales
$2,500
You also need to record the cost of the thingamajigs that you’ve sold as an
expense and record the reduction in the value of your thingamajig inventory.
That means that if you reduce your inventory count from 300 items to 200
items, you need to adjust your inventory’s dollar value. You record the fol-
lowing journal entry:
Journal entry 12: To record the cost of the 100 thingamajigs sold
Debit
Credit
Cost of goods sold
$1,000
Inventory
$1,000
The cost of goods sold account, by the way, is just another expense. It
appears on your profit and loss statement.
How does QuickBooks help?
If you (or someone else) keep the books for your business manually, you
actually have to make these journal entries. But if you use QuickBooks to
keep the books, all this debiting and crediting business usually goes on
behind the scenes. When you invoice a customer, QuickBooks debits
accounts receivable and credits sales. When you write a check to pay some
bill, QuickBooks debits the expense (or the accounts payable account) and
credits cash.
In the few cases in which a financial transaction isn’t recorded automatically
when you fill in some on-screen form, you need to use the General Journal
Entry window. To display the General Journal Entry window, choose
Company➪Make Journal Entry. You use the General Journal Entry window 
to create journal entries.
348
Part V: Appendixes 

QuickBooks automatically builds a trial balance, using journal entries it
constructs automatically and any journal entries that you enter by using the
General Journal Entry window. If you want to see the trial balance, just
choose Reports➪Accountant & Taxes➪Trial Balance. QuickBooks prepares
balance sheets, profit and loss statements, and several other reports as well,
using the trial balance.
Two Dark Shadows in the 
World of Accounting
The real purpose of accounting systems, such as QuickBooks, is simple:
Accounting systems are supposed to make succeeding in your business 
easier for you. You may think, therefore, that the world of accounting is a
friendly place. Unfortunately, this scenario isn’t quite true. I’m sorry to report
that two dark shadows hang over the world of accounting: financial accounting
standards and income tax laws.
The first dark shadow
“Financial accounting standards,” you say. “What the heck are those?”
Here’s the quick-and-dirty explanation: Financial accounting standards are
accounting rules created by certified public accountants. These rules are
supposed to make reading financial statements and understanding what’s
going on easier for people. (I happen to believe that just the opposite is true,
in case you’re interested.) But because of what financial accounting stan-
dards purport to do, some people — such as bank loan officers — want to
see profit and loss statements and balance sheets that follow the rules. The
exact catchphrase is one that you might have heard before: “Prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.”
Unfortunately, the rules are very complicated. The rules are inconsistently
interpreted. And actually applying the rules would soon run most small busi-
nesses into the ground. (And as you were running your business into the
ground — you’ll be happy to know — your certified public accountant would
make a great deal of money helping you figure out what you were supposed
to be doing.) So what should you do about this first dark shadow?
Glad you asked:
 Well, first of all, know that it exists. Know that people like your banker
honestly think that you should follow a super-complicated set of
accounting rules.
349
Appendix B: If Numbers Are Your Friends

 Also, don’t get sucked into the financial accounting standards tar pit.
Tell people — your banker included — that you do your accounting in
the way that you think enables you to best manage your business. Tell
people a small business like yours can’t afford to have an in-house staff
of full-time CPAs. And finally, tell people that you don’t necessarily pre-
pare your financial statements “in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.”
Do attempt to fully and fairly disclose your financial affairs to people who
need to know about them. Lying to a creditor or an investor about your finan-
cial affairs or getting sneaky with one of these people is a good way to end up
in jail.
The second dark shadow
And now here’s the second dark shadow: income tax accounting laws. You
know that Congress enacts tax legislation to raise revenue. And you know
that it does so in a political environment strewn with all sorts of partisan
voodoo economics and social overtones. So you won’t be surprised to find
out that the accounting rules that come out of the nation’s capital and your
state capital don’t make much sense for running a business.
You need to apply the rules when you prepare your tax return, of course. But
you don’t have to use them the rest of the year. A far better approach is to do
your accounting in a way that enables you to best run your business. That
way, you don’t use accounting tricks and gambits that make sense for income
tax accounting but foul up your accounting system. At the end of the year,
when you’re preparing your tax return, have your tax preparer adjust your
trial balance so that it conforms to income tax accounting laws.
The Danger of Shell Games
This appendix is longer than I initially intended. I’m sorry about that. I want
to share one more thought with you, however. And I think that it’s an impor-
tant thought, so please stay with me just a little longer.
You could use the accounting knowledge that this appendix imparts to do the
bookkeeping for a very large business. As crazy as it sounds, if you had 3,000
rowboats for rent — perhaps you have rental outlets at dozens of lakes scat-
tered all over the Rockies — you might actually be able to keep the books for
a $200,000,000-a-year business. You would have to enter many more transac-
tions, and the numbers would all be bigger, but you wouldn’t necessarily be
doing anything more complicated than the transactions in this appendix.
350
Part V: Appendixes 

Unfortunately, the temptation is great — especially on the part of financial
advisers — to let the money stuff get more complicated as a business grows.
People start talking about sophisticated leasing arrangements that make
sense because of the tax laws. Some customer or vendor suggests some com-
plicated profit-sharing or cost-reimbursement agreement. Then your attorney
talks you into setting up a couple new subsidiaries for legal reasons.
All these schemes make accounting for your business terribly complicated. If
you choose to ignore this complexity and go on your merry way, very soon
you won’t know whether you’re making money. (I’ve seen plenty of people go
this route — and it isn’t pretty.) On the other hand, if you truly want to do
accurate accounting in a complex environment, you need to spend a great
deal of cash for really smart accountants. (This tactic, of course, supposes
that you can find, hire, and afford these really smart accountants.)
If you’re unsure about how to tell whether something is just too complicated,
here’s a general rule you can use: If you can’t easily create the journal entries
that quantify the financial essence of some event, you’re in trouble.
So, what should you do? I suggest that you don’t complicate your business’s
finances — not even if you think that the newfangled, tax-incentivized, sale-
leaseback profit plan is a sure winner. Keep things simple, my friend. To win
the game, you have to keep score.

QuickBooks Pro and QuickBooks Premier have a feature that’s very inter-

contractors, consultants, engineers, architects, and so on. QuickBooks Pro
and QuickBooks Premier (unlike the regular QuickBooks program) have the
capability to do simple project or job costing. This capability means that
your business can create project or job estimates, track costs by project or
job, and bill invoices by project or job.
Turning On Job and Project Costing
To turn on the project estimating feature in QuickBooks Pro, choose
Edit➪Preferences. Click the Jobs & Estimates icon on the left, click the
Company Preferences tab (shown in Figure C-1), and then use the Do You
Create Estimates and Do You Do Progress Invoicing buttons to tell
QuickBooks whether, in fact, you want to do these things. You get this, right?
You click the Yes button if you do. You click the No button if you don’t.
While you’re looking at the Company Preferences tab shown in Figure C-1, let
me also mention that, as the figure shows, QuickBooks lets you categorize
jobs as falling into several different states: Pending, Awarded, In Progress,
Closed, and Not Awarded. As you might guess, you use these Job Status
classes and descriptions to categorize your jobs.
Setting Up a Job
If you want to use QuickBooks job costing, your first step is to set up a job.
For example, if you’re a contractor, you can use QuickBooks to track the
invoices and costs of the remodeling jobs you do. You just need to set up a
job every time you get ready to bid on a project.

To set up a job, first set up a customer in the usual way. Then set up a job
also in the usual way. In Chapter 2, I describe how you do this, so I won’t
repeat that information here. Just to save you time, however, I’d mention that
all you need to do is choose Lists➪Customer:Job List to tell QuickBooks that
you want to set up a job, select the customer you may do a job for, and then
choose the Add Job command from the Customer:Job pop-up menu and fill
out the window that QuickBooks displays. 
Creating a Job Estimate
In QuickBooks Pro, project costing starts with an estimate. An estimate is just
a list of the estimated costs you’ll incur for some job you’ll perform for some
customer.
Assuming that you’ve already created a job and have told QuickBooks you
use estimates, here are the steps you follow to create an estimate:
1. Get the form.
Choose the Customers➪Create Estimates command. QuickBooks opens
a Create Estimates form, which bears an uncanny resemblance to the
Create Invoices form you’ve seen if you’ve worked with QuickBooks at
all. (See Chapter 4 for more information about the Create Invoices form.)

Estimates

Part V: Appendixes 

2. Start filling in the blanks.
Choose the appropriate Customer:Job from the drop-down list box at the
top of the form. QuickBooks Pro automatically fills in as much informa-
tion as it can — usually at least the Name/Address box — on the form.
If you configured QuickBooks Pro to track classes, the appropriate drop-
down list box shows up in the top center of the form. Go ahead and use
the box, if appropriate.
Feel free to change the default settings — the Date and Estimate #, for
example. The Date Setting tricks that you can find in Chapter 4 and on
the Cheat Sheet in the front of this book may come in handy here.
3. Add the line items — details, details, details.
You fill in the details of a Create Estimates window in the same manner
in which you fill in the details of a Create Invoices window. Refer to
Chapter 4 if you have questions.
In Chapter 2, I describe how to add items to the QuickBooks Items list.
Each line item that you want to include on your project estimate needs
to be described in the Items list.
4. Add any optional information.
If you want to, use any of the other boxes available in the Create Estimates
window to collect and store additional information. For example, just as
with the Create Invoices window, you can click the Customer Message
drop-down list box and write a friendly message, or use one from the
drop-down list.
You can also click the Memo line and write a note to yourself regarding
the project if you like. Or maybe some notes for the screenplay that
you’ve been thinking about pitching to the studios. Whatever suits your
fancy.
If you want to include other items in the Create Estimates window, you can
customize that window. Choose Customize from the Template drop-down list
box in the upper-right corner of the Create Estimates window. QuickBooks
gives you a list of your estimate forms. Choose the one you want to edit. (You
may have only one estimate form on the list if you’ve never created a new
one.) Click either the New or Edit button. If you click New, QuickBooks dis-
plays the Customize Estimate dialog box.
In Chapter 4, I talk a bit about how to customize invoice forms. You might
want to look there if you have questions about how to customize the Create
Invoices form.
Before you print that estimate, remember that the Create Estimates window
isn’t the same information that appears on the written estimate. To see how
the printed version looks, click the arrow beside the Print button in the
Create Estimates window and choose Preview from the drop-down list. The
result is a full-page image, shrunk to fit on-screen.
355
Appendix C: Project Estimating, Billing, and Tracking

If you haven’t saved your estimate yet, go ahead and click Save & New or
Save & Close.
To examine the estimate (or any on-screen QuickBooks form) more closely,
either click the Zoom In button at the top of the Print Preview screen or move
the mouse cursor over the image. When the cursor looks like a magnifying
glass with a plus sign in it, click the left mouse button. Because you can see
only part of the preview at a time this way, use the scroll bars at the bottom
and right of the windows to move around to the different areas.
Note that the magnifying glass now has a minus sign in it, and the Zoom In
button has changed to Zoom Out. If you complete more than one estimate,
you can use the Prev Page and Next Page buttons on the Print Preview screen
to look at other estimates. When you finish, click the Close button.
When you get back to the Create Estimates window, click the Print button;
QuickBooks Pro displays the Print One Estimate dialog box. Click Print to
print the estimate without any further ado.
If you haven’t used QuickBooks to print estimates before, you may first need
to set up your printer for this task. To do so, choose File➪Printer Setup and
select Estimate from the Form Name drop-down list box. Then specify the
printer settings you want for printing estimates. (This process works the
same way as it does for printing other forms, such as invoices, as I describe
in Chapter 4.) Click OK when you’re done. The Print One Estimate dialog box
that QuickBooks displays after you click Print in the Create Estimates
window also works the same way as the Print One Invoice dialog box does.
Turn back to Chapter 4 if you need help with this dialog box.
Revising an Estimate
To revise an estimate, display the Create Estimates window as described ear-
lier in this appendix. Then click the Previous button until you see the estimate.
Make your changes, and QuickBooks recalculates all the totals. Smile.
Imagine doing this task by hand — the recalculations, the looking up of the
prices, the retyping, the inordinate amount of wasted time. Making these
changes automatically with QuickBooks doesn’t quite beat a hot dog with
sauerkraut in the park on a sunny day, but it’s pretty close.
You can only keep one estimate per job. After you click Save & New, any
changes you make automatically take the place of the old estimate.
356
Part V: Appendixes 

Turning an Estimate into an Invoice
You can easily turn the estimate into an invoice by following these steps:
1. Choose Customers➪Create Estimates.
The Create Estimates window opens.
2. Use the Previous and Next buttons to select the estimate that you want
to use.
3. Click the Create Invoice button at the top of the window.
QuickBooks creates an invoice based on your estimate. If you need to
make any changes, you edit the invoice directly. Click OK to continue.
4. (Optional) Make any necessary changes to the resulting invoice.
The invoice that you see is a regular QuickBooks Pro invoice, and you
can edit it the same way that you edit any invoice. Until you click Save &
New, the invoice isn’t recorded in your records.
5. After you make all your changes, click Save & New or Save & Close to
record the invoice.
If you want to print the invoice instead, you can click the Print button.
Charging for Actual Time and Costs
If you’re going to charge the customer for actual costs, you need to track the
costs and time as you incur the charges for them. The way you assign the
cost to the job is by entering the customer and job information into the
Customer:Job column that’s shown in the form window used to record a par-
ticular cost or time charge. For example, if you use the Enter Bills window
(see Chapter 6) to record a bill for a particular job, you use the Customer:Job
column to designate the job.
To charge a customer for costs or time you’ve previously recorded, follow
these steps:
1. Choose Customers➪Create Invoices to open the Create Invoices
window.
2. Change the name in the Customer:Job drop-down list box to the
proper customer.
This step is easy: Activate the drop-down list and choose the appropriate
customer and job.
357
Appendix C: Project Estimating, Billing, and Tracking

3. Click the Time button.
QuickBooks displays the Choose Billable Time and Costs dialog box. The
dialog box already shows the costs and time charges that you’ve previ-
ously assigned to this customer and job combination.
4. Select the billable time and costs that you want to add to the invoice.
Check the time charges and costs you want to bill for. Note that the
Choose Billable Time and Costs dialog box provides different tabs for
Items, Expenses, and Mileage.
5. (Optional, Expenses only) Indicate the markup.
The Expenses tab has a couple of extra fields at the top of the tab 
to indicate the Markup Amount or % and the Markup Account. If 
applicable, fill in the fields with the appropriate information.
6. (Optional) Indicate whether you want the charges to appear as a
single item on the invoice.
If you want to avoid listing the gory details of the charges to your cus-
tomer, click the Print Selected Time and Costs As One Invoice Item
check box located in the bottom-left corner of the invoice to place a
check mark in it.
7. Click OK.
After you have everything the way you want, click OK. As if by magic —
even if it was your hard work and the sweat of your own brow — the
invoice appears.
8. (Optional) Add anything else you want to include on the invoice.
This invoice is a regular QuickBooks Pro invoice, remember? You may
want to click the arrow beside the Print button and choose Preview from
the drop-down list to make sure that only the job costs that you want to
appear do appear.
9. Click Save & New. Or Save & Close.
That’s how you record the invoice.
After you record the invoice, the job costs that have been billed are removed
from the Choose Billable Time and Costs window. You’re finished. Breathe
easier.
Tracking Costs
To see the costs assigned or allocated to a project, use the Project Reports.
You can experiment with the different reports to see which provides the
information in a format and at a level of detail that work best for you. For
more information about this, flip through the pages of Chapter 14.
