About the Author
Nick Trotter is a writer and cartographer. For the past five
years, he has been drawing maps for Frommer’s travel guides
and the For Dummies travel series. A Denver native, he gradu-
ated from the University of Colorado at Boulder with a degree
in geography, and has been perfecting the delicate art of get-
ting lost for a couple of decades. His travel writings have taken
him to Brazil, Italy, and the Caribbean; for now (at least), his
home base is Brooklyn, New York.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to the living memory of David Lee
Bucknam. More than anyone else I know, Dave devoted his life
to being outdoors in Colorado; a member of the old Colorado
Mountain Club, he became an expert mountaineer in his teens,
and formed friendships with other members that lasted his
whole life. One of these friends married him; together, Dave
and Susan had a partnership that, for me, defined the word
marriage. As a teenager, I befriended their son, and the family
virtually adopted me as one of their own, over time taking me
skiing, camping, mountain climbing, and even sailing.
Dave spent most of his working career in the mountains. He
served as an employee, and later head, of the Office of Active
and Inactive Mines for the State of Colorado, a job that took
him all over the state, closing up old, abandoned, dangerous
mines, and making the mountains cleaner and safer for adven-
turers like you and me. And he loved it.
So much of what I know about these mountains, I learned from
Dave; without him, I could not have written this book. As a
devoted husband, father, and grandfather, he will not be for-
gotten. As a great Coloradan, he will be forever remembered;
Everywhere you travel in this state, whether you know it or
not, you will see his legacy.
Author’s Acknowledgments
First, I want to thank clan Bucknam for the myriad ways in
which they helped with the research for this book: to Alan and
Robyn for loaning me their car and their home office; to Peter,
Dave, and Susan for their expertise and their libraries; and to
little Piper and Sophie for loaning me their parents. I also need
to thank Tiffany Shields and Jeff at the Millennium Harvest
House in Boulder, and the staff of the Hinsdale County Museum.
To my editors, Michael Kelly, Caroline Sieg, and Kathleen Dobie,
thanks so much for your guidance, your skillful work, and your
encouragement. Thanks also to my parents and Trina for their
support and patience; finally, a big tip of the ol’ Stetson to Alex
Wells, who laid the groundwork for me in the first edition of
this book.

Introduction
P
hotographs of purple-mountained majesty, roaring rivers, and high
alpine lakes don’t even come close to capturing Colorado’s essence.
To do that, the photos would also have to deliver the sweet pungency of
pine trees after a rainstorm, the coolness of snowflakes on your cheeks,
and the half-rustle, half-rattle of aspen leaves in a fall breeze. They would
have to re-create the weightless sensation that powder skiers experience
between turns and the icy splash of river water on a spring rafting trip.
Then they’d have to dish up a gourmet dinner of native game, a tasty
microbrew, and the real-life smile of a friendly server. That’s asking way
too much of a photograph. And it’s one big reason why you should travel
to Colorado.
Unfortunately, like most things that are really sensational, Colorado
involves a certain element of risk. While you absorb the mountain
beauty, the mountain beauty can absorb you as well. If you’re not care-
ful, you can easily freeze, crash your car, get lost, or get swept away by
snow. There are lesser risks, too: restaurants expensive enough to make
Donald Trump blanch, motels with papier-mâché walls, servers who
incessantly call you “dude,” undersized beers, oversized bears, bad
bands, boring boutiques, and black-and-white color televisions.
Luckily, you’ve done the right thing and bought this book, which can help
you avoid any potential pitfalls that could mar your trip. In these pages,
you’ll find out what you need to know to freely enjoy the majestic moun-
tains, rich history, and diverse cultures of the Rocky Mountain state.
About This Book
Guidebook writers like to think that readers page through their books
from cover to cover as if the books were suspense thrillers or Harlequin
romances. You’re welcome to read Colorado & the Rockies For Dummies
that way; I, for one, would appreciate your perseverance. Be forewarned,
however, that nothing earthshaking will be consummated in the last
chapter.
If you’re pressed for time, you can read only the chapters or sections
that interest you most because the book is set up to read like a reference
book. In fact, the chapters on particular regions and cities are close to
being guidebooks unto themselves. For example, if you plan to travel to
Mesa Verde, you can go straight to Chapter 24. It has the lowdown on
the park, hotel and restaurant recommendations, maps, driving tips,
area attractions, and curious facts that should inspire and delight you.
If Rocky Mountain National Park is your destination, then Chapter 15 is
the place to go.

Other parts of the book provide information that will help you reach
your destination as efficiently as possible. For example, if you need to fly
into Denver and then rent a car to drive to Mesa Verde, go to Chapter 6
for tips on traveling to Colorado. If you want to hit the slopes while
you’re in town, but you aren’t sure when the flakes start flying, see
Chapter 3 for suggestions on Colorado’s seasonal offerings. Still other
chapters offer tips that will make you a better traveler, no matter what
your destination.
In order to make the region and city chapters self-contained, I do repeat
myself some. For example, you’ll find information on the Amtrak train
that passes through Colorado in several destination chapters. I repeat
this information not because of premature senility but because the train
seemed to turn up nearly everywhere I visited. (It was almost creepy.)
Conventions Used in This Book
The hotel and restaurant recommendations in this book are split into two
categories: my personal favorites and other places I feel comfortable rec-
ommending. Don’t hesitate to visit any of the listed establishments. All
are pleasant; the bad places have been relegated to other guidebooks.
Sure, a little personal bias may have crept in to my selections, but I’m def-
initely not as bad as an Olympic figure skating judge. And I do try to clar-
ify my reasoning, so you can factor in your own preferences.
I also provide some pricing information that you can use to help keep
your trip on budget (or not). The number of dollar signs next to a hotel’s
name tells you roughly how much the hotel costs for a one-night stay for
two people; the number of dollar signs next to a restaurant’s name repre-
sents the general range of prices for dinner entrees (or, in some cases,
fixed-price meals). Here’s how to translate the dollar signs.
Dollar Signs

$11 to $20

$126 to $175

Dummies Post-it
® Flags
As you read this book, you may find information that you want to reference as you plan
or enjoy your trip — whether a new hotel, a must-see attraction, or a must-try cross-
country trail. To simplify your trip planning, mark these pages with the handy Post-it
®
Flags included in this book.

After each review, you encounter a host of additional numbers, names,
and abbreviations, which at first glance may seem confusing. These are
how I condense key facts about the establishment. Keep in mind that
phone numbers are listed in bold alongside the telephone icon. I also pro-
vide specific pricing information, but remember that the hotel prices are
usually the rack rates — that is, the double-occupancy rates before any
discounts are given — for particular periods. (Remember: By using the
tips in Chapter 8, you can often avoid paying the rack rate.) Unless other-
wise noted, restaurant prices reflect the price range for dinner entrees.
I also use abbreviations for the credit cards accepted by the establish-
ments I review in this book. I only kept track of the majors, so if your
particular card isn’t listed here, it may or may not be accepted. The
abbreviations, and the credit cards represented by them, are as follows:
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
DISC: Discover
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
Compared to more densely populated states, Colorado doesn’t have many
highways. But the ones it does have are important, and they can some-
times be confusing. It’s important to remember that highways are built by
federal, state, and local governments, all of which have their own number-
ing and naming systems, and the interstates are another matter entirely.
When reading a map or list of directions, make sure that you keep track of
which roads are part of which system. If you’re getting directions from a
local Coloradan, you’re likely to just get numbers: “Goin’ up to Leadville,
are ya? Well, take 70 to Frisco and get off on 91. Take that up to Leadville.
Or you can take 285 to where it hits 24 and head north.” In order, that’s
Interstate 70 to Colorado Highway 94, or U.S. Highways 285 and 24. In this
book, I try to keep things simple and clear by referring to highways in the
same format, such as I-70, Colorado 91, and U.S. 285.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I made some assumptions about you and what you
may need from a Colorado guidebook:
 You may be a traveler who is new to Colorado, and you’re trying to
determine what to see and when to see it.
 You may have traveled through Colorado in the past, but now you
have less time and want insider information that can help you plan
the most efficient trip possible. Or you want to plan an adventure
or two instead of just driving around looking at mountains.
Introduction
3

 You don’t want a book that lists every restaurant, bar, hotel, and
attraction, no matter how bad. You just want accurate descriptions
of the best places within a variety of price ranges.
If any of my foolish assumptions prove to be, in your case, not so fool-
ish, you’ll benefit from reading Colorado & the Rockies For Dummies.
How This Book Is Organized
In order to make this book more useful as a reference guide, I broke it
into six logical sections, each one discussing a different aspect of your
Colorado trip. Each part is further divided into a handful of easy-to-read
chapters. If a particular subject doesn’t interest you, skip it and go
straight to the chapter that has the information you need. You won’t fail
Colorado Vacation 101 just because you don’t read the whole book. I’m
too lazy to write an exam.
Part I: Introducing Colorado
This section identifies the state’s treasures — both artificial and natural.
It sums up the most interesting regions — from the red-rock canyons
of the Four Corners area to the 14,000-foot summits of the southern
Rockies — and then digs a little deeper into the history and culture
behind the state. And it tells you the best times to go to the area of your
choice. I also propose some itineraries, including ones for history buffs,
for adventure-seekers, and for people traveling with children.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Colorado
If you have a question about trip-planning, this section more than answers
it. Here you find tips on how to reach Colorado by plane, train, or automo-
bile and advice on how to get around Colorado after you cross the state
line. I also discuss the various accommodations choices in Colorado. You
can discover when and why to choose different payment methods while
traveling, and what to do when your wallet goes skittering down a moun-
tainside (or is otherwise compromised), taking all those payment meth-
ods with it. I tell you which tickets and reservations you need to arrange
in advance of your trip, and then share information on how to do it. And I
offer Colorado-specific travel tips for those with special travel needs or
interests, including families, seniors, people with disabilities, and gays
and lesbians. There are even a few pointers on packing. By the time you
finish Part II, you’ll be ready to hit the road.
Part III: The Front Range
This part introduces you to the area of the state you’re most likely to
encounter first: the Front Range. The name itself has kind of a double
meaning to Coloradans, which can be a little confusing: specifically, it
refers to the easternmost mountains in the state, stretching from the
Colorado & the Rockies For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
4

Arkansas canyon in the south across the Wyoming border up north,
incorporating the smaller spurs of the Medicine Bow range east of North
Park, and the Rampart Range west of Colorado Springs, which includes
Pikes Peak. Coloradans, though, also use the term Front Range to refer to
the urban corridor that now stretches in front of those mountains from
Pueblo to Fort Collins, including Colorado Springs, Denver, Boulder,
Longmont, and all the old farm-towns-turned-suburbs in between. I direct
you to the most exciting experiences and recommend the finest restau-
rants, the cushiest accommodations, the spiciest nightclubs, the most
intriguing neighborhoods, and the best side trips through the region.
Part IV: The High Country
This region is what you probably think of first when you think of
Colorado: towering peaks, thick forests of pine and aspen, and wild
rivers tumbling through steep, rocky canyons — and oh, yeah . . . lots of
skiing! The rivers and glaciers have done a great job of neatly carving
the region into valleys and ranges; these are dotted with small mountain
towns (including some of Colorado’s best ski spots) and open country-
side. For each area I cover, I tell you how to get there and get around,
and where to stay, play, party, shop, and eat.
Part V: The Western Slope and Southern Colorado
This vast swath of land that circles the High Country is some of the most
pristine, beautiful country in the state, graced with smaller surprises
such as hot springs, desert canyons, sand dunes, relaxed towns, and
ancient Indian dwellings. In this part, I do everything possible to make
sure you don’t speed past the area’s hidden wonders. And, of course, I
also tell you where to stay and eat along the way.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is, in reality, far more lighthearted than its ominous-
sounding title. Each chapter in this fun section showcases a roster of
related items, much like one of David Letterman’s top ten lists — only, in
this case, each list pertains to Colorado, and I’m not half as funny.
Quick Concierge
Imagine a helpful concierge who is an all-around Colorado expert and
has the recall of an elephant. The Quick Concierge section on the yellow
pages at the back of this book is as close as you’ll come to finding that
person. It distills key information on subjects ranging from the American
Automobile Association to weather. It also has contact numbers and
Web sites for major airlines, rental car agencies, and hotel chains; and it
lists several outstanding sources for finding more information on current
happenings in Colorado.

Icons Used in This Book
I use six different icons in this book to call your attention to different
types of information. Here’s what each means:
Find out useful advice on things to do and ways to schedule your time
when you see the Tip icon.
Best of the Best highlights the best the destination has to offer in all 
categories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, and
nightlife.
Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, budgetary
rip-offs, and other things to beware.
Look to the Kid Friendly icon for attractions, hotels, restaurants, and
activities that are particularly hospitable to children or people traveling
with kids.
Keep an eye out for the Bargain Alert icon as you seek out money-saving
tips and/or great deals.
Colorado is filled with magnificent scenery, and this icon highlights par-
ticularly noteworthy spots that showcase the state’s natural beauty.
Where to Go from Here
Unlike most states, Colorado sprawls both horizontally and vertically. It
has 58 14,000-foot peaks (known as fourteeners), more than any other
state, not to mention grasslands, red-rock canyons, and high-desert
mesas. This means your travels will involve not only significant dis-
tances, but also some major twists and turns. The beauty comes at you
from a variety of angles, and there’s never enough time to absorb it all.
Nor is there time to experience all the activities that go with this turf —
everything from hot springs to hiking.
You can smooth out your trip by considering ahead of time what attracts
you most in Colorado, and then planning a trip around your interests.
That way, fewer distractions come into play, and you’ll be able to con-
centrate on the magnificence of your surroundings. Be sure, however,
to leave a few things to chance! Ideally, this book can help you straddle
the divide between practicality and spontaneity; between security and
adventure; and between a warm car and the call of the wild. So saddle
up or strap on those skis and keep reading!

Part I
Introducing
Colorado

In this part . . . 
S
o, you’re thinking about visiting Colorado, but you aren’t
really sure where to start. Don’t worry! This part intro-
duces you to the state and all it can offer. After discussing the
very best things in the state, it gives history and background
information, weighs the pros and cons of coming at different
times, and provides four great itineraries that help you make
the most of your time.

Chapter 1
Discovering the 
Best of Colorado
In This Chapter
 Finding adventures in the Old and New West
 Choosing the finest hotels and restaurants
 Hitting the best slopes
 Singing the praises of little towns
 Appreciating Mother Nature
C
olorado’s vertical landscape — the mountains, and their location
between the High Plains and the Great Basin desert — gives the
state an incredible range of environments. Lush pine forests, stark alpine
tundra, arid plateaus, and the cycle between gentle summers and snowy
winters make for a dizzying array of activities. Add in a major metropoli-
tan area, smaller towns ranging from the comfortably urban to the down-
right tiny, and you’ll find that Colorado has quite a lot to keep you busy,
whether you’re seeking urbane luxury, a real back-country adventure, or
something in between.
This chapter outlines a few key categories of things to do in the state,
and shows you the possibilities for finding the best of each. Throughout
the book, you’ll see the “best of the best” icon next to these features and
activities. Stick with these, folks, and you won’t go wrong.
The Best Outdoor Adventures
Whether on rock, on water, or on snow, Colorado positively brims with
opportunities for you to enjoy its great outdoors. This section details
the best of the best outdoors that doesn’t involve downhill skiing —
for that, refer to “The Best Ski Areas,” later in this chapter.
 For rock climbing, Boulder (see Chapter 13) and its granite canyons
(and indoor climbing gyms) are world-renowned. If you’re an expert
looking for a classic climb, go for the Diamond on Longs Peak in
Rocky Mountain National Park.

 Whitewater rafting is at its finest on the Upper Arkansas River
near Buena Vista and Salida (Chapter 18). This is premier rafting
territory for beginner and expert alike.
 Fly fishing for trout doesn’t get any better than the Gold Medal
Waters of the Roaring Fork and Frying Pan rivers (Chapter 20).
Anglers should head to the Taylor Creek Fly Shop in Basalt for
everything from flies and gear to tips or guided trips.
 Crested Butte (Chapter 22) and Fruita (Chapter 23) offer the best
mountain biking. The Western Slope in general has great desert
and mountain terrain, but these two towns have the best trail sys-
tems and fat-tire scenes for serious enthusiasts and novices alike.
 Cross-country skiers and snowshoers will be happy anywhere in
the state, but Middle Park (Chapter 16) has the best terrain, and
the area, except for Winter Park and Fraser, is largely undiscovered.
The Best Old (And New) West Experiences
From prospectors to ranchers and so much in between, Colorado has
drawn the best and the brightest (as well as its share of the not-so-bright)
citizens looking to prosper from the promise of the West. Much that
remains from this era is available for viewing and exploring today.
 The whole town of Leadville (Chapter 18) is a gold mine —
literally — for mining history and lore. A visit to the Matchless
Mine tour is a must, and the National Mining Hall of Fame
and Museum is a fascinating trip into the past of this incredible
industry.
 The Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad (Chapter 24) is
the most fun way to experience the most spectacular part of the
state, and to visit the great small towns of Durango and Silverton
to boot.
 For a working ranch experience, don’t miss Saddleback Ranch in
Steamboat Springs (Chapter 21). Ride with the cowboys and eat
ranch-style dinners in the beautiful high-range country of the
Yampa Valley.
 The New West lives on (and parties hard) at the National Western
Stock Show & Rodeo in Denver (Chapter 11). Check out the
national-circuit pro rodeo, exotic livestock exhibits, a ranch equip-
ment exposition, and great music as cowboys and ranchers descend
to Denver every January for this trade show and winter party.
The Best Ski Areas
Skiing is what most people think of when they think of Colorado, though
as this chapter alone shows, there’s way more going on here than just
Part I: Introducing Colorado 
10

skiing. But for those of you who really want the champagne powder
experience, here are the areas I recommend:
 The best all-around skiing is in Aspen and the surrounding areas
(Chapter 20). Aspen Highlands and Aspen Mountain are great
for experts, while Snowmass is ideal for intermediate skiers, and
Buttermilk is perfect for beginners (even the Swiss rave about this
place!). And the town itself is a Colorado classic. The downside,
of course, is that it’s expensive. But a ski vacation in Aspen is one
you’ll never forget.
 For more moderate budgets, head for Winter Park (Chapter 16).
Winter Park offers great skiing for a moderate price; the snow is
great until late in the season, and the adjacent Mary Jane area
offers more challenging slopes for the mogul-hungry. Skiing Winter
Park is easily doable as a day trip from Denver, especially if you
ride the Ski Train — another classic Colorado experience.
 Families will love Keystone (Chapter 17) for its great instructional
slopes and family-friendly atmosphere. This is where I and most of
my friends learned to ski, and it’s perfect. You can do it as a day
trip from Denver, but the resort also has all-inclusive options for
accommodations and dining that make it a no-brainer for a family
trip. And since transportation in Summit County is so good, more
experienced skiers can make easy excursions to Copper Mountain
or Arapahoe Basin.
 Extreme skiers can head straight for Crested Butte (Chapter 22) or
Silverton (Chapter 24). These high-mountain towns are harder to
get to, but if you dream of super-steep terrain, these areas are a
dream come true.
The Best Luxury Hotels
To treat yourself to the most luxurious of luxury accommodations during
your Colorado vacation, these four choices are a good place to start:
 The Broadmoor in Colorado Springs (Chapter 14) has it all, from a
grand tradition as a luxury destination to world-class golf on any of
three 18-hole courses. The enormous property features hiking, a
spa, and easy access to Pikes Peak and the rest of the Rampart
Range.
 Denver’s Brown Palace (Chapter 11) is where the Beatles stayed,
don’t you know — also presidents, movie stars, and visiting royalty.
The hotel serves an English high tea in the afternoon, and the
downtown location puts you near everything that’s great about
Denver — restaurants, entertainment, museums, and parks.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Colorado 11

 The Little Nell in Aspen (Chapter 20) offers an intimate experience
with all the lavish amenities of a world-class ski town such as Aspen.
This is where Hollywood moguls come to crash in style.
 You’ll think you’re in Europe at Sonnenalp in Vail (Chapter 19). This
classy but low-key place is the best place to pamper yourself in
this, Colorado’s other world-class resort town.
The Best Restaurants
Colorado has gone a long way towards forging a culinary identity for itself;
the local cuisine focuses on buffalo and game, with a strong Southwestern
influence and some international flair. But you find all the great styles
here, from Tuscan to Cuban to Szechuan. And with fish flown in daily from
the coasts, the sushi ain’t half bad, either.
 If you’re staying in Denver, a trip to The Fort or the Buckhorn
Exchange (Chapter 11) is a must. These excellent restaurants are
the best places to experience buffalo in all its glory, as well as appe-
tizers such as rattlesnake and Rocky Mountain oysters. The Fort is
definitely a fine-dining experience, while the Buckhorn is a little
more laid-back. Both function as Old West museums as much as
restaurants; either one will satisfy you.
 In Aspen, Cache Cache (Chapter 20) has been serving up fine French
cuisine with a Rocky Mountain attitude for years. The preparations
are outstanding, the presentations are gorgeous, and the portions
are hearty. You won’t be disappointed. The bar menu offers many of
the same dishes for folks on a budget. Don’t miss it if you’re in Glitter
Gulch.
 The Shed in Winter Park (Chapter 16) offers wonderful food in a
great après-ski atmosphere. The menu changes often, and it’s very
popular with the locals.
 Beau Jo’s in Idaho Springs (Chapter 12) is the all-time classic après-
ski pizza joint for Front Range residents. The huge pizzas and origi-
nal recipes are just the ticket after a long day on the slopes (or
hiking, snowshoeing, rafting, rock climbing, shopping, or even just
sitting around!).
The Best Small Towns
Colorado is more than metropolises and ski resorts. Check out one (or
more) of these quaint little towns for a taste of small-town Colorado:
 If you’re not on a budget, Telluride (Chapter 24) is a fantastic
place, winter or summer, for an exciting small-town sojourn. The
restaurants are outstanding, the nightlife is spectacular, and local
Part I: Introducing Colorado 
12

festivals appeal to every interest and temperament — the biggest
being the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, which is held each year in
June.
 Grand Lake, in Middle Park but very close to Rocky Mountain
National Park (Chapter 15), is a very relaxed little place with com-
fortable lodging, good restaurants, and a number of activities. The
town is ideal as a base for excursions into the park, and boating,
hiking, fishing, and snowshoeing or cross-country skiing are also
within easy reach.
 Salida (Chapter 18) offers great opportunities for rafting on the
Arkansas, as well as a vibrant art scene and access to great skiing,
hiking, and even the Great Sand Dunes (Chapter 25).
The Best Accommodations for Families
Traveling with the family shouldn’t be a chore. For some hotels that “get
it,” consider the following:
 The Embassy Suites Downtown Denver (Chapter 11) is clean,
friendly, and casual, and the kids will dig the in-room Nintendo
games. All the rooms are suites, too, so you won’t have to hear all
that digital chaos.
 Families wanting an all-inclusive resort, winter or summer, that’s
both affordable and top-notch, will love Snow Mountain Ranch in
Middle Park (Chapter 16). It’s a YMCA facility that’s expertly run
and offers numerous options for outdoor adventures, including
excellent skiing at Winter Park and Mary Jane.
 For a hotel that’s practically a history lesson in itself (in a spec-
tacular part of the state), check out the Strater Hotel in Durango
(Chapter 24). The staff dresses in high silver-boom fashion, and
the building itself is meticulously preserved. The proximity to the
Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad and Mesa Verde
National Park make this a great family opportunity.
The Best Natural Wonders 
for Kids of All Ages
If your idea of a good, outdoor vacation is looking at stuff that makes
you grab your head and go, “gee whiz!” here are a few can’t-miss parts of
the state that will definitely do the trick:
 The Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve in the San Luis
Valley (Chapter 25) is one of my all-time favorite places in the state.
The visitor center is very informative, kids will be entertained play-
ing in the creek next to the dunes, and the dunes themselves, nestled
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Colorado 13

up against the towering Sangre de Cristo range, are truly awesome.
Unless you’re from southern Saudi Arabia, you’ll be impressed.
 The Black Canyon of the Gunnison (Chapter 22) is a ponderous
gap in the Earth that will knock your socks off. The powerful
Gunnison River, aided only by gravity, has carved such a deep,
narrow channel through the sandstone that sunlight rarely reaches
the bottom — hence the darkness implied by the name.
 Okay, it’s not a geological feature, but Mesa Verde National Park
(Chapter 24) is certainly one of the wonders of human nature.
These ruins of the ingenious Puebloan civilization are one of the
state’s top draws, and for good reason. The fascinating artifacts
and the history they represent are a great testament to the human
spirit and a vital link to Colorado’s past — with lessons for its
future as well.
 The Rockies, of course, are the main draw. For the most spectacular
views of peaks, check out at least one of these sights: the drive over
Trail Ridge Road in Rocky Mountain National Park (Chapter 15); the
Collegiate Peaks near Buena Vista, and the drive over Independence
Pass to Aspen (Chapters 18 and 20); or the drive to the top of Pikes
Peak or Mt. Evans. A great one-hour diversion in Vail is the Gondola
ride to the incredible view of the Mount of the Holy Cross.

Digging Deeper 
into Colorado
In This Chapter
 Perusing a brief history of the Centennial State
 Sampling the local cuisine
 Wrapping your mind around essential reading and maps
A
visit to Colorado is sure to satisfy the most ardent naturalist, chal-
lenge the most active skier, or sate the most adventurous diner
(and drinker), but there’s more to this country than meets the eye. To
give you a glimpse of the land underneath all the exciting activities, this
chapter mines this state’s historical and cultural landscape.
History 101: The Main Events
There have been people living in this region for thousands of years, but
most of what we consider to be “Colorado” has a very recent history.
The first civilization within the present state’s boundary was that of the
Ancestral Puebloans. Before them, hunters and gatherers roamed the
deserts, mountains, and plains, but the Puebloans built the first perma-
nent settlements and developed the building material adobe, still in use
today throughout the American Southwest. They also were excellent
hydrological engineers and astounding artists whose homes, life, and
culture you can explore at Mesa Verde National Park (Chapter 24).
Their civilization here faded, though, probably due to environmental
causes such as drought, and they migrated southward to found the
modern-day Pueblos of Acoma, Zuni, and Hopi.
This left the state once again to the hunters and gatherers; in the last
few centuries, the predominant tribes have been the Ute in the moun-
tains and Western Slope, and the Cheyenne, Arapahoe, and Comanche
on the Eastern Plains and foothills. The Cheyenne and Arapahoe are
Northern Plains Indians with cultural ties to the Sioux; the Comanche
migrated south from Wyoming, settling between the Arkansas and Platte

rivers on the high plains. The Navajo, after they settled northern New
Mexico 500 years ago, ventured sometimes into the San Luis Valley.
The first Europeans in the area were the Spanish; Coronado led the first
known expedition through the southern part of the state in 1541 and 1542,
and later Spanish settlers called this part of New Spain El Norte. In fact,
many of the families living in the San Luis Valley still live on land granted
to their ancestors by the king of Spain! The king lost the territory, though,
to Mexican Independence in 1821. Eastern and northern Colorado,
though, had been claimed by France and became part of the United States
with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Zebulon Pike explored the southern
part of the Purchase in 1806, and you can see the peak named after him
near Colorado Springs from 90 miles away on the plains! For a few
decades more, though, the Indians still ruled outside the San Luis Valley.
Gold was discovered, in Cherry Creek near Denver and in Cripple Creek
west of Pikes Peak, in 1858, and the Gold Rush of 1859 started the fol-
lowing spring, with many hopeful prospectors crossing the plains of
Kansas Territory with the banner “Pikes Peak or Bust!” painted on
their covered wagons (many were to return, however, with the slogan,
“Busted, by God!”). The Gold Rush, of course, was short-lived, and little
happened in the state until silver was discovered higher in the moun-
tains in the early 1870s. The ensuing Silver Boom lasted 20 years and
built most of the wrecked mining equipment you can see across the state
to this day. It also cemented Colorado’s economy into the boom-and-bust
cycle of commodities that continues to this day. The Silver Boom was fol-
lowed by booms in other minerals such as molybdenum, uranium (in the
1940s) and oil (in the ’70s and early ’80s.) But it was silver that built the
towns of Leadville (once by far the largest city in the state), Aspen,
Breckenridge, and Telluride. The pressure of mining and settlement,
though, brought conflict with the territory’s earliest residents. In 1864, a
group of Colorado Volunteers, under the auspices of the Union Army,
attacked a sleeping camp of Cheyenne and Arapaho along Sand Creek in
eastern Colorado; this shameful event has become known as the Sand
Creek Massacre and was the decisive blow in driving the Plains Indians
out of the territory. Around the same time, a Union officer named Kit
Carson was pursuing a genocidal campaign against the Navajo in the
southern part of the territory, eventually driving them into southern New
Mexico, before a reservation was established around the Four Corners
area. Up in the mountains, a bloody war between the Utes and white set-
tlers took place in the 1870s, ending only with the careful diplomacy of
Ute Chief Ouray and the establishment of two small Ute reservations
along the New Mexico border. Colorado was made a state in 1876.
Between the booms and busts, farmers and ranchers settled in and eked
out their living, though the arid climate and rugged land make it hard.
The agricultural industry as a whole still survives here, but family farms
and ranches are mostly a thing of the past, unable to compete with cor-
porations and the cheaper land and labor of South America and Asia.
Colorado has been a destination for the health-conscious from the start,
as the arid climate was deemed ideal for curing tuberculosis and asthma;
Part I: Introducing Colorado

Denver grew prosperous, oddly, as a location for sanatoriums for those
afflicted with those types of respiratory diseases. The lungers who were
treated there often settled in the new streetcar suburbs that grew up
around the warehouses and smelters downtown. Boulder, an old mine
camp and farm community, advertised itself as a spa, where one could
drink the supposedly pure waters of the Indian Peaks glaciers; you can
see signs touting this attraction in the Boulderado Hotel to this day.
After World War II, veterans of the Army 10th Mountain Division who
had trained in the Rockies founded the ski resort at Aspen, and Colorado
found new life as a tourist destination. Athletes and health-nuts continue
to make up a huge part of the state’s population. World War II also saw
the coming of the military-industrial complex, largely focused around
Colorado Springs, with the U.S. Air Force Academy, two large military
bases, and a number of defense-technology contractors overtaking what
had been a tiny resort community. The Cold War between the United
States and the Soviet Union from the 1940s through the 1980s added
NORAD under Cheyenne Mountain and led to a uranium-mining boom,
which devastated large tracts of land with immensely destructive mining
techniques and underground nuclear weapons testing.
After the oil market crashed in the mid-1980s, Colorado went through
a recession that affected the whole state; it ended with the high-tech
boom of the 1990s, when software and telecommunications brought a
massive new population to the Front Range (metropolitan areas of
Denver, and Colorado Springs). This seems to have stabilized the econ-
omy a bit, as Denver has been pushed over the hump into its present
status as a major American urban community. The leisure class has set-
tled deep into the mountains, particularly the valleys around Vail; and
Grand Junction could be the suburb of the telecommuting age. As the
21st century gets underway, it’s fascinating to see how Colorado contin-
ues to change and grow.
Taste of Colorado: Local Cuisine
Colorado’s chefs used to look to the coasts for inspiration and direction,
but no more. In the last couple of decades, Colorado has been in the
forefront of a revolution in American cuisine emphasizing local foods,
grown and served according to their natural seasons and geography.
Like their counterparts elsewhere, Colorado chefs began looking to
the land, its history, and the local cultures to design their menus. The
rugged landscape and the state’s roots in the Old West led directly to
what the new cuisine features above all else: wild game. In many of
Colorado’s finest restaurants, you find elk, rabbit, native trout, quail,
venison, and the ubiquitous buffalo (more properly known as American
bison). I think you’ll find these flavorful meats a welcome respite from
the increasingly tired and bland commercially raised beef, pork, and
chicken. This being the modern world, of course, most of these game
species are raised on ranches (not hunted), but without centuries of
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Colorado 17

breeding, they retain the savory character that evokes 19th-century 
pioneers cooking over an open fire. Grilling is, naturally, the preferred
method for cooking game.
The proximity of Mexico, New Mexico, and Arizona has had an influence
on the Colorado chefs also, though I wouldn’t characterize most of the
food here as Southwestern. You do find the corn, beans, and squash
that are the traditional staples of the Pueblo and Navajo nations, and
Coloradans put chile peppers in darn near everything, from fruit sauces
for game meats to even (incredibly) the beer.
Beer itself is another major aspect of dining in Colorado, as microbrew-
eries and brewpubs are ubiquitous — indeed, I dedicate a whole chapter
to the subject at the end of the book (see Chapter 27)!
The Southwestern influence isn’t just restricted to haute cuisine, either;
most diners here serve breakfast burritos and chile verde (a spicy sauce
made with green chiles). For a great breakfast anywhere in the state, you
can order huevos rancheros and get a big plate of eggs smothered with
Part I: Introducing Colorado 
18
What do you mean, the chili is green?!?!
It’s time to discuss one of the most confusing (and wonderful) aspects of the local cui-
sine: In Colorado and New Mexico, chili comes in two colors, red and green. You’ll
also find that “chili” is most often spelled “chile” (from the Spanish), though the pro-
nunciation is the same.
Red chile is what you’re probably used to just calling “chili.” It’s ground beef, maybe
with beans, in a thick, tomato-based stew and served in a bowl, like soup, or on hot
dogs. No big surprise here.
The green stuff, though, is what you really should look for: It’s a pork stew with green
chiles (usually a combination of Hatches or Anaheims and jalapeños — peppers, that
is) — and you’ll find it on burgers and steaks, smothered over burritos or rellenos,
served as a soup with tortillas on the side, in vegetarian versions, and in just about
any other situation you can think of. It’s been a staple in this part of the world for cen-
turies; everyone’s grandmother has a unique recipe, and it’s the real hallmark of New
Mexican and southern Coloradan cooking. One point will ignite furious debate:
Coloradans are known (and ridiculed by New Mexicans) for putting tomatoes in their
chile verde. I’ve always liked the tomatoes, but I’m from Colorado, so maybe I just don’t
know any better. You can find it, both with tomatoes and without, everywhere in
Denver, from greasy-spoon diners to steakhouses.
At various points along the boulevards of Denver and the highways of the state, you
see roadside vendors advertising Hatch chiles; these are the large, mild Anaheim-
style chiles grown near Hatch, New Mexico, which is to chiles what Napa Valley is to
grapes. They sell them fresh, by the pound or even the bushel, and it can be worthwhile
to stop and get some if you have access to a kitchen. You can roast them or freeze
them fresh, and eat them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Good stuff.

chile verde and served with flour tortillas on the side. To eat it like the
locals do, tear off pieces of the tortilla and pinch them around the eggs
and chile with your fingers.
Among the many restaurants that exemplify this new Colorado cuisine
are The Fort and the Buckhorn Exchange, both in the Denver area; the
Craftwood Inn and the restaurants of the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado
Springs; E. G.’s Country Inn in Grand Lake; and the restaurants at the
Hotel Jerome in Aspen.
Wine aficionados will want to check out the burgeoning Colorado wine
industry; the town of Palisade in the arid Western Slope, in particular, is
turning out some fine wines. One wine expert I spoke to points out that
the industry here is very young, and the terroir hasn’t been fully explored
yet; vintners are still figuring out which grape varieties grow best here.
You can find some good wines at decent prices, but if you’re looking for a
stateside version of Tuscany, you may be somewhat disappointed. Do try
the beer, though.
Background Check: Recommended 
Books and Movies
You can find out more about Colorado’s history in Colorado: A History, by
Marshall Sprague, published by W. W. Norton & Company. A Lady’s Life in
the Rocky Mountains, by Isabella Bird, is one of the classics of Old West
history. Bird was the first white woman to climb Longs Peak, and her
adventures are first rate. James Michener fans will love Centennial, a novel
that offers a literary look at the history of Colorado, centering around the
fictional town of Centennial — at least it was fictional at the time of the
novel’s publication in 1974. In 2001, a far-flung southeast suburb of Denver
incorporated as the city of Centennial; it has no relation to the novel. For
more recent history, Hunter S. Thompson’s account of his 1970 bid for
sheriff of Aspen in Fear and Loathing in America is a hilarious classic. Rest
in peace, Hunter.
For fiction buffs, Jack Kerouac’s account of his journey to Colorado in On
the Road, of course, is a must for beatniks and aspiring Boulderites. The
novel Angle of Repose, a story of westward migration that prominently fea-
tures 19th-century Colorado, won Wallace Stegner a Pulitzer Prize in 1971.
And horror fans need look no further than Stephen King’s The Stand set 
in Boulder, and The Shining, inspired by the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park.
If you’re interested in roadside geology (but don’t want to spend a
few years in Boulder getting a degree, like I did), pick up a copy of
Messages in Stone: Colorado’s Colorful Geology, written and published
by the Colorado Geological Survey. It’s available in many of the visitor
centers in the National Parks, or you can order it directly from the
Survey at http://dnr.state.co.us/geostore/. It’s extremely well
done, with large color photos on every page, excellent digital maps, and
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Colorado 19

clear descriptions of the geology you’ll see — and you don’t need an
advanced degree to read it. It’s truly outstanding.
Travelers who want to see wildlife will love the Colorado Wildlife Viewing
Guide, by Mary Taylor Gray, published by Falcon. Serious anglers should
check out the Flyfisher’s Guide to Colorado by Marty Bartholomew
(Wilderness Adventures Press) for outstanding info on all the rivers and
seasons, and strategies for catching trout. Lastly, anyone planning to
spend serious time in Rocky Mountain National Park should get a copy
of Frommer’s Rocky Mountain National Park, a must for really in-depth
exploring.
Movie buffs also have a lot to choose from. Colorado has a starring role
in City Slickers, starring Billy Crystal as an Easterner trying to find his
smile and a memorable Jack Palance as his dude-ranch guide. The early
Woody Allen–classic Sleeper was filmed in Colorado: Try to spot the
scenes shot at the Denver Botanic Gardens, the National Center for
Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, and the “flying saucer house”
visible from I-70 in Genesee Park, just west of Denver.
Old Western fans will like Gunfight at the OK Corral — granted, the
movie takes place in Arizona, but the antihero Doc Holliday is buried in
Glenwood Springs. Look back on the Cold War and laugh (or shudder)
with War Games, an early Matthew Broderick movie about a young
hacker who taps into the Department of Defense computers at NORAD
in Colorado Springs.
For romance fans, the great actress Kathy Bates gives a not-too-flattering
portrayal of Denver native Molly Brown in Titanic. And last but certainly
not least, you’ll learn almost nothing about Colorado from South Park,
the wildly irreverent animated show on Comedy Central, but you’ll prob-
ably have a lot of fun. There is no actual town of South Park, though
there is a large and beautiful valley by that name along U.S. 285; the
show’s creators went to Columbine High School in the southern suburbs
of Denver, and the show’s skewed take on life more closely reflects those
claustrophobic suburbs than any mountain town.

The essential atlas
The Colorado Atlas & Gazetteer, published by DeLorme and available in most book-
stores in the state, is absolutely essential for anyone who wants to venture even a
little way off the beaten path. Featuring topographic maps that cover the whole state,
this atlas shows every road and most of the trails, as well as National Forests and
other public lands. The front of the atlas has an exhaustive listing of great hiking, camp-
ing, biking, scenic drives, and other activities that will be a great companion to any
travels in the state. In addition to being a travel writer, I’m a cartographer, and I carry
this atlas wherever I go; you’ll probably want one for your home state, too.

Chapter 3
Deciding When and 
Where to Go
In This Chapter
 Choosing where to go
 Budgeting your time
 Understanding mountain weather
 Catching the best events on the calendar
O
nce you choose to visit Colorado, your next major decision involves
determining when and where to go. In this chapter, I introduce you
to the top cities and the most tourist-friendly regions of the state, and I
explain the pros and cons of traveling here at different times of year. I
break down the weather by location and season and even provide a cal-
endar of major Colorado events. Mind you, this isn’t the part where I
really dissect the destinations — you have to check out Chapters 11
through 25 for specific information on Colorado’s most popular places.
Going Everywhere You Want to Be
I have a confession to make: Not every place in Colorado is covered in
this book. To cover every nook and cranny of Colorado, this book would
need to be 20 times larger, and I’d need a stronger pair of legs, a new car,
a bigger paycheck, and a transplanted liver.
I don’t even cover every single great spot. The state is big — it holds a life-
time’s worth of secrets. Dozens of canyons and side canyons are etched
into every vast mountainside, and every side canyon has a dozen more
little hiding places that somebody somewhere dearly loves. Unfortunately,
you may have only a week or two to see the state, so I boil down the best
Colorado has to offer visitors with a limited amount of time on their
hands. That means you won’t read about the Great Plains of eastern
Colorado, or the ranges of northwestern Colorado. There’s just not that
much going on out there.
The places I do cover are the top cities (the Front Range) and the other
major tourist regions in the state (see the nearby “Colorado” map).

Chapter 3: Deciding When and Where to Go 23

Within these locations, I fill you in on the best attractions to see and
activities to do so that you don’t waste a minute of your time going any-
where unworthy of your attention.
Traveling the Front Range
The term Front Range refers to both the easternmost mountains in the
state and the corridor of urban communities that stretches along the
prairie in front of those same mountains from Fort Collins to Pueblo,
including Boulder, Denver, Colorado Springs, and Cañon City. More than
half of the state’s 4.3 million people live in the Denver metropolitan area;
Colorado Springs is the next largest city, but compared to Denver, parts
of Colorado Springs feel like a sleepy little resort, and Boulder feels posi-
tively tiny.
Denver
Denver has a thriving downtown and all the entertainment you expect
of a major city. It’s a major American city, complete with major-league
sports and sometimes major-league traffic jams. Everything else is
major-league, too, from the restaurants to the cultural events and the
nightlife. The town has a youngish, active, healthy population. When
these people aren’t off enjoying the nearby mountains, they’re eating
out, shopping, or cheering on their favorite pro team. The city is easy
to tour — many major attractions are within a mile of each other down-
town, making it a good place for sightseeing. And the mountains start
only about 6 miles west of town. I cover all the ins and outs of Denver,
including some really cool side trips, in Chapters 11 and 12.
Boulder
Boulder is a vibrant community of high-tech health nuts and university
students, situated at the base of the Flatirons in one of the most strik-
ingly beautiful piedmont valleys in the state. Being a university town
(the University of Colorado is here), great cultural and sporting events
always seem to be on tap, and you can find awesome hiking, biking, and
rock-climbing in the canyons just outside of town. More details about
Boulder are in Chapter 13.
Colorado Springs
With a population of 350,000, Colorado Springs has taken over Denver’s
former reputation as a cow town that’s a little big for its britches. The
downtown area has spacious boulevards and a low skyline. A few miles
west of downtown, the resort community of Manitou Springs snuggles
against the base of Pikes Peak. Because these towns have catered to
tourists for over a century, they have a host of road-tested, family-friendly
attractions, not to mention historic hotels such as the Broadmoor and the
Cliff House. And Cañon City and the Royal Gorge aren’t far away. For in-
depth information on Colorado Springs, turn to Chapter 14.

Going beyond the Front Range: The High Country
All the regions I cover in this book offer stunning scenery and lively towns.
If you decide to go the regional route on your vacation, your best bet is to
select one or two adjacent valleys or ranges (see the “Colorado” map ear-
lier in this chapter to find out what’s where) and spend a week there. If
you have more time, you can then branch out and see more of the state.
Rocky Mountain National Park
Colorado’s most popular national park makes seeing the mountains
easy. Located within a few hours’ drive of Denver, Rocky Mountain
National Park is traversed by Trail Ridge Road, which goes up and over
the tree line, cresting at over 12,000 feet. After a day spent hiking some
of the 300 miles of trails, camp inside the park or retreat to one of the
gateway communities of Estes Park, Grand Lake, or Granby. I cover
everything you need to know about the park in Chapter 15.
The Parklands and Summit County
This group of valleys just behind the Front Range is famous for its fishing,
cross-country skiing, and rafting, and this is also where the downhill skiing
and snowboarding gets really good. Middle Park (Chapter 16) and the
Upper Arkansas Valley (Chapter 18) have cool towns with activities for all
seasons, while Summit County (Chapter 17) is all about skiing and board-
ing. Leadville (Chapter 18) is in a class of its own; once the capital of the
Silver Boom, it’s now a treasure trove of history and lore. Downstream of
Leadville, in a valley warmed by southerly winds, is the artsy, mellow
town of Salida and the great rafting territory near Buena Vista.
The high valleys: Vail, Aspen and the 
Roaring Fork, and Steamboat Springs
This area is home to the best skiing on Earth (and I’m not just boasting —
Swiss skiers have told me that), but there’s so much to keep you busy
here, winter or summer, you’ll never want to leave. Don’t forget your
wallet, though; premiere resorts aren’t the cheapest. Vail (Chapter 19) and
Aspen (Chapter 20) are the toniest of towns, while Steamboat Springs
(Chapter 21) is a little more of a just-kick-back-and-have-fun kind of place.
The Gunnison Valley and the Western Slope
Gunnison and Crested Butte (Chapter 22) are fun mountain towns near
the top of stunning Black Canyon, a 2,000-foot-deep gorge. This is where
the mountains slope downward into the Great Basin, and farther west,
near Grand Junction, erosion has isolated the sandstone Uncompahgre
Plateau and the canyons of Colorado National Monument. I detail the
major highlights of this region in Chapter 23.
The Four Corners and Mesa Verde
This area plummets from the 14,000-foot peaks of the San Juans to the
canyon bottoms of the Four Corners area, which gets its name from the
Chapter 3: Deciding When and Where to Go 25

four-cornered meeting point of four states (Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and
New Mexico). The towns of Telluride, Silverton, and Ouray preserve a
100-year-old mining history in addition to offering abundant recreation.
Other areas have ancient history. Near Cortez and Durango, you can
explore the remnants of the ancestral Pueblo culture, which flourished
here until about A.D. 1300. For more on this historic region, see Chapter 24.
The San Juan Mountains and the San Luis Valley
The highest peaks in the state tower above river valleys in this area just
east of the continental divide. High in the mountains, the colorful mining
towns of Lake City and Creede are virtual living museums, showing the
life of Colorado 100 years ago. And below Creede, the Rio Grande River
helped carve out the broad San Luis Valley, home to farms, geothermal
springs, and Great Sand Dunes National Monument and Preserve. For
detailed information on this region, see Chapter 25.
Scheduling Your Time
One of the great aspects of travel in Colorado is that nature has done a
pretty good job of organizing the state into fairly discrete ranges and the
valleys between them. I organize this book as much as possible accord-
ing to these guidelines created by Mother Nature, and for a visual aid,
you can study the nearby “Colorado” map, which emphasizes the valleys
and the passes between them.
As a general rule, you’ll do fine if you pick one town or valley as a base,
and then explore adjacent valleys in day trips. Trying to go farther than
that, though, is only for travelers who like driving a lot and who would
rather see the state through car windows. For example, if you base your-
self in Buena Vista (Chapter 18) during summer, you can easily get to the
Great Sand Dunes (Chapter 25), Summit County (Chapter 17), and Aspen
(Chapter 20). Don’t try to get to Steamboat Springs or Durango, though.
Denver makes the most sense as a base for visiting the Front Range, as
you can easily take day trips to Boulder and Colorado Springs, as well as
Rocky Mountain National Park, Middle Park, and Summit County. Because
it’s right on I-70, even Vail is doable from Denver, but remember to plan
for a two-hour drive.
For skiers, if your plan is to fly into Denver, rent a car, and head straight
for the High Country, I don’t recommend trying to ski the day you arrive —
unless you arrive on a red-eye flight and have a gonzo streak worthy of
Hunter S. Thompson. Denver is a long flight from both coasts (as well as
the rest of the continent), and you’ll save yourself a headache (and possi-
bly other injuries) by taking your arrival day slowly, giving yourself time to
acclimate to the high altitude and to deal with the ever-present possibility
of inclement weather. This is Colorado . . . you’re supposed to relax!
Part I: Introducing Colorado 
26

Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
The single most important factor affecting Colorado weather is eleva-
tion. One general rule, subject to a few exceptions, is that for every 1,000
feet of elevation, the air temperature drops 3.5 degrees. When air cools,
it condenses and forms precipitation that eventually comes down as rain
or snow. So the higher up you go, the cooler — and snowier — it usually
gets, no matter what the season. Mountain temperatures can be bitterly
cold, especially if it’s windy, but even at the higher elevations of some of
the nation’s top ski resorts, you can find plenty of sunshine.
At 5,280 feet, Denver may be known as the Mile High City, but it’s much
lower than the mountains to its west, 58 of which top 14,000 feet. (Locals
refer to these peaks as fourteeners.) Whether you’re in Denver or higher
up in the Rockies, you’ll probably notice the (relatively) cool, thin air.
But like much of the state, Denver is a dry place that has more than 300
sunny days each year — more than Miami or San Diego! — and it can get
surprisingly warm here. Temperatures have been known to climb to 90
degrees and higher during the height of summer.
The cool, dry, thin air means dehydration and intense sunlight. Be sure
to have moisturizer, sun block, and shades, and it’s a good idea to keep a
bottle of water with you, even in Denver.
If you don’t like the weather in Colorado, wait ten minutes or, better yet,
drive up or down. It’s not unheard of for Coloradans to ski and golf on
the same day, simply by changing elevations. Still, you’ll definitely want
to visit during the ideal season for pursuing your favorite activities. The
only place for snow in July is on the highest mountain peaks, so if you
want to slalom, your best bet is to show up between late November and
early April. But if you’re a hiker or a biker, the trails are usually snowless
and dry from late May through early October.
Unless you’re traveling with children and are governed by their school
schedules, the most convenient times to visit the state are the shoulder
seasons during early spring and late fall. Not only will you avoid crowds,
you’ll also save money.
Chapter 3: Deciding When and Where to Go 27
Frozen zones
The air temperature not only affects how you feel when you visit Colorado but also
affects the plant and animal species you see in a given area. Atop Colorado’s highest
peaks are zones of biological life comparable to ones found near sea level as far north
as the Yukon. Meanwhile, the low-lying canyons in the southern part of the state bear
species that flourish as far south as Mexico.

Along the Front Range, where Denver and Colorado Springs are located,
summer days are hot and dry, evenings pleasantly mild. Evenings start
to get even cooler by mid-September, but as late as November the days
are often warm. Surprisingly, winters here are warmer and less snowy
than those in the Great Lakes area or New England.
Most of Colorado is considered semiarid, and overall the state has an
average of 296 sunny days a year. The prairies average about 16 inches
of precipitation annually; the cities along the Front Range, 14 inches; the
western slope, only about 8 inches. Rain, when it falls, is commonly a
short deluge — a summer afternoon thunderstorm. However, if you want
to see snow, simply head to the mountains, where snowfall is measured
in feet rather than inches, and mountain peaks may still be white in July.
In the following sections, I break down Colorado’s seasonal score sheet.
To get an idea of the average temperatures, rainfall, and snowfall you’ll
encounter in some of Colorado’s cities, see Tables 3-1 and 3-2, which list
average temperatures (in degrees Fahrenheit) and precipitation (in
inches).

Spring
Depending on when you arrive and where you visit, spring in Colorado
can be either a beautiful blessing or a muddy nightmare. Here are some
of the season’s pluses:
 By mid-May, Denver and the other Front Range towns have usually
passed their freezing point. Flowers start blooming and the land-
scape is stunning.
 Rafting on mountain rivers, swollen by the winter snows and spring
thaw, is an especially thrilling experience this time of year.
 No matter where you go in the state, you’ll have many tourist desti-
nations, including the national parks, nearly to yourself.
 Many resorts offer discounts and drop their rates.
But spring has some serious downsides:
 Before all its flowers can bloom, the Front Range is often battered
by thunderstorms caused by cold air sliding down from the moun-
tains meeting sun-warmed, damp air surging northward from the
Gulf of Mexico. On average, Denver receives over two inches of pre-
cipitation during May, its wettest month.
 If you make a date with spring in the Rockies, you’ll probably get
stood up. The sun does shine sometimes, yet much of the high
country remains snow-covered, and areas where the snow has
melted can stay muddy into June.
 Temperatures in areas of high elevation remain cool. For example,
in May, the average high temperature in Leadville is a not-so-balmy
53 degrees. So if you want to spend time above the treeline, this is
not the time do it.
Summer
Colorado is very popular with visitors and outdoor enthusiasts in
summer. The season sizzles because
 Denver is usually sunny, warm, and mild.
 Summer is beautiful in the Rockies. Clusters of aspen trees bloom
one by one, dabbing green across the hillsides. The mountains
quickly become lush and fragrant, and when the snow in the
high country melts (in mid-July), wildflowers such as penstemon,
columbine, fireweed, and dwarf clover illuminate the meadows
and tundra.
 Temperatures in the mountain regions climb blissfully into the 70s
and beyond during the day.
 The major attractions are up and running, and the going doesn’t get
much better in the hiking department.
Chapter 3: Deciding When and Where to Go 29

But summer fizzles because
 When the sun goes down, the mountainous areas in Colorado can
get downright cold. Leadville’s low temperature in July is a chilly
38 degrees, and Aspen’s nighttime low is a measly 47 degrees. Even
cities at lower elevations, such as Denver, can get pretty cool at
night. You’ll need a jacket!
 Afternoon thunderstorms can flare up without warning. The
wettest months are July and August.
 The major parks can get uncomfortably crowded in summer, espe-
cially if you’re unwilling or unable to head too far off the beaten
path. Denver, too, buzzes with visitors.
 Your wallet will take a beating, because most resort and hotel rates
climb as high as the Rockies.
Fall
Fall in Colorado starts off with a burst of color, but its end can be a little
bleak. It’s fabulous because
 Denver is at its sunniest and driest, and the temperature here
remains pretty temperate — 60s in October, 50s in November. And
the leaves first start turning colors in early October, so the foliage
season lasts longer than in the mountains.
 Come September, the changing leaves in the mountains can be
nearly as extraordinary as the late-summer wildflowers are. Rocky
Mountain maple, Gambel oak, and quaking aspen spatter the hills
with red, orange, and yellow, respectively, against a backdrop of
evergreen trees.
 The start of the school year means fewer people in the parks and
at the major attractions. You won’t be alone, but you won’t feel
cramped either, especially not in late September and October.
 Prices drop from their stratospheric elevations to more reasonable
levels.
On the other hand
 Fall comes fast and early to the mountains, so the foliage show is
over by early October. Miss it and the only leaves you’ll see in the
Rockies will be the ones on the ground.
 Temperatures drop, especially in the mountain zones. Snowstorms
are guaranteed in the Rockies — although they won’t provide
enough snow for good skiing — and it can get brutally cold. By late
October, even Denver is pretty frosty — growing up, I had to pre-
pare for snow when planning my Halloween costume!
Part I: Introducing Colorado 
30

Winter
Winter in Colorado brings most travelers visions of snow-covered moun-
tains, and those visions are pretty true to life. This time of year is won-
derful because
 Snow falls, heavily at times, throughout the Rockies from October
(and sometimes earlier) through May (and sometimes later). The
amount of snowfall varies greatly from place to place and season to
season, yet many towns average over 200 inches annually — even
without the help of a ski-area marketing department. All that white
stuff looks pretty, feels soft, absorbs sound, and is fun to slide
around on.
 Because of their southern latitude, the Rockies warm up rapidly on
sunny winter days, so you can stay relatively comfortable. Despite
being perched at 10,046 feet, Leadville has an average high temper-
ature of 29 degrees during January.
 Storms coming from the west tend to lose moisture over the moun-
tains, so Denver often stays dry in early winter. Denver’s average
high temperature in January is 43, and the skies are usually sunny.
And a lot of the snow that falls during the rest of the winter here
tends to melt quickly so you won’t get snowed-in, but you can
still take advantage of the city’s proximity to good recreational
opportunities.
But winter does have its downside. Consider the following:
 Nights in the mountain regions, when no clouds trap warm air in
the atmosphere, are particularly frosty. Leadville’s average low 
temperature in both January and February is 0 degrees. Towns in
mountain valleys where cold air settles can be even more frigid.
The communities of Gunnison and Fraser sometimes register the
coldest temperatures in the continental United States!
 All that mountain snow may look beautiful, but it can wreak havoc
on the roads and make life miserable for drivers.
 You won’t be the only one basking in the beauty of the winter
mountains. Crowds flock to all the major ski areas as soon as the
snow gets deep enough for skiing.
 Hotel and resort rates skyrocket in the major ski towns during
Christmas week and they don’t start moving downhill until late
March.

Chapter 4
Following an Itinerary: 
Four Great Options
In This Chapter
 Eyeing amazing sights in central and western Colorado
 Doing Colorado with youngsters
 Finding hot spots for history buffs
 Skiing Colorado
I
tineraries that involve a lot of driving aren’t for everyone. One of the
best ways to enjoy Colorado is to rent a cabin for a week and then do
a different outdoor activity or a new trail every day. Colorado isn’t really
the kind of place where people tend to go and look at stuff, like, say Italy,
where the history is amazing but you can’t walk up and touch a lot of it.
People tend to come to Colorado to do stuff — be it hiking, skiing, or just
hanging out.
But if you’re the type of person who needs to see a lot on vacation, I give
you four itineraries designed to cover a string of highlights for people
with specific interests. One itinerary details the state’s most spectacular
drives, involving a number of Colorado’s greatest hits. Another identifies
family-friendly spots, and ways to get the most out of touring Colorado
with kids. The last is for history buffs who want to experience the Old
West.
Taking In the High Passes 
(And Higher Peaks)
This warm-weather tour is designed to show you the most spectacular
sights with a minimum of fuss. It takes you over progressively higher
mountain passes with hairpin turns and stunning views. Note that not all
these roads can handle vehicles longer than 25 feet, and a few are closed
during the winter.

Spend Day 1 in Denver (Chapter 11), getting your bearings. A trip to the
Colorado History Museum will give you a good idea of the history of the
state and the territory you’re about to experience. For dinner, feast on
buffalo or game at The Fort or the Buckhorn Exchange, and catch 40
winks at the Oxford Hotel or one of the great bed-and-breakfasts in town.
Get an early start on Day 2, and head southwest on US 285 through
Conifer and Bailey. If you get a really early start, take I-70 up to
Georgetown (Chapter 12) and go over Guanella Pass to Grant. This puts
you on US 285, and you continue south and west over Kenosha Pass into
South Park. You traverse this gorgeous high valley and go over Trout
Creek Pass into the Upper Arkansas Valley. Marvel at the splendor of the
grandiose Collegiate Peaks. At the junction with US Highway 24, turn
right and have lunch at Jan’s Restaurant in Buena Vista (Chapter 18).
Continue down through Salida and into the San Luis Valley (Chapter 25),
where you get an afternoon to explore the Great Sand Dunes. Head back
to Salida for dinner and a good night’s sleep.
Day 3 takes you back up the Arkansas valley to Colorado 82
(Independence Pass). Hold on tight at the top! Spend the rest of the
morning exploring the shops at Aspen (Chapter 20) where you’ll have
lunch. If you don’t want to window shop, go through town and head up
the beautiful road to the ghost town of Ashcroft. After lunch, head up
the Maroon Creek road, park at Maroon Lake, and take an easy hike
up the valley to see the Maroon Bells, some of the most beautiful moun-
tains in the state. Hike back to your car and head down valley to find
dinner and spend the night in Basalt or Carbondale.
Day 4 starts up the Crystal River Valley (Colorado 133) from Carbondale
to Redstone. Tour Redstone Castle and keep driving on 133 over McClure
Pass. At Hotchkiss, turn onto Colorado 92 and go down through Crawford
to the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park (Chapter 22). Spend
the afternoon gazing into the abyss and either camp or get yourself to
Gunnison for the night.
You have to do some backtracking on Day 5, a long driving day. From
Gunnison, take Monarch Pass (US 50) back over to the Arkansas Valley
and head north. However, don’t stop until you get to Leadville (Chap-
ter 18). Have lunch there, and take Colorado 91 down into Frisco and
Silverthorne (Chapter 17). You can explore this area a bit, or press on;
you’ll be going down Colorado 9 along the Blue River to Kremmling,
where you turn east on US 40 and go through Hot Sulphur Springs to
Granby. Turn onto US 34 and make your weary way to Grand Lake where
you’ll find a well-deserved dinner and rest for the night.
Spend Day 6 in Rocky Mountain National Park (Chapter 15), hiking,
climbing, and driving over Trail Ridge Road. If you can spend an extra
day here, do so; or bed down in Estes Park and head back to Denver for
Day 7 and your trip home.

Touring Colorado with Kids
Most of the activities in this itinerary — designed for those traveling with
kids — work well for youths between the ages of 8 and 16. And they’re fun
for adults, too. What they aren’t, however, is cheap. This trip impresses
not just with natural splendor but also with spectacles bought and paid
for with cash. If you’re on a tight budget — or a tight schedule — you may
need to cross off a few of the attractions listed here to save money, time,
and energy.
Start Day 1 in Denver (Chapter 11). If you arrived early in the morning
and have at least a half-day, ride the roller coasters and water slides at Six
Flags Elitch Gardens. Even if you only have a few hours, you have enough
time to stroll past the aquariums and watch a simulated flash flood at
Ocean Journey. Then drive south to Manitou Springs (Chapter 14) and
spend the night there at the historic Broadmoor or one of the area’s many
family-friendly motels.
On the morning of Day 2, get up and take the Pikes Peak Cog Railway
to the summit of Pikes Peak. In the afternoon, tour Cave of the Winds,
or, if you prefer a free attraction, go hike among the immense sandstone
slabs in Garden of the Gods. Come evening, enjoy the Skee-Ball, kiddy
rides, and video games at Arcade Amusements, Inc., in Manitou Springs
(Chapter 14), where you should spend another night.
On Day 3, sleep late and then drive to the Royal Gorge Bridge and
Park, near Cañon City (Chapter 14). This is high-priced fun, but the
bridge over the 1,000-foot-deep gorge is cool. Walk across it, walk back,
take some rides, and then continue on to Salida (Chapter 18). After
dinner in Salida, go swim and soak at the Salida Hot Springs. Spend the
night in Salida at the Woodland Motel.
Spend most of Day 4 taking a half-day raft trip on the Arkansas River.
When you arrive back on dry land, drive north to Breckenridge
(Chapter 17) and spend the night at the Breckenridge Mountain Lodge,
which has a game room with a pool table, foosball, and video games.
On Day 5, let the kids go wild playing in the maze, on the climbing wall,
and on the alpine slide at the Peak 8 Fun Park at Breckenridge Mountain
Resort. Spend another night in Breckenridge.
On Day 6, drive a few miles to Silver Plume (Chapter 12). Take a ride on
the Georgetown Loop Railroad and go for a mine tour midway through
the ride. Spend the night in Georgetown (Chapter 12) at the Georgetown
Mountain Inn, where the kids can cool off in the outdoor swimming pool.
On Day 7, return to Denver. Play around with the hands-on exhibits at
the Museum of Nature and Science and then stroll through the Denver
Zoo. Both attractions are within walking distance of one another at City
Park.

Colorado for History Buffs
This tour is a hard-charging, weeklong romp across the state. It takes in
some of the oddest and most unusual historical sites in the nation, but
because of the extensive driving, it’s really suitable only for avid drivers
who have a strong historical bent.
Welcome to Colorado. If you’re like most people flying into the state, you’ll
probably start out in Denver. Spend Day 1 in Denver (Chapter 11). After
settling in at your hotel, visit the Molly Brown House and then check out
the Colorado history timeline at the Colorado History Museum. Have
dinner alongside the taxidermy at the Buckhorn Exchange, the oldest
restaurant in town. By the end of the day, a good night’s sleep is in order,
and I suggest you bed down at the ornate but relaxed Oxford Hotel in
LoDo (Lower Downtown), a classic hotel in Denver’s historic nightlife 
district.
On Day 2, ascend to Leadville (Chapter 18) by car. Visit the National
Mining Hall of Fame and Museum, and then take a driving tour of the
historic mines around town. If you have a few minutes to spare, go hear
the chilling story of Baby Doe Tabor at the Matchless Mine. Afterwards,
walk the catacombs at the Tabor Opera House. Wind down your day
with a beverage at one of Doc Holliday’s old haunts, the Silver Dollar
Saloon, before spending the night at the Delaware Hotel.
On Day 3, finish seeing any sights you missed in Leadville, then make
the 253-mile drive to Durango (Chapter 24) and check into the Strater
Hotel.
On Day 4, take the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad
(Chapter 24) to the mountain town of Silverton (you can park your car
at the railway’s station). If you have an extra day to spare, get a room at
the Wyman Hotel. If you’re sticking to the seven-day itinerary, return on
the train to Durango that afternoon and stay another night at the Strater.
On Day 5, rise early, and then drive from Durango to Mesa Verde
National Park (Chapter 24), and take an early morning tour of Cliff
Palace. Spend a few more hours at the park, and then head from Cortez
to Telluride (Chapter 24). At twilight, walk Telluride’s historic down-
town. Spend the night at the New Sheridan Hotel.
On Day 6, drive from Telluride north to Delta. At Delta, cut off on
Colorado 92 to Paonia, and then take Colorado 133 to Redstone
(Chapter 20). Take an afternoon tour of Redstone Castle, built in the
early 1900s by one of the richest men in America, John Osgood. Spend
the night at the Redstone Inn, once part of Osgood’s utopian community
for miners.
Part I: Introducing Colorado 
38

If you don’t need to be in Denver on Day 7, drive an hour or so to
Glenwood Springs (Chapter 20). Stay in the Hotel Colorado and soak
in the Hot Springs Pool. If you need to be closer to Denver in order to
catch a flight the next day, explore the mining towns of Idaho Springs
and Georgetown (Chapter 12). Unwind by soaking at the historic Indian
Springs Resort in Idaho Springs.
The Ski-’Til-You-Drop Tour
Okay, for all you serious downhillers who want to shred as much of the
state as possible, this tour is just for you. No guts, no glory, right? If
that’s your style, read on. . . .
Fly into Denver for Day 1, and take it easy, kid. You’ll need all that energy
(and then some) for the week ahead. Get a room for two nights at the
Embassy Suites Downtown Denver or the Oxford Hotel (Chapter 11)
and get up bright and early on Day 2 to catch the Ski Train to Winter
Park (Chapter 16). The more advanced runs at Mary Jane are on the
adjacent mountain and between the two ski areas, so you’ll get a good
warm-up for what’s to come. Ride the train back down the hill and have
dinner and microbrews at the Wynkoop Brewing Company (Chapter 11).
Then hit the hay, cowpokes.
Hit the road early on Day 3 to drive to Breckenridge, the best all-around
mountain in Summit County (Chapter 17). If you want more serious back-
country skiing, go to Arapahoe Basin instead. Breckenridge has the nicest
town in the area, though, and the Breckenridge Brewery will fill you up
with good beer and pub food.
On Day 4, drive over the pass to Vail or Beaver Creek. You could easily
ski here for two or three days and not cover the whole place — it’s that
big. This is world-class skiing, though, so savor it. Take an extra day
(or two).
Not tired yet, are you? Good. Day 6 (or 7) will find you following the
river down to Glenwood Springs — it’s not a bad idea at this point to
soak for the morning in the hot springs here, to prepare yourself for the
glory that is Aspen. An hour’s drive up the Roaring Fork Valley from
Glenwood, the four mountains of this resort — Aspen Mountain, Aspen
Highlands, Snowmass, and Buttermilk — are also worth two or three
days, so take ’em if you got ’em. And enjoy the legendary nightlife in
town, if your legs can take it.
If you can still operate the pedals on your car, it’s time for your final
challenge: On whatever day this is, drive back down the valley and
towards Vail again to Wolcott, where you’ll pick up Colorado 131 north
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 39

to Steamboat Springs. Ski in the afternoon if you must, or soak in a hot
tub and tackle the mountain the next day.
For the certifiably insane only: If you want to end the trip on the steep-
est note possible, you can skip Steamboat Springs, take a day just for
driving and find some way to get to Crested Butte or Silverton. This will
cement your reputation as the craziest skier ever and win the awe and
admiration of your friends back home.
If you can get back home, that is. . . .

olorado may not be as expensive as, say, Manhattan, but it’s not
cheap either. If you’re not careful during your travels, you may end
up panning for gold in order to finance your bus ticket back home.
Planning Your Budget
Making a budget for your trip ahead of time always pays, even if you
don’t necessarily stick to it after you arrive. Start by writing down the
cost of transportation to and from the airport and continue adding antic-
ipated costs until you budget for every expense — even the smallest
souvenirs you hope to buy. As you work through your budget, consider
all the costs described in the following sections. When you have your
total, add another 15 percent for unexpected costs.
Tables 5-1 and 5-2 give you an idea of what things typically cost in
Denver and Vail, respectively, so you don’t end up with sticker shock
when you get to Colorado.

Totaling up your transportation
Transportation is one of the easiest categories to budget for ahead of
time because airlines and rental-car companies will quote prices in
advance. When you calculate your transportation costs, make sure you
consider the taxes on both your rental car and your airfare, and don’t
overlook the cost of gas.
Some people prefer to avoid mountain driving — especially during winter
when roads can be treacherous — and instead fly closer to destinations
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Colorado 
44

such as Telluride, Crested Butte, and Aspen. This option is a pricey one,
but it may let you get by without renting a car, because many ski towns
have excellent, free shuttle systems.
For more on transportation costs, turn to Chapter 7, which has different
options for flying inside Colorado and tips on how to keep your rental-
car costs down.
Calculating lodging costs
Where and when you stay in Colorado affects your accommodation
expenses. The college towns, such as Boulder, are expensive in summer
and during special university events (parents’ weekends, football games,
and so on), but are less expensive at other times. In resort communities,
such as Vail and Aspen, the price of a nice hotel room for even one night
can rival the cost of airfare from the East Coast. If you want to stay in the
fanciest hotels in the trendiest ski towns, be prepared to sell some stock.
Downtown Denver is similarly pricey. You may be able to sell fewer shares
if you stay in downtown Denver on weekends, and hit the ski towns in late
April and early May (after the ski areas close) and November (before the
ski areas open).
The good news is that a wide range of other options exists. People some-
times forget that the mountain West has not traditionally been a wealthy
region; even today, you can often drive a half-hour from a resort town to
a smaller ranching or mining community where lodging is available at a
fraction of the price. Pleasant, spare, $50 motel rooms in pretty areas are
hardly out of the question, especially during winter and spring.
Eating out
As with lodging, you can spend as much or as little as you want while
dining in Colorado. You can eat pretty well for $30 to $40 a day per
person if you skip the fanciest restaurants and don’t load up on liquor.
The state has lots of charming but cheap small-town cafes that serve
hearty meals for under $10. It also has more than its share of gourmet
restaurants, most of them concentrated in the cities and resort commu-
nities, where a dinner entree can go for upwards of $20. At most good
Colorado eateries, you can get a dinner entree for $8 to $20. Watch out
for places that bill à la carte — your tab can add up quickly. If you
decide to splurge, you can make up the difference by scrimping the next
few days. Even in resort communities, you can often eat for $6 or $7 if
you’re willing to forgo a sit-down meal.
If you’re on a strict budget, know that many hotels offer a free continental
breakfast as part of the room rate, so ask before you book a room. If a free
breakfast is not offered at your hotel, you can usually save a few bucks by
going to a local coffee shop or espresso bar instead of dining in the hotel
restaurant. Not only will you save money, but you’ll get a better feel for
the town. And those traveling with children will be happy to know that
many Colorado restaurants have special low-priced kids’ menus.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 45

Budgeting for attractions
Most Colorado attractions are fairly inexpensive — just make sure you
stay around long enough to get to know them. In other words, if you go
to four different attractions in a day, it’s going to cost you. An adult
ticket to the Denver Zoo during high season costs $8; in low season, it’s
$6. The national parks and monuments in Colorado are the state’s best
deals. For $15, a carload of people gets admitted to Rocky Mountain
National Park for an entire week. Mesa Verde National Park costs just $10
per carload per week, and admission to Black Canyon of the Gunnison
National Park runs a mere $7.
If you plan on visiting more than a few national parks and monuments,
buy a Golden Eagle pass. For $65, the card admits you and others travel-
ing with you to national parks and monuments for a year from the date
of purchase. For more information, go online to www.nps.gov/fees_
passes.htm or call % 888-467-2757.
Pricing activities and tours
Unlike parks and museums, recreation in Colorado can be dauntingly
expensive. For example, ski-lift tickets at Colorado resorts can sell for
$65 or more. These prices can really hurt your wallet, but most visitors
manage to avoid paying them.
You can find discounted lift tickets that let you ride the slope’s chairlifts
for a day as part of travel packages or by coming during the off season.
You can also go to smaller ski areas that offer great skiing but less acreage
and fewer amenities. If you plan your trip far enough in advance, you can
save on lift tickets another way: season passes. Prices have dropped so
low at the ski areas nearest Denver that season passes can be a bargain
for visitors planning to spend a week at the same resort. The passes are
cheapest early in fall and climb in price as you get closer to prime skiing
season.
If you’re a golfer, you can find discounts on late-afternoon tee times at
many courses.
Shopping for Colorado goods
You can shop for fine art in galleries throughout Colorado. Like the land
where they’re located, prices at the hottest galleries start mile-high and
go up from there. A less expensive option is to browse the quirky crafts
and homespun knickknacks in offbeat tourist shops, where you may find
something you like for under $20.
Outdoor enthusiasts should watch for maverick companies producing
clothing and gear. Although high-quality outdoor goods are pricey, you
won’t get fleeced if you buy directly from the source.
Another item that can cost a little — or a lot — is Native American art. If
you know what you’re doing, you can get the best deals by purchasing
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Colorado 
46

directly from the artist or from vendors on a reservation. If you don’t
know your Native American art, you’re better off buying from a rep-
utable trading post. I like the Cultural Center at 25 N. Market St. in
Cortez (% 970-565-1151), for one.
Controlling nightlife costs
The cost of a night on the town varies widely depending on where you
happen to be when the sun goes down. Most of the really expensive
options are in Denver, where you can fork over $8 for a martini or up to
$130 to take in an opera. But Denver also has some reasonably priced
bars and clubs, and even the unreasonable ones offer drink specials and
happy-hour deals.
Outside the cities, prices drop. In most ski towns, you can quaff a pint
of Colorado microbrew for around $3.50 and hear live music for a
cover charge of $8 or less. The really rural towns are even cheaper —
a shot and a beer at a cowboy bar will dent your sobriety more than
your pocketbook.
Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
The destination chapters in Parts III, IV, and V all include money-saving
tips specific to those regions, but here’s some additional free advice to
help keep your money in your pocket:
 Go in the off season. During nonpeak times, Colorado’s hotel
prices can be one-third of what they are during peak months. The
ski areas slow down during the weeks preceding Christmas, the
month of January (when the snow is often excellent), and April. If
you simply want to visit the mountains but don’t care when, con-
sider going in mid- to late-September, when the leaves change and
the rates start falling. In Denver, May and September are often
uncrowded, and temperatures can be near-perfect.
 Travel midweek. If you can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to your destination. When
you ask about airfares, see if you can get a cheaper rate by flying on
a different day. For more tips on getting a good fare, see Chapter 6.
 Try a package tour. For many destinations, you can book airfare,
hotel, ground transportation, and even some sightseeing just by
making one call to a travel agent or packager for a price much less
than if you put the trip together yourself. (See Chapter 6 for more
on package tours.)
 Rent an economy car, not an SUV. The amount of money you can
save renting, fueling, and insuring a smaller car is often enough to
pay for a very nice meal or two.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 47

 Reserve a room with a refrigerator and coffeemaker. You don’t
have to slave over a hot stove to cut a few costs; several motels
have minifridges and coffeemakers. Buying supplies for breakfast
will save you money — and probably calories.
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
plans, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for sav-
ings on car rentals, plane tickets, hotel rooms, and even meals. Ask
about everything; you may be pleasantly surprised.
 Ask if your kids can stay in the room with you. A room with two
double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than one with a queen-
size bed. And many hotels won’t charge you the additional person
rate if the additional person is pint-size and related to you. Even if
you have to pay $10 or $15 extra for a rollaway bed, you’ll save
hundreds by not taking two rooms.
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch instead of dinner. Lunch tabs
are usually a fraction of what dinner would cost at a top restaurant,
and the menu often boasts many of the same specialties.
 Get out of town. In many places, big savings are just a short drive
or taxi ride away. Hotels just outside the city, across the river, or
less conveniently located are great bargains. Outlying motels often
have free parking, with lower rates than downtown hotels offering
amenities that you may never use. Sure, at a motel you’ll be carry-
ing your own bags, but the rooms are often just as comfortable and
a whole lot cheaper. See Chapter 8 for more about hotels.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Colorado 
48
Keeping your phone bills down
Hotels impose a variety of fees for telephone calls. Some allow free local calls; others
charge 50¢ or more per call. If you need to make dozens of local calls, look for accom-
modations where you can make them for free.
No matter where you stay, never, ever direct-dial long distance from your room, where
rates can top $2 per minute. And don’t count on your cellphone working either,
because signals can be weak in the mountains and roving charges often apply. If you
expect to make long-distance calls while on the road, your best bet is to shop ahead
of time for an inexpensive prepaid calling card. (The ones sold through Costco and
Sam’s Club cost around 4¢ per minute.) Make your calls via the toll-free number on
the card. You still have to pay any fees that apply to local calls if you call from your
room, but your total cost will easily beat the tab for long distance. When using a pre-
paid calling card, remember that some hotels also start charging for calling-card (and
other toll-free) calls after a given amount of time (usually about 20 minutes). If you’re
worried you’ll go over the time limit, find a pay phone and call from there.

 Walk a lot. A good pair of walking shoes can save lots of money in
taxis and other local transportation. As a bonus, you’ll get to know
your destination more intimately as you explore at a slower pace.
 Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and your memories could be
the best mementos of your trip. If you’re concerned about money,
you can do without the T-shirts, key chains, salt-and-pepper shak-
ers, and other trinkets.
Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying
or what alternative form of currency is your favorite. That’s not going to
change much on your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving around
more and incurring more expenses than you generally do (unless you
happen to eat out every meal when you’re at home), and you may let
your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about your
safety as when you’re in work mode. But, those factors aside, the only
type of payment that won’t be quite as available to you away from home
is your personal checkbook.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an
ATM (automated teller machine). The Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.
mastercard.com) and PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) net-
works span the globe; look at the back of your bank card to see which
network you’re on, then call or check online for ATM locations at your
destination. Be sure you know your personal identification number (PIN)
before you leave home and be sure to find out your daily withdrawal
limit before you depart. Also keep in mind that many banks impose a fee
every time your card is used at a different bank’s ATM (usually at least
$1.50). On top of this, the bank from which you withdraw cash may
charge its own fee. To compare banks’ ATM fees within the United
States, use www.bankrate.com.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You can also withdraw cash advances from your credit
cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten
yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the number on the back of
your credit card and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes five
to seven business days, though some banks will provide the number
over the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or some
other personal information.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 49

Dealing with debit cards
Another way of working with money you have — as opposed to the vir-
tual money of credit cards — is to use a debit card, or check card as
they’re sometimes called. In many cases, your debit and ATM card are
the same piece of plastic. Instead of getting cash, however, the debit card
pays for purchases pretty much anywhere a credit card is accepted. The
advantage? The money comes out of your checking account rather than
pushing up against your credit card limit. Plus, you’re not likely to pay an
additional fee to use it (though you may end up with some charge if your
bank limits, say, the number of debit transactions in a month), and you
have less cash to carry around.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most cities have
24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw cash as needed. However, keep
in mind that you will likely be charged an ATM withdrawal fee if the bank
is not your own, so if you’re withdrawing money every day, you may be
better off with traveler’s checks — provided that you don’t mind showing
identification every time you want to cash one.
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent.
You can also get American Express traveler’s checks over the phone by
calling % 800-221-7282; Amex gold and platinum cardholders who use
this number are exempt from the 1 percent fee.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as
at several other banks. The service charge ranges between 1.5 percent
and 2 percent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and
$1,000. Call % 800-732-1322 for information. AAA members can obtain
Visa checks without a fee at most AAA offices or by calling % 866-339-
3378. MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks. Call % 800-223-9920 for
a location near you.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in the event that they are
stolen or lost. You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Be sure to contact all your credit card companies the minute you dis-
cover your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report at the nearest
police precinct. Your credit card company or insurer may require a
police report number or record of the loss. Most credit card companies
have an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost or stolen;
they may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or deliver an
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Colorado 
50

emergency credit card in a day or two. Call the following emergency
numbers in the United States:
 American Express % 800-221-7282 (for cardholders and traveler’s
check holders)
 MasterCard % 800-307-7309 or 636-722-7111
 Visa % 800-847-2911 or 410-581-9994
For other credit cards, call the toll-free number directory at % 800-555-
1212.
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-
3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.
transunion.com). Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call your
airline and explain the situation; they may allow you to board the plane
if you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the
police report you filed.

ver since the World Wide Web empowered travelers to search for
the cheapest rates and fares, vacation planning has become an exer-
cise in self-reliance, if not an exercise in self-frustration. People often feel
duty-bound to find the best deal, even if they grow old in the process.
And there’s a lot to think about. You can shop for the best airfares and
room rates individually, seek the best package deals, or drop the mouse
and hire a travel agent. Here are some tips that should help, no matter
which course you choose.
Flying into Colorado
More than 100,000 passengers pass through Denver International
Airport, also known as DIA (% 800-AIR-2-DEN; TDD 800-688-1333; www.
flydenver.com) every day, but you can easily fly to Colorado without
ever setting foot in DIA. Flights from outside Colorado land in or near
Aspen, Colorado Springs, Durango, Grand Junction, Montrose, Steamboat
Springs, Telluride, and Vail. Eight airlines, offering 100 flights daily, serve
Colorado Springs (% 719-550-1972; www.flycos.com) alone.
If you do land in Denver, you can take commuter flights to all the airports
listed in the preceding paragraph as well as ones in Alamosa, Cortez, and
Gunnison. Denver is, however, the only international airport in the state.
In addition to serving 100 destinations in the United States, DIA offers
nonstop service to 11 foreign destinations, including ones in Canada,
Mexico, and Europe.
Major domestic and international carriers that fly into both Denver and
Colorado Springs include American, America West, Continental, Delta,
Northwest, and United. Air Canada, Alaska, British Airways, JetBlue,
Lufthansa, Mexicana, and U.S. Airways offer service to Denver only.

During winter, the busiest mountain airport, Vail/Eagle County Airport
(% 970-524-9490; www.eaglecounty.us/airport), has daily nonstop
service to Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Minneapolis, and
Newark, with less frequent nonstop flights from six other U.S. cities.

Getting the best deal on your airfare 
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a
coach seat is a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of
dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their companies
pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. But if you can book your
ticket far in advance, stay over Saturday night, and are willing to travel
midweek (Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday), you can qualify for the
least expensive price — usually a fraction of the full fare. On most
flights, even the shortest hops within the United States, the full fare is
close to $1,000 or more, but a 7- or 14-day advance purchase ticket may
cost less than half of that amount. Obviously, planning ahead pays.
The airlines also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices on
their most popular routes. These fares have advance purchase require-
ments and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the prices. As you
plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales, which tend to
take place in seasons of low travel volume. In Colorado, the off seasons
are the so-called shoulder seasons of late April to Memorial Day and mid-
September to mid-November. You almost never see a sale around the peak
summer vacation months of July and August, or around Thanksgiving or
Christmas, when many people fly, regardless of the fare they have to pay. 
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for inter-
national tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares
Chapter 6: Getting to Colorado 53

within North America. Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel sec-
tions; U.S. travelers should focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles
Times, and Miami Herald. 
Bucket shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 to 75 percent of the ticket price, and
some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety records. 
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available on the Net.
STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the world’s leader
in student travel, offers good fares for travelers of all ages. ELTExpress
(% 800-TRAV-800; www.flights.com) started in Europe and has excel-
lent fares worldwide, but particularly to that continent. Flights.com also
has “local” Web sites in 12 countries. Air Tickets Direct (% 800-778-
3447; www.airticketsdirect.com) is based in Montreal and leverages
the currently weaker Canadian dollar for low fares; it’ll also book trips to
places that U.S. travel agents won’t touch.
Booking your ticket online
The big three online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com),
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different busi-
ness deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same
flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will also send
you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available to your
favorite destination. Of the smaller travel agency Web sites, SideStep
(www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users. It’s a browser
add-on that purports to “search 140 sites at once,” but in reality only
beats competitors’ fares as often as other sites do.
Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are only
valid for travel that weekend, but some (such as Southwest’s) can be
booked weeks or months in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at
airline Web sites or check megasites that compile comprehensive lists of
last-minute specials, such as Smarter Living (smarterliving.com). For
last-minute trips, www.site59.com in the United States and www.last
minute.com in Europe often have better deals than the major-label sites.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service such as Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for travel
on a mystery airline at a mysterious time of day, often with a mysterious
change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all major, well-known
carriers — and the possibility of being sent from Philadelphia to Chicago
via Tampa is remote. But your chances of getting a 6 a.m. or 11 p.m. flight
are pretty high. Hotwire tells you flight prices before you buy; Priceline
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Colorado 
54

usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you have to play their “name
our price” game. Note: In 2004, Priceline added non-opaque service to its
roster. You now have the option to pick exact flights, times, and airlines
from a list of offers — or opt to bid on opaque fares as before.
Great last-minute deals are also available directly from the airlines them-
selves through a free e-mail service called E-savers. Each week, the airline
sends you a list of discounted flights, usually leaving the upcoming Friday
or Saturday and returning the following Monday or Tuesday. You can sign
up for all the major airlines at one time by logging on to Smarter Living
(www.smarterliving.com), or you can go to each individual airline’s
Web site. Airline sites also offer schedules, flight booking, and information
on late-breaking bargains.
Driving In
You can easily drive to Colorado via one of three interstate highways, all
of which meet in Denver:
 Interstate 70, which stretches all the way from Baltimore, Maryland,
to southwestern Utah, is the primary east-west artery through
Colorado.
 Interstate 76 branches off of I-80 (which spans from Chicago to San
Francisco) in southwestern Nebraska and makes a 190-mile jaunt
southwest to its terminus in Denver.
 Interstate 25 links Denver with destinations in the north (Casper and
Cheyenne, Wyoming) and the south (Albuquerque, New Mexico). As
I-25 skirts the eastern slope of the Rockies, this heavily traveled free-
way passes through major Colorado cities including Fort Collins,
Denver, Colorado Springs, and Pueblo.
Arriving by Rail
Amtrak’s California Zephyr train traverses the entire width of Colorado
en route from Chicago to Emeryville, California (near Oakland). Between
Denver and Fort Collins, it passes through some spectacular high country,
crossing the continental divide just south of Rocky Mountain National
Park and paralleling the Colorado River for long stretches in western
Colorado. The Zephyr doesn’t exactly breeze down the tracks — it takes
roughly 12 hours to cross the state — but its fares are fair: In February
2005, one-way coach tickets from Denver to Chicago, Salt Lake City, and
Emeryville were $103, $57, and $130, respectively.
A second Amtrak train, the Southwest Chief, clips the southeast corner
of Colorado on its way from Chicago to Los Angeles. For complete fare
information and scheduling for both of these routes, contact Amtrak
(% 800-USA-RAIL; www.amtrak.com).
Chapter 6: Getting to Colorado 55

Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours. The tour
company takes care of all the details and tells you what to expect at
each leg of your journey. You know your costs up front and, in the case
of the tame ones, you don’t get many surprises. Escorted tours can take
you to the maximum number of sights in the minimum amount of time
with the least amount of hassle.
If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend purchas-
ing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks you to pay up
front. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour opera-
tor doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you paid
for, there’s no reason to think that it’ll fulfill its insurance obligations
either. Get travel insurance through an independent agency. (I tell you
more about the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 10.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can they cancel the trip if they
don’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if you are unable
to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If they cancel?
 How jam-packed is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to fit
25 hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to relax
by the pool or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not return-
ing to your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. at night sounds like a grind, cer-
tain escorted tours may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may be evasive about this, because they may not know the exact
size of the group until everybody has made reservations, but they
should be able to give you a rough estimate.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum group
size, and may cancel the tour if they don’t book enough people. If a
quota exists, find out what it is and how close they are to reaching
it. Again, tour operators may be evasive in their answers, but the
information may help you select a tour that’s sure to happen.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have
to pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may
be included in an excursion, but drinks may be extra. Beer may be
included but not wine. 
 How much flexibility do you have? Can you opt out of certain
activities, or does the bus leave once a day, with no exceptions?
Are all your meals planned in advance? Can you choose your entree
at dinner, or does everybody get the same chicken cutlet?
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Colorado 
56

Depending on your recreational passions, I recommend one of the fol-
lowing tour companies:
 In 2005, Globus Tours offered an eight-day “Colorado and the Old
West” tour for $1,459, which included visits to Rocky Mountain
National Park, Vail, and a side trip to Moab, Utah.
 Also for 2005, Cosmos listed a nine-day “Colorado National Parks
and Trains” tour for $1,199 that included the Pikes Peak Cog
Railway, the Royal Gorge Railway, the Durango & Silverton Narrow
Gauge Railroad, and Mesa Verde, Moab, Vail, and Rocky Mountain
National Park.
Choosing a Package Tour
For lots of destinations, package tours can be a smart way to go. In many
cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to
and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a tour you book
yourself. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour operators,
who resell them to the public. It’s kind of like buying your vacation at a
buy-in-bulk store — except the tour operator is the one who buys the
1,000-count box of garbage bags and resells them ten at a time.
Package tours can vary as much as those garbage bags, too. Some offer
a better class of hotels than others; others provide the same hotels for
lower prices. Some book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell char-
ters. In some packages, your choice of accommodations and travel days
may be limited. Some let you choose between escorted vacations and
independent vacations; others allow you to add on just a few excursions
or escorted day trips (also at discounted prices) without booking an
entirely escorted tour.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines such as
Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (call % 888-271-1584 to find the store nearest you; www.
libertytravel.com) is one of the biggest packagers in the Northeast,
and usually boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines offer air/land packages, including American Airlines
Vacations (% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.com), Continental
Airlines Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.covacations.com), Delta
Vacations (% 800-221-6666; www.deltavacations.com), and United
Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.unitedvacations.com). Several big
online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Site59, and
Lastminute.com — also do a brisk business in packages. If you’re unsure
about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the Better Business
Bureau in the city where the company is based, or go online at www.
bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell you where it’s based, don’t fly with them.
Chapter 6: Getting to Colorado 57

For some sample prices on packages during the 2005 ski season,
Mountain Vacations (www.mountainvacations.com) lists a family
three-night vacation at Keystone, flying from Chicago O’Hare for $490
per person, and a five-night stay in Vail, flying from Houston for $1,430
per person. Other places to look include the following:
 Vacation Together, Inc. (% 800-839-9851; www.vacation
together.com) allows you to search for and book packages
offered by a number of tour operators and airlines.
 The United States Tour Operators Association’s Web site (www.
ustoa.com) lets you locate operators that offer packages to a spe-
cific destination. A number of Colorado companies are listed here.
Travel packages are also listed in the travel section of your local
Sunday newspaper.

Getting Around Colorado
In This Chapter
 Traveling the Colorado roads
 Getting a good rental-car deal
 Flying, chugging, and bussing around
W
hat’s the best way to see Colorado? If you have cash to spare,
you may enjoy flying to an airport right near your favorite resort
town, taking a cab into town, and then riding the free buses around the
community. You can easily enjoy Colorado without ever getting behind
the wheel of a car. If you’re like most people, however, you’ll eventually
get behind the wheel, beginning your trip at either Denver International
Airport or at points farther out.
Driving Around Colorado
The bicycle may be superior and the plane may be faster, but the car
(or SUV) still moves most people around Colorado. If you’re driving
in Colorado, these sections — plus the nearby “Driving Times and
Distances” map — offer some advice on getting around the state on
four wheels.
Handling the highways
Mountains make for tricky driving. They lift and cool air, which releases
rain and snow; they unloose rocks that roll onto roadbeds; and in spring,
their snowmelt occasionally floods things. The condition of a Colorado
highway often depends on who mounted the most recent offensive —
the road crew or the mountain. If the mountain happens to be winning
while you’re driving in the area, don’t blame the road crew — they’re
plotting their next move over coffee as we speak!
Certain Colorado roads are especially vulnerable to mountain weather:
 Interstate 70 east of Denver usually remains open during winter,
but chains or four-wheel-drive may be required during storms, and
weekend traffic can slow to a near standstill.

Bold numbers indicate distances in miles;

This map assumes that 60 miles
will take an average driving time of 1 hour
(excluding stops). Your average speed may
be lower in the mountains, and higher in
flatter territory and on interstates.
Driving Times & Distances

 U.S. 550 between Ouray and Silverton serves up what is arguably
the most frightening winter driving in the state. As it passes over
11,000-foot Red Mountain Pass, this two-lane highway edges across
the tops of enormous cliffs yet offers little in the way of guardrails
or shoulders for protection. It often closes during and after storms.
 Other roads close altogether. Colorado 82 between Aspen and
Leadville shuts down during winter due to heavy snows on 12,095-
foot Independence Pass. U.S. 34, which crosses the continental
divide at 12,183 feet inside Rocky Mountain National Park, also
closes during winter.
For recorded updates on road conditions within two hours of Denver,
call % 303-639-1111. For road conditions elsewhere in the state, dial
% 303-639-1234.
Negotiating road hazards
Drivers in Colorado face a unique set of challenges that may phase visi-
tors unused to the state’s rugged terrain and weather. For a smooth ride,
make certain you read this section, where I discuss climate and other
related problems that may crop up while you’re on the road.
Keeping pace with the rhythm of the traffic
On the steep inclines of Colorado’s mountain roads, it’s important to
remember that every vehicle has a different size and weight and that dif-
ferent engines have varying degrees of power. It’s difficult for any vehicle
to accelerate going uphill, and there’s also commercial traffic to consider.
Trucks and heavy vehicles clog up the right-hand lanes, and often go very
slowly, for safety’s sake. The trick is to pass them smoothly without cut-
ting off faster vehicles that might be coming up behind you (always keep
an eye on your rearview mirror).
Leave plenty of space in front and behind, slow down before you get to
the turn, and for Pete’s sake, stay out of the left lane unless you intend
to pass and can do it safely.
Surviving snow and ice
Many Colorado highways traverse mountain passes that receive, on aver-
age, more than 200 inches of snow annually. Most of us are ready for snow
during winter, but it’s easy to get fooled in spring and fall, when valley
rains sometimes become snowstorms up high. If you’re traveling in spring,
fall, and winter, be ready for snowy and icy conditions in the mountains.
Here are some tips on how to prepare for a ride in the frozen stuff:
 Check your tires to make sure they have adequate tread and are
properly inflated.
 If you don’t have a four-wheel-drive vehicle with snow tires, carry
chains.
Chapter 7: Getting Around Colorado 61

 Make sure your brakes, wipers, defroster, and heater all work.
 Carry a small shovel, a bag of sand (for extra weight inside the car
and for traction under the tires), a window brush, and a scraper.
 Stow a sleeping bag in your vehicle, just in case you get stranded.
 Keep a powerful flashlight handy so you can signal other drivers in
the event of an accident. You also may want to carry an emergency
flare for the same reason.
 Watch the weather and try to imagine what may be happening high
above. If you suspect bad weather and are ill-prepared, don’t go.
 Clean and scrape all your windows so that you have maximum visi-
bility. Shovel off the hood and roof as well, so snow doesn’t blow
onto your windshield and the cars around you.
 If you have four-wheel-drive, make sure it is engaged. Remember,
though, that though four-wheel-drive helps you start, it won’t help
you stop.
 If you have rear-wheel drive, carry a set of chains.
When driving on snow and ice, use caution even if your vehicle has four-
wheel-drive. Sport-utility vehicles are great on snow, but on ice they’re
no better than your grandmother’s Oldsmobile. Use these helpful tips
for winter driving in Colorado:
 Allow extra time for the trip. Mountain driving takes longer, espe-
cially during winter.
 Be especially cautious during descents. There’s less margin for
error when gravity gives you an extra push from behind. Don’t,
however, ride the brakes. Carefully shift into a low gear and then
let the car’s engine limit your speed.
 Watch for black ice on shadowy corners. Certain stretches of
mountain road receive almost no sunlight in mid-winter. When
water trickles from sun-warmed areas onto these frigid, shadowy
stretches, look out.
 Beware of ice on bridges. Without warm earth to heat them,
bridges freeze sooner than the rest of the road when the tempera-
ture drops. Bridges that cross mountain streams may also gather
condensation from the waters below.
 Don’t cut corners. Although this holds true in all weather condi-
tions, it is especially important during storms, when snowplows
with enormous blades lurk.
Avoiding rockfall
Rockfall usually happens on warm days during late winter and early
spring, when snowmelt permeates and loosens dirt that holds rock in
place on hillsides. Other times, it happens when snowmelt seeps into
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Colorado

cracks in cliffs, freezes, and then expands at night, wedging loose chunks
of rock. The rocks careen downhill until they come to rest on relatively
flat roads, where they wait around in hopes of destroying rental cars. Be
particularly careful when low sunlight or shadows make it difficult for
drivers to detect foreign objects on the road. Check the clearance on
your vehicle before straddling anything big.
Eluding wildlife
Deer did not evolve to watch out for fast-moving automobiles; nor have
they proven themselves quick studies in the century since Henry Ford
invented the Model A. Roughly 7,000 of Colorado’s half-million deer are
hit by cars every year, causing $3 million in damage.
The best way to avoid deer is to slow down considerably at night, when
it’s nearly impossible to detect their approach. (Deer are most active at
dawn and dusk but can be encountered any time.) During winter, watch
for groups of them browsing just below the snow line. If a deer crosses
the road in front of you, always assume that a second one is trailing.
Deer aren’t the only animals to watch out for. At high elevations, you
may encounter bighorn sheep and elk. Pronghorn antelope roam the
grasslands and valleys. And, though most of the rangeland in Colorado
is fenced, cows do sometimes shamble onto the pavement.
Chapter 7: Getting Around Colorado 63
Driving with chains
Coloradans regard a set of chains as standard equipment for mountain driving; chains
are a worst-case-scenario necessity. If you’re going to be driving the high country in
winter, it’s good to at least consider getting a set. Unfortunately, many car-rental com-
panies won’t allow you to use them; used improperly, they can be destructive and
somewhat dangerous. So if your car is rented and a blizzard moves in, stay inside and
have another cup of hot chocolate. The storm will pass, and the snowplows will show
up eventually.
If you’re using your own vehicle, you can buy chains at most hardware stores, auto-
motive specialty stores, and megamarts. Make absolutely sure that you know the make
and model of your tires — not just your car — so that you get properly sized chains.
Read the instructions very carefully, and if you need a tutorial from the store you buy
them from, don’t be afraid to ask. Installation usually involves laying the chains out in
front of the tires, then driving over them and hooking the ends together, but this varies
from brand to brand.
Remember that chains are only for driving on snow, if you drive them on bare pave-
ment, they’ll absolutely shred your tires.

Getting the best deal on a rental car
Car-rental rates vary even more than airline fares. The price depends on
the size of the car, the length of time you keep it, where and when you
pick it up and drop it off, where you take it, and a host of other factors.
The following list suggests a few ways to save you hundreds of dollars:
 Weekend rates may be lower than weekday rates. If you’re keeping
the car five or more days, a weekly rate may be cheaper than the
daily rate. Ask if the rate is the same for pickup Friday morning as it
is Thursday night.
 Some companies may assess a drop-off charge if you don’t return
the car to the same rental location; others, notably National, don’t.
 Check whether the rate is cheaper if you pick up the car at a loca-
tion in town rather than at the airport.
 Find out whether age is an issue. Many car-rental companies add
on a fee for drivers under 25; some don’t rent to them at all.
 If you see an advertised price in your local newspaper, be sure to
ask for that specific rate; otherwise you may be charged the stan-
dard (higher) rate. Don’t forget to mention membership in AAA,
AARP, and trade unions. These memberships usually entitle you to
discounts ranging from 5 to 30 percent.
 Check your frequent-flier accounts. Not only are your favorite (or at
least most-used) airlines likely to have sent you discount coupons,
but most car rentals add at least 500 miles to your account.
 As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can
make comparison shopping for a car rental much easier. You can
check rates at most of the major agencies’ Web sites. Plus, all the
major travel sites — Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), Expedia
(www.expedia.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), and Smarter Living
(www.smarterliving.com), for example — have search engines that
can dig up discounted car-rental rates. Just enter the car size you
want, the pickup and return dates, and location, and the server
returns a price. You can even make the reservation through any of
these sites.
In addition to the standard rental prices, other optional charges apply to
most car rentals (and some not-so-optional charges, such as taxes). The
Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), which requires you to pay for damage
to the car in a collision, is covered by many credit card companies.
Check with your credit card company before you go so you can avoid
paying this hefty fee (as much as $20 a day).
The car-rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you
harm others in an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm
yourself or your passengers), and personal effects insurance (if your lug-
gage is stolen from your car). Your insurance policy on your car at home

Before you rent that SUV . . .
So, you’re renting a car and heading for the mountains. Any season of the year, you
know you’ll be in some of the most rugged country you’ve ever seen. You’re going to
need an SUV, right?
Not so fast. Unless you know you’re going to spend a lot of time in the most extreme,
backcountry, unpaved parts of the state, you just aren’t going to need an SUV. The
Colorado state government has spent a lot of time and money building good roads to
all the best parts of the state, and this is especially true for all the major tourist areas.
An economy car, wagon, or sedan big enough to comfortably hold you and your stuff
will be just fine. In fact, there are many disadvantages to SUVs when compared to
smaller cars:
 In snow, that four-wheel-drive can help you get going, but it’s not going to help
you stop. And that’s when you really need control. The security that SUVs sup-
posedly give is an illusion, and a snowstorm is no time to discover that you’ve
rented something you can’t control.
 Take it from someone (me!) who’s rolled an SUV on a snowy mountain pass —
they’re top-heavy and very easy to roll. You’re better off with a low center of grav-
ity, front-wheel drive, good tires, and chains.
 Gas prices are higher in the mountains, and there’s a lot of territory to cover. Don’t
spend money needlessly filling the tank of some behemoth that only gets 12 miles
to the gallon. Remember also that more fuel consumption causes more pollution,
and one of Colorado’s greatest assets is the clean air.
 An SUV with a V-6 won’t go appreciably faster over the high passes than a four-
cylinder sedan. Those roads are pretty curvy, so you have to carefully control your
speed anyway, and the extra torque from a big engine can sometimes be a detri-
ment on dirt roads or snow, especially when turning.
 Because you’re sitting higher above the pavement in an SUV, you get the illusion
that you’re moving more slowly than you actually are. It can be really easy to
accelerate beyond a safe speed because you’re not used to the vehicle.
 If, God forbid, you’re in a wreck, an SUV will certainly cause a bigger, more dan-
gerous, and much more expensive wreck than a smaller car will. SUVs are also
harder for other drivers to see around, and on the mountain roads where you’re
dealing with blind curves, rockfall, snow, and other hazards, it’s critical that every-
one on the road be able to see as much as possible.
 The money you save renting, fueling, and insuring a smaller car instead of an SUV
will buy a very nice meal or two. Remember that you can easily rent a Jeep for an
afternoon in places like Ouray and Lake City, if you feel like off-roading there, and
the cost for that is much lower than renting an SUV for the whole trip.
So play it safe, save money, and keep Colorado’s roads safer and cleaner for every-
one. Don’t rent a car bigger than you really need.

probably covers most of these unlikely occurrences. However, if your
own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals or if you don’t have auto
insurance, definitely consider the additional coverage (ask your car-
rental agent for more information). Unless you’re toting around the Hope
diamond, and you don’t want to leave that in your car trunk anyway, you
can probably skip the personal effects insurance, but driving around
without liability or personal accident coverage is never a good idea.
Even if you’re a good driver, other people may not be, and liability
claims can be complicated.
Some companies also offer refueling packages, in which you pay for your
initial full tank of gas up front, and can return the car with an empty gas
tank. The prices can be competitive with local gas prices, but you don’t
get credit for any gas remaining in the tank. If you reject this option, you
pay only for the gas you use, but you have to return the car with a full
tank or face charges of $3 to $4 a gallon for any shortfall. If you usually
run late and a fueling stop may make you miss your plane, you’re a per-
fect candidate for the fuel-purchase option.
Winging It
Flying to airports in western Colorado is an appealing option when
mountain highways become snow-covered or crowded. Many small
Colorado airports offer daily commuter service to and from Denver, and
some have nonstop flights to and from destinations outside Colorado.
The most active in-state carrier, United Express (% 800-241-6522; www.
ual.com), provides commuter service between Denver and Durango,
Grand Junction, Montrose, Steamboat Springs, and Telluride.
The commuter service may be convenient, but it isn’t necessarily cheap.
Round-trip fares from Denver to Durango in the 2005 ski season aver-
aged $250 per person.
If the southwestern part of the state (the Four Corners, Telluride area) is
your only Colorado destination, consider taking advantage of Southwest
Airlines’s (% 505-244-7780; www.southwest.com) low fares and flying
into Albuquerque, New Mexico, then renting a car and driving up.
If you fly all the way to one of Colorado’s mountain towns, you may find
that you don’t need a car at all. Towns such as Aspen, Telluride, Winter
Park, Vail, Crested Butte, and Steamboat all have free bus systems and
are very pedestrian-friendly.
Riding the Rails
Amtrak’s (% 800-USA-RAIL; www.amtrak.com) California Zephyr train
works better as a way of getting to Colorado than as a way to get around it.
The train stops in some intriguing locales, including downtown Denver’s
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Colorado 
66

Union Station, Fraser (near the Winter Park Resort), Glenwood Springs,
and Grand Junction. But if you want to keep your costs down, you’ll prob-
ably have to choose a single destination when traveling by rail, and then
drive or figure out another way to get around from there.
Taking the Bus
Greyhound/Trailways (% 888-454-7277; www.greyhound.com) provides
bus service to most Colorado destinations, though some remote places
aren’t served. Greyhound also sells a Discovery Pass entitling users to
unlimited bus travel in the U.S. for periods ranging from seven days (cost:
$219) to 60 days (cost: $589). Pass holders can get off the bus and sight-
see for a day, and then catch a bus passing through later. The passes can
be bought through a travel agent or online at Greyhound’s Web site.
Before splurging on a Discovery Pass, however, you should ask yourself
two questions: First, given the comfort level, shouldn’t they be paying
you to ride the bus? And second, given some of the tough neighbor-
hoods where these buses tend to stop, are you sure you want to get off?

Booking Your
Accommodations

 Booking the best room
T
he good news is that Colorado has a number of accommodations
selections for you to choose from, no matter what your budget or
interests. This chapter sums up a few of your lodging options in
Colorado and then goes over a few different ways to save money when
you’re ready to book, no matter where you choose to stay.
Lining Up Your Lodging Choices
In Colorado, the accommodations you choose can set the tone for your
vacation. You can have a Western experience at a ranch, simplify life at a
mom and pop motel, luxuriate in one of the fancy hotels, or immerse
yourself in history (and sometimes acquire a temporary family) at a
B&B. I give you the lowdown on the major types of accommodations
available to Colorado visitors in these sections.
Booking a B&B
Colorado has dozens of B&Bs, many of which offer surprisingly good
value. If you take a room with a shared bath — and these are often great
rooms — you can usually stay at a B&B for less than the price of a chain
hotel. You stay in cozy (and often historic) surroundings, enjoy a full
complimentary breakfast, and get to know your hosts and some fellow
travelers. Some B&Bs have ultraluxurious rooms and modern amenities
such as steam showers, jetted baths, and TV/VCRs; others have hardly
changed in a hundred years.

Not all B&Bs allow kids on the premises, so ask about this if you’re plan-
ning your family vacation. You should also avoid B&Bs if you or your
kids are rowdy, if you’re on a tight schedule that means arriving late or
leaving early, or if you simply want some downtime alone.
But if these exceptions aren’t an issue, then bed-and-breakfasts are a
great deal. Many of the state’s B&Bs are written up in this book; others
can be located through the Bed & Breakfast Innkeepers of Colorado
(% 800-265-7696; www.innsofcolorado.org).
Bunking down at a motel
The privately owned mom and pop motels in Colorado are often bright,
clean, and reasonably priced. And they’re only slightly less historic than
the state’s many Victorian B&Bs. Many Colorado motels date to the
1920s and 1930s, when car travel first became popular in the West.
Because they’re old, and because every owner is different, ask to see a
room before settling in. After you’re in, however, you can enjoy the soli-
tude and convenience that a motel provides. Carry your bags a few
yards from your trunk to your room, fetch some ice cubes and a soda,
turn on the TV, and float downstream.
Staying at historic or luxury hotels
Colorado has two world-famous, historic luxury hotels. The Brown
Palace in Denver and The Broadmoor in Colorado Springs have turned
lodging into an art form. Elsewhere in Colorado are many less-expensive
historic hotels that provide equally memorable experiences for travelers.
One caveat: At the most luxurious hotels, whether they’re historic or
not, you not only pay an expensive room rate, but you also have to tip
for the many services provided. At some places, you can’t even get ice
cubes on your own, and you’re discouraged from carrying your own
bags. For people with bulging bank accounts, this can be paradise, but it
may not feel that way if you’re on a more modest budget.
Choosing a chain
Chain hotels are like your favorite pair of socks; they offer comfort with
few surprises. If you’ve stayed often enough at a particular chain, then
you’ll probably know ahead of time what color scheme and amenities to
expect inside your room (although some chains do offer unique proper-
ties). In general, I like staying at chains. They wouldn’t be such a popular
option if their rooms weren’t pleasant. And they’re really great for con-
trol freaks. Yet, they do have their limitations. Colorado offers many
other options that will color your experience in ways that chain hotels
won’t, and it would be a shame not to experience at least a few of these
less-predictable properties. For the Web sites and phone numbers of the
most popular chains in the U.S., see the appendix.
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 69

Going to a guest ranch or dude ranch
With at least 40 officially recognized guest and dude ranches, you could
say that Colorado has made a cottage industry of ranches. Other than
their both being out in the sticks, guest ranches and dude ranches have
little in common. Guest ranches tend to operate more like motels: You
can often pay by the night, and few services are included in your room
rate. Dude ranches are more likely to charge a set amount for an all-
inclusive week that includes accommodations, meals, activities that may
range from a gentle hay ride to robust whitewater rafting, and some-
times even your own horse (for the requisite horseback riding found at
most ranches). Some dude ranches are ultraluxurious; others are rustic
working ranches where you can help with roundups and other chores
(the complete City Slickers works). For more information on dude and
guest ranches in Colorado, contact the Colorado Dude & Guest Ranch
Association (% 970-887-3128; www.coloradoranch.com).
Camping out
Although I don’t cover many Colorado campgrounds in this book, you
should know that they’re great options if you have the right gear.
Campgrounds can be found in Colorado’s national forests, national
parks, state parks, and on private land. Most have drinking water and
toilets; some have showers, too. You can make reservations for some,
but most are first-come, first served. The going rate for a tent site at
most campgrounds is $10 to $15, making this a fabulous option for those
on a shoestring budget. You can also camp for free inside any of the
national forests in Colorado, provided you follow a few simple regula-
tions. Stop by any Forest Service office for details or surf the Internet to
www.fs.fed.us.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. It’s the
rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night.
You sometimes see these rates printed on the fire/emergency exit dia-
grams posted on the back of your door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost always
do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate is surpris-
ingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may be
pleasantly surprised.
In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a room
depends on many factors — chief among them being how you make your
reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with
certain hotels than you can get by yourself. (That’s because the hotel
often gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering his or her busi-
ness toward that hotel.)
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Colorado 
70

Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number may also result in
a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand, the cen-
tral reservations number may not know about discount rates at specific
locations. For example, local franchises may offer a special group rate
for a wedding or family reunion, but they may neglect to tell the central
booking line. Your best bet is to call both the local number and the toll-
free number and see which one gives you a better deal.
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy
rates rise and fall.
In this book, I use dollar signs to help you quickly determine a price
range for a hotel you’re interested in. Table 8-1 shows you what you can
expect in each price category. Prices are based on double occupancy for
one night during high season.

These accommodations are relatively simple
and inexpensive. Rooms are likely to be small,
and televisions are not necessarily provided.

A bit classier, these mid-range accommoda-
tions offer more room, more extras (such as

more convenient location than the preceding

Higher-class still, these accommodations
begin to look plush. Think chocolates on your

ing garages, maybe even expansive views of

$$$$
$176 and up
These top-rated accommodations come with
luxury amenities such as valet parking, on-
premise spas, and in-room hot tubs and CD
players — but you pay through the nose for
them.
Although rates for accommodations in Denver and the rest of the Front
Range remain fairly consistent year-round, the High Country seasons are
summer (Memorial Day through Labor Day) and winter (mid-November
through early April). In between are the shoulder seasons, and these are
the times to get the best rates, the least crowds, and the most tranquil-
ity. Your outdoor recreation options may be spotty, though, because it’s
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 71

usually too cold for anything but skiing, but there’s not much snow. See
Chapter 3 for more information about the seasons and weather in
Colorado.
But even within a given season, room prices are subject to change with-
out notice, so the rates quoted in this book may be different from the
actual rate you receive when you make your reservation. Be sure to
mention membership in AAA, AARP, frequent flyer programs, or any
other corporate rewards programs you can think of — or your Uncle
Joe’s Elks lodge in which you’re an honorary inductee, for that matter —
when you call to book. You never know when the affiliation may be
worth a few dollars off your room rate.
Package tours and escorted tours can be great ways to save on lodging,
as well; see Chapter 6 for more information.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own Web site or through an independent booking
agency (or a fare-service agency such as Priceline). These Internet hotel
agencies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of late, competing
for the business of millions of consumers surfing for accommodations
around the world. This competitiveness can be a boon to consumers
who have the patience and time to shop and compare the online sites
for good deals — but shop you must, for prices can vary considerably
from site to site. And keep in mind that hotels at the top of a site’s listing
may be there for no other reason than that they paid money to get the
placement.
Of the major travel Web sites, Expedia offers a long list of special deals
and virtual tours, or photos of available rooms, so that you can see what
you’re paying for (a feature that helps counter the claims that the best
rooms are often held back from bargain booking Web sites). Travelocity
posts unvarnished customer reviews and ranks its properties according
to the AAA rating system. Orbitz features a handy tool to let you search
for specific amenities you may be interested in. Also reliable are
Hotels.com and Quikbook.com. An excellent free program, TravelAxe
(www.travelaxe.net), can help you search multiple hotel sites at once,
even ones you may never have heard of — and conveniently lists the
total price of the room, including the taxes and service charges. Another
booking site, Travelweb (www.travelweb.com), is partly owned by the
hotels it represents (including the Hilton, Hyatt, and Starwood chains)
and is therefore plugged directly into the hotels’ reservations systems —
unlike independent online agencies, which have to fax or e-mail reserva-
tion requests to the hotel, a good portion of which get misplaced in the
shuffle. More than once, travelers have arrived at the hotel only to be
told that they have no reservation. To be fair, many of the major sites
are undergoing improvements in service and ease of use, and Expedia
will soon be able to plug directly into the reservations systems of many
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Colorado 
72

hotel chains — none of which can be bad news for consumers. In the
meantime, it’s a good idea to get a confirmation number and make a
printout of any online booking transaction.
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline and Hotwire are even better
for hotels than for airfares; with both, you’re allowed to pick the neigh-
borhood and quality level of your hotel before offering up your money.
Priceline’s hotel product even covers Europe and Asia, though it’s much
better at getting 5-star lodging for 3-star prices than at finding anything
at the bottom of the scale. On the down side, many hotels stick Priceline
guests in their least desirable rooms. Be sure to go to the Biddingfor-
Travel Web site (www.biddingfortravel.com) before bidding on a
hotel room on Priceline; it features a fairly up-to-date list of hotels that
Priceline uses in major cities. For both Priceline and Hotwire, you pay
upfront, and the fee is nonrefundable. Note: Some hotels do not provide
loyalty program credits or points or other frequent-stay amenities when
you book a room through opaque online services.
Reserving the best room
After you make your reservation, asking one or two more pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward making sure you get the best room in the
house. Always ask for a corner room. They’re usually larger, quieter, and
have more windows and light than standard rooms, and they don’t
always cost more. Also ask if the hotel is renovating; if it is, request a
room away from the renovation work. Inquire, too, about the location of
the restaurants, bars, and discos in the hotel — all sources of annoying
noise. And if you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to
the front desk. If they have another room, they should be happy to
accommodate you, within reason.

hen I talk about people with special interests, I don’t mean opera

specific advice for families traveling with children, older travelers, per-
sons with a disability, and gay and lesbian travelers.
Traveling with the Brood: 
Advice for Families
If you have enough trouble getting your kids out of the house in the
morning, dragging them thousands of miles away may seem like an insur-
mountable challenge. But family travel can be immensely rewarding,
giving you new ways of seeing the world through smaller pairs of eyes.
Your family can have fun anywhere in the state, but if you want a little
help with your kids now and then, the ski towns are among the best
places to be. In the past 20 years, the ski areas have shifted their focus
from attracting rowdy baby-boomer partiers to luring responsible baby-
boomer families. All the resort areas offer reduced-price lift tickets for
children, and many allow young children to ski and snowboard for free.
The ski zones also have family-friendly activities off the slopes. Most
resort towns now have ice-skating, tubing, and sleigh rides, among other
options. And in summer, certain ski areas become full-on fun centers for
kids, complete with mazes, alpine slides, mountain biking, horseback
riding, and trampolines.

You also benefit from strong support systems for families, such as learn-
to-ski programs for small children, high-quality day care, and baby sit-
ting. None of it is cheap, but it is generally reliable. Day care at a ski area
usually costs around $80 per day (8:30 a.m. – 4:30 p.m.). All-day chil-
dren’s supervised skiing programs, including lessons and lift tickets,
average around $80; add $20 or so for programs that include equipment.
People of all ages get dehydrated, sunburned, and tired much faster in
the mountains. You’ll feel the effects yourself if you don’t drink enough
water, wear sunscreen, and conserve energy. However, your kids are far
more likely than you are to air their discontent. Use these tips to help
keep the kids happy when traveling in the mountains:
 Protect them from dehydration by giving your kids water bottles
and making sure they drink a lot.
 Keep them slathered in sunscreen when you’re spending any time
outdoors, even in winter — children burn far more easily than
adults. Give them floppy hats and sunglasses with 100 percent UV
protection — and encourage them to keep them on. And remember
that most of the skin-cancer-causing sun exposure happens before
age 12.
 Make sure your kids eat regularly when engaged in active pursuits.
Pack healthy snacks such as fruits, vegetables, and trail mix.
 Dress them in layers of synthetic fabrics such as polypropylene
and polar fleece during cold weather. Avoid cotton, which provides
no insulation when wet.
 Set aside an hour or so in the afternoon for resting, whether it’s in
your room or at a scenic, quiet, natural setting.
 Let your kids pick many or most of the activities your family engages
in. Because Colorado has so many activities that are enjoyable for
both parents and kids, this isn’t as painful as it may sound.
 Plan a few Colorado-specific car activities. For example, buy a field
guide and encourage your kids to check off animal species they see
during the trip.
 Take advantage of the kid-friendly activities and programs in many
of the national parks and set aside some time to let your kids expe-
rience some of them.

Making Age Work for You: Advice for Seniors
Though Colorado is plenty rugged, senior travelers won’t have a difficult
time here. Driving in the mountains can be grueling and dangerous for
anyone, regardless of age, but it’s something seniors will want to take
into consideration when planning their vacation here; luckily, trains,
busses, shuttles, and cabs make things worry-free, and many, especially
shuttles, have discounts for seniors.
Mention the fact that you’re a senior citizen when you make your travel
reservations. Although all the major U.S. airlines except America West
have cancelled their senior discount and coupon book programs, many
hotels still offer discounts for seniors. In most cities, people over the age
of 60 qualify for reduced admission to theaters, museums, and other
attractions, as well as discounted fares on public transportation.

Accessing Colorado: Advice for Travelers 
with Disabilities
Most disabilities shouldn’t stop anyone from traveling. There are more
options and resources out there than ever before.
Alas, the backcountry is pretty inhospitable to wheelchairs, but there
has been a major effort in recent years to create wheelchair-accessible
trails. The national parks here (Rocky Mountain National Park, Mesa
Verde National Park, and Great Sand Dunes National Park & Preserve, to
name the biggest) all have activities and facilities for the disabled. Also,
Web sites such as Achievable Concepts (www.achievableconcepts.us)
sell adaptive devices for fishing, hiking, and even water- and snow-skiing!
So don’t discount an active vacation here.
The U.S. National Park Service offers a Golden Access Passport that
gives free lifetime entrance to all properties administered by the
National Park Service — national parks, monuments, historic sites,
recreation areas, and national wildlife refuges — for persons who are
visually impaired or permanently disabled, regardless of age. You may
pick up a Golden Access Passport at any NPS entrance fee area by show-
ing proof of medically determined disability and eligibility for receiving
benefits under federal law. Besides free entry, the Golden Access
Passport also offers a 50 percent discount on federal-use fees charged
for such facilities as camping, swimming, parking, boat launching, and
tours. For more information, go online to www.nps.gov/fees_passes.

Following the Rainbow: Advice for Gay and
Lesbian Travelers
Colorado, contrary to its reputation as a so-called “red state” that’s dom-
inated by the activities of conservative Christian groups, is a very gay-
friendly place. Denver has an enormous gay population centered around
the Capitol Hill and Baker neighborhoods; the bi-weekly H ink Magazine
(% 303-752-4300) is a prominent news and lifestyle publication for
Denver’s gay and lesbian community. Boulder and Aspen are also tradi-
tionally very friendly places — Aspen has a great Gay and Lesbian Ski
Week. In the more remote parts of the state, you may find a little hostil-
ity, but in any of the established ski towns you will feel quite comfort-
able. Colorado as a whole has a proud libertarian tradition that
emphasizes neighborliness over philosophical differences, and all travel-
ers should feel at home here.
The International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA) (% 800-
448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org) is the trade association for

T
his chapter deals with the little things that people tend to put off
until the last minute before leaving on a trip, such as buying trip
insurance, preparing for illness on the road, making sure you stay con-
nected (if you absolutely need to), and even what to expect should your
trip take you through the airport security maze.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking, but expect to pay
between 5 and 8 percent of the cost of the vacation itself. Here is my
advice on all three:
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters to the State Department
declaring your destination unsafe for travel. (Insurers usually won’t
cover vague fears, though, as many travelers discovered who tried
to cancel their trips in October 2001 because they were wary of
flying.)

A good resource is Travel Guard Alerts, a list of companies consid-
ered high-risk by Travel Guard International (www.travelguard.
com). Protect yourself further by paying for the insurance with a
credit card — by law, consumers can get their money back on
goods and services not received if they report the loss within 
60 days after the charge is listed on their credit card statement.
Note: Many tour operators, particularly those offering trips to
remote or high-risk areas, include insurance in the cost of the trip
or can arrange insurance policies through a partnering provider, a
convenient and often cost-effective way to obtain insurance. Make
sure the tour company is a reputable one, however: Some experts
suggest you avoid buying insurance from the tour or cruise com-
pany you’re traveling with, saying it’s better to buy from a third-
party insurer than to put all your money in one place.
 For domestic travel, buying medical insurance for your trip doesn’t
make sense for most travelers. Most existing health policies cover
you if you get sick away from home — but check before you go,
particularly if you’re insured by an HMO.
 Lost luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. On
domestic flights, checked baggage is covered up to $2,500 per tick-
eted passenger. On international flights (including U.S. portions of
international trips), baggage coverage is limited to approximately
$9.07 per pound, up to approximately $635 per checked bag. If you
plan to check items more valuable than the standard liability, see if
your valuables are covered by your homeowner’s policy or get bag-
gage insurance as part of your comprehensive travel-insurance
package. Also, many policies purchased through Travel Guard
International include access to its baggage-tracking service. Don’t
buy insurance at the airport, as it’s usually overpriced. Be sure to
take any valuables or irreplaceable items with you in your carry-on
luggage, as many valuables (including books, money, and electron-
ics) aren’t covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
arrival. Airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found, directly
to your house or destination free of charge.

ers: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.com); Travel

Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 81

Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it 
(of course, last time I checked, the bugs weren’t listening to me any
more than they probably listen to you).
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/
or chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through Medic Alert’s 24-hour
hotline. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance to
Travelers (IAMAT) (% 716-754-4883 or, in Canada, 416-652-0137; www.
iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in the countries
you’re visiting, and lists of local, English-speaking doctors. The United
States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (% 800-311-3435;
www.cdc.gov) provides up-to-date information on health hazards by
region or country and offers tips on food safety.
Staying Connected by Cellphone
For travelers visiting Colorado from other parts of the United States,
keep in mind that just because your cellphone works at home doesn’t
mean it’ll work elsewhere in the country (thanks to our nation’s frag-
mented cellphone system). It’s a good bet that your phone will work in
major cities. But take a look at your wireless company’s coverage map
on its Web site before heading out — T-Mobile, Sprint, and Nextel are
particularly weak in rural areas. If you need to stay in touch at a destina-
tion where you know your phone won’t work, rent a phone that does
from InTouch USA (% 800-872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com) or from
a rental-car location, but beware that you’ll pay $1 a minute or more for
airtime.
Cellphones are darn-near useless in the mountains, except in wealthier
towns such as Aspen and Vail. If you get a signal at all, you’ll probably be
roaming, so think about that when you’re budgeting for your trip.
If you’re venturing deep into national parks or the backcountry, you may
want to consider renting a satellite phone (satphone), which is different
from a cellphone in that it connects to satellites rather than to ground-
based towers. A satphone is more costly than a cellphone but works
where there’s no cellular signal and no towers. Unfortunately, you’ll pay
at least $2 per minute to use the phone, and it only works where you can
see the horizon (that is, usually not indoors). In North America, you can
rent Iridium satellite phones from RoadPost (% 888-290-1606 or 905-
272-5665; www.roadpost.com). InTouch USA offers a wider range of 
satphones but at higher rates. As of this writing, satphones are very
expensive to buy.

82

If you’re not from the U.S., you’ll be appalled at the poor reach of our
GSM (Global System for Mobiles) wireless network, which is used by
much of the rest of the world. Your phone will probably work in most
major U.S. cities; it definitely won’t work in many rural areas. (To find
out where GSM phones work in the U.S., check out www.t-mobile.com/
coverage/national_popup.asp). And you may or may not be able to
send SMS (text messaging) home — something Americans tend to do
less than the rest of the world anyway, for various cultural and techno-
logical reasons. (International budget travelers like to send text mes-
sages home because it’s much cheaper than making international calls.)
Assume nothing — call your wireless provider and get the full scoop. In
a worst-case scenario, you can always rent a phone; InTouch USA deliv-
ers to hotels.
Accessing the Internet away from Home
Travelers have any number of ways to check their e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a PDA
(personal digital assistant) or electronic organizer with a modem —
gives you the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer, you
can still access your e-mail and even your office computer from cyber-
cafes.
It’s hard nowadays to find a city that doesn’t have a few cybercafes.
Although there’s no definitive directory for cybercafes — these are 
independent businesses, after all — places to start looking are www.
cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com.
Aside from formal cybercafes, most youth hostels nowadays have at
least one computer you can get to the Internet on. And most public
libraries offer Internet access free or for a small charge. Avoid hotel
business centers unless you’re willing to pay exorbitant rates.
Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their gates. These kiosks, which you also see in shopping malls, hotel
lobbies, and tourist information offices around the world, give you basic
Web access for a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe
prices. The kiosks’ clunkiness and high price mean they should be
avoided whenever possible.
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet service provider (ISP) if it has
a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account. If your ISP
doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web service
(www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail. For more
flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based e-mail account with
Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com). (Microsoft’s Hotmail is
another popular option, but Hotmail has severe spam problems.) Your
home ISP may be able to forward your e-mail to the Web-based account
automatically.
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 83

If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-
based interface for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from any-
where — even a cybercafe — provided your target PC is on and has an
always-on connection to the Internet (such as with Road Runner cable).
The service offers top-quality security, but if you’re worried about hack-
ers, use your own laptop rather than a cybercafe computer to access the
GoToMyPC system.
If you’re bringing your own computer, the buzzword in computer access
to familiarize yourself with is Wi-fi (wireless fidelity), and more and
more hotels, cafes, and retailers are signing on as wireless hot spots
from where you can get a high-speed connection without cable wires,
networking hardware, or a phone line. You can get a Wi-fi connection one
of several ways. Many laptops sold in the last year have built-in Wi-fi
capability (an 802.11b wireless Ethernet connection). Mac owners have
their own networking technology, Apple AirPort. For those with older
computers, you can purchase an 802.11b/Wi-fi card (around $50) to plug
into your laptop. You sign up for wireless access service much as you do
cellphone service, through a plan offered by one of several commercial
companies that make wireless service available in airports, hotel lob-
bies, and coffee shops, primarily in the United States (followed by the
United Kingdom and Japan). T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/
hotspot) serves up wireless connections at more than 1,000 Starbucks
coffee shops nationwide. Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport
(www.wayport.com) have networks in airports and high-class hotel lob-
bies. IPass providers also give you access to a few hundred wireless
hotel lobby setups. Best of all, you don’t need to be staying at the Four
Seasons to use the hotel’s network; just set yourself up on a nice couch
in the lobby.
The companies’ pricing policies can be byzantine, with a variety of
monthly, per-connection, and per-minute plans, but in general you pay
around $30 a month for limited access — and as more and more compa-
nies jump on the wireless bandwagon, prices are likely to get even more
competitive.
There are also places that provide free wireless networks in cities
around the world. To locate these free hot spots, go to www.personal
telco.net/index.cgi/WirelessCommunities.
If Wi-fi is not available at your destination, most business-class hotels
throughout the world offer dataports for laptop modems, and a few
thousand hotels in the United States and Europe now offer free high-
speed Internet access using an Ethernet network cable. You can bring
your own cables, but most hotels rent them for around $10. Call your
hotel in advance to see what your options are.
In addition, major Internet service providers (ISP) have local access
numbers around the world, allowing you to go online by simply placing
a local call. Check your ISP’s Web site or call its toll-free number and ask
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Colorado 
84

how you can use your current account away from home, and how much
it costs. If you’re traveling outside the reach of your ISP, the iPass net-
work has dial-up numbers in most of the world’s countries. You’ll have
to sign up with an iPass provider, who will then tell you how to set up
your computer for your destination(s). For a list of iPass providers, go to
www.ipass.com and click on Individuals Buy Now. One solid provider is
i2roam (% 866-811-6209 or 920-235-0475; www.i2roam.com).
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.
Keeping Up with Airline Security
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and
two hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an air-
line employee and he or she can probably whisk you to the front of the
line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for
international flights to most countries.)
In 2003, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) phased out
gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And E-tickets have made paper tickets
nearly obsolete. Passengers with E-tickets can beat the ticket-counter
lines by using airport electronic kiosks or even online check-in from
your home computer. Online check-in involves logging on to your air-
line’s Web site, accessing your reservation, and printing out your board-
ing pass — and the airline may even offer you bonus miles to do so! If
you’re using a kiosk at the airport, bring the credit card you used to
book the ticket or your frequent-flier card. Print out your boarding pass
from the kiosk and simply proceed to the security checkpoint with your
pass and a photo ID. If you’re checking bags or looking to snag an exit-
row seat, you can do so using most airline kiosks. Even the smaller air-
lines are employing the kiosk system, but always call your airline to
make sure these alternatives are available. Curbside check-in is also a
good way to avoid lines, although a few airlines still ban curbside check-
in; again, call before you go. (The appendix has airline phone numbers
and Web site addresses.)
Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter than they were during 2001
and 2002, but some doozies remain. If you have trouble standing for long
periods of time, tell an airline employee; the airline will provide a wheel-
chair. Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt
buckles. If you have metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 85

prevent a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only
ticketed passengers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting
disabled passengers or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you can’t.
The general rule is that sharp things are out, nail clippers are okay, and
food and beverages must be passed through the X-ray machine — but
that security screeners can’t make you drink from your coffee cup. Bring
food in your carry-on rather than checking it, as explosive-detection
machines used on checked luggage have been known to mistake food
(especially chocolate, for some reason) for bombs. Travelers in the
United States are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a personal item such as
a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders can stuff all sorts of
things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in it, it’s still considered
a personal item. The TSA has issued a list of restricted items; check its
Web site (www.tsa.gov/public/index.jsp) for details.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow
screeners to open and re-lock a checked bag if hand-searching is neces-
sary. Look for Travel Sentry certified locks at luggage or travel shops
and Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.
com). These locks, approved by the TSA, can be opened by luggage
inspectors with a special code or key. For more information on the locks,
visit www.travelsentry.org. If you use something other than TSA-
approved locks, your lock will be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent
needs to hand-search your luggage.

The Front Range

In this part . . . 
T
he term “Front Range” refers both to the ﬁrst large chain
of mountains you encounter when traveling from the
east; more often, though, it refers to the urban communities
along the foothills of those mountains. Chances are this is
where you’ll start exploring the state. This part tells you how
to get to Denver, Boulder, and Colorado Springs, and all the
fun you’re going to have there. I also throw in a few cool side
trips to some of the state’s former boomtowns, where you
can still pan for gold, and some gambling zones, where you
can also try to strike it rich.

I
f your knowledge of Denver includes the phrase “overgrown cow
town,” then let this chapter direct you to the modern metropolis that
the city is today. Old mining towns up in the high country have turned
into multisport resort towns, and Denver is the gateway to all the out-
door adventure you can dream of, winter or summer. Denver gets more
days of sunshine per year (over 300) than even San Diego, so you can
play outdoors year-round. (Dress warmly in winter, though; the sun
might be shining, but it does get cold.) If the weather inside is more to
your liking, world-class orchestras, museums, and opera and theatre
companies will keep you busy, and touring rock acts, jazz combos, and
Broadway shows are always in the mix. This chapter offers details on
much of what Denver has to offer — in addition to my recommendations
for places to stay and eat.
Getting There
Although Denver’s airport is a good distance from the city’s downtown
core, flying into Denver remains the most efficient manner of getting
there. Of course, having a car to help you navigate the city is a good
idea, so if driving to Denver is an option for you, you can save on rental-
car costs.
Arriving by air
After a rocky beginning, Denver International Airport (% 800-AIR-2-
DEN [800-247-2336]; www.flydenver.com) — popularly known as DIA —
now earns accolades for both efficiency and capacity. Located 23 miles
northeast of downtown Denver, the $4.3 billion airport has 94 gates and
5 runways in a 53-square-mile area. Nearly all the major domestic airlines

fly into DIA, including Alaska, America West, American, Continental,
Delta, JetBlue, Northwest, United, and US Airways. A handful of inter-
national airlines also offer flights in and out of Denver, including Air
Canada, British Airways, and Qantas. (See the Quick Concierge appendix
for contact information for these airlines and more.)
The airport’s centerpiece is the 1.5-million-square-foot Jeppesen
Terminal, whose roof consists of 15 acres of Teflon-coated, woven fiber-
glass that allows 10 percent of visible light to pass through it. From
above, the terminal looks like a city of white tents, though its profile was
designed to echo the peaks of the Front Range on the western horizon.
The terminal’s interior, during daylight hours especially, feels light, spa-
cious, and comfortable.
From Jeppesen Terminal, passengers travel to three concourses, two of
which are accessible only via an underground train. (You can also reach
Concourse A via a pedestrian bridge that actually passes over a runway.)
The train runs every two minutes, and the longest ride lasts under five
minutes. The train does, however, get crowded. And if you’re late for 
a flight or trying to make a close connection, it can be disconcerting 
to take an escalator downstairs and then have to wait around on a 
platform.
When flying out of DIA, allow a little extra time both for the train and for
the trip on foot — or via moving walkway — across one or more airport
concourses, the longest of which is 3,300 feet. Also, if you get claustro-
phobic, bear in mind that the middle car on each train is usually less
crowded than the end cars.
Despite having one of the world’s most technologically advanced bag-
gage-handling systems, DIA is simply too big for the airlines to instantly
produce the baggage you check. You usually have to wait a bit at the
carousels, which are located on Terminal Level 5, right across from the
hotel and ground transportation information boards. If you’re taking
commercial transportation to your hotel, grab your bags and then head
out the doors on Level 5 to the curbside pick-up areas. If someone in a
private vehicle is picking you up, go to Level 4.
Assistance is readily available, and you should have no problems getting
answers to questions while at the airport: In addition to DIA information
booths in the main terminal and on all three concourses, the Denver
Metro Convention and Visitors Bureau has its own information booths in
the main terminal and on Concourse B.
For general airport information, call the Denver International Airport
Information Line at % 800-AIR-2-DEN, 800-688-1333, or 303-342-2200.
For ground transportation, the number is % 303-342-4059. When you
have your bags and your bearings, you can choose from a number of
options to get you from DIA to your accommodations.

Renting a car
All the major rental-car companies are represented at DIA, so you’re
bound to find your favorite here. The list includes Advantage, Alamo,
Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, Hertz, National, Payless, and Thrifty.
For information on contacting individual car-rental agencies, see the
Quick Concierge appendix.
To reach the downtown Denver area, exit the airport onto Trussville
Street and go southwest for about 1⁄4 mile. Bear left onto Pena Boulevard
and go southwest for another 10 miles. Continue on the ramp and go
southwest for 11⁄4 miles. Follow I-70 west for 9 miles, and take the exit that
brings you closest to your destination.
Taking a shuttle or cab
Dozens of private companies provide shuttle service from DIA to points
throughout Colorado. One reliable service linking DIA with Denver’s
downtown area is SuperShuttle (% 800-525-3177 or 303-370-1300; www.
supershuttle.com). You don’t need a reservation to take SuperShuttle
from the airport to your hotel. Tell the representative at the Super
Shuttle desk near baggage claim that you’d like a ride. You’ll probably
have to wait 20 to 30 minutes, and the driver may drop off other passen-
gers before you, but the per-person cost to most downtown hotels is a
reasonable $18. For your return trip to the airport, make sure to call
SuperShuttle for a reservation at least 24 hours in advance.
Three taxi companies are licensed to operate out of Denver International
Airport: Freedom Cab (% 303-292-8900), Metro Taxi (% 303-333-3333),
and Yellow Cab (% 303-777-7777). All three charge a flat fee of $46
(including a $3 gate fee) to go from DIA to the downtown area. If you’re
traveling with a group of three to five people (the maximum that most
companies will take), a cab affords you a per-person price second only
to the skyRide public bus.
Hopping a bus
The cheapest way to reach many destinations in Denver and Boulder is
via a public skyRide bus (% 303-299-6000 and then speed dial 1-2-1;
www.rtd-denver.com/skyRide). Between 4 a.m. and midnight, skyRide
buses — part of the city’s public Regional Transportation District (RTD)
system — depart DIA’s Level 5 (outside doors 506 or 511) at least once
every hour. From DIA, the buses service 28 skyRide stops throughout
the Denver metropolitan area, including 18 free park-and-ride lots, and
provide links to other RTD buses and light-rail.
At a cost of $6 to $10, skyRide may work for you if you’re on a tight
budget, have time to spare, and are traveling light. (At DIA, skyRide 
drivers may assist you with luggage, but don’t count on this service 
if you transfer to another RTD bus.) If you’re considering using RTD, 
you can get more information by visiting the skyRide counter in the
Chapter 11: Denver 91

ground-transportation area of Level 5, or by going to the RTD’s Web site.
If you do decide to take skyRide, bring plenty of small bills and quarters,
because drivers cannot make change.
Arriving by car
Interstate 70, which passes within a few miles of Denver International
Airport, is the principal east-west corridor through both Denver and
Colorado. En route from St. Louis to southern Utah, it passes a few miles
north of Denver’s downtown and then climbs into the Colorado high
country, passing Golden, Summit County, Vail, Glenwood Springs, and
Grand Junction, among other towns, before crossing the Utah border.
Interstate 25, which slices through the west side of the city, travels north
and south between New Mexico and Wyoming. Take I-25 to reach Denver
from the major Front Range cities of Colorado Springs and Fort Collins.
To get to Denver from Boulder, head southeast to I-25 on U.S. 36. U.S. 285
goes northeast to Denver from Salida.
Riding in (Not on horseback)
With more than 60 daily arrivals and departures at its Denver terminal 
at 19th and Arapahoe streets, Greyhound (% 800-231-2222; www.grey
hound.com) provides a variety of options for reaching destinations both
inside and outside Colorado. This terminal, located in the Central
Business District, is convenient to city bus and light-rail service. You’ll
also find taxis readily available outside the station.
If you choose to come into Denver via train, Amtrak runs two routes —
both go from Chicago to various destinations in California — that pass
through Denver. With such massive distances between Denver and
points east or west, delays are frequent and can be frustrating, but 
this remains, by far, the most relaxing and civilized way to travel. The
Amtrak trains stop at historic Union Station, at 17th and Wynkoop
streets (% 800-USA-RAIL or 303-825-2583; www.amtrak.com) in Lower
Downtown.
Denver Neighborhoods
If you get lost in Denver, look for the Rocky Mountains, visible 14 miles
west of town. As long as some of the city’s taller buildings don’t block
your view, you should always be able to figure out which way is west.
Denver’s street grid can be confusing, especially going to or from the
downtown area: The original streets of the Denver City Mining Camp par-
alleled Cherry Creek; later, when it became clear that the town was no
flash-in-the-pan, city planners designed newer neighborhoods around
the same north-south-east-west grid that exists in Chicago and most
other western cities (see the nearby “Denver Neighborhoods” map).

Denver Neighborhoods

Historic areas such as the Auraria Campus, Downtown, and Lower
Downtown (locally referred to as LoDo) are on the older, angled grid.
The Five Points area is situated on the old grid’s northeast corner.
Uptown starts at Broadway, just east of Downtown, and stretches east to
City Park. The west side of Denver’s central downtown area is bordered
by Speer Boulevard, which parallels Cherry Creek (the actual creek, not
the neighborhood). Many other intriguing neighborhoods are located
just south of Downtown, on the newer, north-south grid. Heading south
from Downtown, zigzagging slightly to the east and west, you’ll pass
Part III: The Front Range 
94
Digging Denver’s history
When gold was discovered along the banks of Cherry Creek in the summer of 1858,
the plains along the Front Range were inhabited mostly by buffalo and a sea of grass
that stretched across Kansas Territory to Missouri. The Cheyenne and Arapaho nations
followed the buffalo herds, and in the mountains, the Ute tribes hunted and gathered.
A few trappers and frontiersmen crossed through the area, but winters on the high
plains were so harsh, and the land so dry, that no one thought of trying to settle the
place — that is, until the glitter of gold took hold and precipitated the Gold Rush of ’59.
A couple of hardscrabble camps were assembled at the confluence of Cherry Creek
and the south fork of the Platte River: Auraria was considered the more respectable
of the two; Denver City, on the eastern side of Cherry Creek, was believed to be one
of the most dangerous towns in America, with speculators, gamblers, and other unsa-
vory types collecting there to take advantage — any way they could! — of the new-
found, largely unregulated wealth hidden in the creeks trickling down from the
mountains. Through a shady, back-room deal, Denver City was granted a stagecoach
stop, and the resulting economic advantages allowed it to swallow Auraria and
become the boomtown of Denver.
No one foresaw, of course, the skyscrapers that now dominate the Platte River Valley
and the suburbs that stretch literally to every horizon. Denver’s spectacular growth
has been accomplished in fits and starts, though, and its history provides the very def-
inition of a boomtown. The Gold Rush was short-lived, and Denver actually dwindled
in population during the 1860s. The 1870s, though, brought a silver boom that lasted
for 20 years, oversaw the building of the mighty mansions of Capitol Hill, and estab-
lished the names of Moffat and Tabor as local royalty. When the silver market crashed
in the 1890s, though, Denver again had to stop growing and just survive, while the
mining camps in the mountains turned to ghost towns.
World War II brought a new boom: air transportation and the military-industrial com-
plex, which stretched the population eastward and began the urban sprawl that now
blankets the valley. In the 1970s, oil became the commodity of the day and built the
giant towers in the downtown area, until the market crashed in 1984. The ensuing
recession lasted ten years, but was followed by the high-tech bubble of the 1990s
when the Lower Downtown area, decaying since the end of the silver boom, was
reborn as LoDo, the nighttime playground of the hipsters who came to work in software
and telecommunications.

through the Capitol Hill, Cherry Creek, and Washington Park neighbor-
hoods, each with its own unique personality. The neighborhoods don’t
have perfect dividing lines, and Denverites sometimes disagree as to
where one begins and another one ends. Still, the descriptions in this
section should give you some idea where you’re going, and what to
expect when you get there.
Downtown (the Central Business District)
To find this area, head for the skyscrapers on 16th, 17th, and 18th
streets between Broadway and Lawrence. Built primarily in the 1970s
and 1980s, these tall buildings define the Denver skyline and make it
easy to forget that this is also one of the oldest parts of town. Be sure to
see the district’s remaining 19th-century buildings, including the Brown
Palace Hotel and the Trinity Methodist Church, as well as Larimer
Square, as you tour the area.
On weekends, business travelers vacate the area’s many luxury hotels,
only to be replaced by tourists arriving for shows in the Denver Perform-
ing Arts Complex, shopping in the 16th Street Marketplace, and games at
Coors Field, all of which are within walking distance of this section of
town. In spite of the tourist influx, the area becomes less crowded and
more relaxed on weekends.
Lower Downtown (LoDo)
Once a blighted area of abandoned warehouses, LoDo’s modern heyday
began with the opening of the Wynkoop Brewing Company in 1988 and
exploded soon after Coors Field was completed, at a cost of $215 million,
in 1995. Parking for this redbrick, state-of-the-art ballpark was scattered
throughout the LoDo area, so fans of the Colorado Rockies baseball
team began wandering through the neighborhood, pausing for food,
drink, and entertainment along the way. LoDo, which runs from Speer
Boulevard northeast to 20th Street and from Market Street northwest to
Wynkoop Street, is the center of the city’s nightlife and now houses
dozens of bars, brewpubs, restaurants, and galleries. Many of these busi-
nesses occupy restored brick warehouses with high ceilings, hardwood
floors, and (sometimes) rooftop seating. The area has 127 historic struc-
tures, including Union Station. Many date back to the 1870s, when the
railroad first reached Denver. LoDo is definitely a nightlife destination,
though — if you’re looking for serious window-shopping and cafe hang-
outs, head for Cherry Creek instead.
The Golden Triangle
This once-derelict neighborhood just south of Downtown, bounded by
Colfax Avenue, Broadway, and Speer Boulevard, has undergone a facelift
and is being transformed into a loft community, popular with urban hip-
sters, and thus is now home to some of the hottest new restaurants and
clubs. Recent and ongoing additions to the Denver Public Library and
Denver Art Museum make this the most architecturally interesting and
vibrant neighborhood in the city.
Chapter 11: Denver 95

Uptown
The highlights of this neighborhood, stretching from Broadway east to
York Street and from 23rd Street south to Colfax Avenue, are its lovely
homes. Before the price of silver crashed in the 1890s, the city’s first mil-
lionaires built ornate Victorian and Queen Anne–style homes in this area
west of Denver. The area became run down in the 1950s, but many of its
houses have been lovingly restored. New restaurants, bars, and coffee
shops popped up to serve this recently gentrified area, particularly
along 17th Street. The west side of Uptown borders City Park, home to
the Denver Zoo and Denver Museum of Nature and Science. The south-
ern border of this neighborhood is a gritty but interesting strip of Colfax
Avenue, where you can get tattooed, buy vinyl records, load up on
incense, and practice kung fu.
Capitol Hill
Capitol Hill, which spans from Broadway east to York Avenue and from
Colfax Avenue south to Sixth Avenue, has impressive Victorian homes
like the ones in the Uptown neighborhood to its north. It serves as the
center of the city’s gay and lesbian community, as well as Denver’s
bohemian scene — with lots of funky shops and cafes along 13th Avenue
and down Broadway, and counter-cultural hipsters living in the cheap
apartments nearby. Capitol Hill also is home to some of Denver’s best-
known landmarks, including the State Capitol, whose gold dome is 
visible for miles, and the expansive Civic Center Park, which has a sym-
metrical, European-style design. Along the park’s edges are the Denver
Public Library, the Denver Art Museum, and the Colorado History
Museum. The U.S. Mint, recently closed to tourists due to security
issues, is a block away from the park.
Cherry Creek
Fifty years ago few people would have foreseen Cherry Creek, which
runs from East First Avenue north to East Eighth Avenue and from
Downing Street east to Colorado Street, encompassing Denver’s wealthi-
est neighborhoods. Located near the city dump, it was the place where
returning World War II veterans built bungalows and quietly raised fami-
lies. Today, most of those bungalows have been replaced by glitzy prefab
condominiums; the Denver Country Club, which counts some of the
city’s financial elite among its members, is located nearby; and the chic
stores in the Cherry Creek Mall attract shoppers from throughout the
region. Just north of the mall, in Cherry Creek North, you find tree-lined
streets with expensive galleries, boutiques, spas, and restaurants.
Recently, on-street parking here ceased to be free: Parking is by permit
only in the residential areas, and you must look for the kiosks or elec-
tronic pay stations in the shopping district.
Central Platte Valley
After a flood destroyed what was left of the railyards in the 1960s, the
Central Platte Valley languished in decay. Over time, though, the city
Part III: The Front Range 
96

built a system of parks and greenways that make this an oasis of green
among the concrete canyons. From the kayaking course in Confluence
Park and the newer Commons Park nearby, you can walk, bike, or jog via
the Platte River and Cherry Creek greenways to many other city parks,
and even to Waterton Canyon in the foothills. Some of Denver’s biggest
attractions have sprouted alongside the river, including the Pepsi
Center, a 20,000-seat arena for the city’s pro hockey and basketball
teams; Invesco Field at Mile High, a 76,000-seat football stadium for the
Denver Broncos (just west of I-25); the Six Flags Elitch Gardens theme
park; and Colorado’s Ocean Journey, a $93 million aquarium.
Other Denver neighborhoods
The neighborhoods described in the preceding sections tend to attract
the most attention from tourists, but they’re just a few of the many
intriguing downtown spots. Some others that merit attention are
 Far East Center, a strip of Federal Boulevard between West
Alameda and West Mississippi avenues, has a large Asian-American
population and some fine Vietnamese and Thai restaurants.
 Five Points, which runs west from Park Avenue to Downing Street
and southeast from 38th to 23rd streets, is a center for Denver’s
African-American population and home to the Black American West
Museum and Heritage Center.
 Denver’s Latino population operates many shops, restaurants, and
stores in the La Alma/Lincoln Park Area, on Santa Fe Drive
between West Colfax and West Sixth avenues.
 The Washington Park area is alive with young professionals of all
ethnicities who have bought homes around Denver’s largest park.
The area, known to locals as Wash Park, spans from Broadway east
to University Boulevard, and from Alameda Avenue south to Evans
Avenue. Washington Park itself is a glorious piece of greenspace
with two large lakes (popular with local fishers) and is the place to
rollerblade, sunbathe, and play soccer and volleyball.
Getting Information after You Arrive
The best source for area information is the Denver Metro Convention
and Visitors Bureau, 918 16th Street Mall at Champa Street (% 800-233-
6837; www.denver.org). It’s open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. and, from May to September, on Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 
1:30 p.m.
The Visitors Bureau also operates information booths in the main termi-
nal and in Concourse B at Denver International Airport. You can also get
information during business hours inside the State Capitol (% 303-866-
2604), at the corner of Broadway and Colfax Avenue. The public entrance
to the capitol is at street level on the building’s south (14th Street) side.
Chapter 11: Denver 97

If, for some reason, you lose your bearings at Cherry Creek Mall, 3000
E. First Ave. (% 303-388-3900), you can stop at an information booth
there.
Getting Around Denver
No matter how you choose to travel, Denver is a fairly user-friendly city.
Of course, any major city always has a few tie-ups. Whether you’re trav-
eling by car, bus, train, or even on foot, here’s how to avoid the ones in
Denver.
By mass transit
An immense bus and light-rail system known as the Regional Trans-
portation District (RTD) serves Denver, Boulder, and other communities.
Bussing it
With 179 bus routes going to 41 municipalities, the system can be tricky
to figure out if you’re using it for the first time. You can try using the
route planner on RTD’s Web site (www.rtd-denver.com), but you stand
a better chance of sorting things out if you talk to a warm-blooded infor-
mation specialist at the RTD hotline (% 800-366-7433). Printed bus 
and rail schedules are available at Market Street Station, on the corner
of Market and 16th Street; Civic Center Station, on the corner of
Broadway and 16th Street; and at many area King Soopers and Safeway
supermarkets.
Running between Civic Center Station and Union Station is the 16th
Street Mall, the anchor and center of the entire transportation system.
The free shuttle buses along the Mall are far and away the best way to
get around Downtown and LoDo, and they connect all the other bus and
light-rail lines. During peak hours, you seldom have to wait more than a
minute or two for a bus; at off hours, the wait can be a little longer. By
using these buses, which run from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m. daily, you can shorten
your walking distance to many of the prime attractions in the downtown
area while sparing yourself parking headaches.
Also, the RTD-operated B-Line runs between Downtown and the Denver
Tech Center along Colorado Boulevard, stopping in Cherry Creek along
the way and saving you the hassle of dealing with traffic in the busiest
parts of the metro area. It’s a no-brainer, especially if you have business
in the Tech Center.
If you plan to take in cultural attractions throughout the downtown area,
pay $16 for a daylong pass on the Cultural Connection Trolley (% 303-
289-2841). Every hour between 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. (last trolley
departs at 3:30 p.m.), the Gray Line–operated trolley stops at Denver’s
prime tourist attractions, including Cherry Creek Shopping Center,
Ocean’s Journey, Union Station, and Larimer Square. The trolley oper-
ates only from Memorial Day through Labor Day.
Part III: The Front Range 
98

If you’re staying in Denver but want to visit Boulder, the regional B bus
(not related to the just-mentioned B-Line) runs from Market Street
Station or Union Station to the Boulder Station in downtown Boulder in
less than an hour, passing near all the attractions in the University of
Colorado/Chatauqua Park area. At rush hour it’s packed with com-
muters, but lots of buses run during those times, and it’s the only way to
avoid the often hellish traffic on U.S. 36 and I-25. Pay attention to the
schedule, though, especially if you’re barhopping on Boulder’s Pearl
Street Mall — the last bus leaves Boulder at 1 a.m.
Riding the light-rail train
Also worth trying is the light-rail train into the Platte Valley. From Union
Station, you can take the train to stations at Invesco Field at Mile High,
the Pepsi Center, Six Flags Elitch Gardens, and Colorado’s Ocean
Journey. This line makes nearly all the major downtown attractions
easily accessible, via mass transit, from downtown hotels. In general, the
light-rail route is easier to grasp than the bus lines. The color-coded
routes are posted at the stops, and they’re relatively easy to decipher.
The cost for local light-rail or bus routes is $1.25 for adults, 60¢ for sen-
iors and youths ages 6 to 18. Express routes cost $2.75 for adults, $1.35
for seniors and youths. Regional buses are $3.75 for adults, $1.85 for sen-
iors and youths. If you’re taking the train, bring plenty of quarters and
$1 bills for the ticket machines at each stop. The machines provide no
more than $1 in change.
After buying your ticket, you need to validate it before getting on the
train. If you’re taking the bus, put your exact fare into the box next to the
driver, and ask for a free transfer slip if you need to change buses. The
light-rail lines operate from about 6 a.m. to midnight, depending on
where you board the last train.
By taxi
Taxi drivers in Denver charge an initial drop-flag fee of $1.80, plus $1.60
per mile. You’re allowed to hail a cab in Denver, but unless you’re down-
town and have some luck, the attempt could be a Hail Mary. This is espe-
cially true on weekends, after the bars have shut down for the night. You
can find a reliable taxi stand at the Westin Tabor Center, though, on
Lawrence Street between the Mall and 17th Street. Cab companies with
large fleets are Freedom Cab (% 303-292-8900), Metro Taxi (% 303-333-
3333), Yellow Cab (% 303-777-7777), and Zone Cab (% 303-444-8888).
By car
You can walk and use mass transit to reach the major attractions in the
downtown area — indeed, it’s much cheaper and easier for you to do 
so — but you need a car if you hope to take in all the sights in the outly-
ing communities and the mountains.
Chapter 11: Denver 99

Driving is surprisingly manageable in LoDo and the Central Business
District, which are on Denver’s oldest grid. This grid consists of num-
bered streets running northwest and southeast, intersected at right
angles by named arteries such as Market Street (one-way northeast),
Lawrence Street (one-way northeast), and Larimer Street (one-way
southwest). Traffic usually moves well, especially on weekends. Speer
Boulevard is far and away the best way to get from Downtown to Cherry
Creek (see the “Denver Accommodations & Dining” map later in 
this chapter), and in the Uptown area, the one-way thoroughfares of
17th and 18th avenues are much faster and easier to travel than the
clogged, two-way Colfax Avenue.
Most streets in the downtown core are one-way, so you may have to go
around a block or two in order to get to your destination.
The drawback to driving in the downtown neighborhoods is trying to
find inexpensive parking. Daily parking usually costs between $5 and
$10, with hourly rates sometimes running $2.50 or more. Some hotels
charge upwards of $15 per night for valet parking. If you manage to find
a parking space on the street, the meter usually costs 25¢ for every 15
minutes, with a two-hour maximum in effect. If you must park here, bring
quarters for meters and small bills for the self-pay lots.
You’ll have an easier time parking, but you can expect to encounter
more intense traffic as you leave the downtown area and move from the
old grid to the new grid. The new grid consists of numbered avenues
that run east and west, intersected by named streets and boulevards
that run north and south.
If an address is on a numbered road, check out whether the road is a
street or an avenue, so you know which grid it’s on. Numbered streets
are on the old grid; numbered avenues are on the new one. Population
growth has been poorly managed over the last ten years, and some of
the main streets on the new grid, such as Colorado Boulevard and Colfax
Avenue, get extremely clogged during rush hour. All the downtown area
turns into a parking lot after baseball games, and, as in most major
cities, freeway traffic can slow dramatically during rush hour.
A highway construction project known as T-Rex will slow traffic on I-25
until 2006. Traveling south on I-25 from Central Downtown to the Tech
Center area can be particularly agonizing during peak periods.
On foot
By and large, Denver is a great place to walk. Hundreds of miles of bike
and walking paths wend their way through the city, with the majority of
these in the parks and on old rail grades paralleling the city’s water-
ways. If you’re walking for pleasure only, the trails along the South Platte
River and Cherry Creek are especially nice. They’re mostly below street
level, along rivers that, except for the occasional bobbing vodka bottle
or half-submerged shopping cart, are remarkably clean. If transportation

is your goal, you can easily reach the popular tourist destinations in the
Central Business District, LoDo, and Capitol Hill areas on foot, especially
if you occasionally jump on a free bus on the 16th Street Mall to shorten
the distances. However, you need a car to reach most other areas in and
around the city.
As for problem areas, don’t go too far east on Colfax Avenue — but don’t
shun Colfax, either. The stretch between Broadway and University has
some lively music venues (including the revamped Ogden Theater and
Fillmore Auditorium) and restaurants, and it passes between the Capitol
Hill and Uptown neighborhoods, which boast many of the city’s historic
homes. The crime-riddled spots on Colfax are east of Colorado
Boulevard, where there are few tourist attractions.
Where to Stay
As in most major cities, staying in downtown Denver on a weeknight is
expensive. The Central Business District and LoDo areas (see the map,
“Denver Accommodations & Dining”) are long on luxury hotels for busi-
ness travelers and short on budget accommodations for families.
Weeknight prices often run $175 to $225, including parking. On Friday
and Saturday nights, however, business travelers vacate the Central
Business District, and you can usually find a luxurious room for under
$100. The lower end of the rack rates I list in this section tend to be
weekend rates, while the higher end is what you pay on a weekday.
If you have to be in downtown Denver on a weeknight, look for a small
room at one of the area’s bed-and-breakfasts. These often cost under
$100 and include free breakfast. Plus, they’re nice. Prices for rooms drop
as you move farther from Downtown. Accommodations in the Cherry
Creek area, roughly ten minutes from Downtown by car, cost about $20
to $30 dollars less than Downtown and have free parking. If you need a
motel or hotel room in the $70 range, your best bet may be to surf the
Internet for deals at the many chain hotels in the suburbs. (See Chap-
ter 8 for more information on getting good hotel deals and for an expla-
nation of the dollar signs that indicate the price ranges.)
Chapter 11: Denver 101
What’s up with the diagonal crosswalks?
Downtown Denver has something you don’t see in most American cities: diagonal
crosswalks. These are known as “Barnes Dances,” after Henry Barnes, the Denver
traffic engineer who invented them in the late 1940s. Basically, car traffic in all direc-
tions is stopped, allowing pedestrians to cross in any direction they choose. Go ahead,
try it; it’s not jaywalking, and it’s perfectly safe. Not coincidentally, the Barnes Dance
led to another Denver innovation that caught on around the world: timed traffic lights.

Brown Palace Hotel
$$$$
Central Business District
The Brown Palace has always been the place to stay in Denver, attracting
guests as varied as Dwight Eisenhower and the Beatles. The atrium inside
the hotel is one of those rare architectural masterpieces that are nearly as
breathtaking as a natural wonder. A skylight illuminates eight stories of
balconies with cast-iron grillwork; floors and columns of white onyx; and
a tea area where either a piano or lute player provides music daily. The
hotel is shaped like a triangle, and it’s old (opened in 1892), so the rooms
come in a variety of shapes and sizes. That said, the rooms are quite com-
fortable and decorated in either a Victorian or Art Deco style. The hotel
promotes itself not only to wealthy and expense-account travelers but also
to regular people hoping to create their own memories, and a number of
weekend package deals bring the hotel’s prices into the lower reaches of
the earth’s atmosphere. But if you can’t stay here, definitely peek inside at
the lobby — or better yet, stop by between noon and 4 p.m. during the
week for afternoon tea in the lobby’s tea room.

Castle Marne Bed & Breakfast
$$–$$$$
Uptown
One of Denver’s most famous architects, William Lang, designed this 1889
stone mansion, which looks and feels like a living museum (it’s a registered
National Landmark). Everywhere you look, you’ll find something stunning,
whether it’s the circular stained-glass window on the stairs, wainscoting of
Honduran mahogany, floors of quarter-sawn oak, or the specially textured
walls in the dining room (which are protected by the U.S. Department of
the Interior). The guest rooms are equally beautiful and several rooms
have private balconies with hot tubs. Fortunately for the guests, all the
beauty doesn’t make things seem stuffy or tense — innkeepers Jim and
Diane Peiker somehow keep things down-to-earth, making this a winning
experience in every way. Note: The inn is entirely nonsmoking, so if you
like to light up, look elsewhere. Children age ten and under are not per-
mitted, making this a lousy choice for families but a great one for couples
looking for a more tranquil atmosphere.

Of all the luxury hotels in the Central Business District, this 19-story build-

best for families. Kids in particular seem to enjoy the suite rooms, the in-
room Nintendo games, and the pool and spa. All accommodations here are
one- or two-bedroom suites, with separate living areas (with pullout sofas,
refrigerators, and microwaves) and sleeping areas. Because the hotel’s
complimentary breakfast combines buffet and table service, you can
locate a few favorite items for your kids, then leave the rest of the work to
a professional server. For an extra $10, you can use the 65,000-square-foot
Denver Athletic Club attached to the hotel.

The Holiday Chalet
$$–$$$
Capitol Hill
This oasis of Victorian propriety amid the neon on Colfax Avenue is one of
the best deals in Denver. Built as a mansion in 1896, the B&B now offers 12
comfortable and family-friendly minisuites. The minisuites were added in
the 1950s and are starting to feel historic themselves — especially the
kitchens, which have tile floors and gas stoves. The rooms also have
antiques, desks, and TVs with VCRs; a few rooms have sunrooms and two
have fireplaces. Ice cream socials are held in summer and barbecue grills
are available for guests’ use. If you plan to stay a while, bring your pet (for
an extra $5 a day), your kids (baby-sitting can be arranged), and your food,
and take advantage of a $500 weekly rate. If traffic noise bothers you, ask
for a room on the side away from Colfax.

Hotel Monaco Denver

Downtown
This hotel, which oozes 1990s excess, sports lavishly decorated rooms,
whose amenities include CD stereos, terrycloth robes, and Starbucks
coffee. And if you’re lonely, the hotel will send up a free “companion gold-
fish,” although at these rates, they should send a dolphin. The location is
great, though, for both downtown business trips and casual travelers look-
ing for LoDo nightlife. And the bar on the ground floor is top-notch.

First Avenue from the Cherry Creek shopping center and easy walking dis-
tance from all the retail and dining that make the neighborhood what it is.
The rooms are all sumptuously appointed with dark wood, granite sur-
faces, enormous flat-screen TVs, and, on higher west-side floors, stunning
views of the mountains. The Presidential suite is designed for serious busi-
ness, and Mirepoix, a hot new restaurant, is on the ground floor.

If you want to stay in LoDo, look no farther than this historic hotel in the
heart of it all. The silver-boom building is sumptuously decked out in
Victorian appointments, though many of the rooms have been redone in
glorious Art Deco. The Deco rooms, in fact, have recently been renovated
to include large-screen plasma TVs. Oh, my. Next door is the Oxford Spa
and Salon (for first class pampering) and the ground floor is home to the
Cruise Room, still the coolest bar in LoDo.

Where to Dine
Dining in Denver is a richly textured experience: You can eat as down-
home, way-out-west, or cosmopolitan as you want (sometimes even
within a single meal!). Finer restaurants across Colorado have worked
hard over the last few years at developing a true regional cuisine — they
no longer look to the coasts for guidance — and Denver’s eateries have
led the way. This movement has focused on western game, and the prox-
imity of Mexican and Southwestern food cultures has had an impact as
well. The diners and burger joints lean heavily on the Southwestern
style; if you’ve never had a breakfast burrito, here’s your wake-up call! Of
course, all the top-flight European and Asian styles are well represented;
fresh seafood is flown in daily, so there’s plenty of good sushi if you’re
jonesing for it. Latin American cuisines (besides just Mexican) are also
well represented, and a sizeable Vietnamese population has contributed
a number of restaurants over the years that are now Denver traditions.
If meat-and-potatoes is your thing, I can’t emphasize enough the incredi-
ble experience of local game, especially buffalo and elk. If you want a
steak, Denver has the usual chains — Ruth’s Chris, Gallagher’s, 
Morton’s — but you’re selling yourself short if you don’t try the buffalo.
Compared with beef, it’s more tender, much leaner, and more flavorful
by a mile. You find it here in the form of burgers and even meatloaf, but
you owe it to yourself to head over to the Buckhorn or the Fort and try a
tenderloin or porterhouse. Trust me on this one.
Check out the “Denver Accommodations & Dining” map, earlier in this
chapter, to locate the restaurants listed here.
Breckenridge Brewery & Pub
$–$$
LoDo 
PUB FARE
One of Denver’s best breweries, its location across from Coors Field makes
it very popular before and after baseball games. It’s casual and sports-
oriented without being a grungy, sweaty sports bar. Menu offerings include
fajitas, sandwiches, salads, pub fare, and entrees such as grilled salmon
and homemade pork tamales.

Buckhorn Exchange Restaurant
$$–$$$$
Near Downtown
STEAKS/GAME
For an unforgettable experience, hop on the RTD light-rail and ride to the
Buckhorn (it’s at the 10th Avenue/Osage station), which stands — barely,
it seems — right next to the train tracks in a forgotten area near Denver’s
downtown. The oldest restaurant in Colorado, the Buckhorn was founded
by one Henry H. Zietz, who befriended Chief Sitting Bull, hunted with
Chapter 11: Denver 107

Teddy Roosevelt, and accepted the sword of the vanquished General
George Custer from the Blackfeet Sioux. You’ll believe these seemingly far-
fetched tales when you peek inside the restaurant at the 500-odd pieces
of taxidermy on the walls and — in the spaces where nothing stares back
at you — at the historic photos and antique guns. The restaurant serves
items that would have been available in Colorado when it opened in 1883,
such as elk, steaks, pheasant, grouse, and buffalo. Don’t forget to ask about
the Rocky Mountain oysters. Vegetarians should definitely head elsewhere.
See map p. 104. 1000 Osage St., at 10th. % 303-534-9505. www.buckhorn.com.

Cuba Cuba

Golden Triangle
CUBAN
This new restaurant brightens up the Golden Triangle neighborhood with
its light, tropical atmosphere, breezy mojitos, and some truly heavenly
food. The adventurous wine list focuses on Latin America, Spain, and
Portugal; your server can help you match your food and wine orders. The
ceviche de tuna is a perfect warm-up for the savory entrees, many of which
feature the signature of Cuban cuisine, the mojo — a blend of various
spices and vegetables, ground into a sort of paste and featured like a
sauce. I recommend the puerco con yuca with black bean mojo or the
camarones habanero — shrimp in a fiery sauce. Among several options
for dessert, try the traditional tres leches (three-milk cake) — don’t argue,
just order it; resistance is futile.

Denver Chophouse and Brewery
$$–$$$
LoDo
RED MEAT
This dark, old-fashioned joint is part of the same company as the Walnut
Brewery in Boulder; the brewmasters are different, though, so the beer is
a slightly different experience, and the food is on another level entirely.
No pub fare here, this is the place for steaks, chops, and surf-and-turf.
Vegetarians, I apologize. Reputedly, it’s a popular hangout for victorious
Broncos and Avalanche players after home games, so if you want to rub
shoulders with large, sweaty millionaires, this is the place to go. Make
reservations, especially on game days.

BREAKFAST
You can only get breakfast at this Denver institution. Tucked behind the
Denver Art Museum, this place has been packing them in for decades with
outstanding and original omelets, French toast, and pancakes. You may
not get the humor of the ’80s-era cultural references on the menu, but
don’t let that stop you from ordering.

Morrison
COLORADO GAME
Don’t come to The Fort to eat the usual steak and potatoes while sitting in
a 1962 adobe reproduction of Historic Bent’s Fort (a trading post in south-
eastern Colorado), even though you can. And don’t come here for the
panoramic views of southeastern Denver, even though the place does have
them. Come here for the restaurant’s native game dishes such as braised
buffalo leg in oatmeal stout gravy, elk tenderloin with huckleberry sauce,
and farm-raised rattlesnake. There is a filet mignon on the menu, but beef
really isn’t the point here. Buffalo steaks are always on the menu, and once
you’ve tried it, you’ll never look at a cow the same way again.

Las Delicias
$–$$
Downtown
MEXICAN
If you want traditional Mexican food without a lot of frou-frou, postmodern,
Fusion nonsense, this should be your fist stop. Las Delicias is a very
casual, family-run restaurant where the ambience is relaxed, the service
prompt and friendly, and the food is spectacular. You find the usual array
of burritos, enchiladas, and fajitas, but let me point you toward the carne
adobada, steak ranchero, or carnitas estilo michoacan for other delicious
options.

Cherry Creek
FRENCH/ASIAN FUSION
If you’re browsing the chic stores in Denver’s Cherry Creek North, plan on
coming to this upscale restaurant to experience the colorful creations of
chef Radek R. Cerny, who likes adding Asian oils, curries, and spices to
what might otherwise be French food. Cerny’s lobster ravioli has been
earning raves for years, but the best items are sometimes the daily spe-
cials, which may include tuna with sesame, wasabi, and soy. You eat in a
stylish dining room graced with a long bank of windows and huge planters
of fresh-cut flowers. Make sure to reserve your spot in advance. After
seven years here, Cerny is still packing in the well-to-do of Denver.

Capitol Hill/Uptown
DINER FARE
This old Colfax Avenue landmark still packs them in, especially for late-
night snacking after a night on the town. If you head here during the 
bar rush, be ready to wait, and to wait outside (even in winter!). Waits 
are usually nonexistent for breakfast and lunch, though. Once you get
inside, you’re in for a treat: classic American diner food with Greek and
Southwestern twists. The burgers are great, but go for the souvlaki and
eggs or one of the enormous breakfast burritos smothered in green chili.
And if you’re here after the bars have closed, remember to drink lots of
water.

FUSION
This elegant, urban bistro serves up European Fusion cuisine with a decid-
edly Russian cast. Start with a bowl of borsht and the yazyk (veal tongue);
or go less traditional with the Dungeness crab strudel served on a bed of
aromatic greens with an orange vinaigrette. The entree menu features lots
of fish. I had a perfectly grilled walnut-crusted rack of lamb with baby bok
choi in a grape reduction. The beef stroganoff is a contemporary spin on

a classic: It’s a New York strip steak with mashed potatoes and a house
variation on the traditional mushroom sauce. The wine list is varied and
inventive, balances beautifully with the menu, and contains some excep-
tional values; the vodka list (with many house-flavored varieties) is
exhaustive. The kitchen closes at 9 p.m., but then the bar takes on a life of
its own.

Rocky Mountain Diner

Downtown
AMERICAN
Take your basic American diner, elevate it to casual dining status, add a
western flavor with a healthy dose of cowboy kitsch, and you have the
Rocky Mountain Diner. It’s all in good fun, but the food is serious stuff.
Starters include venison chili and Yuppie-I-O dip (warm and rich, with
cream cheese, artichoke hearts, and spinach). The house specialty is a
huge portion of pan-fried chicken and mashed potatoes, but the real
attractions are the buffalo meatloaf and the duck-and-havarti enchiladas.
There’s a great selection of local microbrews on tap, and the service is
friendly and fast. If you have any room left, go for the white chocolate,
black-bottom, banana cream pie — and waddle home carefully.

Okay, vegetarians, I haven’t forgotten you completely. This place sets the
standard for vegetarian and vegan food in the area, so if tempeh scaloppini

Watercourse make their own granola, and the buckwheat pancakes are
awesome. Naturally, the restaurant also has an excellent selection of
salads — check out the fig salad with wilted spinach, feta, and balsamic

It was a dinner destination among the old warehouses before LoDo was a

Nuoc mam, anyone?
One of the coolest aspects of Denver’s ethnic mix is the large Vietnamese population,
which has firmly entrenched itself in the local cuisine. Start by heading over to Federal
Boulevard, and the strip south of the Far East Center to T-Wa Inn (555 S. Federal Blvd.;
% 303-922-2378; $–$$), the oldest of the great Vietnamese restaurants, for crispy
roasted duck and Tai Chanh, a cold salad of beef and vegetables in a spicy mint-lemon
marinade. You can also go across the street and a block down to New Saigon (630
South Federal Blvd.; % 303-936-4954; $–$$) for Pho Tai Nam (a variation on the tradi-
tional Vietnamese Pho, or soup) or Ca Tim Mu Hanh, fried eggplant in a home-recipe
sauce.
For my money, though, the best Vietnamese food in Colorado is at Kim Ba (2495 S.
Havana St., Unit F31, Aurora; % 303-745-1637; $–$$), way out in Aurora, but worth the
drive. Chef Ba Forde, a scion of the family that opened T-Wa Inn, has produced highly
original versions of traditional dishes, and the results are stupendous. Start with
Dungeness crab in a rich buttery sauce, or Goi Cuon, shrimp spring rolls with a spicy
peanut sauce. For dinner, go for the sea scallops in a sweet red pepper sauce, or the
marinated pork that comes served over noodles or in a roll-it-yourself preparation with
cucumber, cilantro, and mint. Everything comes with nuoc mam, the fish sauce that’s
often called the “Vietnamese ketchup.” Finish with Ba’s unique take on flan, a sweet,
coconut-laced custard — and tell her Nick sent you.

Denver’s mayor. Seriously. His brainchild, this brewery and grill with full-
size billiards tables upstairs, is the epitome of modern Colorado nightlife.
Burritos and burgers are on the menu, but so are a buffalo rib-eye steak
and elk medallions (some enlightened vegetarian options are also avail-
able). The real stars, though, are the rotating selection of hand-crafted
beer, of which there are 15 or so on tap at any given time. RailYard Ale is
the flagship of the fleet, but the Sagebrush Stout makes great cold-weather
sipping, and try Patty’s Chile Beer — infused with Anaheim chiles — with
your Mexican food. The servers are casual but professional, knowledge-
able, and happy to educate you about the brewing process. Fine cigars are
sold and smoked upstairs in the pool hall, and the Impulse Theater takes
over the basement with outstanding improv entertainment.

days. This section tells you which ones are worth seeing.

Colorado History Museum
Civic Center Park
Even if the mere idea of a diorama makes you drowsy, you should check
out the meticulously detailed ones at this museum. Using paper, card-
board, matchsticks, and wood veneers, artists in a Depression-era work
relief program created tiny renderings of Colorado’s history, which are dis-
played today in this museum. You can also view exhibits on pioneers,
miners, ranchers, and Native Americans, and read a timeline tracing the
major events of the past 150 years in the state’s history. Memorabilia of a
more recent vintage is also on display, including a gondola car from
Steamboat Ski Area and a Denver Nuggets warm-up suit.

treasures. The museum houses an immense collection of Native American
art; a Western gallery that has Remingtons and Russells; and pre- and post-
Colombian works from Latin America. The Asian and African exhibits are
also excellent. Works by Degas, Matisse, Picasso, and others are on dis-
play, though European art is not this museum’s forte. The fall of 2006 will
see the opening of the Frederic C. Hamilton building, another shocking
piece of postmodern architecture designed by Daniel Libeskind that dra-
matically alters the skyline of the Golden Triangle, and doubles the size of
the museum itself. The museum has a kids’ corner where children can
make art, and it schedules special kids’ activities, too. Call % 720-913-
0049 to find out what will be on tap during your visit.
See map p. 114. 13th Street and Acoma. % 720-865-5000. www.denverart
museum.org. Open: Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Wed 10 a.m.–9 p.m., Sun noon to 
5 p.m. Admission to permanent collection: $8 adults, $6 seniors over 65 and youths
13–18, 12 and under free. Free admission for Colorado residents on Saturdays.
Denver Botanic Gardens
Cherry Creek
On the 23 acres of the Denver Botanic Gardens, scientists nourish, breed,
and study 15,000 plant species from around the world, including many
threatened varieties. The individual plants are like brush strokes on a
living canvas; each of the 30 or so gardens qualifies as a work of art.
Highlights include a Japanese garden replete with pools, carefully placed
granite, and aggressively pruned trees; an alpine garden that features high-
alpine species from around the world; and a water garden with more than
400 types of aquatic plants. There’s also a warm, misty, tropical conser-
vatory, where you can forge through the fronds of jungle plants. Each year,
the Summer Concert Series brings several world-renowned classical, folk,
and pop music acts to the open-air stage at the center of the gardens; bring
a picnic dinner or order one from the on-site caterer (many people bring
wine and pâté, and generally show off). You sit on the grass, though, so
bring a blanket.
See map p. 114. 1005 York St. % 720-865-3500. www.botanicgardens.org. Open:
May–Sept Wed–Fri 9 a.m.–5 p.m., Sat–Tues 9 a.m.–8 p.m.; Oct–Apr daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
Admission: $8.50 adults 16 and over, $5.50 seniors 65 and over; $5 students and youths
4–15.
Denver Museum of Nature and Science
City Park
Colorado’s geological history makes it one of the best places in the world
to find dinosaur fossils, and this museum takes full advantage of that sit-
uation. The fourth largest natural history museum in the United States,
this museum has dioramas of wildlife from around the globe; mounted but-
terflies and insects; mummies; gems and minerals; and plenty of dinosaur
skeletons. But the place is hardly musty. Almost everywhere you turn, you
can try an interactive activity, whether it’s prospecting for mineral pock-
ets inside a simulated mine, comparing the densities of rocks, or smelling
Part III: The Front Range

the odor that attracts a doe to a buck (not as bad as you’d expect). The
museum also has a large hall that houses popular touring exhibits, an
IMAX theatre, and the world-class Gates Planetarium. If you want to take
in a very large movie at the adjoining IMAX Theater, you can buy combi-
nation tickets for both the museum and the show at a considerable 
discount — only a few dollars more than the price of museum admission.
See map p. 114. 2001 Colorado Blvd. % 303-322-7009. www.dmnh.org. Open: Daily
9 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed December 25. Museum admission: $9 adults, $6 seniors 60 and
over and kids 3–18. Museum and IMAX or planetarium combination tickets: $13
adults, $9 seniors and kids 3–18. Museum, IMAX, and planetarium combination tick-
ets: $16 adults, $12 seniors and kids 3–18.
Denver Zoo
City Park
The nation’s fourth most popular zoo and Colorado’s number-one cultural
attraction, the zoo has a marvelous array of critters, including rhinos (one
of whom paints — I kid you not) and hippos; lions, tigers, and jaguars; a
large bird population that includes a rare Andean condor; a group of rare
Komodo dragons; and 29 species of primates, including Brazilian monkeys
that wander freely through the zoo (with zoo employees close behind).
Not only do the 3,500 animals appear healthy, the zoo also seems deter-
mined to teach visitors about the destruction of animal habitats around
the planet. Numerous information panels discuss threats to animals and
explain how zoos protect endangered species through conservation and
breeding programs. The zoo offers eight free admission days annually. The
dates change, so call before you go or visit their Web site to find out
whether a free day will occur during your visit. Keep in mind, though, that
the zoo tends to be very crowded on these days.
See map p. 114. 23rd Avenue between Colorado and York. % 303-376-4800.
www.denverzoo.org. Open: Apr–Sept daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m. (gates close at 5 p.m.);
Oct–March daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m. (gates close at 4 p.m.). Admission: $11 adults summer,
$9 adults winter; $9 seniors 62 and over summer, $7 seniors winter; $7 children 3–11
(accompanied by an adult) summer, $5 children winter; free for children under 3.
Ocean Journey
Platte River Valley
Two distinct journeys are offered at this $93-million aquarium. One traces
a river as it flows from an Indonesian rain forest to the Pacific Ocean; the
other follows the Colorado River from the Rockies to the Sea of Cortez.
Each journey features aquariums housing the plant and animal species
that the river would have at different points. For example, the first tanks
in the Colorado River journey show trout and other species that may
inhabit a mountain brook; the last tanks show seahorses, eels, and puffer
fish (among many other species) in the Sea of Cortez, below the river’s
delta. Watching the Pacific Ocean tanks, where sharks and colorful reef
fish swim all around you, even underfoot and overhead, is the most fun.
Chapter 11: Denver 117

The most breathtaking display, however, is a simulated flash flood in the
red rock desert of Utah. The price of admission is steep, but you’ll enjoy
what you get, even if it only lasts a few hours.
See map p. 114. 700 Water St. % 303-561-4450. www.oceanjourney.org. Daily
10 a.m.–6 p.m. Admission: $14.95 adults, $12.95 youths 13–17 and seniors 65 and up,
$6.95 children 4–12, free for children under 4.
Six Flags Elitch Gardens Amusement Park
Platte River Valley
This Six Flags–owned amusement park, which opened in the Platte Valley
in 1996, takes its name from an 1889 theme park in another, leafier part of
town. With 48 thrill rides on the premises, the newer incarnation is more
about defying gravity than gardening. Highlights include Boomerang,
which drops you 125 feet, throws you for a few twists and flips, and then
replays the whole ordeal in reverse; and Mind Eraser, a suspended roller
coaster that hits speeds over 60 mph. The park also has gentler rides for
kids too little and adults too big to enjoy nausea. Admission to Island
Kingdom Water Park, which has a wave pool and giant waterslides, is
included in the price.
See map p. 114. 2000 Elitch Circle. % 303-455-4771. www.sixflags.com. Open:
Daily 10 a.m.–10 p.m. during summer. Usually open 10 a.m.–8 p.m. on weekends
during May, Sept, and Oct. (call for low-season hours). Admission: $38 for people
over 48 inches tall; $22 for people under 48 inches tall, seniors 55–69, and the dis-
abled; free for children under 4 and seniors over 69.

Where the Old West meets the new: 
The National Western Stock Show, 
Rodeo & Horse Show
If you’re in Denver in mid-January, this can’t-miss event offers a bunch of different
family-pleasing options, from first-class professional rodeo to an exhibition and sale
of ranching and farming equipment. The rodeo is what most people come out for; with
competitions throughout the two weeks of Stock Show events featuring barrel races,
saddle bronc riding, and, of course, bull riding. A special treat is the Mexican
Extravaganza, two shows usually near the beginning of the two-week event that show-
cases the Mexican roots of both rodeo and, actually, all of North American western
culture. These shows are more about showmanship than the subjugation of farm ani-
mals, and they’re quite a spectacle. There’s also a world-class horse show, exhibits
of exotic livestock, a petting zoo, and an exposition of farming and ranching equip-
ment, which is well worth the trip for home gardeners. The whole shebang happens
in a complex north of Downtown, just off I-70 and east of I-25. Call % 303-297-1166 or
visit www.nationalwestern.com for schedules, tickets, and information.

Touring historical sites
Built over the course of 30 years beginning in 1886, the Colorado State
Capitol Building can’t help but command attention. It has 4-foot-thick
granite walls, immense pillars, and a 272-foot-high, gold-coated dome 
visible from miles away. Inside, the capitol has wainscoting of rare
Colorado onyx, stained-glass windows, murals, paintings, chandeliers,
and an 80-foot rotunda. Free 40-minute tours depart every half hour from
9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. during summer and every 45 minutes from 9:00
a.m. to 2:30 p.m. the rest of the year. The tour guides are thorough —
and then some. If you’re short on time, pick up a free guide to the capi-
tol at the tour desk and walk around on your own. And don’t worry
about doing something wrong — if you’re about to violate protocol, a
very large guard will let you know. For more information on tours, call
% 303-866-2604. The capitol is at the corner of Broadway and Colfax
Avenue. The public entrance is at street level on the building’s south
(14th Street) side.
Molly Brown not only survived the Titanic disaster, she was also a phi-
lanthropist, suffragist, fashion plate, activist, mother, social matron, and
sometime yodeler who lived in Denver’s Capitol Hill neighborhood. You
can almost sense Brown’s unsinkable presence at the Molly Brown
House Museum, 1340 Pennsylvania St. (% 303-832-4092; http://molly
brown.org), an 1888 Victorian mansion where Brown lived in the early
1900s. Some of Brown’s personal effects are here, including alabaster
sculptures, a Tiffany lamp, and a Mother of Pearl tray from Japan. And
the house itself has been lovingly restored. The only way you can go
inside is on a 45-minute tour, offered from 10:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.
Tuesday through Saturday, noon to 4:30 p.m. on Sunday. (During
summer, tours are also offered from 10:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on Monday.)
Cost is $6.50 for adults, $3 for children ages 6 to 12, and $5 for ages 65
and up.
The free walk-in tours of the U. S. Mint, located at West Colfax Avenue
and Cherokee Street, were suspended after the terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2001. At press time, visitors couldn’t enter the mint
unless they prearranged a visit through a member of Congress. To check
on the status of the tours, call % 303-405-4761.
Other things to see and do
Like a lot of cities, Denver brims with small, diverse attractions that can
momentarily (and sometimes permanently) change your perspective.
Around Denver, you can
 Recognize long-overlooked cowboys. As many as a third of the
cowboys on the great cattle drives of the 19th century were African
American. The Black American West Museum and Heritage
Center, 3091 California St., at 31st Street (% 303-292-2566; www.
blackamericanwest.org), celebrates the often-overlooked role of
African-Americans in pioneering and settling the American West. It
Chapter 11: Denver 119

also tells the stories of other early black settlers, including physi-
cians, legislators, miners, and teachers. Open since 1971, the
museum is in the three-story, 1,800-square-foot home of Justina
Ford, the first African-American female doctor in Denver. It’s right
across from the Downing Street light-rail stop. Hours: May through
September daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; October through April Wednesday
through Friday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m. Admission: $6 adults, $5 seniors 65 and over, $4 children 
5 to 12.
 Look closely at small things. The Denver Museum of Miniatures,
Dolls, and Toys, 1880 Gaylord St. (% 303-322-1053; www.dmmdt.
com), exhibits miniatures, including some tiny, highly detailed doll-
houses; dolls from around the globe; and toys ranging from 17th-
century antiques to modern action figures. It’s in the 1899 Pearce-
McAllister Cottage. Hours: Tuesday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 
4 p.m., Sunday 1 to 4 p.m. Admission: $5 adults, $4 seniors and 
children 2 to 16.
 Shrink your art world. There’s no reason to run through the 3,500-
square-foot Museum of Contemporary Art, 1275 19th Street, in
Sakura Square (% 303-298-7554; www.mcartdenver.org). Go
slowly and absorb the full impact of the paintings, sculptures, and
installations, because the space is small, the concepts are thought-
provoking, and the art will never be here again. (There is no perma-
nent collection; the exhibitions change every few months.) If you’re
a film buff, call and inquire about experimental film nights, which
showcase works from the Modern Art Library in New York. In 2006,
the museum expects to open in a brand-new building in LoDo.
Open: Tuesday through Saturday 11:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Admission:
$5 adults, $3 students and seniors, free for children 12 and under.
 Chase butterflies. The main attraction at the Butterfly Pavilion
and Insect Center, 6252 W. 104th Ave., at U.S. 36 in Westminster 
(% 303-469-5441; www.butterflies.org), is a conservatory
housing 1,200 butterflies from around the world. If you’re used to
visiting museums where displays are fixed in place, you’ll need to
get used to this place, where butterflies flutter all around you and
sometimes disappear altogether. When you get in the habit of scan-
ning the tropical vegetation for resting butterflies, however, you’ll
be able to admire more of them up close, and you may even come
to enjoy the search. In the museum’s Crawl-A-See-’Em, kids can pet
a tarantula and examine other creepy-crawlers such as giant cen-
tipedes, black widow spiders, and cockroaches. If they still feel like
eating afterward, there’s a snack shop, too. Open: Daily 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m. (until 6 p.m. in summer). Admission: $7.95 ages 13 to 61,
$5.95 seniors 62 and up, $4.95 children 4 to 12.
 Get small. About 30 miles west of Denver, brake fast and you’ll find
yourself at Tiny Town, 6429 S. Turkey Creek Rd., off U.S. 285 5 miles
west of Colorado 470 (% 303-697-6829; www.tinytownrailroad.
com). All 100 buildings in this historic Wild West town are to 1⁄6
Part III: The Front Range 
120

scale — even the windows, doorknobs, and doorways. The build-
ings are too small for adults or anyone else who is not to 1⁄6 scale,
but small kids fit inside and adults will appreciate the detail work. 
A miniature steam locomotive circles a 5⁄8-mile track through the
grounds (cost: $1). Built by a father for his daughter in the early
1920s, Tiny Town became a popular tourist attraction in the late
’20s, but after a flood made it a tiny disaster area, it became a tiny
ghost town in the early 1970s. In the late 1980s, the owners
restored the site and it’s now a great place for kids. There’s also an
open-air playground, snack bar, picnic area, and gift shop. Open: 
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends in May, September, and October;
daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Memorial Day through Labor Day.
Admission: $3 ages 12 and up, $2 children 2 to 12.
Staying Active
Denver residents are an active bunch — statistically the thinnest city
dwellers in the United States. When they get serious about exercising,
they often make a beeline for the mountains surrounding the city. But
there’s plenty to do around town as well. While you’re in Denver, you
can take a break from sightseeing for any of the following:
 Biking: Denver’s extensive trail system makes this a fun place to
ride a bike. You can’t go everywhere on a bike (safely), but you can
pedal and run on over 400 miles of paved designated trails. My
favorite places for biking are the trails alongside Cherry Creek and
the South Platte River. You can access these trails at many down-
town locations. For more information, contact Bicycle Colorado
(% 303-417-1544; www.bicyclecolo.org).
 Boating/rafting: At the confluence of Cherry Creek and the South
Platte River is a short stretch of whitewater in a man-made park
where you can practice your kayaking during peak flows. The park
is near REI, 1416 Platte St. (% 303-756-3100). Use the designated
parking area near the park or else feed one of the meters on the
street.
 Golfing: The City of Denver operates seven public golf courses, 
and there are many more in the suburbs. The one most convenient
to the downtown core is at City Park, E. 25th Ave. at York Street
(% 303-295-4420). Greens fees are $20 for 18 holes, $12 for 9 holes
($24 and $14, respectively, on weekends). Reservations are avail-
able for residents seven days in advance; for nonresidents, five
days in advance.
 Hiking: If you’re interested in hiking (as opposed to walking), head
for Denver’s Mountain Parks, a system of 31 parks totaling 14,000
acres in the foothills and mountains west of town. Far and away the
best for short hikes is Red Rocks Park, on Colorado 74 between
Evergreen and Morrison. For more on the mountain parks, surf the
Internet to www.denver.org or call % 303-697-4545.
Chapter 11: Denver 121

 Running: You can run in any number of Denver City parks.
Washington Park, at Downing Street and Virginia Avenue, has long
been the outdoor workout ground of choice. There’s a crushed-
granite jogging path around the mile-plus perimeter, and a paved
ring road for bikes and rollerblades.
 Playing tennis: The Denver Department of Parks and Recreation
(% 303-964-2500) manages or owns close to 150 tennis courts,
more than a third of them lit for night play. For $3 an hour, you can
rent one of the 12 courts at City Park, E. 25th Avenue at York
Street. Go to the Denver Parks and Recreation Permitting Office,
2300 15th St. (% 303-964-2522), to purchase some court time.

Taking in a pro sports event
Anyone who has seen Denver Broncos fans smeared with orange and blue body paint
knows that the town takes its sports very seriously. It’s a big-league city, with 
pro teams in all the major sports. All these teams sell tickets through Ticketmaster
(% 303-830-TIXS; www.ticketmaster.com). Here’s the roster that spurs the city’s
sport-minded faithful:
 The Colorado Avalanche (% 303-893-6700; www.coloradoavalanche.com)
captured the National Hockey League’s Stanley Cup in 1996, the first season after
the franchise moved to Denver from Quebec City. The team won the championship
again in 2001 and has challenged for the Cup most years since then. Tickets to
Avalanche games at the Pepsi Center (corner of Speer Boulevard and Auraria
Parkway) are the second most difficult to obtain in Denver (behind Broncos tick-
ets). Even if you can find a seat at face value, it won’t come cheap. Prices range
from $25 for the upper-end balconies to $224 for the front row behind the glass.
 Because of Denver’s thin air, baseballs that are walloped at Coors Field (in LoDo)
tend to carry out of the park easily. All this adds up to runs and action galore,
which may be one reason that the Colorado Rockies (% 800-388-7625 or
303-762-5347; www.coloradorockies.com) regularly sell most of their 50,000
seats. Prices for Rockies games range from $5 to $45, with the leftover cheap
seats, in an area known as the Rockpile, going for $2 and $5 on game day — one
of the best deals in baseball.
 The Denver Broncos (% 720-258-3333; www.denverbroncos.com) play their
home National Football League games at Invesco Field at Mile High, a $360 
million, 76,000-seat stadium that was completed in 2001. Played from September
through December, the eight regular-season home games always sell out, but if
you order your tickets right after they go on sale in early summer, you should be
able to obtain seats. Prices range from $30 to $311.
 The other pro football name in town belongs to the Colorado Crush (% 720-
258-3400; www.coloradocrush.com) of the indoor Arena Football League. 
Co-owned by Denver Bronco–legend John Elway, the squad’s home games take
place at the Pepsi Center, and ticket prices range from $7 to $46.

Seeing Denver by Guided Tour
If Denver seems like too much of a load for you to tackle alone, you can
choose from a number of guided walking, bus, and trolley tours. I offer a
few good options here.
Faux trolley tours
During summer, the Cultural Connection Trolley (% 303-289-2841),
which strongly resembles a bus, makes hourly stops at each of Denver’s
prime tourist attractions, including Cherry Creek Shopping Center,
Ocean Journey, Union Station, Larimer Square, and Coors Field. Most
major hotels have brochures with the trolley’s schedule. Just pay the
driver $16 per adult, $8 per child under 12 (MasterCard and Visa are
accepted), upon boarding, and you can ride all day between 8:00 a.m.
and 5:30 p.m. A recording triggered by a global positioning system high-
lights the major sights you pass, and you can get on and off at any of the
stops and catch the next bus, er, trolley.
Real trolley tours
The Platte Valley Trolley (% 303-458-6255; www.denvertrolley.org)
parallels a scenic stretch of the Platte River while passing Invesco Field
at Mile High, Six Flags Elitch Gardens, and Ocean Journey Aquarium.
Unlike the Cultural Connection Trolley, this trolley actually travels on
tracks. It operates from May 25 through September 8 from 11 a.m. to 
4 p.m. daily. Cost for the half-hour ride is $3 for adults, $1 for seniors and
children. To get there, take I-25 to 23rd Avenue (Exit 211). Turn east onto
Water Street and follow the signs.
Chapter 11: Denver 123
 The Denver Nuggets have been popular whipping boys during most of their time
in the NBA, but recent management changes and the addition of Carmelo Anthony
have made the team competitive in the tough Western Conference. They play at
the striking new Pepsi Center (% 303-405-1100; www.nuggets.com), at the
corner of Speer Boulevard and Auraria Parkway. The place seats up to 19,309,
and the season runs from late October through mid-April. Tickets range in price
from $10 to $325.
 The Colorado Rapids (% 800-844-7777 or 303-299-1599; www.colorado
rapids.com) compete in Major League Soccer from late March through early
September at Invesco Field at Mile High. Tickets cost $14 to $40.
 If lacrosse is more your speed, check out the Colorado Mammoth (% 303-
405-1101; www.coloradomammoth.com). This National Lacrosse League fran-
chise plays at the Pepsi Center from January through April. Tickets run from 
$5 to $38.

Guided tours
Half- and full-day bus tours of Denver and the nearby Rockies are offered
by the ubiquitous Gray Line (% 800-348-6877 for information only,
303-289-2841 for reservations and information; www.coloradogray
line.com). Prices range from $25 to $75 depending on the tour and
include entry fees but usually no food; children 12 and under pay half
the adult price. Tours depart the Cherry Creek Shopping Center at First
Avenue and Milwaukee Street, as well as local hotels and hostels on a
reservation basis.
Another company offering guided tours in and around Denver is The
Colorado Sightseer, 6780 W. 84th Circle, Suite 60 (% 303-423-8200;
www.coloradosightseer.com). Prices range from $35 to $75 and
include entrance fees to some of the destinations, which include loca-
tions outside Denver such as Rocky Mountain National Park and
Boulder.
The LoDo District (% 303-628-5484; www.lodo.org) offers guided walk-
ing tours of the historic area. Tours depart from Union Station (17th and
Wynkoop streets) on Saturday at 10 a.m.; the cost is $5 per person. Two
certified paranormal investigators conduct a variety of tours given by
Gunslingers, Ghosts & Gold (% 303-860-8687). As the name implies,
the emphasis is on haunted houses and history, with some humor
thrown in. Tours cost around $10 to $15 per person.
Considering One-, Two-, and Three-Day
Itineraries
If you don’t add a trip to a remote destination, the sightseeing in Denver
breaks down neatly into a three-day itinerary. None of the daylong itiner-
aries is clearly superior to the others. If you’re only in town for a day or
so, you’ll just have to choose which itinerary you (or your kids) like
best. If you have a few extra hours in the evening, LoDo and the 16th
Street Mall are always fun options.
On Day 1, concentrate on the Capitol Hill area. Take in some of the
works at the Denver Art Museum. From there, look at the tiny dioramas
at the Colorado History Museum. If you’re hungry for lunch, stop at one
of the cafes near 13th Avenue and Pearl Street. In the afternoon, tour the
Molly Brown House. Allow a little extra time to stroll past the historic
homes near the Molly Brown House, and then accompany a group
through the State Capitol Building. Finish by cruising three blocks north
on Broadway to the ornate Brown Palace Hotel for a cold beverage.
The Denver Art Museum has taken pains to make itself kid-friendly, but
children still may not enjoy this day as much as Days 2 and 3, so if you
have young children, you may want to skip this plan and go straight to
Day 2.
Part III: The Front Range 
124

Start Day 2 by venturing a few miles west of the downtown area to City
Park. Visit the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, then walk across
the park to the Denver Zoo. After observing the animals, make the short
drive to the Cherry Creek North area. Have a late lunch, and then
browse the shops and galleries there. In the soft light of late afternoon,
wind down with a stroll in the Denver Botanic Gardens. If you’re head-
ing back into the downtown area from here, detour past some of the his-
toric homes in the Uptown neighborhood. Consider dining at one of the
fine restaurants on 17th Avenue.
On Day 3, drive or take a light-rail train into the Platte River Valley
and visit Ocean’s Journey. Lunch at Zang Brewing Co., 2301 Seventh St.
(% 303-455-2500), a historic brewery that now houses a popular sports
bar and restaurant. Then head for Six Flags Elitch Gardens. You can kill
the better part of a day at the park, but you may want to save some time
and energy to really visit LoDo on your way back Downtown. If you’re
taking the light-rail into town, stop at or near Union Station and stroll
the galleries in LoDo. Use the free buses on 16th Street to take in other
parts of the 16th Street Mall. Enjoy dinner at one of the dozens of restau-
rants in this area.
Shopping in Denver
Store hours in Denver tend to vary from place to place. Generally, stores
are open Monday through Saturday, with many open on Sunday, too;
department stores usually stay open until 9 p.m. at least one evening a
week. Discount stores and supermarkets are often open later than other
stores, and some supermarkets are open 24 hours a day.
The best shopping areas
Denver’s most lively shopping district is the 16th Street Mall, a down-
town street that’s been converted into a pedestrian-only walkway and
has free bus service running its entire mile-long length. The mall’s clien-
tele includes everyone from office workers to tourists, and the busi-
nesses are as diverse as the shoppers. Nestled into the mall between
Welton and Tremont streets is the glittery new, $100 million Denver
Pavilions, home to trendy chains such as Niketown, Wolfgang Puck’s
Café, and Virgin Megastore. Besides the big stores, the 16th Street Mall
features discount outlets such as T.J. Maxx and Ross Dress For Less as
well as dozens of locally owned shops, T-shirt stores, brewpubs, and
cafes. During warm weather, you can sit at one of many sidewalk cafes,
people-watch, and soak in the colors from some of the 25,000 flowers
planted annually. Also located on the mall is the Tabor Center, home to
ESPN Zone and other restaurants.
When you’re walking the 16th Street Mall, make sure to detour south two
blocks on Larimer Avenue. Follow the street as it takes you past Writer
Square, 1512 Larimer (% 303-628-9056), a block of jewelry stores, gift
Chapter 11: Denver 125

shops, galleries, and restaurants, and on to Larimer Square (% 303-534-
2367), where quirky businesses are tucked into nooks and crannies of
historic Victorian buildings. If you tire of shopping, walk over to the
Larimer Square information booth and get a free brochure describing a
walking tour of the area. And if you feel like wandering the galleries of
LoDo, venture in either direction off of 16th Street onto Wynkoop,
Wazee, or Blake streets.
Don’t come to Cherry Creek Mall, 3000 E. First Ave. (% 303-388-3900),
for bargain hunting. Located 3 miles southeast of Downtown, this thriv-
ing, upscale mall is one of the largest and most popular attractions in
Denver, and the prices reflect the high demand. Premium retailers such
as Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Lord & Taylor, and Foley’s anchor
the 160 shops and restaurants. Parking is free and usually easy. If it isn’t,
you can valet park for $7 for the first three hours, $1 for each additional
hour. The mall is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.,
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Across the street from Cherry Creek Mall, along First, Second, and Third
avenues between University Boulevard and Steele Street, the leafy sub-
urban shopping district of Cherry Creek North (% 303-394-2903), is
home to 330 shops, 50 spas and salons, and 25 high-end art galleries.
Around here, it’s easier to find a large gem than a polished rock and
much easier to find a priceless antique than cool junk. Even if you’re not
buying, come here to admire the galleries, many of which feature
museum-quality work. Plan on staying for a meal — some of the city’s
finest restaurants are in this area. Most stores are open Monday through
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Sunday from noon to 5 p.m.
What to look for and where to find it
You can find everything from A to Z in Denver, provided you have
enough time for all the letters. The following sections offer information
on some places with character where you can start your Denver-area
shopping.
Art
Earthzone Mineral and Fossil Gallery, 1411 Larimer St. (% 303-572-
8198), offers art, jewelry, home decorations, and gifts made partly or
entirely of fossils and minerals. The stones aren’t as precious as gems or
diamonds, but they’re nearly as pretty after the gallery’s featured artists
finish with them.
If you want to find that perfect oil painting of a cowboy at sunset, start
your search at Mudhead Gallery at the Hyatt Regency, 555 17th St. 
(% 303-293-0007). As one of Denver’s main trading posts for South-
western and Western art, Mudhead offers paintings and bronze sculp-
tures by Western artists, as well as Native American pottery, baskets,
fetishes, and rugs.
Part III: The Front Range 
126

The Camera Obscura Gallery, 13th Avenue and Bannock Street (% 303-
623-4059), is the place to go for great photography, past and present.
David Cook/Fine American Art, 1637 Wazee St. (% 303-623-4817), 
specializes in Native American art and trades for premium items.
Books
If it starts raining during your visit, head for either of two Tattered
Cover Bookstores. The employees at these stores actually want you to
sit around and read. You can settle into an overstuffed chair near a read-
ing lamp, then leaf through a magazine or book without worrying about
whether the pages become dog-eared. Eventually, as payment, you
should consider purchasing one of the more than 150,000 available titles
or at least get some coffee to stay alert. The older and larger store is 
in Cherry Creek, at the corner of First Avenue and Milwaukee Street 
(% 303-322-7727; www.tatteredcover.com); the other occupies a 
historic mercantile building at the corner of 16th and Wynkoop streets
(% 303-436-1070) at the LoDo end of the 16th Street Mall.
Imports
For clothes by the hottest designers from New York, Rome, and Paris,
shop the big stores and boutiques at Cherry Creek Mall, 3000 E. First
Ave. (% 303-388-3900). For clothes by the hottest designers in Nepal,
Tibet, and India, go to Mount Everest Import, 707 16th St. (% 303-573-
8451), in the 16th Street Mall. The shop also carries fabrics, weavings,
and musical instruments.
Maps
The Tattered Cover Bookstores (see the previous “Books” section) have
great map departments, and even better departments with books detail-
ing the sights, history, geology, and any other aspect of the Colorado
region you can imagine. If you’re heading to the high country, REI, 1416
Platte St., next to Confluence Park in the Central Platte Valley (% 303-
756-3100), will have most of what you’re looking for; better, though, is to
get United States Geological Survey (USGS) maps directly from the
source at the Earth Science Information Center (ESIC) on the grounds
of the Denver Federal Center. Take 6th Avenue west to Kipling Street,
head south to Gate #1 and tell the guards at the gate you want the map
store. They’ll point you in the right direction, and you won’t find better
prices (or better maps) anywhere else.
Music
Seasoned record collectors recognize Jerry’s Records, 312 E. Colfax
Ave. (% 303-830-2336), as a world-class phenomenon: It has thousands
of LPs in stock, along with plenty of CDs and alternative music publica-
tions, and the prices here are legendarily low. If digging through stacks
of vinyl or finding that cool CD is your bag, Jerry’s is a must.
Chapter 11: Denver 127

If you don’t find what you’re after there, head around the corner to 
Wax Trax, 638 E. 13th Ave. (% 303-831-7246), Denver’s established
alternative-culture headquarters. They have a great poster and novelty
shop next door, and awesome blues and jazz collections on both CD and
vinyl.
Sports equipment/gear
Denver’s REI Flagship, 1416 Platte St. (% 303-756-3100; www.rei.com),
occupies a parklike setting near the confluence of Cherry Creek and the
South Platte River. The gargantuan store features a climbing wall, an out-
door bike-testing area, and a “cold room” to try out outerwear and sleep-
ing bags. You can load up on the gear of your dreams, then go running or
bicycling on paved paths alongside the river or, better still, kayak in a
nearby whitewater park on the South Platte River.
The Gart Sports store at Tenth and Broadway (% 303-861-1122; www.
gartsports.com) was the outdoor retailer’s first huge Sportscastle and
is the largest sporting goods store in the country. Since then, Gart has
opened another 17 Denver-area stores. Unlike REI, which concentrates
more intensely on backcountry endeavors, Gart covers a wider variety
of sports, including old standbys such as basketball, baseball, and foot-
ball. The store’s five stories feature a range of fun activities for the
sports-minded, including a driving cage for golfers and ball courts on the
roof.
Gart Sports’s annual Sniagrab (that’s bargains spelled backwards), offers
rock-bottom prices on ski equipment every Labor Day weekend.
Nightlife
Denver has some 30 theaters, more than 100 cinemas, and dozens of
concert halls, nightclubs, discos, and bars. Clubs offer country-and-
western music, jazz, rock, and comedy. A good online resource for local
music is www.coloradomusic.org.
Current entertainment listings appear in special Friday-morning sections
of the two daily newspapers, the Denver Post and Rocky Mountain News.
Westword, a weekly newspaper distributed free throughout the city
every Wednesday, has perhaps the best listings: It focuses on the arts,
entertainment, and local politics. The Denver Post (% 303-777-FILM;
www.777film.com) provides information on movie showtimes and 
theaters.
The “Denver Attractions & Nightlife” map earlier in this chapter includes
locations for many of the hot spots mentioned here.
Hitting the local clubs
It may not be renowned for its underground, but Denver has an active
club scene and you usually won’t have to go far to find a place that suits
Part III: The Front Range 
128

your taste. There are lounges, dance halls, music clubs, and even a few
genuine dives. Following is a sampling of the best clubs around town.
Country
Touring country acts sometimes park their buses at the Grizzly Rose
Saloon and Dance Emporium, 5450 N. Valley Hwy. (% 303-295-2353).
Near Downtown most nights, the place to be is Skylark Lounge, 140
Broadway (% 303-722-7844), which hosts the best alternative-country
bands in the area.
Dance
The most popular dance club in town, as of this minute, is The Alley Cat
(% 303-571-4545), located at 1222 Glenarm Place behind the Diamond
Cabaret strip club. On weekends it has a $15 cover charge, gets thronged
with young people who are half-dressed to the nines, and features cage
dancers who look as if they just got off work next door. DJs spin music in
the main chamber; a smaller lounge has trance music.
If salsa is more to your liking, head for La Rumba, 99 W. Ninth St.
(% 303-572-8006).
Jazz
Jazz enthusiasts should not miss the legendary El Chapultepec, 1962
Market St. (% 303-295-9126). This small club has offered free nightly
jazz since the 1950s. One long wall is covered with photos of jazz leg-
ends who have played this tiny room, including Tony Bennett, Ella
Fitzgerald, and Frank Sinatra. Despite having such an illustrious past, the
bar still charges no cover and has just a one-drink minimum per set. Just
make sure you get there early.
Sambuca, 1320 15th St. (% 303-629-5299), is an ultraswank new club
that revives the supper-club scene of the Swing era. You’ll definitely
want reservations here, and whatever you do, don’t dress down. There’s
live music most nights of the week — swing, jazz, and blues — and an
excellent kitchen.
Rock, funk, and R&B
For the past 20 years, Herman’s Hideaway, 1578 S. Broadway (% 303-
777-5840), has helped launch the careers of Colorado’s up-and-coming
bands. Herman’s keeps its prices reasonable even when the most popu-
lar acts are playing: $4 on most weekend nights, and $7 on most Fridays
and Saturdays.
The most rockin’ local and regional bands can be heard at the Ogden
Theatre, 935 E. Colfax Ave. (% 303-830-2525). If you want to catch a
national touring act, check the listings at two theatres on Colfax Avenue:
the Bluebird Theater, 3317 E. Colfax (% 303-322-2308), and the larger
Fillmore Auditorium, 1510 Clarkson, at Colfax (% 303-837-1482), an all-
ages ballroom that has limited seating and a large dance floor.
Chapter 11: Denver 129

Drinking up
More beer is brewed in Denver than in any other U.S. city, and foamy,
frothy beverages flow liberally at establishments throughout town. No
matter what your preferred poison — be it a Bond-style martini or a
microbrew — you’re sure to find a place that serves it.
Lounges/martini bars
Lotus, 1701 Wynkoop St. (% 303-718-6666), next to Union Station in
LoDo, boasts velvet ropes, burly doormen, expensive martinis . . . what
more could a hipster want? For a slightly different experience, Fadó 
Irish Pub, 1735 19th St., next to the Denver Chophouse and Brewery 
(% 303-297-0066), runs the gamut of Irish pub experiences, from
leaded-glass-and-wainscoting Dublin elegance to the earthy, sawdust-
on-the-floor country inn — all under one roof! It feels a bit overpro-
duced, but honestly, it’s the only place outside of County Cork I’ve ever
had a properly poured pint of Guinness.
Brewpubs
Wynkoop Brewing Company, 1634 18th St. (% 303-297-2700; www.
wynkoop.com), gave birth to the modern American brewpub, and many
still consider it Denver’s best. Along with its great beer, Wynkoop may
serve the tastiest food of the area brewpubs, and an added attraction is
a large upstairs pool hall, which generally attracts a more party-hearty
crowd than the bar.
Breckenridge Brewery, 2220 Blake St. (% 303-297-3644; www.
breckenridgebrewery.com), has a convenient location kitty-corner 
to Coors Field and boasts some of the hottest selling microbrews in the
west. Rock Bottom Restaurant and Brewery, 1001 16th St. (% 303-534-
7616), usually has around 18 beers on tap, including one named for the
brewery’s cat, Splatz. It’s a popular stopping point for shoppers in the
Part III: The Front Range 
130
A clean, well-lighted place, indeed . . .
If you’re looking for something nonintoxicating — especially if you’re staying in 
the Uptown neighborhood — check out St. Mark’s Coffeehouse, 2019 E. 17th Ave. 
(% 303-322-8384). This family establishment has been caffeinating the local counter-
culture for years. The homemade brownies, pies, and pastries are legendary, and it’s
a good place for a light and inexpensive lunch, too, with panini and a rotating selec-
tion of soups. In the summer, the front windows are raised by a garage-door opener,
making the whole place as open-air as the sidewalk tables out front. Excellent local
artists display their work on the walls.
For those who want a beer or cocktail without the downtown scene, head next door
to The Thin Man, owned by the same folks, who present a serious range of micro-
brews and house-flavored vodka.

16th Street Mall, especially when its large patio is open. And the Coors-
owned Sandlot Brewing Company, inside Coors Field, sells handcrafted
beers with baseball-inspired names. It doesn’t open onto the field, but
you can hear the crowd while watching the game on TV.
Many local brewpubs — including Breckenridge and Rock Bottom —
offer free tours of the brewing process. Call ahead if you’re interested.
Sports bars
Denver, being one of America’s premier sports cities, hardly lacks for
sports bars. The biggest and best known of them is ESPN Zone, 1187
16th Street (% 303-595-3776), a place with more television sets (130)
than many underdeveloped nations. ESPN often does live feeds from the
bar during sporting events. The Zone also has food and lots of games
that simulate athleticism.
The performing arts
Denver may be best known as a sports town, but its performing-arts
scene is pretty active and has a loyal following. A Tony-winning theater
company, a symphony orchestra, a ballet, and a modern dance com-
pany, among other groups, can all be found in town. And when the big
Broadway productions go on tour, they always come out to Denver,
attracting theatergoers from throughout the Midwest and the mountains.
Tickets to some of the big shows are available through Ticketmaster 
(% 303-830-TIXS). The Denver Center for the Performing Arts box office
(% 800-641-1222 or 303-893-4100; www.denvercenter.org) handles
other attractions.
Performance venues
The hub of Denver’s arts community is the Denver Performing Arts
Complex, 14th and Curtis streets (% 303-640-PLEX; www.denver
center.org). Also known as “The Plex,” the Performing Arts Complex
covers four city blocks and has nine theaters totaling 10,000 seats. A
walkway under a giant glass arch connects the four theater buildings,
which range in age from 11 to 94 years.
Chapter 11: Denver 131
The red menace
Unless you’re from Michigan, think twice before setting foot in Tin Lizzie, 1410 Market
St. (% 720-932-0181). As the official home to displaced Detroit Red Wings fans, this
sports bar is as repulsive as a leper colony to most Denverites. It’s an especially loath-
some place when the Red Wings defeat their archrivals, the Colorado Avalanche.
Three words that will win you friends in Denver: Red Wings suck!

The oldest venue, The Auditorium Theatre, hosted the 1908 Democratic
National Convention and is now home to the Colorado Ballet and touring
Broadway musicals. Completed in 1978, Boettcher Concert Hall was the
nation’s first in-the-round symphony hall, with seating for 2,750. The
Colorado Symphony Orchestra and other performers take advantage of
the superb acoustics, which are adjusted by moving discs suspended
from the ceiling. The 2,800-seat Temple Buell Theater is the stomping
(and leaping) grounds of the Colorado ballet. And the Helen Bonfils
Theatre Complex houses five small performance venues, the smallest
being the 200-seat Source Theatre. A wide variety of productions are
staged in the complex each year.
Ballet
The Colorado Ballet (% 303-837-8888; www.coloradoballet.com)
leaps into action from October through May. Tickets range from $19 for
rear balcony seating to $101 for the prime spots.
Modern dance
The Cleo Parker Robinson Dance Company (% 303-295-1759), a multi-
cultural dance ensemble, celebrates “the universal language of move-
ment” in productions in fall, winter, and spring. It also has a year-round
dance school and outreach programs, including an intervention program
for troubled kids. They perform at both the Auditorium Theatre and the
Space Theater at the Plex. Tickets are $15 to $38.
Opera
Founded in 1981, Opera Colorado (% 303-778-1500; www.opera
colorado.org) performs three operas between February and May
every year. World-class performers often assume the leading roles.
Tickets range from $25 to $130.
Symphony
The Colorado Symphony Orchestra (% 303-893-4100; www.colorado
symphony.com) performs over 100 concerts a year, including classical,
pops, and family concerts. From September through June, they usually
play at the Boettcher Theater in Denver. Tickets cost $15 to $70.
Theater
The Denver Center Theater Company (% 303-893-3272 events line,
800-641-1222 or 303-893-4100 for tickets) won the 1998 Tony for best
regional theater company. It’s a very active company, staging 11 plays
between October and June every year. Offerings run the gamut from

If you like theatre on the edgier side, head down to the Acoma Center in
the Golden Triangle for a performance by the Curious Theatre Company
(% 303-623-0524; www.curioustheatre.org). They’ve been producing
excellent repertory plays and new works for several years, and are keep-
ing Denver’s cultural edge pretty sharp. Tickets cost $20 to $26.

Side Trips from Denver
In This Chapter
 Touring a trio of boomtowns
 Finding a slot machine you can call your own
 Navigating five classic Front Range mountain drives
Just a few miles west of Denver, the terrain becomes rugged and the
towns are steeped in mining history. Even if you feel most comfort-
able in a big city, don’t pass up the chance to take a day trip into the
foothills of the Rockies and beyond.
Riding through the Golden Circle
Golden, Idaho Springs, and Georgetown — collectively known as the
Golden Circle — boomed during Colorado’s first gold rush in 1859. Since
then, Golden has grown into a small city of 13,000, thanks in part to the
Coors Brewing Company, which operates the world’s largest brewery
there. Golden works hard to retain a Western flair, partly in honor of
Buffalo Bill Cody, who is buried outside the town. Idaho Springs has
flourished as a tourist hub, capitalizing on its mining past, its historical
hot springs, and its prime location on I-70 west of Denver. Georgetown
is the quietest town of the three, but it’s the most picturesque. It has a
neighborhood of well-preserved Victorian homes, a slow-paced but col-
orful downtown, and, during the summer months, a historic railroad.
Georgetown has great shopping, if you’re looking for art glass, mining
memorabilia, geological specimens, or other unique souvenirs. If
tchotchkes are your thing, skip the tourist traps on the 16th Street Mall
in Denver and head up here for the good stuff.
Getting there
Golden is 15 miles west of downtown Denver. You can get there by exit-
ing off I-70 onto either U.S. 6 or Colorado 58. Idaho Springs is 32 miles
west of Denver on I-70, and Georgetown is 13 miles west of Idaho Springs
on I-70.

Exploring Golden, Idaho Springs, and Georgetown
The grave of William “Buffalo Bill” Cody — the long-haired Pony Express
rider, buffalo hunter, soldier, and showman — sits atop the aptly named
Lookout Mountain (I-70, exit 256), between Interstate 70 (to the south)
and Golden (to the north). After paying your respects at the grave and
absorbing the views of Denver and the Plains, walk a few steps to the
Buffalo Bill Memorial Museum, 9871⁄2 E. Lookout Mountain Rd. (% 303-
526-0747; www.buffalobill.org). Established soon after Cody’s death
in 1917, the museum is loaded with colorful memorabilia from Cody’s
famous Wild West Show. There’s also a short video about the show,
which traveled the country for nearly 30 years before closing in 1913.
The museum is open daily from May through October 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.;
November through April, it’s open Tuesday through Sunday from 9 a.m.
to 4 p.m. Admission is $3 adults 16 and over, $2 seniors 65 and over, and
$1 for children ages 6 to 15.
The Colorado Railroad Museum, 17155 W. 44th Ave. in Golden (% 800-
365-6263 or 303-279-4591; www.crrm.org), exhibits thousands of his-
toric photos and documents relating to Colorado’s past and present 
railroads. You can rest your eyes by looking at larger antiques from
Colorado’s railroads or by clambering around on some of the 60 historic
locomotives and rail cars outside. Downstairs, put a quarter in the slot
and watch a large, painstakingly decorated model railroad in action. It’s
fun to see, even if you’re not a model-train buff. The museum is open
daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 6 p.m. in summer); admission is $7
adults, $6 seniors over 60, $4 for youths under 16, and $16 per family.
The Georgetown Loop Railroad, 1106 Rose St. in Georgetown (% 800-
691-4386 or 303-569-2403; www.georgetownloop.com), follows tracks
that are as interesting as the steam engine pulling the cars. In 1877, a
railroad company wanted to extend an existing narrow gauge (3-foot-
wide) rail line 2 miles from Georgetown to Silver Plume, 600 feet higher
than Georgetown but just 2 miles away. To keep the grades manageable,
the engineers needed to add as much distance as possible to the line, so
they built a 100-foot-high, 300-foot-long trestle where the track finishes
an ascending circle by crossing over itself. Today, the train completes
the 9-mile round-trip in an hour and ten minutes. Rides are offered daily
from mid-May through mid-September. You can catch the train in either
Georgetown or Silver Plume, 2 miles west of Georgetown on I-70. If you
depart from Silver Plume, you can also take a 70-minute mine tour as
part of the package. Trains depart every 80 minutes, daily, from late May
to early October. Tickets for just the train ride cost $14.50 adults, $9.50
for children ages 3 to 15. The train-and-mine tour package costs $20.50
adults, $13.50 children.
Indian Springs Resort, 302 Soda Creek Rd. in Idaho Springs (% 303-989-
6666; www.indianspringsresort.com), has indoor private baths, a
swimming pool, outdoor Jacuzzis, and mud baths, but what sets the
Chapter 12: Side Trips from Denver 135

place apart are its geothermal caves. Segregated by gender, each cave
has its own pools fed by geothermal hot springs. The pools are an
intense 104 to 112 degrees, and the air temperature inside the caves is in
the 90s, so you can really get roasted (if not toasted). Built in 1905, the
main resort building looks its age, and the men’s changing area resem-
bles a high-school locker room, but the caves make it worthwhile. The
caves are open 7:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. daily; admission (you must be at
least 13 years of age) costs $16.50 Monday through Thursday and $18.50
Friday through Sunday and holidays. The resort offers other bathing
options (indoor and outdoor), each with a separate price of admission. If
you’re too zapped to go anywhere after getting out of the caves, rent a
rustic room in the lodge or a room in newer buildings across the street.
Rooms at the resort range from $59 to $88 double.
Part III: The Front Range 
136
Gambling in Central City and Black Hawk
In 1990, a statewide referendum legalized gambling in Black Hawk, Central City, and
Cripple Creek (west of Pikes Peak). At the time, Black Hawk and Central City were
dilapidated remnants of what was once called “the richest square mile on Earth.”
Today, a few casinos have moved into the historic brick buildings in downtown Black
Hawk and Central City, and other buildings have been revamped and repaired.
Central City and Black Hawk are 34 miles west of Denver. Take I-70 west to exit 243 to
Central City Parkway. This new, four-lane road makes the trip to this region much safer
and faster than ever. You can self-park in the lots at some of the casinos; others require
valet parking. Free 24-hour shuttles regularly run between the two towns. Some of the
casinos also run buses to Denver. If you take a casino bus, you usually get your fare
back in vouchers for free food and drink and gambling tokens.
A Black Hawk city employee told me there was nothing to do in town but gamble. A
closer look reveals that there are, in fact, many activities: You can eat, drink, smoke,
stare, walk around, and, if you’re lucky enough to get a room, sleep. The town’s 24
casinos range from small rooms to sprawling, multistory complexes. Some offer poker
and blackjack tables; others have only slot and video machines. Most provide free
cocktails if you’re playing, and some have even exhumed Las Vegas lounge acts such
as Tony Orlando and Sha Na Na. Following are a couple of casino options to consider:
 The Mountain High Casino, 111 Richman St. (% 303-567-1234), boasts the most
impressive room. It’s decorated in the Colorado Rustic motif, replete with antler
lamps, fake logs, lamps that resemble rawhide, and murals of mountain scenes —
only, in this case, the rustic look is accompanied by dazzling lights and a bar with 
televisions the size of drive-in movie screens.
 If a tropical motif is more to your liking, go to Isle of Capri Casino, 401 Main St.
(% 800-THE-ISLE; www.isleofcapricasino.com/Black_Hawk). It has a
real, live tropical bird, a three-story waterfall, and fake palm trees — as well as
the most rooms in town.

Taking a tour
If the wait isn’t too long, the free Coors Brewery Tour (% 303-277-BEER)
is a winner: Just follow the signs to the parking area at 13th and Ford
streets in downtown Golden. Shuttles pick you up and take you to the
brewery entrance. Inside, you can look at displays on the history of
Coors; watch dewy commercials starring the company chairman, Pete
Coors; go on a 40-minute brewery tour; and then quaff 24 ounces of free
beer. Oddly enough, the tour is most interesting for what is not going on.
The brewery, the world’s largest, is so thoroughly mechanized that few
employees are visible and almost nothing moves until you reach the
packaging area. The wait can be long on summer afternoons, and it may
not always be worth it (except, of course, for the free beer).
If your main goal at the Coors Brewery is to down a couple free beers,
tell the people in front that you want to go on a short tour or beer tast-
ing. They’ll point you to the taps. Tours run Monday through Saturday
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission is free.
The best mine tour in the Front Range is the Phoenix Mine Tour
(% 303-567-0422; www.phoenixmine.com), a small operation just out-
side Idaho Springs on Trail Creek Road (off Stanley Road). As part of the
tour, you get a hard hat and then get to accompany a real miner on foot
into a working gold mine. After the tour, you can pan for gold in a nearby
creek; you can keep whatever you find. The cost is $9 for adults, $8 for
seniors, and $5 for children under 12. It’s open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily,
even during winter if the road is passable. To reach the mine, follow
Colorado Boulevard west through Idaho Springs, go under the bridge,
and follow the signs.
Hitting the slopes
Travelers heading west from Denver on I-70 may catch a glimpse of a few
runs near the base of Loveland Ski Area (% 800-736-3SKI or 303-571-
5580; www.skiloveland.com) just before disappearing into Eisenhower
tunnel, which crosses the continental divide by going directly under the
hill. What they don’t see is a beautiful ski area, particularly when the
weather is calm and fair. Much of the skiable terrain is above the tree
line, in a vast, horseshoe-shaped basin that sits flush against the east
side of the continental divide. Loveland allows skiers of all ability levels
to sample the joy of skiing at high elevations on open faces where the air
is so thin and fresh it seems to hum. The best skiing is off Lift 9, the high-
est four-person chairlift in North America, which unloads you atop the
continental divide at 12,700 feet in elevation. From there, you can head
in either direction, eventually dropping in wherever the terrain intrigues
you. Lift lines here are usually short, and the base area, which has ample
parking, tends to be relaxed. The main drawback to this mountain is its
potentially ferocious storms. But that same weather contributes to
the 400-inch annual snowfall here, which allows the resort to stay open
into May.
Chapter 12: Side Trips from Denver 137

For $38, Loveland offers a four-hour lift ticket that goes into effect the
moment it is sold, no matter what time of day it is. Buy this $38 ticket,
ski four hours straight, and then call it a day. You’ll save money, enjoy
a great day of skiing, and quit before your legs get too tired.
For the vital facts and figures on Loveland Ski Area, see the chart on the
inside back cover of this book.
Where to stay and dine
Each of the 72 rooms at the faux-adobe Table Mountain Inn, 1310
Washington Ave. in Golden (% 800-762-9898 or 303-277-9898; www.
tablemountaininn.com), has its own, unique Southwestern décor, and
most rooms have a private deck with a view of the town and the surround-
ing hills. The location at the edge of Golden’s historic downtown is even
better, and the prices are best of all. The rates — $132 to $214 double —
are fixed year-round, so what seems like a fair price on a fall weekday
becomes a steal on a summer weekend. During peak season, the inn often
sells out a month or more in advance, so be sure to book early.
The Georgetown Mountain Inn, 1100 Rose St. in Georgetown (% 303-
569-3201; www.georgetownmountaininn.com), is just 11 miles from the
Loveland Ski Area and has some of the most reasonable rooms near
Denver. All have ceiling fans and tables, and the upgraded rooms have log
furniture, wood-paneled walls, refrigerators, microwaves, and oversized
bathrooms. In-season rates run from $61 to $100. For an extra $8, it’s
worth getting an upgraded room. The inn also has an outdoor swimming
pool and hot tub, and offers free coffee and pastries every morning.
Make your dinner reservations early for Hilltop Café, 1518 Washington
Ave. in Golden (% 303-279-8151), because it sometimes fills up days in
advance. Perched in a historic home near Golden’s downtown, Hilltop
Café happily dishes up traditional dishes that have been enhanced for
the new millennium. The chef, Ian Kleinman, changes the menu regularly
Part III: The Front Range 
138
The Front Range’s best pizza
New York thin-crust aficionados and Chicago deep-dish fans beware: The best pizza
experience in America awaits you in Idaho Springs. Beau Jo’s (1517 Miner St.; % 303-
567-4376; $6.50–$19) has set the standard for post-skiing, appetite-sating bliss since
1973. They call their pizzas “Mountain Pies” — and the pies certainly live up to the
name. From toppings as traditional as pepperoni to as exotic as fontina cheese or giar-
diniera peppers, and offering several different crusts and sauces, Beau Jo’s fashions
pizzas that put California Pizza Kitchen to shame. Beau Jo’s has plenty of salads and
vegetarian options for the pizza, as well. Denverites long ago made a habit of stopping
here while heading down from the slopes, so on Saturday or Sunday, get here early
or be ready to wait.

to use the freshest ingredients and is known for his ever-evolving soups.
The room, with large windows and widely spaced tables, is as pleasing
as the fare. Main courses at dinnertime will set you back $15 to $25.
The Red Ram & Rathskeller, 606 Sixth St. in Georgetown (% 303-569-
2300), has very normal dinner fare such as burgers, fried chicken,
and steaks, not to mention oversized (but still normal) salads and a
handful of Mexican dishes. What makes this restaurant noteworthy is
its atmosphere — a historic 1876 building replete with vintage signs,
photos of old Georgetown, and a hand-carved bar that is said to have
been dragged here by horse and buggy from Oregon. Great for families.
A dinner entree at the restaurant costs between $5.95 and $15.
Georgetown’s best meals are at Café Prague, 511 Rose St. (% 303-569-
2861), where hearty portions of central European soul food warms you
up fast on cool summer mountain days, and makes for great après-ski on
your way down from the slopes. Schnitzel, sausages, and wonderfully fla-
vorful red sauerkraut dominate the menu. The décor is not fancy; it fea-
tures stock photos of — you guessed it — Prague, and of Avalanche star
Milan Hejduk and other Czech hockey greats.
Following Five Classic Mountain Drives
From April through early November, the mountains and foothills of the
Front Range are great for just wandering around in. Early September,
in particular, makes for great driving: The aspen are turning, the air is
crisp, and the sky is the deepest blue. Shocking waves of gold and crim-
son cascade down the slopes, framed by the deep green of the Douglas
firs and the bright, puffy white clouds caught in the autumn winds. High
drama, indeed. New England can keep her maple trees; I’ll take the stark
beauty of the West any day.
Guanella Pass Road
Officially designated a National Scenic and Historic Byway, this 22-mile
long road takes you up to 11,669 feet above sea level, with gorgeous views
and fun mountain driving along the way. Start in Georgetown and follow
the signs to the steep road out of town; you’ll pass the old Silverdale
mining camp, and some of the best aspen-viewing country in Colorado
along the way. Pavement gives way to gravel toward the top, but it’s an
easy drive for any car (not so easy for RVs) and sets you down in Grant,
on U.S. 285. Head back to Denver via Bailey and Conifer.
Mount Evans
The road to the summit of this fourteener (a local term for mountains that
top 14,000 feet in elevation), also a National Scenic and Historic Byway, is
open only during summer, from Memorial Day to Labor Day. From Idaho
Springs, follow the signs for the Mount Evans road (Colorado 103) at exit
240 from I-70. Just past Echo Lake, turn right on Colorado 5 and continue
Chapter 12: Side Trips from Denver 139

up past the tree line to the 14,264-foot summit and the incredible views —
on a clear day, you can see nearly to Kansas. Seriously! And you can
say you bagged a fourteener (just don’t tell anyone you did it in a car).
Summit Lake, on the way up, is the highest wheelchair accessible lake
in the United States. After Labor Day, stay on Colorado 103 and go over
Squaw Pass and down into Bergen Park. This has been a favorite Sunday
morning aspen-viewing drive in my family for years.
St. Mary’s Glacier
Alaskans will get a good belly laugh out of what Coloradans call a glacier,
but we think it’s pretty cool nonetheless. This year-round ice deposit is
all that remains of one of the glaciers that carved out the Front Range
during the last ice age, about 12,000 years ago. Two miles west of Idaho
Springs, take exit 238 off I-70 onto Fall River Road and follow it all the
way up to the glacier area. The road is steep and curvy — so watch out
in winter — but it’s a lot of fun, and the hiking is great if you decide to
get out of the car. The snowshoeing and cross-country skiing are phe-
nomenal in winter, and it’s all doable in a half-day trip from Denver.
The Peak-to-Peak Highway
This combination of Colorado highways 119, 7, and 72 runs from Black
Hawk to Estes Park, through more spectacular aspen-viewing territory
over Rollins Pass, through old mining camps, and along the southeast-
ern flank of Rocky Mountain National Park. For the full experience, I rec-
ommend starting in Golden and taking U.S. 6 up through Clear Creek
Canyon to Black Hawk and heading north from there. You go through the
towns of Nederland, with its rock shops and aging hippies, and Ward,
with its famously misanthropic residents, past great hiking in the park
along St. Vrain Creek on the Ouzel Falls Trail outside Allenspark, and
down into Estes Park. A good day’s itinerary would start early and aim
for lunch in Estes Park and dinner in Boulder later on. You can also skip
Estes Park entirely and go down beautiful Boulder Canyon from
Nederland on Colorado 119.
U.S. 285 to South Park and beyond
This is my favorite, and one of the all-time great Colorado experiences.
Hampden Avenue, running across southern Denver and Englewood,
becomes a freeway and heads southwest through Turkey Creek Canyon
past Aspen Park and Conifer, down Crow Hill into Bailey and the Platte
Canyon, and up past Grant and the southern end of Guanella Pass Road.
Then it curves up and around Kenosha Pass, and here you have to be
careful: Don’t let go of the steering wheel when the jaw-dropping sight of
South Park comes into view. The road works its way south, past Fairplay
and Route 9 to Breckenridge, through the great ranching country of
South Park. You could make a day’s trip out of fishing the valley’s two
big artificial lakes, Spinney Mountain Reservoir and Antero Reservoir, or
along the banks of the South Platte River and its tributaries. Or you can
continue on 285 over Trout Creek Pass and head down into the Upper
Part III: The Front Range 
140

Arkansas Valley. This is where you move from the Front Range into the
heart of the high country — you see the forest change from ponderosa
pine and Douglas fir to piñons and junipers, and hold onto the steering
wheel again when the Collegiate Peaks of the Sawatch Range come into
view. Turn right at the bottom of the valley, and you’ll be in Buena Vista,
where you can lunch if you set out by 8 or 9 a.m. From here, Colorado is
your Rocky Mountain oyster, as you can head north to Leadville, west to
Aspen, or south to the San Juans or the San Luis Valley. Or stay in Buena
Vista and have an afternoon of whitewater rafting (see Chapter 18.)
Chapter 12: Side Trips from Denver 141
Where to get your kicks
It’s not Route 66 exactly, but head down to Evergreen for some classic mountain cul-
ture. For years, famous musicians such as Leon Russell, Dave Mason, Greg Allman,
and Jerry Jeff Walker have played the Little Bear Saloon, 28075 Colorado 74 (% 303-
674-9991; www.littlebearsaloon.com). It’s a great old mountain roadhouse,
complete with lingerie — donated on-the-spot by audience members — hanging from
the ceiling.
If you’re looking for elegance and sophistication, look elsewhere, but if you want to say
you’ve got friends in low places, this is one of Colorado’s traditional places to start.
And you’re likely to catch some legendary music in the process.

L
ooking for a fun town with multiple-personality disorder? Look no
further. Originally a mining camp, Boulder has been a quiet farming
hub, a rowdy college town, a cauldron of space-age technology, a health-
nut’s paradise, and a nexus of new-age spirituality — all rolled into one.
The town and its personality are unquestionably dominated by the
University of Colorado, a school of 25,000 known for attracting both the
most talented aerospace engineers and the most dedicated ski bums.
But the cutting-edge science pursued by the university and government
institutions are balanced by such touchy-feely and left-brained organiza-
tions as the Rolf Institute and Naropa University (the nation’s only four-
year Buddhist college). In recent years, Boulder’s high-tech sector has
produced much of the software that powers the Internet age; at the
same time, though, the town has worked hard to maintain the open
space surrounding it as a nature preserve and as one of the best net-
works for hiking, biking, and rock-climbing in the country.
Boulder has its share of microbreweries, and the Pearl Street Mall that
anchors the Downtown area is a vibrant shopping-and-dining district
where you can feast on Tibetan food or deep-dish pizza and buy anything
from African masks to kites and yo-yos. For nightlife, the local arts com-
munity is large and prolific, and the local audience is sophisticated: The
university houses the Colorado Shakespeare Festival in the summer, and
draws world-class performers throughout the year to its various stages
and concert halls. Venues such as the Boulder Theatre, Chautauqua
Auditorium, and Fox Theatre bring in the best touring acts, and you can
always find a local jam-band or two playing somewhere if you want to
relive your Deadhead days.
Face it: If you’re in the mood to climb a canyon wall, take in a Buddhist
tea ceremony, check up on the latest global warming research, quaff
some local brew, and see some world-class Shakespeare — all in the
same day — then Boulder is clearly the place for you. The towering
Flatirons (enormous slabs of sandstone stabbing upward above the city)
say it all: This place has rugged beauty to burn, and the sky’s the limit.

Getting There
Denver International Airport (DIA), 40 miles southeast of Boulder, is
the closest airport with commercial service. Most major domestic carri-
ers and a few international ones fly into DIA, and major rental-car com-
panies have desks at the airport. For details about navigating DIA (and
which airlines fly in and out of DIA), check out Chapter 11. You can find
information on contacting individual airlines and car-rental agencies in
the appendix at the back of this book.
Between 3 a.m. and 9 p.m. daily, Denver’s Regional Transportation
District (RTD; % 303-299-6000; www.rtd-denver.com) provides hourly
bus rides to Denver International Airport (and other Denver locations)
from the Boulder main transit terminal at 14th and Walnut streets.
Service from DIA to Boulder runs from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. (Call for the
exact schedule.) Known as skyRide, the service costs $10, and exact
change is required in either bills or coins. To catch the skyRide buses
leaving DIA, go to Level 5 of the main terminal.
RTD’s regional B-Line between Boulder and Denver can be a great way
to visit both cities without switching accommodations. The line runs
from Boulder’s Walnut Street Station to Union Station and Market Street
Station in LoDo, where you can connect with the 16th Street Mall shuttle
or Denver’s light-rail system. The B-Line trip takes less than an hour, and
it’s a great way to avoid the hellish commuter traffic on U.S. 36. Do pay
attention to the schedule, though; buses run every 15 minutes during
rush hour, but slow to once an hour during off-peak times. The last bus
leaves either terminal at 1 a.m.
SuperShuttle Boulder (% 800-BLUE-VAN or 303-227-0000; www.yellow
trans.com) offers van service between Boulder and DIA. The drivers
make regular stops at major hotels, and they detour to residences upon
request. To go from Boulder to the airport, make your reservation at
least 24 hours in advance. Coming from Denver to Boulder, just go to the
SuperShuttle desk on Level 5 of the main terminal. Cost for the trip to a
regular SuperShuttle stop is $20 for adults and $10 for kids ages 8 to 16;
there’s no charge for children under 8. The fare to an unscheduled stop
is $25 for the first person, $10 for each additional person. (Children
under 8 are still free.)
A more expedient — and expensive — way to go from DIA to Boulder is
in a cab. Just go to the taxi stand and ask for a ride. To go from Boulder
to DIA, call Boulder Yellow Cab (% 303-777-7777), which charges a $70
flat rate for up to five passengers.
To drive from Denver to Boulder, take I-25 north and then head northeast
on the Boulder Turnpike (U.S. 36). From Fort Collins and points north,
take I-25 south and then head southeast on Colorado 119. Boulder is 55
miles south of Fort Collins.

Boulder’s north–south streets are numbered, with Third Street flush
against the foothills and the numbers increasing as you head from west
to east (see the nearby “Boulder” map). Foothills Parkway (Colorado
157) is the main north–south artery on the east side of town. However,
U.S. 36 brings you closer to the downtown area. Heading northeast from
Denver, it veers north in Boulder and becomes 28th Street. From U.S. 36
you can reach the heart of the downtown by turning west on Canyon
Boulevard (Colorado 119 and 7) and then north on Broadway (Colorado
7). Two blocks north of Canyon Boulevard on Broadway, you cross Pearl
Street, the hub of downtown Boulder. If you continue west on Canyon
Boulevard, you’ll head up into the mountains via Boulder Canyon.
Driving in Boulder is fairly easy, though not always expedient. Certain
roads get congested, and parking spaces can be hard to find. In the down-
town area during the day, you usually have to pay for a spot. The curb-
side meters take nickels, dimes, and quarters. Every 5¢ buys just four
minutes of liberty, so empty out your piggybank before going to town.
During summer, you can find free parking in the residential neighborhood
of The Hill just west of the campus of the University of Colorado (locally
known as CU — Colorado State University alums, insert your own joke
here); if you want to explore the campus and take in the funky shops and
bars on The Hill, this is the way to go, then take the HOP or SKIP (see the
next paragraph) into downtown.
Boulder has a highly efficient bus system that serves destinations
throughout the city and travels as far away as Denver. Many routes run
at ten-minute intervals during peak periods, making the bus a great way
to get around. The City of Boulder operates the HOP line, which makes
40 stops on a loop through the downtown area. Call % 303-447-8282 for
information on HOP service. Another useful line, SKIP, goes north and
south on Broadway. Denver’s Regional Transportation District oversees
SKIP and other Boulder County routes. For information on those lines,
call % 800-366-7433 or 303-299-6000, or surf the Internet to www.rtd-
denver.com. You can also pick up an RTD Boulder County bus map at
locations throughout town. HOP and SKIP fares are 75¢, 25¢ for seniors
60 and over. Most other local RTD routes cost $1.10 for adults, 55¢ for
seniors over 60. Exact change is required.
If the bus doesn’t show up, you can always call Boulder Yellow Cab
(% 303-777-7777) or Metro Taxi (% 303-666-6666). The taxi companies
don’t have a strong presence on the streets, so you’ll almost certainly
need to pick up a phone and dial.
You can easily ride a bike through much of Boulder. Many roads have
bike lanes, and you can also use the Boulder Creek Path, which extends
16 miles on a general east–west course through town and is popular
among local cyclists, rollerbladers, joggers, and walkers. University

Bicycles, Ninth and Pearl (% 303-444-4196), rents town bikes ($20 for
one day, $30 for two) and mountain bikes ($25 for one day, $45 for two).
Locks and helmets are included in the price.
Where to Stay
Lodging in Boulder costs a lot (Chapter 8 includes an explanation of the
dollar signs used here to indicate price ranges). You can save a few dol-
lars by staying in a chain hotel on the east side of town, but the best way
to find an affordable room is to time your visit carefully. Besides its busy
summer season, Boulder’s hotels fill up during college events, such as
parents’ weekends, graduation, and home football games. If you want to
visit Boulder on a budget, schedule around these events — and, if possi-
ble, at times other than July and August.
Boulder University Inn
$–$$
Boulder
This two-story 1960s-era motor lodge, just two blocks from Pearl Street,
has rooms that look older than those at the Quality Inn, and it’s near a busy
intersection. But dozens of shops and restaurants are within walking dis-
tance, the rooms are clean, and the prices are fair.

Colorado Chautauqua Association
$$–$$$$
Boulder
Anyone who has a cultural bent should spend a few days in one of the 60
cottages rented out by the Colorado Chautauqua Association. Situated on
26 acres at the base of the Flatiron Mountains, these clean, rustic, Arts and
Crafts–style dwellings date back to the early 1900s. They have hardwood
floors, screened-in porches, and gas stoves, but no TVs. Rather than watch
Regis, you’re supposed to become part of a community that’s engaged in
intellectual and cultural endeavors. This isn’t as daunting as it may sound.
In between naps, you just go to any concerts, forums, classes, and films
that interest you; during summer at least, you have many options to
choose from. (For more on cultural offerings at Chautauqua, check out the
hotel’s Web site.) As for food, you can cook in your room or eat in the
Chautauqua Dining Hall, which is fancier than the name implies.
Chautauqua borders a large mountain park, so you can start hiking right
outside your door.

Foot of the Mountain Motel
$–$$
Boulder
Located near the mouth of Boulder Canyon, this motel is nine blocks from
downtown, so the walk to the shopping district is a little farther than from
other area lodges. The trade-off is the motel’s wooded location across from
the Eben G. Fine Park, where you can cool off in Boulder Creek. Built in the
early 1930s, the one-story motel buildings look like lodging for Santa’s
elves. They — the buildings, that is — have rough-hewn pine exteriors, red
trim, and green roofs. Inside the 19 rooms, you find knotty pine walls and
desks, as well as old-style bathrooms with medicine cabinets and (usually)
showers instead of tubs. There’s no air-conditioning, but two windows in
each room help create a draft, especially when you turn the fan on.

Hotel Boulderado
$$$$
Boulder
You can easily recognize this Boulder landmark by the bright green
canopies on the building, by its imposing five stories of red brick, and by
its location mere steps from the Pearl Street Mall. Built in 1909, its sump-
tuous lobby has Victorian furniture, a cherry-wood staircase, and colorful
rugs, all under a ceiling of Italian stained glass. You can stay in the historic
hotel, where the rooms are old and full of antiques, or in a more recent
addition, where the rooms are full of reproductions. For the most memo-
rable experience, ask for a corner room in the older building — these
rooms provide a little more light, air, and history.

Millennium Harvest House
$$–$$$$
Boulder
This hotel, the largest in Boulder, is a great bet for weekend getaways, or
as a base for exploring the Boulder area and the northern parts of the
Front Range. The rooms are tastefully furnished with Art Nouveau accents
in rich wood and copper; wall-to-wall windows face the mountains on one
side of the building (ask for a west-facing room). And the staff provides
small luxuries, including nightly turndowns and three complimentary
morning newspapers. If you want to exercise, you can use the pool, tennis
courts, or fitness room, or you can jog on the Boulder Creek Path, which
skirts the edge of the property. The hotel also has a good restaurant and
room service.

Boulder
This bed-and-breakfast has a prime location near the action on Pearl Street
but is surprisingly quiet. The rooms have such amenities as quilts and
antiques, and all but one have a wood-burning fireplace. The prices could
be lower, but this really is a prime spot.

Quality Inn and Suites Boulder Creek
$$
Boulder
This inn is tucked into a mostly residential neighborhood at the southeast
edge of downtown. Most of the rooms are distanced from Arapahoe
Avenue, so they’re quiet even though the Boulder Creek Path passes
nearby, and the heart of Boulder’s downtown is only about five blocks
away. Rooms have furniture made from pine branches, watched over by
framed photographs of the owner’s dog, and all of them have refrigerators
and microwaves. There’s also a workout room, hot tub, pool, and guest
laundry. A hot breakfast is included in the rates.

Just opening at press time, this brand-new hotel is promising great things

concierge and an evening turndown service, and it aims to pamper guests
in every way imaginable.

Where to Dine
Boulder restaurants don’t allow smoking, tend to be health-conscious,
and have great chefs, many of whom have come here for the lifestyle.
As you’d expect in a college town, Boulder has plenty of cheap ethnic
places and pizza joints, plus a few brewpubs. Near the Pearl Street Mall,
you can also find brightly decorated, trendy, expensive restaurants,
Chapter 13: Boulder 149

much like the ones in Denver’s LoDo area (see Chapter 11 for more about
Denver). Many of these restaurants have popular bars that border the
regular seating. If you give them a try, you may end up eating gourmet
food in an environment that’s surprisingly festive.

actual dollars, check out the introduction of this book.

The Hill
DINER FARE
This greasy-spoon, best at breakfast time, has been filling up CU students
for over a decade. It’s tucked inside a strip mall, and you may have to wait
a bit, but it’s worth it for the pancakes, grits, and huevos rancheros (eggs
with green chili). You can enjoy plenty of vegetarian options, too.

Flagstaff Hill
NEW AMERICAN
Half the locals I interviewed loved this pricey Boulder landmark; the other
half expressed disappointment. Yet everyone could appreciate the sweep-
ing views of the plains through the mostly glass walls, and all agreed that
the service stands out. Owned and operated by the same family since 1971,
the elegant and romantic dining room sets the stage for a regularly chang-
ing menu that specializes in seafood and Rocky Mountain game. Starters
may feature rabbit, pheasant, quail, scallops, or even lobster. And don’t
be surprised to find Colorado buffalo or venison on the entree list, right
there next to Alaskan halibut or Hawaiian big eye tuna.
See map p. 146. 1138 Flagstaff Rd. % 303-442-4640. Reservations recommended.

The Full Moon Grill & Pasta
$$–$$$
Village Shopping Center
NORTHERN ITALIAN
If you love fresh seafood served with handmade pasta, head for the Full
Moon Grill before the opportunity wanes. Succulent dishes such as the
freeform ravioli (housemade pasta, scallops, fennel, fresh fish, and toma-
toes in a saffron-chardonnay broth) and the linguini alla sardegna (sword-
fish, tomato, garlic, saffron mint, and white wine) may be gone tomorrow.
Dip your bread in olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and wax eloquent over a
bottle from the immense wine list. Unlike other Boulder eateries, you don’t
have to howl to be heard here. Once a hamburger joint, the sun-splashed,
octagonal dining room takes on ambience when the sun’s last glow gives
way to candlelight — and moonlight, too.

Jax Fish House
$$–$$$
Downtown
SEAFOOD
Along with the best martinis in town, Jax has some of the freshest fish. The
restaurant has fresh oysters, clams, and mussels flown in daily, and its
nearly living “filet mignon of tuna” has a devoted following. (The filet is a
2-inch-thick slab of tuna, barely seared and served with scallion hash
browns, sweet soy, and pickled ginger.) Because Jax serves seafood, it
covers its tables with paper. And because it covers its tables with paper,
it gives crayons to customers. The restaurant learned too late that cus-
tomers who have crayons and martinis in hand can be trouble; that’s why
the brick walls in here look like a coloring book. If you’re looking for a
quiet, romantic evening, forget Jax. This place rocks on the weekends,
especially when the bar at the front of the room fills up.

$
Downtown
TEX-MEX /PUB FARE
The menu here is ’70s–style healthfood with a nod toward Mexico; the bur-
ritos and burgers are standard, but hearty. Plenty of vegetarian options
are on hand, and for lunch or an early dinner, it’s a great family choice.
Again, this being a brewpub, the beers are the stars, with a large number
of house brews and a rotating cast of guest beers from other regional and
national microbreweries. The Colorado Kind Ale is rich and extremely
hoppy, if you’re into that sort of thing; the Raspberry Wheat, by contrast,
is very light and fruity. After hours on weekends features live music —
mostly jam bands and world beat.

Rhumba
$$
Downtown
CARIBBEAN
On certain summer nights, this place becomes a huge party. Servers in
tropical shirts push through crowds of singles to make sure the people on
the patio get their rum drinks in time. The enthusiasm swells when those
potent drinks take hold, and the crowds from the bar spill over into the
seating area. During my meal here, I couldn’t help feeling as if my gourmet
dinner and I had together parachuted into a Club Med. With so much activ-
ity, it’s easy to overlook the delicious food, which has sweet Caribbean
ingredients such as mango, coconut, and pineapple. Among the many
options, you can get half jerk chicken over black beans with coconut rice,
or simplify things (sort of) by ordering a cheeseburger with boniato french
fries and banana guava ketchup.

Sunflower Natural Fine Dining
$$
Downtown
GOURMET NATURAL FOODS
The Sunflower’s menu announces that the restaurant shuns preservatives,
additives, and artificial ingredients; that it seeks organically grown ingre-
dients free of synthetic chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides; and
that it uses only aluminum-free cookware, non-irradiated herbs and spices,
and Celtic sea salt. That part of the menu has about as much charm as
your average corporate mission statement, but the food itself is surpris-
ingly flavorful. Naturally enough, the restaurant serves many vegetarian
dishes, but you can also order meaty items such as buffalo steak, seafood
cioppino, and fresh Alaskan halibut.
See map p. 146. 1701 Pearl St. % 303-440-0220. Reservations accepted. Main
courses: $15–$26. AE, MC, V. Open Tues–Fri 11 a.m.–2:30 p.m.; Tues–Sat 5–10 p.m.,
Sun 5–9 p.m.
Walnut Brewery
$$
Downtown 
PUB FARE
Boulder’s first brewpub, the Walnut’s great range of brews and imagina-
tive takes on pub food make this place stand out. Start with the chicken
quesadillas, served with chipotle sour cream, then move on to the buffalo
fajitas, alder-smoked salmon, or one of several steaks. You may also
choose from a variety of fish dishes or, for somewhat clearer arteries, one
of the many vegetarian options. The wine list is pedestrian — focus on the
beer! The menu makes great suggestions for food/beer pairings, but let me
point out the St. James Irish Red, great with most of the food here, or the
Devil’s Thumb Stout, an extremely dark, rich, full-bodied beer that goes
down very, very smoothly. Careful, now. . . .

CONTEMPORARY SOUTHWESTERN
This trendy restaurant presents a spicy, smoky, gourmet version of
Southwestern food. Key ingredients include habanero and chipotle pep-
pers, strong cheeses, and succulent meats such as duck, ahi tuna, and
pulled pork. The tough part is deciding which way you’d like to be over-
powered. Choices include the likes of barbeque duck tacos, blackberry
habanero pork chops (served with goat cheese), and wild mushroom
enchiladas. The room, which is mostly red and yellow, feels just as warm
and rich as the food.

Exploring Boulder
In Boulder, you don’t have to do much to have a good time. You just have
to be there and see what happens. Sometimes it’s best not to even judge
what’s good and bad.
The best things to see and do
Okay, some of us get paid to judge things. If fate smiles upon you, you
will get to judge some of the following for yourself:
 Sip tea in paradise. Dushanbe Teahouse, 1770 13th St. (% 303-
442-4993; www.boulderteahouse.com), looks like something the
deep subconscious might unveil in an enlightened state. A gift from
the city of Dushanbe, Tajikstan, it took 40 artisans three years to
hand carve and hand paint the teahouse. When they finished, they
shipped it in crates to the United States, where it sat for several
years before being reassembled next to Central Park in downtown
Boulder. Under a large skylight at the center of the room sits the
Fountain of the Seven Beauties, whose name pretty much describes
the scene. The teahouse serves hundreds of teas; on a hot day, a
Hibiscus Cooler is just the ticket. The menu is decidedly non-Tajik;
it’s best described as a fusion of Mexican, Asian, and European
peasant cuisines. If you don’t feel like eating, come for tea between
3 and 5 p.m. Or simply look around; you’re encouraged to visit even
if you buy nothing. Admission is free. It’s open Sunday through
Thursday from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Friday and Saturday from 
8 a.m. to 10 p.m.
 Watch human tricks. Shopping is anything but dull at Pearl Street
Mall, on Pearl between 11th and 15th streets (% 303-449-3774).
During summer, you pass street vendors, sidewalk cafes, and, best of
all, street performers, including balloon-artists, escape masters, con-
tortionists, opera singers, and tightrope-walkers. The performers yell
in order to be heard over the crowds, single out audience members
for special attention, and aggressively pass the hat when they’re
done. Together they make the place more medieval than mall-like.
The shops are fun, too (I highlight a few of them in the “Shopping”
section later in this chapter), with independent bookstores dotting
the area and stores selling everything from kites to CDs.
 Hide out near the Boulder Creek Path. Like Boulder itself, this
paved pedestrian path connects the mountains and the plains. It
parallels Boulder Creek downstream for 16 miles, beginning 4 miles
up Boulder Canyon and ending on the east side of town, within
mooing distance of the plains. The path crosses no streets and has
many small, leafy parks alongside it. Starting from the west end,
you pass Elephant Rocks, a rock-climbing and bouldering (that is,
boulder climbing) hot spot. Just below the mouth of the canyon,
you go through shady Eben G. Fine Park, perfect for picnicking,
soaking, and cooling off. Another mile or so to the east, behind the
Chapter 13: Boulder 153

Millennium Hotel, you can look at trout through small, murky win-
dows into the creek. Speed-walkers, inline-skaters, runners, and
cyclists all blaze down the path, yet many others use the area as a
giant natural sedative. On summer afternoons, if you peek through
the foliage at the water-smoothed boulders and the creekside park
benches, you’ll see dozens of people relaxing. It doesn’t matter how
you use the path, just make sure to spend some time there.
Other things to see and do
Boulder has a host of smaller museums, libraries, and galleries, includ-
ing venues on two local campuses:
 When a Tibetan meditation master, Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche,
founded Boulder’s Naropa Institute in 1974, he envisioned a place
“where East meets west and sparks . . . fly” — and fly they did,
especially when free-thinkers such as Allen Ginsberg and Ann
Waldman were teaching there. Today, Naropa University (% 800-
603-3117 or 303-245-4819; www.naropa.edu) still merges Western
scholarship and Eastern contemplation. The college is home to
Ginsberg’s personal library and one of the country’s most impor-
tant spoken-word archives. The institute opens certain workshops,
classes, and performances to the public. And its library is a must-
see for people interested in Eastern religion and alternative thera-
pies. For information on performances, call % 303-245-4715.
 The Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art, 1750 13th St. (% 303-
443-2122; www.bmoca.org), displays cutting-edge work by nation-
ally known artists. The exhibits change every three months and
include paintings, collages, mixed media, ceramics, and installa-
tions. There’s also an area for readings, performances, and discus-
sions. Admission is $4 for adults, $3 for students and seniors 55
and up. The museum is open Tuesday through Saturday from
11 a.m. to 6 p.m.

154
A perfect day in Boulder
A warm spring, summer, or fall day in Boulder means you need to be outdoors. Start
at the Pearl Street Mall and get yourself a kite at Into The Wind (see the “Shopping”
section later in this chapter for details). On a Saturday, walk two blocks west to the
Boulder Farmer’s Market (open Apr–Nov 8 a.m.–2 p.m.; www.boulderfarmers.
org) and check out the amazing, locally grown organic produce and food. There’s
always live music, a food court, and kids’ activities, in addition to a once-a-month
crafts fair. Hang out and have lunch, or pick up some fresh food and head over to
Chautauqua Park, have a picnic, and fly your kite! Finish off with dinner at a great
restaurant downtown, and watch the buskers on the mall (and don’t forget to give them
a buck when they’ve blown your mind.)

 If you went to the universities of Nebraska, Oklahoma, or Michigan,
think twice before blindly wandering where the Buffalo roam. The
University of Colorado at Boulder (www.colorado.edu) has
25,000 students, and like most big state schools, football rivalries
are taken very seriously here. So leave the sweatshirt with the big
red “N” in the car! The campus can be a little confusing; most of the
buildings are built of the same yellow-and-pink sandstone, which
comes from a quarry in nearby Lyons. You can avoid getting lost by
going straight to the information desk at the University Memorial
Center, 1669 Euclid (at Broadway), and picking up a campus map.
Then you’ll be able to locate attractions such as The University of
Colorado Natural History Museum, The Heritage Center (dedi-
cated to the history of the university), and The Fiske Planetarium,
all of which are open to the public.
Campus tours for prospective students are offered weekdays at
9:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. and Saturdays at 10:30 a.m., but first you
need to make a reservation by calling % 303-492-6301, option 2.
The university discourages regular visitors from taking them, but
if you’re curious, go ahead. Tours leave from the University Club
on the southeast corner of Broadway and Euclid.
Staying active
The national media regularly lauds Boulder as one of the most fit, healthy,
and recreation-friendly towns in the country. Some of the praise goes to
the town’s abundant water, rock, and forest, including more than 30,000
acres of open space. The rest goes to the townspeople themselves, who
make a point of getting out and enjoying their resources. When in Boulder,
set aside a few hours for the following:
 Cycling and mountain biking: Bicycling isn’t just a sport here; it’s
the main form of transportation for many residents, even in winter.
On 100 miles of bike lanes and multiuse paths, you can pedal most
places in Boulder without risking your neck. Alas, the mountain
biking in Boulder could be better. To avoid conflicts between
cyclists and hikers, the city closed many of the hiking trails nearest
town to bicycling. Most of the best off-road cycling is a few miles
farther out — or uphill — from the city limits. One prime place to
pedal is in Eldorado Canyon State Park (see the sidebar, “At the
end of your rope? Start climbing!”).
 Hiking: The hiking in Boulder starts right at the west edge of
town, where you can hike into city-owned open space in the
foothills of the Flatiron Range. You find great trail-running and
hiking in Chautauqua Park, just south of Baseline Road. Take
Baseline Road west from town and park near Chautauqua. From the
Ranger Cottage, climb the obvious fire road up the long grassy hill-
side. The road takes you to the trailhead for the Mesa Trail, which
undulates through ponderosa pine forest and meadows for 6 miles
along the base of the Flatirons. If you want to do a loop hike
Chapter 13: Boulder 155

through this area, go to the ranger station and pick up the free
Circle Hikes Guide (also available online), published by the City of
Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks (% 303-441-3440; www.
ci.boulder.co.us/openspace). It describes two loop hikes in
Chautauqua Park and four others a short drive away.
 Running: Boulder has a huge population of joggers and runners
who take advantage of the elevation, clean air, and hilly terrain to
get in top shape. You can run trails all around town, but if you want
to test yourself against some maniacally fast Boulderites, go to the
busy Boulder Creek Path, which parallels Boulder Creek through
downtown Boulder.
Hitting the slopes
Given its location about 20 miles west of Boulder, Eldora Mountain
Resort (% 303-440-8700; www.eldora.com) gets skied hard throughout
winter. Its 12 lifts can deposit plenty of skiers in a relatively small, 680-
acre area, nearly half of which has snowmaking capability in case
Mother Nature’s supply falls short. Skier traffic and manmade snow
often combine to create ice and moguls; as you descend the Eldora’s
1,400 vertical feet, you may encounter either of the two (and tortuous
combinations thereof), especially if it hasn’t snowed in a while. On the
upside, you won’t have to battle traffic on I-70 to get there, and the place
is low-key and has a few challenging spots. It’s great if you only have a
half-day to ski but are jonesing for a few runs.
Part III: The Front Range 
156
At the end of your rope? Start climbing!
Because of the deep, narrow canyons of smooth pink granite west of town, Boulder
is renowned as one of the planet’s best climbing towns. One hot spot is Elephant
Rocks, in Boulder Canyon. At Eldorado Canyon State Park (% 303-494-3943), 8 miles
southwest of town in Eldorado Springs, climbers creep up 800-foot canyon walls. There
are also great climbs on the Flatirons near Chautauqua Park. For gear, guidebooks,
maps, and information, the best place (maybe on Earth) is Neptune Mountaineering,
633 South Broadway (% 303-499-8866; www.neptunemountaineering.com).
If you’ve never tried climbing, I recommend it highly; it’s a thrill at any level, and look-
ing down at the cliff you just scaled gives quite a sense of accomplishment. But you
will want some training: Head over to The Spot Bouldering Gym, 3240 Prairie Ave.
(% 303-447-2804; www.thespotgym.com), for lessons.
Climbing enthusiasts should check out www.climbingboulder.com for the latest
news and climbing-related information.
If you’re visiting Boulder during winter, don’t discount the climbing possibilities — ever
scaled a waterfall? Dress warmly and do it here!

Shopping
Even unenthusiastic shoppers should browse the stores on Pearl Street.
You’ll be constantly entertained as you walk, and you’ll find products
ranging from Tibetan imports to kites. Starting from the top of Pearl
Street and working your way down, here are a few interesting stops:
 Belle Star, 385 Pearl St. #7 (% 303-249-6958), will analyze your
auric field photograph for $20. The digitally enhanced photograph
reveals blotches of color and light around your head. The color and
light may not mean much to you — to the ungifted, it just looks like
you’re at a disco. That’s where Belle Star comes in. She can read
these photographs to reveal things about you. For example, you
may find out that you’re a healer, mystic, or teacher. The entire
process takes just a few minutes.
 With 100,000 books on three floors, Boulder Book Store, 1107 Pearl
St. (% 800-244-4651 or 303-447-2074; www.boulderbookstore.
com), is the largest of the local independents. Open since 1973, it
resembles a downsized version of Denver’s popular Tattered Cover
Book Store. Chairs and tables are tucked into corners on the differ-
ent floors, making it easy to hunker down and browse.
 If it can fly, float, soar, or spin in the wind (without carrying
humans along with it), you can probably find it at Into the Wind,
1408 Pearl St. (% 800-541-0314; www.intothewind.com). The
store sells human-controlled floaters such as boomerangs, kites,
and flying discs, as well as yard decorations such as windmills,
mobiles, and twisters. The store even sells hats with propellers.
 Since 1971, the Boulder Arts and Crafts Cooperative, 1421 Pearl St.
(% 303-443-3683; www.boulderartsandcrafts.com), has repre-
sented local artists. Right now the co-op has 50 members, including
painters, sculptors, and jewelry-makers. Most of the artists charge
reasonable prices for their work, making this a great place to shop
for gifts.
 If you’re impressed by goatees and bongo drums, check out the
Beat Book Shop (% 303-444-7111). Its proprietor, Tom Peters, has
amassed a sizeable collection of used books by Beat writers and
poets, as well as other vintage paperbacks, LPs, CDs, and maga-
zines. This time capsule of the ’50s and ’60s occupies a tiny space
at 1713 Pearl St.
Nightlife
Even when the students are out of town, Boulder has a vigorous nightlife.
The hottest restaurants — Jax, Rhumba, and The Med, to name a few —
have bars that are popular with young professionals. In addition to these
trendy mingling spots, the town has basement dives, brewpubs, and
places specializing in live music. Boulder attracts some great pickers
who turn up solo for jam sessions as well as in formal gigs alongside
their own groups.
Chapter 13: Boulder 157

Hitting the clubs and bars
Generally speaking, bars and clubs usually heat up around 11 p.m. and
close around 2 a.m. Pick up the latest copy of Boulder Weekly to find out
who’s playing where. If nothing captures your fancy, poke your head into
some of these bars, cafes, and clubs:
 Popular national touring acts gravitate to the Boulder Theater,
2032 14th St. (% 303-786-7030; www.bouldertheater.com).
Offerings include everything from jam bands to comedies and com-
munity forums. Most shows at this 1906 Art Deco–style venue are
open to all ages.
 Big-name acts that don’t go to the Boulder Theater often turn up at
the Fox Theatre, 1135 13th St. (% 303-447-0095; www.foxtheatre.
com). With its location close to the University of Colorado, the Fox
Theatre attracts more students than the shows downtown, and the
place can get a little rowdy.
 If you’re hungry for blues, check out The Catacombs, 2115 13th St.
(% 303-443-0486), which consists of a maze of underground cham-
bers, including poolrooms, smoking rooms, lounging areas, and a
music room. Blues bands often play the music room. It’s hard to
pinpoint who hangs out here, because every room is different.
Cover charges vary.
 Tulagi, 1129 13th St. (% 303-443-3399), books some noisy, rowdy
acts plus the usual Colorado jam-band fare. It also has cheap drink
specials. Cover charges vary.
 For jazz and R&B, try Trios Wine and Martini Bar, 1155 Canyon
Blvd. (% 303-442-8400). The bar has live music Wednesday through
Sunday, usually for no cover.
 Penny Lane, at the corner of 18th and Pearl streets (% 303-443-
9516), isn’t a bar but it does have some quirky entertainment. A
coffee shop, Penny Lane has an open mike two nights a week, as
well as readings, drop-in jams, and folk singers. There’s something
every night, usually starting at around 8:00 or 8:30 p.m. No cover.
Looking for culture
The auditorium at the Chautauqua Institute is one of the neatest music
venues going. Erected in 1898, it’s like a huge, rickety barn, but with
comfortable seating and a large stage. Daylight peeks through cracks in
the walls; the air smells as fresh as if you were outside. During silences
in performances, you may hear the rain and wind. Because of the superb
acoustics and unusual setting, musicians love playing here. Every
summer, two major music festivals are based here.
Part III: The Front Range 
158

Several nights a week from late June to mid-August, the Colorado Music
Festival takes over the auditorium for classical music performances.
The festival has its own orchestra, which often plays alongside visiting
musicians. It also has a chamber series. Every performance is different,
and the offerings include everything from Bernstein to Dvorak. The least
expensive tickets always cost $10; prime seats go for $33 to $37. Tickets
for each upcoming season go on sale May 1. To find out more about the
Festival, visit the Colorado Music Festival Box Office, 900 Baseline Rd.
(% 303-440-7666; www.coloradomusicfest.org).
When it’s not hosting the Colorado Music Festival, Chautauqua has its
own summer festival, which brings dance troupes, folk singers, intellectu-
als, comedians, and other entertainers. Recent performers have included
John Hiatt, Joan Baez, the Cleo Parker Robinson Dance Ensemble, and the
essayist Andrei Codrescu. Prices for the Chautauqua Summer Festival
range in cost from free (for the season-ending show) to $35 or more for
the most popular acts. Surf the Internet to www.chautauqua.com for more
information.
Tickets for both the Colorado Music Festival and Chautauqua Summer
Festival are available through the Chautauqua Box Office (% 303-440-
7666), open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Saturday from
noon to 4 p.m., and 90 minutes before show time. It’s on the Chautauqua
grounds between the auditorium and the dining hall. TicketsWest carries
tickets to these shows at area King Soopers stores. You can order online
at www.ticketswest.com or call % 866-464-2626. Tickets to the
Chautauqua Summer Festival only are available at the Boulder Theater
Box Office, 2032 14th St. (% 303-786-7030).
Chautauqua also hosts lower-profile events, including forums, concerts,
classes, and film screenings. For information on these events, surf the
Internet to www.chautauqua.com or call % 303-442-3282, ext. 24.
The Colorado Shakespeare Festival takes place at the Mary Rippon
Outdoor Theater on the University of Colorado campus from late June
through mid-August every summer. This talented company does three
Shakespearean plays every year, including at least one tragedy. A few
students and graduate students take part, but most of the performers
are seasoned pros. Best of all, you can picnic (without glassware)
beforehand, and then take in the evening sky during the performance.
Tickets cost $10 to $46. No children under five are admitted. Order tick-
ets by phone (% 303-492-0554) or by visiting the box office in the base-
ment of the Dance and Theater Building on the University of Colorado
Campus, near the intersection of Broadway and Euclid. For more on the
festival, surf the Internet to www.coloradoshakes.org.

Colorado Springs
In This Chapter
 Staying at Colorado’s grandest resort
 Pikes Peak or bust for family fun
 Visiting a divine, red-rock garden
I
f you like orderly, clean-cut, traditional towns, you’ll enjoy Colorado
Springs. The Air Force Academy is nearby, along with several military
installations. The international Christian organization Focus on the Family
has its headquarters in town, and the first U.S. Olympic Training Center
still conditions athletes here. Even the town’s layout feels disciplined — a
neat grid centered around a wide boulevard known as Pikes Peak Avenue.
Within that grid, the downtown buildings barely obstruct the mountain
views. The town and county have 158 nicely maintained parks, including
the spectacular Garden of the Gods, where red sandstone slabs seem to
have erupted out of the earth at the base of the mountains.
Colorado Springs has been a resort since the 1870s (though many early
“guests” were people with tuberculosis, who came for the fresh air).
Flush with mining profits from nearby Cripple Creek, millionaires built
several grand hotels in and around Colorado Springs in the early 1900s.
Visitors flocked here not only for the weather and the mountain views,
but for attractions such as the Pikes Peak Cog Railway, the Garden of the
Gods, Cave of the Winds, and later, the Pikes Peak Highway. These same
attractions still lure throngs of visitors to the area. Colorado Springs
isn’t too expensive for most families, yet a certain formality remains:
This is one of a handful of places in the state where men need a jacket
and tie to dine in the finest restaurants.
Getting There
Eight commercial airlines together offer about 100 flights daily to
Colorado Springs Airport (CSA). The airport has only three runways
and a small terminal, so negotiating it is easy. You can get your bearings
quickly by stopping at the ground transportation booth (% 719-550-
1930) on the terminal’s lower level, open from 7 a.m. to midnight daily.
Avis, Dollar, Hertz, and National all have desks and return areas at the
airport. Other companies, including Advantage, Budget, Enterprise, and

Thrifty do business nearby in Colorado Springs. For information on con-
tacting individual airlines and car-rental agencies, see the appendix.
Downtown Colorado Springs is 12 miles from the airport. Coming from
the airport, go right (north) on Powers Boulevard, and then take a left
(west) onto Colorado 24 (Platte Avenue). Follow Platte Avenue into the
downtown area.
A few hotels offer free shuttle services for guests. If yours doesn’t, call
one of three taxi companies — Express Airport Taxi (% 719-634-3111),
Fremont County Cab (% 719-784-2222), or Yellow Cab (% 719-634-
5000) — for a ride into town. The cheapest company, Express Airport
Taxi, bills $2 plus $1.50 per mile. The trip downtown usually costs
around $18.
You can drive into Colorado Springs via Interstate 25, which crosses the
west side of town along its route between Denver (70 miles north) and
Pueblo (40 miles south). If you’re heading west on I-70 and shooting for
Colorado Springs, exit onto U.S. 24 in Limon, and then follow that high-
way southwest for 70 miles into the city. If you’re heading east on I-70,
take Colorado 9 south for 53 miles to U.S. 24, then follow U.S. 24 east for
66 miles into Colorado Springs.
Getting Around
Colorado Springs (see the nearby map of the same name) is a pedestrian-
friendly city. And its citywide bus service, Springs Transit (% 719-385-
5974; www.springsgov.com), is easy to navigate and inexpensive to
ride — $1.25 for adults and 60¢ for seniors and kids 6 to 11. Keep in mind,
though, that the system operates year-round Monday through Saturday
only and is closed Sundays and holidays. Even so, you need a car to
reach many of the most popular attractions, because they’re scattered
around town and in the mountains.
U.S. 24 borders the south edge of the downtown, and I-25 skirts the west
side. The major north-south arteries in the downtown are Nevada Avenue
and Cascade Avenue. The main east-west roads are Colorado Avenue and
Platte Avenue (U.S. 24). The intersection of east-west Pikes Peak Avenue
and Nevada Avenue marks the center of town. Street addresses prefaced
with North or South indicate their location relative to Pikes Peak Avenue;
ones prefaced with East or West describe their location relative to Nevada
Avenue.
If you follow Colorado Avenue northwest out of the downtown, you soon
pass through Old Colorado City, between 21st and 31st streets. The
oldest part of Colorado Springs, Old Colorado City was a supply stop
for gold miners heading west in the late 1850s. It became Colorado’s first
territorial capital in 1861 but degenerated into a saloon and red-light dis-
trict. The 1970s saw the area become run-down, though much of it has
Part III: The Front Range 
162

since been restored into a quaint redbrick shopping area. Farther west,
Colorado Avenue becomes Manitou Avenue and enters Manitou Springs,
where some of the first resort hotels were built. Manitou Springs has a
large historic district, including many Victorian homes. It’s closer to the
mountains, more compact, and more colorful than Colorado Springs.
The Pikes Peak Cog Railway, which takes tourists up the steep slope to
the top of Pikes Peak, has its depot at the edge of town. West of town,
Manitou Avenue joins U.S. 24, which continues west into the mountains.
Where to Stay
You can stay in historic digs in Colorado Springs in every price range.
Famous historic hotels such as the Broadmoor and The Cliff House are
pricey. Less expensive, but hardly spartan, are a dozen or so area bed-
and-breakfasts, including some in Victorian homes. Least expensive are
the many historic motor lodges and motels around Manitou Springs,
many of which date to the 1920s and 1930s, when tourists began travel-
ing here by car. Some of these lodges and motels are fine; others need
work. Ask to see a room before settling in. If you want a chain hotel, you
can find one along I-25 in Colorado Springs.
The Broadmoor
$$$$
Colorado Springs
The ultraluxurious Broadmoor is almost a city for the rich and famous. On
its 2,400 acres are 11 restaurants and lounges, 45 golf holes, 12 tennis
courts, a 300-seat movie theater, 16 massage rooms, and 700 guest rooms.
During high season, 1,700 employees cater to needs you didn’t even know
you had. That level of service has been maintained for over 80 years, so it’s
not really news. The best new thing here is the outdoor swimming pool.
Like a seashore, the bottom of the pool slopes gradually into a deep end
that seems to disappear into the hotel’s man-made body of water,
Cheyenne Lake. A barely visible wall separates pool from lake. The effect
is cool and perfect. Of course, there’s a price for all this luxury. Even if you
can’t or won’t pay it, you should still walk through the original 1918 hotel.
A recent renovation spruced up the fountains, chandeliers, frescos, marble
floors, ceiling murals, and ornate plasterwork, making the entire building
a work of art.

El Colorado Lodge
$–$$
Manitou Springs
Built in 1927, this motel consists of real adobe cabins scattered along four
acres next to Manitou Avenue in Manitou Springs. The thick adobe walls
help muffle the noise of nearby traffic. Not surprisingly, the cabins are dec-
orated in a Southwestern motif, with Native American rugs and art; some
even have working fireplaces. The larger accommodations — which sleep
up to six people — have refrigerators and microwaves. The El Colorado
claims to have been the first lodge in the area to have offered sheets.
Fortunately for us, other places caught up, but this one still remains a good
value.

The Hearthstone Inn
$$–$$$
Colorado Springs
This inn, which occupies an 1885 mansion and a neighboring 1900 tuber-
culosis sanitarium, feels more formal and reserved than other area B&Bs.
Some of its antiques are museum quality, and reproductions of impres-
sionist paintings hang on the walls. The rooms and suites lack the frilly
décor found at other B&Bs — you’ll find only comfortable antique furni-
ture and well-preserved woodwork, floors, and trim. If you can’t stand
being offline, you’ll be pleased to know that accommodations are wired
for high-speed DSL.

Old Colorado City
This inn doesn’t have a long history, but it has everything else you could
want from a bed-and-breakfast. The uniquely decorated rooms offer luxu-
ries such as steam showers, CD players, VCRs (and complimentary
videos), and private decks. The waterbed mattresses are so comfy, you’ll
wish you were bed-ridden. And tea, soda, and snacks are available around
the clock in the common areas. Thick walls and doors make the rooms feel

Where to Dine
This is one of two Colorado cities where you can dine in semiformal
attire without feeling goofy. Dust off that blazer, knot that tie if you know
how, and then head for The Cliff House or one of many restaurants at
the Broadmoor in search of that perfect meal. Of course, the experience
doesn’t have to be stodgy. Even the fancy hotels have places where you
can dine casually, and plenty of mid-priced restaurants are also in the
area. Here are my best dining choices.
The Cliff House Dining Room
$$–$$$$
Manitou Springs
NOUVEAU CONTINENTAL
The Cliff House Dining Room is my favorite Colorado Springs eatery and
darn near my favorite in the state. Never mind the Broadmoor and its huge
reputation. Never mind the price — until your credit-card bill arrives. Just
enjoy the Victorian surroundings and the French-influenced fare. Seek
advice from one of the six licensed sommeliers on staff, then choose one
of the 5,000 bottles of wine. The salmon here is so fresh, it can be eaten
nearly raw; like most of the other entrees it’s cooked — but not over-
cooked — and topped with a buttery sauce. And don’t pass up the cheese
appetizer plate. For dessert, wash down the soufflé with a sip of port.
Above all, enjoy. Suit coats are suggested, but if you don’t feel like dress-
ing up, you can dine casually in the cocktail area on the porch.
See map p. 164. 306 Canon Ave. % 888-212-7000 or 719-685-3000. Reservations rec-
ommended. Main courses: $19–$36. AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Daily 6:30–10:30 a.m.,
11:30 a.m.–2:30 p.m., and 5:30–9 p.m.
Craftwood Inn
$$–$$$$
Manitou Springs
GAME
Located in a 1912 Arts and Crafts–style mansion on a hillside above
Manitou Springs, the Craftwood Inn is the best place to go if you’re hungry
for game. The choice of meats reads like a who’s who of the local wildlife.
Menu items include elk, trout, roast duck, noisettes of caribou, and grilled
loin of wild boar. There’s an extensive wine list, and the window and deck
seating afford views of Pikes Peak.

Dutch Kitchen
$
Manitou Springs
AMERICAN
The same family has run this tiny hole-in-the-wall on Manitou Avenue for
over 40 years. They make most of their food from scratch, ring up orders
on a 1930s cash register, and close on Fridays, which makes sense only to
them. You can have one of their famous corned beef sandwiches, a burger,
or a straightforward dinner entree such as golden fried shrimp or Italian
spaghetti. You can dine here for under $10 even if you sample the award-
winning pie.
See map p. 164. 1025 Manitou Ave. % 719-685-9962. Reservations for large parties
only. Main courses: $6–$12. No credit cards. Open: Sat–Thurs 11:30 a.m.–3:30 p.m.
and 4:30–8 p.m. Closed Thurs in spring and fall. Closed Dec–Feb.

Old Colorado City
GREEK
Two Greek brothers serve the old-world recipes of their grandmother at
this quirky restaurant in Old Colorado City. If you’d like to try a collection
of her traditional Greek dishes, order the sampler plate. It has dolmadaki
(grape leaves with meat stuffing), spanakopita, and other delicacies whose
names are too long for a guidebook this size. If the food doesn’t transport
you back to the Old World, maybe the murals of Greece and mounted
ocean fish will.

Saigon Cafe

Colorado Springs
VIETNAMESE
Most of Saigon Cafe’s dishes have plenty of fresh vegetables and only a
modest amount of meat, served over rice or rice noodles. The best may be
the noodle specialties — the meat of your choice served with rice noo-
dles, bean sprouts, cucumber, mint, lettuce, peanuts, and sauce. The
restaurant uses linen tablecloths, but if you insist on eating carryout,
Saigon Cafe can rustle up a box for your food.

The Wines of Colorado

Cascade
AMERICAN
This restaurant is the only place in the state where you can sample and
purchase wines from all of Colorado’s 35 wineries. If this sounds like a
painful task, taste the wines! You can sample a half-dozen or so for free,
then purchase any of 200 bottled varieties or simply order a glass with
dinner. As for the food, you can get salads, sandwiches, wine-marinated

hamburgers, and entrees such as grilled ahi and chicken pot pie. The deck
overlooking the confluence of two creeks is a pretty place to dine. If you
do sit down to dine, don’t expect your server to hand over a wine list —
you’re supposed to have chosen during the tasting process. (Duh.)

Summer daily 10:30 a.m.–8 p.m.; closed Mon the rest of the year.
Exploring Colorado Springs
Some of the tourist attractions in Colorado Springs have been operating
for so long, they’ve become historical sites, too. If they weren’t worth
seeing, most of them wouldn’t have lasted so long.
The best things to see and do
Cave of the Winds
Many years ago, on a hillside above present-day Manitou Springs, slightly
acidic rainwater flowed through cracks in limestone and gradually dissolved
some of the rock, eventually forming a mazelike network of caves — and, as
fate would have it, a major tourist attraction. At Cave of the Winds, you can
choose between two tours. The mellow, 45-minute Discovery Tour (cost: $16
adults; $8 children ages 6 to 15) is the tour for duffers. It follows paved
routes down lighted corridors where tour groups have been going for over
100 years. This tour may not, um, rock your world, but it’s still lots of fun,
especially if you get a guide who can make light of a script that mixes the
right amounts of science, hokum, and humor. On the more demanding
Lantern Tour (cost: $20 adults, $12 children ages 6 to 15, children under 6
not allowed), you carry your own lantern into an otherwise dark cave, walk
uneven dirt floors, and follow a guide into chambers smaller and more pris-
tine than the ones on the Discovery Tour. For the Lantern Tour, call ahead
for reservations. The cave’s natural temperature is always 54 degrees, so
remember to dress warmly.
See map p. 164. Six miles west of I-25 on U.S. 24, Manitou Springs. % 719-685-5444.
www.caveofthewinds.com. Open: May–Aug, daily 9 a.m.–9 p.m.; Sept–Apr, daily
10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Cheyenne Mountain Zoo
The people who named Cheyenne Mountain Zoo weren’t kidding about the
“mountain” part. It sits on a mountainside at 6,800 feet, with steep forest
floors above it. The zoo animals suited to this environment wander large,
forested plots of land on the hillside. They often seem more comfortable
than the zoo-goers, many of whom can’t handle the steep climbs. If the
climbing wears you out, you can ride on the zoo shuttle (cost: $1 for a full
day) alongside other weary Homo sapiens. The zoo has 146 species from
around the world, including rarely seen Southwestern animals such as
Chapter 14: Colorado Springs 169

gray wolves and mountain lions. If you bring your kids, be sure to visit the
1920s-era carousel, which costs $2 a ride.
See map p. 164. 4250 Cheyenne Mountain Zoo Rd. (above the Broadmoor). % 719-
633-9925. www.cmzoo.org. Admission: $12 adults 12–64, $10 seniors 65 and over, $6
children 3–11. Open: Summer, daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m. (8 p.m. on Tues); rest of year, daily
9 a.m.–5 p.m.
Garden of the Gods
When colliding tectonic plates uplifted the most recent incarnation of the
Rocky Mountains, a few massive sandstone slabs were pushed out of the
earth at the base of the mountains. In 1,300-acre Garden of the Gods Park,
erosion has carved this sandstone into fantastic shapes; it’s interesting to
note that this is the same geological formation that created the Flatirons
in Boulder and the giant natural amphitheatre at Red Rocks outside of
Denver. Admission is free, but with 1.7 million visitors annually, it can be
hard to find a parking space, let alone a quiet place. If the park is busy,
look for a spot at the Garden of the Gods Visitor Center. Many spectacular
rocks line the 11⁄2-mile Perkins Central Garden Trail, which is accessible
from this area. If you’re curious about the rocks, watch the 12-minute,
laser-enhanced video (cost: $2 for adults, $1 for kids 12 and under) at the
visitor center, which explains how they were formed.
See map p. 164. Ridge Road (off I-25 Exit 146). % 719-634-6666. www.gardenof
gods.com. Admission: Free. Open: Memorial Day to Labor Day daily 8 a.m.–8 p.m.;
rest of year daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
Pikes Peak Cog Railway
Unlike many other historic railroads in Colorado, this 1891 railway has
always catered to tourists, and today it carries more than a quarter-
million people annually from Manitou Springs (elevation: 6,571 feet) to the
summit of Pikes Peak (elevation: 14,110 feet). It’s a straight, steep, 9-mile
climb, with grades of 25 degrees in places. Ordinary trains can’t get enough
friction to climb this steeply; that’s why this one has a cog that grabs onto
a toothy center track. The train passes waterfalls, wildlife, and lakes before
finally opening onto views that span all the way to Kansas. It takes 1 hour
and 15 minutes to reach the windswept summit, where you linger for 40
minutes in or near the gift shop before making the 40-minute trip back
down. Sometimes, discount coupons are offered on the Web site, so if this
is definitely on your itinerary, check online to find out what discounts may
be available the month you plan to be in the area.
See map p. 164. 515 Ruxton Ave., Manitou Springs. % 719-685-5401. www.cog
railway.com. Tickets: $29 adults; $17 children under 12. Open: Late April–Dec 29.
Train departs every 80 minutes during midsummer, less often during slower periods.
Reservations requested.
Part III: The Front Range 
170

Pikes Peak Highway
The road up Mount Evans, nearer to Denver, goes higher, costs less, and
is just as pretty. But this is the more famous road, the one where race cars
race every summer. If you plan on driving the 20 miles to the top, remem-
ber that a 14,000-foot peak is a serious undertaking, even in an automo-
bile. Make sure you have at least half a tank of gas, because your round-trip
will take 2 hours or more, as well as grippy brakes for the trip down. As for
the road, it’s wide enough for two city buses to pass each other, but it lacks
guardrails and becomes gravel after 7 miles, which makes it plenty scary
for flatlanders. And the weather on top is changeable, to say the least. One
advantage to the road (over the train, see the preceding listing) is that it
lets you set your own pace and pause at overlooks. In winter, the road
stays open but is usually only plowed to around the 13-mile mark.
See map p. 164. Turn off U.S. 24 at Cascade (10 miles west of Manitou Springs).
% 800-318-9505 or 719-385-PEAK. www.pikespeakcolorado.com. Admission: $10
per adult (16 and over), $5 per child (6–15), or $35 per carload. Open: May 19–Sept 5,
daily 7 a.m.–7 p.m.; Sept 6–30, daily 7 a.m.–5 p.m.; rest of year, daily 9 a.m.–3 p.m.
United States Air Force Academy
The U.S. Air Force Academy is huge. It encompasses 18,000 acres along the
foothills of the Rockies, and the drive from the north to the south gates of
the academy covers 14 miles. To get your bearings after arriving, follow the
signs to the visitor center, which has Air Force videos, displays, gifts, and an
information desk. It also has maps for a self-guided driving tour. From there,
you can walk a 1⁄3-mile paved trail to the popular Cadet Chapel. Afterwards,
allow at least two hours for the driving tour. During daytime, you can break
up the drive by enjoying some of the open space. It’s not exactly Woodstock
in there, but you can still mountain-bike or hike on the Santa Fe Trail, road
bike, play golf, or picnic. Just make sure you have a photo ID.
Chapter 14: Colorado Springs 171
A stunt becomes a tradition
The second oldest auto race in America, the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb
(% 719-685-4400; www.ppihc.com) started as a publicity stunt. In 1916, Spencer
Penrose, owner of the Broadmoor Hotel, organized the race as a way of letting the
world know about a new toll road he’d just bankrolled. Today, racers in motorcycles
and sports cars still careen up the last 12.4 miles (the gravel portion) of the Pikes Peak
Highway every year. The road probably would have been paved long ago if local offi-
cials hadn’t feared ruining the race.
You can find out more about the history of the race and see old cars and motorcycles
from past races at the Pikes Peak Auto Hill Climb Educational Museum, 135 Manitou
Ave., Manitou Springs. The museum is open daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. during summer
(call for off-season hours). Admission is $5 adults, $4 seniors, and $2 for children ages
6 to 12.

See map p. 164. 12 miles north of Colorado Springs, off I-25 Exit 156B (follow signs to
the visitor center). % 719-333-8723. www.usafa.af.mil. Admission: Free. Visitor
Center hours: Summer daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m.; winter daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
United States Olympic Complex
Unfortunately for the likes of you and me, this 36-acre complex is set up to
train world-class athletes and not to entertain bored, frumpy tourists. Still,
if you love the Olympics, you’ll probably enjoy the one-hour tour. After
watching a short, unsubtle video highlighting American Olympic achieve-
ments, you walk through facilities where athletes train for sports such as
volleyball, judo, shooting, swimming, and boxing. If you go during mid-
morning or late afternoon, you’ll probably see at least a few athletes endur-
ing the repetitive, boring, torturous work that you always hear about, after
the fact, during the Olympics. If you don’t take the tour, you’re still allowed
to wander the grounds, visit the gift shop, and stop at the U.S. Olympic
Hall of Fame (which has changing displays). You may not, however, enter
the buildings, so you’re better off taking advantage of the tour.
See map p. 164. 1 Olympic Plaza, corner of Boulder Street (entrance) and Union
Boulevard. % 719-866-4618 (visitor center) or 719-866-4656 (reservations).
Admission: Free. Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m. Last tour leaves at 4 p.m.
Other things to see and do
In addition to the big draws, Colorado Springs may have more small,
quirky attractions than any other Colorado town. While in Colorado
Springs, you can
 Get thrown. The Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame and Museum of the
American Cowboy, 101 Pro Rodeo Dr. (% 719-528-4764), overflows
with trophies, hats, boots, spurs, and chaps belonging to famous
rodeo cowboys. So many cowboys have been inducted into the hall,
you can’t help but wonder who’s left. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to
5 p.m. (except holidays). Admission costs $6 adults; $5 seniors 55
and over; $3 children 6 to 12; and is free for kids under 6.
 Russell up some art. The Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, 30 W.
Dale St. (% 719-634-5581; www.csfineartscenter.org), has a
large collection of fine regional art, including pieces by Charles
Russell, Georgia O’Keefe, and Albert Bierstadt. My favorite gallery
showcases pre- and post-Colombian Native American and Hispanic
work. There’s also a tactile gallery. It’s open Tuesday through
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from 1 to 5 p.m. Admission
is $5 for adults, $3 for seniors, and $2 for kids 6 to 16.
 Study sequins. The World Figure Skating Museum and Hall of
Fame, 20 First St. (% 719-635-5200; www.worldskatingmuseum.
org), isn’t so much about skating as about the trappings of the
sport — the sequined outfits, polished skates, buttons, trophies,
and medals. Seeing these showy historical items up close may
pique your curiosity about the people behind the glitter. The
Part III: The Front Range 
172

museum is open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Admission costs $3 adults, $2 for children ages 6 through 17 and
seniors over 60.
 Get sprung. At the Manitou Springs Chamber of Commerce, 354
Manitou Ave. (% 800-642-2567 or 719-685-5089), you can pick up
a map identifying ten mineral water springs in the downtown area.
In the late 19th century, the town promoted the mineral water as a
cure-all. It’s a fun way to tour the downtown. Bring a cup so that
you can fill up and drink if you get thirsty.
Guided tours
Pikes Peak Tours/Gray Line, 3704 W. Colorado (% 800-345-8197 or 719-
633-1181; www.coloradograyline.com), will pick you up at your hotel
and take you on a bus tour of Pikes Peak. The four-hour round-trip tour
costs $35 for adults over 12, $20 for children 11 and under.
Staying active
With so many full-blown tourist attractions in and around Colorado
Springs, you may not spend as much time on the trails as you would in
other parts of the state. If you do want to exercise in the backcountry,
consider the following activities:
 Biking and hiking: Trails lace the foothills above Colorado Springs.
One especially popular and scenic area is North Cheyenne Canyon.
Starting high up in the canyon, an 8-mile stretch of the Gold Camp
Road is closed to motor vehicles. Once a railroad grade, the wide,
gradual trail is ideal for family rides and walks. If you want a more
challenging ride, you can branch off the Gold Camp Road onto a
single-track trail. To reach the trailhead, take Cheyenne Boulevard
past Seven Falls and Helen Hunt Falls. The trailhead is at the High
Drive parking lot, where the road turns from pavement to dirt.
Criterium Bicycles, 6150 Corporate Dr. (% 719-599-0149), rents
full-suspension mountain bikes for $35 per half-day, $50 per whole-
day. Challenge Unlimited, 204 S. 24th St. (% 800-798-5954 or
719-633-6399), will set you up with bikes and help you coast down
all 20 miles of the Pikes Peak Highway. Cost for that excursion is
$93 per person in the morning, $80 in the afternoon (when storms
are more likely).
 Golfing: The preferred public course in Colorado Springs is the 27-
hole Patty Jewett Golf Course, 900 E. Espanola St. (% 719-385-
6950). Nonresident greens fees are $27 for 18 holes, $13.50 for 9
holes. If you’re a serious duffer, though, and want one of the world’s
best golf vacations, the Broadmoor Hotel (see “Where to Stay” ear-
lier in this chapter) has three championship-grade courses and sev-
eral options for golf-and-accommodation packages.
 Rafting: See “Heading Out to Cañon City and Royal Gorge,” later in
this chapter.
Chapter 14: Colorado Springs 173

Shopping
The Bookman, 3163 W. Colorado Ave. (% 719-636-0055), specializes in
vintage paperbacks (think ’50s-era pulp) and old reference books, and it
even has some old manual typewriters. Antiques lovers and book geeks
will love it.
At Nevada Village Antiques, 405 S. Nevada Ave. (% 719-473-3351),
eight dealers share a 7,000-square-foot mall. Upwards of 50,000 articles
are for sale.
Kitsch-lovers and serious collectors alike will love the dolls and figurines
at Simpich Character Dolls, 2413 W. Colorado Ave. (% 719-636-3272;
www.simpich.com). Elves, angels, and fairies make up the bulk of the
collection, but the studio also specializes in historical and Christmas
characters.
Van Briggle Art Pottery, at the corner of 21st Street and U.S. 24 (% 719-
633-7729; www.vanbriggle.com), has been a working gallery since 1899.
The artisans here make a style of pottery that was first created by Artus
Van Briggle, who’s famous in pottery circles. Some pieces are cast, others
are hand-thrown. The studio sells bowls, vases, and lamps, at prices rang-
ing from $20 to $1,500. Free tours are available. It’s open Monday through
Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
Especially for kids
Arcade Amusements, Inc., 930 Manitou Ave. (% 719-685-9815), in
Manitou Springs, has old-fashioned, analog amusement games such as
pinball and Skee-Ball for grown ups. It also has kiddie rides for, um, kid-
dies. And its state-of-the-art video games are sure to please teenagers.
Some of the attractions are in the open air, so you won’t feel claustro-
phobic. It’s open daily from 10 a.m. to midnight during summer; 11 a.m.
to 7 p.m. (and sometimes later) in other months.
Nightlife
Colorado Springs isn’t known for its nightlife, but in recent years the
night scene has expanded along with the city.
Hitting the bars and clubs
Most of the hottest nightspots are within walking distance of one another
in the heart of Colorado Springs, but there are also a few fun roadhouses
and pubs outside of downtown. Your options include the following:
 Arguably the most popular gathering place in Colorado Springs,
Phantom Canyon Brewing Company, 2 E. Pikes Peak Ave. (% 719-
635-2800), has billiards, handcrafted beers, and a menu that’s
heavy on comfort food. It’s owned by the folks who built the
Wynkoop Brewery in Denver, so you know the beer is topnotch.

Heading Out to Cañon City and Royal Gorge
A quick 43-mile drive from Colorado Springs puts you in Cañon City and
near the mouth of Royal Gorge, a 1,200-foot-deep canyon cut by the
Arkansas River. Royal Gorge is the area’s big tourist attraction, but the
highest concentration of visitors is usually found at the nearby Colorado
State Penitentiary, which is not even so much as a runner-up hotel in
this book.
Getting there
To reach Cañon City from Colorado Springs, take Colorado 115 south for
33 miles, and then follow U.S. 50 west for 10 miles to Cañon City. Cañon
City is 39 miles west of I-15 at Pueblo.
Exploring Royal Gorge
Royal Gorge formed when the Arkansas River cut downward through
very hard Precambrian rock. It’s one of the deepest and most scenic
canyons in the state. You’d do well to bypass most of the tourist traps
near the gorge, but three attractions are worth checking out:
 To see the gorge from the top, go to Royal Gorge Bridge and Park
(% 888-333-5597 or 719-275-7507; www.royalgorgebridge.com),
where you can walk (or catch a ride) across the gorge on the
world’s highest suspension bridge. Built in 1929, the bridge is
880 feet long and more than 1,100 feet above the Arkansas River.
Standing on it and staring straight down at the river, feeling the
whole structure sway in the wind, is exciting. The admission price
also covers rides across the gorge on an aerial tramway, trips up
and down a canyon wall on the “world’s steepest incline railway,” a
rim-side mini-railroad, a petting zoo, and live entertainment. A well-
marked turnoff for the park departs from U.S. 50 8 miles west of
Cañon City. It’s another 4 miles to the park. The park is open daily
from 8:30 or 9:00 a.m. to dusk. Admission costs $15 adults, $13.50
seniors 60 and up, and $12 children ages 4 to 11.

 To see the gorge from the bottom, take the Royal Gorge Route
(% 303-569-2403; www.royalgorgeroute.com) out of Cañon City.
Don’t be fooled into riding either of the two miniature trains on the
rim of the gorge. If you want to take the real train along the bottom of
Royal Gorge, you have to drive into Cañon City and follow the signs
to the Santa Fe Depot (on Third Street south of U.S. 50). You’ll be
rewarded with close-up views of the Arkansas River and the steep
canyon walls. The ride goes out and back from Cañon City, lasts two
hours, and covers 24 miles round-trip. From May 28 to October 9,
the train departs at 9:30 a.m., 12:30 p.m., and 3:30 p.m. daily. The
rest of the year, it leaves at 12:30 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday only.
Admission is $28.95 adults, $18.50 children ages 3 to 12.
 The third and most exciting way to experience the gorge is on a raft
floating down the Arkansas River. Because the gorge has some angry
(Class 4) whitewater, this trip isn’t for everyone, and kids under 15
aren’t even allowed. But if you’re strong enough to paddle in real
rapids and prepared for an adventure, contact Arkansas River Tours
(ART) (% 800-321-4352; www.arkansasrivertours.com). From
mid-May through mid-September, ART offers half-day Royal Gorge
paddle trips for $54 and full-day trips for $89. If you’ve never helped
paddle a boat in whitewater before, you’ll need to take the full-day
trip so that you have time to practice before entering the gorge. ART
also offers a handful of oar trips. On oar trips, a guide rows the boat
solo, using oars mounted in a metal frame (as opposed to the pas-
sengers and guide paddling together).
Finding places to stay and dine
In 1885, two years after the St. Cloud Hotel, 631 Main St. (% 800-405-9666
or 719-276-2000; www.stcloudhotel.com), was completed, the owners
dismantled it brick by brick and moved it from Silvercliff to Cañon City.
Since then, it’s been the state headquarters for the Colorado Ku Klux Klan,
a bus stop, a long-abandoned eyesore, and an asset seized by the state for
back taxes. The new ownership has worked hard to restore it to its short-
lived glory. Some rooms look Victorian; others look like sets from The Big
Sleep. On the upside, it’s as solid as a pyramid, it has a convenient down-
town location, and the prices — $85 to $95 double — are reasonable.
However, the hotel is closed for renovation until the fall of 2005, so those
prices may be, well, adjusted.
If you want a place without a history, consider the Comfort Inn Cañon
City, 311 Royal Gorge Blvd. (% 800-228-5150 or 719-276-6900;
www.choicehotels.com). Rates (which include breakfast) run from $65
to $170, depending on the type of room you get and the season.
A neon sign outside Merlino’s Belvedere, 1330 Elm Ave. in Cañon City
(% 800-625-2526), nearly always alerts this restaurant’s incoming cus-
tomers that there is immediate seating available — no surprise, since
Chapter 14: Colorado Springs 177

the place maxes out at around 500. Inside, most of the dining rooms feel
Denny’s-casual, with pastel colors and booths along the walls. This third-
generation family-run business appears about as intimate as the Coors
family business, but the food tastes homemade. The kitchen staff cooks
spaghetti sauce three times a week in batches of over 60 gallons, bakes
bread, and whips up gelato with fresh seasonal fruit. If you don’t feel like
pasta, you can choose steak, seafood, chicken, or a burger. A dinner
entree sets you back anywhere from $9 to $26. Open for lunch and
dinner daily.

The High Country

In this part . . . 
B
y the time you reach this region, you may have visited
the bigger cities of the Front Range, and you may have
acclimated yourself to Colorado’s thin air. So it’s time to go
higher, up into the mountainous country the state is most
famous for. In this part, I introduce you to the alpine beauty
of Rocky Mountain National Park, the high valleys of the park-
lands just beyond the Front Range, and to some of the best
ski towns that the United States, never mind Colorado, has
to offer. Take a deep breath, throw on an extra layer, drink a
glass of water, and keep reading.

S
o, maybe by now you’ve checked out the urban scene along the
Front Range; chances are, though, what you’re really looking for in
Colorado is a bit higher up. The true glory of this state is found up in the
Rocky Mountains — what we natives tend to call the High Country. This
enormous part of the state is divided into several major mountain ranges,
all of them with their own rugged charms. Most are made of enormous
chunks of granite that pushed up through the crust of the earth millions
of years ago, though some (like the San Juans in the southwest and the
Rampart Range west of Colorado Springs) are actually extinct volcanoes!
All of them have been slowly eroded by the rivers that flow between them
and the glaciers of the last ice age that carved out the huge U-shaped val-
leys above 8,000 feet. And this unique combination of geology, history,
and climate makes these mountain ranges among the best outdoor play-
grounds in the world, winter or summer. See the nearby map, “The High
Country,” for a layout of the whole region.
The High Country has a lot going for it. But the 416 square miles of
Rocky Mountain National Park merit special attention, and deserve to
be your gateway to the rest: the spectacular scenery, excellent resorts,
prime camping, and wide range of outdoor activities make the park a
perfect microcosm of the High Country as a whole. The main road
through the park — Trail Ridge Road — crosses the continental divide at
over 12,000 feet. It’s the highest continually paved highway in America
and probably the easiest way to experience high-alpine tundra, vibrant
with life and color for a few short months every summer. With 147 moun-
tain lakes, the park holds more water naturally than most other regions
of the state. Countless waterfalls and creeks drain high alpine snowfields
and glaciers and feed these languid pools. The peaks themselves aren’t
the highest in Colorado — Longs Peak, at 14,255 feet, is the park’s only

Chapter 15: Rocky Mountain National Park 183

fourteener (local term for a mountain that rises above 14,000 feet) — but
they’re among the most spectacular, with massive walls of granite loom-
ing over immense valleys, all sculpted by ancient glaciers. In all, the park
has 114 peaks over 10,000 feet. And you can be at the eastern entrances
only two hours after arriving in Denver.
Choosing a Season to Visit
The park’s combination of stunning scenery and easy access has con-
tributed to overcrowding and parking shortages during peak periods.
Rocky Mountain’s visitation in 2004 was 2.9 million, slightly more than
Yellowstone National Park — in an area one-eighth the size.
Don’t drive through the park on a July or August weekend and expect
to get back to nature. To enjoy these mountains in solitude, you need to
come in the off-season or else don a backpack and take a long walk.
Unfortunately, the busiest times are also the most opportune periods for
covering ground here. If you want to cross the park by car, you need to
visit between Memorial Day and mid-October, when Trail Ridge Road is
open. The prime months for hiking are July and August, when the snow
melts off the highest elevations and uncovers wildflowers in bloom.
Summer doesn’t last long at 11,000 feet. In May and June, you may still
have to hike snowy trails. In late September and October, the trails
should be mostly dry, but an early-season snowstorm may dampen your
experience. In winter, most park roads stay open, some of the trails are
marked for skiing and snowshoeing, and the area suddenly becomes
very quiet.
Getting There
Denver International Airport (DIA), 80 miles to the southwest, is the
closest major airport to Rocky Mountain National Park. DIA is served
by most major domestic carriers and rental-car companies. For details
about navigating DIA, check out Chapter 11. For information on contact-
ing individual airlines and car-rental agencies, see the appendix. After
you arrive in the state, your options for getting to the park definitely
involve wheels.
Driving to the park
From the city of Denver, it’s only 71 miles to Estes Park. Take U.S. 36
through Boulder and then continue on to Estes Park. In Estes Park, U.S.
36 meets U.S. 34, which goes west through the park to Grand Lake and
Granby. Coming from the west, make your way to I-40, which passes
through Granby en route from I-80 (near Park City, Utah) to I-70 (at
Empire, Colorado). In Granby, head north and east on U.S. 34.
Part IV: The High Country 
184

Chapter 15: Rocky Mountain National Park 185
From Denver and other points south, the most scenic route is the Peak-to-
Peak Scenic Byway, from Central City via Nederland, and along the south-
east edge of the park. The byway starts at Colorado 119 north from I-70,
picks up Colorado 72 just south of Nederland, and joins Colorado 7 north
to Estes Park, where the byway meets up with U.S. 36. Heading west on
U.S. 36 leads to the two eastern entrances of the park (see “Learning the
Lay of the Land,” later in this chapter).
Busing in to the park
From May 16 through October 1, the Estes Park Shuttle and Mountain
Tours (% 970-586-5151) makes four round-trips daily to Denver
International Airport. The shuttle picks up and drops off passengers
at most Estes Park locations. One-way fare is $39 per person; a round-
trip costs $75. Charter service is also available.
Planning Ahead for Your Park Visit
Call or write Rocky Mountain National Park, Estes Park, CO 80517-8397
(% 970-586-1206) for information. You can also get information off the
Web at www.nps.gov/romo.
Backcountry permits are required year-round for overnight stays in the
park’s backcountry. There’s a $15 charge for backcountry permits issued
for hikes May through October; the rest of the year, they’re free.
Permits for spring, summer, and fall go on sale March 1. If you’re set on a
particular hike, buy your permit well in advance. On summer weekends
in July and August, the most popular areas fill up. Backcountry offices
are located at the Kawuneeche Visitor Center, outside the park’s Grand
Lake entrance; and on U.S. 36 near the Beaver Meadows Visitor Center.
For more information, call % 970-586-1242 or write to Backcountry
Office, Rocky Mountain National Park, Estes Park, CO 80517.
Three of the park’s five campgrounds are always first-come, first-served.
Reservations are accepted for the other two for dates during peak season
(late May through mid-September). To make a reservation for the Moraine
Park or Glacier Basin campgrounds, call % 800-365-2267 or surf the
Internet to http://reservations.nps.gov.

Learning the Lay of the Land
The continental divide goes right through the heart of Rocky Mountain
National Park (see the nearby map). The main route through the park
and across the divide is Trail Ridge Road, which meanders 49 miles
from a spot near Estes Park on the east side of the park to Grand Lake
on the west. On the way, it snakes for 12 miles across alpine tundra,
cresting at 12,183 feet near Fall River Pass. Completed in 1932, Trail
Ridge Road is the highest continually paved highway in America, and
has some of the most breathtaking views you ever see through the
window of a car.
Trail Ridge Road isn’t the only way to climb from the area close to Estes
Park to the loftier reaches of the park. Beginning in mid-summer (and
sometimes earlier), you can also take Fall River Road. The first 2 miles
of the road are paved and two-way, but near the Endovalley Picnic Area
it becomes a one-way dirt road ascending 9 miles to Fall River Pass. This
was the first major road in the park when it was completed in 1920, and
it doesn’t seem to have changed much since then. It’s narrow, is exposed
to steep drop-offs, and has switchbacks that are too sharp for vehicles
longer than 25 feet. It ends at Trail Ridge Road, next to the Alpine Visitor
Center. Together with Trail Ridge Road, it makes for a fun loop drive
when it’s open, but if you’ve never been to the park before, take Trail
Ridge out of Estes Park first; the driving is easier, and the views are so
much better.
Rocky Mountain National Park has three main entrances. From the west,
U.S. 34 enters the park near Grand Lake and becomes Trail Ridge Road. On
the east, U.S. 34 and U.S. 36 enter the park a few miles apart near Estes
Park and then meet at Deer Ridge Junction. You can use either U.S. 34 or
U.S. 36 to reach Trail Ridge Road. However, U.S. 34 also provides access to
Fall River Road, and U.S. 36 takes you closer to the hiking trails in Moraine
Park and Glacier Basin.
Other park roads are spurs leading to trailheads in alpine basins. On the
east side of the park, Bear Lake Road branches south off of U.S. 36 and
provides access to two large campgrounds and some of the park’s most
popular hiking trails. Because the parking areas near popular trailheads
often fill up, the park operates two shuttle-bus routes in this area. You
can catch either shuttle at the Visitor Transportation System parking
area across from the Glacier Basin Campground. (For more on the shut-
tles, see “Getting around,” later in this chapter.)
In the southeast corner of the park, a road goes 2 miles east from
Colorado 7 to the Wild Basin Trailhead. Just north of there, a spur
road off of Colorado 7 goes east to a campground, ranger station, and
the parking area for the Longs Peak Trailhead. The highest mountain
in the park, 14,255-foot Longs Peak, is located nearby.

Arriving in the Park
You find a visitor center at each primary park entrance, as well as one
right in the middle of the park. All have information desks, interpretive
displays, and park literature.
 The Beaver Meadows Visitor Center (% 970-586-1206) is on U.S.
36 just outside the Beaver Meadows entrance. It’s open daily from
8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
 The Fall River Visitor Center, just outside the Fall River entrance
on U.S. 34, opened in 2000. Open Saturdays, Sundays, and most hol-
idays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., it has displays on wildlife.
 The Alpine Visitor Center sits where Fall River Road and Trail Ridge
Road converge. Located on the tundra, this visitor center has dis-
plays on high-alpine plant and animal life. It’s open from 10:30 a.m.
to 4:30 p.m. daily, Memorial Day through mid-October.
 The Kawuneeche Visitor Center (% 970-586-1206), on U.S. 34
just outside the Grand Lake Entrance, is open daily from 8 a.m. to
4:30 p.m. It has a backcountry office and an auditorium that shows
a 20-minute video on the park.
Paying fees
Park admission, good for seven days, costs $20 per week per vehicle,
$10 for individuals on foot, bicycle, or motorcycle. A $50 National Parks
Pass covers admission to all National Parks for one year from the date of
purchase. An Annual Pass to Rocky Mountain National Park costs $35.
For $10, people over 62 can buy a Golden Age Pass, which entitles the
holder to free admission for life at all federal fee areas.
Getting around
Driving through Rocky Mountain National Park isn’t difficult; the hard
part, during high season at least, is finding parking near your favorite
trailhead. During mid-summer, the park often has more cars than it can
accommodate. The busiest time is in July and August between 10 a.m.
and 3 p.m. One of the busiest areas is 10-mile Bear Lake Road, where
many popular hiking trails are located.
The Moraine Park route makes seven stops between the parking area
and the Fern Lake Trailhead. Buses on that route run every 20 minutes
between 7:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. The Bear Lake Route makes three stops
between the parking area and Bear Lake. Buses on the Bear Lake Route
run every 30 minutes between 5 a.m. and 10 p.m. The shuttle service
operates daily from May through October. During absolute peak periods,
there may be times when even the Visitor Transportation System park-
ing area fills up. When this happens, try the Moraine Park Museum lot. If
that’s full too, it may be time to find an activity outside the park. The
Part IV: The High Country 
188

road to Bear Lake recently underwent extensive reconstruction, and is
open again year-round.
Considering safety
Although Rocky Mountain National Park isn’t an especially dangerous
place, it does sport a few hazards that could sour your visit. Take the
proper precautions and you should be fine. Check out the following haz-
ards and tips for dealing with or preventing them:
 Animal encounters: Most bear encounters happen because people
aren’t careful with food. When car-camping inside Rocky Mountain
National Park, stow your food in airtight containers inside your
vehicle, out of sight, and never, ever in your tent. Mountain lion
encounters are rare, but a lion did attack a child inside the park in
1997. When they do attack, cougars usually go after children or
small adults, often when the victims are running. If you encounter a
large cat in the forest, do your best to act like something other than
a deer — seriously. Stand up tall, talk, walk backwards slowly, and
toss a few rocks in the general direction of the cat. Whatever you
do, don’t bound away through the underbrush. As for elk and
moose, a general rule is to keep your distance, especially during
the fall mating season or if calves are present. Elk and moose often
bluff charges, but real attacks do happen.
 Falls: Surprisingly, falls are the leading cause of death in the park,
and not because there are so many technical climbers here. Most
falling deaths are caused by unspectacular tumbles onto rocks. So
watch your step.
 Hypothermia: A summer rain sounds innocent enough, but above
10,000 feet, the water is usually icy enough to make you hypother-
mic. Even on warm, seemingly clear days, carry insulating layers
of synthetic fabrics such as polypropylene and polar fleece —
cotton sweatshirts won’t do — as well as a water-resistant shell.
And eat and drink regularly. Hydration is a key factor in preventing
hypothermia.
 Altitude sickness: Headaches, nausea, and fatigue are common
when people move rapidly from sea level to high elevations. The
best way to avoid altitude sickness is to acclimate and take it easy
for a few days at lower elevations before climbing any mountains.
Drink plenty of water, and avoid alcohol and caffeine. If you have a
headache or nausea, the symptoms should subside if you descend
2,000 to 3,000 feet. Seek immediate medical attention if you experi-
ence vomiting, coughing, or a loss of coordination.
 Avalanches: In general, stay off steep snowfields in the backcountry
if you don’t know about snow safety. During late spring and summer,
watch for rapidly warming snow. If you’re sinking in deeper than
your boot tops in soggy snow and your route crosses steep slopes,
it’s time to switch to another activity.
Chapter 15: Rocky Mountain National Park 189

 Slab avalanches: Colorado leads the nation in avalanche fatalities.
Most of these deaths result from slab avalanches, in which a slab
of snow shears off of the snow underneath it, then rides a super-
lubricated cushion of air down to the bottom of the valley. Imagine
tilting a layer cake until the top part slides off, and you’ll have a
good picture of what a slab avalanche looks like. Now picture that
top layer accelerating to 200 miles per hour in five seconds, and
picture yourself trying to run away. . . .
At a critical angle, it may take a little prodding to make the top
layer slide, but in an unstable snowfield, the weight of one person
can sometimes trigger a large avalanche that’s been close to hap-
pening. This is no joke: If you’re unfamiliar with the rules of snow
safety, hire a guide before traveling the backcountry in winter and
spring.
 Lightning: Afternoon thunderstorms are common in summer. If a
storm approaches while you’re in the park, the best thing to do is
vacate exposed peaks and ridgelines until it passes. While heading
into heavily forested areas is a good idea, do not stand under an iso-
lated tree during a lightning storm!
Enjoying the Park
Most people explore Rocky Mountain National Park by driving some
or all of Trail Ridge Road, which tops out at 12,183-foot Fall River Pass.
Before starting your drive, stop at a visitor center and pick up a Trail
Ridge Road Guide (cost: 25¢). This self-guided driving tour provides
descriptions of 12 numbered sites along Trail Ridge Road. Even if you
don’t want to make all the stops, don’t miss the following:
 Never Summer Ranch: Located on the west side of the park, this
well-preserved homestead is one of the best places in the West to
find out how the ranch families of a century ago lived. The ranch
house and outbuildings are full of the belongings, tools, and furni-
ture of the original inhabitants. And the ranch is nestled in a forest
near the Colorado River, a half-mile away from the parking lot. (It’s a
1-mile round-trip hike.) During summer, volunteers guide free tours
of the ranch and outbuildings, open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
 Alpine Visitor Center: One of the subtle delights of Rocky
Mountain National Park is its tundra. Many well-insulated plants
and animals survive above 11,000 feet, enduring a frost-free season
of only eight to ten weeks. To find out more about them, stop at the
Alpine Visitor Center, and then drive a few miles east to Rock Cut
and hike a mile round-trip on the Tundra Communities Trail. (For
more on this trail, skip ahead to “Taking a hike.”)
Part IV: The High Country 
190

 Moraine Park Museum: Located on the Bear Lake Road, this may be
the best place in Colorado to learn about mountains. Its exhibits on
mountain-building clarify the effects of glaciers, volcanos, weather,
movements in the Earth’s crust, and other influences. Don’t miss it.
It’s open daily from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. from mid-April through
mid-October.
Taking a hike
The best way to explore Rocky Mountain National Park is by hiking some
of its 350 miles of trails. In the following sections, I suggest areas with
great hiking and offer descriptions of prime trails.
If you start your hike early in the morning, you’ll have an easier time
parking, and you’ll also avoid afternoon thunderstorms, which are
common during the summer months.
East side (Bear Lake area)
With high-alpine lakes, immense snowfields, views of Longs Peak, and
thundering waterfalls, Bear Lake is one of the most scenic areas any-
where. As you may expect, the Bear Lake area lures people by the shuttle-
load. Even after hiking a mile or so down a trail here, you can still expect
company.
Bear Lake Trail
This wide, gravel trail circles Bear Lake and has benches along the way.
The trail is considered handicap-accessible, but there are a few steep
climbs. (A sign at the trailhead provides detailed information on gradients
and widths.) Always busy, the trail opens onto views of Longs Peak and
Hallet Peak.
Distance: 0.5 mile round-trip. Level: Easy. Access: At Bear Lake. Follow Bear Lake
Road 9.7 miles off of U.S. 36.
Bear Lake to Lake Haiyaha
As you climb 745 vertical feet over 2.1 miles (one-way) from Bear Lake to
Lake Haiyaha, you pass a string of mountain lakes, each with its own
unique splendor. First there’s Nymph Lake (0.5 mile), a tiny mirror flecked
with green lilies and golden flowers. Then comes Dream Lake, flush against
mountainsides on which immense, hanging snowfields dribble waterfalls.
A few of your fellow hikers may drop out if you continue to Lake Haiyaha.
There, you have to clamber across boulders to reach the edge of a lake so
clear, you can see fish 30 feet away.
Distance: 4.2 miles round-trip. Level: Moderate. Access: At Bear Lake. Follow Bear
Lake Road 9.7 miles off of U.S. 36.
Chapter 15: Rocky Mountain National Park 191

East side (Longs Peak area)
Among the dozens of immense peaks in the park, the park’s lone four-
teener, Longs Peak, attracts the most attention. Thousands of people
climb to the top every year; for some, it’s the experience of a lifetime.
Bear in mind that if you’re willing to walk far enough to climb Longs Peak,
you could also climb a smaller, equally scenic peak in near solitude.
Keyhole Route up Longs Peak
Unless you’re a technical climber, take the Keyhole Route to reach the
summit. The first 6 miles are on a rocky but clearly defined hiking trail.
Where the trail ends in a boulder field, the 2-mile route to the summit
begins. You alternately clamber across boulder fields and traverse ledges
to reach the top. Bull’s-eyes on the rocks help you stay on course. You
need good hiking boots in order to grip on steep, slippery rocks. And you
need to prepare carefully by bringing lots of food and water, insulating
layers, a wind- and water-resistant shell, and a headlamp. The window for
summiting via the Keyhole Route is usually mid-July to early September.
Because the round-trip usually takes 12 to 15 hours, many hikers break up
the climb by spending the night at a mid-mountain campsite. Call the
Backcountry Office (% 970-586-1242) several months in advance in order
to procure a Backcountry Permit for a campsite on Longs Peak.
Distance: 16 miles round-trip, 4,855 vertical feet from trailhead to summit. Level:
Strenuous. Access: Longs Peak Ranger Station, 1 mile off Colorado 7, 7 miles south
of Estes Park.
Southeast corner (Wild Basin area)
Trails in Wild Basin are less crowded than ones around Bear Lake — yet
still busy during high season. The area is lower and warmer than Bear
Lake.
Wild Basin Trail to Ouzel Falls
This trail follows North St. Vrain Creek and then crosses two of its tribu-
taries, climbing gradually for about 900 feet en route to Ouzel Falls. The
prettiest sight along the way may be Calypso Cascades, where water
dances over boulders as smooth as marble, passing under logs jammed
helter-skelter like pick-up sticks. The trail crosses an area where wild-
flowers have spruced up a scar left by a 1978 forest fire. Then comes Ouzel
Falls, where the creek arcs off a ledge and into a pool below.
Distance: 5.4 miles round-trip. Level: Moderate. Access: Across from Wild Basin
Ranger Station. To reach the station, follow Colorado 7 for 13.5 miles south of Estes
Park; turn off at the Wild Basin Ranger Station sign and follow the signs.
West side
There’s a lot of hiking on the west side of the park, including some trails
near Grand Lake. Two prime trailheads are right across from each other
Part IV: The High Country 
192

on Trail Ridge Road, between Farview Curve and Timber Creek
Campground. The less strenuous option, Colorado River Trail, is on
the west side of the road, and Timber Lake Trail is on the east side. For
a short hike, try Tundra Communities Trail, which is east of the conti-
nental divide but on the west side of the park.
Tundra Communities Trail
This paved, half-mile trail gradually climbs across alpine tundra to some
craggy rocks. I like it because it makes you feel the raw, unfettered ele-
ments in the high mountains. The plants here are so low and tiny, they
seem to vibrate in the breezes instead of swaying. You can see where the
saturated and oft-frozen earth has squeezed broken rocks onto its surface.
And on a clear day, there are smatterings of color everywhere: yellow and
purple flowers, greenish lichens, and a cornflower blue sky.
Distance: 1 mile round-trip. Level: Easy. Access: At Rock Cut parking area on Trail
Ridge Road.
Colorado River Trail to Lulu City
The National Park Service calls this a moderately difficult trail, but the trail
is difficult only because it’s 3.7 miles (one-way) to Lulu City. As it follows
the Colorado River upstream through forests and meadows, this wide,
dusty boulevard climbs only about 350 feet. After 2 miles, you pass an old
mine and two cabins in Shipler Park. Another 1.7 miles takes you to the
deserted mining town of Lulu City — which is hardly a lulu of a city. (Seems
that after the miners left, the ranchers who followed carted away most of
the wood from the buildings.) The trail continues on to the headwaters of
the Colorado River, 8 miles from the trailhead.
Distance: 7.4 miles round-trip. Level: Moderate. Access: Well-marked parking area
for trailhead, on west side of Trail Ridge Road between Farview Curve and Timber
Creek Campground.
Timber Lake Trail
You have to work hard to reach the high-alpine lakes on the west side of
the park, but the extra effort makes the lakes seem more stunning when
you get there. (On the east side, you can drive right up to many of them.)
This trail steadily climbs 2,060 feet over the course of 4.7 miles to Timber
Lake, cupped between Jackstraw Mountain and Mount Ida. The trail is
long, but smooth and not particularly steep — most of the grades are user-
friendly. Even so, you should set aside most of a day to go up and back.
Most of the way, pine forest shelters you. As you near the lake, the trail
becomes more rugged and the forest thins, eventually giving way to alpine
meadows alongside Timber Creek.
Distance: 9.6 miles round-trip. Level: Strenuous. Access: Well-marked parking area
for trailhead, on east side of Trail Ridge Road between Farview Curve and Timber
Creek Campground.
Chapter 15: Rocky Mountain National Park 193

Roving with rangers
Ranger programs are scheduled throughout the year, with a full schedule
offered from June through September. Programs include short walks,
talks, and guided hikes of up to four hours. For a full schedule, consult
the park’s free newspaper, Rocky Mountain National Park High Country
Headlines.
Watching wildlife
It’s hard not to see wildlife in and around the park. About 3,000 elk range
from the tundra near the continental divide all the way down to the
meadows around Estes Park. They’re especially numerous on the east-
ern side of the park. Look for bighorn sheep on the tundra and near
Sheep Lake in Horseshoe Park, on the eastern side of the park. The park
no longer has grizzly bears, but it does have a healthy population of
black bears. Black bears often turn up near campgrounds, residences,
and businesses where people have not been careful with food or trash.
Watch for them in the forest. Coyotes prefer open areas but can be
found anywhere in and around the park. They look like lanky reddish-
brown dogs, only, unlike dogs, they carry their tails low between their
legs. Moose gravitate to damp, boggy lakes, river bottoms, and forests.
Most moose sightings occur on the west side of the park.
Staying Active
With mountains, rivers, lakes, trails, and sheer rock walls, Rocky Mountain
National Park attracts a range of athletes and outdoor enthusiasts. Out-
side the park, you find still more places to recreate, including less pristine
settings such as golf courses and reservoirs.
Inside the park
Hiking isn’t the only activity you can do inside the park. Check out some
other options:
 Biking: Mountain biking is prohibited inside Rocky Mountain
National Park. However, road cyclists often cross the park on Trail
Ridge Road. The road is narrow, steep, and high. Traffic can be
heavy, and the sightlines for drivers are poor. Experienced cyclists
will probably enjoy the ride on weekdays; on weekends, however,
you’re better off avoiding the crush of traffic.
 Fishing: The park’s lakes and streams have four species of trout,
but most of the fish are small. Only artificial lures and flies are
allowed inside the park, and fishing is prohibited in certain lakes
and streams. Before entering the park, pick up a Colorado fishing
license (cost: $5.25 for one day) at Estes Park Mountain Shop
(% 970-586-6548), 358 E. Elkhorn Ave., in Estes Park; or at Budget
Tackle (% 970-887-9344), 255 E. Agate Ave., in Granby. And check
at a visitor center about park-specific regulations.
Part IV: The High Country 
194

 Horseback riding: Riding is allowed on 260 miles of trails (also
used for hiking) inside the park. Hi Country Stables keeps horses
near Glacier Creek (% 970-586-3244) and Moraine Park (% 970-
586-2327) inside the park boundaries. A walking ride, through
forest and across streams costs $40 for two hours.
 Mountaineering: Skilled mountaineers often attempt challenging
routes inside Rocky Mountain National Park. The park presents
tests ranging from glacier travel to ice climbing to multiday ascents
of rock walls. If you’d like to try your hand at technical moun-
taineering, contact the Colorado Mountain School (CMS), P.O.
Box 1846, Estes Park, CO 80517 (% 888-CMS-7783 or 970-586-5758;
www.cmschool.com). The lone guide service in Rocky Mountain
National Park, CMS guides half-day excursions ($170 for one or two
people) and full-day excursions ($230 for one person, $320 for two
people), in addition to offering a variety of classes. Experienced
rock climbers won’t want to miss a chance to scale the Diamond,
the magnificent east face of Long’s Peak. The various routes range
from grade IV to grade VI, so they’re definitely for experts; maps
and information are available through Neptune Mountaineering,
633 South Broadway, in Boulder (% 303-499-8866; www.neptune
mountaineering.com).
In the gateway communities
The mountain scenery doesn’t end at the park boundaries. There’s a lot
to do on both sides of the park, including the following:
 Cross-country skiing: You can skate-ski (cross-country skiing with
a skating technique) on 95 kilometers of track at Snow Mountain
Ranch (% 970-726-4628), 9 miles south of Granby on U.S. 40. Snow
Mountain has 5 kilometers of dog-friendly trails and illuminates
another 1.5 kilometers of track for night skiing. Daily trail passes
cost $12 for adults, $5 for ages 6 to 12.
 Golfing: West of the park, near Granby, championship golf courses
are popping up faster than you can say “bogey.” The course nearest
the park is the 18-hole, par-72 Grand Lake Golf Course (% 800-551-
8580 or 970-627-8008). Greens fees are $65 for 18 holes, $40 for 9
holes. The 18-hole Estes Park Golf Course, 1080 S. St. Vrain Street
(% 970-586-8146), often hosts herds of deer and elk, so you may
have company. Greens fees are $36; $22 after 3 p.m.
Where to Stay and Dine in 
Estes Park and Grand Lake
There’s no lodging, and precious little that can really be called “dining,”
inside Rocky Mountain National Park. However, the park does have five
campgrounds totaling 587 sites. The Timber Creek, Aspen Glen, and
Chapter 15: Rocky Mountain National Park 195

Longs Peak campgrounds are always first-come, first-served. Reserva-
tions are accepted for the Moraine Park or Glacier Basin campgrounds
for dates during peak season (late May through mid-September). To
reserve a spot, call % 800-365-2267 or surf to http://reservations.
nps.gov. The cost per site is $20. Although you can’t stay in the park,
accommodations and restaurants abound in the gateway communities
of Estes Park, Grand Lake, and Granby.
Estes Park
Most of the lodging east of Rocky Mountain National Park is in the rather
crowded, tourism-happy town of Estes Park. Estes Park seems to have
more candy stores, T-shirt shops, and ice-cream parlors per capita than
anywhere else in the state, but it’s also pretty, and very convenient to
Denver and the rest of the Front Range. All around town, elk and deer
wander grassy hillsides amid greenish, lichen-stained rocks and pon-
derosa pines. When it comes to lodging, you’ll find everything from tiny
riverfront cabins to immense historic hotels.
Accommodations
Chalet at Marys Lake Lodge
$$–$$$$
Estes Park
Built between 1919 and 1925, this immense log building sat abandoned for
more than two decades after half the structure burned down in 1978. The
original windows remain, but the floor plan of the lodge has been recon-
figured. Instead of having 300 rooms, the place now has 13 suites and 3
studios, all of which have replicas of Country Victorian antiques. The stu-
dios are compact and have limited views, but the suites have sitting rooms
and plenty of floor space, and they overlook Marys Lake and the Mummy
Range. Perhaps because the inn didn’t reopen until 2001, the prices are
down-to-earth. Like the nearby Stanley Hotel, it’s rumored to be haunted.

Saying that Estes Park has a lot of motels would be an understatement.
Still, this motel is a little different. Each room has a unique quilt, and the
walls are painted to match the colors in the quilt. (Whatever you do, don’t
spill.) The owners deliver fresh-baked muffins to the rooms every morning,
and they serve tea and espresso in the 1922 lodge building. Perched on a
hillside with distant views of Longs Peak, every room has a patio complete
with old-style metal lawn furniture.

Stanley Hotel
$$$–$$$$
Estes Park
The Stanley Hotel may have inspired Stephen King’s horror story The
Shining, but the place is more picturesque than ominous. It’s a wide, sym-
metrical building, four stories high, with a white exterior and a red roof.
Fanlights in the windows, Corinthian columns, and a bell tower together
give it a classical appearance, and its position on a hillside lends it extra
prominence. The hotel’s rooms have recently been renovated and all are
bright and full of either genuine antiques or reproductions. The superior
rooms, which look south to the peaks along the continental divide, cost
$20 more than the standard rooms, which look north toward the hotel’s
courtyard gardens and smaller hills.

Estes Park
Families and groups come here to experience a wholesome, summer-
camp-style atmosphere. Situated on 860 acres, the YMCA of the Rockies
has huge playing fields, hotel rooms for 450, and vacation homes and
cabins for 210 (the small, rustic cabins are especially good values). You
can swim in an indoor pool; play horseshoes, basketball, or volleyball; ride
horses; or shoot archery. There’s a restaurant on the premises, plus three
other dining rooms for groups. It’s a family-oriented place, but anyone can
come here. For $5 per day, you can buy a temporary YMCA membership
that allows you to rent a room.

Chapter 15: Rocky Mountain National Park 197
A shining inspiration
In 1973, a stay at the Stanley Hotel helped inspire Stephen King to write The Shining.
King was experiencing what must have been a rare case of writer’s block when he
heard about Trail Ridge Road — the road that runs through Rocky Mountain National
Park — closing for the winter. An idea took root. In King’s book, the haunted Overlook
Hotel is a dead ringer for the Stanley. Parts of the original film version show Timberline
Lodge in Oregon, but the made-for-TV remake was set at the Stanley Hotel, and King
himself oversaw the production.

Expect here the type of fresh, light, creative food that’s popular in Boulder

Notchtop cooks omelettes and home fries every morning, and serves
sandwiches, salads, and burgers at lunch and dinner. Among the delica-

PIZZA
Like other restaurants in the heart of downtown Estes Park, Poppy’s gets
slammed in summer. Waves of tourists wash over the place and then ebb
away, leaving pizza crusts, dropped silverware, and napkins behind. Yet
Poppy’s does a good job of turning tables, and it serves fare that’s con-
sistently palatable. The restaurant has pizza, but you can also get sand-
wiches, burgers, and salads. During warm weather, it’s worth waiting the
extra 15 to 30 minutes for creekside seating.

SOUTHERN ITALIAN
During summer, you need to plan ahead to get a table at Sweet Basilico.
Because the restaurant charges little, seats only 32, and serves flavorful
Italian food, it often sells out two weeks in advance (though a few tables
are set aside for walk-ins). Sweet Basilico’s marinara sauce tastes gourmet
on pasta. You can also order chicken, veal, seafood dishes, and pizza. Try
the chicken Marsala sautéed with mushrooms, wine, garlic, and sweet
basil. If you forget to book ahead, you can order to go and then take your
food onto a table on the roof of the restaurant.

few differences. Grand Lake is more remote and, with a year-round popu-
lation of around 400, much smaller. It’s built on the shores of the largest
natural lake in Colorado. For lodging, Grand Lake has a historic lodge,
lakeside cabins, and motels. For less expensive lodging, drive 12 miles
southwest on U.S. 34 to the ranching town of Granby.

Grand Lake
Built in 1920, this lodge sits on a hilltop high above Grand Lake. Because
Rocky Mountain National Park surrounds the lodge on three sides, guests
can hike out of their cabins and keep going into the park. On the lodge’s
forested acreage, you can choose among activities such as basketball, vol-
leyball, or horseshoes, or best of all, recline next to a pool that seems to
hover over the lake. Most cabins sleep two to six people, and the larger
units have fully equipped kitchenettes; the smallest cabins look like stan-
dard motel rooms and only sleep two. The setting of the lodge is stunning,
and some of the rooms offer great views of the lake.

This is the little 1930s motel that could — and can. After 70 years or so, it’s
still tidy, well maintained, and thick walled. In addition to old-time features
such as knotty wood paneling, nooks with wooden benches and tables,
and steam heat, the rooms also have modern amenities such as
microwaves, refrigerators, and coffeemakers. Ask for a spot away from
Grand Avenue — the rooms nearest the road look noisy, though one

STEAK, CHOPS, SEAFOOD
This restaurant has a chef who knows what he’s doing. The décor is casual,
with a comfortable mountain spareness (and some typical country kitsch),
but the food is spectacular. Start things off with the French onion soup,
made with smoked Provolone. Frog Legs Piccatta are on the menu (oh,
my!), but I had the country-fried pork loin chops, which definitely bring
Tuscany to mind, not Iowa. The wine list is large but tame; beers from the
Grand Lake Brewery are served, though, and you know I’ll point you to
those. There’s a kids’ menu, and several pizza choices, and the bar is pop-
ular with locals.

AMERICAN
The grandiose reputation accorded Grand Lake Lodge doesn’t seem to pre-
vent the place from putting out a tasty spread at a fair price. The lunch
menu has burgers, soups, salads, and sandwiches. At dinner, the prime rib
is the main attraction, but you can also get steak, fish, chicken, and pork
dishes. Vegetarians may enjoy the linguini with sun-dried tomatoes,
capers, artichoke hearts, and kalamata olives. Families traveling with small
children will appreciate that children under 5 eat free at the breakfast
buffet. You pay a few dollars more than you would in Grand Lake, but the
lake views make it worthwhile. The best vantage point, by far, is on the
porch. Starting at the beginning of the season, you can make dinner reser-
vations for the end of the season. Make your reservations far in advance
and ask for a porch seat when you do.

Middle Park
In This Chapter
 Venturing to the playground and the icebox (and back again): Winter Park
and Fraser
 Seeking adventure farther out in the parkland
L
ike its neighbors, South Park and North Park, Middle Park is a wide,
flat valley tucked in between the Front Range and the large ranges
that fill up the heart of the high country. These high valleys, called parks
for their open expanses of treeless ground, are the heart of Colorado’s
ranching country (it’s hard to raise cattle up on the ridges, you know),
and in their own quiet way may be the southern Rockies’ most distinc-
tive feature. Their ancient post-glacial lakes and streams offer great fish-
ing; their expanses of open range make for the best snowshoeing and
cross-country skiing; and the mountains, with hiking, skiing and every-
thing else, are never far away. I’ll always feel that watching the sun rise
or set over the jagged skyline of these quiet, grassy valleys is one of the
finest experiences Colorado has to offer.
Note that the town of Grand Lake is one of the highlights of Middle
Park (see the nearby “Middle Park” map); its proximity to Rocky
Mountain National Park, though, makes it a logical partner of that
park in Chapter 15. So be sure to take a peek at that chapter when
you plan your trip to Middle Park.
Winter Park and Fraser
For years, these two side-by-side towns were best known for their cold-
ness. Fraser, which is usually a degree or two frostier than Winter Park,
registers the lowest temperature in the lower 48 states more days per
year, on average, than any other town, earning it the title of “The Nation’s
Icebox.” The daylight hours aren’t bad. But on clear nights, the warm air
dissipates and cold air plummets from the surrounding mountains onto
the 9,000-foot-high valley floor.
Fraser mostly functioned as a ranching community, while Winter Park
was the town base for the Winter Park ski resort, owned by the city of
Denver as one of its mountain parks. The main strip along U.S. 40 was

lined with hotels and restaurants that mimicked the Swiss Chalet style of
architecture, as Colorado tried to market itself as the new Switzerland.
Lately, though, the towns have become more fashionable and self-
assured. The management of Winter Park Resort has contracted with a
big-money developer to revitalize and expand its base; several large new
lodges decorated in the popular Colorado Rustic look have sprung up.
Yet there’s something endearing about the town’s remaining old-style
functionality. Area businesses don’t look so perfect as to make you nerv-
ous. Folks are very friendly. And the surrounding mountains have a

close, cozy atmosphere that’s perfect for snuggling with someone spe-
cial on a cold winter’s night.
Getting there
Winter Park is 67 miles northwest of Denver and 85 miles from Denver
International Airport (DIA; see Chapter 11). Most large domestic carri-
ers serve DIA, and major rental-car companies have desks there. For
information on contacting individual airlines and car-rental agencies, see
the appendix. To arrange a shuttle ride to Winter Park from DIA, call
Home James Transportation (% 800-359-7503 or 970-726-5060; www.
homejamestransportation.com). Cost is $44 per person.
To drive to Winter Park from Denver, go 44 miles west from Denver on 
I-70, then take U.S. 40 north over Berthoud Pass and into Winter Park.
Amtrak’s (% 800-USA-RAIL or 303-825-2583; www.amtrak.com) California
Zephyr stops in Fraser when traveling between the San Francisco Bay
Area and Chicago (and vice versa). Call for fares and schedules.
Car rentals are available through Avalanche Car Rental (% 888-437-4101
and 970-887-3908) and Hertz (% 970-726-8933).
If you’re staying in Denver and want to travel to Winter Park for a day of
skiing, consider using the Ski Train (% 303-296-4754; www.skitrain.
com), a Denver tradition since 1940. Every Saturday and Sunday from
mid-December through early April (and on Fridays during February
and March), the 17-car, quarter-mile-long train departs Denver’s Union
Station at 7:15 a.m., climbs into South Boulder Canyon and the Flatiron
Range, and then crosses the continental divide through the 6-mile-long
Moffat Tunnel. It emerges from the tunnel at the base of the ski area,
4,000 vertical feet above its starting point, and deposits as many as 750
passengers at 9:30 a.m. The return trip leaves at 4:15 p.m. About 40 per-
cent of the train’s passengers are nonskiers who take the train as a sight-
seeing excursion (a trend that one Winter Park resident affectionately
calls “Throw Mama on the train”). Round-trip coach fare is $44 for
adults, $34 for seniors and kids. A limited summer schedule also exists;
fares are $40 for adults, $35 for seniors and kids. Check the Web site for
summer schedule details.
The Ski Train has one drawback: In order to avoid over-packing the train
on Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon, your return ticket is valid
only on the same day that you travel to Winter Park, so you won’t be
able to use that ticket if you plan an overnight stay.
Getting around
These towns aren’t great for walking, because the businesses are pretty
spread out. They are, however, perfect for bicycling. You can take a
paved bike path all the way from Winter Park Resort to Fraser.
Part IV: The High Country 
204

The Lift (% 970-726-4163) provides regular, free shuttle service linking
Winter Park Resort, Winter Park, and Fraser. During ski season, the shut-
tles run every half-hour from 7:30 a.m. to midnight. From the Fourth of
July to Labor Day, there’s hourly service between 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m.
The shuttles don’t operate during spring and fall.
Home James Transportation (% 800-359-7536 or 970-726-5060) offers
taxi service at a cost of $4 for the first mile, plus $2 for each additional

Fraser Valley, home to Winter Park and Fraser, has a hodgepodge of lodg-
ing. New condos, old condos, luxury hotels, family lodges, B&Bs, guest
ranches, and chain motels all vie for your business.
Arapahoe Ski Lodge
$$–$$$
Winter Park
Run by the same family since the mid-1970s, this rustic lodge has a
Bavarian exterior and a mostly wooden interior with an intimate, British-
style pub. Knickknacks such as steins, baskets, and ski memorabilia clut-
ter shelves that seem to have been nailed up on an as-needed basis. Near
the lobby you can hang your skis on hooks, or tune them on a table. The
11 guest rooms are spare but comfortable. They don’t have televisions, so
guests spend more time in the tiny indoor hot tub and swimming pool,
around the shared television room, and in the pub. They get to know each
other even better over breakfast and dinner, which are included in the win-
tertime rates. During slow periods, the place calls itself a B&B and serves
breakfast only. It’s as old-school as they come.

Iron Horse Resort
$$–$$$$
Winter Park
Come to this large condominium hotel at the base of Winter Park Resort if
you want to get serious about skiing. The resort’s privately owned condos
range in size from sport studios with Murphy beds to two-bedroom, three-
bath units. No matter what size you choose, you get a full kitchen, a gas-
log fireplace, and a private balcony. You also have access to the hot tubs,
heated outdoor pool, steam rooms, and exercise room. If you cook a few
meals yourself, you can offset the extra dollars you’ll spend for this ski-in,
ski-out location.

The Pinnacle Lodge at Winter Park
$–$$$
Fraser
This new two-story motel has perfect paint, sharp edges, large windows,
and lots of space. Not much about the place will surprise you. All the rooms
have 28-inch TVs, coffeemakers, refrigerators, microwaves, dataports, and
ironing boards. Continental breakfast appears every morning inside a
bright, sunny breakfast area. There’s also a small indoor swimming pool
and spa. The only surprise — and it’s a modest one — is that the place is
in Fraser and not Winter Park, as the lodge’s name would seem to indicate.

Where to dine
In Winter Park, dining usually costs a little less than in other ski towns.
And most of the town’s restaurants are fine for children.
Fontenot’s Cajun Café
$–$$
Winter Park
CAJUN
This restaurant’s owner and chef, Chris Moore, likes to go on food-tasting
trips to the backwoods restaurants and food stands in rural Louisiana. He
brings the best recipes home to chilly Winter Park, where the spicy food
tastes especially heartwarming. I loved the gumbo — a soup of crawfish,
chicken, peppers, okra, tomatoes, and Cajun spices, served over rice.
Being a transplanted New Englander who fusses over fish, the owner is
partial to the Tilapia Lafayette — blackened tilapia with crawfish tail meat
sautéed in garlic, capers, tomatoes, and basil.

Hernando’s Pizza Pub
$
Winter Park
PIZZA/PASTA
Using magic markers that the restaurant keeps on hand for the express
purpose of defacing currency, customers of Hernando’s Pizza have colored
and then donated a total of 13,000 one-dollar bills to the restaurant. Rather
than open a Swiss Bank account, restaurant employees tape the bills to
the walls, posts, beams, and ceiling of the establishment, making the place
look like a combination rathskeller, gallery, and U.S. mint. No one around
here seems to know the value of a buck, but they do know their pizza —
Hernando’s bakes one of the best pies in the Rockies. For your sauce, you
can choose between white, white with extra garlic, and traditional red. Top
it with anything from almonds to jalapeños.

mignon and salmon with blue cheese. Portions are large, and the desserts
seem even larger.

SOUTHWESTERN FUSION
This Winter Park landmark changes its entire menu every six months. The
owner says that some of his regulars try all the items on every new menu,
then wait around for the next one. When I was here, they would have had
to eat their way through the likes of corn and chipotle chowder, Cajun
chimichangas, Portobello mushroom stacks, and lobster and mango faji-
tas. The bar’s enormous margaritas attract locals by the score, especially
during the late-afternoon happy hour.

Exploring Winter Park and Fraser
For a long time, there was little to do around here except ski. Now, though,
the focus has opened up a lot and you can find plenty to do, winter or
summer. Read the “Heading farther into the Parkland” section later in this
chapter for more activities just a short drive away.
The best things to see and do
If you visit here, plan on spending time exploring the mountains. But if
you need some rest, you can try the following:
 Hit the old community center. Built in 1876, Cozens Ranch House,
77849 U.S. 40, between Winter Park and Fraser (% 970-726-5488),
was the first homestead in the Fraser Valley and later served as a
post office, stagecoach stop, and chapel. The house has displays
on area history, including one on World War II–era POWs who
worked in the local timber industry. It’s open in the summer
Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday from
Chapter 16: Middle Park 207

1 to 5 p.m. Other months, it’s open Wednesday through Saturday
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. Admission is $5
for adults, $4 for seniors 62 and up, and $2 for students.
 Be a-mazed. Kids in particular will enjoy the summer activities at
the base of Winter Park Resort (% 970-726-5514; www.skiwinter
park.com). Options include an alpine slide, mini golf, the Amaze’n
Human Maze (a life-sized outdoor maze), indoor and outdoor
climbing walls, and gravity-defying bungee and zip-line activities.
You can pay for activities individually, at prices ranging from $4 to
$10, or get a half- or full-day park pass (cost: $34 and $40, respec-
tively). Winter Park Resort is open daily from 10:00 a.m. to 5:30
p.m., from early June to early September.
If you do pay for activities at Winter Park individually, you can run
up a big tab in a hurry.
Staying active
If you come to Middle Park on a weekday, you can often enjoy the back-
country in near solitude; on the weekends, expect company from
Denver. Some of the best recreation choices include the following:
 Hiking: On foot, you can use all the same trails (550 miles’ worth)
that the mountain bikers do, or you can drive a little higher in the
mountains and hike in the Vasquez, Byer’s Peak, and Indian Peaks
wilderness areas. You can reach two premier trails by taking
County Road 73 out of Fraser and then following the signs: The St.
Louis Lake Trail goes 3.4 miles to St. Louis Lake, and the rugged
Byer’s Peak Trail rises 2,000 vertical feet over 3.7 miles to the
12,804-foot Byer’s Peak, affording panoramic views of the Fraser
Valley. Allow 30 minutes to drive to these trailheads from Fraser.
You need a high-clearance vehicle (and no trailer) to get there. The
Arapahoe National Forest Sulphur Ranger District Office, off U.S.
40, 1⁄2 mile south of Granby (% 970-887-4100), has maps and infor-
mation on these areas.
 Mountain biking: Over 500 miles of trails thread their way through
the Fraser Valley, supplementing the 50 miles of lift-served paths at
Winter Park Resort (% 970-726-5514). Because many Fraser Valley
trails are on relatively smooth forest floors, this is an ideal place to
learn how to mountain bike. You can get free trail descriptions and
maps at the Winter Park Visitor Center (78841 U.S. 40; % 800-903-
7275). Intermediate and advanced riders will enjoy the Creekside
Trail, which parallels St. Louis Creek. To find the trailhead, pedal
3 miles west out of Fraser on County Road 73 and then go left at
the turnoff for the St. Louis Creek Campground. Starting on the
Creekside Trail, you can access intermediate and advanced single-
track trails known as Flume, Zoom, and Chainsaw, plus many
others. The trails have a few rocky, technical spots but mostly
travel through gently undulating forest. Take your map, because
you may have to improvise on your return. If you’re pedaling with
Part IV: The High Country 
208

small children or just want to relax, try the Fraser River Trail, which
parallels the Fraser River between Winter Park and Fraser. Beaver’s
Sport Shop, 79303 U.S. 40 in Winter Park (% 970-726-1092), rents
full-suspension and front-suspension mountain bikes all day for $30
and $18, respectively.
Hitting the slopes
Dollar for dollar, pound for pound, this is my favorite resort in the state.
For a megaresort that ranks among the nation’s busiest mountains,
Winter Park Resort (% 970-726-5514; www.skiwinterpark.com) feels
like a throwback. It’s still owned by the city of Denver, which established
it as a park in 1939. Many skiers arrive here on the Ski Train, via a his-
toric rail line that passes within yards of the base area (see “Getting
there,” earlier in this chapter). And because of cold temperatures and
a storm-trapping location just west of the continental divide, the snow-
pack (the actual amount of snow on the ground) here usually ranks
among the deepest in the state, calling to mind the days, etched in
every aging skier’s memory (or imagination), when it really did snow.
It’s the closest full-service mountain resort, mileage-wise, to the Mile
High City, so you can get here easily and enjoy the area’s mix of terrain.
Winter Park serves up a pleasing variety of mogul runs, cruisers, and
beginner runs, sometimes in close proximity to one another. If you want
to concentrate on expert runs, you can bounce down long, steep mogul
runs on Mary Jane, the most challenging of Winter Park’s three moun-
tains. For more on the resort, see the chart on the inside back cover of
this book.
Novices will appreciate the Galloping Goose chairlift, which serves
fenced-in, beginner terrain. Tickets for this chairlift cost just $5, making
it an ideal place to teach children how to ski.
Chapter 16: Middle Park 209
The Fraser Tubing Hill
If, after a long day of skiing, you’re still intrigued by the combination of snow and grav-
ity, get yourself over to the Fraser Tubing Hill (behind the Alco Shopping Center in
Fraser; % 970-726-5954) and keep sliding. It’s probably the most fun thing a family can
do in the evening here: a specially designed tow rope hauls you up the well-lighted,
groomed slope, and you ride your specially designed inner tube down in any position
you want. Tube rental is $14 per hour for adults, $12 for kids ages 7 to 15. The hill is
open Tuesday through Thursday 2 to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., and
Sunday 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. (closed Mon).
It’s a blast. I’ve even done it with friends as an afternoon trip from Denver, followed by
dinner at Beau Jo’s in Idaho Springs (see Chapter 12).

Heading farther into the Parkland
Beyond Winter Park and Fraser, Middle Park opens up to incorporate
some beautiful rangeland, as well as the upper reaches of the mighty
Colorado River.
Two classic ranch-resort experiences
Winter or summer, ranch resorts sometimes represent the best Colorado
has to offer. Here are two Middle Park favorites:
 Snow Mountain Ranch: Operated by the YMCA of the Rockies,
Snow Mountain Ranch (1101 County Road 53, Granby; % 970-
887-2152; www.ymcarockies.org) has accommodations ranging
from campsites ($20 per night) to two-bedroom rustic cabins
($143) and four-bedroom cabins ($243). The ranch has a dining hall
for all meals, and a cafe that’s open during ski season. Among the
vast array of amenities and activities are an indoor pool, climbing
wall, sauna, craft shop, hiking, cross-country skiing, and snowshoe-
ing. Lodging-and-ski packages are available in conjunction with
Winter Park Ski Resort, and outdoor education packages for both
adults and kids are available. Conference groups and family reunions
are welcome as well. If you’re staying elsewhere, you can drop in
and snowshoe or ski cross-country in some of the best terrain in the
state; they have equipment rental and guided day trips available

as well. For families and the budget-minded, it’s one of the best all-
inclusive resorts in Colorado.
 Devil’s Thumb Ranch: The largest Nordic center in Middle Park,
Devil’s Thumb Ranch (% 800-933-4339; www.devilsthumbranch.
com) grooms 100 kilometers for skate and classic skiing and also
has marked trails for snowshoers. But it doesn’t stop there: This is
another premiere all-inclusive ranch, and one that doesn’t skimp
on the finer points of the experience. Accommodations range from
lodge rooms (winter only $89–$129) to one- to four-room cabins
($159–$750) and come with continental breakfast and a daily wine
and cheese sampling. Facilities include an indoor pool, sauna, hot
tubs, video rental, ice skating rink, and sleigh rides. The bar and
restaurant are casual but elegant, and provide a cozy après-ski
environment. If you want to drop in for cross-country skiing, trail
fees are $15 for a full day, $10 after 12:30 p.m. The ranch is at 3530
County Rd. 83, off U.S. 40 south of Tabernash.
Staying active
The Pole Creek Golf Club (% 800-511-5076 or 970-887-9195; www.pole
creekgolf.com) boasts 27 holes at 8,600 feet above sea level. It consis-
tently ranks among the top public courses in America, and in 1985 it won
Golf Digest’s award as the best new public course in America. Greens
fees are $80 during high season, $59 during low season. To get there,
take U.S. 40 11 miles west from Winter Park to County Road 5.
On the slopes
SolVista Golf and Ski Ranch, near Granby (% 800-757-7669; www.
solvista.com), spans two hills amid gently undulating rangeland
where, come spring, sagebrush pokes through melting snow. The 33
mostly gentle trails funnel down to a single base area, so rounding up
the kids here is easy.
In the mid-1990s, SolVista’s ownership theorized that this environment
could be as pleasant for humans as it had been for cows in years past.
After trading for 1,000 acres of Bureau of Land Management land near
the old Silver Creek Ski Area, they laid plans for a year-round resort with
recreation options ranging from cross-country skiing on a groomed, 40-
kilometer trail system, to golf on a 7,200-yard, championship golf course.
The development is in its fledgling stage — during the next 20 years,
SolVista hopes to build as many as 5,000 single-family homes and condo-
miniums. If the resort can complete this build-out without disrupting
what today is a remarkably serene place — no easy task — SolVista will
remain a nice place for family ski vacations.
See the chart on the inside back cover of this book for technical data on
SolVista.

Summit County
In This Chapter
 Discovering the best family skiing in Colorado
 Taking on some of Colorado’s more challenging slopes
 Relaxing in cool towns with great après-ski for everyone
F
irst, the bad news: Summit County is not the most pristine part of
the Rockies. In the heart of the county, a large reservoir stalls water
before diverting it to Denver via a tunnel through the continental divide.
Not far away, I-70 burrows through the divide and emerges in Summit
County, where it’s soon engulfed by chain restaurants, retail outlets,
and some bona fide sprawl. Many historic buildings dot Frisco and
Breckenridge, but condominiums and newer communities have sprouted
up all around them. Even the river channels have been altered by dredge
mining.
Nevertheless, this semideveloped mountain setting has some real advan-
tages, not least of which is its proximity to Denver. In ideal conditions,
you can get to Summit County (see the nearby “Summit County” map)
from the Mile High City in an hour and a half. Once you’re here, you can
use free mass transit to reach all four ski areas and the major towns.
You can choose from an array of lodges throughout the county, ranging
from slopeside condos to chain hotels near the interstate. And during
summer, you can pedal on 55 miles of paved bike paths. If you do need
to escape civilization, the 315,000 acres of national forest awaits.
Summit County Essentials
A historic mining town, Breckenridge is the largest and best-known
community in Summit County. Located alongside I-70, Frisco has a
relaxed Main Street and a number of quirky lodges and restaurants. Two
other towns, Dillon and Silverthorne, are on the east side of the reser-
voir, opposite Frisco. This chapter doesn’t devote much space to the
last two spots, but you should know that Dillon and Silverthorne have
many chain hotels and are viable choices for travelers on a budget.

Getting there
Denver International Airport (DIA) is your best bet if you want to fly
close to Summit County. Most major airlines serve DIA, and the biggest
rental-car companies have desks at the airport; see Chapter 11 for details.
For information on contacting individual airlines and car-rental agencies,
see the appendix.
Because Summit County has an excellent mass-transit system, many
people bypass the rental-car desks and take shuttles to their accommo-
dations. Colorado Mountain Express (% 800-575-6363 or 970-926-9800;
www.cmex.com) will take you from the airport to Summit County for $56
per person.
If you’re driving, Frisco is 58 miles from Denver on I-70. To reach
Breckenridge, exit on Colorado 9 at Frisco, and drive 9 miles south
into town. To reach Copper Mountain, keep going 14 miles west of
Frisco on I-70.
Getting around
In Summit County, it’s often easier to get around by shuttle than by car.
By riding the shuttles, you can spare yourself parking headaches near
the ski areas and in downtown Breckenridge. Three different shuttle
services operate in Summit County:
 In Breckenridge, you can get around town year-round on the Free
Ride buses (% 970-547-3140). The busiest routes operate from
6:30 a.m. to midnight. You can avoid paying for parking during peak
winter periods by using the free lots at the north end of town and
then taking a shuttle downtown.
 The Summit Stage (% 970-668-0999) provides free transportation
to major towns and resorts in Summit County, including Copper
Mountain, with hourly service between 6:30 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. All
the town-to-town routes pass through Frisco Station, behind the
Safeway store in Frisco, one block west of the junction of Colorado
9 and I-70.
 When the ski areas are open, KAB Shuttle (% 970-496-4200)
offers regular, free service between Breckenridge and Keystone,
where connecting service to A-Basin is available. Call for hours of
operation.
During summer, the cleanest and most enjoyable way to travel
Summit County is by bicycle. Fifty-five miles of paved paths link
Frisco, Breckenridge, Copper Mountain, and Vail. Many of these paths
travel in forests away from roads. For more on bicycling in Summit
County, skip ahead to “Staying active” later in this section.
If the shuttles don’t show or your bike breaks its chain, contact 453Taxi
(% 970-453-TAXI).

214

Where to stay
You can find almost every type of lodging in Summit County, but condo-
miniums far outnumber hotel rooms.
Most of Summit County’s chain hotels are concentrated along I-70
near Frisco, Dillon, and Silverthorne, a few miles from the ski areas.
Options include the Best Western Lake Dillon Lodge, 1202 N. Summit
Blvd., in Frisco (% 970-668-5094); Days Inn, 580 Silverthorne Lane, in
Silverthorne (% 970-468-8661); Holiday Inn-Summit County, 1129 N.
Summit Blvd., in Frisco (% 970-668-5000); and Super 8, 808 Little
Beaver Trail, in Dillon (% 970-468-8888).
You may save a few dollars by staying at a chain hotel, but if nightlife
is important to you, pay a bit more and get a room or condominium in
Breckenridge. For proximity to the slopes, consider the base areas at
Breckenridge, Keystone, and Copper Mountain.
Chapter 17: Summit County 215
A condo of your own
Central reservations agencies handle most of the bookings for the many condomini-
ums in Summit County. Agencies can search for accommodations by price range, size,
and location. Upon arriving, however, you may not always get the attentive service
you expect of a luxury hotel. Still, it’s your best (and sometimes only) option if you want
to stay next to the chairlifts. Here are some places to start your search:
 Copper Mountain Resort (% 800-458-8386; www.coppercolorado.com) han-
dles the lodging at its base, in three villages linked by a free shuttle service.
Accommodations range from studios ($118–$344) to four-bedroom condos
($330–$499). All are close to the lifts and, from what I saw, most seemed comfortable.
If you’re single (or simply rowdy), the main drawback to Copper is the lack of
nightlife. Most restaurants and bars close by 10 p.m., even during high season. This
could change in the next year as Copper continues a large base-area expansion.
 Keystone Central Reservations (% 800-842-7417 or 970-496-4242; www.
keystoneresort.com) owns or manages 1,600 condominiums near the ski
area’s base, with a standard slopeside studio that sleeps four costing between
$288 and $368. Keystone prides itself on being family-friendly and schedules a lot
of activities for kids and parents.
 Breckenridge Central Reservations (% 888-697-7834 or 970-453-7238; www.
gobreck.com) oversees 3,100 rooms and condos in Breckenridge, including
some near the base of the mountain. A standard slopeside studio at Breckenridge
generally costs between $200 and $365.

Frisco Lodge Bed & Breakfast

Some of the Frisco Lodge’s rooms are in a creaky (but charming) 1885
boarding house; the rest are in a solid, two-story 1965 motel. All are clean,
compact, and decorated in flowery patterns. If you want festive sur-
roundings, try the boardinghouse. It has a big TV area where guests gather
and watch movies along with the lodge dog, Sugar. The motel rooms feel
more private. Unlike some of the lodge rooms, all the motel rooms have
their own bathrooms. When you factor into the rate the free breakfast you
get here, the price is hard to beat.

prices, and immense three-course breakfasts. The rooms are each sump-
tuously decorated in a different motif. In the next few years, you should
be able to ski right to the lodge, because the ski area is planning to build
a chairlift and cut new trails through the forest above the inn. For now,
however, you’ll have to catch a shuttle outside and ride the full two min-
utes to the mountain.

Forget about the kitchenettes, fireplaces, and washer/dryers in the guest

Where to dine
Summit County pulls a lot of visitors from heartland states such as
Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas, so it should come as no surprise that
many restaurants here serve family-friendly American fare such as
steaks and barbeque. When you pay for dinner, however, you’ll find out
you aren’t in Kansas anymore. But you’re not in Aspen, either.
Blue Spruce Inn
$$
Frisco
AMERICAN
Before Dillon Reservoir submerged the old town site of Dillon, this 1944
inn was trucked in pieces to Frisco. Today the interior feels earthy yet
homey, like a log cabin run by a Cub Scout Den Mother. The restaurant
serves standbys such as ribs, steaks, trout, and roast pork, as well as some
creative pasta dishes. If you want to dine in your flip-flops, you can order
the same food in the barroom, where there’s a historic Brunswick bar that
was trucked here in pieces from a condemned building in Black Hawk.

Frisco
AMERICAN/PIZZAS
This place was called Uptown Bistro until the owners decided that the
name implied something fancy. Truth is, there could be fine dining here:
The eclectic menu has some delectable pasta and fish dishes, and the
dining room looks as if it aspires to be upscale. Yet the owners have gone
the other way, preferring to make people aware of the pizzas, big portions,
huge selection, and relaxed atmosphere. The restaurant sometimes closes
in the late fall, so call before you go if you plan on coming here during that
time of year.

PUB FARE
These days, Breckenridge Brewery produces most of its beer in Denver,
but the staff still whips up a few batches on the premises of this restau-

that beer drinkers may find strangely reassuring. Along with four staple

tortilla-crusted tofu with vegetable, bean, and green mole chili to grilled
ono with wild mushrooms, wilted spinach, Brussels sprouts, toasted cous-

Channel and not the Food Channel, take a seat at the tapas bar and ask the
chefs behind the counter to explain who’s who, or what’s what (for the

order some wine from one of the most extensive wine lists in town.

AMERICAN
Located in a 19th-century home, the Hearthstone feels more formal than
other area restaurants. Most dishes combine comfort food and contem-

prime rib, and filet mignon. Locals seem divided about the Hearthstone,
saying it’s (a) overrated, (b) the best restaurant in Summit County, or (c)
unaffordable. One person argued for (d) “all of the above.” Still, the
Hearthstone has enough local support to have been named Breckenridge’s

Exploring Summit County
With ski areas, historic towns, and mountains, you can always find some-
thing to do in Summit County. If nothing is happening in the town where
you’re staying, check on the ski areas, which promote special events
most weekends during summer and early fall. To catch up on happen-
ings around the county, pick up a copy of Summit Daily News upon arriv-
ing, or surf the Internet to www.summitdaily.com.
The best things to see and do
In Breckenridge and Frisco, you can throw a little history into your shop-
ping, and vice versa. Afterwards, look for a cultural event, concert, or
show. Here are a few options:
 Shop ’til you need oxygen. Breckenridge’s downtown shopping
district is home to about 200 shops, many of them tucked into
small spaces on the town’s Main Street. Frisco’s downtown is
smaller, but, like Breckenridge, it has fun stores and character.
Part IV: The High Country 
218

 Breathe your money’s worth. If you get winded from the intense,
high-elevation shopping, stop at The O2 Lounge, 500 South Main
St., in Breckenridge (% 970-453-6262), where ten minutes of pure
oxygen costs $10. You can breathe as fast as you want. The lounge
also has aromatherapy, smoothies, and herbal drinks.
 Make a balloon payment. Colorado Rocky Ballooning (% 888-468-
9280 or 970-468-9280; www.coloradoballoonrides.com) offers
the highest commercial balloon flights in the United States. The
one-hour, sunrise flights take off near Breckenridge at 9,600 feet
and, under ideal conditions, ascend another 2,000 feet from there.
The $195 per-person cost includes a photograph and a champagne
breakfast.
 Absorb some sounds. Dillon, Frisco, and Breckenridge all offer
free music during summer. Breckenridge hosts a high-caliber classi-
cal music festival (% 970-453-9142; www.breckenridgemusic
festival.com) during July and August.
 Brake for history. The Frisco Historic Park, 120 Main St., in Frisco
(% 970-668-3428), comprises 11 historic buildings surrounding a
1911 schoolhouse that now serves as a museum. You can stroll
through an 1881 jail, a 1941 log chapel, and an 1890 ranch house,
among other options. It’s open Tuesday through Sunday from
11 a.m. to 4 p.m. during summer, and Tuesday through Saturday
from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. the rest of the year. Admission is free.
 Seek out Breckenridge history. The Summit Historical Society
(% 970-453-7798 for recorded information; % 970-453-9022 for
tour reservations) can direct you to some of the most intriguing of
Breckenridge’s 170 historical sites. You can visit some spots alone;
to see others, you have to sign up for guided tours ($6 adults, $2
children 2 to 12). To get started, stop at the Free Museum at 111
Main St., in Breckenridge. Open daily from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., the
museum houses rotating displays on area history. While you’re
there, you can get information about the other Summit Historical
Society sites, including a placer mining gulch, where water was
used to blast hillsides to extract gold; an underground gold mine;
and the former home of Edwin Carter, whose collection of taxi-
dermy ended up at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.
For more about that museum, see Chapter 11.
Especially for kids
Peak 8 Fun Park at Breckenridge Ski Resort (% 800-789-7669 or 970-
453-5000; http://breckenridge.snow.com) has three different alpine
slides ($10 per ride, $8 kids ages 7 to 12), miniature golf ($6 per round),
a mountain-bike park ($10 per lift ride, $8 kids), scenic chairlift rides
($8 adults, kids $4), a human maze ($5 adults, $4 kids), a climbing wall
($6 per climb), and kids’ center.
Chapter 17: Summit County 219

If you want to keep the kids busy for more than an hour or so, it’s worth it
to throw down for a half-day ($45) or full-day ($60) pass that lets junior go
wild on all the above. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from mid-June to
early September.
Staying active
With four ski areas, three Nordic centers, three ice rinks, four golf courses,
the state’s second-largest body of water, a whitewater park, and 315,000
acres of national forest, there’s a whole lot for an outdoorsy person to do
in Summit County. You can scratch the surface by:
 Biking and hiking: For starters, you can cover 40 miles of paved
bike/hiking paths, including one path that climbs 1,500 feet over 14
miles from Frisco to Vail Pass. Avalanche Sports, 540 S. Main St., in
Breckenridge (% 970-453-1461), rents a variety of bicycles at costs
ranging from $20 to $38 per day and has copies of the free Summit
County Bike Trail Guide, which describes all the paved paths as
well as 27 more rugged rides in the area. The Arapahoe National
Forest Dillon Ranger District Office, 680 Blue River Parkway, in
Silverthorne (% 970-468-5400), can help you locate prime areas
for high-alpine hiking and mountaineering.
 Boating and sailing: At 3,200 acres, Dillon Reservoir is the second-
largest body of water in the state and plenty big for boating and
sailing. However, because it holds drinking water for Denver, you
can’t swim or use a personal watercraft. You can, however, rent
fishing boats, pontoon boats, and sailboats at either of two mari-
nas. Dillon Marina, on Lake Dillon Drive in Dillon (% 970-468-
5100), would be my first choice for renting a sailboat or taking sail-
ing lessons. It also has a tiki bar and a large public boat ramp.
Frisco Bay Marina, 900 E. Main St., in Frisco (% 888-780-4970), is
the better choice for paddle sports. It rents one-, two-, and three-
person canoes, sea kayaks, and paddleboats, and offers kayaking
lessons.
 Cross-country skiing: With four Nordic centers, Summit County
offers just as many options to cross-country skiers as to down-
hillers. The largest area, the Frisco Nordic Center (% 970-668-
0866), south of Frisco on Colorado 9, has a groomed 43-kilometer
trail system alongside Lake Dillon. Breckenridge Nordic Center,
1200 Ski Hill Rd. (% 970-453-6855), sets 32 kilometers of track in
meadows and forests at the base of the Breckenridge Mountain
Resort. Both areas also have ungroomed trails for snowshoeing.
A day pass good at both centers costs $14 for adults, $10 for sen-
iors 55 to 69 and kids 7 to 16. You can also find groomed Nordic
trails at Keystone (% 970-486-4275) and Copper Mountain
(% 970-968-2882).
 Golfing: Breckenridge Golf Club, 200 Clubhouse Dr. (% 970-453-
9104), has three distinct, Jack Nicklaus–designed nine-hole courses.
You can reserve tee times up to four days in advance. During peak
Part IV: The High Country 
220

periods, greens fees are $120. On certain days, however, you can
pay $75 for unlimited play after 3:30 p.m.
 Kayaking: After a few whitewater kayaking lessons at Frisco Bay
Marina (see the previous bullet item on boating and sailing), you’ll
be ready to tackle the whitewater park on the Blue River in down-
town Breckenridge. You can walk there from the Breckenridge
Recreation Center, 0880 Airport Rd. (% 970-547-3125 for recorded
information, or 970-547-3125), which is off Colorado 9 at the north
end of town.
Hitting the slopes
Arapahoe Basin
Local snowboarders have numerous reasons for adoring the steep little
mountain they call A-Basin. The Arapahoe Basin Ski Area (% 888-ARA-
PAHOE or 970-468-0718; www.arapahoebasin.com) has free parking
right near the base, so you won’t need a travel agent to get from your
car to the chairlift. The 13,050-foot summit — the highest inbounds ter-
rain of any North American ski area — leaves flatlanders breathless but
lets the area stay open into summer for die-hard boarders. And, finally,
the terrain is a hoot. A-Basin is less than one-tenth the size of Vail yet
has as much really steep terrain as you’ll find in Vail’s entirety. When not
hiking the chutes on the area’s East Wall, skilled boarders gravitate to
the steep gullies and glades below the Pallavinci Lift. Intermediates can
cruise the gentle bowls nearer the summit. Beginners are relegated to
the lower mountain — or Keystone. Even the trail map seems relaxed
and familiar, as befits an area for locals. It advises that the message
boards at the bottom of the hill “are especially helpful if your friends are
flaking out” and recommends that skiers “use sunscreen by the gallon.”
For more on the resort, see the inside back cover.
Breckenridge
For the past few years, Breckenridge Ski Resort (% 800-789-SNOW or
970-453-5000; http://breckenridge.snow.com) has rivaled and some-
times bypassed Vail as the most popular ski area in North America.
Visitors seem most enthusiastic about the easy access, the fun town, the
abundant intermediate terrain, and the multiday lift tickets, which are
also good at Vail, Keystone, and Beaver Creek. As for the mountain, it’s
big: 139 trails slice through pine and aspen forest on the flanks of four
side-by-side peaks (numbered 7, 8, 9, and 10). Higher up, Breckenridge
has nearly 800 acres of ungroomed bowl skiing, some of which are acces-
sible only by hiking. This terrain is exhilarating on a powder day, but
because of the resort’s popularity, the powder often gets tracked quickly.
Breckenridge also enjoys preferred status among snowboarders. Readers
of Snowboard Life voted Breckenridge’s SuperPipe number-one in the
nation and judged its terrain park number-two. Check out the technical
information on the resort on the inside back cover.
Chapter 17: Summit County 221

Copper Mountain
Part of a project that has grown steadily since opening in 1972, Copper
Mountain Resort (% 866-841-2481; www.coppercolorado.com) now
ranks among the busiest resorts in Colorado. Because of its proximity to
I-70, you can watch tractor-trailers rumble past while standing in line for
the High Point chair. And the base area, though pleasant for families,
lacks the character (and characters) found in nearby mining towns. But
that’s all at the bottom. After hopping on a chairlift, you’ll discover ter-
rain that a Forest Service researcher once called “the most nearly per-
fect ski mountain in the U.S.” Intermediates have two huge areas of the
mountain to themselves. Beginners can ski from near the summit to the
base and even have access to a very gradual bowl. Advanced riders
make out best of all. They can choose from mogul runs such as Triple
Threat or look for untracked powder in any of four 12,000-foot bowls.
This mountain was the biggest surprise during my tour of Colorado ski
areas — fun, varied, and challenging. See the inside back cover for fur-
ther details on Copper Mountain.
Keystone
This is where I and most of my friends learned to ski. Most families who
go on ski vacations aren’t looking to appear in a Warren Miller movie.
They just want to be safe, be comfortable, and have fun. For them,
there’s Keystone (% 800-344-8878 or 970-496-4589; www.keystone
resort.com), the third-most-popular resort in Colorado. Keystone
offers specially priced packages for families and throws in passports
good for activities away from the slopes (anything from Nordic skiing to
yoga). As for the skiing, a high intermediate could handle about 80 per-
cent of the runs on Keystone Mountain and North Peak. A few expert
skiers have ventured to Keystone in recent years to attack the glades
and chutes in the Outback, the highest and most challenging part of the
resort. Because most expert riders thumb their noses at Keystone, the
powder tends to last longer here than at other Summit County ski areas.
Keystone also illuminates 17 trails for night skiing. See the inside back
cover for more info on this great resort.
Nightlife
Breckenridge jumps on the weekends, when young professionals from
Denver check into condos and then check out the scene. A lot of them
go to Cecilia’s, 500 S. Main St., in Breckenridge (% 970-453-2243), which
has a large dance floor, a big selection of martinis, and a walk-in humidor
where you can pick your own cigar. DJs usually generate the sounds,
which vary from night to night.
For live music, go to Sherpa & Yeti’s, 318 S. Main St. (% 970-547-9299),
a basement barroom that books bands ranging from punk to reggae. The
best historical bar in the area is the Gold Pan Restaurant, 105 N. Main
St., in Breckenridge (% 970-453-5499). In Frisco, Moosejaw Pub, 208
Main St. (% 970-668-3931), is a friendly neighborhood tavern.

 Art-shopping and river-running in Buena Vista and Salida
W
arm winds blow north from New Mexico into the river valleys
of South Central Colorado. Flanking those valleys are some of
America’s highest, frostiest mountains — and a mother lode of mining
history.
What’s Where? The Arkansas Valley 
and Its Attractions
Entering Leadville, you may first notice mine tailings, broken-down
machinery, dilapidated trailers, and other reminders of the town’s
mining life, but if you drive a few more miles and look again, you find
what may be the best-preserved historic district in the state. Buena
Vista is the start of many a mountaineer’s journey into the Sawatch. And
if you’re driving through Salida on U.S. 50, the town looks like the type of
place where you’d gas up and keep moving, but a detour downtown puts
you at the heart of a thriving arts community.
Leadville highlights
The highest incorporated town in the nation, Leadville also sits within
striking distance of the state’s highest peak, Mount Elbert. The town’s
outskirts were mined as hard as any place in America, so Leadville has
plenty of history. When you’re here, check out the following:
 Mining history at the Matchless Mine, at the National Mining Hall
of Fame and Museum, and in the historic mining district

 The Mineral Belt Trail, a 121⁄2-mile hiking and biking loop that passes
pines, mountains, and mines
 The buildings in the town’s historic district, including the 120-year-
old Silver Dollar Saloon
Buena Vista and Salida highlights
These mellow towns along the Arkansas River may not look the part, but
they host the best whitewater rafting in Colorado, and are the gateway
to the Sawatch Range, the highest mountains in the Rockies. Check out
these things to do:
 A river trip on the Arkansas River
 The serenity of Cottonwood Lake, and the savage beauty of the
mountains beyond
 The many studio galleries in Salida, where artists create and sell
their work
 The Monarch Crest Trail, atop the continental divide
Leadville
At one point, during the silver boom of the 1880s, Leadville was the
largest city in Colorado. The silver market crash changed all that, of
course, and now it’s known mostly for being old — and cold. At 10,000
feet and higher, Leadville sits just below the tree line, in a limbo between
the warm river valleys below and the 14,000-foot peaks above, including
the state’s highest — 14,433-foot Mount Elbert. Its elevation means that
Leadville can get frosty at night, and its summers aren’t exactly torrid.
People drawn to the highest peaks find this a perfect base camp; others
may feel uncomfortably exposed.
Meanwhile, history buffs gravitate to the historic mines around town.
Many of these mines date to the early 1880s, when the prospectors uncov-
ered some of the richest silver reserves in the nation and the town grew
to have as many as 30,000 residents. Yet hard-rock mining also left tailings
and toxins that taint the experience for some visitors. Personally, I love
this town and its clutter of tailings, trailers, shacks, and Victorian homes.
It feels and looks like a time capsule of Colorado’s past.
Getting to Leadville
The closest commercial air service to Leadville is Vail/Eagle County
Airport (see Chapter 19), 68 miles to the northwest, but it’s cheaper to
fly to Denver International Airport (DIA), 113 miles away. Most major
airlines fly into DIA, and major rental-car companies have desks at the
airport. For details about DIA, see Chapter 11; for information on con-
tacting individual airlines and car-rental agencies, see the appendix.
Chapter 18: Leadville and the Upper Arkansas Valley 225

To drive to Leadville from Denver, take I-70 west to Exit 195 (Copper
Mountain), then go south on Colorado 91 for 24 miles. If you’re coming
from Aspen during summer and early fall, take Colorado 82 east for 44
miles (crossing Independence Pass), then go north on U.S. 24 for 15
miles. Independence Pass is closed in late fall, winter, and spring. If
you’re coming from the west on I-70, take Exit 171 (Minturn) and follow
U.S. 24 South for 33 miles to Leadville.
Getting around
U.S. 24, the main route through Leadville, enters town from the south
as Harrison Avenue. The historic part of town lines Harrison Avenue
between Second and Ninth streets. At the north end of the historic dis-
trict, U.S. 24 jogs east for a block on Ninth Street, then continues north
as Poplar Street. A number of museums and historic attractions are near
the point where the highway jogs east. Finding parking in Leadville is
easy, especially on the side streets. Public transportation isn’t an option
in Leadville, but after parking your car, you can easily cover the historic
part of town on foot.
Where to stay in Leadville
Leadville has a number of Victorian B&Bs and one 19th-century brick
hotel. The historic accommodations are the best places to stay in the
town, which also has some unspectacular older motels for travelers on
a budget.
Delaware Hotel

Leadville
Open since 1886, the Delaware Hotel became a flophouse in the 1970s
before being fully renovated in 1992. Fortunately, much of the oak wood-
work survived the lean years, and today this antique-filled hotel comes
close to reproducing its silver-boom opulence. It’s not as cozy as the
nearby B&Bs, but it has more activities, including regular murder-mystery
weekends.

Boomtown Brew Pub

There’s less oxygen in the town’s atmosphere, so your body absorbs alco-

back on the alcohol to compensate, have another pint. Along with its sea-
sonal brews, Boomtown offers four power-packed regular brews, the most
potent being the Poverty Flats Malt Liquor, which weighs in at a whopping
7.1 percent alcohol. If you remember to eat after visiting Poverty Flats, you
can choose among burgers, steaks, and chicken dishes — or go for the
owner’s favorite: the blackened tuna sandwich with “nuclear” mayonnaise.

STEAKS
Sometimes it’s nice to find a restaurant where you don’t have to think too
much; Quincy’s serves only filet mignon Sunday through Thursday, and
has only prime rib on Friday and Saturday. Each dinner comes with a roll,
salad (with house dressing), and baked potato. You just have to choose
the size of your portion: filets range from 6 to 15 ounces, and prime rib
from 8 to 20 ounces. If you insist on having something less meaty, the
restaurant will defrost some lasagna for you.

Exploring Leadville
Leadville is heaven for history buffs. The town had the most lucrative
silver mines in the country for a time, and the land around town yielded
minerals from silver to molybdenum until the 1980s. Leadville’s mining
history remains right in plain view, unadorned, and there’s a lot to
explore. In addition to those looking for historical offerings, Leadville
also attracts mountaineers, who can climb to the heavens near town.
The best things to see and do
Instead of visiting all Leadville’s museums in succession, you’re better off
mixing up your activities in order to absorb the town’s history as many
ways as possible. The suggestions in this section can get you started.
National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum
A trip to this museum helps you understand the mine buildings and
machinery you see all around Leadville. It has exhibits on all types of
mining, ranging from ancient Egyptian gold mines to modern strip mines.
There are dioramas of local mining history, re-creations of tunnels (built to
scale), and miniatures of historic mines. The Gold Rush Room and the
Crystal Room hold samples of gold and crystal, respectively, and the top
floor houses a Hall of Fame honoring legendary figures in mining.
120 W. Ninth St., Leadville. % 719-486-1229. www.mininghalloffame.org.
Admission: $6 adults, $5 seniors 62 and over, $3 children 6–12; free for children 5 and
under. Open: May–Oct daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; Nov–Apr Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Matchless Mine (Baby Doe Tabor Museum)
At the Matchless Mine, you pay to hear a storyteller recount a heart-break-
ing tale in the very place where its sad ending played out. It’s the story of
Baby Doe Tabor and Horace Tabor, a married couple who struck it rich in
silver and for years lived lavishly, holding extravagant parties and build-
ing sumptuous opera houses, homes, and hotels. Suffice it to say that the
story ends poorly for the couple. While you’re here, you can look down
into the mine shaft that helped enrich Horace and visit the shack where
Baby Doe spent her last years, but it’s the story, told right, that makes this
experience special.
Located 11⁄4 miles east of Leadville on E. Seventh St. % 719-486-4918 or 719-486-8578.
Admission: $4 adults, $1 children 6–12. Open: Summer daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; rest of year
Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Leadville, Colorado & Southern Railroad

91. After 111⁄2 miles, it approaches the Climax Mine, the world’s largest
molybdenum mine, which operated through 1986. Soon after the mine-
scarred mountainside comes into view, the train reverses direction and
returns to Leadville on the same track, arriving in town about two and a
half hours after departing. Ongoing commentary about Leadville history
accompanies the nonstop journey.
326 E. Seventh St., Leadville. % 719-486-3936. www.leadville-train.com.
Departures: Late May to mid-June daily 1 p.m.; mid-June to mid-Aug daily 10 a.m.
and 2 p.m.; mid-Aug to early Oct weekdays 1 p.m.; two Sept weekends 10 a.m. and 2
p.m. Cost: $26.50 adults, $15 children 4–12.
Another cool thing to do
Even in a two-wheel-drive car, you can easily cruise through the heart of
Leadville’s 20-square-mile historic mining district, passing the remains of
former mining operations, including tailings, piles, head frames, rusting
machinery, and abandoned buildings. Before you go, pick up a free Route
of the Silver Kings pamphlet at the Chamber of Commerce Visitors
Center, 809 Harrison Ave. (% 888-LEADVILLE or 719-486-3900; www.
leadvilleusa.com). The pamphlet has maps and directions for three
self-guided driving tours of area mines. Each drive covers roughly 10
miles and takes one to two hours. The pamphlet explains major land-
marks, which are numbered both on the map and in person.
Touring Leadville’s historic downtown
Leadville’s downtown area is one of the largest National Historic Districts
in the U.S. At the Chamber of Commerce Visitors Center, 809 Harrison
Ave. (% 888-LEADVILLE or 719-486-3900; www.leadvilleusa.com),
you can get a printed Leadville Walking Tour identifying 73 landmarks in
Leadville’s National Historic District. Besides some of the other lodges
and museums I recommend in previous sections, consider these other
stops:
 Heritage Museum and Gallery, 102 E. Ninth Street (% 719-486-
1878). This museum has a Victorian Room; a display on the 10th
Mountain Division; and folksy, big-hearted exhibits that pay tribute
to Leadville’s past. It’s open mid-May to mid-October from 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m. daily. Admission is $3.50 adults, $3 seniors 62 and over,
and $2.50 kids ages 6 to 16.
 Tabor Opera House, 308 Harrison Ave. (% 719-486-8409). Built in
1879, the 880-seat opera house was once part of the Silver Circuit
that brought famous actors and singers west to perform for the
newly minted millionaires and miners. For $4 ($2 for kids under 12),
you can walk through the opera house while listening to an audio-
taped history play over the theater’s speakers. It’s fun to see the
catacombs, dressing rooms, and stage, but for $4, it’d be nice to see
a movie, too. It’s open Monday through Saturday in summer from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Chapter 18: Leadville and the Upper Arkansas Valley 229

 Silver Dollar Saloon, 315 Harrison Ave. (% 719-486-9914). When
you’re finished walking, cool off at this saloon. The Brunswick back-
bar has been here ever since the place opened for business in 1883.
The walls are plastered with darn near everything a bar can accu-
mulate in 120 years, including serving trays, musical instruments,
historic photos, and masks.
Staying active in Leadville
The two highest peaks in the state are near Leadville in the Sawatch
Range. At 14,433 feet, Mount Elbert is the second highest in the lower
48 states, behind 14,494-foot Mount Whitney in California. Yet it’s only
12 feet higher than nearby Mount Massive. You can climb mountains
here, but there are a host of other activities to engage in as well. Here
are your options:
 Biking/walking: The Chamber of Commerce Visitors Center, 809
Harrison Ave. (% 888-LEADVILLE or 719-486-3900; www.leadville
usa.com), publishes a free guide called Mountain Bike and Recreation
Trails. If you’re not interested in the area’s rugged trails and forest
roads, try the Mineral Belt Trail, a paved 121⁄2-mile loop around the
outskirts of town. The trail passes old mines, meadows, and thick
forest while serving up mountain views. It’s closed to motorized
vehicles. At the visitor center, you can pick up a free guide that
explains the many landmarks along the trail. Bill’s Sport Shop, Third
and Harrison (% 719-486-0739), rents mountain bikes for $25 per
day, or $8 for an hour.
 Cross-country skiing: Located near Tennessee Pass, Piney Creek
Nordic Center (% 719-486-1750) grooms 25 kilometers of track in
gently rolling meadows. Track passes cost $10 for adults, $8 for
seniors and kids.
 Golfing: At 9,800 feet, the nine-hole Mount Massive Golf Course,
located 31⁄2 miles west of town at 259 County Rd. 5 (% 719-486-2176),
is the highest in North America. The strokes you gain by driving in
thin air you may lose when putting with 14,000-foot peaks as a back-
drop. Greens fees cost $16 for 9 holes, $28 for 18.
Part IV: The High Country 
230
Those hooks really carry
Because of the thin air at Colorado’s higher elevations, golf shots carry about 5 per-
cent farther on Denver’s courses and 10 to 15 percent farther in the mountains than
they do elsewhere. But before you rush off to pack your clubs, you should also know
that high handicappers seldom score better in the highlands. The thin air allows for
added lateral movement on shots as well as added distance (though balls do spin more
slowly). And people from the flatlands often get confused when they try to read greens
against a mountainous backdrop.

 Hiking/mountain-climbing: Three nontechnical hiking trails go to
the summit of 14,433-foot Mount Elbert. The easiest one, South
Main Elbert, climbs more than 4,000 vertical feet over 51⁄2 miles
(one-way) to the summit. To safely reach the top, you need to 
prepare carefully, start early, and use common sense. If you start
before dawn, you can summit and then make your way back down
before the afternoon thunderstorms spark. For additional informa-
tion on these trails, contact the San Isabel National Forest Office,
2015 Poplar St. (% 719-486-0749). Surprisingly, there’s no guide
service in Leadville, but the climbs I describe don’t require techni-
cal mountaineering skills; most fit people should be able to do
them if they take a few days to acclimate, start early, and keep an
eye on the weather.
Hitting the slopes
Ski Cooper (% 719-486-2277; www.skicooper.com) may have played a
historic role in preparing soldiers for World War II (see the nearby side-
bar “Training the 10th Mountain Division”), but you don’t have to be a
warrior to conquer its slopes. (In fact, bunnies do quite well here.) Ski
Cooper sits on a long hillside that’s gradual enough for all but the most
wobbly beginners. Its snow, which is seldom skied and entirely natural,
tends to stay soft and fresh. It’s a great place to learn, relax, save money,
and simplify the skiing experience.
For those who crave more exciting terrain, Ski Cooper offers Snowcat
Tours on nearby Chicago Ridge. The daylong tours usher skiers to
seldom-skied runs of up to 1,400 vertical feet on 2,500 acres of terrain —
more than six times the acreage inside the ski area. Cost is $234 per day
(including lunch), and reservations are required. For more on Ski
Cooper, see the chart on the inside back cover.
Chapter 18: Leadville and the Upper Arkansas Valley 231
Training the 10th Mountain Division
In the early 1940s, the U.S. Army erected Camp Hale just north of the current location
of the Ski Cooper ski area to house a special division of American servicemen whose
mission was to study technical mountaineering, alpine skiing, and mountain survival.
(Think Outward Bound with artillery.)
The men at Camp Hale, also known as the 10th Mountain Division, trained at Ski Cooper
and on the larger nearby peaks, and proceeded to win critical battles in Italy during
World War II. A monument to the 10th Mountain Division is at Tennessee Pass, just
outside the ski-area entrance. If you continue past the ski area toward Vail, you pass
roadside markers identifying the old location of the encampment, but there’s not much
left to see.

Buena Vista, Salida, and the Upper Arkansas
Buena Vista (the locals pronounce it byu-na, or just shorten the whole
name to “Byunie”) sits at the base of the spectacular Collegiate Peaks,
whose principal summits (Mt. Harvard, Mt. Yale, and Mt. Princeton)
were first summited — and therefore named — by the mountaineering
clubs of those universities toward the end of the 18th century. The
sleepy little town has anchored the few farms and ranches up here since
the silver boom played out in the 1890s. Now, it’s the base for the best
rafting in the state.
Salida came of age in the late 1800s as a railroad hub linking the mines
and mine camps of the southern Rockies to Denver. Eventually the rails
shut down, as did the smoke-belching foundry just east of town. Even
the surrounding ranches took some hits. By the 1980s, much of the
downtown had been shuttered, but Salida transformed itself. Inspired by
the lovely scenery and cheap rent, artists began opening studios and
galleries in the storefronts. Today, splashy handmade signs mark the
dozens of art and sculpture galleries in Salida’s downtown. During warm-
weather months, the artists share the town with boaters and river guides
who come here for the whitewater on the Arkansas River, which flows
along the northeast side of town. Everyone here seems to enjoy the slow
pace, the warm banana-belt weather, and the views of the surrounding
14,000-foot peaks.

Fast Facts: Leadville

Getting there
If you’re coming by car, the easiest way to get to both towns from Denver
is via U.S. 285; it meets up with U.S. 24, which comes down from Leadville,
2 miles south of Buena Vista. Continue on 285 south to Salida, which is
also on U.S. 50 between Gunnison (66 miles to the west) and Pueblo (96
miles to the east). In Pueblo, U.S. 50 meets I-25, Colorado’s primary north-
south thoroughfare.
If you want to fly to near Salida, your best bets are Denver International
Airport (DIA) (140 miles northeast; see Chapter 11) and Colorado Springs
Airport (CSA) (105 miles to the east; see Chapter 14). Nearly all the major
domestic carriers fly into DIA. Eight commercial airlines serve CSA.
In Denver, you can choose from among all the major rental-car compa-
nies. At Colorado Springs Airport, your choices are Avis, Dollar, Hertz,
and National. For information on contacting individual airlines and car-
rental agencies, see the appendix.
Where to stay in the Arkansas Valley
Buena Vista has one good hotel, and Salida offers a great selection of bed-
and-breakfasts. If you have an aversion to enormous stacks of pillows,
however, you may want to look into a privately owned motel downtown or
a chain hotel along U.S. 50. Choices include the Comfort Inn, 315 E. U.S. 50
(% 719-539-5000); the Econo Lodge, 1310 E. U.S. 50 (% 719-539-2895);
and the Holiday Inn Express, 7400 W. U.S. 50 (% 719-539-8500). The
prices are reasonable in this area, especially during winter.

high-speed Internet access. The hotel is located on the north end of town,
so you won’t get to the heart of Buena Vista without a walk (or a car).

airy and spacious, with four-poster beds, huge windows, and lace curtains
that billow in the afternoon breezes. You can walk a few hundred feet from
the inn down to the Arkansas River or simply porch-sit and take in the
silence — the inn is on a spacious 5-acre plot 3 miles outside Salida. If you
want to save a few dollars, choose the group room with a shared bath; it’s
a bit hostel-like, but it costs quite a bit less.

Exploring Salida
If town life is what you’re after, you’re definitely better off in Salida.
Before you go to town, though, take a river trip. Then wind down by
strolling through the galleries in the downtown Salida area. When you’re
done, you’re only a few miles’ drive from Monarch Pass and the conti-
nental divide.
Chapter 18: Leadville and the Upper Arkansas Valley 235

The best thing to do – art shopping
If you want to look at art, go somewhere like Aspen, where the galleries
have works by the likes of Picasso, Chagall, Warhol, and others whose
names ring a cash-register bell. But to buy art, go to Salida, where many
artists create their pieces right where they sell them. The prices are low,
and a lot of the work will move you. Many of my favorite studios are on
or near First Street in downtown Salida. Don’t miss the following:
 Brodeur Art Gallery, 151 W. First St. (% 719-221-1272; www.
brodeurart.com). Paulette Brodeur works in a variety of media,
but her most recognizable works may be her contemporary paint-
ings of musicians, cafes, and other Bohemian scenes. Her art is sold
internationally and this is where it’s made.
 BroadMinded, 132 W. First St. (% 719-539-3122). The gallery has
ceramics, paintings, and sculptures by some really talented women.
More cool things to see and do
You won’t get soaked when you shop for art in Salida, so you should
have a few dollars left over to spend on other activities you can partake
of in the area including the following:
 Soak inside. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) erected
a building around the Salida Hot Springs (% 719-539-6738; www.
salidapool.com) in 1937, thereby creating the largest indoor hot
springs pool in the state. Under one roof is a six-lane, 25-yard lap
pool where the water is a temperate 90°; a four-foot-deep, 110°
pool; a wading pool for toddlers; and four toasty, private, 113° tubs
that you can rent by the hour for $6 per person. The springs are at
410 W. Rainbow Blvd. (U.S. 50). Admission is $6 adults, $4 ages 6 to
17, $2 kids 5 and under. In summer, it’s open daily from 1 to 9 p.m.;
the rest of the year, it’s open Tuesday through Sunday from 4 to
9 p.m., and Friday through Sunday from 1 to 9 p.m.
 Soak outside. At Mount Princeton Hot Springs, 15870 County Rd.
162 (% 719-395-2361; www.mtprinceton.com), you can soak out-
side in geothermal water at the base of white cliffs. The springs
are open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily. Admission is free for guests of the
attached Mount Princeton Resort; for nonguests, admission is $8
adults, $5 children 12 and under.
 Visit a ghost town. Established in 1880, St. Elmo used to be a 
railroad way station, moving ore from Aspen and other mountain
towns down the east slope of the continental divide. Then it
became a ghost town, with a short main street lined by well-
preserved buildings. A few year-round residents live there now, 
and sometimes you can shop at the general store. To reach St.
Elmo, drive to Nathrop, 17 miles north of Salida, then head west 
on County Road 162 for 15 miles to St. Elmo.
Part IV: The High Country 
236

Staying active in Salida
Air currents from the south keep Salida warm even during winter. Yet it’s
also in Chaffee County, home to 15 of Colorado’s fourteeners — the high-
est concentration of peaks over 14,000 feet in the nation. This unusual
environment lets you bicycle in winter and cool your feet on mountain
snow (or melted snow) during summer. While you’re here, think about
the following:
 Hiking and biking: Salida’s wintertime zephyrs let you bicycle
around town even during the coldest months. However, the classic
trails are higher up near the continental divide. For a great hike or
mountain bike ride, drive to the parking area at Monarch Pass and
get on the Monarch Crest Trail. To pick it up, follow the dirt road
that begins just left of the lower tram station. About a quarter-mile
up this road, the trail branches off on the right. It’s a surprisingly
smooth terrain, given its perch near the divide. You can do a long
(12 miles each way) out-and-back or descend off the ridge on other
trails. For maps and detailed directions, consult the free Monarch
Bike Guide, available at Absolute Bikes, 330 W. Sackett (% 888-539-
9295 or 719-539-9295; www.absolutebikes.com). Absolute Bikes
rents full-suspension bikes for $35 a day; front-suspension bikes
cost $25. For information on hiking trails, stop by the San Isabel
National Forest Office, 325 W. Rainbow Blvd. (% 719-539-3591),
in Salida.
 Fishing: Head west on Cottonwood Pass road from Buena Vista.
Eight miles out of town is the turnoff for Cottonwood Lake, a beau-
tiful little trout hole between Mount Princeton and Mount Yale. Or
continue over Cottonwood Pass to Taylor Park Reservoir. If you
want to leave the fish alone, this is a great mountain drive with
hairpin turns and gorgeous scenery.
 Golfing: Salida Golf Club, at the corner of Crestone and Grant
Street (% 719-539-1060), charges $15 for nine holes or $25 to play
this city-owned course twice.
Chapter 18: Leadville and the Upper Arkansas Valley 237
The Continental Divide
The continental divide meanders on a general north–south course through the Rocky
Mountains just west of the center of Colorado. If you drive to a point on the divide, get
out of the car, and then spill a very large cup of coffee, half of your java will flow into
the rivers that empty into the Mississippi River, Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean.
The other half will pour into rivers that feed the Colorado River and head for the Sea
of Cortez and the Pacific Ocean.

 Rafting: A half-day trip down the Arkansas River costs about as
much as a day at an amusement park, and it’s a lot more rewarding.
You experience both the force of the mountains (via snowmelt)
and the peacefulness of a scenic river canyon. You can run rivers
throughout Colorado, but the best one for commercial rafting is
the Arkansas, a river known for having a long season (usually May
through August) and stretches of water perfect for everyone from
novices to experts. More than 60 companies are licensed to run
the Arkansas, so it’s easy to get on a trip. Remember that rafting
can be strenuous exercise, especially in the spring and early
summer when the river becomes ferocious with snowmelt. If 
you’ve never rafted before, consider trying a half-day trip before
you commit to a whole day.
Families with children ages 12 and up will love the half- and full-day
trips through Brown’s Canyon. These trips have stretches of calm
water where you can scan the craggy canyon walls for bighorn
sheep, interrupted by rapids with names such as Pinball, Staircase,
and Zoom Flume. Any beginning rafter will be happy here, and most
rafting companies in the area offer half- and full-day trips to this
stretch of the river.
Brown’s Canyon is genuinely exciting, but not as wild (and poten-
tially abusive) as The Numbers, which features continuous Class
IV/V waters. Trips down The Numbers are for fit, experienced
rafters only.
You can usually choose one of two kinds of boat: Paddle boats,
where you help the guide paddle, or oar boats, where the guide
does all the rowing using oars mounted on a metal frame. I recom-
mend paddling, because it involves you in the action. One experi-
enced company is Four Corners Rafting (% 800-332-7238 or
719-395-4137; www.fourcornersrafting.com), in Nathrop. Four
Corners has been in business since the mid-1970s, and offers half-
to three-day trips on different sections of the Arkansas. Half-day
trips cost $39 for adults and $33 for kids under 15, and full-day trips
go for $71 for adults and $61 for kids.
Hitting the slopes
I’d love to be at Monarch Ski and Snowboard Area (% 888-996-7669 or
719-530-5000; www.skimonarch.com) during a January storm. Situated
against the continental divide on the east side of Monarch Pass, the
mountain receives 30 feet of snow annually — one of the state’s higher
totals. The area’s 670 acres include lots of open, ungroomed terrain
that’s perfect for powder skiing. Because it sells inexpensive lift tickets
and is farther southeast than most Colorado ski areas, Monarch lures a
lot of gung-ho skiers from heartland states such as Kansas, Oklahoma,
Texas, and Arkansas. For some reason, these skiers tend to gravitate to
the run known as Lower Christmas Tree, leaving the rest of the area
unpopulated — and untracked. Even if you’re a novice, you can still
enjoy the view from the top of the aptly named Panorama chair, which

Vail and the Vail Valley

V
ail as we know it didn’t exist before 1962, when a former member of
the 10th Mountain Division started a small ski area with a lodge and
restaurant at the base. He and his friends fashioned the buildings after
the mountain villages they had seen in Europe during World War II. They
named the area for the highway engineer who designed the road into the
area, and the place took off from there. Like Aspen, Vail is now beyond
expensive, but it still welcomes thousands of skiers who drive up from
Denver on weekends, not to mention many destination travelers. Some
of the people who helped build the town have stuck around, helping pre-
serve Vail’s sense of tradition. Forty years after it started, Vail still feels
as much like a town for hardy skiers as it does a retreat for the very rich.
And it still retains its European flavor.
Twelve miles west of Vail is the resort of Beaver Creek, which is a more
secluded version of Vail. Like Vail, it has a pedestrian-friendly, European-
style village, and it costs a lot to stay there. Unlike Vail, it’s a couple of
miles uphill from the freeway, and you have to pass through a guard-
house to drive up there. Most visitors gravitate to Vail.
Vail Essentials
Don’t be put off by your first glimpse of the community. The town
extends down a river canyon alongside I-70, but the downtown villages
feel less like an off-ramp than you may think. The heart of the town —
two adjoining enclaves known as Vail Village and Lionshead — bans
most car traffic and seems remote from the freeway. In places, the
splashing of Gore Creek is all you hear. And lush mountainsides border
the south side of the community.
Getting there
Part of Vail’s allure is its accessibility. It’s right on I-70, 109 miles west of
Denver and 150 miles east of Grand Junction.

Chapter 19: Vail and the Vail Valley 241
During ski season, Vail/Eagle County Airport (% 970-524-9490; www.
eaglecounty.us/airport), 35 miles west of town, has daily nonstop
service to Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Minneapolis, and
Newark, with less frequent nonstop flights from six other U.S. cities.
American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, United Airlines, and US
Airways all fly into Eagle County. Call Colorado Mountain Express
(% 800-525-6363 or 970-926-9800; www.cmex.com) for a shuttle ride
(cost: $44 per person) into town. Hertz, Avis, Enterprise, and Budget 
all have desks at the airport. For information on contacting individual
airlines and car-rental agencies, see the appendix.
Vail is a two-hour drive from Denver, so you can also fly into Denver
International Airport (DIA), served by most major domestic carriers
(see Chapter 11). Numerous companies offer shuttle services between
Vail and Denver, including Colorado Mountain Express, which charges
$66 a person for a shared, one-way ride to Vail from DIA.
Getting around
You can get by without a car in Vail (see the nearby “Vail” map). The
town has an outstanding transit system, with free shuttles serving Vail
Village, Lionshead, East Vail, and West Vail from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. daily
during ski season. (Hours of operation are shorter the rest of the year.)
During winter, you seldom have to wait more than ten minutes for a bus.
For local shuttle-bus schedules, call % 970-477-3456. ECO Transit (%
970-328-3520 or 970-477-1606) provides regular bus service (for $2 to $3)
to outlying areas such as Avon, Edwards, Beaver Creek, and Leadville.
For a cab, call Vail Valley Taxi (% 970-476-TAXI).
Where to stay
Lodging costs a lot in Vail. If you’re a skier, you can save by shopping for
package deals or by coming before Christmas or in April — periods
when the snow can be hit-or-miss. Some lodges also discount rooms in
mid-January, when the snow tends to be light and fluffy and the cover-
age is more reliable. If you’re not a skier, consider visiting during spring,
early summer, and late fall, when the town empties and many lodges
sharply discount their rooms. If the rates still seem too expensive, look
for lodging in the nearby towns of Avon or Edwards.
Even during high season, visitors can sometimes find last-minute lodging
deals in Vail by calling the Vail Visitor Center (% 970-479-1394) or
checking www.vailonsale.com.

Pepi Gramshammer, a former Austrian ski racer, and his wife, Sheika, have
run since 1964. They live on the premises and do their best to make you
feel like family. Accommodations range from a standard hotel room to a
deluxe apartment with a full kitchen. You can unwind in the two Jacuzzis,
in Pepi’s Bar, or on Pepi’s Deck, where you can eat goulash and other
Austrian dishes.

Lifthouse Condominiums
$$–$$$$
Lionshead
Built in 1965, the hotel consists entirely of studio condominiums; each with
a queen-size bed, rollaway bed, gas fireplace, kitchenette, and dining area.
The rooms aren’t very roomy, but no space goes to waste. Four very close
adults could stay and eat in each studio in something like comfort, and the
price is almost right. The hotel’s literature says it’s only “73 seconds” from
the Gondola base but doesn’t say who’s walking. It is pretty close though.

Avon: Vail’s cure for sticker shock
No, it’s not a makeup factory, it’s a town. If the price of lodging is prohibitive to you, 
but you want the Vail skiing experience (some of the best on the planet), head for the
rapidly suburbanizing Avon, 9 miles down the valley from Vail, at the turnoff to Beaver
Creek. Here among the strip malls you’ll find a number of hotels: One that offers 
reasonable rates for decent lodgings is the Comfort Inn, 161 W. Beaver Creek Blvd.
(% 970-949-5511; www.comfortinn.com). Nothing too fancy here: straightforward
rooms, with continental breakfast in the morning. The outdoor pool and hot tubs make
après-ski a bit more glamorous. Rates vary from $79–$199 depending on season and
availability, so you’ll have a little more green to keep you from feeling like a pauper in
Vail, and you’re a short drive from the slopes of both Vail and Beaver Creek.

pool, four hot tubs, and a history of luxury and class. The prime location
and attentive service help make up for the smallish rooms. Golf and bed-
and-breakfast packages are available.

Park Hyatt Beaver Creek Resort and Spa
$$$$
Beaver Creek
Situated right at the base of Beaver Creek’s ski runs, this immense hotel
offers luxuries ranging from in-room computers to six roaring whirlpools.
The rooms, big enough for a Shriners convention, have been recently
redecorated at an inordinate cost in a Western motif. Downstairs, at the
feng shui–influenced spa, ultracontent guests drift around in robes, read
magazines, or simply relax. If all the deep relaxation and comfort puts you
under, you may need to drive into Vail for some nightlife.

Sonnenalp
$$$$
Vail Village
This hotel, my favorite in Vail, has European-mountain touches such as
arched entryways and stonework framing heavy wooden doors. At times,
there are so many German and Austrians on duty, you can be sure that the
guest-to-European ratio is the lowest in town. The rooms come with gas
fireplaces, balconies, windows that open, and heated marble bathroom
floors. A single switch shuts off all the lights in the room when you leave.
After you’re done swimming in the creek-side indoor-outdoor pool, you
can relax in the full-service spa.

Where to dine
Like the town itself, Vail’s dining scene seems to have a spoon in Europe
and a fork in the United States. Many of Vail’s best restaurants serve 
traditional French, German, Swiss, or Italian food, and most of the rest
bring European elements to American fare. The town’s list of chefs reads
like a reunion of James Beard House nominees. Naturally, dinners cost a
lot, but a few places do serve affordable fare, and many bars have spe-
cials on food and drinks.

Vail
AMERICAN
This place is a smart choice for a group of friends who can’t agree on what
type of food to eat. The menu has salads and wraps for light appetites;
chops and salmon for big eaters; and pub fare (including baby-back ribs,
fish and chips, and fisherman’s stew) for everyone else. The dining room
has a relaxed Western feel, from the antler lamps on the ceiling to the
weathered wooden floor underfoot. A lot of locals come here just for the
famous mudslides (a mixed drink made up of vodka, kahlua, and Irish
cream), which seem to go hand in hand with overgrazing.
See map p. 242. 20 Vail Rd. % 970-476-5656. Reservations not accepted. Main

La Tour
$$$–$$$$
Vail
FRENCH/AMERICAN
When Vail’s chefs go out for a delectable meal, they often order the latest
creations of La Tour’s owner, Paul Ferzacca. Ferzacca mastered French
cooking at some of Chicago’s finest restaurants. When he took over La
Tour in 1998, he began subtly tinkering with traditional French fare. The
result hardly qualifies as “French lite,” but the sauces are a little less
creamy than in Paris (or so I’m told), and Asian ingredients have turned up
in certain dishes. Plan on staying for a while; this is the place to have a
leisurely dinner. The menu is broken down into three courses plus dessert;
you may as well shoot for the moon. For a main course, try the Dover sole
in brown butter sauce.

INNOVATIVE AMERICAN
This restaurant’s press kit says that one owner, Joel Fritz, has been “mar-

other owner, Susan Fritz, has been “raising great kids and well-mannered
dogs.” The Fritz’s miracles carry over into their restaurant, which has deli-
cious food, attentive servers, and, if the pattern holds, charming prep
cooks. Dinner fare consists primarily of steaks and seafood; at lunch,
options include fish tacos, salads, burgers, and sandwiches. You can sit
on the creek-side deck or go inside to the dining room and oyster bar,
where tiny ceiling lights sparkle like stars.

CREATIVE AMERICAN
Sweet Basil is my first choice for a meal out in the mountains. This isn’t
exactly a bold choice — this bistro-style restaurant has been earning raves
for 25 years. Ask for a table with views of Gore Creek, then choose between
the fish, steak, chicken, and veal dishes, all with creative sauces. The saf-
fron linguini with lobster, bay scallops, shrimp, and cream has been on the
menu forever, and it’s delicious. For dessert, try the hot sticky toffee pud-
ding cake.

Exploring Vail
Vail doesn’t have a lot of must-see attractions, so you can relax and drift
from place to place. During summer, you may drift past gardens, moun-
tain trails, people fishing on Gore Creek, a few galleries, and lots of inter-
esting shops. Go slowly and you’ll have energy to spare for the cultural
events around town, including outdoor concerts at the amphitheater.
The best things to see and do
Colorado Ski Museum/Ski Hall of Fame
Being a nerd for old ski stuff, I love this museum. It has timelines showing
major developments in skiing and snowboarding, along with gear and
memorabilia from the different periods. It displays uniforms and equip-
ment from each winter Olympics. And it devotes an entire room to the 10th
Mountain Division. I’m partial to the vintage posters advertising ski areas
and ski movies, and the old-time footage of powder skiers shown on the TV.

The Betty Ford Gardens isn’t a rehab center like that other Betty Ford
place. Still, your head will feel better when you see the waterfalls, pools,
and 2,000 different kinds of high-alpine plants, ranging from bristlecone
pines to alpine poppies. Almost anything that legally grows at 8,200 feet is
here, including many exotics. It’s especially lovely in midsummer, when
the flowers are in full bloom.

Staying active
During winter, the activity in Vail centers around the big — make that
enormous — ski area. During the rest of the year, Vail just concentrates
on big fun. While you’re here, think about going:
 Fishing: Even during the peak runoff months, you can usually wade
and fish in Gore Creek right in downtown Vail. When the flows drop
in midsummer, you’ll fare better if you travel below the confluence
of Gore Creek and the Eagle River. Fly-Fishing Outfitters (% 800-
595-8090 or 970-476-FISH; www.flyfishingoutfitters.net) can
help you find the best holes. Guide service for wade trips costs
$200 for a half-day, $300 for a full day. Guided float trips start at
$275 for a half-day.
 Hiking: Vail Mountain publishes a map showing summer hiking
and biking trails on the ski area. You can find those maps in the
same boxes that hold ski-area trail maps during winter. The resort
has separate hiking and biking trails, so you can go for long walks
without having to dodge cyclists. For even less crowded trails, go
to Beaver Creek.
If you want to hike with guides who are knowledgeable in geology,
ecology, and history, contact the Vail Nature Center, 700 S. Frontage
Rd. (% 970-479-2291; www.vailrec.com). The Nature Center sched-
ules guided hikes most weekdays during summer, including mellow
half-day strolls near Vail Village and more rigorous all day hikes in
the nearby Holy Cross and Eagle’s Nest Wilderness Areas.
 Golfing: On the par-71, 7,008-yard Vail Golf Course, 1778 Vail Valley
Dr. (% 970-479-2260), you can tee off while taking in views of the
Gore Range. Don’t gawk too much, lest your ball end up in one of
many water hazards. You can reserve your tee time 48 hours in
advance. On weekdays, greens fees are $105, $80 at twilight; on the
weekends, they rise to $115.
Designed by Arnold Palmer, Eagle Ranch Golf Course, 50 Lime Park
Dr., in Eagle (% 970-328-2882), is the least expensive course in the
area. During summer, greens fees at this par-72, 7,506-yard course
are $85 Monday through Thursday and $90 Friday through Sunday.
 Ice skating: Here’s proof positive that the people at Beaver Creek
are not living in the real world: You can ice-skate there, outside,
year-round. Weather permitting, the rink operates from 6 to 10 p.m.
nightly. Cost for skating, including skate rentals, is $9 for adults, $7
for kids. Call % 970-845-0438 for more information. Meanwhile,
Vail has a bona fide indoor hockey rink; call % 970-479-2271 for
information on open skates in Vail.
 Mountain biking: After picking up a free trail map, you can pedal
directly onto Vail Mountain at either Vail Village or Lionshead. It’s a
long grind to gain the ridgeline, where one of the premier rides, the
7-mile Grand Traverse, begins. During summer, you can shorten
Chapter 19: Vail and the Vail Valley 247

the trip by taking the Eagle Bahn gondola or Vista Bahn chairlift to
the top. Lift tickets, valid all day, cost $16 for adults, $10 for chil-
dren 5 to12 and seniors 65 to 69, and $5 for seniors over 70. You
can also find challenging trails on the north side of I-70. Diamond
Ski Shop, 520 Lionshead Mall (% 970-476-5500), can provide direc-
tions and also rents full-suspension mountain bikes for $30 a day.
 Rafting: Lakota River Guides (% 800-274-0636 or 970-476-RAFT)
has trips ranging from mellow half-day family floats on the Colorado
River ($69 adults, $59 ages 6 to 12) to all-day white-knucklers on the
Arkansas ($119 for ages 16 and up).
Hitting the slopes
It’s hard to overstate the immensity of Vail (% 970-476-5601; http://
vail.snow.com). Its 33 lifts serve 193 trails and five bowls strung across
a ridgeline more than 7 miles long. Vail’s 5,289 skiable acres make it the
largest area in the country by 1,700 acres. It took me most of a day just
to ski into every canyon in the area boundaries. The terrain includes a
pine-covered, north-facing lower mountain with groomed trails as wide
as I-80; the famous back bowls, most of which are only moderately steep;
and the remote, shady glades of Blue Sky Basin. Beginners have an incred-
ible 35 trails to choose from in Blue Sky Basin alone. Advanced intermedi-
ates can drift almost everywhere, even into some of the back bowls.
Mogul skiers can test their mettle on the Highline run, where the bumps
are bunched like bubble wrap. And powder fanatics can float through an
average annual snowfall (348 inches) that ranks among the highest in the
state. After a storm, the powder skiers race to make fresh tracks in more
than 2,600 mostly open acres in the bowls. A few drawbacks do come to
mind: Lift lines inevitably slow skiers who don’t know their way around
the mountain; parking usually costs $12; and because the back bowls face
the sun, the powder quickly warms and condenses after late-season
storms. But that’s quibbling — this is an awesome mountain. For the 
technical lowdown on the resort, see the inside back cover.
Compared to Vail, Beaver Creek Resort (% 800-842-8062; http://
beavercreek.snow.com) is a downright intimate place, where everyone
seems eager to assist you. The meet-and-greet process starts right after
you park your car in Avon. Attendants lift the skis from your hand and
load them onto the shuttle bus for the five-minute ride to Beaver Creek
Village, where another set of attendants unloads the skis, bucket-brigade
style, and places them in a rack. After finally catching up with your skis,
you encounter greeters offering trail maps and advice. Then you take two
short rides, via sheltered escalator, to the base of the slopes. Everything
is ultraluxurious, from the dried flowers in the bathrooms to the heated
sidewalks in the base area. When you’re on the hill, you finally get to know
a delightful mountain that evenly balances beginner, intermediate, and
advanced terrain. Beaver Creek has roughly one-third the skiable acreage
of Vail, making it large enough to be varied yet small enough to compre-
hend. A lot of this terrain faces north, so the snow tends to stay cold and

soft. Grooming is cherished here, but you can also find some long mogul
runs. See the inside back cover for more information on the resort.
Shopping
The shopping in and around Vail varies by neighborhood. West Vail has
the big grocery stores, liquor outlets, and strip malls. Beaver Creek,
near Avon, offers high-end boutiques and stores, but it’s a little too
secluded to qualify as a thriving shopping district.
Vail Village has the most fun and varied offerings, including some nation-
ally known shops. One landmark store is the Golden Bear (% 970-476-
4082), famous for selling its trademarked golden bear pendants. Located
on Bridge Street in Vail Village, the store still crafts and sells a full line of
bears, ranging from silver starter-bears ($55) to diamond-studded bears
(if you have to ask the price, you can’t afford them).
Right across the street, at 273 Gore Creek Dr., is the flagship Gorsuch
store (% 970-476-2294). Among other offerings, the store sells ski attire
that does more than just keep you dry and warm; it has what the store
describes as, ahem, “flawless form . . . and a new sensuality for city,
country, and slopes.”
American Ski Exchange, 225 Wall St. (% 970-476-1477), is the place to
go when you need cheap Vail souvenirs for all your gift-greedy cousins
and co-workers. Like a Times Square electronics shop, the store always
claims to have drastically cut prices. Vail T-shirts have been sharply
reduced to two for $15, and Vail fleece vests usually cost around $15,
down from $50 or so.
Nightlife and culture
Vail has a diverse nighttime scene, with offerings ranging from dance
clubs to cigar bars, sometimes even in the same location.
The Tap Room, 333 Bridge St. (% 970-479-0500), seems like a low-key
locals’ watering hole, but if you walk upstairs to The Sanctuary, you
may find a ravelike dance party. Cover varies.
Club Chelsea, 2121 N. Frontage Rd. West (% 970-476-5600), has a cigar
bar, a disco-friendly dance club, and a lounge, all under the same roof.
8150, 143 E. Meadow Dr. (% 970-479-0607), pays real live humans to
play funk, rock, and reggae. Cover varies.
Go to Bully Ranch, 20 Vail Rd. (% 970-476-5656), for mudslides; to
Vendettas Italian Restaurant, 291 Bridge St. (% 970-476-5070), for
drafts and late-night pizza; and to the Red Lion Inn, 304 Bridge St. 
(% 970-476-7676), for après-ski.
If you want to relax with friends and hear acoustic music, The Club, 304
Bridge St. (% 970-479-0556), is a good choice. Cover is $5 after 9:30 p.m.

Fast Facts: Vail
August: Music month in Vail
During July and August, dozens of concerts and performances take place in the 
Vail Valley, many of them in the Gerald R. Ford Amphitheater, which has a large cov-
ered pavilion, an expansive lawn, and a stage from which performers can see the
mountains.
From late June to early August, the Vail Valley Music Festival (% 866-827-5252;
www.vailmusicfestival.org) presents more than 60 chamber, pops, and
orchestral concerts featuring three major symphony orchestras and 40 soloists of
international renown. Tickets range in price from $21 to $59.
The Vail International Dance Festival (% 970-949-1999; www.vvf.org) schedules
performances of contemporary and classical dance in early August. Tickets range in
price from $17 to $89.
In late July and early August, some of the world’s hottest jazz musicians come to town
for the Vail Jazz Festival (% 888-VAIL-JAM; www.vailjazz.org). In addition to
dozens of free outdoor concerts, the festival has intimate club gigs (cover charges
vary) and a festival-capping party over Labor Day Weekend. Weekend passes cost
$250, and tickets for individual shows cost $40 to $50.
The locals’ favorite is probably the Budweiser Hot Summer Nights Concert Series —
free rock, folk, bluegrass, blues, and reggae performances at the Gerald R. Ford
Amphitheater on Tuesday nights during June and July.

V
isitors to the mountain towns west of Vail (Chapter 19) and north of
Crested Butte (Chapter 22) can find plenty of variety, if not always
solitude. Forty miles south of I-70 is Aspen, a historic mining town, cul-
tural hub, and celebrity hot spot. Aspen can be hard to afford for one
person, let alone a family, but you can stay in Basalt or Carbondale and
save on lodging while exploring the five nearby ski areas. Glenwood
Springs, a small city located right on the interstate, is popular with fami-
lies and known for its enormous Hot Springs Pool.
If you detour onto less-traveled mountain roads, you can choose between
two fine destinations: Redstone offers a quiet retreat into nature — and
the past. The town has some stunning historic buildings — including an
enormous Tudor mansion built in the early 1900s — but the real allure is
the quiet setting in the West Elk Mountains. For a truly Western experi-
ence, your best bet is Steamboat Springs, a bustling town that happily
blends recreation and ranching.
What’s Where? The Region 
and Its Major Attractions
You can have a lot of fun in this region if you set up a base camp in
Basalt, Glenwood Springs, or Carbondale and make short excursions to
area attractions (see the nearby map, “The Roaring Fork Valley”).

The Roaring Fork Valley
Aspen highlights
Aspen can be snooty, and its prices inspire awe, but at least you get
something in return. It has buildings that date to a mining boom in the
1880s and 1890s, it has culture to rival any town of its size in the West,
and it has wilderness to spare. Among its finest attractions are
 Four ski areas, including prime choices for beginners (Buttermilk),
intermediates (Snowmass), experts (Aspen Highlands), and
celebrities (Aspen Mountain).
 The Aspen Music Festival, a nine-week summer celebration and
school with up to six classical performances daily.
 Hiking and backpacking in the stunning Maroon Bells/Snowmass
Wilderness Area.

Glenwood Springs, Carbondale, 
and Redstone highlights
A popular resort since 1888, Glenwood Springs has some of the most
appealing family attractions in the state. Carbondale offers fine restau-
rants and inexpensive lodging near Aspen. And farther off the beaten
path, in the heart of the West Elk Mountains, hides Redstone, an unin-
corporated town that was once a Utopian community for coal miners.
When you’re in this area, don’t miss
 Hot Springs Pool, the largest public hot springs in the world
 Glenwood Caverns, where two newly opened rooms showcase
pristine, ornate limestone formations
 Redstone Castle, a 42-room, lavishly decorated mansion built 100
years ago by one of the world’s richest men, John Osgood
Aspen
Aspen has a lot going for it. It’s a historic mining community near stun-
ning wilderness. It has traditionally been home to some of the nation’s
finest skiers and mountaineers, including members of the 10th Mountain
Division, who helped develop the ski area on Aspen Mountain after
World War II. And since the 1940s, the town’s leaders have worked hard
to promote recreation, music, culture, and ideas — all of which exist in
spades in today’s Aspen.
Aspen remains fun, stimulating, and scenic, but don’t kid yourself: It isn’t
for everyone. Prices are high, traffic in and out of town can be heavy,
and the locals don’t always embrace the common folk.
If you’re a Hollywood producer or the permanently elected president of
a small Caribbean republic, you should plan a long vacation here. For
you, Aspen has designer shops, prestigious galleries, and some of the
finest restaurants in the nation. You can tip your mug in historic bar-
rooms where the locals really do get out and party. With four ski areas,
Aspen offers plenty of variety on the slopes, and the town’s luxury
hotels will treat you like royalty (probably because you are). If, how-
ever, you don’t have the do-re-mi or are just plain regular, you may 
need to consider basing yourself in a satellite town, such as Glenwood
Springs or Carbondale or Basalt. All have bus service to Aspen and 
offer lodging at a fraction of the cost. Plus, they’re pretty attractive
places themselves.
Chapter 20: Aspen and the Roaring Fork Valley 253

Getting to Aspen
Aspen is 172 miles west of Denver and 130 miles east of Grand Junction.
During winter and early spring, the only way to reach Aspen is by taking
Colorado 82 southeast for 42 miles from Glenwood Springs (on I-70). In
summer and early fall, you can sometimes shorten the trip from Denver
by about 40 miles — and dramatically raise the adventure level — by
taking Colorado 91 south to Leadville, continuing south for 17 miles on
U.S. 24, and then taking Colorado 82 east over Independence Pass 44
miles. This route stays closed until road crews clear the snow off 
12,094-foot Independence Pass in spring.
Don’t drive over Independence Pass during stormy weather or if you’re
tired. Though paved, this stretch of Colorado 82 has only one lane
(total) in places and some sobering drop-offs alongside it.
Aspen is far enough from Denver International Airport to make flying
closer a good idea. Two airports are within easy striking distance of
town. The closest is Aspen/Pitkin County Airport (% 970-920-5380;
www.aspenairport.com), 3 miles northwest of Aspen on Colorado 82.
United Express offers daily nonstop service from Denver to Aspen;
America West Express offers a similar service from Phoenix. During
winter, you can also fly to Aspen nonstop from Minneapolis/St. Paul on
Northwest Jet Airlink. Another option is to fly into Vail/Eagle County
Airport, 70 miles from Aspen on I-70 (see Chapter 19 for information on
this airport).
Many hotels offer complimentary ground transfers into town from Aspen/
Pitkin County Airport. If a transfer is unavailable, call High Mountain
Taxi (% 970-925-TAXI). Avis, Budget, Dollar, Hertz, and Thrifty all
have desks at Aspen/Pitkin County Airport. For information on contact-
ing individual airlines and car-rental agencies, see the appendix.
To catch a shuttle to Aspen from Eagle County Airport or Denver
International Airport, call Colorado Mountain Express (% 800-525-6363
or 970-926-9800; www.cmex.com). The one-way trip from Eagle County
costs $54 per person; from Denver, it’s $106.
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) trains stop at Glenwood
Springs Station (% 970-945-9563). In Glenwood Springs, you can rent a
car through Enterprise, 124 W. Sixth St. (% 970-945-8360), or Glenwood
Springs Ford-Lincoln-Mercury, 2222 Devereux Rd. (% 877-330-0030 or
970-384-2460). You can also catch a bus (operated by Roaring Fork
Transportation Authority) to Aspen; for more information on schedules
and fares, contact the Rubey Park Transit Center (% 970-925-8484;
www.rfta.com).
Getting around Aspen
In Aspen, ditch your car and walk or take the bus around this compact
city (see the nearby “Aspen” map). Free, regular shuttle buses serve

most popular destinations around Aspen. This includes Aspen Mountain,
Aspen Highlands, and Buttermilk ski areas. (Most of the time, rides to
Snowmass cost $3 for adults, $2 for kids ages 6 to 16, but during winter,
you can take a free skier shuttle during the day.) The local shuttles usu-
ally run from around 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. You can also catch rides to far-flung
locales such as Carbondale ($5 one-way), Glenwood Springs ($6), and
Rifle ($9). A lot of workers reach this parking-deprived community this
way. For the latest schedules and fares, stop by the Rubey Park Transit
Center (% 970-925-8484; www.rfta.com), on Durant Avenue between
Mill and Galena streets.
By taking the bus, you can avoid some of the parking challenges around
town. Though you can usually find a spot, you have to pay $1 an hour
for many downtown spots Monday through Saturday; in other areas, you
have to move the vehicle every two hours (or right when you start
having fun).
If you need a ride, call High Mountain Taxi (% 970-925-8294).
Where to stay in Aspen
Over the last 20 years, Aspen has gradually lost most of its affordable
lodging. As they opened, the town’s big, expensive hotels began sharply
discounting their rooms during slow periods, all but wiping out business
for the small, cheap motels. As a result, the so-called little guys have
closed shop, sold their land, and been replaced by newer and ever-more-
expensive hotels.
If you’re on a budget and don’t care when you see Aspen, come during
late spring and late fall, when you can stay in palatial digs for around
$100 a night.
Hotel Jerome
$$$$
Aspen
When he built the Hotel Jerome in 1889, the silver and retail magnate
Jerome Wheeler hoped it would rival the famous Ritz Hotel of Paris for
luxury. Wheeler seems to have started a trend in Aspen. Nowadays his
hotel isn’t the only opulent place in town, but it is the place if you want
your luxury in a historic setting. The hotel’s common areas feel more
authentic than the rooms do. As you wander these areas, you pass arched
hallways, an oak fireplace mantle, tiles colored with gold and cobalt, and
the hotel’s old paging system and front desk. The 91 guest rooms sport
the same feeling of newness as modern luxury units, only with Victorian
furniture and eccentric floor plans.

Limelite Lodge
$$–$$$$
Aspen
If you can afford the rates here, then you can vacation in downtown Aspen.
The inn, which has some of the cheapest prices in town, encompasses
three motel-style buildings. Don’t worry; none is a dump. Rooms are clean
and come with refrigerators; a few come with full kitchens. The inn serves
a free continental breakfast in a sunny lounge area. The lodge is within
walking distance of the gondola at Aspen Mountain.

The Little Nell
$$$$
Aspen
The Little Nell competes directly with The St. Regis for Aspen’s ultra-
wealthy clientele, but the two hotels have little in common other than
luxury. The Little Nell is considerably smaller and more intimate. Owned
by the Aspen Skiing Company, it’s right at the base of the gondola (which
is a short walk away for guests of the St. Regis). It welcomes dogs and even
has biscuits at the bell stand. And its rooms, each with a gas fireplace and
most with balconies, are generally larger than the ones at the St. Regis.
The hotel does not, however, have as many places that invite public loung-
ing, mingling, and star-gazing.

$$$$
Aspen
The St. Regis recently spent $12 million on new décor that one employee
described as “Colorado Ralph Lauren.” Loosely translated, that seems to
mean rocks, leather, wood, rawhide, earth tones, and a higher price tag
than “Colorado Wal-Mart.” This sprawling luxury hotel, which opens onto
splendid views of Aspen Mountain, has everything you’d expect for a small
fortune: a swimming pool, spa, health club, enormous bronze sculptures,
bellhops, views, a concierge, ultratrendy restaurants, and the occasional
celebrity sighting. You can even acquire your own ski butler — someone
who will tune your skis, warm your boots, and guide you around the hill.

Skiers Chalet
$$$–$$$$
Aspen
This budget motel lets you experience the trappings of the old Aspen. Built
in 1962 and decorated like a Swiss Chalet, the lodge is right next to the
remaining towers on the old Lift 1, which was Aspen’s first chairlift and
was once the longest lift in America. In the morning, you can easily walk
to a modern, functioning chairlift; when you’re done skiing, you can glide
back to the door. The motel has more character than the Limelite Lodge,
but its rooms are darker and older-feeling, and they get noisy when people
in ski boots clomp past on the wooden walkways. Ask for a room facing
the ski area. It doesn’t cost extra, and the views of the skiers and ski hill
are spectacular.

Where to dine in Aspen
Within a few square blocks in downtown Aspen are a half-dozen of
Colorado’s best restaurants — and some of the finest in America. Prices
are high, but many gourmet eateries have reasonably priced bar menus,
and other places offer early-evening and off-season specials. Choose
your spots carefully and you can dine well here without breaking the
bank. (Lodging presents the biggest financial challenge in Aspen.)

Cache Cache opened with just eight tables 17 years ago and has moved

area, you can take in the activity around you, study the black-and-white
photos of French street life, or simply enjoy the warm colors and candle-

chicken and duck. (Try the rabbit stew.) If you’re on a budget, order off
the bar menu, which consists entirely of meals costing $12.

Todd Slossberg. In recent years, Slossberg has twice been nominated by

as elk, lamb, and trout. The hotel describes proper attire as “Aspen
casual,” meaning anything from jeans to furs — and sometimes both.

Exploring Aspen
In Aspen, you can walk through Victorian neighborhoods left over from
the early 1890s, when Aspen was briefly the nation’s biggest silver pro-
ducer. You can attend more high-profile cultural events than in any other
mountain town; and you can also escape into some of the tallest and
most majestic peaks in the state. To get a well-balanced view of Aspen,
do your best to sample each of the town’s gifts.
Chapter 20: Aspen and the Roaring Fork Valley 259

The best things to see and do in Aspen
If you don’t feel like spending your day on Aspen’s trails, you may enjoy
 Getting the royal treatment. The 77,000-square-foot Aspen Club
and Spa, 1450 Crystal Lake Rd. (% 866-4VITALITY or 970-925-8900),
has everything you need to exhaust your muscles, including a swim-
ming pool, tennis courts, a large weight room, personal trainers,
and group fitness workouts. Afterwards, recover with a massage, a
healthy meal, or a treatment at the full-service spa. Three-day club
memberships cost $210. No membership is required for the spa.
 Mining for fun. If you reserve ahead, you can tour two Aspen-area
silver mines. One tour goes into the Smuggler Mine, 2 miles east of
town off Colorado 82, which produced the world’s largest silver
nugget (1,840 pounds) in 1894 — right after silver lost most of its
value. On this 90-minute tour (cost: $22 for adults, $16 for children
under 12), you walk 1,200 feet into the mine, usually with a former
miner. Tours are conducted by appointment only. Offered on
Saturdays during summer, the Compromise Mine Tour generates
more excitement. You’re picked up at your hotel, driven high up
Aspen Mountain to the mine entrance, and then are towed more
than 2,000 feet underground behind an electric mine-locomotive.
The tour takes two hours and costs $32 for adults, $22 for children
under 12. Children under 5 are not allowed on either tour. Call 
% 970-925-2049 for reservations for either tour.
 Visiting the low-rent district. From Memorial Day through Labor
Day, you can go on a guided tour of the mostly abandoned 1890s
mining town of Ashcroft, 14 miles southeast of Aspen on Castle
Creek Road. At 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. daily, one of the ghost town’s
caretakers will walk you through the eight remaining buildings,
including a saloon that’s been converted into a museum. The tour
costs $3 for ages 10 and over and lasts 20 to 30 minutes. You can
also visit the town on your own, free of charge. For more informa-
tion, call or visit Heritage Aspen: Aspen’s Historical Society, 620
W. Bleeker St. (% 970-925-3721; www.aspenhistory.org).
If you like Ashcroft, you’ll also enjoy the ghost town of
Independence, 17 miles east of Aspen on Colorado 82.
 Admiring art. Because Aspen brims with people who have an inor-
dinate amount of wall and floor space — and the means to fill it
with fine art — the town has more than 25 galleries, many of which
sell museum-quality pieces and even masterpieces. Published by
Aspen Magazine, the town’s Art Gallery Guide describes the current
galleries and has a map of where to find them. Don’t miss the Aspen
Art Museum, 590 N. Mill St. (% 970-925-8050), which brings world-
class art exhibitions to Aspen. The museum is open Tuesday through
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sunday from noon to 6 p.m.
Admission costs $3 for adults, $2 for students and seniors, 
and is free for kids under 12.

Staying active in Aspen
There are so many ways to pass a day in the mountains near Aspen, 
it’s hard to home in on just a few. The ones listed here are particularly
enjoyable:
 Cycling: Hardcore road cyclists should get up early, beat the traffic,
and attempt the 4,000-vertical-foot, 20-mile grind to 12,000-foot
Independence Pass. Other times, consider a more gradual 12-mile
climb up the length of the Maroon Creek Road, a valley-bottom
drive that’s closed to most motor vehicles from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
daily. If you’d rather avoid cars altogether, you can pedal on paved
bike trails throughout the Roaring Fork Valley. The mountain biking
is just as much fun — and even more extensive. To rent a bike 
and obtain area maps, go to Aspen Velo Bike Shop, 465 N. Mill St.
(% 970-925-1495).
 Golfing: At Aspen Golf Course, 1 mile west of Aspen on Colorado
82 (% 970-925-2145), greens fees are $80 for 18 holes, $45 for 9
holes, with sharply reduced rates late in the day.
 Hiking and backpacking: You can hike straight out of the downtown
area, but the most stunning scenery is deep inside the White River
National Forest, which encompasses the 161,000-acre Maroon
Bells/Snowmass Wilderness Area. For a fun day in the mountains,
visit the ghost town of Ashcroft and then hike the Cathedral Lake
Trail, located 15 miles southeast of Aspen off the Castle Creek Road.
The 2.7-mile (one-way) trail climbs 2,000 feet to a small lake. If you
want to hike near the two red-brown, pyramid-shaped peaks known
as Maroon Bells, take a bus ($5.50 adults, $3.50 ages 6 to 16) from
the Rubey Park Transit Center (% 970-925-8484; www.rfta.com)
to the end of Maroon Creek Drive and walk 1.8 miles to Crater
Lake. Backpackers and aggressive hikers sometimes forge onward
through the Snowmass/Maroon Bells Wilderness all the way to
Crested Butte. Most private vehicles are barred from Maroon Creek
Drive between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. You can, however, take the
Chapter 20: Aspen and the Roaring Fork Valley 261
Wintersköl
Maybe the best time to visit Aspen is the three days of Wintersköl, usually in the middle
of January. This community love-fest for the season that made it famous incorporates
events on all four of the ski mountains, and includes the Canine Fashion Show, the
Buttermilk Uphill Race, and the just-like-the-movies Ski Splash, where costumed skiers
aim for fame and court the sniffles by launching themselves into a pool of water. There
are also fireworks and a parade, but the highlight is definitely the Saturday-night tra-
dition of hundreds of skiers descending Aspen Mountain with torches, which looks
like a slow-motion cascade of glowing red lights. It’s one of my favorite events of the
entire year.

drive for a $10 fee between 7:00 and 8:30 a.m. and 5 and 7 p.m.
Backpackers and people with disabilities can always drive the road
after paying the $10. For maps and information visit the White River
National Forest Aspen Ranger District Office, 806 W. Hallam St.
(% 970-925-3445).
 Horseback riding: From May 1 through November 15, Aspen
Wilderness Outfitters (% 970-963-0211) keeps horses in stables at
Snowmass Village and offers rides ranging from one-hour strolls to
multiday trips. Prices start at $40 for one hour. Children under 7 are
not allowed.
Hitting the slopes
Lift tickets sold by Aspen/Snowmass (% 800-525-6200 or 970-925-1220;
www.aspensnowmass.com) are good at any of four mountains, linked by
a free shuttle system from downtown Aspen. In 2004–05, a high-season,
adult, all-day lift ticket cost $74. See the inside back cover for the techni-
cal lowdown on each resort.
 The low-key mountain for locals is Aspen Highlands, an area that
boasts some formidable expert terrain and one of the largest verti-
cal drops in the nation. Accessible only by hiking (sometimes with
assistance from a Sno-Cat that takes skiers partway to the top) and
inbounds at Aspen Highlands, Highland Bowl serves up long, pre-
carious, leg-burning descents, and it also affords stunning views of
14,156-foot Maroon Bells and other immense peaks. If you like
skiing steep, classic lines, you need to get to Highland Bowl.
 The main advantage to Aspen Mountain is its convenience to
Aspen’s chic downtown area. The Silver Queen Gondola climbs
3,267 vertical feet from the base area in town directly to the 11,212-
foot summit. Below the summit, the terrain consists mostly of
advanced and intermediate runs — including some steep mogul
runs — all of which seem to funnel into gullies brimming with
skiers who have a certain élan. If possible, ski this mountain with a
local who knows the hidden powder stashes and can steer you
away from those gullies. Also, keep in mind that Aspen Mountain
has just 673 acres — hardly a lot by Western standards.
 Buttermilk is a small area catering mostly to beginners. One of its
instructors described it as an assembly line churning out new
skiers. Former home to the X-Games, Buttermilk also has the
largest terrain park at the four resorts. It’s more than 2 miles long,
with a superpipe for snowboarders and 30 rails.
 With 3,010 acres of skiable terrain and the nation’s largest vertical
drop (4,406 feet), Snowmass is the second-largest ski area in the
state behind Vail. More than half of its runs are classified as “more
difficult” terrain, making Snowmass arguably the single most attrac-
tive resort in the state for intermediate skiers.

Shopping in Aspen
Aspen’s downtown area is ornamented by designer boutiques with one-
word names and cryptic window displays. Every so often the names
change, guaranteeing that shoppers can find the very latest of whatever
it is that these stores sell.
Meanwhile, at least two Aspen standbys keep doing a brisk business.
Since the mid-1970s, Curious George Collectibles, 426 E. Hyman Ave.
(% 970-925-3315), has traded well-preserved relics from the area’s
recent past — including antique belt buckles, chaps, guns, and native
American jewelry. And for over 25 years, Explore Booksellers, 211 E.
Main St. (% 970-925-5336), has carried a thought-provoking selection of
contemporary fiction and regional titles. Located in a small Victorian
home on Main Street, it has a vegetarian bistro upstairs.
Nightlife in Aspen
For an evening at a historic watering hole that has served cocktails since
1889, try the quietly sophisticated and western saloon–style J-Bar, inside
the Hotel Jerome, 330 E. Main St. (% 970-920-1000).
Among Aspen’s top nightspots, Syzygy, 520 E. Hyman Ave (% 970-925-
3700), ranks high with young, high-energy types who appreciate live jazz.
Bentley’s at the Wheeler, 328 Hyman Ave. (% 970-920-2240), is an ele-
gant English-style pub, good for the older crowd.
And if you want to visit one of the late Hunter S. Thompson’s haunts, go
to Woody Creek Tavern, 0002 Woody Creek Plaza (% 970-923-4585), in
Woody Creek.
Culture in Aspen
Aspen has been an oasis of culture ever since the 1940s, when an eminent
Chicago couple not only bankrolled the first chairlift on Aspen Mountain
but also established the Aspen Music Festival and the Aspen Center for
Humanistic Studies. Today, the town is particularly rich in classical music,
especially from mid-June to mid-August, when the Aspen Music Festival
and School (% 970-925-9042; www.aspenmusic.org) schedules as
many as six concerts a day at venues throughout town. The offerings
range from free student performances to recitals by virtuosos, for which
tickets may cost as much as $65.
Another notable festival is Jazz Aspen Snowmass (% 970-920-4996;
www.jazzaspen.com), which brings top jazz performers to Snowmass
Village during June. Herbie Hancock, Roy Hargrove, and Dr. John have
performed in recent years. Tickets cost $43 to $48.

Part IV: The High Country 
264
The Roaring Fork Valley
The Roaring Fork River wanders northwest from the Continental Divide
near Independence Pass to Glenwood Springs, where it empties into the
mighty Colorado River. On its way, the Roaring Fork collects water from
the Frying Pan River (at Basalt) and the Crystal River (at Carbondale),
creating a valley with some of the most spectacular landscapes (and
most costly real estate) in the West. As land in Aspen gets more expen-
sive and scarce, the valley has become a defacto suburb for Glitter
Gulch, but it has plenty of attractions in its own right: cool mountain
towns, glorious vistas, and some of the best trout fishing anywhere.
In the past few years, some of Aspen’s millionaires have relocated to the
less showy towns of Glenwood Springs and Carbondale, where they’re
now rubbing elbows with the people who used to wait on them. Each of
these towns has a lot going for it.

Fast Facts: Aspen

 Back when Aspen residents were still mining silver and not born
with it in their mouths, Glenwood Springs had already established
itself as a world-famous resort. It still has historic hotels, a thriving
shopping district, and the largest hot springs pool in the world.
 In the past hundred years or so, Carbondale profited from coal
mining, potato farming, railroads, ranching, and construction; each
industry left a mark on this curiously zoned community. The upshot
is that it really is a community. The townspeople, including many
artists and mountain athletes, gather on the town’s historic Main
Street, which seems relaxed even when most of the Roaring Fork
Valley crawls with people.
 Basalt has profited mightily from the skyrocketing prices of Aspen;
notable here is the Frying Pan River, world-renowned for its trout
fishing.
 The unincorporated community of Redstone is the smallest, most
remote, and prettiest of the four. Situated on the banks of the
Crystal River inside the White River National Forest, it was built
around 1900 as a Utopian town for coal miners. Across from a row
of historic brick coke ovens is the Craftsman-style Redstone Inn,
once a lodge for the unmarried miners. Redstone Castle, a Tudor
mansion where the mine’s owner once lived, sits atop a grassy hill
a mile up the road from the inn.
Getting there
Interstate 70, the Colorado River, and busy railroad tracks all rush down
the same corridor through the heart of Glenwood Springs. It’s 169 miles
west of Denver and 84 miles east of Grand Junction. Carbondale is 
12 miles southeast of Glenwood Springs via Colorado 82. Basalt is 
20 miles past Carbondale on 82, and Redstone is another 17 miles south
of Carbondale on Colorado 133. To reach Aspen from Carbondale, 
continue east for another 30 miles on Colorado 82.
Amtrak (% 800/872-7245; www.amtrak.com) trains stop twice daily in
Glenwood Springs Station (% 970-945-9563).
In Glenwood Springs, you can rent a car through Enterprise, 124 W. Sixth
St. (% 970-945-8360), or Glenwood Springs Ford, 2222 Devereux Rd.
(% 877-330-0030 or 970-384-2460).
If you want to fly closer than Denver International Airport, your best bet
is Vail/Eagle County Airport (% 970-524-9490; www.eaglecounty.us/
airport), 31 miles east of Glenwood Springs on I-70. See Chapter 19 for
information on flights and rental cars at that airport. You can arrange a
shuttle from Eagle County into Glenwood Springs (cost: $46.50) through
Colorado Mountain Express (% 800-525-6363 or 970-926-9800;
www.cmex.com).

Getting around
Many locals in Carbondale, Glenwood Springs, and Aspen use buses to
travel between towns. The Roaring Fork Transit Authority (% 970-925-
8484; www.rfta.com) serves all three communities, but not Redstone,
which has a year-round population of under 100, so you’ll have little
trouble getting around. To get to Aspen from Glenwood Springs, it costs
you $6 one way. Service runs from about 6 a.m. to midnight.
Inside Glenwood Springs proper, Ride Glenwood Springs offers bus
service between Wal-Mart, in the south part of town, and Roaring Fork
Marketplace at the town’s west end, for $2 per day. There’s ample park-
ing at the ends of town, so this service comes in handy when the down-
town lots fill up. The bus usually runs daily from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Call 
% 970-945-2575 to find out more about stops and schedules.
Where to stay
If you stay in Glenwood Springs or Carbondale when skiing Aspen, you
can choose between clean family-run motels, chain hotels, and historic
digs, usually for about $100 to $200 less per night than you’d pay for a
comparable spot in you-know-where. And you save on meals, too. As for
Redstone, it’s in its own universe, one that I’m dying to revisit soon. You
only have a few options there, but they’re good ones.

Glenwood Springs
Once one of America’s preeminent resorts, this 1889 hotel lost some of its
luster when it was converted to a Naval Hospital during World War II. (Its
size and proximity to a train station made it an ideal location.) Yet it still
has character, partly because of its perch on a hillside above Glenwood
Springs’s Hot Springs Pool, originally part of the hotel grounds. Styled after
an Italian palace, it also has courtyard gardens, two original fireplaces,
grand staircases, and a sunny sitting area. The rooms, which are clean and

Redstone Inn
$–$$$
Redstone
I love old Arts and Crafts–style lodges in remote locations, and the
Redstone Inn may be my favorite anywhere. It was built by steel and coal
baron John Osgood, who was the fifth richest man in America in the early
1900s. Osgood envisioned — or at least advertised — a Utopian commu-
nity for his coal miners. In 1904, the inn and the surrounding buildings
offered miners a theater, dining room, changing area, reading room, elec-
tricity, and hot and cold running water. The inn still has a four-sided clock
tower just like the ones in European mountain villages. Today, the miners
have been replaced by tourists who oversleep, swim, lift weights, play
tennis, hike, and fish — all this on or near the grounds of the inn. The prop-
erty also has two restaurants and a bar. During summer, the dining room
and guest rooms fill up far in advance, so be sure to reserve ahead. The inn
also manages tours of Osgood’s mansion, the nearby Redstone Castle.

advantage of ski packages that let you stay here and ski Aspen for just 
a few dollars more than the price of lift tickets. (Call the inn or visit the
inn’s Web site for information on ski packages.) All the rooms are pleas-
ant, but I prefer the upstairs ones, which were added in 1999 and still feel
brand-new.

Where to dine
Of the three communities, my favorite place to eat is Carbondale. It has
one exceptional restaurant and several good ones, and you can usually
find a table right away. Most Glenwood Springs restaurants don’t take
reservations, and they fill up fast on summer nights.

If you’re in Glenwood Springs during July, avoid eating during the 7 p.m.

Redstone Inn ahead of time, because you don’t have many dining
options in this community.

remind you that the beer wasn’t, in fact, brewed by Schlitz). And, as at the
other breweries, this one offers salads, sandwiches, pasta, steaks, and
some tasty brews. The unique selections here are the soups in bread
bowls. My favorite is the Wisconsin cheddar cheese beer soup, which
tastes just right after a day on the slopes, especially when washed down
with a Shoshone stout.
402 Seventh St. % 970-945-1276. Reservations for large groups only. Main courses:

Juicy Lucy’s
$$
Glenwood Springs
STEAKS AND SEAFOOD
Juicy Lucy’s is a rarity among Colorado’s upscale restaurants — a place
where you can picture in advance what your food is going to look like.
Entrees include grilled fresh Atlantic salmon, three lamb chops with mint
jelly, and chopped sirloin steak with mushroom gravy, as well as steaks of
different heft. Top it off with any of 22 wines available by the glass. You eat
in a pleasant, historic dining room with split-bamboo floors, copper light
fixtures, and a ceiling of molded plaster.

Sapphire Grill
$$
Glenwood Springs
ITALIAN GRILL
Because Sapphire Grill is in an inconspicuous upstairs spot, you can often
walk in and get a table when other Glenwood Springs restaurants are
jammed. Another plus is that the chef loves garlic. After eating the bulb of
roasted garlic that comes with your home-baked bread, order the escargot
in garlic butter as an appetizer. Follow it with linguine with spicy garlic
shrimp sauce. The Sapphire also serves grilled steaks, salmon, and pork
chops, as well as a popular rack of ribs. The dessert list, entirely garlic
free, includes homemade tiramisu and crème brûlée.

Six89 Main Kitchen and Wine Bar
$$$
Carbondale
WORLD CUISINE
In 2002, the chef here cooked a meal at the James Beard House in New
York, putting this Carbondale eatery in the ranks of America’s finest. Yet
the place still feels easygoing. Servers in loose-fitting, patterned shirts
deliver delicacies such as herb-crusted chicken and apricot-mustard bar-
beque pork tenderloin without fanfare. The restaurant’s sommelier, who
loves to fly-fish, offers tips on wines as casually as he may discuss lures
during off-hours. On clear summer nights, the patio opens and seating dou-
bles, so you can sometimes walk right in and get a table.

Carbondale
ECLECTIC
Since 1975, the Village Smithy has been Carbondale’s spot to enjoy an
extended breakfast. Its omelets, pancakes, smoothies, and sunny patio
seating have probably cut into the town’s productivity, but no one around
here seems to mind. At lunch, the restaurant serves big salads, soups,
sandwiches, and South-of-the-Border fare. You can eat in an old black-
smith’s shop or on the patio, which stays open, thanks to the miracles
known as space heaters, even during winter.

PIZZA, PASTA, AND BARBEQUE
Despite having an Italian version of Uncle Sam on its menu, the White
House seems to belong in New England more than it does in Washington,
D.C., Italy, or, for that matter, Colorado. Its low ceilings, intimate barroom,
and friendly servers call to mind those East Coast village taverns where
everyone thinks they know your name. A locals’ favorite in Carbondale,
the White House serves above-average pizzas and calzones. Its wine list
consists entirely of $10, $12, and $16 bottles.

seafood, beef, pork, and chicken. In the dining room, masks and festival

Exploring Glenwood Springs, 
Carbondale, and Redstone
Glenwood Springs has endless activities for families. Redstone is an
attraction unto itself, especially for historians looking for well-preserved
relics from the early 1900s. And Carbondale is the place to get away from
tourist attractions, relax, and enjoy being in the mountains.
The best things to see and do
In the Hot Springs Pool, Glenwood Springs has one of the best kid-
friendly attractions in Colorado. If you’re hurtling down I-70 past
Glenwood Springs, make sure to get off the freeway and soak.
Glenwood Caverns
On this tour, you ride a bus up a winding road onto a hillside high above
Glenwood Springs and then go deep inside mountain caves. Some of these
caverns opened as a tourist attraction known as Fairy Caves in the late
1800s and early 1900s. The operation closed in 1917, and reopened in 1998.
The two-hour family tours visit the original Fairy Caves, where many for-
mations have been damaged, and then continue on into two newly opened
rooms with nearly pristine formations. These rooms, known as The Barn
(for its size, the second largest in Colorado) and Kings Row (for its per-
fectly preserved stalactites and stalagmites) make this tour a winner. The
family tour requires participants to climb 100 stairs, but the three- to four-
hour Wild Tour is even harder. It requires you to wear a headlamp and
crawl on your hands, knees, and belly in order to squeeze into caves far off
the beaten path. It’s an unforgettable adventure for families with teenagers.
508 Pine St., Glenwood Springs. % 800-530-1635 or 970-945-4CAV. www.glenwood
caverns.com. Family-tour admission: $17 adults, $12 children 3–12, under 3 free.
Wild Tours: $50 per person; you must be 13 or older to go. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–4 p.m.
in May; daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. June–Oct.
Hot Springs Pool
At Glenwood Springs’s famous Hot Springs Pool, the natural hot spring
pools are so huge and hold so many people, that it can take a while to get
used to the sheer mass — and believe me, I mean mass — of humanity. But
you can still have fun. You can swim in a 400-by-100-foot, 90-degree pool,
which has lap lanes and diving boards, or soak in a 100-by-100-foot therapy
tub, kept at around 104 degrees. Two 300-foot-long waterslides spin you
and then send you skittering across a watery run-out. My favorite time to
Part IV: The High Country 
270

soak is on winter nights, when you can watch the steam rise in something
like solitude. As for the pool’s history, the Ute Indians once soaked here,
but the first official pool was built in 1888.
401 N. River Road, Glenwood Springs. % 800-537-SWIM or 970-945-6571. www.hot
springspool.com. Admission: Summer $13.50 adults, $8.50 children 3–12; rest of
year $11.50 adults, $7.50 children 3–12. Open: 7:30 a.m.–10 p.m. in summer, 9 a.m.–
10 p.m. rest of year. Closed several days each year for maintenance; call for dates.
Yampah Spa and Vapor Caves
Like the nearby Hot Springs Pool, the vapor caves are fed by 125-degree
geothermal springs. Instead of soaking, however, you descend into rock-
walled rooms sculpted out of actual caves, sit on marble benches, and
inhale the steamy air, which is hottest in the rooms farthest underground.
The caves’ detractors find the rooms, the air, and the company all a bit
too close. But if you enjoy steam baths, you’ll love this place. For over a
century, a variety of cures and treatments have been offered in the build-
ing above the caves, and today a modern spa sells massages, facials, and
wraps.
709 E. Sixth St., Glenwood Springs. % 970-945-0667. www.yampahspa.com. Vapor-
cave admission: $12 (includes one towel); 2-day pass $19.50. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–9 p.m.
Staying active
Four rivers that flow from towering peaks all meet in this area, providing
great boating and fishing. If the water doesn’t keep you entertained, you
can always climb high into the mountains.
 Fishing: The Crystal River passes through Redstone and then emp-
ties into the Roaring Fork River near Carbondale. The Roaring Fork,
in turn, drains into the Colorado River near Glenwood Springs. All
have their share of trout, but you have to make sure not to trespass
when you go after them. To find out the rules, contact the Colorado
Division of Wildlife, 50633 U.S. 6 and 24, Glenwood Springs (% 970-
947-2920). The Taylor Creek Fly Shop, 183 Basalt Center Cir., Basalt
(% 970-927-4374), can set you up with tackle and guide you to the
best waters.
 Biking and hiking: The Glenwood Springs Chamber Resort
Association, 1102 Grand Ave., publishes a free Trails Guide to the
Glenwood Springs area. Your options include long Forest Service
roads, narrow mountain paths, and the 16-mile, paved Glenwood
Canyon Path, which has stretches right alongside I-70 but also
branches off and follows the Colorado River. You can bike up the
Glenwood Canyon Path starting at the east end of Sixth Avenue,
right next to Yampah Vapor Caves in Glenwood Springs. Because of
the proximity to the freeway, it’s a better choice for cyclists than
for hikers. If you want to take a quick hike or ride in Carbondale,
park your car in the lot north of the intersection of Colorado 133
and Colorado 82. The trailhead for the Red Hill System is about a
quarter-mile up the obvious dirt road, on your left. It’s less than a
Chapter 20: Aspen and the Roaring Fork Valley 271

half-mile from the trailhead to Mushroom Rock, which has views of
the surrounding valley. You can go farther by completing one of
several possible loops through the area, on trails that are equally
popular among hikers, advanced mountain bikers, and dogs.
The White River National Forest Supervisor’s Office, 900 Grand
Ave., Glenwood Springs (% 970-945-2521), oversees seven wilder-
ness areas, including the nearby Maroon Bells–Snowmass wilder-
ness. The office can provide maps and information on the area
hikes as well as on the forest trails near Redstone.
 Golfing: The Ranch at Roaring Fork, at 14913 Highway 82,
Carbondale (% 970-963-3500), has the cheapest greens fees in the
Roaring Fork Valley: $15 for 9 holes. Glenwood Springs Golf Club,
0193 Sunny Acres Rd., West Glenwood Springs (% 970-945-7086),
charges $19 for 9 holes, $29 for 18. Many other courses in the valley
are private, with greens fees running up to $250.
 Rafting: Local raft companies offer half- and full-day trips on the
Roaring Fork and Colorado rivers. In this area, neither river makes
for a scary trip, but each has enough whitewater to entertain an
average American family. Whitewater Rafting, 2000 Devereux Rd.,
Glenwood Springs (% 800-993-7238 or 970-945-8477; www.colorado
whitewaterrafting.com), can set up a trip for you.
Hitting the slopes
It’s hard not to like small ski areas such as Sunlight Mountain Resort —
places with dirt parking lots, roaming dogs, and base areas that seem to
belong on That ’70s Show.
A few of the advantages to Sunlight (% 800-445-7931 or 970-945-7491;
www.sunlightmtn.com) are: A $36 lift ticket, the cheapest in Colorado;
equally cheap digs in nearby Glenwood Springs; and free rides (check
for the schedule) to and from town in Sunlight’s colorfully painted
school bus. The ski instructors and the lift attendants greet each other
by name, and they’ll probably greet you, too. Sunlight’s 460 acres
include some serious steeps, challenging glades, and an abundance of
intermediate runs. Best of all, Sunlight bundles its vacation packages
with the world-famous Hot Springs Pool in Glenwood Springs, so that
après-ski soaking is included in the cost. If this mountain doesn’t relax
you, the springs will. If you want to look at the technical data for the
resort, see the inside back cover.
Shopping
Carbondale’s Main Street has some fun boutiques and galleries. Make sure
you stop at Kahhak Fine Arts and School, 411 Main St. (% 970-704-0622).
The school’s proprietor, Majid Kahhak, uses the same studio to teach,
create, and sell spontaneous art he calls essence painting.

Glenwood Springs has a thriving shopping district along Grand Avenue,
just south of the bridge over the Colorado River. One worthwhile stop:
Summit Canyon Mountaineering, 732 Grand Ave. (% 800-360-6994),
which sells gear, clothing, coffee, books, and maps.
Redstone has a number of small galleries and boutiques, some of which
are in historic cottages once reserved for miners.
Nightlife
A quarter-century ago, the Black Nugget, 403 Main St., Carbondale 
(% 970-963-4498), was a notoriously rough bar that catered mostly to
coal miners. Today, it’s a friendly locals’ hangout, with live music
Wednesday through Saturday nights year-round. Smoking is allowed
only in a back room. In Glenwood Springs, head for the Glenwood
Canyon Brewing Company, 402 Seventh St. (% 970-945-1276), which I
review in the “Where to dine” section earlier in this chapter.
Fast Facts: The Roaring Fork Valley

Chapter 21
Steamboat Springs
In This Chapter
 Discovering the town and resort of Steamboat Springs
 Cowpoking at some classic western Dude ranches
T
ourism has long since overtaken ranching as the top industry in and
around Steamboat Springs, and new developments continue to crop
up on subdivided ranchland. Yet the town still values its cows and cow-
boys. The town, which markets itself as “Ski Town, USA,” has always
been as proud of its Western hospitality as it is of the many skiers it has
sent to the Winter Olympics.
Of course, it’s not a perfect marriage. The area has two different neighbor-
hoods, each with its own personality. The base area of Steamboat Ski
Area feels like a modern-day, megaski area such as Vail, with immense
hotels, fine restaurants, expensive boutiques, and homes the size of air-
port terminals. A few miles northwest of the ski area, along U.S. 40,
sprawls the redbrick Western town of Steamboat Springs. Here, bike
shops and microbreweries share the main drag with Western stores
such as F.M. Light and Soda Creek Outfitters. Next to a skate park, across
from a network of mountain-bike trails, there’s a historic rodeo ground.
This older part of town is my favorite — it’s a place where a visitor can
enjoy the best of both the old and the new West.
Getting There
Steamboat Springs is 158 miles northwest of Denver, 194 miles east of
Grand Junction, and 335 miles east of Salt Lake City. If you’re driving from
Denver, take I-70 68 miles west to Silverthorne, then take Colorado 9 
38 miles north to Kremmling. In Kremmling, turn west on U.S. 40 and go
52 miles to Steamboat Springs. If you’re coming from the west on I-70,
exit at Rifle and go 88 miles north on Colorado 13 to Craig. In Craig, 
head east on U.S. 40 for 42 miles to Steamboat Springs. Coming from 
the northwest, you can take I-40 all the way from Park City, Utah, to
Steamboat, a distance of about 300 miles.
During winter, Yampa Valley Regional Airport (% 970-276-3669), 
25 miles west of Steamboat Springs off of U.S. 40 (near Hayden), has

daily nonstop service to Denver (on United Express), Dallas-Fort Worth
(American), Houston (Continental), Minneapolis-St. Paul (Northwest),
Chicago (American), and Newark (Continental).
Upon landing, you can rent a car through Avis or Hertz. For information
on contacting individual airlines and car-rental agencies, see the appen-
dix. Alpine Taxi (% 800-343-7433 or 970-879-2800) offers round-trip
($44 per adult) and one-way ($27 per adult) shuttle service between the
airport and Steamboat Springs. Call ahead for a reservation.
Getting Around
Steamboat Springs Transit (% 970-879-3717) provides free bus service
between Steamboat Springs and Steamboat Ski Area. The buses run every
20 minutes during peak hours. From mid-April to mid-December, the
buses run from 7 a.m. to 10:45 p.m. The hours are even longer during the
ski season.
If you miss the last bus, call Alpine Taxi (% 800-343-7433 or
970-879-2800) for a lift.
Steamboat Springs is easy to figure out (see the nearby map, “Steamboat
Springs”). Most of the activity is along Lincoln Avenue, a stretch of 
U.S. 40. Lincoln Avenue runs northwest and southeast through town,
paralleling the Yampa River, which borders the town on the southwest
side. A series of numbered streets (3rd through 13th) cross U.S. 40, with
the highest numbers being farthest north and west. Across the Yampa
River from the downtown area are the town’s rodeo grounds, skate park,
and softball fields, as well as the historic Howelsen Hill Ski Area.
About 2 miles southeast of downtown, around the base of the ski area,
developments feature hotels, condos, luxury homes, and shopping plazas.
Most of the buildings are larger and newer than the ones downtown. To
reach the ski area base, go about 2 miles southeast of downtown on U.S.
40, then turn east on Mount Werner Road and follow the signs.
Where to Stay
You can save by staying in Steamboat Springs’s downtown area and
taking the free shuttle to the mountain. On the outskirts of town along
U.S. 40 are newer, chain hotels. The downtown has older but well-
maintained motels. I like the downtown area’s Western feel and reason-
able prices. Bear in mind, however, that a motel along U.S. 40 in down-
town Steamboat is hardly a retreat to nature. The highway was built
extra-wide to accommodate cattle drives, and it holds a lot of traffic 
at times. The largest, most luxurious hotels are clustered around the
base of the mountain.

Mountain Village
This ski-in, ski-out hotel at the base of Steamboat Mountain predates the
days when luxury hotels dominated the base areas of ski resorts. Built in
1969 (with an addition in 1979), it could as easily be alongside Interstate
80 in Illinois as at Steamboat Ski Area. The smallish basic rooms have gray
and tan furnishings. An elevator connects the four levels, but most people
just use the stairs. You don’t have to dodge any bellhops. (Sometimes,
when you ring the front-desk bell, no one hops, period.) But you can ski
straight into and out of the hotel, get free newspapers and Internet access,
and eat reasonably priced fare at the hotel restaurant. It’s cool.

When I asked the front-desk person about this motel’s age, she shrugged,
said she didn’t care and instead offered me a beer. It was the kind of pret-
zel logic that makes guidebook-writing fun — and dangerous. As it turned
out, this lodge, in downtown Steamboat Springs, was built in 1960 but fully
refurbished in 2001. Most of the lodge is one story in height, so you can
usually lug your belongings straight into your room. The room itself will be
clean and comfy, with a small refrigerator and microwave. It will also be
convenient to downtown restaurants and shops.

rooms and suites, the Grand is as big as its name and offers more than its
share of luxuries, including two restaurants, a fitness center, a spa, a swim-
ming pool, concierge services, and an ardent crew of bellhops.
Accommodations start with Deluxe Parlor rooms, each with a full kitchen,
dining area, and queen-size sofa sleeper. One caveat: The walls are thin
and the noise level pretty high for a hotel in this price range.

Where to Dine
Steamboat has more than a few first-rate restaurants and many others
providing tasty food at reasonable prices. There are more choices down-
town, but my two favorites are at the base of the ski area.
Part IV: The High Country

Ranch life
To fully experience Steamboat culture, consider spending some time at a ranch. You
can choose among several different experiences, which appeal to different types of
vacationers. Choose the one that best fits your style.
Independent types, who prefer to use a ranch as a home base, should head for Dutch
Creek Guest Ranch at Steamboat Lake, 25 miles northwest of Steamboat Springs on
Colorado 62 (% 800-778-8519 or 970-879-8519; www.dutchcreek.net). This guest
ranch offers accommodations in log cabins or A-frames — both have kitchens — and
you’re free to enjoy your days as you please. You can try your hand at horseback riding
(for an additional fee), Ping-Pong, and horseshoes, or curl up by a fire with some hot
cocoa and a copy of Colorado & the Rockies For Dummies. Rates, which include break-
fast, for the more desirable log cabins run $150 to $175; the A-frames cost $105 to $130.
If you prefer an all-inclusive experience, try the Home Ranch, 54880 County Rd. 129
(% 970-879-1780; www.homeranch.com). In summer and fall, you have to decide
between guided hiking, fly-fishing, or horseback riding. Later on, you can soothe your
aching muscles in the pool, sauna, or hot tub. The lodge schedules lots of kids’ activ-
ities, so you can leave the young ones behind — or not. And after the family-style
dinner, join a campfire sing-along or adjourn to your luxuriously appointed room.
Accommodations are in cabins and lodge rooms, and prices vary according to how
large and luxurious your digs are, but no matter what you choose, you’re going to pay
big bucks. Prices drop in winter, when you shell out only for your room and your break-
fast. Summer and fall double-occupancy rates for seven nights run $4,780 to $5,640;
add $1,785 for each additional person. Winter nightly double-occupancy rates (two-
night minimum stay required) run from $400 to $500, plus $175 per night for each addi-
tional person.
For a true working vacation, head for Saddleback Ranch, 37350 County Rd. 179 
(% 970-879-3711; www.saddlebackranch.net). You can’t stay overnight at this
7,000-acre working cattle ranch, but you’re welcome to help out with chores. From
June through mid-September, you can help round up, move, and tend the ranch’s 800
mother cows. Mostly, however, you just ride alongside the cowboys and watch them
work. Each ride lasts about four hours, and kids have to be at least 8 years old to go
along. Come evening, you can also go for a 11⁄2-hour dinner ride, capped off with a meal
of chicken, steak, or fish. The cattle drive costs $65 per adult, $60 per child; a dinner
ride is $49 adults, $39 per child.

Don’t feel like driving to Idaho Springs (see Chapter 12) for Colorado’s best
après-ski pizza? Don’t! Just head over to this new location and find all Beau
Jo’s crazy toppings, piled high. All the normal pizza toppings are here, plus
some exotic ones; soups and salads are also featured. Remember to save
your crusts; that bottle of honey on the table is for drizzling over the rich
homemade dough and eating as a prelude to (or replacement for) dessert.
The beer list is excellent.

Every night, Café Diva’s small staff creates a special experience for diners
near the base of Steamboat Ski Area. Both owners are sommeliers, and the
chef came here from one of Manhattan’s hottest restaurants. Together,
they’ve created the best all-around dining experience in Steamboat Springs.
The menu changes seasonally, but you can always order a few standbys.
Start with crab and tomato bisque, then, for an appetizer, get the Cajun
crab cakes in Creole remoulade. Finish with the elk tenderloin and roasted-
garlic mashed potatoes in veal brown sauce. The experience is especially
nice in summer, when you can dine on a patio with mountain views.

AMERICAN/ECLECTIC
Creekside Cafe serves three meals most days, but I come here in the morn-

Creekside serves eight variations on the dish, ranging from traditional
(poached eggs, English muffin, hollandaise sauce, and black forest ham) to
Yampa (with smoked trout and tomatoes instead of ham). The staff can be
distracted, the coffee is strong, and the creek-side patio gets just the right
amount of sunlight. In other words, this is the perfect ski-town breakfast
joint. At lunch, the Creekside switches to a diverse menu that includes
falafels, gyros, sandwiches, wraps, burgers, and salads. The dinner menu
consists mostly of pasta dishes.

It’s easy to see why this is one of the most acclaimed Southwestern restau-

heat across the bar patrons and wafting the scent of warm dough through-
out the restaurant. One dining room has immense prints of nature photo-
graphs taken by the owner; the other room displays masks and traditional
Mexican art. It’s worth a trip here just to dip a fresh tortilla chip in the
tomatillo-and-avocado salsa. The menu has Tex-Mex dishes and fajitas, but
there are also creative, gourmet entrees such as coriander tofu with
toasted quinoa in black-bean reduction sauce, and grilled elk loin with a
cilantro pesto crust.

items. Not to be outdone, the menu features everything from peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches to salciccia Ricardo (red and green bell peppers
roasted in olive oil and garlic with Italian sausage and served over fresh fet-
tuccini). You can also buy several flavors of dog food, but only if you and
your four-legged friend are on the patio. Best of all, Slopeside offers 11
kinds of handmade pizza for under $10 each, and it keeps serving those
pizzas at reduced prices after 10 p.m. in winter, 9 p.m. in summer.

Exploring Steamboat Springs
The Yampa Valley has over 150 hot springs, produced by geothermal
activity. In Steamboat, soak in the springs first and then figure out the
rest of your itinerary — if there is a rest of your itinerary. Later on, time
permitting, you can shop, absorb history, ride a horse, or pursue almost
any kind of recreation known to man (or woman!).
The best things to see and do
First get the soaking out of the way. You can
 Soak and exercise. Kids love the Steamboat Springs Health and
Recreation Center (% 970-879-1828), where the waters are perfect
for kinetic young people and adults pursuing active lifestyles.
Part IV: The High Country 
280

Located at the east end of town on Lincoln Avenue, this community
hub has hot mineral pools (98°–102°), an 82-degree lap pool, a
wading pool, and a waterslide, not to mention a weight room, tennis
courts, snack bar, and playground. The springs stay open year-round
even though they’re outdoors. They’re open Monday through Friday
from 5:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 
9 p.m. Admission costs $7.50 adults; $5 students 13 to 17; $3.50 kids
3 to 12 and seniors over 61. The waterslide costs $5 for ten rides, $3
for five rides.
 Soak and — what’s exercise? The Strawberry Park Hot Springs
(% 970-879-0342; www.strawberryhotsprings.com) have little in
common with the Health and Recreation Center. Privately owned,
they’re in a remote, forested canyon and cater mostly to adults
who like sitting still in beautiful places. The park has four terraced
rock pools, each fed by a mixture of 147-degree mineral water and
icy creek water. After sunset, kids are no longer allowed, and the
adults may remove their suits. The place is informal: You buy your
tickets outside and change in a tipi. There are no lights, so a small
flashlight comes in handy after dark. You can camp here or rent a
rustic cabin. The road to the springs is rough and often unsuitable
for two-wheel-drive vehicles. Call the springs before attempting 
the drive in winter, no matter what you’re driving, but don’t pass
up a chance to soak here. It’s located 7 miles north of town at the
end of County Road 36. (Turn east on Seventh Street and follow the
signs.) Weekdays before 5 p.m. it costs $5 for adults, $3 for children
under 18. Weekdays after 5 p.m., weekends, and holidays it costs
$10 for adults, $5 for kids under 18. It’s open daily from 10:00 a.m.
to 10:30 p.m.
Other things to see and do
When you’re done soaking, you can further stimulate your senses by
 Hitting the rodeo. You can immerse yourself in cowboy culture at
the pro rodeos held every Friday and Saturday night from mid-June
through August at Romick Arena. The arena is at the base of
Howelsen Hill, on the opposite side of the Yampa River from down-
town Steamboat Springs. (Use Fifth Street to cross the river.) Live
country music kicks off the festivities at 6 p.m., followed by the
rodeo, including bull riding, at 7:30 p.m. The cost is $11 for adults,
$6 for ages 7 to15, with kids 6 and under free. Call % 970-879-0880
to find out more.
 Treading through the past. The Tread of Pioneers Museum,
800 Oak St. (% 970-879-2214), has the usual artifacts from Victorian
life, some of which are displayed in a 1908 Queen Anne–style home.
It also has some stunning historic photographs of Native Americans,
an exhibit on skiing in Steamboat, and a videotape of a historic
hotel burning down. Cost is $5 for adults, $4 for seniors over 62,
and $1 for children under 12. It’s open Tuesday through Saturday
from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Chapter 21: Steamboat Springs 281

Especially for kids
A few places in Steamboat are especially fun for kids:
 During summer at Howelsen Hill, 845 Howelsen Parkway (% 970-
871-1104), you can ride a chairlift and then descend 400 vertical
feet on the Alpine Slide. Howelsen Hill is located across the Yampa
River from downtown Steamboat Springs, via Fifth Street. One ride
costs $8 for ages 13 and over, $7 for children 7 to12, and $1 for chil-
dren 3 to 6. It’s open June through September on weekdays from 
11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and weekends from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 A short walk from the alpine slide, check out the town’s skate park
next to Howelsen Hill and the rodeo grounds. It’s free and open to
the public.
 At the base of Steamboat Ski Area (% 970-871-5252), you (or your
kids) can dangle from bungee cords while bouncing on the trampo-
line. The setup allows people to safely flip, and flip, and flip. The
cost is $6 for two minutes. There’s also a climbing wall (two climbs
for $6).
Staying active
Steamboat may not have the “best” ski area, the “best” mountain biking,
the “best” fishing, or the “best” whitewater, but if you want a well-rounded
recreation scene, it may be, well, the best. No matter what you want to
do, Steamboat has something for you. While you’re here, think about:
 Boating: During years when a lot of snow has fallen, the Yampa
River and its tributaries offer some of the most turbulent whitewa-
ter in North America. Even if your boat is a half-inflated car inner
tube, you’re still in luck — certain stretches of the Yampa are so
mellow and civilized, you could call AAA to fix a flat. One prime
tubing zone starts right in downtown Steamboat Springs. To float
the Yampa through town, go to Backdoor Sports, at the corner of
Ninth and Yampa (% 970-879-6249). Rent a tube for $12; and start
your 2-mile float trip down the river right there. For people who are
more serious about the water, Backdoor Sports also gives six-hour
kayak lessons for $90, after which you’ll be ready to float some of
the milder whitewater.
 Golfing: Picture a golf course with bottomless bunkers, rolling 
fairways, thick roughs, and lots of water. If the course you imagine
is in Scotland and not in hell, then you should go play a round at
Haymaker, 32500 U.S. 40 (% 970-870-1846). Modeled after top
Scottish courses, the 18 holes are surrounded by undeveloped
land, making the experience even more pure. Greens fees are $79
from June 8 through September 22, $54 after 4:30 p.m. The rest of
the season, 18 holes cost $54 at all times. There’s also a driving
range on the premises.
Part IV: The High Country 
282

 Hiking: On Steamboat Ski Area, your basic easy-to-find hiking trail
is the Thunderhead Trail, which starts near the base of the Silver
Bullet Gondola and climbs 2,180 feet over 3 miles to its terminus at
the upper gondola station. The uppermost portions, which skirt
rock outcroppings and drift through aspen groves flecked with
wildflowers, are the most scenic. To save energy, you can ride the
gondola up (cost: $15 adults, $10 kids 13 to 17, and $6 kids 5 to 12)
and then hike down.
The most stunning trails near town are at Fish Creek Falls (% 970-
879-1870). For a short hike and picnic, walk 1⁄8 mile to the falls over-
look, where you can sit at picnic tables and watch the falls thunder
165 feet downhill through a mossy gorge. To get closer to the water,
take the lower trail (as opposed to the one to the overlook) 1⁄4 mile
to the base of the falls. You can continue hiking on this trail and
make a 21⁄2-mile (one-way), 1,600-vertical-foot ascent to Upper Fish
Creek Falls. The trailheads start 4 miles east of town on County
Road 32, inside the Routt National Forest. Cost is $3 per vehicle.
Serious hikers and backpackers should drive north of Steamboat
Springs and to the edge of the Mount Zerkel Wilderness Area,
which encompasses parts of the Sawtooth, Park, and Sierra Madre
mountain ranges. For more information and maps of this area, go to
the Medicine Bow–Routt National Forest Office, 925 Weiss Dr.,
Steamboat Springs (% 970-879-1870).
 Horseback riding: A number of area ranches offer horseback riding.
If you want to ride in a pretty spot at the edge of Steamboat Springs,
head for Sombrero Ranches. Located next to the rodeo grounds at
the base of Howelsen Hill, Sombrero Ranches offers one-hour ($25)
and two-hour ($40) rides on Emerald Mountain, as well as breakfast
($40) and dinner ($45) excursions by reservation only. Call % 970-
879-2306 for more information, or go right to the stables by cross-
ing the river at Fifth Street.
 Mountain biking: You can access Steamboat Ski Area’s 50-mile
trail system near the base of the Silver Bullet Gondola, or you can
start 2,180 feet higher up by riding the gondola (cost: $23 adults,
$18 kids 13 to 17, and $14 kids 5 to 12). You can pick up a map of
the trails at the base of the resort. There’s also prime riding on
Emerald Mountain, across the Yampa River from the downtown
area. Cross the river at 13th Street, then look for the single track
trail. The single track meets a rugged road that climbs steadily for
1,550 vertical feet over 3 miles to the top of 8,250-foot Quarry
Mountain. This area is warmer than Steamboat Ski Area, so con-
sider hitting it in early morning or late afternoon. The staff at Sore
Saddle Cyclery, 1136 Yampa St. (% 970-879-1675), rents mountain
bikes ($35 per day) and town bikes ($15 per day) and can tell you
more about area trails. Sore Saddle also sells state-of-the-art titanium
bike frames made locally by Moots Cycles (% 970-879-1676).
Chapter 21: Steamboat Springs 283

Hitting the slopes
Like the town of Steamboat Springs, Steamboat Ski Area (% 970-879-
6111; www.steamboat.com) prides itself on being friendly. Former
Olympic medalist Billy Kidd, now the resort’s Director of Skiing, often
guides complimentary mountain tours, and Nelson Carmichael, the
bronze medalist in mogul skiing in the 1992 Winter Games, schedules
free bump-skiing clinics for the public. As for the terrain, Steamboat’s
2,939 acres make it the third largest area in the state, behind Vail and
Snowmass. The 20 lifts efficiently move skiers, and the 142 trails tend to
follow fall-line paths down the four linked mountains. More than half the
runs are designated as intermediate, so mid-level skiers will relish being
here. Advanced skiers will love threading their way through the moun-
tain’s seemingly endless aspen glades, which become especially enticing
after the resort receives some of its famous dry powder. Beginners have
fewer options, since only 13 percent of the terrain is for novices. Still,
this is easily one of the top ski areas in the state.
More than 50 Olympians have trained at Howelsen Hill Ski Area (% 970-
879-4300), a winter sports center in Steamboat Springs. At 90 years and
counting, this is the oldest continuously operating ski area in Colorado,
good for a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Most visi-
tors come here for the night skiing, but Howelsen Hill also has ski jumps,
Nordic trails, and a half-pipe course for snowboarders. The hill hosts
about 75 competitions every winter. On most days, it’s also open to the
public. By Western standards, it’s puny — come here for the night skiing,
the Nordic trails, or the history. If none of these attracts you, you’re
better off at Steamboat Ski Area.
For more about both of these resorts, check out the inside back cover.
Shopping
F.M. Light & Sons, 830 Lincoln Ave. (% 970-879-1822), has sold Western
clothing in Steamboat since 1905. The store has a huge selection of Lee
and Wrangler jeans, Stetson hats, and cowboy boots, plus knives, oiled
coats, and even stick horses. Soda Creek Outfitters, 335 Lincoln Ave.
(% 970-879-3146), has Western goods that, if anything, are more tradi-
tional than the selections at F.M. Light. If, for whatever reason, you ever
wanted chaps, spurs, or a new (or used) lasso, this is the store for you.
Nightlife and culture
Slopeside Grill (% 970-879-2916), across from the Sheraton in Ski Time
Square, serves gourmet pizzas at discounted rates after 10 p.m. Slopeside
also offers live entertainment every afternoon during ski season and on
Sunday afternoons in the summer.
Not far away is the town’s hottest club, Level’z, 1860 Ski Time Square

Gunnison, Crested Butte,
and the Black Canyon
In This Chapter
 Finding great skiing and even better mountain biking
 Visiting the darkest, deepest canyon in Colorado
T
his rough and rugged part of Colorado is seldom visited by casual
travelers, but it holds some of the best outdoor adventure in the
state. The land begins its transition from the peaks and valleys of the
High Country to the plateaus of the Great Basin here. The terrain is steep
(which makes for great skiing), and the dramatic changes in elevation
produce wonders such as the Black Canyon of the Gunnison. Even if
you’re not looking to get off the grid entirely, these valleys and canyons
are far enough removed from civilization to elevate your soul and restore
your spirit. And you may have a little fun, too.
Gunnison and Crested Butte
Home to Western States College, Gunnison is a low-slung ranching town
with a historic Main Street and, around its perimeter, a sprawl of gun
stores, liquor stores, motels, and restaurants. It sits in a broad ranching
valley at the confluence of the Gunnison River and Tomichi Creek. If you
travel more than a few miles to the north or south of town, the scenery
gets even better. Eight federally designated wilderness areas are within
easy driving distance. In the Elk range to the north, Crested Butte boasts
world-class mountain biking, a famously steep ski area, and colorful
high-alpine basins.
Getting to Gunnison and Crested Butte
During winter, Gunnison Crested Butte Airport (% 970-641-2304) has
nonstop service to and from Houston on Continental Airlines. You can
fly to and from Denver year-round on United Airlines (see Chapter 11
for details on flying into Denver). Avis, Budget, and Hertz all have desks
at the airport. For information on contacting individual airlines and car-
rental agencies, see the appendix.

Alpine Express Shuttle Service (% 800-822-4844 or 970-641-5074; www.
alpineexpressshuttle.com) provides round-trip transportation
between the airport and Crested Butte for $51 per person. There’s no
taxi service in Gunnison, but some lodges will pick you up at the airport.
The main highway through this area is U.S. 50, which extends all the way
from Pueblo, 161 miles east of Gunnison, to Grand Junction, 126 miles to
Gunnison’s northwest. To reach Crested Butte, take Colorado 135 north
from Gunnison for 28 miles. Keep going another 3 miles north to reach
the ski area, in an area known as Mt. Crested Butte.
Getting around
If you plan on visiting this region, you’ll need a car, though in Crested
Butte you can survive without one. Crested Butte’s free Mountain Express
(% 970-349-7318) shuttles link downtown Crested Butte with Mt. Crested
Butte, 3 miles to the north. During summer and winter, the buses run from
around 7:30 a.m. until 11:30 p.m., with service at least every 20 minutes
during peak hours. Mountain Express observes a more relaxed schedule
in spring and fall. The shuttles can accommodate both bicycles and
wheelchairs. Call Crested Butte Town Taxi (% 970-349-5543) if you still
need a ride.
In Crested Butte, Colorado 135 enters town from the south, becomes
Sixth Street and continues to Mt. Crested Butte as Gothic Road. Elk
Avenue, the main road through the Crested Butte historic district, inter-
sects Sixth Street in the heart of the downtown area. In Gunnison, U.S. 50
travels east and west through town as Tomichi Avenue. Dozens of busi-
nesses are on Tomichi Avenue, but the heart of the downtown is Main
Street (Colorado 135), which goes north off Tomichi as Colorado 135.
Deciding where to stay
The most expensive rooms in this area, during winter at least, are at Mt.
Crested Butte, at the base of Crested Butte Mountain Resort. The town
of Crested Butte costs a few dollars less than Mt. Crested Butte, and
Gunnison costs much less.

Completed in 1962, this was the first lodge built expressly for skiers
coming to Crested Butte. Today, its low rates still attract avid mountain
athletes. The guests usually rise early; consume the strong coffee, cereals,
and homemade pastries included with their room rate; and then leave for
the day. When, hours later, they finally return to this Swiss-style lodge,
they gather and socialize by the fireplace, on the large sundeck, in the tel-
evision area (the rooms don’t have TVs), or in the hot tub. All told, the
place has a communal spirit that you seldom find at a lodge. The only
Chapter 22: Gunnison, Crested Butte, and the Black Canyon 287

drawbacks are the small rooms and a few spots where the building shows
its age.

Grand Lodge Crested Butte
$$–$$$$
Mt. Crested Butte
This hotel’s sturdiness, height (five stories), shops, and attentive employ-
ees call to mind a big-city hotel that caters to business travelers. One look
out the window, however, and you’ll happily remember that you’re at the
base of Crested Butte Mountain Resort, with the chairlifts just a few yards
away. Though the hotel has a restaurant, a coffee shop, and room service,
its rooms also have in-room refrigerators, coffeemakers, and microwaves
(in the suites only), so you won’t feel locked into paying for expensive
services. This is one of my favorite luxury hotels near a ski area. It’s all
business, and the business is skiing.

Wildwood Motel

Gunnison
To really experience Gunnison (and perhaps Crested Butte) on the cheap,
stay at this 1928 motel, located in a parklike setting just outside downtown
Gunnison. The rates here top out at $94 during summer; in winter, you can
often get a room with a full kitchen for three days for $100. The winter
prices make this place a steal if you want to ski for cheap. The rooms are
worn around the edges but clean, and they’re individually decorated,
sometimes in vintage furnishings. Outside, cottonwood trees shade the
spacious dirt parking lot and grassy barbeque areas. You can also rent an
RV site here, at rates ranging from $17 to $22 per day.

Exploring Crested Butte and Gunnison
Most of the best things in this area are outside in the mountains, but
there’s also a lot of human history in each town. Even if you’re not a
mountain person, you’ll find plenty to do.
The best things to see and do
When you’re not in the wilderness surrounding the Gunnison Valley, you
can check out one of these museums:
 In 2003, the Crested Butte Mountain Heritage Museum (www.
crestedbuttemuseum.org) and the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame
(% 800-454-4505 or 970-349-1880; www.mtnbikehalloffame.com)
opened in their new, permanent location inside an old gas station
at 331 Elk Ave. Supplementing the obligatory silver-mining exhibits
are displays on more recent local industries such as coal mining
and skiing. The Mountain Bike Hall of Fame has trend-setting moun-
tain bikes and the racing jerseys, bikes, and bios of the sport’s leg-
ends. A $2 donation is suggested; the museum and hall of fame are
open daily from noon to 7 p.m.
 The Gunnison Pioneer Museum, on East Highway 50 in Gunnison
(% 970-641-4530), has artifacts and memorabilia scattered
through eight buildings, including a 1905 schoolhouse and an 1876
post office. A long-standing institution, this museum costs $7 for
adults, $1 for children 6 to 12. It’s open Memorial Day through mid-
September, Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and
Sundays noon to 4 p.m.
Staying active in Gunnison and Crested Butte
The immense mountains around Crested Butte naturally challenge visi-
tors. This is the place to bike longer trails, ski steeper runs, and catch
bigger fish than you ever have. Just don’t stretch yourself too far when
you’re:
 Boating and sailing: Just west of Gunnison along U.S. 50, the
Gunnison River has been dammed three times inside the Curecanti
National Recreation Area (% 970-641-2337). If you like water
sports, get off the highway near Blue Mesa Reservoir, the largest
and most user-friendly of the three reservoirs — and, incidentally,
the largest body of water in Colorado. Blue Mesa Reservoir
stretches for 20 miles along the road and has three breezy main
basins that are perfect for sailing and windsurfing. Marinas are
located at Elk Creek (% 970-641-0707), along U.S. 50 midway
between the reservoir’s west and east ends; and at Lake Fork
(% 970-641-3048), off U.S. 50 at the west end of the reservoir. The
visitor center is also at Elk Creek. Before launching a motorboat or
a Colorado State–registered boat, you’ll need to pay $4 for a two-
day user fee. As for swimming, it’s the usual reservoir fare: cold
water, rocky shores, and no beaches. The recreation area has
Part IV: The High Country 
290

numerous first-come, first-served campgrounds, with most sites
costing $10.
 Fishing: Near Gunnison you can fish from a raft, rowboat, lakeshore,
or streambed. In the Curecanti National Recreation Area, federal
and state hatcheries stock over 3,000,000 fish every year. Along with
brown trout, Blue Mesa Reservoir has Kokanee salmon and some
immense lake trout. It’s a good place for trolling. On the Gunnison
River, you can spin-fish from a raft for some formidable trout.
There’s also premier fly-fishing in the Gunnison, East, and Taylor
rivers, among others.
A one-day Colorado fishing license costs $5.25, a five-day license
goes for $18.25. To find the best fly-fishing in this area or to get a
fishing license, contact High Mountain Outdoors, 115 S. Wisconsin
St., in Gunnison (% 800-793-4243 or 970-641-4243).
 Golfing: The Club at Crested Butte, 385 Country Club Dr. (% 800-
628-5496 or 970-349-6131), is one of Colorado’s top mountain
courses. Greens fees for this 18-hole, Robert Trent Jones course
range from $65 to $120, depending on the time of year and the time
of day.
 Hiking: Waterfalls, flower-flecked alpine basins, and immense,
craggy cirques surround the trails in the mountains above Crested
Butte and Lake City. Some of these trails remain snow-covered until
midsummer. During peak snowmelt periods, they may require dan-
gerous (or at least very cold) creek crossings. But what exciting
places to get your feet wet! The visitor centers in all three towns
can identify popular hikes. For topographical maps and updates on
trail conditions, stop at the Gunnison National Forest Gunnison
Ranger District office, 216 N. Colorado St. in Gunnison (% 970-641-
0471). The rangers can tell you about eight wilderness areas, includ-
ing ones near both Crested Butte and Lake City.
 Mountain biking: Along with Fruita (see Chapter 23), Crested Butte
has some of the most acclaimed mountain biking in North America.
Besides the quick and easy rides next to town, you can pedal on an
extensive network of single-track and forest roads high in the Elk
Mountains.
One legendary ride, The 401 Trail via Gothic Road, has a long,
snaking single-track descent through hip-high vegetation and 
flowers — but first, you have to climb to Schofield pass. Before
embarking on this 24-mile, advanced ride, stop at The Alpineer,
419 Sixth St. (% 970-349-5210; www.alpineer.com), for a detailed
trail description and, if needed, a rental bike. When it’s too snowy
to ride near Crested Butte, you can sometimes pedal on 40 miles
of trails at Hartsman’s Rock, near Gunnison. This arid area has a
mixed bag of surfaces, including slickrock, sand, and some craggy,
technical stretches. Tomichi Cycles, 104 N. Main St., in Gunnison
(% 970-641-9069), can tell you more about it and rent you a bike.

Hitting the slopes
Crested Butte Mountain Resort (% 800-810-SNOW; www.crested
butteresort.com) sits on the flanks of Mt. Crested Butte, an ominous,
12,162-foot shark’s tooth that would look right at home in either of two
Steven Spielberg movies (Jaws or Close Encounters of the Third Kind).
The mountain appears no less forgiving up close. Its north side has
some of the scariest lift-served terrain in the country, including steep
glades, steeper chutes, and jagged cliffs. If you want to test your mettle
in areas that require you to pass through gates, consult a ski patroller
first or sign up for one of the ski school’s guided North Face Tours. The
upshot for everyone else is that this terrain is safely removed from the
rest of the runs. While experts tangle with the likes of The Headwall,
Banana Funnel, and the North Face, beginners can tackle Peanut and
Yellow Brick Road. Intermediates can glide down the long groomed
slopes and forgiving mogul runs on the mountain’s northwest side.
Anyone who likes to ski or snowboard will have fun here, but, for tal-
ented riders, this is a special mountain. Check out the inside back cover
for more on the resort.
Enjoying the nightlife
Being a ski town, Crested Butte has a vigorous party scene during winter.
Start your journey on Elk Avenue between Second and Third streets.
 Crested Butte Brewery, 226 Elk Ave. (% 970-349-5026), serves
handcrafted beers, including the award-winning Red Lady Ale.
 At The Eldo, 215 Elk Ave. (% 970-349-9958), you can look out the
windows while dancing to live music (a sure-fire way to please your
date).
 Go to The Last Steep, 208 Elk Ave. (% 970-349-7007), for late-night
munchies.
 For more subdued socializing (not to mention single-malt scotches),
head for the Princess Wine Bar (% 970-349-0210) at 218 Elk Ave.

Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park
One of the most dramatically beautiful places in the West is the Black
Canyon of the Gunnison, where the Gunnison River has cleaved down-
ward for 2,000 feet into a tableland known as Black Mesa. Because the
canyon is deeper than it is wide, little sunlight reaches the river. This
lack of light, along with the dark walls of Precambrian gneiss (a hard
rock formed during a geologic age more than 543 million years ago),
makes the canyon mysterious and awe-inspiring. Even if you’re just driv-
ing by on the way to someplace else, it’s worth an hour’s stop to peek
over the edge near the visitor center.
Getting there
In winter, Montrose Regional Airport (% 970-249-3203) has daily serv-
ice to and from Dallas/Fort Worth (on American) and Houston (on
Continental); frequent service to and from Denver (on United Express)
and Phoenix (on America West Express); and Saturday-only service to
and from Newark (on Continental). During summer, you’ll probably have
to fly into Grand Junction (see Chapter 23). Budget, Dollar, National,
and Thrifty all have rental desks at the airport. For information on con-
tacting individual airlines and car-rental agencies, see the appendix.
From Grand Junction, the Black Canyon is a gorgeous 75-mile drive
southeast on U.S. 50. If you’re coming from the east, you can take U.S. 50
all the way from Pueblo, 200 miles away, where the highway dead ends
at I-25. If you’re coming from the northeast on I-70, get off in Glenwood
Springs and follow Colorado 82 south for 12 miles toward Aspen, then
take Colorado 133 south to Carbondale. Keep going on Colorado 133 for
90 miles southwest to Delta. This is an exquisite drive. From the south,
pick up U.S. 550 in Durango and take it north for 108 miles to Montrose,
then take U.S. 50 10 miles east to the canyon.
Where to stay
You can visit the Black Canyon easily from Gunnison or Crested Butte,
but the nearby towns of Montrose and Delta have a number of chain
hotels and a few bed-and-breakfasts. In Montrose, there’s the Best
Western Red Arrow, 1702 E. Main St. (% 970-249-9641); the Comfort
Inn, 2100 E. Main St. (% 970-240-8000); the Holiday Inn Express, 1391

S. Townsend Ave. (% 970-240-1800); and the Days Inn, 1655 E. Main St.
(% 970-249-3411). In Delta, try the Best Western Sundance Motel,
903 Main St. (% 970-874-9781), or the Comfort Inn, 180 Gunnison
River Dr. (% 800-228-5150 or 970-874-1000). During the summer, expect
to pay between $70 and $130 per night (double occupancy) for these
accommodations.
Exploring the park itself
In the Black Canyon, the Gunnison River falls farther over the course of 48
miles than the Mississippi does over 1,500. Because it had gravity working
in its favor, the water was able to saw downward through some of the
earth’s basement rocks — including incredibly hard gneiss. Because this
rock is so hard, rainfall has caused little erosion around the river, and few
side canyons have formed. The result is a gorge that’s much narrower (as
little as 1,300 feet) than it is deep (up to 3,000 feet). Along the river, far
below the rims, ponderosa pines cling to rocky shores above the steep,
thundering river, but in many places the canyon walls are too steep to
hold much vegetation.
Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park encompasses 15 of the most
spectacular miles of the Black Canyon. During late spring, summer, and
fall, you can visit either canyon rim. During the warm-weather months, I
recommend doing the extra driving, including a few miles on dirt roads, to
reach the North Rim. Far fewer people go there, and because the canyon
walls are nearly vertical on that side, you can look almost straight down 
at the river. Being just 7 miles north of U.S. 50 via paved roads, the South
Rim can be a quick hit, but it’s more crowded and slightly less spectacular.
Here are a few ways to enjoy either rim:
 Visit the rangers. On the South Rim, you can easily spend a half-hour
perusing the displays at the modern, full-service Visitor Center (open
daily 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. June through September; 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. the
rest of year). The rangers there can answer your questions about the
park. On the North Rim, the Ranger Station is the closest thing to a
visitor center. Sometimes there’s even a ranger around.
 Take a scenic drive. This is an enjoyable activity on either rim and
should take only about an hour. The five overlooks on the North
Rim are more stunning (some might say scary) than the twelve
South Rim viewpoints. However, the road on the South Rim is
paved; the North Rim has gravel roads.
 Hike on the rim. On the North Rim, you can choose between two
scenic rim trails. Near the North Rim Campground, there’s a short,
easy 1⁄3-mile loop known as the Cedar Point Nature Trail. If you’re
inclined to exercise, I’d skip the Cedar Point Trail and instead walk
31⁄2 miles (round-trip) to and from Exclamation Point on the North
Vista Trail. The North Vista Trail drifts through a forest of juniper
and pine en route to remote Exclamation Point, where you can look
Part IV: The High Country 
294

far upstream in the canyon. The North Vista trailhead is right next
to the Ranger Station.
On the South Rim, your best choice is the 11⁄2-mile (round-trip)
Warner Point Nature Trail. Located at High Point (the terminus of
the South Rim Road), the trail follows a ridgeline with panoramic
views south into the Uncompahgre Valley and north into the canyon.
 Hike to the river. The Park Service doesn’t advertise the fact that
you can hike deep into the canyon, and with good reason — these
descents are really nasty. You need to obtain an inner-canyon
permit before going, even if you’re only day-hiking. (On the North
Rim, you can simply sign the message board at the ranger station.)
The routes — not to be confused with trails — are very steep and
are covered with loose rock, so it’s hard to get traction. If you insist
on hiking into the canyon, start with the Gunnison Route, which
drops 1,800 feet over 1 mile from its trailhead near the South Rim
Visitor Center. Free permits for the backcountry campsites along
the river are issued on a first-come, first-served basis. I wouldn’t
take a heavy pack down any inner-canyon route, but when you
reach the river, you may relish having the chance to spend the
night. So take minimal gear when you head into the canyon.
 Camp on the rim. There are first-come, first-served campgrounds
(cost: $10) on both rims. Both have water and toilets, but some dif-
ferences exist. The North Rim has a smaller, prettier campground,
with a few sites that have partial views of the gorge. It sometimes
fills up during spring and fall, when rock climbers flock there to
take advantage of the temperate weather and big walls. The South
Rim campground is larger and set back farther from the rim. It
seldom fills up.
The South Rim is open year-round. The North Rim is open from mid-
April through mid-November, weather permitting. To reach the south
entrance, drive 8 miles east of Montrose on U.S. 50, and then go 7 miles
north on Colorado 347. The north entrance to the park is 11 miles south
of Crawford via Colorado 92 and the North Rim Road. Admission, good
for seven days, is $8 per car, $4 for individuals on foot, bicycle, or motor-
cycle. For more information, call % 970-641-2337 or surf the Internet to
www.nps.gov/blca.
Other things to see and do
Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park isn’t the only area attrac-
tion. In Montrose, you can
 Experience Ute art. Prior to the arrival of settlers, many mem-
bers of the Ute tribe wintered in Montrose, then hunted on the
Uncompahgre Plateau during summer. Since 1956, the Ute Indian
Museum, U.S. Hwy. 550 at Chipeta Road in Montrose (% 970-249-
3098), has preserved artifacts of the tribe. It’s worth coming here
just to see the beadwork, headdresses, and ceremonial attire. The

Colorado

In this part . . . 
T

state’s undiscovered treasures. The Western Slope features
canyons and mesas famous for their mountain-biking oppor-

to boom. The Four Corners area boasts the largest archaeo-
logical preserve in the country at Mesa Verde National Park,

I
t may not look like much of a slope, but trust me here: Heading west-
ward from the Elk Range near Aspen and Crested Butte, you’re travel-
ing downward from the continental divide into the giant, sunken plateaus
and ranges of the Great Basin. The Great Basin is a geological formation
that covers virtually all of Utah and Nevada and huge parts of New
Mexico, Arizona, Idaho, and even Washington and Oregon, as well as the
section of Colorado covered in this chapter. The climate here is a cold
desert; it qualifies as desert because it receives less than 10 inches of
rain per year, and it’s cold because unlike the subtropical deserts of
southern Arizona and northern Mexico, it snows — but not much — in
the winter.
The Colorado and other rivers that descend the Western Slope (the
Gunnison, Dolores, and Yampa, among others) have carved through the
layers of sedimentary rock to create amazing natural sculptures such as
the Book Cliffs and Colorado National Monument near Grand Junction,
the canyons of Dinosaur National Monument, and the Uncompahgre
Plateau. These rivers are just warming up in Colorado; they go on to
create the Arches and Canyonlands of Utah and, eventually, the Grand
Canyon itself. Up here in Colorado, though, where it’s still high and rela-
tively cool, they make the perfect landscape for desert camping, incredi-
ble mountain biking, and the country’s most exciting new wine country.
And all the exposed, ancient sediment makes it one of the world’s best
hunting grounds for fossils of the dinosaurs and plants that once inhab-
ited the Earth.

Grand Junction
Grand Junction is the largest city in western Colorado and has a relaxed
downtown graced with many sculptures. But what’s really amazing are
its immediate surroundings, including the following:
 Grand Mesa, an 11,000-foot, flat-topped mountain with hundreds of
small lakes and reservoirs.
 Colorado National Monument, where erosion has sliced four color-
ful canyons into the edge of the Uncompahgre Plateau.
 Orchards and vineyards east of Grand Junction in Palisade.
From Interstate 70 on a hot summer day, the west side of Grand Junction
appears as a bleached sprawl of chain stores and hotels. This isn’t a
mirage. With a population around 40,000, Grand Junction is the largest
town in western Colorado, and people come from all around for shop-
ping, medical care, and entertainment. That’s one reason why the west
side of town sprawls with malls. If, however, you drive south off the
interstate into the downtown, you find attractive homes from the early
1900s, an artsy Main Street shopping district, and a real-world commu-
nity that evenly balances business and pleasure. When the light softens
in the evening, the colors surface in the town’s verdant, irrigated parks
and golf courses; in the salmon-colored rocks of Colorado National
Monument; and in the blue-brown Colorado River, which absorbs the
smaller Gunnison River at the south end of town. Water from the rivers,
and from the earth itself, helps grow fruit in the nearby valleys and mois-
tens the vineyards of eight area wineries.
Getting there
Grand Junction is in far western Colorado on I-70, 251 miles west of
Denver. U.S. 50 enters Grand Junction from the southeast. Montrose (see
Chapter 24) is 61 miles southeast of Grand Junction on U.S. 50.
Walker Field, 2828 Walker Field Dr. (% 970-244-9100; www.walkerfield.
com), has daily service from Phoenix (on America West), Salt Lake City (on
Delta) and Denver (on Frontier and United). Upon landing, you can rent
cars from Avis, Budget, Enterprise, Hertz, National, and Thrifty, or call
Sunshine Taxi (% 970-245-TAXI) or American Spirit Shuttle (% 970-523-
7662) for a ride to your hotel (around $15 one-way). For information on
contacting individual airlines and car-rental agencies, see the appendix.
Amtrak’s California Zephyr train (% 800-USA-RAIL; www.amtrak.com),
which runs from Chicago to the Bay Area, stops at the station at 331 S.
First St. (% 970-241-2733) in Grand Junction twice daily, once in each
direction.

Getting around
Many of Grand Junction’s most splendid attractions are in the surround-
ing countryside, so the best way to get around is by car. Most of the city
is between the Colorado River (on the south) and I-70 (on the north).
When driving in town, keep in mind that the town’s numbered streets
run north and south, perpendicular to Main Street and the named
avenues, which go east and west. The downtown borders Main Street
between First Street and Seventh Street.
Where to stay
Chain hotels line Grand Junction’s Horizon Drive where it crosses I-70.
These hotels cater to both passersby and people vacationing in the city,
and their rates fluctuate along with the ebb and flow of freeway traffic,
which is heaviest during warm-weather months. Scattered through the
downtown and surrounding valley are older motels and some pleasant
bed-and-breakfasts. An hour southeast of Grand Junction, Grand Mesa
has cabins and historic lodges alongside lakes in deep pine forests.
Alexander Lake Lodge
$$
Grand Mesa
The seven cabins on this property overlook one of those perfect little
alpine lakes that seem to belong in a sepia-toned movie scene. The cabins
sleep anywhere from two to seven people. Some are in almost perfect con-
dition; others need work. Some have full kitchens; others just have
microwaves. The owners hired a full-time construction team to add a few
cabins and bring the whole place up to snuff. Construction aside, most of
the activity is inside the 100-year-old Alexander Lake Lodge, which has an
immense fireplace, hanging pelts, and an enclosed porch with lake views.
The lodge has a fine, moderately priced restaurant inside that’s open for
lunch and dinner Thursday through Sunday, year-round.

Nov–May $55–$120 cabin. MC, V.
Doubletree Grand Junction
$$
Grand Junction
The Doubletree sits right across I-70 from the Holiday Inn — the other
major hotel in town — but the two are as different as east and west. The
Doubletree is better for couples and business travelers. It costs more, has
an upscale restaurant and popular sports bar, and offers amenities such as
room service and extra phones in the bathrooms. Because the Doubletree
towers eight stories above the vertically challenged town of Grand
Junction, it has the most expansive views in the area, including ones of the
hotel tennis courts and outdoor swimming pool.

Holiday Inn Grand Junction
$–$$
Grand Junction
Close your eyes (briefly) and picture a guest room at an especially nice
Holiday Inn. Now that you know what the accommodations look like, I can
tell you about the real advantage to this hotel: a HoliDome entertainment
zone that will tie up your kids for hours, if not days. Children love the
indoor swimming pool, hot tub, pool tables, table tennis, and video arcade.
Parents can either suffer the children or suffer on the cardiovascular
machines. There’s also an outdoor swimming pool and hot tub in a wind-
sheltered, sun-splashed courtyard. As at all Holiday Inns, kids stay free,
and the hotel restaurant (a Coco’s) caters to youngsters. The location,
mere yards from I-70, makes this a viable choice even if you’re only pass-
ing through.

Two Rivers Winery
$–$$
Grand Junction
If the words pitching woo remind you of Japanese baseball, it’s time to
rediscover romance by taking your partner to the Chateau at the Two
Rivers Winery. Each named for one of the world’s prime grape-growing
regions, the ten immaculate guest rooms all have French décor and views
of the surrounding vineyards. There isn’t a HoliDome here to distract you,
so you can lavish all your attention on your partner — perhaps even over
a bottle of wine. Come morning, you can breakfast on bright-yellow table-
cloths in a sunny dining area or take your food onto an outside deck.
2087 Broadway. % 866-312-WINE or 970-255-1471. Fax: 970-255-0483. www.two
riverswinery.com. Rack rates: $89–$165. Rates include breakfast. AE, MC, V.
Where to dine
Grand Junction is only now getting used to the idea of gourmet dining. It
has a handful of fine restaurants and many others that serve good eats.
Unlike many other Colorado towns, it also has plenty of suburban-style
chains.
Fiesta Guadalajara
$–$$
Grand Junction
MEXICAN
Fiesta Guadalajara has tapped into the same successful formula used by
chain Mexican eateries across America. In a sprawling, Technicolor dining
room, the restaurant serves cheese-heavy, south-of-the-border fare in por-
tions large enough to make you feel as if you’ve entered an eating contest.
Chapter 23: Grand Junction and the Western Slope 303

This formula, which also involves flavored margaritas and fried ice
cream, seems to play as well in Grand Junction as it does in metropolitan
suburbs — which is to say, very well indeed.
710 North Ave. (at Seventh St.). % 970-255-6609. Reservations accepted. Main
courses: $5.95–$15. AE, DISC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Thurs 11 a.m.–10 p.m., Fri–Sat
11 a.m.–11 p.m., Sun 11 a.m.–9 p.m. Closed Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Pablo’s Pizza
$
Grand Junction
PIZZA
On its Spudstacular pizza, Pablo’s Pizza dumps roasted potatoes, sour
cream, chives, green onions, and cheese; on the Bangkok, it drops Thai
peanut sauce, large shrimp, green onions, bell peppers, cilantro, and
cheese. The kids’ menu even has a Mac ’n’ Cheese pizza. Named for Pablo
Picasso, the restaurant calls its pizza “a slice of art,” but it seems more like
pizza underneath a meal. In all, Pablo’s offers 14 specialty pizzas as well as
made-to-order pies and basic slices. And everything does taste good.
319 Main St. % 970-255-8879. No reservations. Pizzas: $7.25–$12 12-inch; $13–$22

STEAKS AND SEAFOOD
A kayak and hang glider dangle above the smoke-free dining area at this
restaurant, making the meals here a potential thrill sport. Rather than
worry about things crashing, keep your eyes on the fish, burgers, pizza,
pasta, and steaks, as well as on the beer. It’s all tasty. The restaurant also
has a smoking area and a bar where you can watch televised sports and sip
any of the half-dozen or so Rockslide brews available on tap.
401 Main St. % 970-245-2111. Reservations not accepted. Main courses: $7.50–$18.
AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat 11 a.m. to midnight; Sun 8 a.m. to midnight.
Exploring Grand Junction
No matter which direction you go from Grand Junction, you find awe-
some country. Grand Mesa rises to the southeast, towering 4,000 feet
higher than the 7,000-foot Uncompahgre Plateau, which is immediately
to Grand Junction’s southwest. Vineyards and orchards dot the valley
floor east of the city, alongside the Colorado River. And if you drive two
hours north from Grand Junction, you end up at Dinosaur National
Monument.
A trip to Grand Junction feels most rewarding if you spend time in the
surrounding territory. Go to Colorado National Monument for red-rock
desert canyons, or make the hour-long drive to Grand Mesa if you prefer
alpine lakes. Afterwards, you can enjoy the rewards of the town itself.
Part V: The Western Slope and Southern Colorado 
304

Colorado National Monument
Inside 20,000-acre Colorado National Monument (% 970-858-3617;
www.nps.gov/colm), runoff has carved four 800- to 1,000-foot-deep
canyons into the northeast edge of the 7,000-foot Uncompahgre Plateau.
You can enter the monument from either Fruita or Grand Junction on
Colorado 340, but either way, you climb 2,600 vertical feet from the
valley floor to the top of the plateau. Inside the National Monument,
Colorado 340 becomes Rim Rock Drive, which skirts the northeast edge
of the plateau for most of its 23 miles. The drive passes 18 overlooks of
the four canyons. From the overlooks, you can see balancing rocks,
spires, arches, and other unusual landforms. During breaks from your
journey on Rim Rock Drive, try the following:
 Go to the Visitor Center. The Rangers here will answer your ques-
tions, and you can purchase maps and books. A 12-minute video
flaunts stunning pictures of the surrounding landscape and offers
almost no information. (The message seems to be “Feel good about
nature.”) The visitor center is open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Take a short rim hike. The National Monument has six short, well-
marked trails on or near the canyon rim. Start with the Canyon
Rim Trail, which goes from the Visitor Center along the rim for
1⁄2 mile, affording views of Wedding and Monument canyons.
 Hike down into a canyon. Aside from the rim hikes, there are longer,
more demanding trails (or routes) that descend into the canyons.
Though less panoramic than the rim walks, these trails let you see
the rock formations up close, feel the scratchy desert vegetation,
and smell the sun-baked soils. Plus, they take you farther away from
the crowds. You can walk the Monument Canyon, Liberty Cap, and
Ute Canyon trails all the way to parking areas in Grand Valley or
climb back up to the rim.
Be sure to discuss your plans with a ranger before hiking into a
canyon and carry plenty of water.
 Camp. The first-come, first served Saddlehorn Campground has
sites with picnic tables and grills, and access to drinking water and
restrooms. The cost per site is $10.
Colorado National Monument is on Colorado 340 between Grand Junction
and Fruita. Admission, valid for seven days, costs $5 per car, $3 for indi-
viduals on foot, bicycle, or motorcycle. It’s free from October through
March.
Drive through the park at sunset for a breathtaking, movie-like display of
colorful light and shadow as the reddening sunlight plays on the sand-
stone, and the sky deepens from azure toward blackness and stars. It’s
one of those little moments that will illuminate your whole vacation and
make it unforgettable.
Chapter 23: Grand Junction and the Western Slope 305

Other than being flat-topped and near Grand Junction, Grand Mesa and
the Uncompahgre Plateau have little in common. With an apex over
11,000 feet, Grand Mesa is higher by more than 4,000 feet. Because of its
lofty elevation, it’s much wetter. Unlike the mostly arid Uncompahgre
Plateau, it has 300-some lakes, ponds, and reservoirs. Grand Mesa’s
forests of pine and aspen belong to the mountains and not the desert.
Even the rock layers are different. Grand Mesa has a cap of erosion-
resistant lava atop shale and other soft layers; the Uncompahgre Plateau
consists mostly of hard sandstone. You can drive up and over Grand
Mesa on Colorado 65 as you go from Cedaredge to Mesa. When you
reach the top, stop at the Grand Mesa Visitor Center (% 970-856-4153;
open Memorial Day through Labor Day daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.). The rangers
there can point out places for fishing, picnicking, boating, and hiking.
One premier hike is the Crag Crest National Recreation Trail, a 101⁄3-mile
loop that climbs 1,000 vertical feet to an 11,000-foot razorlike ridge —
the highest area on the mesa. You don’t have to do the whole loop to
reach the ridgeline. Just park at the west trailhead, near Island Lake, and
follow Trail 711 to the crest.
Other things to see and do
When you need a break from the hiking, fishing, and boating of Grand
Mesa, try one of the many other relaxing and enjoyable activities in
Grand Valley.
 Find a perfect peach. Grand Valley not only has two rivers, it sits
atop artesian wells that provide extra irrigation water for fruit and
grape growers. The sunny days, dry air, and cool nights also help
fatten the fruit. If you’re taking I-70 through Grand Valley during
summer, check to see what the farmers are selling in Palisade (I-70,
Exit 42), 13 miles east of Grand Junction. Look for cherries in June,
apricots in July, peaches in August, and apples in September.
 Get in the van and start “wining.” Palisade is home to seven of the
eight Grand Valley wineries. All offer free tastings and sell wine by
the bottle. (The eighth winery, Two Rivers, is in Grand Junction
proper.) You can pick up a free guide to area wineries at the
Grand Junction Visitor and Convention Center, 740 Horizon Dr.,
in Grand Junction (% 800-962-2547 or 970-244-1480; www.visit
grandjunction.com).
American Spirit Shuttles (% 888-226-5031 or 970-523-7662) offers
custom tours of area wineries for a minimum of $130 (or $25 per
person for groups of six or more). They also offer regularly sched-
uled group tours on Wednesdays and Saturdays (cost: $25 per
person).
 Brave the Jurassic Robots. Dinosaur Journey Museum, 550
Jurassic Court (off I-70, Exit 19), in Fruita (% 888-488-DINO or
970-858-7282; www.dinosaurjourney.org), has some dinosaur
skeletons, but the real attractions are its robotic dinosaurs. They
look realistic, move convincingly, and, except for an occasional
metallic clunking noise, make all the shrill cries and howls that
Part V: The Western Slope and Southern Colorado 
306

people in the Age of Spielberg have come to expect of dinosaurs.
Later, you can shift your attention to a simulated 5.3 magnitude
earthquake. It’s open May through September, daily from 9 a.m. to
5 p.m.; and October through April, from Monday through Saturday
10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Sunday noon to 4 p.m. Admission is $7 adults, $6
seniors 60 and over, and $4 children ages 3 to 12.
 Dig it. The Museum of Western Colorado (% 888-488-DINO; www.
dinodigs.org) lets visitors participate in one-day (cost: $99) and
three-day (cost: $695) digs alongside real paleontologists at a site
west of Grand Junction. You can get information about these digs at
the Dinosaur Journey Museum (see the preceding item).
 Savor sidewalk sculpture. Long before Denver created its 16th
Street Mall, Grand Junction converted its Main Street (between
Second and Fifth avenues) into a pedestrian-friendly shopping park.
Besides having restaurants and shops, the park is home to Art on
the Corner — 26 permanent and 28 loaned sculptures that brighten
the downtown sidewalks. You can purchase the loaned sculptures
at prices ranging from $400 to $30,000. The many whimsical pieces
make any trip downtown (and off of the interstate) special. Call the
Downtown Development Agency at % 970-245-9697 for more
details.
Staying active
At less than 5,000 feet, Grand Junction is one of the low spots in western
Colorado and a prime area for year-round, snow-free sports. If you’re
fixing to freeze, you can always drive to Grand Mesa, more than 6,000
feet higher than the Grand Valley. Otherwise, consider these options:
 Cross-country skiing: The Grand Mesa Nordic Council (% 970-
434-9753) grooms up to 35 kilometers of track for free skiing on
Grand Mesa. Some trails are regularly maintained, others are
groomed sporadically. There’s also an extensive network of forest
roads that are packed down for snowmobiling. For information
on winter sports atop the mesa, contact the Grand Mesa Visitor
Center at % 970-856-4153.
 Golfing: Golf Digest recently named the Golf Club at Redlands
Mesa, 2325 West Ridges Boulevard, in Grand Junction (% 970-263-
9270), one of the nation’s best new affordable courses. Greens fees
for 18 holes are $69.
 Hiking: Great hikes await both atop Grand Mesa and inside the
Colorado National Monument. If you simply want a convenient,
pretty place to walk, ride, or inline skate, head for any of four
Colorado Riverfront Trails, which range in length from 1⁄2 mile to
4 miles. One easy one to find is the Watson Island/Old Mill Bridge
Trailhead, at the intersection of Seventh Street and Struthers,
where the city’s Botanic Garden is located.
 Mountain biking: Abundant public lands, a dry climate, and a 
mixture of forest and desert combine to make this one of the
Chapter 23: Grand Junction and the Western Slope 307

nation’s newest mountain-bike hot spots. If you want to go really far,
perhaps even with vehicle support, you have two good options. The
Tabeguache Trail, a mix of double track and some steep, technical
single track, drifts 144 miles from Grand Junction south to Montrose,
climbing as high as 9,500 feet on the Uncompahgre Plateau. One 
trailhead is on Monument Road south of Broadway. Ruby Canyon
Cycles, 301 Main Street, in Grand Junction (% 970-241-0141), rents
mountain bikes and can tell you more about area trails.
To get your bearings, pick up a free copy of Biking Guide to the
Grand Valley at visitor centers and bike shops around town.
Hitting the slopes
Powderhorn Resort (% 970-268-5700; www.powderhorn.com), on the
north face of Grand Mesa, has the closest lift-served skiing to Grand
Junction. At just 510 acres, this is one of the smaller ski areas in the
state, but it has a respectable 1,650-foot vertical drop, including some
direct fall-line skiing off the Take Four Chairlift. Powderhorn doesn’t
always get enough snow at its base. The ski area’s 9,850-foot summit is
low by Colorado standards, and the resort isn’t in a major snow belt. But
the terrain is fine, especially if you can catch it during a big snow year.
For more details on Powderhorn, see the inside back cover.
Shopping
In the downtown area, the pedestrian-friendly Main Street Shopping
District (Main Street between Second and Fifth avenues) has galleries,
restaurants, and shops — and more than 50 sculptures. With over 160
stores and restaurants, Mesa Mall (% 970-242-0008), at the junction of
24 Road and U.S. 6 and 50, is the largest mall between Denver and Salt
Lake City. Anchor stores include Target, Sears, J.C. Penney, and Mervyn’s.
Part V: The Western Slope and Southern Colorado 
308
Fruita’s amazing bike trails
For incredible mountain biking in a beautiful high-desert landscape, head over to Fruita,
15 miles northwest on I-70, down the valley from Grand Junction. Kokopelli’s Trail, a
project of the local biking association and the Bureau of Land Management, wends its
way from Fruita all the way down Colorado’s canyons to Moab, Utah. It’s a 142-mile trip,
a dream for experienced backcountry riders. Be sure to pick up the map and guide pam-
phlet at area bike shops or at the Grand Junction Visitor and Convention Bureau (740
Horizon Dr.; % 800-962-2547 or 970-244-1480; www.visitgrandjunction.com). If
you want a shorter ride, the Horsethief Bench Trail is a short but rugged loop over
Horsethief Canyon, easily reachable from Exit 15. From Exit 17, you can take Monument
Road south to the trailhead for the Black Ridge Trail, which meanders up onto the
Uncompahgre Plateau and into the Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness Area. Remember,
this is a desert — pack plenty of water!

Taking a Side Trip to Dinosaur and
Dinosaur National Monument
Surrounded by windswept high desert, the town of Dinosaur is home to
400 people, a handful of motels and restaurants, and not much else. The
town has a memorable personality, but the big surprise comes when 
you visit nearby Dinosaur National Monument: Only a small portion of
the monument has anything to do with dinosaurs. The first 80 acres 
or so were set aside in 1915 to preserve a quarry full of remarkably well-
preserved dinosaur fossils; the remaining 210,000 acres encompass
scenic desert canyons, including the confluence of the Green and Yampa
rivers.
Getting to Dinosaur
Dinosaur National Monument straddles the Utah–Colorado border and
has a paved entrance road on each side. The monument’s headquarters
are on U.S. 40, 2 miles east of the town of Dinosaur, which is 3 miles east
of the Utah border and 110 miles north of Grand Junction (about a two-
hour drive). To reach Dinosaur from Grand Junction, take I-70 12 miles
east to Colorado 139 north. Follow Colorado 139 north for 75 miles, then
turn left (west) on Colorado 64 and follow it for 20 miles to the town of
Dinosaur. The dinosaur quarry is 7 miles north of Jensen, Utah. To reach
Jensen, go 20 miles west of Dinosaur on U.S. 40.
Seeing the sights
The main attraction in this area, sure enough, is Dinosaur National
Monument (% 435-781-7700; www.nps.gov/dino), but you can find
many different sights within the monument itself. Two main roads go
into the monument, one from the Utah side and one from the Colorado
side:

Day through Labor Day daily 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; the rest of year, it’s
open daily 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
The fossils inside the quarry date to 145 million years ago, when
floods swept dinosaur carcasses onto a sandbar, where they were
buried by river sediment. Through time, the sediment turned to
rock and the bones fossilized. Today, the quarry consists of an
exposed rock wall in which hundreds of bones are imbedded.
Archeologists removed many bones in the past, then left others
for future generations. They even put up a roof to protect the area.
Opposite the wall of bones is a two-story viewing area with dis-
plays, reconstructed skeletons, and an area for ranger discussions.
After seeing the quarry, drive 11 miles on Cub Creek Road. You
pass 800-year-old rock art, viewpoints above the Green River, hiking
trails, a historic cabin, and the most conveniently situated camp-
ground in the park. Alongside Cub Creek Road, just inside the
entrance gate, you can pick up a brochure that interprets key land-
marks along the way.
 It costs nothing to enter the National Monument on the Colorado
side. First, stop at the Monument Headquarters. The headquarters
has no dinosaur bones, but it does have maps and information as
well as a short video about the monument. If you enter from this
side, you won’t see dinosaur bones, period. Instead, drive Harpers
Corner Road and climb onto the broad Yampa Plateau, reaching
overlooks of the confluence of the Green and Yampa rivers. Twenty-
three different geological strata are exposed in the park, and many
can be seen in the colorful canyons visible from this road.
I recommend driving all 31 miles to the end of the road and then
hiking another mile (one-way) to the end of Harper’s Corner Trail.
This puts you at the tip of a peninsula from which you can see a
broad sweep of the canyon carved by the Green River, more than
3,000 feet below, including a massive fin of rock where the Green
meets the Yampa. If you have a high-clearance vehicle and the
weather is fair, and if you also have a high tolerance for rugged,
bumpy roads, you may enjoy a 13-mile detour (one-way) down
Echo Park Road, which descends to the shady campground near
the confluence. En route, it passes more hiking trails, rock art, and
a historic cabin. This road becomes impassable when wet, even for
four-wheel-drive vehicles, so don’t try it if it’s been raining.
Where to stay in Dinosaur
Lodging choices are few in Dinosaur. There are a couple of motels, but if
you’re going this far out into the rangelands, why not camp? The eight
campgrounds in the park rarely fill up, except on holiday weekends. Fees
range from free to $12 per night. On the Utah side, the Green River
Part V: The Western Slope and Southern Colorado 
310

Campground, open April to October, has 88 sites with drinking water,
modern restrooms and access to the ranger talks at campfire circles.
The Echo Park Campground, on the Colorado side, has 17 sites and is a
more rugged experience, for $8 per night. Call % 435-781-7700 for more
camping information.
Where to dine in Dinosaur
At Miner’s Cafe, 420 E. Brontosaurus Blvd. (U.S. 40; % 970-374-2020),
in Dinosaur, you hear your food before you taste it. Entrees include the
likes of chicken-fried steak, hamburger steak, popcorn shrimp, and bat-
tered halibut. A hamburger patty on cottage cheese constitutes a “Diet
Delight.” Nothing costs over $10. The restaurant also sells fossils and 
tie-dyes, has Christian literature on the tables, and allows smoking. It’s
open Monday through Saturday for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

The Southwestern 
High Country
In This Chapter
 The high life in Telluride
 The sleepy towns of Silverton and Ouray
 Durango, everyone’s favorite southwestern town
 Mesa Verde and the Four Corners
H
igh peaks, classic Western history, and quiet canyons give way to
the arid mesas and sagebrush-lined gullies of the southwestern
plateaus. Historic mines still dot the hills around the alpine towns of
Telluride, Ouray, and Silverton, left from the silver boom of the 1880s
and with gold boom of the 1890s. Not far away, 800-year-old cliff
dwellings left by once-thriving Ancestral Puebloan communities fill the
openings in canyon walls south of Cortez and Mancos. You can go to
this region — my favorite part of the state — to explore remnants of the
past or forget the past and go just for the recreation, excitement, and
beauty.
Located where the mountains meet the mesas, Durango is the largest and
busiest town in the area, and it’s central to both the mines of Silverton
and the pueblo dwellings of Mesa Verde. If you stay here, you can take
the historic Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad one day and
tour multistory cliff dwellings the next. Telluride is less central, but it’s
one of the most visually stunning spots in North America. Though
trendier than it used to be, it still combines soothing surroundings with
an abundance of lodging, recreation, dining, and entertainment. Cortez,
Mancos, and Dolores are all down-to-earth communities where you can
stay for cheap while you get serious about exploring the world of the
Ancestral Puebloans. And if you want to stop exploring and soak your
weary muscles in hot springs, head for Pagosa Springs.

What’s Where? Southwest Colorado 
and Its Major Attractions
Don’t let nicknames like Derange-O and To-Hell-U-Ride scare you away
from southwestern Colorado. Though the mountains are still rugged,
the towns have been more or less scrubbed clean for visitors.
Telluride highlights
This 1880s mining town saw its fortunes rise again when Telluride Ski
Area opened in 1972. The ski area attracted hippies who saw the beauty
here and made the mistake of talking about it. Today the town is far
wealthier than it was 20 years ago, but the residents still pride them-
selves on being relaxed and fun-loving. Make sure you check out the fol-
lowing while you’re around:
 Telluride Ski Resort: A mogul-studded ski area that recently devel-
oped a family-friendly side.
 Bridal Veil Falls: These 300-foot falls form the headwaters of the
San Miguel River, which flows right through town.
 Downtown Telluride: Offers great shops, restaurants, and bars.
Ouray and Silverton highlights
These mountain communities have a few things in common. They both
have year-round populations under 800, and, nestled between craggy
peaks and crossed by rivers, they’re both stunning places with rich histo-
ries either as mining or rail towns. Their attractions include the following:
 Ouray County Historical Museum: Former patient rooms in an old
hospital now house displays on the town’s history.
 Hikes around Ouray: Trek forested hillsides with few roads.
 The Old Hundred Gold Mine Tour: Near Silverton, the mine is
worth visiting because much of the machinery still works.
Durango highlights
Built as a rail town to serve the mines in Silverton, Durango sits in a
horseshoe-shaped gap in the foothills of the San Juans. Partly because it
has a college, a popular railroad line, and abundant recreation, this city
of 14,000 stays busy year-round. Highlights include
 Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad: A historic rail line
that chugs backward in time and upward in elevation.
 The Strater Hotel: You can catch a show, have a meal or a cocktail,
or simply admire the ornate woodwork.
 Durango Mountain Resort: A rare ski area that may be more fun in
summer.

The Southwestern High Country

The Four Corners highlights
The Ancestral Puebloans left behind thousands of dwellings and arti-
facts in this area during the years A.D. 300 to 1300. Today, people come
here to explore the distant past, but towns such as Cortez and Dolores
are fun, too. During your visit, don’t miss these stops:
 Anasazi Heritage Center and Crow Canyon Archeological Center:
Two great places to discover the world of the Ancestral Puebloans.
 Mesa Verde National Park: The largest archeological preserve in
the nation, the park is packed with pit houses, mesa-top pueblos,
kivas (circular, partly subterranean ceremonial chambers), and cliff
dwellings.
 Ute Mountain Ute Tribal Park: You can experience amazing cliff
dwellings and archeological sites while traveling in small groups
accompanied by Native American guides.
 Nighttime programs at Cortez Cultural Center: Programs include
Native American dancing, music, and even plays.
Telluride
Telluride locals often use the word funky to describe their town, and
somehow it manages to live up to its billing, even though it’s hard to be
funky 24/7. This may be the only place where you can hear reggae artist
Burning Spear playing over the stereo inside the grocery store; where
businesses have cheerful (if corny) names such as Sunshine Pharmacy,
Baked in Telluride, and The Magic Market; and where dogs wander about
town with little interference. Old mining shacks and sheds still clutter
the town’s muddy back alleys, remnants of the days when Telluride
boomed with immigrants seeking silver.
Still, Telluride is more than just funky. Cradled in a glacier-carved box
canyon with the San Miguel River at its heart, this is one of the most
majestic places in North America. It’s also remote. It’s not exactly at
Earth’s edge — commercial air service reaches the town’s airstrip, as
well as the airport at Montrose, 65 miles to the north — but it does take
extra effort to get here, which helps keep it peaceful. If Telluride wasn’t
so expensive, most of us would probably be living there right now, and
the town wouldn’t feel half as funky, majestic, remote, or peaceful.
Getting to Telluride
Telluride is situated 4 miles up a 6-mile spur of Colorado 145. It’s 73 miles
northeast of Cortez on Colorado 145 and 68 miles south of Montrose. To
reach Telluride from Montrose, follow U.S. 550 21 miles south to Ridgway,
go south (right) for 25 miles on Colorado 62. In Placerville, go left on
Colorado 145 and then continue for 17 miles to Telluride, bypassing a
turnoff where Colorado 145 turns right (south) toward Cortez.
Chapter 24: The Southwestern High Country 315

To avoid the 335-mile drive from Denver, you can fly directly to Telluride
Regional Airport (% 970-728-5313; www.tellurideairport.com),
6 miles north of town, either from Phoenix (America West) or Denver
(Frontier or United). In winter, Montrose Regional Airport (% 970-249-
3203) offers daily service to and from Dallas/Fort Worth (American),
Denver (United), Houston (Continental), and Los Angeles (Continental),
and Saturday-only service to and from Newark (Continental) and
Chicago (American).
Some of my friends who regularly attend the Telluride Film Festival take
advantage of Southwest Airlines’ low fares and fly into Albuquerque
(New Mexico) International Sunport Airport (% 505-244-7780), then
rent a car and drive up — a 350-mile trip.
Budget and National have car-rental offices at Telluride Regional Airport.
At Montrose Airport, you can choose between Budget, Dollar, National,
and Thrifty. At Albuquerque Sunport, Advantage, Alamo, Avis, Budget,
Dollar, Enterprise, Hertz, National, and Thrifty all have offices. For infor-
mation on contacting individual airlines and car-rental agencies, see the
appendix.
Telluride Express (% 888-212-TAXI or 970-728-6000) offers taxi service
between Telluride and both Telluride and Montrose airports. Rides to
and from Telluride airport cost $16 per person round-trip. Service to
Montrose costs $78 per person round-trip.
Getting around in Telluride
In Telluride, you want to travel on foot as much as possible, if only to
best experience the mountains towering above you.
Telluride by car
Driving around town and just outside of town is pretty easy. You can’t get
lost; Telluride is tiny and surrounded by natural barriers. About 3 miles
west of town, Highway 145 becomes Colorado Avenue, Telluride’s main
thoroughfare. Colorado Avenue travels east and west through the down-
town. Most of the cross streets, which run north and south, are named for
trees. Continuing east out of town on Colorado Avenue, you pass Town
Park — site of numerous music festivals and, in winter, the Nordic center
and ice rink. Two miles later you reach Bridal Veil Falls, at the head of the
box canyon occupied by Telluride. Bridal Veil and other threadlike falls
become the headwaters of the San Miguel River, which curves along the
base of Telluride Ski Resort and borders the north side of town.
Telluride by shuttle
During peak periods, parking costs 50¢ an hour on Colorado Avenue
and the roads to its south. Look for a spot north of Colorado Avenue.
Negotiating the downtown area on foot or by using the free Galloping
Goose shuttles, which run every 20 minutes during summer and winter,
Part V: The Western Slope and Southern Colorado 
316

is easier than driving everywhere. During summer, the shuttles only oper-
ate on weekdays. Call % 970-728-5700 for 24-hour shuttle information.
A free gondola, which runs from 7 a.m. to midnight daily, links Telluride’s
downtown with the luxurious Mountain Village development. The gon-
dola makes the trip between Telluride and Mountain Village faster than
it is in a car. What’s more, you can easily load your bike on it and get off
at mid-mountain on the ski area, where some of the best trails are. (You
can ride at low elevations even in winter, if there’s a warm dry spell
while you’re visiting.) To reach Mountain Village by car, follow Colorado
145 for 1 mile south from the Telluride turnoff, then go left on Mountain
Village Boulevard.
Where to stay in Telluride
Staying in Telluride isn’t cheap. You can choose between historic hotels
that have lots of character and new hotels that have every imaginable
luxury. What you don’t find here are a lot of economical lodges that
cater to tired skiers on a budget.

Telluride
Like many other new luxury hotels in Colorado ski towns, the Hotel
Telluride has a turreted exterior reminiscent of a European castle, a faux-
rustic Western lobby with antler lamps, a flagstone fireplace, and leather
sofas; and guest rooms that blend European and Western elements. Even
if the formula isn’t original, it works well here, mostly because the owner-
ship has enough bucks to create some bang. The plush rooms, for exam-
ple, feature feather bedding, down comforters, and monogrammed sheets
on the beds, as well as Aveda spa products in the bathrooms. All rooms
offer mountain views. If you want personal pampering, the hotel’s full-serv-
ice spa offers an array of deluxe treatments.

This 1990 lodge feels snug and efficient like a dormitory, but its rooms are
luxurious and its location is among the best in town. It’s 100 yards from
the Oak Street Ski Lift, two blocks from Telluride’s lively Colorado Avenue,
and flush on the bank of the San Miguel River. The rooms, which are dec-
orated in a Southwestern motif, have private balconies. The deluxe rooms
are roughly twice the size of the lodge rooms, and many have balconies
right above the river. If you value space, they’re probably worth the extra
$30 to $50.

The Victorian Inn

Telluride
The year 1976 is carved on the side of the Victorian Inn, as if the building
were an architectural landmark that would endure for generations. Truth
be told, this inn is still here because it’s clean, well maintained, and, above
all, among the cheapest in town. Your pocketbook will take a small hit if
you stay here, but this is still Telluride’s best option for travelers on a
budget. For $10 extra, you can get a room with a kitchenette and do a little
cooking on your own. The Victorian’s Honeymoon Suite is an extra-large
room with superlative mountain views. If you’re the first to ask for it, you
get it for the same rate as for the other rooms.

Telluride
Gone are the days when bone-weary skiers gladly settled for a stein of beer,
a few bites of summer sausage, and a bug-free bed. Completed in 1992, this
six-story, ski-in, ski-out hotel has nearly everything a mortal could want —
except maybe character. It has a 42,000-square-foot spa with 44 treatment
rooms, a climbing wall, racquetball courts, swimming pools, a water slide,
an immense exercise room, a golf course, two restaurants, and a spacious
bar. Located in Telluride’s tony Mountain Village community, the hotel,
easily the largest in town, observes what it calls seasonality, which in
mortal-speak, that means it’s closed from mid-April to late May and again
for a time in late fall.

Camping in Telluride
If you’re not averse to pitching a tent, you can camp in the Town Park
Campground (% 970-728-2173) from mid-May to mid-October. It’s a
scenic, wooded campground within easy walking distance of town. During
music festivals, campsites are sold as part of festival packages, and the
place can be noisy. The rest of the season, campsites are available on a
first-come, first-served basis, at a cost of $12 per site, or $10 for primitive
(meaning no nearby parking) sites. The campground has no hookups and
can only accommodate vehicles under 30 feet long. Showers and toilet
facilities are available on site.

Where to dine in Telluride
Telluride’s food compares with the best on the coasts, probably because
some of the best chefs from the coasts fled to Telluride. Far from being
cloistered, they return home periodically to check on the latest trends in
the industry, and then bring back new discoveries.

thing possible. Lined up in its glass display cases are bagels, donuts, break-
fast pastries, pizzas, calzones, and puff pastries. As for the dogs, they fare
best during summer, when the many outdoorsy patrons of Baked in
Telluride while away hours on the restaurant’s deck, making calls on the
pay phones and passing crusts to the canines. If you’re just drinking coffee,
you can deposit your money in an honor box on the counter.

“Bourbon, beer & BBQ” is the motto of this casual eatery, which lacks table

fried chicken, and chicken-fried steak, but the restaurant also throws a few
non-bones to vegetarians, including a tasty ziti-and-black-bean plate. Side
dishes, ordered à la carte, include fried okra; red beans and rice; and sweet
potato fries. For your beverage, you’re free to order a top-shelf bourbon
and take it back to your picnic bench, but if pure trailer-park chic is your
goal, throw down $1 for a can of Schlitz.

support local farmers and to acquire recently harvested ingredients, and
the staff rolls tortillas and roasts chiles daily. The freshness permeates a

Exploring Telluride
If you want to do Telluride like a local on his or her day off, you should
party late, sleep in, exhaust yourself on the slopes or trails, seriously
relax for a few hours, and then do it all over again. This section offers a
few things you may want to pencil into your schedule.
The best things to see and do in Telluride
When you get up in the morning and start moving around, you can
choose from among the following:
 Find out about the guy who cut out his own appendix. The
Telluride Historical Museum, 201 W. Gregory Ave. (% 970-728-
3344; www.telluridemuseum.com), was the town’s hospital from
1888 to 1964. The best exhibits at this newly renovated museum
link Telluride’s history to the building’s past as a hospital. There
are displays on mining accidents, causes of death among miners
(mostly lung disease and accidents), and the building’s onetime
claim to fame — the doctor who anesthetized himself and then
removed his own, perfectly healthy appendix. It’s open Tuesday
through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and is closed from mid-
April through mid-May. Admission is $5 for adults, $3 children ages
5 to 17 and seniors over 64.
 Walk the historic downtown. Telluride may look a little more spiffy
than neighboring towns, but its mining heritage is just as, uh,
unusual. Telluride’s Official Visitor’s Guide, available throughout
town, outlines a 14-stop historic walking tour and explains each
stop along the way. If you want to hear an audio narration, you can
rent a tape and headphones for $7 at the historical museum. During
Part V: The Western Slope and Southern Colorado 
320

summer, the museum can also arrange 90-minute guided group
walking tours, for which a minimum of $40 total is charged.
 Visit Bridal Veil Falls. To reach the general area of this 300-foot
falls, continue east out of town on Colorado Avenue and keep going
for 11⁄4 miles past where the pavement ends. A rugged road goes to
the top of the falls. If you have four-wheel-drive and high clearance,
you can drive to the top, but there’s little room to maneuver or
park once you get there. You’re better off parking at the bottom and
walking the mile or so to the top. If you’re walking or pedaling, you
can pass the power plant building at the top of the falls and go into
the high-alpine Bridal Veil Basin, which is a great place to see wild-
flowers during summer.
 Skate around. Telluride has a free skateboard ramp in Town Park,
open daily from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. If your kids don’t skate and need
a place to hang out, they can go to the Telluride Youth Center, 233
E. Pacific St. (% 970-728-0140), which has a basketball court, games,
a big screen TV, and a VCR.
Staying active in Telluride
No matter what your sport, you can probably do it in Telluride’s Town
Park (% 970-728-2173), along the San Miguel River at the east end of
town. There’s a skate park, swimming pool, tennis courts, volleyball
courts, and a softball diamond, not to mention a campground. In winter,
you can ice skate or Nordic ski here.
Chapter 24: The Southwestern High Country 321
Want festivals? We got festivals!
Telluride hosts music, art, and film festivals of world renown, and it seems as if there’s
one going on every week in the summer. The music festivals are held primarily in Town
Park. The best-known one is the Telluride Bluegrass Festival (% 800-624-2422; www.
planetbluegrass.com). Held in mid-June, it draws some of the world’s top
acoustic musicians, from pickers to singer/songwriters and more. This festival became
a must for Colorado music fans back in the 1970s; it’s gotten huge, though, and is a bit
crowded for some peoples’ tastes these days. Nevertheless, you hear the up-and-
comers from Austin, Nashville, and beyond, and a rotating collection of music legends
that you don’t hear anywhere else.
Other notable festivals include MountainFilm (% 970-728-4123; www.mountain
film.org) during Memorial Day weekend, which screens films celebrating mountain
life and environmental issues; Telluride Blues & Brews Festival (% 970-728-8037;
www.tellurideblues.com) in mid-September; the Telluride Jazz Celebration
(% 970-728-7009; www.telluridejazz.com) in early August; and the Telluride
Film Festival (% 603-433-9202; www.telluridefilmfestival.com) in early
September, showcasing mostly independent films. For more on upcoming festivals,
surf the Internet to www.visittelluride.com.

Here is a small selection of the many other options you can choose from:
 Climbing: Just a short drive (or walk) east of Telluride is Falls Walls,
home to more than 100 climbable pitches. You can also boulder
along Bear Creek. The staff at Telluride Mountaineer, 219 E.
Colorado Ave. (% 970-728-6736), can equip you for climbing, moun-
taineering, and backpacking. If you feel more comfortable climbing
with a guide, call Fantasy Ridge Alpinism (% 970-728-3546).
 Fishing: Kids under 12 can fish for free, without a permit, all summer
long at the Kid’s Fishin’ Pond at Town Park. Everyone else has to
find a spot on the San Miguel or on one of a half dozen or so nearby
alpine lakes. For advice and Colorado fishing licenses, call or visit
Telluride Outside, 121 W. Colorado Ave. (% 970-728-3895; www.
tellurideoutside.com).
 Golf: Located at the Wyndham Peaks Resort in the Mountain
Village community, Telluride Golf Club (% 970-728-3458) opens
its 18-hole, par-71 course soon after the snow melts. Greens fees
are $150 July through Labor Day; $130 the rest of the season.
 Hiking: Hiking trails go into the mountains all around Telluride.
The free Official Visitors Guide, available throughout town, has
information on 15 area trails. If you’re looking for one that’s reward-
ing and easy to find, walk to the end of South Pine Street, cross the
bridge, and walk 2 miles up the Bear Creek Canyon Trail. This
easy-to-follow trail ascends 1,040 vertical feet to its terminus at a
waterfall. If you want to keep going, you can pick up the more chal-
lenging Wasatch Trail just below the falls.
 Mountain biking: The mountain biking around Telluride ranges
from gradual, wide railroad grades to white-knuckle single track.
Beginners often pick up the San Miguel River Trail near Town Park
and follow it west for 21⁄2 miles. More advanced riders load their
bikes onto the free gondola, unload at Station St. Sophia, and then
ride trails beginning at midmountain at the Telluride Ski Area. For
information, maps, and rentals, contact Telluride Sports, 150 W.
Colorado Ave. (% 970-728-4477).
 Nordic skiing: Among the many trails readily available in and
around town, consider the Telluride Nordic Center (% 970-728-
1144), located at the east end of Town Park, which has 3 kilometers
of groomed cross-country trails. There’s no charge for using the
track, and rentals are available. There are also 6 groomed kilome-
ters on the golf course at Mountain Village.
Hitting the slopes in Telluride
In 2002, Telluride Ski Resort (% 970-728-6900; www.tellurideski
resort.com) added three new chairlifts, effectively doubling the amount
of lift-served terrain within the ski area to 1,700 acres. Suddenly what had
been a mogul-studded, midsized mountain had much more to offer. The
Part V: The Western Slope and Southern Colorado 
322

mountain now has beginner terrain spanning much of its 3,535 vertical
feet. It has several new intermediate runs to supplement the likes of See
Forever, which meanders 31⁄4 miles from summit to base. And it has some
exciting new steep terrain around the new Gold Hill chairlift. Telluride
still deserves its reputation for being challenging; the mountain’s south
side, which plummets into the downtown area, continues to sprout
Humvee-sized moguls during dry spells. But the resort’s new Gorrono
Basin area will please skiers for whom bumps are a jarring experience.
The “new” Telluride also prides itself on its family-friendly services.
Telluride ski instructors will videotape and critique your skiing for free.
Its mountain hosts provide free tours daily. And if your kids have ques-
tions about Telluride, they can go straight to a Web site for kids: www.
telluridekids.com. Best of all, Telluride almost never has lift lines. For
more on the resort, see the inside back cover.
Nightlife in Telluride
Telluride may be a puny little town but it can easily out-party the flashiest
big city. A few options for Telluride nightlife follow:
 At the Last Dollar Saloon, 100 E. Colorado Ave. (% 970-728-4800),
it’s not unheard of for people to get up and dance on the bar. If that’s
not quite what you had in mind, you can play pool and throw darts.
As for décor, you find everything from a stuffed, hanging catfish to a
Dollar Rent-A-Car sign. The place is very popular with locals, who
call it “The Buck.”
 Please don’t dance on the counter at Allred’s (% 970-728-7474), a
posh bar and restaurant perched inside the 10,535-foot-high Gondola
Station Saint Sophia, but go here anyway to absorb the views from
the restaurant nearly straight down 1,800 vertical feet into Telluride.
Even if you can’t afford dinner here (the food is delicious —
and pricey), order a beverage at sunset and watch the alpenglow
illuminate the surrounding peaks. You can ride the gondola to the
restaurant for free between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. A private club at
lunchtime, the restaurant opens to the public for après-ski (begin-
ning at 3:30 p.m.) and stays open for dinner.
 The New Sheridan Bar, 231 W. Colorado Ave. (% 970-728-3911),
has changed little since opening in 1885. It still boasts a large
mahogany bar, chandeliers, and room dividers with lead-glass
panels, all of which date back to the days when miners cut loose at
the bar. It’s also a friendly place, popular with both tourists and
locals.
 For live music, the hot spot is the Fly Me to the Moon Saloon, 132
E. Colorado Ave. (% 970-728-6666). Think of any musician who can
pick a guitar, mandolin, or banjo, and they’ve probably played here.

Ouray and Silverton
These are a couple of my favorite places on earth. Silverton still has a
respectable business district of false-fronted stone and wood buildings,
as well as the notorious Blair Street, where warped wooden shacks date
back to its days as the town’s red-light district. Around it are 13,000-foot
peaks streaked with avalanche paths and littered with mine debris. For a
few hours every day from May through October, the Durango & Silverton
Narrow Gauge Railroad deposits hundreds of oxygen-deprived tourists
in this 9,318-foot-high town, but when they’re gone, Silverton seems to
absorb silence from the surrounding forests.
Ouray (pronounced yuh-ray, and named after a great chief of the
Ute Nation) fittingly bills itself as the Switzerland of America — it’s
pinched between cliffs nearly as foreboding as those found in places
like Chamonix. Ice climbers love the town’s frozen waterfalls, both man-
made and natural. Come evening, they thaw themselves in the town’s
geothermal hot springs, which bubble out of the earth mere yards from
the Uncompahgre River.
Getting to Ouray and Silverton
Ouray and Silverton are strung along U.S. 550, which links Durango and
Montrose. Silverton lies 47 miles north of Durango on U.S. 550. Ouray is
a harrowing 26-mile drive north of Silverton, via the 11,008-foot-high Red
Mountain Pass on a stretch of Highway 550 known as The Million Dollar
Highway (it was once used to move lots of precious minerals out of
Silverton). Ouray is 37 miles south of Montrose.
During winter, Montrose Regional Airport (% 970-249-3203), has daily
service to and from Dallas/Fort Worth (American), Denver (United),
Houston (Continental), and Los Angeles (Continental), and Saturday-
only service to and from Newark (Continental) and Chicago (American).

Getting around Ouray and Silverton
These towns are tiny, so you shouldn’t have much trouble getting around.
Just park your car in the business district (where there’s free on-street
parking) and start walking. In Ouray, U.S. 550 becomes Main Street and
passes right through the heart of town. To locate Silverton’s main drag,
take Colorado 110 east from U.S. 550. Colorado 110 immediately becomes
Greene Street, which is Silverton’s main road.
Staying in Ouray and Silverton
These towns are fun places to sleep, with historic hotels and bed-and-
breakfasts in a variety of price ranges. Some have every conceivable
luxury; at the other extreme is one hotel whose staff names “running
water” as an amenity.
The Historic Western Hotel
$
Ouray
Some Victorian hotels — those with large-screen TVs, jetted hot tubs, and
steam showers, for example — just don’t seem all that Victorian. Well, you
won’t have any doubts about the authenticity of the 1891 Historic Western,
that rare Victorian hotel with historic plumbing, few modern amenities,
and a traditional floor plan. Fourteen guest rooms are in snug miners’
quarters with shared baths down the hall. The floors creak, the doors
catch on the doorjambs, and at least one room has its original wallpaper.
It feels as if the miners may arrive any minute. Historic Western does have
two suites with private baths, but even these aren’t what you’d expect. In
one, the clawfoot bathtub sits in the middle of the room, mere feet from the
bed. I love this place.
210 Seventh Ave. % 888-624-8403 or 970-325-4645. www.historicwestern
hotel.com. Rack rates: $35–$55 double with shared bath; $70–$105 suite with pri-
vate bath. DISC, MC, V.

Riverside Inn and Cabins
$
Ouray
This motel is popular with climbers spending time in Ouray. One look at
the rooms and you’ll know that climbers aren’t slumming as much as they
used to. Accommodations are decorated in rich earth tones and are down-
right luxurious, with large TVs, peeled-log furniture, and, best of all, the
soothing whitewater thrum of the Uncompahgre River. If you still want to
rough it, you can rent a riverside cabin with a double bed and two bunk
beds (but no linens or private toilet) on a nightly, weekly, or monthly basis.
The two owners can tell you about the boating, fishing, skiing, and climb-
ing in the area.

during holidays. AE, DISC, MC, V.
Villa Dallavalle Inn
$–$$
Silverton
The Dallavalle/Swanson family has owned this building for over 100 years,
and the inn reflects their long history in Silverton. Seven cozy and com-
fortable rooms are crammed with photos and heirlooms. A narrow
upstairs hallway is further constricted by trunks, sculptures, bookcases,
and display cases full of memorabilia — not to mention plastic flowers.
The innkeepers seem to have set aside a special little corner for every-
thing, including the guests.

The Wyman Hotel and Inn
$$
Silverton
This luxurious 1902 B&B is best known for its Elevator Room, inside of which
a two-person whirlpool tub nestles into the framework of the building’s old
elevator. (No, you can’t go up and down while you soak.) There’s also a lav-
ishly decorated guest room inside a caboose next to the hotel. Even if you
can’t reserve the elevator or the caboose, you can still enjoy the European
antiques, mountain views, and a staircase wide enough to accommodate
turn-of-the-century ball-goers. Rooms range in size from cozy to cavernous,
the largest being a three-room suite that sleeps six comfortably.

Dining in Ouray and Silverton
Ouray has great food and lots of variety, with a half-dozen or so quality
restaurants scattered along Main Street. The options are fewer in
Silverton, but you can still find a hearty meal at a reasonable price.
Buen Tiempo Restaurant
$–$$
Ouray
MEXICAN
Buen Tiempo charges muchos pesos for burritos, tacos, fajitas, and the
like, but at least the food is fresh and zippy. You dine in a high-ceilinged
room that’s divided by booths, on the sides of which are colorful carvings
of cacti. Once seated, you can crane your neck to see what may be the
world’s highest television screen. Give your server a dollar bill to stick on
the ceiling. It’s a stunt worth seeing, and your buck will be taken down
eventually and donated to charity.

Coachlight Restaurant and Tavern

Ouray
AMERICAN
Come to the Coachlight when you want a big steak, fish, or chicken dinner
with all the fixings, served by a low-key staff. Every dinner comes with
salad or soup, choice of potato or wild rice, and fresh brown bread. The
most popular dish is the Miner’s Filet, a lean steak that’s been served here
since the 1960s. The dining room has stained-glass windows from a con-
demned church and some of the most striking historic photos in town.
There’s also an upstairs tavern with a large deck.

Silverton
AMERICAN
Passengers on the Durango & Silverton Railway flock here at lunchtime
when they get off the train. Once inside, they have to let their eyes adjust
before they can make out the dark stone walls, hardwood floors, and six-
stool backroom bar that has surely witnessed volumes of history. The
lunch menu is geared for people who have a train to catch: sandwiches,
burgers, and salads. You can still get sandwiches and burgers at dinner, as
well as heartier entrees such as top sirloin steak and a black bean burrito
with rice and chicken.

Trail’s End Public House
$–$$
Silverton
ECLECTIC
Trail’s End looks like a barroom, but the food tastes nothing like bar fare.
The chef churns out rich, heart-warming entrees such as Jamaican jerk-
seared chicken and bacon-wrapped salmon as easily as other bars hand
out potato chips. If you just want an appetizer, you won’t be disappointed.
Among the selections are cheddar-potato-stuffed Anaheim chili rellenos,
sweet potato fries, Creole wings, and, yes, pretzels.

Exploring Ouray and Silverton
In these towns, make sure to immerse yourself in their history — and
hot springs.
The best things to see and do in Ouray and Silverton
Old Hundred Gold Mine Tour
The Old Hundred didn’t produce many precious minerals, but today it’s
one of the best mine tours in the state. The mine operated from 1967 to
1972 without turning a profit. Because it’s newer than most other area
mines, the guides here can fire up and demonstrate fully operational equip-
ment, such as pneumatic drills, slushers, and mucking machines. It’s really
loud. While learning about mining techniques, you can look around at the
tunnels, drifts, and rises, as well as veins of mineral-bearing white quartz.
Each tour, or “shift,” rides a narrow-gauge train into the mountainside and
spends about 40 minutes underground, in air that’s around 48 degrees.
Dress warmly!
Five miles northeast of Silverton on County Road 4-A. % 800-872-3009 or 970-387-
5444. www.minetour.com. Tours depart on the hour from 10 a.m.–4 p.m., May
10–Oct 13. Cost: $14.95 adults, $7.95 kids ages 5–12, $13.95 seniors 60 and over.
Orvis Hot Springs
After paying your $12 entrance fee and showering at Orvis Hot Springs,
you don your towel ($1 if rented) and walk a few yards to a 103-degree out-
door pond that’s 4 feet deep and about 40 feet across. Once there, you can
lose that towel and your worries, too. Wearing a bathing suit here is a little
like sporting a tux at Woodstock. Besides, your shape is no worse than the
other whales in the pod. Later, you can relax in an indoor tub, broil in the
small outdoor pool known as the “lobster pot” (temperature: about 110°),
or unwind further with a massage.
You can camp at Orvis for $20 per person, or check into one of six guest
rooms available for $89 each (the cost includes soaking for two days). The
rooms are spare but comfortable, and they share a bath. Each room has a
queen-size bed, a water tank, and plenty of towels, which should remind
you where you’re supposed to be spending your time.
Part V: The Western Slope and Southern Colorado 
328

On U.S. 550, 11⁄2 miles south of Highway 62, Ridgway. % 970-626-5324. www.orvis

kids 4–12.
Ouray County Museum
Rooms that once housed patients in an 1886 hospital now serve as win-
dows into Ouray’s past. From the looks of the place, Ouray not only had a
lot of sick and injured people at one time, it also had a lot going on. Today
the museum has an old jail cell, a simulated mine, an assay office, a min-
eral room (illuminated by fluorescent lights), a hospital kitchen, a railroad
room, an antique dentist’s office, and a huge collection of vintage toys, to
name just a few exhibits. Even the hallways brim with memorabilia from
Ouray’s past, including captivating photographs from the town’s mining
heyday. If you only go to one county museum in the course of your trav-
els, make it this one.
420 Sixth Ave., Ouray. % 970-325-4075. www.ouraycountyhistorical
society.org. Open: Summer daily 10 a.m.–noon, 2–6 p.m.; rest of year, call for
hours. Admission: $5 adults, $1 kids ages 6–12.
Ouray Hot Springs Pool
The Ouray Hot Springs Pool holds more than a million gallons of geother-
mally heated, but nonsulfuric, water. A lot of those gallons are in a lap pool
and a deep area with a diving board. The swimming areas are usually
heated to the 80-degree range, but there are other, hotter sections where
you can sit back and poach yourself, including one that runs 102 to 106
degrees. For an extra $2.50, you can also use the cardiovascular machines
and free weights in the fitness center.
Located on the west side of U.S. 550 at the north end of Ouray. % 970-325-4638.
Open: June–Aug daily 10 a.m.–10 p.m.; rest of year daily noon–9 p.m. Admission: $8.50
adults, $7 seniors 65 and over, $6 students 7–17, and $4 children 3–6.
Other things to see and do in Ouray and Silverton
If you start getting water-logged, you can dry off and try some of these
other activities:
 Go for a walking tour of Silverton or Ouray. Both these towns have
dozens of unspoiled turn-of-the-century Victorian buildings. Ouray’s
Visitor’s Guide, available at the visitor center next to the Ouray Hot
Springs Pool, maps out a 20-stop walking tour centered around Main
Street between Fourth and Eighth avenues. Silverton’s walking tour
is described in Silverton Magazine, available at the visitor center and
in businesses around town. There are about 50 stops on the tour,
each described in detail that falls just short of providing actual
family trees.
 Check out the San Juan County Museum. The museum (% 970-
387-5838) in Silverton isn’t as absorbing as the museum in Ouray,
Chapter 24: The Southwestern High Country 329

but it does occupy an old jail, so you can wander the cells and mug
for photos. The museum displays Derringer guns, minerals, and old
mining equipment, among other items. It’s behind the San Juan
County Courthouse, at the corner of 15thand Greene streets. The
museum is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily from Memorial Day
through mid-September, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. daily through mid-October.
Admission is $2.50 for adults, free for children 12 and under.
 Watch water fall. It’s hard to justify paying to see a waterfall when
so many nearby waterfalls are free. But the Box Canyon Falls Park
(% 970-325-4464), located on Oak Street above Third Avenue at
the southwest corner of Ouray, is convenient to town and has two
hiking trails near a powerful falls, so it may be worth the price. Plan
on hiking both trails if you come here. One trail is a 500-foot-long
route that crosses ledges dynamited into quartzite walls and goes
straight to the falls, which thunder through a slot in a rock wall.
The other, less-crowded trail climbs 175 rocky feet over the course
of 1⁄4 mile (one-way) to a bridge that crosses the canyon directly
above the falls. It’s open from May to mid-October, from 8 a.m. to
dusk. Admission is $3 adults, $2.50 seniors, $1.50 kids 5 to 12.
Taking Jeep tours in Ouray and Silverton
Over 500 miles of Jeep trails thread across the mountainsides surround-
ing Silverton and Ouray. Many lead to historic mines, and some eventu-
ally connect with other mining towns such as Ophir, Telluride, and Lake
City. Switzerland of America, 226 Seventh Ave. in Ouray (% 800-432-
JEEP or 970-325-4484; www.soajeep.com), offers ten different half- and
full-day Jeep tours on the roads around Ouray. The best time to go is
in late July or early August, when the wildflowers in the high-alpine
basins are in bloom. Tours range in cost from $50 to $105. Switzerland of
America also rents late-model Jeeps for a full day (cost: $130 per day).
Staying active in Ouray and Silverton
You can find a lot to do in the mountains here. Just make sure you have
a detailed map (which you can get from Switzerland of America), espe-
cially if you’re traveling on the Jeep roads or backcountry trails. Here
are some options:
 Fishing: You can find excellent fishing near both these towns. In
Silverton, some great holes are located along the Animas River
above town. Stop at Outdoor World, 1234 Greene St. (% 970-387-
5628), for licenses and information. Near Ouray, there’s good fish-
ing along the Uncompahgre River, as well as in countless mountain
streams and lakes, some of which require hiking. Call the Riverside
Inn and Cabins, 1805 N. Main St. (% 800-432-4170 or 970-325-4061),
if you need flies or advice on Ouray-area fishing.
 Hiking: On two sides of Ouray, trails climb steeply into the forest
and up to the tree line. These trails are fairly challenging, but mel-
lower options do exist. If you hike uphill from Main Street on Eighth
Part V: The Western Slope and Southern Colorado 
330

Avenue in Ouray, it’s only four blocks to Lower Cascade Falls, which
are just as pretty as the nearby Box Canyon Falls and cost nothing.
(Unfortunately, they sometimes dry up during late summer and early
fall, so this may be another case of getting what you pay for.) You can
also follow a wide, gentle, 1⁄2-mile trail alongside the Uncompahgre
River on the north end of town. Consult the Ouray County Trail Guide,
available at the visitor center, for more-detailed information on area
trails.
 Ice climbing: A few years ago, a leaky penstock (a water conduit
from a now-closed power company) on a canyon wall above the
Uncompahgre River south of Ouray became a frozen waterfall —
and a popular ice climbing spot. Savvy climbers theorized that
more leaks would create more routes, so they built a network of
pipes and spigots along the cliffs bordering the Uncompahgre.
During cold weather months, the Ouray Ice Park (% 970-325-4288;
www.ourayicepark.com) now offers 150 routes for climbers of
all skill levels. There’s no charge to climb, but you have to have a
helmet and crampons to be on the ice. All guiding in the area is
done through the ice park’s concessionaire, San Juan Mountain
Guides (% 970-325-4925; www.ourayclimbing.com). The park
starts at the junction of Third Avenue and Box Canyon Falls Road
and follows the river south to County Road 361. Even if you’re not
a climber yourself, it’s worth driving up there to watch.
 Ice skating: Ouray has an outdoor hockey rink that has free skating
during winter. The rink is at the north end of town alongside U.S.
550. For information on open skating hours and to rent skates, con-
tact the Ouray Hot Springs Pool (% 970-325-4638). In Silverton,
you can skate at Kendall Mountain Community Center (% 970-
387-5522).
Hitting the slopes in Ouray and Silverton
Fashioned after a black-on-yellow highway sign, the logo for Silverton
Mountain (% 970-387-5706; www.silvertonmountain.com) shows the
silhouette of a skier somersaulting down a mountainside. Like any effec-
tive highway sign, it’s both an accurate description and a warning. The
slopes at Silverton Mountain plummet at angles ranging from 33 degrees
(an expert slope) to 50 degrees (bordering on extreme). Partly because of
the challenging terrain, the owners require that all customers be guided.
Yet the price is surprisingly reasonable: For $119, you can sign up for a
day of guided, lift-served skiing on snow that compares in quality to the
seldom-skied fluff in the backcountry. The mountain’s staff uses explo-
sives to reduce the likelihood of avalanches, but you also need to carry
an avalanche beacon, shovel, and probe (available for rent for a modest
fee), just in case. The chairlift operates Thursday through Sunday, and
reservations are strongly recommended. If you don’t ski often and well,
this probably isn’t the right place for you. Just look at the sign.

Shopping in Ouray and Silverton
During summer, Ouray’s Main Street is a bustling shopping area. When
you’re there, don’t miss the Salsa Trade Company (% 970-325-4562)
at 640 Main Street. It has a wall’s worth of little-known hot sauces with
names like Third-Degree Burn, Nuclear Waste, and See Spot in Heat. At
520 Main St., you find Mouse’s Handmade Truffles (% 877-7WE-SHIP),
a store that fills two critical needs for travelers — gourmet chocolate
and inexpensive ($5 per hour) Internet access.
Silverton really has two shopping districts — one on Greene Street,
which used to be the respectable part of town, and the other a block
away on Blair Street, which was where the brothels, dance halls, and
opium dens used to be. To this day, the structures on Blair Street are
more ramshackle than on Greene Street, but some intriguing shops and
galleries are located there. My favorite shop in Silverton, though, is
Weathertop Wovens, 1335 Greene St. (% 970-387-5257), where two
artists weave jackets, pullovers, and other clothing while they look
after the store.
Finding nightlife in Ouray and Silverton
No bar will acquaint you with local culture like the Miner’s Tavern/
American Legion Post 14 at 1069 Greene St. in Silverton (% 970-387-

patrons look like they’ve been along for the whole ride. Sit down, order
an American pilsner, and start playing pull-tabs. If you get bored, you
can shoot pool, play darts or shuffleboard, or spin some tunes on the
jukebox. Cap it all off with a cup of dangerously black coffee.
Fast Facts: Ouray and Silverton

Durango
Nestled in the sun-drenched foothills of the San Juan Mountains, Durango
flourished in the late 19th century as a railroad town that helped move
minerals mined in Silverton. Today, the same 1881 rail line ferries more
than 200,000 tourists a year. The railroad long ago helped pay for the
many architectural landmarks in Durango’s historic downtown, and
today it helps support a bustling row of restaurants, bars, shops, and
hotels. A community of 14,000 people also thrives in this active town.
Sinewy cyclists careen across mountain bike trails in the piñon-juniper
and ponderosa-pine forests around town. Kayakers splash through the
whitewater of the Animas River, which flows through the community.
And, come winter, skiers search for powder on slopes of the nearby
Durango Mountain Resort. During the school year, students from Fort
Lewis College flood the downtown area on weekends. And ranchers still
run cattle on the rangeland south of town. Whether you come here for
the history, the recreation, or merely the sight of the red-rock cliffs sur-
rounding town, you’ll probably enjoy Durango.
Getting to Durango
Durango sits amid some rugged topography, so the trip to town is often
prettier than it is smooth.
Most people who drive through southwestern Colorado land in Durango
at some point. It’s 5 miles from the easternmost junction of U.S. 160 and
U.S. 550, which are two major routes through the region. (The roads join
one another for 5 miles, then part ways again at the southwest corner of
town.) U.S. 160 links Cortez (to the west) and I-25 (to the east). U.S. 550
joins Farmington, New Mexico (to the south), and Grand Junction (to the
north).
America West Airlines and United Express serve Durango/La Plata
County Airport (% 970-247-8143), 14 miles southeast of Durango on
Colorado 172. After landing, you can rent cars through Hertz, Avis,
National, Budget, and Dollar. For information on contacting individual
airlines and car-rental agencies, see the appendix.
Getting around Durango
Durango’s roads can be confusing. The main route through town is U.S.
160/550, which parallels the Animas River and, together with the river,
defines the southern edge of the community. At the southwest corner of
town, highways 160 and 550 part ways, with U.S. 160 continuing west out
of town to Cortez. U.S. 550, meanwhile, curves through town on Camino
Del Rio and Main Avenue and eventually leaves the north side of Durango
en route to Silverton and points beyond.
Chapter 24: The Southwestern High Country 333

Durango’s downtown area surrounds north-south Main Avenue between
College Drive and 15th Street. To get there, take Camino Del Rio north
from Highway 160 and then go right (east) on College Drive. Most of the
shops are right on Main Avenue, but parking can be scarce. Be sure to
carry some nickels, dimes, and quarters for the meters; an hour’s park-
ing costs 25¢. If you stay in the historic downtown, you can do most of
your shopping and dining without getting in the car. Pedestrians always
have the right of way in Durango, so be sure to take advantage of it.
If you prefer public transportation, the Durango Lift (% 970-259-5438),
a local bus system, travels three loops through town, weekdays from
7 a.m. to 7 p.m. year-round. The cost is 50¢ per ride.
Durango’s Main Avenue Trolley Service goes up and down Main Avenue,
hitting stops every 20 minutes or so. It’s not a real trolley; rather, it looks
like the offspring of a trolley and a bus. When the town is busy, you can
park at a lot north of the historic downtown and take the trolley into
town. During summer, it operates from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. During winter,
it runs from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. The cost is 50¢ per ride.
Durango Transportation (% 800-626-2066 or 970-259-4818) provides
taxi service.
Where to stay in Durango
Durango has three of the best-preserved historic hotels in western
Colorado. They’re brick-and-stone classics, all with hand-carved wood-
work and antiques inside, and all situated, naturally enough, in the his-
toric district, where you can hear the whistle of the Durango & Silverton
Railway (even when you don’t want to).
General Palmer Hotel
$$–$$$$
Durango
Like the nearby Strater Hotel, the General Palmer is an elegant, well-pre-
served 19th-century hotel in downtown Durango, but it’s smaller and more
subdued than its better-known counterpart. Unlike the Strater, there’s no
old-time saloon or restaurant on the premises, employees dress as if this
were the 21st century, and the furnishings include many reproductions.
Yet you’ll still sense the history here, and the depot for the Durango &
Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad is only a block away. My favorite relic is
the hotel’s 1910 Otis elevator, with a door that has to be opened and closed
by hand. If you plan to use your room mainly for sleeping, go for one of
the windowless, inside rooms. Cocooned from street noise, they’re sur-
prisingly restful — and a few bucks cheaper, too!

Leland House and Rochester Hotel
$$–$$$
Durango
If you love Westerns, saddle up and ride to the 1892 Rochester Hotel,
where each of the 15 guest rooms pays homage to a particular film. The
Viva Zapata room, for example, holds sombreros and Mexican clay pots;
the Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid room bears photos of Redford
and Newman back when they weren’t so long in the tooth. Located across
the street, The Leland House — owned by the same company as the
Rochester — is a restored 1927 apartment building. Being former apart-
ments, each guest unit has a kitchen, and some have extra rooms and sit-
ting areas. Each unit is named after a different person from Durango’s
history, someone you’ve probably never heard of. The kitchens and extra
space make Leland House a great place for families, but it’s not as much
fun as the Rochester Hotel. Check-in for both hotels is at the Leland House.

spend most of your time pursuing an active lifestyle here and little time
considering the décor, which varies from unit to unit depending on the
whims of the owners. The hotel and resort offer a variety of activities,
especially during summer. And with views of both the ski area and the
Twilight and West Needle mountains, the backdrop is hard to beat.

The Strater Hotel

Durango
This four-story hotel of red brick and ornate white stonework still domi-
nates the Durango skyline, much as it did 100 years ago. Just by looking at
it, you can tell that the Strater is the place to stay. Thanks to a succession
of owners who invested in it even during hard times, it never slipped into
disrepair and has always been elegant. Today, the hotel even employs a
master woodworker to look after its elaborate woods, including a
mahogany entryway, a front desk of solid pine, and the world’s largest col-
lection of Victorian walnut antiques. The hotel celebrates its history,
almost to a fault. Employees in turn-of-the-century period clothing show
Chapter 24: The Southwestern High Country 335

guests to rooms overlooking Durango’s thriving downtown. The guest
rooms are more antiquey than posh, but they’re comfortable. There’s also
a saloon with live entertainment, a restaurant, and a theater that presents
melodramas during summer.

Where to dine in Durango
I wouldn’t say you couldn’t find a bad meal in Durango because, with over
60 restaurants in town, some chef somewhere must cook a bad meal every
once in a while. But I’ve never had a bad meal here. Because this is a col-
lege town that also caters to wealthy tourists, the food choices run the
gamut from burrito joints and brewpubs to the finest of fine dining.
Cyprus Café
$$
Durango
WEST COAST/MEDITERRANEAN
At certain times of day, Cyprus Café seems aglow with light emanating from
the ceramic masks, castings, and urns, and from the claylike faux finish 
on the walls. Consisting largely of organic produce and meats, the food,
like the surroundings, blends the earthy and the sublime. You can choose
from entrees such as Salmon sto Fourno (fresh salmon, goat cheese, grape
leaves, and olive caper tapenade, baked in parchment paper) and lamb
meatball fettuccine, or opt for a creative salad. Cyprus Café is most fun on
summer nights when it opens its patio and features live jazz.

Exploring Durango
In Durango, you can spend a lot of time “training.” When you’ve ridden
the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad, you can work out on
the trails, on the river, or at the ski area.
The best things to see and do in Durango
Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad
Every morning from mid-May through late October, a 1923 coal-fired steam
locomotive pulls Victorian-era coaches out of Durango and uphill 45 miles
and 3,000 vertical feet to the historic mining town of Silverton. During
much of the three-and-a-half-hour trip, the train follows the Animas River
upstream, alternately dipping deep into gorges and traversing narrow
ledges high above the river. It stops for two hours in Silverton, where most
Chapter 24: The Southwestern High Country 337

people shop, eat lunch, and get in the way of locals. Then the train returns
to Durango. It’s one of the prettiest rides you’ll ever take, and the history
of the train and its surroundings can really make you feel as if you’ve
stepped back in time.
The full ride, however, takes about ten hours, which can seem like ten
years when you get tired. Unless you’re rabid for rails, I recommend spend-
ing the extra $5 to go either to or from Silverton via motor coach. This
shortens the trip by two hours and makes it less taxing.
You can choose other interesting ways to break up the trip if you have a
little extra time. You can make an overnight layover in Silverton, which has
historic hotels and a lively shopping district — not to mention beautiful
mountains and old mines all around. Or, you can get off the train at Elk
Park or Needleton and hike or backpack in remote areas of the San Juan
National Forest, including the Weminuche Wilderness, then flag down the
train again that afternoon or even a few days later. For more on hiking in
this area, contact the San Juan National Forest, 15 Burnett Court, Durango
(% 970-247-4874). More trains are added as business picks up, so you can
usually find a seat even if you don’t book ahead. During fall and winter, a
shorter, four-and-a-half-hour round-trip to Cascade Canyon is offered.
Lodging and tour discount packages are available; options and prices vary.

Other things to see and do in Durango
The train isn’t the only way to time-travel in Durango. You can step back
in history by visiting these area museums:
 Located in a three-story, 1904 schoolhouse, the Animas Museum,
3065 W. Second Ave., at 31st Street (% 970-259-2402), pays homage
to the history of Durango and its precursor, Animas City. Its ground
floor still houses a century-old classroom, which, if my experience
Part V: The Western Slope and Southern Colorado 
338

is typical, may look disturbingly similar to the classrooms of your
youth. Upstairs are exhibits on Native Americans, European settlers,
and the town itself. Next to the museum is a restored, furnished 1876
cabin. Summer hours run Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to
6 p.m. Winter hours are Wednesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to
4 p.m. Admission is $2.50 adults, free for kids under 12.
 Time magazine is said to have rated the Diamond Circle Melodrama
(% 877-325-3400 or 970-247-3400; www.diamondcirclemelodrama.
com) production as “one of the top three melodramas in the U.S.”
When or why Time magazine began rating melodramas, I’m not
sure. At any rate, this is fun stuff, and everyone gets to hiss at the
villain. It’s located at the corner of Seventh and Main streets inside
the Strater Hotel. Shows are Monday through Saturday nights from
June through August. Admission is $20 for adults, $15 for children
under 12.
Staying active in Durango
With mountains above, desert below, and a river through town, Durango
is perfect for year-round recreation. Visitors here often end up doing one
or more of the following:
 Golfing: Hillcrest Golf Course, 2300 Rim Dr. (% 970-247-1499),
next to Fort Lewis College, is Durango’s 18-hole municipal course.
This is a good public course with reasonable rates: $20 for 18 holes,
$10 for 9. There’s also a driving range and putting green on the
premises.
 Hiking: For information on hiking in and around Durango, including
some of the more-remote spots, call the Animas Ranger District
(% 970-247-4874).
 Mountain biking: This sport may not have been invented in
Durango, but it came of age here. And Mountain Bike Specialists,
949 Main Ave. (% 970-247-4066; www.mountainbikespecialists.
com), has absorbed a lot of the bumps along the way. The Mountain
Bike Hall of Fame is in Crested Butte, Colorado, but this store is sort
of a satellite version, with bikes and jerseys of famous riders such
as Juli Furtado, John Tomac, and Ned Overend mounted across the
upper walls. The shop can prepare you — mentally, at least — for
the challenging single-track trails surrounding town. It sells trail
guides and has maps available for either perusal or purchase. You
can rent a full suspension bike for $45 per day.
 River-rafting: During years when it snows (or rains), Durango has
great rafting right in the heart of town. Some of the top-flight kayak-
ers train on the Animas River right next to the town’s visitor center.
Above town, the Animas makes for extra-challenging boating, with
class IV and V rapids. Below town, it’s mellow enough to float on an
inflatable kayak. Durango Rivertrippers, 720 Main Ave. (% 800-
292-2885; www.durangorivertrippers.com), offers two-hour ($25)
and half-day ($35) trips on the Animas.

 Soaking and swimming: Located 9 miles north of town, Trimble
Hot Springs, 6475 County Rd. 203 (% 970-247-0111; www.trimble
hotsprings.com), has a large, warm swimming pool and even
warmer pools for soaking. The cost for soaking during summer is
$11 for adults, $7.50 for kids 12 and under; the rest of the year it’s
$9 for adults and $6.50 for kids.
Hitting the slopes in Durango
The 10,822-foot summit at Durango Mountain Resort (DMR) (% 800-
525-0892 or 970-247-9000; www.durangomountainresort.com) isn’t par-
ticularly high for a ski area so far south on the map. So the snowfall can
be hit or miss, even more so than at other areas. Nor is the mountain
enormous. It boasts a respectable 2,029-foot vertical drop, but the thrust
of the 1,200 skiable acres is more horizontal than vertical. But if you like
lots of warm sunshine, a resort where the bottom of the hill isn’t a life-
time away, and rolling intermediate terrain, DMR makes a fine choice.
You’ll enjoy the relaxed, open people. And if you’re a lukewarm skier
but a full-blown hedonist, you’ll love the resort’s Total Adventure Ticket,
a program that allows guests holding four- or more day lift-tickets to
exchange a day of lift-served skiing for activities such as cross-country
skiing, snowshoeing, star-viewing, hot springs, and even massages. See
the inside back cover for more information on DMR.
Shopping in Durango
If you want to tour Durango’s many art galleries, start at the Durango Art
Center, 802 E. Second Ave. (% 970-259-2606). Open Tuesday through
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., it has a large exhibit space that houses
traveling shows as well as group shows highlighting local and regional
artists. There’s also a small gift shop selling local art. When you’re done
browsing, the art center’s staff can help you identify local galleries that
have the type of art you like most.
Nightlife in Durango
With over 100 bottled beers and an additional 20 beers on tap, Lady
Falconburgh’s Barley Exchange, 640 Main Ave. (% 970-382-9664), boasts
one of the largest beer selections in the Southwest. The restaurant also
has single-malt scotches and other premium liquors, and it serves a popu-
lar Philly cheese steak sandwich. Scoot ’n’ Blues, 900 Main Ave. (% 970-
259-1400), books rock ’n’ roll, blues, and jazz acts and even has a weekly
karaoke night. The hot pickers and jam bands often perform at Haggard’s
Black Dog Tavern, 13544 County Rd. 240 (% 970-259-5657).
Springing off on a side trip to Pagosa Springs
In the past few years, folks have been flooding into Pagosa Springs —
just 59 miles east of Durango — to live. Archuleta County, where Pagosa
Springs is located, ranks among the fastest growing counties in America.
I recommend going there as a day trip to soak. Mineral-rich hot springs,

If all that bathing makes you hungry, Isabel’s, 20 Village Dr. (% 970-731-
5448), serves excellent fish, meat, pasta, and vegetarian dishes, but the
herb-crusted lamb chops are best of all. Main courses at dinnertime cost
$13 to $35.
If you order from the early-supper menu (available until 6:30 p.m.), you
can eat in style for under $10.
If you want to spend more than a day soaking up Pagosa’s atmosphere,
many of the rooms at the Springs Resort, 165 Hot Springs Blvd. (% 800-
225-0934 or 970-264-4168; www.pagosahotsprings.com), offer views of
the so-called mother spring, which spouts 142-degree water into a pool
behind the lodge. Everything around here smells a bit sulfurous, but you
won’t mind when you start soaking in the adjacent hot springs, included
with the room rate. If you tire of the healing waters, you can have your
skin moisturized at the spa or take a yoga class. As for the rooms them-
selves, they’re bright, pleasant, and restful. Rates at the inn range from
$105 to $189 for a double.

Mesa Verde and the Four Corners
Years ago, the Ancestral Puebloans — ancestors of the modern-day
Pueblo people — lived throughout the Four Corners area, including the
current location of Cortez. When they departed the area around A.D.
1300, the Puebloans left behind countless ruins and artifacts, the most
famous being the cliff dwellings inside Mesa Verde National Park, a few
miles southeast of town. Besides being a hotbed for archeologists, the
small towns of Cortez, Dolores, and Mancos offer respite from the heat
and serve as gateways to the mountains to the north and the deserts
beyond. And if you really want to visit the only place where you can
stand in four states at once (Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona),
head for the otherwise-unremarkable Four Corners Monument.
Getting there
The best way to get here from the east or west is via U.S. 160, which
spans all the way from I-25 in the east to the Grand Canyon area to the
southwest. If you’re traveling from the west on I-70, you can take U.S. 191
south to Monticello, Utah, then pick up U.S. 666 to Cortez. If you’re
coming from the east on I-70, you can pinball south on U.S. 50, U.S. 550,
Colorado 62, and Colorado 145. If you’re coming from the south, take
U.S. 666 north to Cortez from Gallup, New Mexico.
Great Lake Airlines (% 800-554-5111) offers service between Denver
and Cortez-Montezuma County Airport (% 970-565-9510), 11⁄2 miles
southwest of town on County Road G (via U.S. 160/666). Upon arriving in
Cortez, you can rent a car from Budget (% 800-527-0700), American
Auto Rentals (% 970-565-9168), or Enterprise (% 800-736-8222).
Getting around
You need to drive to travel in this territory. Most of the activity in Cortez
is on the east-west U.S. 160, which runs through town as Main Street. At
the west end of Cortez, U.S. 160 merges with north-south U.S. 666, or
Broadway Avenue, and heads south as U.S. 160/666. On the east side of
town, U.S. 160 crosses Colorado 145, which heads 11 miles north to
Dolores and then continues on to Telluride and Montrose. The entrance
to Mesa Verde National Park is 10 miles east of Cortez on U.S. 160. The
small town of Mancos is another 6 miles east of Mesa Verde on U.S. 160.

Mancos is situated just south of the highway. A business loop of U.S. 160
curves off the main highway and goes through downtown Mancos.
Where to stay
Cortez has a strip of chain hotels a few miles west of the entrance to
Mesa Verde. The area also has guest ranches, bed-and-breakfasts, and
historic hotels. Some lodgings are in the towns; others are in the high
desert countryside; and one is deep inside Mesa Verde National Park.
Bauer House Bed & Breakfast

Mancos
At this 1890s Victorian mansion, you’ll have a hard time deciding whether
to spend time inside or out. On the B&B’s 1.5 grassy acres, you can find a
putting green, a gazebo, and areas for bocce ball and croquet. Inside are
four guest rooms, each decorated with a different style of antiques. I like
the Wicker Room, full of antique wicker furniture. If you want to feel as if
you’re outside when you’re in your room, rent the third-floor penthouse.
Because of its wood paneling and 360-degree views of the Mancos Valley,
one recent guest called it a “cabin in the sky.”

The rooms at this motor lodge are old and smallish. Perched on a 9,100-

conies and large windows opening onto views of the surrounding mesas,
canyons, and mountains. The views alone make a stay here worthwhile,
but there are other advantages to staying inside the national park. If you
stay here, you can conveniently drive the Mesa Top Loop Drive right
before sunset, when the lighting is perfect and few people are around. You
can stargaze at Mesa Verde’s crystalline night sky and watch deer and wild
horses browse on the vegetation outside your room at dawn. Then, you
can take the first — and least crowded — ruins tours of the day.

Where to dine
A few restaurants in Cortez have borrowed a trick or two from the
restaurants a few miles to the southwest in Arizona. In one or two, you
may even find a green chili cheese steak. But heartburn is by no means
mandatory. You can eat well in this area without spending too much —
or paying later.

PIZZA AND SALADS
The smoke from the wood-fired pizza oven here is a better advertisement

ice casual and very friendly. The pizzas and calzones feature traditional
toppings, but with some original twists such as Kalamata olives and
Portobello mushrooms. They’re all hearty and filling after a long day on the
mesas. There’s an excellent selection of salads, including a Salmon Caesar,
and the beers are top-notch. Try the ESB, an excellent example of the type,
or the Schwartz Hacker, and exceptional Oktoberfest-style dark lager.

ECLECTIC
The owners of this microbrewery hope to improve public health through
beer consumption. Their motto is “Avoid heart attacks — drink beer.”
Their dinner menu equates beer with “life itself.” And their dessert menu
proposes an “amber bock or mild stout” as a “delicious and healthy” sub-
stitute for sins such as ice cream. Brewed by a real Bavarian brewmeister,
the medicine is hardly bitter; in fact, I recommend an extra dose of the
Schnozenboomer Amber Bock. The brewery also has some beer-worthy
food, including pasta, fish, steaks, burgers, and salads.

Even if it didn’t, you’d still need to get here to absorb the expansive views
out the restaurant windows. The offerings consist of traditional American

Exploring the world of the Ancestral Puebloans
Most of the ruins in this area were left by the Ancestral Puebloan (or
Anasazi) people, who lived in the Four Corners region from around A.D.
300 to 1300. The Ancestral Puebloans may have lived long ago, but they
weren’t primitive. They built multistory stone dwellings out in the open
and, later, under overhangs in cliffs. Plastered in bright colors, the cliff
dwellings were shaded in summer and sun-warmed in winter. In addition
to being capable architects, the Ancestral Puebloans domesticated ani-
mals, hunted for game, foraged for nuts, berries, and other foods, and
farmed corn, beans, and squash using sophisticated irrigation systems
that gathered water and conserved soils. They even used astronomy. If
you’re curious about their world, you’ll probably enjoy a few days in and
near Mesa Verde.
Getting started
Exploring Mesa Verde is more fun if you know a little about the Ancestral
Puebloans first. The spots listed here can help you get started:
 The Anasazi Heritage Center, 27501 Colorado 184 (% 970-882-5600;
www.co.blm.gov/ahc), 2 miles south of Dolores, has more than 3
million curated artifacts inside. Some of the most intriguing ones are
displayed in a timeline that explains how the culture of the Ancestral
Puebloans evolved. The Heritage Center also has a pit house replica;
interactive computer programs summing up the findings of different
archeological digs; and hands-on activities such as weaving, corn-
grinding, and using a microscope.
The Heritage Center serves as headquarters for the newly created
Canyons of the Ancients National Monument. If you’re planning
on visiting the monument, make sure to get information and maps
while you’re here. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. March
through October, and 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. November through February.
Admission is $3 adults 17 and over, and free for youths under 17.
 After you’re done inside the Anasazi Heritage Center, you can hike
a paved, 1⁄2-mile trail from the parking lot to Escalante Pueblo, a 12-
room dwelling with panoramic views. There’s always something spe-
cial about the places where the Puebloans built. Escalante Pueblo is
a perfect example of this.
 If you want to find out even more about the Ancestral Puebloans
(and about archeology) before going to Mesa Verde, take a one-day
class at the Crow Canyon Archeological Center, 23390 Road K,
Cortez (% 800-422-8975; www.crowcanyon.org). On Wednesdays
and Thursdays during the summer, you can take one-day courses
Chapter 24: The Southwestern High Country 345

(cost: $50 for adults, $25 for 18 and under) in which you handle and
interpret artifacts, tour the center’s laboratory, and visit a real dig.
You need to reserve a spot ahead of time. When not offering classes,
the center is not geared for visitors.
 The Cortez Cultural Center, 25 N. Market St. (% 970-565-1151;
www.cortezculturalcenter.org), in downtown Cortez, has a
museum, a gift shop, and a gallery with rotating displays. The best
time to visit is on summer evenings, when cultural programs are
offered in an outdoor amphitheater. These include Native American
dances, music, and even dramas. From June through August it’s
open daily from 10:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; from September through
May, it’s open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Admission is free.
Mesa Verde National Park
Simply put, this is the best place to view Ancestral Pueblo archeological
sites. It’s the largest archeological preserve in the country, with 4,000
sites ranging from pit houses to stunning, multistoried cliff dwellings
with towers, kivas (round, subterranean ceremonial chambers), and ter-
races. These dwellings, which appear almost as an outgrowth of the
earth, justify a special trip to southwest Colorado. The largest and best
known of them, Cliff Palace, has 217 rooms, 23 kivas, and a four-story
tower. Situated on a relatively pristine 9,000-foot-high mesa, Mesa Verde
also lets you absorb some of the natural splendor of the Southwest.
Mesa Verde isn’t a quick hit. It takes 45 minutes to get from the park
entrance to the Far View Visitor Center. The entrance road climbs
steadily for 14 miles and has corners too sharp for vehicles longer than
25 feet. From the visitor center, you need to drive another half-hour to
reach the park’s most popular archeological sites, Balcony House and
Cliff Palace, and an hour to reach Wetherill Mesa. Allow a full day to see
the park, more if you have time.
Here’s how to see the park efficiently:
 The only way you can get close to the largest cliff dwellings is by
going on a ranger-guided tour. Your first stop should be at the Far
View Visitor Center (% 970-529-5036) to buy tickets (cost: $2.75
per person), open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. from mid-April to mid-
October. Try to get there before noon, because the tours some-
times sell out. During spring, summer, and fall, you can go on a
guided tour of either Cliff Palace or Balcony House, but not both
on the same day. During summer only, you can also buy tickets for
a tour of Long House, which is on Wetherill Mesa (a very slow 12-
mile drive from the visitor center). All the tours involve walking
and climbing. The Balcony House tour is the most strenuous and —
some would say — most exciting. On it, you climb 90 vertical feet of
stairs, 32- and 20-foot long ladders, and slip through a narrow 10-
foot long crawl space.
Part V: The Western Slope and Southern Colorado 
346

 After buying your tickets, visit the Chapin Mesa Archeological
Museum (% 970-529-4631). This place is so old, it’s a historic build-
ing itself. It has an impressive collection of artifacts as well as diora-
mas showing life in Ancestral Puebloan communities. The museum
also has an information desk, and it serves as the park’s visitor
center during winter. While you’re in this area, take a short walk to
Spruce Tree House, which is the only large cliff dwelling you can
visit without going on a guided tour. During winter, it’s the only cliff
dwelling you can visit, period, open year-round 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
(until 6:30 p.m. mid-April to mid-October). Then, drive to the more
remote ruins.
 If you have tickets to a tour of Balcony House or Cliff Palace, drive
the Mesa Top Loop Drive, which consists of two 6-mile-long lasso-
shaped loops. Along these loops are ten parking areas. From each
parking area, you can take a short walk to mesa-top ruins or to
overlooks of the surrounding canyons. Cliff dwellings and granaries
are tucked into openings in the canyon walls, and you can see them
if you look carefully. If you have tickets for a tour of Cliff Palace or
Balcony House, try to time your drive so that you show up at the
tour’s meeting place at least ten minutes early. Along the way, don’t
miss Square Tower Overlook, where you can scan the canyon
walls for archeological sites, and the mysterious Sun Temple, a
windowless structure that may have been a prayer to the gods.
 If you have a ticket for a Long House tour, head out to Wetherill
Mesa. When you’re on the mesa, park your car and walk or take a
shuttle to the different dwellings and overlooks, including Long
House.
Chapter 24: The Southwestern High Country 347
Beating the crowds at Mesa Verde
It’s hard to contemplate life 1,000 years ago while surrounded by 21st-century people.
Mesa Verde can get crowded, but you can do a few things to give yourself a little time
alone with the past:
 Visit during May, June, or, best of all, October. During these months, you can still
see most of the ruins, but with fewer people around.
 If you come during summer, drive to Wetherill Mesa. Most park visitors don’t make
this trip, and it’s a beautiful area.
 Drive the Mesa Top Loop Drive right before sunset, after most visitors have
departed.
 Go on a guided tour of Cliff Palace or Balcony House first thing in the morning.
The first tours, at 9:00 and 9:30 a.m., seldom fill up. If you get to the Far View Visitor
Center soon after 8 a.m., you should be able to buy tickets and make it to the tour’s
meeting area on time.

If you have extra time, do the following:
 Go to places you haven’t yet visited. If you’ve been on the Mesa
Top Loop Drive, go to Wetherill Mesa, and vice versa.
 Go for a longer hike near Spruce Tree House. Two hiking loops
begin at Spruce Tree House: the 21⁄4-mile Spruce Canyon Trail,
which drops 500 feet to the bottom of Spruce Canyon, and the 21⁄3-
mile Petroglyph Point Trail, which has some rock art alongside it.
Before going, you need to register at the trailhead. If you only have
time for one, do the Petroglyph Point Trail.
Mesa Verde’s entrance is on U.S. 160, 10 miles east of Cortez. For park
information call % 970-529-4465 or surf the Internet to www.nps.gov/
meve. The park entrance is always open, but you aren’t allowed to visit
archeological sites after dusk. Admission is $10 per car.
Ute Mountain Tribal Park
If you want to see amazing cliff dwellings with fewer people around than
at Mesa Verde, go to the Ute Mountain Tribal Park (% 800-847-5485 or
970-749-1452; www.utemountainute.com/tribalpark.htm), a 125,000-
acre area bordering Mesa Verde. Located on the Ute Mountain Ute reser-
vation, the park has dwellings that are nearly as large as the grandest
ones in Mesa Verde. You can choose between half-day and full-day trips.
The half-day trip goes mostly to unexcavated sites littered with thou-
sands of potsherds (pieces of broken pottery). It’s much less strenuous
than the full-day trip, which goes to the same unexcavated sites and
then continues on to at least four well-preserved cliff dwellings.
The full-day tour is the only way to see the most spectacular cliff
dwellings, so be sure to take it if you visit the tribal park. The most stun-
ning cliff dwelling, Eagles Nest, is on a 75-foot-high ledge underneath a
large overhang. To get there, you need to climb a 30-foot ladder, among
other challenges.
Throughout the tour, the Ute guides discuss the Puebloans (who were
not related to the Utes) and the history of their tribe. A lot of driving
is involved — if you can, try to ride in the same vehicle with the guide,
so you can converse while you ride. And bring plenty of sunscreen and
water.
Tours meet at Ute Mountain Museum, 20 miles south of Cortez, at the
southernmost junction of U.S. 666 and U.S. 160. Tours are offered April
through October. The museum is open daily from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.,
from April through October. Half-day tours cost $20 per person; full day
tours cost $40 per person. Transportation provided by guide costs $6
extra per person. Reservations are required.
Remote sites
Mesa Verde and the Ute Mountain Tribal Park aren’t the only places in
southwestern Colorado where you can visit archeological sites. There
Part V: The Western Slope and Southern Colorado 
348

are thousands of other dwellings and artifacts scattered through the
area. Many are unexcavated mounds barely recognizable as past
dwellings. At least a few excavated sites are worth seeing if you don’t
mind taking long, dusty drives in the sticks. Here are two options:
 Hovenweep National Monument is best known for the remains
of towers that the Ancestral Puebloans built in this area between
A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1300. These towers may have been used for cere-
monies, signaling, storage, defense, living quarters, or observato-
ries. No one knows for certain, and part of the fun is coming up
with your own theories. Today, all the towers at Hovenweep have
either partly or entirely collapsed, but structures as high as 20 feet
remain. Eight obvious ones flank a 11⁄2-mile trail that travels along
the rim of Little Ruin Canyon. The trail takes one to two hours to
hike and has one short, steep stretch where it drops into, and
then climbs out of, Little Ruin Canyon. A less strenuous option is
the 1⁄2-mile Tower Point Loop, which takes about 30 minutes and
doesn’t require much climbing. To reach Hovenweep, take U.S. 160
south 2 miles to County Road G (where the airport is located), and
follow the signs. It takes about an hour to get there from Cortez. If
you go this way, you’ll be on paved roads all the way. The monu-
ment grounds are open daily year-round 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission
is $6 per vehicle. For more information, call the monument at
% 970-562-4282 or surf the Internet to www.nps.gov/hove.
 You can also visit widely scattered sites in the new Canyons of the
Ancients National Monument. Established in 2000, the 164,000-acre
monument has more than 5,000 documented archeological sites, and
the highest density of sites in the nation. One of the most interesting
is Lowry Pueblo, the remains of a pueblo-style dwelling that had 40
rooms and 9 kivas. Nearby is a Great Kiva spanning more than 54 feet
in diameter — one of the largest ones in this area. Toilets and picnic
tables are nearby. Lowry Pueblo is on County Road CC, 9 miles west
of Pleasant View, a small community 20 miles northeast of Cortez on
U.S. 666. For information on Lowry Pueblo and other sites inside
Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, contact or visit the
Anasazi Heritage Center (% 970-882-4811) at 27501 Colorado 184.
Guided tours of Mesa Verde National Park
Not everyone wants to zoom off into the desert Southwest in search
of far-flung archeological sites. For those who prefer extra guidance,
Aramark (% 800-449-2288 or 970-529-4421; www.visitmesaverde.com)
offers half-day and full-day motor coach tours of Mesa Verde National
Park. The tours stop at some of the most intriguing sites and overlooks,
save you from parking hassles, and include a ranger-guided walking tour
of a cliff dwelling. Morning half-day tours go to Spruce Tree House, after-
noon half-day tours go to Balcony House, and full-day tours go to Cliff
Palace.
Chapter 24: The Southwestern High Country 349

If you’re choosing between the two half-day tours, go for the afternoon
affair, because Balcony House is more fun to tour than Spruce Tree
House. (Besides, you can always do Spruce Tree House on your own.)
The motor-coach tours, which run from May to October, leave from Far
View Lodge. The morning tour costs $29 for adults, $28 for kids 5 to 17.
The afternoon tour costs $38.50 for adults, $27.50 for kids 5 to 17. The
full-day tour is $55.75 for adults, $43.75 for kids 5 to 17.
Other things to see and do
The offerings in this area aren’t limited to archeological sites. When
you’re done seeing the ruins, you can do the following:
 Relive the pioneer days, and then eat steak. Bartels’ Mancos Valley
Stage Line (% 800-365-3530 or 970-533-9857; www.thestagecoach.
com) will take you for a ride on a replica of the horse-drawn mud
coaches used throughout the West in the 1800s. Just like in the old
days, the ride is dusty and, despite the leather straps under the
coach that serve as shock absorbers, on the bumpy side. Three dif-
ferent tours are offered: The one-hour rides give you a taste of stage-
coach travel but not much more. You’re better off taking the lunch or
dinner tour. Each lasts about three and a half hours and includes a
meal at a peaceful old homestead deep inside a canyon near Mesa
Verde. The dinner tour costs a little more, but the meal consists of
steaks instead of sandwiches, the air is cooler, and you can catch the
sunset on the ride home. The rides start and finish at 4550 County
Rd. 41, and reservations are required. To get there, continue south
on Main Street for 5 miles past Mancos. The rides operate May
through September. Prices for the one-hour tour are $35 adults,
$17.50 kids 3 to 12; for the lunch tour it’s $55 adults, $27.50 kids 3
to 12; and for the dinner tour it’s $65 adults, $32.50 kids 3 to 12.
 Go for broke. Ute Mountain Casino (% 800-258-8007 or 970-565-
8800; www.utemountaincasino.com) offers slot, keno, and video
poker machines, as well as blackjack and poker tables. The casino

The actual Four Corners
If you’re just dying to take a picture of your kid with each limb in a different state, then
head southwest from Cortez following U.S. 160 for 40 miles to the very corner of the
state. You’ll have to go into the Navajo Reservation in New Mexico to get to the
entrance, but that’s where you find the Four Corners Monument. To be honest, it’s an
underwhelming experience; there’s a brass slab in a bed of concrete marking the
actual spot, and not much else. There’s no running water at the park, but there are
some shacks where Navajo vendors sell jewelry, crafts, and food. Admission is $3,
which is steep for what you get. Miss this, and you miss nothing.

Chapter 25
The High San Juans and 
the San Luis Valley
In This Chapter
 Great hiking and gruesome history in Lake City
 Taking in the theater at Creede
 Wolf Creek Pass and the Wolf Creek ski area
 Checking out Alamosa and the Great Sand Dunes
S
outh of I-70, tucked between the continental divide (to the west) and
the Front Range mountains, Pikes Peak, and the Sangre de Cristo
range (to the east), this region, loosely comprised of the San Luis Valley
and the eastern parts of the San Juan Mountains, has three easily over-
looked towns, each with its own treasures.
Lake City, a tiny, historic mining town, is 55 miles south of Gunnison in
the San Juan range. Lake San Cristobal, created when a mountainside
slumped into a river, is nearby, and the wildflower-strewn wilderness
stretches out, seemingly forever, across the high glacial valleys of this,
the most remote and wild part of the state.
When you drive into the tiny mountain town of Creede, you know immedi-
ately from the rows of Victorian homes and mine shacks that the town has
a rich past. Given its population of just 300, you wouldn’t expect it to have
a top-notch repertory theater, too. The Creede Repertory Theater is a
risk-taking ensemble that flourishes in the smallest of towns. In a state
known more for its outdoor recreation than its indoor culture, Creede Rep
is a gem.
Alamosa appears to be just another agricultural community — that is,
until you come across the 350-foot-high sand dunes and the geothermal
springs a few miles away on the valley floor. Depressed 20 years ago, this
former railroad hub has been revitalized, thanks in part to an influx of
river runners and artists.

Lake City
In the San Juan range, Lake City’s few year-round residents live quietly
just downstream of Lake San Cristobal, the second largest natural body
of water in Colorado. It’s incredibly secluded — a hiker’s paradise — and
there’s some extremely colorful local history.
Getting to Lake City
Lake City is 55 miles southwest of Gunnison. From Gunnison, take U.S. 50
west for 9 miles and then go 46 miles south on Colorado 149. If you con-
tinue southeast past Lake City on Colorado 149, you’ll cross the conti-
nental divide and then follow the course of the Rio Grande River down
to Creede (46 miles from Lake City) and, beyond that, the San Luis Valley
(via U.S. 160 east).
Getting around Lake City
In Lake City, Colorado 149 runs north and south through town as
Gunnison Avenue, the town’s main road.
Where to stay in Lake City
Lake City can be expensive during July and August, but it’s a bargain for
most of the rest of the year. The listing below is the best of a small hand-
ful in the town proper.
Matterhorn Mountain Motel
$
Lake City
You can tell this motel is a half-century old by looking at its vintage neon
sign — it was grandfathered in when Lake City banned other, similar signs.
Inside, the rooms have showers instead of tubs, but everything else is
modern. Fully remodeled in 2000, all have barn-wood furniture and large
windows, and they’re inviting. The rooms have either a queen-size bed and
full kitchen or two queens and no kitchen. If you’re here for a romantic get-
away, spend the extra $5 per night for a cottage. They’re roomy and pri-
vate, and sleep two people comfortably — not counting Fido, who’s also
welcome here. The motel sits on a hillside just above dusty, sleepy, down-
town Lake City.

Where to dine in Lake City
Lake City’s beauty lures a few skilled chefs who try to cash in on a very
short tourist season. You can also find moderately priced, family fare.

Charlie P’s is in a building that has been a morgue, cigar factory, and
bakery. Nowadays it produces barbeque, burgers, five different chicken
dishes, and some tasty Tex-Mex fare, among other offerings. The food is
consistently palatable, and the low prices attract a stream of (living)
locals. The restaurant has a large patio where you can watch the occa-
sional car or pedestrian pass by on Lake City’s main drag.

Lake City
FRENCH
Chef Bruno, who runs this place, once served as banquet chef at New York
City’s famous Tavern on the Green. In the twilight of Bruno’s career, a
friend invited him to cook at this small country inn 2 miles south of Lake
City, and, fortunately for us, he’s still here. Chef Bruno keeps the menu
small. Most nights, he cooks a single veal, pork, fish, and beef dish, each
with a classic French sauce. He hopes you’ll have some wine, too. You can
tell he loves the fermented grape juice — the place overflows with mag-
nums and wine bottles, empty and full, including a few that hold candles.
It’s a pretty romantic spot.

Exploring Lake City
Most of the best things in this area are outside in the mountains, but
there’s also a lot of human history in each town. Even if you’re not a
mountain person, you can find plenty to do.
The best things to see and do in Lake City
When you’re not in the wilderness surrounding the Gunnison Valley, you
can sample the following:
 Spring a lake. Lake San Cristobal, 3 miles north of Lake City, is
dammed like most other lakes in Colorado — only in this case the
dam is natural. About 700 years ago, a huge earthflow of partly
decomposed volcanic rock slumped into the Lake Fork of the
Gunnison River, stalling enough water to create the second largest
natural body of water in Colorado (behind Grand Lake, southwest
of Rocky Mountain National Park). Come here to camp, picnic, and
savor the forested hills around still water. Wupperman Campground
offers first-come, first-served camping (cost: $10 per car) on County
Road 33 on the lake’s southeast side. Lakeview Resort (% 800-456-
0170 or 970-944-2401), also on County Road 33 on the lake’s east
Chapter 25: The High San Juans and the San Luis Valley 355

side, rents fishing boats (cost: $45/half-day), pontoon boats
($80/half-day), and sea kayaks ($45/half-day). Personal watercraft
(such as jetskis) are forbidden here, because the lake is very small.
 Shop. Lake City is folksy (think: chainsaw sculptures and quilted
wall-hangings).
 Drive a Jeep. Lake City is one of those places where people who
don’t mountain bike should rent a Jeep and spend a day bouncing
up into the stratosphere. Leaving from the downtown, you can
rumble over 12,800-foot Engineer Pass to Ouray, meander up the
San Juan Skyway (U.S. 550) to Silverton, and lurch your way back to
Lake City via 12,600-foot Cimarron Pass. Except for U.S. 550, these
roads are part of the Alpine Loop Backcountry Byway, which trav-
els 65 miles through the San Juan high country, passing ghost

Alferd Packer, the Colorado Cannibal
Turns out Lake City is famous for its dining, but I don’t recommend trying to take part
in any “traditions” here. In February of 1874, a man named Alferd Packer and five other
men wandered into the San Juans from Montrose, prospecting for silver and gold.
Despite warnings about the weather from the Utes who lived nearby, they could not
wait to get their hands on a claim, so they headed off into the mountains south of
Gunnison with food and supplies for ten days.
Two months later, only Packer returned. He initially claimed that, as the weather wors-
ened, members of the group died one by one; later he changed his story and admitted
that things had turned murderous, but that he had only killed in self defense. He did,
though, admit to eating his companions’ remains in order to survive. His story didn’t
hold up, though, and in August five bodies were found near the present-day Lake City.
Packer managed to escape from the jail in Saguache and was a fugitive for nine years;
he was eventually caught, tried and sentenced, tried and sentenced again, and impris-
oned for 16 years. With the help of a reporter from the Denver Post, he made another
impassioned public plea of innocence, became a cause célèbre, and was granted
clemency. He died in Deer Creek Canyon and was buried in a military cemetery in
Littleton, south of Denver.
His legend and the debate about his guilt or innocence continued to grow; the stu-
dents at Colorado University in Boulder named the cafeteria there the Alferd Packer
Memorial Grill and for years had an Alferd Packer Festival, the main event of which
was a raw meat-eating contest! In 1981, Governor Dick Lamm stirred up controversy
by denying a posthumous pardon; and in 1989 the remains of Packer’s victims were
found buried two miles south of Lake City, and examined by forensics experts. The
results were somewhat inconclusive, but seem to point toward cold-blooded murder,
followed by a snowy feast.
You can find out more about Packer at the Hinsdale County Museum, 130 Silver St., at
the corner of 2nd Street (% 970-944-2050), and visit a memorial for his victims at the
site of the alleged murder, 2 miles south of town on Highway 149.

Creede
If you go over Slumgullion Pass from Lake City, you eventually reach
Creede, a former silver-mining town at the mouth of a shadowy box
canyon (a canyon that’s closed on three sides). Above the town, spectac-
ular old mine buildings seem to cling to the dark walls of Willow Creek

Staying active in Lake City
The immense mountains around Lake City naturally challenge visitors.
One great hike or mountain-bike ride, which should take you most of a
day (pack water and a lunch), is the Wager Gulch Trail, which takes you
up some pretty challenging terrain, through the ghost town of Carson,
and to the ridge of the continental divide. To get there, take Colorado
149 south from Lake City and turn right on the road to Lake San Cristobal.
Follow this road 4 miles; the pavement ends, but you continue 5 more
miles to the trail head. Look for the sign for Wager Gulch/Carson on the
left. The trail is fairly steep for the first mile and a half, then levels out as
you approach Carson, which, you should know, is private property. You
can peek around, but don’t touch. Continue another mile and a half to the
divide, for a total of about 43⁄4 miles. This is classic glacier landscaping,
and you can see the 13,657-foot Carson Peak to the west, and the head-
waters of the Rio Grande on the other side.
Fast Facts: Lake City

Canyon. The Rio Grande passes just below town. It’s popular among fish-
ers and boaters, and the surrounding forests lure outdoorsmen and ath-
letes. With just 300 year-round residents, Creede is the type of place
where businesses open their doors whenever an employee happens to
be around — and that’s not very often during the off-season. In summer,
however, visitors cram into the tiny downtown area to experience its
unspoiled Victorian architecture and one of the West’s finest repertory
theater companies.
Getting to Creede
United Express (% 800-241-6522) offers daily service between Denver
and Alamosa-San Luis Valley Regional Airport (% 719-589-9446), 3 miles
south of town on U.S. 285.
Upon landing, you can rent a car through Budget (% 719-589-0103) or
L & M Auto Rental (% 719-589-4651). For a cab, call Lil Stinkers Taxi
Service (% 719-589-2500).
To reach Creede from Alamosa, drive 47 miles west on U.S. 160, then go
22 miles on Colorado 149 west. If you continue past Creede on Colorado
149, it’s 48 miles to Lake City.
Getting around Creede
Colorado 149 makes a giant U-turn in Creede’s downtown area. It heads
straight into town and toward Willow Creek Canyon, then (wisely) dou-
bles back toward the valley carved by the Rio Grande. There’s free park-
ing in the small downtown area. There’s no mass transit, so you’ll have
to drive, walk, or ride.
Where to stay in Creede
You won’t find chain properties in Creede, but you can choose between
guest ranches, historic hotels, B&Bs, and family-run motels. The prices
in this area generally run a little lower than in other parts of the Rockies.
Antlers Rio Grande Lodge
$$
Creede
Most of the accommodations at this guest ranch are flush on the banks of
the Rio Grande River. They have no phones or televisions, but the splash-
ing of the river more than substitutes. If you cross the Rio Grande via the
suspension bridge near the lodge, you’re immediately on National Forest
land, and you can climb as far and as high into the mountains as you
please. You can also fish for trout without leaving the property. I like the
cabins best. Rented in one-week blocks during summer, each has a full
kitchen, living area, and porch. The motel rooms share a riverside deck,
have kitchenettes, and are smaller than the cabins. The ranch also has a
fine restaurant that offers dining both indoors and on a riverside deck.

roasted chicken. The hotel changed hands in 2002, but its restaurant still
enjoys a stellar reputation.

Exploring Creede
Creede is world famous for its repertory theatre, but set aside another
day or two to explore the nearby mines and mountains.
Underground Mining Museum
Before driving the Bachelor Historic Tour (described in the next listing),
go to this museum. That way, you’ll know what transpired in all the old
mine buildings you see on your drive. Located in an old mine tunnel near
the mouth of Willow Creek Canyon, this museum displays mining equip-
ment, memorabilia, and the precious rocks that attracted so much atten-
tion in the late 1800s. Alongside each display, interpretive panels explain
how miners extracted and moved ore. This may not sound riveting on
paper, but the underground setting makes the experience more chilling.
Most tours are self-guided, but sometimes former miners take groups
through the museum.
In Willow Creek Canyon, at the north edge of Creede. % 719-658-0811. Self-guided
tours: $6 adults, $5 seniors over 60, $4 kids ages 6–12. Guided tours: $10 for all ages.
Hours vary so call ahead for opening times and tour information.
Bachelor Historic Tour
This 17-mile driving tour, which begins and ends in Creede, passes dozens
of 19th-century mine buildings that look as if they were built yesterday.
Propped against and perched atop dark cliffs, these wooden structures
seem to exist outside both gravity and time.
Before starting out, stop at the Creede/Mineral County Chamber of
Commerce (% 800-327-2102 or 719-658-2374) on Main Street at the north
end of town and pick up the 25-page booklet explaining the numbered
stops along the road (cost: $1). Then proceed up Willow Creek Canyon at
the north end of town. The most impressive structures are in the first 2
miles of the drive.
Even if you don’t want to do the full tour, consider driving as far as the
Commodore Mine (Stop No. 2). Beyond that point, the mines become less

spectacular and the mountain scenery steals the show. Allow at least an
hour for the whole loop. When dry, the road is passable (barely) for two-
wheel-drive vehicles, but steep grades, bumps, and curves slow you down.
If the road is wet, consider doing the loop backward — this lets you
descend the steepest grades instead of climbing them. You can also rent a
Jeep for $115 per day from Continental Divide Services (% 719-658-2682).
Staying active in Creede
There’s great hiking around Creede. Mineral County consists of 96 per-
cent public land and has two wilderness areas. For maps and information
on area hikes, stop by the Creede Ranger Station (% 719-658-2556) on
South Main Street or duck into San Juan Sports, 102 S. Main St. (% 719-
658-2359).
Culture in Creede
In 1966, the Creede Repertory Theater, 124 N. Main St. (% 866-658-2540
or 719-658-2540; www.creederep.org), opened shop as part of an eco-
nomic development project for what was then a depressed mining town.
Today this company of around 15 actors is one of the top performing-arts
groups in the state. (As for the town, it’s doing a lot better, too.) From
June through September every year, the company stages eight or more
different plays — and as many as five in a single week — spread over two
stages. The summer performances are mostly classics, and they sell out
during the peak months of July and August. In early fall, the theater
switches to riskier material, including regional and world premieres. The
company announces its schedule for the next season in the fall of the pre-
vious year, and season tickets go on sale January 1.
If you think you may stay in Creede for a week or more, consider buying
a ticket package in order to get the best seats. The least expensive pack-
age includes tickets to three Main Stage plays, which you could conceiv-
ably use in a week. Individual tickets go on sale May 1. Tickets to Main
Stage shows cost $16 to $24. General admission to the more intimate
Black Box theater, where the productions are smaller and possibly more
experimental, is $19 to $22.
Hitting the slopes in Creede
It’s down the road a ways from Creede, on U.S. 160 between Del Norte
and Pagosa Springs near the top of Wolf Creek Pass, but there’s some
good skiing down here. With the entire ski area above 10,000 feet and the
summit at 11,900 feet, Wolf Creek (% 970-264-5639; www.wolfcreek
ski.com) averages 450 inches of snow a year, easily the highest total
in the state. The abundant snow usually lets Wolf Creek open in mid-
November, long before most other resorts get rolling, and it keeps skiers
and riders knee-deep in powder for much of the winter. As for the ter-
rain’s 1,600 skiable acres, it’s a mixed bag, with some nice glades, but
there aren’t many long, consistently steep slopes.
Chapter 25: The High San Juans and the San Luis Valley 361

Alamosa and the San Luis Valley
Alamosa is an agricultural and railroad community that could pass for
Anywhere, USA. Yet it sits in the San Luis Valley, one of the most curious
spots in the state. Bordered by the San Juan Mountains to the west and
the Sangre de Cristo range to the east, the 50-mile-wide, 100-mile-long
valley would be steep-walled and deep if tons of sediment hadn’t washed
into it from the mountains through the ages. Today the sandy valley floor
is nearly flat. Through that floor, artesian springs bubble up, creating wet-
lands and geothermal pools in an otherwise arid area.
The culture in the Valley, like much of the rest of southern Colorado, is
very New Mexican in flavor and attitude. This was the northernmost
extent of the Spanish colonial conquest in North America — El Norte —
and many of the area’s residents consider themselves Españoles, not
Hispanic, and certainly not Mexican. You can notice the remnants of
Spain’s ambitions in some of the place names: Del Norte on the western
side of the Valley, and Salida — doorway or gateway — at the top of the
pass leading north into the Arkansas Valley.
You can watch waterfowl in some of the wetlands or soak in certain
pools yourself. When the wind blows, it transports sand from the west
side of the valley to the east, adding to the wavelike dunes more than
750 feet high inside Great Sand Dunes National Park, one of Colorado’s
best treasures.

Exploring Alamosa and the San Luis Valley
Even by Colorado standards, there’s a lot to do in this area. Besides the
usual (glorious) hikes and fishing holes, you can somersault down a sand
dune and feed alligators. Yes, alligators.
The best things to see and do
The can’t-miss attraction in this area is Great Sand Dunes National
Monument and Preserve. Go to the monument first, then choose some
other activities in the San Luis Valley.
Great Sand Dunes National Monument and Preserve
The sight of 750-foot-high sand dunes on the otherwise flat floor of the San
Luis Valley is flat-out bizarre. Washed down from the San Juans by the Rio
Grande and blown across the valley by steady west-to-east winds, the sand
has piled up across a 39-square-mile area at the base of the Sangre de
Cristo Mountains, on the east side of the valley. Now the dunes are part of
Great Sand Dunes National Monument and Preserve. Wind has sculpted
them into striking shapes, with gradual ramps on the windward side and
steep slopes on the lee side. For finishing touches, it etches delicate ridges,
ripples, and waves in the sand.
To enjoy the dunes, stop first at the visitor center to view displays on the
area. Then, drive to the Dunes parking area, hike a quarter-mile across the
flats to the dunes, and start climbing, preferably when it’s not hot or
stormy. Wear closed-top shoes on hot days and carry plenty of water. The
summit of High Dune is only about 11⁄4 miles from the parking lot, but the
deep sand will slow you. When you reach the top, have fun! You can run,
jump, roll, snowboard, or ride a saucer downhill.

Alamosa National Wildlife Refuge
Flanked on the west by the Rio Grande, the wetlands at Alamosa National
Wildlife Refuge (% 719-589-4021) are a sanctuary to mallards, Canada
geese, avocets, egrets, herons, and eagles, among other species. The best
times to visit are spring and fall, when many migrating birds stop over. You
can watch them from an overlook or stroll down a riverside trail. To reach
the refuge, go 4 miles east of Alamosa on U.S. 160, then south 3 miles on El
Rancho Lane. Visitor center hours are Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m.

Especially for kids
Colorado Alligator Farm
The Colorado Alligator Farm is above all a fish farm, raising tilapia in geo-
thermal pools on the property. In 1987, the owners bought a few baby alli-
gators to eat the fish byproducts. People started coming to see the
reptiles, and some began dropping off exotic pets that had outgrown tanks
in private homes. Now the place crawls with alligators up to 11 feet and
other scary critters like monitor lizards, caiman, and snakes. You can fish
for carp (cost: $10, including admission) in pools on the property and then
feed the fish to the gators. Adults can also sign up for gator wrestling class,
taught by a man with badly scarred arms.

Ten Signature Colorado
Experiences
In This Chapter
 Actually getting Rocky Mountain high
 Soaking au naturel
 Experiencing Broncomania and other football madness
 Tossing back a beer
M
ost people have a pretty good idea of what they’re after in
Colorado — be it casting flies for trout, taking in the urban hustle
of Denver, or laying down a carve in the powder of some back bowl. So
I imagine you already have the big picture of what your trip will be like.
This chapter lists, in no particular order, a few experiences that can put
your trip over the top. Some are broad in scope and can be done in
many parts of the state, while others are site-specific. Whatever your
itinerary, throw a few of these into the mix, and they’ll add that certain
something to make your vacation really memorable.
Summitting a Fourteener — on Foot 
or (If You Must) by Car
Colorado has 58 different points recognized by the United States
Geological Survey as topping 14,000 feet above sea level, and you
owe it to yourself to get to one of them. This is the elevation at which
Katharine Lee Bates wrote “America the Beautiful” (atop Pikes Peak),
and when you get there, you’ll know why. On a clear day, you can’t see
forever, but you may see 100 miles or so. The vistas of the high plains or
the glacier-carved valleys of the High Country are, in no uncertain terms,
breathtaking. Mount Elbert, the highest in Colorado at 14,433 feet, can
be easily summitted and descended on foot in a day, if you get an early
start and try in late July or August. And plenty of other peaks are waiting
to test your mountaineering skills to the max. Remember to be off the
peak by early afternoon (when thunderstorms tend to rumble in) and go
easy on yourself if you’re prone to altitude sickness. And if worst comes

to worst, you can just drive: Both Mount Evans and Pikes Peak have
good, if popular, roads that go all the way to the top.
Riding the Ski Train to Winter Park
It can be crowded, and the schedule isn’t very flexible, but this is far and
away the most civilized way to get to my favorite ski area. Let’s face it,
trains are an anachronism in America these days, so this throwback to
the past is like an extended, mellow roller-coaster ride. It’s exciting to
board the train early at Union Station in Denver’s LoDo, and the hyp-
notic snaking of the train up the snowy canyons of the Front Range is
intoxicating. All the while, you’re in the good company of fellow powder-
seekers looking forward to a day on the slopes. And when the ride’s
over, you ski! The trip home is relaxing as you peel off your boots and
get ready for dinner in downtown Denver. Ah, the life. . . .
Dropping Trou and Soaking in a Hot Spring
Not all of us have spent a lot of time naked around strangers. So you
may need to take a minute or two to get used to the idea of being sans
clothing at one of Colorado’s clothing-optional hot springs. Take that
minute or two, then remove your garments — if necessary, do it in a
dressing room or tipi when no one’s looking — grab a towel, and make
your way towards the blissful pool of your choice. Trust me, soaking in
the buff won’t start you down a slippery slope leading to biker rallies,
Steppenwolf medleys, and rowdy sex. When you climb into a natural hot
spring au naturel, you realize that there’s nothing left to protect you and,
better yet, no need to be protected. The springs are there to warm and
comfort you, the crystalline air hangs above, and there’s nothing to get
between you and your own personal bliss.
Taking in a Concert at Red Rocks
The natural sandstone amphitheatre at Red Rocks Park just west of
Denver is home to some of the best musical memories of the last two
generations. This was where U2 recorded Under a Blood Red Sky and
where many, many legendary Grateful Dead shows went down. The
acoustics are nearly perfect, and the ace sound crew takes care of the
rest; it’s a Front Range tradition to take the afternoon off, get to the park
as early as possible (to get in line for the good general admission seats
down front), and let the party begin. If rock ’n roll isn’t your speed, the
Colorado Symphony plays here regularly, and there’s a spectacular
Easter sunrise service.

Dining on Native Game
Truthfully, now, how many hamburgers do you really remember? Or for
that matter, how many steaks or plates of chicken cordon blah blah blah
did you bite into and think, “Now, there’s something different!” This state
is full of restaurants that want you to try the elk, venison, quail, and
pheasant, and if I hear that you read this book and got through Colorado
without eating buffalo, well, honestly . . . I don’t know what I’ll do. But it
won’t be nice. Seriously, this is what dining in Colorado is all about: a
hot plate of savory local game, cooked by someone who knows how to
cook it, in a chef’s special sauce that will make your taste buds dance
to a whole new rhythm. You’ll even find rattlesnake and bear on some
menus. And for something really unforgettable, ask for the Rocky
Mountain oysters.
Cowboy Up at the Stock Show
If you’re near Denver in January, don’t miss a chance to see the Old and
New West rolled into one in the biggest cowboy party you’ve ever seen.
The National Western Stock Show, Rodeo & Horse Show is a great place
to see all the ranching traditions — as well as the latest technologies —
and catch first-class professional rodeo shows, buy a real Stetson, and
see more exotic livestock than you ever dreamed of (and believe me,
there are some funny-looking cows out there). The Mexican rodeo per-
formances are an absolute must: They’re more colorful, they offer more
about showmanship and pomp-and-circumstance than the gringo ver-
sion, and they show the real cultural roots of the cowboy tradition in
North America. It’s a can’t-miss.
Go from the Sublime to the 
Ridiculous in Glitter Gulch
If, come January, you find yourself on the other side of the Great Divide,
Wintersköl in Aspen is your best bet for some cold, hard fun. From the
music performances to the wacky costumed ski-jump competitions, you
can find plenty of boisterous fun. And when the sun goes down and it
gets dark on the mountainside, the torch-bearers descending the moun-
tain on skis, like volcano lava in a winter wonderland, will leave you
breathless but serene. Then you go inside and party some more . . . and
get up the next morning and ski the best terrain on Earth. Any ques-
tions? I didn’t think so.
Chapter 26: Ten Signature Colorado Experiences 371

Goooooooo, Broncos!!!!!
I admit, it’s not quite like the old days, when people would paint their
houses orange and blue during the playoffs. (Really. No kidding.) But we
Coloradans love our Broncos, even if John Elway has retired and glorious
old Mile High Stadium is now a parking lot for the new, high-tech Invesco
Field. Season tickets are passed down in wills here, and the season sells
out long before you have a ghost of a chance of actually buying a ticket at
the box office. But, if you’re a pigskin fan, and if you have a friend who
knows someone whose boss’s sister has a spare ticket, do whatever you
have to do to get to a game. Show up hours early for the Gathering of the
Tribe (also known as the tailgate party) and get ready for an exciting ride.
Denver’s fans are the most passionate in America (sorry, Green Bay, but
it’s true, and by the way — we beat you in the Super Bowl, too), and if the
visiting team is the hated Oakland Raiders, look out. You won’t be disap-
pointed. Of course, if you can’t get tickets and have to see the game at a
bar (and you can see the game at darn near any bar, not just the sports
bars), you’ll be surrounded by faithful fans who scream at the TV as if
they were in the first row at the stadium.
In Boulder, of course, Saturdays in fall belong to the CU Buffaloes, while
the Colorado State Rams hold sway in Fort Collins, and the Air Force
Academy Falcons rule Colorado Springs. They’re all good teams with
great fans.
Sampling a Colorado Microbrew (Or Two)
Okay, I devote the entire next chapter of the book to this topic, but even
if you’re not a beer aficionado, you should give yourself a chance to try a
beer that’s not watered-down and tasteless, like most of the big American
megabeers. Colorado has more microbreweries than any other state, and
nearly every town has a brewpub; each pub has its own style and range
of brews, so there’s bound to be something to suit your taste, from the
sweet and fruity wheat beers to the dark, rich stouts and porters. Be fore-
warned, however: The alcohol content usually runs a little higher than in
regular beer, and your body won’t burn it off as fast, either, when you’re
high above sea level. So don’t be surprised if you find yourself talking a
little funny after one or two. Don’t worry if you do — you’ve just picked
up a Colorado accent.
Getting off the Beaten Track — 
without Getting Lost
Colorado has so much wide-open space that even if you come for the
skiing or the urban throngs, you’ll still be able to suddenly find yourself
completely, blissfully alone, be it in one of the mountain parks outside
Denver or up some unnamed road in the mountains or the Western
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
372

Slope. And of course, lots of people come for this purpose only. To just
stop moving for a second and simply listen to the wind in the fir trees,
the trickle of a canyon stream, or the call of an elk or coyote, while the
aspens and columbines waver in the breeze or the sun sets over sage-
brush and sandstone — this is as much the central Colorado experience
as any double-diamond run or crazy football game. Remember to take
water, know how to use a map and compass when you need them, and
don’t let your gas gauge go below a quarter of a tank. If you use common
sense and have a healthy taste for adventure, the sky is truly the limit in
Colorado.
Chapter 26: Ten Signature Colorado Experiences 373

Chapter 27
Beer, Beer, Beer — Ten
Breweries and Their
Signature Brews
In This Chapter
 Recapping a brief history of American beer
 Reading about ten companies that are rewriting that history
B
efore Prohibition, every American city was dotted with small, local
breweries that produced hand-crafted, old-world style beers that
reflected the personalities of their makers and the tastes of the local pop-
ulation. The 18th Amendment, though, changed all that: The art and sci-
ence of brewing were driven underground, and even into a black market.
I have one old friend who grew up on Denver’s old North Side whose
mother used to brew a small batch every month to help make ends meet
during the Depression! In 1933, though, Prohibition was repealed, and
large corporations such as Coors and Anheuser Busch were quick to set
up shop and dominate the market that smaller brewers could not afford
to restart in; they made (and still make) beer the way McDonald’s makes
burgers. The bland, weak American macrobrew was born. The cheapest
and easiest to produce were the very light Pilsner-style lagers, and brew-
ing ales, stouts, and darker lagers became a lost art in this country.
That’s all changing, though. Led by regions such as the Rockies and the
Pacific Northwest, microbreweries are making a comeback. Today,
Colorado has more breweries than any other state (including two big
ones: Coors in Golden and Budweiser in Fort Collins). In this state, you’ll
find every kind of beer you can imagine (and plenty you’d never even
dream of). The beers all have colorful labels and even more colorful
names, often reflecting local color: Fat Tire, for example, showed up in
the early ’90s when mountain biking was sweeping the state.
What follows in this chapter is a smattering of the most successful and
popular breweries in the state, along with a few that are just personal
favorites. Some breweries serve their beers only in their own pubs;

others distribute their brews as widely as possible — you can find many
of the beers mentioned here in grocery stores. If you want to taste a
number of beers without reliving some college frat-house nightmare, the
brewpubs all offer taste sizes and samplers of several different brews.
This list is selective, not exhaustive; you can find many other amazing
beers throughout the state, and I encourage you to try as many as possi-
ble, as long as you’re not driving afterward!
The Wynkoop Brewing Company, Denver
Denver’s first brewpub, this establishment launched the LoDo revolu-
tion. Wynkoop has 15 to 20 beers on tap at any given time, including a
home-brewed root beer (for youngsters and designated drivers). The
flagship of the fleet is Railyard Ale, a rich, malty Oktoberfest–style beer,
though the St. Charles ESB is my personal favorite here. Also notewor-
thy are the Sage-Brush Stout and Patty’s Chile Beer (infused with mild
Anaheim chiles!) The Phantom Canyon Brewery in Colorado Springs is
part of the same organization.
New Belgium Brewery, Fort Collins
New Belgium dominates the Colorado beer scene like no one (except
Coors) with the Front Range’s favorite microbrew, Fat Tire Amber Ale.
New Belgium works very much in the Trappist Ale tradition, and you’ll
say a thankful prayer when you taste the Trippel Ale or Abbey Ale.
Sunshine Wheat is a very popular “white” style of beer, brewed with
wheat instead of barley, perfect for hot summer days or lighter appetites.
Breckenridge Brewery, Denver
and Breckenridge
This brewery and pub started in Breckenridge, but quickly expanded
operations to Denver, which offered more room to grow. The main brew,
Avalanche Ale, is lighter and a bit more bracing than Fat Tire, though
it’s still full-bodied and malty. My favorite beer here is the Trademark
Pale Ale — hoppy and refreshing. The Honey Blonde is not as sweet as
it sounds, and the Oatmeal Stout is dark, but dry and smooth.
Odell Brewing Company, Fort Collins
Ah, Odell. Away from home, I dream of you: The 90 Shilling Scottish-style
ale is my favorite beer on the planet. Hands down. Malty, complex, good
alone or with food. What more could you ask for? The Cutthroat Porter
and Cutthroat Pale are mighty fine, too; they’re both solid English-style
beers that appeal to your darker and lighter sides, respectively.
Chapter 27: Ten Breweries and Their Signature Brews 375

Walnut Brewery, Boulder
The Walnut Brewery makes the popular and ubiquitous Buffalo Gold —
look out, Nebraska fans. If you like big American pilsners, try the Indian
Peaks Pale Ale; it’s very pale, but still way more flavorful than anything
you can get out of a can. The St. James Irish Red, though, is the cream
of the Walnut’s crop; it’s an award-winner, highly carbonated and malty,
and an ideal accompaniment to most of the pub food served here.
Flying Dog Brewery, Denver
This brewery began its life in Aspen, reputedly with the help of Hunter S.
Thompson; his old partner-in-crime, Ralph Steadman, designs the very
distinctive labels. The Doggie Style Pale Ale is my favorite of the brews
from here, but the In Heat Wheat and Horn Dog Barley Wine sure are
fun to order. The latter is a very dark, rich beer that ensures you will not
do anything important afterwards. Be careful, here.
Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery, Boulder
For Deadheads and those who love them, Mountain Sun backs up its
cheap Mexican-style food with some really fun beers. The Colorado
Kind Ale is extremely hoppy, if you’re into that sort of thing, and the
Raspberry Wheat beer is a great example of the type; at one point when
I was in college here, every brewery had a raspberry wheat. This is the
best, though, and that’s why it’s outlasted the fad. The pub has a rotat-
ing selection of beers from other local and national breweries, as well,
so come thirsty.
Golden City Brewery, Golden
Billing itself as the “second largest brewery in Golden,” Golden City made
its reputation with Golden City Red, a malty, rich red ale. Golden City
has many seasonal brews and often several fruit beers worth checking
out, especially the Double Cherry. The pub is in a residential neighbor-
hood, so dining here is a lot like hanging out in the backyard. And it’s
definitely the best beer you’ll taste in Golden.
Ska Brewing Company, Durango
Down at the other end of the state, Ska holds its own with its Pinstripe
Red Ale and True Blonde Ale, either of which are great with burgers —
and the Pinstripe holds up well against the fiery Mexican food you find
in the area. The Buster Nut Brown Ale is a fine example of this tradi-
tional English style. The beers are available all over the Durango area.

Dolores River Brewery, Dolores
I saved what may be the best for last: This tiny pub, tucked inside the
tiny town of Dolores, opened its doors in 2002, and it’s a revelation.
The ESB is an excellent example of the type of brew offered: full-bodied,
not too bitter, and very smooth. And the Schwartz Hacker, a dark
Oktoberfest–style lager, is exceptional. The Stout is great for the cool
mountain nights, and a rotating variety of cask-conditioned beers have
proved to be very popular as well. If you’re anywhere near the Four
Corners, it’s worth a detour to this amazing little pub.

Quick Concierge
T
his handy section condenses all the practical and pertinent infor-
mation — from crucial phone numbers to ATM locations — you
need to have a successful and stress-free vacation. And if you believe
there is no such thing as being too prepared, I list a bunch of addi-
tional information sources for you to consult. Best of all, you don’t
need to tip this concierge — although I won’t refuse if you insist.
AAA
Members of the American Automobile
Association can call % 800-AAA-HELP
for 24-hour emergency road service any-
where in the United States. AAA has
offices in a half-dozen Colorado cities
east of the continental divide. Offices in
Durango and Grand Junction serve west-
ern Colorado. To get exact addresses, log
on to www.aaa.com.
American Express
American Express has a full-service
office in downtown Denver at 555 17th St.
(% 303-383-5050). Additional locations in
Denver, Boulder, Centennial, Englewood,
Fort Collins, and Steamboat Springs offer
select American Express services. For
cardholder services and exact office loca-
tions, call % 800-528-4800. To report lost
or stolen checks, dial % 800-221-7282.
ATMs
Most Colorado banks and large food
stores have automated teller machines
connected to the major ATM networks;
so do many convenience stores. To
locate an ATM near your location, con-
tact MasterCard/Cirrus (% 800-424-7787;
www.mastercard.com) or Visa/Plus
(% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com). If
you withdraw money from an ATM not
affiliated with your bank, you’re generally
charged a service fee.
Business Hours
In Denver, most small stores open by
9 a.m. and operate until 5 or 6 p.m. Stores
in Colorado’s resort communities start
and finish their business day an hour or
two later, allowing proprietors to capital-
ize on the dinner crowd.
Most Colorado banks do business on
weekdays from at least 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.;
the branches in cities often tack on
evening and weekend hours. Similarly, the
supermarkets in cities often stay open for
24 hours; small-town grocers generally
close around 10 p.m. and don’t reopen
Colorado A to Z: Facts at Your Fingertips

Colorado & the Rockies For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
380
until 7 or 8 a.m. Small-town restaurants
close by 10 p.m. — or five minutes before
you get there, whichever comes first.
Credit Cards
If your credit card is lost or stolen, call the
issuer of your card immediately. To contact
American Express, call % 800-528-4800.
For MasterCard, dial % 800-307-7309. And
the number for Visa is % 800-847-2911.
Doctors
Colorado’s beauty has attracted top-flight
physicians to some surprisingly far-flung
locales. So, don’t assume that the medical
care is inferior just because you’re in the
sticks. If you need to see a physician in a
nonemergency situation, check with your
insurer about your conditions of coverage.
If your hotel has a concierge, he or she
may be able to recommend a local physi-
cian if you become ill. If the quality of
care still worries you, go to www.best
doctors.com. For $7.95 per month, Best
Doctors provides subscribers with refer-
rals to physicians who score high in peer
evaluations.
Drugstores
Two chain drugstores — Walgreens
(% 800-WALGREENS or 800-289-2273;
www.walgreens.com) and Longs
(% 800-865-6647; www.longs.com) —
have a strong presence in Colorado. There’s
a 24-hour Walgreens pharmacy in Denver at
3000 East Colfax Ave. (% 303-331-0815).
Large food stores such as Albertsons
(% 888-746-7252; www.albertsons.
com) and King Soopers (% 801-974-1400;
www.smithsfoodanddrug.com) often
have their own pharmacies. And you can
still find some independent pharmacies in
the state as well.
Emergencies
For fire department, police, or ambulance
assistance, call % 911. From hotels and
motels, you may need to dial % 9-911.
Fishing
Before you can legally start casting for any
of Colorado’s 80 fish species, you need to
obtain a fishing permit from the Colorado
Division of Wildlife. An annual permit costs
$40.25 for nonresidents, $20.25 for resi-
dents. Five-day and one-day permits cost
$18.25 and $5.25, respectively, for residents
and nonresidents alike. Permits are avail-
able at local sporting goods stores and
at Colorado Division of Wildlife (www.
wildlife.state.co.us) offices.
Health
Don’t be fooled: Colorado has the nation’s
highest skin cancer rates! If you don’t pro-
tect yourself in the mountains, you can
become sunburned, dehydrated, and
hypothermic — sometimes all in the same
day. Exposure to the sun’s burning rays
increases with elevation. When spending
time in the mountains, wear sunblock and
sunglasses, even when it seems cloudy.
Hydration helps prevent heat-related ill-
ness, hypothermia, and altitude sickness
alike. In the dry air, you may not realize
how much water you’re losing, so drink up!
If you’re coming from sea level, allow your-
self a few days (at least) to rest and accli-
mate before you start exerting yourself in
the mountains. Try starting your trip some-
where — Denver’s a good choice —
that’s a little lower in elevation. To avoid
hypothermia, wear multiple layers of syn-
thetic fabrics such as polar fleece and
polypropylene, plus a water-resistant outer
layer, and, of course, take shelter from
wind and rain if you do begin shivering.

Appendix: Quick Concierge 381
Information
For Colorado information, start by contact-
ing the Colorado Tourism Office (% 800
COLORADO; www.colorado.com). See
“Finding More Information” at the end of
this chapter for more details.
Liquor Laws
You must be 21 to consume alcoholic bev-
erages in Colorado. If you do imbibe, don’t
drive. Colorado has some of the nation’s
strictest standards for drunk driving. If
your blood alcohol content tops 0.05 per-
cent, you can be charged with driving
while intoxicated; if it passes 0.10 percent,
the more serious charge of driving under
the influence applies.
Colorado law allows bars to stay open
from 7 a.m. until 2 a.m. daily; liquor stores
can do business from 7 a.m. to midnight,
Monday through Saturday. Liquor stores
are the only retail outlets for full-strength
beer, wine, and liquor. Grocery stores, gas
stations, and convenience stores sell beer
and wine coolers, but the alcohol content
of these beverages cannot legally exceed
3.2 percent by weight.
Mail
You can call % 800-275-8777 to find the
location of the post office nearest you, but
first you need to know which zip code
you’re in. You can receive mail by having
it addressed to your name and “General
Delivery,” care of the post office of your
choice. You have one month from the date
the post office receives it to claim General
Delivery mail.
Maps
For driving directions, go to www.
mapquest.com or, if you’re a member
of the American Automobile Association
(% 800-541-9902; www.aaa.com), stop
by the nearest AAA office.
If you’re planning to explore the backcoun-
try, United States Geological Survey (USGS)
topographical maps can be a lifesaver. You
can usually find these maps (cost: $6 per
map, plus $5 handling per order) at local
Forest Service offices and sporting goods
stores. Or, you can buy directly from the
USGS by calling % 888-ASK-USGS or surf-
ing the Internet to www.usgs.gov. Denver,
luckily, is actually the source of most of
these maps: You can visit the USGS itself at
the Earth Science Information Center (ESIC)
on the grounds of the Denver Federal
Center. Take 6th Avenue west to Kipling
Street in Lakewood, head south to Gate #1,
and tell the guards at the gate you want the
map store.
Newspapers
The two major metropolitan daily news-
papers in Colorado are the Denver Post
and Rocky Mountain News. Both offer
comprehensive coverage of local, state,
and national news. Another 18 daily and 31
weekly newspapers report news in smaller
cities and towns throughout Colorado. For
arts and entertainment coverage, however,
you can often do better by picking up an
alternative newspaper such as Boulder
Weekly (www.boulderweekly.com) 
and Westword in Denver (www.west
word.com).
Safety
Allow extra time to travel on mountain
roads, especially during storms. If you plan
on hiking in the mountains, be sure to carry
extra clothing, food, water, and a topo-
graphical map of the area. As you walk,
memorize landmarks and terrain features,
including the ones behind you, so that you
can find your way back if you get con-
fused. During winter, people unfamiliar
with avalanche conditions and terrain
should not go out unless they hire a guide
before venturing into the backcountry.

Colorado & the Rockies For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
382
Smoking
Despite Colorado’s reputation for having an
active lifestyle (and despite its relative lack
of oxygen), over 20 percent of Colorado
adults smoke, just 1 percent under the
national average. Colorado’s state govern-
ment encourages restaurants to develop
separate nonsmoking areas, but doesn’t
mandate these areas. Many cities and
towns, however, have passed ordinances
that limit smoking. Denver prohibits smok-
ing in restaurants that don’t have separate,
well-ventilated areas for puffing, and it
limits smoking to designated areas in
venues such as sports stadiums and muse-
ums. Boulder has banned smoking in all
restaurants. Because ordinances vary from
town to town, smokers should look for ash-
trays before lighting up. And if you want to
buy tobacco, you must be 18 years old to do
so in Colorado.
Taxes
In addition to Colorado’s 2.9 percent state
sales tax, you may be asked to pay city
sales taxes of up to 4 percent and county
sales taxes of up to 5 percent. In most
Colorado locales, the total sales tax is
between 6 and 9 percent. Some areas levy
an additional tax (usually around 2 percent)
on hotel rooms. Cars rented at Denver
International Airport are subject to a $2.98
per-day usage fee and a 10 percent tax
designed to recoup the cost of building the
airport.
Time Zone
Colorado is located in the mountain stan-
dard time zone, two hours behind New
York City and one hour ahead of Los
Angeles. From the first Sunday in April
through the last Saturday in October,
Colorado observes daylight saving time.
Weather Updates
The National Weather Service Web site
(www.nws.noaa.gov) provides current
weather forecasts and information for
every part of America. You need only
type in the zip code of the area that inter-
ests you.
During winter, the Colorado Avalanche
Information Center (% 303-275-5360;
www.geosurvey.state.co.us/
avalanche) provides recorded informa-
tion on current avalanche conditions
and mountain weather. The Colorado
Department of Transportation (% 303-
639-1111) provides recorded updates on
road conditions throughout the state.

Finding More Information
I packed this book with a lot of information, but if you still want more,
you can consult the following resources to get more advice and tips on
planning your vacation to Colorado.
Tourist information
For planning information, start by contacting the Colorado Tourism
Office, 1127 Pennsylvania St., Denver, CO 80203 (% 800-COLORADO;
www.colorado.com). The office answers questions and mails out free
Colorado Ski Country and Official State Vacation guides.
For a free Official Visitors Guide to Denver, contact the Denver Metro
Convention and Visitors Bureau, 1668 Larimer St., Denver, CO 80202
(% 303-892-1112; www.denver.org). The guide has extensive informa-
tion on hotels, attractions, and dining in and around Denver.
Useful Web sites
The Rocky Mountain News keeps past and present stories on its Web
site (www.insidedenver.com), as well as links to what it considers the
100 best Web sites in Colorado. Denver’s alternative weekly Westword
(www.westword.com) has an online calendar of upcoming events.
For information on Denver’s cultural attractions and events, surf the
Internet to www.artstozoo.org. Click Discounts and Free Tickets for
info on cheap last-minute tickets to performances.
State guides
Frommer’s Colorado is an excellent complement to this book. If guide-
books were food, this one would be french fries and Frommer’s Colorado
would be a steak. In other words, Frommer’s Colorado is a lot more beefy

Colorado & the Rockies For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
386
and nourishing, and you can chew on it for a lot longer. Ideally, you’ll
still want some fries with it, just ’cause they’re fun to eat. Frommer’s
Guide to Rocky Mountain National Park is a must if you’re spending
more than a day there.
