About the Authors
Jerome Levine, MD: Jerome Levine is a board-certifi ed psychiatrist whose 
research and clinical career has spanned almost 50 years. For a major portion 
of that time, Dr. Levine served as chief of psychopharmacology at the National 
Institute of Mental Health. There, he worked both nationally and internationally 
to help design, manage, and conduct much of the federally supported research 
that serves as the foundation for current approaches to the pharmacologic 
treatment of schizophrenia and other serious mental disorders.
After leaving the federal government, Dr. Levine joined the faculty of 
the University of Maryland Department of Psychiatry and the Maryland 
Psychiatric Research Center. Both settings treat and carry out treatment 
studies of hospitalized and community-based individuals diagnosed with 
schizophrenia. In Maryland, he also directed a program training early-career 
psychiatrists to become research psychiatrists.
In 1994, Dr. Levine moved to New York State, where he joined the faculty of 
the Department of Psychiatry of the New York University School of Medicine 
as a professor of psychiatry, and was appointed deputy director of the NYS 
Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research. He oversees research 
studying the causes, pathophysiology, and treatment of schizophrenia at 
basic, translational, and applied clinical levels.
Dr. Levine’s residency training was at the State University of New York 
at Buffalo Department of Psychiatry and at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital in 
Washington, D.C. In addition, he has served on the faculty at the U.S. Public 
Health Service Narcotic Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky; at the Johns 
Hopkins Department of Psychiatry in Baltimore, Maryland; and at the 
University of Pisa Department of Psychiatry in Italy.
He has published numerous papers and books in the scientifi c lit-
erature and is a life fellow of the prestigious American College of 
Neuropsychopharmacology. In addition to being listed in Who’s Who in 
America, Dr. Levine was awarded the American Psychiatric Association 
Hofheimer Research Prize and the Distinguished Leader in Research Award 
from the National Alliance on Mental Illness of New York State.
Irene S. Levine, PhD: Irene Levine has a doctoral degree in clinical psych-
ology as well as extensive experience working in the public mental health 
system at local, state, and national levels. She began her career as a staff 
psychologist and treatment team leader at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center and 
left to develop and direct two nonprofi t psychosocial rehabilitation programs 
in Queens and Suffolk counties in New York.

For a period of more than 15 years, Dr. Levine held senior management roles 
at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the Substance Abuse and 
Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in Rockville, Maryland. She 
was one of the architects of the NIMH Community Support Program, created 
and directed the NIMH Program for the Homeless Mentally Ill, and served as 
the fi rst deputy director of the SAMHSA Center for Mental Health Services.
In 1994, Dr. Levine joined the Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric 
Research in Orangeburg, New York, where she directs communications and 
serves as the institute’s liaison to families. She holds a faculty appointment 
as a professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine. 
She has lectured locally, nationally and internationally about the needs of 
families of individuals with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia 
and major mood disorders.
For the past ten years, Dr. Levine has also been a prolifi c, award-winning 
freelance journalist and author, whose credits include some of the nation’s 
top magazines and newspapers. She writes on mental health as well as a 
wide range of other health and lifestyle topics, and is currently completing a 
book on female friendships for Overlook Press (2009). She is a member of the 
American Psychological Association, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, 
the National Association of Science Writers, the Association of Healthcare 
Journalists, the American Medical Writers Association, the Authors Guild, 
and the American Society of Journalists and Authors.

Dedication
We dedicate this book to all the courageous individuals with serious mental 
illness and their families that we have met through the years, who have taught 
us invaluable lessons that we never learned in school. We also dedicate this 
book to the individuals who volunteer as research participants in the interest 
of helping others learn about the causes of and treatments for schizophrenia.
This book is also dedicated to our own families who have enriched our lives 
in ways too numerous to mention, and especially to our son, Andrew, who has 
been an ongoing source of pride as well as 24/7 technical computer support.
Finally, this book is dedicated to the memory of Max Schneier, one of the 
earliest pioneers of the family advocacy movement, who taught us about the 
importance of listening to the wisdom of family members.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge some of our professional colleagues, many of 
them our personal friends, who have dedicated their lives to improving treat-
ment and care for individuals with schizophrenia. The knowledge upon which 
this book is based is derived, in no small measure, from their contributions. 
They include: MaryJane Alexander, MD; Thomas Ban, MD; Robert Cancro, 
MD; William T. Carpenter, MD; Giovanni B. Cassano, MD; Leslie Citrome, MD, 
MPH; Jonathan O. Cole, MD; Areta Crowell, PhD; Lynn DeLisi, MD; Joel Elkes, 
MD; Laurie Flynn; Risa Fox, MSW; Alan Gelenberg, MD; Howard Goldman, 
MD; Michael Hogan, PhD; Ron Honberg, JD; Samuel Keith, MD; Daniel Javitt, 
MD, PhD; John Kane, MD; Harold Koplewicz, MD; Alan Leshner, PhD; Robert 
P. Liberman, MD; Jeffrey Lieberman, MD; Linda Ligenza, MSW; Arnold M. 
Ludwig, MD; Dolores Malaspina, MD; Herbert Meltzer, MD; Stuart Moss, MLS; 
Fred Osher, MD; Herbert Pardes, MD; Nadine Revheim, PhD; Linda Rosenberg, 
MSW; Nina R. Schooler, PhD; Steven S. Sharfstein, MD; John Talbott, MD; Fuller 
Torrey, MD; Judith Turner-Crowson; and Peter Weiden, MD. Although these 
individuals have infl uenced our writing and our careers, such an eclectic group 
would not necessarily agree with everything we’ve written.
We are profoundly indebted to the members of the National Alliance on 
Mental Illness, especially Rena Finkelstein, Helen Klein, and other members of 
NAMI-FAMILYA of Rockland County, New York, for their inspiration and col-
laboration over the years.
Lastly, we appreciate the support of Michael Lewis, of Wiley Publishing, and 
Elizabeth Kuball and Sharon Perkins, who shepherded us through this proj-
ect. Thanks also to our agent, Marilyn Allen, who served as a matchmaker 
and cheerleader.

Introduction
S
chizophrenia affects as many as 1 in 100 Americans over their lifetime 
and is twice as common as HIV/AIDS. Yet few other diseases are 
shrouded in quite as much misinformation, lack of information, and secrecy 
as schizophrenia is. On average, it takes more than eight years between the 
time symptoms first appear and the time a person is diagnosed and treated 
for the disorder. Pervasive stigma keeps most people in the dark until the 
disorder becomes up close and personal. As a result, when someone you 
love is diagnosed with schizophrenia — a no-fault, equal-opportunity brain 
disorder — you’re not sure where to turn or who to tell. Initially, most 
people feel ashamed, bewildered, and alone.
During our careers working in various research, policy, and clinical roles 
at federal, state, and local levels, people with schizophrenia and their loved 
ones often asked us questions. We always tried to provide simple, straightfor-
ward answers, but we never have enough time to present the big picture — 
to answer their questions in a larger, more understandable context.
So we decided to write this book. This book distills what we’ve learned and 
read over our combined 85+ years in the field of mental health — and just as 
important, the valuable lessons we’ve been taught by patients and families 
during that time. In these pages, we give you immediate access to tools and 
information that otherwise might take you a much longer time to acquire.
We strongly believe that only through improved public awareness and 
enhanced mental-health literacy can society reverse the stigma and discrimi-
nation that stands in the way of finding cures and helping people with 
schizophrenia lead the full lives they deserve.
About This Book
Our goal in writing this book is to help demystify a long-misunderstood 
illness. We want this book to be your go-to primer to better understand:
 
 What schizophrenia is and what it is not
 
 What causes schizophrenia and what does not
 
 Why and how diagnoses are made
 
 How schizophrenia can be treated

2
Schizophrenia For Dummies 
 
 What barriers exist to treatment and care, and how you and your loved 
one can overcome them
 
 How consumers, families, friends, and professionals can work together 
to enhance the chances for recovery and quality of life for people with 
schizophrenia
 
 What other resources are available to help patients and their loved ones 
cope with the disorder
Conventions Used in This Book
We don’t use many conventions in this book, but to help you access the 
information you need we do use the following:
 
 Whenever we introduce a new technical term, we italicize it and then 
define it.
 
 Web addresses and e-mail addresses appear in monofont to help 
them stand out. When this book was printed, some Web addresses may 
have needed to break across two lines of text. If that happened, rest 
assured that we haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) 
to indicate the break. So, when using one of these Web addresses, just 
type in exactly what you see in this book, pretending as though the line 
break doesn’t exist.
 
 We try to avoid language that is in any way demeaning or stigmatizing 
to people living with schizophrenia. In recent years, the person 
affected with schizophrenia has been variously called a patient, con-
sumer, service recipient, or survivor — and the term that’s preferred 
changes over time, and can vary from one person to the next. We 
tend to think of people with schizophrenia as people, but those in the 
helping professions (psychiatry, psychology, social work, nursing, 
rehabilitation, and so on) have a long tradition of calling the people 
they work with patients. Accepting the old adage that you can’t please 
everyone all the time, we used the terms that flowed most comfortably 
for us as we wrote — although we tried to vary our language. We hope 
that our words don’t offend or interfere with our message.
 
 We try to vary the pronouns we used based on gender — for example, 
not always referring to doctors as he and not always referring to people 
with schizophrenia as she. We didn’t keep a running tally of the gender 
pronouns we used, but we hope you’ll find it a fair balance.
 
 We often refer to the person with schizophrenia as your loved one, 
because this book is primarily geared toward people who are caring for, 
or closely connected to, someone with the disorder — and because we 
recognize that you may not be family, but your love is just as strong.

3
 Introduction
 
 We generally preferred to use the term medications as opposed to 
drugs, because many people confuse the latter term with street drugs 
or drugs of abuse (like heroin, cocaine, and marijuana). That said, we 
do alternate use of the terms in this book — rest assured, when we use 
the term drugs, we’re referring to prescribed medications.
 
 Also, every medication has both a generic name and a trade name (also 
called a brand name). The trade, or brand name, is the one you hear 
advertised on commercials (for example, Lipitor is the trade name of 
a medication used to treat high cholesterol, and the generic name is 
atorvastatin calcium). We give you both the generic and trade names 
when referring to medications.
What You’re Not to Read
You don’t have to read everything in this book to get the information you 
need. Here are some pieces of the puzzle you can safely skip:
 
 Anything marked by a Technical Stuff icon: Check out the “Icons Used 
in This Book” section, later in this Introduction, for more on this and 
other icons.
 
 Sidebars: Sidebars are boxes of gray text that appear throughout this 
book. You’ll find interesting information in sidebars, but nothing 
essential to understanding the topic at hand.
 
 The copyright page: If you like reading fine print, have at it. Otherwise, 
trust us: You don’t need to know what’s there.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, we assumed the following about you:
 
 You may be caring for someone who has symptoms associated with 
schizophrenia or has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.
 
 You may be a parent, family member, friend, or colleague of someone 
who has schizophrenia, and you want to understand more about the 
disorder and what you can do to help.
 
 You may be a mental-health or medical professional reading the book so 
that you can recommend it to loved ones seeking more information 
about schizophrenia.
Although we haven’t written this book specifically for the person with 
schizophrenia, if you have schizophrenia and want more information on the 
disorder, you’ll find this book useful as well.

Schizophrenia For Dummies 
How This Book Is Organized
We’ve divided this book into five parts. Here’s what you’ll find in each.
Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia
In this part, we give you a broad overview of schizophrenia, separating 
what’s real from the myths and misperceptions. We describe the symptoms 
and unusual (and sometime disturbing) behaviors commonly associated 
with the disorder and explain how clinicians distinguish the symptoms of 
schizophrenia from those of other serious mental disorders. We describe the 
onset of the disorder, which can come on suddenly, seemingly out of the 
blue, or may make its appearance so gradually that it’s barely noticed.
Part II: Finding Out What’s 
Wrong and Getting Help
Getting a diagnosis is the first step in getting help. In this part, we explain 
how the diagnosis of schizophrenia is made and identify the different types of 
schizophrenia. We also give you tips on how to assemble a healthcare team 
for diagnosis and treatment, and what to do if things don’t seem to be func-
tioning as smoothly as you would hope them to. Finally, we provide advice 
on starting treatment, including navigating the financial hurdles you’ll likely 
face in paying for care and dealing with your loved one’s potential lack of 
insight into the illness.
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia
Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone of treatment for schizophre-
nia. This part explains how psychiatrists select a first medication, and how 
and why they make adjustments. We also provide advice about how your 
loved one can cope with common side effects and offer tips for encouraging 
your loved one to stick to her medication schedule. We explain the range of 
treatments for schizophrenia and fill you in on what’s known and unknown 
about complementary and alternative treatments. Finally, we identify new 
and promising directions in research and explain the benefits and risks of 
participating in clinical trials.

 Introduction
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia presents challenges not only to the individual with the illness, 
but also to the people around them. Families need to stay positive and opti-
mistic, and avoid blaming each other for the illness. In this part, we tell you 
how families can avoid burnout, work collaboratively with professionals, and 
acquire the coping skills they need in order to handle their loved one’s not-
so-pleasant behaviors. This part also provides suggestions for finding decent 
affordable housing and for learning how to handle psychiatric crises to mini-
mize their adverse impact. Finally, we define and explain the importance of 
recovery and meeting the needs of the whole person, which transcend treat-
ment alone.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Every book in the For Dummies series includes a part called The Part of Tens, 
which offers helpful hints to empower readers. In Schizophrenia For 
Dummies, we debunk ten myths about mental illness, offer up ten tips for 
coping with your loved one’s disorder, and ten ways your loved one can 
avoid relapse.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout the book, we use icons — little pictures in the margin — to 
highlight certain kinds of information. Here’s what the icons mean:
 
When we use the Remember icon, it means that we’re highlighting essential 
information that’s worth remembering.
 
Schizophrenia, like many other illnesses and disorders, is complex. When we 
get into the details that you don’t absolutely need to understand, we mark it 
with a Technical Stuff icon. You can safely skip these paragraphs without 
missing the point — or you can read them and find even more information.
 
The Tip icon highlights advice or pointers to help you cope with the symp-
toms and behavior associated with schizophrenia and to deal with the 
complexities of treatment. We’ve worked in mental health for years — think 
of these paragraphs as our insider tips on dealing with schizophrenia.
 
The Warning icon signals potential risks and dangers. You won’t see it used 
often, but when you do see it, be sure to heed the warning.

Schizophrenia For Dummies 
Where to Go from Here
If you’re the kind of person who reads the morning newspaper from front to 
back, you’ll probably want to start with Chapter 1 of this book and read 
straight through to the index — in fact, you’ve probably already read the title 
page, copyright information, table of contents, and everything else that 
comes before this Introduction. However, you don’t need to read this book 
in sequence to get a lot out of it. If you’re coping with a particular issue or 
problem, use the table of contents and the index to guide you to the specific 
portion of the book that addresses your questions. For example, if you think 
your loved one may have schizophrenia, but he hasn’t yet been diagnosed, 
turn to Chapter 3. If you’re looking for doctors for your loved one, Chapter 5 
is the place to start. If you’re looking for a place for your loved one to live, 
Chapter 13 has the information you need. Use this book in whatever way 
works best for you.

Part I

Schizophrenia

In this part . . .
W
e kick things off by giving you an overview of 
schizophrenia — a no-fault, equal-opportunity dis-
ease of the brain that strikes teenagers and young adults 
in the prime of their lives. Here we dispel some of the 
myths and misunderstandings associated with the disor-
der, which have led to unnecessary blame and social 
stigma. We also show you how to recognize the early 
warning signs of the disease, outline its risk factors, and 
cover the range of symptoms and behaviors that charac-
terize schizophrenia. Finally, we tell you how doctors are 
able to differentiate schizophrenia from other mental dis-
orders with seemingly overlapping symptoms, and dis-
cuss the fact that — although treatments have vastly 
improved the lives of people with schizophrenia and their 
families — much more remains to be learned.

S
chizophrenia. If someone you know has been recently diagnosed with 
schizophrenia, the very word may evoke a cascade of intense feelings: 
sadness, fear, confusion, shame, and hopelessness. You may ask yourself, 
how did this happen? Why did it happen to my loved one? It’s natural to have 
these emotions. But take a deep breath. You need to know that the diagnosis 
isn’t as catastrophic as it first appears to be.
Most people know very little about schizophrenia until it hits home, and 
what they do know is likely to be based on old myths and misperceptions. 
They need to find out as much accurate information as they can about this 
complex and misunderstood disease. Knowledge is power — and knowing 
what schizophrenia is (and isn’t) is the first step toward moving beyond 
your worst fears.
In this chapter, we give you an overview of the brain disorder known as 
schizophrenia: what it is, who gets it, and what treatments are available. 
We dispel some common myths about the disorder and tell you how schizo-
phrenia differs from other mental illnesses. Finally, we tell you the good 
news about the disorder and why you and your loved one have every reason 
to remain hopeful that recovery is possible.
Schizophrenia is a serious, long-term, life-altering illness, so it’s natural to 
be stunned upon hearing the diagnosis. You may even feel paralyzed, not 
knowing what to do next. But the first step is clear: You need to gather all the 
information you can to make sure your loved one is getting the best possible 
treatment and supports available to him.

Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia 
Defining Schizophrenia
You’re reading this book, which means you probably have a personal interest 
in schizophrenia — either you or someone close to you has been diagnosed 
with the disease or you’re worried about someone showing signs or symp-
toms. In this section, we fill you in on what’s currently known about schizo-
phrenia and the way the disorder affects the people who have it, as well as 
their loved ones.
What schizophrenia is
Schizophrenia is a brain disorder characterized by a variety of different 
symptoms, many of which can dramatically affect an individual’s way of 
thinking and ability to function. Most scientists think that the disorder 
is due to one or more problems in the development of the brain that results 
in neurochemical imbalances, although no one fully understands why 
schizophrenia develops.
People with schizophrenia have trouble distinguishing what’s real from 
what’s not. They are not able to fully control their emotions or think 
logically, and they usually have trouble relating to other people. They often 
suffer from hallucinations; much of their bizarre behavior is usually due to 
individuals acting in response to something they think is real but is only in 
their minds.
Unfortunately, because of the way schizophrenia has been inaccurately 
portrayed in the media over many decades, the illness is one of the most 
feared and misunderstood of all the physical and mental disorders.
Schizophrenia is a long-term relapsing disorder because it has symptoms 
that wax and wane, worsen and get better, over time. Similar to many 
physical illnesses (such as diabetes, asthma, and arthritis), schizophrenia is 
highly treatable — although it isn’t yet considered curable.
But the long-term outcomes of schizophrenia aren’t as grim as was once 
believed. Although the disorder can have a course that results in long-term 
disability, one in five persons recovers completely. Some people have only 
one psychotic episode, others have repeated episodes with normal periods 
of functioning in between, and others have continuing problems from which 
they never fully recover.
Who gets schizophrenia
No group is risk-free when it comes to schizophrenia, but some people are 
more likely than others to develop the disorder. The following statistics may 
surprise you:

11
 Chapter 1: Understanding Schizophrenia: The Big Picture
 
 Schizophrenia is more common than you might think. About 1 out of 
100 people develop schizophrenia over the course of their lifetime. 
Schizophrenia is twice as common as Alzheimer’s disease or HIV/AIDS, 
five times as common as multiple sclerosis, and six times as common as 
Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes.
 
 Although new cases of schizophrenia are somewhat rare, the number 
of individuals with the disorder remains relatively high because 
schizophrenia is a chronic disorder that often lasts for an extended 
period of time.
 
 Schizophrenia affects both sexes equally and is found among people 
of all races, cultures, and socioeconomic groups around the world.
 
 Although schizophrenia is more likely to affect people between the 
ages of 17 and 35 (the onset tends to be earlier in men than in 
women), it can begin in children as young as age 5 or have a late 
onset in a person’s 50s, 60s, or 70s.
 
 Childhood-onset schizophrenia is extremely rare, affecting about 1 in 
40,000 children. Only 1 in 100 adults now diagnosed with the disorder 
had symptoms before the age of 13. Because the disorder tends to 
surface more gradually in children, it often goes unnoticed. Chapter 2 
lists some of the early red flags to watch for if you suspect that 
something may be wrong.
 
 An earlier onset is often indicative of poorer outcomes because the 
disorder can interfere with education, development, and social 
functioning. On the other hand, early recognition can help improve 
outcomes and minimize disability.
Famous people with schizophrenia
Many accomplished and successful people are 
reported to have had schizophrenia. Here’s a 
short list:
  Lionel Aldridge (1941–1998), professional 
football player on the Green Bay Packers in 
the 1960s
  Syd Barrett (1946–2006), founding member 
of the band Pink Floyd
  Jim Gordon (1945–), drummer and member 
of Derek and the Dominoes
  Peter Green (1946–), guitarist and founder 
of the band Fleetwood Mac
  Tom Harrell (1946–), jazz musician
  Jack Kerouac (1922–1969), author of On 
the Road
  Mary Todd Lincoln (1818–1882), first lady of 
the United States, wife of Abraham Lincoln
  John Nash (1928–), mathematician, Nobel 
Prize winner, subject of the film A Beautiful 
Mind
  Vaslav Nijinsky (1889–1950), ballet dancer
  Brian Wilson (1942–), bass player and 
singer in the band The Beach Boys

Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia 
What causes schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a no-fault, equal-opportunity illness most likely caused 
by a number of factors, both genetic and environmental. Most scientists now 
accept a two-hit theory for the cause of schizophrenia, which suggests that 
the genetic susceptibility is compounded by one or more environmental 
factors:
 
 Genetic susceptibility: Based on family genetic history, some people are 
more vulnerable to the disorder than other people are.
 
 Environmental factors: In someone genetically predisposed, certain 
environment factors may come into play, such as:
 
• Physical trauma that occurs to the fetus during childbirth
 
• Oxygen-deprivation or some psychological or physical problem 
that occurs to the mother during pregnancy and affects the devel-
oping fetus
 
• Emotional stress, such as the loss of a parent or loved one during 
young adulthood
Comparing the schizophrenic 
brain to the normal one
New imaging techniques — like magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) and positron emission 
tomography (PET) — have opened virtual win-
dows into the brain. Scientists have been able 
to visualize the living brain and discern some of 
the differences in the structure and function of 
the brains of people with schizophrenia and the 
brains of their normal peers.
Some of the differences observed in the brains 
of people with schizophrenia are
  Enlarged ventricles: Fluid-filled cavities 
within the brain
  A loss of gray matter: Brain tissue that is 
comprised of nerve cells
  Abnormalities in white matter: Myelin-
covered nerve fibers that serve as “wiring” 
connecting different parts of the brain
In the rare cases where schizophrenia first 
appears in early childhood, differences have 
been found in the cortex of the developing brain. 
The cortex forms the surface of the brain.
Functional magnetic imaging studies have 
enabled scientists to observe the brain while 
it’s performing various tasks. These studies 
have found that the brains of people with 
schizophrenia work differently — either harder 
or less efficiently — than those of people with-
out the disorder.
All these variations are meaningful, but when 
it comes to diagnosing a particular individual, 
science is not yet at the point where a diagnosis 
can be made based on imaging data.

13
 Chapter 1: Understanding Schizophrenia: The Big Picture
 
Although schizophrenia is genetically influenced, more than genetics is 
involved in its development. Studies of identical twins show that, if one twin 
develops schizophrenia, the other twin has only a 40 percent to 50 percent 
chance of also developing the illness. There’s also an increased risk among 
fraternal twins when one develops schizophrenia, the other has between a 10 
percent and 17 percent chance, far less than that of identical twins. Having a 
parent with schizophrenia also increases a person’s risk of developing the 
disease, to about 10 percent. And if you have a sibling with the disorder — 
not your twin — you have a 6 percent to 9 percent chance of developing the 
disorder yourself.
Scientists still don’t know the precise causes of schizophrenia for any partic-
ular individual, yet family members and patients themselves tend to dwell on 
(or even obsess about) finding a “reason” or a “cause” for the illness. 
Although this instinct is a natural one, finding the precise cause or explana-
tion is impossible, not to mention counterproductive — finding a reason 
doesn’t help treatment, and it often creates unnecessary and misplaced guilt, 
with one family member blaming another.
See Chapter 2 for a full discussion of the possible causes of schizophrenia.
The Symptoms of Schizophrenia
There are almost 300 named psychiatric disorders, and schizophrenia is one 
of them. Although many mental illnesses have symptoms that overlap, 
schizophrenia has a distinct pattern of symptoms. No two cases of schizo-
phrenia look exactly the same, but most people with schizophrenia display 
three types of symptoms:
 
 Positive symptoms: The term positive symptoms is confusing, because 
positive symptoms (as the term might suggest) aren’t “good” symptoms 
at all. They’re symptoms that add to reality, and not in a good way. 
People with schizophrenia hear things that don’t exist or see things that 
aren’t there (in what are known as hallucinations). The voices they hear 
can accuse them of terrible things and can be very jarring (for example, 
causing them to think that they’ve hurt someone or have been responsi-
ble for some cataclysmic world event).
 
 People with schizophrenia can also have delusions (false beliefs that 
defy logic or any culturally specific explanation and that cannot be 
changed by logic or reason). For example, an individual may believe that 
there is a conspiracy of people driving red cars that follows his every 
movement. He will use the fact that there are red cars everywhere he 
goes as evidence that the conspiracy is real.

14
Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia 
 
 Negative symptoms: These symptoms are a lack of something that 
should be present; behaviors that would be considered normal are 
either absent or diminished. For example, people with schizophrenia 
often lack motivation and appear lazy. They may be much slower to 
respond than most other people, have little to say when they do speak, 
and appear as if they have no emotions, or exhibit emotions that are 
inappropriate to the situation. They may also be unable to get pleasure 
from the things that most people enjoy or from activities that once 
brought pleasure to them. Families often get frustrated when a relative 
with schizophrenia does nothing but sleep or watch TV — they wrongly 
attribute this behavior to the patient not being willing to assume 
responsibility or “pull himself up by his bootstraps.”
 
 Negative symptoms are part and parcel of the illness for at least 25 
percent of people with schizophrenia.
 
 Cognitive symptoms: Most people with the disorder suffer from impair-
ments in memory, learning, concentration, and their ability to make 
sound decisions. These so-called cognitive symptoms interfere with an 
individual’s ability to learn new things, remember things they once 
knew, and use skills they once had. Cognitive symptoms can make it 
hard for a person to continue working at a job, going to school, or 
participating in activities she may have enjoyed at one time.
In addition to the symptoms mentioned above, people with schizophrenia 
may also have sleep problems, mood swings, and anxiety. They may experi-
ence difficulties forming and maintaining social relationships with other 
people. They may look different enough that other people notice that some-
thing is very odd or strange about them and that they don’t quite look 
“normal.” They may have unusual ways of doing things, have peculiar habits, 
dress inappropriately (such as wearing a heavy coat or multiple layers of 
clothes in the summer), and/or be poorly groomed, which can discourage 
other people from getting involved with them.
See Chapter 3 for more about the differences in these types of symptoms.
Dispelling the Myths Associated 
with Schizophrenia
People wrongly associate the symptoms of schizophrenia with split or multi-
ple personalities (like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde), antisocial behavior (similar to 
what we see in serial killers), and developmental disabilities. Others believe 
that schizophrenia is a character defect and that the individual could behave 
normally if he really wanted to.
Here are a few of the most common misconceptions about schizophrenia:

15
 Chapter 1: Understanding Schizophrenia: The Big Picture
 
 Schizophrenia is the same as a split or multiple personality. 
Schizophrenia is not the same as multiple personality, which is an 
exceedingly rare, totally different disorder that is now more commonly 
called a dissociative identity disorder. (Under stress, people with this 
disorder often assume different identities, each with different names, 
voices, characteristics, and personal histories.)
 
 People with schizophrenia are violent. People with schizophrenia are 
more likely to be victims rather than perpetrators of crimes. Many 
people believe that most people with schizophrenia have a propensity 
for violence, but the reality is that most people with schizophrenia 
don’t commit violent crimes, and most violent criminals don’t have 
schizophrenia.
 
 For example, serial killers (people who commit three or more subse-
quent murders) usually aren’t psychotic (out of touch with reality); 
they’re likely to be diagnosed with an antisocial personality disorder 
(a disorder in which people disregard commonly accepted social rules 
and norms, display impulsive behavior, and are indifferent to the rights 
and feelings of others).
 
 However, people with untreated schizophrenia, who refuse to take 
medication and whose thinking is out of touch with reality are at 
increased risk of aggressive behavior and self-neglect. The risk of vio-
lence also increases if someone with schizophrenia is actively abusing 
alcohol or illicit drugs. For better or worse, the aggressive behavior is 
usually directed toward family or friends rather than toward strangers.
 
 Poor parenting causes schizophrenia. For many years, clinicians were 
taught and actually believed that schizophrenia was caused by parents 
who were either too permissive or too controlling. The term schizophre-
nogenic mother was once used to describe such parents — the blame 
usually fell heavily on mothers because they tended to spend the most 
time with their offspring. Another outdated theory is the double-bind 
theory, which suggested that schizophrenia is due to inconsistent 
parenting, with conflicting messages.
 
 These ideas were not based on controlled studies, and these theories no 
longer have credibility today.
 
 Schizophrenia is a no-fault disorder of the brain.
 
 People with schizophrenia are mentally retarded. Some people think 
that schizophrenia is synonymous with mental retardation (now called 
developmental disabilities). No. Like the general public, people with 
schizophrenia have a wide range of intellectual abilities. They may 
appear less intelligent because of the impaired social skills, odd behav-
iors, and cognitive impairments that are characteristic of schizophrenia. 
However, they’re not lacking in intelligence, and schizophrenia is 
distinct from developmental disabilities (physical and mental deficits 
that are chronic and severe and that generally begin in childhood).

 Schizophrenia is a defect of character. Negative symptoms of schizo-
phrenia give people the mistaken impression that those with the disor-
der are lazy and could act “normally” if they wanted to. This idea is no 
more realistic than suggesting that someone could prevent his epileptic 
seizures if he really wanted to or that someone could “decide” not to 
have cancer if he ate the right foods. What often appears as character 
defects are symptoms of schizophrenia.
 
 When the negative symptoms of schizophrenia are persistent and pri-
marily caused by schizophrenia, they’re referred to as deficit syndrome.
 
 There’s no hope for people diagnosed with schizophrenia. Sixty years 
ago when people were diagnosed with schizophrenia, they were 
either kept at home behind closed doors by embarrassed and forlorn 
families who saw no other alternative, or consigned to long-term stays 
in distant state hospitals for care that was largely custodial (they weren’t 
treated — they were just taken care of). Other than using highly sedat-
ing drugs, doctors had few tools available to them to relieve the agita-
tion and torment of their patients or to help restore their functioning.
 
 In contrast to how things were in the past, schizophrenia is now consid-
ered highly treatable. Several generations of new medications and the 
emergence of new forms of therapies have enabled doctors to treat the 
symptoms of the large majority of patients with schizophrenia enabling 
them to live meaningful, productive lives in their communities.

Finding Out Whether Your Loved 
One Has Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia doesn’t always make its appearance in the same way. 
Sometimes its symptoms come on suddenly, seemingly out of the blue, and 
this can be very confusing or even shocking. A very common scenario is 
that a young person, previously described as an excellent student, standout 
athlete, or all-around great kid, goes off for college and suddenly calls home 
after a month or two to report that he’s being followed or has been targeted 
by an alien group. When the individual has had no prior history of a serious 
mental disorder, the onset of this disorder is called a first break or an acute 
psychotic break.
Other times, schizophrenia comes on gradually, or its symptoms are so 
subtle that the person simply hasn’t been diagnosed earlier. Often, it’s diffi-
cult for the individual and people around her to notice that anything is wrong 
(because they’ve come to accept what they view as the person’s quirky 
personality) until things further deteriorate and can no longer be ignored.

17
 Chapter 1: Understanding Schizophrenia: The Big Picture
Families say that their relative never seemed “quite right”; the person may 
have had problems at school or work, problems relating to peers, and a 
history of odd or unusual behaviors. Then she suddenly exhibits delusions, 
hallucinations, or other signs indicating that she’s out of touch with reality. 
After that, the possibility of schizophrenia can no longer be ignored.
No matter how the scenario unfolds, the key is getting a diagnosis for your 
loved one and ruling out other possible causes for the symptoms you’re 
noticing. In the section below, we tell you how to do both.
Getting a diagnosis
If you have any suspicion that your loved one may have schizophrenia, it’s 
vitally important that he be seen by a mental-health professional as soon as 
possible. If the clinician is not a psychiatrist — maybe he’s a psychologist 
or social worker — he’ll likely suggest that your loved one be seen by an 
internist or general practitioner to make sure that the symptoms are not due 
to any underlying physical disorder (such as a brain tumor, epilepsy, or 
drug intoxication) and to rule out other medical explanations.
Unlike some physical illnesses, there’s no simple blood test or X-ray that can 
establish the diagnosis of schizophrenia. So the mental-health professional 
will interview your loved one and take a thorough history to help arrive at an 
accurate diagnosis. Often they will interview family members to round out 
their understanding of the patient’s history and functioning at home, and to 
solicit their assistance in filling in details that the patient may have forgotten 
or be hesitant to talk about.
 
When mental-health professionals make diagnoses of schizophrenia, they 
sometimes identify various subtypes of the disorder based on their character-
istic symptoms. These subtypes include paranoid schizophrenia, catatonic 
schizophrenia, and undifferentiated schizophrenia (see Chapter 4 for more 
information on all these). These subtypes no longer hold the same diagnostic 
or prognostic (ability to predict the future) importance that they once did. 
Today, more emphasis is placed on designing treatment strategies that 
address positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.
 
Early diagnosis is important — it leads to better outcomes. Even having a 
name for the disturbing symptoms people experience enables patients and 
those around them to better understand and cope with their situation.
Ruling out other explanations
After medical causes are ruled out and schizophrenia is suspected, your next 
step is for your loved one to see a psychiatrist — specifically, someone who 
is experienced in diagnosing and treating schizophrenia.

18
Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia 
Finding a psychiatrist experienced in diagnosing and treating schizophrenia 
isn’t always easy. Two of the best sources of referrals are academic medical 
centers and family support groups. (For more on finding a psychiatrist for 
your loved one, check out Chapter 4.)
One of the reasons that diagnosing schizophrenia can be challenging is that 
its symptoms sometimes overlap with other mental disorders. Mental-health 
professionals determine whether a person has schizophrenia or some other 
psychiatric condition with similar or overlapping symptoms by doing what’s 
called a differential diagnosis. For example, to diagnose schizophrenia, some 
of the conditions psychiatrists rule out include
 
 Mood disorders: People with schizophrenia can have mood swings, 
become depressed, or exhibit hypomanic (persistently elated or 
irritable) moods or behaviors. People with bipolar disorder or severe 
depression can have psychotic thoughts (such as delusions or hallucina-
tions) that resemble those found in schizophrenia. But in schizophrenia, 
the thought disorder predominates over mood symptoms.
 
 Schizoaffective disorder: Schizoaffective disorder, despite the name, 
isn’t a type of schizophrenia — instead, it’s a different diagnosis with 
a combination of thought and mood symptoms. The diagnosis is 
sometimes used when the symptoms of the disorder can’t be clearly 
categorized as either schizophrenia or a mood disorder.
 
 Substance use and abuse: The symptoms associated with acute schizo-
phrenia can be caused by drug-induced intoxication, especially from 
hallucinogenic drugs (like LSD), cocaine, or amphetamines. A significant 
proportion of people with schizophrenia use alcohol and/or other drugs 
to mask their symptoms and/or ease their anxiety about their symptoms 
and have co-occurring mental-health and substance-use disorders.
 
 To determine whether psychotic symptoms are induced by drugs or a 
symptom of schizophrenia, a clinician may need to see the patient over 
time and observe the patient when she is not using drugs or alcohol.
 
 Borderline personality disorder: People with borderline personality 
disorder often have moods that change on a dime, have conflicts with 
other people, act out inappropriately, or have impaired judgment. They 
may also behave in ways that hurt themselves (for example, deliberating 
cutting or burning themselves). However, it’s not common for people 
with borderline personalities to have hallucinations or cognitive 
impairments.
 
 Sometimes an individual’s psychiatric diagnosis changes over time 
based on whichever symptoms appear to be most prominent at the 
time the person is seen. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the previous 
diagnosis was wrong.

 Chapter 1: Understanding Schizophrenia: The Big Picture
Improving the Lives of People 
with Schizophrenia
Since the 1950s, the mental-health profession has made marked advances in 
the treatment of schizophrenia. Now most people with schizophrenia are 
Normal teenage behaviors and 
the diagnosis of schizophrenia
Not surprisingly, the teenage years have been 
called the “roller-coaster years” because of the 
ups and downs caused by surging hormones, 
and because adolescents are prone to engage 
in strange and risky behaviors. Many young 
people have mood swings, use and/or abuse 
alcohol, or maintain unusual sleep schedules 
(reversing day and night, or sleeping too little or 
too much).
Because the onset of schizophrenia usually 
coincides with the late teenage years, schizo-
phrenia is often missed and its symptoms are 
dismissed as behaviors of normal adolescence. 
It takes an experienced clinician to confirm or 
rule out a diagnosis of schizophrenia in teens, 
but some warning signs include the following:
  A dramatic decline in school performance: 
For example, excessive absences or failing 
subjects at which she once excelled.
  Having thoughts that often don’t make 
sense: For example, a teenager with schizo-
phrenia may think his thoughts are being 
monitored by electronic equipment in the 
house or that his food is being poisoned.
  Being suspicious or paranoid: Lots of teen-
agers are “paranoid” that their parents 
are going through their things or spying 
on them, but that’s not what we’re talking 
about here. The suspiciousness or paranoia 
in a teenager with schizophrenia might lead 
him to believe that his room is bugged by 
the FBI.
  Staying isolated or not having friends: Not 
every teen is captain of the football team or 
homecoming queen — we’re not talking 
about popularity here. We mean having 
absolutely no friends — not even one — 
and never socializing with other kids or 
participating in school activities.
  Use of drugs and/or alcohol: Teenagers fre-
quently experiment with drugs or alcohol, 
so if you find out your teen is doing either of 
these, that doesn’t mean he has schizo-
phrenia. But if you see drug and alcohol use 
in conjunction with the other symptoms in 
this list, that can be evidence that he may 
have schizophrenia. Remember: Drug and 
alcohol use in teens is a serious problem 
whether they have schizophrenia or not, 
so if you suspect your teen may be drinking 
or doing drugs, be sure to get him help.

for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) 
toll-free help line at 800-662-4357 or go to 
www.findtreatment.samhsa.gov 
for tips on where to start.
  Family history of mental illness: Genetics 
alone doesn’t cause schizophrenia, but if 
you have a family history of mental illness, 
and you’re noticing other symptoms in this 
list, your teen may have schizophrenia.

20
Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia 
treated in the community as opposed to remaining in hospitals for long-term 
care. When individuals do need to be hospitalized, it’s usually for a brief 
period of time to stabilize their symptoms. In this section, we cover the range 
of treatments and supports that are essential to recovery.
Medication
Today, medication is considered the mainstay of treatment for most 
individuals with schizophrenia. However, medication alone isn’t enough — 
it’s more successful when combined with psychosocial (see the following 
section) interventions.
 
Antipsychotic medications — like medications used to treat many other 
chronic illnesses (such as diabetes, epilepsy, heart disease, and asthma) — 
control symptoms. They don’t provide a cure.
Good psychopharmacologists (psychiatrists who have training and experience 
in prescribing medications that are used to treat psychiatric illnesses) 
now are more likely to work along with individuals and families to find a 
medication regimen that will help keep positive symptoms under control. 
Also, today doctors are more likely to listen to patients who complain of 
adverse side effects and to modify doses or the type of medication accord-
ingly, to encourage compliance. Finally, the availability of practice guidelines 
(summaries of best practices based on research evidence or professional 
consensus), developed by many professional organizations, have improved 
the overall state of the art of medication management.
 
Collaboration between a patient and doctor is less possible when a person 
with schizophrenia is acutely ill and unable to understand or remember 
what’s being discussed. The approach to medication management is a 
long-term one.
We cover medication options in Chapter 8.
Psychosocial treatments
Psychosocial treatments include psychological treatments, social 
approaches, and combined approaches that are especially helpful in restor-
ing confidence and self-esteem, as well as in helping people with schizophre-
nia develop the skills they never acquired or lost as a result of their illness 
(which often curtails or interrupts an individual’s education or work).
Psychosocial treatments include social skills training, vocational counseling 
and job training, cognitive remediation (compensatory learning strategies 
that improve neuropsychological functions like memory, concentration, 

21
 Chapter 1: Understanding Schizophrenia: The Big Picture
planning and organizing), and assistance with the activities of daily living. 
Psychological treatments include supportive psychotherapy (talk therapy) 
and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which is focused on changing 
negative thinking patterns. Self-help approaches and family psychoeducation 
are important elements of a comprehensive system of care.
Because cognitive problems and the complexity of the service system often 
make it hard for people with schizophrenia to arrange for their own care, in 
the past, families were usually thrust into the role of de facto case managers. 
Increasingly, professional case managers (mental-health workers who help 
people with chronic illnesses navigate the complex system of healthcare 
and social services) have become part of the landscape of mental-health 
treatment. Case managers coordinate services, help in the event of crises, 
and provide ongoing support to enable people live successfully with some 
degree of autonomy and independence. Assertive community treatment 
(ACT) programs, comprised of multidisciplinary treatment teams, reach out 
to the patient and can be particularly helpful to those with a more severe 
form of the illness.
We cover the variety of psychosocial approaches in detail in Chapter 9.
Family psychoeducation
Although families were once seen as part of the problem, they’re now 
viewed as part of the solution and frequently essential to recovery. With the 
growth of groups like the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), family 
psychoeducation has flourished at national, state, and local levels.
Family psychoeducation groups provide a place for families to exchange 
information about the illness, learn what works and what doesn’t (both in 
terms of treatment and coping strategies), identify ways to minimize the risk 
of relapse, and find out how to identify and access community resources. For 
example, the NAMI Family-to-Family educational program has given countless 
families the opportunity to learn the things they need to know to be effective 
caregivers and advocates for their loved ones.
More important, perhaps, family psychoeducation groups help family 
members recognize that they’re not alone and that others are working hard 
to improve care — not only for their own loved ones, but for all individuals 
and families affected by serious mental disorders. At the same time, they 
help people to live their lives without letting them be defined solely by the 
illness. Families have been instrumental, in turn, in improving public 
understanding and awareness of the needs of people with schizophrenia.
You can find information on advocacy organizations for dealing with 
schizophrenia in Chapters 11 and 15.

22
Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia 
Peer support and mutual self-help
Another crucial element to recovery is providing people with schizophrenia 
the opportunity to talk to and exchange information with their peers. Having 
the chance to know other people facing the same challenges can help people 
with schizophrenia recover more quickly from acute episodes of the illness 
and can help them avoid relapse and hospitalization. Clubhouses, drop-in 
centers, and mutual support groups can play an important role in fostering 
recovery. For example, NAMI Peer-to-Peer programs offer a recovery 
curriculum for consumers.
For more on these support groups, turn to Chapter 9.
Basic support: Housing, financial aid, 
and healthcare
Like everyone else, people with any mental illness need stable and affordable 
housing, entitlements when they can’t support themselves financially, and 
access to quality healthcare, mental-health treatment, and medications. 
Often, mental illnesses are associated with poverty and a cascade of personal 
losses — including friendships, work opportunities, and a place to call home.
Because the resources needed to cope with any chronic disorder are 
generally beyond the reach of any one individual family, governmental and 
charitable organizations oversee and fund many of these services and 
supports, which are cost-saving in human and economic terms.
Chapters 7 and 13 discuss various financing and housing options for people 
with schizophrenia.
 
Family and close friends can play a vital role in fostering their loved one’s 
recovery. They’re the ones who best know their loved one, including his 
hopes and dreams. They also are likely to have the greatest stake in seeing 
him recover and succeed. One advocate we know once said, “No one has the 
same fire in his belly to make the system work for his loved one.”
Recognizing the Challenges That Remain
We’d be less than honest if we said that everything is perfect today for 
people dealing with schizophrenia — it’s not. Here are a few of the problems 
that remain:

23
 Chapter 1: Understanding Schizophrenia: The Big Picture
 
 Many patients still are unable to find a medication that works for 
them. Their persistent positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms are 
vexing to them, as well as to their families and clinicians. (See Chapter 8 
for more about medications and schizophrenia.)
 
 Doctors still don’t know which drugs work best for which individuals. 
The choice of medication still relies on a good deal of trial and error, 
which takes time and requires patience.
 
 Families still have to learn that, despite their best efforts, they can’t 
talk someone out of schizophrenia or wish it away with an abundance 
of love and caring. (See Chapter 11 for ways to help everyone in the 
family live with schizophrenia.)
 
 Most communities don’t have the full breadth of services and supports 
to necessary to support recovery. (See Chapters 12 and 13 for more 
information on community resources.)
 
 The scarcity of appropriate low-cost housing, adequate health-
insurance coverage, and competitive jobs undermine progress for 
many people with schizophrenia.
 
 Mental-health services still tend to be fragmented and insufficient in 
number, and finding psychiatrists who are experienced and willing to 
work with individuals with long-term mental illnesses is still difficult 
(particularly in rural areas). (See Chapter 5 for information on choosing 
the right doctors.)
Holding On to Hope: The Good 
News about Schizophrenia
It’s easy to dwell on the negatives when dealing with schizophrenia, but the 
truth is, there are many reasons for hope:
 
 We know, without question, that schizophrenia is a no-fault disorder 
of the brain and that with appropriate treatment and supports, the 
illness doesn’t necessarily have to have a chronic, deteriorating 
course. People do and can recover!
 
 Early diagnosis and the availability of community-based treatment 
and social supports can restore an individual’s dignity, improve her 
quality of life, and enable her to make meaningful contributions to 
her family and community. Your loved one may find a different path 
than you or she anticipated, but it can still be a good one.
 
 The ultimate goal of recovery is about more than relief of symptoms. 
Recovery entails helping people get back to work or school, live with 
others, and make their own life decisions. Patients and families should 
accept no less.

24
Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia 
 
 The role of families and friends is critical to recovery. They need to:
 
• Support and anchor their loved ones during the acute phases of 
the illness
 
• Help their loved ones find the tools they need to recover and avoid 
relapse
 
 Continue to educate themselves to better cope with the challenges they 
encounter, working individually and collectively to fight stigma and 
discrimination based on misunderstanding
 
 Just as scientists now know that there are many different types of 
cancer, researchers may one day learn that schizophrenia is a family 
of similar disorders that are currently lumped under one term. This 
discovery could pave the way for more targeted and personalized treat-
ments. Because the precise causes of schizophrenia are still unknown 
for any particular individual, scientists are exploring a number of 
possibilities including genetic, viral, infectious, chemical, developmen-
tal, and environmental explanations. There has never been more 
research being conducted on the causes and cures for schizophrenia 
than there is today. (See Chapter 10 for the latest on research into 
schizophrenia.)
 
Never give up hope. Just around the corner are answers to questions 
that can’t be answered today and solutions to problems that seem 
insurmountable.

O
ne of the first questions young children ask is, “Why?” But whatever 
your age, it’s human nature to try to find a reason why things happen. 
When a disease like schizophrenia affects someone you love, your first 
questions will likely be, “Why did this happen? Was it something I did? Could 
it have been prevented?” And right after the whys come the ifs: “If only I 
hadn’t eaten that, done that, moved there, neglected this, ignored that . . . 
then maybe this wouldn’t have happened.”
In this chapter, we look at the whys and ifs of schizophrenia: what research 
says about the causes and risk factors associated with schizophrenia. We 
also examine past theories of why schizophrenia occurred — theories that 
have now been discredited by research and an expanding knowledge base. 
You may ask, “Why do I need to know this stuff?” Because the more you 
understand about schizophrenia, the better prepared you’ll be to deal with it.
Searching for a Reason
Disorders like schizophrenia are a result of something going wrong, but just 
what that something is, isn’t very easy to pinpoint. Naturally, patients and 
families, as well as clinicians, want to know the cause of schizophrenia and 
what can be done to prevent it. After all, there are vaccines against some 
diseases like polio and smallpox, and preventive measures that ward off 
others (such as scurvy, which can be prevented by getting enough vitamin C 
in the diet).

26
Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia 
However, with many chronic physical illnesses (such as diabetes, arthritis, or 
high blood pressure), even when doctors know the body systems involved, 
they don’t know the specifics of why it occurs. In a person with diabetes, 
for example, the body doesn’t metabolize sugar the way it should, and the 
body either doesn’t produce enough insulin or the insulin that the body does 
produce doesn’t work the way it should to control blood sugar. But no one 
really knows why. So, although doctors know where something is wrong but 
can’t explain what caused it to go wrong.
Similarly, when it comes to schizophrenia, scientists still don’t know why 
one person gets the disorder and another doesn’t, why someone gets it at 
one age and not at another, or why one person develops it after some 
environmental stressor and another person doesn’t. Doctors do know that 
the genetic makeup of some people makes them more prone to develop 
schizophrenia than others, and researchers have identified some of the brain 
mechanisms that are faulty.
In the following sections we cover what the medical community knows about 
the brain and schizophrenia. We also debunk some common myths about the 
disease.
Looking at the human brain
The human brain is composed of billions of cells that are able to connect or 
communicate with one another by electrochemical (electrical and chemical) 
means. When a cell is stimulated, it releases a very small amount of a chemi-
cal known as a neurotransmitter. For a brief moment, the presence of that 
neurotransmitter causes the next cell to be stimulated. Different kinds of 
cells have different chemical neurotransmitters, and one of the most impor-
tant neurotransmitters is called dopamine. Cells that release dopamine and 
that have dopamine receptors are found in different areas of the brain.
When certain drugs are given that increase dopamine levels, they cause an 
individual’s dopamine system to become active. If a person with schizophre-
nia receives such a drug, he temporarily becomes more symptomatic (for 
example, experiencing more hallucinations or becoming more suspicious). 
On the other hand, medications that block the dopamine receptors and 
reduce the activity of the dopamine system are effective in treating some of 
the symptoms of schizophrenia.
Studies have shown that medications that are strongest in blocking dop-
amine receptors are also the most potent in treating the positive symptoms 
of schizophrenia, like delusions, hallucinations, and agitation (see Chapter 3 
for more on positive symptoms). This doesn’t mean that dopamine is the 

27
 Chapter 2: Causes and Risk Factors
cause of schizophrenia — it just means that the dopamine system is involved 
in regulating the symptoms of the disorder, just like insulin is involved in 
regulating the level of blood sugar. One theory of how schizophrenia symp-
toms are produced is that there is an excess of dopamine in certain parts of 
the brain.
 
One reason that it’s so difficult to pinpoint the cause of schizophrenia may be 
because the diagnosis may actually describe a group of disorders that produce 
similar symptoms rather than a single disorder. For example, in looking at 
memory loss, scientists now recognize that similar symptoms are produced 
by various disorders (including Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, 
and frontotemporal dementia), by traumatic brain injury, or even by certain 
kinds of poisons.
Separating the myths from reality
Schizophrenia isn’t a new disease. Even before the disease had a name, 
there were numerous theories about its symptoms that later came to define 
the disorder. In the days of Hippocrates (about 460 b.c. to 370 b.c.), it was 
believed that people with mental illnesses were possessed by the devil 
because they heard voices and saw visions. Priests used religious rites and 
exorcisms in hopes of a cure. In the 17th century, during the Inquisition, 
people with the same symptoms were thought to be witches and were 
burned at the stake.
In the late 1800s, a German psychiatrist named Emil Kraepelin called the 
same symptoms dementia praecox — attributing them to “the sub-acute 
development of a peculiar simple condition of mental weakness occurring at 
a youthful age.”
Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler coined the term the schizophrenias, borrow-
ing the term from the Greek root schizein phren or “split mind” and using 
the plural form. Bleuler didn’t think the disorder was a form of dementia, nor 
did he believe that it was solely a disease of the young.
As recently as the mid-1900s, many mental health professionals were sure 
that schizophrenia was caused by poor parenting, especially bad mothering. 
Unfortunately, old myths die hard, and many people who were taught and 
believed these obsolete theories long ago still practice psychiatry and 
psychology today.
Here are two of the most common bad-parenting myths:

28
Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia 
 
 The schizophrenogenic mother theory: Freudian psychoanalysts 
theorized that pathological mothers created pathological offspring with 
schizophrenia. The term schizophrenogenic mother was used to describe 
mothers who were accused of being too aloof, too cold and withholding, 
or too permissive and doting. Understandably, this made many mothers 
feel guilty and responsible for something they did or didn’t do, led to 
marital problems (with one spouse accusing the other of causing the 
illness), and alienated patients with schizophrenia from their mothers. 
Even well-meaning clinicians erected barriers between mothers and 
their offspring, creating a climate of mistrust that, to some degree, still 
exists today.
 
 The double-bind theory: Although mixed messages can be confusing, 
they don’t cause schizophrenia. However, the idea that mixed messages 
cause schizophrenia was the essence of a theory developed in the 
1950s by British anthropologist Gregory Bateson. He believed that the 
root cause of schizophrenia was the conflicting communications that 
children receive from their parents. For example, a mother may express 
warm sentiments in her words but come across sounding cold and 
detached in her tone. Or a mother and father may respond differently 
to the same event, one parent condemning and the other condoning the 
behavior of the child.
 
 Bateson believed that children, who are unable to make sense of these 
contradictory messages, act out with delusional symptoms, the outward 
manifestation of conflict and anxiety created by the double bind. After 
all these years, this theory has never been proven or shown to have a 
useful application in the treatment of schizophrenia.
 
Although these ideas about schizophrenia were once in fashion, they are 
now considered myths. If any clinician treating your loved one still believes 
or follows them, your loved one may not get appropriate treatment and 
care. Finding out if this is the case is easy. If you suspect that a therapist has 
such an orientation, you might simply ask, “Could I be the cause of my son or 
daughter’s illness?” If he says yes, find another doctor.
 
Beware of any clinician who blames you for your relative’s illness. 
Schizophrenia is a no-fault illness that isn’t caused by parents. Even more 
important, insight-oriented psychotherapy (therapy focused on unconscious 
psychological conflicts) or psychoanalysis (therapy focused on Freud’s theo-
ries, which include free association, dream interpretation, and transference) 
can be harmful to patients with schizophrenia. If a clinician proposes 
psychoanalysis for the primary or sole treatment of your loved one, head 
for the door.
Over the past 50 years, with advances in mental health research, these myths 
have been disproved, but new ones emerge all the time (see Chapter 16). 
For example, many people think that schizophrenia means a split or multiple 
personality, a myth that’s been perpetuated by TV shows and movies like 
The Three Faces of Eve.

29
 Chapter 2: Causes and Risk Factors
Today, assertions about schizophrenia and its treatment are more likely to 
be subject to empirical study before they’re adopted. In fact, one of the most 
encouraging aspects of schizophrenia treatment is the enormous amount 
of research currently going on and the many new research tools (such as 
molecular biology, MRI and PET scans, and cognitive tests) available to study 
the disorder.
Looking at the Respective Roles 
of Nature and Nurture
Much like the question “Which came first — the chicken or the egg?”, the 
question “Which has more influence on your development — your genes or 
your environment?” can be endlessly debated. Is schizophrenia caused by 
nature (biology), by nurture (the way a person is raised or the person’s life 
experiences), or by some combination of the two?
One reason that this remains an issue is because, in the search for causes, 
scientists usually look in the area where they’ve done most of their work: 
Biologists look to biology for the answer, psychologists look to psychology, 
and so on. So who’s right? Maybe both.
Searching for the genes that cause schizophrenia
The study of genetics, molecular biology, and 
the human genome is accelerating at a rapid 
pace. Many studies have been conducted that 
attempt to link a single gene to schizophrenia, 
but none of the studies with positive findings 
have been replicated (repeated with the same 
results). Because of this, the current thinking is 
that genetic risk is real, but rather than it being 
caused by a single “big” gene, it’s probably a 
result of multiple “small” gene problems. This is 
known as the multigene theory of causation.
Even if the genes individually have a small 
effect, they likely interact with each other and 
also interact with environmental factors 
(see “Nurture: Looking at environmental 
factors,” in this chapter). The activity of some 
of these genes is known to be related to 
neurotransmitters like dopamine (see “Looking 
at the human brain,” earlier in this chapter), 
which, in turn, is linked to the positive symptoms 
of schizophrenia.
Remember: The genetic link in schizophrenia 
isn’t a simple one — it isn’t passed on directly 
like brown eyes or blond hair. It’s far more 
complex, involving multiple genes and other 
factors.

30
Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia 
For example, in studies of the genetics of schizophrenia, studies have clearly 
shown that, with identical twins, if one twin has schizophrenia, there’s about 
a 40 percent chance that the second twin will have schizophrenia as well. For 
fraternal twins, the rate is less than half of that. To the biologist, this shows 
that nature, or genetics, is the cause. For the non-biologically-oriented, these 
facts offer proof that, even with identical chromosomes, biology doesn’t 
provide a conclusive answer.
There is clear evidence that genetics plays a major role in schizophrenia and, 
increasingly, that environmental factors also play a role. This evidence has 
given rise to what is known as the two-hit theory of schizophrenia, the idea 
that genetic susceptibility is compounded by environmental (psychological, 
social, or physical) factors. This theory has led to a search for risk factors 
that contribute to the onset of the disorder.
Nature: Focusing on your family tree
Genetic studies of families, twins, and adoptions have clearly shown that 
having a biological history of schizophrenia in family increases the risk that a 
person will develop the disorder:
 
 In studies of identical twins, if one twin has schizophrenia, it increases 
the risk that the other one will have it too by about 40 percent.
 
 If one fraternal twin has schizophrenia, there is a 10 percent to 17 
percent chance the other one will have it too.
 
 If one parent has schizophrenia, the risk of the offspring having 
schizophrenia is about 10 percent.
 
 If both parents have schizophrenia, the risk of the offspring having 
schizophrenia increases to between 30 percent to 46 percent.
The risk of developing schizophrenia is greater in people with a history of the 
disorder in their immediate families than it is in the general population.
 
Although family history is an important risk factor, 80 percent to 90 percent of 
people with schizophrenia have no family history of the disease. Additionally, 
the fact that in the case of identical twins, one may become schizophrenic 
while one may not, indicates that susceptibility for schizophrenia is deter-
mined by more than genetics alone.
Nurture: Looking at environmental factors
No one environmental factor by itself has been shown to cause schizophre-
nia. But a number of environmental factors may increase the risk or chance 
of schizophrenia occurring. Many people experience the same environmental 

31
 Chapter 2: Causes and Risk Factors
factors, but few of them develop schizophrenia. It may well take a combina-
tion of genetic vulnerability and environmental triggers occurring together 
for schizophrenia to develop.
For example, if a person has a parent with schizophrenia, that person’s 
chance of developing schizophrenia is about 10 percent. But if one or more 
environmental triggers happen on top of this family history, schizophrenia 
may occur. It’s sort of like those proverbial straws being piled on the back of 
a camel; the camel may be able to stand strong with a few of those straws, 
but eventually, one of those straws will break the camel’s back. The number 
of straws varies from one person to the next, and medical professionals have 
no way of knowing how many a particular person will be able to withstand.
In the following sections, we cover some of the environmental factors that 
may contribute to the development of schizophrenia.
Prenatal factors
What happens to you before you’re born — or during the process of birth — 
can affect you all your life. The likelihood of schizophrenia developing has 
been linked to several prenatal (before birth) factors:
 
 The age of the birth father: One prenatal risk factor that’s been linked 
to schizophrenia is the age of the birth father. Children with fathers who 
are over the age of 50 are three times more likely to develop schizophre-
nia than children whose fathers are under 30 years old at the time of 
their birth. Some researchers have suggested that this may be the result 
of sperm mutations that occur with advancing age.
 
 Influenza: Studies have shown that children born to mothers who con-
tracted the flu while pregnant (especially during the second trimester) 
also have a greater chance of developing schizophrenia.
 
 Starvation: Maternal starvation is linked to increased risk of schizophre-
nia in offspring. Starvation can occur either because of poverty or 
because of eating disorders such as anorexia.
 
 Stress: Recently, a large epidemiological study looked at stressors such 
as the death of a close relative or a diagnosis of cancer, heart attack, or 
stroke in a close relative as risk factors for having children who would 
develop schizophrenia later in life. Only one of these factors increased 
risk: The risk of developing schizophrenia or a related disorder was 67 
percent greater among the children of mothers who experienced the 
death of a close family member during the first trimester than those who 
did not have that stress.
 
The vast majority of fetuses exposed to these prenatal environmental 
stressors did not develop schizophrenia, leaving the perplexing question of 
why some did and others didn’t still unanswered.

32
Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia 
Obstetrical and birth complications
The ways in which birth complications double the risk for schizophrenia 
are not known. But several studies show that various obstetrical and birth 
complications do increase risk.
A statistical review of multiple studies looking at the link between obstetric 
complications and schizophrenia found three groups of complications 
associated with the disorder:
 
 Complications of pregnancy, including bleeding, diabetes, Rh incompat-
ibility, and pregnancy-induced high blood pressure
 
 Abnormal fetal growth and development, including low birth weight, 
cardiovascular congenital anomalies, and small head circumference
 
 Complications of delivery, including lack of uterine muscle tone, 
inadequate oxygen intake by the baby, and emergency cesarean section 
(C-section)
Other life experiences
Although parents have been let off the hook as far as finger-pointing blame 
for schizophrenia goes, the current consensus is that other environmental 
stressors and stress in general may contribute to the onset of schizophrenia. 
For example, urban life, geographic migration, and poverty are all associated 
with increased rates of schizophrenia.
Other studies have shown that individuals with schizophrenia smoke mari-
juana more often than the general population. Some prospective studies now 
show that smoking marijuana (before the onset of psychotic symptoms) 
increases the likelihood of schizophrenia by two to four times. On the other 
hand, the overwhelming majority of people who smoke marijuana don’t 
develop schizophrenia.
Viral speculations
For many years, researchers have speculated 
that viral infections can damage parts of the 
brain, leading to some of the sensory distur-
bances associated with schizophrenia. One 
known characteristic of viral infections is that 
they can attack some parts of the brain, leaving 
other parts unscathed.
Although these theories are still being investi-
gated, research findings remain inconclusive. 
No specific virus has been identified that can be 
considered a cause of the disorder and scien-
tists still do not understand when or under what 
circumstances viral infections affect the brains 
of people diagnosed with schizophrenia.

33
 Chapter 2: Causes and Risk Factors
So is use of marijuana a risk factor for schizophrenia or do people with 
schizophrenia use marijuana to self-medicate? And is smoking marijuana by 
itself a risk factor? Some studies suggest that it may only be a risk factor if 
certain genetic factors are also present. For example, people who have a 
variant of a specific enzyme (called COMT) that is important in dopamine 
metabolism (which is implicated in schizophrenia — see “Looking at the 
brain,” earlier in this chapter), develop psychosis more often than those who 
don’t have this specific variant gene configuration. This situation is a very 
good example, perhaps even a model, of how an environmental influence 
(the use of marijuana) and a genetic factor may interact together to increase 
the risk of schizophrenia.
Finding Out More about Risk Factors 
by Looking at Individual Differences
Schizophrenia can occur at any age — but why? Why do some people 
develop schizophrenia any time from childhood (which is extremely rare — 
only 1 in approximately 40,000 children is diagnosed with schizophrenia) 
to old age (1 percent to 2 percent of cases are diagnosed in people over age 
80). Are there genetic differences? Environmental differences? Hormonal 
differences? Or does a combination of these factors result in some people 
developing schizophrenia as children and others not until they’re senior 
citizens? Or are there different types of schizophrenia that vary with age?
Childhood schizophrenia can be difficult to diagnose, for several reasons:
 
 Childhood schizophrenia symptoms tend to surface more gradually than 
the psychotic break common in adults.
Nutritional theories
With so much medical and cultural emphasis on 
the link between diet and health, it isn’t surpris-
ing that people wonder whether schizophrenia 
may be due to eating too much of the wrong 
thing or too little of something that’s good 
for you. Although some associations have 
been found that link schizophrenia with 
increased consumption of refined sugars, it’s a 
far stretch to suggest that refined sugars cause 
the disorder.
In fact, there is no systematic research that 
suggests that any vitamin, nutrient, specific 
food, or food allergy can cause schizophrenia.

34
Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia 
 
 Often, childhood schizophrenia is misdiagnosed as autism (which 
generally appears before the age of 3), one of several other pervasive 
developmental disorders, bipolar disorder, depression, dissociative 
disorder (disruption of memory, awareness, or consciousness), or 
substance abuse.
 
 Hallucinations are commonly associated with childhood bipolar or dis-
sociative disorders as opposed to schizophrenia, but the hallucinations 
of childhood schizophrenia are more pervasive, long-lasting, and 
continuous (as opposed to being brief and intermittent).
No one is sure about the relative contributions of genetics versus prenatal 
or environmental stress when it comes to the development of schizophrenia 
in children or adults. But there is ongoing research looking at schizophrenia 
across the life span. Some imaging studies have found that children with 
schizophrenia are more likely to develop abnormalities in brain structure 
as compared to those with a later onset of the disorder. Recent research 
supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) links a particular 
gene (called NGR1), which is implicated in schizophrenia in adults, to 
adverse effects on brain development in children. This suggests a continuum 
between the child and adult-onset disorders.
Although scientists once believed that the brain finished developing in early 
childhood, they now realize that connections in the brain are refined well 
into a child’s teens. The parts of the brain involved in planning, decision-
making, and reasoning are still taking shape during these years. Based on 
imaging, scientists know that as the brain develops, certain structures are 
more involved in mental illness than others. For example, in the brains of 
adolescents with schizophrenia, there is a significant change in gray matter.
Gender also plays a role in when schizophrenia is diagnosed. Women are 
more likely to be diagnosed with a later onset of the disorder than men. 
Some researchers have hypothesized that it occurs later in women because 
estrogen plays a protective role in warding off symptoms of schizophrenia.
What Science Still Doesn’t Know
Clearly, the cause or causes of schizophrenia are still unknown. Scientists 
aren’t even certain whether schizophrenia is one disorder that manifests 
itself in different ways (referred to as a spectrum disorder), or whether 
schizophrenia is more than one disorder with overlapping symptoms. Similar 
dilemmas have existed and do exist with other medical problems. For 
example, is cancer due to one underlying cause, or are there many cancers 
with many causes?

35
 Chapter 2: Causes and Risk Factors
Even if science finds a single cause for schizophrenia (for example, a specific 
gene), it won’t necessarily lead to a way to prevent or effectively treat the 
disorder. (In 1993, the Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research Group 
isolated the precise genetic defect that causes Huntington’s disease. But even 
with that discovery, a strategy for both prevention and definitive treatment 
still eludes scientists.) Although it may not have the same luster or star 
power as the discovery of one specific cause, the identification of risk factors 
and an understanding of the ways that risk factors impact the structure and 
function of the brain may actually turn out to be a more productive 
approach.
Some risk factors may be controllable (like cholesterol levels are for 
coronary artery disease). Other risk factors may lead medical professionals 
to earlier methods of detection. And by learning the ways that risk factors 
bring about brain changes, we may actually be able to disrupt the biological 
or psychological pathways that give rise to the suffering and disability 
associated with schizophrenia.
 
It’s vital for scientists to work tenaciously to uncover the causes of schizo-
phrenia. Such investigations are likely to yield important clues about how the 
disorder can be prevented and lead to improved treatments and care. But 
wracking your brain about why your loved one developed schizophrenia and 
searching for specific causes in your particular case is an exercise in futility 
for several reasons:
 
 Given the state of current knowledge, neither you nor any doctor will be 
able to figure out precisely why it happened in a particular situation.
 
 As much as you might like to, there is no way you can go back and 
change the past.
 
 More important, searching for a cause (or looking to place blame) can 
serve as a distraction from coping with your situation, and moving 
toward acceptance, treatment, and recovery.

f you’re like most people, you probably know little about schizophrenia 
aside from what you’ve seen on TV or in the movies — much of which 
was probably sensationalistic and inaccurate. You’re more likely to be 
familiar with stereotypes than facts. Yet, there’s no denying it: The symptoms 
associated with schizophrenia can be truly frightening, especially if the 
disorder isn’t accurately diagnosed and treated.
As is the case in general medicine, appropriate treatment requires an 
accurate diagnosis. Chapter 4 outlines the criteria that professionals use to 
diagnose schizophrenia — including the specific signs and symptoms that 
need to be present for a defined period of time, and that lead to functional 
impairments. That chapter also describes exclusion criteria — criteria 
that diminish the likelihood of a diagnosis of schizophrenia and suggest 
something else.
In this chapter, we describe the wide range of symptoms and signs that 
are seen in people with schizophrenia, as well as some of the telltale 
warning signs.
Recognizing the Symptoms and 
Signs of Schizophrenia
Like other medical disorders, schizophrenia is an illness that is characterized 
by symptoms and signs. Symptoms are descriptions of what a person is 
experiencing (often verbalized in the form of complaints). Typically, when 

38
Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia 
patients visit their doctors, they freely volunteer descriptions of their symp-
toms (although this isn’t always the case with people with schizophrenia who 
often lack insight; see Chapter 6):
 
 I feel confused and can’t think straight.
 
 I feel so depressed and have no energy.
 
 I haven’t been able to sleep or get out of bed.
Other times (when people aren’t aware of what they’re feeling), a friend, 
family member, or doctor may ask one or more questions designed to elicit 
symptoms — for example:
 
 You look very pale. Are you feeling okay?
 
 How is your mood? You seem so sad.
 
 You look like you’re distracted. Are you hearing voices?
 
 I’m worried about you. Are you thinking of hurting yourself?
Signs are observations that are made about a person based upon what others 
see, without the individual necessarily verbalizing his problems. For example:
 
 You see someone crying.
 
 You see someone sweaty and shaky.
 
 You see someone refusing to eat or drink.
 
 You see someone staring into space.
 
Not every person with a particular disorder will have the same symptoms and 
signs. And no person will have all of them. For each individual, symptoms 
and signs may change in severity, reappear, or disappear over time.
The primary symptoms associated with schizophrenia fall into three broad 
categories: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive symptoms. 
And some other symptoms don’t fall neatly into any of these categories. We 
cover these in the following sections.
Positive symptoms: What’s there
Positive symptoms are the easiest to see, the most dramatic, and, in general, 
the ones that demand attention. One reason they’re referred to as positive 
symptoms is that they add to, or alter reality. Twenty years ago, positive 
symptoms were the only symptoms that were noticed because they’re the 
ones that are most closely tied to psychosis.

39
 Chapter 3: Suspecting Schizophrenia
 
The term psychosis doesn’t refer to a specific disorder (such as schizophrenia, 
depression, or bipolar disorder) but rather to the condition of being out of 
touch with reality. Psychosis is usually a temporary state — one in which a 
person is having positive symptoms like delusions, hallucinations, or other 
grossly abnormal distortions of thinking and perception, which we cover in 
more detail later in this chapter.
Before the availability of antipsychotic medications, persons with schizo-
phrenia, and those who cared for them, spent most of their energies trying to 
control the tormenting positive symptoms that made patients agitated and 
unapproachable.
 
Symptoms may appear slowly over time, or may come on suddenly and 
intensely like an acute fever. In either case, it’s important to recognize when 
something seems wrong and to seek immediate professional medical and/or 
mental-health help.
Hallucinations
Hallucinations are false sensory perceptions. They’re probably the most 
dramatic or frightening symptoms of schizophrenia, both to the person with 
the disorder and to those around her. These false perceptions can affect all 
the senses:
 
 Hearing, in the form of auditory hallucinations: The person hears voices 
or sounds that aren’t there. Auditory hallucinations are the most 
common type.
 
 Sight, in the form of visual hallucinations: The person sees something 
that isn’t really there. Visual hallucinations may be visions or signs to 
which the individual with schizophrenia attaches great meaning or 
significance.
 
 Smell, in the form of olfactory hallucinations: The person smells odors, 
usually bad ones, like rotting organic matter, that no one else smells.
 
 Touch, in the form of tactile hallucinations: The person feels the pres-
ence or touch of someone or something when no one is actually present. 
People with both mental illness and substance-use disorders commonly 
feel bugs crawling over their bodies (sometimes as a result of using 
cocaine).
Hallucinations are perceptions that are experienced only by the individual 
with schizophrenia and are not shared by others. Most hallucinations are 
frightening, especially initially, but then the individual may find some way to 
incorporate the hallucination into his altered reality in an effort to make it 
more understandable.

40
Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia 
Auditory hallucinations are, by far, the most common type of hallucination. 
They are experienced differently by different patients, but often, they begin 
with whispers or mumbling and then become clearer. The person experienc-
ing the voices is unable to recognize that they’re coming from within her own 
head; instead, she attributes them to coming from outside her, like other 
voices or sounds people hear.
The voices are often threatening or accusatory, blaming the individual for 
having done something bad. When the voices persistently order a person to 
do something that he wouldn’t ordinarily do, or wouldn’t even think of doing, 
these are called command hallucinations. Sometimes a person will initially 
reject the voices or complain about them, but may later become convinced 
that the voices are “real” and even try to talk back to them.
Someone who’s experiencing auditory hallucinations may seem to be in a 
world of her own, not listening to others or staring into space. Other times, 
a person experiencing auditory hallucinations may try to listen to the real 
person she’s with, but “the voices” make it seem as if she’s listening to two 
or more people speaking at the same time, which makes it hard to respond 
correctly or quickly.
The voices may be very persistent (even interfering with sleep), or they may 
come and go, with the individual unable to predict when they’ll recur — a 
frightening experience. Stressful situations can make auditory hallucinations 
worsen, but they can intensify for no reason at all. If a person with schizo-
phrenia is confronted with the reality that no one else hears the same 
voices, the individual may simply stop talking about them or not tell others 
that she’s hearing them. Treatment with antipsychotic medication usually 
decreases or removes the voices entirely, or reduces the individual’s concern 
about or fear of them.
Delusions
Delusions are false beliefs that the person with schizophrenia accepts as true; 
no amount of evidence or explanation can change the person’s belief. Most 
frequently, delusions take the form of a belief that some individual or group 
is after the person with schizophrenia or wants to harm or control him. 
Delusions are often accompanied by feelings of suspiciousness, which are 
then referred to as paranoid delusions.
Sometimes the delusions are not clearly formed, and the person feels 
suspicious or threatened but doesn’t attribute it to a particular individual or 
group. Other times, the individual may believe she has been given great or 
unusual powers and is able to do things that normal humans cannot do. 
These delusions are referred to as delusions of grandeur, which are often, 
but not always, associated with religious beliefs. For example, someone 
may believe that he is Jesus Christ, the devil, or some important person 
in history.

41
 Chapter 3: Suspecting Schizophrenia
Voices may tell the person that he has great powers. There may be accompa-
nying visions and signs, which “prove” to the individual that what the voices 
are saying is true. Generally, no rational discussion can dissuade someone 
from his false belief. In fact, confronting the individual with the truth often 
angers the person with schizophrenia and convinces him that anyone who 
doesn’t share his beliefs is against him.
 
Directly confronting delusional thoughts or beliefs often worsens the 
situation. Just not agreeing to or not directly confirming the false belief may 
be a wiser approach.
 
Because psychotic thinking is the result of a brain disorder, trying to make 
sense of the content of the hallucination or delusion is as useless as trying to 
understand the meaning of a kidney stone! Instead of wasting time and energy 
trying to understand what it means, recognize it as a sign of disturbed thinking 
and focus on getting your loved one the help he needs.
Antipsychotic medications often lessen or eliminate delusional thinking to 
the point where a skilled therapist can then discuss the problem of the false 
belief with the person.
The 2002 Academy Award–winning film A Beautiful Mind vividly portrays the 
delusions and visual hallucinations experienced by mathematician John 
Nash, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia. It has played a pivotal role in 
raising awareness about the symptoms of schizophrenia for a generation of 
moviegoers.
Disorganized thinking
Less dramatic, but just as damaging to a person’s ability to function in reality 
is another positive symptom known as disorganized thinking, which can affect 
speech and/or writing. Instead of being able to hold an organized and logical 
conversation (thinking about one topic or one issue in a proper sequence), 
the person with schizophrenia may:
 
 Jump from one topic to another.
 
 Make up words that don’t exist. These words are known as neologisms.
 
 Repeat words or thoughts.
 
 Jump from one word to another that sounds alike but really has no 
relationship to the first word.
The individual may sound very earnest, and feel like he’s making sense, but 
other people are unable to follow his train of thought or logic. This situation 
may be just as frustrating to the speaker as it is to the listener.

42
Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia 
When you think about hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking, 
you realize how severe these positive symptoms can be and how they 
undermine an individual’s ability to think coherently and rationally. (See 
Chapter 12 for techniques for coping with these symptoms.)
Negative symptoms: What’s missing
Negative symptoms are what’s missing or lacking in an individual’s mind 
and behavior as a result of schizophrenia. Negative symptoms often aren’t as 
well defined or clear cut as positive ones, so they’re often confused with 
depression or laziness — but they’re part of schizophrenia and can be just 
as debilitating.
 
No matter how they look from the outside, negative symptoms are part of a 
brain disorder. They aren’t due to a lack of moral fiber on the part of the 
person with the illness.
An individual with negative symptoms of schizophrenia may have a blank 
stare that looks “spacey.” She may seem unresponsive to other people and 
things in the environment. Also, the individual’s speech may be monotone or 
flat, without any inflection offering you a hint of her true feelings. The person 
with negative symptoms of schizophrenia may also display the following 
symptoms:
 
 An inability to experience simple pleasure from people or things 
around him: This is known as anhedonia.
 
 Lack of initiative, motivation, or willfulness: This is known as avolition.
 
 Lack of or limited speech: The person may be slow in responding, have 
only a limited range of response, or not even respond at all. This is 
known as alogia.
 
 A lack of emotions or feelings: The person may look expressionless — 
not showing any signs of happiness, excitement, or anger. This is known 
as flat or blunted affect. Some research suggests that this may be more a 
matter of appearance rather than a reflection of the individual’s inability 
to feel emotions.
After treatment, many families complain that while their relative is no longer 
psychotic, the person is “wasting her life” watching television in a room with 
few outside interests. They feel very frustrated because nothing they do or 
say motivates the person to become more engaged in the world around her. 
Families need to understand that this isn’t something the person has control 
over or is doing to annoy them — it’s part of the illness.
People used to think that these symptoms were the result of the side effects 
of medication or of institutional treatment (which, in the past, often included 
long hospital stays). But today, most experts agree that negative symptoms 

43
 Chapter 3: Suspecting Schizophrenia
are probably due to brain dysfunction. Some researchers have studied 
people with schizophrenia early in the course of their illness and found that 
they had motivational deficits even then. Many believe, in fact, that negative 
symptoms may emerge before positive ones do.
Although medication is highly effective in treating positive symptoms, it has 
been less successful in treating negative symptoms, which can remain 
unchanged or only marginally improved even when positive symptoms go 
away. It is generally believed that newer antipsychotic medications (see 
Chapter 8) are just as effective as older ones in controlling positive symp-
toms, but may be slightly more successful in minimizing negative symptoms.
Approximately one in four patients with schizophrenia may have deficit 
syndrome, persistent negative symptoms that are not secondary or due to 
other causes (such as depression or medication side effects). The impor-
tance of finding ways to treat negative symptoms can’t be underestimated. 
Failure to do so can compromise an individual’s quality of life and impair 
her ability to work and maintain meaningful social ties.
Cognitive symptoms: Changes 
in mental functioning
Unfortunately, even when positive symptoms are controlled, people with 
schizophrenia may have severe problems with cognitive (thinking) tasks. A 
person with schizophrenia may be unable to remember things he’s been told, 
and he may have problems following directions or keeping track of time or 
appointments. For example, a person with schizophrenia may not be able to 
remember or follow simple instructions like “If you feel agitated, don’t drink 
coffee.” Following directions about which prescribed medications to take in 
the morning and which to take in the evening can be just as difficult.
If the person returns to school or work, tasks that were in the past very 
doable, can now seem insurmountable. For example, the person may be 
unable to focus or concentrate. Neuropsychologists have devised and 
administered very specific tests to identify the particular thinking problems 
and where they occur in the brain.
Working memory (the ability to hold a fact in mind to be used later — for 
example, to remember that the 4 p.m. train will be on track no. 5 has been 
found to be impaired in many people with schizophrenia, as have verbal abili-
ties. Cognitive symptoms make it extremely difficult for some people with 
schizophrenia to carry out what seem like simple tasks or to be able to hold 
down a job. For example, people with this type of cognitive problem should 
choose jobs that maximize their skills and minimize the need for working 
memory. (It might be difficult for them to be waiters who have to remember 
complex orders in a busy restaurant.)

44
Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia 
In fact, it has been found that cognitive symptoms and negative symptoms 
(see the “Negative symptoms: What’s missing” section, earlier) are more 
difficult for people to overcome than positive ones, and that they prevent 
recovery and a return to normal life in a more profound way than the more 
dramatic positive symptoms.
Because of the importance of cognitive symptoms in preventing recovery, the 
National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is supporting the development of 
a standard battery of neuropsychological tests to assess the severity of these 
problems in individuals. The NIMH is also supporting research to discover 
medications to treat cognitive impairments like the antipsychotic drugs used 
to treat hallucinations and delusions.
 
Negative symptoms and cognitive symptoms may sometimes get better or 
worse together — but they are really separate features of schizophrenia 
related to different areas and circuitry in the brain. Thus, positive, negative, 
and cognitive symptoms have to be treated separately, but concurrently, 
for a truly comprehensive approach to the treatment of schizophrenia. Many 
people now believe that negative and cognitive symptoms are really the core 
symptoms of schizophrenia and that, until there are effective treatments, 
schizophrenia will remain a major public-health problem.
 
Although there are currently no known effective medications to treat cognitive 
symptoms, various psychosocial interventions may be of help.
Other disturbing symptoms and behaviors
In addition to the three major categories of symptoms — positive, negative, 
and cognitive — other symptoms are frequently seen in people with schizo-
phrenia. These symptoms are not specific to schizophrenia — in fact, if 
these symptoms are seen alone (without the positive, negative, and cognitive 
symptoms we describe earlier), they probably indicate that the illness being 
seen is not schizophrenia. Typically these other symptoms are more likely to 
fluctuate in severity than positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms do.
 
As treatment progresses, these other symptoms tend to emerge, as the more 
obvious positive symptoms of schizophrenia tend to recede.
Again and again: Obsessive-compulsive behaviors
It is not uncommon for people with schizophrenia to engage in repetitive 
behaviors like rocking, rubbing their hands together, or getting up and down 
over and over. Likewise, individuals may complain that the same thought or 
idea keeps going through their minds even though they don’t want it to.

45
 Chapter 3: Suspecting Schizophrenia
 
Some of these repetitive unwanted behaviors are made worse when a particu-
lar antipsychotic medication, clozapine, is used to treat schizophrenia. 
Reducing the dosage of clozapine (brand name: Clozaril) will sometimes help. 
Adding an antidepressant medication like fluoxetine hydrochloride (brand 
name: Prozac), a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor (SSRI), may also help 
reduce the behavior.
Sometimes the need to move around and pace is not a compulsive behavior, 
but a side effect called akathisia, which is usually associated with high-
potency, first-generation antipsychotic medications like haloperidol (brand 
name: Haldol). (See Chapter 8 for a more in-depth discussion of psychotropic 
medications and their side-effects.)
Ups and downs: Mood swings
Shifts in mood, more often in the direction of sadness or depression rather 
than mania, are fairly common in schizophrenia. Depressive symptoms can 
be so severe and persistent that the diagnosis may change from schizophre-
nia to schizoaffective disorder (which includes elements of both a thought 
disorder and a mood disorder). The diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is 
even more likely if mood varies between depression and elation (known as 
hypomania). When this is the case, a mood stabilizer such as lithium or val-
proate (brand name: Depakote) will generally be added to the antipsychotic 
medication.
 
Depression sometimes becomes apparent when the person with schizophre-
nia is showing fewer positive symptoms, and he realizes how sick he’s been 
and how his life has been disrupted by the illness. Depression can become so 
severe that suicidal thoughts and behavior can occur. If suicidal thoughts 
become prominent, clozapine (brand name: Clozaril) has been found to be 
the most effective antipsychotic medication.
If sadness, loss of appetite, and sleeping difficulties become the prominent 
symptoms, treatment with an antidepressant drug is often indicated. Your 
loved one’s psychiatrist must be careful when starting someone on an antide-
pressant — they need to make sure that positive symptoms are not made 
worse or that your loved one isn’t moved toward manic behavior. Careful and 
accurate reporting — by the person with schizophrenia, as well as family 
and friends — will help the psychiatrist adjust the medication dosage.
Wired: High anxiety
A person with schizophrenia may sometimes feel excessively anxious or 
nervous, sometimes for no apparent reason. Anxiety may be so severe that 
it interferes with the person’s ability to fall asleep. Then the sleeplessness 
may exacerbate positive symptoms (especially paranoia). On a very short-
term basis, for severe anxiety, an anti-anxiety medication like Valium may be 
used, but an anti-anxiety med should not be used regularly or long term.

46
Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia 
 
Be sure to report back to the psychiatrist whether your loved one’s anxiety 
(nervousness, worry, sweating) is getting better, getting worse, or staying 
the same.
Sometimes if an individual is becoming increasingly anxious and positive 
symptoms are getting worse, the person may begin to display catatonic 
behavior, which is characterized by holding fixed positions for a long period 
of time. When the catatonic person’s arms are moved, there is a feeling of 
resistance, called waxy flexibility. The treatment for catatonic behavior usu-
ally entails increasing the dosage of antipsychotic medication.
Sleepless: Going on empty
Sleep problems are very common in people with psychiatric disorders. 
No one should be allowed to become truly sleep-deprived, because sleep 
deprivation can worsen the symptoms of schizophrenia. Instead of just 
prescribing a sleeping pill, the psychiatrist should try to understand why 
your loved one is not sleeping (for example, she may be afraid of symptoms, 
hearing noises, or sleeping too much during the day) and recommend an 
appropriate remedy.
Knowing Why Diagnosing 
Schizophrenia Is Tricky
If you ask families to describe the onset of schizophrenia, no two stories will 
be exactly the same. One reason that you’re likely to get widely divergent 
descriptions is because sometimes schizophrenia creeps in slowly until 
its appearance becomes blatant, and other times it appears to come on 
suddenly, like a bolt of lightning out of the blue.
The earliest signs of schizophrenia can be subtle and nonspecific, tending to 
wax and wane over the course of weeks, months, or even years. A person can 
be fine one morning, overtly psychotic the same evening, and fine again the 
next morning. When you’re living with an individual or seeing him every day, 
the changes taking place can be so subtle that you may not even realize that 
something is wrong. Another factor that comes into play: You’re always 
hoping for the best — that the symptoms will disappear on their own. Even 
looking back, you may be unable to mark the precise time when you could 
no longer deny that your loved one was ill and desperately needed help.
The term first break is used to define the onset of schizophrenia. It’s usually 
marked by both positive and negative symptoms that are serious enough 
that they obviously necessitate some form of treatment, which may or 
may not include hospitalization. (For an example of a first break that came 
on suddenly, check out the “It happened all of a sudden” sidebar, in this 
chapter. We’ve changed the names and details to protect people’s privacy.)

 Chapter 3: Suspecting Schizophrenia
It happened all of a sudden
Marge Faber, a homemaker and part-time real-
estate agent, breathed a sigh of relief when the 
last of her three boys was ready to go off to col-
lege. She and her husband, Frank, would have 
more time to travel and to visit their first grand-
child, whose parents had escaped the brutal 
winters of Buffalo, New York, and relocated to 
Tampa, Florida.
Marge’s youngest, 19-year-old Brett, was an 
easy-going kid who was always popular with 
his peers. Except for the usually sibling rivalry 
and competitiveness common among boys, the 
brothers got along exceptionally well. Brett 
admired his brothers, who were two and four 
years older than he was.
Brett was always a solid student, so he had his 
choice of schools to attend. When he was 
offered a soccer scholarship at a large univer-
sity in the Southwest, he enrolled in a program 
in the university’s College of Education. The 
summer before his freshman year, Brett worked 
at a local day camp as a swim instructor.
A week after Brett arrived on campus, he locked 
himself in his dorm and refused to eat. His room-
mates, who had only met him on Facebook 
(www.facebook.com), were concerned and 
told the resident assistant in the dorm. That 
same evening, Marge and Frank got a call from 
the school’s student health services alerting 
them to what had happened. They called 
Brett and couldn’t get a coherent story — he 
was whispering so low that they could barely 
hear him.
After a sleepless night, Marge and Frank flew 
out to check on Brett. When they arrived at the 
school, he was pacing and looked very nervous. 
He told them that he hadn’t been able to sleep 
or leave the dorm for meals because people in 
the next room were plotting a Columbine-style 
attack on campus. They asked questions, but 
Brett’s answers made no sense. They knew 
something was wrong.
This was the first time that Brett had been away 
from his close and very supportive family. 
Maybe he was having difficulty adjusting, 
Marge thought. So they stayed at a hotel close 
to campus for another week and visited Brett 
every day. But the situation didn’t improve. Brett 
still refused to eat or leave the room. He insisted 
on doing 250 push-ups to build up his strength, 
in case he needed to protect himself and his 
roommates. After doing just 20 push-ups, he fell 
to the floor in exhaustion. His parents called 911 
and accompanied Brett to the emergency room 
of the local hospital. A psychiatrist on call met 
with Brett when they arrived. Brett confided to 
the doctor that voices had been telling him to 
build his strength to ward off the attackers.
He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophre-
nia, and the doctor prescribed olanzapine 
(brand name: Zyprexa), which Brett agreed to 
take. Marge and Frank took him back to their 
hotel room for a week to watch over him. He 
told them that the voices weren’t as loud, but 
they were still there. The Fabers decided to take 
their son back to Buffalo for care until the next 
semester.
They were stunned. “He was the perfect child 
until he became ill,” Marge said, as she 
recounted the story 15 years later. At the age of 
34, Brett was never able to complete his educa-
tion and still lives at home in the same bedroom 
where he grew up, spending most of his time 
listening to music or watching TV. Over the 
years, he has been on a variety of medications, 
each with different side effects, but none has 
been able to completely quell the voices.

48
Part I: Understanding Schizophrenia 
Diagnosing schizophrenia is complicated by the fact that the typical age of 
onset of the disorder overlaps with the tumultuous roller-coaster years of 
adolescence. In teens, the first symptoms of schizophrenia tend to emerge 
so slowly or so vaguely that they mimic or overlap “normal” adolescent 
behaviors. With surging hormones and pressures to fit in with their peers, 
most teens tend to be moody and restless. Also, the typical teen is often 
prone to engage in risky behaviors, including experimentation with drugs 
and/or alcohol.
We always knew something was wrong
“She always seemed different,” said Liz Turner 
as she began to tell us about her daughter Erin, 
now 41 years old. “Something wasn’t right,” she 
said. Erin was Liz’s first child, so she really 
had no yardstick to gauge things by until her 
daughter Meg was born, ten years later. “There 
were signs I didn’t see or didn’t want to see,” 
Liz said.
Erin was oxygen-deprived at birth but “sort of” 
met all the milestones her mom faithfully chron-
icled in her baby book. Her speech was a bit 
delayed, and she wasn’t that responsive to 
other people. Everything annoyed her — from 
the labels on her clothes to the noise of the 
vacuum cleaner. By second grade, Erin was 
afraid to go to school and clung to her mother’s 
apron strings. By fifth grade, she tested high in 
certain subjects but was lower in others, espe-
cially mathematics. Erin was always considered 
a “cry-baby” by the other kids at school. In fact, 
she seemed to prefer to be alone and was never 
invited on play dates or to parties.
By the time Erin was a teen, she looked a bit 
eccentric — she’d dyed her hair pink and 
sported a tattoo on her ankle. She suddenly 
became very outgoing and began hanging out 
with a group of kids who were always getting 
into trouble. Liz found some marijuana in Erin’s 
room and knew she had been smoking but 
figured that kids would be kids — Erin wasn’t 
the only one of her peers smoking pot. Her 
moods changed on a dime, and her parents 
were baffled — unsure whether it was the drug 
use or something else.
One night, Erin stole several $20 bills and a gold 
necklace from a neighbor’s home. She let her-
self in the open back door and helped herself 
without thinking about the consequences. 
When the neighbor returned home and found 
her exiting the house, she was caught red-
handed. The neighbor, who was always irritated 
by the loud music coming from the Turners’ 
house, pressed charges.
A kind-hearted police officer said he would get 
the neighbors to drop the charges if the Turners 
took Erin for a psychiatric evaluation. They were 
humiliated by the thought of mental illness in 
their family, but they had no choice. The doctor 
met with Erin several times, and Erin admitted 
that she had been hearing voices — they had 
been such an integral part of her existence 
since she was a child that she thought everyone 
else heard them, too. She said that smoking pot 
made them go away, even for an hour or so.
The doctor spoke to the family and explained 
that Erin had a diagnosis of schizoaffective dis-
order. Liz’s husband, Tim, said that an aunt on 
his side of the family had some problems, but 
people didn’t talk about them much at the time. 
As stunned as they were, the family was happy 
that they finally could attach a name to what 
was wrong and get the proper medication to 
help treat the illness.

49
 Chapter 3: Suspecting Schizophrenia
The average parent — and even the average teacher or pediatrician — 
usually can’t differentiate between the typical turmoil of adolescence and 
the first warning signs of schizophrenia, especially when the symptoms or 
signs are masked by illicit substance use. For this reason, most parents of 
people with schizophrenia say they never understood the disease or recog-
nized its symptoms until long after it hit. (For an example of this, check out 
the sidebar, “We always knew something was wrong,” in this chapter. We’ve 
changed the names and details to protect people’s privacy.)
When to Worry: The Warning Signs
Before any overt signs of psychosis appear (in a period known as the 
prodromal phase), people with schizophrenia may experience some non-
psychotic symptoms that are the very first signs of the disorder. Here are 
some of the warning signs of schizophrenia:
 
 Social withdrawal and an increased tendency to remain alone
 
 A decline in performance at school or work
 
 Loss of motivation and an inability to concentrate
 
 Increased irritability, depression, and/or anxiety
 
 Suspiciousness
 
 Neglect of physical appearance
 
 Changes in sleep patterns
 
Talking about or actually trying to hurt or kill oneself isn’t a warning sign. 
It is a red flag that should be taken seriously. If your loved one is talking 
about suicide, you should take immediate action — have him evaluated by a 
mental-health clinician.
One study in Australia followed a group of approximately 100 young people 
with symptoms that didn’t quite meet the criteria for diagnosis, but who 
had a family history of schizophrenia, to see if they could predict those 
who would go on to develop the disorder. One-third of the group developed 
psychotic symptoms within a year, which was predicted with a high level of 
accuracy based on the research participants’ initial symptoms.
 
There is increasing recognition that the public, in general, needs to become 
mental-health literate and be able to recognize the earliest signs and symp-
toms of a mental-health problem. A 12-hour training program called Mental 
Health First Aid was developed in Australia to help the public identify, under-
stand, and respond to a mental-health problem or crisis. The program is being 
brought to communities across the United States under the sponsorship of 
the National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare. To find out more 
about the program, contact the National Council at 301-984-6200 or go to www.

Taking Action: Getting Treatment 
for Your Loved One Right Away
The duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is the period of time between the 
onset of the first psychotic symptoms and the time a person receives treat-
ment. According to a recent study commissioned by the National Alliance on 
Mental Illness (NAMI), the average duration of untreated psychosis is more 
than eight years. This lag is due to a number of factors, including:
 
 Stigma related to mental illnesses
 
 Lack of health insurance coupled with the high cost of care
 
 The limitations of mental-health literacy (the general public’s knowledge 
and beliefs concerning mental disorders)
Unlike many other physical or mental disorders, schizophrenia is a disorder 
that is rarely over-diagnosed or diagnosed too quickly. Even when family 
members are aware of symptoms and signs of the illness, they may fail to 
do anything, hoping the symptoms will resolve on their own. Plus, family 
doctors and pediatricians are often uncomfortable suggesting that a patient 
may have schizophrenia — it isn’t something they’re used to diagnosing or 
treating. And even psychiatrists may be reluctant to deliver the message.
If you suspect that someone you know may have schizophrenia, have the 
individual seen by a psychiatrist who specializes in the disorder. If you’re a 
parent or close relative, have confidence in your gut instinct that something 
is wrong and get it checked out; you’ve probably known the person longer 
and better than anyone else.
Getting a diagnosis is the first step in getting help. In most cases, your fears 
and suspicions will be allayed by someone who is expert and knowledgeable 
about diagnosis and treatment of the disorder. (Turn to Chapter 4 for more 
information on getting a diagnosis.)

n this part, we explain that arriving at a diagnosis of 
schizophrenia — and differentiating it from other dis-
orders — can be tricky and demands the training and 
expertise of a skilled clinician. You find out how to go 
about finding a psychiatrist and assembling a multidisci-
plinary healthcare team to provide the full range of coor-
dinated treatments, services, and supports that people 
with schizophrenia and their families need. Because 
denial (both by people with schizophrenia and their fami-
lies) is often a major barrier to treatment and recovery, 
we explain why denial occurs and how it can be over-
come. And we provide you with some of the concrete tips 
you need to navigate the complex system of care and

W
hether you’ve long suspected that something was wrong or you were 
blindsided by symptoms that appeared all of a sudden, now the 
symptoms that worried you finally have a name. This situation is probably 
somewhat reassuring but it will also raise many questions.
After a loved one is diagnosed with schizophrenia, you want to know more 
about how the diagnosis was made, how the symptoms of schizophrenia 
differ from other mental illnesses, and why the disorder is often confused 
with other health conditions. We wrote this chapter to answer those ques-
tions and to give you a glimpse of your loved one’s prospects for the future. 
We also provide some advice on how to adjust to a diagnosis that no one is 
prepared to hear, and let you know how and when to get a second opinion.
Understanding How Diagnoses Are Made
When you’re dealing with any type of disease, one of the first things you 
want from your doctor — besides getting a prescription to fix the problem — 
is a diagnosis. Being able to put a name to a set of symptoms helps people 
understand, accept, and deal with their disorder. At the same time, you may 
wonder how the doctor arrived at this diagnosis: How does he know it’s 
schizophrenia and not another type of mental disorder?
The next sections describe how doctors obtain information to make a 
diagnosis, what differentiates schizophrenia from other illnesses, and why 
people diagnosed with schizophrenia can have such varying symptoms.

54
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
Diagnosis: Giving a name 
to a set of symptoms
Just the word diagnosis can sound frightening and clinical. However, diagno-
ses are nothing more than the names given to various physical and mental 
disorders or diseases. A diagnosis is a generalization that describes what 
the average person with that disorder or disease experiences, and what can 
be expected in the future based on criteria that are periodically revised by 
the medical community.
The value of a diagnosis is that it provides a shorthand way of communicat-
ing important information about a medical condition, such as:
 
 The characteristic symptoms of the disorder
 
 The expected course (how it may vary over time)
 
 The prognosis of the disorder (the outlook for the future)
 
 Most important, options for treatment
 
With any illness — whether mental or physical — any one individual is 
unlikely to show all the symptoms and behaviors associated with a diagnosis. 
Your loved one with schizophrenia won’t fit the precise description of the 
disorder you find in textbooks, because everyone experiences the disorder in 
a somewhat unique way.
 
More recently, the term schizophrenia spectrum disorders has come into use to 
describe the variations in illness that fit under the name of schizophrenia.
Inside the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual: The psychiatric bible
The classification of various mental disorders and the criteria used to make 
diagnoses are found in a book called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association and 
often referred to simply as the DSM. The DSM is a consensus document, 
meaning that agreement has been reached by many professionals about what 
to name a particular disorder that has certain criteria, or characteristics, 
associated with it. It is used by psychiatrists and other mental-health 
professionals to make diagnoses.
The current DSM is the fourth edition of this official guide to diagnosis, so 
this edition is logically called DSM-IV. Editions or revisions come into being 
about every ten years, and the next edition is not expected before 2010. The 

55
 Chapter 4: Getting a Diagnosis
manual is massive (just under 1,000 pages) and includes 16 categories of 
mental disorders with multiple diagnoses in each category. Schizophrenia is 
part of the “schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders” category.
 
Many of the same symptoms can be found in more than one category or 
disorder, but every diagnosis is based on a pattern of symptoms as well as the 
history of the illness.
 
If you’re curious about the other categories of mental illness or want to 
look up something in the DSM-IV, you can find a copy at your local library, or 
preview portions of the book (search within the book) at http://books.
google.com/books?id=3SQrtpnHb9MC, or buy a copy at major online 
booksellers. The list price is $84.
Looking for Schizophrenia
Getting the right diagnosis is as important with mental illness as it is with 
physical illness, because, in all disease, treatment is determined by diagno-
sis. A psychiatrist or other mental-health professional makes a diagnosis 
by determining how closely a patient’s “story” fits the pattern of symptoms 
that have been identified for the particular disorder.
Differentiating among mental illnesses isn’t always easy, and a diagnosis may 
change over the course of years or even months. There are several reasons 
for this:
 
 Different mental illnesses often have overlapping symptoms.
 
 The predominant symptoms may ebb and flow in the same person 
over time. For example, when hallucinations and delusions are predomi-
nant, the person may be diagnosed with schizophrenia; when mood 
symptoms, like excitability or depression, dominate, the person may be 
diagnosed as having a mood disorder.
Diagnoses are made using information gleaned through verbal interviews 
with the patient, observations of his behavior, and, often, interviews with 
other people in the patient’s life. An accurate diagnosis also requires collect-
ing information about the recent history that led to the current problem, 
along with the lifetime history of behavioral or emotional problems in the 
individual and his family. When the individual who’s sick is unable or unwill-
ing to accurately articulate his story, family members or close friends can 
play a pivotal role by augmenting missing information and providing relevant 
medical records.
A complete examination includes a physical exam as well as general 
medical laboratory tests. When available, this information may be obtained 
from the patient’s general practitioner or internist. Although there is no 

56
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
specific laboratory test to detect schizophrenia, lab tests are used to rule 
out the possibility of physical disorders whose symptoms mimic those of 
mental disorders.
When the clinician — most often a psychiatrist (an MD who has special 
training in mental disorders) or another licensed mental-health professional 
(see Chapter 5 for more on different types of mental-health professionals) 
has all this information, the next task is to consider which of the numerous 
descriptions of mental disorders (diagnoses) best fits the patient’s 
symptoms, behavior, and history.
The elements of a psychiatric interview
When an individual comes to a clinician’s office for a psychiatric assessment 
(interview) — either on her own, brought by a family member or friend, or 
even escorted by law-enforcement authorities — an interview is used for 
making a diagnosis. We cover the main elements of a psychiatric interview in 
the following sections.
Determining the reason for the visit
The clinician will ask, “Why are you here?” to determine the person’s 
problems or symptoms and then will follow up with other similar questions 
to determine the nature of the person’s problems. Here a few examples of the 
kinds of questions the clinician may ask:
 
 What symptoms are you experiencing?
 
 When did they start?
 
 How often do they occur?
 
 Do your symptoms interfere with your school, work, or ability to take 
care of yourself?
 
 Do you hear voices? If so, what do they say?
 
 How often do you drink alcohol? How much? When?
 
 Have you ever used marijuana? Cocaine? Other drugs?
 
 Do you ever feel depressed?
 
 Do you ever have thoughts of hurting yourself?
Conducting a mental status examination
The clinician will generally conduct a mental status examination, which 
involves both observation by the clinician and direct questioning to 
determine the individual’s thought processes, mood, perception, orientation, 
memory, and so on.

57
 Chapter 4: Getting a Diagnosis
In addition to listening to the person, the clinician will observe the 
individual’s behavior:
 
 Is he sitting still, or fidgeting and moving around excessively?
 
 Does he appear to be distracted by sounds or voices that aren’t there?
 
 Does he cry easily? Laugh inappropriately? Change moods on a dime?
 
 Is he too talkative or too quiet?
 
 Does he seem impaired by alcohol and/or other drugs?
The clinician is looking for unusual behaviors or signs that are characteristic 
of a particular disorder.
Getting a good history
Because patients may be forgetful, anxious, or may not be thinking clearly, 
the clinician (or an assistant) may request the same information about symp-
toms, history of the problem, and family history from other reliable infor-
mants (such as family members or close friends). This information may be 
requested either during the initial diagnostic interview or at another time.
 
If you keep a notebook of detailed observations, that can really help your 
clinician make an accurate and timely diagnosis. (See Chapter 14 for more on 
keeping track of your loved one’s symptoms and treatments.)
Looking at the criteria for schizophrenia
A pattern of symptoms and behavior over a certain period of time has to be 
met before the clinician makes a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia.
The criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia are very specific:
 
 There must be a mixture of certain signs (observable behavior) and 
symptoms (verbally reported experiences) that are present for a signifi-
cant portion of time (over a one-month period), with some signs and 
symptoms present (but not necessarily continuously) for a minimum 
period of six months.
 
 If the signs and symptoms are present for one month, but less than six 
months, a formal diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is made. So 
between two visits, the diagnosis can change from schizophreniform to 
schizophrenia, just by virtue of the passage of time, without any change 
in symptoms.
To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia, certain inclusion criteria (required 
criteria) and exclusion criteria (disqualifying criteria) need to be met. Two 
or more of the following must be present for a significant portion of time 

58
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
during a one-month period in order for someone to be diagnosed with 
schizophrenia:
 
 Delusions: False, fixed beliefs that cannot be dispelled with logic.
 
 Hallucinations: False sensory perceptions, usually auditory, with no 
basis in reality.
 
 Disorganized speech: Speech that reflects illogical thinking and 
cognitive impairment.
 
 Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior: Observable dysfunctional 
movements or holding fixed immobile positions for long periods of time.
 
 Negative symptoms: For example, too little emotion for a given situation 
or no desire to carry out meaningful activities (see Chapter 2).
 
 Social and/or occupational dysfunction: The criterion of social and/
or occupational dysfunction must be met, which means the person is 
unable to function in one or more areas of everyday life (such as self 
care, work, school, or interpersonal relationships). The person is 
functioning markedly below the level at which she functioned before 
becoming ill.
If other symptoms or conditions are present, a diagnosis of schizophrenia 
cannot be made.
The most common exclusion is substance abuse. A variety of drugs that 
are often used illicitly — for example, stimulants (such as amphetamines), 
marijuana, PCP (also known as angel dust), cocaine, and hallucinogenic drugs 
(such as LSD and psilocybin or mescaline) — cause symptoms that mimic 
schizophrenia.
Other exclusion criteria are
 
 A history of severe mood swings (elation and/or depression) that 
would lead to alternative diagnoses of an affective (mood) disorder or 
schizoaffective disorder
 
 Evidence of a physical disorder — such as hormonal (thyroid or adrenal 
gland) problems or a tumor that may have spread to the brain and is 
giving rise to mental symptoms
 
Co-occurring mental-health and substance-abuse disorders are so common 
that the possibility of both occurring simultaneously should never be over-
looked. Because individuals who are diagnosed with schizophrenia often 
abuse alcohol, drugs, and/or other substances, accurate diagnosis may be 
complicated if an individual shows up in an emergency room without the 
clinician being able to obtain a reliable history. If the symptoms are solely the 
result of drug intoxication, they will usually disappear in a matter of hours or 
days. However, drug use sometimes triggers or leads to the onset of what will 
become a schizophreniform disorder or schizophrenia.

59
 Chapter 4: Getting a Diagnosis
Describing different types of schizophrenia
The DSM-IV recognizes four types of schizophrenia: catatonic, paranoid, 
disorganized, and undifferentiated. Because these terms are still used in the 
mental-health profession (and you may hear them from clinicians who are 
treating your loved one), we define them in the following sections, listing 
their predominant symptoms.
Frankly, we don’t think these terms are very useful in describing the severity 
of the illness or in directing treatment. It’s likely that in the next revision 
of the “bible,” old labels will give way to new ones. Instead of these labels, 
many clinicians prefer to use the terms positive, negative, and cognitive to 
describe their patients’ symptoms and approaches to treatment, remedia-
tion, rehabilitation, and recovery. (See Chapter 3 for more about positive, 
negative, and cognitive symptoms associated with schizophrenia.)
Catatonic
The term catatonic refers to abnormal motor activity. The individual may 
remain frozen in one position for long periods of time. He may display waxy 
flexibility (allowing himself to be moved) or become rigid and resist being 
moved, holding the position in which his arms or legs are placed.
Paranoid
The predominant symptoms of paranoia are delusions (fixed, false beliefs) 
and hallucinations (hearing voices) — although the individual may seem 
quite ordinary in other areas of functioning. The paranoid-type patient often 
believes that some group (such as the FBI, communists, or the Nazis) is after 
her, and she frequently hears voices that threaten, command, or berate her. 
No amount of reassurance or “proof” will convince her that she isn’t at risk, 
or that the voices aren’t real and are internal, coming from her brain rather 
than from the outside environment.
Disorganized
The main feature of disorganized schizophrenia is speech that is very 
disorganized, illogical, and hard to follow, often accompanied by feelings that 
are inappropriate or too shallow for what’s being said or discussed. Coherent 
delusional ideas are not present (in other words, if the person is delusional, 
you might not even be able to understand the delusion because of the 
person’s disorganized thinking and speech), and if there are hallucinations, 
they’re fragmentary and disorganized. The person may be so disorganized 
that he cannot adequately carry on activities of daily living (such as washing, 
dressing, and eating).
Undifferentiated
If an individual doesn’t have the characteristics or features of the other three 
types, she’s classified as undifferentiated. If new symptoms don’t emerge over 
a long a period of time, this type is sometimes also called the residual type.

The Great Imposters: Ruling Out 
Other Mental Conditions
To the casual observer, different mental disorders have similar symptoms. 
The diagnosis of schizophrenia is made primarily comparing an individual’s 
symptoms to the pattern of symptoms and behaviors characteristically 
associated with the disorder. However, even mental-health professionals 
admit that diagnosis is more an art than a physical science, because there 
are no laboratory tests or diagnostic X-rays that can definitively confirm 
the diagnosis.
For some physical disorders, health professionals have tools like blood 
tests and imaging procedures to help make an accurate diagnosis. In mental 
disorders, reliable diagnoses are achieved by conducting a thorough clinical 
interview, taking a very good history, and watching the evolution of the 
illness and sometimes its response to medication. A similar situation occurs 
in medicine when a patient has abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever 
and a doctor needs to determine whether it’s due to appendicitis, salmonella 
food poisoning, or a stomach virus. When the pattern of symptoms isn’t clear 
cut, it takes a skilled practitioner, a thorough work-up, and time to recognize 
the difference. Sometimes internists say that an illness needs time “to 
declare itself.”
 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are 
two brain imaging techniques that allow scientists to visualize the structure 
or function of the brain in great detail. Although many studies have demon-
strated structural differences in the brain between groups of people with or 
without schizophrenia, the differences are not large enough that they can be 
used clinically at this point in time to make or confirm diagnoses in any one 
individual.
In the following sections, we cover some of the disorders that make it 
challenging to distinguish between two or more disorders or conditions with 
similar symptoms.
Schizoaffective disorder
Despite the similar sounding names, schizoaffective disorder isn’t a type of 
schizophrenia. Rather, it’s another diagnosis that falls under the same DSM-IV 
category, “schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.”
Many of the symptoms that characterize schizoaffective disorder overlap 
with those of schizophrenia, and differentiating between the two is often 
difficult. The big difference is that, in schizoaffective disorder, there has been 
an uninterrupted period of illness that meets the criteria for a mood disorder 

61
 Chapter 4: Getting a Diagnosis
(characterized by major depression, mania, or a mixture of the two). This is 
in addition to, and concurrent with, the symptoms of schizophrenia (such as 
delusions and hallucinations).
 
There is an increased risk for suicide in people with schizoaffective disorder 
(which is often associated with profound depression). Also, appropriate treat-
ment for schizoaffective disorder often requires the use of mood stabilizers 
(such as lithium) or even antidepressant drugs, as well as antipsychotic 
medications.
 
One of the reasons for using medication in any illness is to relieve or reduce 
symptoms. Regardless of the specific diagnosis, the same medications or 
combinations of them may be used to treat similar symptoms.
Bipolar disorder
The onset of bipolar disorder (also called manic-depressive disorder), another 
severe mental disorder, is sometimes quite abrupt, beginning with manic or 
hypomanic (mildly manic) behavior. Although mental-health professionals 
used to believe that bipolar disorder occurred only in older people (unlike 
schizophrenia, which usually begins in a person’s teens or early 20s), it’s now 
recognized that even children and adolescents can have bipolar disorder.
Mania is characterized by an excess of energy (for example, staying up all 
night for days at a time without tiring), having grandiose ideas that border 
on delusions, and, perhaps, even having hallucinations. These symptoms 
overlap with those seen in sudden-onset schizophrenia, so the diagnoses can 
easily be confused.
The onset of bipolar disorder can also begin with depressive symptoms, such 
as a profoundly sad mood, sleeping too much or too little, a lack of interest in 
anything, the inability to experience pleasure (called anhedonia), and suicidal 
thoughts. Someone with bipolar disorder can also have delusions, especially 
of a self-deprecatory type, where the individual believes he’s responsible for 
many of the ills of the world, or that his body is rotting inside or is riddled 
with cancer.
A diagnosis of bipolar disorder is made on the basis of at least one episode 
of both manic and depressive symptoms, not necessarily alternating or in 
equal numbers. The overlap of symptoms with schizophrenia can initially 
lead to misdiagnosis, but usually the prominence of the mood symptoms 
(depression or mania) leads to the correct diagnosis and appropriate treat-
ment. For example, it’s not uncommon over a long period of illness for 
individuals to be diagnosed sequentially with schizophrenia, schizoaffective 
disorder, and bipolar disorder if their symptoms change. To learn more 
about bipolar disorder, see Bipolar Disorder For Dummies, by Candida Fink, 
MD, and Joe Kraynak (Wiley).

62
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
 
Because symptoms fluctuate, don’t be surprised if an individual’s diagnosis 
changes over time. This doesn’t necessarily mean that there has been a 
diagnostic error. It just means that the pattern of symptoms is different now, 
so a different diagnosis and treatment are indicated.
Severe depression
Some individuals may become severely depressed (see the preceding 
section) but never go on to exhibit manic behavior. They may experience 
repeated episodes of depression with delusions (sometimes called delusional 
depression) and/or hallucinations.
The person with severe depression shows no interest in things around her 
and may barely speak. Even if the severity of the episode decreases, the 
individual may remain aloof, slow-moving, and appear preoccupied. These 
symptoms can sometimes be confused with the symptoms of schizophrenia.
In severe depression, depressive mood symptoms are more prominent than 
deficits in thinking. It’s important to differentiate between the two disorders 
because antidepressant medication is a necessity in treating severe depres-
sion, but the use of antipsychotic medication is needed to treat schizophre-
nia. Less commonly, individuals with either depression or schizophrenia may 
require both types of medication (see Chapter 8).
Substance use and abuse
The widespread use of so-called street drugs (illegal drugs) can give rise to 
symptoms and signs that are similar to those seen in schizophrenia. Because 
drug experimentation frequently begins in someone’s late teens or early 20s, 
also the peak time when the symptoms of schizophrenia appear, one can be 
mistaken for the other — at least initially.
Use of stimulant drugs, such as amphetamine or methamphetamine (also 
known as crystal meth), over a period of time frequently causes extreme 
paranoid feelings and behaviors. As a result, individuals on these drugs often 
are brought to a hospital emergency room by law enforcement authorities. 
Usually, keeping them safe, providing supportive care, and sometimes 
administering sedative medications relieves the acute paranoid symptoms 
in hours, and what looked like schizophrenia is diagnosed instead as drug 
intoxication and acute amphetamine psychosis. Testing for drugs in the 
person’s blood or urine helps confirm the diagnosis.
A class of drugs known as hallucinogens — that prominently includes 
marijuana, LSD, and PCP (also known as angel dust) — gives rise to visual 
distortions and illusions, a sense of loss of control, and, sometimes, disorien-
tation. This can lead to extreme fear, or what is commonly referred to as a 

63
 Chapter 4: Getting a Diagnosis
“bad trip.” Although this may initially be mistaken for schizophrenia, the 
symptoms are usually short-lived and soon recognized as a drug-induced 
phenomenon. However, in some individuals, what starts as a drug-induced 
bad trip gives way to continued hallucinations, delusions, and inappropriate 
mood and winds up continuing and being diagnosed as schizophrenia. 
Scientists still aren’t sure about how or why this occurs.
 
Use of street drugs or alcohol in individuals known to have schizophrenia 
frequently leads to an exacerbation or worsening of the symptoms. 
Chapter 6 provides more information about co-occurring mental-health and 
substance-use disorders.
Personality disorders closely 
linked to schizophrenia
There is another totally separate category of disorders in DSM-IV known as 
personality disorders. Ten specific personality disorder diagnoses are outlined 
in the manual, but only three of them are closely related to the symptoms of 
schizophrenia:
 
 Paranoid personality disorder: The personality of someone with 
this disorder is characterized by a persistent pattern of distrust and 
suspiciousness with thoughts that other people’s motivations are 
directed against him.
 
 Schizoid personality disorder: A person with this disorder is distant or 
detached from ordinary social relationships, and shows very little emo-
tional expression or responsiveness compared to what you would 
expect in a given situation.
 
 Schizotypal personality disorder: A person with this disorder is 
uncomfortable with close relationships and has thinking and perceptual 
difficulties, along with what is seen as eccentric behavior.
One other DSM-IV personality disorder that may be considered during a 
workup for schizophrenia is borderline personality disorder (BPD), which is 
characterized by intense instability of relationships, mood, self-image, and 
self-esteem and is marked by impulsivity. The impulsivity is often character-
ized by extreme risk-taking behavior, self-mutilating behavior, recurrent 
suicidal behaviors, and wide swings in loving or hating individuals with 
whom the individual is involved. The hatred can be so intense at times that it 
can be considered paranoid.
Such intense and impulsive feelings and actions can cause clinicians to con-
sider a diagnosis of schizophrenia, but the absence of persistent organized 
delusions and hallucinations and the absence of consistent depressed or 
manic mood differentiates this personality disorder from schizophrenia and 
bipolar disorder (see “Bipolar disorder,” earlier in this chapter).

64
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
 
Some clinicians feel BPD fits more closely with the “schizophrenia and other 
psychotic disorders” and “mood disorders” categories rather than with 
“personality disorders.”
Personality disorders often begin in early adulthood and remain stable and 
persistent over the years; they don’t wax and wane. People with personality 
disorders behave in ways that don’t fit society’s norms, which can lead to 
their being very distressed and/or somewhat impaired; they don’t, however, 
suffer the profound disability and loss of function seen in people with 
schizophrenia.
People recognize that the individual is somewhat eccentric, but they don’t 
characterize the individual as out of control or out of contact with reality 
(having hallucinations and delusions).
 
In general, the presence of clear-cut psychotic symptoms (delusions and 
hallucinations) is what distinguishes schizophrenia from these personality 
disorders.
Receiving the Diagnosis of Schizophrenia
Few diagnoses are as initially frightening as schizophrenia. Your fears are 
understandable; you may remember hearing about people years ago with 
schizophrenia who were placed in custodial care and never seen or talked 
about again, or you may recall sensational news stories of people with homi-
cidal tendencies or multiple personalities. Many people today don’t realize 
that these news reports are generally overblown and that schizophrenia is a 
treatable illness. Moreover, the disorder often goes into remission, and its 
symptoms can often be controlled by medication.
If your child is diagnosed with schizophrenia, you may blame yourself and 
wonder what you did wrong. Was it your genetics, your parenting, or both? 
Along with guilt, you may feel angry, ashamed, or terrified about the future. 
You wonder whether your son or daughter will ever be able to work, marry, 
or have children.
Some families compare being diagnosed with schizophrenia to being diag-
nosed with a potentially fatal illness, like cancer or heart failure — and in 
many if not most cases, the diagnosis is more difficult to deal with, because 
society is less accepting and sympathetic toward mental disorders than 
physical conditions. Many times, families have told us they were in shock in 
the doctor’s office and came home and cried.
Doctors don’t always deliver the diagnosis of schizophrenia well or easily. 
They may be slow to put a name to it, waiting to be more certain before 
delivering what they consider “bad news” — many disorders (such as 

65
 Chapter 4: Getting a Diagnosis
bipolar disorder, personality disorders, substance abuse, depressions, or 
schizoaffective disorder) look alike when they’re assessed within the 
confines of an appointment that often only lasts 50 minutes. Other times, 
patients don’t fully reveal their symptoms to their doctor and appear to be 
far more organized and lucid than they normally are outside his office.
Families can be guilty of contributing to confusion of diagnosis. They may 
ignore, overlook, or minimize symptoms that are right before their eyes. This 
can result in long delays before diagnosis. Many patients and families are 
afraid of hospitalization, having to take medication for the rest of their lives, 
or being labeled with a stigmatizing illness, so they actively avoid seeking 
professional help.
 
Ignoring or minimizing these symptoms will not help them go away. All you’re 
doing is prolonging the time before your loved one gets the help she needs.
 
Trust your instincts. Even if pediatricians, teachers, or internists tell you 
that your adolescent or young adult will grow out of the problem, if you feel 
something is very wrong, be sure to see a specialist to get a diagnosis. The 
earlier you identify and intervene in schizophrenia, the better the chances of 
reducing impairment and disability.
People react to an initial diagnosis of schizophrenia in a range of different 
ways. The following sections describe the difficulties people typically 
encounter in moving past denial to a state of acceptance.
Accepting the diagnosis
Because of the myths and misunderstandings associated with mental ill-
nesses, in general, and schizophrenia in particular (see Chapter 1) — as well 
as the uncertain course that schizophrenia may take — an initial diagnosis is 
often met with fear, denial, disappointment, and guilt. This occurs almost uni-
versally even though the individual or his family may have been aware that 
“something was very wrong” for some time. Acceptance is a process that 
doesn’t take place overnight.
Attaching a name to an illness is one of the first steps that enables people to 
move forward, to learn more about the disorder, to seek help, and to find 
support from other patients and families (see Chapter 17). A diagnosis gives 
them a shorthand way to talk about the disorder and communicate with 
mental health professionals who are in a position to help.
In the best of circumstances, acceptance allows a patient and his family to 
learn everything they possibly can about schizophrenia; find the very best 
experts to help them; and surround themselves with people who care, 
understand, and accept them.

66
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
 
Because of their extensive experience in dealing with large numbers of people, 
the clergy, particularly those members trained in pastoral counseling, can 
play an important role as natural supports to help families come to grips with 
the diagnosis. Clergy can also help you find understanding professionals in the 
community and provide support for the person with schizophrenia.
Denying the diagnosis
Although acceptance is the best way to move forward in any difficult situa-
tion, denial can be a formidable roadblock. Initial denial is a typical reaction 
to any life-changing event. When denial becomes a permanent coping mecha-
nism for dealing with a chronic illness such as schizophrenia, however, 
crucial time can be lost before treatment begins.
Some patients and families are in such denial that they go doctor shopping to 
get a more palatable diagnosis. One family we know went to four different 
doctors and wound up with four different diagnoses; this gave them the 
ammunition they needed to rationalize that doctors don’t know anything 
anyway. (In reality, each of the doctors observed similar symptoms and signs 
in the patient, but in different proportions, at different points in time — and 
each of them suggested similar classes of medications.)
We’ve also met families who were so upset by a diagnosis of schizophrenia 
that they begged the doctor to change it. In this situation, many doctors 
comply and change the diagnosis to one that is more socially acceptable 
(such as depression or bipolar disorder). This strategy can backfire, under-
mining treatment and the patient’s own acceptance of and/or understanding 
of her illness.
 
A diagnosis doesn’t change who your loved one is. Just as a person who is 
diagnosed with cancer is not solely defined as a cancer patient, a person 
diagnosed with schizophrenia is more than her diagnosis. It’s sometimes easy 
to forget this when you’re in the throes of a crisis.
 
From time to time, schizophrenia is misdiagnosed. This is more likely when 
a doctor has limited understanding of and experience with serious mental 
disorders — for example, someone who tends to see the worried well (people 
who are high functioning but with relatively minor problems) or when a 
patient is seen during a first break (the first time a person is psychotic and 
out-of-contact with reality) and there’s little history to rely upon.
Others times, lack of acceptance is manifest by patients’ and families’ refusal 
to accept evidence-based treatments (treatments that have a scientific basis). 
Instead, they search for unproven treatments, thinking that changes in diet 
or the addition of vitamin supplements can restore mental equilibrium, while 
symptoms persist. This can delay treatment and, in some cases, it may even 
increase losses and worsen the course of the disease.

67
 Chapter 4: Getting a Diagnosis
Lack of insight on the part of the patient can also be a formidable barrier to 
treatment. For more information on denial, turn to Chapter 6.
Predicting the Course of the Illness
When an individual is first diagnosed with schizophrenia (sometimes referred 
to as the first break), it’s natural to wonder if it will go away or last forever, 
and whether the symptoms will become more severe or dissipate over time. 
Unfortunately, for any particular individual, there are no definitive answers.
The most common course and outcome for people with schizophrenia is 
that it’s variable, with exacerbations (worsening of symptoms) and remissions 
(periods of relative wellness with minimal symptoms). Some individuals 
only have a single psychotic break (sometimes called a nervous breakdown) 
and then never have another clear episode. Other people continue to have 
symptoms, which may either remain stable or deteriorate over time.
Although doctors can’t accurately predict the extent to which your loved one 
will improve, stay the same, or get worse, they can make generalizations 
about the progression of the disorder.
 
Keep in mind, though, that these are generalizations, and may not apply in 
your situation. In addition, even individuals with the most severe variants 
of the illness can live productive lives with the help of medication and other 
supports.
Factors that predict a better course
Certain people are more likely to have only a single episode, or to remain 
stable for long periods of time. Some factors that tend to predict a better 
course and outcome include the following:
 
 Female gender
 
 Presence of a precipitating event (for example, a stressor, such as the 
death of a parent, which precipitated the break)
 
 Predominance of mood symptoms (for example, depression) over 
psychotic symptoms
 
 Insight into and understanding of the illness
 
 Good adherence to medication
 
 No prior family history of schizophrenia

68
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
Predictors of poorer outcomes
Although everyone hopes for improvement or at least stabilization, the 
symptoms of some individuals don’t improve or may even worsen over time. 
The following factors can point toward a more severe course and outcome:
 
 Individuals with an earlier age of onset
 
 Poorer adjustment prior to diagnosis
 
 Lower educational achievement
 
 More negative and cognitive impairments
Seeking a Second Opinion
If you have any nagging concerns about diagnosis or treatment, don’t 
hesitate to get a second opinion. Many people feel embarrassed about seek-
ing another opinion because they’re worried that they’ll offend their current 
doctor. If you’re of that mindset, change your way of thinking — because 
doctors are changing theirs. Most doctors aren’t insulted when a patient with 
a complex problem wants to seek a second opinion. In fact, many doctors 
welcome another professional’s perspective — two heads are better than 
one! — and choosing healthcare providers who encourage you to seek out 
additional information, including information from other doctors, is wise.
When to get a second opinion
Not every situation calls for a second opinion — when diagnoses and 
treatment choices are relatively straightforward, a second opinion usually 
isn’t necessary. Second opinions add expense to your medical bills and 
can be time-consuming. However, they’re clearly in order under certain 
circumstances:
 
 If the diagnosis or course of treatment is unclear or ambiguous
 
 If the patient wants to take advantage of experimental or additional 
treatment options that are only available elsewhere
 
 If a patient or her family has doubts or concerns about a doctor, or 
questions about the illness or its treatment that the doctor hasn’t 
answered satisfactorily
 
 If a patient shows no signs of improvement
 
 If a patient or his family simply thinks it may be useful for someone else 
to take a look at the case with fresh eyes

69
 Chapter 4: Getting a Diagnosis
Even if the second opinion doesn’t shed new light on an old problem, it may 
help buy peace of mind.
How to find a second opinion
There are a number of options for finding a psychiatrist for a consultation:
 
 Ask your own psychiatrist or internist for a reference.
 
 Check with your local hospital or an academic medical center to find 
someone with the expertise you require.
 
 Check lists of “best doctors” in regional magazines.
 
 Seek the names of good physicians from family and friends, or from 
people who have had a similar illness.
 
 Check with your local NAMI affiliate to see if it maintains a list of 
practitioners (To find your local affiliate, go to www.nami.org/
Template.cfm?section=your_local_NAMI — or go to www.
nami.org and, under the “Find Support” section click on “State & 
Local NAMIs.”) or contact one of the other organizations listed in 
the appendix.
Going for a second opinion
When you decide to go for a second opinion, be sure to tell your current 
doctor that you’re doing so. Your current doctor probably will need to 
provide the second doctor with information. Here’s how to do this:
 
 Respectfully explain your rationale for getting a second opinion, without 
directly challenging your current doctor.
 
 Explain that you’ll be asking the other doctor to speak with him, to 
solicit his opinion, and see if they can come up with any alternative 
diagnoses or treatments, as the case may be.
 
 Leave the door open to returning because, in all likelihood, that’s 
probably what you’ll want to do.
 
Depending on the type of insurance you have, some insurers reimburse the 
cost of a second opinion, but it’s always a good idea to check in advance with 
your insurance provider.
If you’re uncertain about your relationship with your doctor, her reaction to 
your seeking a second opinion may actually help you decide whether to stay 
or leave. Client-centered, confident doctors don’t resent second opinions, 
and may even suggest it to you.

f you’ve ever had to find a doctor in an emergency, you may have experi-
enced the unsettling feeling of having to pick a name out of that proverbial 
hat, with no other options. Although this situation may be unavoidable under 
certain circumstances, for a chronic medical condition like schizophrenia, 
you need to — and will have the time to — carefully assemble a well-versed, 
experienced team of professionals who know you and your loved one well 
(and vice versa). Odds are, you’re going to be spending a lot of time with 
these people over the years, so you need to be comfortable with each other.
In this chapter, we help you find the professional help your loved one needs. 
We tell you what kind of mental-health professionals are involved with treat-
ing schizophrenia, how to check out credentials, and how to ensure that 
your team will work well together. We also help you through the trying times 
when the team isn’t working out — how to approach the problem and how to 
improve a stressful situation.
Putting Together a Healthcare Team
Just as a baseball team needs a skilled pitcher, catcher, batters, and various 
other team members in the right positions — as well as a skilled manager to 
pull them all together — you and your loved one need a variety of profession-
als to help you handle different aspects of your journey.

72
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
Finding the right group of mental-health professionals to help you and your 
loved one can be a lot of work, and can be a draining experience involving 
phone calls, research, and sometimes money spent to interview different 
people. So why should you make the effort to assemble a team of profes-
sionals? Being able to choose people you and your loved one like and under-
stand — and who like and understand the two of you — is important because 
any type of mental-health treatment requires close collaboration between a 
patient, a therapist, and, to some extent, the family. Things go much more 
smoothly when you’re working with a group of people you trust and respect.
Many people feel that even seeing a mental-health professional is an admis-
sion of weakness. The terms shrink (derived from head-shrinker) and head 
doctor are widely used disparaging terms applied to psychiatrists, psycholo-
gists, and social workers by the media and the public. Some people fear that 
these professionals can read and control their minds — which is far from the 
truth! (Honestly, most healthcare professionals would be delighted if Mind 
Reading 101 could actually be added to their medical-school classes.)
 
Mental-health professionals are ordinary people who are trained to under-
stand the mind and behavior — and to use that knowledge to improve mental 
health or diagnose and treat mental disorders. Any healthcare professional 
who comes across as knowing all the answers — or as someone who’s 
condescending — is a person to delete from your healthcare team roster 
permanently.
In the next sections, we describe the different types of mental-health profes-
sionals, starting with the person who’ll be your team manager — your 
psychiatrist.
Your First Priority: Finding and 
Interviewing a Good Psychiatrist
Finding the right psychiatrist is essential to the management of schizophre-
nia. Not only is your psychiatrist the coordinator of all your team members; 
he’s also the person who makes most of the medical decisions relating to 
treatments and medications. You want someone you feel comfortable with, 
whose judgment you trust, and whose reputation in the medical community 
is stellar. Where do you find such a paragon? Not to worry — many wonder-
ful psychiatrists are practicing today. This section is all about finding the 
right one for your loved one and you.

73
 Chapter 5: Assembling a Healthcare Team
Who’s on first?
You probably already know the answer to this question — your psychiatrist 
is. She’s your first line of defense against schizophrenia, and part of the 
reason is because she knows and prescribes the drugs used to control the 
most troubling symptoms of the disorder. Research shows that medication 
is the single most essential element of treatment for schizophrenia and that 
identifying the right medications for your loved one is vital to recovery. For 
this reason, your first priority should be finding the right psychiatrist.
 
Be sure to invest as much time as necessary to identify an expert who’s knowl-
edgeable about psychopharmacology (the medications used to treat mental 
disorders) and about your loved one’s disorder (schizophrenia).
Psychiatrists are physicians whose training enables them to diagnose and 
treat mental disorders. After medical school, they complete an additional 
four years of residency in psychiatry and some take written and oral exami-
nations to become board-certified. Some go on for additional specialty 
training in fields such as geriatric psychiatry (specializing in the care of 
older persons) or child and adolescent psychiatry (specializing in the care of 
younger ones).
The large majority of them have an MD (Doctor of Medicine) degree 
after their name, although some psychiatrists are trained as osteopathic 
physicians and have a DO after their name (for Doctor of Osteopathy). 
Psychiatrists who are Doctors of Osteopathy have also completed psychiat-
ric residencies.
There are many excellent mental-health practitioners, but psychiatrists have 
the medical training to understand the complex relationships between the 
mind and body — and are best trained to rule out or make sure that there 
is no underlying medical basis for the psychological symptoms a person is 
experiencing. The amount of training a psychiatrist has in conducting various 
types of psychological therapies (for example, psychotherapy or cognitive 
behavioral therapy; see Chapter 9) varies based on where and how he was 
trained.
 
In most states, only a physician can involuntarily hospitalize an individual, 
although he need not be trained as a psychiatrist (see Chapter 6).

74
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
Looking for a specialist in 
serious mental illness
A psychiatrist is a psychiatrist is a psychiatrist? Not at all. Because only 
about 1 out of 20 individuals diagnosed with a mental disorder is likely to 
have what is considered a “serious mental illness” like schizophrenia, it 
makes sense that the majority of psychiatrists maintain practices that are 
geared toward patients with less severe mental-health problems. For exam-
ple, many psychiatrists focus on treating people with less severe symptoms 
of depression and anxiety, or on counseling couples with marital problems.
 
You want to make sure that the doctor you select is experienced and comfort-
able working with individuals with schizophrenia. You also want to find out 
about the doctor’s educational background and training, whether he’s certi-
fied by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (meaning, he has 
passed a national examination), and whether he sees a large number of people 
with serious mental disorders in his practice.
 
You wouldn’t want to choose a surgeon for an operation that rarely does the 
procedure you need to undergo, and the same logic applies to choosing clini-
cians for treatment of a complex disorder like schizophrenia.
Starting your search
Whether you’re looking for an auto mechanic or a baby sitter, the best way 
to find a reputable referral is usually through word of mouth. The same thing 
can be said about finding a psychiatrist or any other mental-health profes-
sional. Although there are places where you can find names and directories 
of individuals, vetting a clinician by checking him out with other families, 
trusted friends, or relatives who’ve used him and were satisfied is always 
prudent.
Compiling a short list
The vast majority of psychiatrists practice in larger cities; if you live in a 
small city or town, you may have to travel to a larger city or an academic 
medical center. Either way, you want to first compile a list of possibilities. 
Here are some suggestions for doing that:
 
 If you’re being referred for help by a physician or another mental-
health professional (for example, a psychiatrist you met in an emer-
gency room), ask the doctor to provide you with the names of several 
psychiatrists she would recommend.
 
 Speak to your primary-care doctor, internist, family doctor, pediatri-
cian, or gynecologist, and see if one of them can recommend one or 
more psychiatrists for you to consider.

75
 Chapter 5: Assembling a Healthcare Team
 
 Check with your local or state medical or psychiatric societies (which 
are usually listed in a phone book or on the Internet) and ask them for 
names of doctors who are convenient to your home. For a complete list 
of district branches of the American Psychiatric Association (a profes-
sional specialty organization of psychiatrists), go to http://online-
apa.psych.org/listing/.
 
 If you have health insurance that covers mental-health and substance-
abuse (sometimes called behavioral health) treatment, find out the 
names of doctors who participate with your private insurance plan or 
accept Medicaid or Medicare.
 
 Contact public mental health clinics or other outpatient programs in 
your community. Many of them may function under the umbrella of the 
state mental-health authority or county/city mental-health department 
(also listed in the phone book or on the Internet).
 
 Contact your state mental-health authority or state department of edu-
cation to find out the names of licensed practitioners in your area.
A number of sites on the Internet provide different types of information 
on doctors. For example, the American Medical Association (AMA) has a 
DoctorFinder service (http://webapps.ama-assn.org/doctorfinder/
home.html), which allows you to search for a doctor by name and location 
or by specialty and zip code. Unfortunately, this site, like most others, has 
its limitations: It only includes doctors who are members of the AMA, and 
the information provided is too limited to use in selecting a psychiatrist. (For 
example, it may say that the doctor has an office-based practice, without pro-
viding information about the types of patients she sees or her knowledge of 
psychiatric medications).
An increasing number of Web sites — including HealthGrades (www.health
grades.com) and Revolution Health (www.revolutionhealth.com), 
among others — also offer directories of psychiatrists and other physicians, 
some free and some at cost. But these sites only enable you to build a list of 
possibilities — they don’t provide specific advice on how to narrow your list 
to make an informed choice. See the appendix for other suggestions on find-
ing mental-health providers on the Web.
 
Google Maps (http://maps.google.com) can be useful for pinpointing the 
location of various mental-health professionals after you have their names 
(and may even help you with directions for getting to your first appointment).
Making a selection
After you’ve compiled a short list, your best bet is always to go with a psy-
chiatrist who comes recommended as knowledgeable and trustworthy by 
someone you trust and who has your interests in mind. Check with trusted 

76
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
friends or relatives to see if they can suggest names and are willing to tell you 
about their own experiences.
Call the office of a local affiliate of the National Alliance on Mental Illness 
(NAMI), and ask to speak with consumers or family members who have 
experience with psychiatrists in your community and who can share their 
opinions with you. They can help you figure out who’s good, better, and best 
where you live on the basis of their own experiences. (To find your local 
NAMI affiliate, go to www.nami.org/Template.cfm?section=your_
local_NAMI — or go to www.nami.org and, under the “Find Support” sec-
tion click on “State & Local NAMIs.”)
 
Having preferences concerning age, gender, religion, race, or language is per-
fectly acceptable, if that makes you or your loved one feel more comfortable. 
However, because experienced psychiatrists are in short supply, you may 
have to set priorities about what characteristics are most important to you 
and your loved one.
 
A picture is worth a thousand words: If you can’t find an online bio for the 
person, sometimes you can be your own investigator and use Google Images 
(http://images.google.com) to find the person’s picture. Just looking 
at the doctor’s photo may give you a sense of gender, age, or other consider-
ations that are important to you but that you might be reluctant to ask about.
If you or your loved one has special needs, you’ll want to find someone with 
the appropriate specialty. For example, if you’re seeking care for an elderly 
parent, you may want to look for a geriatric psychiatrist. If your teenage son 
is abusing drugs and has signs of a mental disorder, you may want to look 
for a psychiatrist who has a specialty in addiction psychiatry or experience 
treating people who have both mental health disorders and substance abuse 
problems.
Preparing for the first meeting: 
Questions to ask
We always tell families that, whenever possible, they should either speak to 
a psychiatrist before their loved one does or meet with the psychiatrist in 
person to make sure that he’s the type of person your loved one is likely to 
feel comfortable with. This advice is particularly relevant with children and 
adolescents — you don’t want to expose your child to someone you don’t 
respect and trust.

77
 Chapter 5: Assembling a Healthcare Team
After you talk to or meet with the psychiatrist, your loved one may want to 
have a no-obligation, first-time meeting with the psychiatrist to make sure 
that she feels comfortable with the individual’s style and approach.
 
We can’t overstate the importance of doing everything you can to enhance the 
odds of making the first visit work. Many families tell us about loved ones who 
had bad initial experiences that turned them off from getting help for a long 
time afterward. Finding someone who is respectful to your loved one as well 
as to family and friends is essential.
 
If a person’s first experience with a psychiatrist is negative, it can turn him off 
from treatment, a situation that can be very hard to undo. You want to avoid 
this scenario, if at all possible.
The following is a list of questions that your loved one (depending on her 
condition) or you can ask to find out more about the doctor:
 
 What are your hours for seeing patients? If you’re working, it may be 
difficult for you to take your loved one to see a psychiatrist who only 
sees patients during the day. Try to find someone whose hours work 
with your schedule.
 
 What are your fees and what kind of insurance do you accept? If she 
doesn’t accept insurance, ask whether she has a sliding fee based on 
income.
 
 Where is your office located? Some doctors practice in multiple loca-
tions and one may be more convenient than another. (The importance 
of having a place to park if you drive or being close to a bus route if you 
don’t shouldn’t be overlooked.)
 
 What’s your philosophy and approach toward treatment? Is he a bio-
logical, psychosocial, psychoanalytic (see Chapter 2), or biopsychosocial 
(someone who combines biological, psychosocial, and social concerns) 
psychiatrist?
 
 Ideally, it would be nice to find someone who can both prescribe medi-
cation and provide supportive therapy. Often, a doctor will only do 
medication management, and you will need to see another individual for 
therapy. This is perfectly acceptable if the care is coordinated.
 
 Psychoanalysis is generally not the treatment of choice for people with 
serious mental disorders like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. If some-
one recommends psychoanalysis for the treatment of schizophrenia, 
leave the office as quickly (but politely) as you can.
 
 What types of patients are you most comfortable working with? Some 
psychiatrists specialize in certain disorders (for example, schizophrenia, 
mood disorders, anxiety, marital problems, and so on) or in working 

78
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
with special groups (such as older people, children, or adolescents). 
Ideally, you want your loved one to have a psychiatrist who specializes 
in people like him! The fit doesn’t need to be perfect, but if someone 
rarely sees people with schizophrenia, the psychiatrist probably has 
less experience in using antipyschotic medications.
 
 How long will it be before I can schedule an appointment with you? 
Many good psychiatrists balance clinical responsibilities with teaching 
or other commitments so they have tight schedules. But most doctors 
have the flexibility in their schedules to see people within a day or two 
if it’s an emergency. (This may be more difficult in the case of a new 
patient.) If the wait is too long for you, you might ask the doctor to rec-
ommend another psychiatrist who can see you sooner.
 
 What arrangements do you have in place to handle overnight or week-
end emergencies? There should always be someone on call in the event 
of an after-hours emergency (either a covering doctor or an answering 
service that can reach the doctor).
 
Unless you’re in an emergency situation, invest your time upfront to avoid dis-
appointments. Of course, if your loved one needs to see someone right away, 
you’ll need to streamline the process for the time being.
 
You can always change doctors when you have more time to do so. Your need 
may be so urgent that an emergency-room doctor is your only recourse in the 
short run, but after the crisis is over, you can evaluate whether you want to 
make that relationship permanent or look elsewhere.
Meeting a psychiatrist: What to expect
At this first meeting, the psychiatrist is likely to speak to your loved one 
alone at first and then probably will ask to speak to both of you together 
(either at this meeting or a subsequent one). The doctor will be trying to 
learn about her (see Chapter 2) and may ask you to provide additional 
information. It may take one, two, or perhaps a few meetings for the doctor 
to have enough information to decide on a working diagnosis and on an 
approach to treatment. With your loved one’s permission, the psychiatrist 
may want to gather records from other physicians or mental-health 
professionals.
When this evaluation is completed, the doctor will share his ideas about 
diagnosis and treatment. The doctor will play an ongoing role in monitoring 
your loved one’s medication and in determining if she ever needs hospitaliza-
tion or an alternative to hospitalization. If your loved one is very psychotic 

79
 Chapter 5: Assembling a Healthcare Team
(out-of-contact with reality), you may need to be more involved in treatment 
decisions.
Some of the questions your loved one needs to ask if they still remain unan-
swered include:
 
 How often do you expect to be seeing me?
 
 How long will each session last?
 
 Will you be prescribing medication for me and supervising it? Will you 
be providing supportive therapy as well?
 
 What are the potential benefits, risks, and side effects of any therapies 
you’re prescribing for me?
 
 What other mental-health professionals do you think need to be on my 
team? How will you communicate with each other?
 
 Will my confidentiality be protected? (See Chapter 6 for more information.)
 
 Do you need me to sign releases for any other additional information 
that would assist you in my treatment?
 
 What role do you expect my family to play in my treatment? How can 
they communicate with you?
 
 How would you handle my care if I had a psychotic break? Are you affili-
ated with a particular hospital?
If things seem to be going well up to this point, your loved one should be able 
to make a commitment to treatment.
 
It takes time to get to know someone, and many people are uncomfortable 
during the first few months of treatment. But if your loved one continues to 
feel extremely uncomfortable with the psychiatrist, it may be appropriate to 
try someone else on your list to see what another clinician would be like. If 
you live in a small town, your options may be limited unless you’re willing to 
travel, which may not be practical.
 
If no one seems to please you or your loved one, you both need to seriously 
consider the possibility that you’re actively avoiding getting help.
Identifying Other Members of the Team
You can use the same method to find other professionals you’ll need on your 
team as you used to find a psychiatrist (see the preceding sections). The bad 

80
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
news: The process is just as tedious, except that your psychiatrist may be 
another person who can now help you with referrals.
 
If you or your relative participates in a program like an outpatient psycho-
social rehabilitation program or a clubhouse (see Chapter 9 for more about 
these programs), the composition of your team (both in terms of individuals 
and their specialties) may be dictated by the staffing of the program.
An array of other mental-health professionals can play different roles in your 
care. We introduce you to them in the following sections.
Psychologists
Although psychiatrists and psychologists (with doctoral degrees) are both 
called “doctors,” psychologists have graduate training in psychology that 
leads either to a PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) or PsyD (Doctor of Psychology). 
Some psychologists only have master’s-level training.
After graduate school, depending on the state where you live, most psycholo-
gists complete a one- or two-year internship before they can get a license 
from the state. An essential distinction between psychiatrists and psycholo-
gists is that, in most states (except Louisiana and New Mexico), only psy-
chiatrists are able to prescribe medications. Often psychologists practice 
collaboratively with psychiatrists, who supervise medications, while the psy-
chologist provides psychotherapy.
The title psychologist can only be used by an individual who has completed 
this education, training, and state licensure. Informal titles such as counselor 
or therapist or psychotherapist are often used as well, but other mental-health 
professionals with far less training also use these same titles.
Psychologists often provide psychotherapy to individuals or groups. Many 
have particular specialties (for example, working with special populations 
like children, adolescents, or victims of abuse) or using particular methods 
(such as psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, or supportive therapy; see 
Chapter 9).
 
Most states have no special educational or training requirements to call your-
self a therapist or psychotherapist. Anyone with a PhD (doctoral degree) in 
English literature or political science can call himself a “doctor.” Some people 
hang out a shingle or advertise in the local newspaper without any specialized 
training. It’s essential to ask and check into a professional’s background if you 
aren’t sure of her training or licensure.

81
 Chapter 5: Assembling a Healthcare Team
Social workers
Social workers, also called clinical social workers, either have MSW (Master 
of Social Work) or DSW (Doctor of Social Work) degrees. After their training, 
many sit for a licensing test and become accredited by their respective states 
as LCSWs or ACSWs.
Like other mental-health professionals, social workers can work in private 
practice or as part of a mental-health facility, such as a hospital, clinic, or 
rehabilitation program. They can’t prescribe medications, but if they have 
experience working with people with mental illness, they often help oversee 
the use of medications, working closely with a psychiatrist.
Many clinical social workers are trained to serve as advocates for patients 
and their families. They can assist with referrals, help you obtain benefits 
and entitlements, and help you navigate the mental-health system. They also 
can provide support and help educate families and consumers. In fact, many 
case managers (see “Coordinating Treatment and Care,” later in this chapter) 
are trained as or are supervised by social workers.
 
The National Association of Social Workers (NASW) has an online directory of 
social workers at www.helpstartshere.org.
Psychiatric nurses
Generally, a psychiatric nurse is an RN with a bachelor’s, master’s, or doc-
toral degree who has specialized experience and training in working with 
people with mental-health problems. Psychiatric nurses also may work with 
individuals or groups in private practice, clinic, or hospital settings.
Because of their nursing background, psychiatric nurses are often attentive 
to many of the health problems experienced by people with serious mental 
disorders (see Chapter 15) and are alert to the side effects of psychiatric 
medications. Some nurse practitioners (RNs who are licensed to practice med-
icine in collaboration with a physician), depending on the state where they 
practice, are allowed to prescribe medications.
Some additional members of the team
A number of other professionals, including occupational therapists, voca-
tional therapists, recreation therapists, rehabilitation specialists, and peer 

82
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
counselors are called upon to work with people with schizophrenia who have 
broad needs that transcend treatment alone — which is usually the case. 
Some of these professionals may be part of your loved one’s treatment for 
only a short time; others may work with them longer.
Licensed professional counselors
Counselors can either have a master’s degree in counseling, pastoral counsel-
ing, or psychology — or a PhD in counseling psychology. They can provide 
diagnosis and counseling to individuals or groups and work under a profes-
sional license obtained from their respective state. They may also be certi-
fied by the National Academy of Certified Clinical Mental Health Counselors. 
You need to ask.
Although most counselors tend to focus on people with less serious prob-
lems, many are experienced in working with people with serious mental dis-
orders like schizophrenia.
Marriage and family therapists
Marriage and family therapists (MFTs) bring a family-oriented perspective to 
care. They’re graduates of master’s or doctoral programs or study MFT after 
earning another mental-health-related graduate degree. Currently 46 states 
license or certify MFTs.
MFTs work with couples and families and can be helpful in providing consul-
tation, education, and support to families.
Occupational therapists
Depending on the age of onset of their illness, some people with schizo-
phrenia never learned to manage the activities of daily living or, after a long 
period of illness, lost the skills they once had. The goal of occupational ther-
apy, performed by individuals with OT degrees, is to help restore the skills a 
person needs to socialize and function appropriately at home, at school, or in 
work settings.
Vocational therapists
So many people define themselves by what they do. Nothing feels worse 
than seeing yourself — or being seen — only as a patient; no one wants 
his primary identification to be that of a person with mental illness or with 
schizophrenia. Vocational rehabilitation (VR) is a set of services offered by 
vocational therapists to people with disabilities — mental or physical — to 
help them secure and maintain meaningful employment.

83
 Chapter 5: Assembling a Healthcare Team
VR is a state program that is often free to people who meet the established 
criteria of need. Generally, clients have a long-term disability that is a bar-
rier to employment and that can be overcome with the help of a vocational 
therapy or rehabilitation. (See Chapter 7 for more on VR.)
Vocational therapists also work privately, paid for by insurers. If you’re able 
to choose a vocational therapist, you want to look for someone who’s ori-
ented toward the needs of the individual, who builds upon natural supports 
like peers and family, and who’s oriented toward real work as opposed to 
make-work (repetitive tasks that are boring and offer little opportunity to 
enhance self-worth).
One specialized type of vocational therapist is a job coach, an individual 
who works side by side with a disabled person to help that person acclimate 
to the workplace and the tasks that a particular job entails. Job developers 
work with programs to identify real work opportunities in the community for 
people with schizophrenia.
Recreation therapists
Recreation therapists are trained, certified, and registered and/or licensed to 
develop recreation resources and opportunities (also referred to as therapeu-
tic recreation) for people with illnesses or disabilities. The goal is to restore, 
remediate, and rehabilitate the patient’s functioning. As part of the team, a 
recreation therapist designs individualized interventions that will contribute 
to the health and overall well-being of the person with schizophrenia, and 
that will help her cope with such common symptoms as boredom, depres-
sion, and anxiety.
The recreation therapist prescribes activities to meet people’s specific 
social, emotional, cognitive, and/or physical needs. These activities run the 
gamut and include fitness programs, photography, woodworking, horticul-
ture, stress-management training, computer training, pottery-making, arts 
and crafts, games, relaxation training, working with animals, and more.
Rehabilitation therapists
Rehabilitation therapists include a broad range of mental-health profession-
als who work to assist people with vocational skills, job training, social skills 
training, and money management.
Some rehabilitation therapists (as well as psychologists) specialize in cogni-
tive remediation, a teaching technique that tries to restore an individual’s 
ability to learn and function based on neuropsychological evaluation and 
intervention. (See Chapter 9 for more on cognitive remediation.)

84
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
Peer counselors
People who have experience living with various serious mental illnesses and 
who are in recovery can help by sharing their experience and serving as role 
models. Many municipalities and voluntary organizations have developed 
peer-counseling programs to provide support and inspiration, and many 
states train and/or certify peer counselors. These counselors generally work 
as members of a professional team and are respected for the unique perspec-
tive they bring to treatment and rehabilitation.
Sometimes mental-health peer counselors work in a group setting with 
multiple individuals. This is one type of self-help group (see Chapter 9).
Coordinating Treatment and Care
Most people with schizophrenia require a range of health, mental-health, 
and supportive services (including appropriate housing, decent medical 
care, access to entitlement benefits, and so on). These services need to be 
in place for an individual to live in the community with independence and 
dignity. Unfortunately, the service system is so complex and fragmented — 
and the symptoms of schizophrenia create so many barriers — that people 
with schizophrenia may not always have the ability or insight to recognize, 
access, and use the services they need.
Having one person to coordinate all needed care and services is an ideal 
solution to a disease that can seem to sprout new complications and dragon 
heads at every turn. Case management assigns responsibility to either an 
individual or team to coordinate all these services on behalf of one individual 
so that services are accessible and accountable.
The terms case management and clinical case management are generic ones, 
referring to a variety of different models. Some case managers work individu-
ally; others work as part of interdisciplinary teams. Some case managers 
link clients to services; others provide services directly (usually as a team). 
A case manager may or may not serve as the patient’s primary clinician.
One of the most popular and well-known models of case management is 
the Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) program. The first ACT pro-
gram, called PACT (Program for Assertive Community Treatment) started 
in Madison, Wisconsin, in the late 1960s. At the time, it was referred to as a 
“hospital without walls.”
The defining characteristics of ACT programs include:
 
 Use of multidisciplinary teams (which draw upon several areas of 
medicine and practice) rather than individual case managers
 
 24/7 availability, 365 days a year, with a high frequency of contact

85
 Chapter 5: Assembling a Healthcare Team
 
 Low client-to-staff ratios (10:1 rather than 30:1 or more)
 
 Assertive outreach to meet clients wherever they are in the community 
rather than in a clinic setting
 
 Providing direct services (including emotional support and crisis 
intervention, as necessary) rather than brokering services only
 
 Using peer counselors and family members as outreach workers
 
 Promoting self-management skills, so the client can assume responsibil-
ity for her illness
 
 A practical orientation that includes providing assistance with 
activities of daily living (ADLs) and linking to social-service benefits 
and entitlements
 
Some consumers find the use of the term case management derogatory. 
Rightly so, they preferred to be viewed as individuals rather than “cases.”
The results of empirical studies over more than three decades have 
shown that ACT programs reduce hospitalization, homelessness, and inap-
propriate housing; increase housing stability; control psychiatric symptoms; 
and improve quality of life. Most of the studies took place in urban areas and 
focused on the most severely ill subset of people with schizophrenia.
In fact, the ACT program model has been proven to work so well that it’s 
been implemented in most states, but not in the numbers necessary to serve 
all the people who could benefit from these intensive services. State and 
local programs often establish narrow eligibility criteria to meet the needs 
of those who are most disabled rather than all those who may benefit from 
such services.
Those who qualify for ACT programs generally include people who:
 
 Have a history of multiple hospitalizations
 
 Have been dually diagnosed with co-occurring mental health and 
substance use/abuse problems
 
 Have mental illness and are involved with the criminal justice system
 
 Have severe mental illness and are homeless
 
Because of high demand and limited availability, most case management 
programs do not advertise or look for new clients. You need to contact your 
public mental-health authority at the state or local level to find out how you or 
your loved one can obtain these services. Be persistent — and if that doesn’t 
pan out, contact patient, family, or citizen advocacy organizations in your 
community to learn about these programs (see the appendix).

86
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
Although case-management programs are costly, multiple studies have 
shown that they reduce the utilization of more expensive services such as 
hospitalization, emergency-room use, and incarceration in jails. Equally 
important, the programs improve quality of life for both the person with 
schizophrenia and his family.
Redrafting the Team: When 
Things Aren’t Working
If your team is floundering, you or your loved one are likely to be flounder-
ing, too. Schizophrenia is a complex disease that requires integrated (coordi-
nated) treatment and that takes the input and cooperation of many people.
When families are case managers
One of the unfortunate legacies of deinsti-
tutionalization (see Chapter 15) is that, by 
not providing funding for high-quality, coordi-
nated resources for community care at federal, 
state, or local levels, families of people with 
serious mental illness have become de facto 
case managers of last resort, trying to patch 
together different resources for their family 
members.
Families assume the de facto roles of housing 
and case management providers, performing 
a host of critical functions in support of their 
loved ones, including:
  Monitoring therapeutic and adverse effects 
of medications
  Providing companionship to fill empty 
hours
  Offering housing, money, or other crisis 
assistance to avoid disruption and 
dislocation
  Securing psychiatric hospitalization (when 
necessary)
  Serving as individual advocates for their 
family members (by helping them access 
high-quality mental healthcare)
  Serving as systems advocates, trying to 
improve the overall mental-health system 
to assure availability, access, adequacy, 
and coordination of health, mental-health, 
and social-welfare services
These overwhelming responsibilities leave 
caregivers little time for work, outside inter-
ests, or their own social relationships, and it 
can exacerbate their feelings of loss. This is 
an emotionally exhausting and difficult role for 
any parent, sibling, spouse, or friend to assume. 
Aside from their having to help the patient with 
day-to-day tasks, they have to learn about the 
range of resources available in the community. 
When family members are placed in this role, it 
often adds another layer of complications to the 
already strained dynamics between them and 
their loved ones.
Bottom line: You and your loved one will be 
fortunate if you can find a case manager who 
can assist you.

87
 Chapter 5: Assembling a Healthcare Team
About one-third of cases of schizophrenia are more complex and difficult 
to treat than most. If your loved one has treatment-resistant schizophrenia 
(schizophrenia whose positive symptoms don’t respond to currently 
available medications), it may seem like your team isn’t working well, when 
in reality the seriousness of the disease and the limitations of treatment are 
the problems, not the team members and certainly not the individual.
On the other hand, things may be going badly because you have the wrong 
team members, or because they’re not working together. You’re the one most 
likely to recognize problems, and you’ll probably also be the one who has to 
figure out how to fix them.
 
Treatment resistant is a term used to describe symptoms that do not respond 
to conventional treatments. Sometimes people confuse the term treatment 
resistant and incorrectly use it to describe patients who are not adherent to 
treatment.
Spotting the signs of team dysfunction
How do you know when the problem is with the team rather than with the 
person with schizophrenia? Some of the signs that the team may be adrift 
include the following:
 
 Failure to listen: It’s vital that all members of the team (including 
psychiatrists) be active listeners, so they understand their patients’ 
needs and preferences and respect them as individuals. Cookie-cutter 
approaches to treatment generally don’t work and make patients and 
family members feel dehumanized.
 
 Failure to communicate openly with the patient and/or the family: 
The concept of shared decision-making, a tool now gaining popularity 
in general medicine, encourages patients and doctors to become 
active partners in sharing information, clarifying medical options, and 
choosing or redirecting a course of care. The need for this approach 
is particularly important in the care of patients with schizophrenia 
because of the long-term nature of the disorder, the complexities of 
treatment, the need to prevent learned helplessness (the tendency 
among patients to become passive), the need to encourage compliance, 
and the role of family and friends in supporting the individual. Both 
patients and families have the right to expect periodic meetings with the 
team to discuss and assess progress.
 
 Poor communication between team members: Members of the team 
need to be talking to each other periodically (or at least communicating 
by e-mail). For example, if you realize that the psychologist who meets 
with your loved one every week has neglected to report troublesome 
side effects to the psychiatrist (who is overseeing medication) or that 
your loved one seems to be on a progressively downward spiral and that 
the psychiatrist has no clue, you know there’s a communication problem.

88
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
 
 A team with too many pitch hitters or staff on the bench: Some turn-
over of staff is to be expected, but if a program is constantly losing 
staff members, it’s a sign that something’s amiss. This is particularly 
important for patients with schizophrenia who find it difficult to forge 
new relationships and adapt to change. If the primary clinician changes 
every few months, your family member may receive disjointed or 
fragmented care. If a program seems unstable in terms of its ability to 
recruit and retain staff, you may want to look for other options.
 
 Gaps in treatment or care: For example, if a program provides no 
opportunities for the patient to participate in rehabilitative or vocational 
opportunities, or other vital support services are missing, you need to 
assess why that’s happening and how that gap can be addressed.
 
 Missing the mark on the appropriate level of expectation: The bar 
for expectations shouldn’t be set too high or too low. Ideally, you want 
the team to set realistic and achievable goals. The team has to have 
experience and wisdom to discern whether a patient who appears to be 
lazy is really experiencing negative symptoms associated with the illness 
(see Chapter 3), has low-self-esteem, is depressed, or is simply giving up 
and needs to be encouraged to do more.
Working to improve your team
After you’ve identified a problem, you need to find ways to fix it. If you feel 
that something’s amiss, here are some tips on how to change the team in a 
positive way:
 
 Find the right person to talk to. If the problem is with a private prac-
titioner, call or e-mail him and explain your concerns. You’re paying 
the doctor or other professional directly, so you have some degree of 
leverage. If the problem is with a program, start at the bottom before 
you move up the ladder — for example, if the problem is with a mental 
health counselor, start with that person before going to her boss.
 
 Whenever you or your loved one enrolls in a new program, ask who you 
should speak to in the event of a problem. Many facilities, including 
hospitals, have patient advocates, patient-rights coordinators, or 
ombudsmen.
 
 Choose the best way to communicate. It may be in person, over the 
phone, by letter, or by e-mail, depending on your preferences, the 
preferences of the other person, and the options available to you. If 
you’re meeting in person, always address the person by name, arrive 
on time, keep it simple, speak firmly but audibly, and don’t shout.

89
 Chapter 5: Assembling a Healthcare Team
 
 Put your best foot forward. Even if you’ re angry or hurt on the inside, 
remember that the problem may be a simple misunderstanding. Stay 
calm, never threaten, but remain firm and persistent. Use praise, humor, 
and diplomacy where appropriate, and don’t forget to listen to what the 
other side is saying. You want to be part of the solution, not part of the 
problem.
 
 Many families tell us that simply by saying that they’re members of 
NAMI opens the door so that professionals are willing to listen and meet 
with them. Instead of name-dropping, drop NAMI into the conversation!
 
 Put it in writing. Keep records of your communications. Include the 
date, the person you spoke with, and what you both said. If your request 
was accommodated, follow up with a thank-you note. If it wasn’t, after an 
appropriate wait, follow up with a reminder.
 
 Resort to desperate measures. If you don’t feel like you’re being heard 
or if you feel the needs of your loved one are being ignored, file a report 
with the appropriate oversight agency. You may be able to figure out 
who and where by calling your city, county, or state mental-health 
authority. In most states, the state regulates and licenses all mental-
health programs.
 
 Contact the state agency overseeing protection and advocacy programs 
(see Chapter 7) and communicate with your elected officials to see if 
they can help you. In extreme cases (for example, if there are condi-
tions threatening the health and safety of vulnerable people), the best 
approach may be to contact the media.
 
 The Americans with Disability Act (ADA) ensures that people with 
mental illnesses have legal protections against discrimination in 
workplace, housing, and residential programs (including hospitals). 
For more on the ADA, see Chapter 7.
 
 Don’t sweat the small stuff. Keep in mind that most people who work in 
human services are motivated by the desire to help people rather than 
make money, and that many of them work in difficult settings with only 
limited resources. Try to always give mental-health workers the benefit 
of the doubt and keep things in perspective.
 
 Remember to reward successful efforts. It’s always motivating and 
heart-warming when a mental-health professional receives a note from 
a consumer or family member telling of their successes. Don’t forget to 
tell your team when good things happen; it helps everyone retain their 
enthusiasm for working through the rough spots.

 Never give up. As an important corollary to the preceding bullet, 
remember that, as with Dorothea Dix who reformed mental hospitals 
in the mid-1800s, it only takes one committed person to initiate change. 
If you’re having problems with a clinician or program, you probably 
aren’t the only one, and your efforts may help many people in similar 
circumstances.

lthough getting a diagnosis and being able to attach a name to your 
loved one’s set of perplexing symptoms and behaviors can be a relief, 
it can also lead to a number of new concerns, challenges, and conflicting 
feelings as your loved one begins treatment. Sadly, although treatment is the 
first step toward recovery, as many as two-thirds of those individuals with 
schizophrenia never receive any treatment at all.
In this chapter, we examine the issues that arise as a person begins treatment 
for schizophrenia, including the importance of actively participating in 
care, the frustrations of finding the right psychotropic medications, and the 
special problems of schizophrenia at different ages and stages.
Starting a Long and Complicated Process
Treating schizophrenia isn’t as simple as treating a cut, bruise, or minor 
infection. But a diagnosis of schizophrenia is definitely not a cause for 
hopelessness, as was once commonly assumed. A range of treatments and 
supports are available to control, or at least lessen, positive symptoms 
and to minimize potential losses created by negative or cognitive symptoms 
(see Chapter 3 for more on symptoms). Starting treatment is difficult in many 
ways, but it’s a time for renewed hope for a more normal life.

92
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
Treatment for schizophrenia tends to be long term, with many decision 
points along the way. If your loved one has been diagnosed with 
schizophrenia, think of your own self-education as an ongoing process. 
Decisions will begin to flow more easily over time, when you have more 
experience and information under your belt.
 
The beginning of treatment generally occurs after a person has a first psychotic 
episode (a loss of contact with reality, often signaled by hallucinations 
or delusions). But it also can refer to the time when a person reinitiates 
treatment after previously stopping.
Putting the what if’s and 
why’s behind you
The relief of having a diagnosis doesn’t negate all the questions and concerns 
you have about schizophrenia. You may still be frustrated because you don’t 
know what caused things to go awry. If so, recognize that there’s nothing to 
be gained by searching for explanations, which are only speculative anyway. 
Even brain researchers aren’t quite sure about the causes of schizophrenia. 
(See Chapter 2 for more about the causes of schizophrenia.)
 
There’s no room for placing blame after receiving a diagnosis of schizophre-
nia. No person is responsible for causing this brain disorder — not patients, 
family members, or anyone else. Looking for elusive causes is useless as well 
as distracting, because it places your focus on the past rather than the future.
 
It’s human nature to want answers, but in the case of mental illness, the 
causes are far more likely to lie in the brain than in the outside influences and 
events of a person’s life. After you have a diagnosis, put the “what if’s” and 
“why’s” behind you and help your loved one move into treatment with the 
positive belief that things can only get better from this point forward.
Developing a positive approach
Accepting the challenges you face and thinking positively about the future 
is essential — for both you and your loved one. In fact, you really have no 
alternative! No one likes to think of himself as being sick or being in the role 
of a patient, especially if the disease is long term — and this feeling is exacer-
bated in the case of mental illnesses, because of the strong stigma associated 
with them. But part of acceptance is recognizing that schizophrenia isn’t 
going to go away on its own and that losses can be minimized or even 
avoided by taking advantage of the resources available to you in your own 
community.

93
 Chapter 6: Beginning Treatment
The symptoms of schizophrenia, like those of many other chronic illnesses, 
are likely to get better and worsen over time, and they aren’t likely to 
respond to treatment in a week or two. But with appropriate treatment, 
schizophrenia doesn’t necessarily have a deteriorating course. In fact, the 
large majority of people with schizophrenia can go on to lead meaningful and 
satisfying lives.
 
Many myths and misperceptions discourage people from seeking mental-
healthcare (see Chapter 16). Many people fear that seeing a mental-health 
professional is an admission of weakness. Others fear that these professionals 
can read and control their minds. Both of these myths are untrue.
You or your loved one may be uncertain or concerned about the risks and 
benefits of using powerful psychiatric medications — this uncertainty is 
understandable. But one of the most important tasks in the first weeks and 
months after diagnosis will be understanding the specific risk-to-benefit 
ratio of using powerful psychiatric treatments in your loved one’s particular 
circumstances so she can take the steps needed to minimize losses and 
maximize opportunities. This is something your loved one should discuss 
with her psychiatrist, others on her healthcare team, and you (see Chapter 5 
for more on how to assemble a top-notch healthcare team).
 
Any treatment for any illness isn’t without side effects, but weighing the pros 
and cons, you’ll find that treatments for schizophrenia are generally worth the 
risks and may even be life-sustaining.
Getting comfortable in an 
uncomfortable setting
Starting anything new — even something positive — always feels uncomfort-
able at first. When your loved one meets a new psychiatrist or starts a new 
program, awkwardness, discomfort, and some anxiety are to be expected. 
You may have experienced the same feelings when you visited a new family 
doctor or dentist for the first time. After all, you’re potentially exposing your-
self, whether it’s your warts, your cavities, or something else that embar-
rasses you about yourself. But unless your loved one is candid with a 
clinician about what he’s feeling, he’ll be cheating himself and wasting time 
and money.
Some of the questions that may go through your loved one’s mind include 
the following:

94
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
 
 Can I trust this person with my feelings? Two people don’t always hit 
it off or connect from the get-go. Your loved one may find out that this 
person isn’t the type of individual who allows him to feel comfortable 
and forthcoming about his personal demons. But make sure your loved 
one gives the person a chance, recognizing that it’ll be hard at first 
and that most people feel uncomfortable when they start treatment. If 
the feelings don’t dissipate over time, your loved one may want to 
change treatment providers. However, if your loved one doesn’t feel 
comfortable with anyone, it may be due to the disorder itself.
 
 Will the information I share be kept confidential? Professionals are 
often overzealous about protecting someone’s confidentiality, but 
because confidentiality is important, your loved one should ask the 
clinician about whether she’ll be sharing the information with anyone 
else without explicit permission. Knowing the answer should help allay 
many concerns. This also applies to various programs your loved 
one might be attending. Generally, in most programs and ACT teams 
(see Chapter 5), the team will often share information with each other 
because they’re working collaboratively on your loved one’s behalf, but 
they won’t divulge the information to other people or programs without 
your loved one’s permission.
 
 If you or your loved one has concerns about confidentiality or any 
other questions about your loved one’s care, raise those concerns 
directly with the doctor and discuss it with each other. For example, 
it’s appropriate to question whether information will be shared with 
educational institutions, employers, or insurers. On the other hand, 
keeping families completely in the dark about a loved one’s diagnosis 
is generally counterproductive and should be avoided, when possible. 
(See Chapter 14 for more information on the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act and confidentiality.)
 
 Will I meet someone in the waiting room whom I know? Maybe. And if 
that happens, the person is there for the same reason as your loved one 
is, so she just needs to do her best to get over that fear.
 
 Will I play any role in my own treatment? Yes, an active one! The days 
of lying down on a couch and talking to an omnipotent analyst who only 
nods or says, “Hmm, I understand how you’re feeling” are just about 
over when it comes to state-of-the-art treatment for schizophrenia. Your 
loved one’s doctor or other clinician should involve him in all decisions 
about his treatment.
 
 For example, the doctor will explain the risks, benefits, and potential 
side effects of any medication that’s prescribed, and your loved one will 
be able to make choices about the medication that seems most appro-
priate to him from the ones approved for treatment. In subsequent 
visits, the doctor should be open and responsive to feedback from your 
loved one about how the medication is making him feel. The doctor 
should also be explicit about the consequences of not taking or stopping 
medication. When medications aren’t working, the doctor should 
suggest and discuss other treatment options with your loved one.

95
 Chapter 6: Beginning Treatment
 
 Shared decision-making is a term used today to describe the increasingly 
popular process of involving patients in making healthcare decisions 
with their clinicians, based on the best available evidence.
 
 Does seeing a psychiatrist when I’m symptomatic automatically mean 
I’ll be hospitalized? There’s a rather high bar for hospitalization these 
days — in fact, many people think it’s too high, with people being 
refused hospitalization when they need it. Only a very small proportion 
of people seen by clinicians require involuntary hospitalization, and 
most hospitalizations, whether voluntary or involuntary, are for relative 
short periods of time (days or weeks rather than months).
 
 Even people who hear voices or see things that aren’t there are rarely 
hospitalized, and if they are, it isn’t for long. If your loved one’s behavior 
and symptoms don’t represent a danger to herself or others, then she’s 
likely to be treated on an outpatient basis. If there’s a threat to her own 
self or danger to others, she probably would want to be treated in a 
secure setting for her own protection.
 
 Will I need to take medications for the rest of my life? Depending on 
your loved one’s diagnosis and the course of her illness, this is a distinct 
possibility, but the answer remains to be seen. Taking certain medica-
tions or taking medications at all is something that can be re-evaluated 
periodically, and you and your loved one can have a vital say in that 
decision.
Drawing On Local Resources
Until schizophrenia hits home, families generally aren’t aware of the commu-
nity resources available to help them. When your loved one has an acute 
psychotic break out of the blue, you may not even know a psychiatrist, 
especially a psychiatrist who specializes in treating serious mental disorders 
like schizophrenia. Even if you do, the person may not be immediately 
available — the emergency may occur at night or on a weekend, and you’ll 
have no alternative but to use the local hospital emergency room or call 
the police.
Many families find it helpful to check out the facilities in their neighborhood 
before a crisis occurs, so they can make an informed choice about where to 
go in different types of situations.
Scouting out local hospitals
Obviously, the best time to prepare for a crisis is when things are stable. If 
your relative has been showing signs of a serious mental disorder, you need 

96
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
to you do your legwork to identify the best place to go for acute emergency 
care, in case your loved one needs it. (Chapter 14 gives you tips on how to 
cope with psychiatric crisis.)
If your community has a crisis response team, you can call and find out 
what services are available to you. Be sure to ask if they offer alternatives to 
hospitalization.
 
If you ever have trouble getting through and it’s a psychiatric emergency, 
clearly tell the person who answers, “This is a psychiatric emergency.” If it 
isn’t an emergency and you’re having trouble reaching a human, ask for the 
director, CEO, or commissioner (in other words, the head honcho), depending 
on the agency or organization. Although that person isn’t likely to answer the 
phone, you’re likely to get a knowledgeable and responsible person who can 
help you.
Whether you’re looking for a hospital, an outpatient treatment program, 
or a rehabilitative program, navigating the mental healthcare system can be 
tricky — it’s often a complex and fragmented mix of public (federal, state, 
and local) and private resources. For example, some of the options for 
inpatient hospitalization include
 
 Private hospitals that focus on behavioral health issues (usually mental 
health and addiction)
 
 Psychiatric wards in local community hospitals
 
 Psychiatric wards in teaching hospitals affiliated with a medical school
 
 State-supported psychiatric hospitals
 
 Veterans’ hospitals administered by the Veterans Administration
 
No matter how ill a person may be, getting into a psychiatric hospital is no 
easy feat these days. (For more on hospitalization, turn to Chapter 14.)
Connecting with community services
Because of the high costs of inpatient care and restrictions placed by third-
party insurers, people who are hospitalized are likely to be discharged 
“sicker and quicker” than anyone might have thought or wanted. So the 
minute your loved one is hospitalized, start looking into discharge planning. 
Here are some items to add to your to-do list:
 
 Make sure that the staff knows the specifics of your loved one’s 
insurance coverage and that they’re explicit about the goals of 
hospitalization.

97
 Chapter 6: Beginning Treatment
 
 To double-check your loved one’s coverage, your loved one (or you) can 
independently verify his mental-health benefits, co-pays, and lengths of 
stay with the insurer.
 
 If your loved one has a private therapist or sees a psychiatrist in a 
public program, make sure that the clinician knows that your loved 
one has been hospitalized. Provide the outpatient clinician with the 
name of the inpatient doctor, and vice versa. This will help assure 
continuity of care.
 
 Inform the staff that you’ll need ample time before discharge to 
coordinate arrangements in the community. Walking in one day for 
a visit and finding the staff packing your loved one’s things can be 
disconcerting.
 
 Always stay one step ahead. Look into day programs, partial hospital-
ization programs, case management programs or ACT teams, or 
residences in the community.
 
Some hospitals have social workers, case managers, or discharge planners to 
help you make plans for after discharge. If one is on staff, ask to talk to this 
person.
Finding other resources in the community
When your loved one is on her own in the community, identifying local 
resources can be difficult. But when you start to look for mental-health 
facilities, you may be surprised to see them everywhere! Here are some 
options for finding services and supports:
 
 If your loved one already has a psychiatrist, psychologist, social 
worker, or clinician, ask for their help!
 
 Most cities or counties have either free-standing mental-health depart-
ments or ones that are under broader health or social services 
department. Check the government listings in your telephone directory 
or online to find out the name of the agency that oversees mental health 
in your local community.
 
 Solicit help from your state of local NAMI affiliate (www.nami.org) or 
from a family you know who has experienced mental illness firsthand.
 
 Contact your local affiliate of Mental Health America (www.nmha.org) 
or any other local mental-health program or citizen-advocacy group. 
Ask where you can find a directory of mental-health resources in your 
community.
 
 If you still have trouble finding the information you need, contact 
your state mental-health authority (see the appendix) and ask where 
you can access local information.

98
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
 
 Use print telephone directories or online ones (such as www.
switchboard.com or www.googleguide.com) to find information.
See the appendix for other resources to help you locate clinicians and 
programs.
Trying Different Treatments 
to Find What Works
 
Numerous treatments options are available for schizophrenia. But as is the 
case with many other chronic illnesses, these treatments control symptoms 
rather than provide cures. Plus, treatments (both medicines and psychosocial 
approaches) must be tried and evaluated for each individual. If one treatment 
doesn’t work, it can be replaced by another treatment. This trial-and-error 
approach is the rule rather than the exception for medical disorders 
(including high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, and 
even cancer).
With progress being made in genetic research, the goal is for medical treat-
ment to be personalized (known as personalized medicine). The idea of 
personalized medicine is that based on an individual’s genetic profile, 
clinicians will be able to select from among known effective treatments and 
know the one best-suited to the person’s genetic makeup, thus reducing the 
amount of trial and error necessary for a successful treatment outcome. In 
other words, doctors will be able to get it right the first time!
 
Don’t expect this kind of personalization to be available anytime in the next 
year, or possibly even the next decade. Even with all the advances that have 
been made, genetic research is still in its infancy.
For now, your loved one and his clinician (and sometimes involved family or 
friends) will first select a treatment and try it out to see how effective, safe, 
and tolerable it is. At the beginning of treatment, it’s especially important 
that your loved one stick to the prescribed treatments religiously and pro-
vide feedback to the clinician on whether symptoms and function are improv-
ing or not. With this information, your loved one and his doctor can gauge 
whether continuing the treatment regimen is the right thing to do.
 
People sometimes stop taking medications for what might sound like trivial 
reasons to others. But some side-effects — such as dry mouth and decreased 
sex drive — can be very annoying. If side-effects are a problem for your 
loved one, remind her that there are many choices of medications, each with 
different side-effect profiles, and sometimes just changing the dose will do 
the trick.

99
 Chapter 6: Beginning Treatment
Your loved one needs to be persistent in sticking with his doctor until they 
find a treatment that works. It’s also important to put things in perspective. 
Your loved one will be living with schizophrenia and participating in treat-
ment for a long time, and although it’s going to be part of his life, he doesn’t 
want it consume his whole life. In fact with appropriate treatment, your loved 
one will be able to forget the first unsuccessful stabs at treatment and recover 
to the extent that his illness fades more into the background of his life.
Finding a psychiatric medication 
that works for your loved one
The mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, 
and there are many to choose from (see Chapter 8). Here are some of the 
questions that your loved one and his psychiatrist will want to discuss in 
considering which medication to try first:
 
 If your loved one hasn’t taken antipsychotic medications before, 
has anyone else in the family ever taken them? If so, which one(s) 
worked best?
 
 If your loved one has taken antipsychotic medications before, which 
ones worked and which ones didn’t?
 
 If your loved one has taken antipsychotic medications before, did he 
experience any troubling side effects, such as:
 
• Tremors or other abnormal movements
 
• Stiffness of arms, legs, or face
 
• Feeling like he couldn’t remain still and had to move around
 
• Dry mouth
 
• Blurred vision
 
• Significant weight gain
 
• Drooling
 
• Faintness when quickly standing up
 
 If your loved one has insurance that covers medications, are there any 
medications that aren’t covered by the company?
 
 If your loved one doesn’t have insurance or other coverage, can she 
afford to pay for newer more expensive medications?
 
 Newer and/or more expensive doesn’t necessarily translate to “better” 
or “best.”
 
 Would your loved one prefer taking an injection once or twice a 
month rather than having to take medications by mouth one or two 
times a day?

100
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
If your loved one discusses these points with his physician, they’ll be able to 
work together to select a medication that has the greatest chance of being 
the right one for your loved one.
Rx: Take as directed
After medication is prescribed, your loved one will need to take it as directed 
on a regular basis. Remind her that medication is used to control her symp-
toms so she can lead a more satisfying and hassle-free life. Although she may 
see and feel some of the effects of the medication right away (less agitation, 
fewer hallucinations), it’s not unusual for the medication to take one or two 
weeks to begin working, and she shouldn’t expect miracles overnight — and 
neither should you!
More improvement will be seen over the course of the following weeks and 
months. However, if after several weeks no improvement is seen or felt, 
your loved one should talk to her doctor and ask whether this is the right 
medication for her.
We usually recommend that individuals see their clinician, or at least touch 
base with them on the phone, at least once a week when they first start a new 
medication.
 
Your loved one should never stop or abruptly change her medication on her 
own. She should always let the doctor know what’s going on, and they should 
decide together what to do. If your loved one doesn’t have an appointment 
scheduled and wants to go off her medication right away, encourage her to 
call her doctor first.
Help! I can’t stand the side effects!
What should your loved one do if the medication is working to control the 
symptoms but he’s encountering undesirable side-effects? Whenever a 
person is starting medication, it’s common to encounter some side-effects, 
such as drowsiness, blurred vision, or dry mouth, which go away over a 
short period of time. Other side-effects are slower to come on (like weight 
gain or some unexpected mouth and tongue movements). Side-effects are 
more often annoying or troubling, rather than dangerous.
When your loved one’s doctor prescribes a medication, have him ask what 
side-effects to be on the lookout for and what to do about them. (See Chapter 
8 for a list of common side-effects.) If your loved one has already left the 
office, there’s no harm calling the doctor or asking the pharmacist when you 
go to get the prescription filled.
 
Your loved one’s doctor should alert him to medically dangerous side-effects 
that need to be dealt with right away (as opposed to ones that are just annoy-
ing). A rapid drop in blood pressure, a rapid rise in temperature (not caused 
by another medical illness), stiffening of the back and neck, or eyes rolling up 

101
 Chapter 6: Beginning Treatment
in the head are possible side-effects that need immediate medical attention. 
If you think your loved one is having an adverse side-effect that could be 
life-threatening, call 911 and seek emergency attention.
 
Symptom control (especially positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucina-
tions, disorganized thoughts, and agitation) is the most immediate beneficial 
effect that your loved one will experience after taking medication. However, 
if the positive symptoms of schizophrenia have been controlled and the 
illness is still disrupting his school, work, or other important social roles, the 
addition of psychosocial and other support interventions can help facilitate 
recovery (see Chapter 9).
Considering therapies in 
addition to medications
A number of psychosocial, psychotherapy, and self-help approaches can 
be instrumental in your loved one’s recovery; these proven techniques 
can help overcome some of the remaining symptoms (sometimes called 
residual symptoms) and problems with daily living that can’t be helped with 
medicine alone.
Be sure to ask your loved one’s clinician, case manager, or rehabilitation 
specialist about these treatment resources. Depending on who you ask, your 
loved one will be directed either to another program or to other resources 
within the same program. Frequently, there will be an initial assessment of 
your loved one’s skills, and then specific exercises, tasks, and role-playing 
opportunities will be prescribed until your loved one achieves competence in 
these areas.
For example, if your loved one can’t keep up a basic conversation or know 
to make use of and enjoy leisure time, psychosocial skills programs can 
be effective in addressing these problems. A first step is usually an initial 
assessment of the individual’s skills and then specific exercises, tasks, and 
role-playing opportunities are prescribed until your loved one achieves 
competence in these areas.
If your loved one is having cognitive problems (for example, with memory, 
decision-making, verbal skills, and so on), cognitive remediation programs 
(some of which are computer-based) can improve functional impairments.
If your loved one needs help in knowing how to complete job applications, 
prepare a résumé, participate in a job interview, maintain consistent work 
and attendance habits, or otherwise function effectively in a work setting, 
vocational rehabilitation and clubhouse models (see Chapter 9) can provide 
these kinds of experiences.

102
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
 
Medical and other psychosocial and self-help interventions go hand in hand. 
They don’t conflict with one another. In fact, when they’re used together, they 
enhance the possibility of positive outcomes. Knee replacements wouldn’t be 
as successful without physical rehabilitation and vice versa — think about the 
marriage between antipsychotic medications and other treatments in the 
same way.
Treating schizophrenia 
and substance abuse
Another important aspect of treatment is the need to simultaneously 
address the symptoms of schizophrenia and alcohol and/or drug abuse. 
Unfortunately, because of lack of awareness of some professionals and the 
scarcity of integrated treatment programs, it’s more typical for these individ-
uals to be treated for only one condition or the other. (Those who specialize 
in mental health may know little about addictions, and those who specialize 
in addictions may know little about serious mental disorders.)
Yet patients with schizophrenia are five times more likely than the general 
population to be abusing one or multiple substances. If an underlying 
substance-abuse problem isn’t addressed simultaneously, it leads to poorer 
outcomes, including relapse, re-hospitalization, and arrest.
What to Do If Your Loved One 
Won’t Accept the Diagnosis
People with serious mental illnesses are often unable to recognize that 
they’re sick — even though it’s apparent to others. This situation is more 
than just denial (blocking out of conscious awareness things that are too 
painful). In the case of schizophrenia, this lack of recognition — which 
scientists now believe is the result of a brain dysfunction — is a symptom 
of the illness itself. It’s estimated that more than half — some say as many 
as 80 percent — of all individuals with schizophrenia lack awareness of 
their illness. Sometimes, lack of insight is worse during acute phases of the 
illness; other times it is a more consistent problem.
 
The technical term used to describe this condition of being unaware of one’s 
own illness is anosognosia. This condition also occurs with certain types of 
traumatic brain injuries and strokes, for example.

103
 Chapter 6: Beginning Treatment
Because lack of insight is so closely associated with refusing treatment and 
not adhering to medication plans, it can quickly become a battleground 
between patients and their frustrated families. There are no simple one-size-
fits-all solutions. Lack of insight usually can’t be addressed overnight, but 
there are some practical strategies for coming to terms with the need for 
treatment that may be worth trying:
 
 Exercising empathy: Flat-out confrontation rarely works and stands a 
better chance of exacerbating symptoms than reducing them; con-
versely, empathetic understanding can help. Find ways to communicate 
that you understand your loved one’s point-of-view. Typically, for 
people with schizophrenia, their delusions and hallucinations feel so 
real that they can’t be convinced otherwise. In this case, you can explain 
to your loved one that you want her to get help to better cope with 
these problems.
 
 For example, you might say, “I know how frightened you are of the 
soldiers who keep watching you.” You’re not saying that you buy into 
the delusion — you’re just showing your empathy and concern. Then 
say, “Maybe you can speak to a psychiatrist who can help you cope 
with the burden this has placed on you.” Again, you’re not accepting 
the delusional thinking, but you’re also not rejecting your loved one’s 
point-of-view.
 
 Encouraging symptomatic treatment: Although some people have no 
insight into their illness, they may have other annoying symptoms 
associated with schizophrenia that make them amenable to seeing a 
doctor (for example, insomnia or depression). You could suggest 
that your loved one see a psychiatrist or internist to address these 
symptoms without confronting the issue of schizophrenia or strange 
thinking head-on.
 
 Negotiating an agreement: Your loved one may be refusing to take her 
medicine, but she may ask you to take her shopping for some new 
clothes. Perhaps you could strike a bargain with her. If she consistently 
takes the medication for a week, you’ll take her out shopping. In the case 
of a teenager, you might make receiving her allowance contingent upon 
taking his medication or you might think up an interim reward, such as a 
new video game, for taking medication consistently over a certain period 
of time.
 
 To bargain effectively with anyone, you must understand his motivations 
and desires.
 
 Simplifying dosing strategies: Although scientists still don’t completely 
understand the neurobiological mechanisms associated with lack of 
insight, simplifying dosing strategies helps lessen the problem to some 
extent. Physicians can help by prescribing once-a-day pills or longer-
term injectable medications for patients who have problems complying 
with more complicated medication schedules.

104
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
 
 Doing everything you can to stay connected: This strategy is 
probably the most important one for encouraging compliance. Whatever 
your role, the worst thing you can do is cut off your relationship with 
someone with schizophrenia because he’s not taking his medication. 
Sometimes, taking medication only comes after developing a trusting 
relationship. A person with schizophrenia may need to make repeated 
visits to a doctor before he finally agrees to take his medication — even 
though you and everyone around him want it to happen more quickly.
If one of these strategies doesn’t work, try another. Sometimes they need to 
be used in combination or sequentially.
 
When someone doesn’t realize the need to take medications, encouraging the 
person to start a consistent medication regimen often requires the support of 
family members, friends (peers) and professionals.
As a friend or family member, you need to clearly distinguish between your 
nonsupport of the person’s decision to not take medication and your support 
for helping her recover from the illness. Things may seem hopeless now, but 
you never know when your loved one will change her mind.
If you learn that a case manager has terminated your loved one from program 
participation because of lack of insight, you need to remind the case manager 
that this is one of the problems associated with schizophrenia that the 
program is here to address. Some research suggests that psychosocial pro-
grams may benefit patients who lack insight, and that participation in these 
programs and the accompanying social supports may enhance a person’s 
self-awareness of their illness.
 
Patients are often more willing to accept a diagnosis when they’re among peer 
role models who are succeeding in managing the symptoms of their illnesses.
If you have the unfortunate experience of encountering a psychiatrist who 
discharges a patient for being unwilling to take medication, you can gently 
ask the doctor to build a relationship with the patient and find out the 
reasons why she’s so adverse to medication. Often, patients have had bad 
experiences with medications or negative experiences with other clinicians 
in the past, and they need to talk through them.
When people start the routine of taking medication and their symptoms are 
more controlled, they may be less adamant about not taking it. In fact, they 
may begin to recognize the benefits. If someone is completely out-of-touch 
with reality, these strategies are less likely to work. Unfortunately, your loved 
one may actually have to be on medication to realize that she needs it.
 
Some research suggests that the use of the antipsychotic medication 
clozapine may improve patient insight. Similarly, some cognitive-behavioral 
approaches have been shown to be effective (see Chapter 9).

105
 Chapter 6: Beginning Treatment
 
As people gain insight into their schizophrenia, the insight is often associated 
with depression because of their new recognition of the real losses they’ve 
experienced due to the illness. If your loved one is gaining insight into his 
illness and, at the same time, exhibiting signs of depression (particularly if 
he’s talking about or threatening suicide), immediately bring this to the 
attention of his clinician.
Because lack of insight in schizophrenia is associated with poorer outcomes 
(such as higher rates of relapse, re-hospitalization, and more impaired func-
tioning), it remains a very important clinical and research issue that requires 
more attention. In the meantime, don’t give up on your loved one. What 
didn’t work yesterday may work tomorrow.
 
I Am Not Sick: I Don’t Need Help, by Xavier Amador, PhD, with Anna-Lisa 
Johanson (Vida Press), has made a significant contribution to the literature 
on this topic. Dr. Amador weaves together the story of his own brother’s 
schizophrenia with research on lack of insight and provides helpful practical 
tips to family members and clinicians who struggle with this problem.
Treatment Considerations 
for Special Populations
Although schizophrenia usually strikes people in their teens or young-adult 
years, it can occur at any age or stage during a person’s life and the criteria 
for diagnosis remain the same regardless of age. However, different people 
may require different treatment — for example, a child may need different 
treatment than an older adult. Also, an increasing number of people with 
schizophrenia are being diagnosed with co-occurring substance-abuse 
problems, which are complex to diagnose and treat in the presence of a 
serious mental disorder.
 
Although scientists are learning about the differences among various 
special populations, these findings don’t apply to every case. In the following 
sections, we make some generalizations that apply to large groups rather than 
to individuals. Your loved one may fall into one of these categories but exhibit 
different symptoms or need different treatments. This is just a starting point 
for a conversation with your loved one’s doctor.
Children
Schizophrenia affects children from families of all socioeconomic classes and 
cultural backgrounds. It’s often more challenging to diagnose schizophrenia 
in children because of the rapid developmental changes that they experience 
and their inability to describe the symptoms they’re experiencing.

106
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
As a result, the disorder typically goes undiagnosed for many years. Often, 
doctors are also reluctant to stigmatize a young child with a diagnosis of 
schizophrenia even though that’s what it looks like; unwittingly, the child is 
diagnosed with a disorder that is more acceptable to parents (such as 
depression) but doesn’t receive the proper treatment.
 
The median age of diagnosis in children is 14 — but the average duration of 
symptoms before diagnosis is nine years! Schizophrenia is rarely diagnosed 
in children under the age of 5 and is far less common than most other mental 
disorders in children, affecting about 1 in 40,000 children under the age of 13. 
Because children spend a major portion of their day at school, teachers and 
other school personnel often play an instrumental role in identifying serious 
mental disorders and in referring families for evaluation, diagnosis, and 
treatment.
Childhood schizophrenia usually appears gradually but can also have a 
sudden onset; many of its symptoms often overlap with other childhood 
disorders such as autism, developmental disorders, conduct disorders, 
and learning disabilities. Here are the most common warning signs of child-
hood schizophrenia. Remember: Different children may experience these 
symptoms differently.
 
 Delusions: For example, believing that monsters are in his room at 
bedtime. (For more on delusions, see Chapter 3.)
 
 Hallucinations: Eighty percent of children with schizophrenia have 
auditory hallucinations such as hearing voices telling them to do things. 
(For more on hallucinations, see Chapter 3.)
 
 When children experience hallucinations or delusions, particularly after 
the age of 7, they should be evaluated by a mental-health professional.
 
 Social withdrawal (severe problems in making or keeping friends)
 
 Very detailed, bizarre thoughts and ideas
 
 Confused thinking
 
 Suspiciousness or paranoia (thinking that someone is going to 
harm them)
 
 Language delays
 
 Poor social and self-care skills
 
 Extreme moodiness, diminished emotions, or lack of emotional 
expression when speaking
 
 Distorted perceptions of reality (such as an inability to distinguish 
dreams or TV from reality)
 
 Poor personal hygiene

107
 Chapter 6: Beginning Treatment
 
 Suicidal thoughts
 
 Extreme fearfulness or clinginess
 
It takes a trained individual to make a diagnosis of childhood schizophrenia. 
Don’t panic if your child has one bad dream or your child seems more clingy 
than her playmates. However, if your child has a number of these warning 
signs, you should bring them to the attention of your pediatrician to see if 
they warrant immediate further evaluation (by a child and adolescent psychia-
trist) or whether you should simply monitor for the time being to see how 
things progress.
Although medication is the primary treatment for childhood schizophrenia, 
many of the drugs prescribed for children are approved for use only in adults 
and are used off-label for children. Because children aren’t just little adults, 
they need to receive treatment from an experienced child and adolescent 
psychiatrist who is specifically trained to diagnose and treat children with 
schizophrenia.
Witnessing a child with the disturbing symptoms of schizophrenia is horribly 
frightening for the entire family, especially siblings. Things can quickly spiral 
out of control, leaving families feeling helpless. For this reason, psychiatrists 
generally prescribe medication right away — sometimes even before making 
a definitive diagnosis — to treat the psychotic episode.
 
Because children are less able to give feedback about how they’re feeling and 
less likely to be able to identify side-effects, their medication needs to be mon-
itored more closely during treatment than it does in adults. If the psychotic 
behaviors don’t respond to medication, the child may have to be hospitalized 
for a short time.
The same medications used for adults are effective in reducing hallucinations 
and delusions (which tend to be more transitory in children). Although 
second-generation antipsychotic medications (see Chapter 8), like clozapine 
(brand name: Clozaril) and olanzapine (brand name: Zyprexa), are less likely 
to produce movement disorders than first-generation antipsychotics, they 
often lead to excess weight gain, which can cause other serious health prob-
lems. These side effects can be especially troubling to teens who are already 
overly-concerned about their appearance and what others think about 
their looks. Work with your child’s doctor to consider the pros and cons of 
different medications and try to find one that not only relieves the symptoms 
but produces the fewest troubling side effects.
In addition to medication, family psychoeducation can be very helpful in 
assisting a family learn to learn how to adjust and cope with the illness. 
Children should be given age-appropriate information about the disorder 
as well, so they can better understand what’s happening to them or their 
sibling. Children also can benefit from other types of psychotherapies and 
psychosocial therapies that provide support and skills training.

108
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
 
Schools can play a pivotal role in meeting the educational and social needs 
of children with schizophrenia. Many children with schizophrenia can benefit 
from special education and other accommodations in school, including an 
individualized education plan (IEP). When children are unable to attend 
school, they may require in-home services and supports. To find out more 
about IEPs, go to www.ed.gov/parents/needs/speced/iepguide.
The disease process of schizophrenia is similar in children and adults, but in 
children, schizophrenia is
 
 More likely to have a severe course
 
 More likely to recur (come back again)
 
 Associated with greater functional impairments (because it often 
interrupts schooling and normal developmental tasks of childhood 
and adolescence)
 
Despite these warnings, many children fully recover, showing no apparent 
signs of the illness as adults. Unfortunately, little is known about how to 
predict which children will or will not be disabled by their illness.
College students
Because the age of onset of schizophrenia often coincides with the time when 
kids head off to college, it’s not surprising that many families have to grapple 
with sons and daughters who have their first break on college campuses, 
which are often far away from home. Also, because of improved treatments, 
many young people with prior histories of schizophrenia (who may not have 
otherwise had the opportunity to do so before the advent of newer medica-
tions) are heading off to college after having been diagnosed and treated.
The college years can be stressful ones for a variety of reasons such as 
moving away from friends and family for the first time, more difficult course-
work and studying for exams, irregular patterns of eating and sleeping, 
tendency to experiment with alcohol and/or drugs, and pressure to compete 
and conform. These stresses can precipitate a first break in someone who 
is genetically vulnerable or provoke relapse in someone who has already 
been diagnosed.
 
Parents of children with a genetic history of schizophrenia, whose teen has 
shown no signs of schizophrenia, may want to take extra steps to ease this 
difficult transition:
 
 Talk to her about schizophrenia and mental disorders. A number of 
Web sites provide just enough information for teenagers (see the 
appendix). Remember, though, that lack of insight may still interfere 
with a college student’s ability to recognize her early symptoms.

109
 Chapter 6: Beginning Treatment
 
 Arrange to see your teen every other month or so and to check in 
more frequently by phone. You don’t want to be a helicopter parent, 
hovering over his every move, but you want to watch for significant 
changes in thinking, mood, and behavior. Parent days on campus, holi-
days at home, and summer vacations can allow you the opportunity to 
unobtrusively check in on your college student.
 
 Introduce your teen to the student health services office or counseling 
center at the college so he knows that help is available if he needs it.
 
 Tell your teen about Active Minds on Campus, a nonprofit that helps 
raise mental health awareness among young adults between the ages 
of 18 and 24 (see the appendix).
 
If your son or daughter has already been diagnosed with schizophrenia, 
discuss his or her choice of colleges in advance. Here are some things to 
look for:
 
 A college that’s closer to home: Try to find one that’s within a day’s 
drive, so you can be there to help if necessary.
 
 A college that is less stressful: Some schools have ultra-competitive 
environments; others are more laid back. You want a school where the 
emphasis isn’t 100 percent on grades and competition, so your son or 
daughter can learn without any added stress.
 
 A college that provides more support: Find out about the psychological 
services available on campus. Ask whether any special accommodations 
or supports are available to people with mental or emotional problems. 
The way your questions are handled and responded to will give you a 
feel for the degree of understanding and acceptance of mental-health 
issues by college mental-health administrators. Increasingly, institutions 
of higher education are providing mentors or coaches to provide 
support to people with disabilities. The more support, the better.
 
 Make sure there is at least one practicing psychiatrist on staff. Introduce 
yourself and your son or daughter to the psychiatrist before school 
starts. Ask to be kept informed about any significant problems. Make 
sure that the college has your son or daughter’s written permission to 
inform you of any problems.
 
 A survey found that one in four college students report experiencing 
suicidal thoughts. Don’t let patient confidentiality keep you out of the 
loop when it comes to your child’s mental health.
 
 A college that has a student health center with a fully stocked 
pharmacy: If your son or daughter is currently taking psychotropic 
medications, make sure the school pharmacy has an adequate supply 
(or send him or her to school with enough medication to last until the 
next visit home) or make sure that your student has access to a local or 
mail-order pharmacy.

110
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
The large majority of colleges and institutions of higher education have 
limited knowledge about schizophrenia. Don’t be surprised if you or your 
loved one needs to teach certain educators and administrators about the 
disorder.
 
Before your kid leaves for college, talk with him openly about what to do in 
an emergency. Decide whom he should call first, perhaps you or a therapist. 
Make sure he has the phone number of a nearby hospital with a psychiatric 
unit or the contact information for a help line or crisis center. If you’re 
confident that the information will be kept confidential and only shared with 
your permission, make the emergency plan available to the college health 
office as well.
 
A growing number of college campuses are sprouting NAMI clubs, where 
people with major mental disorders can get peer support and practical assis-
tance from other students. You can find out about them at the NAMI Web site 
(www.nami.org).
People with schizophrenia 
and co-occurring substance 
abuse problems
Between one-quarter and one-half of people diagnosed with schizophrenia 
also have co-occurring alcohol and/or drug problems (sometimes referred to 
as a dual diagnosis). Like schizophrenia, substance-abuse disorders tend to 
be chronic (long-standing) with a pattern of multiple relapses and remissions. 
These dually diagnosed individuals have a higher risk of self-destructive and 
violent behaviors, which often results in homelessness, housing instability, 
incarceration, poor nutrition, inadequate finances, and medical problems.
It can be challenging for either a mental-health professional or an addiction 
professional to diagnose the other disorder in the absence of multiple con-
tacts with the individual over time. But an integrated assessment, by some-
one trained in both mental-health and substance abuse, can help better 
identify co-occurring disorders by systematically looking at the symptoms, 
history, and course of each disorder in the same individual.
In order to manage and treat co-occurring disorders effectively, a long-term, 
multidisciplinary team approach — comprised of medical, mental-health, and 
addiction-treatment specialists — is necessary to provide integrated services 
based on a single individualized treatment plan addressing both disorders. 
Unfortunately, many treatment programs are still organized and funded to 
treat one disorder or the other.

111
 Chapter 6: Beginning Treatment
Some of the special approaches used with this population include
 
 Psychoeducational classes that help consumers recognize their 
symptoms and identify the triggers that precipitate relapse
 
 “Double-trouble” groups and self-help recovery groups that acknowl-
edge both co-occurring disorders and provide useful forums for 
consumers to discuss and understand them
 
 Special 12-step programs that are sensitive to the needs of individuals 
with both disorders
Because of the extraordinary barriers these individuals face in accessing and 
keeping housing and also because of their intensive treatment needs, many 
individuals with co-occurring disorders benefit from long-term residential 
treatment facilities and modified therapeutic communities.
 
Another serious problem plaguing people with schizophrenia (and worrisome 
to their loved ones) is nicotine addiction. It has been estimated that 75 
percent of people with schizophrenia smoke despite the obvious health risks. 
This is another issue to be tackled by psychiatrists trained in addiction.
Older adults
Although schizophrenia is thought of as a disorder of young people, it 
can begin in later life or extend into later life when diagnosed earlier. 
Approximately 0.05 percent of the population (or 1 in 2,000 people) over 
the age of 65 has schizophrenia, making it about half as common as it is 
among those between the ages of 18 and 54. With people living longer, the 
numbers of older people with schizophrenia are likely to increase.
 
Generally, schizophrenia that occurs after the age of 45 is characterized as 
having a late onset.
Some people suggest that the late-onset form of schizophrenia is less 
severe than its early-onset counterpart. Other researchers hypothesize that 
late-onset schizophrenia is a distinctly different type of disorder. Because 
psychotic symptoms can also occur in people with Alzheimer’s disease, the 
disease is sometimes initially misdiagnosed.
Some of the distinctive characteristics of the illness when it first appears 
later in life include the following:
 
 Late-onset schizophrenia is more common in women than in men.
 
 The symptoms of late-onset schizophrenia are less severe overall.
 
 A person with late-onset schizophrenia is more likely to include 
symptoms of suspiciousness or paranoia.

112
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
 
 Less cognitive impairment is seen in those with late-onset schizophrenia.
 
 Negative symptoms (see Chapter 3) are less likely to appear with 
late-onset schizophrenia.
 
 Lower doses of psychotropic medications are required to manage the 
symptoms of late-onset schizophrenia.
 
 Late-onset schizophrenia has a better prognosis.
 
 Fewer suicide attempts are seen among those with late-onset schizo-
phrenia. That said, the rate of successful suicide attempts is especially 
high in elderly men.
Older individuals are less likely to self-refer for mental-health treatment for a 
variety of reasons, so outreach efforts are important to identify the disorder. 
Seniors may resist treatment, be unable to afford it, or be unable to access 
it because of mobility problems — and their relatives may think they’re too 
old to get started now. For this reason, it’s vitally important that general 
practitioners who tend to see older patients often, recognize the symptoms 
of schizophrenia and how they differ from the symptoms of dementia and 
suggest specialized treatment by a geriatric psychiatrist.
The most significant challenge in treating older adults with schizophrenia 
has to do with the potential adverse effects of psychotropic medications. 
Older people can be sensitive to very small doses of medication, so medica-
tion needs to be monitored closely, and psychiatrists generally begin treat-
ment with small doses and increase it slowly. Also, because older people 
tend to have other chronic illnesses, there’s always an increased risk of drug 
interactions that needs to be considered.
Finally, as a group, older people are more sensitive to movement disorders 
(such as tardive dyskinesia; see Chapter 8).
But it is important to remember that mental illnesses are treatable conditions 
in older adults.
 
Like children, older adults tend to be excluded from many treatment research 
studies, so scientists don’t know as much about the effectiveness and safety of 
medications and other treatments in this group. Much of the information that 
guides the use of medications comes from studies of younger people with 
schizophrenia or from the practical experience of clinicians who work with 
older adults.
 
About half of all older people who receive mental health care receive it from 
their primary doctors, who may not be best equipped to provide it. If possible, 
seek out a geriatric psychiatrist (a psychiatrist who specializes in the treatment of 
older people) for your loved one. Geriatric psychiatrists are usually more experi-
enced in making diagnoses in this population. Plus, because of their experience, 
they’re also more familiar with the range of medications that work effectively, 
appropriate dosing, and potential side effects and interactions with other drugs.

113
 Chapter 6: Beginning Treatment
Because of a number of factors including their limited income, curtailed 
mobility, and social isolation, only half of older adults who acknowledge 
mental-health problems receive any treatment at all. And although the use of 
nursing homes and state hospitals for treatment has declined considerably 
for younger populations, the decline has been far less dramatic with older 
people. Sometimes psychiatric nurses can make home visits, often paid for 
by Medicare, to help older people with schizophrenia remain with their 
families or in their homes. (See Chapter 7 for help with financing mental 
health care.)
 
If an older person with schizophrenia is suspicious or unwilling to take 
antipsychotic medications for other reasons, she’ll often reconsider if she’s 
told that the medication will improve her sleep (often a problem and concern 
in older people) or will help alleviate her anxiety.
Women
Although there are tremendous variations among individuals, schizophrenia 
affects women differently than it does men:
 
 In general, women experience a later onset of the illness than do men.
 
 Often, but not always, women have delusions that are less bizarre than 
those of men. Female delusions often involve sex, pregnancy, and/or 
romance.
 
 The course of the disorder tends to be less severe in women, with less 
functional impairment, than is seen in men.
 
 Women typically experience more profound mood symptoms than 
men do.
 
 Women are less likely to concurrently abuse drugs and/or alcohol than 
men are.
 
 Women are slightly more responsive to psychotropic medications, often 
requiring smaller doses.
 
 Women experience more favorable outcomes, in general, than men.
 
Some research suggests that estrogen has a protective effect for women 
before the age of menopause and that, after menopause, women develop 
schizophrenia at about the same rate as men.
Treatment of women with schizophrenia is more complicated because of 
hormones, pregnancy, and their role as mothers. Women often need less 
medication, because of their weight and the effects of hormones. Plus, 
because mood disorders are more likely to be prominent in women, they 
may be more likely to require antidepressants or mood stabilizers in addition 
to their antipsychotic medication.

114
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
Women benefit from the same psychotherapies, psychosocial strategies, 
and self-help programs as do men, but if possible, your loved one should take 
advantage of opportunities to address her special needs as a woman. For 
example, women with schizophrenia aren’t always able to care for their 
offspring, which can be a cause of severe distress to them. This issue needs 
to be sensitively addressed by mental-health workers so women learn to 
understand the limitations their illness might pose in terms of their ability to 
maintain custody of their children — without making them feel guilty. In 
many cases, mental-health staff will want to encourage a more realistic, but 
meaningful, relationship between mother and child. Many women resist 
treatment for fear that their children will be taken away when someone 
learns about their illness. Also, women who have been mothers may have 
had little opportunity to hone their career skills and can benefit from 
additional help in this arena.
 
The issue of pregnancy is always a serious one and more so for a woman with 
schizophrenia. The offspring of a woman with schizophrenia has an increased 
genetic risk of the disorder (see Chapter 2). Also, the added stress that comes 
with being responsible for an infant can increase the potential for relapse. 
If your loved one with schizophrenia wants to have a child, she should 
discuss the possibility and timing of a pregnancy with a trusted healthcare 
professional before becoming pregnant.
If your loved one decides to get pregnant, decisions about taking or stopping 
psychiatric medications during pregnancy are often fraught with confusion. 
Although, in general, anyone should try to use as little medication as possible 
(especially early in the pregnancy), stopping antipsychotic medication does 
increase the risk of relapse in people with schizophrenia. Because there’s no 
ironclad data on the effects of antipsychotic medication on the fetus, this is 
something a woman will want to discuss with her psychiatrist. It appears that 
first-generation antipsychotics pose more risk of miscarriage and genetic 
defects than second-generation antipsychotics do, although the incidence is 
quite low for both types.
 
Care must also be exercised after childbirth when breastfeeding, because 
medication can make its way into the mother’s breast milk, which can result 
in infants experiencing some of the side effects seen in adults. Also worrisome: 
Possible effects on the developing infant brain and subsequent behavior 
are still unknown. To improve the odds, both mother and child should be 
followed carefully by a knowledgeable psychiatrist before, during, and after 
the pregnancy.
 
Like other things in life, there are no guarantees, and your loved one’s deci-
sions should be based on the best information she can get from her health-
care team. Prior to becoming pregnant, some women with schizophrenia 
decide to consult with a genetic counselor (a specialized professional who 
reviews the medical and family history to assess genetic risks and evaluate 
them with the patient).

115
 Chapter 6: Beginning Treatment
 
Separate from pregnancy considerations, virtually all first-generation antipsy-
chotic medications and some second-generation medications (especially 
risperidone [brand name: Risperidal]) cause a large rise in the hormone 
prolactin. There are no known serious health effects resulting from increased 
levels of this hormone, but it can lead to lactation (milk being produced in 
the breast), which is a disturbing side effect, especially in men. (Generally 
this is less a problem in women because they naturally have higher levels of 
prolactin than men do.)
Cultural variations
Some people feel more comfortable speaking to someone who shares a 
similar background and whom they perceive is better able to understand 
where they’re coming from. For some people, this may mean seeking out a 
therapist of the same age, gender, race, sexual orientation, or country of 
origin — although having these characteristics in common may be relatively 
unimportant to others.
This applies to treatment settings, too. We met a mother who told us 
about her 40-something son with schizophrenia who lived in a supervised 
residence. One of the most difficult things for him to adapt to was the fact 
that most of the workers in the home were almost 20 years younger and less 
educated, and were in a role of telling him what to do.
 
People who have schizophrenia and are members of minority groups face a 
number of barriers when it comes to receiving appropriate, high-quality 
mental health care:
 
 Problems with access: These problems may arise because of poverty, 
lack of health insurance, problems with transportation, and so on.
 
 Reliance on emergency rooms rather than outpatient care often due to 
lack of insurance to pay for routine psychiatric care and medication.
 
 Pervasive stigma against mental illness and its treatment by family 
and friends among certain groups: For example, in some cultures 
mental illness is sometimes seen as a sign of moral weakness rather than 
a brain disorder.
 
 Lack of mental-health personnel who speak the same language and 
understand their culture or who are sensitive to an individual’s sexual 
orientation.
 
 Poor mental-health literacy: They may not understand or recognize the 
signs and symptoms of mental disorders.

116
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
 
 Intrinsic differences in help-seeking behavior: Some groups of people 
simply don’t go for medical help as soon or as often as other people do.
 
 Lack of trust in the professional mental-health system: Certain groups 
may feel more comfortable turning to their families or their churches for 
help in coping with their problems.
Finally, because minorities are underrepresented in research, treatment 
approaches often are not focused around their special strengths and needs.
Schizophrenia around the world
The symptoms that any person with schizophre-
nia experiences need to be interpreted within 
the context of his background and culture. 
Certain thoughts or behaviors, for example, that 
are considered delusional in the United States 
may be acceptable somewhere else around the 
world — in some cultures or religions, it’s 
common for people to experience “visions” or 
to speak to the dead. If a therapist is a nonbe-
liever and doesn’t understand this, he may 
misdiagnose the person.
Also, in some cultures, different types of delu-
sions tend to be more prominent. For example, 
in Ireland, people often have delusions of saint-
hood; in Japan, delusions of public humiliation 
are more common. Such differences point to 
the need for clinicians to be attentive to culture 
in diagnosing schizophrenia.
To learn more about the differences in schizo-
phrenia in different parts of the world, the World 
Health Organization has studied people with 
schizophrenia in both developed and develop-
ing countries. They found that the disorder 
tends to be more severe in developed, industri-
alized countries — speculating that it might be 
because undeveloped countries provide more 
social support and have less stressful and less 
competitive environments.
The same research team found that people with 
schizophrenia in developed countries tended to 
have disorders that came on gradually, while 
those in developing countries had more acute 
episodes that were shorter-lasting.

loved one. The bad news is that you’ll need to be persistent and patient to 
receive the government benefits that are out there — and will likely have to 
pitch in to cover the gaps in what’s available.
Ideally, you and your loved one will find a social worker, case manager, or 
other mental-health advocate to help you navigate the murky waters of 
financing mental health care, but much of the burden of finding and funding 
care falls on the person with schizophrenia or, more often, his family.
In this chapter, we give you a primer of where to look and who to ask for 
additional information on financial issues related to the care and treatment of 
people with schizophrenia, to make navigating these waters a little easier.
Paying for Care
When you consider the cost of treatment for schizophrenia, you may be 
thinking, “That’s what insurance is for,” but even private insurance has pit-
falls when it comes to funding mental-health treatment, and many people 
with schizophrenia have no insurance at all.

Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
The complicated world of mental healthcare
Mental healthcare, like general medical care in 
the United States today, is characterized by a 
byzantine labyrinth of treatment facilities, 
private and public programs, charities, and reli-
gious and volunteer organizations that include
  Hospitals and outpatient care
  Primary care (family physicians) and spe-
cialty care (such as psychiatrists, thera-
pists, and social workers)
  Health, rehabilitative, and support services
The mental healthcare system is fragmented 
among different programs, each supported by 
different sources of funding, and different eligi-
bility and application requirements that may 
require endless paperwork and the patience of 
Job to complete. (Keep in mind that this is frag-
mentation is no different than that encountered 
by people taking care of older parents with 
chronic health problems. Because of the 
diverse payers for different types of care, a 
family caregiver may be coordinating care 
among five different specialty doctors, a hospi-
tal, home health aides, and a hospice program.) 
The patchwork maze of healthcare in America 
can be dizzying to anyone and mental health-
care is no different except that the 
person requiring care may be more mentally 
incapacitated during an acute crisis.
Programs often have lengthy waiting lists. 
And these programs usually don’t communicate 
with each other or maintain continuity of 
care for the consumer. Unfortunately, when it 
comes to mental health, it’s safe to say that 
there is no such thing as one-stop shopping. If 
only there was a mental-health dollar store that 
was open 24/7. And like cancer, diabetes, or 
heart disease, the cost of specialized care for 
schizophrenia is exorbitant and can easily 
devour the savings of most ordinary families. In 
addition, family caregivers often lose time at 
work and may even lose their jobs because 
of their personal stake in being there for 
their loved one whenever needed — which 
may occur often, and which is generally 
unpredictable.
Because resources vary from one community 
to the next, there’s no simple handbook or Web 
site that enables people to easily learn the 
“system” that they’ll need to rely upon. 
Moreover, because of changing laws and regu-
lations, the system is often in flux. Navigating 
the system can be particularly challenging for 
people who aren’t sophisticated in dealing with 
bureaucracies or for whom the system poses 
language or cultural barriers. Patients, friends, 
and families usually find out about affordable, 
accessible, and high-quality resources in their 
respective communities simply by talking to 
each other and to savvy clinicians.
The stigma, discrimination, and lack of under-
standing associated with mental disorders his-
torically have made mental-health treatment 
pretty unpopular among taxpayers. Over the 
last 50 years, states have drastically reduced 
the number of state-supported psychiatric beds 
(transferring costs to national and local govern-
ments) to the point where there are even wait-
ing lists for the relatively small number of 
individuals who require long-term supervised 
residential treatment.
Often, because of gaps in community care, 
individuals wind up in more costly skilled nurs-
ing facilities, jails, and homeless shelters. Based 
on this situation, many mental-health advocates 
and legislators have reframed the question from 
“How can we afford to pay for mental 
healthcare?” to “How can we afford not to?”

119
 Chapter 7: Paying for Your Loved One’s Care
 
An estimated 47 million Americans have no insurance, and many fall into the 
lower socioeconomic brackets. Because of this, many people avoid or simply 
can’t afford necessary care, which leads to more costly and complex problems 
down the road.
Finding adequate treatment is only the first step in living with schizophrenia 
(and one we discuss in detail in Chapters 5 and 6). The second and often 
more difficult step is finding the resources to pay for it. A poll conducted by 
the American Psychological Association and Harris Interactive in 2008 
reported that 42 percent of those queried said that cost is the leading factor 
that discourages people from seeking out mental-health services.
The cost of treatment poses a formidable barrier for anyone with a chronic 
illness. Many middle-class families experience extraordinary financial 
strains trying to provide help and pay for care for their relatives over the 
long term — especially when the individual isn’t able to support himself or 
has no health insurance or disability insurance.
In the following sections, we look at your options for paying for care for your 
loved one.
 
Although they’re a complement to — rather than a substitute for — 
professional care and treatment, self-help and support groups (see Chapter 9) 
can be invaluable in providing information and support — and they’re 
usually free! A self-help group may also help you better understand how to 
take advantage of the financial resources available to your loved one — 
members generally are happy to share information on navigating the mental 
healthcare system.
Private insurance
If your loved one is fortunate enough to have some type of private health 
insurance, you need to understand its provisions for coverage of behavioral 
healthcare (a term commonly used to include mental illness and substance-
abuse treatment). Here are some of the ways in which private health 
insurance plans vary:
 
 Which practitioners your loved one is allowed to see: If your loved 
one’s insurance plan is a point-of-service (POS) plan, he’ll be able 
to go to any practitioner he wants. If his plan is a health maintenance 
organization (HMO) or preferred provider organization (PPO), he’ll 
have to choose providers from a preapproved list.
 
 Out-of-pocket costs of seeing an out-of-network physician: If your loved 
one chooses to see someone who isn’t on her HMO or PPO preapproved 
list, she may have to pay a large percentage of the cost herself. These 
percentages vary from one provider to the next.

120
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
 
 Whether your loved one must have a referral from a primary-care 
doctor or case manager before he sees a psychiatric specialist: In 
general, HMOs require referrals in order to see specialists, whereas 
PPOs do not. These individuals are often called “gatekeepers” because 
they try to minimize costs by preventing unnecessary or more expensive 
than necessary care. Some insurers have a person see the case manager 
before he is referred to a specialist; other times, this is handled over 
the phone.
 
 The number and/or frequency of outpatient visits and/or days of 
hospitalization allowed yearly or in a lifetime: When a person is facing 
a chronic illness like schizophrenia, those limits can be reached quickly.
 
 The maximum dollar limits on the amount of lifetime coverage: Again, 
chronic illnesses are costly, and although it may seem impossible that 
your loved one would ever reach the limit, it can actually happen quite 
quickly if your loved one needs inpatient care on a repeated basis.
 
 Whether the costs of your loved one’s care will be fully paid for: 
Some insurance plans cover 100 percent of the cost of care. Most plans 
require the patient to pay deductibles, co-payments, or other types of 
out-of-pocket costs.
 
 Whether hospitals on the plan are conveniently located and offer 
high-quality mental healthcare: Just as your loved one’s plan may have 
a list of preapproved doctors, only certain hospitals may be covered on 
the plan. You need to find out which hospitals are covered, and whether 
they offer the kind of care your loved one may need.
 
 Whether psychiatric emergency care is covered and how: If you go to 
an emergency room and your loved one isn’t considered to be an imme-
diate danger to himself or others, you may be sent away and referred to 
outpatient care.
 
Your insurer may define a “psychiatric emergency” according to an overly 
strict standard. If this happens, you may need to provide explicit evidence 
that your loved one is dangerous to herself of others. It’s always helpful to 
find an ally in a physician who understands the illness and is willing to go to 
bat for your loved one.
 
 Whether medications are paid for under the plan: Not all plans cover 
all medications. Some have a list of medications that are preferred, 
and if your loved one needs to take a medication not on that list, 
he may have to pay more than he would otherwise. (See Chapter 8 
for more information on medication formularies and prescription 
assistance plans.)
 
 Talk to your loved one’s psychiatrist about which medications are 
approved by his insurance plan. She may be able to prescribe a 
medication that’s just as effective and is covered by his insurance.

121
 Chapter 7: Paying for Your Loved One’s Care
 
 The age at which offspring are no longer considered dependents 
under family policies: Depending on your insurer and the laws of the 
state where you reside, the age at which a full-time student is no longer 
covered under his parents insurance varies.
 
 Coverage of preexisting mental conditions: If your loved one was 
previously treated for a mental disorder and you change insurers, 
you may find that your new insurer is unwilling to cover a preexisting 
condition.
 
 In general, many insurers deny claims because they are filed with insuffi-
cient information or documentation, or improper codes provided by 
the practitioner. This means that your loved one or you may need to 
take on the task of appealing denials within certain fixed periods of time. 
Because this entails keeping prior documentation, communicating with 
the healthcare provider, and responding within a timely manner, it may 
be a burden that you suggest helping your loved one with.
 
When you’re selecting a plan, you need to weigh the pros and cons of each in 
relation to the needs and resources of your family. These are also important 
considerations to look into whenever anyone changes jobs or seeks new 
employment. Choose plans that provide mental-health coverage (just in case 
you or someone in your family becomes one of the 25 percent of Americans 
suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder each year). Opt for plans that allow 
you to choose your own practitioners if you can afford it. On the other hand, 
HMOs may simplify the burden of filing claims.
There are often unfair disparities in coverage for mental, behavioral, and 
emotional problems as compared to physical health problems. For example, 
a plan can set limits for mental healthcare coverage at $50,000 and set limits 
for physical health at 20 times that amount.
Mental-health parity is a legislative reform being enacted in many states 
and at the federal level that tries to restore parity (equality) so insurance 
benefits for mental and physical illnesses are covered equally. The federal 
law enacted in 1998 is imperfect — it has too many exceptions. State parity 
laws have attempted to close the gaps, but these laws vary from state to 
state. Some of the goals of mental health parity include the following:
 
 A single deductible for both physical and mental illness
 
 Equal out-of-pocket costs and/or co-payments
 
 No yearly or lifetime limits to the number of visits or dollars paid
Remember that even if you aren’t concerned about health parity now, you 
never know when you or someone in your family will need mental healthcare. 
When you advocate for mental-health parity (and we hope you will), use this 
factoid: A study of health parity for federal workers found that it increased 
employer costs by less than 0.5 percent.

122
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
 
To find out about your specific mental-health benefits and coverage, check 
with either the human resources office of your employer, a union official if 
you belong to a union, or directly with your insurer. If your health plan is only 
subject to federal law (for example, if you’re a federal employee), you can get 
more information from the Department of Labor by calling 866-275-7922.
If you feel that you or your loved one has been unfairly denied coverage 
under the terms of the insurer’s contract, contact the customer service 
department of your insurer (preferably, in writing so you have a paper trail 
to document your efforts). If the insurer is still unresponsive, you can file 
an appeal with your state insurance commissioner. If you still get no help, 
contact your state and federal legislators, your state attorney general, or a 
private attorney or legal advocate.
 
Don’t be completely discouraged by the costs of private mental healthcare. 
Whether your loved one has comprehensive insurance or not, there are 
usually ways to obtain the care she needs. You may be able to negotiate 
payments with a doctor or program so you can afford it. Even if they aren’t 
advertised or mentioned, always inquire about sliding-fee scales or reduced 
fees. Don’t be shy — it never hurts to ask!
Although a small proportion of people pay for their own insurance, health 
insurance is often unaffordable except through employer-paid coverage. 
Premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance have increased four 
times faster than employee earnings since 2000. At a time when health-
insurance costs are rapidly escalating and the number of uninsured is 
growing, this means that many individuals and families are being priced 
out of necessary mental-health treatment.
Employee assistance programs (EAPs) can be a valuable resource for people 
who are employed. These workplace benefit programs, which are often free, 
provide confidential evaluation, treatment, and referral for individuals who 
may have personal, mental-health, financial, legal, or substance-abuse 
problems that might otherwise adversely affect their employment. EAPs are 
often limited in terms of the number of sessions made available to the 
employee, however. Check with your employer to find out whether you have 
an EAP and how to take advantage of it.
Public services for the uninsured 
or underinsured
Many publicly funded treatment and support programs operate on a sliding 
scale based on an individual’s ability to pay. These programs are often 
operated directly by local government or funded by contracts or grants 
awarded to private organizations that are designed to serve individuals 
either with limited income or no income at all. They can be supported by 

123
 Chapter 7: Paying for Your Loved One’s Care
local tax levies, state funds, federal block grants (grants that allocate money 
to states on the basis of some formula set by the federal government), or 
some combination thereof.
 
To find out about programs and their respective eligibility requirements, 
contact your city or county mental-health department. The available programs 
may include:
 
 State-supported outpatient treatment programs
 
 Community mental-health centers
 
 Nonprofit mental-health associations
 
 ACT or other case management programs (see Chapter 9)
 
 Self-help or peer-support programs
 
 Psychosocial rehabilitation programs
 
 Family psychoeducation programs
 
 Substance abuse treatment and recovery programs
 
 Clubhouses
 
 Consumer-operated service programs
Often, local affiliates of the National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI) 
provide consumer or family peer support services and are a valuable 
resource for information and referral. To find out more, go to www.nami.
org or call 800-950-6264.
 
When someone receives treatment at a clinic, they may be assigned to see 
whomever is there on the day of their appointment. Try to encourage your 
loved one to request appointments with one clinician who will see him 
regularly and get to know him, helping providing continuity in care. If the 
person is going on vacation, have him ask the clinician to brief whomever 
will be covering on whatever issues are likely to arise.
Veterans’ benefits
If your loved one served on active military duty, he may qualify for health-
care benefits provided by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The 
VHA provides inpatient psychiatric services at 132 medical centers and 
outpatient mental-health services at 689 medical centers and community-
based outpatient clinics. In addition, readjustment counseling services are 
available for veterans and their families at 209 vet centers across the nation. 
To find out about benefits, go to www.va.gov/health or contact the VA 
healthcare benefits office by phone toll-free at 877-222-8387.

124
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
 
The VA also maintains a staffed hot line with suicide prevention and mental-
health professionals. If a veteran is in crisis, he can call the suicide hot line at 
800-273-8255.
Entitlement programs
Because of the high cost of care and difficulties keeping a steady job with 
health benefits, most people with schizophrenia depend on benefits from 
Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare. We cover all three in the following 
sections.
Social Security
Like people with physical disabilities, people with mental illnesses may also 
only be able to work intermittently, be unable to work for a lengthy period of 
time, or be unable to work at all. It’s estimated that about 1 out of 20 people 
receiving Social Security benefits are people with mental disabilities.
There are two types of benefits available through the Social Security 
Administration (SSA):
 
 Supplemental Security Income (SSI) pays benefits to disabled adults 
and children based on financial need. People over the age of 65 who 
meet financial limits do not have to prove a disability.
 
 Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) pays benefits to people who 
have previously worked and paid into the Social Security system. 
An adult may qualify for benefits based on her parents’ earnings if 
her disability started before age 22. Payments average about $900 
per month.
Some people are entitled to both SSI and SSDI if their SSDI income is below a 
certain threshold.
Unfortunately, none of these benefits comes automatically (or easily), and 
there are criteria for determining disability based on four standards:
 
 Earnings
 
 Severity of illness
 
 Type of work
 
 Meeting the criteria on an established checklist
In general, to obtain benefits, an individual has to have a disability that 
interferes with his ability to work (which is expected to last at least one year) 
or who has a very low income. The individual also cannot have assets that 
exceed the limits set by the federal government.

125
 Chapter 7: Paying for Your Loved One’s Care
 
To find out more about Social Security benefits, contact the SSA at 800-772-
1213, go to the SSA Web site (www.ssa.gov), or visit your local SSA office. 
(You can find your local SSA office in the blue pages of your local phone book 
or by going to www.ssa.gov and clicking on Find a Social Security Office.)
SSA offers a Social Security Online Disability Planner at www.ssa.gov/
dibplan/index.htm, which explains the benefits available, how to qualify, 
and how to apply. The application process entails an in-depth interview, 
either in person or on the phone.
 
Some patients and families find it hard to admit that they need help. It’s a 
natural tendency to try to present yourself in a positive light, but when it 
comes to accessing benefits, you and your loved one need to present an 
honest — even if it’s negative — portrayal if you want to qualify. On the 
application, make sure you list every disability that applies to your loved one. 
Carefully read the requirements before applying and make sure your written 
application shows that your loved one meets them.
For example, many individuals with schizophrenia have a co-occurring 
substance-abuse problem. If substance abuse is determined to be your loved 
one’s primary problem, she’ll be turned down for SSI or SSDI because the 
laws were changed in the 1990s so that people cannot receive disability 
payments on the basis of addiction alone. On the other hand, if mental illness 
is considered the primary disorder, your loved one will be eligible for these 
benefits. By denying the primacy of their son or daughter’s mental disorder, 
parents may be inadvertently sabotaging that individual’s chance to receive 
benefits that could support treatment and recovery.
The application process for benefits can be complicated, especially if the 
person applying is unable to respond to questions appropriately or accu-
rately because of the symptoms of her illness. If your loved one is in this 
situation, she may need someone to assist her — a friend, relative, or lawyer, 
for example.
 
Expect to be turned down on your first application; it happens frequently. 
The government apparently looks at the application process as a type of 
weeding-out process, where only the truly needy or deserving who persist 
long enough wind up getting benefits. Initially, two out of three applicants 
are turned down — but upon appeal to an administrative law judge, more than 
two-thirds of those denials are overturned. People are often discouraged 
because it can take many months to process an application for disability, but 
don’t let it dissuade you.
Local governments can provide temporary public assistance (called 
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) during this waiting period in the 
form of healthcare, food stamps, transportation, and rental assistance. If at 
first you don’t succeed, appeal! You may need to find a legal advocate or 
attorney to help you.

126
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
 
If you need assistance filing your claim or making an appeal, there are two 
national groups who maintain lists of people who can assist you:
 
 The National Association of Disability Representatives (NADR): 
800-747-6131 or www.nadr.org
 
 The National Organization of Social Security Claimants’ 
Representatives (NOSSCR): 800-431-2804 or www.nosscr.org
Applying for public benefits can be a tedious and cumbersome process. 
Whenever possible, ask for help from a case manager or social worker. Make 
friends in every office you set foot in; fair or unfair, people will go out of 
their way for people they like. Also, many benefit forms require similar 
information — keep copies of every form you file in one place so you can 
easily retrieve the information the next time you need it.
After your loved one qualifies for SSI, it paves the way for his eligibility for 
other benefits such as Medicaid and food stamps.
Work incentives
People with schizophrenia want more than a paycheck; they look toward 
employment as a path to self-sufficiency. Many people fear, however, that if 
they work, they’ll lose the very benefits that provide a safety net for them 
if they become too sick to work again. Under certain conditions, it’s possible 
for people with mental illnesses to work and still receive monthly payments 
(either SSI or SSDI) as well as Medicaid or Medicare. This is called the work 
incentive program. Further information about work incentives can be found at 
www.ssa.gov/disabilityresearch/wi/generalinfo.htm. You can 
also order publications by calling 800-772-1213.
Another resource on the Web: The Ticket to Work Program (www.your
tickettowork.com) is intended to provide people with disabilities with the 
services they need to land competitive jobs.
Medicaid
Medicaid is a form of health insurance for individuals and families with low 
incomes who are considered “medically needy” and meet other eligibility 
requirements. Although the program is governed by the federal government 
and has some uniform requirements, Medicaid is administered by states so 
the eligibility requirements, services covered, and rates of payment differ 
from one state to the next.
 
Help your loved one get on Medicaid as soon as humanly possible. Get over 
the stigma or shame you may feel about having to rely on public benefits; 
you’ll only be doing your loved one a disservice by procrastinating. Medicaid 
opens the door to an array of services that may not be available from any 
other payer, including private insurers. These include case management, 

127
 Chapter 7: Paying for Your Loved One’s Care
community treatment, and residential treatment services. And remember that 
Medicaid eligibility is based on your loved one’s income, not yours. The 
sooner he’s on Medicaid, the sooner he’ll be able to take advantage of these 
resources.
Unlike SSI or SSDI, which are paid to individuals, Medicaid is paid to the 
practitioner or program providing the services; in some instances, a patient 
co-pay is required.
You can find information about Medicaid at www.cms.hhs.gov/home/
medicaid.asp. For contact information for state Medicaid offices, go 
to www.cms.hhs.gov/home/medicaid.asp. You can also obtain 
state-specific information in person by going to local welfare or medical 
assistance offices in your community.
 
The types of mental-health and rehabilitative services eligible for Medicaid 
reimbursement vary depending on the state Medicaid plan. To find out more 
about services funded by specific states, go to http://mentalhealth.
samhsa.gov/publications/allpubs/sma07%2D4301. The report 
includes a table of the specific services funded by each state.
Medicare
Medicare is the health-insurance portion of Social Security. To qualify 
for Medicare, your loved one must be over the age of 65, disabled, or blind. 
Medicare has hospital insurance (Part A), medical insurance (Part B), and 
prescription-drug coverage (Part D). Similar to SSDI, eligibility is based on 
your loved one’s history of paying Social Security taxes when he worked or 
those paid by her parents or spouse.
To find information about Medicare, go to www.medicare.gov. Also, the 
Center for Medicare Advocacy provides a detailed summary of Medicare 
coverage for mental health services at www.medicareadvocacy.org/
FAQ_MentalHealth.htm.
Some Medicare health plans (like HMOs and PPOs) cover prescription drugs 
as part of the plan. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) 
have made available a Prescription Drug Plan Finder (www.medicare.gov/
MPDPF/home.asp) to find and compare drug plans that meet your personal 
needs, but because Part D is extremely tough to figure out, you may want 
to ask a case manager or other mental-health advocate for advice and 
assistance.
One bit of good news: The newly enacted Medicare Improvements for 
Patients and Providers Act of 2008 lowers co-payments for people with 
mental illnesses. Until now, Medicare beneficiaries had been paying a 
50 percent co-pay for mental-health treatment, including therapy. Over the 
next several years, the co-pay will gradually be lowered to 20 percent, the 
same as beneficiaries pay for primary-care doctor visits.

The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Care has created a worksheet to help 
consumers select the right Medicare drug plan for them. You can find it at 
www.bazelon.org/issues/drugs/drugplandirections.htm.
Coverage under Medicare and Medicaid is very complex. Don’t hesitate to 
contact your local Social Security office to ask for help.
 
The Medicare Rights Center (www.medicarerights.org) can be an 
invaluable resource. The Center provides free counseling services for people 
with Medicare problems and maintains a consumer hot line at 800-333-4114 
to answer questions about choices, the appeals process, or complaints about 
care or treatment.
You can find some additional information on Medicare in Eldercare For 
Dummies, by Rachelle Zukerman, PhD (Wiley).
College mental healthcare
If your loved one has a first break while at college, find out whether a student 
health service fee has been included as part of her tuition. Many colleges 
encourage students to pay for health insurance, and some insist on it, offer-
ing a time-limited health insurance policy, at the time of enrollment and 
each subsequent year, that often includes mental healthcare for uninsured 
students.
Many colleges offer counseling that may not be especially helpful at the time 
of a serious break, but that may be very helpful for a student returning to 
school after treatment who’s stabilized and doing well on medication.
Clinical studies and trials
Clinical studies and trials (see Chapter 10) are another option for obtaining 
high-quality care. In many areas (especially places that have academic 
medical institutions), your loved one may be able to participate in a clinical 
study designed to assess treatments for schizophrenia. Very often, during 
the course of a study, the costs of clinical assessment and tests are free, and 
there is reimbursement for associated travel expenses. In some cases, there’s 
also a small stipend for time spent for longer or more-frequent-than-usual 
evaluations.
The quality of care received during the research is usually quite good. In any 
study, a participant is allowed to withdraw from participation at any time, 
and withdrawal from the study cannot adversely affect their treatment 
afterwards.

129
 Chapter 7: Paying for Your Loved One’s Care
To find out if there are any studies going on where you live, go to www.
clinicaltrials.gov and search by the diagnosis schizophrenia.
 
You and your loved one need to be fully informed about the study and 
possible risks and benefits.
If your loved one is considering enrolling in a clinical trial, discuss the pros 
and cons with the clinician currently responsible for your loved one’s 
psychiatric care or even with your family doctor.
Working with Schizophrenia: 
Your Legal Rights on the Job
When your loved one is diagnosed with a serious and stigmatizing illness, like 
schizophrenia, she may be reluctant to tell her employer or colleagues. In the 
meantime, she may endure various challenges connected with the disease 
and its treatment. Medications may make her drowsy or impair her ability to 
concentrate. She may have self-doubts about her own ability to perform and 
may worry what her supervisor and colleagues will think of her or say. 
Should she tell them about her diagnosis, or should she keep it a secret?
If she missed time at work and was on sick leave, she doesn’t necessarily 
have to tell anyone in her workplace what happened. The decision is hers to 
make. If she has no problem performing her job, she’ll probably be more 
reluctant to reveal the diagnosis. But if she’s having problems returning to 
work, she’s less likely to find support in the workplace and she may find it 
uncomfortable if she provides no explanation for what others may see as 
laziness or inefficiency. Depending on her limitations, she may even risk her 
job by not saying anything.
 
Your loved one needs to find out about her rights under the American with 
Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Depending 
on the type of place where she works, she may or may not be covered by 
these pieces of federal legislation. Interpreting these laws is complicated. You 
or your loved one may need to talk to an attorney.
The Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA, enacted in 1990, makes it unlawful for private employers with 15 or 
more employers, state and local governments, employment agencies, labor 
organizations, and management committees to discriminate in employment 
against a qualified individual with a disability that substantially limits one or 
more life activities.

130

Disability is broadly defined to include neurological symptoms, mental 
disorders, or psychological disorders.
 
The ADA does not apply to discrimination in federal employment, which is 
prohibited under Title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
Under the ADA, an employer cannot discriminate in hiring individuals with 
disabilities who are capable of performing a job. If your loved one is applying 
for a new job, an employer cannot ask him about a disability, nor can he be 
required to take a medical exam before a job offer.
After your loved one has been hired, his employer can’t ask him questions 
about his disability unless they pertain to the functions of the job. And if your 
loved one has a mental disability that substantially limits a major life activity, 
his employer may have responsibilities under the ADA to provide reasonable 
accommodations so he can perform his job. Reasonable accommodations 
may include flex time, leave for outpatient appointments or hospitalization, 
assignment of a supportive supervisor, and more feedback about job 
performance.
Of course, if your loved one doesn’t disclose his disability, it may be more 
difficult for his employer to understand what’s going on and to come up with 
a reasonable accommodation — which may be an argument for your loved 
one telling his employer about his schizophrenia.
 
If your loved one does decide to disclose his schizophrenia to his employer, 
he has several options:
 
 He can merely state that he has a medical condition.
 
 He can say he has a brain or emotional disorder, or a chemical 
imbalance.
 
 He can tell his employer his specific diagnosis.

individual with a disability, go to www.eeoc.gov/facts/ada18.html.

Justice, call 800-541-0301.
The Family and Medical Leave Act
Under The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), an employee covered by 
the act is entitled to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during a 12-month period for 
certain family and medical reasons. Plus, it’s against the law for an employer 
to use a person’s decision to take leave as a factor in firing her or denying 
promotions. To find more information about FMLA, go to www.dol.gov/
esa/whd/fmla.

 Chapter 7: Paying for Your Loved One’s Care
 
Your loved one’s psychiatrist, case manager, or job counselor may be able to 
offer guidance on making some tricky decisions. They can help your loved one 
assess her illness and its possible impact on her work. Another key advisor 
may be the human resources department; they can help advise your loved one 
about the employer’s sick leave policies and whether she has options such as 
part-time or flex-time employment.
In a supportive work setting, disclosing as much as your loved one feels 
comfortable disclosing to her supervisor and colleagues can help her better 
meet the demands of her job. Also, if an emergency occurs, the employer 
will be in a position to respond appropriately. But it’s always prudent to be 
selective in whom you tell, what you say, and when you say it. Your loved 
one will have to trust her instincts, and the advice of others when it comes to 
deciding whether or not to disclose schizophrenia to an employer.
 
If your loved one tells her employer, she should remind them that any health 
information she provides is confidential.
Planning for Your Loved One’s 
Care after You’re Gone
If you’re caring for someone with schizophrenia, you may worry about what 
will happen to her if you die or can no longer take care of him. Planning for 
the future is fraught with emotional and logistical complexities.
The goal of future-care planning is to minimize current stress, concern, and 
worry for caregivers and to minimize disruption and problems for their 
loved ones in the future. Families generally want to provide their loved one 
with as much independence as possible and with sufficient resources, within 
realistic limits.
Some of the issues that you may need to plan for include the following:
 
 Where will your loved one live?
 
 Who will bear financial responsibility for his care?
 
 What types of insurance will be in place?
 
 Who will make treatment decisions if your loved one is unable to make 
them on his own?
 
 How will healthcare emergencies be handled and by whom?
 
 Who will oversee or help manage your loved one’s financial and legal 
affairs? Will she need someone to handle her entitlements (known as a 
representative payee)?

132
Part II: Finding Out What’s Wrong and Getting Help 
Everyone involved needs to be in on the planning and decisions necessary to 
identify and resolve all the issues related to future care:
 
 Your loved one should have a large say in his own future.
 
 Caregivers and providers will need to weigh in and help identify whether 
those preferences are realistic and appropriate, and how they can best 
be achieved.
 
 Families often find that they also need to involve lawyers or other pro-
fessionals because planning for the future often involves wills, inheri-
tances, and property issues. Consult with an attorney who specializes in 
estate planning for families with a person with a disability.
 
 For example, under ordinary circumstances a disabled adult cannot 
have assets that exceed $2,000, excluding his home or car. However, 
families can get around this rule if they set up a special needs trust (also 
called a supplemental needs trust). Instead of leaving an inheritance 
directly to a loved one with schizophrenia (or any other disability) and 
potentially jeopardizing her continued eligibility for SSI and Medicaid 
benefits, the law enables you to establish a trust. A trustee named by the 
family is able to hold and manage the inheritance for the person with 
schizophrenia while the person continues to receive SSI and Medicaid.
 
To simplify some of these challenges, NAMI has helped establish a national, 
nonprofit Planned Lifetime Assistance Network comprised of more than 23 
programs in 18 states across the country to serve as a safety net for the future 
and also to help parents who can’t handle the current burden of care on 
their own. At a minimum, each program tries to resolve three key service 
issues for families and their relatives:
 
 The development of a care plan
 
 Identification of resources to support the care plan
 
 A person to carry out the plan

Treating 
Schizophrenia

In this part . . .
H
ere we fill you in on the different types of treatment 
available for schizophrenia. Medication is the main-
stay of schizophrenia treatment, but medications only 
control symptoms and aren’t a cure. Finding the right 
medication with minimal side effects for any individual is 
still a process of informed trial and error. In this part, we 
explain the benefits and common side effects of antipsy-
chotic medications and other drugs used to treat the 
symptoms of schizophrenia. We also describe the range of 
psychosocial and psychological treatments that can 
improve the odds of better treatment outcomes. Despite 
the best doctors and best treatments, some people with 
schizophrenia have symptoms that remain resistant to 
current treatments. Because research provides hope for 
the future, we explain what you need to know about 
research, identify promising new approaches, and provide 
cautions about untested treatments that provide false 
hope.

O
ne of the most important advances in the treatment of schizophrenia 
over the last half-century has been the discovery of antipsychotic 
medications — medications that reduce the troubling symptoms of schizo-
phrenia and give people with schizophrenia the chance to live normal lives. 
Today, medication is considered the mainstay of schizophrenia treatment.
In this chapter, we look at the different types of medications available and 
their common side effects. We also cover the importance of compliance, 
the family’s role in helping ensure that their loved one stays on medications, 
and some of the difficulties you and your psychiatrist may experience in 
finding a medication that works. We also look at other medical therapies 
such as electroshock treatment and review the pros and cons of their use in 
conjunction with medication. (For information on psychosocial and other 
psychological treatments, turn to Chapter 9.)
Antipsychotic Medications
Antipsychotic medications have revolutionized the treatment of mental 
illness, including schizophrenia. In the following sections, we look at how and 
why they work, explain the difference between first- and second-generation 
drugs, and delve into treatment guidelines and what they mean for you. 
(If you’re interested in the history of these medications, check out the nearby 
sidebar, “The first antipsychotic medications,” for more information.)

136
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
Understanding how medications 
work on the brain
In order to understand how antipsychotics work on the brain, you need to 
understand how the brain is organized and how it works. The brain is an 
organ, and all organs of the body can be thought of as having a structure, a 
function, and a resultant action.
The structure of the brain (shown in Figure 8-1) is more complicated than 
most other organs. It has four lobes — the frontal lobe, the parietal lobe, the 
temporal lobe, and the occipital lobe. Within these structures, there is gray 
matter (made up of cells) and white matter (which is more like insulated 
electrical wires).
The first antipsychotic medications
Before the discovery that certain medications 
could effectively reduce the symptoms of 
schizophrenia, most people with schizophrenia 
spent their time locked away from society 
in institutions. Various attempts were 
made to “treat” the disturbing symptoms 
of psychosis — hallucinations, delusions, 
suspiciousness, agitation, and disorganized 
thinking — but no tested treatments existed 
that were proven to be safe and effective.
There were some early efforts to use medica-
tions, along with other therapies, but the medi-
cations used at the time were mainly sedatives. 
And sedatives had to be given in such large 
doses that they were more likely to put people 
to sleep, cause confusion, or make people 
unable to react than they were to tame the 
symptoms associated with the disorder.
Then, in France, in 1952, a new medication, 
chlorpromazine (brand name: Thorazine) was 
developed for an entirely different purpose — 
to reduce the chance of cardiovascular shock 
during surgery. Serendipitously, when the med-
ication was tried in agitated psychotic patients, 
doctors found that it calmed them without caus-
ing the sedation or drowsiness associated with 
sedatives. This was a watershed moment in the 
treatment of schizophrenia. It eventually led to 
the release of patients from institutions, a 
reduction in the number of psychiatric beds 
needed, and a new ability to treat people with 
schizophrenia in less restrictive settings.
Pharmaceutical companies were eager to make 
their own version of this new “tranquilizer,” cli-
nicians were excited that they finally had a 
promising tool in their medicine bags, and 
researchers wanted to find out how the drug 
worked, because they knew it might offer clues 
about what was wrong with the brains of people 
with schizophrenia.

137
 Chapter 8: Medication and Other Medical Approaches
There are some 100 billion cells in the brain, although the actual number 
mainly decreases over the course of a person’s lifetime. Because the cells are 
very close to each other, they can communicate over the very small spaces 
between them; these spaces are called synapses. The way in which the cells 
communicate is both electrical and chemical. If a cell is stimulated, it pro-
duces a very small amount of a chemical, called a neurotransmitter, for a very 
short period of time (literally fractions of a second). This chemical stimulates 
the receptor on the next cell — if that cell has the matching neurotransmitter 
receptors. This chemical stimulation leads to a miniscule increase in electri-
cal voltage inside the cell (brought about by opening of sodium ion channels) 
compared to the cell’s environment.

138
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
Based on how often the cells stimulate one another and their locations in the 
brain, they become organized into circuits. You can think of these circuits as 
“wires” that “connect” one part of the brain to another. Some of the circuits 
are specialized for the senses (such as sight and sound), some are special-
ized for thinking, and some are specialized for different moods. All these 
structures give rise to the function of the brain called the mind, which refers 
to all the conscious and automatic (unconscious) activities of thinking, feel-
ing, sensing, and integrating (or organizing). The resultant action of the mind 
is behavior, what a person does (such as eating, sleeping, loving, and so on).
Through the use of precise electrical, chemical, and imaging techniques, 
scientists now know that medications that affect behavior work, to a large 
extent, by raising or lowering the amount of neurotransmitters (or the sensi-
tivity of the transmitters) found in the different areas of the brain. In this 
way, a medication influences the important cell connections in the brain. 
If a neurotransmitter is involved with thinking, mood, or perception, it can 
affect the symptoms seen in schizophrenia.
Of course, the brain isn’t quite that simple. There are multiple neurotransmit-
ters that can all influence each other and the cells they stimulate. Some of the 
major neurotransmitters are dopamine, glutamine, serotonin, norepineph-
rine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
The earliest antipsychotic medications, which resulted in a tranquilizing 
effect, and all the similar antipsychotic medications that have since been 
developed influence the dopamine system, which is involved with the positive 
symptoms of schizophrenia. (See Chapter 3 for more on positive symptoms.)
Introducing first-generation medications
After the introduction of the first antipsychotic drug, chlorpromazine 
(brand name: Thorazine), in the early 1950s, other pharmaceutical compa-
nies marketed similar medications, which are now collectively referred 
to as first-generation antipsychotics. Table 8-1 identifies the most commonly 
prescribed first-generation antipsychotic medications.
 
First-generation antipsychotics are also sometimes called typical antipsychotics 
or conventional antipsychotics.
All the first-generation medications are equally effective (on average) in con-
trolling the symptoms of schizophrenia. However, for reasons still unknown, 
some people seem to respond better to one antipsychotic medication than 
they do to another.

Among people treated with these first-generation antipsychotic agents, about 
35 percent do not have a good therapeutic response (defined as still having 
positive symptoms after trying two or more different medications for the 
recommended period of time). This condition is referred to as treatment 
resistance and, until about 1990 and the development of second-generation 
medications, few other proven alternatives were available to patients or 
their doctors.
Moving on to a second generation of meds
In 1990, clozapine (brand name: Clozaril), an antipsychotic medication 
marketed outside the United States, proved to be successful in a large clinical 
study that looked at treatment-resistant patients (see the preceding section). 
Remarkably, researchers found that about one out of three previously 
treatment-resistant patients significantly improved after taking clozapine.
However, clozapine had a serious drawback. In about 1 percent of people, 
it caused a marked and sudden decrease in white blood cells — a condition 
that can be fatal. So, in order to prevent this problem, anyone taking clozap-
ine had to have weekly white blood cell counts before their prescriptions 
could be renewed. After some time, the blood draw could be reduced to 
every two weeks, and then monthly. As you can probably predict, many 
potential users of clozapine weren’t happy with the idea of having to get 
their blood drawn so often, just to stay on this medication.

140
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
After clozapine was marketed in the United States, other pharmaceutical 
companies rushed to develop medications that would be as effective as 
clozapine without the effect of decreasing the white blood cell count. In 
1994, risperidone (brand name: Risperdal) was the first of a new group of 
antipsychotic medications to hit the market. Collectively, these new antipsy-
chotics are referred to as second-generation antipsychotics. Table 8-2 lists the 
most commonly prescribed second-generation antipsychotic medications.
 
Second-generation antipsychotic medications are also sometimes called novel 
antipsychotics or atypical antipsychotics.

Unfortunately, other second-generation medications haven’t proven to be 
as effective as clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but they offer 
one important advantage over first-generation antipsychotics: They’re far 
less likely to cause adverse motor side effects (such as stiffness, tremors, or 
Parkinsonian-like abnormal involuntary movements).
In part, as a result of the aggressive marketing of these new medications, 
they’re now much more widely prescribed than first-generation 
antipsychotics in spite of their significantly higher costs.
Following treatment guidelines
Given the large number of antipsychotic medications available, it’s not sur-
prising that a variety of professional associations and government agencies 
have published treatment guidelines (also called practice guidelines).

141
 Chapter 8: Medication and Other Medical Approaches
Treatment guidelines provide recommendations, either based on research 
or expert consensus, to guide practitioners on how to assess and treat 
various psychiatric disorders. Although these guidelines differ in detail, 
they consistently recommend the following for antipsychotic treatment of 
schizophrenia:
 
1. Start with a single antipsychotic medication (usually a second-
generation medication), and evaluate the efficacy of that medication 
in four to six weeks.
 
2. If the first medication has not reduced the patient’s symptoms, try 
another antipsychotic medication — either first- or second-generation.
 
3. If there still is no good response to treatment, try clozapine (brand 
name: Clozaril).
 
Many guidelines are also written specifically for consumers and their families. 
The federal government maintains an online clearinghouse of these docu-
ments at the National Guideline Clearinghouse (www.guideline.gov). 
Reading through practice guidelines can’t make you a doctor, but it can inform 
you about various treatment decisions your loved one will be making with her 
doctor, and it can help you raise the right questions.
Being the first to receive new drugs
When new medications come to market 
(whether for schizophrenia or any other physi-
cal or mental disorder), it’s not necessarily a 
good idea to be first in line to try them. There 
are several reasons for this:
  The proof for efficacy required by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is only 
that a new medication is more effective 
than a placebo, not more effective than 
other medications already on the market. A 
placebo is what used to be called a sugar 
pill — it looks just like the real thing, but it 
doesn’t have any medication in it. So, in 
other words, the drug just has to be better 
than nothing.
  Because new medications have, on aver-
age, only been given to about 3,000 people 
before a drug is on the market, it’s not 
uncommon for new and possibly danger-
ous side effects to be discovered only after 
the medication has been given to hundreds 
of thousands of people or for longer 
periods of time than when the drug was 
being studied.
  The new medication almost always 
costs significantly more than the older 
medication, especially if a generic 
(non-brand-name) equivalent of the older 
medication exists.
If your loved one is not doing well and all the 
older medications have been tried and failed, 
you may welcome the opportunity to try a new 
medication. Be sure to ask your psychiatrist if 
the new medication represents a truly new 
approach or is more likely a “me, too” variation 
of an older product. “Me, too” drugs are gener-
ally more expensive (so they’re heavily 
promoted by pharmaceutical manufacturers) 
and tend to have more unknown risks because 
there’s less experience using them on large 
numbers of people.

142
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
Starting on an Antipsychotic Medication
Medication decisions can be complicated and frustrating. Medications for 
schizophrenia may have to be changed, increased, decreased, and tinkered 
with to obtain optimal results. This situation can be frustrating for both 
patients and families, not to mention expensive, if new medications need 
to be bought before the old ones are used up. In this section, we look at the 
different factors that go into finding the right medication for each patient.
Recognizing the reason for trial and error
Deciding on the perfect drug for a particular patient isn’t an easy task. 
Although many studies have been conducted to find the “right drug for the 
right patient,” trial and error is still the only way to find the drug that works 
best with fewest side effects for a given individual. Usually, medication 
decisions are made on the basis of the potential side effects associated with 
different medications (for example, drowsiness, abnormal movements, drop 
in blood pressure, or weight gain), as well as the physical and mental state of 
the patient.
If the patient has ever been treated with an antipsychotic medication before, 
it helps the doctor to know what medications were used, whether they 
were successful in controlling symptoms, and whether they produced any 
uncomfortable side effects. This is where family and friends (or the person 
with schizophrenia) can be extremely helpful in working with the doctor to 
choose an antipsychotic medication.
 
Patients and their families should always keep a summary of the medication 
someone has taken, with the information listed in more detail in Chapter 14, 
so they have it available when it is needed.
Selecting the proper dose
Every FDA-approved medication has a recommended dose, which is the 
result of studies carried out before a drug goes on the market. However, with 
increased experience with the drug (both by your psychiatrist and others), 
the dosage found to be most beneficial may change even though the labeling 
does not.
For example, after risperidone (the first of the second-generation medica-
tions after clozapine) was marketed, it was found that the 8-milligram 
dose was higher than needed in most patients, and 4 to 6 milligrams rather 

143
 Chapter 8: Medication and Other Medical Approaches
than 8 to 16 milligrams became the dosage commonly used. Conversely, with 
other second-generation drugs such as ziprasidone (trade name, Geodon) 
and quetiapine (trade name, Seroquel) the initial doses recommended were 
found to be too low. The point is that sometimes the dose the psychiatrist 
prescribes may be different from what the package insert says is the recom-
mended dose.
 
Finding a doctor who is familiar with the most up-to-date research on dosing, 
and who has experience gleaned from treating a large number or people with 
schizophrenia, is essential to receiving the correct dose of medication for 
your loved one, guided by what it says on the package insert.
The characteristics of the person receiving the medication are another 
important factor that influences dosing. For example, on average, heavier 
people will be prescribed higher doses than lighter people. Older people, 
children, and people with other health problems (heart, liver, or kidney 
problems, for example) will also receive lower doses.
 
Most pharmacies now provide printed information about the medications 
they’re dispensing. It’s a good idea to read this information, especially when a 
new medication is prescribed. The U.S. National Library of Medicine has a 
Web site (http://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov), where you can find consumer-
friendly and trustworthy information about most medications; you can access 
it by entering either the generic or brand name of the drug. Many other sites 
provide information about drugs, but you need to assess the quality of the site 
(see Chapter 10).
Looking toward personalized medicine
A psychiatrist isn’t able to use a crystal ball to 
consistently select the right drug for a patient. 
Instead, psychiatrists have to resort to a regi-
men of trial and error. This is frustrating to 
patients who sometimes say they’re being used 
as human guinea pigs, and it’s also frustrating 
to doctors who want to get it right the first time. 
But it isn’t all that different from treatment for 
many other medical disorders (such as high 
blood pressure, arthritis, and so on).
In both general medicine and psychiatry, there’s 
reason to hope that this may soon change. As 
more knowledge is gained about the human 
genome, it appears that small differences in 
genes may lead to differences in response to 
different medications. As research proceeds, it 
may become possible to analyze a person’s 
individual genome and select the right drug 
from the get-go. This approach has been called 
personalized medicine.

144
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
Choosing the form of medication: Tablets, 
pills, liquids, or injections
The form and route of administration is another decision to be made with 
some medications. Many antipsychotic medications not only come in differ-
ent oral forms, but also may be given by injection in slow-release and rapid-
acting forms.
Swallowing tablets, pills, or liquids
Many medications are taken orally (by mouth), but there can be difficulties 
using oral medications. Some people have a hard time swallowing pills, and 
others avoid taking their medications by only pretending to swallow pills and 
later spitting them out (known as cheeking).
Although tablets and capsules are the most common oral forms for antipsy-
chotic medications, there are also liquid preparations (useful for older 
adults and children), which can be added to some juices or squirted into the 
mouth. There are also quick-dissolving tablets, which when placed under the 
tongue, dissolve and are absorbed quickly; these are useful when people 
have difficulty swallowing or if they’re cheeking the medication.
 
Cheeking sometimes leads to a diagnosis of “treatment-resistant schizophre-
nia” when, in fact, the medication never had a chance to have a therapeutic 
effect. If cheeking is suspected (although it is sometimes very difficult to 
detect), blood samples can be taken to see if medication is, in fact, in the 
person’s system.
Injectable medications
Injection, usually into muscle (either the shoulder or buttocks) is another 
route of administration, but one that is not very popular in the United States. 
Not all first- or second-generation antipsychotics are available in injectable 
form, and there are two very different kinds of injectable medications that 
are given for different purposes: rapid-acting and slow-release (depot).
Rapid-acting forms
A rapid-acting form of injection (such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, 
olanzapine, or zyprasidone) is usually given when a psychotic person is very 
agitated, aggressive, and uncooperative, either at a doctor’s office or in a 
clinic or hospital. Although no one likes injections, the purpose of doing this 
is to rapidly calm the patient so that he will be more cooperative in taking 
oral medication and more amenable to verbal or behavioral therapies.

145
 Chapter 8: Medication and Other Medical Approaches
These injections are not given as a punishment (as is sometime portrayed in 
movies or books); instead, they should be thought of in the same way that 
an injection is given to someone who can’t breathe after a bee sting. It is a 
temporary measure to get a potentially dangerous or out-of-control situation 
under control, and assure the patient’s safety until he’s amenable to other 
treatment.
Slow-release forms
Another type of injectable antipsychotic medication is purposely designed 
as a slow-release form. (These are depot (extended-release) forms of some 
first- and second-generation antipsychotics that can be given by mouth.) The 
advantage of the injections is that they can be taken roughly once or twice a 
month, avoiding the daily medication hassles that often occur when people 
have schizophrenia (see the “Why people refuse to take or stop taking 
medication” section, later in this chapter).
 
Slow-release antipsychotic injections are known as depot medications in the 
medical community. You may hear members of your loved one’s medical team 
refer to the medication by this term.
One distinct advantage to slow-release injections is that if a person taking a 
slow-release antipsychotic starts showing more symptoms, a clinician can 
rule out noncompliance as the cause.
There are two slow-release first-generation antipsychotics available in the 
United States: haloperidol (brand name: Haldol) and fluphenazine (brand 
name: Prolixin). A slow-release form of the second-generation antipsychotic 
risperidone (brand name: Consta) is also available.
 
As of this writing, slow-release forms of olanzapine and a risperidone 
metabolite (paliperidone) are currently under review at the FDA for possible 
marketing.
 
Another advantage to slow-release injections is that if your loved one is not 
doing well, the oral form of the medication can be given (increasing the dose) 
without the person having to take an entirely new medication. Also, when 
someone moves from an inpatient to outpatient setting and it may take some 
time before the person gets appointment see her doctor, a long-acting medica-
tion can smooth the transition until she’s seen.
Deciding on dosing schedules
Some medications are taken only once a day, while others are taken every 
few hours. This is partly based on a medication’s pharmacology (how long its 
effect lasts), sometimes how large a dose needs to be given, and whether the 
treatment is just being started or has been taken for some time.

146
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
Certain antipsychotic medications have a long half-life (the time it takes for 
half the medication to leave the body) and even if they’re given only once 
a day, they can have an effect for a full 24 hours. Others have a shorter 
half-life and must be given two or more times a day to have their continued 
desired effect.
 
The measure half-life is used because it allows a comparison of the duration of 
effect (action) of similar medications and, therefore, how often during the day 
the medication has to be taken.
 
Obviously, if a person with schizophrenia objects to taking medication or is 
forgetful, or if no one is around to be sure he takes his medication, a medica-
tion with a longer half-life is better. If this situation applies to your loved one, 
you may want to raise the issue with his doctor.
 
Missing a single dose of a medication given only once a day is more significant 
than missing a single dose of a medication given several times a day. Making 
up for missed doses of medication by giving a larger amount at the next dose 
is usually not possible — in fact, doing so can actually cause an overdose. If 
your loved one misses a dose, continue with the next regular dose, and don’t 
try to make up for missed doses.
Very often, when medication is first started, it will be prescribed in smaller 
doses several times a day. Then, as blood levels build up and if there are no 
serious adverse effects (such as drowsiness, dizziness, fainting, and so on), 
the frequency of administration can be reduced. Usually the dose to be given 
once a day is increased and is preferably taken just before bedtime.
 
Tying the time of administration to a daily activity (especially waking up in the 
morning or before going to bed in the evening) is helpful as a reminder to take 
medication. It’s also helpful (and sometimes necessary) to take the medication 
at the same time(s) every day so blood levels never get too high or too low.
 
Some medications need to be taken with food in order to be fully absorbed; 
others need to be taken on an empty stomach. In addition, some medications 
need to be taken alone — taking them with other pills at the same time could 
reduce the effectiveness of the drugs. Be sure your loved one follows the 
doctor’s instructions on how to take medications. If you and your loved one 
aren’t sure, ask. When and how someone takes medication can make a big 
difference.
Managing Medication Adjustments
Taking antipsychotic medications often isn’t as straightforward for 
people with schizophrenia as it is for someone with a physical condition. 

147
 Chapter 8: Medication and Other Medical Approaches
Medications may need to be changed, doses may need adjusting, and 
keeping a list of when to take multiple medications can be daunting for 
anyone, especially a patient struggling with mental-health issues.
There are some general rules for managing a regimen of antipsychotic 
medications, however, that apply in most cases. After your loved one starts 
on medication, it’s important that she does the following:
 
 Take it as prescribed — the correct number of pills or capsules, the 
prescribed number of times per day, and with the prescribed time 
intervals in between. For example, a medicine taken twice a day usually 
should be taken 12 hours apart unless the doctor gives other directions 
(for example, take with meals).
 
 Tell the psychiatrist how she’s been doing since the last time she was 
seen. Are her symptoms better, the same, or worse?
 
 Tell the psychiatrist if she’s having any new or different symptoms or 
health problems. These may be related to the medication, and the 
doctor will want to make that determination.
Switching and adding medications
Even when your loved one follows doctor’s orders and does everything he’s 
supposed to do, the first medication he takes may not work right away. Let’s 
say he’s been taking a prescribed medication for four to six weeks and the 
symptoms that brought him to the doctor aren’t that much better or some 
others symptoms (possibly related to the medication) are giving him prob-
lems. It’s possible that the medication may not be the right one for him. In 
that case, your loved one, his doctor, and you have a variety of alternatives 
to choose from in terms of deciding on the next steps. These include
 
 Raising or lowering the dose of the current medication
 
 Switching to another medication
 
 Adding another medication from a different class of drugs (discussed 
later in this chapter)
 
 Adding another medication from the same class of drugs
 
Good reasons for switching include:
 
 When the symptoms for which the medicine was prescribed don’t 
improve or even get worse
 
 When the medication is giving your loved one other symptoms (for 
example, drowsiness, sleeplessness, weight gain, or dizziness) that are 
making her life more difficult

148
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
 
 When you or your loved one wants the doctor to consider whether 
another medication may be better for her (either a medication that’s 
more effective or one with fewer side effects)
When everyone has decided that you should make a switch and there’s a 
clear rationale for doing so, the question always arises of how long it’ll take 
and how you’ll know if it was a good idea. Some of the questions you’ll want 
to discuss with the doctor, if you all agree to switch medications, include the 
following:
 
 Are you switching my loved one to a drug for the same indication as 
the one she was taking before, within the same class of drugs?
 
 The term indication is used to identify a diagnosis or symptom that a 
drug is designed to treat. When pharmaceutical manufacturers go to the 
FDA, they provide evidence of the safety and effectiveness of a drug for 
a specific indication. When a drug is used for indications other than the 
one or ones for which it was approved, a practice that is legal, the use is 
considered off-label.
 
 Will you be adding a new medication to her older one — but for the 
same indication?
 
 How is the switch going to be made? Will it be abrupt or will there be a 
gradual reduction of the original medication as the new one is gradually 
increased?
 
 Are there any side effects we should be aware of or report to you if 
they occur?
 
 When and how (in person, by phone) should we talk again?
 
 When medications are being changed, doctors will generally want to 
see patients more often or communicate with them by phone. If this 
isn’t arranged, be assertive and ask for an appointment if you have any 
concerns.
For a real-life story about a patient who switched medications several times 
before landing on the right combination, check out the “Brett’s story” sidebar 
in this chapter. Note: At one point when Brett was switching medications, 
his doctor recommended hospitalization so that he could be monitored more 
closely. It’s worth pointing out that most switching of medications only 
rarely requires a move to an inpatient setting. Various factors — medical, 
psychiatric, and logistical — are used to determine whether hospitalization 
is necessary.

149
 Chapter 8: Medication and Other Medical Approaches
Combining medications
People with schizophrenia (or any other chronic condition for that matter) 
very commonly take multiple medications. There are different reasons why 
multiple medications are prescribed, but when two medications from the 
same treatment class (in this situation, antipsychotics) are given together, 
this is called co-prescribing or polypharmacy. It’s important for patients and 
their families to understand the basics of polypharmacy.
The most common situations in which antipsychotic polypharmacy make 
sense include the following:
 
 When schizophrenia is treatment-resistant, or doesn’t respond to the 
usual antipsychotic therapy
 
 When some of the symptoms of schizophrenia respond to treatment but 
others do not
 
 When there are significant side effects that make it impossible for the 
person to take a higher dose but where a higher dose is needed to 
control some symptoms of the disorder
 
Distinguishing between rational polypharmacy and irrational polypharmacy 
is important. Although polypharmacy has gotten a bad rap, if done for the 
right reasons and carried out in a logical way, it can be beneficial (refer to the 
nearby sidebar, “Brett’s story,” for an example). Logically enough, this is 
called rational polypharmacy.
An example of irrational polypharmacy would be a doctor concurrently 
starting a person with schizophrenia on two different antipsychotic medica-
tions at the same time, without trying one alone and with no prior history 
suggesting that this practice would be safe and beneficial to the person.
 
If a psychiatrist starts two medications at the same time, it is impossible to 
determine which one is causing problems or desired effects.
Another problem may occur if a second medication is added without fully 
stopping the first (called an incomplete taper). In this case, if the person 
improves, it may be believed that it is the “combination” that is working 
when, in fact, it may just be the second medication, and using one medication 
would be just as effective, less likely to cause side effects, and considerably 
less expensive!

150
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
Brett’s story
Brett’s treatment experience provides an exam-
ple of how and why rational polypharmacy 
takes place. A 20-year-old honors student and 
standout athlete, Brett had never experienced 
any psychiatric symptoms before. During his 
junior year, he started hearing threatening 
voices and believed that he was being 
followed by aliens. He bought a gun to “protect 
himself.”
Brett became so fearful that he started placing 
phone calls to the police asking them for pro-
tection. His fraternity brothers were worried 
about him and got him to see the psychiatrist on 
campus, who diagnosed Brett with schizo-
phreniform disorder (because his symptoms 
were of less than six months’ duration — see 
Chapter 4). Brett was hospitalized on the psy-
chiatric ward and treated with a second-gener-
ation antipsychotic agent, olanzapine (brand 
name: Zyprexa).
Within two weeks, the voices stopped, and 
Brett no longer felt threatened by aliens. He 
was discharged from the hospital to outpatient 
care and continued to take his antipsychotic. 
He seemed to be doing well — except he gained 
about 25 pounds over a relatively short period of 
time, and he was having trouble concentrating 
on his studies.
As midterms approached, both Brett and his 
psychiatrist noticed that his symptoms were 
worsening. He couldn’t sleep, couldn’t study, 
and started feeling like someone was messing 
with his mind. The psychiatrist and Brett both 
thought that the stress of midterms was too 
great and, after a meeting among Brett, his par-
ents, and the doctor, everyone agreed that the 
most prudent thing would be for Brett to take a 
temporary leave of absence from school and 
return home.
With the reduced stress at home, Brett felt 
better — his sleep improved, and he no longer 
had thoughts of anyone controlling his mind. 
However, his weight continued to increase and 
within a month, he gained another 15 pounds. 
He was also becoming more sluggish.
When Brett started to think about returning to 
school the next semester, he began to have 
doubts. His memory wasn’t as good as it used to 
be, and he was very self-conscious about his 
weight gain. He didn’t know how his fraternity 
brothers would react to him. His thoughts about 
aliens began to crop up again.
His psychiatrist didn’t want to increase his 
dosage, because of the substantial weight gain 
it had caused in the past. Instead, he suggested 
switching to another second-generation medi-
cine that was less likely to exacerbate the prob-
lem. The dose of olanzapine was reduced as the 
new medication, ziprasidone (brand name: 
Geodon), was increased, until the olanzapine 
was stopped entirely. Brett’s weight dropped, 
but he became increasingly suspicious and 
reported that the voices were commanding him 
to protect the human race from danger.
The psychiatrist tried Brett on another second-
generation antipsychotic, aripiprazole (brand 
name: Abilify). Although Brett did not gain 
weight on aripiprazole, the voices and delusions 
became so severe that the psychiatrist 
suggested another voluntary hospitalization 
to adjust the medication in a safe and secure 
setting where he could be observed medically. 
The psychiatrist gradually stopped the aripipra-
zole and gradually restarted olanzapine but at a 
lower dose than before. When Brett started 
to improve, the psychiatrist didn’t raise his olan-
zapine dose any further (to avoid any additional 
weight gain), but he added a first-generation 
antipsychotic, haloperidol (brand name: Haldol) 
in a small dose because it’s known to be good 
for controlling hallucinations and delusions and 
doesn’t cause significant weight gain.
On this regimen of antipsychotic polypharmacy, 
Brett continued to improve so that he was 
well enough to return to school the following 
semester.

 Chapter 8: Medication and Other Medical Approaches
Coping with Common Side Effects
In order to be effective, a medication interacts with body systems to bring 
about therapeutic (desired) effects. Because medications rarely have an effect 
on just one single biological system in the body, along with the therapeutic 
effect comes other unwanted or side effects.
When these side effects are undesirable, they’re called adverse effects. 
Adverse effects can be mild or severe, and from a medical point of view 
they’re either not serious or serious (for example, requiring hospitalization 
or causing lasting disability). Regardless of whether a side effect is serious 
from a medical point of view, and regardless of the reason your loved one is 
taking a medication, no one likes to put up with annoying side effects — 
these side effects are often one of the reasons for noncompliance (see “Why 
people refuse to take or stop taking medication,” later in this chapter).
Some side effects only become a problem when the person has another 
physical or mental disorder. For example, a medication can cause urinary 
blockage in a man who has an enlarged prostate, but the same drug poses 
no problem in a woman or a young man with a normal prostate. Such side 
effects are more of an unknown when a drug is brand new and is less likely 
to have been used by a large number of people.
Side effects vary from medication to medication. The most common side 
effects are usually mild, not serious, and transient — but they can still be 
annoying enough to discourage people with schizophrenia from continuing 
to take the medication. Because every individual is biologically unique, 
people vary widely in the side effects that affect them and how bothersome 
they feel (regardless of whether the side effects are medically serious).
Even side effects that are not medically serious (for example, dry mouth, 
blurred vision, drowsiness, or drooling) can lead to noncompliance with 
medication regimens and should be taken seriously by everyone involved 
in a patient’s care.
 
When your doctor prescribes an antipsychotic medication, he should tell your 
loved one what side effects she may experience and which of them are serious 
enough that she should call or visit the doctor if they occur. Your loved one 
should tell the doctor about all new or worsening physical symptoms she’s 
experiencing because they could be medication-related.
Three kinds of side effects associated with antipsychotic medications are 
serious enough to have a doctor consider a change in treatment: movement 
disorders, weight gain, and metabolic problems. These side effects vary 
widely between first- and second-generation antipsychotics and among the 
different medications within these two different generations.

152
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
 
Antipsychotic medications are potent and effective treatments for schizophre-
nia. It may take some time to find the right drug(s) at the right dose(s). Careful 
vigilance, monitoring, and management to reduce side effects are essential to 
improve compliance and maximize medication effectiveness.
Movement disorders
Movement disorders occur as a side effect especially of first-generation 
antipsychotic medications — most often those that are called high-potency 
drugs (drugs that are very strong in small doses) or drugs that are given in 
high doses.
Among the most commonly used first-generation antipsychotics, haloperidol 
(brand name: Haldol) and fluphenazine (brand name: Prolixin) are two that 
often give rise to these side effects. The side effects are caused by the drugs 
interfering with the central nervous system structures in the brain that play 
a role in controlling motor functions.
Sometimes the side effects come on suddenly at the beginning of treatment 
and cause the patient to feel jittery and unable to stay still. This condition is 
called akathisia. Although it can be extremely frightening, it usually can be 
controlled rather quickly by reducing the dose or adding a counteracting 
medication. Other dramatic motor symptoms (such as back stiffness, the 
eyes rolling up in the head, or the neck turning to one side), called dystonias, 
can occur when medication is first started.
 
Although these symptoms usually aren’t life-threatening, they should be 
attended to immediately because they’re uncomfortable and frightening. 
No person should have to put up with these controllable side effects.
With continued treatment, some people develop a group of symptoms 
termed pseudoparkinsonian symptoms, because they look like, but aren’t 
really due to Parkinson’s disease. These symptoms include tremors (fre-
quently of the fingers, but sometimes of the tongue and/or head); stiffness of 
the body, face, and limbs; and difficulty initiating movements. Again, dose 
reduction or the use of counteracting medications, called antiparkinsonian 
agents — such as benztropine (brand name: Cogentin) or diphenhydramine 
hydrochloride (brand name: Benadryl) — is usually very helpful.
After prolonged use of a medication, some patients may develop a neurologic 
syndrome called tardive dyskinesia (meaning, late occurring abnormal move-
ments). If not diagnosed early, this condition can become chronic and occa-
sionally is irreversible. With this syndrome, arms, legs, mouth, tongue, and 
even the body trunk may begin to move slowly and uncontrollably causing 

153
 Chapter 8: Medication and Other Medical Approaches
abnormal involuntary movements. Usually the person with the disorder is 
not particularly troubled by it, but it’s very noticeable to others. Needless to 
say, this condition can be very stigmatizing to the person with the move-
ments. The first time you notice any sign of these movements, report them 
immediately to your loved one’s clinician, who will likely prescribe another 
medication.
 
Although tardive dyskinesia tends to occur in people who have used first-
generation medications, in some rare instances it has been diagnosed in 
people using second-generation medications. It is not clear whether this is due 
to their having used first-generation medications in the past. Elderly people, 
women, and people with mood symptoms are more likely to develop tardive 
dyskinesia.
Weight gain
Although not immediately recognized as a problem when second-generation 
antipsychotic medications first came into use, weight gain has turned out to 
be a significant adverse side effect, especially for some of these medications. 
In particular, clozapine (brand name: Clozaril) and olanzapine (brand name: 
Zyprexa) have been associated with rapid and profound weight gain in many 
patients taking these medications.
Before weight gain was recognized as a problem, patients weren’t advised to 
monitor their diets or encouraged to exercise. Doctors also made no attempt 
to switch drugs or avoid other medications that also may cause weight gain, 
compounding the problem. Many patients gained significant amounts of 
weight on these medications, which put them at risk for cardiac and other 
physical problems.
Today if weight gain starts to be a problem and is recognized, patients can 
be tried on other second-generation antipsychotic drugs that are less likely 
to cause weight gain (such as ziprasidone or aripiprazole). If a medication 
is working particularly well and your doctor doesn’t want to change medica-
tions, she may prescribe medication to counteract weight gain instead of 
changing medications.
 
When families aren’t aware of the properties of these medications, they simply 
blame the weight gain on the person’s eating habits (for example, too much 
junk food) or lack of exercise, which creates conflicts between patients and 
families. Watching a relative become free of positive symptoms but gain so 
much weight that his physical health and appearance are severely compro-
mised is very painful. Worsening this problem, negative symptoms can 
interfere with a person’s motivation to exercise or take care of himself.

154
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
You may want to suggest to your loved one that he get help for what’s a 
very difficult problem to solve on his own. Suggest that your loved one 
discuss his weight problem openly with his psychiatrist and internist, and 
perhaps a nutritionist. By adjusting your loved one’s medications, they may 
be able to make weight loss easier (although there is no magic bullet for 
weight loss, and he’ll still need to watch his diet and get regular exercise). 
You may want to suggest that the person join a health club or take part in 
an exercise program at a mental-health program.
Try to be as supportive as possible in a situation that’s largely not under 
your loved one’s control. Don’t inadvertently sabotage your loved one’s 
efforts at treating his illness or controlling his weight.
Metabolic problems
Along with the problem of weight gain, doctors noticed that some people 
on antipsychotic medications developed elevated blood sugar, which led 
to a diagnosis of Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes. Occasionally, 
this came on suddenly, and the patients had such severe problems with 
sugar metabolism that they had to be hospitalized due to a life-threatening 
metabolic situation.
Much more frequent has been the need to medically treat the diabetes with 
either oral antidiabetic drugs or with insulin, and to develop strategies to 
manage diet and exercise. In fact, wellness and fitness approaches have 
become much more frequent in the care of people with long-standing schizo-
phrenia. These programs are offered by many psychosocial rehabilitation 
programs in the community.
 
It’s vital for doctors and families to encourage regular health checkups for 
people with schizophrenia. Be sure that the physician caring for a person with 
the disorder is aware of the potential physical health problems associated 
with the use of these medications. Be sure that your loved one follows up 
with periodic laboratory tests as recommended by her psychiatrist or other 
physician.
 
Although they’re hard to find, some physicians specialize in the medical 
care of people with psychiatric illnesses. You might ask your loved one’s 
psychiatrist to recommend an internist who is experienced working with 
people with schizophrenia.
Frequently associated with the sugar metabolism problem has been another 
dietary metabolic problem, namely lipid (fat) metabolism of the type seen 
with coronary artery disease. When elevated cholesterol and triglyceride 
levels occur, they can be treated with statin drugs (such as Lipitor) as well 
as with diet and exercise.

155
 Chapter 8: Medication and Other Medical Approaches
Other side effects
Other medication-induced problems can also occur. Most first-generation 
and some second-generation antipsychotic agents (including risperidone) 
cause a rise in the hormone prolactin. In some males, high prolactin levels 
can cause enlarged breasts (which can prove quite embarrassing, especially 
in adolescents and young adults) and may also be implicated in irregular 
or missed periods in females. Small hormone-producing but benign (not 
cancerous) pituitary tumors have also been associated with first-generation 
antipsychotic medications.
 
Finally, a life-threatening (but fortunately, very rare) side effect known as 
neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), characterized by high fever, confu-
sion and hypotension (low blood pressure), is a real medical emergency that 
must be treated immediately — otherwise, the patient may die. Patients and 
their families should be alerted to the remote possibility of NMS by their 
doctors and immediately call the psychiatrist (who may well suggest that the 
person with schizophrenia go to an emergency room right away).
Other Classes of Medications 
Used to Treat Symptoms
Although schizophrenia is most commonly associated with symptoms such 
as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking, symptoms such as 
depression, anxiety, or sleep disorders also can occur during the course of 
this chronic illness.
Different classes of drugs are used as additional treatments: Mood symptoms 
often require antidepressants or mood stabilizers to control them, while 
problems with anxiety, nervousness, and sleep problems can be treated 
(usually for short periods of time) with anti-anxiety agents or sleeping pills 
(also called hypnotics).
Negative symptoms and cognitive impairments are two other categories of 
symptoms that need to be addressed in treatment, but because there aren’t 
any FDA-approved medications for their treatment, we discuss them in 
Chapter 10, on research.
Antidepressants
Symptoms of depression (such as feeling blue or hopeless, lack of interest in 
people or things, changes in appetite or sleeping patterns) may occur during 

156
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
the course of schizophrenia, but they’re not the primary or most prominent 
symptoms. Nonetheless, they can be quite disabling to the person with the 
disorder and discouraging to loved ones and caregivers as well.
That’s why it’s fairly common for doctors to prescribe antidepressant medi-
cations (such as Elavil or Zoloft) along with antipsychotics to control the 
symptoms of depression. Care must be taken when antidepressants are 
used — the uplifting effects of these drugs can worsen the positive symptoms 
of schizophrenia, particularly when the antidepressant is initially prescribed 
or when the dose is raised.
 
Suicide rates are markedly elevated in people with schizophrenia so identify-
ing and treating depression can be life-saving. Although the person in the 
throes of depression may not believe it, depression is a treatable illness.
Knowing just how much antidepressant is needed can be a bit of a balancing 
act. Providing good feedback to the physician about how your loved one is 
dong (for example, sleeping better or sleeping worse; becoming more or less 
aggressive; becoming more or less interested in news, TV, and the world 
around her) can really help the doctor adjust medication appropriately. 
Depression at times can become so severe that a person feels suicidal. (See 
Chapter 14 for more about the risk of suicide in schizophrenia.)
 
Sometimes when positive symptoms are treated and people with schizophre-
nia have a better grip on reality, the awareness of the very real setbacks and 
losses they have encountered as a result of their illness can lead to depres-
sion. Whenever someone feels depressed, it’s important that he tell his 
clinician and family. However, it’s also important for family members to be 
aware of the possibility of depression, watch for its symptoms, and if it is 
severe, encourage their loved one to tell his doctor.
Mood stabilizers
For some people with schizophrenia, mood symptoms of elation (excessive 
energy and activity) may occur along with, or independent of, symptoms of 
depression. The elation may become edgy (sarcastic and aggressive) and 
border on hypomania (which is characterized by not needing sleep, as well 
as rapid and continuous talking).
If these symptoms occur or cycle with depression, medication known as 
mood stabilizers (medications that are used to even out moods) can be help-
ful. One of the most widely used mood stabilizers is lithium. Although there 
is some question about whether lithium relieves depression, it is a virtual 
godsend in preventing, shortening, and controlling elated or manic behavior.

157
 Chapter 8: Medication and Other Medical Approaches
The dosage of lithium must be monitored carefully (by laboratory testing of 
lithium levels in the blood), because there is a very small difference between 
an effective therapeutic level and one that is toxic. When the levels are 
adjusted, however, the medication can be taken over prolonged periods of 
time with only occasional blood monitoring unless the person develops 
diarrhea, vomiting, or profuse sweating and fluid loss or dehydration. Under 
these circumstances, lithium administration must be suspended and the 
dosage adjusted again.
Besides lithium, other mood stabilizers that are regularly used as anticonvul-
sant drugs are also in common use. These medications are, for the most part, 
being used off label (meaning, they haven’t been approved for the treatment 
of schizophrenia — although several have been approved for the treatment 
of bipolar disorder). The most common mood stabilizers in this class are 
valproate (brand name: Depakote) and lamotrigine (brand name: Lamictil). 
These medications are not without their own side effects (such as weight 
gain or a severe and life-threatening rash called Stevens-Johnson syndrome), 
and they should be used only when there is an established need and when 
prescribed by experienced clinicians.
 
Because of its propensity for weight gain, some patients call Depakote 
“Depa-bloat.” The same cautions we provide earlier pertaining to excessive 
weight gain need to be considered when using this medication as well.
Antianxiety medications
It’s not unusual for people with schizophrenia to feel nervous, jittery, or 
tense. Generally, antipsychotic medications reduce or take the edge off 
these symptoms. In fact, some antipsychotic drugs are used for the treatment 
of anxiety (without schizophrenia). Sometimes however, something more 
specific or potent may need to be used to address these uncomfortable 
symptoms.
The most common class of antianxiety agents are the benzodiazepines (such 
as Librium, Valium, Xanax, and Clonapin), which are prescribed medications. 
However, these medications have a dependence/addiction potential and 
should be used only for short periods of time with good monitoring.
This same class of drugs contains some compounds that are sold and used as 
sleeping pills. Frequently anxiety can be accompanied by the inability to fall 
asleep and, thus, antianxiety benzodiazepines may be given at night to help 
induce sleep. There are, of course, other hypnotic medications (for example, 
Ambien or Lunesta), but it’s better to avoid using too many medications, 
especially when they may produce physical or mental dependence.

158
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
 
Anxiety may sometimes be experienced as a result of akathisia (feelings of 
inner restless) that are a side effect of certain antipsychotic medications 
(especially first-generation ones). The proper treatment is either to reduce the 
dose of antipsychotic medication or to switch to another, perhaps second-
generation, antipsychotic agent. Remember: Using an antianxiety medication 
instead of removing the cause of the anxiety is not the best course of action — 
it’s better to figure out the root cause of the anxiety and solve that problem 
rather than relying on medications.
 
In many people with schizophrenia, one of the first symptoms of worsening 
or relapse is difficulty sleeping. If this is the case, increasing the dose of the 
antipsychotic agent is generally preferable to taking a sleep medication. 
Don’t hesitate to ask a doctor what he thinks is the cause of your loved one’s 
sleeplessness before asking for a prescription for a sleep medication.
Adhering to Medications
Studies show that most people don’t take prescribed medication properly. 
Many families are frustrated by relatives who are unwilling to take medica-
tion at all or who are unwilling or unable to take it consistently. Others find 
that their loved ones go off medication as soon as it begins working and they 
start to feel better. This doesn’t only hold true for psychiatric medications. 
Many other chronic physical illnesses, such as diabetes or hypertension, 
demand long-term compliance (sticking to a prescribed treatment regimen), 
and people aren’t always willing to comply with a doctor’s orders over the 
long haul.
 
Large studies of compliance to all types of medications prove that people 
are less likely to recognize the importance of taking medications for chronic 
conditions like Type 2 diabetes (where compliance rates are estimated at 
only 20 percent) or high cholesterol than they are for disorders that have 
noticeable physical symptoms. Families and doctors need to reinforce the 
importance of taking these medications regularly.
Taking any medication can be a catch-22; almost every medication that works 
has potentially undesirable side effects. The worse the side effects, the less 
likely it is that a person will take the medication prescribed as ordered. But 
when schizophrenia is inadequately or inappropriately treated, the effects on 
a person’s quality of life and that of the people around him can be devastat-
ing. The person is more likely to be hospitalized, abuse alcohol and/or drugs, 
be jailed, or become homeless. With no proper treatment in sight, families 
feel a sense of hopelessness and despair.

159
 Chapter 8: Medication and Other Medical Approaches
Because medications are the most important tool in the psychiatrist’s 
arsenal, doctors need to maintain an open dialogue with reluctant patients 
and their families to fully explain the risks and benefits of these medications. 
Every effort needs to be made to find a medication that’s not only effective, 
but acceptable to the patient and her family.
Why people refuse to take 
or stop taking medication
Although the reasons why people refuse to take or stop taking antibiotics 
or cholesterol-lowering medications are similar to the reasons why they 
don’t adhere to antipsychotic drug regimens, psychiatric symptoms add 
some additional barriers, including uncomfortable side effects, lack of insight 
into the illness, disorganized thinking, the high costs of medication, and 
attitudes toward psychiatric medications. We cover all of these in the 
following sections.
Uncomfortable side effects
Antipsychotic drugs have many side effects, ranging from annoying to poten-
tially serious health concerns. Although the symptoms vary from drug to 
drug, many patients report that antipsychotic drugs make them feel drowsy, 
stiff (sometimes patients report feeling like zombies), confused, unclear, or 
not like themselves. Sometimes symptoms of the illness become confused 
with side effects of the medication.
Many times, these side effects become more tolerable over time, but often 
they’re uncomfortable enough that they cause a person with schizophrenia 
to stop taking her medication before the side effects subside.
Side effects (described in the “Coping with Common Side Effects” section, 
earlier in this chapter) must be viewed as valid concerns that need to be 
addressed to see how they can be prevented or avoided.
Lack of insight into the illness
When schizophrenia first appears, you may be baffled and frustrated by 
the fact that your loved one doesn’t seem to realize that anything is wrong 
with him. One study estimated that approximately half of all individuals with 
schizophrenia and 40 percent of those with bipolar disorder don’t recognize 
their symptoms. The degree of insight a person has can vary over the 
course of the illness but, in most cases, it is most impaired when the disease 
first appears.

160
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
Why insight is so compromised remains an area of controversy. It could 
involve some denial, with the patient unwilling to admit that she’s sick. But 
more likely it’s a deficit in cognition (thinking) in the brain. Regardless of 
the cause, lack of insight often becomes a source of misunderstanding and 
conflict between patients and their relatives. The relatives just wish they 
could shake the person and make her understand. The patient feels like her 
relative is trying to control her behavior (which is true, to some degree, but 
for good reason).
One family member told us a story about her husband who had been ill 
during most of their marriage but refused to take medication for more than 
two decades. He never accepted his diagnosis, even though he was becoming 
progressively more psychotic and dysfunctional — and the couple was at 
the brink of financial ruin. He would substitute aspirin for his prescribed 
medication (saying that all pills looked the same) and often refused to take 
medication at all. Only after multiple hospitalizations, including a ten-month 
inpatient stay, did he come to terms with his illness and his need for 
medication.
Disorganized thinking
When thinking is disorganized, understanding or following any rules or 
regimens — including how and when to take a complex mix of medications — 
is difficult. Drug regimens can be extremely complicated for people with 
schizophrenia, who often need to take multiple pills to effectively control 
different symptoms. Not only does it require remembering which pills to 
take at which times, with or without food, but also which prescription needs 
to be refilled when.
 
Written aids like schedule charts or graphs, or physical aids such as pill 
boxes, which separate pills not only by day of the week but also by time 
of day can be very helpful to those struggling with disordered thinking. Help 
from others in keeping scheduling straight may also be necessary.
High costs of prescription meds
The costs of prescription medication can be financially crushing especially 
for individuals who live on fixed or limited incomes, and those whose health 
insurance doesn’t cover the cost of medications. According to the Kaiser 
Health Foundation, the wholesale prices for the 50 most often prescribed 
brand-name medications increased by nearly 8 percent in 2007. Many of 
the second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics that psychiatrists are likely 
to prescribe either are still under patent or are toward the end of their 
patents, which means they will soon become available in generic form. The 
pharmaceutical industry tries to encourage patients to switch to similar, but 
newer, “me-too” drugs that are higher priced.
If patients are enrolled in Medicaid or Medicare, they may have outpatient 
prescription drug coverage, but state policies differ regarding copayments, 
the number of prescriptions that can be filled, and the specific drugs that 
are covered.

161
 Chapter 8: Medication and Other Medical Approaches
Some patients try to save money by taking pills less often than prescribed, 
or by dividing prescriptions in half to make them last longer. This can make 
treatment seem ineffective and can lead to the doctor “tinkering” with 
medications, when in reality the patient isn’t taking the dose prescribed. 
Chapter 7 provides information about some of the prescription assistance 
programs that help provide support for people on limited incomes.
Attitudes toward psychiatric medications
There’s still a great deal of stigma attached to taking medications for a 
mental disorder as compared to taking them for physical problems. 
Sometimes, patients see taking medication as a constant reminder that 
they have an illness they don’t want to have, so they either won’t start 
medications or suddenly stop. Other times, people go off their medications 
as soon as they feel better, not realizing that stopping the medication will 
result in relapse. Some patients and their families believe that the more 
medication you take, the sicker it means you are — which is simply not true.
It’s a common tendency for patients to feel that they want to try going off 
medication to see if everything will be all right. Usually people are feeling 
good because the medication is working. Many times, doctors want to try 
to reduce dosages or eliminate one or another medication, and this may 
be possible, but it needs to be done under the close supervision of the 
prescribing physician to prevent relapse.
Another common complaint made by patients and families, and mentioned 
earlier in this chapter, is that they’re being used as “guinea pigs” because 
their doctors have to depend on trial and error. To some extent, this is 
true — but patients (and their families) need to understand that medication 
regimens must be individualized for the person, because what works for one 
person may not work for another and what once worked for your loved one 
may not work for him now. This is often hard to accept, because it makes it 
evident the very real limitations of what the medical profession knows and 
doesn’t know about schizophrenia and its treatment.
What you can do to ensure your 
loved one takes his medications
As much as possible, try to get your loved to take her medications at the 
same time each day. Here are some ways she can remember to do that:
 
 Associate taking medication with a daily routine (brushing her teeth or 
eating breakfast, for example) or a visual cue (for example, a kitchen 
counter).
 
 Use a divided pill container to help your loved one keep track of her 
medicines that have already been taken and those that haven’t.

162
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
 
 Make sure that your loved one’s doctor explains — and you and your 
loved one understand — the reason she’s taking each medication and 
the risks of not taking them. If your loved one knows why she’s taking 
the medication, she may be more likely to stay on track.
 
 Ask your loved one’s psychiatrist to minimize the number of daily doses 
whenever practical (remembering that short-acting drugs may require 
more doses).
 
 Don’t let running out of pills serve as an excuse for not taking them. 
Remind your loved one not to wait until the last day to refill a prescrip-
tion; retail pharmacies aren’t required to keep every type of medication 
in stock, so you want to make sure your loved one renews her prescrip-
tions about a week before they’ll run out. If she uses a mail-order 
pharmacy, make allowances for the time it will take for the medications 
to get to her door.
 
People often stop taking their medications because they are experiencing 
annoying side effects. Remind your loved one to report any uncomfortable 
side effects to her doctor before she stops. A change in dose, change in the 
medication, or change in the time they are taken may remedy the problem.
When Medication Doesn’t Seem to Work
There are times when the best attempts at finding a workable medication or 
combination of medications fails. Even after trying several antipsychotic 
medications at different doses, in different combinations, and with various 
other medications alongside — and with use of non-medication treatments 
(such as psychotherapy, peer support, psychosocial rehabilitation, and 
so on) — an individual’s symptoms may remain severe and unresponsive to 
treatment. Even after obtaining a second opinion (see Chapter 5), you and 
the doctor may come to the conclusion that there are no other options 
available at the moment.
In situations like these (which, fortunately, are relatively infrequent), if a 
person is in continued psychic and possibly physical distress either electro-
convulsive therapy (ECT) or other physical treatments (see Chapter 10) 
may be worth trying.
Few treatments have been so misunderstood and vilified as electroconvulsive 
therapy (ECT), commonly referred to as electroshock therapy. Sometimes 
ECT is even confused with the controversial approaches that use powerful 

163
 Chapter 8: Medication and Other Medical Approaches
shocks to modify behavior — they have nothing in common except that they 
both use electrical energy. Although certainly not a first-line treatment for 
schizophrenia, several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ECT 
when used in difficult cases — and even when used as a long-term follow-up 
treatment for treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
ECT is given in a humane and precisely measured way, using general anesthe-
sia and muscle relaxants to avert any pain or physical fractures, which could 
be caused by the seizures that are induced by passing an electrical current 
through the brain. The team (usually comprised of an anesthesiologist, 
psychiatrist, and nursing personnel) that administers ECT should be care-
fully trained and experienced, and should use one of the electronic devices 
that can deliver very programmed amounts and types of electrical current 
waves. Under these circumstances, ECT is generally safe — although, like all 
physical treatments, it can have side effects. The most common side effect of 
ECT is temporary memory loss, which infrequently can be more prolonged.
ECT can be a life-saving treatment for patients with agitation associated with 
schizophrenia that can’t be controlled (called intractable agitation) or with 
treatment-resistant catatonic schizophrenia (see Chapter 4). When a person 
with schizophrenia hasn’t responded to other treatments, ECT can also make 
the difference between a person being hospitalized indefinitely or becoming 
an outpatient.
Before rejecting ECT or a suggested therapy, you and your loved one should 
talk to the doctor about the ins and outs of the procedure. Don’t rely on 
negative media portrayals such as those you may have seen in One Flew over 
the Cuckoo’s Nest as your source of information. Those movies also show 
insulin shock treatment, a procedure that is no longer used.
 
Although no one can say for sure precisely how or why ECT works (which 
is also true for many other treatments in medicine), there is clear clinical 
evidence that is it both safe and effective when given under proper medical 
supervision under the proper circumstances.
Looking back at previous medical therapies
In the past, many treatments that seem 
completely senseless or terribly inhumane in 
hindsight were tried in an effort to control the 
symptoms of schizophrenia. These treatments 
ranged from uncomfortable but harmless 
treatments (such as cold baths) to potentially 
medically dangerous treatments (such as 
injections of insulin to induce low blood sugar 
and coma), as well as permanently damaging 
treatments (such as lobotomies). There is little 
evidence that any of these now-abandoned 
treatments were generally effective, especially 
in treatment-resistant cases.

t would be wonderful if all the symptoms and signs of schizophrenia 
could be whisked away by merely swallowing a pill. Unfortunately, even 
the best medications alone aren’t a cure-all. While medication is essential 
to treat and control acute positive symptoms (see Chapter 8), medication 
alone falls short in helping the person with schizophrenia regain his sense of 
self-worth and his ability to function in society after a first psychotic break 
or a recurrent psychotic episode.
The losses associated with an acute episode of schizophrenia can be 
devastating. Medication — although it can usually help stabilize symptoms 
so life is more “normal” — can’t erase the pain of feeling stigmatized, left 
out, and unable to cope with tasks that seem to come easily to peers, such 
as living independently or holding down a job.
In this chapter, we identify and explain the array of psychosocial treatments, 
therapies, and approaches — beyond medication — that should be available 
as part of a comprehensive system of care for people with schizophrenia. 
These include psychological, rehabilitative, and cognitive therapies, along 
with self-help and family approaches, that lessen positive symptoms, 
improve thinking and social skills, reduce the risk of relapse, and improve 
quality of life.

166
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
Although any one individual may not need or use all these approaches, every 
community should have them available for those who need them.
 
Unfortunately, many psychosocial therapies are not available in every commu-
nity. One of the best ways to get a handle on what exists in your community is 
by asking a case manager or social worker. You or your loved one can also 
contact your state or local mental-health authority (see the appendix) and find 
out about the availability of programs in your geographic area.
 
Because of the complexity of the mental-health service system, many private 
practitioners aren’t likely to know about the full range of psychosocial 
rehabilitation services available in their own communities.
Understanding Psychosocial Therapies
We use the term psychosocial treatments to describe the psychological, 
social, and combined psychosocial approaches (usually used in conjunction 
with medication) that aim to help people improve their current level of 
functioning so it is the best that it can be — so they can feel productive and 
good about themselves (see Chapter 15).
Psychosocial treatments are aimed at:
 
 Lessening the symptoms and impairments caused by the disorder
 
 Helping people better manage their illness, which includes teaching 
them how to:
 
• Recognize and cope with persistent symptoms of the illness 
(such as hearing voices or being unable to concentrate)
 
• Maintain a consistent medication regimen
 
• Monitor and cope with the potential side effects of treatment
 
• Prepare for and prevent (to the extent possible) recurring 
episodes
 
 Helping people achieve social, academic, training, or vocational goals
 
 Helping people learn or relearn practical life skills, such as:
 
• Managing money
 
• Housekeeping
 
• Shopping
 
• Doing laundry

167
 Chapter 9: Psychosocial Approaches
 
• Keeping up with basic hygiene and maintaining their personal 
appearance
 
• Navigating public transportation
 
 Teaching people ways to decrease stress, avoid conflict, and manage 
anger
 
 Helping people reconnect with others
 
 Helping people understand and cope with their diagnosis as they move 
toward recovery (see Chapter 15)
 
Evidence shows that adding psychosocial treatments to medication therapy 
results in better outcomes than either medication alone or psychosocial 
therapy alone. For example, people who are treated with a combination of 
medication, social skills training, and family therapy have only a 5 percent 
chance of relapse, compared to a 40 percent chance of relapse among those 
treated with medications alone (see Figure 9-1).
 
Taking advantage of various psychosocial approaches isn’t a matter of choos-
ing one over another, or using them as substitutes for medication. For the 
practical and optimal treatment of schizophrenia, it’s advantageous to com-
bine medication and psychosocial approaches that enhance once another.

Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
Individualizing a plan for treatment
Each person with schizophrenia has different needs, and the same person 
has different needs at different points in her illness. Treatment planning 
needs to be flexible enough to adapt to these changes. For example, right 
after hospital discharge, your loved one’s major challenges may be to cope 
with positive symptoms — and a combination of cognitive behavioral ther-
apy and family psychoeducation may be very helpful. When those challenges 
are met, your loved one may be ready to prepare for a job and be in a 
position to benefit from social skills training and vocational rehabilitation.
One important purpose of an individualized plan is to identify ways to 
monitor and reduce stress so the person with schizophrenia doesn’t take 
on too much too soon. Typically, schizophrenia occurs at a phase of life 
when people are building their lives and careers, so they may feel a sense 
of urgency to resume school full-time to make up the courses they missed 
When talk was king
Psychotherapy (talk therapy) is what most 
people think of when they picture treatment for 
mental illness: the patient lying on the couch, 
recounting everything she can remember hap-
pening to her since she was an infant or toddler, 
while the psychiatrist sits, stone-faced and 
silent, listening until the patient finally reaches 
some catharsis (emotional cleansing) of feel-
ings and insight into her behavior. About half a 
century ago, before the widespread use of psy-
chopharmacology (medications), psychother-
apy was the prominent, dominant, and almost 
universally accepted treatment for all psychiat-
ric illnesses, including schizophrenia.
Then medications appeared that, at least in 
many people, seemed to work like magic. Talk 
therapy was outdated; the remedy was in the 
tablet. Medications can have near miraculous 
results in reducing psychosis. However, the 
person affected still has to pick up the pieces of 
his life and try to put them back together. This is 
something medication can’t help with. It takes 
another person — or a group of people — 
to help the person with schizophrenia find 
ways to become a functioning member of 
society again.
Today a combined approach is seen as what’s 
needed: keeping psychotic symptoms under 
control with medications, supportive therapy 
that is focused on problem-solving, psychoso-
cial approaches to help the patient regain inde-
pendence, and self-help to enable an individual 
to regain his confidence, sense of self-esteem, 
and hope for the future. When talk therapy is 
used today, it takes a different form: It’s usually 
briefer, more practical and supportive, and 
focused on specific goals.
It’s worth noting, too, that the past half-century 
has seen significant advances in psychological 
therapies. The psychoanalytic theory monopoly 
was broken, and different kinds of therapies 
surfaced. In general, the newer therapies cen-
tered more on practical rehabilitation of the 
individual, in much the same way that someone 
is rehabilitated after a physical injury (such as a 
broken arm or a stroke), instead of trying to 
solve the puzzle of finding the root causes of 
someone’s illness in her history.

169
 Chapter 9: Psychosocial Approaches
or to go back to work before they lose their job or housing. Like medicine, 
psychosocial rehabilitation needs to be sensitively and intelligently dosed 
and monitored.
As with most things in life, timing is everything, and it certainly is an impor-
tant consideration in determining the phasing of treatments for patients with 
schizophrenia. When someone is severely psychotic (with symptoms that 
may include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and agitation), 
it makes no sense to try to teach social skills or to try to decrease denial and 
improve insight with psychotherapy. Likewise, when acute positive symp-
toms are largely controlled and a person with schizophrenia is feeling lonely 
and would like to have a job and a fuller life, it won’t do much good to merely 
adjust one or more medications. Together, the individual, the clinician, and 
the family need to decide on the timing and selection of the correct mix of 
interventions to meet their mutual goals.
 
Schizophrenia is a persistent (chronic) illness that periodically worsens 
(a condition called relapse) and then improves (a condition called remission). 
Thus, the treatment needed varies with the phase of illness, the nature 
of the problems, and the individual’s stage of recovery (see Chapter 15). 
Each person with schizophrenia faces unique difficulties and changing 
circumstances that require different approaches at different times.
Both clinicians and case managers play an important role in coordinating 
the participation of everyone who needs to be involved in the design of an 
individualized plan that assesses your loved one’s needs and helps identify 
resources for its implementation. It doesn’t stop there. The plan needs to be 
modified, as appropriate, over time as circumstances change.
The staff of local psychosocial rehabilitation programs — which are often 
funded by government, the private sector (usually nonprofit), or multiple 
sources of funding — can also take the lead in developing individualized 
plans for consumers that take advantage of the various resources available 
in the community.
After a psychotic break, many patients and their families want to plunge 
right back into normal life and make up for lost time. Others may be so 
devastated by the illness that they’ve lost all hope and think there’s no way 
out. In either situation, a solid psychosocial evaluation and development 
of a comprehensive plan for treatment can help individuals and their families 
control symptoms — and simultaneously identify and set realistic goals for 
treatment and recovery.
Clearly, research shows that combining psychosocial treatments with 
medication improves outcomes compared to medication or other biological 
treatments used alone. One of the limitations of research on psychosocial 
treatments, which is common to treatments in general medicine as well as 
psychiatry, is that scientists still don’t know what approaches work best, for 
which individuals, at various phases of the illness.

170
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
Certainly, we can say that the field has evolved greatly over the past two 
decades with a greater range of approaches being implemented and studied 
in local communities. We’re better able to identify the full range of deficits 
associated with schizophrenia and to evaluate which deficits and skills are 
compromised for a particular individual.
 
The choice of psychosocial treatments should be linked to the individual 
needs of the patient. Not too far in the future, the hope is that we will minimize 
deficits through early recognition and treatment and that people with schizo-
phrenia will be able to take advantage of treatments that are individualized 
and personalized for them.
Understanding what psychosocial 
rehabilitation can do
People with schizophrenia face many challenges after an acute episode has 
subsided and they are psychiatrically stable. Psychosocial rehabilitative 
interventions can be instrumental in providing the tools, training, and experi-
ence people with schizophrenia need to solve problems, manage their illness 
and its treatment, and create and nurture social and vocational skills, with 
coordinated planning by professionals, family members, and consumers.
For example, although antipsychotic medications are essential in bringing 
the acute symptoms of schizophrenia (such as hallucinations and delusions) 
under control — for many, these drugs may not completely eliminate 
symptoms. This means that some people may need to learn how to live 
with persistent voices in their heads, find ways to express themselves more 
coherently, learn how to distinguish between seeing things that are real and 
those that aren’t, and learn how to contend with the real losses they’ve 
endured as a consequence of their illness.
Also, the side effects of taking medications can add a new set of problems. 
The same drugs that provide hope for recovery may leave patients with 
uncomfortable, potentially unhealthy and/or disabling side effects — such as 
dry mouth, drowsiness, weight gain, diabetes, tremors, loss of sexual desire, 
or insomnia — which may then need to be dealt with.
Many people with schizophrenia have lost some or all the roles that define 
them in society. They may no longer have a socially acceptable answer to the 
common question, “What do you do?” Rehabilitative therapies are designed 
to build a bridge between a person being sick (and doing very little) and 
being able to return to homemaking, school, training, employment, or some 
other meaningful activity — activities that are vital to a sense of satisfaction 
and self-worth.

171
 Chapter 9: Psychosocial Approaches
Building or rebuilding vocational/occupational skills
Even when a person with schizophrenia is eager to work, time off for hospi-
talizations or acute episodes at home not only creates holes in a résumé, but 
also can lead to deficits in a person’s skills and job performance. Because the 
onset of the disorder commonly occurs in adolescence or young adulthood, 
the individual may not have had the opportunity to acquire technical or 
other work skills and may have had little or no experience with the rigors of 
maintaining a 9-to-5 job.
A person with schizophrenia can face many vocational challenges:
 
 Not having a driver’s license, not having a car, or having a hard time 
learning the bus route to work.
 
 Not having marketable job skills or training. (One patient we knew had 
learned how to do complex math algorithms in college, which were no 
longer used because the work could be done more quickly by com-
puter.)
 
 Having his education interrupted or halted prematurely in high school 
or college because of the illness.
 
 Having little or no work experience, unexplained gaps in employment, or 
no references.
 
 Not knowing how to go about looking for a job.
 
 Not knowing how to prepare a résumé.
 
 Not being able to interview well because of limited social skills.
 
 Having a hard time adjusting to the rigors of an office or other work-
place setting (for example, getting there on time, punching a time clock, 
working at a sustained pace, following instructions, working a full shift).
 
 Worries about potential loss of Social Security benefits (which are based 
on the inability to hold a competitive job).
 
There are ways to protect benefits during trial work periods (see Chapter 15).
Transitional or supported employment programs are generally time-limited 
efforts to help restore the skills and confidence people need to return to 
productive employment. The beauty of these programs is that the person 
with schizophrenia gets support from the program and from an employer 
who understands the nature of her new employee’s history and/or limitations 
and who has an expressed desire to provide support and help.
Many of these programs employ job developers who work with industry to 
create employment slots for people with disabilities. These may be full-time 
jobs or part-time opportunities that can help people ease their way back 
into the workplace. Sometimes, programs even provide a coach who will 
accompany the individual on-site to train individuals and monitor their work.

172
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
 
Through the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) of the U.S. 
Department of Education, every state receives funds to provide employment-
related services — such as counseling, job training, education, supported 
employment, and so on — to assist individuals with physical or mental 
disabilities. Although waiting lists may be long and the programs aren’t 
specifically geared to people with mental disorders, these resources shouldn’t 
be overlooked because they can provide invaluable support. To find the 
agency in your own state, do an online search for vocational rehabilitation and 
the name of your state.
 
Participation as an unpaid volunteer in the community is another low-
pressure way to ease back into the world of work and give your loved one 
the feeling that she’s able to contribute to others.
Easing the loneliness and social isolation of schizophrenia
One common problem for people with schizophrenia that can be addressed 
through psychosocial therapies is loneliness. It’s a human instinct to want to 
connect with other people, and families and friends experience great pain 
when they witness the isolation of a loved one with schizophrenia. Both the 
disease and the treatment of schizophrenia make it more difficult to make 
and keep friendships.
Being in and out of hospitals, in and out of schools, or in and out of work can 
lead people with schizophrenia to be out of sync or to lose contact with their 
peers. A student may have dropped out of college because of the illness and 
lost contact with roommates and classmates, or a person may have lost his 
job because of the illness and be too embarrassed to reconnect with former 
coworkers or supervisors.
Additionally, the positive and negative symptoms of the disease (see Chapter 
3) itself may make it uncomfortable to be around people. It’s not uncommon 
for people with schizophrenia to:
 
 Hear voices while someone else is to talking to them. This can be 
confusing for them, making it hard to focus on what the other person is 
saying and causing them to be slow in responding.
 
 Feel suspicious, be wary of new people, and inaccurately perceive 
that people they know are thinking or reacting negatively to them.
 
 Be highly distractible because of their inability to focus (due to voices, 
hallucination, depression, or anxiety).
 
 Have no motivation or low energy (because of negative symptoms). 
This can result in the person with schizophrenia having no interest in 
forming or maintaining social ties.
 
 Be too irritable, anxious, or depressed. This makes it uncomfortable for 
them to be around others and for others to be around them

173
 Chapter 9: Psychosocial Approaches
 
 Have low self-esteem because of their diagnosis and its stigma or be 
embarrassed by the side effects of medications (such as significant 
weight gain or tremors).
 
 Act inappropriately because of cognitive and social deficits, which 
cause people to rebuff their efforts or feel frightened of them. For 
example, a person with schizophrenia may stand too close to people, be 
unable to discern what to say or what not to say, ask invasive questions, 
be unresponsive, have an unkempt appearance, or exhibit other odd 
behaviors.
 
 Have a hard time adapting to large-group situations and find them 
stressful.
 
 Feel discomfort and guilt about not knowing who to tell or not to tell 
about their illness. For example, should you tell a date? An old class-
mate? (For more on breaking the news, see Chapter 11.)
Because of these residual symptoms, some people with schizophrenia have 
a hard time being around other people with the same illness (because they 
serve as constant reminders of their own illness), have social anxiety (an out-
of-proportion fear of being evaluated by people around them), or just don’t 
feel like they fit in with other more “normal” people who don’t understand 
their challenges. (On the other end of the spectrum, some people feel more 
comfortable socializing with others who are experiencing and overcoming 
similar challenges; see “Self-help groups,” later in this chapter.)
In either case, even on a practical level (because of the impact of the illness 
on their finances) they may not have the pocket change they need to pay for 
dinners out, going to a movie, public transportation, the supplies needed 
for a hobby (like painting or photography), or the membership fees to join a 
health or fitness club.
Family relationships, especially sibling ones, may be strained because either 
the family hovers over the ill individual too much in an effort to encourage 
the person to be more social or excludes him from family functions to avoid 
discomfort for the individual and everyone else. Cumulatively, all these 
factors leave a person with the illness feeling detached and lonely, which can 
be ameliorated by various psychosocial interventions.
Learning new skills and relearning forgotten ones
Psychosocial skills training is a structured educational approach that usually 
takes place in groups that are focused on specific objectives for a set number 
of sessions. The skills are ones that are relevant to helping a person with 
schizophrenia better function as a member of her community. Training 
may cover:
 
 Activities of daily living
 
 Assertiveness

 Symptom and medication management
 
 Accessing Social Security and other benefits
The training is usually preceded by an evaluation, either one that’s done 
by a trained observer or by self-report (for example, the consumer is asked to 
fill out a questionnaire describing his own limitations). Larger tasks are 
broken down into smaller ones and various behavioral approaches are used 
including role playing, modeling, and positive reinforcement (often in the 
form of food or drink). For example, if someone were learning how to present 
himself for a job interview, the training might focus on how to shake hands, 
how to make eye contact, what to say, what to ask, and how to dress.
Research suggests that skills training improves social skills, assertiveness, 
and readies people to leave hospitals sooner after a prolonged 
hospitalization.
 
For almost three decades, the U.S. government — first through the National 
Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and then through the Center for Mental 
Health Services (CMHS) — jointly with the National Institute on Disability 
and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) of the Department of Education, has 
supported the growth of the Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation at Boston 
University (www.bu.edu/cpr). This national center supports research, 
training, and services that are focused on helping people achieve “a decent 
place to live, suitable work, social activities, and friends to whom they can 
turn in times of crisis.” The Center’s Web site has a wealth of resources 
suitable for consumers, families, and professionals.
The National Research and Training Center on Psychiatric Disability, located 
in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Illinois in Chicago (www.
cmhsrp.uic.edu/nrtc) is a sister center, funded by the same federal 
agencies as the NIDRR. Its Web site offers free online workshops, Webcasts, 
and online continuing education courses.
Centers targeting the needs of children and adolescents with psychiatric 
disability are located at the University of South Florida (http://rtckids.
fmhi.usf.edu) and Portland State University (www.rtc.pdx.edu/
index.php).
 
One of the more successful approaches to psychosocial rehabilitation is 
the assertive community treatment (ACT) program (see Chapter 5). ACT 
programs provide intensive outreach and care to help people live indepen-
dently in their own homes. Trained professionals are available 24/7 to help 
individuals gain the practical skills they may have lost or never learned. 
They also oversee medication, making sure that medical and psychosocial 
care is coordinated for severely ill people in the community.

 Chapter 9: Psychosocial Approaches
Looking at Individual Therapies
Individual therapies are one-on-one approaches with a clinician working 
directly with a client. Three of the most common therapies practiced one-
on-one are psychodynamic therapy, supportive therapy, and cognitive 
behavioral therapy. We cover each of these in the following sections.
Psychodynamic therapy
Although psychodynamic therapy (meeting with a therapist on a regular basis 
over a long period of time to get to the root of a problem) was the dominant 
therapy for the first 50 years of the 20th century — think Woody Allen—
these treatments weren’t scientifically evaluated during their heyday. In 
fact, there’s still no credible evidence that they’re specifically beneficial in 
treating the symptoms or impairments associated with schizophrenia.
One problem is that the cognitive and memory deficits associated with 
schizophrenia can interfere with the ability of the person to benefit from this 
kind of therapy. (In fact, all psychosocial treatments must overcome this 
hurdle to be effective. People with schizophrenia must be able to understand 
and actively participate for any treatment to be helpful.) Thus, psychody-
namic therapy is usually used for people with psychiatric disorders whose 
thinking remains intact.
Supportive therapy
People with schizophrenia, contending with many real-life problems, need 
someone experienced to talk to. Supportive therapy (therapy conducted by 
a professional trained to work with people with serious mental illnesses) is 
an important complement to medication and other psychosocial treatments. 
In these days of managed care, the time allowed for patients and their 
psychiatrists to spend with each other is often rationed by insurers and 
other third-party payers.
Therefore, it is important that your loved one has a trained professional as 
part of his team, with whom he can openly discuss his problems and find 
ways to overcome them. For example, if a person with schizophrenia was 
having problems making friends, the therapist might help her find ways to 
meet people and make the first overture.
Having such a safe, supportive relationship to learn new ways of coping is 
vital to recovery. This can be especially valuable for people who have trouble 
opening up to a group. Even though family and friends may be supportive, 
they aren’t trained for and are usually too emotionally involved to play 
this role.

176
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
Psychologists, social workers, or other counselors who work with people 
with schizophrenia can help them cope with stressors in their lives, 
encourage adherence to treatment, help patients determine other needed 
treatments and supports, and serve in the role of a coach — providing 
encouragement and support. Psychotherapy can also be useful to over-
stressed loved ones who are unable to cope with the impact of the diagnosis 
on their own lives.
Cognitive behavioral therapy
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is usually conducted on a one-on-one 
basis in an outpatient setting, usually by a trained therapist, but it also can 
be practiced in groups. Like any individual therapy, CBT requires close 
collaboration between a patient and therapist. Therefore, it’s important 
to interview the therapist before your loved one starts treatment, to 
make sure your loved one feels comfortable working with that individual 
(see Chapter 5).
 
When selecting a therapist for individual therapy, it’s always prudent to ask 
for referrals from people you trust and to consider the first few sessions 
as an interview to get a good sense of the individual, whether your loved one 
connects with him, and whether it seems like talking with this person will 
be helpful.
CBT was originally developed in the late 1970s for the treatment of people 
with depression and anxiety disorders. At that time, it was the most proven 
psychosocial intervention, and even though it was not originally used for 
treating schizophrenia, there’s now convincing evidence for its effectiveness, 
especially in reducing positive symptoms that remain in spite of adequate 
antipsychotic treatment.
During treatment, the patient describes her symptoms, and those that are 
most troublesome are targeted for attention. The goal is to change thought 
patterns in order to help the patient solve problems. This is sometimes 
called cognitive-restructuring. For example, a patient can be taught ways to 
ignore the voices she’s hearing.
Some of the specific elements of CBT may include:
 
 Belief modification or validity testing: Challenging delusional thinking
 
 Focusing/reattribution: Explaining the meaning of stressors behind 
auditory hallucinations
 
 Normalizing psychotic experiences: Helping the patient see that her 
experiences are responses to stressful events
 
 Cognitive rehearsal: Practicing how to better handle a future situation 
similar to one that was challenging in the past

177
 Chapter 9: Psychosocial Approaches
 
 Journal writing: Keeping notes to encourage insight, learning, and 
self-discovery
In essence, the CBT therapist challenges faulty thinking patterns (such 
as delusions and hallucinations) in an attempt to modify thoughts and 
behaviors. The reductions in positive symptoms seen with CBT continue 
after the course of treatment has been completed.
Unfortunately, CBT doesn’t seem to affect rates of relapse and rehospitaliza-
tion. Some studies report that CBT helps with compliance in taking medica-
tion and, in fact, a specific variant of CBT emphasizes this particular 
behavioral goal. Another limitation to CBT is that it doesn’t seem to improve 
social functioning as well as supportive therapy. Also, because CBT requires 
a level of fairly organized thinking, it’s less useful for individuals who have 
cognitive deficits or who are still acutely psychotic. Nevertheless, for 
persons who have persistent psychotic symptoms even with antipsychotic 
medication, CBT offers another tested and proven method of getting 
symptomatic relief.
Getting Involved in Group Therapies
Group therapies can be led by professionals, consumers, family members, or 
some combination of one or more of them. They may include psychotherapy 
groups or various forms of self-help groups (also called mutual support or 
peer support groups) and family groups.
Group psychotherapy
Psychotherapy groups typically include 6 to 12 patients who meet with one 
or two therapists (who facilitate the discussion). From each other, patients 
learn how to cope with the illness and its symptoms. Group therapy provides 
a perfect forum to meet new people and learn how to get along with others.
For some, group therapy offers a number of advantages over individual 
therapy, including
 
 Opportunities to meet people and improve social skills: This may 
be particularly beneficial to people who are extremely shy or have 
social anxiety.
 
 Lower cost as compared to individual treatments.
 
 Opportunities to provide and obtain peer support: People generally 
feel better about themselves when they’re able to help other people with 
their problems.

178
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
 
Group therapies are generally more appropriate after acute symptoms have 
subsided. They may be particularly difficult for people who still remain 
suspicious and paranoid.
Self-help groups
Self-help groups have a long history. An estimated 2 percent to 3 percent 
of the U.S. population is involved in some form of self-help group at any 
given time. These groups, often led by people with an illness or disorder 
(or by their family members), provide mutual support and practical help to 
others in similar circumstances. These groups are empowering for consum-
ers because it allows them to see their peers as role models and they take 
advantage of what can be learned from people who have experienced an 
illness first-hand.
Self-help groups range from informal gatherings at someone’s kitchen table 
or a local coffee shop to more formal ones run by local organizations or 
national programs. Some of the more well-known self-help groups include 
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). 
Many of these groups are also very effective advocacy organizations because 
of their commitment, tenacity, and credibility to their causes.
 
Because a substantial portion of people with schizophrenia (estimated at 50 
percent over the course of their lifetime) have co-occurring substance use 
disorders, AA programs can potentially play an important role in recovery. 
However, some of these programs, in an effort to help their members remain 
substance free, discourage members from taking their antipsychotic medica-
tions — which can be very risky for someone with schizophrenia. Your loved 
one should be cautious about joining AA if the leader of the group isn’t 
familiar with co-occurring disorders.
 
Some “double-trouble” groups are developed specifically for people with 
co-occurring disorders. Seek one of these out — your loved one can benefit 
from approaches that treat both disorders simultaneously. (See Chapter 
6 for more information on co-occurring disorders.)
Research on self-help for people with schizophrenia suggests that these 
groups increase knowledge about the illness, enhance coping, improve 
vocational involvement, and provide realistic hope for the future. The groups 
can take many forms including consumer-operated mental-health programs 
run by consumers (such as case management, crisis, or peer support 
programs); more informal clubhouse models and drop-in centers; or peer 
support programs, to name just a few. Some of the characteristics these 
programs share in common include
 
 Mentorship (opportunities to interact with positive role models)
 
 The sharing of coping strategies

179
 Chapter 9: Psychosocial Approaches
 
 Support of other people in similar circumstances
 
 Exchange of information and resources
 
 Enhanced self-esteem
 
 Formation of friendships and socialization in low-stress situations
 
 Free or low-cost assistance
 
You can access a searchable database of self-help programs for a variety of 
disorders, including schizophrenia, at www.mentalhelp.net/selfhelp.
In the following sections, we cover some examples of self-help groups, but 
because these programs generally evolve at the local level, they tend to vary 
considerably from community to community, except in the case of several 
national programs Most self-help programs, in fact, are one-of-a-kind efforts 
sparked by recovering individuals who want to give back to their peers.
One example of a national program is Recovery, Inc. (www.recovery-inc.
org), which was one of the first mental health self-help groups. It was 
founded in 1937 and is still alive and growing today. Recovery groups, of 
which there are now more than 700 chapters across the United States, bring 
together people with a variety of diagnosed and undiagnosed mental and 
emotional problems, including schizophrenia. Members meet regularly 
in their local communities (usually in a house of worship although there 
is no association with or discussion of religion) to learn techniques for 
handling the stress and the daily hassles people encounter in their lives. The 
approach is somewhat reminiscent of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
because it focuses on learning to change the thoughts and behaviors caused 
by psychiatric symptoms.
 
In a controlled study of Recovery, leaders and members reported fewer 
symptoms and fewer re-hospitalizations. Other studies of mental-health self-
help groups have found improvement on psychological, interpersonal, and 
community adjustment measures; improved member self-confidence and 
self-esteem; fewer hospitalizations; more hopefulness about the future; and a 
greater sense of well-being.
 
Recovery meetings are intended to augment, not substitute for, psychiatric 
treatment.
Another example of a national model is the NAMI Peer-to-Peer program, 
which consists of nine two-hour courses that are taught by three trained 
mentors, individuals who are living with mental illnesses. To learn more 
about this program and find out whether courses are being given in your 
community, go to www.nami.org, and from the Find Support drop-down list, 
choose Consumer Support. Then click the Peer-to-Peer link. (Or just go to 
www.nami.org/template.cfm?section=Peer-to-Peer.)

Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
 
Because schizophrenia is a brain disorder, society often uses the term patient 
to describe individuals with schizophrenia, as they would refer to anyone with 
a physical disorder. However, there’s considerable controversy in the field of 
mental health about language, because some of it can be very stigmatizing. So 
in this section, we use the word consumer or peer to describe the patient or 
recipient of services.
Grass-roots consumer-run programs include, but aren’t limited to, clubhouse 
models, drop-in centers, case-management programs, outreach programs, 
crisis services, employment and housing programs.
Clubhouse models
Psychosocial clubhouses, whose numbers are growing across the United 
States, provide peer support in an informal setting, and often provide help in 
locating other services. Participants, called members, often share responsibil-
ity with paid staff for the upkeep of the clubhouse. The clubhouses serve as 
training grounds to provide people with schizophrenia with skills they can 
use in the workplace and with the opportunity to forge social bonds. They 
also promote a sense of belonging as one may feel as a member of any other 
type of club. Some, but not all, provide residential care until a person can get 
permanently housed in the community.
The first such clubhouse, Fountain House (www.fountainhouse.org), 
opened in New York City in 1948. Today, the program has served more than 
16,000 members. At Fountain House and many other clubhouses, members 
and staff learn to work together closely to enrich the environment for all 
their members. Thresholds (www.thresholds.org), in Chicago, is another 
well-known example of a clubhouse model.
The International Center for Clubhouse Development (www.iccd.org) has 
identified the defining characteristics of clubhouse programs:
 
 An emphasis on working roles within the clubhouse
 
 Opportunities for returning to competitive employment through 
transitional and independent employment programs
 
 Recreational programming for evenings, weekends, and holidays
 
 Access to community services, benefits, and supports
 
 Outreach efforts when members are absent
 
 Educational opportunities
 
 Access to or provision of housing, which is viewed as a fundamental 
right of all members
 
 Shared decision-making and governance of the clubhouse
The same Web site (www.iccd.org) provides a Clubhouse Directory under 
the About the ICCD tab.

181
 Chapter 9: Psychosocial Approaches
 
One self-help approach that incorporates self-assessment and self-monitoring, 
and is now being used in many states, is the Wellness Recovery Action 
Program (WRAP) developed by Mary Ellen Copeland, PhD (www.mental
healthrecovery.com). It is a self-management program that provides 
consumers with the tools they need to pursue their own wellness — teaching 
them, for example, what to do when they get stressed, how to maintain a 
healthy lifestyle, and how to identify early warning signs of relapse. WRAP is 
unique because its focus is on prevention and recovery as opposed to control 
of symptoms. Several large-scale studies of the program are now ongoing.
Drop-in centers
Funded by county or city mental-health authorities and various other private 
mental-health programs, drop-in groups are informal places for people with 
schizophrenia to meet. People are free to come and go as they please, and 
there generally aren’t any professionals involved in these operations. These 
programs sometimes appeal to consumers who are uncomfortable using 
traditional services.
Drop-in centers (as well as clubhouses) for homeless persons with serious 
mental illness are sometimes called safe havens. These programs are 
voluntary, welcoming, and try to avoid instituting unnecessary rules and 
requirements that would inadvertently discourage their use.
Volunteer programs
A number of programs make use of volunteers (from the community) or 
peers (recovering individuals) to provide supportive friendships, informa-
tion, and assistance to people with serious mental illness, including those 
with schizophrenia. One of the best known of these programs is Compeer, 
Inc. (www.compeer.org), an international nonprofit organization that 
has more than 80 chapters serving more than 65,000 adults and children 
worldwide. Compeer programs offer one-on-one mentoring relationships, 
skill-building, and interim telephone support, all of which are intended as a 
complement to professional treatment.
 
To find out about the drop-in centers, clubhouses, or volunteer programs 
in your own community, contact your local city or county mental-health 
department. The appendix lists national consumer clearinghouses and 
technical assistance centers, funded by the federal government, that can 
help your loved one become involved in self-help programs.
Internet chat rooms and social media
With the growth of Internet chat rooms and new forms of social media, there 
are a multitude of opportunities for individuals with schizophrenia to talk 
with one another and participate as they choose. For example, there are 
more than 47,000 active members on the schizophrenia-focused discussion 
forums at www.schizophrenia.com. There are also groups on Facebook 

182
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
(www.facebook.com) and MySpace (www.myspace.com) that may be 
interesting to people with schizophrenia. For example, the Facebook Mental 
Health Awareness group has more than 5,000 members, many of them 
consumers.
You can think of these sites as the virtual equivalent of a drop-in center. They 
can provide useful information and opportunities for social connections.
 
Several caveats for your loved one with regard to chatting or posting on 
forums on the Internet:
 
 Be careful about revealing your identity or providing personal 
information online.
 
 Make sure your loved one uses good judgment in selecting an appropri-
ate e-mail address and doesn’t reveal his true name or identity.
 
 Remember that these chat rooms are generally unsupervised, and 
people can get nasty in any chat room.
 
 Be skeptical of advice if you know little about its source.
 
 Online chats can complement face-to-face ones, but they shouldn’t be 
used as a substitute.
 
 Be careful what you write on a Facebook or MySpace profile. You never 
know who’ll be reading it or whether it’ll come back to haunt you.
 
Chapter 10 provides additional caveats for evaluating information you find on 
the Internet.
Supporting the Whole Family
The use of family therapies in the treatment of schizophrenia began soon 
after World War II, when the prevailing theory for mental illness was that 
families of people with schizophrenia communicate in disturbed ways. 
(This was the blame-the-family era.) The goal of treatment was to repair the 
family system instead of focusing on the treatment of any one individual, 
even the person with schizophrenia.
Traditional family therapy focused on treating family pathology and dysfunc-
tion rather than providing families with the coping skills to help them 
support their relatives with schizophrenia. The most unfortunate conse-
quence was that families were often viewed as part of the problem rather 
than people whose help and support could be fundamental to recovery 
(see Chapter 2). This often set up a schism between patients, their families, 
and doctors — and it made parents, especially, feel guilty and ashamed.

183
 Chapter 9: Psychosocial Approaches
Now, family therapy is generally focused on helping families better cope by 
helping them understand schizophrenia, improving communication patterns 
among family members, and identifying solutions to help them and their 
loved one’s illness. Because of the strain having a relative with schizophrenia 
can place on a marriage, some families also benefit from couples therapy.
 
Not every person with schizophrenia has a family — and some patients 
refuse to have contact with their families or have alienated them by their 
behaviors. Support can come from many places, and for some individuals, 
friends, roommates, volunteer organizations, and religious organizations 
comprise “family.”
Family psychoeducation
Family psychoeducational groups educate families by giving them the informa-
tion and skills they need to support their relatives’ recovery. The groups 
are led by mental-health professionals or trained group leaders and focus on 
improving patient rather than family outcomes. As the patient improves, the 
family’s quality of life typically improves as well.
 
The groups augment, but do not substitute for treatment, including 
medication.
Although the various models of family psychoeducation share many 
characteristics in common, they differ in several ways:
 
 Participation of one family versus multiple families
 
 Participation of family members exclusively versus family members and 
people with schizophrenia
 
 Varying lengths of duration, ranging from ten weeks to more than five 
years
 
 A focus on different illnesses and different phases of the illnesses
These programs have been shown to reduce relapse among consumers 
and to lower rates of hospitalization. In addition, they lead to increased 
participation in vocational programs and employment, improved family 
satisfaction, and decreased overall costs of care. To increase the number 
of these programs, efforts have been made to integrate them with ACT 
programs (see Chapter 5).
One of the largest psychoeducation programs for families, sponsored by 
NAMI, is called the Family-to-Family Educational Program. When patients 
leave hospitals, the most common scenario is for them to return to their 
families. This makes it essential for families or close friends to understand 

184
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
everything they can about the illness and its treatment. Moreover, the 
families and/or friends need to accept the diagnosis and to have realistic 
expectations for treatment and recovery.
This free, 12-week course for family caregivers of people with severe mental 
illness is taught by trained family volunteers and provides information that 
can help them find the right resources and ask the right questions, ultimately 
leading to better care for their relative and less stress for the rest of the 
family. Every family member should take this course soon after a loved one 
has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.
 
We think it’s useful for as many members of a single family as possible to 
participate in family psychoeducational programs. This gives more people 
the opportunity to understand the disorder and sets the stage for spreading 
caregiving responsibilities among various family members.
Family support organizations
One of the most significant forces for advancing the treatment of schizophre-
nia has been the development of family support organizations, most notably 
the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).
Family support groups generally serve three functions: Mutual support; 
information; and advocacy for improved mental-health services, increased 
funding for mental-health research, and improved public awareness to 
reduce stigma and discrimination.
Founded in 1979, the grassroots organization has affiliates in every state and 
in more than 1,100 local communities across the United States. NAMI state 
and local affiliates sponsor self-help groups for families who meet together 
to better understand mental illness and to better cope with the challenges 
the illness poses for themselves and their relative. Families who once felt 
isolated and helpless now realize that they aren’t alone and can depend on 
one another for support.
To find a NAMI affiliate in your community, go to www.nami.org and select 
the Find Support tab.
 
You may hear about programs offering art, music, drama, or other creative 
therapies for people with schizophrenia. There is scant empirical research 
supporting the effectiveness of these therapies for schizophrenia. But apart 
from their use as a treatment per se, the creative arts are life-affirming 
pursuits that bring pleasure and provide a way for people to relax, enjoy, 
and create. If your loved one demonstrates a proficiency or interest in the 
arts, encourage him!

185
 Chapter 9: Psychosocial Approaches
Considering Cognitive Remediation
One of the most important recent advances in the field of psychosocial 
rehabilitation has been the emphasis on cognitive remediation (CR). The 
term cognition refers to the way a person thinks. Needless to say, the 
way a person thinks affects the way he approaches and performs many tasks 
in his daily life.
Neuropsychological testing has shown that the vast majority of people 
diagnosed with schizophrenia have a variety of cognitive impairments 
thought to be related to abnormal brain function, including
 
 Difficulty sustaining attention
 
 Impaired memory
 
 Difficulties with verbal learning
 
 Problems making decisions
 
 Delays in the speed of thought processing
The severity of the disability can be marked; over 85 percent of individuals 
with schizophrenia score more poorly on cognitive functioning than 90 
percent of healthy individuals.
Only recently have the severe consequences of these cognitive impairments — 
in preventing social and vocational recovery from schizophrenia, as well as 
interfering with the therapeutic benefits of other psychological inteventions — 
been recognized. As a result, treatment of cognitive impairment has become a 
therapeutic goal using biologic (see Chapter 8) and/or psychosocial approaches. 
Through a variety of techniques, CR — not to be confused with cognitive 
behavior therapy (CBT) — attempts to do one of the following:
 
 Restore or improve thinking skills in either all or some deficit areas
 
 Teach the person with schizophrenia ways of compensating for 
cognitive impairment
 
 Modify the environment in which the person with schizophrenia 
functions to reduce her dependence on cognitive success in order 
to succeed
Although attempts at cognitive rehabilitation began almost 40 years ago 
(in a more limited way), there is still no one commonly accepted or preferred 
way to carry out the training. Increasingly, repetitive skills training (learning 

186
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
through repeated use) is done on the computer, while other forms still 
use paper and pencil. Part of teaching consumers to compensate for their 
disabilities stresses organizing information instead of having to remember 
individual things. For example, CR encourages the use of lists and other 
aids placed in the environment to help the person with schizophrenia to 
remember what needs to be done and to keep organized.
Despite the fact that CR training varies from program to program, it’s clear 
that improvements in cognitive functioning do occur. Not enough studies 
have been conducted to determine how long the improvements last 
after training stops, or whether cognitive improvement also improves 
psychosocial functioning.
Combining other forms of psychiatric rehabilitation, such as social skills 
training and coaching, with specific cognitive remediation training seems to 
bring about greater changes in psychosocial functioning than CR alone. 
Rehabilitation programs often combine pure CR training along with other 
rehabilitation methods. Some of these combined programs include cognitive 
remediation therapy (CRT), neuropsychological educational approach to 
rehabilitation (NEAR), cognitive adaptation training (CAT), and cognitive 
enhancement therapy (CET). (You don’t need to know detailed information 
about these various programs, but it’s useful to be familiar with these names 
so when you hear the terms used, you can identify them as an approach to 
cognitive remediation.)
This is a time when many new methods are being tried to enhance cognitive 
functioning. We believe that when more widely standardized and tested 
psychosocial and biological (medication) approaches become available, 
combining them may lead to vast improvements in treatment. Better success 
may also be found by devising treatments that are more specific to a 
person’s individual impairments.
One of the biggest drawbacks to the use of CR today is the lack of programs 
and practitioners trained to provide CR. Some researchers are developing 
methods for families to be able to apply these methods on their own. For 
example, having family members remind the person with schizophrenia to 
compensate for memory problems by diligently writing things down and 
keeping lists or having someone who is highly distractible only undertake 
one task at a time (as opposed to multitasking).
 
The New York State Office of Mental Health has produced a handbook for 
friends and family members titled Dealing with Cognitive Dysfunction 
Associated with Psychiatric Disabilities. You can download for free at www.
omh.state.ny.us/omhweb/cogdys_manual/CogDysHndbk.pdf.

187
 Chapter 9: Psychosocial Approaches
Expanding Psychosocial Options
Consumer choice should be a major factor in selecting treatments. For 
choices to be informed, your loved one needs to know more about the risks 
and benefits of various treatments and be able to compare each of them in 
terms of their cost and effectiveness. This may be a tall order until your 
loved one reaches a certain point in the process of recovery.
Moreover, in the real world, most communities do not provide the full range 
of psychosocial, individual, group, self-help, and cognitive remediation 
treatments that are necessary to facilitate optimal treatment. The growth of 
the patient and family advocacy movement holds much hope for stimulating 
more interest and funding in these types of treatments.
The bottom line: Working together, consumers, families, and professionals 
need to:
 
 Identify an individual’s particular strengths and deficits.
 
 Find out about the availability of psychosocial rehabilitation practitio-
ners and programs in the community.
 
 Develop an individualized plan to minimize, remediate, or adapt to 
deficits created by the illness.
 
 Become advocates to ensure that there are effective and self-affirming 
choices available to maintain and/or restore the dignity, self-worth, and 
productivity for people with schizophrenia.

through Research

 Finding out about complementary and alternative treatments for schizophrenia
 Determining whether participating in a clinical trial is right for your loved one
 Keeping abreast of new research on the Internet
A
lmost every day, there’s a news report on television, on the radio, 
or in a newspaper or magazine announcing some fantastic new health 
breakthrough. These breakthroughs sound so promising that consumers 
often rush to their doctor for the “latest treatment,” only to find out that the 
marvelous results reported are from preliminary studies, conducted with 
small numbers of people, and that they haven’t been verified by other 
researchers. It may be years before the reported treatments or drugs are 
available to the general public. Yet, if your loved one is suffering from a 
disorder such as schizophrenia, these reports provide a glimmer of hope for 
the future. In fact, some of these reports turn out to herald real advances.
Although having all the answers necessary to prevent and cure schizophre-
nia would be wonderful, research is generally a slow, incremental process, 
where one scientist’s findings build upon another’s. Clinical trials take 
considerable time to complete, and many don’t live up to their original 
promise.
In this chapter, we look at the most current research on treatments for 
schizophrenia — its promises and pitfalls. We also answer the question of 
why new drugs take so long to get into pharmacies and how doctors know 
that certain drugs work. Finally, we take you behind the scenes of research, 
giving you insight into how clinical trials are done, and help you decide 
whether your loved one should participate in a clinical trial.

Understanding the Process of Research
Research is technically defined as “the systematic collection of data which 
is intended to be used beyond the place where it is collected.” Without 
continued research, medical knowledge would stagnate. Early medical 
advances sometimes involved accidental discoveries of new medications 
or treatments, but today’s advances are more likely to be the result of years 
of medical research. And research today is generally no accident.
Although much has been learned about diseases of the brain over the last 
few decades, leading to improved treatment, care, and quality of life, much 
more remains to be learned. Fortunately, a growing number of interdisciplin-
ary researchers (in psychiatry, biology, chemistry, neuroscience, psychol-
ogy, and medicine) are working diligently to answer the still unanswered 
questions about the causes of schizophrenia, with an eye toward prevention, 
early intervention, and better treatment and services. Because they share 
these same goals, people with schizophrenia, their friends and family 
members, and mental-health professionals have led the charge for increased 
research.
Aside from the human costs, the financial costs of mental illness in the 
United States are estimated at more than $150 billion annually, with the 
largest portion of that cost due to the lost productivity associated with 
mental disorders. Yet, research on mental illness has traditionally been 
underfunded compared to research on chronic physical problems like 
cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. This is due, in no small part, to the 
social stigma associated with schizophrenia.
 
The 2008 funding for the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) was 
about $1.4 billion, an increase of about 0.1 percent over the year before. This 
marks the fifth consecutive year that the NIMH budget grew at a rate less 
than biomedical research inflation, which is estimated at 3.5 percent per year. 
This makes for a highly competitive research environment, with many 
research projects competing for the same funding.
 
Recently, there has been a greater emphasis on the importance of translational 
research, which takes findings from the laboratory bench to the proverbial 
bedside. This research is conducted at the basic laboratory level with the 
clear expectation that it will be applied to a clinically relevant problem. 
For example, instead of studying hearing for its own sake, investigators focus 
their work on the role of hearing in relation to the auditory hallucinations 
prominent in schizophrenia.

 Chapter 10: Finding Help and Hope through Research
Making sense of the mental-health research 
enterprise: The major players
A number of public and private sources support 
mental-health research. One of the most impor-
tant is the National Institute of Mental Health 
(NIMH): At the federal level, the NIMH, a part of 
the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is the 
focal point for the funding of mental-health 
research on brain, mind, and behavior — 
ranging from basic science to clinical practice.
With overall funding caps and growing inflation, 
NIMH is expected to place greater emphasis on 
funding schizophrenia research, particularly 
around the first signs of the illness before 
diagnosis, around genetics, and around 
cognitive deficits (see Chapter 3).
NIH maintains a search engine called CRISP 
(www.crisp.cit.nih.gov) that enables 
anyone to look at the current portfolio of 
mental-health research grants funded by the 
federal government.
Other important players in mental-health 
research include
  The Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration (SAMHSA): 
SAMHSA, which includes the Center for 
Mental Health Services (CMHS), funds 
studies on the implementation, cost, and 
effectiveness of mental-health and sub-
stance-abuse services. The agency has led 
the charge in pioneering studies of peer 
and consumer-run services, identification 
and treatment of co-occurring mental-
health and substance-abuse disorders, and 
mental-health initiatives focused on special 
populations.
  The Agency for Healthcare Research 
and Quality (AHRQ): AHRQ focuses on 
developing information tools to assist health 
(including mental health) policymakers to 
improve the way care is organized, 
financed, paid for, and regulated.
  National Alliance for Research on 
Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD): 
The donor-supported NARSAD is the 
world’s leading charity dedicated to 
mental-health research. As of March 2008, 
NARSAD has awarded a total of $219 
million through 3,243 research grants to 
scientists in 418 institutions in the United 
States and 26 other countries. The organi-
zation raises and distributes funding for 
promising psychiatric research in order to 
develop new preventive measures, better 
diagnoses, and improved treatments for 
these conditions. NARSAD also educates 
the public about the value of psychiatric 
research.
 
 NARSAD recently collaborated with the 
NIMH to create the Schizophrenia Research 
Forum (www.schizophreniaforum.
org), a unique online resource for scien-
tists and the public. One portion of the site 
highlights new and significant research 
findings.
  Other private foundations: The Stanley 
Research Foundation, the Robert Wood 
Johnson Foundation, the van Ameringen 
Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. 
MacArthur Foundation, and many others 
are instrumental in funding psychiatric 
research. Additionally, private industry, 
particularly pharmaceutical and biotech-
nology companies, provide funding support 
for additional studies of new compounds, 
drugs, devices, and technologies.

Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
Looking at Clinical Trials 
and How They Work
Much of what is known in medicine, including which medications work 
best, is determined by medical research done through clinical trials 
(experimental studies designed to determine whether there is a cause-
and-effect relationship between an intervention (treatment) and an outcome 
(symptom) — for example, is a drug effective in controlling positive 
symptoms of schizophrenia?). Controlled clinical trials are considered the 
gold standard for research. In these studies, the new treatment (called 
an intervention) is compared to an ineffective treatment or to an already 
existing treatment in a fair, unbiased way.
Seeing how clinical trials are conducted
In a controlled clinical trial, one group of people (called the experimental 
group) is given a drug, and another group of people (called the control group) 
is given a placebo (an inert substance, like a sugar pill) or a known standard 
medication. The investigator (the person conducting the research) compares 
the effects seen in these two groups. If there’s a statistically significant differ-
ence (a difference not likely to be due to chance) between the two groups 
in terms of reducing the symptoms (called the outcome measure), the 
medication is determined to be effective.
Each person going into the trial has an equal chance of getting the active 
medication or the placebo; this is known as randomization. By assigning 
people to the different treatment groups randomly, it’s more likely that 
the groups will be equal and that any differences seen will be due to the 
treatments they receive. Another way of preventing bias in a trial is called 
double-blinding. This means that neither the person receiving the medication 
nor the person evaluating the response knows whether an active or inactive 
medication has been given. If they did know, they might unintentionally be 
more enthusiastic if they knew they were receiving or judging the active 
rather than the inactive medication.
In some circumstances, experimental research can’t be conducted. For 
example, a researcher wouldn’t give an ill person a drug that makes his con-
dition permanently worse. So in cases like this, researchers use correlational 
methods, which look at the relationships between two variables to see if 
they’re related. Correlational methods are unable to definitively establish 
cause and effect.
 
In the case of medications, the first clinical trials (called Phase I trials) are 
conducted using healthy volunteers, to make sure the drug has no serious 
side effects.

193
 Chapter 10: Finding Help and Hope through Research
Clinical trials are easier to evaluate when interventions or outcomes 
can be precisely measured. Some clinical trials related to schizophrenia test 
psychosocial approaches. Although the principles of experimental design 
are similar, it’s more difficult to accurately measure the dose, quality, or 
purity of a complex psychosocial intervention as compared to measuring, for 
example, the dose of a medication.
 
No one study, however well designed and executed it may be, is ever consid-
ered as absolute proof that something is beneficial. Studies are repeated by 
other investigators to be sure they get the same results and that the findings 
are reliable.
Evidence-based treatment is a term often used to identify interventions that 
have been tested and have been proven effective. In the case of medications, 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must find the treatment safe and 
effective and that the benefits of the medication outweigh its risks before the 
drug can be sold.
Deciding whether to participate 
in clinical trials
In all areas of medical science, clinical research depends on the participation 
of volunteers. If your loved one with schizophrenia doesn’t respond to 
various existing treatments, her doctor may suggest that she consider 
enrolling in a clinical trial that will compare a promising new treatment 
(which may not be available elsewhere) to one or more treatments that are 
already used and approved. Being asked to participate in a clinical trial can 
be both exciting and a little frightening.
People participate in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including the 
following:
 
 To advance science and help save lives
 
 To take advantage of new treatments and be at the forefront of 
therapeutic breakthroughs
 
 To try something different when their illness is treatment-resistant
 
 To receive high-quality medical care with close monitoring for little or 
no cost
At the conclusion of a study, researchers have a responsibility to disseminate 
their findings to other researchers, clinicians, the general public, and to 
policymakers.

194
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
Deciding whether to participate in a clinical trial requires some thought and 
investigation. When your loved one is considering whether participating in a 
clinical trial makes sense, here are some things you’ll want to do:
 
 Using the Internet or visiting the library, find out whatever informa-
tion you can about the available treatments for your loved one’s 
condition. The National Library of Medicine (NLM; www.nlm.nih.gov) 
provides current information on various conditions and their treatment. 
You may also be able to get information from some of the mental-health 
research and advocacy organizations we list in the appendix. The more 
you learn, the better prepare you’ll be to ask questions about the trial 
and what it can do for your loved one.
 
 Discuss treatment options with your loved one’s psychiatrist or 
another health professional whom you know and trust. They can help 
you weigh the respective risks, outcomes, and benefits of participation 
in a trial.
 
 Involve a trusted friend or family member in the decision. Bring them 
with you when you go to learn about the trial. They may hear things you 
don’t hear or see things differently.
 
Most clinical trials cover the cost of evaluation, treatment, and transportation. 
What is paid for and what is not should be spelled out in the informed consent 
form (see the nearby sidebar, “What is informed consent?”). The study 
director will also help your loved one transition into some appropriate type 
of follow-up care after your participation in the study is completed.
What is informed consent?
Informed consent refers to the process of fully 
explaining to the person participating in 
research what the study entails, including 
potential benefits and risks, and then obtaining 
her voluntary agreement (or consent).
Informed consent is so important in research 
that no human participants can be involved in 
any way until after informed consent has been 
obtained. Informed consent presents special 
problems when subjects may not be deemed 
legally capable of understanding what’s 
involved with a study. But having a mental dis-
order doesn’t necessarily mean that a person is 
unable to understand or evaluate the benefits 
and risks of participating in clinical research. 
Many people with schizophrenia can provide 
informed consent.
When an individual is not able to provide 
informed consent because she lacks the capac-
ity to understand the proposed research, she 
often has the capacity to name a surrogate or 
substitute who can make the decision for her. 
Safeguards exist so that consent is obtained 
both from the participant and a legally autho-
rized representative, such as a parent, a guard-
ian, or a spouse.

195
 Chapter 10: Finding Help and Hope through Research
Finding the right trial for your loved one
Sometimes your doctor will know about a trial going on that may be just 
right for your situation. But don’t be limited by recommendations from one 
doctor or a particular institution that advertises in the newspaper or on 
the radio. Here are some tips for finding the right trial for your loved one 
with schizophrenia:
 
 Find out the trials for which your loved one may be eligible. The 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) maintains a registry of clinical trials 
(www.clinicaltrials.gov) to provide patients and family members 
with information about governmental and privately sponsored trials. 
The site includes general information about each trial’s purpose, 
who may participate, location, and a phone number to call for more 
information.
 
 The information at www.clinicaltrials.gov is intended to be used 
in conjunction with advice from healthcare professionals.
 
 Eligibility for clinical trials is usually based on very specific study 
criteria. For example, your loved one may be too old or too young, have 
other complicating emotional problems, or have health problems 
that preclude participation. Don’t take rejection personally. Instead, 
recognize that it’s intended to protect your loved one and make sure 
that the trial provides the precise answers for which it is designed.
 
 Speak to the study director or other investigators at the site. If your 
loved one participates in a trial, the research will likely be conducted at 
a physician’s office, clinic, hospital, or other healthcare setting. Be sure 
to meet with the staff at the site beforehand so you and your loved one 
feel comfortable there and understand the procedures.
 
 Learn about the process of informed consent. Carefully read the 
informed consent form that outlines key facts about the clinical trial — 
including procedures, risks, benefits, and expected outcomes. The 
form should be user-friendly and easy to read. If it isn’t, be sure to 
ask questions. Even after enrollment, you have the right to raise any 
concerns you have with the director of the study or the director of the 
institutional review board (IRB; see the sidebar “Institutional review 
boards: They’ve got your back,” in this chapter).
 
 Informed consent is not a one-time event but a continuing process. You 
also have the right to withdraw from a study at any time for any reason.
Although participating in a clinical trial may not be the right choice for every 
person, every condition, or in every situation, it does offer possible benefits 
for some patients — and trials provide information and hope for others who 
will benefit from the results.

196
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
 
Many family members volunteer to participate as healthy volunteers in non-
interventional studies where they may have MRIs taken or provide blood for 
genetic studies. This is one way friends or family members of persons with 
schizophrenia can help advance research on their loved ones’ illnesses.
New and Promising Directions 
in Research
There has never been a more exciting or productive time in the history 
of schizophrenia research than the present. New techniques in the basic 
sciences (molecular biology and genetics) have allowed scientists to better 
study the neurobiology of the brain and its relationship to schizophrenia. 
Institutional review boards: They’ve got your back
An institutional review board (IRB) is a commit-
tee established under federal and state regula-
tions to protect the rights and welfare of people 
who participate in research. IRBs review all 
proposed research involving human subjects. 
They approve only studies that meet strict crite-
ria for the protection of people who participate 
in them. IRBs are comprised of health profes-
sionals, scientists, lay people, consumers, 
family members, community members, quality 
assurance representatives, statisticians, and 
ethicists; this broad range of expertise allows 
the IRB to consider the burdens potentially 
placed on participants.
If you’re participating in a trial being conducted 
by a hospital or other large institution, that 
institution may have its own internal IRB 
that reviews and approves all their clinical 
trials. Studies done through physicians’ offices 
are overseen by a central IRB, which looks 
at research done at a number of different 
clinical sites.
Any IRB, whether specific to an institution or 
centralized, looks to make sure safeguards are 
in place to protect participants. When research 
studies are discussed, approval is made only if 
the following criteria are met:
  Risks to subjects are minimized.
  Risks are reasonable in relation to antici-
pated benefits.
  Selection of subjects is equitable.
  Informed consent will be sought and docu-
mented from each subject or the subject’s 
legally authorized representative.
  Appropriate monitoring will take place.
  Adequate provisions will be in place to 
protect the privacy of individuals and the 
confidentiality of their data.
  Useful information will likely result from 
the study.

197
 Chapter 10: Finding Help and Hope through Research
New pharmacologic and clinical imaging techniques allow scientists to study 
the brain as well as follow the course of the disorder and examine the impact 
of treatment.
More attention is being focused on public attitudes and the harmful effects of 
the negative stigma associated with schizophrenia, and on the importance 
of both peer support and recovery (see Chapter 15). Psychosocial treatment 
and health services research is aimed at studying a broad range of interven-
tions to improve functioning and quality of life, as well as the best ways to 
deliver these treatments (see Chapters 9 and 15).
So, with all this research and discovery, why don’t scientists yet have all the 
answers? Simply put, this type of complex, biopsychosocial research (research 
that combines biological, psychological, and social approaches) does not 
progress in a simple straight line from point A to point B, like constructing a 
building from a plan. It’s more like painting a picture, where each scientific 
article is a little dab of paint on a different part of the canvas. We can’t 
recognize the picture until enough paint has filled up the blank spots on the 
portrait. Sometimes we can’t even be sure of what is background and what 
is foreground without repeating studies and determining their relevance to 
the other dabs of color on the canvas.
In the following sections, we fill you in on new drugs and other treatments 
and technologies that are on the horizon, which may prove successful in 
treating schizophrenia.
New directions in drug discovery
One area of development involves the creation of new classes of medications — 
which may work along with the current antipsychotics or possibly one day 
replace them.
Current antipsychotic medications are good at controlling the positive 
symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, and agitation) seen in schizophrenia. 
Because they’re so good, we’ve come to recognize that, after the positive 
symptoms clear, people with schizophrenia still have underlying and very 
profound problems with cognition (memory, verbal ability, decision-making) 
and so-called negative symptoms (such as lack of motivation, problems 
socializing, and the inability to experience pleasure).
Very precise neuropsychological tests have been developed that can 
measure cognitive performance in people with schizophrenia. Not only have 
deficits been noted, but some deterioration in cognitive abilities has been 
found even before these individuals were diagnosed with schizophrenia. And 
perhaps even more important, the severity of cognitive impairment has 
been found to be related to the person’s inability to function even after their 
positive symptoms are treated with antipsychotic medications.

198
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
Therefore, a great deal of focused effort is now underway to develop medica-
tions that specifically target the cognitive impairments of schizophrenia. 
Because antipsychotic medications are thought to work primarily by block-
ing dopamine receptors in the brain and these medications control positive 
symptoms, researchers are searching for medications that will affect other 
neurotransmitters and correct or lessen cognitive deficits.
In the following sections, we cover three new approaches that offer hope 
for treating some of the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia that have 
long eluded prior therapeutic efforts.
 
Although it’s somewhat hard to understand how all these different systems 
in the brain could be responsible for some of the symptoms of schizophrenia, 
these systems are linked to one another. If researchers can identify and 
correct the crucial malfunctioning system, the other “upstream” and/or 
“downstream” systems may also be corrected with significant therapeutic 
benefit.
Glutaminergic approaches
One clue about what system to study came about by the clinical observation 
that phencyclidine (PCP, commonly called angel dust), a drug of abuse, 
causes a variety of symptoms (including cognitive deficits) that look like 
schizophrenia. Using this drug, pharmacologists and biochemists were able 
to show that it had the effect of blocking a receptor in the brain (called 
NMDA), which was stimulated by the neurotransmitter glutamine.
Drugs other than PCP, which also block glutamine neurotransmission, were 
found to cause cognitive problems, too. Glutamine receptors are found 
widely distributed in the brain, and the glutamate system interacts with 
the dopamine system (as well as other neurotransmitters systems — for 
example, GABA).
With this understanding — in other words, that blocking glutamate receptors 
causes cognitive problems — the hypothesis emerged that cognitive 
problems in schizophrenia may be due to insufficient glutamine activity in 
the brain. In order to test this hypothesis (and see whether increasing or 
stimulating glutaminergic activity could reverse cognitive problems), a 
search has begun for medications that may have this biological effect.
Currently three substances that are relatively simple amino acids (glycine, 
serine, and sarcosine), all of which increase glutaminergic transmission, have 
been studied both in the laboratory and in human clinical trials. Some small 
clinical trials have had relatively positive results, but the largest trial using 
glycine called into question the effectiveness and practicality of using it as a 
treatment. In order to be effective, glycine has to be given in large quantities 

199
 Chapter 10: Finding Help and Hope through Research
(usually as a citrus-like drink), and this has been found to be too difficult for 
many patients to tolerate and has caused to some gastrointestinal side 
effects. Studies with serine are ongoing in the United States and Israel, but 
sarcosine is not currently approved for study in the United States.
With this foundation, ways of facilitating glutaminergic transmission 
other than using the amino acid approach are underway. One fairly large 
clinical trial has been reported by Eli Lilly and Company using a metabotropic 
(a different type of receptor function) glutamate approach that reportedly 
affects both positive and cognitive symptoms favorably. Other companies 
are using so-called glutamine transporter inhibitor compounds to enhance 
glutaminergic transmission, but clinical results have not yet been reported.
So, although there is great research activity and drug discovery effort 
pointed in new directions, there hasn’t yet been any proven success, either 
in terms of efficacy (producing a desired effect) or safety, in developing a new 
class of cognition-restoring or cognition-enhancing medications based on 
facilitating glutaminergic function.
Noradrenergic approaches
A second approach to treating cognitive deficits in schizophrenia is related 
to the noradrenergic neurotransmitter receptor system located specifically in 
the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which is known to be important for cogni-
tion. Studies of humans with schizophrenia and memory/cognition studies of 
animals both show the association of this system with some of the cognitive 
deficits found in people with schizophrenia.
Two types of medications have potential for correcting these deficits. One is 
called an alpha 2a selective agonist, and a medication with this activity named 
guanfacine has actually been tried as an add-on treatment in persons already 
receiving second-generation antipsychotics (see Chapter 8). Improvements 
in both memory and reaction time were noted in preliminary studies, but 
confirmatory studies need to be carried out over longer periods of time to 
see if meaningful clinical improvement is seen.
The other approach to correcting noradrenergic problems is with the use 
of so-called specific norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Medications with 
this activity (for example, atomoxetine [brand name, Strattera]) are already 
in use to treat attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Results of 
controlled clinical trials testing this therapeutic possibility have not yet 
been reported.
Cholinergic approaches
The cholinergic system is another system that plays an important role 
in relation to cognitive functioning. Its major neurotransmitter is called 

200
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
acetylcholine, and it attaches to a nicotinic receptor and a so-called muscar-
inic receptor. Both types of receptors have been shown to be implicated in 
neurophysiologic malfunctions in some people with schizophrenia.
Some 80 percent of people with schizophrenia are heavy smokers, and it’s 
thought that the nicotine in cigarettes may actually reverse some of the 
neurophysiological (nervous system) deficits associated with schizophrenia. 
It’s been suggested that medications that directly stimulate these receptors — 
so-called nicotinic agonists — might be useful therapeutic agents. However, so 
far there are no significant clinical trial results available.
Other new technologies
Recent advances in technology have led to the development of new tech-
niques that once could never have even been imagined. Two such techniques 
that are currently being studied in multiple sites include deep brain 
stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.
Deep brain stimulation
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) — which sounds a little like science-fiction — 
involves implanting a battery-powered, high-frequency pulse generator, 
either in the region of the collarbone or in the abdomen, and running a wire 
under the skin up the neck, behind the ear, and to the head. Tiny electrodes 
are placed at specific sites in the brain, and electrical signals are sent to 
interfere with brain activity at these preselected sites. The type and strength 
of pulses sent can be varied by a computer controlling the battery-operated 
stimulator.
DBS was developed and has been proven useful for treating various types of 
movement disorders (such as Parkinson’s disease); in fact, it’s estimated that 
some 35,000 people around the world have had DBS electrodes placed. Its 
use for the treatment of mental disorders is at a very preliminary stage — 
more studies have been done on the effects of DBS on depression and 
obsessive-compulsive disorder than on schizophrenia.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive way to cause an 
electrical activation of the brain, using a magnetic field (which easily passes 
through the skull). This electromagnetic stimulation can be precisely varied 
in its strength, location, duration, and frequency and is a tool for studying the 
brain and as well as a potential treatment.

201
 Chapter 10: Finding Help and Hope through Research
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is the use of grouped 
pulses of stimulation, which causes a continuous activation over brief 
periods (minutes) of a treatment session. rTMS has been more intensely 
studied as a treatment for depression, but a number of experimental 
treatment studies have been carried out in people with schizophrenia.
Attempts have been made to use rTMS to treat both the positive and negative 
symptoms of schizophrenia. People with persistent treatment-resistant 
auditory hallucinations have had the hallucinations markedly reduced in 
some studies, but this improvement has not been lasting, and no follow-up 
studies have been conducted. Some studies have not shown beneficial 
effects, but these differences may be accounted for by both patient differ-
ences and differences in the way the rTMS was administered (for example, 
duration and frequency).
Studies attempting to treat negative symptoms have also shown mixed 
success. Different frequencies of stimulation at a different location (in the 
prefrontal cortex) from the auditory hallucinations studies were used. The 
most promising results seem to occur when the frequency of stimulation 
used is matched to the alpha (brain wave) frequency seen in each individual, 
rather than just using the same frequency for everyone.
In general, then, rTMS looks like a potentially promising noninvasive treat-
ment, but the correct “dosing” (duration, frequency, location) is not well 
enough studied or understood to consider it a viable treatment alternative.
Opening New Windows into the Brain
Opportunities to study the brain, especially the living brain, have increased 
dramatically over the past 35 years. Before the advent of newer imaging 
techniques — such as magnetic resonance image (MRI) and positron emis-
sion tomography (PET) — the ways to directly study the brain were limited. 
These included X-rays and brain biopsies (removing a piece of brain during 
neurosurgery).
Surgically placing electrodes in the brain permitted direct examination of the 
electrical functioning of the living brain. Indirect measures such as electrical 
recordings from the scalp (called EEG and evoked potentials) and measuring 
chemicals in the spinal fluid that bathes the brain were other techniques that 
were used with some success. Postmortem studies of the brain could be car-
ried out, but brain composition changes with death and no measurement of 
ongoing mind function was possible.

202
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
With the discovery and refinement of MRI, however, it became possible, 
without touching the brain directly, to image the structure (the physical con-
figuration), the function (activity), and the composition (chemistry) of the 
brain. No radioactivity is involved — only magnetism — so imaging can be 
done as often as necessary with no physical risk to the person being imaged.
 
You may also hear an MRI referred to as an fMRI (short for functional MRI) and 
MRS (the S stands for spectroscopy) studies.
PET imaging and a related technique known as single photon emission 
computed tomography (SPECT) were also developed about 35 years ago. 
Both of these techniques require the administration of a small amount 
of a radioactive substance to the person being imaged. Although very 
useful for studies of brain receptors and specific drug actions, frequently 
repeated examinations using this technique are not possible because of the 
radioactivity involved. Nonetheless, PET and SPECT give rise to some types 
of information not available through MRI study. Thus, MRI and PET are 
considered complementary imaging methods.
Both MRI and fMRI studies have shown differences in the structure and func-
tion of the brain between groups of people with and without schizophrenia. 
These differences have pointed at areas and functions where something has 
gone wrong.
 
No new treatments, either biological or psychological, have yet directly 
resulted from MRI studies. But imaging has been important in learning more 
about schizophrenia and the brain, and it offers hope for the future. By investi-
gating the biology of what has gone wrong, researchers are likely to find ways 
to “fix” the broken areas.
Another potential use for MRI is to help test whether treatments are actually 
having an effect. If scientists know that one area of the brain in people with 
schizophrenia has to work harder to solve a cognitive task and they give the 
person a medication, they can use the MRI to see if the brain doesn’t have 
to work as hard to solve that task with medication. (The technology may 
actually be able to see improvement in brain function prior to any changes 
in the behavior of the person.) If the medication doesn’t work on the brain 
function, then researchers don’t need to conduct long and expensive clinical 
trials. Testing in this way is sometimes called proof of concept.
Another way to use the MRI to study the brain is a technique called diffusion 
tensor imaging (DTI). With this method, we can see the white matter of the 
brain and know whether it’s intact or damaged. In the brains of people with 
schizophrenia, white matter pathways that connect different areas of the 
brain have been found to be damaged. This means that vital communication 
between one part of the brain and another, which must be closely synchro-
nized to function appropriately may be out of sync — something like what 
you experience when the sound and picture of someone talking on TV or in 
the movies doesn’t match. Imagine if that happened to your thinking!

Very precise studies, presenting sounds (tones of differing pitches) and 
pictures (with areas missing) have been demonstrated to be seen differently 
by people with and without schizophrenia. These differences in sensory 
abilities may make it hard for people with schizophrenia to interpret the 
voices or facial expressions of individuals talking to them. Correction of 
these basic biological defects — either with medication or with computer 
training — could have a potentially important therapeutic impact.
Psychosocial and Other 
Treatment Research
Psychosocial therapies (also called psychosocial rehabilitation and psychiatric 
rehabilitation) are essential to the treatment of schizophrenia. These include 
a variety of interventions aimed at restoring a person’s ability to function at 
home and in the community.
Psychosocial treatments that occur in real-world settings are infinitely more 
complex and costly to study than more specific interventions that can be 
studied in a laboratory of other controlled conditions. They often have 
multiple outcome measures, some of which are more ephemeral to study 
such as the concept of quality of life (a person’s sense of overall well-being). 
Sometimes, ethnographic methods (the systematic study of individuals in their 
own environments) are used to provide qualitative, observational findings to 
enhance more quantitative ones.
There aren’t the same financial incentives to study psychosocial treatments 
that there are to study medical treatments. Pharmaceutical industry or other 
corporate stakeholders are invested in studying medications and devices 
that will ultimately be patented and profitable. For all these reasons, research 
on psychosocial treatments has lagged in comparison, and is generally 
funded exclusively by the federal government, state governments (to a lesser 
extent), and private philanthropy.
Increasingly the problem of better defining and measuring the “intervention” 
is being addressed by writing manuals to carefully describe how various 
psychosocial treatments are to be administered. This has made it possible 
to carry out credible clinical trials. Also, the goals of some of the newer 
psychosocial interventions (such as CBT) have become more focused (for 
example, on reduction of hallucinations or more logical thinking) and briefer 
rather than global attempts to “make over personality” that were more 
characteristic of older psychoanalytic approaches, which often took years.

204
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
The following psychosocial interventions have been studied extensively and 
have shown positive outcomes:
 
 Family psychoeducation: Classes and groups involving the person 
with schizophrenia and her family — or the family alone — to improve 
mental-health literacy, communication, and coping skills among family 
members and other caregivers
 
 Supported employment: Employment programs that provide education, 
training, and a sense of self-worth and productivity
 
 Assertive community treatment: Intensive case management programs 
that provide outreach and coordinate complex systems of care for 
individuals wherever they are living
 
 Skills training: Programs designed to help consumers relearn skills of 
daily living never learned or that they have forgotten because of the 
illness
 
 Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT): An individual therapy that focuses 
on changing behavior by changing negative thinking
 
 Cognitive remediation: Aimed at improving cognitive skills impaired 
by the illness by teaching compensatory strategies to overcome them, 
similar to that being done with victims of stroke and traumatic brain 
injuries
Just a few of the other treatment approaches being studied include: individ-
ual psychotherapy, family therapy, peer-support groups, self-help groups, 
consumer operated programs, drop-in centers, clubhouses, assisted and 
supportive housing programs, and creative therapies (such as art, music, 
and movement).
 
Based on the available current research, in order for psychosocial interven-
tions to be effective they must be used along with antipsychotic medications. 
The two working together provide the most effective treatment, and although 
there are always exceptions, in general, psychosocial interventions used alone 
do not result in long-term favorable outcomes.
Evaluating Complementary 
and Alternative Treatments
Complementary treatments are ones used together with conventional medi-
cine. Alternative treatments are ones used in place of conventional medicine. 
A variety of complementary and alternative treatments have been tried as 
treatments for schizophrenia. People seek these treatments because:

205
 Chapter 10: Finding Help and Hope through Research
 
 They’ve found that other treatments haven’t worked at all or only have 
addressed some symptoms.
 
 They suffer from uncomfortable side effects of their treatment.
 
 They can’t afford the high cost of prescription medications and 
conventional psychotherapies.
 
 They strongly desire to use what they see as safer and more “natural” 
alternatives.
 
 They don’t believe that schizophrenia is a brain disorder and attribute it 
to other causes (such as nutritional deficiencies).
In the following sections, we cover some of the complementary and alterna-
tive treatments that have been studied.
Omega-3 fatty acids
Studies have looked at the use of omega-3 fatty acids as a dietary supplement 
to reduce the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. These fatty acids aren’t 
manufactured by the body, so they need to be consumed through foods or 
dietary supplements. A systematic review of studies by the Cochrane 
Collaboration (which publishes treatment reviews in all fields of health) 
found that the effects of essential fatty acid (EFA) supplementation may have 
some beneficial effects but that the results were inconclusive “due to the 
limited number of studies and lack of usable data.”
 
Fish oils (a source of omega-3 fatty acids) cannot be used by people allergic 
to iodine or who are using blood thinners. Additionally, there is some 
speculation that EFA-supplements can precipitate mania (excitability).
Antioxidant vitamins
Some research suggests that antioxidant vitamins may be helpful in address-
ing the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Foods containing antioxidants 
include blueberries, prunes, spinach, and strawberries. Although there 
probably is no inherent danger in eating these foods as part of a balanced 
diet, again, evidence is inconclusive.
Vitamin E
There is some anecdotal evidence that vitamin E has helped some individuals 
with tardive dyskinesia (involuntary, repetitive movements of the tongue, 
lips, face, trunk, and extremities associated with the long-term use of first-
generation antipsychotic medications). However, a meta-analysis (a study 

206
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
of other studies) found that most of the trials that were conducted were 
too small or of too short duration to provide definitive results. A Cochrane 
review concluded that the benefits were minimal and might be limited to 
preventing further deterioration. A large study by the Veterans’ 
Administration did not show vitamin E to be effective.
 
In a study conducted to evaluate long-term use of vitamin E to prevent cancer 
in men and women with vascular disease or diabetes, those taking the vitamin 
had a 13 percent increased risk of heart failure. An advisory posted on the 
Web site of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine 
(NCCAM) states: “These results emphasize the need to study vitamins and 
other natural products prior to making public health recommendations.” This 
cautionary note reinforces that even something as simple as a vitamin may 
pose serious health risks for certain individuals. Consumers need to be aware 
of the risks of using yet unproven treatments. At the present time, neither the 
efficacy nor safety of vitamin E can be recommended as a treatment for 
schizophrenia.
N-methylglycine
A number of studies have suggested that N-methylglycine (sarcosine), 
another investigational compound that acts at the NMDA receptor site 
(see “Glutaminergic approaches,” earlier in this chapter), may improve 
positive, negative, cognitive, and general psychiatric symptoms in 
schizophrenia. Because it is investigational, it is still not considered a 
recommended treatment. Besides, to our knowledge, pharmaceutical-grade 
sarcosine is not available in the United States.
Acupuncture
Acupuncture has been used as a treatment in China for more than 2,000 years 
with few adverse effects. A Cochrane review suggests that acupuncture 
is more socially acceptable, tolerable, and affordable than conventional 
drugs. However, a review of controlled clinical trials comparing acupuncture 
to antipsychotics, or using acupuncture as an adjunct to antipsychotics 
for people with schizophrenia, concluded that there isn’t enough rigorous 
research to determine its efficacy and that better-designed studies are 
needed before it can be recommended as a treatment.
The Risks of Unproven Treatments
Eating a nutritionally balanced diet is important for people with 
schizophrenia — just as it is for everybody else. But many lay people 

207
 Chapter 10: Finding Help and Hope through Research
erroneously believe that schizophrenia is caused by poor nutrition. 
Thus, a range of nutritional therapies — including niacin, vitamin B6, and 
megavitamins — have been promoted as treatments for schizophrenia, 
without a credible evidence base supporting their safety or efficacy. For 
example, flushing and rashes are associated with the use of niacin, and 
megadoses of vitamins have been implicated in causing health problems.
 
All food supplements are regulated as foods rather than drugs, so the rules 
for marketing them are much less restrictive than you may think. Neither 
safety nor effectiveness has to be proven in order for them to be marketed. In 
2003, the FDA published proposed guidelines for supplements that would 
require accurate labeling and avoidance of contamination with other herbs, 
pesticides, heavy metals, or prescription drugs.
Bottom line: It’s impossible to draw any positive conclusions about dietary 
supplements and vitamins as proven treatments for schizophrenia. In gen-
eral, studies of alternative and complementary treatments for schizophrenia 
are conflicting, inconclusive, or methodologically weak. Some might even be 
dangerous.
As with research on conventional medicine, one small study is generally 
insufficient to prove whether something works. The same holds true for 
studies of alternative and complementary treatments. What is needed are 
controlled clinical trials with enough participants and rigorous methods that 
are repeated with the same results.
 
In addition to speaking to your medical team, Cochrane Reviews, peer-
reviewed meta-analyses, and information from some of the following 
government agencies can be valuable resources to individuals and families 
considering use of unconventional treatment approaches:
 
 The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine 
(NCCAM), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is the 
lead federal agency for research on complementary and alternative 
medicine. Its Web site (http://nccam.nih.gov) provides a search-
able database of the scientific and medical literature on alternative 
healing practices.
 
 The NIH Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) seeks to strengthen 
knowledge and understanding of dietary supplements by evaluating 
scientific information, supporting research, sharing research results, 
and educating the public. Its resources include publications and the 
International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supplements 
database (http://ods.od.nih.gov/Health_Information/
IBIDs.aspx).

208
Part III: Treating Schizophrenia 
 
 The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition of the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) provides information for consumers such 
as “Tips for the Savvy Supplement User: Making Informed Decisions 
and Evaluating Information” (www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/ds-savvy.
html) and updated safety information on supplements (www.cfsan.
fda.gov/~dms/ds-warn.html). If you’ve experienced an adverse 
effect from a supplement, you can report it to the FDA’s MedWatch 
program, which collects and monitors such information (800-332-1088 
or www.fda.gov/medwatch).
Keeping Abreast of Research 
via the Internet — Wisely
Who can resist the siren call of the Internet when desperately looking for 
medical information? Open 24 hours a day, anonymous, free of charge, and 
always accurate — well, maybe not the last. Many people turn to the Internet 
to learn about medical research, but it’s just as easy to find a quack as it is to 
find a cure if you believe everything you read. Anyone can start a Web site, 
and sometimes it seems that every snake-oil salesperson has.
On the other hand, the Internet is a good source of clinical trial reports and 
the latest research — if you know where to look. Your loved one’s doctor 
should be keeping abreast of all the research developments in the field that 
may prove beneficial for her care, but the doctor probably isn’t available 
24/7. Just make sure to check out anything that seems exciting or promising 
with his office on Monday morning!
 
Social networking sites, user groups, wikis (Web sites that are edited by the 
public), and other Web sites can all provide useful and interesting informa-
tion, but embarking on the information highway requires discretion, judgment, 
and caution.
 
Here are some things to think about when you’re looking for accurate and 
unbiased information and trying to evaluate what you read:
 
 Be critical of what you read. Remember that many people post under 
false identities and that there’s no way to verify what you read without 
doing more research.

209
 Chapter 10: Finding Help and Hope through Research
 
 Consider the source of all information. Try to stick with sites spon-
sored by reputable organizations. The Web address can often help you 
identify the source of the information. If a Web address ends with 
.gov, it’s a U.S. government site. If it ends in .edu, it’s likely the site 
of an educational institution. If it’s .org, it’s a nonprofit. And if it’s a 
.com, it’s generally a for-profit business. Remember: These are just 
general guidelines — you may find a .org site that’s not a nonprofit, 
for example.
 
 Be wary of commercial sites that are selling pharmaceuticals or other 
products. Make sure the information was derived from clinical trials and 
isn’t just someone’s opinion. Examine the credentials of the author 
and his references, usually listed at the end of the article. Find out who 
provided the funding for the trial and whether there might be any 
potential conflict of interest. Compare information on the same topic 
from different sites to see if they provide similar advice.
 
 Chat rooms and forums are rarely a source for solid clinical information.
 
 Rely only on current information. Every major page of a Web site 
should include the date that it was written or reviewed. Whenever 
possible, rely only on material that includes a date. On some sites, no 
one verifies whether information is still accurate or whether it became 
obsolete long ago.
 
 Read only user-friendly material. There are many, many sites to choose 
from, so be sure to use those that are easy to read and navigate. Don’t 
waste your time trying to find information embedded in poorly designed 
Web sites.
 
 Be cautious about sharing private information. On the Internet, you 
can’t be sure that information you divulge will remain private, so 
you need to be cautious. Before you fill out any forms or reveal any 
information about yourself or your family, make sure you review the 
site’s privacy policy. When you post messages in chat rooms or on 
bulletin boards, consider using a pseudonym instead of your real name.
 
Remember that the Internet cannot substitute for medical advice. Given all 
these caveats, always be judicious in your use of the Internet as a source of 
definitive information concerning mental-health issues.
By exercising appropriate caution, the knowledge you get from the Web can 
help you become more literate about mental health, help you learn what 
questions to ask, and enable you to better communicate with professionals.

chizophrenia doesn’t just affect one individual — it 
affects an entire family. We offer concrete advice on 
how to break the news to others and how to cope with the 
challenges it poses to families. Caregiving has its demands 
and rewards, and we cover them in this part. To be an 
effective caregiver, you have to take care of yourself first 
and keep life as normal and balanced for those around 
you, and we show you how. We also offer advice about 
how to resolve conflicts, handle troublesome behaviors, 
and prevent and diffuse crises.
One of the most significant developments in the treatment 
of schizophrenia has been the development of advocacy 
organizations, such as the National Alliance for the 
Mentally Ill, a national organization of consumers and fam-
ilies providing education, support, and advocacy from 
those who have been there. With coordinated care and 
parity in insurance and other benefits, there is more hope 
than ever that people with schizophrenia will recover and 
live happy and productive lives.

W
hen someone close to you has just been diagnosed with schizophre-
nia, you’re likely to feel as though your world has come to an end. 
Many families have told us that the day they first heard the diagnosis divided 
their life into two discrete parts: before and after. Before, they may have 
only had vague feelings that something wasn’t quite right. After, their worst 
fears were confirmed: Someone they loved was diagnosed with a serious 
mental disorder that they knew little about. They came face-to-face with the 
prospect that their loved one’s strange or unusual behaviors were more 
than a small blip on the proverbial radar screen and weren’t likely to go away 
anytime soon on their own.
One mother told us that, after diagnosis, “Things are never the same.” 
You feel as though life — as you once knew it — has vanished and has been 
replaced by a strange new reality. You may worry about the impact of 
the diagnosis on the rest of your family: Will they be able to handle the 
changes this will bring? Will you ever be able to feel like a “normal” family 
again, to laugh and live like everyone else? You may also be concerned 
about what comes next in terms of treatment and think about the long-term 
consequences.
You may say, “Why me?” or “Why us?” — feeling that life has been unfair. 
You may look around you and be envious of those whose lives seem perfect 
in comparison (even though you never know what really lurks behind closed 
doors). Life is never fair and often throws unexpected curves — what counts 
most is how you cope with them.
In this chapter, we look at all the ways schizophrenia may impact your family 
and give you ways to cope with the challenges.

214
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
Adjusting to the Diagnosis
A diagnosis of schizophrenia is always frightening, but it doesn’t mean that 
the future is bleak or hopeless for the person with the illness or for the rest 
of your family. Instead of thinking the worst, stop and take a deep breath. 
The good news is that you’re finally able to attach a name and diagnosis 
to the same disturbing symptoms and behaviors that were worrying you 
before you knew what they were. Nameless fears are often far worse than a 
known reality.
Your initial reaction may be based on outdated and inaccurate information 
from years past. Perhaps you’ve heard stories of a relative who was diag-
nosed with a mental disorder decades ago and who, as a result of that 
diagnosis, spent much of his life locked away in a state mental hospital. Less 
than 50 years ago, people with serious mental disorders were routinely 
sent to institutions for long periods of time. “Out of mind” literally meant 
out of sight. Treatment options were limited, and the available medications 
had side effects that were hard to tolerate. A person being treated for schizo-
phrenia may have looked peculiar, suffering from uncontrollable tics and 
movements that were common to an earlier generation of medications.
With the development of new treatments, new technologies, and changed 
social policies and attitudes toward the treatment of mental illnesses, many 
people with schizophrenia are able to live symptom-free or manage their 
symptoms. So instead of people being warehoused for long periods of time, 
hospitalizations (if they’re necessary) tend to be brief and focused on 
stabilizing acute symptoms, with the goal of returning the individual to the 
community as soon as possible. With proper outpatient treatment and 
supports, people with schizophrenia can recover and lead meaningful lives.
By getting a diagnosis (see Chapter 4), you’ve taken the first step in getting 
help for your loved one and the rest of your family. Understandably, you 
won’t be able to put all your concerns and fears behind you immediately; you 
need time to educate yourself and adjust. Initially, you may feel defensive, 
angry, ashamed, and/or bewildered. Friends and relatives may behave differ-
ently toward you, making you feel isolated and alone. All these reactions, 
while upsetting, are very normal and common. Initial negative reactions don’t 
mean that your family members will never come to accept the new reality of 
your life. They need time, as you do, to go through the predictable stages 
associated with grieving.
When you’re able to accept the diagnosis, you’ll be able to modify your think-
ing about your loved one’s annoying or vexing behaviors and view them 
through a new lens: as symptoms of a neurobiological brain disorder that 
can be treated and managed.

215
 Chapter 11: Schizophrenia and the Family
Staying positive and optimistic
For many years, it has been estimated that about one-third of those diag-
nosed with schizophrenia make a full recovery; another third get better but 
have intermittent (but treatable) repeat episodes; and the last third have 
persistent symptoms. As researchers learn more about the causes of and 
treatments for schizophrenia, there is every reason to be more optimistic 
about the future.
If your relative was recently diagnosed, the odds that her symptoms can 
be controlled are even better because of advances that have been made in 
mental-health treatment and research. Increasingly, relapses can be avoided 
(see Chapter 14), or recurrences can be managed quickly so that life can 
get back to normal; and early diagnosis and sustained intervention can help 
minimize damage to the brain, to self-esteem, and to relationships with 
family, friends, and neighbors.
Even if the symptoms of your loved one’s illness seem to be persistent or 
are treatment-resistant now (see Chapter 8), the rapid pace of research and 
new technologies promise improved treatments. Finally, public awareness 
of mental illnesses has increased over the last decade, leading to greater 
acceptance and understanding.
Understanding the nature of the illness and its treatment will help you appre-
ciate the small and large victories you will achieve as a caregiver and the 
improvements you will see in your loved one. You’ll also learn how crucial it 
is to convey a sense of hope and optimism to your loved one, who may have 
experienced a string of losses before getting help. Most families learn that 
they’re more resilient and resourceful, as individuals and as a family unit, 
than they could have ever imagined.
Avoiding the family blame game
When a person is diagnosed with any serious illness, it’s natural for others to 
look for a cause or explanation. Why did she get lung cancer? Did she smoke? 
Why was she diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer? Didn’t she get routine 
mammograms?
In the case of schizophrenia, if the person who is ill is someone’s child, 
adolescent, or young-adult offspring, the tendency is for outsiders to errone-
ously blame his parents for something they did or did not do. Was his mother 
too controlling, too soft, or neglectful? Was her father too doting, too distant 
emotionally, or too involved with his work? Did both parents give mixed 
messages?

216
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
Even more unfortunately, it’s extremely common for one parent to blame the 
other. Each thinks back about the family tree on the other spouse’s side and 
invariably remembers someone who had one mental illness or another and 
pinpoints that as the source of all problems.
 
Don’t be surprised if you find yourselves blaming each other for things that 
happened years before. Realize that pain and tension are to be expected, but 
you need to make every effort to support, rather than undermine, one another.
 
Schizophrenia is a neurobiologically-based brain disease. Even if there’s a 
family history of mental illness, it doesn’t mean that someone caused the 
mental illness.
Even if no one blames you, you may cast blame upon yourself. It’s not uncom-
mon for parents or partners to spend sleepless nights wondering what they 
did to cause this. Why didn’t you realize what was happening sooner? Should 
you have divorced or not divorced your husband? Did you favor one child 
over another? Are you being punished for something you did long ago? If 
you’re religious, you may find your faith wavering or disappearing completely 
under the weight of unrelenting guilt and anger.
 
Heaping blame on yourself, the person with schizophrenia, or anyone else can 
only have negative effects. Schizophrenia is a no-fault disease. No one wants 
to have the illness and no one has the formula for creating the perfect mix of 
genetics and environment that prime another individual for getting it. There is 
no benefit in looking back — you need to look forward.
Breaking the News to the Family
After you hear a diagnosis, you need to decide who to tell, what to say, and 
when to tell them. This is generally the case with other physical health prob-
lems you or your family members encounter. But because of the myths and 
misunderstandings about mental illness, it’s often difficult to tell even your 
closest friends, extended family, and neighbors, the people you ordinarily 
would lean on when you have a serious problem.
Just finding the right words to explain schizophrenia often presents a 
challenge. We hope that speaking with your doctor and reading this book 
will give you the information, tools, and words you need to feel comfortable 
explaining it to others.
 
Before you break the news to others, educate yourself by reading as much 
information as you can about the disorder. The National Institute of Mental 
Health (NIMH; www.nimh.nih.gov), the American Psychiatric Association 

217
 Chapter 11: Schizophrenia and the Family
(APA; www.psych.org), the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI; 
www.nami.org), and the National Association for Research on Schizophrenia 
and Depression (NARSAD; www.narsad.org) all offer easy-to-read booklets 
free of charge to the public. You can request them from any of these organiza-
tions, and many are available on the Internet or in public libraries (see the 
appendix).
 
Because so many misunderstandings are associated with the diagnosis of 
schizophrenia, after you’ve had the chance to talk to them it often helps 
to provide written information to the people you decide to tell. If the news 
has taken someone by surprise, the person will be better able to comprehend 
what she has heard when she can read it more calmly, and see it in black-
and-white.
Deciding who to tell
As difficult as it may be, except in rare circumstances, you need to tell your 
immediate family members about the diagnosis. They probably have some 
inkling about what’s going on already — and you’ll need to depend on them 
for their support. Your honesty in explaining what’s happened and keeping 
the lines of communication open will make everyone feel like they’re on the 
same team.
Don’t be surprised if someone’s initial reaction is negative, especially if they 
harbor misunderstanding about mental illness. Denial is common, as are 
several other misperceptions, such as:
 
 The myth that schizophrenia is caused by bad parenting: If people 
believe this myth, they may blame one or both parents of the person 
with schizophrenia.
 
 The myth that people with schizophrenia are faking and are really just 
lazy and irresponsible: If people buy into this myth, they may believe 
that the person has control over his symptoms and perhaps you’ve let 
your loved one “get away with it.”
 
 The myth that people with schizophrenia are messed up from alcohol 
and/or drugs: If people believe this, they may think that the symptoms 
are solely caused by substance abuse, and that if the person stops 
abusing drugs or alcohol, the schizophrenia will go away.
 
 The myth that schizophrenia isn’t treatable: If people think this, they 
may feel that the situation is hopeless.
When your family learns more about schizophrenia, they can become your 
most important allies.

218
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
Deciding whether to tell particular friends, neighbors, or employers depends 
on your own comfort level and whether you anticipate negative conse-
quences. Though we strongly recommend telling your immediate family 
about your loved one’s diagnosis, you don’t have to tell everyone about your 
family’s personal issues.
 
Here are some red flags that should make you more hesitant about telling 
someone about your loved one’s mental illness:
 
 The person has previously shown a lack of sensitivity to people with 
mental illness or other disabilities.
 
 The person always asks invasive questions that make you feel worse.
 
 The person has loose lips and is likely to spread gossip for no good 
reason.
 
 Your loved one with mental illness would be embarrassed to tell the 
person herself.
Think through the possible outcomes before saying something you can’t 
later retract. Although most friends and acquaintances will be supportive, it’s 
possible that some may withdraw from you and your family. Conversely, 
some may feel very estranged and distant if they learn the truth long after the 
fact or from someone else other than you. Only you can gauge who you 
should tell and who you shouldn’t.
 
Many people living with schizophrenia find it more comfortable and less 
stressful to be open about their disorder. It takes a lot of energy to keep a 
secret of any kind.
 
Make sure that the person with the illness is likely to be comfortable with the 
decisions you’re making. This is another case where openness and honesty 
with your loved one is the best policy.
In the following sections, we cover the kinds of people you may decide to tell 
or not tell about your loved one’s schizophrenia.
A spouse or partner
Sometimes the person with schizophrenia is a married adult wrestling with 
the issue of whether and when to tell his spouse or partner. This may seem 
like a no-brainer: How could someone conceal the fact that he has schizo-
phrenia from a spouse? Sometimes a spouse has had a psychotic break in the 
past, met and married his spouse during a time when his symptoms were 
under control, and then has a recurrence during the marriage. Not only does 
the recurrence catch the well spouse by surprise, but it challenges the sense 
of trust between the two people.

219
 Chapter 11: Schizophrenia and the Family
There are no hard and fast answers about whether someone with schizophre-
nia should disclose her prior illness to her partner. In the best of circum-
stances, a spouse should be able to share information about any significant 
health condition with the person she’s marrying, but fears about mental 
illness can be so great that it’s sometimes simply too hard to do.
If a spouse finds out about the illness after the fact, he may initially be 
angry and will probably need to gather information and garner support to 
get over the trauma. The person with schizophrenia may feel remorseful, 
stressed, and fearful that the outing of the “secret” will signal the demise 
of the marriage. And it may. It can go either way.
We know one spouse of many years who never came to visit his wife when 
she was hospitalized for schizophrenia the first time during their marriage; it 
ultimately ended in a painful divorce. In another circumstance, we know a 
marriage of more than 30 years, where a caregiver hung in with her spouse 
because of her abiding love and ability to cope with the extra responsibilities 
she shoulders as the spouse of someone who is quite disabled and unable 
to work.
 
If someone you know who has schizophrenia, perhaps a daughter or cousin, 
asks your advice about whether she should tell her spouse or partner, the 
most helpful thing you can do is listen, so that the individual making the 
decision thinks through the consequences clearly and is confident in her 
decision. There are no rights and wrongs. In tough situations like this, people 
have to go with their gut and do what feels most comfortable to them.
Your kids
If you have young children in the family, try to explain what’s happening 
around them, instead of assuming that they’re too young to understand or to 
be affected by what’s going on.
Keep your explanations very simple, give only as much detail as necessary to 
satisfy the child’s curiosity, and be sure that he understands that this isn’t a 
“closed” subject, but one he can feel free about discussing with you. You 
might say, for example, that Uncle Joe has a problem with the way his brain 
is working, and he’s going to see a doctor to take medicine to straighten 
things out. You also want to reassure your kids about their safety, because 
they may have watched frightening TV shows or movies depicting mental 
illness.
If your children are older, they’ll likely be able to handle more sophisticated 
explanations. For example, you might tell an adolescent that Uncle Joe has 
schizophrenia, which is a brain disorder, and that he is being treated with 
medication. You might discuss some of his symptoms and what it will mean 
in terms of his ability to get back to work.

Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
The extended family
Deciding whether you should disclose the illness to more distant relatives 
depends on your relationship with them as well as your comfort level — and 
what you decide today isn’t a decision that’s set in stone. Many people living 
with mental illness find it less stressful to be open about their disorder with 
their entire family. Others feel that shielding Great-Aunt Mary, who lives a 
thousand miles away from the truth, may be best for everyone involved.
In all likelihood, close family members are already aware that something’s 
wrong. The family grapevine is quite effective in most families, so even 
relatives you see only occasionally may know that your loved one has a 
problem. The truth may be easier to deal with than suppositions and gossip.
One mother confided to us that the hardest thing for her to do was to tell her 
elderly mother that her grandson had just been diagnosed with schizophre-
nia. She knew that her mother would never understand and would likely 
blame her daughter’s permissive parenting style. As she anticipated, it wasn’t 
easy but gradually, her mother came to understand the illness by attending 
support-group meetings with her daughter, and it made the relationship 
between mother, daughter, and grandson that much stronger.
Friends and neighbors
You may have friends or neighbors with whom you feel as close as — or 
even closer to than — your family. You may already have shared your 
concerns and fears with them. If you feel that they’ll be able to provide you 
with support, you’ll probably want to include them in your inner circle.
 
If you aren’t sure or feel tentative about telling a particular individual, wait 
until you feel confident. It may simply be that the timing isn’t right.
Employers
One of the most difficult decisions people face is deciding whether to tell 
an employer about the illness. If you’re a caregiver of someone with schizo-
phrenia, you may need to take time off from work to take your loved one to 
medical appointments, to provide transportation to programs, or to oversee 
care in your home.
 
Your loved one may want to tell her employer about her condition so she 
can benefit from accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act 
(ADA); see Chapter 12 for further guidance on handling these challenges.
Knowing what to say
As difficult as it is to break the news to someone else, you should expect 
that the people hearing it may feel uncomfortable, taken aback, or surprised. 
After all, you had time to prepare yourself for this talk and they didn’t.

221
 Chapter 11: Schizophrenia and the Family
Don’t be surprised at strange reactions. People often don’t know what to 
say or don’t make the kindest remarks when someone talks about illness, 
hardship or death. They may ask, “How did she get it? Does it run in your 
family? Is there any cure?” Recognize that they may need some time and 
information — just as you did — and that breaking the news may be a 
process rather than a one-time event.
 
Here are some guidelines that may make it easier for both you and the person 
who is first hearing about the illness:
 
 Pick the right time and setting when you aren’t rushed and you have 
privacy. Blurting it out at Grandma’s 80th birthday party probably isn’t 
one of the best ways!
 
 Explain that mental illnesses are no-fault brain disorders and that 
even scientists still can’t pinpoint the specific causes of mental illness 
in a particular individual.
 
 Tell them that, in general, mental disorders are caused by a 
combination of genetic and environmental factors.
 
 Explain that no one is to blame, not your loved one or your family. 
Explain that just as you wouldn’t blame a person or his family for 
heart disease, diabetes, or asthma, you shouldn’t blame a person with 
schizophrenia for his disease. The days of people blaming everything 
on someone’s mother have gone out the window!
 
 Use simple language that the other person can understand. Try not to 
repeat or make use of unintelligible medical jargon you’ve read or heard 
from doctors or therapists.
 
 Don’t feel compelled to provide a specific label or diagnosis. Deciding 
to reveal doesn’t mean you have to reveal every single detail to every 
single person. Be judicious. (See the following section, “Deciding how 
much to tell,” for more information.)
 
 Explain that the disorder is treatable and that your loved one is being 
treated by a specialist.
 
 Because of the public misperception that people with mental illness 
are violent, you may want to add that your loved one doesn’t pose 
any harm or threat to you or anyone else (if you believe this is so).
 
 Convey your hopefulness that the symptoms your loved one is 
experiencing will improve.
 
 Tell the person that you hope you can count on her confidentiality 
and support and that you’ve disclosed the information to her because 
you trust her.

222
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
Deciding how much to tell
The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, an advocacy organization for 
people with mental disabilities, outlines four levels of specificity that people 
can use to explain mental disorders. Depending on how much you want 
to reveal and who you’re talking to, these are some options for explaining 
schizophrenia:
 
 Very general: Say your loved one has a medical condition or an illness. 
This level of information may be appropriate for an employer.
 
 A little more specific: Say that your loved one has a biochemical 
imbalance, a neurobiological problem, a brain disorder, or difficulty 
with stress.
 
 Specifically mentioning mental illness: Say that your loved one has a 
mental illness, a psychiatric disorder, or a mental disability.
 
 Giving the exact diagnosis: Say that your loved one has schizophrenia.
When your family is unsupportive
In most families, there is always at least one relative — if not more than 
one — who simply “doesn’t get it.” They don’t understand schizophrenia; 
don’t want to learn about it; and blame the victim for either being lazy or 
defiant. Alternatively, they blame the family — either a parent or a spouse — 
for driving the person “mad.” Or it may be a case of a grandparent or aunt 
who is in denial and tells you that your relative will “outgrow” whatever’s 
wrong.
Most people don’t full understand mental illnesses until they hit home. Their 
attitudes are usually driven by stigma, fear, or a lack of understanding. It may 
take time to engender support from your extended family. If your family isn’t 
immediately supportive, you may be fortunate enough to have close friends 
who better understand.
 
Even when they disappoint you, never give up on the people who truly 
matter to you — family or friends. Make it your job to teach them about 
mental illness.
Often mothers say that even their husbands are in denial and refuse to 
believe that their child has a mental disorder. For that reason, if you 
look around the room at any NAMI support group, you’re likely to see 
a preponderance of females over males. Perhaps, it’s because women are 
traditionally the caregivers in our society and more willing to share 
intimacies with friends, colleagues, and outsiders than are men.

223
 Chapter 11: Schizophrenia and the Family
 
When everyone isn’t onboard, this may make family gatherings awkward and 
dash expectations of having a “normal” family get-together, large holiday 
dinner or vacation. Here’s some advice for getting over the hump of such 
social occasions:
 
 Keep the size of gatherings small.
 
 Try to limit parties or events to people who are known to the person 
with schizophrenia.
 
 Never force the person with schizophrenia to participate in social 
events; offer it as an option.
 
 Speak to the person with schizophrenia so she knows what to expect 
before she arrives.
 
 Be sensitive to the fact that other people may not know what to say.
 
 Ask the host to let the other guests know that your loved one is shy, 
withdrawn, whatever — and may have a hard time in a large gathering.
 
 Encourage other guests to act warm and friendly but to not ask too 
many questions.
 
 Realize that the event may not go perfectly, but that’s okay. If you keep 
your expectations in check, you’re less likely to be disappointed.
Considering the Challenges of Caregiving
Schizophrenia, like other major mental illnesses, affects not just an individual 
but his entire family — parents, spouses, siblings, children, and grandpar-
ents. Except for the person with the illness, however, its effect is probably 
most profound on those who assume the mantle of caregiver(s).
The challenges that caregivers encounter vary depending on the severity of 
the illness and its symptoms. But especially at the beginning, caregiving can 
be totally consuming — affecting your work, finances, health, relationships, 
and almost every other aspect of your life.
Many families say that the hardest part of caregiving is emotional: Setting 
aside the dreams and expectations they once had of the individual with 
mental illness, and re-orienting themselves to a new reality. For example, 
parents may have to live with the realization that their straight-A student or 
standout athlete not only is no longer is at the top of his game — instead, 
he’s desperately in need of long-term psychiatric help.
When the caregivers are husband and wife, the tensions of living with a 
relative with schizophrenia can be so great that they challenge the marriage 
itself. Two parents may have different approaches to how the loved one’s 

224
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
illness should be handled, or one may be in total denial while the other 
is trying to deal with the reality. It’s estimated that one in five marriages 
become troubled (many leading to divorce) when a family member is 
diagnosed with a serious mental illness.
 
Mental illnesses, especially schizophrenia, are often accompanied by a loss 
of friendships for the person with schizophrenia. Your relative may come to 
rely on you for extra social support, either by phone or in-person. Provide it 
whenever you can while you encourage the individual to join peer groups, 
social clubs, and community organizations (see Chapter 12).
Accepting the job nobody wants
Whether your relative is your mother in mental decline with Alzheimer’s 
disease, your child with Down syndrome, or your life partner with schizo-
phrenia, no one signs up to be a caregiver for a person with special needs — 
it just happens. Family members assume the role of caregivers by default 
because society rarely provides any viable alternatives. The role is one that 
demands a tremendous investment of time and emotions.
When community supports are lacking, caregivers are thrust into the role of 
de facto case managers providing ongoing caregiving and oversight, as well 
as emotional and financial sustenance, for their loved ones. They may need 
to take time off from work to accompany their relative to medical appoint-
ments or to provide transportation to various social-service programs. They 
may need to suspend their own social lives as it becomes increasingly 
uncomfortable to entertain people at home or plan for dinners out because 
of the unpredictability of their lives. They may need to spend inordinate 
amounts of time talking to their relative on the phone, trying to dispel fears 
and misplaced anxieties. Or they may only be called upon to fill the void 
created by the loneliness common to people with schizophrenia who have 
trouble maintaining social relationships.
Professionals come and go over the years, but family members typically 
provide care that extends over decades — sometimes until death. Whether 
the ill person is a parent, a sibling, or a child, family members are always on 
call, literally and figuratively, whether their loved ones are living with them 
or living somewhere else. Consistently, family members describe the tension 
they feel each time the telephone rings. The call may come at work, while 
they’re on vacation, or in the middle of the night. It may be a call from a 
hospital reporting a psychiatric emergency involving their relative, a call 
from a law enforcement official, or incoherent rambling from their loved one.

225
 Chapter 11: Schizophrenia and the Family
Family members also have cause to worry when they don’t hear from their 
loved one. They wonder where the person is, whether she’s adhering to treat-
ment, and what she’s doing. It’s hard for caregivers to ever feel truly rested 
and relaxed because of the uncertainty of their lives and the unpredictability 
of the illness and its symptoms.
Staying home or coming home again
A person’s home is a safe haven — a refuge from the world where you can 
retreat and feel safely taken care of — and this is true whether you have 
schizophrenia or not. So it’s not surprising that a study by NAMI suggests 
that about four out of ten people with serious and persistent mental illnesses 
wind up living with their families. A study in New York State found that 
families provide more housing beds for people with mental illness than 
hospitals, adult homes, or nursing homes.
Often, you and your loved one with schizophrenia may have no viable 
alternatives but to live under the same roof for a substantial period of time. 
Sometimes people with mental illness never leave their parent’s home; 
other times, they return from college or remain at home long after their peers 
are working and living independently. For families, it can mean that a once-
empty nest is no longer empty. If the family has other young children who are 
still living at home, it can introduce conflict and chaos. A home that was once 
placid becomes filled with stress.
Chapter 12 provides some concrete strategies for minimizing stress in 
the home.
Remembering the demands 
and rewards of caregiving
The burdens of living with someone with schizophrenia can be overwhelm-
ing. When the illness hasn’t yet been treated, hasn’t been adequately treated, 
or is in its most acute stage, you may have to contend with a frightening 
constellation of unpredictable symptoms and behaviors.
One older mother told us of her terror, living with her son, a strapping young 
24-year-old man who weighed more than 250 pounds and who consistently 
threatened her. She feared for her safety each night, moving a bureau in front 
of her door before she went to bed. Sometimes, family members are victims 
of assault and abuse. Another mother told us of a daughter who threw plates 
at her and destroyed many of the decorative items in her living room when 
she flew into one of her frequent rages.

226
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
Other caregivers are challenged by their loved one’s illogical thoughts and 
behaviors. One mother told of her son who would take walks from one 
county to another until the soles of his shoes wore out. She was unable to 
convince him to curtail his travels and always worried that the phone would 
ring saying that he had been hit by a car or had gotten into trouble.
If someone is paranoid or suspicious, the tiniest comment can be misinter-
preted as an insult and provoke anger and rage. Periods of psychotic 
behavior can be interspersed with periods of lucid thinking, making it hard 
to adjust to the ups and downs of daily existence.
In addition, the caregiver has to make sense of a mental-health system that’s 
complex and often not user-friendly. With cuts in public funds at every level 
of government and pressure by private insurers to cut back on costs of 
medical care and medications, the system is trying to do more with less. This 
makes it difficult to access quality care, especially during crises.
Although the job may appear, at times, to be thankless, there are often 
rewards. With proper treatment, the acute symptoms are usually temporary. 
When caregivers see their loved one show signs of growing independence, 
clearer thinking, and diminished symptoms, the results are very gratifying. 
Many patients recover and exceed their family’s and even their doctor’s 
expectations.
Many times the relationship between the caregiver and the person with 
mental illness becomes reciprocal, with the person with schizophrenia 
helping around the house with routine chores and assisting in the care of 
their older parents.
Avoiding caregiver burnout
Because of the demands and stress of the job, caregivers are prime 
candidates for burnout. Some of the signs of burnout include
 
 Persistent feelings of exhaustion and fatigue
 
 Diminished interest in the things around you
 
 Free-floating anxiety
 
 Feelings of depression, isolation, and loss-of-control
When you get on an airplane, the safety instructions always suggest that 
parents put on their oxygen masks first before they do the same for their 
child. This also applies to caregiving. To perform adequately as a caregiver, 
you need to take care of yourself first if you want to be of any use to your 
relative. This requires, to the extent possible, that you find ways to identify 
and minimize stress.

227
 Chapter 11: Schizophrenia and the Family
Taking care of someone with schizophrenia, particularly when the individual 
is in the throes of psychosis (with disturbed, illogical or disorganized think-
ing) can be extremely draining. You may be tempted to drop everything 
around you and focus only on the illness, but you have to guard against this 
temptation. Find ways to pace yourself and set limits to how much you can 
or cannot do during the course of a day.
 
It never pays to be a martyr. Your resentment will seep out, even without your 
knowing. You’ll also be shortchanging the rest of your family. Here are some 
tips to reduce the stress of caregiving:
 
 Get regular exercise.
 
 Keep to a balanced, healthy diet
 
 Don’t shortchange yourself on sleep.
 
 Be prudent about maintaining your own physical health.
 
 Make time to nurture existing friendships.
 
 Build short breaks into your day and plan downtime over the course of 
the week.
 
 Plan respites or vacations from your caregiving responsibilities.
 
 Don’t hesitate to ask for help from others when you feel overwhelmed.
 
 Above all, continue to do the things that normally give you pleasure: 
Pursue your hobbies, go to the movies or theater, take a walk on a 
sunny day.
 
One of the best ways to avoid burnout is to bond with a friend in a similar 
situation who can truly understand what you’re going through. It’s likely that 
your peaks and valleys won’t occur simultaneously and that you’ll be able to 
provide support for each other at various times.
Most important, always remain hopeful and remember that, as bad as things 
may seem today, the crisis you’re experiencing now will eventually pass.
Keeping the Whole Family Safe
One of the myths associated with schizophrenia is that most people with 
schizophrenia are violent. This is far from the truth. In reality, people with 
schizophrenia tend to be the victims, rather than perpetrators, of violence. 
On the streets, they’re often perceived as vulnerable, easy targets.

228
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
However, this doesn’t mean that safety in the home should not be a concern 
or consideration. When someone with schizophrenia is actively psychotic — 
with unrealistic, delusional, or paranoid thoughts — she may pose a threat to 
other people in the family by her thought disorder. She may hear voices that 
tell her to harm someone around her or feel threatened for no valid reason 
and seek to retaliate.
The risks of violence increase:
 
 When mental illness remains untreated
 
 When the individual has a past history of violence and aggression
 
 When mental illness is complicated by use of alcohol and/or drugs
 
 When the person has hallucinations or delusions
 
You can, however, minimize the risk of violence in the home:
 
 Try to create predictable routines.
 
 Set up reasonable rules and limits for behaviors under your roof 
(for example, no loud music after 11 p.m., no use of drugs in the home, 
and so on).
 
 Set up appropriate and enforceable consequences when rules are 
broken.
 
 When an individual seems upset, try to diffuse rather than exacerbate 
his anger.
 
 Choose your battles; minimize confrontations on unimportant issues.
 
 Don’t get so close to the individual that she feels physically threatened.
 
 Separate the person from the illness. Don’t take offense from remarks 
that are clearly part of the illness.
 
 If you’re worried enough, lock your bedroom door at night.
 
 Don’t hesitate to get help when you need it in an emergency 
(see Chapter 14).
 
If you’re physically threatened or you truly feel that you, your relative with 
mental illness, or someone else in your home is in immediate danger, call 911 
and be sure to explain that the person has a serious mental illness.
 
Many times a written contract between you and your relative, agreed upon 
when the individual is stable, can help define boundaries and avoid 
arguments.

229
 Chapter 11: Schizophrenia and the Family
 
Many times a person with schizophrenia can appear menacing to an untrained 
or inexperienced police officer causing them to overreact with force. If you 
have any concerns that your relative may become dangerous, contact your 
local police department before an actual emergency. Explain that your loved 
one has a mental illness and is sometimes prone to odd or unusual behaviors. 
Explain that your relative isn’t dangerous but you want to be able to call upon 
them in case you need their help.
Siblings and Schizophrenia
The sibling bond is one of the longest and closest of any familial relationship 
because siblings tend to be closer in age and generally outlive their parents. 
So when one sibling is diagnosed with schizophrenia, regardless of her age, 
it has a profound effect on the other.
Keeping other kids in the loop
When any child is affected by a serious illness — be it cancer, autism, 
diabetes, or schizophrenia — it’s easy for parents to hover over that child 
and lose sight of the needs of the well siblings. This approach is problematic 
for the person with the illness, for the well sibling, and for the rest of 
the family. Families need to achieve balance in addressing everyone’s 
emotional needs.
Of course, sometimes the person with schizophrenia will require extra 
attention — but parents need to make sure that other siblings don’t feel 
neglected or ignored. Also, children are very perceptive when parents seem 
to be applying attention or even discipline unevenly. Being more attentive, 
or more lax, with one sibling than another can stir up resentment.
Young children, in particular, may feel jealous of the child or adolescent with 
the illness (who is the center of their parents’ attention) and also may be 
confused about why their sibling is acting strangely. It’s important for par-
ents to find simple ways to explain that their sibling is having some problems 
and that they’re seeking help from a counselor, doctor, or social worker to 
try to deal with them. Depending on the well sibling’s age, the message can 
even be more explicit and say that something is wrong with her brother’s 
brain (see the “Breaking the News to the Family” section, earlier in this 
chapter).

230
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
For example, the person with schizophrenia may be missing school, and the 
well sibling may feel jealous, resentful, or simply confused as to why the 
parents are allowing this to happen. Young children have an acute sense of 
fairness and are aware when they aren’t being treated equally.
In cases like this, it’s important for the parents to sit down with the well sib-
lings and explain that not going to school is not acceptable, in general, but 
that their sibling is unable to go because he’s sick. Also offer some words of 
encouragement — for example, saying that you hope that the child with 
mental illness will be feeling well enough to return to school after some 
weeks, months, or whatever and that you’re happy that the well child is able 
to attend school regularly.
Don’t saddle older siblings with more responsibility than they can handle. 
Although they may feel good about assisting their caregiver parents and may 
be very helpful, they shouldn’t be overwhelmed with responsibilities beyond 
their years.
 
Children are likely to identify more closely with an ill sibling who is of the 
same sex and close in age. Some well siblings are more likely to be adversely 
affected than others because they’re more sensitive, by temperament.
 
Sometimes well siblings are teased by other children because their ill sibling 
acts strangely or looks different. This can be very painful — but particularly 
during adolescence when there is so much emphasis on everyone conforming 
to their peers. Be alert to any signs of bullying or teasing of the ill or well 
siblings in your family so you can discuss or role-play strategies for handling 
them. Also be alert for any signs of depression.
 
Always be willing to answer questions and encourage your children to 
ask them.
Dealing with sibling fears
One of the most frightening fears of siblings is that the same thing will 
happen to them. Given that they share the same genetic pool and environ-
ment, their fears aren’t totally unfounded (see Chapter 2 for information on 
the genetics of schizophrenia). The child or adolescent may also be reluctant 
to discuss such fears with an already overburdened parent. If this is the case, 
it often helps for the well child to see a mental health counselor for support 
and reassurance. Sometimes, this can be handled by a guidance counselor or 
school psychologist in the child’s school. Before you take the chance, speak 
to the person yourself to make sure she’s up to the job.

231
 Chapter 11: Schizophrenia and the Family
 
Because schizophrenia causes ripples throughout a family, share information 
with your child’s teacher or school administration as appropriate and demand 
their assurance that it’ll be kept confidential.
Older well siblings share some of the same concerns as older parents. They 
wonder what their roles and responsibilities will be — emotionally, finan-
cially, and so on — when their parents die. Will they always have to care for 
the person with schizophrenia? Parents shouldn’t pressure or draft a well 
sibling into service for their ill relative. Each sibling needs to determine the 
extent of their involvement on their own.
As they embark upon careers and move to independence, some well siblings 
will follow the model set by their parents and become active caregivers of 
their siblings. In fact, many become healthcare professionals. Others may 
decide that they need to leave their sibling with mental illness behind. It’s 
very common for well siblings to enter helping professions as a way to give 
back less directly. Open discussions, family meetings, or meetings with 
mental-health professionals can help siblings allay these anxieties — some of 
which may be valid and others of which aren’t — and to make considered 
decisions about caregiving.
When a Spouse or Partner 
Has Schizophrenia
Any type of serious problem — medical, financial, legal — can create a wedge 
between spouses or life partners. This is especially true when one partner is 
diagnosed with a serious mental illness like schizophrenia. Although it’s far 
more common for schizophrenia to surface in younger adults, the symptoms 
can become manifest when people are older, before or after they marry.
 
Because men with schizophrenia become ill earlier than women, they’re less 
likely to marry than are women. In fact, only about one in four men with 
schizophrenia ever marries. Women are more likely to marry — some reports 
suggest that as many as 70 percent of them do. Unfortunately, separation and 
divorce rates are higher among people with schizophrenia than among the 
general population, for both sexes.
The impact of schizophrenia on a marriage depends on the severity of 
the illness, its duration, its responsiveness to treatment, and the ability 
of the two partners to communicate and cope.

232
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
Considering whether you 
can still be a couple
Schizophrenia can challenge many aspects of a partnership. Depending on 
the severity of the illness and whether the symptoms ebb and flow, a spouse 
or partner with the illness may have a hard time maintaining emotional 
intimacy, providing financial stability, or participating in social events. The 
well partner may feel shackled with responsibility as the primary caregiver 
and breadwinner for everyone in the family, including children, and may feel 
more like a parent than a spouse or partner.
Many spouses and partners, because of religious or spiritual reasons, or out 
of pure love and admiration, have met these challenges and provide ongoing 
support to their spouse. The relationship may be different than many more 
conventional ones, but both partners may say that they would never trade 
places with anyone else for a moment.
Well partners should make every effort to build upon the strengths of their 
mate, allowing the individual to handle any responsibilities the person is 
capable of. For example, if a wife is working full-time and her ill husband is 
left at home, he should pitch in with childcare and some of the household 
chores. The couple should also try to engage in some normal activities — 
going out to dinner together or going to a movie. The well partner should 
also make sure that children show equal respect for both parents.
Helping your kids understand 
what’s happening
Children need to be given age-appropriate information about their parent’s 
illness. They probably already realize that something is wrong with their 
parent; she may act differently than other mothers, or he may not go to work 
like other fathers. In some cases, there is an unusual role reversal where even 
very young children begin to “parent” their parents.
Other times, children don’t realize that something is wrong because they 
think that everyone else’s parents are “quirky” as theirs, because their 
experience outside the home is so limited. They may mistake symptoms for 
an unusual personality type (for example, a drama queen). Or they simply 
may be aware that something is wrong, but be unable to articulate their fears 
and concerns.

233
 Chapter 11: Schizophrenia and the Family
Younger children
When children approach school age, they may find that other kids tease 
them about their parent’s odd behaviors or dress. As soon as children are 
old enough to understand, they need to be told that their parent has a 
problem with his thoughts, emotions, or behaviors; that their parent still 
loves them very much; that their parent is doing the best job possible; and 
that the well parent will make sure they’re safe and well taken care of.
The well spouse also needs to make sure that the parent with schizophrenia 
is truly able to parent and manage the stresses that childcare entails. 
Another relative may have to step in to help with childcare, homework, gro-
cery shopping, or carpooling when the illness is at its worst.
 
If you have any concerns about neglect, abuse, positive symptoms, or illicit 
substance use that are affecting a child, bring those concerns to the attention 
of your loved one’s doctor immediately or to an appropriate social services 
agency if there is imminent danger.
Older kids
As children become adolescents and young adults, they may begin to feel 
angry or bitter about what they may have missed because of the illness. They 
may feel that they weren’t properly parented, that the illness limited their 
interactions with other children, or that their family never had traditional 
celebrations or vacations like other families. They may have been cheated 
out of a part of their childhood or told lies that now lead them to mistrust.
They may also worry about whether the same thing — experiencing the 
symptoms of schizophrenia — will someday happen to them. Even before 
these signs become evident, and in the absence of adjustment problems, it’s 
helpful to find a mental-health counselor to help the young person come to 
grips with the complex challenges of having a parent with schizophrenia.
Working Collaboratively 
with Professionals
Unfortunately, even some healthcare practitioners view families as part of 
the problem rather than part of the solution. Old theories die hard; they 
blame families for the illness or for exacerbating its symptoms. As a result, 
these doctors, psychologists, social workers, or other mental-health workers 
may limit communication with family members or fail to listen to them 
(which means they don’t benefit from the information only families can 
provide).

234
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
It’s extremely useful for professionals to receive feedback from family mem-
bers (in addition to the person with schizophrenia) about how the person is 
functioning in real life, outside of the office setting where the individual is 
only seen for a relatively brief period of time. This will help a psychiatrist 
more accurately determine whether medications are working, whether side 
effects are emerging, and determine when changes in medications or dosing 
are in order.
Don’t wait until you’re asked to become involved. Family members need to be 
proactive in communicating that they want to participate as a member of the 
treatment team:
 
1. Ask for the name of the person who’s responsible for your loved one’s 
care.
 
2. Request an initial meeting with that person.
 
3. Indicate that you have valuable information about your loved one’s 
history of symptoms and treatments, what worked and what didn’t, 
which you’re happy to provide.
 
4. Make sure that you come away from your initial meeting with a clear 
understanding of your loved one’s diagnosis, plan of treatment, and 
prognosis, even if you have to be very firm in making the request to 
ensure that you do.
 
5. Find out how the professional would like you to communicate with 
each other on an ongoing basis.
 
If the professional is reluctant to provide you with information and hides 
behind the mask of confidentiality, ask your loved one to sign a release 
providing his consent to have the doctor communicate with you. Even if your 
loved one is unwilling to provide consent, there is no breech of confidentiality 
in your providing information to the doctor (see Chapter 14).
Planning for the Future
One of the most persistent themes we hear from families is their worry about 
what will happen when they’re gone. This is extremely difficult because it 
means facing one’s own mortality and the fear of possibly not living long 
enough to see your loved one reach the stage of recovery you had hoped for.
As parents age, their energy, abilities, and resources to care for a relative 
with mental illness may diminish. They may be entering a time of life when 
they begin developing chronic health problems of their own. Living on fixed 
incomes, they may also have less funds available to support their loved one 
with schizophrenia.

235
 Chapter 11: Schizophrenia and the Family
If you have a relative with a serious, long-term, and disabling illness of any 
kind, including schizophrenia, you need to plan for the future. A number of 
nonprofit organizations assist families in planning for health insurance, 
powers of attorney, guardianship, healthcare proxies, supplemental needs 
trusts, housing, and other critical legal and financial issues that need to 
be addressed. Depending on the family, parents, grandparents, siblings, or 
children may be the ones involved in future care planning (see Chapter 7).
 
NAMI has been actively involved for many years in developing Planned 
Lifetime Assistance Network (PLAN) programs to meet the needs of families 
with adult children. Currently there are 23 such programs in operation in 18 
states. To find out more about these programs and other options, contact the

here’s no instruction manual for helping a loved one with schizophrenia 
live as normal and productive a life as possible. Although books like this 
one are invaluable, most of the skills necessary to cope with schizophrenia 
are learned through on-the-job training — for both the family and the person 
with schizophrenia. It’s definitely not easy with a disease as baffling to under-
stand, frightening to witness, and challenging to treat as schizophrenia.
The challenges of integrating a person with schizophrenia into both the family 
and into the community can be stressful, depressing, and anxiety-provoking 
for everyone involved. In this chapter, we focus on coping skills that will ben-
efit both caregivers and patients in learning to live the best life possible with 
schizophrenia.
Helping Your Loved One Live with Others
Schizophrenia’s impact often extends far beyond the individual directly 
affected by the illness. As with many mental illnesses, schizophrenia leads to 
behaviors that make it difficult for the individual to fit into not only the 
family, but also the community at large. Because schizophrenia is a poorly 
understood, and often feared, diagnosis, educating not only yourself and 
your loved one, but everyone else who comes in contact with your loved one 
can be a big part of your job.

238
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
 
Keep in mind the following:
 
 Chronic mental illnesses affect more than one person. Schizophrenia 
creates collateral damage and is likely to have implications for the whole 
family (parents, spouses, children, siblings, grandparents, uncles, aunts, 
cousins, and so on), as well as friends, acquaintances, co-workers, and 
classmates. This leads to stress for the whole family.
 
 Brain disorders affect every aspect of life. Any brain disorder can 
have a profound effect on health, employment, finances, social ties, and 
relationships.
 
 Schizophrenia requires a long-term mindset. Part of coming to terms 
with the illness (see Chapter 11) is realizing that schizophrenia isn’t a 
one-time illness; it requires the support of family and friends over the 
long haul. It also means that your job as teacher, cheerleader, and 
community liaison for your loved one is never done — new situations 
requiring new learning skills and new coping mechanisms will continue 
to arise.
 
 The stresses you feel as a caregiver will change over time. The period 
before and soon after diagnosis is often the toughest on caregivers.
In this section, we show you ways you can help both your loved one and 
yourself cope with the stress of living within a community, any community — 
whether it’s a family unit or a city — when you’re dealing with schizophrenia.
 
You don’t need to reinvent the wheel. People who have been there before you 
(other consumers, family members, friends, and professionals) have practical 
advice to share. Don’t hesitate to draw upon their experiences to make your 
own less stressful.
Understanding the unique stress 
factors of mental illness
Any chronic disorder causes stress, but mental illnesses like schizophrenia 
come with their special stressors, which require special coping mechanisms:
 
 The disease usually has a long-term chronic course. Schizophrenia 
can be managed and controlled but not cured, which means that you 
and your loved one are going to have to deal with schizophrenia for a 
lifetime — a daunting thought under the best of circumstances.
 
 People with the disorder often lack insight into their own illness and 
may be their own worst enemies. They may not recognize that they’re 
sick and need help.

239
 Chapter 12: Developing Coping Skills
 
 Your loved one will likely have to take medication for a long time, 
if not for the rest of his life. Some people resent this constant reminder 
of their illness and experiment with changing doses, going on self-
proclaimed “drug holidays,” or going off medication altogether with 
grave consequences.
 
 More than medication alone is necessary to enhance a person’s sense 
of self-esteem and ability to function. This means that either you or 
your loved one will have to find, pay for, and coordinate a range of 
treatment, basic services, and supports.
 
 The ups and downs of the illness make its course and your life unpre-
dictable. Things can be going along fine, and then they’re suddenly 
derailed. This leads to anxiety and worry about when the next shoe will 
drop and makes it hard for families to plan ahead, even something as 
simple as taking a vacation.
 
 Crises will occur; although many can be avoided, some cannot. This 
inevitably leads to setbacks, frustration and disappointment.
 
 The apathy that often accompanies schizophrenia can be aggravating 
to others. You need to remember that your loved one isn’t simply being 
lazy or provocative — and keeping this in mind when you’re frustrated 
or at your wit’s end can be tough.
 
 Any serious illness is likely to take a toll on family life and causes 
disruptions. It may necessitate time off from work for doctors’ visits or 
hospitalizations and lost opportunities for participation in leisure and 
social pursuits.
 
 Professionals may care, but they tend to come and go; family is the 
most constant influence on the individual with schizophrenia, filling 
in the gaps whenever necessary.
Improving communication skills
Communicating with people who have schizophrenia is often difficult, for a 
number of reasons. Here are some of the main barriers you may encounter:
 
 Your loved one may be fearful of you (because of suspiciousness or 
paranoid thinking) and, therefore, may not want to communicate.
 
 She may be too sleepy — because of medication side effects — to listen 
or to speak.
 
 Your loved one may not hear what you’re saying because he’s distracted 
by voices or other stimuli in the environment.
 
 She may not understand what you’re saying because of anxiety or 
difficulties processing information.
 
 Your loved one may not be able to act on what you’re saying because of 
lack of motivation or inability to carry through.

240
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
Each of these problems may make it hard to get your message across or to 
have a meaningful conversation. But communication is an essential part of 
life, and you need to find ways both to communicate directly with your loved 
and to help him communicate with the larger world.
 
Here are some techniques that have proven helpful under these circumstances:
 
 Remember that timing is everything. Try to approach your loved one 
when she’s most likely to be willing and able to communicate with you. 
Try to find a time when she’s relaxed, as opposed to upset, anxious, 
distracted, or angry — especially if you’re bringing something up that 
may be emotionally charged.
 
 Speaking about tough topics may be easier in the morning (when your 
loved one is rested and fresh) than it is at night (when she’s sleepy). 
Conversely, if she’s having a hard time getting up in the morning, it may 
be better to talk later in the day. Unsure? Ask your loved one when she 
would like to talk.
 
 Make sure you don’t talk too much. The amount of time that your loved 
one can comfortably tolerate is something you’ll have to gauge with 
experience.
 
 Respect your loved one’s body language. If he’s pacing, tapping his 
foot, or otherwise appears agitated, put off your conversation for 
another time. Instead, take a walk, take a drive, have a snack together, or 
watch TV.
 
 Pick your place. Because your loved one may have a hard time with 
competing stimulation, pick a quiet place with as few distractions as 
possible. Is he more comfortable talking at home, riding in the car, or sit-
ting on the grass at a park? Unsure? Ask him.
 
 Choose the right medium. Talking face to face may not always be the 
best way to discuss difficult topics. Talking on the phone or via e-mail 
may be easier and less stressful in certain instances.
 
 Tone is difficult to convey via e-mail, so make sure that you word your 
messages carefully so that they aren’t misinterpreted.
 
 Keep in mind that emotions run in two directions. If you’re the one 
who’s upset or emotionally charged, it may not be a good time for you 
to begin a conversation. For example, if you found that your loved one 
did something that sabotaged his job and you feel furious, wait until you 
calm down a bit to find out more about what happened and why before 
starting a heated argument about it.
 
 If you begin talking and the person gets very upset or things don’t go 
smoothly, think about stopping the conversation and picking it up again 
when you’ve both had a chance to simmer down. Say that you’re sorry 
to have upset him, that you don’t think it’s a good time to talk, and that 
you’ll talk about it again at another time.

241
 Chapter 12: Developing Coping Skills
 
 Keep it simple. Try to be brief, clear, and direct. This is no time to use 
ten-dollar words. You want to make sure you’re getting your point 
across. Try to keep you discussion simple by expressing or responding 
to one idea at a time.
 
 Don’t automatically assume that your loved one understands you. She 
may not be getting what you’re saying (or may not really be aware of 
what you’re saying) but doesn’t want to admit it. If you aren’t sure 
you’re getting through, repeat what you said a different way, or ask your 
loved one to restate what you said in her own words.
 
 Be respectful of your loved one. Whether the individual with schizo-
phrenia is younger or older than you, treat him as an individual worthy 
of respect. Try not to sound demeaning or overly critical, or to act in a 
patronizing manner. For example, don’t scold your adult daughter in the 
tone of a voice you would use for a toddler. Don’t treat the person as if 
she were mentally deficient, and don’t say things that are rude, abusive, 
or hurtful. Never make fun of the person’s illogical thinking. When 
someone is upset, he isn’t likely to understand humor.
 
 Because a person with schizophrenia may be very sensitive, if you have 
something critical to say, be careful not to say it in front of other people 
who don’t need to hear it.
 
 Be an enabler (in a good way). When you think that your loved one 
wants to say something and is having a tough time expressing it, openly 
ask if he wants to tell you something. He may just need your help in 
starting the conversation. One way of doing this is to ask simple ques-
tions, modeling what the person may want to say, to see if he responds. 
You could say, “I think you’re disappointed about not getting that job 
you wanted so badly, aren’t you? But maybe it really wasn’t a good fit.” 
Just make sure you don’t fall into the role of an interrogator or put 
words in the person’s mouth.
 
 Be honest but supportive. If your loved one has done something that 
you disapprove of (for example, dropping out of a job-training program 
or deciding to stop taking a necessary medication), you need to be 
candid about your disappointment but also understanding and support-
ive. For example, you might say, “I’m sorry that you weren’t able to 
continue attending the program, but I hope you’ll feel better about going 
next week” or “I think that the lithium really helped manage your mood 
swings, so I hope you’ll talk to your doctor about your decision to stop 
taking it.”
 
 Keep the lines of communication open. Remember the importance of 
maintaining an open relationship with your friend or relative. If you 
react too critically to what she says, you effectively cut off communica-
tion. After a conversation about difficult things, try to keep the 
communication light. Talk about movies, TV, sports, or anything she’s 
interested in that’s free of conflict.

242
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
Reducing stress
Stress takes a toll on anyone’s physical or mental health, but it can be partic-
ularly toxic to a person diagnosed with schizophrenia: Too much stress can 
worsen symptoms or even precipitate relapse. Although it’s impossible to 
eliminate all stress, reducing stress whenever possible will make your life 
and your loved one’s easier in the long run. Identifying stressors and giving 
your loved one tools to reduce stress will pay dividends for everyone.
 
People with schizophrenia are likely to be sensitive, experiencing stress 
in situations where you might not. They also tend to react to stress in an exag-
gerated way. For example, even a minor change in your loved one’s schedule 
or environment can be a significant stressor. Anticipatory anxiety, such as 
having plans to go to dinner with a new friend, may make your loved one feel 
very nervous and anxious about what to say or what to do. Changing jobs, 
apartments, or therapists may throw him into a frenzy. Even sustained contact 
with another person for too many hours in a day may be hard for your loved 
one to bear. A trauma, such as the loss of a friend or the death of a parent, 
may be so stressful that it leads to severe depression or psychotic thinking.
Stress also takes its toll on caregivers, who are more likely to be depressed 
and have physical problems like diabetes and heart disease, than those who 
aren’t caregivers. Caregiving can be physically demanding and emotionally 
draining for people who are juggling multiple responsibilities — such as hold-
ing down a job, caring for children, and then also caring for a spouse with 
schizophrenia.
 
Signs of stress aren’t always obvious. Here are some indicators that your 
loved one (or you!) may be experiencing stress overload:
 
 Problems sleeping (either getting too little sleep or sleeping too much)
 
 Changed eating patterns (eating too little or too much)
 
 Irritability
 
 Anger
 
 Anxiety
 
 Sadness
 
 Fatigue (most of the time, as opposed to just occasionally or just at 
bedtime)
 
 Physical problems (like headaches, pains, or gastrointestinal problems)
 
 Loss of interest in things that are generally enjoyed (such as sex, 
socializing, and so on)

243
 Chapter 12: Developing Coping Skills
When one person in a family — or one person among a group of people who 
live or work together — is stressed, it’s likely to have a negative spill-over 
effect on the people around him. Conversely, relieving stress can have an 
exponential payoff — for more than one person.
 
You can control and minimize stress. Here are some ways to lessen stress — 
both for your loved one as well as for yourself:
 
 Set priorities. It’s easy for people with schizophrenia to feel over-
whelmed. This is particularly true after someone who has had an acute 
psychotic episode is just getting back to her normal activities, which 
may suddenly feel as difficult as climbing Mount Everest. Transitions of 
any kind can be especially stressful — moving to a new apartment, 
taking on a new job, adding new responsibilities to an old job.
 
 Some of the symptoms of schizophrenia make it hard to focus, making 
it especially important for your loved one to identify and order her 
priorities and stick to them.
 
 Written lists can be extremely helpful if your loved one has trouble 
remembering what she needs to do next or prioritizing. Suggest that 
she make a list of the things that need to be done, rank the items in 
order of priority, and cross off each task when she completes it. There’s 
something very satisfying about going down a checklist and marking 
things off! (If your loved one is comfortable with a computer, Web sites 
like Remember the Milk [www.rememberthemilk.com] can be helpful 
list-making and memory tools.)
 
 Help your loved one break big tasks into little ones so they don’t feel 
so overwhelming. For example, the first step to going back to school 
might be to take one class; the first step to getting back to work may be 
volunteering for a job; the first step to taking a shower may be picking 
out clothes to wear; and the first step to making a friend may be learning 
how to smile when you meet someone new.
 
 Caregivers often feel stressed when they fall into the trap of thinking 
they can do it all. Chapter 11 provides some tips for avoiding caregiver 
burnout.
 
 Get physical. Exercise and physical activity help reduce stress. Make 
sure that you and your loved one are both getting regular exercise. If 
your loved one has no motivation to exercise, find ways to be encourag-
ing. For example, suggest taking regular walks together or give her a 
gift of membership in a health club or gym. Even owning a dog can 
encourage people to get outdoors and get moving.
 
 Get a pet. A number of studies have shown that having a pet can reduce 
stress — spending time with animals is associated with decreases in 
heart rate as well as blood pressure. For people with serious mental 
illnesses, pets also provide the benefit of companionship and help ward 
off loneliness.

244
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
 
 Having a pet entails responsibility so this needs to be factored into 
the equation. If a dog or cat is too much of a hassle to care for, similar 
benefits can be achieved by keeping an aquarium with fish. Or maybe 
your loved one can volunteer at a local animal shelter — he’ll get the 
dual benefits of spending time with animals and easing back into 
the workforce through volunteering.
 
 Take a deep breath. Meditation, breathing exercises, and yoga can help 
reduce stress. These activities lower the heart rate, slow down breath-
ing, and lower blood pressure — all of which make you feel calmer and 
less stressed. Because they aren’t treatment per se, they’re socially 
acceptable, come without a stigma, and offer opportunities for meeting 
new friends.
 
 Laugh. Anything that produces a hearty laugh, like watching old sitcoms 
on TV (like I Love Lucy, Seinfeld, Friends, or Everyone Loves Raymond) 
can help reduce stress. Studies have shown that laughter can reduce 
certain stress hormones.
 
 Find a hobby. Whether it’s playing a sport, following a sports team, 
knitting alone or in a group, or going to the movies, finding something 
that interests you and keeps your mind off yourself and your problems 
is an excellent stress reliever.
 
 Try to plan and stick to a routine. Because people with schizophrenia 
often have difficulty adjusting to change, setting up a predictable routine 
so that things are done pretty much the same way and at approximately 
the same time each day is helpful. This is especially important for eating 
and sleeping. When changes to the routine are made, they should be 
done gradually.
 
 Mix it up occasionally. As comforting as routines may be, everyone 
seems to benefit from an occasional change. If you find that your loved 
one is feeling very stressed, think about how you can help her get 
“unstuck.” A mini vacation — like going for a ride in the country on a 
spring day or spending a day at the beach in the summer — may help 
reduce stress and restore equilibrium.
 
 Allow for a “bad hair day.” Things happen that can throw someone off 
kilter, and they have nothing to do with the person’s illness. A coffee 
spill on a new suit, a supervisor who came to work angry, or a bus that 
come late and resulted in a missed therapy appointment. Make allow-
ances for stuff that happens.
 
 Treat it. If other more conservative approaches to managing stress don’t 
seem to work, you may want to consult your loved one’s psychiatrist, 
therapist, or case manager. In fact, in the best of circumstances, they’ll 
recognize it before you do.
 
 Stress often manifests itself as anxiety. If your loved one appears to be 
uncontrollably anxious, it may be a side-effect of one of the medications 
he’s taking.

245
 Chapter 12: Developing Coping Skills
 
 If it isn’t a medication side effect, the doctor may want to add an anti-
anxiety drug to control anxiety. Talk therapies (see Chapter 9) may also 
be helpful in teaching your loved one techniques to lessen anxiety.
 
 Check in periodically. Like anyone else, people with schizophrenia may 
not always realize when they’re feeling overly stressed. If your loved one 
lives under your roof, you may periodically ask her how things are 
going. If she lives elsewhere, call to check in on how she’s feeling. On 
special days when a person may be more stressed (such as Christmas, 
anniversaries of deaths, birthdays), be preemptive in making sure your 
loved one has a good plan for how to handle the day. Just talking to 
another person about the sources of stress may lighten the load.
Setting realistic limits
Whenever two or more people live together, whatever their relationship, 
there needs to be some discussion, and probably some negotiating, to ensure 
that one person doesn’t overstep another’s boundaries. This is especially 
true when one of the people has schizophrenia, because the symptoms and 
behaviors associated with the illness often magnify the challenges.
 
It’s better to have a clear-cut set of limits and boundaries in place before 
problems occur than it is to try dealing with issues as they arise. The time to 
sit down and go over rules is when everyone is in a receptive mood, thinking 
clearly, and able to comprehend what’s being said.
 
Writing out the rules in a type of “contract” can be helpful. Putting the 
agreement in writing gives everyone an opportunity to go back and read it 
when things seem fuzzy.
Setting the rules
When it comes to setting rules, no answers are set in stone — every family’s 
tolerance for certain behaviors will be different. But to avoid constant 
conflict, and recurrence of the same circumstances over and over, you need 
to make sure that you, your loved one, and anyone else living in your home 
are on the same page when it comes to expectations.
 
The amount of structure needed will depend on how organized or disorga-
nized your loved one’s mind is at the time. Also, you may need to renegotiate 
rules as situations change, particularly during transitions (for example, when 
he returns from a hospital, jail, or rehab program). If your loved one is already 
living in the household, you may need to set new limits if there’s been a great 
deal of friction; some rules may need to be relaxed, and others may need to be 
tightened, to decrease conflict and stress.
When you’re coming up with your list of rules, you need to differentiate 
which ones are tolerable and which ones aren’t. Some of the areas to con-
sider on such a list are whether your loved one will:

246
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
 
 See a clinician regularly
 
 Take medication consistently
 
 Attend a program
 
 Apply for entitlements
 
 Attend school or go to work
 
 Have to maintain certain hygiene standards
 
 Dress in a particular way
 
 Contribute to the rent or other expenses
 
 Adhere to certain house rules
 
 Be allowed to smoke in the house or create a fire hazard
 
 Have access to a car or other means of transportation
 
 Help with certain household tasks or chores
 
 Keep certain hours
 
 Refrain from alcohol and/or drugs on or off premises
 
 Refrain from dangerous or assaultive behavior
 
Try not to concentrate exclusively on the don’ts. Phrasing things in a positive 
way, such as, “You will wear a shirt and pants in the house” may be more 
effective than saying, “No walking around in your underwear.”
Setting limits may be helpful even when you’re not living with your loved one. 
For example, are you willing to pay rent indefinitely for your loved one if 
she’s able but unwilling to work? Is your loved one allowed to come to your 
house and drop in unannounced?
 
An experienced therapist or case manager can be helpful in zeroing in on 
areas of difficulty that people typically encounter or on the pitfalls specific 
to your situation. Talk to your loved one’s therapist to avoid potential 
land mines.
 
You have rights but also responsibilities in terms of your agreement with your 
loved one, too. You need to give your loved one a voice in telling you some of 
her expectations, so the agreement isn’t a one-sided edict. Including your 
loved one in the discussion and listing your own responsibilities will help 
enhance her self-esteem, clarify areas that may be muddy, and increase the 
odds of sticking to her side of the bargain. Some issues that may arise in your 
discussions may include the following:
 
 How much privacy will you give your loved one in terms of access to her 
bedroom or access to the telephone or e-mail?
 
 Will you be open to your loved one’s friends visiting your home?

247
 Chapter 12: Developing Coping Skills
 
 Will you be willing to drive your loved one to work?
 
 Will you provide extra financial support?
 
 Are there other ways you can help enhance your loved one’s recovery?
As you make this list, you may realize that you need to set some boundaries 
in relation to your personal involvement. Realistically, what are you able and 
not able to do? For example, providing support and care to a loved one with 
schizophrenia may entail cutting back on your own hours at work. How many 
hours can you afford to lose without adversely affecting yourself or the rest 
of your family? Providing constant companionship to your relative may entail 
cutting back on your own friendships. How much are you willing to give up? 
Will devoting all your time to your loved one undermine the quality of your 
relationship with other relatives? When you think through these issues, 
you may need to find ways to offload some responsibilities to other family 
members, friends, or professionals.
Enforcing the rules
One of the thorniest issues arising in caregiving is the question of what to do 
when rules are broken. If the goal of the contract is to support your loved 
one’s recovery, you don’t want to throw him out on the doorstep except for 
the most serious offenses. It’s important to distinguish between rules that 
“would be nice” the rules that, when broken, are real deal-breakers with 
major consequences, such as removal from the house. Minor infractions 
call for a less-serious response (for example, reminders, reinforcements, or 
penalties), whereas serious infraction may demand medical and/or legal 
intervention.
Most families are (or should be) unwilling to tolerate the following behaviors 
in their homes:
 
 Assault: Your loved one is not allowed to physically harm you, and 
you’re not allowed to physically harm him.
 
 Persistent suicidal thoughts or gestures: If your loved one is talking 
about suicide or attempting suicide, you need to treat this as an 
emergency and insist that your loved one call his therapist or a suicide 
hot line (if the therapist is unreachable). See Chapter 14 for more 
information.
 
 Aggressive or violent behavior toward you or anyone else: If your 
loved one is aggressive or violent, you need to report this behavior to 
his clinician and possibly law enforcement.
 
 Abuse of property: For example, throwing or breaking furniture in the 
home is not allowed. In order to live in your home, your loved one must 
respect your property.

248
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
 
 Engaging in other dangerous, risky, or self-abusive behavior (for 
example, refusing to eat, driving erratically, and so on).
 
 Breaking the law: For example, if your loved one is using or selling illicit 
drugs, he’s not allowed to live in your home.
 
You can negotiate with someone who is relatively stable. But it’s probably 
useless to invoke punishments for breaking rules when someone is psychotic 
and out of touch with reality. In this case, the rules are completely different 
(see Chapter 14) and you probably need outside help — doctors, therapists, 
police — to help resolve the issue.
 
Consequences only work if they’re enforced. Don’t threaten consequences 
that are unenforceable. Thinking of rules and consequences beforehand can 
prevent you from making idle threats.
Recognizing the role of negative symptoms
Many of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (see Chapter 3) can lead to 
behaviors that drive you wild. Understanding obviously psychotic behavior 
is sometimes easier than it is to understand apathy, apparent laziness, and 
avoidance behaviors (being afraid or unwilling to engage in life) that, even in 
the good times, often accompany schizophrenia.
Your loved one may appear lazy but just may not have the energy or motiva-
tion required to get dressed or leave the house. He may be having problems 
comprehending the same work that came so easily before the breakdown. 
You need to carefully balance support and limit-setting — which is often 
difficult to do.
 
Try to not mete out punishments during a time of anger or say nasty things 
impulsively that you can’t take back. When rules are broken, try to use the 
modest approach in taking action — if your loved one purposely breaks a 
plate, tell her that she can’t stay in the kitchen, as opposed to telling her she 
can’t stay in the house. If your loved one isn’t taking his medication, tell him 
that he must speak to his clinician about it instead of saying he needs to be 
hospitalized. If you aren’t sure whether you’re being too strict or playing the 
role of a doormat, talk about it to a friend, relative, or health practitioner to 
gain some perspective.
Handling unrealistic thinking
Many times, a person with schizophrenia may say things that have no 
bearing in reality — statements that are so illogical that they leave you dumb-
founded as to what to say next. When this happens, your options are to

249
 Chapter 12: Developing Coping Skills
 
 Challenge or disagree with something that you know is blatantly 
unrealistic
 
 Totally agree and accept something that you know to be untrue
 
 Dodge the issue in some way
Only the last approach — dodging — is acceptable. Delusional thinking is 
virtually impossible to challenge or change. It’s based on a fixed belief that 
defies logic (see Chapter 3), and you’ll never convince the person about what 
is real and what isn’t. For example, if your loved one thinks that people in 
red cars are looking for him, nothing you can say can convince him other-
wise. In fact, challenging the statement is counterproductive. He’s probably 
frightened (hey, you would be, too, if you thought people were looking for 
you), and challenging him may simply make him agitated, angry, and more 
entrenched in his position. You also don’t want to reinforce delusional 
thinking by agreeing with it. In this case, your best bet is either to distract 
the person and talk about something else or just let it go.
 
It doesn’t hurt to find something to say in a reassuring manner to calm your 
loved one down and help him feel safe. For example, “The people in the red 
cars can’t see into our house, and we’re safe in here right now.” Another 
approach is to focus on the person’s feeling rather than the content. You can 
say, “I know you’re feeling very anxious, but I think the feeling will pass if I 
keep you company for a while.”
 
If a person is very fearful that harm is imminent, he may strike out at anyone 
who is perceived to represent a danger. Be careful, and take any threats 
seriously. Don’t take any chances involving your own safety, or that of your 
loved one or other family members. No one wants to call the police to calm 
down a loved one who is out of control, but sometimes it’s the more prudent 
course of action.
Be sure to distinguish between unrealistic thoughts and delusional 
thinking — the two demand different responses. How do you know the 
difference? As you get to know your loved one with schizophrenia, you can 
sense the difference between the two. Delusional thinking is more fixed, 
impermeable, and isn’t likely to change no matter what you say.
When a person is just thinking unrealistically (as opposed to having delu-
sions), you can ask pertinent questions or raise alternative explanations 
to help her think more clearly. For example, if your loved one thinks that 
starting a small business is easy and anyone can do it, that’s a naïve belief, 
not a delusion. You can provide her with information about the proportion 
of small businesses that go under, and she may be stubborn, but she’ll 
probably be open to hearing what you have to say.

Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
Defusing conflicts
Arguments, disagreements, and conflicts are inevitable, even when things are 
going fairly well. When disagreements arise, you need to give your loved one 
ample opportunity to speak and tell his side of the story and allow him to 
hear yours. When people have the opportunity to talk things out calmly and 
feel that their side is being heard, it often diffuses anger and leads to quicker 
resolution without making the situation worse.
 
Never make the mistake of presuming that the other person’s point of view 
isn’t valid just because the person has schizophrenia. Listen carefully to hear 
what your loved one is trying to say and make sure you get it right. You can 
do this by repeating it back so the other person can hear how his side of the 
argument sounds to you. This strategy will help the other person recognize 
that, even if you don’t agree, his point is being heard. It can also provide an 
opportunity to validate his feelings. For example, you can say, “I know you’re 
very angry that I’m not allowing you to use my car, but I can’t afford the cost 
of the gas or additional insurance for another driver right now.” This example 
validates what the person is feeling and also provides an explanation for the 
basis of the disagreement.
In some instances, consistent disagreements or very intense conflicts over 
little things may suggest that an individual is having symptoms like anxiety, 
which should be discussed with a clinician.
 
Some situations can lead to the potential for an explosive and potentially 
dangerous situation. Try to recognize the early signs of a conflict and act 
quickly but calmly to defuse the situation. If your loved one appears to be 
menacing, try to deescalate the conflict until things calm down or you can get 
help. Here are some strategies for defusing the situation:
 
 Don’t shout. Speak calmly and softly.
 
 Don’t touch or threaten your loved one. Keep a respectful distance and 
tone of voice.
 
 Avoid continuous eye contact, because that can be construed as 
threatening.
 
 Don’t wave your finger or point at your loved one.
 
 Try to distract your loved one with something else. If that doesn’t work, 
stick to the topic at hand and don’t bring up conflicts from the past.
 
 Never challenge or dare the person to defy you.
 
 Minimize critical remarks.

251
 Chapter 12: Developing Coping Skills
 
 Comply with any requests that are safe and reasonable.
 
 If you feel like your own safety is compromised, make that known and do 
what you have to do to keep yourself safe.
 
If your loved one has a prior history of self-destructive behavior, you may 
want to encourage her — while she’s well (and rational) — to use an advance 
directive that will provide guidance about how she should be treated when 
she’s ill and irrational (see Chapter 7).
Handling Troublesome Behaviors
Living with someone who has schizophrenia can be extremely disruptive 
on a number of fronts. You may have to cope with sleepless nights, scuffles 
with the law, or embarrassing behaviors in front of family, friends, or 
neighbors, to name just a few issues.
Sleep disturbances
Many people with schizophrenia, as well as those with schizoaffective 
disorder (see Chapter 3), have sleep issues. Some of these problems may be 
related to the illness itself; others may be related to medication. Research 
suggests that these impaired sleep patterns are associated with impaired 
ability to cope, both socially and vocationally.
Your loved one may sleep too much, which may lead you or your family mem-
bers to believe that she’s lazy or not meeting her responsibilities. Conversely, 
your loved one may have insomnia and pace the floors all night, listening to 
TV or loud music — interrupting the sleep of you and everyone else in the 
household.
If your loved one has problems getting asleep or staying asleep, and the 
problems are only occasional, they may be stress-related. Getting more exer-
cise, keeping regular hours, practicing relaxation techniques, and avoiding 
caffeine may help.
If your loved one is up all night with manic energy or has reversed night and 
day, psychotic symptoms may be keeping him awake. If sleeping problems 
persist more than a few days, tell your loved one’s clinician. Changing medi-
cation, the dose of medication, or adding a sedative may rectify the problem 
fairly rapidly.

252
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
Bizarre behaviors in public
Some people with schizophrenia may look and behave differently from other 
people. Often, the faces of people with schizophrenia have a recognizable 
flat expression that makes it appear as if they aren’t experiencing any normal 
emotions. Over the years, either because of the illness or because of power-
ful medications, they may also develop peculiar gestures or odd movements.
Many people with schizophrenia also neglect personal hygiene, have poor 
grooming habits, or have a lack of insight into or concern about how their 
appearance is perceived by others. Some of these characteristics are tied to 
negative symptoms of schizophrenia (see Chapter 3).
Some psychosocial rehabilitation programs focus on providing practical 
instruction to people with schizophrenia on how to better take care of their 
appearance. This might include teaching a woman how to apply makeup or 
teaching someone how to dress for an interview or for a date.
Depending on whether the illness is stabilized, your loved one may say or 
do inappropriate or embarrassing things in public settings — for example, 
urinating on a lawn when a bathroom isn’t accessible or taking something 
from a store without paying. When these behaviors occur, it’s usually a 
symptom of the illness rather than a reflection of the person’s character or 
personality. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help a person with schizophre-
nia learn how to behave more normally in common social situations.
 
It’s important to help define and redefine boundaries. You need to distinguish 
between public behaviors that are merely embarrassing and those that may 
be dangerous and illegal. Talk with your loved one beforehand about which 
behaviors are acceptable, which aren’t, and why.
 
Before attending a potentially stressful social event, you and your loved one 
may want to role-play the situation so he has clear expectations about what 
to expect. Talking through the sequential steps that will occur can lessen 
stress and symptoms. For example, if you’re going to a wedding ceremony in a 
church, you can say that you’re taking a 20-minute drive to the church and 
that the ceremony and mass will last about 45-minutes and that you’ll be going 
home after that.
 
Give your loved one a means of escape if too much tension builds up. Plan in 
advance how she can manage her stress without acting up or acting out. For 
example, in the case of the church wedding, you might tell your loved one that 
if she’s feeling very anxious, she should walk outside to the garden and you’ll 
meet her there as soon as the ceremony is over.

253
 Chapter 12: Developing Coping Skills
Bizarre behaviors can be mortifying, but the person with schizophrenia often 
can’t help his behavior. In embarrassing situations, you have to remember 
that you love this person, you want him to be able to enjoy as normal a life as 
possible, and that most people are going to recognize that there’s a problem 
and not be too harsh in their judgment of you or your loved one. If you think 
others may not be aware of your loved one’s situation, letting them know 
about your loved one’s illness before the event can go a long way toward 
fostering empathy and understanding.
Fostering Independence
When an adolescent or young adult is struck with schizophrenia, the illness 
often interferes dramatically with the normal progression into independent 
adulthood. It may interrupt the person’s schooling, interfere with her ability 
to form social relationships with peers, or limit her opportunities to find and 
keep a job. Given these barriers, it’s easy for a person with schizophrenia to 
fall back on family and remain dependent on them.
Families, friends, and clinicians need to help people with schizophrenia 
be as independent as possible in making decisions and controlling the way 
they live their lives. Helping your loved one find activities that build his 
self-esteem and give him a sense that he can succeed is invaluable. Limit 
criticism and heap on praise for things well done — this can encourage your 
loved one to try new things and master them.
If you find that your loved one is consistently asking others to help do things 
he can do himself, you may be (unintentionally) fostering his dependence 
and inadvertently impairing his ability to do things on his own. Sometimes, 
therapists can help you see these patterns when they’re not obvious to 
you. Even in the best of circumstances, the natural instinct of families is to 
protect — and often to overprotect. Although you don’t want to do a dra-
matic about-face in your relationship style (which could be upsetting to 
your loved one), you can encourage him to participate in self-help and peer-
support groups to gain self-confidence and acceptance. Increased awareness 
of your role in fostering your loved one’s independence, combined with 
taking small steps, can result in big changes over time.
 
Conflicts about who decides how money is spent are common. People with 
schizophrenia see money as a sign of their autonomy, while families often 
worry about whether the person will spend responsibly if she doesn’t know 
how to save or budget. Use of allowances, entitlements, or job earnings is a 
topic that can be discussed with therapists to avoid conflict and promote 
independence.

Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
Politically correct terminology
People are sensitive to the words used to 
describe mental illnesses — and for very good 
reasons. Words like crazy, mental, and nutcase 
were and are used to dehumanize and stereo-
type people with mental disorders.
Plus, sensationalistic and often inaccurate 
newspaper headlines make it appear as if 
people with mental disorders are solely respon-
sible for the most heinous of crimes. Until the 
last decade, the media created such a sense of 
shame that people were afraid to talk about 
mental illness. People with these disorders 
were shunted aside, warehoused in large 
mental institutions far away from their homes, 
families, and neighbors.
Although there is growing acceptance of mental 
illness, discrimination is still rife in employment, 
housing, and insurance (see Chapter 15). For 
this reason, anyone touched by mental illness 
needs to educate others to use the right words, 
as well as to do the right thing when dealing 
with people with schizophrenia. With persis-
tence, doing so will lead to a change of attitudes 
in the next generation.
Here are some of the terms that should not be 
used:
  The schizophrenic: Doctors and other med-
ical personnel have long fallen into the bad 
habit of referring to people by their dis-
ease, such as “the cardiac in Room 4” (to 
refer to a person having a heart attack). 
Schizophrenia is the name of a disease, and 
schizophrenic should always be used as an 
adjective rather than a noun. Referring to 
someone as a person with schizophrenia is 
less demeaning, as well as more accurate.
  Crazy, mental, nuts, loony, bananas, or nut-
case: These demeaning terms — and 
others like them — have no place in any-
one’s vocabulary. If you hear people using 
them, let them know that this is wrong and 
demeaning, and that you have a loved one 
with schizophrenia who deserves respect.
  Patient: People who are under a doctor’s 
care are generally called patients. But 
many people with schizophrenia are 
offended by this term because it casts them 
in the role of a patient rather than a person. 
Alternative terms like consumer, survivor, 
client, and recipient of care are preferred 
by many patients and former patients, but 
there’s no denying that these terms are still 
somewhat awkward to use and not univer-
sally understood by everyone. If you’re not 
sure what term will make someone feel 
comfortable, ask that person.

 Chapter 12: Developing Coping Skills
Seeking Support for You and Your 
Loved One with Schizophrenia
When mental illness first strikes, you experience a gamut of feelings — 
including fear, guilt, confusion, and loss. No family is ever adequately 
prepared to understand the strange symptoms of the disease that robs 
people of their personalities; the complex treatments that control symptoms 
but do not offer cures; or the fragmented and underfinanced service-delivery 
system that has gaping holes every place you turn.
Family-support groups, consumer-run programs, and peer support programs 
provide safe havens where people can talk to others who share their pain 
and problems. These groups have also provided a platform from which 
people continue to work collectively to change the face of mental-health 
research, treatment, and service delivery. Through participation in seminars, 
monthly meetings, speaker series, annual conferences, family-education 
courses, support groups, and a telephone help line, consumers and families 
no longer feel alone.
 
To find a support group in your area, contact the National Alliance on Mental 
Illness (NAMI) at 800-950-6264 or 703-524-7600. You can also go to www.nami.
org, and choose State and Local NAMIs from the Find Support drop-down list.

H
aving a stable place to live and call home — whether it’s an 
apartment, a private room in someone’s house, or a bed in a support-
ive residence — is such a profound human need that it’s one of the corner-
stones to recovery for people with schizophrenia.
Ideally, people with schizophrenia should be able to choose a home based on 
how it meets their preferences in terms of where, how, and with whom they 
want to live, something many people take for granted. However, for most 
people with serious mental illnesses — in most communities across the 
nation — housing choices are either limited or, more often, nonexistent. 
Either choices are made for them (by others) or choices are made impossible 
by virtue of the scarcity of available housing options.
In this chapter, we look at the various housing options open to people with 
schizophrenia, from living at home to living in a group home, and help you 
find solutions that will work for everyone involved.
Recognizing the Challenges 
in Finding Housing
Finding a place to live can be one of the most difficult challenges in life for 
people with schizophrenia. Most people with disabilities live on limited 

258
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
and/or fixed incomes. Plus, the stigma and discrimination associated with 
schizophrenia compound the problem of finding housing and earning a living 
wage — especially if the individual has or has had a co-occurring substance 
abuse problem, has ever been involved with the law, has had tenant-landlord 
problems in the past, or needs to be hospitalized for an extended period 
of time.
When there are no viable alternatives, many people with untreated schizo-
phrenia end up homeless, winding up in hospitals, in jails, in shelters, or on 
the streets.
In the following sections, we cover some of the challenges in finding housing 
for people with schizophrenia.
The financial cost
Many people with schizophrenia live on disability or on what they earn at 
minimum-wage jobs. This means that housing choices are extremely limited, 
especially if living at home isn’t an option.
The availability of affordable housing in the United States is nothing short 
of a national crisis. For the individual with schizophrenia, there is a huge 
gap between the cost of housing and disability income. According to one 
recent report, in 2006, the average income of an individual dependent on 
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) was $632 per month, while the average 
cost nationally to rent a one-bedroom or efficiency unit was $715 per month. 
Given other essential expenses, such as food, transportation, healthcare, and 
clothing, this puts conventional housing out of the reach of the average 
person with schizophrenia.
 
Most sources of funding for housing for people with schizophrenia fund 
programs rather than people. The exceptions are Section 8 certificates and 
rent vouchers that are available on a very limited basis from religious or non-
profit organizations. In addition, some private health insurance and disability 
policies may provide benefits for programs that provide residential treatment.
It may fall to parents or other relatives to bridge the gap in housing costs, 
subsidizing their loved one’s SSI with additional money to rent a suitable 
place. Some families set up special trusts so that their offspring inherits their 
home upon the death of both parents, to help keep the burden of support off 
other relatives when they’re gone.
The scarcity of subsidized housing
Although some housing is available at below-market rates, the units are so 
few in number and waiting lists so long that it has become discouraging for 

259
 Chapter 13: Housing Choices: Figuring Out Where to Live
people to even apply. For example, there are far too few Section 8 slots 
available for individuals with schizophrenia who are eligible; the average 
waiting time is almost three years!
To fill the gap, a number of substandard for-profit facilities exist in various 
communities, especially in high-cost cities with tight housing markets. 
Even though the cost of these facilities often taps a significant portion of 
an individual’s disability income, families recount their relatives living in 
rodent-infested buildings with numerous code violations, including leaks and 
insufficient heat and hot water.
Because of the lack of options, people often are forced to live where units 
are available. This may mean compromises in terms of the nature of the 
neighborhood; accessibility to services; and proximity to family, friends, 
and other natural supports.
Lack of continuity
A too-common scenario is that a person with schizophrenia moves in and out 
of his family home (after a squabble or hospitalization) or from one substan-
dard or inappropriate housing situation to another. This lack of continuity 
necessitates frequent changes in service providers and having to learn to 
negotiate new neighborhoods, one after another. Yet, people with schizo-
phrenia need stability; any lack of permanency in their living situation can 
have a negative impact on their psychiatric condition.
 
Sometimes people with schizophrenia are thrown out of housing settings 
because they’re deemed to no longer need services. Ironically, it may be the 
stability of their current housing situation that has helped them to stabilize.
Because housing is so scarce and expensive, people with schizophrenia find 
that shared living situations (or having roommates) is often the only way to 
make ends meet. It’s difficult for anyone to negotiate living in close quarters 
with a complete stranger, let alone someone with schizophrenia. As a result, 
the privacy of residents living together is often compromised, and tensions 
arise from living in close quarters with unrelated adults who share few 
common bonds besides their illness.
 
The availability of the right amount of support and supervision can make all 
the difference in an individual’s success or failure in community tenure. 
People with schizophrenia need varying degrees of support and supervision at 
various times. Resources (such as transportation and medical care) need to 
be accessible, and mental-health support services need to be able to respond 
flexibly based on a person’s needs.
There’s a great deal of controversy about whether housing should be contin-
gent on an individual’s willingness to accept services. Many consumers and 
some professionals see this as coercive and counterproductive to recovery.

260
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
 
Because of the gaps in housing and supports, many people with schizophrenia 
wind up inappropriately placed in more costly inpatient settings and local 
jails. A substantial number also join the ranks of the vulnerable homeless, 
living in shelters or on the streets.
Living at Home
Because of the scarcity of housing, many families pitch in to fill the gap, 
often at an extremely high cost — both financially and emotionally — to them 
and to their loved one. Parents or other relatives may offer housing to the 
individual in their own home or alternatively, support the cost of housing 
someplace else. Many people open their homes with justified trepidation 
about the potential conflicts of living under the same roof with their loved 
one with schizophrenia.
Understandably, living with relatives often precipitates or exacerbates con-
flicts in the household. This is especially true if the person with schizophre-
nia is an adult offspring living with one or more parents.
In many cases, parents are older and may have challenging chronic health 
problems of their own. They may also be facing financial problems: both in 
terms of declining incomes as they approach or have reached retirement, 
coupled with savings that have been sharply cut into after years of care-
giving for someone with schizophrenia. One 76-year-old woman we know 
struggles — financially, logistically, and emotionally — to take care of two 
sisters with schizophrenia on her own. She’s unsure how much longer she 
can continue without compromising her own health.
Moreover, because parents generally don’t outlive their offspring, this obvi-
ously isn’t a long-term solution, and the uncertainty can be unnerving. 
Parents worry about what will happen when they’re gone and what role other 
siblings will be pressed into playing in the future (see Chapter 11).
In rare instances, living at home works out well and is reciprocal for the 
person with schizophrenia and her family. No one feels burdened or put out 
by the arrangement. For example, we know an able-bodied young person with 
schizophrenia who is a wonderful support to his ailing mother who oversees 
his mental-health care and provides meals. But this should be a mutual 
choice, not a default because no other options exist.
 
Having a written list of rules to abide by can be very beneficial if you plan to 
live with your relative with schizophrenia. (See Chapter 12 for more on the 
issues that arise when people with schizophrenia live with others.) Keep in 
mind that caregivers should have rules to abide by as well. Just because 
someone’s living in your house, for example, doesn’t give you carte blanche 
to go through her things or get angry if he wants to go out with friends 
on weekends.

261
 Chapter 13: Housing Choices: Figuring Out Where to Live
 
If life were a fairy tale, we’d all live happily ever after, but it’s not. Sometimes 
keeping a person with schizophrenia becomes untenable. Any one of the 
following reasons can lead to a decision that your loved one needs to live 
elsewhere:
 
 The individual is threatening and represents a danger to himself or to 
other members of the family.
 
 The person has untreated substance abuse problems that require a dif-
ferent type of care and approach than you can provide (such as inpa-
tient detox).
 
 There are financial, social, and/or medical problems that make it prohib-
itive (for example, elderly parents dealing with a life-threatening illness).
 
 The illness is causing so much stress in the family that it’s highly disrup-
tive to relationships between spouses or parents and other children.
 
 The person with schizophrenia is unwilling to accept any treatment and 
is actively psychotic, leading to chaos in the household.
If you decide that it’s impossible for your loved one to live at home, expect 
to feel guilty, but don’t let it overwhelm you — or change your mind in a 
situation that you know is really impossible. In the long run, this decision will 
benefit you and your relative. Give yourself time to talk over the decision 
with other people you respect and who understand the situation.
Specialized Housing Options
If your loved one can’t live at home, and isn’t able to care for herself without 
help in her own place, you may need to look at specialized housing. 
Specialized housing for people with schizophrenia (generally subsidized by 
government or private-sector organizations) can take one of several forms:
 
 Housing programs for people with disabilities (including or limited to 
people with mental disorders)
 
 Mixed-used housing in the community (with units set aside for people 
with mental illnesses or other special needs)
 
 Scattered-site apartments or housing units for people with mental 
disorders that are fully integrated into the community
 
Nursing homes aren’t just for the elderly; people who need 24-hour skilled 
nursing care for any reason are eligible for nursing-home care. People with 
schizophrenia may have health needs in addition to schizophrenia that may 
make a nursing home a good fit. The downside: It may diminish opportunities 
for socializing with peers.

262
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
When you first start searching for care for a relative who is actively halluci-
nating or delusional, you may think that long-term hospitalization in a mental-
health facility is a logical choice. Although this was true several decades ago, 
it’s rarely an option today.
 
Long-term hospitalization isn’t an answer to the housing shortage. In fact, 
even as a treatment option, it’s being used less and less frequently because of 
changed philosophies of treatment and the rapid escalation in the costs of 
inpatient care. With the move toward treatment of schizophrenia in the com-
munity, state psychiatric hospitals have dramatically reduced their number of 
inpatient beds and reduced the length of stay of their patients accordingly. 
For someone to be hospitalized for a long time today, he would need to 
represent an ongoing danger to himself or others.
There are upsides and downsides to each of these options. Mixed-use or 
scattered-site housing generally is more integrated into the community as a 
whole, but specialized housing programs may be more helpful to people with 
serious mental illnesses. Additionally, such programs may provide greater 
opportunities for peer support.
Searching for housing
For a person with schizophrenia, finding a place to live is no easy feat. 
Eligibility and application requirements for affordable housing programs 
are often complex and difficult to understand. It requires a lot of legwork 
and networking with other people and organizations to find out what 
resources, if any, exist in the community. It may also entail signing up on 
long waiting lists.
Your loved one will likely need your help if he’s looking into housing pro-
grams. In fact, you may feel like you’ve taken on a full-time job — a frustrating 
one, because you’ll be dealing with government agencies much of the time — 
while assisting your loved one in finding housing.
 
Some of the community resources that may be of assistance in your search 
include the following:
 
 The local mental-health authority, which may directly sponsor housing 
units, contract out to other community organizations, or support 
services in housing operated by others
 
 The state mental-health authority or health department, which may 
license certain categories of housing within a state (for example, adult 
homes, board and care homes, or supportive housing programs)
 
 The local public housing authority or U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development (HUD) regional office, which may be aware of 
opportunities for low-income housing or HUD-supported programs

263
 Chapter 13: Housing Choices: Figuring Out Where to Live
 
 The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and other family 
organizations, which may be familiar with resources because of their 
experience with relatives living in these units or because they’ve heard 
about them from others
 
 Peers in day programs, social clubs, support groups, and treatment 
settings, who may be able to provide some housing leads
 
If you or your loved one is hospitalized, you need to start planning for his dis-
charge and where he’ll live almost from the time he’s admitted to the hospital. 
Given the length of waiting lists for various housing options, you may need 
both an interim plan as well as a long-term one. The hospital social worker or 
discharge planner may be able to help you get started.
Making sense of the options
When you’re buying a house, you learn to interpret the overly optimistic 
descriptions used to describe housing. A “fixer upper” is a house that’s fall-
ing off its foundations; “cozy” means the place is suitable only for one (very 
short) person. Unfortunately, it’s not so easy to decipher the terms used to 
describe housing for people with mental problems. The same terms (for 
example, transitional housing) may have different meanings and conditions in 
one state, community, or program than they do in another.
In the following sections, we look at terms commonly used and what they 
generally (if not always) refer to when searching for housing.
 
There is no commonly accepted typology (classification) of housing terms. 
They vary from state to state and sometimes from community to community. 
Supportive housing, for example, may have very different meanings in terms of 
the actual type of supervision provided.
Permanent versus transitional housing
Permanent housing means it’s your loved one’s for as long as he can pay 
the rent and uphold the conditions of his lease. The benefit of permanent 
housing is that it allows the person with schizophrenia to stay in a known 
setting, to find a place within the community, and to develop a sense of 
belonging and security. Because change and transition can be disconcerting 
for someone with schizophrenia, these are real pluses.
Permanent-housing programs may or may not require the resident to take 
advantage of treatment and support services as a condition of living there.
By definition, transitional housing is temporary and available only for a l
imited time. Usually, the expectation is that the person will “graduate” 
to permanent housing. Programs funded by HUD, for example, have a 
24-month limit.

264
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
Transitional programs are sometimes called halfway houses, because they 
provide care in between an inpatient stay and independent or supportive 
living in the community.
 
Transitional housing programs are generally intended for people who require 
services and support before they’re able to live independently, so there’s 
often a requirement that residents take advantage of the services they pro-
vide. These may include 24/7 assistance with the activities of daily living, 
vocational rehabilitation, medication management, social-skills training, 
provision of cafeteria-style meals, substance-abuse services, and so on.
Transitional housing can take place in a large congregate care setting (such 
as a community residence) or in a smaller group home that is shared by two 
or more unrelated adults who may or may not have their own bedrooms.
Supportive housing versus supported housing
Despite the name similarity, supportive housing and supported housing are 
two different things. In supportive housing units, a range of services are pro-
vided on-site and people live in close proximity with others who have been 
diagnosed with mental illnesses. In supported housing (also called scattered-
site housing), services are provided off-site and are usually more limited.
Supportive housing is generally intended for people who require some 
degree of ongoing on-site support and supervision in order to live in the 
community. Supported housing may include independent apartments or 
single-family homes with mobile outreach services.
Both supportive and supported housing tend to offer permanent rather than 
transitional stays unless there is an egregious breech of house rules.
Certain housing settings are specifically designed for people with co-
occurring mental-health and substance-abuse problems. Wet housing refers 
to residences that provide housing for people who still aren’t able to pledge 
abstinence. If this housing weren’t available, they would likely be homeless. 
Damp housing is intended for people who are willing to be abstinent in the 
residence, although they may use drugs or alcohol away from it while they 
work toward sobriety.
 
Although supervised housing offers many benefits for people who might oth-
erwise have no other alternatives and may otherwise cycle in and out of hos-
pitals, when units are supervised by staff, many residents feel as if they’re 
institutionalized, having to account for their behavior and whereabouts 24/7. 
In other words, there can be an overemphasis on control to the extent that 
respect for the individual falls by the wayside, which can lead to clients 
leaving in a huff and then not being allowed to return. Make sure you and your 
relative understand the rules about leaving and returning before she moves in.

265
 Chapter 13: Housing Choices: Figuring Out Where to Live
Boarding homes and foster-care homes
Boarding homes (where unrelated adults live together in someone’s home, 
sometimes with meals) and foster-care homes (where there is more supervi-
sion, the amount of which varies from state to state) can be licensed or unli-
censed homes where someone in the community houses one or more people 
with mental disorders, providing them with room and board. Both proprie-
tary boarding homes and foster-care homes can be highly variable in terms of 
what they offer to a particular person with schizophrenia; many can be 
purely custodial as opposed to therapeutic.
If you find that rare person who boards people with mental illness out of a 
genuine love and care for them, do everything in your power to hold on to 
them! These saints are one in a million. Conversely, if you sense that some-
thing’s not right in your relative’s living situation, try to get him to talk about 
his life there, and start looking into alternative situations, because you may 
have to move him out very quickly under emergency circumstances.
 
One international study suggested that, worldwide, boarding homes are 
the least desirable type of residential setting in terms of their access to social 
support, meaningful activity, and work.
Starting the Conversation: Questions 
to Discuss with Your Loved One
Families, friends, and service providers can play an important part in helping 
an individual with schizophrenia think about housing options. Some of the 
questions you need to openly discuss with your loved one include the 
following:
 
 Can your loved one live independently or does he need support and 
supervision? For example, is he responsible for taking care of his own 
needs? Does he show good judgment? Does he know how to handle an 
emergency?
 
 Is your loved one able to access services in the community, or would 
it be more beneficial to have those services on-site? Does your loved 
one require supervision and oversight or would she be able to take 
advantage of community-based programs on her own?
 
 Is it reasonable for the person to live with family, or would it cause 
too much friction? Is there enough space? Are you able to handle the 
burden of another person in the house? Do you think you would be 
arguing much of the time?

266
Part IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
 
 How much money does your loved one have available for housing 
each month (based on entitlements, income, and/or contributions 
from the family)? What kind of housing can your loved one 
realistically afford?
 
 What are your loved one’s preferences? People should have some 
say in the types of settings and locations that most appeal to them, 
given their choices are consistent with their needs and resources.
Evaluating Residential Care
Sometimes you just know you’ve found the right living situation for your 
family member, but more often, you have to choose between several 
acceptable-but-not-perfect alternatives. When you find a potential housing 
opportunity, some of the questions you should ask include the following:
 
 What type of housing is provided?
 
 How long can an individual reside here?
 
 What is the philosophy of the operation?
 
 Who supervises the residence and what type of degree or training does 
that person have?
 
 What types of clients are most successful in this setting?
 
 What is the out-of-pocket monthly cost?
 
 Are services provided? If so, what types of services? On-site or off-site?
 
 What are the rules regarding drug and alcohol use?
 
 What oversight agencies license or accredit the facility?
 
 How are infractions of rules handled?
 
 How is relapse handled? Is a room/apartment saved for when the 
individual is discharged from a hospital?
 
 Do residents participate in the governance, operation, and/or evaluation 
of the facility or program? If so, in what way?
 
 Are there mechanisms in place for interested family members to 
communicate with staff?
Finally, ask yourself, “What’s my gut reaction to this place?” “How would I 
feel living here?” Never ignore that nagging feeling or intuition that 
something’s just not right.

 Chapter 13: Housing Choices: Figuring Out Where to Live
The need for community acceptance: 
Understanding and averting homelessness
Everyone thinks there should be housing avail-
able for people with mental illness, but no one 
wants it next door to their house. Historically, 
when government or advocacy groups have 
tried to develop specialized housing units to 
serve the population, the most common 
response has been “not on my block” or “not in 
my town,” a phenomenon so commonplace that 
it’s nicknamed NIMBY (not in my backyard). As 
a result, many communities are now grappling 
with the problem of homelessness among 
people with serious mental illnesses.
With shrinking budgets at every level of govern-
ment and the difficulties in establishing 
supportive housing or subsidized units in regu-
lar housing, people with schizophrenia are 
forced to compete on the open housing market 
like everyone else, albeit with several strikes 
against them. Clearly, many of them aren’t able 
to overcome these hurdles: It’s estimated that 
about one-third of people who are homeless 
have serious mental illnesses — and the 
majority of them have schizophrenia.
A number of federal programs, sponsored by 
HUD, are focused on providing affordable hous-
ing and support or averting homelessness for 
people with disabilities. The HUD programs are 
intended to provide a coordinated strategy for 
communities to provide a continuum of care, 
which includes outreach; intake and assess-
ment; emergency shelter; transitional housing; 
supportive services; permanent supportive 
housing; permanent housing; and homeless-
ness prevention. The programs include
  The Sec 811 Supportive Housing Program 
for People with Disabilities: This is the sole 
program providing supportive housing for 
non-elderly low-income people with dis-
abilities.
  The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher 
(HCV): This can be used to obtain private 
rental housing in properties that meet the 
HCV requirements. Administered by local 
public housing authorities, there is also a 
home-ownership option.
  The McKinney-Vento Homeless Programs: 
The components of this legislation include 
a Supportive Housing Program, a Shelter 
Plus Care Program, and a Section 8 
Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room 
Occupancy (SRO) Program.
These federal programs are always under siege 
and threat of cuts when more, rather than less, 
is what’s actually needed. In the private sector, 
many landlords still continue to discriminate 
against people with mental illness.
It’s important for mental-health advocates to 
understand that housing is a basic need of 
people with schizophrenia and to advocate for 
ways to provide more housing options that offer 
dignity and support recovery. Some of this 
entails educating landlords, legislators, service 
providers, and taxpayers about what may seem 
obvious — the importance of a place that feels 
like home to any person’s health, mental health, 
and sense of well-being.

Coping with Crises
In This Chapter
 Being prepared for psychiatric emergencies
 Recognizing signs of an impending crisis
 Watching for suicide risks
 Knowing what to do if your loved one disappears
 Handling arrests
A
 psychiatric crisis is a frightening event for everyone — the individual, 
family and friends, sometimes even the community at large. A psychiatric 
crisis handled poorly can quickly turn dangerous for the person with schizo-
phrenia or others around him.
Just like the Boy Scouts motto suggests, being prepared is key to coping with 
any crisis. Having a plan not only allows you to act quickly and appropriately, 
but also helps minimize stress for everyone involved. In this chapter, we help 
you prepare for psychiatric emergencies — from psychotic breaks and 
attempted suicide to disappearances or arrests. We also show you how to 
recognize signs of possible crisis early and show you how to cope effectively 
to end the crisis, with a good resolution, as quickly as possible.
Accepting Crises as Part 
of Schizophrenia
Life may seem to be going along well; your loved one is improving on medica-
tion and coping reasonably with life. Then a crisis occurs. You wrack your 
brain wondering if you should’ve seen this coming, and feel like you could 
have done something to prevent it.

270
Par t IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
But the reality is that schizophrenia is not only a chronic disorder, but also 
a cyclical disorder, characterized by periods of relative well-being that are 
interrupted by relapse (a severe worsening of symptoms that interferes with 
a person’s functioning). The same type of waxing and waning of symptoms 
also occurs with other chronic medical disorders, such as arthritis and 
asthma; even some cancers are seen as chronic diseases that relapse and remit.
 
Mental health crises — which can be a sudden worsening of symptoms, or a 
more gradual change that eventually reaches the point where the person with 
schizophrenia is out of control and/or can’t function — are not uncommon 
and can’t always be prevented, although their frequency and severity can be 
minimized.
Relapse can occur for a variety of different reasons. The cause of relapse may 
be apparent at one time and a complete mystery at another. Often, more than 
one factor contributes to the relapse.
 
The most common cause of relapse is stopping medication. Either people stop 
taking medication on their own, or they’re advised to stop by a doctor 
(perhaps because of intolerable side effects). Other potential triggers include 
the following:
 
 Susceptibility to stress in the environment: Stressful interpersonal or 
living situations — such as annoying roommates; the threat of eviction 
or loss of housing; or conflicts with friends, family members, employers, 
or clinicians — can exacerbate symptoms.
 
 Medications failing to work as well as they once did: The reasons for 
this situation are still unknown, but it does happen.
 
 Laxness in taking medications regularly: People with schizophrenia 
may forget a dose here or there, just as people may do when taking a 
prescribed course of antibiotics. This is especially true when they’re 
feeling better and forget that “feeling good” is probably due to the 
medication.
 
 Complexity of medication schedules: People with schizophrenia may 
have to take multiple drugs with different dosing schedules. Following 
these schedules consistently may be particularly difficult.
 
 Unwillingness to adhere to the regimens prescribed by doctors: It’s 
common for people to experiment, taking more or (usually) less medica-
tion than prescribed.
 
 Costliness of medications: New medications that are still under patent 
are especially expensive. The medications often become unaffordable 
because of insurance limitations or lack of insurance.

271
 Chapter 14: Coping with Crises
 
 Alcohol and/or other drug abuse: A relapse of a co-occurring substance-
abuse problem can precipitate a downward spiral. For example, the 
person may be unable to stay on medication due to eviction or arrest.
 
 Discouragement, depression, or stress: If someone feels hopeless or 
overwhelmed, she may neglect many aspects of staying healthy, 
including taking medication.
Psychiatric crises can also crop up spontaneously, without any identifiable 
cause, just as part of the disease. When this happens, it’s especially frustrating 
to people with schizophrenia, their relatives, and clinicians who have done 
everything humanly possible to keep the illness at bay.
The disappointment and frustration associated with relapse is often exas-
perating for families when the person who is ill doesn’t believe or refuses to 
admit that he is sick. He may instead blame everyone else for what’s happen-
ing to him. This situation makes it difficult to convince the person that he’s 
sick and needs help. It may also cause friends and family members to ques-
tion their own behavior, wondering whether they have, in fact, caused or 
contributed to the crisis.
 
As a friend or family member of someone with schizophrenia, you have to 
keep your own emotions on an even keel and not fall prey to the idea that 
you’re somehow responsible for a deteriorating situation. Realizing that 
relapse is a possibility and recognizing the first signs of it, can help you 
remind your loved one that he needs to be seen by his doctor.
 
Anosognosia is the technical term used when an individual has no insight into 
or awareness of his own illness.
Many people with schizophrenia need to be taught by their clinicians to recog-
nize the warning signs of relapse. In a perfect world, the person in crisis would 
recognize that she needs help and seek it herself or ask you to intervene. 
Frankly, this doesn’t often happen because, as the illness worsens, awareness 
and insight — that the illness is causing the disordered behavior — tends to 
disappear.
 
When you recognize that the person with schizophrenia no longer has insight, 
get help — and don’t allow her to persuade you that nothing is wrong.
Being Prepared Before a Crisis Occurs
Many crises can be averted or resolved quickly when you work collabora-
tively with the person’s psychiatrist or other clinician. This is where being 
prepared ahead of time really pays off. In this section, we help you make sure 
you’re ready to act quickly and effectively in a crisis:

272
Par t IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
Keeping essential information 
in a central location
When you’re in the middle of a crisis, you don’t want to have to search franti-
cally for phone numbers, medical information, insurance cards, and other 
essential scraps of paper. Instead, keep all the information you need in one 
convenient location, preferably in a bound notebook near a telephone at 
home or in your personal address book. It should be readily accessible and 
easy to find when you need it.
Here’s the information you want to have at hand:
 
 A list of the names, titles, and phone numbers of your loved one’s 
treatment team so everyone in the household has access to them, 
including the person with schizophrenia: This includes the names of 
the psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, psychiatric nurse, other 
clinicians or peer counselor; the name of the person’s case manager; 
and contact information for how each of these professionals can be 
reached during working hours and off-hours in an emergency.
 
 The phone number of the local hospital emergency room and local 
crisis services
 
 The phone number of a friend or family member who understands 
and can help
 
 The phone number of the local police department
 
 Your loved one’s diagnosis and the approximate date when she was 
last seen by a clinician
 
 A list of all the medications (psychiatric and any other) the person 
with schizophrenia is taking, including the names of the drugs, their 
dosages, and their frequency
 
 A succinct history of the medications your loved one has taken in 
the past, along with notes about what worked, what didn’t, and any 
adverse reactions
 
 History, if any, of alcohol and/or other drug abuse and its treatment
 
 Any pertinent information about the person’s physical health
 
Be sure to update these lists as medications and service providers change.
Although the field of medicine is moving toward electronic medical records 
to enable consumers (and often their doctors) to have access to their per-
sonal health information on the Internet no matter where they are, the reality 
is that some systems can’t “talk” to others, and communication between one 
provider and another may not be as timely or reliable as it should be.

273
 Chapter 14: Coping with Crises
 
If possible, purchase a password-protected USB flash drive on which you can 
store your loved one’s electronic medical record. This empowers consumers 
and families to maintain control of their own information and always have it 
accessible in an emergency, whether at home or away. At the very least, keep 
hard copies of all clinician visits, pertinent lab results, and previous hospital-
ization records.
 
A USB flash drive is a portable hard drive, about the size of your thumb, that 
plugs into any computer’s USB port. You can find these drives in places like 
the big-name office supply stores or computer stores. A small 1GB drive can 
be had for less than $20; drives with greater capacity will run you closer to 
$75 or more (and there are numerous options at prices in between). Look for 
one with a metal loop attached, so you can put it on your keychain and always 
have it handy.
Surveying crisis resources 
before you need them
The best time to learn about crisis resources is before you need them, when 
your loved one is stable. These resources include mental-health inpatient, 
outpatient, and crisis programs (alternatives to hospitalization) in the com-
munity such as:
 
 Mobile outreach teams (trained teams of professionals who conduct clini-
cal assessments and provide services wherever patients are located, at 
home or in the community)
 
 Crisis response teams (mental-health professionals who can come to your 
home in the event of a psychiatric emergency, much like a volunteer 
ambulance corps might come in the event of an injury or heart attack)
 
 Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) programs, which use multidis-
ciplinary professional teams to provide comprehensive, round-the-clock 
services to clients in the comfort of their own homes and in the community
 
 Hospitals
 
 Local law enforcement programs intended to divert people from jails
 
Although all facilities sound wonderful in their brochures or in the phone 
book, in reality, some may be ill-equipped to handle a person with serious 
psychiatric issues, may not offer after-hours admitting services, or may not 
take your insurance — or any insurance at all. When possible, phone or visit 
these programs in person and speak to the staff to find how they may be able 
to help during a crisis and to get a feel for the facility or program and whether 
you would feel comfortable having them provide care for your loved one.

274
Par t IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
 
Some of the best sources of up-to-date information on facilities in your area 
are members of local affiliates of the National Alliance on Mental Illness 
(NAMI; a national membership organization of families providing education, 
support, and advocacy), who have vast experience and are willing to share 
their expertise. Professionals who work with your loved one may also be 
knowledgeable about community resources.
Also be sure to contact your local public mental health authority (county or 
city) to find out about the range of crisis services they offer. They’re usually 
listed in the Yellow Pages under government agencies. Depending on where 
you live, there may be publicly funded mobile outreach services, short-term 
crisis residential services, consumer-operated safe houses (shelters), and hot 
lines that can help.
 
Because crisis stabilization services aren’t available everywhere all the time, 
hospitalization is often a necessity of last resort.
 
Also, most community hospitals lack a sufficient number of crisis beds result-
ing in long waits in the emergency room or transfers to other facilities. Knowing 
what’s available at each of your area hospitals can make the difference in the 
quality of care your loved one gets in a crisis. Consider the following:
 
 Make sure the hospital is an in-network provider, participates in your 
relative’s insurance plan, or accepts patients with Medicaid.
 
 Find out if the hospital’s behavioral healthcare program is accredited 
by the Joint Commission (www.jointcommission.org). In that way, 
you can be assured that the facility meets certain standards. (Although 
this is desirable, you may not always have a Joint Commission–
accredited hospital in your area.)
 
 Make sure that the hospital has psychiatric beds. Some hospitals don’t 
have these beds. If your loved one winds up in such an emergency room, 
she’ll likely be sent elsewhere, wasting time.
 
 Ask about the number, demographics, and diagnoses of the psychiatric 
patients. If your loved one is in his 80s, you probably wouldn’t want him 
on the same unit as young people with dual diagnoses. On the other 
hand, if your loved one is an impulsive teenager, you may not want her 
to be on a mixed-sex ward.
 
 Find out who supervises the unit. Because medication is one of the 
mainstays of inpatient treatment, ideally the person supervising the 
unit will be a competent psychopharmacologist (an expert in psychiatric 
medications).
 
 Inquire about the visiting policies for patients and whether those 
hours will make visiting convenient for you.
 
 Find out about the smoking policies if your loved one is addicted to 
nicotine.

275
 Chapter 14: Coping with Crises
 
 Ask whether your loved one will be able to go outdoors during his 
stay if it extends more than a few days.
 
 Check with other people who know the hospital about the competence 
of the physicians who will be taking care of your loved one.
 
 If your loved one doesn’t speak English or is of a racial/cultural minority, 
make sure that the staff is linguistically and culturally sensitive. Ask 
whether translators are available when needed.
 
 Ask if you can visit the hospital beforehand, to see its facilities. Don’t 
be surprised if staff isn’t welcoming about families visiting a facility 
beforehand. Typically, they’re trying to protect the confidentiality of the 
patients who are there so your visit may be restricted to certain times 
or certain areas of the facility.
 
 Most important: Find out about the hospital’s policies about communi-
cating with families. Do they see them as part of the problem or part of 
the solution? Will they allow you to provide information? Will the hospital 
be willing, with the patient’s permission, to share information with you?
 
Proprietary services on the Internet, like HealthGrades (www.health-
grades.com), provide information on individual hospitals and their doctors. 
Hospitals are rated, with information about their costs, patient volumes, and 
safety record. You can also find out about doctors, their training, certification, 
length of time in practice, and whether they’ve been subject to any disciplin-
ary actions.
Recognizing the Signs That 
Something Is Wrong
The signs of a beginning recurrence of schizophrenia may or may not be 
obvious. The onset may be insidious, developing over a long period of time; 
other times it appears suddenly, seemingly out of the blue. Alerting yourself 
to the most common early signs that all is not well can help avert a crisis.
Noticing a downward spiral
The signs of an acute psychiatric crisis can’t be missed, but symptoms that 
appear gradually may be easily overlooked or explained away, unless you’re 
aware that they may represent an impending crisis. Many of these signs are 
also characteristic of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (described in 
Chapter 3), and it can take an attentive eye to recognize the subtle differ-
ences between your loved one’s “normal” behavior and an increase in nega-
tive symptoms.

276
Par t IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
Confidentiality policies: 
Separating fact from fiction
In 1996, the U.S. Congress passed the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA), a lengthy and complex law that reg-
ulates and protects the sharing of all health 
(including mental-health) information. Many 
people don’t fully understand the provisions 
of the law, and some professionals use it as a 
handy excuse to deny all communication with 
families. (Additionally, independent of HIPAA, 
some policies established by mental-health 
programs are even more restrictive than the 
federal law.)
The ethical standards of conduct of many 
mental-health professions (such as psychology, 
psychiatry, and others) also uphold patient con-
fidentiality in therapeutic relationships. But if a 
patient is at imminent risk of harming herself or 
others, clinicians have a duty to inform appropri-
ate individuals, including the family.
In the case of patients with schizophrenia, 
practitioners need to be sensitive to the ways in 
which disclosure, with the patient’s permission, 
can actually benefit treatment. As a general 
rule, with explicit permission from the patient 
(usually in writing), clinicians can share rele-
vant information with the family. If the patient is 
deemed incompetent, the patient’s permission 
isn’t necessary if the family member has legal 
authority to make medical decisions on behalf 
of the patient.
Hiding behind the law, some clinicians and 
hospital employees cite the risk of fines and 
jail terms if they divulge information to anyone 
but the patient. In truth, as long as a patient 
doesn’t object, a health practitioner can share 
information about a patient with family mem-
bers. Many times, clinicians fail to ask patients 
their preferences and assume they don’t want 
their families involved (which isn’t always the 
case). Instead, they should discuss the impor-
tance of family involvement and support. Even if 
the patient voices an objection, the doctor isn’t 
prohibited from listening to families who can 
provide vital information about the patient, his 
illness, and prior treatments.
In some cases, the law is taken to such an 
extreme that some hospitals are unwilling to 
put telephone calls through when a relative 
calls and asks to speak to a patient, not wanting 
to reveal that the person is hospitalized there. 
To eliminate any confusion, you might ask your 
loved one to write a note giving her permission 
for a doctor to speak to you or for a hospital to 
release information. (See Chapter 7 for more 
information on advance directives.)
Regardless of any policy prohibitions against 
sharing patient-specific information, profession-
als have an ethical responsibility to share non-
confidential “educational” information — such 
as information about psychiatric disorders and 
their treatment, community resources, tips for 
coping, and information about the availability of 
NAMI groups and meetings in the community.
Although your loved one may not want a 
relative — including you — to know all the inti-
mate details of his life, he may want them to 
know the name of his disorder, its symptoms, 
its treatment, the expected course, warning 
signs of relapse, and how they can know if he 
might be at risk of hurting himself or others. You 
may need to remind your loved one (and his 
clinician) that family members and friends can 
be an important source of support and encour-
agement on a person’s journey to recovery.

277
 Chapter 14: Coping with Crises
Some signs that may indicate a gradual decline include
 
 Becoming increasingly withdrawn (not interacting or speaking with others)
 
 Losing interest in eating or eating excessively
 
 Becoming irresponsible about self-care routines such as washing and 
dressing
 
 Spending more and more time asleep or in bed
 
 Severe mood changes
Spotting the signs of an acute crisis
Symptoms of an acute exacerbation of illness are much more noticeable — 
and frightening — than the subtle signs that may precede it. These are also 
the so-called positive symptoms of schizophrenia (see Chapter 3).
A person in acute crisis may
 
 Feel threatened and become hypervigilant
 
 Hear voices when no one is speaking (known as hallucinating)
 
 Become suspicious and frightened that someone or some group wants 
to hurt him (known as being delusional)
 
 Become agitated
 
 Say things that don’t make sense
 
 Pace incessantly, or be unable to sit still
 
During a crisis, it’s easy to let emotions escalate as your fears take hold. 
However, it’s extremely important that you maintain a calm demeanor when 
speaking to your loved one with schizophrenia. Even if that person is acting bel-
ligerent, threatening, or isn’t listening to you, it does no good to yell, argue with, 
or provoke the individual in any way. Instead, your goal should be to diffuse the 
situation and get help as quickly as possible to protect the patient, yourself, and 
anyone else who is present. To achieve that, you need to maintain a positive 
relationship with the person, reassuring him, building his confidence, and letting 
him know that you’re there for him when he feels frightened and out of control.
Calling for Professional Help
If your loved one is in no immediate danger when a crisis begins, the best 
course of action is to seek immediate medical advice from the person’s own 
psychiatrist or other clinician.

278
Par t IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
Although only a physician can prescribe medication (except in a few states 
where psychologists have prescribing privileges), psychiatrists are often 
overextended and hard to reach, especially if crises occur after hours, on 
holidays, or on weekends.
 
Other mental-health professionals often have better luck contacting the psy-
chiatrist than family members or consumers have, or they may be able to 
render their own help.
Even if you can’t reach your loved one’s own doctor, typically another doctor 
will be covering her practice. Other times, you may have to contact a clinic 
or crisis center where no one is familiar with your family member.
If you’re dealing with an unfamiliar clinician, identify your relation to the 
person with schizophrenia, and be prepared to describe what unusual behav-
iors or symptoms the person with schizophrenia is experiencing. You’ll also 
need to know the name of the person’s doctor, when your loved one was 
last seen, his diagnosis or diagnoses, and current treatments. (See “Keeping 
essential information in a central location,” earlier in this chapter, for the 
kind of information to have on hand before a crisis.)
With the information you provide, the clinician will be able to suggest a 
course of action for you to take. This might include
 
 Changing medications or changing the dose of one or more medications
 
 Making an appointment for the person to be seen at a clinic or private 
office as soon as possible
 
 Recommending a visit to the emergency room of your local community 
hospital
 
 Making arrangements for admission to a psychiatric hospital or a 
general hospital with psychiatric beds
 
 Some other course of action based on the patient and family’s needs and 
the available community resources
 
 Calling the police if the clinician feels the person is dangerous to himself 
or others
Knowing Whether Hospitalization 
Is Necessary
Although images from old books and movies may have you very concerned 
about the possibility of hospitalization for your loved one, rest assured that the 
scary images of the past no longer represent modern psychiatric facilities. In 

279
 Chapter 14: Coping with Crises
fact, the images portrayed in old movies (like The Snake Pit) actually helped 
reform them.
Not everyone in crisis needs inpatient hospitalization today; outpatient man-
agement may be all your loved one needs. The next sections describe the 
options of hospitalization and outpatient care.
The decision to hospitalize
When does your loved one need to be hospitalized rather than treated on 
an outpatient basis? The short answer: when she needs to receive 24-hour 
care in a more protected and secure environment (which may or may not be 
locked) than you can provide or when medical treatment requires 24-hour 
monitoring and observation.
Here are some examples of when hospitalization is necessary:
 
 When a person needs to be protected (he’s dangerous to himself, he’s 
dangerous to others, or his judgment is so impaired that he can’t be 
responsible for himself)
 
 When the patient would benefit from close observation of symptoms 
and side effects in a controlled setting (for example, during an acute 
relapse)
 
 When the patient needs intensive medical oversight (to rapidly switch 
medications, to withdraw from illegal drugs, to assess or treat medical 
complications)
 
 When the patient would benefit from intensive therapeutic programming 
(that is, behavioral modification)
 
 When the family can no longer handle care on their own or they need 
some respite from providing care and supervision
 
 When there is an acute drug overdose (whether prescribed, over-the-
counter, or illicit drugs)
 
Even though you think your loved one may be an imminent danger to her-
self or others, it may be difficult to have her hospitalized involuntarily if she 
doesn’t agree with you and refuses to be evaluated. In many cases, profession-
als must witness the behavior themselves — but often, they may be willing to 
accept information you provide.
 
Involuntary commitment laws are complicated and vary from state to state. 
Depending on where you live, you or a mental-health professional may need to 
call the police to transport your loved one to a hospital or file a petition seek-
ing an involuntary psychiatric evaluation. You may be able to contact your 
local mobile crisis service to bring your loved one to a psychiatric 

280
Par t IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
emergency room. To find out about your state commitment law, its standards, 
and what you need to do in the event of an emergency, contact your local 
mental-health department or go to www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/
LegalResources/Index.htm.
What to bring with you 
for hospital admission
Sometimes, hospitals will allow you to arrange for a scheduled admission 
screening. Other times, you may be required to show up at the emergency 
room and wait. Either way, these are some of the things you may want to 
bring with you:
 
 Insurance cards from Medicaid or any third-party insurers
 
 A written summary (no more than a couple of pages long) that includes 
information about your loved one’s current medications, a brief list of 
her current symptoms, a brief history of her medications, what worked, 
and what didn’t
 
 Information about any health problems your loved one has or had — 
treated or untreated
 
 Outpatient provider information (to assure that the treating team has 
access to prior information about the patient and to facilitate continuity 
of care after discharge)
 
 Contact information for the family
 
Generally, at least two people should accompany the individual to the hospi-
tal so one of them can drive and the other can provide support to the person 
with schizophrenia and assistance to the driver, if necessary.
Alternatives to hospitalization
If your family member isn’t a danger to himself or others, outpatient care may 
be all he needs to get through a crisis — which can help avoid the stigma of 
a first hospitalization or the demoralization that often results because of a 
subsequent one. Some of the alternatives that may prevent or avoid hospital-
ization include
 
 More intensely supervised outpatient care: Checking in with a doctor 
or case worker more frequently to provide crisis support and monitor or 
adjust medication.
 
 Injectable medication (generally an antipsychotic or sedative medication) 
administered at a physician’s office or in an emergency room

281
 Chapter 14: Coping with Crises
 
 Mobile outreach teams: See “Surveying crisis resources before you need 
them,” earlier in this chapter.
 
 ACT programs: See “Surveying crisis resources before you need them,” 
earlier in this chapter.
 
 Crisis housing: A short-term residential alternative to hospitalization 
that offers intensive crisis support.
 
 Partial hospitalization: A program in which patients continue to live at 
home but spend a certain number of hours in a hospital setting, either 
during the day or at night.
 
 Assisted outpatient treatment (AOT): Also called outpatient commitment, 
AOT may be an option for people who are consistently unwilling to take 
medication and, as a result, are unable to live safely in the community. 
Forty-two states permit the use of this type of court-ordered treatment, 
although it’s used more infrequently than you might think. For more 
information on AOT, contact your state mental-health authority (see the 
appendix) or go to www.psychlaws.org/BriefingPapers/BP4.htm.
Reducing the Risk of Suicide
The risk of suicide for individuals with schizophrenia is estimated to be 
50 times higher than that of the general population. In fact, it is the most 
common cause of premature death for people with the disorder. (Over 90 
percent of Americans who kill themselves have a mental disorder.)
In some cases of suicide among people with schizophrenia, the suicide is 
considered unintentional — a product of delusional or disturbed thinking. 
More often, suicide among this group is linked to severe depressive symp-
toms. That shouldn’t be surprising considering all the losses associated with 
schizophrenia — financial, education, vocational, and social.
 
If a person with schizophrenia is expressing hopelessness or suicidal 
thoughts, making suicidal threats, getting rid of her prized belongings, or 
putting her affairs in order, these behaviors and suicidal thoughts should be 
taken seriously. No suicidal threat or gesture should ever be ignored; people 
who talk about or threaten suicide are at high risk for following through.
Although there is no typical suicide victim, some of the factors that increase 
the risk of suicide include
 
 Being male
 
 Having a mental disorder
 
 Engaging in substance abuse

282
Par t IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
 
 Having suffered recent losses
 
 Being impulsive
 
 Having attempted suicide in the past or a family history of suicide
 
 Having access to firearms
 
If a person is considering suicide, you can take certain precautions to 
decrease the risk:
 
 Remove dangerous objects (guns, knives, or other sharp objects).
 
 Take responsibility for the person’s medication supply and only provide 
a dose at a time.
 
 Explicitly ask the individual if he is contemplating suicide.
 
 Give the person the opportunity to talk about her feelings; don’t simply 
dismiss them. Try not to provoke a confrontation.
 
 Explain that the person is important to you and that his suicide would 
be a painful loss to you rather than any type of relief.
 
 Make it clear you want to help and ask the person to promise not to 
attempt suicide for a certain period of time.
 
 Explain that depression and suicidal thinking are part of his illness, that 
schizophrenia is treatable, and that you want to make sure he gets pro-
fessional help as soon as possible.
 
 Your loved one may be willing to allow you to make an appointment with a 
mental-health professional for her. (Generally, a person who has attempted 
suicide or is considered suicidal can be hospitalized involuntarily.)
 
If you can’t reach a mental-health professional in your community, contact 
the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 800-273-8255. The hot line will route 
your call to the crisis center closest to you that has trained suicide counselors 
available 24 hours a day, to provide advice to individuals who are suicidal and 
to their families.
Dealing with Local Law Enforcement
You may think the last thing you need is the local police knowing all your 
family business. However, when a loved one has schizophrenia, family pri-
vacy often goes out the window, and you become much better acquainted 
with local law enforcement than you ever expected to be.

283
 Chapter 14: Coping with Crises
 
The best time to get acquainted is before a crisis occurs. Call or visit your local 
police department and make personal contact before you end up meeting in 
the middle of a chaotic situation. Explain your loved one’s illness and deter-
mine, in the event of an emergency, how you should contact law enforcement 
and what information they’ll need. You may be surprised and touched at the 
compassion law enforcement officers have when they understand the situation 
you’re in.
When to call the police
Some family members have told us that “calling the police on a family 
member” has been the most difficult thing they’ve ever had to do. In an emer-
gency, you may have no alternative but to contact the police or call 911 if 
your loved one with schizophrenia is suicidal, acting threatening to others, 
has been assaultive, or has a weapon. Be prepared to explain the situation 
and clearly state that the person has a history of mental illness. Tell the 
police about the events that precipitated the crisis.
With increased efforts to properly train law-enforcement personnel, they’ve 
become more informed about mental illness. Police officers will not generally 
arrest an individual with schizophrenia unless an actual crime has been com-
mitted. Police often provide assistance, in fact, in transporting the person 
with schizophrenia to a hospital or other facility.
What to do when a person with 
mental illness is arrested
The phone rings, and it’s the local police department. An officer tells you that 
your loved one with schizophrenia has been arrested for a nuisance crime 
(perhaps urinating on someone’s lawn, touching a stranger, or picking up 
something from a store counter without paying).
Although people with mental illness are more often victims rather than perpe-
trators of crime, people with mental illness often get into trouble with the law 
because of symptoms of their mental disorder — lack of judgment, impulsivity, 
and inappropriate behavior.
 
If you get a call saying your loved one has been arrested, do the following:
 
 Find out where the person is being held.
 
 If you can, try to prevent the arrest by explaining that your loved one 
has a mental illness and ask the officer to help you get psychiatric 
care at an emergency room in lieu of arrest.

284
Par t IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
 
 If the person has already been arrested, ask the police if they can 
drop the charges. If they won’t, see if they’ll release your loved one if 
you assure them that she’ll appear in court.
 
 If your loved one is being arraigned, be sure to attend the arraignment 
hearing and tell the defense attorney who you are. Provide specific infor-
mation about the person’s psychiatric illness and treatment needs. See if 
you can get the charges lowered or dismissed to avert her being jailed.
 
 For some nonviolent individuals with mental illness who are not diverted 
from arrest or pretrial detention, some communities have established 
mental-health courts to allow these defendants to participate in court-
supervised treatment designed and implemented by a collaborative 
team of criminal justice and mental-health professionals. For more about 
mental health courts, go to www.ojp.usdoj.gov/BJA/grant/mental
health.html.
 
 If your loved one is jailed, assure that she’s safe while in custody. The 
risk of suicide is very high during the first day or two. State the facts 
plainly: Explain that your loved one has schizophrenia and you’re afraid 
she might try to kill herself.
 
 Engage a defense attorney to work with you and your loved one.
 
 Stay in touch with the mental-health staff at the jail to make sure that 
your loved one’s release is planned in advance. It’s common for people 
to be released from jails without proper planning. You want to make 
sure that your loved one is linked to appropriate community mental-
health services before her release.
 
People with schizophrenia should always carry some form of identification 
with a phone number for a relative or case manager in case of an emergency.
Mentally Ill and Missing
It isn’t uncommon for people with schizophrenia to disappear suddenly in an 
attempt to escape their problems or to search for a better life. This situation 
is a nightmare for families who realize their loved ones are unable to take 
care of themselves and fear for their safety. There are steps you can take to 
find your loved one, however, so don’t panic — but take appropriate action 
as quickly as possible.
Your first step will probably be to call the police, but keep in mind that they 
won’t be able to take any immediate action. After three days, your loved one 
can be placed on an “endangered adult” list that’s compiled by the FBI and 
sent out over a national alert.

285
 Chapter 14: Coping with Crises
 
While you’re waiting, there’s plenty you can do on your own. For 
example, you can:
 
 Contact NAMI. NAMI provides support and guidance for families of 
missing persons. You can reach them at 800-950-6264.
 
 Develop your own one-page “missing person” flyer, with a picture and 
description of your relative, and put it everywhere you can think of. 
NAMI suggests posting the flyers the following places:
 
• Houses of worship
 
• College campuses
 
• Community health centers
 
• Banks
 
• Hospitals
 
• Public libraries
 
• Mass transportation centers
 
• Free meal sites
 
• The Red Cross
 
• The Salvation Army
 
• Homeless shelters
 
• Social security offices
 
• Social service agencies
 
 A family we worked with was reunited with their relative when his 
picture was noticed on a bulletin board by an alert nurse in a hospital 
emergency room.
 
 With the ease and speed of electronic communications, you can develop 
such a flyer and rapidly circulate it to everyone you know and to facili-
ties in the community. You may also want to call the local newspaper to 
see if it would be willing to run a story about your missing relative.
 
 Alert friends and relatives that your loved may show up in their area 
looking for a place to stay. If you haven’t been upfront with friends and 
relatives about what’s happening with your loved one up to this point, 
now is the time to start.
 
 Contact all your loved one’s known hangouts and alert regular staff to 
call you if your loved one comes in.
 
 Make yourself accessible day and night. Always have a cellphone with 
you and make sure the number is displayed on your flyers.

Advance Directives: Helping People 
Decide for Themselves
Healthcare power of attorney is a well-known and often-used tool in general 
healthcare — it’s a written legal document that enables another person 
you name (known as your proxy) to make decisions on your behalf if you’re 
unable to make them independently.
Psychiatric advance directives (PADs) for mental-health decision-making are 
a specific type of healthcare power of attorney that allows patients who are 
well (competent) to express how they want to be treated if they become ill 
again, generally as a result of a recurring mental illness like schizophrenia.
 
In Canada, PADs are called Ulysses contracts.
PADs are based on the idea that someone who was hospitalized in the past, 
perhaps involuntarily, may have definite preferences about the treatments he 
wants to have (or not have) next time around. For example, your loved one 
may realize that medication is helpful even if he’s opposed to it when he no 
longer has insight into his schizophrenia. Conversely, he may not want a cer-
tain medication to be used against his will because he found the side effects 
intolerable.
Generally, your loved one shares his PAD with his psychiatrist or other pri-
mary clinician, or another person he trusts to serve as his healthcare agent. 
Depending on where your loved one lives, the state may or may not require 
him to appoint an agent. Having a PAD in place accomplishes the following:
 
 It ensures that the healthcare provider — and whoever else your loved 
one gives copies of the document to — knows his preferences.
 
 It facilitates an open dialogue between your loved one and his clinician 
about future care.
 
 It can prevent potential disagreements between your loved one and con-
cerned family members or physicians around the use of medication.
 
 It can prevent court battles over involuntary treatment.
 
 It can help prevent relapse, by encouraging timely treatment before 
emergencies occur.
 
 It can specify directions for the care of the person’s minor children in 
the event that he’s incapacitated, which can be very comforting to a 
parent who has schizophrenia.

287
 Chapter 14: Coping with Crises
 
In the following situations, PADs are not followed:
 
 If the treatment requests in the PAD aren’t feasible or acceptable
 
 If the PAD conflicts with emergency procedures
 
 If the PAD is outside the law
 
The National Resource Center on Psychiatric Advance Directives (www.nrc-
pad.org) provides information about how to craft a PAD and offers state-
specific information and forms. Also, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health 
Law has a fact sheet on advance directives that provides information and 
resources (www.bazelon.org/issues/advancedirectives).
Every state has a federally funded protection and advocacy (P&A) system 
that can advise you about the laws in your own state or refer you to a lawyer 
who can. To find the contact information for your state P&A, visit the Web 
site of the National Disability Rights Network (www.napas.org) or call 
202-408-9514.

 Facilitating the recovery process
 Meeting the basic needs of people with schizophrenia
 Identifying the roadblocks you’ll encounter
P
eople with schizophrenia are, above all else, people. They have hopes, 
dreams, and human needs like everyone else. When you’re in the 
trenches dealing with the day-to-day challenges of the disorder, remembering 
this can be difficult.
Every day, people with schizophrenia live in a society that moves fast and 
often doesn’t take their needs into account. Life doesn’t stop while people 
with schizophrenia recover.
Although coping with an illness is vitally important, planning for the rest of 
the story is equally important. In this chapter, we look at the roadblocks, 
sometimes seemingly insurmountable, standing between the person with 
schizophrenia and a fulfilling life, and the realistic goals for normal living that 
can — and should — be set. Finally, we offer suggestions on how you can 
help move mountains for your loved one on their journey.

Overcoming Negative Expectations
About 40 years ago, two educational researchers conducted what has 
become a classic study about the effects of expectations. They found that 
when teachers expected students to succeed, the students succeeded, and 
when teachers expected them to fail, the students failed. In other words, what 
other people think you can accomplish can make a huge difference in what you 
do accomplish. The idea that expectations can affect outcomes has become 
known as the self-fulfilling prophecy. We believe that the same theory holds true 
in the lives of people with schizophrenia.
For many years, people with schizophrenia were expected to live a life behind 
institutional walls, with little hope of recovery and the ability to live a normal 
life. Fortunately, today’s expectations are much more hopeful, although 
there’s still a long way to go.
The expectations that people with schizophrenia set for themselves or that 
others set for them can dramatically influence whether their lives are “lives 
well lived.” People with schizophrenia, their families, and their friends need 
to maintain a sense of hope and optimism. This idea isn’t Pollyanna-ish — on 
the contrary, it’s realistic! Like heart disease, diabetes, or asthma, schizo-
phrenia should be thought of as a chronic but manageable condition that 
involves cycles of relapse and recovery. You and your loved one may not 
have exactly the same life you imagined (no one ever really does), but it can 
still be a satisfying and productive life!
 
Expectations for people with schizophrenia have undergone a tremendous 
metamorphosis over the years. In 1896, German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin 
used the term dementia praecox (early dementia) to describe the symptoms 
that are now encompassed by the term schizophrenia. He and others of his era 
saw the disorder as one with an inevitable downward and worsening course.
Time and solid research have disproved that idea. Long-term follow-up studies 
of people with the disorder have proven that schizophrenia is a chronic, but 
manageable disorder — typically with remissions when symptoms disappear 
and relapses when symptoms worsen. With early intervention, good treatment, 
and proper care, periods of wellness are longer, there is less disability, and 
more people (even most) are able to lead better lives.
 
If you or someone you know has ever had an elderly relative who received 
custodial care hidden in a remote state hospital for most of his adult life, 
never getting better or living a somewhat normal life, get that depressing, 
hope-crushing picture out of your mind. Mental illnesses are treated differ-
ently today.
For more on why schizophrenia was once seen as hopeless, see the nearby 
sidebar, “The low expectations of the past.”

291
 Chapter 15: People Are More Than Patients
The low expectations of the past
The reason why schizophrenia was once 
viewed as a grim, and perhaps even hopeless, 
diagnosis can be explained, in part, by several 
phenomena:
  Lack of treatments: Until the mid-1950s, 
when the first generation of antipsychotic 
medications (major tranquilizers, neurolep-
tics) were introduced, the only way to con-
trol the positive symptoms (hallucinations, 
delusions, agitation, disorganized thinking) 
of schizophrenia was with sedative drugs 
such as barbiturates or chloral hydrate. 
These drugs had to be given at doses that 
caused sedation, stupor, and sleep before 
the positive symptoms were controlled. 
People medicated this way couldn’t func-
tion and needed to remain in a protected 
environment.
  The advent of antipsychotic medications to 
control positive symptoms without making 
people zombies raised the specter that 
people with schizophrenia could return to 
their communities. Fortuitously, deinstitu-
tionalization (a social movement oriented 
to treatment in the least restrictive envi-
ronment) was taking hold and changed 
the once-dismal outlook for patients and 
families. (For more on deinstitutionalization, 
check out the sidebar “Overcoming the 
broken promises of deinstitutionalization,” in 
this chapter.)
  A life of institutionalization: Because there 
were no effective treatments for control-
ling symptoms until the last half-century, 
people with the disorder had to be hospi-
talized (mainly for their own protection) for 
long periods of time, usually far away from 
their homes, families, and friends. In these 
asylums, there were no opportunities for 
the normal stimulation, socialization, and 
learning that others have living in the com-
munity — so people with schizophrenia 
became impoverished in both thought and 
behavior and began to look and act “insti-
tutionalized,” distinct from the symptoms of 
their illness.
  The clinician’s illusion: Another reason for 
negative expectations is the phenomenon 
known as the clinician’s illusion. Clinicians 
(especially psychiatrists) are more likely 
to see patients with the most severe and 
intractable forms of schizophrenia rather 
than milder, more treatable cases. For 
decades, this situation biased their per-
ceptions about what the disease looks 
like and how effectively it can be treated. 
Only when large-scale follow-up studies of 
entire groups of people with schizophrenia 
were analyzed did researchers realize that 
many people with schizophrenia have fairly 
successful outcomes.
Achieving the Goals of Recovery
An emphasis on recovery has provided renewed hope for people with 
schizophrenia, as well as their families and friends; it has also changed the 
expectations of people who provide treatment and care. The concept of 
recovery suggests that individuals shouldn’t be reduced to their illness or 
symptoms alone; instead, they are “whole” individuals who have the same 
dreams and aspirations as anyone else does. After all, no one, regardless of 

292
Par t IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
her condition, wants to be viewed as only a patient — that denies the indi-
vidual her personhood.
Although recovery may not take place along a straight line, it generally has a 
positive trajectory (even though there may be some bumps along the way). 
Recovery shouldn’t be relegated to the later stages of schizophrenia — it 
should be an important concept from the very start of the illness.
 
In the same way that people with physical disabilities are empowered when 
they have equal access (for example, a person in a wheelchair who uses a 
ramp to mount a curb or an elevator to catch a train), people with mental 
illnesses require and deserve the basic supports and accommodations they 
need to achieve the promise of recovery.
One essential element of recovery is the idea that people with schizophrenia 
should be able to manage and self-direct or self-determine his own care, to 
the extent possible, making decisions about the range of treatments or sup-
ports that are acceptable to him. This control is important for the individu-
al’s self-esteem.
The fact that patients vote with their feet, and will only comply with services 
that are acceptable to them, can positively or negatively impact their treat-
ment plan. For example, if a program isn’t welcoming and doesn’t treat cli-
ents respectfully, they won’t attend regularly.
The idea that a person with schizophrenia could recover enough to direct 
her own care is a fairly recent one. Recovery today has a much more positive 
definition than it did several decades ago, when full recovery and a move 
back into normal society were rarely possible.
The notion of recovery implies that the person with schizophrenia — with-
out being cured — can still live life fully with the illness: living with as much 
autonomy as possible despite any residual impairments or disabilities. 
Recovery is an active and ongoing process that continues over time.
 
Maybe it’s more accurate to use the verb, recovering, because it reinforces the 
ideas that people continue to grow and change incrementally, but continually.
Recovery is multifaceted because schizophrenia affects different domains of 
functioning in different individuals in different ways. For example:
 
 Someone’s hallucinations and delusions may disappear completely with 
antipsychotic medication, but that person may still be unable to experi-
ence pleasure (in what’s called anhedonia).
 
 An individual may no longer be suspicious or have feelings of paranoia, 
but she may be unable or unmotivated to seek work.
 
 A person may gradually ease into full-time work but may be unable to 
completely quell the voices he hears while working.

 Chapter 15: People Are More Than Patients
Overcoming the broken promises 
of deinstitutionalization
Few advances in mental-health treatments 
were welcomed as enthusiastically as the move 
to “mainstream” people with mental illness 
instead of keeping them warehoused in psychi-
atric hospitals, overmedicated, undertreated, and 
accorded few of the basic human rights. Popular 
movies and books like The Snake Pit portrayed 
mental institutions as horrific places, and the 
move to community care was the result of good 
intentions.
Having good intentions, however, doesn’t always 
result in positive solutions. As primitive, ineffec-
tive, and sometimes inhumane as treatment was 
in the era of asylums, patients in these institutions 
were at least assured three square meals a day, 
clothes on their back, a roof over their heads, 
and a modicum of safety. Unfortunately, that isn’t 
true today. With all the advances that have been 
made in scientific knowledge and improved treat-
ments, and the growth of patient and family advo-
cacy, there are still formidable barriers to decent 
care for people with serious mental illnesses 
like schizophrenia in the United States. In many 
cases, taking people out of institutions and put-
ting them on the street has done a tremendous 
disservice to them, leaving many much worse off 
than they were before.
In essence, the movement toward deinstitu-
tionalization in the United States ended up as a 
broken promise. Changes in federal legislation 
prohibited Medicaid reimbursement for inpatient 
stays in state mental hospitals. So in an effort to 
cut costs to state governments, patients were 
released from these institutions to communi-
ties that were often less than welcoming. The 
full array of community-based treatments and 
basic supports (especially affordable housing) 
never materialized for those who were most in 
need. Even today, too many people with schizo-
phrenia still cycle in and out of local jails; live in 
substandard housing, in shelters, or under 
bridges; wait hours in crowded hospital emer-
gency rooms only to be sent back to their fami-
lies or the streets without treatment; and swell 
the ranks of the nation’s homeless population. 
(It’s estimated that about one-third of the 
homeless population suffer from severe 
mental disorders — the majority of them with 
schizophrenia — including many who are dually 
diagnosed with mental illness and substance-use 
disorders.)
One of the scariest end results of deinstitutional-
ization is the ability of people with mental illness 
to simply disappear into the streets and alleys of 
our nation’s cities, leaving behind panic-stricken, 
desperate families with no way to contact them. 
If your loved one disappears, contact your local 
police department immediately, as well as the 
police departments in areas where you think your 
loved one might turn up. If she remains missing 
more than three days, the information you provide 
will be handed over to the FBI, and your relative 
will be considered an “endangered adult.” Many 
families have had success in locating a missing 
relative after preparing a flyer with a picture and 
identifying information and posting it in shelters, 
hospital emergency rooms, and other places 
where their relative might go for help.
Despite these grim facts, there’s much to be 
hopeful about in the aftermath of deinstitution-
alization. With the right support systems, people 
with schizophrenia are much freer today to work 
at the jobs of their choice, live where they please, 
and live much like everyone else. The key to living 
a satisfying life is to identify goals, plan for them, 
and work toward them step by step. There will be 
bumps and detours along the way, but at least the 
ability to pursue the goals your loved one chooses 
for himself are there in a way they never were for 
those with schizophrenia several decades ago.

Par t IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
 
You and your loved one should think of recovery as a process with parallel 
paths and multiple goals rather than a single path with one endpoint.
Most important, the concept of recovery acknowledges the rights of all 
people, including those with disabilities, to have rewarding friendships, 
meaningful employment, and enjoyable leisure-time pursuits. It empowers 
them to set life goals and to move toward them instead of waiting for “total 
cure” or even remission of symptoms before engaging in life.
 
You need to convey to your loved one your confidence in her ability to help 
herself. When family members understand the notion of recovery, they’re 
less frustrated about rough patches — they see them as part of the illness as 
opposed to a failure of their loved one or themselves, which helps them cope 
more constructively.
Breaking Through the Roadblocks
Because the burden of mental illness can be financially and emotionally over-
whelming, people with schizophrenia and their families need to rely on com-
munity support. It takes a village. Yet, some already-gaping holes in the so-called 
safety net are getting noticeably larger rather than smaller. A number of recent 
national surveys have described the roadblocks to recovery; we summarize 
them for you in the following sections.
Experiencing long delays 
in getting treatment
Because people typically tend to minimize or be unaware of early symptoms 
of schizophrenia until the disease is undeniable, there’s a lengthy gap between 
the time symptoms first appear and when they’re treated (see Chapter 4 for 
more on the course of schizophrenia). People with schizophrenia experience 
Being realistic about immediate “cures”
Medicine in general looks for “cures” as the 
definition of successful treatment. Although 
this approach may work in the case of surgery 
or a broken limb, chronic diseases — including 
schizophrenia — aren’t cured in one simple 
step. All the snake-oil salesmen’s claim for 
miraculous cures through use of a newly dis-
covered herb oil have failed to deliver a per-
manent “cure” as well. It’s more realistic in 
chronic diseases to see the stabilization that 
results from treatment as a positive recovery.

295
 Chapter 15: People Are More Than Patients
delays averaging 81/2 years before they get treated — despite research sug-
gesting that early recognition and intervention improves outcomes and 
minimizes disability. (It’s estimated that two-thirds of people with mental 
disorders remain untreated!) These alarming statistics point to the need for 
improved mental-health literacy that extends to families, family doctors, 
teachers, employers, and the general public.
Also, quality mental healthcare is unaffordable for many individuals and 
families. Despite advocacy efforts to implement mental-health parity legislation 
at the federal level and in many states, disparities between physical and mental-
health coverage remain in the form of co-payments and coverage (see Chapter 
7 for more on ways to finance care). State Medicaid and managed-care formu-
laries often restrict access to more costly but effective psychiatric medications.
 
To ensure that your loved one gets treatment as early as possible, trust your 
instincts. You know your loved one better than anyone else. If you think some-
thing is wrong with him (perhaps after reading this book or learning some 
of the warning signs of schizophrenia), be direct and suggest that he see a 
mental-health professional for an evaluation. Gently explain to him that the 
symptoms he’s experiencing (and you’re noticing) are often associated with 
a treatable mental disorder and that you’re concerned enough that you want 
him to check it out.
 
Don’t be surprised if he doesn’t think there’s a problem and dismisses your 
concerns — it may take some time for him to come to terms with his symptoms 
and accept help. Unless the situation is an emergency, be patient. Just because 
you finally realize something is wrong doesn’t mean he’s on the same page. (See 
Chapter 6 for concrete suggestions on how to deal with lack of insight.)

On the other hand, don’t wait more than a week or two. Wait for a calm 
moment when he’s open to listening and raise the issue again. Don’t let your-
self be deluded into thinking that if you just ignore things, they’ll get better. 
In most cases, untreated mental disorders just get worse. If your loved one 
does have schizophrenia, you want to get on top of it sooner rather than 
later, to improve the outcomes.
When your loved one agrees to see someone, offer to do the legwork to find 
a clinician or suggest how he can go about it (see Chapter 5). If your loved 
one is insured, he needs to check with his insurer (or you can do so on his 
behalf) to find out about the mental-health provisions of the healthcare 
policy. If he isn’t insured, find out whether your community offers free or 
low-cost services. (See Chapter 7 for advice on paying for care.)
Having no place to go in a crisis
According to a recent survey by the American College of Emergency 
Physicians, nearly 80 percent of emergency rooms report that waits for psy-
chiatric patients in crisis average four hours or more; another 10 percent 
said waits typically exceed a day. Imagine sitting in a waiting room for four 
hours or more with someone who is agitated, upset, and actively psychotic 
and being told to wait before you can even speak to a doctor!
The number of psychiatric hospital beds in most communities is insufficient 
to meet the need. Since 2000, there has been a 12 percent decline in the 
availability of community beds for individuals whose treatment needs can’t 
be met in outpatient programs. In 2008, the Treatment Advocacy Center 
reported a shortage of 100,000 psychiatric beds across the United States. The 
escalating costs of healthcare, an acute shortage of psychiatrists, and a scar-
city of community-based alternatives to hospitals have coalesced to create a 
crisis in mental healthcare.
Once considered places of last resort for individuals with serious mental 
illnesses who were at risk of harming themselves or others, even state hos-
pitals are no longer open to many people who need them. With states trans-
ferring financial burdens to the federal government, many state hospitals 
have reduced the numbers of their beds and now have lengthy waiting lists. 
As a consequence, with no hospitals or crisis alternatives available in their 
communities, people may be sent to hospitals far away from their homes and 
families or left to fend for themselves on the streets. This situation is particu-
larly acute for young children and teens with schizophrenia.
 
To ensure that you and your loved one aren’t left in a lurch during a crisis, 
prepare ahead. Check out resources in your community before you need 
them. Contact your city or county mental-health department and ask for infor-
mation about crisis services — and keep it in a place where you can easily 

297
 Chapter 15: People Are More Than Patients
find it when you need it (see Chapter 14). Check with the state mental-health 
authority to become familiar with the laws for involuntary commitment and 
assisted outpatient commitment, in case they’re needed.
 
When you first interview psychiatrists, find out how they could help you in the 
event of a psychiatric emergency. Do they have admitting privileges at a local 
hospital or contacts with a crisis-response team?
If your loved one is living in a supervised or semi-supervised setting that is 
adequately staffed, or if you’re able to sustain him at home, it may turn out 
that the crisis is relatively brief, and you may be able to ride out the crisis 
while he receives outpatient care. Many times, an acute crisis can be stabilized 
fairly quickly with rapid medication management and a bit more support from 
you, her psychiatrist, and other members of your team. Finally, both you and 
your loved one need to do all that you can by being alert to the earliest signs of 
relapse (see Chapter 18) and staying on medication that’s working.
Looking at mental illness as a crime
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, mental illness is three to four 
times more prevalent among individuals in the criminal-justice system than it 
is in the general population. Forty-four percent of people with serious mental 
illnesses are arrested at some point in their lives. This is because people with 
untreated mental illness often get picked up for petty charges and misde-
meanors that are due to their illness — sometimes by compassionate police 
officers who fear for the safety of these individuals on the streets. Police are 
twice as likely to arrest people who have mental illnesses, although most of 
them need treatment and services.
Jail diversion programs such as specialized mental-health courts (developed 
jointly by mental-health and criminal-justice providers) can provide more 
appropriate and less costly services. (See Chapter 14 for more about mental 
health courts.)
 
The Los Angeles County Jail has been called the largest mental-health treat-
ment facility in the world, spending more than $10 million per year on psychi-
atric medications alone. Nationally, there are more people with mental illness 
in state prisons than there are in state psychiatric centers.
 
If your loved one is arrested, you’ll have to move into action mode and inter-
vene quickly. Following the steps outlined in Chapter 14, try to prevent the arrest 
by explaining that your relative has been diagnosed with schizophrenia — a 
brain disorder — and needs mental healthcare. In communities, where there 
are no formal jail-diversion programs, suggest that the officer divert your 
loved one to a psychiatric emergency room for evaluation instead of making 
an arrest.

298
Par t IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
Make sure that your loved one always carries some form of identification card, 
either with your name as an emergency contact or that of her case manager, so 
the police will know who they can contact in the event of an emergency.
Being over-represented among 
the downtrodden
Unfortunately, there’s a strong association between schizophrenia, poverty, 
and homelessness. The large majority of people with schizophrenia have a 
hard time making ends meet and are often forced to live on the fringes of soci-
ety. Mental disorders are the leading cause of disability among adults — and if 
you can’t work in this country, you tend to wind up among the very poor.
Approximately one-third of individuals with mental disorders live below the 
poverty line. Nearly three out of four live on less than $20,000 a year; one in 
five lives on less than $500 a year. Plus, bureaucratic barriers make apply-
ing and appealing unfair denials for Supplemental Security Income (SSI), 
Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), and food stamps challenging for 
people with mental disabilities. And they may fear losing their benefits if they 
become employed at competitive wages.
With the stock of safe, affordable housing eroding, individuals with schizo-
phrenia are often last in line for public housing in their communities. Thus, 
finding a decent place to live can be extremely frustrating. (Chapter 13 
describes some of the limited options.) As a result, nearly three out of five 
individuals rely on their family or friends for financial support; half depend 
on them for housing. People with disabilities deserve safe and stable housing 
and opportunities to work and become self-supporting.
 
If your loved one has no money, she’ll have a hard time paying for treatment 
of any kind. To help her, make sure that she has applied for all the benefit pro-
grams to which she is entitled, such as SSI, SSDI, Medicaid, food stamps, VA 
benefits, and so on. The Social Security Administration (SSA) offers an online 
Disability Planner (www.ssa.gov/dibplan/index.htm) explaining how to 
apply and qualify for these programs (see Chapter 7 for more information).
The eligibility requirements for public benefits are confusing, and filling out 
applications and providing supporting documentation can also be a daunting 
task. Your loved one will likely need your assistance in filling out forms and 
keeping all relevant information organized and in one place. In fact, you may 
want to seek outside advice from an expert, someone who understands the 
intricacies of these programs, perhaps a social worker or case manager.

299
 Chapter 15: People Are More Than Patients
If your loved one has troubling managing money, SSA and the VA have rep-
resentative payee programs that allow another person (a relative, a profes-
sional, or a program) to oversee and assume responsibility for helping the 
individual to budget her money.
 
Working provides more than a paycheck to someone with schizophrenia. To feel 
productive, is vital to recovery. There may not be a straight line from A to B, but 
various vocational rehabilitation programs (see Chapter 7 and Chapter 14) can 
help your loved one define achievable steps to employment.
Receiving substandard healthcare
Disparities in healthcare are so great that people with schizophrenia die 25 
years earlier than their peers. One out of four people with a mental-health 
disorder, substance-abuse disorder, or co-occurring mental-health and 
substance-abuse disorders has no health insurance at all, which sets the 
stage for problems in getting timely healthcare. Many people with schizo-
phrenia never see any other physician besides their psychiatrists, who, 
unfortunately, are likely to focus only on their mental disorder as opposed to 
their overall health.
Yet, people with schizophrenia are more prone than the general population 
to get diabetes, heart disease, and other conditions (sometimes due to 
the side effects of antipsychotic medications), all of them chronic physical 
conditions that could be better managed with appropriate treatment. General 
medical needs are too often overlooked, ignored, or simply not addressed by 
primary-care doctors (if the person with schizophrenia even has a primary-care 
doctor). Nearly half of people with schizophrenia report that doctors take their 
medical needs less seriously upon hearing their psychiatric diagnosis.
 
Make sure that your loved one continues to be seen by a primary-care doctor 
the way you’re seen — for yearly exams and other basic and preventive care. 
If your loved one is taking one of the newer atypical antipsychotic medications 
(see Chapter 8), you need to encourage her to monitor her weight and be seen 
by an endocrinologist to lessen the risk of diabetes.
In addition, you want to encourage your loved one to get regular exercise. 
Aside from its obvious health benefits, exercise can help lessen symptoms of 
anxiety and depression. Joining a gym or attending an adult-education class 
focused on wellness can help your loved one improve her self-esteem and 
find new friends.

Par t IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
Dealing with a complex treatment system
Even when services exist, people with schizophrenia often find it difficult 
to access appropriate care. They may not know where to turn or may get 
bounced back and forth between providers. For example, even though co-
occurring mental-health and substance-abuse problems are commonplace 
rather than an exception, a substance-abuse program may not accept people 
with schizophrenia, and mental-health programs may not admit people with 
substance-abuse disorders. Instead of what has been termed “ping-pong ther-
apy,” people need an integrated approach to their disorders that addresses 
both conditions simultaneously.
Also, people may have to depend on costly and sometimes difficult-to-access 
public transportation or travel long distances to keep appointments with 
therapists. Like general medical care, navigating the maze is difficult under 
ordinary circumstances, but it’s especially difficult if you aren’t feeling at the 
top of your game. Think of the discomfort of riding in a train, feeling suspi-
cious about the person sitting beside you, and having to remember which 
stop to get off at. When and if a person finally arrives there, rushed and 
often underpaid providers may be insensitive to sensitive clients and further 
undermine their already low self-esteem by failing to listen to them or involve 
them in treatment decisions.
When people have no insight, their families often encounter inordinate diffi-
culties convincing mental-health programs that they need help until their rel-
atives have been overtly dangerous to themselves or others. Many providers 
hide under the cloak of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA), not only refusing to talk but also refusing to listen. (For more on 
HIPAA, turn to Chapter 14.)
Most of these problems are driven by the way services are funded and orga-
nized, leaving individuals and families burdened to find ways to bridge the 
gaps and make care more continuous. There are too few ACT teams (see 
Chapter 5) to provide aggressive outreach and follow-up, and the numbers of 
people on existing caseloads are often far too high. It’s estimated that these 
programs only reach one in five persons who need them.
 
To find programs that can provide your loved one with an integrated 
approach to care, contact your state or local mental-health authority to find 
out about case-management or ACT programs in your community. Having a 
person or team who can oversee care helps assure continuity across different 
programs and providers. Additionally, that individual can serve as your loved 
one’s advocate in making sure that services are accessible and that his needs 
are being addressed in a respectful manner.

301
 Chapter 15: People Are More Than Patients
Experiencing gaps between what 
we know and what we do
Clearly the medical profession’s knowledge about schizophrenia and its treat-
ment has been expanding at an exponential pace. Especially in the areas of both 
pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments, multiple articles and updated 
treatment guidelines have been published. These have been generated by 
research scientists, government-convened groups (like the National Institute of 
Mental Health) and professional organizations (like the American Psychiatric 
Association), all with the aim of updating clinicians with evidence-based findings 
that they can use to improve treatment outcomes.
Unfortunately, old habits (including treatment beliefs) die hard, and new 
information and knowledge about treatment hasn’t trickled down to the 
people who provide care as readily the researchers would like. Thus, many 
treatments and services that should be in place and that have clear scientific 
backup aren’t being used by all healthcare providers.
Books like this one and articles in daily newspapers and online (at sites such 
as www.schizophrenia.com) play an important role in reporting research 
findings to audiences who need to know about them. Don’t hesitate to ask 
your loved one’s clinician about whether your loved one could benefit from 
the advances you’ve read about.
 
You need to be a vocal advocate for your loved one, especially if she can’t 
advocate for herself. This requires constant vigilance (although you don’t 
want to make your loved one doesn’t feel like you’re hovering over her) so 
you understand her needs, as well as continuing education so you can keep up 
with the rapid pace of discovery. Read all you can whenever you can. Attend 
lectures and local, statewide, and national conferences sponsored by NAMI.
Facing pervasive stigma 
and discrimination
Myths and misperceptions still get in the way of full community acceptance 
of people with schizophrenia (see Chapter 16). Public awareness and under-
standing is still limited. In a recent NAMI survey, only one out of four people 
surveyed were familiar with schizophrenia. For example, people still associ-
ate schizophrenia with split personalities and serial murderers they see on 
TV; they don’t realize that people with schizophrenia are ten times more 
likely to be victims of violence than the general population.

302
Par t IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
Due to stigma, people are embarrassed to tell others that they have the ill-
ness or that someone in their family is affected. This leads to feelings of 
shame, humiliation, and isolation that prevent people from seeking treatment 
when they need it and makes it more difficult to cope. A study of mental ill-
ness in the United Kingdom found that one out of eight people wouldn’t want 
to live next to someone with a mental illness. Even treatment providers fall 
into the trap of forgetting to see their patients as people first, rather than 
faceless victims of a disease.
 
Discrimination and stigma restricts the choices that people can make. If your 
loved one has been diagnosed or you know someone with schizophrenia, 
become a stigma-buster and help educate others. The latter part of this 
chapter provides some suggestions of concrete actions you can take within 
your own community. In addition, NAMI has a StigmaBuster network, com-
prised of volunteers who help spot inaccurate media portrayals of mental 
illness and bring them to the attention of those responsible for perpetuating 
these inaccuracies on TV, in film, and in print. (To get involved, go to www.
nami.org, and under “Take Action,” click on “Fight Stigma.”) Also, the federal 
SAMHSA Resource Center to Promote Acceptance, Dignity and Social Inclusion 
Associated with Mental Health (www.stopstigma.samhsa.gov) offers infor-
mation and resources to help you understand stigma and its destructive effects 
on people with schizophrenia.
You can also do simple things to help reduce stigma for your loved one and 
others. Avoid the use of offensive terms like crazy, loony, wacko, or nuts. Use 
people-first language (see Chapter 12). Starting with yourself and your loved 
one, make it your personal mission to educate everyone around you that 
schizophrenia is a serious but treatable, no-fault, equal-opportunity, brain 
disorder.
Not having enough friends
People with schizophrenia need warmth and companionship like everyone 
else. If someone told you that he had a chronic health problem like cancer, 
you would react by offering him compassion and support. This usually isn’t 
the case when friends, employers, and even some families find out about 
someone having schizophrenia. Disclosing the illness too often creates dis-
tance from once-friends, leading to an overwhelming sense of loneliness. For 
this reason, only about half of those surveyed by NAMI said they would tell 
someone if they were diagnosed with the disorder. Imagine living with that 
secret and being unable to share it with more than a few people, if any.

303
 Chapter 15: People Are More Than Patients
Ongoing companionship and support from family, friends, and the community 
are essential ingredients to recovery. Consumer-, peer-, and family-run programs 
can be instrumental in helping people learn to live and cope with schizophrenia — 
and also in recognizing that they aren’t alone (see Chapter 9).
 
To help your loved one get the support he needs, encourage him to join self-
help and peer support groups in your community (see Chapter 8). And make 
sure you’re also getting the support you need as a caregiver by joining NAMI 
and actively engaging in your own life.
A Call to Action
You may feel so overwhelmed by your own situation at that moment that you 
feel like you can barely stay afloat. But by working collectively, and doing 
what you can when you can, you can change the face of treatments, services, 
and supports for people with schizophrenia. Take heart in knowing that 
NAMI and many other national organizations and concerned citizens take this 
task seriously. There is a citizen army working on your behalf!
 
There will be a time when you’ll be able to rise up and have the energy to 
advocate for yourself, your loved one, and others. You’ll be able to give back 
what you’ve gotten from others.
Here are some of the basic rules of individual advocacy:
 
 Be voracious in your quest for knowledge and information. Get your 
facts straight by harnessing and taking advantage of all the information 
available through people, books, and the Internet to increase your knowl-
edge about schizophrenia and the resources available in your community.
 
 Join NAMI and other consumer and family advocacy groups at the 
national, state, and local levels. Members of these organizations are 
like an underground railroad of people who know how to work the 
system. They know the programs and the players and, most important, 
they understand what you’re going through.
 
 Make your voice heard. Ask questions. If you have concerns about 
treatment or care, or a policy or legal problem affecting you or a rela-
tive, start at the bottom and move up the ladder. Let people know from 
the outset that you’re informed, interested, and part of a larger group — 
you aren’t part of the problem, you’re part of the solution!
 
 Whenever you communicate or advocate, put your best foot forward. 
Stay calm even if you’re angry, hurt, or disappointed. Be persistent yet 
firm — and listen. Use praise, diplomacy, and humor to get your way.

304
Par t IV: Living with Schizophrenia 
 
 Don’t sweat the small stuff. Keep things in perspective, keep your eye 
on the big picture, and never give up.
 
 Take care of yourself and live your life. Undeniably, no one would wish 
for any type of mental or physical disorder, including schizophrenia, but 
you can’t allow it to bring anyone’s life to a halt — including your own. 
There are too many reasons for hope.
 
Whether you’re only able to attend a NAMI meeting, write a letter to your local 
legislator, volunteer at a program, leave NAMI brochures in a doctor’s waiting 
room, or make a phone call of support to another family member, with a little 
help and advocacy from everyday people like you, people with schizophrenia 
will be able to achieve the goals all of us share: living a meaningful existence 
with a sense of purpose, joy, and promise for the future.

In This Chapter
 Differentiating between what schizophrenia is and isn’t
 Understanding the nature of people with schizophrenia
 Exploding the myths and misperceptions about the disorder and its treatment
S
chizophrenia is one of the most feared, misunderstood, and stigmatized 
disorders because myths and misperceptions abound about the diagnosis, 
its symptoms, and its treatment. Although there still is no cure, schizophrenia 
is an eminently treatable and manageable, no-fault disorder of the brain.
In this chapter, we dispel some of the myths that get in the way of effective 
treatment and that impede public acceptance and understanding of people 
with the disorder.
Myth #1: Schizophrenia 
Isn’t a Brain Disorder
Many people think that someone with schizophrenia is simply “acting crazy” 
and could behave normally if she wanted to. Nothing could be further from 
the truth.
Experts generally agree that schizophrenia is a no-fault neurobiological ill-
ness involving chemical imbalances in the brain and/or brain abnormalities 
that affect people in different ways. Symptoms of the disorder can include 

308
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
changes in feelings, perceptions, thinking, and behavior that are rooted in 
biology. Want proof? The growing body of evidence includes
 
 Measures of brain electrophysiology (as measured by EEG-type equipment) 
showing differences in people with schizophrenia
 
 MRIs of the brain structure showing enlarged ventricles and white 
matter damage in people with schizophrenia
 
 Functional MRIs showing malfunction in the frontal lobes as well as 
certain other areas of the brain in people with schizophrenia
What’s still missing at this time is the ability to identify the specific chemical 
imbalance or brain abnormality that occurs in any individual diagnosed with 
schizophrenia. (This would be the equivalent of a lab test like the one that 
confirms a diagnosis of strep throat.)
It’s quite possible that symptoms of schizophrenia are manifest in different 
ways for different people — just like one person can suffer a heart attack and 
experience chest pain, and another person suffering a heart attack may have 
pain in his arm or jaw, but not in his chest. In fact, scientists may eventually 
find that, like cancer or diabetes, there’s more than one type of schizophrenia.
Myth #2: A Person with Schizophrenia 
Has a “Split Personality”
Schizophrenia is not a split personality.
 
Because the word schizophrenia is derived from the combined Greek terms 
schizein (meaning “to split”) and phren (referring to the mind), people have 
long come to the erroneous conclusion that schizophrenia means “split 
personality.”
For more than a century, stories about people with split or multiple personali-
ties appeared in different forms throughout popular culture, capturing the 
imagination not only of authors and screenwriters but also of their audiences:
 
 Most students have read Robert Louis Stevenson’s tale of The Strange 
Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, in which both good and evil personalities 
are embodied in a single man.
 
 Supposedly based on a true story, The Three Faces of Eve was an Academy 
Award–winning movie portrayal of the life of Chris Costner-Sizemore, who 
was diagnosed with multiple personalities by her psychiatrists in the 1950s 
after witnessing two deaths and a terrible accident as a child. (Later, the 
psychiatrists involved in the case are said to have recanted the diagnosis.)

309
 Chapter 16: Ten Myths about Schizophrenia You Can Forget
 
 More recently, the movie Me, Myself & Irene, starring Jim Carrey, told the 
fictional story of a state trooper who develops a split personality after 
his wife takes up with an African-American dwarf.
Although these stories and others like them are fascinating and entertaining, 
they’ve only increased the public’s confusion when it comes to schizophre-
nia. In fact, almost two-thirds of people surveyed by the Harris Organization 
in the late 1990s still believed that schizophrenia was associated with a split 
personality. In a more recent online survey examining the mental-health lit-
eracy of university students, nearly two-thirds of them thought that a “split 
personality” was one of the main symptoms of schizophrenia.
The closest Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders 
diagnosis resembling the stereotypic split or multiple personality is dissocia-
tive identity disorder, a relatively rare and controversial diagnosis, the symp-
toms of which are distinct from those of schizophrenia. Making the diagnosis 
requires that at least two personalities routinely take control of the individu-
al’s behavior with memory loss that goes beyond normal forgetfulness. (This 
cannot be due to substance abuse or medical causes.)
 
People with schizophrenia have only one personality, but they have problems 
distinguishing what is real from what is not. So, if there is any split associated 
with schizophrenia, it is the disconnect between (a) an individual’s thoughts, 
behaviors, and emotions, and (b) what we call reality.
Myth #3: Schizophrenia Is 
Caused by Bad Parenting
Schizophrenia is a biological disease of the brain, with genetic underpinnings, 
and its causation has nothing to do with parenting styles.
For many years, even mental-health professionals were trained to believe 
that bad parenting, particularly by mothers, was the root cause of schizo-
phrenia — so that became the conventional wisdom.
Imagine how it felt to be on the frontline with a family member you love 
suffering from schizophrenia, only to be told that you’re the cause of your 
relative’s illness — either because you were too cold, too rejecting, or too 
permissive, or because you gave mixed messages! The guilt, shame, and 
sense of remorse that resulted created enormous gulfs between doctors and 
families, and between patients and their families.

310
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
With advances in research and new imaging techniques that have opened virtual 
windows into the living brain, doctors have learned that schizophrenia is caused 
by an underlying neurobiological susceptibility (probably predetermined by 
multiple genes) that is exacerbated by certain prenatal, environmental, or social 
triggers.
Now most professionals view family members as partners in care as opposed 
to seeing them as part of the problem. Therapies focus on the patient rather 
than the “pathology” of the family. Family interventions are aimed at educat-
ing families about the disorder, its symptoms, and treatment; helping them 
learn necessary communication and coping skills; and providing them with 
support for their demanding and complex roles as caregivers.
Schizophrenia does run in families: Having a family history of schizophrenia 
places offspring at a greater risk for the disorder (see Chapter 2). But this 
association is genetic and has nothing do to with parenting styles. If you 
encounter a dinosaur doctor who still clings to the idea that families cause 
schizophrenia, run the other way!
Myth #4: Schizophrenia Is Untreatable
Although schizophrenia can’t be cured, it can be treated and managed.
Less than 50 years ago, receiving a diagnosis of schizophrenia was akin to 
being diagnosed with a terminal illness. Families would resign themselves 
to the fact that their loved ones would live out their lives in state institu-
tions, far removed from their family members, friends, neighbors, and com-
munities, with little hope for improvement. People with mental illness were 
shackled for their own safety and protection, and locked behind bars for the 
protection of society.
With the advent of antipsychotic medications in the 1950s, it became clear that 
most people with schizophrenia could be successfully treated in the commu-
nity and would be able to live in less-restrictive settings. Now when someone is 
acutely ill, she’s typically hospitalized for a relatively short time (a number of 
weeks) until her acute symptoms are stabilized. Alternatively, treatment of an 
acute episode can sometimes take place on an outpatient basis.
Although scientists still haven’t found a “cure” for schizophrenia, psychotropic 
medications and psychosocial supports are highly effective in addressing posi-
tive symptoms (see Chapter 3 for more on the positive symptoms of schizo-
phrenia). The vast majority of people diagnosed with schizophrenia improve 
significantly with currently available treatments, and research holds the prom-
ise that people whose illnesses are now deemed “treatment-resistant” will be 

311
 Chapter 16: Ten Myths about Schizophrenia You Can Forget
able to be helped in the future. Scientists are also working on recognizing the 
earliest signs of schizophrenia among those at high-risk, to prevent the disorder 
and to intervene early to minimize its disabling effects.
Significant gaps still exist in the availability of evidence-based treatments 
to reduce the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (see Chapter 3) and to 
get rid of the cognitive deficits associated with the disorder, but ongoing 
research is targeted in these directions. Most experts believe that, with 
proper treatment, at least one-quarter of those diagnosed with schizophrenia 
totally recover, another quarter improve considerably, and another quarter 
show some modest improvement.
Myth #5: All People with 
Schizophrenia Are Violent
Unfortunately, the media often sensationalizes stories about people with 
mental illness who are involved in acts of violence because it makes for 
catchy headlines, feeding into people’s fears and misunderstandings about 
the disorder.
Although people with schizophrenia can be unpredictable, they’re more 
often victims of violent crime than perpetrators of it. This is because they 
often appear to be frightened and confused, making them look like easy prey 
for criminals.
When individuals with schizophrenia do commit crimes, they’re usually petty 
misdemeanors that are an outgrowth of their poverty and despair. For exam-
ple, a homeless person with schizophrenia might urinate on someone’s lawn 
because he has no access to a public restroom or may be charged with petty 
theft for stealing food when he has no money and is hungry.
When serious crimes do occur that involve people with schizophrenia, it’s 
because their illness is untreated or is aggravated by drug or alcohol abuse. 
Acutely psychotic patients may have outbursts of aggression: Untreated 
psychosis — as well as the presence of substance abuse — increases the 
chances of an individual becoming violent or aggressive in response to 
voices they hear, feelings of being persecuted or followed by enemies, or feel-
ings of loss of control over impulses. Psychotropic medications reduce the 
risk of violence as does substance-abuse treatment.

312
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Myth #6: People with Schizophrenia 
Are Just Lazy
People with schizophrenia aren’t lazy per se. However, they may appear that 
way due to symptoms of the illness, as well as the side effects of medications 
used to treat it.
People with schizophrenia often seem to lack motivation, energy, or “get up 
and go.” They find it difficult to adhere to a regular schedule; instead, they 
sleep too much, sleep too little, or keep irregular hours. They may show no 
interest in getting a job or spending their time productively — preferring to 
stay in bed or watch TV for endless hours. These behaviors may convey the 
impression that they are just lazy and unwilling to do anything for themselves.
Understandably, people get very frustrated when they see a loved one taking 
it easy while they struggle to make ends meet. When they try to motivate the 
person, they may be met with a flat “I don’t care” attitude. In addition, people 
with schizophrenia may show little interest or concern for other people, even 
those they love, and have difficulty making or keeping friends, or sustaining 
relationships with relatives.
For a long time, these “negative” symptoms were seen as side effects of 
psychotropic medication. This is true to some extent — but a constellation 
of negative symptoms is associated with the illness, including low energy, 
lack of interest in other people and things, and the inability to form social 
relationships and/or a lack of caring about social relationships.
When you understand that these symptoms are due to changes in brain 
chemistry and functioning, you realize how pointless it is to harangue your 
loved one with schizophrenia. It isn’t a matter of a flawed character or a lack 
of will — nor is it something she can just “snap out of” on her own. However, 
with proper medication and other supports, negative symptoms are often 
manageable (although they are more resistant to treatment than positive 
symptoms like delusions and hallucinations).
Myth #7: People with Schizophrenia Are 
Loners Who Don’t Want to Have Friends
Although people with schizophrenia typically have limited, narrow social net-
works, most of them would love to have friends and families of their own.

313
 Chapter 16: Ten Myths about Schizophrenia You Can Forget
In many ways, schizophrenia is an alienating illness. When people are ill, 
they may have peculiar mannerisms, poor hygiene, and odd behaviors, all of 
which may make them unattractive or frightening to other people. They may 
be suspicious, fearing that others are talking about them, don’t like them, 
or are out to hurt them. Additionally, they lack the social skills necessary 
to establish new friendships and maintain old ones — they may be less apt 
to understand social cues one on one, or to respond appropriately in larger 
social settings.
Schizophrenia is often associated with high rates of poverty and unemploy-
ment, too, both of which further undermine a person’s sense of self-esteem 
and confidence. After all, one of the first things someone asks you when you 
meet is, “What do you do?” Many people with schizophrenia only see them-
selves functioning in the role of a patient, idling away their time and passively 
accepting care from treatment providers and support from family members. 
After paying their bills, they may have no money available for social or lei-
sure pursuits. Stigma and discrimination make it all the more difficult for 
them to candidly explain their illness and its impact on their lives.
Yet, when asked, patients with schizophrenia often express a profound sense 
of loneliness and alienation and yearn for companionship. It’s only human to 
want to feel loved and needed. Struck by the illness in the prime of their lives, 
they may have lost contact with their close friends from high school or col-
lege who moved on socially, vocationally, or geographically without them.
Even after recovery, they may be skeptical about renewing relationships with 
people who knew them then, feeling embarrassed to explain the time they 
lost due to illness and/or disability. For reasons that are obvious, they may 
be ambivalent about relationships with other people who have mental ill-
nesses or with those without them. They feel like they simply don’t fit in.
As a result of these losses, people with schizophrenia tend to over-rely on 
family to fill the void in their lives. It’s not uncommon for adults with schizo-
phrenia to remain in their parents’ homes or depend on them for most of 
their social interactions. They may even be hesitant to participate in gather-
ings outside the nuclear family, such as holiday family get-togethers, because 
of the fear of being uncomfortable and misunderstood.
 
Peer support groups, therapy groups, clubhouse programs, volunteer jobs, 
social clubs, drop-in centers, and supported employment and rehabilitation 
programs can enable people with schizophrenia to gradually develop ties that 
make them feel more connected and better understood.

314
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Myth #8: People with Schizophrenia 
Are Stupid
There’s no association between schizophrenia and diminished intelligence. 
People diagnosed with schizophrenia have the same wide range of abilities as 
the “normal” population does. Yet there are reasons why people may assume 
otherwise.
Years ago, people with schizophrenia and those with developmental disabili-
ties (once called “mental retardation”) were often kept together in the same 
asylums, so it’s easy to see how this misperception evolved.
Because the average age of onset of schizophrenia typically overlaps with the 
time when young people are pursuing their education and careers, a person 
who is “doing nothing” — not attending school, not working — may be 
assumed to be of low intelligence, not smart enough to work or go to school.
Plus, the symptoms of schizophrenia and the medications used to control 
them can lead to specific cognitive deficits such as impaired memory, inabil-
ity to respond quickly, difficulty paying attention, and problems organizing 
and sequencing information. Many of these functional deficits can be mini-
mized through cognitive remediation programs.
Myth #9: When People with 
Schizophrenia Start to Feel Better, 
They Can Stop Taking Medication
They’re probably feeling better because they’re taking medication, and stop-
ping it on their own will increase the risk of relapse.
Schizophrenia is a chronic and relapsing illness that requires medication 
to be taken for the long-term. Just as someone with diabetes shouldn’t stop 
taking insulin or someone with high blood pressure shouldn’t stop taking 
blood-pressure medication, a person with schizophrenia shouldn’t stop 
taking her antipsychotic medication unless she’s advised to do so by her 
doctor and is carefully monitored.

315
 Chapter 16: Ten Myths about Schizophrenia You Can Forget
 
Studies show that when people stop taking their medication, they’re likely to 
have a relapse within the first year. The major reason people stop their medica-
tion often has to do with adverse side effects that feel unpleasant or uncomfort-
able. These can often be addressed by changing the dosage, adjusting how the 
medication is taken, switching to another drug, or adding another medication.
 
When someone is prescribed medication for a chronic illness, he may worry 
that he’ll need to take it for the rest of his life. In the case of schizophrenia, 
this isn’t always the case, but going off meds should only be done under medi-
cal supervision.
Myth #10: You Should Never Tell Anyone 
That Your Loved One Has Schizophrenia
With increased public understanding of mental disorders, families need to 
carefully weigh the pros and cons of disclosure.
For many years, people were terribly ashamed of loved ones who were diag-
nosed with schizophrenia. They never spoke about “eccentric” Uncle Joe who 
stayed upstairs in his room talking to himself or about Grandma Ethel who was 
sent away to a state hospital for most of her adult life. To have schizophrenia 
in your family was stigmatizing and reflected badly on other relatives. It was 
something that was only discussed behind closed doors.
Now that schizophrenia is accepted as a no-fault neurobiological illness, 
affected individuals and their families are more apt to be honest in telling 
friends, neighbors, and potential employers about the illness. That said, you 
still need to be aware of the potential risks because stigma still exists!
Peer and family support groups give people the chance to learn from each 
other how to better cope; they also provide some comfort — it helps to know 
that you’re not alone. And legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities 
Act has afforded protection to people who need accommodations in the 
workplace.
 
This doesn’t mean that you should indiscriminately tell everyone you know 
about your loved one’s illness. Determine for yourself how much to tell and 
when (see Chapter 11), recognizing that mental-health literacy and a spirit of 
openness goes a long way toward enhancing public awareness and minimiz-
ing stigma and misunderstanding. When the people around you know and 
understand your loved one’s disorder, they can provide you with compas-
sion, support, and understanding when you need it most.

N
ever underestimate the value of family and friends in the life of a 
person with schizophrenia. The support you give and the advocacy 
you provide can make a huge difference in the quality of your loved one’s life. 
In this chapter, we list ten ways that families and friends can ease the chal-
lenges of living with schizophrenia.
Select Your Team and Choose a Captain
To help someone with schizophrenia, it takes a team of experienced and 
caring people who are willing to work collaboratively with you and your 
loved one to:
 
 Diagnose the disorder.
 
 Plan and manage a comprehensive plan of treatment including medica-
tion, psychosocial rehabilitation, and supports.
 
 Help the individual achieve independence and move toward recovery. 
(Contrary to myth, a substantial percentage of people with schizophrenia 
are able to lead productive lives in their communities.)

318
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Every team needs a leader. If your loved one is showing warning signs and 
symptoms of schizophrenia (see Chapter 3), seeing a psychiatrist who is well 
versed in treating schizophrenia is crucial. That person will be able to make 
the diagnosis and place your loved one on an appropriate medication regi-
men as soon as possible.
 
The earlier the illness is treated, the better the odds of recovery and the less 
chance for the illness to result in disability.
Finding a psychiatrist who specializes in treating schizophrenia isn’t as easy 
as it sounds. The vast majority of psychiatrists (as well as other mental-
health professionals) in any community are more likely to treat people for 
less chronic and/or less serious disorders. But your loved one will receive 
the best care if he’s treated by people who work with individuals with schizo-
phrenia all the time.
Like other hard-to-find medical specialists, the best way to find a psychiatrist 
is to ask other families or professionals (including your loved one’s inter-
nist) if they can recommend someone. Your local affiliate of the National 
Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) — a family group providing information, 
advocacy and support — can put you in touch with other families who can 
share their experiences with you and vet any names that you have; you 
can find your local NAMI affiliate by going to www.nami.org/Template.
cfm?Section=Your_Local_NAMI&Template=/CustomSource/
AffiliateFinder.cfm (or by going to www.nami.org, clicking “Find 
Support,” and clicking “State and Local NAMIs”). You also may want to con-
tact the department of psychiatry of a local medical school for the name of 
an expert in your area.
 
A successful first visit is vitally important because it can determine whether 
your family member is onboard with — or alienated from — her doctor and 
her treatment plan. Interview a potential doctor by phone before making the 
first appointment, just to get a sense of whether the person will be a good 
match for your loved one. Sometimes, it’s just a matter of making sure the 
person has the right style.
You also need to find out about the public and private mental-health pro-
grams in your community that offer an array of programs and other profes-
sionals — such as case managers, social workers, psychologists, psychiatric 
nurses, occupational therapists, and so on — who will comprise the rest of 
your team.
 
Your local NAMI group, the local chapter of Mental Health America (go to 
www.nmha.org/go/searchMHA to find your local chapter), and your city/
county mental-health authority can provide you with information on mental-
health programs in your community.

 Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Helping Families and Friends Cope 
Understand Your Loved One’s 
Diagnosis and Plan of Treatment
Decades ago, some people with schizophrenia were analyzed on couches for 
years on end as psychoanalysts looked for the root causes of their illness. 
Most times, parents (especially mothers) were wrongly blamed for causing 
schizophrenia.
With advances in medicine and technology, physicians, scientists, and much 
of the general public now know that schizophrenia is a no-fault brain disor-
der that is a result of both genetic and environmental factors. Medication has 
become the mainstay for treatment — along with cognitive-behavioral, reme-
diative, supportive, rehabilitative therapies, and self-help and psychoeduca-
tional approaches.
Families no longer have to feel ashamed or worried that they did something 
to cause their loved one’s illness, or that they’re somehow part of the prob-
lem. In fact, families are part of the solution, because they can provide invalu-
able support and practical assistance to their loved one with schizophrenia.
 
When you and your loved one meet with mental-health professionals, you’re 
consumers who have the right to ask direct questions and get clear answers. 
The relationship is no different than the one you have with an internist. 
You’d never expect to leave the doctor’s office without some explanation of 
what he’s treating and how. Always make it clear that you’re interested and 
involved in your loved one’s care and that you have valuable information to 
contribute.
 
One complication that often interferes with family involvement in treatment 
is the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), 
designed to guarantee patient privacy and confidentiality. If you find a doctor 
who hides behind HIPAA and is unwilling to discuss the nature of your rela-
tive’s illness and its treatment with you, find another. You’re not asking for 
personal details about your relative, but you are owed a clear understanding 
of the diagnosis and course of treatment. And, of course, you can always pro-
vide information! If your loved one is willing, she can sign a release explicitly 
allowing direct communication between you and her doctor. (see Chapter 14 
for more information about HIPAA).
 
Even if your relative is reluctant to allow you to participate in her treatment 
now, her thoughts may change over time so don’t give up!

320
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Become the Archivist of 
Your Loved One’s History
Because schizophrenia is a chronic illness, recognize early on that your loved 
one is likely to be seen by many different mental-health professionals and 
receive a variety of different treatments over the course of his illness. We all 
know how hard it is to remember the details of what happened years or even 
several months ago. For better or for worse, you’re likely to forget some of 
your loved one’s treatments over time.
Resist the temptation to write all the information you acquire on little scraps 
of paper that will get left in pockets, go through the wash, and get lost over 
time. Buy a hardbound journal or notebook so you can document your loved 
one’s major symptoms, diagnoses, hospitalizations, medications (includ-
ing doses, which medicines worked best and which didn’t, side effects, and 
adverse effects, if any), and the staff who were involved in treatment.
Like other providers, mental-health personnel come and go. Close friends 
and family members are generally there for the long haul, so you can serve as 
the historian who documents and communicates which medications or other 
treatments worked or didn’t work in the past, and why. You provide the con-
tinuity over time and can best explain the events that preceded hospitaliza-
tions and the approaches that helped foster recovery.
In your little journal or book, also be sure to keep a list of the names, titles, 
phone numbers, and emergency contact information for your loved one’s 
doctors and other professionals intimately involved in her care.
 
Mental-health emergencies can occur any hour of the day and any day of the 
week. If you plan ahead and keep information at your fingertips, you’ll be able 
to handle things more smoothly.
Feel Free to Get a Second Opinion
Don’t be skittish about seeking out second opinions if you have any concerns 
about your loved one’s care, if there doesn’t seem to be any improvement 
over time, or if you have a nagging gut feeling telling you something isn’t right. 
You’d get a second opinion if you were undergoing a surgical procedure or if 
a medical treatment wasn’t going well; don’t feel funny about doing the same 
when dealing with a mental illness.
As a common courtesy, let your current doctor know you’d like a second 
opinion; it’s always a good idea to leave the door open in case you decide to 

321
 Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Helping Families and Friends Cope 
return to him. If the doctor is defensive about your getting another opinion, 
run in the other direction. Most competent professionals are happy to be 
able to collaborate with a colleague over a tough case (see Chapter 4).
If your loved one is part of a mental-health program and you have complaints 
or concerns, first speak directly to the person involved in her care before you 
raise the issue with a supervisor. Be open and give the individual a chance to 
respond. If you aren’t satisfied with the response, direct your concerns to a 
supervisor.
Remember: No one knows your relative better than you do.
Oversee Medication Adherence
It can be hard to understand why someone would refuse to take medication 
that — to your eyes — obviously helps him. There are a multitude of reasons 
why patients don’t adhere to prescribed regimens of psychotropic drugs. 
These include:
 
 Uncomfortable side effects
 
 Complex dosing schedules
 
 Confusion and memory problems that interfere with the ability to 
independently manage medications
 
 High costs
 
 Lack of understanding of the importance of staying on medication
 
 Denial of the illness
Medication is the key to treating schizophrenia. If your loved one isn’t stabi-
lized with medication, she’s likely to remain out of touch with reality. To the 
extent that your loved one allows you to do so, become a medication enabler. 
Encourage her to talk to the doctor about:
 
 Simplifying dosing schedules
 
 Changing medications that have bothersome side effects
 
 Finding out about insurance, patient assistance programs, and 
entitlement programs that can help pay for medications
 
Helping your loved one set up and fill a divided pill container encourages her 
independence in taking the medication as it’s prescribed.

Become an Expert
Receiving a diagnosis of any serious illness for the first time is life-altering. 
The emotional impact of being told that someone you love has schizophrenia 
cannot be underestimated. After you’ve had time to regain your equilibrium, 
you need to ramp up your knowledge and understanding of every aspect of 
the illness and its treatment.
You’re taking the first step in your quest for knowledge by reading this book! 
Depending on your appetite or needs at the moment, read it in its entirety 
or in parts. Then read everything else you can and take advantage of all the 
resources available on the Internet, in the library, and from mental-health 
organizations (see the appendix). You won’t have as much expertise as 
some of the professionals you’ll meet (if you do, find another doctor!), but 
you’ll gain enough wisdom to ask tough questions that need to be asked and 
deserve to be answered.
Familiarize yourself with the latest evidence-based guidelines and practices, 
which are available on the Internet at the National Guidelines Clearinghouse 
(www.guideline.gov).
Read memoirs of people who have lived with the illness so you can understand 
it from the perspective of those who have experienced its symptoms first-hand 
and of family members like yourself who have struggled and found ways to suc-
cessfully cope and move forward. A few such memoirs we recommend are

Don’t Neglect Yourself and 
the Rest of Your Family
Friends and family can easily get lost in the day-to-day responsibilities 
entailed in helping their loved one with schizophrenia. Don’t neglect yourself 
and the rest of your family. The surest recipe for burnout is to focus only on 
the person with schizophrenia to the exclusion of everyone else.
Make time in your day for:
 
 Sitting down for regular meals with your family
 
 Getting enough exercise
 
 Spending time with your friends
 
 Relaxing
 
 Continuing to do things you like to do
If you’re in a relationship, don’t forget your partner. Make time to do things 
together like going to the movies or visiting with friends. Often, relationships 
between husbands and wives suffer when a child has a severe mental ill-
ness because of conflicts over caregiving and the lack of quality time spent 
together as a couple. Recognize that you can be of tremendous support to 
one another.
 
If you have children in your household, don’t neglect them or leave them feel-
ing unappreciated. It may be hard for them to understand why so much time is 
being devoted to one member of the family. But if you make an effort to focus 
on each child’s interests and activities, your kids will be more understanding 
when you have to spend some time helping your loved one with schizophrenia.
Reach out to other families and support groups. They can be invaluable in 
helping you realize that you aren’t alone and that other people are struggling 
with similar issues in their families and making positive headway. Just as 
important, other families will truly understand your feelings and be able to 
share the wealth of knowledge, experience, and resources they’ve learned 
about. Need a doctor who has experience with Clozapine? Someone in the 

324
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
group is likely to know. Need a good CBT therapist? Ask the group for a list of 
three. Family members who have been there will be able to provide practical 
advice on how to react if your relative won’t leave the house or denies that 
she’s sick.
Familiarize Yourself with 
the Signs of Relapse
Not all the time, but often, relapse can be prevented. When your loved one 
initially became sick, what were his symptoms? When he had a recurrence, 
did he have the same sleep disturbance? Help your loved one spot problems 
on his own and take the right steps to get back on track. Talk calmly and 
openly about his symptoms so he feels comfortable doing the same.
Pride yourself on becoming a keen, but unobtrusive, observer so you can 
recognize the subtle signs that suggest the illness is recurring (particularly 
if your loved one is unable to do so on her own). Prompt attention often can 
help avert relapse and hospitalization.
Families find that the signs of relapse are the same, or very similar, for 
their loved one each time it occurs. These signs may include withdrawing 
from people, changes in eating or sleeping habits, severe mood changes, or 
changes in self-care and hygiene habits.
 
Even with good intentions, close oversight, and rapid treatment intervention, 
you may be unable to prevent your loved one from getting sick again or need-
ing to be hospitalized. If that occurs, change your focus to how you can help 
him recover — and don’t blame yourself!
Remain Ever Hopeful — 
With Good Reason
For a multitude of reasons, this is a time of great optimism in the field of 
mental health and mental illness. With recent research breakthroughs in 
genetics and neurobiology, there’s never been a more hopeful time for 
people with schizophrenia and their families as we learn more about preven-
tion, treatment, and rehabilitation.

325
 Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Helping Families and Friends Cope 
In March 2008, the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate approved 
mental-health parity bills that would help narrow the gap in insurance benefits 
between health and mental-health coverage and make treatment more afford-
able to many who have been left to fend for themselves. The proliferation of 
peer and family advocacy groups has gone a long way in educating the public 
and raising awareness of schizophrenia as a brain disorder that, although still 
not curable, is very treatable and manageable.
Families must maintain their sense of hope and optimism and convey it to 
their relatives. Your loved one may not live the same life you or she had 
expected, but she can live a “life well-lived,” one with a sense of purpose and 
dignity. You can take pride in her accomplishments and in your role in pro-
viding support. Try to minimize criticism and conflict; instead compliment 
success and find areas of agreement. Allow her to take some risks and make 
decisions on her own.
Many families and friends of people with schizophrenia find that the close 
reciprocal relationships they develop with their loved ones are extremely 
rewarding, as opposed to burdensome. They appreciate the opportunity to 
provide friendship and concrete assistance to help their loved ones over-
come the loneliness and social isolation so often associated with the illness. 
In return, they find that their loved ones are there for them when they need 
them, too. When one young man’s father became very ill, it was the son with 
schizophrenia who drove and accompanied his mother to the hospital each 
day to be at his father’s bedside.
And as difficult as it may be when you’re in the thick of it, try to maintain a 
sense of perspective. As bad as things seem, it’s likely that today’s crisis will 
eventually pass and become a fading memory (although, of course, you’ll 
have documented it in your journal — see “Become the Archivist of Your 
Loved One’s History,” earlier in this chapter).
Give Back
Sometimes it’s hard to ever imagine having the time to give back to others or 
having the expertise to become a trainer rather than a disciple. Your journey 
as a caregiver will create new opportunities for you to contribute not only to 
your loved one, but to your community and to society. Many family members 
and friends of people with schizophrenia find rewarding roles as volunteers, 
case managers, and group facilitators working with individuals with serious 
mental illness.

326
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
When things are more stable with your loved one and you’re up to the task, 
become an advocate for enhanced mental-health literacy in every segment 
of your community. As an individual or as part of a group, go out to schools, 
libraries, civic groups, and businesses to teach people about mental illness 
and dispel the myths.
 
Tell everyone you know about NAMI and spread the word that severe mental 
illnesses are no-fault neurobiological illnesses of the brain. Distribute NAMI 
brochures so they are available at every office, clinic, hospital, and library. 
Even many professionals aren’t aware of NAMI.
Early recognition, diagnosis, and treatment can minimize disability and 
lessen family burden. People need to understand these disorders before they 
hit home. Engage legislators, public officials, and the media in a dialogue. The 
more patients and their families are willing to speak out and be candid about 
mental illness, the easier it will be for everyone to understand that schizo-
phrenia is an illness that can strike any family.
Join the fight for mental-health parity and encourage support for psychiatric 
research at state and national levels. Participate as a healthy volunteer in a 
research project or encourage others to participate in clinical trials of new 
treatments. Most families and professionals recognize that research is the 
best hope for the future.

hen the symptoms of schizophrenia subside, keeping them under 
control and seeing that your loved one lives as normal and gratifying 
a life as possible becomes a high priority. In this chapter, we give you tools 
to help you achieve that goal, in the form of ten tips that may decrease the 
chance of relapse.
Staying on Meds
The best way for a person with schizophrenia to avoid relapse is to continue 
taking her medication as prescribed. Research shows that medication 
adherence reduces the risk of relapse and hospitalization.
Make sure your loved one sticks to a regular schedule, taking his medication 
at approximately the same time each day. If possible, he should link the time 
he takes the medicine to some regular event (for example, when he gets up in 
the morning, goes to sleep at night, or at mealtimes) or to some visual cue (for 
example, leaving his medication on the shelf where he keeps his toothpaste so 
he remembers to take it each morning.)
Anyone who takes multiple pills is apt to forget whether they’ve taken them. 
Instead of taking each pill from the vial that the medication came in, your loved 
one can spend a few minutes at the beginning of each week to set up a divided 
pill case. She may need your help to do this (either initially or on an ongoing 
basis), so don’t be afraid to offer. Setting up the case at the beginning of each 
week will allow your loved one to see whether she’s taken a particular dose.

328
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
 
Complex dosing schedules can make it hard for a person with schizophrenia 
to adhere to his medication regimen. If a doctor has prescribed one pill four 
times a day and another three times a day, find out if there is a way that the 
schedule can be simplified so that it’s easier to remember. Sometimes when 
medication is first prescribed, it’s prescribed more times over the course of a 
day, but afterward it can be taken fewer times per day.
Unless they’re very bothersome or dangerous, mild side effects aren’t a good 
reason for discontinuing medication. If the side effects of medication are 
bothersome, you or your loved one should report them to her doctor so he 
can change the medication or the dosage. If you or your loved one feels like 
the medication is no longer working or not working as well as you hoped it 
would, find out whether the doctor is willing to make adjustments, change 
the medication, or add another.
 
If your loved one feels that taking medication is embarrassing or degrading, 
remind him that hospitalization and relapse are far worse.
Sometimes people stop taking medication because they’re feeling better, 
losing sight of the fact that they’re feeling better precisely because they’re 
taking it. This would be similar to women stopping birth control pills because 
they hadn’t gotten pregnant that month, or people with diabetes stopping 
their insulin when their blood sugar levels were restored to normal. If your 
loved one says she doesn’t need her medication anymore, because she’s feel-
ing better, talk to her about why stopping can be risky.
 
If your loved one’s medication needs to be refilled from a mail-order phar-
macy and he’s running low, or if his prescription is running out and he’s not 
going to see his doctor soon, call his doctor’s office and let them know your 
loved one is worried about running out of medication. The doctor may pre-
scribe a small quantity to tide him over until his next appointment or until 
the mail order arrives.
Don’t wait until your loved one is close to running out of pills to refill her 
prescription. You never know whether the pharmacy will be closed on a 
weekend or the mail-order pharmacy will require more time to mail the pre-
scription. Make sure your loved one stays on top of ordering her medications 
and saving the money she needs to pay for them.
 
Even co-pays can be costly. If the cost of medication is a barrier, take advantage 
of a patient prescription assistance program (see Chapter 8).

329
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Avoid Relapse
Considering Depot Medication
Ouch! No one likes the thought of an injection. But if your loved one has 
already had multiple relapse episodes while taking medication by mouth, it’s 
possible that by using depot medication (a medication that’s injected so the 
person doesn’t have to take pills daily) these episodes may be avoided in the 
future. Depot medication is usually administered only once or twice a month.
Generally, these medications are the same kinds that are given by mouth, but 
they’re given in a form that’s retained in the body and slowly released into 
the person’s system. This may prevent relapse for two reasons:
 
 It eliminates the possibility that your loved one will miss his daily doses 
of medication and guarantees a steady dose at regular intervals.
 
 Medication taken by mouth is absorbed and directly circulated through 
the liver, where it’s metabolized; medication given by injection is 
absorbed directly into the body and avoids initial circulation to the 
liver. This may lead to a more effective use of the medication.
 
Recently, second-generation antipsychotic medications in depot form have 
become available (added to the first-generation depot medications, which 
have been available for some time; see Chapter 8). If while receiving a depot 
antipsychotic medication, your loved one is showing increased symptoms, it’s 
possible, under medical supervision, to augment the medication by using an 
oral form of the medication, to raise the dose between injections.
An injection only once or twice a month may be an acceptable trade-off for 
having to take (and remember to take) medication at least once and some-
times multiple times a day. Not having to take medication every day may 
allow a person with schizophrenia to feel like she’s leading a more “normal” 
lifestyle without constant reminders of her illness.
Recognizing Warning Signs
If your loved one has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, you and that 
person need to be aware of potential warning signs that might signal a wors-
ening or recurrence of the disorder.
Early recognition, adjustments in medications, modifications in your loved 
one’s environment, some extra support, or a combination of these things may 
help avoid relapse. The sooner this happens, the better the odds of warding 
off a full-blown episode.

330
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Here some of the signs and behaviors you (and your loved one) should be on 
the lookout for:
 
 Believing unusual things, like that the television or radio are talking to 
her, or that the smoke alarms or digital clocks in public places are taking 
pictures of her
 
 Saying things over and over that don’t make sense
 
 Hearing voices in his head
 
 Seeing things she knows aren’t really there
 
 Feeling as if everyone is against him or out to get him
 
 A sudden or gradual decrease or increase in her ability to think, focus, 
make decisions, and understand things
 
 Thinking he’s so great that he’s world-famous or can do supernatural things
 
 Having a hard time controlling her behavior
 
 Having periods of time go by when he doesn’t know what has happened 
or how the time has passed
 
 Having an unusually hard time keeping her mind on what she’s doing
 
 Retreating from social relationships that were once rewarding
 
 Becoming afraid of common things like going outdoors or indoors, or of 
being seen in certain places
 
 Feeling like something bad is going to happen and being afraid of everything
 
 Being very shaky, nervous, continually upset, and irritable
 
 Being unable to sit still
 
 Doing things over and over again — finding it very hard to stop doing 
things like washing his hands, counting everything, or collecting things 
he doesn’t need
 
 Doing strange or risky things, like wearing winter clothes in the summer 
and summer clothes in the winter, or driving too fast or acting like a 
daredevil
Although any one of these signs taken alone isn’t necessarily a sign of 
relapse, they’re things worth talking about with your loved one’s clinician 
before they worsen.
 
Because everyone has off moments now and then, you need to learn how to 
distinguish between an occasional lapse (having a very anxious day and getting 
over it) and a consistent pattern or trend that might signal relapse (such as 
regularly being too anxious to leave the house to go to school or work).

331
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Avoid Relapse
 
The following are generally considered signs of a true psychiatric emergency 
(see Chapter 14):
 
 Feeling like life is hopeless and worthless
 
 Thinking about dying, having thoughts of suicide, or planning to kill herself
 
 Taking risks that are endangering his life and/or the lives of others
 
 Feeling like she wants to cut herself or hurt herself in another physical way
 
 Feeling the temptation to destroy property or commit a crime
If your loved one has any one of these symptoms, you need to contact a 
mental-health professional, crisis center, or suicide hot line immediately.

Your Mental Health: A Self-Help Guide, a publication of the Center for Mental 
Health Services (CMHS), which is a part of the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).
Being Alert to and Avoiding Changes 
in Eating or Sleeping Patterns
Most times, an acute episode doesn’t come on like gangbusters out of the 
blue. Instead, when you look back, you realize that there were subtle signs for 
days, weeks, or months that something was amiss. One of the most common 
signs is a distinct change in eating or sleeping patterns. That doesn’t mean 
one night of having trouble sleeping or one day of feeling hyper-vigilant — it 
means a pattern that is different from normal.
Changes in sleep patterns can include
 
 Not being able to fall asleep at night
 
 Not being able to wake up in the morning
 
 Sleeping too many hours
 
 Getting only interrupted, fitful sleep during the night
 
 Having excess energy and little need for sleep
Changes in eating patterns can include
 
 Loss of appetite
 
 Excessive appetite

332
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
Your loved one should try to maintain a regular sleep schedule by going to 
bed the same time every night. Sometimes this is hard to do, but he can try 
to establish a bedtime ritual, repeating the same things each evening to help 
him sleep (for example, reading or listening to relaxing music for an hour 
before sleep). Sometimes taking a warm shower or bath, or putting lavender 
on the pillow, can help a person sleep more easily. Someone with schizophre-
nia should avoid doing shift work (for example, working nights or working 
day and night for a day or more) or traveling across multiple time zones, which 
can be disruptive to the circadian rhythms (also called a person’s biological 
clock, they control the sleep-wake cycle).
Your loved one should try to eat balanced meals and keep track of her weight 
so she knows that she hasn’t lost or gained too much weight.
Sometimes, changes in sleep or eating patterns can be signs of relapse, but 
they also can be side effects of various medications. Suggest that your loved 
one let her doctor know about these changes so he can help figure out why 
they’re happening and whether they’re any cause for concern.
Recognizing Your Loved One’s 
Unique Warning Signs
Very often patients and/or families will recognize that certain behaviors 
or symptoms occur prior to an acute episode. Getting a feel for your loved 
one’s unique signs is important, so you know which behaviors shouldn’t be 
ignored. For example, one patient we knew started to withdraw to her room 
and sleep incessantly whenever she was on the verge of relapse. At first, she 
didn’t recognize what was happening — until her sister brought it to her 
attention. Now, she’s vigilant to this cue and consults with her psychiatrist 
who helps her avert more serious problems.
You and your loved one also need to recognize the specific triggers that may 
lead to relapse. For example, one young man with a diagnosis of schizophre-
nia had several failed relationships with female friends that led to breakups. 
Twice, they precipitated hospitalizations. He learned to approach relation-
ships more cautiously and, in therapy, he found ways to lessen the stress he 
felt from such losses.

333
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Avoid Relapse
Decreasing Alcohol Use and 
Avoiding Street Drugs
Although most people don’t think of alcohol as a drug, it is one. The reac-
tion that your loved one has to alcohol will be determined by how much she 
drinks, as well as what other medications she has in her body.
Alcohol is considered a depressant, and when taken in large enough doses, 
it can put a person to sleep or even lead to death. Before your loved one was 
taking antipsychotic, antidepressant, or anti-anxiety medications, he may 
have been able to drink, for example, two glasses of wine, with almost no 
effect. However, because medications interact with each other, the effect of 
two glasses of wine when your loved one is taking other medications may 
be the equivalent of drinking four glasses. Your loved one can very easily 
become impaired on an amount of alcohol that previously wouldn’t have 
affected him in that way.
 
The safest approach is to not drink alcohol at all, but drinking a very small 
amount — such as half a glass of wine or a can of beer — isn’t likely to have a 
severe adverse effect. However, keep in mind that it may not be possible for 
your loved one to drink a small amount and keep herself from going on and 
consuming larger amounts.
 
Some people with schizophrenia sometimes try to self-medicate by consum-
ing large amounts of alcohol in an effort to control their symptoms. Talk to 
your loved one about this if you suspect it may be going on, and let him know 
that it’s dangerous. Alcohol does not have an antipsychotic effect, and it can 
actually make symptoms worse. Let him know that alcohol has side effects 
and toxic effects. For example, alcohol causes damage to the liver when taken 
in large amounts over a longer period of time. However, taking alcohol with 
other medications that may also cause liver damage, may lead to liver toxicity 
earlier than would be expected from using alcohol alone.
Even over-the-counter medications from a drugstore can be dangerous in cer-
tain situations. For example, medications that are used to control allergies, or 
to help with sleep cause drowsiness; combined with medications someone is 
already taking, they may lead to excessive sleepiness or even coma.
 
Drugs of abuse, or so-called street drugs (like marijuana, heroin, or cocaine), 
should be avoided entirely. There’s now clear evidence that marijuana in 
someone predisposed to schizophrenia can facilitate the onset of psychosis. 
Cocaine in itself is known to produce psychotic episodes, and in someone 
who already has psychotic symptoms (such as those seen in schizophrenia), 
this can lead to an acute and disastrous situation. Heroin, which is extremely 

334
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
addicting, can lead to a situation in which the individual not only needs to be 
treated for schizophrenia, but also requires a detoxification and rehabilitation 
program to be treated for the drug addiction simultaneously.
Compounding schizophrenia with drug abuse leads to poorer outcomes. 
So-called co-occurring (dual diagnosis) treatment programs are often hard 
to find in many communities, but people with co-occurring disorders must 
receive integrated treatment.
Building an Open and Trusting 
Relationship with Your Loved One
Although many people with schizophrenia don’t like to admit it, people close 
to them (family members, friends, and professionals) may be able to spot 
the first signs of a problem long before they do. For this reason, you need to 
develop a trusting, supportive relationship with your loved one and encour-
age her to maintain a regular relationship with a therapist, psychiatrist, and/
or case manager — people who can help her stay in touch with her own feel-
ings about how she’s doing, and who can point out any problems they see.
Be an active listener and a good observer. If your loved one expresses strange 
or uncomfortable feelings to you, hear her out and repeat to her what you 
heard (for example, “I’m hearing you say that you’re feeling . . .). Then say, 
“I know you feel that way, but you really are safe here” or “Let’s see if the 
doctor can help you think about another medication with less troublesome 
side effects.” Try to offer helpful options without being judgmental or dis-
missing her feelings. The only time you may need to be more heavy-handed 
in suggesting that she seek medical attention is if you observe behaviors that 
are harmful to herself or others.
Admittedly, watching someone decline is very difficult, and you’re often power-
less to change things yourself. All you can do is be there, provide support and 
guidance, and help your loved one move toward making the right decisions.
Reducing and Minimizing Stress
Stress alone doesn’t cause schizophrenia, but it can exacerbate symptoms 
and increase the chance of relapse.

335
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Avoid Relapse
Your loved one shouldn’t be too hard on himself — and you shouldn’t be too 
hard on him either. If he’s just coming out of the hospital or is just entering 
the workplace, help him devise a way to take small steps to reach his goals. 
For example, doing volunteer work can help him adjust to routines before he 
returns to competitive employment. If he’s returning to a position he previ-
ously held, part-time work is a nice way to ease his way back into the rou-
tines of the workplace. You might suggest whether this is something he can 
negotiate with his supervisor or the director of human resources. If he were 
coming out of the hospital after a major illness or after surgery, he wouldn’t 
expect to return full-time right away; the same is true with schizophrenia.
Your loved one may also need to lower her own expectations or those being 
placed on her by others. For example, if she was recently diagnosed with 
schizophrenia, she might need to get her illness under control before she can 
return to school. In the scheme of things, missing a semester or even a year 
or two from college isn’t a big deal. It’s common for people to take leaves of 
absence for all sorts of reasons. If your loved one has already graduated from 
college and is thinking about graduate school, she may decide that gradu-
ate study is too stressful right now and take some time off to work. This may 
require your loved one to educate the people around her (including you) and 
directly tell them that she wants to make every effort to reduce the stress 
associated with certain types of activities.
 
You can help in this regard, too — for example, if your sibling has schizophrenia, 
and your parents have always wanted her to be a doctor, you may be able to sit 
down with your folks and let them know that, right now, your sister is going to 
work as a lab assistant or radiation technician, but maybe she’ll decide to go to 
medical school down the road. Let them know that this is a good decision for 
someone who needs to minimize stress.
When you’ve been ill, social situations can also be stressful. It may be hard 
for your loved one to face his old friends or colleagues or to feel good about 
himself at cocktail parties where he meets new people. Tell him to take one 
step at a time. Suggest that he meet with one friend for a limited period of 
time — perhaps coffee or lunch — before he meets with groups or spends an 
entire day with one individual. He may even feel like he needs to spend some 
time alone dealing with his feelings or talking them over with a therapist 
before he takes the dive into the social world.
 
It’ll take time before he’ll feel back to his “old self.” In the meantime, he 
needs to be comfortable doing less. Suggest that he take one day at a time 
and gauge how he’s feeling before he takes on more — or too much.
Life often throws curveballs, even when you’re already having problems. 
A person with schizophrenia can receive a devastating diagnosis of a life-
threatening illness, be left by a spouse, lose custody of a child, be fired from 

336
Par t V: The Par t of Tens 
a job, or lose a close family member. One family member expressed it philo-
sophically by saying, “Life still goes on,” regardless of whether someone 
has schizophrenia. Needless to say, these are extraordinary stressors that, 
in some cases, may be more stressful for someone with a mental disorder. 
Added stress generally calls for extra support and help — for whomever, 
whatever the circumstances. So if your loved one is hit with an exceptionally 
stressful event, make sure you’re there to help him however you can, and pay 
attention for signs of relapse as well.
Planning Ahead
Sometimes, no matter what a person with schizophrenia does or doesn’t do — 
or no matter how supportive his friends and family have been — relapse can’t be 
avoided. For this reason, it’s vital to plan ahead for the possibility of relapse.
Keep a list of the medications your loved one is taking, a short history of pre-
vious episodes and how they were treated, and the names and phone num-
bers of key people and contacts you will need in an emergency. This 
may include
 
 A crisis hot line or mobile crisis service you or your loved one can call 
in an emergency
 
 Your loved one’s psychiatrist and case manager
 
 Your loved one’s health insurer (write down her policy number or ID 
number as well)
 
 The name of the hospital your loved one would like to be in, if 
hospitalization is required.
Before a crisis occurs, talk to your loved one about the best way to handle a 
crisis, and put the plan in writing. (You both hope you’ll never have to use it, 
but think of it like taking an umbrella with you on a cloudy day.) Reviewing 
past crises can give you a better idea of what works and what doesn’t.
Another aspect of planning ahead is making sure your loved one’s wishes are 
known and put in writing, before he’s incapacitated in any way, so that his 
wishes can be carried out. Having advance psychiatric directives and allowing 
someone your loved one trusts to have healthcare power of attorney for him 
will allow him to make his decisions and preferences known while he’s think-
ing clearly.
 
The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law (www.bazelon.org/issues/
advancedirectives) and the National Resource Center on Advance 
Psychiatric Directives (www.nrc-pad.org) are excellent resources for infor-
mation, forms, and more specific advice for creating advance psychiatric 
directives.

337
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Avoid Relapse
Hanging in There
It can be disappointing, aggravating, and stressful to watch your loved one 
adhere to her medication and still hear voices or see things that aren’t there. 
Don’t dismay. There are behavioral ways to cope with treatment-resistant 
symptoms (see Chapter 12), and new medications and behavioral techniques 
are always in the pipeline. For example, some research suggests that hum-
ming reduces auditory hallucinations.
Research offers the hope that new treatments will address symptoms and 
problems that may now seem beyond your loved one’s control and the reach 
of mental-health treatment. You need to convey this sense of hopefulness to 
your loved one!
