BUSINESS 
DRIVEN MIS
M
ost companies today rely heavily on the use of 
management information systems (MIS) to run 
various aspects of their businesses. Whether they 
need to order and ship goods, interact with customers, or 
conduct other business functions, management information 
systems are often the underlying infrastructure performing the 
activities. Management information systems allow companies 
to remain competitive in today’s fast-paced world and especially 
when conducting business on the Internet. Organizations must adapt 
to technological advances and innovations to keep pace with today’s 
rapidly changing environment. Their competitors certainly will!
No matter how exciting technology is, successful companies do 
not use it simply for its own sake. Companies should have a solid 
business reason for implementing technology. Using a technological 
solution just because it is available is not a good business strategy.
The purpose of Module 1 is to raise your awareness of the vast 
opportunities made possible by the tight correlation between busi­
ness and technology. Business strategies and processes should 
always drive your technology choices. Although awareness of an 
emerging technology can sometimes lead us in new strategic direc­
tions, the role of information systems, for the most part, is to support 
existing business strategies and processes. ■

T
his chapter sets the stage for the 
textbook. It starts from ground 
zero by providing a clear descrip­
tion of what information is and how it 
fits into business operations, strategies, 
and systems. It provides an overview 
of how companies operate in competi­
tive environments and why they must 
­continually define and redefine their 
business strategies to create competi­
tive advantages. Doing so allows them 
to  survive and thrive. Information sys­
tems  are key business enablers for 
successful operations in competitive 
environments.

business and technology. You must first recognize informa­
tion’s role in daily business activities, and then understand 
how ­information supports and helps implement global busi­
ness ­strategies and competitive advantages. After reading this 
­chapter, you should have a solid understanding of business 
driven information systems and their role in managerial decision 
making and ­problem solving. ■
before the information age. Now, it’s not at all unusual to read 
about a business student starting a multimillion-dollar com­
pany from his or her dorm room. Think of Mark Zuckerberg, 
who started Facebook from his dorm, or Michael Dell (Dell 
Computers) and Bill Gates (Microsoft), who both founded their 
legendary companies as college students.
You may think only students well versed in advanced technol­
ogy can compete in the information age. This is simply not true. 
Many business leaders have created exceptional opportunities 
by coupling the power of the information age with traditional 
business methods. Here are just a few examples:
	∙	 Amazon is not a technology company; its original business 
focus was to sell books, and it now sells nearly everything.
	∙	 Netflix is not a technology company; its primary business 
focus is to rent videos.
	∙	 Zappos is not a technology company; its primary business 
focus is to sell shoes, bags, clothing, and accessories.
Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, at first saw an opportunity to 
change the way people purchase books. Using the power of the 
information age to tailor offerings to each customer and speed 
the payment process, he in effect opened millions of tiny virtual 
bookstores, each with a vastly larger selection and far cheaper 
product than traditional bookstores. The success of his origi­
nal business model led him to expand Amazon to carry many 
other types of products. The founders of Netflix and Zappos 
have done the same thing for videos and shoes. All these entre­
preneurs were business professionals, not technology experts. 
However, they understood enough about the information age to 
apply it to a particular business, creating innovative companies 
that now lead entire industries.
Over 20 years ago a few professors at MIT began describing 
the Internet of Things (IoT), a world where interconnected 
Internet-enabled devices or “things” have the ability to collect 
and share data without human intervention. Another term com­
monly associated with The Internet of Things is machine-to-
machine (M2M), which refers to devices that connect directly 
to other devices. With advanced technologies devices are con­
necting in ways not previously thought possible and researchers 
predict that over 50 billion IoT devices will be communicat­
ing by 2020. Kevin Ashton, cofounder and executive director 
of the Auto-ID Center at MIT, first mentioned the Internet of 
Things in a presentation he made to Procter & Gamble. Here’s 
Ashton explanation of the Internet of Things:
“Today computers—and, therefore, the Internet—are almost 
wholly dependent on human beings for information. Nearly all

COMPETING IN THE 
INFORMATION AGE  LO1.1
Did you know that . . .
	∙	 The movie Avatar took more than four years to create and 
cost $450 million.
	∙	 Lady Gaga’s real name is Stefani Joanne Angelina 
Germanotta.
	∙	 Customers pay $2.6 million for a 30-second advertising time 
slot during the Super Bowl.1
A fact is the confirmation or validation of an event or object. 
In the past, people primarily learned facts from books. Today, 
by simply pushing a button people can find out anything, from 
anywhere, at any time. We live in the information age, when 
infinite quantities of facts are widely available to anyone who 
can use a computer. The impact of information technology on 
the global business environment is equivalent to the printing 
press’s impact on publishing and electricity’s impact on pro­
ductivity. College student startups were mostly unheard of

of the roughly 50 petabytes (a petabyte is 1,024 terabytes) of 
data available on the Internet were first captured and created 
by human beings by typing, pressing a record button, taking a 
digital picture or scanning a bar code.
The problem is, people have limited time, attention and 
­accuracy—all of which means they are not very good at captur­
ing data about things in the real world. If we had computers that 
knew everything there was to know about things—using data 
they gathered without any help from us—we would be able to 
track and count everything and greatly reduce waste, loss and 
cost. We would know when things needed replacing, repairing 
or recalling and whether they were fresh or past their best.”2
IoT is transforming our world into a living information system 
as we control our intelligent lighting from our smart phone to 
a daily health check from our smart toilet. Of course with all 
great technological advances come unexpected risks and you 
have to be prepared to encounter various security issues with 
IoT. Just imagine if your devices are hacked by someone who 
now has the ability to shut off your water, take control of your 
car, or unlock the doors of your home from thousands of miles 
away. We are just beginning to understand the security issues 
associated with IoT and M2M and you can be sure that sensi­
tive data leakage from your IoT device is something you will 
most likely encounter in your life.
Students who understand business along with the power asso­
ciated with the information age and IoT will create their own 
opportunities and perhaps even new industries. Realizing the 
value of obtaining real-time data from connected “things” will 
allow you to make more informed decisions, identify new 
opportunities, and analyze customer patterns to predict new 
behaviors. Our primary goal in this course is to arm you with 
the knowledge you need to compete in the information age. 
The core drivers of the information age include:
	∙	 Data
	∙	 Information
	∙	 Business intelligence
	∙	 Knowledge (see Figure 1.1)
LO1.1  Describe the information age and the differences among 
data, information, business intelligence, and knowledge.
Data
Data are raw facts that describe the characteristics of an event 
or object. Before the information age, managers manually col­
lected and analyzed data, a time-consuming and complicated 
task without which they would have little insight into how to 
run their business. Structured data has a defined length, type, 
and format and includes numbers, dates, or strings such as Cus­
tomer Address. Structured data is typically stored in a tradi­
tional system such as a relational database or spreadsheet and 
accounts for about 20 percent of the data that surrounds us. The 
sources of structured data include:
	∙	 Machine-generated data is created by a machine with­
out human intervention. Machine-generated structured data 
includes sensor data, point-of-sale data, and web log data.
	∙	 Human-generated data is data that humans, in interaction 
with computers, generate. Human-generated structured data 
includes input data, click-stream data, or gaming data.
Sensors and Bears—A Perfect 
Match
Two London-based entrepreneurs are building 
an Internet of huggable things for sick ­children 
to make any hospital visit more like a trip to 
Disneyland. Teddy The Guardian captures heart 
Living the
rate, temperatures, and blood-oxygen ­levels 
when a child grabs it by the paw to give it a 
cuddle. All measurements are sent wirelessly 
to nurses and parents, mobile devices. The 
new cute, cuddly teddy bear is packed full of 
sensors designed to track children’s vital signs 
and  help  quickly find out potential issues. 
Teddy The Guardian takes from 5 to 7 seconds 
to record measurements and is programmed 
to run five times per hour. Future versions of 
Teddy The Guardian will be interactive, using 
machine learning to find out the child’s favorite 
song or bedtime story and then play the related 
content for a more soothing hospital visit. Big 
pharmaceutical companies in the United States 
have already placed over $500,000 in orders 
and plan to donate the bears to hospitals 
and clinics.
This is clearly a brilliant idea, and soon we 
will see Teddy The Guardian in many local hos­
pitals and clinics. Can you identify any additional 
markets where Teddy The Guardian should 
focus? Can you think of any ethical issues 
related to huggable things? Can you think of any 
security issues related to huggable things?

Unstructured data is not defined and does not follow a speci­
fied format and is typically free-form text such as emails, Twit­
ter tweets, and text messages. Unstructured data accounts for 
about 80 percent of the data that surrounds us. The sources of 
unstructured data include:
	∙	 Machine-generated unstructured data includes satellite 
images, scientific atmosphere data, and radar data.
	∙	 Human-generated unstructured data includes text messages, 
social media data, and emails.
Big data is a collection of large, complex data sets, including 
structured and unstructured data, which cannot be analyzed using 
traditional database methods and tools. Lacking data, managers 
often found themselves making business decisions about how 
many products to make, how much material to order, or how 
many employees to hire based on intuition or gut feelings. In 
the information age, successful managers compile, analyze, and 
comprehend massive amounts of data daily, 
which helps them make more successful busi­
ness decisions.
A snapshot is a view of data at a particular 
moment in time.  Figure 1.2 shows sales data 
for Tony’s Wholesale Company, a fictitious 
business that supplies snacks to stores. The 
data highlight characteristics such as order 
date, customer, sales representative, product, 
quantity, and profit. The second line in Figure 1.2, for instance, 
shows that Roberta Cross sold 90 boxes of Ruffles to Walmart 
for $1,350, resulting in a profit of $450 (note that Profit = Sales 
- Costs). These data are useful for understanding individual sales; 
however, they do not provide us much insight into how Tony’s 
business is performing as a whole. Tony needs to answer ques­
tions that will help him manage his day-to-day operations such as:
	∙	 Who are my best customers?
	∙	 Who are my least-profitable customers?
	∙	 What is my best-selling product?
	∙	 What is my slowest-selling product?
	∙	 Who is my strongest sales representative?
	∙	 Who is my weakest sales representative?
What Tony needs, in other words, is not data but information.

CHAPTER 1  |  Management Information Systems: Business Driven MIS  9
Information
Information is data converted into a meaningful and useful 
context. The simple difference between data and information is 
that computers or machines need data and humans need infor­
mation. Data is a raw building block that has not been shaped, 
processed, or analyzed and frequently appears disorganized 
and unfriendly. Information gives meaning and context to 
analyzed data making it insight­
ful for humans providing context 
and structure that is extremely 
valuable when making informed 
business decisions.
A report is a document containing 
data organized in a table, matrix, 
or graphical format allowing users 
to easily comprehend and under­
stand information. Reports can 
cover a wide range of subjects or 
specific subject for a certain time 
period or event. A static report 
is created once based on data that 
does not change. Static reports 
can include a sales report from 
last year or salary report from five 
years ago. A dynamic report changes automatically during cre­
ation. Dynamic reports can include updating daily stock market 
prices or the calculation of available inventory.
Having the right information at the right moment in time can 
be worth a fortune. Having the wrong information at the right 
moment; or the right information at the wrong moment can be 
disastrous. The truth about information is that its value is only 
People in China 
and India Are 
Starving for 
Your Jobs3
“When I was growing up in Minneapolis, my par­
ents always said, ‘Tom, finish your dinner. There 
are people starving in China and India.’ Today 
I tell my girls, ‘Finish your homework, because 
people in China and India are starving for your 
jobs.’ And in a flat world, they can have them, 
because there’s no such thing as an American 
job anymore.” Thomas Friedman.
In his book, The World Is Flat, Thomas 
Friedman describes the unplanned cascade of 
technological and social shifts that effectively 
leveled the economic world and “acciden­
tally made Beijing, Bangalore, and Bethesda 
next-door neighbors.” The video of Thomas 
Friedman’s lecture at MIT discussing the flat 
world is available at 
http://mitworld.mit.edu/
video/266. If you want 
to be prepared to com­
pete in a flat world, you 
must watch this video 
and answer the follow­
ing questions:
	∙	 Do you agree or 
disagree with Fried­
man’s assessment 
that the world is flat?
	∙	 What are the poten­
tial impacts of a flat 
world for a student 
performing a job 
search?
	∙	 What can students do to prepare them­
selves for competing in a flat world?

as good as the people who use it. 
People using the same informa­
tion can make different decisions 
depending on how they interpret 
or analyze the information. Thus 
information has value only insofar 
as the people using it do as well.
Tony can analyze his sales data 
and turn them into information 
to answer all the above questions 
and understand how his business 
is operating. Figures 1.3 and 1.4, 
for instance, show us that Walmart 
is Roberta Cross’s best customer, 
and that Ruffles is Tony’s best 
product measured in terms of total 
sales. Armed with this information, Tony can identify and then 
address such issues as weak products and under-performing sales 
representatives.
A variable is a data characteristic that stands for a value that 
changes or varies over time. For example, in Tony’s data, price 
and quantity ordered can vary. Changing variables allows 
­managers to create hypothetical scenarios to study future 
­possibilities. Tony may find it valuable to anticipate how sales 
or cost increases affect profitability. To estimate how a 20 
percent increase in prices might improve profits, Tony simply 
changes the price variable for all orders, which automatically 
calculates the amount of new profits. To estimate how a 10 per­
cent increase in costs hurts profits, Tony changes the cost vari­
able for all orders, which automatically calculates the amount 
of lost profits. Manipulating variables is an important tool for 
any business.

multiple sources such as suppliers, customers, competitors, 
partners, and industries that analyzes patterns, trends, and

from multiple sources

multiple variables and in some cases even hundreds of vari­
ables including such items as interest rates, weather conditions, 
and even gas prices. Tony could use BI to analyze internal 
data, such as company sales, along with external data about the 
environment such as competitors, finances, weather, holidays, 
and even sporting events. Both internal and external variables 
affect snack sales, and analyzing these variables will help Tony 
determine ordering levels and sales forecasts. For instance, BI 
can predict inventory requirements for Tony’s business for the 
week before the Super Bowl if, say, the home team is playing, 
average temperature is above 80 degrees, and the stock mar­
ket is performing well. This is BI at its finest, incorporating all 
types of internal and external variables to anticipate business 
performance.
Analytics is the science of fact-based decision making. A big 
part of business intelligence is called predictive analytics, 
which extracts information from data and uses it to predict 
future trends and identify behavioral patterns. Top managers 
use predictive analytics to define the future of the business, ana­
lyzing markets, industries, and economies to determine the stra­
tegic direction the company must follow to remain profitable. 
­Behavioral ­analytics uses data 
about people’s behaviors to under­
stand intent and predict future 
actions. Tony will set the strategic 
direction for his firm, which might 
include introducing new flavors 
of potato chips or sports drinks as 
new product lines or schools and 
hospitals as new market segments 
based on both predictive and 
behavioral analytics.
Knowledge
Knowledge includes the skills, 
experience, and expertise, coupled 
with information and intelligence, 
that creates a person’s intel­
lectual resources. Knowledge 
workers are individuals valued 
for their ability to interpret and 
analyze 
information. 
Today’s 
workers are commonly referred 
to as knowledge workers and they 
use BI along with personal experience to make decisions based 
on both information and intuition, a valuable resource for any 
company.
Imagine that Tony analyzes his data and finds his weakest 
sales representative for this period is Craig Schultz. If Tony 
considered only this information, he might conclude that firing 
Craig was a good business decision. However, because Tony 
has knowledge about how the company operates, he knows 
Craig has been out on medical leave for several weeks; hence, 
his sales numbers are low. Without this additional knowledge, 
Tony might have executed a bad business decision, delivered 
a negative message to the other employees, and sent his best 
sales representatives out to look for other jobs.
The key point in this scenario is that it is simply impossible to 
collect all the information about every situation, and yet with­
out that, it can be easy to misunderstand the problem. Using 
data, information, business intelligence, and knowledge to 
make decisions and solve problems is the key to finding suc­
cess in business. These core drivers of the information age are 
the building blocks of business systems. Figure 1.5 offers a few 
different examples of data through knowledge.

INFORMATION: The item I have is a product that has the most sales during the
month of December.
BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE: The month of December this year is going to see interest
rates rise by 10 percent and snow stores are expected to cause numerous problems
throughout the East coast.
KNOWLEDGE: Given the unexpected ﬁnancial issues caused by the storms and the
interest rate hike we will oﬀer a discount on purchase in November and December
to ensure sales levels increase by 10 percent.

THE CHALLENGE: 
DEPARTMENTAL 
COMPANIES  LO1.2
Companies are typically organized by department or functional 
area such as:
	∙	 Accounting: Records, measures, and reports monetary 
transactions.
	∙	 Finance: Deals with strategic financial issues including 
money, banking, credit, investments, and assets.
	∙	 Human resources: Maintains policies, plans, and procedures 
for the effective management of employees.
	∙	 Marketing: Supports sales by planning, pricing, and promot­
ing goods or services.
	∙	 Operations management: Manages the process of ­converting 
or transforming or resources into goods or services.
	∙	 Sales: Performs the function of selling goods or services (see 
Figure 1.6).
Each department performs its own activities. Sales and mar­
keting focus on moving goods or services into the hands of 
consumers; they maintain transactional data. Finance and 
accounting focus on managing the company’s resources and 
maintain monetary data. Operations management focuses on 
manufacturing and maintains production data, while human 
resources focuses on hiring and training people and main­
tains employee data. Although each department has its own 
focus and data, none can work independently if the company 
is to operate as a whole. It is easy to see how a business deci­
sion made by one department can affect other departments. 
Marketing needs to analyze production and sales data to 
come up with product promotions and advertising strategies. 
Production needs to understand sales forecasts to determine 
the company’s manufacturing needs. Sales needs to rely on 
information from operations to understand inventory, place 
orders, and forecast consumer demand. All departments 
need to understand the accounting and finance departments’ 
information for budgeting. For the firm to be successful, all 
­departments must work together as a single unit sharing com­
mon information and not operate independently or in a silo 
(see Figure 1.7).

they must work together to achieve success.

You probably recall the old story of three blind men attempting 
to describe an elephant. The first man, feeling the elephant’s 
girth, said the elephant seemed very much like a wall. The sec­
ond, feeling the elephant’s trunk, declared the elephant was 
like a snake. The third man felt the elephant’s tusks and said 
the elephant was like a tree or a cane. Companies that operate 
departmentally are seeing only one part of the elephant, a criti­
cal mistake that hinders successful operation.
Successful companies operate cross-functionally, integrat­
ing the operations of all departments. Systems are the primary 
enabler of cross-functional operations. A system is a collection 
of parts that link to achieve a common purpose. A car is a good 
example of a system, since removing a part, such as the steering 
wheel or accelerator, causes the entire system to stop working.
Before jumping into how systems work, it is important to have 
a solid understanding of the basic production process for goods 
and services. Goods are material items or products that cus­
tomers will buy to satisfy a want or need. Clothing, groceries, 
cell phones, and cars are all examples of goods that people buy 
to fulfill their needs. Services are tasks performed by people 
that customers will buy to satisfy a want or need. Waiting 
tables, teaching, and cutting hair are all examples of services 
that people pay for to fulfill their needs (see Figure 1.8).

 The Interent of Things Is Wide Open—for Everyone!

oT is transforming our world into a living 
information system as we control our intel­
ligent lighting from our smart phone to a 
daily health check from our smart toilet. Of 
course, with all great technological advances 
come unexpected risks, and you have to be pre­
pared to encounter various security issues with 
IoT. Just imagine if your devices are hacked by 
someone who now can shut off your water, take 
control of your car, or unlock the doors of your 
home from thousands of miles away. We are 
just beginning to understand the security issues 
associated with IoT and M2M, and you can be 
sure that sensitive data leakage from your IoT 
device is something you will most likely encoun­
ter in your life.5 
In a group, identify a few IoT devices you are 
using today. These can include fitness trackers 
that report to your iPhone, sports equipment 
that provides immediate feedback to an app, 
or even smart vacuum cleaners. If you are not 
using any IoT devices today, brainstorm a few 
you might purchase in the future. How could a 
criminal or hacker use your IoT to steal your sen­
sitive data? What potential problems or issues 
could you experience from these types of illegal 
data thefts? What might be some of the signs 
that someone had accessed your IoT data ille­
gally? What could you do to protect the data in 
your device?
Production is the process where 
a business takes raw materials 
and processes them or converts 
them into a finished product for 
its goods or services. Just think 
about making a hamburger (see 
Figure 1.9). First, you must gather 
all of the inputs or raw materials 
such as the bun, patty, lettuce, 
tomato, and ketchup. Second, you 
process the raw materials, so in 
this example you would need to 
cook the patty, wash and chop the lettuce and tomato, and 
place all of the items in the bun. Finally, you would have your 
output or finished product—your hamburger! ­Productivity is 
the rate at which goods and services are produced based upon 
total output given total inputs. Given our previous example, 
if a business could produce the same hamburger with less 
expensive inputs or more hamburgers with the same inputs 
it would see a rise in productivity and possibly an increase 
in profits. Ensuring the input, process, and output of goods 
and services work across all of the departments of a company 
is where systems add tremendous value to overall business 
productivity.

Systems Thinking
Systems thinking is a way of monitoring the entire system by 
viewing multiple inputs being processed or transformed to pro­
duce outputs while continuously gathering feedback on each 
part (see Figure 1.10). Feedback is information that returns 
to its original transmitter (input, transform, or output) and 
modifies the transmitter’s actions. Feedback helps the system 
maintain stability. For example, a car’s system continuously 
monitors the fuel level and turns on a warning light if the gas 
level is too low. Systems thinking provides an end-to-end view 
of how operations work together to create a product or service. 
Business students who understand systems thinking are valu­
able resources because they can implement solutions that con­
sider the entire process, not just a single component.
Management information systems (MIS) is a business 
function, like accounting and human resources, which moves 
information about people, products, and processes across the 
company to facilitate decision making and problem solving. 
MIS incorporates systems thinking to help companies operate 
cross-functionally. For example, to fulfill product orders, an 
MIS for sales moves a single customer order across all func­
tional areas including sales, order fulfillment, shipping, bill­
ing, and finally customer service. Although different functional 
areas handle different parts of the 
sale, thanks to MIS, to the cus­
tomer the sale is one continuous 
process. If one part of the com­
pany is experiencing problems, 
however, then, like the car without 
a steering wheel, the entire system 
fails. If order fulfillment packages 
the wrong product, it will not mat­
ter that shipping, billing, and cus­
tomer service did their jobs right, 
since the customer will not be 
satisfied when he or she opens the 
package.
MIS can be an important enabler 
of business success and innova­
tion. This is not to say that MIS 
equals business success and inno­
vation, or that MIS represents 
business success and innovation. 
MIS is a tool that is most valuable 
when it leverages the talents of 
people who know how to use and 
manage it effectively. To perform

Who Really Won the 2014 Winter Olympics?
If you were watching the 2014 Winter Olympics, I bet you were excited 
to see your country and its amazing athletes compete. As you were fol­
lowing the Olympics day by day, you were probably checking different 
websites to see how your country ranked. And depending on the web­
site you visited, you could get a very different answer to this seemingly 
easy question. On the NBC and ESPN networks, the United States ranked 
second, and on the official Sochie Olympic website, the United States 
ranked fourth. The simple question of who won the 2014 Winter Olym­
pics changes significantly, depending on whom you asked.4
In a group, take a look at the following two 
charts and brainstorm the reasons each 
internationally recognized source has a 
­different listing for the top five ­winners. 
What measurement is each chart using to 
determine the winner? Who do you believe 
is the winner? As a manager, what do you 
need to understand when reading or listen­
ing to business forecasts and reports?

16  MODULE 1  |  Business Driven MIS
the MIS function effectively, almost all com­
panies, particularly large and medium-sized 
ones, have an internal MIS department, often 
called information technology (IT), informa­
tion systems (IS), or management informa­
tion systems (MIS). For the purpose of this 
text, we will refer to it as MIS.
MIS Department Roles 
and Responsibilities
Management information systems is a relatively 
new functional area, having been around formally in 
most organizations only for about 40 years. Job titles, 
roles, and responsibilities often differ dramatically 
from organization to organization. Nonetheless, clear 
trends are developing toward elevating some MIS 
positions within an organization to the strategic level.
Most organizations maintain positions such as chief 
executive officer (CEO), chief financial officer 
(CFO), and chief operations officer (COO) at the 
strategic level. Recently there are more MIS-related 
strategic positions such as chief information officer 
(CIO), chief data officer (CDO), chief technology 
officer (CTO), chief security officer (CSO), chief 
privacy officer (CPO), and chief knowledge officer 
(CKO). See Figure 1.11.
The chief information officer (CIO) is responsible 
for (1) overseeing all uses of information technology 
and (2) ensuring the strategic alignment of MIS with 
business goals and objectives. The CIO often reports 
directly to the CEO. CIOs must possess a solid and 
detailed understanding of every aspect of an organiza­
tion coupled with tremendous insight into the capabil­
ity of MIS. Broad functions of a CIO include:
1.  Manager—ensure the delivery of all MIS 
projects, on time and within budget.
2.  Leader—ensure the strategic vision of 
MIS is in line with the strategic vision of 
the organization.
3.  Communicator—advocate and commu­
nicate the MIS strategy by building and 
maintaining strong executive relationships.
The chief data officer (CDO) is responsible 
for determining the types of information the 
enterprise will capture, retain, analyze, and 
share. The difference between the CIO and 
CDO is that the CIO is responsible for the infor­
mation systems through which data is stored and 
processed, while the CDO is responsible for the 
data, regardless of the information system.
The chief technology officer (CTO) is 
responsible for ensuring the throughput, 
speed, accuracy, availability, and reliability

of an organization’s information technology. CTOs are similar 
to CIOs, except that CIOs take on the additional responsibility 
for effectiveness of ensuring that MIS is aligned with the organi­
zation’s strategic initiatives. CTOs have direct responsibility for 
ensuring the efficiency of MIS systems throughout the organiza­
tion. Most CTOs possess well-rounded knowledge of all aspects 
of MIS, including hardware, software, and telecommunications.
The chief security officer (CSO) is responsible for ensur­
ing the security of MIS systems and developing strategies and 
MIS safeguards against attacks from hackers and viruses. The 
role of a CSO has been elevated in recent years because of the 
number of attacks from hackers and viruses. Most CSOs pos­
sess detailed knowledge of networks and telecommunications 
because hackers and viruses usually find their way into MIS 
systems through networked computers.
The chief privacy officer (CPO) is responsible for ensuring 
the ethical and legal use of information within an organiza­
tion. CPOs are the newest senior executive position in MIS. 
Recently, 150 of the Fortune 500 companies added the CPO 
position to their list of senior executives. Many CPOs are law­
yers by training, enabling them to understand the often com­
plex legal issues surrounding the use of information.
The chief knowledge officer (CKO) is responsible for 
collecting, maintaining, and distributing the organiza­
tion’s knowledge. The CKO designs programs 
and systems that make it easy for people to reuse 
knowledge. These systems create repositories 
of organizational documents, methodologies, 
tools, and ­practices, and they establish methods 
for filtering the information. The CKO must con­
tinuously encourage employee contributions to 
keep the systems up-to-date. The CKO can contrib­
ute directly to the organization’s bottom line by 
reducing the learning curve for new employees or 
employees taking on new roles.
Danny Shaw was the first CKO at Children’s Hospital in 
Boston. His initial task was to unite information from dis­
parate systems to enable analysis of both the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the hospital’s 
care. Shaw started by building a 
series of small, integrated infor­
mation systems that quickly dem­
onstrated value. He then gradually 
built on those successes, creating 
a knowledge-enabled organization one layer at a time. Shaw’s 
information systems have enabled administrative and clinical 
operational analyses.
With the election of President Barack Obama comes the 
appointment of the first-ever national chief technology offi­
cer (CTO). The job description states that the first CTO must 
“ensure the safety of our networks and lead an interagency 
effort, working with chief technology and chief information 
officers of each of the federal agencies, to ensure that they use 
best-in-class technologies and share best practices.” A federal-
level CTO demonstrates the ongoing growth of technology 
positions outside corporate America. In the future expect to see 
many more technology positions in government and nonprofit 
organizations.

All the above MIS positions and responsibilities are critical 
to an organization’s success. While many organizations may 
not have a different individual for each of these positions, they 
must have leaders taking responsibility for all these areas of 
concern. The individuals responsible for enterprisewide MIS 
and MIS-related issues must provide guidance and support to 
the organization’s employees. According to  Fast Company 
magazine a few ­executive levels you might see created over the 
next decade include:
	∙	 Chief intellectual property officer will manage and defend 
intellectual property, copyrights, and patents.   The world of 
intellectual property law is vast and complicated as new inno­
vations continually enter the market. Companies in the near 
future will need a core leadership team member who can not 
only wade through the dizzying sea of intellectual property laws 
and patents to ensure their own compliance, but also remain 
vigilant to protect their own company against infringement.
	∙	 Chief automation officer determines if a person or business 
process can be replaced by a robot or software. As we con­
tinue to automate jobs a member of the core leadership team 
of the future will be put in charge of identifying opportunities for 
companies to become more competitive through automation.
	∙	 Chief user experience officer will create the optimal rela­
tionship between user and technology. User experience used 
to be an afterthought for hardware and software designers. 
Now that bulky instruction manuals are largely (and thank­
fully) a thing of the past, technology companies need to 
ensure that their products are intuitive from the moment they 
are activated.
MIS skills gap is the difference between existing MIS work­
place knowledge and the knowledge required to fulfill the 
business goals and strategies. Closing the MIS skills gap by 
aligning the current workforce with potential future business 
needs is a complicated proposition. Today, employers often

struggle to locate and retain qualified MIS talent, especially 
individuals with application development, information secu­
rity, and data analysis skills.
Common approaches to closing an MIS skills gap include 
social recruiting, off-site training, mentoring services,   and 
partnerships with universities. In many instances, an MIS job 
will remain unfilled for an extended period of time when an 
employer needs to hire someone who has a very specific set 
of skills. In recruiting lingo, such candidates are referred to 
as purple squirrels. Because squirrels in the real world are not 
often purple, the implication is that finding the perfect job can­
didate with exactly the right qualifications, education and sal­
ary expectations can be a daunting–if not impossible—task.

Running a company today is similar to leading an army; the top 
manager or leader ensures all participants are heading in the right 
direction and completing their goals and objectives. Companies 
lacking leadership quickly implode as employees head in differ­
ent directions attempting to achieve conflicting goals. To combat 
these challenges, leaders communicate and execute business strat­
egies (from the Greek word stratus for army and ago for leading). 
A business strategy is a leadership plan that achieves a spe­
cific set of goals or objectives such as increasing sales, decreasing 
costs, entering new markets, or developing new products or ser­
vices. A stakeholder is a person or group that has an interest or 
concern in an organization. Stakeholders drive business strategies, 
and depending on the stakeholder’s perspective, the business strat­
egy can change. It is not uncommon to find stakeholders’ busi­
ness strategies have conflicting interests such as investors looking

Safekeeping Data
In the past few years, data collection rates have skyrocketed, and some 
estimate we have collected more data in the past four years than since 
the beginning of time. According to International Data Corporation, data 
collection amounts used to double every four years. With the massive 
growth of smart phones, tablets, and wearable technology devices, it 
seems as though data is being collected from everything, everywhere, all 
the time. It is estimated that data collection is doubling every two years, 
and soon it will double every six months. That is a lot of data! With the 
explosion of data collection, CTOs, CIOs, and CSOs are facing extremely 
difficult times as the threats to steal corporate sensitive data also grow­
ing exponentially. Hackers and criminals have recently stolen sensitive 
data from retail giant Target and even the Federal Reserve Bank.6
To operate, sensitive data has to flow outside an organization to 
partners, suppliers, community, government, and shareholders. List 10 
types of sensitive data found in a common organization. Review the 
list of stakeholders; determine which types of sensitive data each has 
access to and whether you have any concerns about sharing this data.

using one of the four business strategies discussed in this section help 
you address your data leakage concerns?

Good leaders also anticipate unex­
pected misfortunes, from strikes 
and economic recessions to natu­
ral disasters. Their business strategies build in buffers or slack, 
allowing the company the ability to ride out any storm and 
defend against competitive or environmental threats. Of course, 
updating business strategies is a continuous undertaking as 
internal and external environments rapidly change. Business 
strategies that match core company competencies to opportuni­
ties result in competitive advantages, a key to success!
A competitive advantage is a feature of a product or service 
on which customers place a greater value than they do on ­similar 
offerings from competitors. Competitive advantages provide the 
same product or service either at a lower price or with additional 
value that can fetch premium prices. Unfortunately, competitive 
advantages are typically temporary, because competitors often 
quickly seek ways to duplicate them. In turn, organizations 
must develop a strategy based on a new competitive advantage. 
Ways that companies duplicate competitive advantages include 
acquiring the new technology, copying the business operations, 
and hiring away key employees. The introduction of Apple’s 
iPod and iTunes, a brilliant merger of technology, business, and 
entertainment, offers an excellent example.
In early 2000, Steve Jobs was fixated on developing video edit­
ing software when he suddenly realized that millions of people 
were using computers to listen to music, a new trend in the 
industry catapulted by illegal online services such as Napster. 
Jobs was worried that he was looking in the wrong direction 
and had missed the opportunity to jump on the online music 
bandwagon. He moved fast, however, and within four months 
he had developed the first version of iTunes for the Mac. Jobs’ 
next challenge was to make a portable iTunes player that could 
hold thousands of songs and be completely transportable. 
Within nine months the iPod was born. With the combination 
of iTunes and iPod, Apple created a significant competitive 
advantage in the marketplace. Many firms began following 
Apple’s lead by creating portable music players to compete 
with the iPod. In addition, Apple continues to create new and

exciting products to gain competitive advantages, such as its 
iPad, a larger version of the iPod that functions more as a com­
puter than a music player.7
When a company is the first to market with a competitive 
advantage, it gains a particular benefit, such as Apple did with 
its iPod. This first-mover advantage occurs when a com­
pany can significantly increase its market share by being first 
with a new competitive advantage. FedEx created a first-mover 
advantage by developing its customer self-service software, 
which allows people to request parcel pickups, print mailing 
slips, and track parcels online. Other parcel delivery compa­
nies quickly began creating their own online services. Today, 
customer self-service on the Internet is a standard feature of the 
parcel delivery business.
Competitive intelligence is the process of gathering informa­
tion about the competitive environment, including competitors’ 
plans, activities, and products, to improve a company’s ability 
to succeed. It means understanding and learning as much as 
possible as soon as possible about what is occurring outside the 
company to remain competitive. Frito-Lay, a premier provider 
of snack foods such as Cracker Jacks and Cheetos, does not send 
its sales representatives into gro­
cery stores just to stock shelves; 
they carry handheld computers 
and record the product offerings, 
inventory, and even product loca­
tions of competitors. Frito-Lay 
uses this information to gain com­
petitive intelligence on everything 
from how well competing products 
are selling to the strategic place­
ment of its own products.    Man­
agers use four common tools to 
analyze competitive intelligence 
and develop competitive advan­
tages as displayed in Figure 1.13.

Are you looking for great career 
advice? Here it is: Never post any­
thing on publicly accessible websites 
that you would not feel comfortable 
showing a recruiter or hiring man­
ager. This includes inappropriate 
photos; negative comments about 
jobs, professors, or people; and binge drinking 
at a holiday party. Future employers will Google you!
The bad news: You have to continue to keep your cyber profile 
squeaky clean for the rest of your life. Companies can and will fire you for 
inappropriate website postings. One interesting story occurred when two 
employees created a private, password-protected group on Facebook 
where they would complain about their jobs, post derogatory comments 
about their managers, and highlight new top-secret product information. 
The managers, being computer savvy, obtained the password and imme­
diately fired the two individuals after reviewing the site. Now one of the 
individuals is suing the former managers for invasion of privacy.

Michael Porter, a university professor at Harvard Business 
School, identified the following pressures that can hurt poten­
tial sales:
	∙	 Knowledgeable customers can force down prices by pitting 
rivals against each other.
	∙	 Influential suppliers can drive down profits by charging higher 
prices for supplies.
	∙	 Competition can steal customers.
	∙	 New market entrants can steal potential investment capital.
	∙	 Substitute products can steal customers.
Formally defined, Porter’s Five Forces Model 
analyzes the competitive forces within the envi­
ronment in which a company operates to assess 
the potential for profitability in an industry. Its 
purpose is to combat these competitive forces 
by identifying opportunities, competitive advan­
tages, and competitive intelligence. If the forces 
are strong, they increase competition; if the 
forces are weak, they decrease competition. This 
section details each of the forces and its associ­
ated MIS business strategy (see Figure 1.15).9

SWOT Your Student
What is your dream job? Do you have the right skills and abilities to land the job of your dreams? If not, do you have a plan to acquire 
those sought-after skills and abilities? Do you have a personal career plan or strategy? Just like a business, you can perform a 
­personal SWOT analysis to ensure your career plan will be successful. You want to know your strengths and recognize 
career opportunities while mitigating your weaknesses and any threats that can potentially derail your career plans. A key 
area where many people struggle is technology, and without the right technical skills, you might find you are not quali­
fied for your dream job. One of the great benefits of this course is its ability to help you prepare for a career in business by 
understanding the key role technology plays in the different industries and functional areas. ­Regardless of your major, you 
will all use business driven information systems to complete the tasks and assignments associated with your career.
Perform a personal SWOT analysis for your career plan, based on your current skills, talents, and knowledge. Be sure to 
focus on your personal career goals, including the functional business area in which you want to work and the potential 
industry you are targeting, such as health care, telecommunications, retail, or travel.
After completing your personal SWOT analysis, take a look 
at the table of contents in this text and determine whether this 
course will eliminate any of your weaknesses or create new 
strengths. Determine whether you can find new opportunities 
or mitigate threats based on the material we cover over the 
next several weeks. For example, Chapter 9 covers project 
management in detail—a key skill for any business professional 
who must run a team. Learning how to assign and track work 
status will be a key tool for any new business professional. 
Where would you place this great skill in your SWOT analysis? 
Did it help eliminate any of your weaknesses? When you have 
­finished this exercise, compare your SWOT with your peers to 
see what kind of competition you will encounter when you enter 
the workforce.

their sensitivity to price, size of orders, differences between com­
petitors, and availability of substitute products. If buyer power 
is high, customers can force a company and its competitors to 
compete on price, which typically drives prices down.
One way to reduce buyer power is by manipulating switching 
costs, costs that make customers reluctant to switch to another 
product or service. Switching costs include financial as well as 
intangible values. The cost of switching doctors, for instance, 
includes the powerful intangible components of having to build 
relationships with the new doctor and nurses, as well as trans­
ferring all your medical history. With MIS, however, patients 
can store their medical records on DVDs or thumb drives, 
allowing easy transferability. The Internet also lets patients 
review websites for physician referrals, which takes some of 
the fear out of trying someone new.10
Companies can also reduce buyer power with loyalty 
­programs, which reward customers based on their spending. 
The airline industry is famous for its frequent-flyer programs, 
for instance. Because of the rewards travelers receive (free air­
line tickets, upgrades, or hotel stays), they are more likely to 
be loyal to or give most of their business to a single company. 
Keeping track of the activities and accounts of many thousands 
or millions of customers covered by loyalty programs is not 
practical without large-scale business systems, however. Loy­
alty programs are thus a good example of using MIS to reduce 
buyer power.11

24  MODULE 1  |  Business Driven MIS
Supplier Power
A supply chain consists of all parties involved, directly or 
indirectly, in obtaining raw materials or a product. In a ­typical 
supply chain, a company will be both a supplier (to customers) 
and a customer (of other suppliers), as illustrated in ­Figure 1.16. 
Supplier power is the suppliers’ ability to influence the prices 
they charge for supplies (including materials, labor, and ser­
vices). Factors used to appraise supplier power include num­
ber of suppliers, size of suppliers, uniqueness of services, and 
availability of substitute products. If supplier power is high, the 
supplier can influence the industry by:
	∙	 Charging higher prices.
	∙	 Limiting quality or services.
	∙	 Shifting costs to industry participants.12
Typically, when a supplier raises prices, the buyers will 
pass on the increase to their customers by raising prices on 
the end product. When supplier power is high, buyers lose 
revenue because they cannot pass on the raw material price 
increase to their customers. Some powerful suppliers, such as 
pharmaceutical companies, can exert a threat over an entire 
industry when substitutes are limited and the product is 
critical to the buyers. Patients who need to purchase cancer-
fighting drugs have no power over price and must pay what­
ever the drug company asks because there are few available 
alternatives.
Using MIS to find alternative products is one way of decreas­
ing supplier power. Cancer patients can now use the Internet 
to research alternative medications and practices, something 
that was next to impossible just a few decades ago. Buy­
ers can also use MIS to form groups or collaborate with other 
buyers, increasing the size of the buyer group and reduc­
ing supplier power. For a hypothetical example, the collec­
tive group of 30,000 students from a university has far more 
power over price when purchasing laptops than a single 
student.13

when there are many alternatives to a product or service and

low when there are few alternatives from which to choose. For 
example, travelers have numerous substitutes for airline trans­
portation including automobiles, trains, and boats. Technology 
even makes videoconferencing and virtual meetings possible, 
eliminating the need for some business travel. Ideally, a com­
pany would like to be in a market in which there are few substi­
tutes for the products or services it offers.
Polaroid had this unique competitive advantage for many years 
until it forgot to observe competitive intelligence. Then the 
firm went bankrupt when people began taking digital pictures 
with everything from video cameras to cell phones.
A company can reduce the threat of substitutes by offering 
additional value through wider product distribution. Soft-
drink manufacturers distribute their products through vending 
machines, gas stations, and convenience stores, increasing the 
availability of soft drinks relative to other beverages. Compa­
nies can also offer various add-on services, making the sub­
stitute product less of a threat. For example, iPhones include 
capabilities for games, videos, and music, making a traditional 
cell phone less of a substitute.14
Threat of New Entrants
The threat of new entrants is high when it is easy for new 
competitors to enter a market and low when there are signif­
icant entry barriers to joining a market. An entry barrier is 
a feature of a product or service that customers have come to 
expect and entering competitors must offer the same for sur­
vival. For example, a new bank must offer its customers an 
array of MIS-enabled services, including ATMs, online bill 
paying, and online account monitoring. These are significant 
barriers to new firms entering the banking market. At one time, 
the first bank to offer such services gained a valuable first-
mover advantage, but only temporarily, as other banking com­
petitors developed their own MIS services.15
Rivalry among Existing Competitors
Rivalry among existing competitors is high when competi­
tion is fierce in a market and low when competitors are more com­
placent. Although competition is always more intense in some 
industries than in others, the overall trend is toward increased 
competition in almost every industry. The retail grocery industry 
is intensively competitive. Kroger, Safeway, and Albertsons in 
the United States compete in many different ways, essentially 
trying to beat or match each other on price. Most supermarket 
chains have implemented loyalty programs to provide custom­
ers special discounts while gathering valuable information about 
their purchasing habits. In the future, expect to see grocery stores 
using wireless technologies that track customer movements 
throughout the store to determine purchasing sequences.
Product differentiation occurs when a company develops 
unique differences in its products or services with the intent 
to influence demand. Companies can use differentiation to 
reduce rivalry. For example, while many companies sell books 
and videos on the Internet, Amazon differentiates itself by 
using customer profiling. When a customer visits Amazon.
com repeatedly, Amazon begins to offer products tailored to 
that particular customer based on his or her profile. In this way, 
Amazon has reduced its rivals’ power by offering its customers 
a differentiated service.
To review, the Five Forces Model helps managers set busi­
ness strategy by identifying the competitive structure and eco­
nomic environment of an industry. If the forces are strong, they 
increase competition; if the forces are weak, they decrease it 
(see Figure 1.17).16

is fierce in a market and low when 
competitors are more complacent.

strategies to help it remain com­
petitive. Assume a shipping com­
pany is deciding whether to enter 
the commercial airline industry. If 
performed correctly, an analysis 
of the five forces should determine 
that this is a highly risky business 
strategy because all five forces are 
strong. It will thus be difficult to 
generate a profit.
	∙	 Buyer power: Buyer power is high because customers have 
many airlines to choose from and typically make purchases 
based on price, not carrier.
	∙	 Supplier power: Supplier power is high since there are limited 
plane and engine manufacturers to choose from, and union­
ized workforces (suppliers of labor) restrict airline profits.
	∙	 Threat of substitute products or services: The threat of sub­
stitute products is high from many transportation alternatives 
including automobiles, trains, and boats, and from transporta­
tion substitutes such as videoconferencing and virtual meetings.
	∙	 Threat of new entrants: The threat of new entrants is high 
because new airlines are continuously entering the market, 
including sky taxies offering low-cost on-demand air taxi service.
	∙	 Rivalry among existing competitors: Rivalry in the airline 
industry is high, and websites such as Travelocity and Price­
line force them to compete on price (see Figure 1.18).17
THE THREE GENERIC 
STRATEGIES—
CHOOSING A 
BUSINESS 
FOCUS  LO1.6
Once top management has determined the relative attractive­
ness of an industry and decided to enter it, the firm must for­
mulate a strategy for doing so. If our sample company decided 
to join the airline industry, it could compete as a low-cost, 
­no-frills airline or as a luxury airline providing outstand­
ing ­service and first-class comfort. Both options offer differ­
ent ways of achieving competitive advantages in a crowded 
­marketplace.  The low-cost operator saves on expenses and 
passes the savings along to customers in the form of low prices. 
The luxury airline spends on high-end service and first-class 
comforts and passes the costs on to the customer in the form of 
high prices.
Porter’s three generic strategies are generic business strate­
gies that are neither organization nor industry specific and can be 
applied to any business, product, or service. These three generic 
business strategies for entering a new market are: (1) broad cost 
Strong (High) Force: Increases
Competition or Lots of Competitors
Buyer Power
Many airlines for buyers to choose from forcing competition 
based on price.
Supplier Power
Limited number of plane and engine manufacturers to choose 
from along with unionized workers.
Threat of Substitute Products 
or Services
Many substitutes including cars, trains, and buses. Even 
substitutes to travel such as video conferencing and virtual 
meetings.
Threat of New Entrants
Many new airlines entering the market all the time including 
the latest sky taxis.
Rivalry among Existing Competitors
Intense competition—many rivals.

leadership, (2) broad differentiation, and (3) focused strategy. 
Broad strategies reach a large market segment, while focused 
strategies target a niche or unique market with either cost lead­
ership or differentiation. Trying to be all things to all people is 
a recipe for disaster, since doing so makes it ­difficult to proj­
ect a consistent image to the entire ­marketplace. For this 
reason, Porter suggests adopting only one of the three 
generic strategies illustrated in Figure 1.19.
Figure 1.20  applies the three strategies to real 
companies, demonstrating the relationships 
among strategies (cost leadership versus differ­
entiation) and market segmentation (broad versus 
focused).
	∙	 Broad market and low cost: Walmart com­
petes by offering a broad range of products 
at low prices. Its business strategy is to be 
the low-cost provider of goods for the cost-­conscious 
consumer.
	∙	 Broad market and high cost: Neiman Marcus competes 
by offering a broad range of differentiated products at high 
prices. Its business strategy offers a variety of specialty and 
upscale products to affluent consumers.
	∙	 Narrow market and low cost: Payless competes by offering a 
specific product, shoes, at low prices. Its business strategy is 
to be the low-cost provider of shoes. Payless competes with 
Walmart, which also sells low-cost shoes, by offering a far big­
ger selection of sizes and styles.

VALUE CHAIN 
ANALYSIS—
EXECUTING BUSINESS 
STRATEGIES  LO1.7
Firms make profits by taking raw inputs and applying a busi­
ness process to turn them into a product or service that custom­
ers find valuable. A business process is a standardized set of 
activities that accomplish a specific task, such as processing a 
customer’s order. Once a firm identifies the industry it wants 
to enter and the generic strategy it will focus on, it must then 
choose the business processes required to create its products or 
services. Of course, the firm will want to ensure the processes 
add value and create competitive advantages. To identify these 
competitive advantages, Michael Porter created value chain 
analysis, which views a firm as a series of business processes 
that each add value to the product or service.
Value chain analysis is a useful tool for determining how to cre­
ate the greatest possible value for customers (see Figure 1.21). 
The goal of value chain analysis is to identify processes in 
which the firm can add value for the customer and create a 
competitive advantage for itself, with a cost advantage or prod­
uct differentiation.
The value chain groups a firm’s activities into two categories, 
primary value activities, and support value activities. Primary 
value activities, shown at the bottom of the value chain in

computer costing roughly $100. What types of competitive 
advantages could children gain from Negroponte’s $100 
laptop? What types of issues could result from the $100 
laptop? Which of ­Porter’s three generic strategies is Negro­

pider-Man’s infamous advice—“With great  power comes great

encounter in business. Technology provides countless opportuni­
ties for businesses, but it can also lead to countless pitfalls and traps. 
A great example is how many companies profited from online trading 
and how many people lost their life savings in online trading scams. For 
example, Bernard Madoff, the owner of a high-profile New York invest­
ment company, was able to forge investment statements and allegedly

	4.	 Marketing and sales: promotes, prices,

Support value activities, along the top of 
the value chain in Figure 1.21, include firm 
infrastructure, human resource ­management, 
technology development, and procurement. 
Not surprisingly, these support the primary 
value activities.
	∙	 Firm infrastructure: includes the company 
format or departmental structures, environ­
ment, and systems.
	∙	 Human resource management: provides 
employee training, hiring, and compensation.
	∙	 Technology development: applies MIS to 
processes to add value.
	∙	 Procurement: purchases inputs such as 
raw materials, resources, equipment, and 
supplies.
It is easy to understand how a typical manu­
facturing firm takes raw materials such as 
wood pulp and transforms it into paper. 
Adding value in this example might include 
using high-quality raw materials or offering 
next-day free shipping on any order. How, 
though, might a typical service firm take raw 
inputs such as time, knowledge, and MIS and 
transform them into valuable customer ser­
vice knowledge? A hotel might use MIS to 
track customer reservations and then inform 
front-desk employees when a loyal customer 
is checking in so the employee can call the 
guest by name and offer additional services, 
gift baskets, or upgraded rooms. Examining 
the firm as a value chain allows managers to 
identify the important business processes that 
add  value for customers and then find MIS 
solutions that ­support them.
When performing a value chain analysis, a

percentages in ­Figure 1.22, to describe how each activity adds 
(or reduces) value. Then the competitive advantage decision 
for the firm is whether to (1) target high value-adding activi­
ties to further enhance their value, (2) target low value-adding 
activities to increase their value, or (3) perform some combina­
tion of the two.
MIS adds value to both primary and support value activities. One 
example of a primary value activity facilitated by MIS is the devel­
opment of a marketing campaign management system that could 
target marketing campaigns more efficiently, thereby reducing 
marketing costs. The system would also help the firm better pin­
point target market needs, thereby increasing sales. One example 
of a support value activity facilitated by MIS is the development 
of a human resources system that could more efficiently reward 
employees based on performance. The system could also identify 
employees who are at risk of quitting, allowing managers’ time to 
find additional challenges or opportunities that would help retain 
these employees and thus reduce turnover costs.
Value chain analysis is a highly useful tool that provides hard 
and fast numbers for evaluating the activities that add value to 
products and services. Managers can find additional value by 
analyzing and constructing the value chain in terms of Porter’s 
Five Forces Model (see Figure 1.22). For example, if the goal 
is to decrease buyer power, a company can construct its value 
chain activity of “service after the sale” by offering high lev­
els of customer service. This will increase customers’ switch­
ing costs and reduce their power. Analyzing and constructing 
support value activities can help decrease the threat of new 
entrants. Analyzing and constructing primary value activities 
can help decrease the threat of substitute products or services.21
Revising Porter’s three business strategies is critical. Firms 
must continually adapt to their competitive environments, 
which can cause business strategy to shift. In the remainder of 
this text we discuss how managers can formulate business strat­
egies using MIS to create competitive advantages. Figure 1.23 
gives an overview of the remaining chapters, along with the 
relevant business strategy and associated MIS topics.  ■

orking faster and smarter 
has become a necessity for 
companies. A firm’s value 
chain is directly affected by how well it 
designs and coordinates its business 
processes. Business processes offer 
competitive advantages if they enable a 
firm to lower operating costs, differenti­
ate, or compete in a niche market. They 
can also be huge burdens if they are 
outdated, which impedes operations, 
efficiency, and effectiveness. Thus, the 
ability of management information sys­
tems to improve business processes is a 
key advantage.

MAKING BUSINESS 
DECISIONS  LO2.1
Porter’s strategies outlined in Chapter 1 suggest entering 
markets with a competitive advantage in either overall cost 
leadership, differentiation, or focus. To achieve these results, 
managers must be able to make decisions and forecast future 
business needs and requirements. The most important and most 
challenging question confronting managers today is how to lay 
the foundation for tomorrow’s success while competing to win 
in today’s business environment. A company will not have a 
future if it is not cultivating strategies for tomorrow. The goal 
of this section is to expand on Porter’s Five Forces Model, three 
generic strategies, and value chain analysis to demonstrate how 
managers can learn the concepts and practices of business deci­
sion making to add value. It will also highlight how companies 
today are taking advantage of advanced MIS capable of gener­
ating significant competitive advantages across the value chain.
As we discussed in Chapter 1, decision making is one of the 
most important and challenging aspects of management. Deci­
sions range from routine choices, such as how many items to 
order or how many people to hire, to unexpected ones such as 
what to do if a key employee suddenly quits or needed materi­
als do not arrive. Today, with massive volumes of information 
available, managers are challenged to make highly complex 
decisions—some involving far more information than the 
human brain can comprehend—in increasingly shorter time 
frames. Figure 2.1 displays the three primary challenges man­
agers face when making decisions.

at each of the three primary organization levels along with the

FIGURE 2. 1    Managerial Decision-Making Challenges
1. Managers need to analyze large amounts of information:  
Innovations in communication and globalization have resulted in a
dramatic increase in the variables and dimensions people need to consider
when making a decision, solving a problem, or appraising an opportunity.
2. Managers must make decisions quickly:
Time is of the essence and people simply do not have time to sift through
all the information manually.
3. Managers must apply sophisticated analysis techniques, such as 
Porter’s strategies or forecasting, to make strategic decisions:
Due to the intensely competitive global business environment, companies
must oﬀer far more than just a great product to succeed.

Problem Identiﬁcation: Deﬁne the problem as clearly and precisely

Data Collection: Gather problem-related data, including who, what,
where, when, why, and how.  Be sure to gather facts, not rumors or
opinions about the problem. 
Solution Generation: Detail every solution possible, including ideas
that seem farfetched.
Solution Test: Evaluate solutions in terms of feasibility (can it be
completed?), suitability (is it a permanent or a temporary ﬁx?), and
acceptability (can all participants form a consensus?).
Solution Selection: Select the solution that best solves the problem
and meets the needs of the business.
Solution Implementation: If the solution solves the problem, then
the decisions made were correct.  If not, then the decisions were
incorrect and the process begins again.

Decision-Making Process
Decision-Making 
Essentials
A few key concepts about organizational 
structure will help our discussion of MIS 
decision-making tools. The structure 
of a typical organization is similar to a 
pyramid, and the different levels require 
different types of information to assist in 
decision making, problem solving, and 
opportunity capturing (see Figure 2.3).
Operational  At the operational 
level, employees develop, control, 
and maintain core business activities 
required to run the day-to-day operations. 
Operational decisions are considered 
structured decisions, which arise in 
situations where established processes 
offer potential solutions. Structured 
decisions are made frequently and are almost repetitive in 
nature; they affect short-term business strategies. Reordering 
inventory and creating the employee staffing and weekly pro­
duction schedules are examples of routine structured decisions. 
Figure 2.4 highlights the essential elements required for opera­
tional decision making. All the elements in the figure should be 
familiar, except metrics, which are discussed in detail below.

The Decision-Making Process
The process of making decisions plays a crucial role in com­
munication and leadership for operational, managerial, and 
strategic projects. Analytics is the science of fact-based deci­
sion making. There are numerous academic decision-making 
models; Figure 2.2 presents just one example.1

36  MODULE 1  |  Business Driven MIS
Managerial  At the managerial level, employees are con­
tinuously evaluating company operations to hone the firm’s abil­
ities to identify, adapt to, and leverage change. A company that 
has a competitive advantage needs to constantly adjust and revise 
its strategy to remain ahead of fast-following competitors. Man­
agerial decisions cover short- and medium-range plans, sched­
ules, and budgets along with policies, ­procedures, and business 
objectives for the firm. They also allocate resources and monitor 
the performance of organizational subunits, including depart­
ments, divisions, process teams, project teams, and other work 
groups. These types of decisions are considered semistructured 
­decisions; they occur in situations in which a few established 
processes help to evaluate potential solutions, but not enough to 
lead to a definite recommended decision. For example, decisions 
about producing new products or changing employee benefits 
range from unstructured to semistructured. Figure 2.4 highlights 
the essential elements required for managerial decision making.

Strategic  At the strategic level, managers develop over­
all business strategies, goals, and objectives as part of the 
company’s strategic plan. They also monitor the strategic per­
formance of the organization and its overall direction in the 
political, economic, and competitive business environment. 
Strategic decisions are highly unstructured decisions, occur­
ring in situations in which no procedures or rules exist to guide 
decision makers toward the correct choice. They are infrequent, 
extremely important, and typically related to long-term busi­
ness strategy. Examples include the decision to enter a new 
market or even a new industry over, say, the next three years. 
In these types of decisions, managers rely on many sources of 
information, along with personal knowledge, to find solutions. 
Figure 2.4 highlights the essential elements required for strate­
gic decision making.

CHAPTER 2  |  Decisions and Processes: Value Driven Business  37
It is important to understand the relationship between critical 
success factors and key performance indicators. CSFs are ele­
ments crucial for a business strategy’s success. KPIs measure 
the progress of CSFs with quantifiable measurements, and one 
CSF can have several KPIs. Of course, both categories will vary 
by company and industry. Imagine improve graduation rates as 
a CSF for a college. The KPIs to measure this CSF can include:
	∙	 Average grades by course and gender.
	∙	 Student dropout rates by gender and major.
	∙	 Average graduation rate by gender and major.
	∙	 Time spent in tutoring by gender and major.
KPIs can focus on external and internal measurements. A com­
mon external KPI is market share, or the proportion of the 
market that a firm captures. We calculate it by dividing the 
firm’s sales by the total market sales for the entire industry. 
Market share measures a firm’s external performance relative 
to that of its competitors. For example, if a firm’s total sales 
(revenues) are $2 million and sales for the entire industry are 
$10 million, the firm has captured 20 percent of the total mar­
ket (2/10 = 20%) or a 20 percent market share.
MEASURING BUSINESS 
DECISIONS  LO2.2
A project is a temporary activity a company undertakes 
to create a unique product, service, or result. For example, 
the ­construction of a new subway station is a project, as is a 
movie theater chain’s adoption of a software program to allow 
online ticketing. Peter Drucker, a famous management writer, 
once said that if you cannot measure something, you can­
not manage it. How do managers measure the progress of a 
­complex business project?
Metrics are measurements that evaluate results to determine 
whether a project is meeting its goals. Two core metrics are 
critical success factors and key performance indicators. ­Critical 
­success factors (CSFs) are the crucial steps companies 
­perform to achieve their goals and objectives and implement 
their strategies (see Figure 2.5). Key performance indicators 
(KPIs) are the quantifiable metrics a company uses to evalu­
ate progress toward critical success factors. KPIs are far more 
specific than CSFs.

could managers track departmental costs and profits associated 
with company email? Measuring by volume does not account 
for profitability, because one sales email could land a million-
dollar deal while 300 others might not generate any revenue. 
Non-revenue-generating departments such as human resources 
and legal require email but will not be using it to generate 
­profits. For this reason, many managers turn to higher-level 
metrics, such as efficiency and effectiveness, to measure MIS 
projects. Best practices are the most successful solutions or 
problem-solving methods that have been developed by a spe­
cific organization or industry. Measuring MIS projects helps 
determine the best practices for an industry.
LO2.2  Define critical success factors (CSFs) and key performance 
indicators (KPIs), and explain how managers use them to measure 
the success of MIS projects.
A common internal KPI is return 
on investment (ROI), which indi­
cates the earning power of a project. 
We measure it by dividing the profit­
ability of a project by the costs. This 
sounds easy, and for many depart­
ments where the projects are tangi­
ble and self-contained it is; however, 
for projects that are intangible and 
cross departmental lines (such as 
MIS projects), ROI is challenging to 
measure. Imagine attempting to cal­
culate the ROI of a fire extinguisher. If the fire extinguisher is never 
used, its ROI is low. If the fire extinguisher puts out a fire that could 
have destroyed the entire building, its ROI is astronomically high.
Creating KPIs to measure the success of an MIS project offers 
similar challenges. Think about a firm’s email system. How

Is It Effective Or Is It Efficient?
Making business decisions is a key skill for all managers. Review 
the following list and, in a group, determine whether the question is 
focusing on efficiency, effectiveness, or both.
Business Decision
Efficiency
Effectiveness
What is the best route for 
dropping off products?
Should we change suppliers?
Should we reduce costs by 
buying lower-quality materials?
Should we sell products to a 
younger market?
Did we make our sales targets?
What was the turnover rate of 
employees?
What is the average customer 
spending?
How many new customers 
purchased products?
Did the amount of daily 
transactions increase?
Is there a better way to 
restructure a store to increase 
sales?
Efficiency and Effectiveness Metrics
Efficiency MIS metrics measure the performance of MIS itself, 
such as throughput, transaction speed, and system availability. 
Effectiveness MIS metrics measure the impact MIS has on 
business processes and activities, including customer satisfac­
tion and customer conversion rates. Efficiency focuses on the 
extent to which a firm is using its resources in an optimal way, 
while effectiveness focuses on how well a firm is achieving its 
goals and objectives. Peter Drucker offers a helpful distinc­
tion between efficiency and effectiveness: Doing things right 
addresses efficiency—getting the most from each resource. 
Doing the right things addresses effectiveness—setting the 
right goals and objectives and ensuring they are accomplished. 
Figure 2.6 describes a few of the common types of efficiency 
and effectiveness MIS metrics. KPIs that measure MIS projects 
include both efficiency and effectiveness metrics. Of course, 
these metrics are not as concrete as market share or ROI, but 
they do offer valuable insight into project performance.2
Large increases in productivity typically result from increases 
in effectiveness, which focus on CSFs. Efficiency MIS met­
rics are far easier to measure, however, so most managers tend 
to focus on them, often incorrectly, to measure the success of 
MIS projects. Consider measuring the success of automated 
teller machines (ATMs). Thinking in terms of MIS efficiency 
metrics, a manager would measure the number of daily trans­
actions, the average amount per transaction, and the average 
speed per transaction to determine the success of the ATM. 
Although these offer solid metrics on how well the system is 
performing, they miss many of the intangible or value-added 
benefits associated with ATM effectiveness. Effectiveness 
MIS metrics might measure how many new customers joined 
the bank due to its ATM locations or the ATMs’ ease of use. 
They can also measure increases in customer satisfaction due to 
reduced ATM fees or additional ATM services such as the sale 
of stamps and movie tickets, significant time savers and value 
added features for customers. Being a great manager means 
taking the added viewpoint offered by effectiveness MIS met­
rics to analyze all benefits associated with an MIS project.
The Interrelationship Between 
Efficiency and Effectiveness 
MIS Metrics
Efficiency and effectiveness are definitely related. 
However, success in one area does not necessar­
ily imply success in the other. Efficiency MIS 
metrics focus on the technology itself. While 
these efficiency MIS metrics are important to 
monitor, they do not always guarantee effective­
ness. Effectiveness MIS metrics are determined 
according to an organization’s goals, strategies, 
and objectives. Here, it becomes important to con­
sider a company’s CSFs, such as a broad cost 
leadership strategy (Walmart, for example), as 
well as KPIs such as increasing 
new customers by 10 percent or 
reducing new-product develop­
ment cycle times to six months. In 
the private sector, eBay continu­
ously benchmarks its MIS projects 
for efficiency and effectiveness. 
Maintaining constant website av­­
ailability and optimal throughput 
performance are CSFs for eBay.
Figure 2.7  depicts the interrela­
tionships between efficiency and 
effectiveness. Ideally, a firm wants 
to operate in the upper right-hand 
corner of the graph, realizing significant increases in both effi­
ciency and effectiveness. However, operating in the upper left-
hand corner (minimal effectiveness with increased efficiency) 
or the lower right-hand corner (significant effectiveness with 
minimal efficiency) may be in line with an organization’s par­
ticular strategies. In general, operating in the lower left-hand 
efficiency MIS

system performance. Benchmarks help as­­
sess how an MIS project performs over time. 
For instance, if a system held a benchmark 
for response time of 15 seconds, the manager 
would want to ensure response time contin­
ued to decrease until it reached that point. If 
response time suddenly increased to 1 minute, 
the manager would know the system was not 
functioning correctly and could start look­
ing into potential problems. Continuously 
measuring MIS projects against benchmarks 
­provides feedback so managers can control 
the system.
USING MIS TO 
MAKE BUSINESS 
DECISIONS  LO2.3
Now that we’ve reviewed the essentials of decision making, we 
are ready to understand the powerful benefits associated with 
using MIS to support managers making decisions.
A model is a simplified representation or abstraction of reality. 
Models help managers calculate risks, understand uncertainty, 
change variables, and manipulate time to make decisions. MIS 
support systems rely on models for computational and analytical 
routines that mathematically express relationships among vari­
ables. For example, a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft 
Office Excel, might contain models that calculate market share 
or ROI. MIS have the capability and functionality to express far 
more complex modeling relationships that provide information, 
business intelligence, and knowledge. Figure 2.8 highlights the 
three primary types of management information systems avail­
able to support decision making across the company levels.

managerial support systems, and strategic support systems, and

corner (minimal efficiency and minimal effectiveness) is not 
ideal for the operation of any organization.
Benchmarks  Regardless of what process is measured, 
how it is measured, and whether it is performed for the sake of 
efficiency or effectiveness, managers must set benchmarks, 
or baseline values the system seeks to attain. Benchmarking 
is a process of continuously measuring system results, com­
paring those results to optimal system performance (bench­
mark values), and identifying steps and procedures to improve

Fortune magazine asked Anne Mulcahy, former Chairman and CEO of

said it occurred at a breakfast meeting in Dallas, to which she had invited 
a group of business leaders. One of them, a plainspoken, self-made, 
streetwise guy, came up to Mulcahy and said:
When everything gets really complicated and you feel over­
whelmed, think about it this way. You gotta do three things. First, get 
the cow out of the ditch. Second, find out how the cow got into the ditch. 
Third, make sure you do whatever it takes so the cow doesn’t go into 
the ditch again.3

(2) store the information, and (3) 
update existing information to 
reflect the new information. Dur­
ing OLTP, the organization must 
capture every detail of transac­
tions and events. A transaction 
processing system (TPS) is the 
basic business system that serves 
the operational level (analysts) and 
assists in making structured deci­
sions. The most common example 
of a TPS is an operational account­
ing system such as a payroll sys­
tem or an order entry system.
Using systems thinking, we can 
see that the inputs for a TPS are 
source documents, which descri­
bes the original transaction record 
along with details such as its date, 
purpose, and amount spent and 
includes cash receipts, canceled 
checks, invoices, customer refunds, 
employee time sheet, etc. Source 
documents for a payroll system 
can include time sheets, wage 
rates, and employee benefit reports. 
Transformation in­cludes common 
procedures such as creating, read­
ing, updating, and deleting (commonly referred to as CRUD) 
employee records, along with calculating the payroll and sum­
marizing benefits. The output includes cutting the paychecks and 
generating ­payroll reports. Figure 2.9 demonstrates the systems 
thinking view of a TPS.4
Managerial Support Systems
Analytical information encompasses all organizational infor­
mation, and its primary purpose is to support the performance 
of managerial analysis or semistructured decisions. Analytical 
information includes transactional information along with other 
information such as market and industry information. Exam­
ples of analytical information are trends, sales, product statis­
tics, and future growth projections. Managers use analytical 
Operational Support Systems
Transactional information encompasses all the information 
contained within a single business process or unit of work, and 
its primary purpose is to support the performance of daily opera­
tional or structured decisions. Transactional information is cre­
ated, for example, when customers are purchasing stocks, making 
an airline reservation, or withdrawing cash from an ATM. Man­
agers use transactional information when making structured 
decisions at the operational level, such as when analyzing daily 
sales reports to determine how much inventory to carry.
Online transaction processing (OLTP) is the capture of 
transaction and event information using technology to (1) 
process the information according to defined business rules,

DSS. The DSS then summarizes and aggregates the informa­
tion from the different TPSs, which assist managers in making 
semistructured decisions.
Strategic Support Systems
Decision making at the strategic level requires both business 
intelligence and knowledge to support the uncertainty and 
complexity associated with business strategies. An executive 
information system (EIS) is a specialized DSS that supports 
senior-level executives and unstructured, long-term, nonroutine 
decisions requiring judgment, evaluation, and insight. These 
decisions do not have a right or wrong answer, only efficient 
and effective answers. Moving up through the organizational 
pyramid, managers deal less with the details (“finer” informa­
tion) and more with meaningful aggregations of information 
(“coarser” information). Granularity refers to the level of 
detail in the model or the decision-making process. The greater 
the granularity, the deeper the level of detail or fineness of data 
(see Figure 2.13).
A DSS differs from an EIS in that an EIS requires data from 
external sources to support unstructured decisions (see 
­Figure 2.14). This is not to say that DSSs never use data from 
external sources, but typically DSS semistructured decisions 
rely on internal data only.
information when making important semistructured decisions, 
such as whether the organization should build a new manufac­
turing plant or hire additional sales reps.
Online analytical processing (OLAP) is the manipulation of 
information to create business intelligence in support of strategic 
decision making. Decision support systems (DSSs) model 
information using OLAP, which provides assistance in evaluat­
ing and choosing among different courses of action. DSSs enable 
high-level managers to examine and manipulate large amounts of 
detailed data from different internal and external sources. Ana­
lyzing complex relationships among thousands or even millions 
of data items to discover patterns, trends, and exception condi­
tions is one of the key uses associated with a DSS. For example, 
doctors may enter symptoms into a decision support system so 
it can help diagnose and treat patients. Insurance companies also 
use a DSS to gauge the risk of providing insurance to drivers 
who have imperfect driving records. One company found that 
married women who are homeowners with one speeding ticket 
are rarely cited for speeding again. Armed with this business 
intelligence, the company achieved a cost advantage by lower­
ing insurance rates to this specific group of customers. Figure 
2.10 displays the common DSS analysis techniques.

included in a dashboard designed for a manufacturing 
team:

15 minutes.
∙  A running line graph of planned versus actual production 
for the past 24 hours.
∙  A table showing actual versus forecasted product prices 
and inventories.
∙  A list of outstanding alerts and their resolution status.
∙  A graph of stock market prices.
Digital dashboards, whether basic or comprehensive, 
deliver results quickly. As they become easier to use, 
more employees can perform their own analyses with­
out inundating MIS staff with questions and requests 
for reports. Digital dashboards enable employees 
to move beyond reporting to using information to 
directly increase business performance. With them, 
employees can react to information as soon as it 
becomes available and make decisions, solve prob­
lems, and change strategies daily instead of monthly. 
Digital dashboards offer the analytical capabilities 
illustrated in Figure 2.15.
One thing to remember when making decisions is the 
old saying, “Garbage in, garbage out.” If the transac­
tional data used in the support system are wrong, then 
the managerial analysis will be wrong and the DSS 
will simply assist in making a wrong decision faster. 
Managers should also ask, “What is the DSS not tell­
ing me before I make my final decision?”
USING AI TO 
MAKE BUSINESS 
DECISIONS  LO2.4
Executive information systems are starting to take 
advantage of artificial intelligence to facilitate 
unstructured strategic decision making. Artificial intelligence 
(AI) simulates human thinking and behavior, such as the ability 
to reason and learn. Its ultimate goal is to build a system that 
can mimic human intelligence.
Intelligent systems are various commercial applications 
of artificial intelligence. They include sensors, software, and 
devices that emulate and enhance human capabilities, learn 
Visualization produces graphical displays of patterns and 
complex relationships in large amounts of data. Executive 
information systems use visualization to deliver specific key 
information to top managers at a glance, with little or no inter­
action with the system. A common tool that supports visual­
ization is a digital dashboard, which tracks KPIs and CSFs 
by compiling information from multiple sources and tailoring 
it to meet user needs. Following is a list of potential features 
FIGURE 2 . 1 0   Common DSS Analysis Techniques
WHAT-IF
ANALYSIS
What -if analysis checks the impact of a change in a 
variable or assumption on the model. For example, 
“What will happen to the supply chain if a hurricane in 
South Carolina reduces holding inventory from 30 
percent to 10 percent?” A user would be able to observe 
and evaluate any changes that occurred to the values in 
the model, especially to a variable such as proﬁts. Users 
repeat this analysis with diﬀerent variables until they 
understand all the eﬀects of various situations.
SENSITIVITY
ANALYSIS
Sensitivity analysis, a special case of what-if analysis, is  
the study of the impact on other variables when one 
variable is changed repeatedly. Sensitivity analysis is 
useful when users are uncertain about the assumptions 
made in estimating the value of certain key variables. For 
example, repeatedly changing revenue in small 
increments to determine its eﬀects on other variables 
would help a manager understand the impact of various 
revenue levels on other decision factors.
GOAL
SEEKING
ANALYSIS
GOAL
SEEKING
ANALYSIS
Goal-seeking analysis ﬁnds the inputs necessary to 
achieve a goal such as a desired level of output. It is the 
reverse of what-if and sensitivity analysis. Instead of 
observing how changes in a variable aﬀect other 
variables, goal-seeking analysis sets a target value
(a goal) for a variable and then repeatedly changes other
variables until the target value is achieved. For example,
goal-seeking analysis could determine how many
customers must purchase a new product to increase
gross proﬁts to $5 million.
OPTIMIZATION
ANALYSIS
OPTIMIZATION
ANALYSIS
Optimization analysis, an extension of goal-seeking 
analysis, ﬁnds the optimum value for a target variable by 
repeatedly changing other variables, subject to speciﬁed 
constraints. By changing revenue and cost variables in an 
optimization analysis, managers can calculate the highest 
potential proﬁts. Constraints on revenue and cost 
variables can be taken into consideration, such as limits 
on the amount of raw materials the company can aﬀord 
to purchase and limits on employees available to meet 
production needs.

at a French bank allegedly used  his inside 
knowledge of business pro­
cesses to bypass the systems and 
make roughly $73 billion in bogus 
trades that cost the bank more 
than $7 billion to unwind.
Findings from the U.S. Secret 
Service and its examination of 23 
incidents conducted by 26 insid­

Seventyeight percent of the time, 
insiders were authorized and

This is a daunting reminder that every 
employee has the potential to become a 
knowledgeable insider, and if they ever turned 
bad in a fraudulent, criminal, even destructive 
way, they could do tremendous damage to your

The finance industry is a veteran in the use of neural network 
technology and has been relying on various forms for over two 
decades. It uses neural networks to review loan applications 
and create patterns or profiles of applications that fall into two 
categories—approved or denied. Here are some examples of 
neural networks in finance:
	∙	 Citibank uses neural networks to find opportunities in financial 
markets. By carefully examining historical stock market data with 
neural network software, Citibank financial managers learn of 
base containing various accumu­
lated experience and a set of rules 
for applying the knowledge base 
to each particular situation. Expert 
systems are the most common 
form of AI in the business arena 
because they fill the gap when 
human experts are difficult to find 
or retain or are too expensive. The best-known systems play 
chess and assist in medical diagnosis.
Neural Networks
A neural network, also called an artificial neural network, is 
a category of AI that attempts to emulate the way the human 
brain works. Neural networks analyze large quantities of infor­
mation to establish patterns and characteristics in situations 
where the logic or rules are unknown. Neural networks’ many 
features include:

FIGURE 2 . 1 5  Digital Dashboard Analytical Capabilities
CONSOLIDATION
Consolidation is the aggregation of data from simple 
roll-ups to complex groupings of interrelated
information. For example, data for diﬀerent sales
representatives can then be rolled up to an oﬃce level,
then a state level, then a regional sales level.
DRILL-DOWN 
Drill-down enables users to view details, and details of
details, of information. This is the reverse of
consolidation; a user can view regional sales data and
then drill down all the way to each sales
representative’s data at each oﬃce. Drill-down
capability lets managers view monthly, weekly, daily, or
even hourly information.
Slice-and-Dice
Slice-and-dice is the ability to look at information
from diﬀerent perspectives. One slice of information
could display all product sales during a given
promotion. Another slice could display a single
product’s sales for all promotions. Slicing and dicing is
often performed along a time axis to analyze trends
and ﬁnd time-based patterns in the information.
Pivot
Pivot (also known as rotation) rotates data to display
alternative presentations of the data. For example, a
Pivot can swap the rows and columns of a report to
show the data in a diﬀerent format.
Got Junk? Get a 
Hunk!6
Do you enjoy kidnapping your rival’s 
team mascot or toilet-papering their frat 
houses? If so, you might find your ideal 
career at College Hunks Hauling Junk. 
The company launched in 2005 and hires 
college students and recent college grads 
to pick up junk. The founder, Nick Fried­
man, had a goal of capturing that friendly 
rivalry so often associated with college 
life and turn it into profits. When the 
company first launched, the haulers from 
Virginia found that their truck had been 
lathered in shaving cream and draped 
with a University of Maryland flag. The 
Virginia haulers retaliated and, soon after, 
dead fish were found coating the seats of 
the Maryland’s truck. Friedman decided 
to use this energy as incentive instead 
of reprimanding the rather unorthodox 
behavior. “We wanted to harness that 
competitive, prankster enthusiasm and 
channel it for good,” states Friedman.
Friedman made a bold move and decided that 
instead of tracking typical key performance met­
rics such as revenue, average job size, customer 
loyalty, etc., he would track volume of junk col­
lected and amount of junk donated or recycled. 
The winning team gains such things as bragging 
rights and banners, modest monetary prizes, and 
“first table to eat” at the annual company meet­
ing. Most employees check the dashboard daily 
to view their own and rivals’ latest standings.
Why do you think competition is helping 
­College Hunks Hauling Junk exceed its revenue 
goals? If you were to build a 
team competition dashboard 
for your school or your work, 
what types of metrics would it 
track? What types of motiva­
tors would you use to ensure 
your team is always in the

information would you want 
tracked in your dashboard? 
Could an unethical person

example, it could be that 
whenever IBM stock goes 
up, so does Unisys stock, 
or that a U.S. Treasury 
note is selling for 1 cent less in Japan than in the United 
States. These snippets of information can make a big 
difference to Citibank’s bottom line in a very ­competitive 
financial market.9
	∙	 Visa, MasterCard, and many other credit card compa­
nies use a neural network to spot peculiarities in indi­
vidual accounts and follow up by checking for fraud. 
MasterCard estimates neural networks save it $50 
million annually.

funds and other carriers use neural network software 
to identify fraud. The system searches for patterns 
in billing charges, laboratory tests, and frequency of

sprained ankle but treatment included an electrocar­
diogram would be flagged for the account manager.

Genetic Algorithms
A genetic algorithm is an artificial intelligence system that 
mimics the evolutionary, survival-of-the-fittest process to 
generate increasingly better solutions to a problem. A genetic 
algorithm is essentially an optimizing system: It finds the com­
bination of inputs that gives the best outputs. Mutation is the 
process within a genetic algorithm of randomly trying combi­
nations and evaluating the success (or failure) of the outcome.
Genetic algorithms are best suited to decision-making environ­
ments in which thousands, or perhaps millions, of solutions are 
possible. Genetic algorithms can find and evaluate solutions 
with many more possibilities, faster and more thoroughly than 
while 1 represents inclusion or 
membership. For example, fuzzy 
logic is used in washing machines 
that determine by themselves how 
much water to use or how long to 
wash (they continue washing until 
the water is clean). In accounting 
and finance, fuzzy logic allows 
people to analyze information with 
subjective financial values (intan­
gibles such as goodwill) that are 
very important considerations in 
economic analysis. Fuzzy logic 
and neural networks are often 
combined to express complicated 
and subjective concepts in a form

and sleep patterns. You can track your driving 
patterns, tooth-brushing habits, and even laun­
dry status. The question now becomes how to 
track all of your trackers.

would measure each area. 
For example, if you track eat­
ing habits, you might want to

among the areas in your life.

In the past few years, AI research has made much progress in 
modeling complex organizations as a whole with the help of 
multiagent systems. In a multiagent system, groups of intelligent 
agents have the ability to work independently and to interact with 
each other. Agent-based modeling is a way of simulating human 
organizations using multiple intelligent agents, each of which fol­
lows a set of simple rules and can adapt to changing conditions.
Agent-based modeling systems are being used to model stock 
market fluctuations, predict the escape routes people seek in a 
burning building, estimate the effects of interest rates on con­
sumers with different types of debt, and anticipate how changes 
in conditions will affect the supply chain, to name just a few.
Virtual Reality
Virtual reality is a computer-simulated environment that can 
be a simulation of the real world or an imaginary world. Virtual 
reality is a fast-growing area of artificial intelligence that had 
its origins in efforts to build more natural, realistic, multisen­
sory human-computer interfaces. Virtual reality enables tele­
presence where users can be anywhere in the world and use 
virtual reality systems to work alone or together at a remote 
site. Typically, this involves using a virtual reality system to 
enhance the sight and touch of a human who is remotely manip­
ulating equipment to accomplish a task. Examples range from 
virtual surgery, where surgeon and patient may be on opposite 
sides of the globe, to the remote use of equipment in hazard­
ous environments such as chemical plants and nuclear reactors. 
Augmented reality is the viewing of the physical world with 
computer-generated layers of information added to it.
a human. Organizations face decision-making environments 
for all types of problems that require optimization techniques, 
such as the following:
	∙	 Business executives use genetic algorithms to help them 
decide which combination of projects a firm should invest in, 
taking ­complicated tax considerations into account.
	∙	 Investment companies use genetic algorithms 
to help in trading decisions.
	∙	 Telecommunication companies use genetic 
al­gorithms to determine the optimal configura­
tion of fiber-optic cable in a network that may 
include as many as 100,000 connection points. 
The genetic algorithm evaluates millions of 
cable ­configurations and selects the one that 
uses the least amount of cable.
Intelligent Agents
An intelligent agent is a special-purpose knowledge-based 
information system that accomplishes specific tasks on behalf of 
its users. Intelligent agents usually have a graphical representa­
tion, such as “Sherlock Holmes” for an information search agent.
One of the simplest examples of an intelligent agent is a shopping 
bot. A shopping bot is software that will search several retailer 
websites and provide a comparison of each retailer’s offerings 
including price and availability. Increasingly, intelligent agents 
handle the majority of a company’s Internet buying and selling 
and complete such processes as finding products, bargaining 
over prices, and executing transactions. Intelligent agents also 
have the capability to handle all supply chain buying and selling.
Another application for intelligent agents is in environmental 
scanning and competitive intelligence. For instance, an intel­
ligent agent can learn the types of competitor information users 
want to track, continuously scan the web for it, and alert users 
when a significant event occurs.

nies, artificial intelligence scientists can use hardware and soft­
ware models that incorporate insect characteristics and behavior to 
(1) learn how people-based systems behave, (2) predict how they 
will behave under a given set of circumstances, and (3) improve 
human systems to make them more efficient and effective. This 
process of learning from ecosystems and adapting their character­
istics to human and organizational situations is called biomimicry.

even fantastic offerings will not prevent a company from 
annoying customers and ultimately eroding its own financial 
performance. To avoid this pitfall and protect its competitive 
advantage, a company must continually evaluate all the busi­
ness processes in its value chain. A business process is a stan­
dardized set of activities that accomplish a specific task, such 
as processing a customer’s order. Business processes trans­
form a set of inputs into a set of outputs—goods or services—
for another person or process by using people and tools. Under­
standing business processes helps a manager envision how the 
entire company operates.
Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of its business pro­
cesses will improve the firm’s value chain. The goal of this 
section is to expand on Porter’s value chain analysis by detail­
ing the powerful value-adding relationships between business 
strategies and core business processes. Figure 2.17 illustrates 
several common business processes.
The processes outlined in Figure 2.17 reflect functional thinking. 
Some processes, such as a programming process, may be con­
tained wholly within a single department. However, most, such 
as ordering a product, are cross-functional or cross-departmental 
processes and span the entire organization. The process of “order 
to delivery” focuses on the entire customer order process across 
functional departments (see Figure 2.18). Another example is 
“product realization,” which includes not only the way a product 
is developed, but also the way it is marketed and serviced. Some 
other cross-functional business processes are taking a product from 
concept to market, acquiring customers, loan processing, provid­
ing post-sales service, claim processing, and reservation handling.
Customer-facing processes, also called front-office pro­
cesses, result in a product or service received by an organization’s 
external customer. They include fulfilling orders, communicat­
ing with customers, and sending out bills and marketing infor­
mation. Business-facing processes, also called back office 
processes, are invisible to the external customer but essential 
to the effective management of the business; they include goal 
setting, day-to-day planning, giving performance feedback 
and rewards, and allocating resources. Figure 2.19 ­displays 
the different categories of customer-facing and business-
facing processes along with an example of each.11
A company’s strategic vision should provide guidance on which 
business processes are core, that is, which are directly linked to

the ability to work virtually from 
home. Over 42 percent of IBM’s 
330,000 employees work virtually, 
saving over $100 million per year 
in real estate–related expenses. 
Working virtually offers several 
advantages such as fewer cars on 
the road, increases in worker pro­
ductive, and decreased real estate 
expenses. Drawbacks include the 
fear among workers that they will 
jeopardize their careers by working 
from home, and some workers need a busy environment to stay 
productive. Virtual workers also tend to feel alone, secluded, 
and deprived of vital training and mentoring.

the firm’s critical success factors. 
Mapping these core business pro­
cesses to the value chain reveals 
where the processes touch the cus­
tomers and affect their perceptions 
of value. This type of map con­
ceptualizes the business as a value 
delivery system, allowing manag­
ers to ensure all core business pro­
cesses are operating as efficiently 
and effectively as possible.
A business process patent is a 
patent that protects a specific set 
of procedures for conducting a 
particular business activity. A firm 
can create a value chain map of 
the entire industry to extend criti­
cal success factors and business 
process views beyond its boundar­
ies. Core processes are business 
processes, such as manufacturing 
goods, selling products, and  pro­
viding service, that make up the 
primary activities in a value chain.
A static process uses a sys­
tematic approach in an attempt 
to improve business effective­
ness and efficiency. Managers constantly attempt to optimize 
static process. Examples of static processes include running 
payroll, calculating taxes, and creating financial statements. 
A dynamic process is continuously changing and provides 
business solutions to ever-changing business operations. As the 
business and its strategies change, so do the dynamic processes. 
Examples of dynamic processes include managing layoffs of 
employees, changing order levels based on currency rates, and 
canceling business travel due to extreme weather.

Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a 
graphical notation that depicts the steps in a business process. 
BPMN provides businesses with a graphical view of the end-
to-end flow of their business processes. Diagramming business 
processes allows for easy communication and understanding 
of how core business processes are helping or hindering the 
­business. Figure 2.20 displays the standard notation from www.
BPMN.org and ­Figure 2.21 displays a sample BPMN diagram 
for hiring a taxi cab.13
Business process modeling usually begins with a functional pro­
cess representation of the process problem, or an As-Is process 
model. As-Is process models represent the current state of the 
operation that has been mapped, without any specific improve­
ments or changes to existing processes. The next step is to build 
a To-Be process model that displays how the process problem 
will be solved or implemented. To-Be ­process ­models show 
the results of applying change improvement opportunities to the 
current (As-Is) process model. This approach ensures that the 
process is fully and clearly understood before the details of 
a process solution are decided on. The To-Be process model 
shows how “the what” is to be realized. Figure 2.22 displays 
the As-Is and To-Be process models for ordering a hamburger.
As-Is and To-Be process models are both integral in business 
process reengineering projects because these diagrams are 
very powerful in visualizing the activities, processes, and data 
flow of an organization. Figure 2.23 illustrates an As-Is pro­
cess model of the order-to-delivery process, using swim lanes 
Systems thinking offers a great story to help differentiate 
between static and dynamic processes. If you throw a rock in 
the air, you can predict where it will land. If you throw a bird 
in the air you can’t predict where it will land. The bird, a living 
dynamic, system, will sense its environment and fly in any direc­
tion. The bird gathers and processes input and interacts with its 
environment. The rock is an example of a static process and the 
bird is an example of a dynamic process. Organizations have 
people and are characteristically dynamic, making it difficult to 
predict how the business will operate. Managers must anticipate 
creating and deploying both static and dynamic processes.

BUSINESS PROCESS 
MODELING  LO2.6
Business process modeling, or mapping, is the activity of 
creating a detailed flowchart or process map of a work process 
that shows its inputs, tasks, and activities in a structured sequence. 
A business process model is a graphic description of a pro­
cess, showing the sequence of process tasks, which is developed 
for a specific purpose and from a selected viewpoint. A set of one 
or more process models details the many functions of a system or 
subject area with graphics and text, and its purpose is to:
	∙	 Expose process detail gradually and in a controlled manner.
	∙	 Encourage conciseness and accuracy in describing the 
­process model.

to represent the relevant departments. The swim lane lay­
out arranges the steps of a business process into a set of rows 
depicting the various elements.
You need to be careful not to become inundated in excessive 
detail when creating an As-Is process model. The primary goal 
is to simplify, eliminate, and improve the To-Be processes. 
Process improvement efforts focus on defining the most effi­
cient and effective process identifying all of the illogical, miss­
ing, or irrelevant processes.
Investigating business processes can help an organization find 
bottlenecks, remove redundant tasks, and recognize smooth-
running processes. For example, a florist might have a key 
success factor of reducing delivery time. A florist that has an 
inefficient ordering process or a difficult distribution process 
will be unable to achieve this goal. Taking down inaccurate 
orders, recording incorrect addresses, or experiencing ship­
ping delays can cause errors in the delivery process. Improving 
order entry, production, or scheduling processes can improve 
the delivery process.
Business processes should drive MIS choices and should be 
based on business strategies and goals (see Figure 2.24). Only 
after determining the most efficient and effective business 
process should an organization choose the MIS that supports 
that business process. Of course, this does not always happen, 
and managers may find themselves in the difficult position of 
changing a business process because the system cannot support 
the ideal solution (see Figure 2.24). Managers who make MIS 
choices and only then determine how their business processes 
should perform typically fail.

Workflow includes the tasks, 
activities, 
and 
responsibilities 
required to execute each step 
in a business process. Under­
standing workflow, customers’ 
expectations, and the competitive 
environment provides managers 
with the necessary ingredients to 
design and evaluate alternative 
business processes in order to maintain competitive advantages 
when internal or external circumstances change. Workflow 
control systems monitor processes to ensure tasks, activities, 
and responsibilities are executed as specified.
Alternative business processes should be effective (they 
deliver the intended results) and efficient (they consume the 
least amount of resources for the intended value). They should 
also be adaptable or flexible and support change as custom­
ers, ­market forces, and technology shift. Figure 2.25  shows 
the three primary types of business process change available 
to firms and the business areas in which they are most often 
­effective. How does a company know whether it needs to 
undertake the giant step of changing core business processes? 
Three ­conditions indicate the time is right to initiate a business 
process change:
  BUSINESS PROCESS MODEL AND NOTATION (BPMN)  
  EVENT      
BPMN event  is anything that happens during the course of a business process.
An event is represented by a circle in a business process model. In Figure 2.21, 
the events include customer requests, time requests, or the end of the process. 
ACTIVITY       
BPMN activity  is a task in a business process. An activity is any work that is
being performed in a process. An activity is represented by a rounded-corner
rectangle in a business process model. In Figure 2.21, the activities include
checking availability, picking up the customers, and conﬁrming the booking.  
GATEWAY       
BPMN gateway  is used to control the ﬂow of a process. Gateways handle the
forking, merging, and joining of paths within a process. Gateways are repre-
sented by a diamond shape in a business process model. In Figure 2.21, the
gateways include determining availability status or accepting/declining the
request.   
FLOW
BPMN ﬂows  display the path in which the process ﬂows. Flows are represented
by arrows in a business process model. In Figure 2.21, the arrows show the path
the customer takes through the taxi cab booking process.

Operational Business 
Processes—Automation
Operational business processes are static, routine, 
daily business processes such as stocking inventory, 
checking out customers, or daily opening and closing 
processes. Improving business processes is critical to 
staying competitive in today’s electronic marketplace. 
Organizations must improve their business processes 
because customers are demanding better products and 
services; if customers do not receive what they want from 
one supplier, often they can simply click a mouse to find 
many other choices. Business process improvement 

CHAPTER 2  |  Decisions and Processes: Value Driven Business  55
attempts to understand and measure the current process and 
make performance improvements accordingly. Figure 2.26 
­displays a typical business process improvement model.15
Early adopters of MIS recognized that they could enhance their 
value chain through automation, which reduces costs and increases 
the speed of performing activities. Automation is the process of 
computerizing manual tasks, making them more  efficient and 
effective and dramatically lowering operational costs. Payroll 
offers an excellent example. Calculating and tracking payroll for 
5,000 employees is a highly labor-intensive process requiring 30 
full-time employees. Every two weeks accounting employees 
must gather everyone’s hours worked, cross-check with wage 
rates, and then calculate the amount due, minus taxes and other 
withholding such as pension contributions and insurance premi­
ums, to create the paychecks. They also track benefits, sick time, 
and vacation time. If the payroll process is automated, however, 
one employee can  easily calculate payroll, track withholding 
and deductions, and create paychecks for 5,000 people in a few 
hours, since everything is performed by the system. Automation 
improves efficiency and effectiveness and reduces head count, 
lowering overall operational costs. Transaction processing sys­
tems (TPS) are primarily used to automate business processes.
Figure 2.27  illustrates the basic steps for business process 
improvement. Organizations begin by documenting what they 
currently do; then they establish a way to measure the process, 
follow the process, measure the performance, and finally iden­
tify improvement opportunities based on the collected informa­
tion. The next step is to implement process improvements and 
measure the performance of the new improved process. The 
loop repeats over and over again 
as it is continuously improved.16
This method of improving business 
processes is effective for obtain­
ing gradual, incremental improve­
ment. However, several factors 
have accelerated the need to radi­
cally improve business processes. 
The most obvious is technology. 
New technologies (such as wireless 
Internet access) rapidly bring new 
capabilities to businesses, thereby 
raising the competitive bar and 
the need to improve business pro­
cesses dramatically. For example, 
­Amazon.com reinvented the supply 
chain for selling books online. After 
gaining from automation, compa­
nies began to look for new ways to 
use MIS to improve operations, and 
­managers recognized the benefits 
of pairing MIS with business pro­
cesses by streamlining. We look at 
this improvement method next.

Streamlining improves business process efficiencies by sim­
plifying or eliminating unnecessary steps. Bottlenecks occur 
when resources reach full capacity and cannot handle any addi­
tional demands; they limit throughput and impede operations. 
A computer working at its maximum capacity will be unable to 
handle increased demand and will become a bottleneck in the 
process. Streamlining removes bottlenecks, an important step 
if the efficiency and capacity of a business process are being 
increased. It also eliminates redundancy. Redundancy occurs 
when a task or activity is unnecessarily repeated, for example, 
if both the sales department and the accounting department 
check customer credit.
Automating a business process that contains bottlenecks or 
redundancies will magnify or amplify these problems if they 
are not corrected first. Here’s an example based on a com­
mon source of tension in an organization. Increasing orders 
is a standard KPI for most marketing/sales departments. To 
meet this KPI, the sales department tends to say yes to any 
customer request, such as for rush or custom orders. Reducing

cycle time, the time required to process an order, is a common 
KPI for operations management. Rush and custom orders tend 
to create bottlenecks, causing operations to fall below its bench-
marked cycle time. Removing these bottlenecks, however, can 
create master streamlined business processes that deliver both 
standard and custom orders reliably and profitably. The goal 
of streamlining is not only to automate but also to improve by 
monitoring, controlling, and changing the business process.
FedEx streamlined every business process to provide a CSF of 
speedy and reliable delivery of packages. It created one central 
hub in Memphis, Tennessee, that processed all its orders. It pur­
chased its own planes to be sure it could achieve the desired level 
of service. FedEx combined MIS and traditional distribution and 
logistics processes to create a competitive advantage. FedEx soon 
identified another market segment of customers who cared a lit­
tle less about speed and were willing to trade off early-morning 
delivery for delivery any time within the next day at a signifi­
cantly lower price. The firm had to reevaluate its strategy and 
realign its business processes to capture this market segment. 
Had Federal Express focused only on improving its traditional 
delivery process to handle increased volume faster and more 
reliably, it could have missed an entire customer segment.18
Strategic Business 
Processes—
Reengineering
Strategic business processes 
are dynamic, nonroutine, long-term 
business processes such as financial 
planning, expansion strategies, and 
stakeholder interactions. The flat 
world is bringing more companies 
and more customers into the mar­
ketplace, greatly increasing compe­
tition. Wine wholesalers in the United States must now compete 
globally, for instance, because customers can just as easily order a 
bottle of wine from a winery in France as from them. Companies

analysis and redesign of workflow within and between enter­
prises. Figure 2.28 highlights an analogy to process improvement 
by explaining the different means of traveling along the same 
route. A company could improve the way it travels by changing 
from foot to horse and then from horse to car. With a BPR mind-
set, however, it would look beyond automating and streamlining 
to find a completely different approach. It would ignore the road 
and travel by air to get from point A to point B. Companies often 
follow the same indirect path for doing business, not realizing 
there might be a different, faster, and more direct way.
An organization can reengineer its cross-departmental business 
processes or an individual department’s business processes to 
help meet its CSFs and KPIs. When selecting a business pro­
cess to reengineer, wise managers focus on those core processes 
that are critical to performance, rather than marginal processes 
that have little impact. The effort to reengineer a business pro­
cess as a strategic activity requires a different mind-set than 
that required in continuous business process improvement pro­
grams. Because companies have tended to overlook the power­
ful contribution that processes can make to strategy, they often 
undertake process improvement efforts using their current pro­
cesses as the starting point. Managers focusing on reengineer­
ing can instead use several criteria to identify opportunities:
	∙	 Is the process broken?
	∙	 Is it feasible that reengineering of this process will succeed?
	∙	 Does it have a high impact on the agency’s strategic direction?
	∙	 Does it significantly impact customer satisfaction?
	∙	 Is it antiquated?
	∙	 Does it fall far below best-in-class?
is irrelevant, does not work, or is broken and must be overhauled 
from scratch. Starting from such a clean slate enables business 
process designers to disassociate themselves from today’s pro­
cess and focus on a new process. It is as if they are projecting 
themselves into the future and asking: What should the process 
look like? What do customers want it to look like? What do 
other employees want it to look like? How do best-in-class com­
panies do it? How can new technology facilitate the process?
Figure 2.29  displays the basic steps in a business process 
­reengineering effort. It begins with defining the scope and 
objectives of the reengineering project and then takes the 
process designers through a learning process with custom­
ers, employees, competitors, and new technology. Given this 
knowledge base, the designers can create a plan of action based 
on the gap between current processes, technologies, and struc­
tures and their vision of the processes of the future. It is then 
top management’s job to implement the chosen solution.20
System thinking plays a big role in BPR. Automation and stream­
lining operate departmentally, whereas BPR occurs at the systems 
level or company-wide level and the end-to-end view of a process.
Creating value for the customer is the leading reason for institut­
ing BPR, and MIS often plays an important enabling role. Funda­
mentally new business processes enabled Progressive Insurance 
to slash its claims settlement time from 31 days to four hours, 
for instance. Typically, car insurance companies follow this 
standard claims resolution process: The customer gets into an 
accident, has the car towed, and finds a ride home. The customer 
then calls the insurance company to begin the claims process, 
which includes an evaluation of the damage, assignment of fault,

You Accidently Sent Your 
Confidential Email to Your 
Significant Other to Your 
Grandmother—Ouch!17
If someone at your work currently looked 
through your email, would they find 
anything unacceptable? There is a 99 
percent chance that at some point you 
have been guilty of using your work 
email for personal use. Not only are 
you wasting company time and resources, but 
you are also putting yourself at serious risk of violating company poli­
cies. There is no doubt some of these mistakes are funny, like the embarrass­
ing story of how a woman sent a racy email to her husband, only to have 
accidentally sent it to her boss instead. However, you stop laughing when 
you are fired because it was you who sent the unsuitable email!
You do not own your email; it is that simple. Your employer owns 
your email, and they have every right to read every single piece of email 
that you send or is sent to you. Some people argue that it is an invasion 
of privacy to read someone else’s email, but it is not private when you 
are sitting in the company’s office building, at the company’s desk, using 
the company’s computer equipment and email software. Technology is 
so advanced that your employer can flag anything with inappropriate 
language or keywords such as “résumé,” “job search,” or “confidential.”
How do you prevent email blunders? It is a good idea to create a free 
Google Gmail account or a Hotmail account for your personal email. Also, 
before sending any email, ask yourself: If my boss was looking over my 
shoulder right now, would he or she approve? This is the true litmus test 
that can be applied to anything an employee does at work.
Now, here comes the hard part: What if you are working from home, 
using your own computer? Does the company still have a right to moni­
tor your email? If you are using your own personal smartphone to work 
remotely and you receive the company’s emails on your device, is it still 
company property? What do you think? What additional dilemmas do you 
see being created as innovative technologies continue to change the 
fundamental business process of how we work?
Streamlining Your Email
The biggest problem with email is that it interferes with workflow. Many employees stop what they are working on and begin 
­checking new email as soon as it arrives. If they do not have the time or capacity to answer it immediately, however, they leave it 
in the inbox, creating a bottleneck. This process continues all day, and eventually the inbox is overflowing with hundreds 
of emails, most of which require a response or action. Employees begin dreading email and feel stressed because their 
workflow process is off track, and they do not know which tasks need to be completed and when.
To streamline workflow, you can designate certain times for email processing (at the top of the hour or for 30 minutes 
at three set times a day, for example). Turning off email notification also ensures you are not interrupted during your 
workflow. When you do begin to check your emails, review them one at a time from top to bottom and deal with each one 
immediately. Reply, put a note on your to-do list, forward the email, or delete it. Now you are working far more efficiently 
and effectively, and you are less stressed because your inbox is empty.19
Choose a process in your life that is inefficient or ineffective and causing you stress. Using the principles of streamlining, remove the bottlenecks and 
reduce redundancies. Be sure to diagram the As-Is process and your newly created To-Be process.
and an estimate of the cost of repairs, and which usually takes 
about a month (see Figure 2.30). Progressive Insurance’s inno­
vation was to offer a mobile claims process. When a customer 
has a car accident, he or she calls in the claim on the spot. The 
Progressive claims adjuster comes to the accident site, survey­
ing the scene and taking digital photographs. The adjuster then 
offers the customer on-site payment, towing services, and a ride 
home. A true BPR effort does more for a company than simply 
improve a process by performing it better, faster, and cheaper. 
Progressive Insurance’s BPR effort redefined best practices for 
an entire industry. Figure 2.31 through Figure 2.33 provide addi­
tional examples of business process modeling.21

Street’s most  prominent enterprises, with its stock trading 
above $60 per share in 1997. In 2002, the stock dropped to 8 
cents and the company declared bankruptcy.1
How could a company such as Polaroid, which had innovative 
technology and a captive customer base, go bankrupt? Perhaps 
company executives failed to use Porter’s Five Forces Model to 
analyze the threat of substitute products or services. If they had, 
would they have noticed the two threats—one-hour film pro­
cessing and digital cameras—which eventually stole Polaroid’s 
market share? Would they have understood that their custom­
ers, people who want instant access to their pictures, would 
be the first to try these alternatives? Could the company have 
found a way to compete with one-hour film processing and the 
digital camera to save Polaroid?
Many organizations face the same dilemma as Polaroid—
what’s best for the current business might not be what’s best 
for it in the long term. Some observers of our business environ­
ment have an ominous vision of the future—digital Darwin­
ism. Digital Darwinism implies that organizations that cannot 
adapt to the new demands placed on them for surviving in the 
information age are doomed to extinction.
LO3.1  Compare disruptive and sustaining technologies and 
explain how the Internet and WWW caused business disruption.
Disruptive versus Sustaining 
Technology
A disruptive technology is a new way of doing things that 
initially does not meet the needs of existing customers. Dis­
ruptive technologies tend to open 
new markets and destroy old ones. 
A sustaining technology, on the 
other hand, produces an improved 
product customers are eager to buy, 
such as a faster car or larger hard 
drive. Sustaining technologies tend 
to provide us with better, faster, and 
cheaper products in established mar­
kets. Incumbent companies most 
often lead sustaining technology to 
market, but they virtually never lead 
in markets opened by disruptive tech­
nologies. Figure  3.1 positions com­
panies expecting future growth from 
new investments (disruptive technol­
ogy) and companies expecting future 
growth from existing investments 
(sustaining technology).2
Disruptive technologies typically enter 
the low end of the marketplace and 
eventually evolve to displace high-
end competitors and their reigning 
use to deploy ebusiness and the methods of measuring ebusiness 
success. This chapter will give you this knowledge and help prepare 
you for success in tomorrow’s electronic global marketplace. ■

military communications system operated by the U.S. Depart­
ment of Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), 
which called the network ARPANET. No one foresaw the dra­
matic impact it would have on both business and personal com­
munications. In time, all U.S. universities that had defense-related 
funding installed ARPANET computers, forming the first official 
Internet network. As users began to notice the value of electronic 
communications, the purpose of the network started shifting from 
a military pipeline to a communications tool for scientists.
The Internet and the World Wide Web are not synonymous. The 
WWW is just one part of the Internet, and its primary use is to corre­
late and disseminate information. The Internet includes the WWW 
and also other forms of communication systems such as email. ­Figure

Web 1.0: The Catalyst for Ebusiness
As people began learning about the WWW and the Internet, 
they understood that it enabled a company to communicate with 
anyone, anywhere, at anytime, creating a new way to partici­
pate in business. The competitive advantages for first movers 
technologies. Sony is a perfect example. Sony started as a tiny 
company that built portable, battery-powered transistor radios. 
The sound quality was poor, but customers were willing to over­
look that for the convenience of portability. With the experience 
and revenue stream from the portables, Sony improved its tech­
nology to produce cheap, low-end transistor amplifiers that were 
suitable for home use and invested those revenues in improving 
the technology further, which produced still-better radios.3
The Innovator’s Dilemma, a book by Clayton M. Christensen, 
discusses how established companies can take advantage of 
disruptive technologies without hindering existing relation­
ships with customers, partners, and stakeholders. Xerox, IBM, 
Sears, and DEC all listened to existing customers, invested 
aggressively in technology, had their competitive antennae up, 
and still lost their market-dominant positions. They may have 
placed too much emphasis on satisfying customers’ current 
needs, while neglecting new disruptive technology to meet cus­
tomers’ future needs and thus losing market share.
The Internet and World Wide Web—
The Ultimate Business Disruptors
The Internet is a massive network that connects computers 
all over the world and allows them to communicate with one 
another. Computers connected via the Internet can send and 
receive information including text, graphics, voice, video, and 
software. Originally the Internet was essentially an emergency

Unethical Disruption5
Did you know you can make a living naming things? Eli Altman has been 
naming things since he was six years old and has named more than 400 
companies and brands while working for A Hundred Monkeys, a brand­
ing consulting company. Altman recently noticed an unfamiliar trend in 
the industry: nonsensical names such as Flickr, Socializr, Zoomr, Rowdii, 
Yuuguu, and Oooooc. Why are names like this becoming popular? 
The reason is “domain squatting” or “cyber squatting,” the practice 
of buying a domain to profit from a trademarked name. For example, if 
you wanted to start a business called Drink, chances are a domain squat­
ter has already purchased drink.com and is just waiting for you to pay 
big bucks for the right to buy it. Domain squatting is illegal and outlawed 
under the 1999 Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act. 
Do you agree that domain squatting should be illegal? Why or why 
not? If you were starting a business and someone were squatting on 
your domain, what would you do?

Advancements in networking hardware, software, and media made it 
possible for business computers to be connected to larger networks 
at a minimal cost.
Browser software such as Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Netscape

Internet boom. Web 1.0 (or Business 1.0) is a term to refer 
to the World Wide Web during its first few years of operation 
between 1991 and 2003. Ecommerce is the buying and selling 
of goods and services over the Internet. Ecommerce refers only 
to online transactions. Ebusiness includes ecommerce along 
with all activities related to internal and external business oper-
ations such as servicing customer accounts, collaborating with 
partners, and exchanging real-time information. During Web 
1.0, entrepreneurs began creating the first forms of ebusiness.
Ebusiness opened up a new marketplace for any company will-
ing to move its business operations online. A paradigm shift

or video information. Information reach measures the num­
ber of people a firm can communicate with all over the world. 
Buyers need information richness to make informed purchases, 
and sellers need information reach to properly market and dif­
ferentiate themselves from the competition.
Ebusinesses operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This avail­
ability directly reduces transaction costs, since consumers 
no longer have to spend a lot of time researching purchases 
or traveling great distances to make them. The faster delivery 
cycle for online sales helps strengthen customer relationships, 
improving customer satisfaction and ultimately sales.
A firm’s website can be the focal point of a cost-effective 
communications and marketing strategy. Promoting products 
online allows the company to precisely target its customers

is restricted by size and limited to those customers who can get 
there, while an online store has a global marketplace with cus­
tomers and information seekers already waiting in line.
created a paradigm shift, transforming entire industries and chang­
ing enterprisewide business processes that fundamentally rewrote 
traditional business rules. Deciding not to make the shift to ebusi­
ness proved fatal for many companies (see Figure 3.4 for an over­
view of industries revamped by the disruption of ebusiness).6
Both individuals and organizations have embraced ebusiness 
to enhance productivity, maximize convenience, and improve 
communications. Companies today need to deploy a compre­
hensive ebusiness strategy, and business students need to under­
stand its advantages, outlined in Figure 3.5. Let’s look at each.

Industry
Business Changes Due to Technology
Auto
AutoTrader.com is the world’s largest used-car marketplace, listing millions of cars from both private owners and dealers. 
AutoTrader.com actually helps to increase used-car dealer’s business as it drives millions of qualified leads (potential used-
car buyers) to participating automotive dealers and private sellers.
Publishing
With the Internet, anyone can publish online content. Traditionally, publishers screened many authors and manuscripts and 
selected those that had the best chances of succeeding. Lulu.com turned this model around by providing self-publishing 
along with print-on-demand capabilities.
Education and Training
Continuing medical education is costly, and just keeping up-to-date with advances often requires taking training courses and 
traveling to conferences. Now continuing education in many fields is moving online, and by 2016 over 50 percent of doctors 
will be building their skills through online learning. Companies such as Cisco save millions by moving training to the Internet.
Entertainment
The music industry was hit hard by ebusiness, and online music traders such as iTunes average billions of annual downloads. 
Unable to compete with online music, the majority of record stores closed. The next big entertainment industry to feel the 
effects of ebusiness will be the multibillion-dollar movie business. Video rental stores are closing their doors as they fail to 
compete with online streaming and home rental delivery companies such as Netflix.
Financial Services
Nearly every public efinance company makes money, with online mortgage service Lending Tree leading the pack. 
Processing online mortgage applications is over 50 percent cheaper for customers.
Retail
Forrester Research predicts ebusiness retail sales will grow at a 10 percent annual growth rate through 2014. It 
forecasts U.S. online retail sales will be nearly $250 billion, up from $155 billion in 2009. Online retail sales were recently 
up 11 percent, compared to 2.5 percent for all retail sales.
Travel
Travel site Expedia.com is now the biggest leisure-travel agency, with higher profit margins than even American Express. The 
majority of travel agencies closed as a direct result of ebusiness.

68  MODULE 1  |  Business Driven MIS
Ebusinesses such as Amazon and eBay eliminated the shelf-
space dilemma and were able to offer infinite products.
Netflix offers an excellent example of the long tail. Let’s 
assume that an average Blockbuster store maintains 3,000 
movies in its inventory, whereas Netflix, without physical 
shelf limitations, can maintain 100,000 movies in its inven­
tory. Looking at sales data, the majority of Blockbuster’s rev­
enue comes from new releases that are rented daily, whereas 
older selections are rented only a few times a month and don’t 
repay the cost of keeping them in stock. Thus Blockbuster’s 
sales tail ends at title 3,000 (see Figure 3.6). However, Netflix, 
with no physical limitations, can extend its tail beyond 100,000 
(and with streaming video perhaps 200,000). By extending its 
tail, Netflix increases sales, even if a title is rented only a few 
times.7
Intermediaries are agents, software, or businesses that provide 
a trading infrastructure to bring buyers and sellers together. The 
introduction of ebusiness brought about ­disintermediation, 
which occurs when a business sells directly to the customer 
online and cuts out the intermediary (see Figure 3.7). This busi­
ness strategy lets the company shorten the order process and 
add value with reduced costs or a more responsive and efficient 
service. The disintermediation of the travel agent occurred as 
people began to book their own vacations online, often at a 
Opening New Markets
Ebusiness is perfect for increasing niche-product sales. Mass 
customization is the ability of an organization to tailor its 
products or services to the customers’ specifications. For exam­
ple, customers can order M&M’s in special colors or with cus­
tomized sayings such as “Marry Me.” Personalization occurs 
when a company knows enough about a customer’s likes and 
dislikes that it can fashion offers more likely to appeal to that 
person, say by tailoring its website to individuals or groups 
based on profile information, demographics, or prior transac­
tions. Amazon uses personalization to create a unique portal for 
each of its customers.
Reducing Costs
Chris Anderson, editor-in-chief of Wired magazine, describes 
niche-market ebusiness strategies as capturing the long tail, 
referring to the tail of a typical sales curve. This strategy dem­
onstrates how niche products can have viable and profitable 
business models when selling via ebusiness. In traditional sales 
models, a store is limited by shelf space when selecting prod­
ucts to sell. For this reason, store owners typically purchase 
products that will be wanted or needed by masses, and the store 
is stocked with broad products as there is not room on the shelf 
for niche products that only a few customers might purchase.

Ebusinesses can also inexpensively 
attract new customers with innova­
tive marketing and retain present 
customers with improved service 
and support.
One of the most exciting benefits 
of ebusiness is its low start-up 
costs. Today, anyone can start an 
ebusiness with just a website and 
a great product or service. Even a 
dog-walking operation can benefit 
from being an ebusiness.
Improving 
Effectiveness
Just putting up a simple web­
site does not create an ebusiness. 
Ebusiness websites must create 
buzz, be innovative, add value, 
and provide useful information. In 
short, they must build a sense of 
community and collaboration.
MIS measures of efficiency, such 
as the amount of traffic on a site, 
don’t tell the whole story. They do 
not necessarily indicate large sales 
volumes, for instance. Many web­
sites with lots of traffic have mini­
mal sales. The best way to measure 
ebusiness success is to use effective­
ness MIS metrics, such as the revenue 
generated by web traffic, number of 
new customers acquired by web traf­
fic, and reductions in customer service 
calls resulting from web traffic.
Interactivity 
measures 
advertis­
ing effectiveness by counting visi­
tor interactions with the target ad, 
including time spent viewing the ad, 
number of pages viewed, and number 
of repeat visits to the advertisement. 
Interactivity measures are a giant 
step forward for advertisers, since 
traditional 
advertising 
methods—
newspapers, magazines, radio, and 
television—provide few ways to track 
effectiveness. Figure 3.8 displays the 
ebusiness marketing initiatives allow­
ing companies to expand their reach 
while measuring effectiveness.11
The ultimate outcome of any adver­
tisement is a purchase. Organizations 
use metrics to tie revenue amounts 
cheaper rate. At Lulu.com, anyone can publish and sell print-
on-demand books, online music, and custom calendars, making 
the publisher obsolete.8
In reintermediation, steps are added to the value chain as new 
players find ways to add value to the business process. Levi 
Strauss originally thought it was a good business strategy to 
limit all online sales to its own website. A few years later, the 
company realized it could gain a far larger market share by 
allowing all retailers to sell its products directly to customers. 
As ebusiness matures it has become evident that to serve certain 
markets in volume, some reintermediation may be desirable. 
Cybermediation refers to the creation of new kinds of inter­
mediaries that simply could not have existed before the advent 
of ebusiness, including comparison-shopping sites such as Kel­
koo and bank account aggregation services such as Citibank.9
Operational benefits of ebusiness include business processes 
that require less time and human effort or can be eliminated. 
Compare the cost of sending out 100 direct mailings (paper, 
postage, labor) to the cost of a bulk email campaign. Think 
about the cost of renting a physical location and operating phone 
lines versus the cost of maintaining an online site. Switching to 
an ebusiness model can eliminate many traditional costs associ­
ated with communicating by substituting systems, such as Live 
Help, that let customers chat live with support or sales staff.
Online air travel reservations cost less than those booked over the 
telephone. Online ordering also offers the possibility of merg­
ing a sales order system with order fulfillment and delivery so 
customers can check the progress of their orders at all times.

The more intermediaries that are cut from the distribution chain, the lower the product price. When Dell 
decided to sell its PCs through Walmart many were surprised, because Dell’s direct-to-customer sales 
model was the competitive advantage that had kept Dell the market leader for years.

Nasty-Gal: 8 Years Old and Worth $100 Million
Sophia Amoruso is the founder and CEO of Nasty Gal, an 8-year-old 
online fashion retail company worth over $100 million. Nasty Gal sells 
new and vintage clothing, accessories, and shoes online. Founder 
Sophia Amoruso started the company on eBay, selling one-of-a-kind 
vintage pieces that she sourced, styled, photographed, and shipped 
herself. The following is excerpted from her new book, #GIRLBOSS.
“I never started a business. I started an eBay store, and ended 
up with a business. I never would have done it had I known it was 
going to become this big. I was 22 and, like most 22-year-olds, I was 
looking for a way to pay my rent and buy my Starbucks chai. Had 
someone shown me the future of where Nasty Gal would be in 2014, 
I would have gasped in revulsion, thinking, ‘Oh, no, that is way too 
much work.’
There are different kinds of entrepreneurs. There are the 
ones who start a business because they’re educated and 
choose to, and the ones who do it because it is really the only 
option. I definitely fall into the latter category.”10
The Internet is a great place to start a business! If Sophia 
Amoruso started her business in a traditional store, would she have 
found success? List the advantages Sophia Amoruso gained by sell­
ing her items on eBay. If you could start a business on eBay, what 
would it be and how would you use ebusiness to your advantage?
An associate (affiliate) program allows a business to generate 
commissions or referral fees when a customer visiting its website 
clicks on a link to another merchant’s website. For example, if a 
customer to a company website clicks on a banner ad to another 
vendor’s website, the company will receive a referral fee or 
commission when the customer performs the desired action, 
typically making a purchase or completing a form.
A banner ad is a box running across a website that advertises 
the products and services of another business, usually another 
ebusiness. The banner generally contains a link to the advertiser’s 
website. Advertisers can track how often customers click on a 
banner ad resulting in a click-through to their website. Often the 
cost of the banner ad depends on the number of customers who 
click on the banner ad. Web-based advertising services can track 
the number of times users click the banner, generating 
statistics that enable advertisers to judge whether the 
advertising fees are worth paying. Banner ads are 
like living, breathing classified ads. Tracking the 
number of banner ad clicks is an excellent way 
to understand the effectiveness of the ad on the 
website.
A click-through is a count of the number of people 
who visit one site and click on an advertisement 
that takes them to the site of the advertiser. 
Tracking effectiveness based on click-throughs 
guarantees exposure to target ads; however, it does 
not guarantee that the visitor liked the ad, spent any 
substantial time viewing the ad, or was satisfied with 
the information contained in the ad.
A cookie is a small file deposited on a hard drive by a website 
containing information about customers and their browsing 
activities. Cookies allow websites to record the comings and goings 
of customers, usually without their knowledge or consent.
A pop-up ad is a small web page containing an advertisement that 
appears outside of the current website loaded in the browser. A ­
pop-under ad is a form of a pop-up ad that users do not see until 
they close the current web browser screen.
Viral marketing is a technique that induces websites or users to 
pass on a marketing message to other websites or users, creating 
exponential growth in the message’s visibility and effect. One 
example of successful viral marketing is Hotmail, which promotes 
its service and its own advertisers’ messages in every user’s 
email notes. Viral marketing encourages users of a product or 
service supplied by an ebusiness to encourage friends to join. Viral 
marketing is a word-of-mouth type advertising program.
and number of new customers created directly back to the 
websites or banner ads. Through clickstream data they can 
observe the exact pattern of a consumer’s navigation through a 
site. Figure 3.9 displays different types of clickstream metrics, 
and Figure 3.10 provides definitions of common metrics based 
on clickstream data. To interpret such data properly, managers 
try to benchmark against other companies. For instance, con­
sumers seem to visit their preferred websites regularly, even 
checking back multiple times during a given session.
THE FOUR EBUSINESS 
MODELS  LO3.3
A business model is a plan that details how a company creates, 
delivers, and generates revenues. Some models are quite simple: A 
company produces a good or service and sells it to customers. If the 
company is successful, sales exceed costs and the company gen­
erates a profit. Other models are less straightforward, and some­
times it’s not immediately clear who makes money and how much. 
Radio and network television are broadcast free to anyone with a 
receiver, for instance; advertisers pay the costs of programming.
The majority of online business activities consist of the 
exchange of products and services either between businesses or

between businesses and consumers. An ebusiness model is a 
plan that details how a company creates, delivers, and generates 
revenues on the Internet. Dot-com was the original term for a 
company operating on the Internet. Ebusiness models fall into 
one of four categories: (1) business-to-business, (2) business-
to-­consumer, (3) consumer-to-business, and (4) consumer-to-
consumer (see Figure 3.11).
LO3.3  Compare the four ebusiness models.
Business-to-Business (B2B)
Business-to-business (B2B) applies to businesses buying 
from and selling to each other over the Internet. Examples 
include medical billing service, software sales and licensing, 
and virtual assistant businesses. B2B relationships represent 
80 percent of all online business and are more complex with 
greater security needs than the other types. 
B2B examples include Oracle and SAP.
Electronic marketplaces, or emarketplaces, 
are interactive ­business communities provid­
ing a central market where multiple buyers 
and sellers can engage in ebusiness activities. 
By tightening and automating the relationship 
between the two parties, they create structures 
for conducting commercial exchange, consoli­
dating supply chains, and creating new sales 
channels.
Business-to-
Consumer (B2C)
Business-to-consumer (B2C) applies to 
any business that sells its products or services 
directly to consumers online. Carfax offers car 
buyers detailed histories of used vehicles for 
a fee. An eshop, sometimes referred to as an 
estore or etailer, is an online version of a retail 
store where customers can shop at any hour. It 
can be an extension of an existing store such as 
The Gap or operate only online such as Ama­
zon.com. There are three ways to operate as a 
B2C: brick-and-mortar, click-and-mortar, and 
pure play (see Figure 3.12).

72  MODULE 1  |  Business Driven MIS
Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) applies to customers offering 
goods and services to each other on the Internet. A good example 
of a C2C is an auction where buyers and sellers solicit consecu­
tive bids from each other and prices are determined dynamically. 
Craigslist and eBay are two examples of successful C2C websites, 
linking like-minded buyers with sellers. Other types of online 
auctions include forward auctions where sellers market to many 
buyers and the highest bid wins, and reverse auctions where buy­
ers select goods and services from the seller with the lowest bid.

set their own prices for items such 
as airline tickets or hotel rooms and 
wait for a seller to decide whether 
to supply them. The demand for 
C2B ebusiness will increase over 
the next few years due to custom­
ers’ desire for greater convenience 
and lower prices.

per day. Google then determines a price and a search ranking 
for those keywords based on how much other advertisers are 
willing to pay for the same terms. Pricing for keywords can 
range from 5 cents to $10 a click. Paid search is the ultimate 
in targeted advertising because consumers type in exactly what 
they want. A general search term such as tropical vacation 
costs less than a more specific term such as Hawaiian vacation. 
Whoever bids the most for a term appears in a sponsored adver­
tisement link either at the top or along the side of the search-
results page.12
A search engine is website software that finds other pages 
based on keyword matching similar to Google. Search engine 
ranking evaluates variables that search engines use to deter­
mine where a URL appears on the list of search results. Search 
engine optimization (SEO) combines art along with science 
to determine how to make URLs more attractive to search 
engines resulting in higher search engine ranking. The bet­
ter the SEO, the higher the ranking for a website in the list of 
(see Figure 3.13). Many of the new forms of ebusiness went 
to market without clear strategies on how they were going to 
generate revenue. Google is an excellent example of an ebusi­
ness that did not figure out a way to generate profits until many 
years after its launch.
Google is an excellent example of an ebusiness that did not 
figure out a way to generate profits until many years after its 
launch. Google’s primary line of business is its search engine; 
however, the company does not generate revenue from people 
using its site to search the Internet. It generates revenue from 
the marketers and advertisers that pay to place their ads on the 
site. Adwords are keywords that advertisers choose to pay for 
and appear as sponsored links on the Google results pages.  
About 200 million times each day, people from all over the 
world access Google to perform searches. Adwords, a part of 
the Google site, allows advertisers to bid on common search 
terms. The advertisers simply enter in the keywords they want 
to bid on and the maximum amounts they want to pay per click

EBUSINESS TOOLS FOR 
CONNECTING AND 
COMMUNICATING  LO3.4
As firms began to move online, more MIS tools were created to 
support ebusiness processes and requirements. The tools sup­
porting and driving ebusiness are highlighted in Figure 3.15 
and covered below in detail.
LO3.4  Describe the six ebusiness tools for connecting and 
communicating.
Email
Email, short for electronic mail, is the exchange of digital mes­
sages over the Internet. No longer do business professionals 
have to wait for the mail to receive important documents as 
email single-handedly increased the speed of business by allow­
ing the transfer of documents with the same speed as the tele­
phone. Its chief business advantage is the ability to inform and 
communicate with many people simultaneously, immediately, 
search engine results. SEO is criti­
cal because most people only view 
the first few pages of a search 
result. After that a person is more 
inclined to begin a new search 
than review pages and pages of 
search results. Websites can gen­
erate revenue through:
∙  Pay-per-click: generates rev­
enue each time a user clicks on a 
link to a retailer’s website.
∙  Pay-per-call: generates revenue 
each time a user clicks on a link 
that takes the user directly to an 
online agent waiting for a call.
∙  Pay-per-conversion: generates 
revenue each time a website visi­
tor is converted to a customer.
Ebusinesses must have a revenue model, or a model for making 
money. For instance, will it accept advertising, or sell subscrip­
tions or licensing rights? Figure 3.14 lists the different benefits 
and challenges of various ebusiness revenue models.14

Advertising fees
	■	 Well-targeted advertisements can be 
perceived as value-added content by 
trading participants.
	■	 Easy to implement.
	■	 Limited revenue potential.
	■	 Overdone or poorly targeted adver­
tisements can be disturbing ele­

License fees
	■	 Creates incentives to do many 
transactions.
	■	 Customization and back-end integra­

	■	 Up-front fee is a barrier to entry for 
participants.
	■	 Price differentiation is complicated.
Subscription fees
	■	 Creates incentives to do transactions.
	■	 Price can be differentiated.
	■	 Possibility to build additional revenue 
from new user groups.
	■	 Fixed fee is a barrier to entry for 
participants.
Transaction fees
	■	 Can be directly tied to savings (both 
process and price savings).
	■	 Important revenue source when high 
level of liquidity (transaction volume) is 
reached.
	■	 If process savings are not com­
pletely visible, use of the system 
is discouraged (incentive to move 
transactions offline).
	■	 Transaction fees likely to decrease 
with time.
Value-added services fees
	■	 Service offering can be differentiated.
	■	 Price can be differentiated.
	■	 Possibility to build additional revenue 
from established and new user groups 
(third parties).
	■	 Cumbersome process for customers 
to continually evaluate new services.

as the U.S. mail, but it did not operate in real time. Instant 
­messaging (IMing) is a service that enables instant or real-
time communication between people. Businesses immediately 
saw what they could do:
	∙	 Answer simple questions quickly and easily.
	∙	 Resolve questions or problems immediately.
	∙	 Transmit messages as fast as naturally flowing conversation.
	∙	 Easily hold simultaneous IM sessions with multiple people.
	∙	 Eliminate long-distance phone charges.
	∙	 Quickly identify which employees are at their computers.
Podcasting
Podcasting converts an audio broadcast to a digital 
music player. Podcasts can increase marketing reach and 
build customer loyalty. Companies use podcasts as mar­
keting communication channels discussing everything 
from corporate strategies to detailed product overviews. 
The senior executive team can share weekly or monthly 
podcasts featuring important issues or expert briefings on 
new technical or marketing developments.
Videoconferencing
A videoconference allows people at two or more loca­
tions to interact via two-way video and audio transmis­
sions simultaneously as well as share documents, data, 
computer displays, and whiteboards. Point-to-point vid­
eoconferences connect two people, and multipoint confer­
ences connect more than two people at multiple locations.
Videoconferences can increase productivity because 
users participate without leaving their offices. It can 
improve communication and relationships, because par­
ticipants see each other’s facial expressions and body lan­
guage, both important aspects of communication that are 
lost with a basic telephone call or email. It also reduces 
travel expenses, a big win for firms facing economic chal­
lenges. Of course, nothing can replace meeting someone 
face-to-face and shaking hands, but videoconferencing 
offers a viable and cost-effective alternative.

set of ideas about how all information in a given context should 
be organized. Many companies hire information architects to 
create their website taxonomies. A well-planned taxonomy 
ensures search and navigation are easy and user-friendly. If the 
taxonomy is confusing, the site will soon fail.
THE CHALLENGES 
OF EBUSINESS  LO3.5
Although the benefits of ebusiness are enticing, developing, 
deploying, and managing ebusiness systems are not always 
easy. Figure 3.16 lists the challenges facing ebusiness.15
LO3.5  Identify the four challenges associated with ebusiness.
Identifying Limited Market Segments
The main challenge of ebusiness is the lack of growth in some 
sectors due to product or service limitations. The online food 
sector has not grown in sales, in part because food products 
are perishable and consumers prefer to buy them at the super­
market as needed. Other sectors with limited ebusiness appeal 
include fragile or consumable goods and highly sensitive or 
confidential businesses such as government agencies.
Managing Consumer Trust
Trust in the ebusiness exchange deserves special attention. The 
physical separation of buyer and seller, the physical separa­
tion of buyer and merchandise, and customer perceptions about 
Web Conferencing
Web conferencing, or a webinar, blends videoconferencing 
with document sharing and allows the user to deliver a pre­
sentation over the web to a group of geographically dispersed 
participants. Regardless of the type of hardware or software the 
attendees are running, every participant can see what is on any­
one else’s screen. Schools use web conferencing tools such as 
Illuminate Live to deliver lectures to students, and businesses 
use tools such as WebEx to demonstrate products. Web con­
ferencing is not quite like being there, but professionals can 
accomplish more sitting at their desks than in an airport waiting 
to make travel connections.
Content Management Systems
In the fourth century BC Aristotle catalogued the natural world 
according to a systematic organization, and the ancient library 
at Alexandria was reportedly organized by subject, connect­
ing like information with like. Today content management 
systems (CMS) help companies manage the creation, storage, 
editing, and publication of their website content. CMSs are 
user-friendly; most include web-based publishing, search, navi­
gation, and indexing to organize information; and they let users 
with little or no technical expertise make website changes.
A search is typically carried out by entering a keyword or 
phrase (query) into a text field and clicking a button or a hyper­
link. Navigation facilitates movement from one web page to 
another. Content management systems play a crucial role in 
getting site visitors to view more than just the home page. If 
navigation choices are unclear, visitors may hit the “Back” but­
ton on their first (and final) visit to a website. One rule of thumb 
to remember is that each time a user has to click to find search 
information, there is a 50 percent chance the user will leave the 
website instead. A key principle of good website design, there­

Taxonomy is the scientific classification of organisms into groups 
based on similarities of structure or origin. Taxonomies are also 
used for indexing the content on the website into ­categories and 
subcategories of topics. For example, car is a subtype of vehicle. 
Every car is a vehicle, but not every vehicle is a car; some vehi­
cles are vans, buses, and trucks. Taxonomy terms are arranged 
so that narrower/more specific/“child” terms fall under broader/
more generic/“parent” terms. Information architecture is the

the risk of doing business online provide unique challenges. 
­Internet marketers must develop a trustworthy relationship to 
make that initial sale and generate customer loyalty. A few 
ways to build trust when working online include being acces­
sible and available to communicate in person with your cus­
tomers; using customers’ testimonials that link to your client 
website or to provide their contact information; and accepting 
legitimate forms of payment such as credit cards.
Ensuring Consumer Protection
An organization that wants to dominate with superior customer 
service as a competitive advantage must not only serve but also 
protect its customers, guarding them against unsolicited goods 
and communication, illegal or harmful goods, insufficient 
information about goods and suppliers, invasion of privacy and 
misuse of personal information, and online fraud. System secu­
rity, however, must not make ebusiness websites inflexible or 
difficult to use.
Adhering to Taxation Rules
Many believe that U.S. tax policy should provide a level play­
ing field for traditional retail businesses, mail-order companies, 
and online merchants. Yet the Internet marketplace remains 
mostly free of traditional forms of sales tax, partly because 
ecommerce law is vaguely defined and differs from state to 
state. For now, companies that operate online must obey a 
patchwork of rules about which customers are subject to sales 
tax on their purchases and which are not.

Virtual Abandonment
A
 pproximately 35 percent of online shop­
ping carts are abandoned prior to checkout. 
Abandoned shopping carts relates directly 
to lost revenues for a business. It is like a customer 
walking out of the store leaving their cart full of 
chosen items. Businesses need to focus on why 
the customers are virtually walking out of their 
stores. The problem typically lies in the checkout 
process and can be fixed by the following:
	∙	 Make sure the checkout button is easy to find.
	∙	 Make sure personal information is safe and 
the website’s security is visible.
	∙	 Streamline the checkout process so the cus­
tomer has as few clicks as possible.
	∙	 Do not ask shoppers to create an account 
prior to checkout, but you can ask them to 
create an account after checkout.
	∙	 Ensure your return policy is visible.
Have you ever abandoned a virtual shop­
ping cart? In a group, visit a website that you or 
your peers have recently abandoned and review 
the checkout process. Was it difficult, cumber­
some, or lacking security? Then visit Amazon.

mine whether Amazon is meeting the preceding

WEB 2.0: ADVANTAGES 
OF BUSINESS 2.0  LO3.6
In the mid-1990s the stock market reached an all-time high as 
companies took advantage of ebusiness and Web 1.0, and many 
believed the Internet was the wave of the future. When new 
online businesses began failing to meet earning expectations, 
however, the bubble burst. Some then believed the ebusiness 
boom was over, but they could not have been more wrong.
Web 2.0 (or Business 2.0) is the next generation of Inter­
net use—a more mature, distinctive communications platform 
characterized by new qualities such as collaboration, sharing, 
and free. Business 2.0 encourages user participation and the 
formation of communities that contribute to the content. In 
Business 2.0, technical skills are no longer required to use and 
publish information to the World Wide Web, eliminating entry 
barriers for online business.
Traditional companies tended to view technology as a tool 
required to perform a process or activity, and employees picked 
up information by walking through the office or hanging out 
around the water cooler. Business 2.0 technologies provide a 
virtual environment that, for many new employees, is just as 
vibrant and important as the physical environment. Figure 3.17 
highlights the common characteristics of Web 2.0.16

together thousands of dedicated volun­
teers from around the world. Mozilla’s 
Firefox now holds over 20 percent of the 
browser market and is quickly becoming 
a threat to Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. 
How do open source software compa­
nies generate revenues? Many people 
are still awaiting an answer to this very 
important question.17
User-Contributed 
Content
Ebusiness was characterized by a few 
companies or users posting content for 
the masses. Business 2.0 is character­
ized by the masses posting content for 
the masses. User-contributed content 
(or user-generated content) is cre­
ated and updated by many users for 
many users. Websites such as Flickr, 
Wikipedia, and YouTube, for example, move control of 
online media from the hands of leaders to the hands of users. 
­Netflix and Amazon both use user-generated content to drive 
their ­recommendation tools, and websites such as Yelp use 
­customer reviews to express opinions on products and services. 
­Companies are embracing user-generated content to help with 
everything from marketing to product development and quality 
assurance.
Native advertising is an online marketing concept in which 
the advertiser attempts to gain attention by providing content 
in the context of the user’s experience in terms of its content, 
format, style, or placement.  One of the most popular forms of 
user-generated content is a reputation system, where buyers 
post feedback on sellers. EBay buyers voluntarily comment on 
the quality of service, their satisfaction with the item traded, 
and promptness of shipping. Sellers comment about prompt 
payment from buyers or respond to comments left by the buyer. 
Companies ranging from Amazon to restaurants are using 
reputation systems to improve quality and enhance customer 
satisfaction.
Content Sharing through 
Open Sourcing
An open system consists of nonproprietary hardware and 
software based on publicly known standards that allows third 
parties to create add-on products to plug into or interoperate 
with the system. Thousands of hardware devices and software 
applications created and sold by third-party vendors interoper­
ate with computers, such as iPods, drawing software, and mice.
Source code contains instructions written by a programmer 
specifying the actions to be performed by computer software. 
Closed source is any proprietary software licensed under 
exclusive legal right of the copyright holder.  Open source 
refers to any software whose source code is made available free 
(not on a fee or licensing basis as in ebusiness) for any third 
party to review and modify. Business 2.0 is capitalizing on open 
source software. Mozilla, for example, offers its Firefox web 
browser and Thunderbird email software free. Mozilla believes 
the Internet is a public resource that must remain open and acces­
sible to all; it continuously develops free products by bringing

Collaboration Inside 
the Organization
A collaboration system is a set of tools that supports the 
work of teams or groups by facilitating the sharing and flow 
of information. Business 2.0’s collaborative mind-set gener­
ates more information faster from a wider audience. Collective 
intelligence is collaborating and tapping into the core knowl­
edge of all employees, partners, and customers. Knowledge 
can be a real competitive advantage for an organization. The 
most  common form of collective intelligence found inside 
the organization is knowledge management (KM), which 
involves capturing, classifying, evaluating, retrieving, and 
­sharing information assets in a way that provides context 
for effective decisions and actions. The primary objective 
of knowledge management is to be sure that a company’s 
knowledge of facts, sources of information, and solutions are 
readily available to all employees whenever it is needed. A 
­knowledge management system (KMS) supports the cap­
turing, organization, and dissemination of knowledge (i.e., 
know-how) throughout an organization. KMS can distribute an 
organization’s knowledge base by interconnecting people and 
digitally gathering their expertise.
A great example of a knowledge worker is a golf caddie. Golf 
caddies give advice such as, “The rain makes the third hole 
play 10 yards shorter.” If a golf caddie is good and gives accu­
rate advice it can lead to big tips. Collaborating with other golf 
­caddies can provide bigger tips for all. How can knowledge man­
agement make this happen? Caddies could be rewarded 
for sharing course knowledge by receiving prizes for 
sharing knowledge. The course manager could com­
pile all of the tips and publish a course note­
book for distribution to all caddies. The goal of 
a knowledge management system is that every­
one wins. Here the caddies make bigger tips and 
golfers improve their play by benefiting from the 
collaborative experiences of the caddies, and the 
course owners win as business increases.

Wishes is a nonprofit company that specializes in selling items online 
that are donated by celebrities, such as clothing, jewelry, purses, 
and many other forms of memorabilia. The profits from Wishes are 
used to support initiatives at children’s hospitals around the coun­
try. There have been many volunteers helping at Wishes, which 
has been great for the company but not so great for the company’s 
online presence. The company now has four different websites cre­
ated by four different volunteers, and the only information you can 
find on the success of the four websites follows:

face-to-face conversations and one-way technologies that 
used asynchronous communications, or communication 
such as email in which the message and the response do not 
occur at  the same time. Business 2.0 brought synchronous 
communication, or communications that occur at the same 
time such as IM or chat. Ask a group of college students when 
they last spoke to their parents. For most the answer is less than 
hour ago, as opposed to the traditional response of a few days 
ago. In business, too, continuous connections are now expected 
in today’s collaborative world.
NETWORKING 
COMMUNITIES WITH 
BUSINESS 2.0  LO3.7
Social media refers to websites that rely on user participation 
and user-contributed content, such as Facebook and YouTube. A 
social network is an application that connects people by match­
ing profile information. Providing individuals with the ability to 
network is by far one of the greatest advantages of Business 2.0. 
baby boomers prepare to retire. When they punch out for the 
last time, the knowledge they gleaned about their jobs, compa­
nies, and industries during their long careers will walk out with 
them—unless companies take measures to retain their insights.
Explicit and Tacit Knowledge  Not all information 
is valuable. Individuals must determine what information qual­
ifies as intellectual and knowledge-based assets. In general, 
intellectual and knowledge-based assets fall into one of two 
categories: explicit or tacit. As a rule, explicit ­knowledge 
consists of anything that can be documented, archived, and cod­
ified, often with the help of MIS. Examples of explicit knowl­
edge are assets such as patents, trademarks, business plans, 
marketing research, and customer lists. Tacit knowledge 
is the knowledge contained in people’s heads. The challenge 
inherent in tacit knowledge is figuring out how to recognize, 
generate, share, and manage knowledge that resides in people’s 
heads. While information technology in the form of email, 
instant messaging, and related technologies can help facilitate 
the dissemination of tacit knowledge, identifying it in the first 
place can be a major obstacle.
Collaboration Outside 
the Organization
The most common form of collective intelligence found out­
side the organization is crowdsourcing, which refers to the 
wisdom of the crowd. The idea that collective intelligence is 
greater than the sum of its individual parts has been around for 
a long time (see Figure 3.18). With Business 2.0 the ability to 
efficiently tap into its power is emerging. For many years orga­
nizations believed that good ideas came from the top. CEOs 
collaborated only with the heads of sales and marketing, the 
quality assurance expert, or the road warrior salesman. The 
organization chart governed who should work with whom and 
how far up the chain of command a suggestion or idea would 
travel. With Business 2.0 this belief is being challenged, as 
firms capitalize on crowdsourcing by opening up a task or 
problem to a wider group to find better or cheaper results from 
outside the box.
Crowdfunding sources capital for a project by raising 
many small amounts from a large number of individuals, 
typically via the Internet. With Business 2.0, people can be 
­continuously  connected, a driving force behind collabora­
tion. Traditional ebusiness communications were limited to

Social Not Working18
There are a number of stories of new 
employees who spend so much time on 
social networking sites that they don’t 
have time to perform their jobs, result­
ing in their termination. Here are a 
few tips on what you should not be 
doing with your social networking 
sites.
	∙	 Do not work on your personal 
social networking sites while at work.
	∙	 Be careful not to accidentally reply to multiple ­recipients 
on messages.
	∙	 Be sure to post a professional profile picture. Do not use 
shots of your children or your pets or your fraternity.
	∙	 Be careful to set up all of the security and privacy fea­
tures in your profile.
	∙	 Do not ever address politics or religion.
	∙	 Never continually post something every 5 minutes or 
spam friends with messages. Every time you make a 
move on Facebook, other people know, and you don’t 
want to become annoying.
Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter seem to be everywhere, and it is not 
only new employees who are finding the sites difficult to use in a work 
environment. The question companies are asking is how to tap the social 
networking trend as a business opportunity, rather than simply a way 
to connect. Face-to-face networking enables employees to share ideas, 
information, and resources, but can social networking achieve the same 
goals? Sites such as LinkedIn are helpful in connecting with people you 
want to meet for professional purposes, and Twitter and Facebook can 
be helpful when trying to notify a group of people about a product pro­
motion or event, but how can a business integrate social networking into 
its core processes and add real value to the bottom line?
Source: Facebook.com
Social networking is the practice of expanding your business 
and/or social contacts by constructing a personal network (see 
Figure 3.19). Social networking sites provide two basic func­
tions. The first is the ability to create and maintain a profile that 
serves as an online identity within the environment. The second 
is the ability to create connections between other people within 
the network. Social networking analysis (SNA) maps group 
contacts (personal and professional) identifying who knows 
each other and who works together. In a company it can pro­
vide a vision of how employees work together. It can also iden­
tify key experts with specific knowledge such as how to solve 
a complicated programming problem or launch a new product.
Business 2.0 simplifies access to information and improves the 
ability to share it. Instead of spending $1,000 and two days at 
a conference to meet professional peers, business people can 
now use social networks such as LinkedIn to meet new contacts 
for recruiting, prospecting, and identifying experts on a topic. 
With executive members from all the Fortune 500 companies, 
LinkedIn has become one of the more useful recruiting tools 
on the web.
Social graphs represent the interconnection of relationships 
in a social network. Social networking sites can be especially 
useful to employers trying to find job candidates with unique 
or highly specialized skill sets that may be harder to locate in 
larger communities. Many employers also search social net­
working sites to find “dirt” and character references for poten­
tial employees. Keep in mind that what you post on the Internet 
stays on the Internet.19

82  MODULE 1  |  Business Driven MIS
classify content significantly lowers content categorization costs, 
because there is no complicated nomenclature to learn. Users 
simply create and apply tags as they wish. For example, while 
cell phone manufacturers often refer to their products as mobile 
devices, the folksonomy could include mobile phone, wireless 
phone, smartphone, iPhone, and so on. All these keywords, if 
searched, should take a user to the same site. Folksonomies 
reveal what people truly call things (see Figure 3.21). They have 
been a point of discussion on the web because the whole point of 
having a website is for your customers to find it. The majority of 
websites are found through search terms that match the content.
A website bookmark is a locally stored URL or the address of 
a file or Internet page saved as a shortcut. Social bookmarking 
LO3.7  Explain how Business 2.0 is helping communities 
network and collaborate.
Social Tagging
Tags are specific keywords or phrases incorporated into web­
site content for means of classification or taxonomy. An item 
can have one or more tags associated with it, to allow for 
multiple browseable paths through the items, and tags can be 
changed with minimal effort (see Figure 3.20). Social tagging 
describes the collaborative activity of marking shared online 
content with keywords or tags as a way to organize it for future 
navigation, filtering, or search. The entire user community is 
invited to tag, and thus essentially defines, the content. Flickr 
allows users to upload images and tag them with appropriate 
keywords. After enough people have done so, the resulting tag 
collection will identify images correctly and without bias. A 
hashtag is a keyword or phrase used to identify a topic and is 
preceded by a hash or pound sign (#). For example, the hashtag 
#sandiegofire helped coordinate emergency responses to a fire.
Folksonomy is similar to taxonomy except that crowdsourc­
ing determines the tags or keyword-based classification sys­
tem. Using the collective power of a community to identify and

Viral Foxes and Devil Babies
Viral marketing can be a company’s 
greatest success or its worst nightmare. 
Here are a few popular examples:
	∙	
“What Does the Fox Say?” The 
video created by a pair of Norwegian 
variety show brothers displays peo­
ple dressed up as animals dancing 
around in the woods singing a 
catchy song. The video received 
over 400 million views on YouTube and skyrock­
eted the band Ylvis to virtual stardom.
	∙	 The video of a robotic devil baby left in an unattended stroller in the 
middle of the street in Manhattan attracted over 50 million views in a 
month. The creators of the devil baby video, Thinkmodo, was creating 
buzz for the 20th Century Fox movie it was promoting, Devil’s Due.
	∙	 Domino’s Pizza employees posted a video showing them making 
sandwiches with unsanitary ingredients. The video went viral and 
ended with the arrest of the employees and an apology from the CEO.
Research the web and find an example of a viral video that helped a 
business achieve success and one that caused a business to fail. Do you 
think it is important for a business to try to manage its online reputation 
actively? What can a company do if a negative video goes viral, such as 
the one concerning Domino’s Pizza?
allows users to share, organize, search, and 
manage bookmarks. Del.icio.us, a website 
de­dicated to social bookmarking, provides 
users with a place to store, categorize, 
annotate, and share favorites. Stumble­
Upon is another popular social bookmark­
ing website that allows users to locate 
interesting websites based on their favorite 
subjects. The more you use the service, the 
more the system “learns” about your inter­
ests and the better it can show you websites 
that interest you. StumbleUpon represents 
a new social networking model in which 
content finds the users instead of the other 
way around. StumbleUpon is all about the 
users and the content they enjoy.

Anti-Social Networking20
Before the Internet, angry customers could write letters or make phone 
calls, but their individual power to find satisfaction or bring about change 
was relative weak. Now, disgruntled consumers can create a website 
or upload a video bashing a product or service, and their efforts can be 
instantly seen by millions of people. Though many companies monitor the 
Internet and try to respond to such postings quickly, power has clearly 
shifted to the consumer. Create an argument for or against the follow­
ing statement: “Social networking has given power to the consumer that 
benefits society and creates socially responsible corporations.”

Jonathan Schwartz and GM’s Bob Lutz, who use their blogs for 
marketing, sharing ideas, gathering feedback, press response, 
and image shaping. Starbucks has developed a blog called My 
Starbucks Idea, allowing customers to share ideas, tell Starbucks 
what they think of other people’s ideas, and join discussions. 
Blogs are an ideal mechanism for many businesses since they 
can focus on topic areas more easily than traditional media, with 
no limits on page size, word count, or publication deadline.
Microblogs  Microblogging is the practice of sending 
brief posts (140 to 200 characters) to a personal blog, either 
publicly or to a private group of subscribers who can read the 
posts as IMs or as text messages. The main advantage of micro­
blogging is that posts can be submitted by a variety of means, 
such as instant messaging, email, or the web. By far the most 
popular microblogging tool is Twitter, which allows users to 
send microblog entries called tweets to anyone who has regis­
tered to “follow” them. Senders can restrict delivery to people 
they want to follow them or, by default, allow open access. 
Microblogging is covered in detail in Chapter 7.
Real Simple Syndication (RSS)  Real Simple 
Syndication (RSS) is a web format used to publish frequently 
updated works, such as blogs, news headlines, audio, and video, 
in a standardized format. An RSS document or feed includes full 
or summarized text, plus other informa­
tion such as publication date and author­
ship. News websites, blogs, and podcasts 
use RSS, constantly feeding news to con­
sumers instead of having them search for 
it. In addition to facilitating syndication, 
RSS allows a website’s frequent readers 
to track updates on the site.
Wikis
A wiki (the word is Hawaiian for quick) 
is a type of collaborative web page that 
allows users to add, remove, and change 
content, which can be easily organized 
and reorganized as required. While blogs 
have largely drawn on the creative and 
personal goals of individual authors, 
wikis are based on open collaboration 
with anybody and everybody. Wikipedia, 
BUSINESS 2.0 TOOLS FOR 
COLLABORATING  LO3.8
Social networking and collaborating are leading businesses in 
new directions, and Figure 3.22 provides an overview of the tools 
that harness the “power of the people,” allowing users to share 
ideas, discuss business problems, and collaborate on solutions.
LO3.8  Describe the three Business 2.0 tools for collaborating.
Blogs
A blog, or Web log, is an online journal that allows users to 
post their own comments, graphics, and video. Unlike traditional 
HTML web pages, blog websites let writers communicate—
and reader’s respond—on a regular basis through a simple yet 
­customizable interface that does not require any programming. 
A selfie is a self-photograph placed on a social media website.
From a business perspective, blogs are no different from market­
ing channels such as video, print, audio, or presentations. They 
all deliver results of varying kinds. Consider Sun Microsystem’s

­Mötley 
Crüe?21
Eurpac, an employee-owned com­
pany, performs business in several 
industries from tobacco to video 
games. Mike Skinner, CIO of Eur­
pac, asks the following questions 
every single time he meets with 
his staff:
	∙	 Where are resources invested?
	∙	 What progress have we made?
	∙	 What’s our next goal?
By cultivating a corporate cul­
ture focused on innovation and technology, his 
creative team developed the platform for Artist­
2Market, a website where performing artists 
can record, develop, and distribute their work, 
a unique alternative to the traditional music 
label infrastructure. The goal of Artist2Market 
is to give the artist complete creative control of 
their project, maximize their exposure to their 
fan base, and minimize their project costs. The 
idea for Artist2Market was developed out of a 
chance meeting between Mötley 
Crüe drummer Tommy Lee and 
A2M General Manager Paul Igna­
sinski. Tommy Lee was interested 
in producing and distributing a 
record without having to rely on 
a major label. Ignasinski went 
back to Michigan and developed 
the concept that is now known as 
Artist2Market.
Artist2Market is an excellent 
example of how you can use the 
power of the Internet to funda­
mentally change entire industries. 
Takelessons.com is also highly 
profitable as it connects music stu­
dents with instructors. One of the 
easiest ways to create a new online business is to 
create a mashup. Using your knowledge of mash­
ups, create a new website that would have the 
ability to completely transform an industry such 
as Artist2Market did with the recording industry.

the open encyclopedia that launched in 2001, has become one 
of the 10 most popular web destinations, reaching an estimated 
217 million unique visitors a month.
A wiki user can generally alter the original content of any arti­
cle, while the blog user can only add information in the form of 
comments. Large wikis, such as Wikipedia, protect the quality 
and accuracy of their information by assigning users roles such 
as reader, editor, administrator, patroller, policy maker, subject 
matter expert, content maintainer, software developer, and sys­
tem operator. Access to some important or sensitive Wikipedia 
material is limited to users in these authorized roles.
The network effect describes how products in a network increase 
in value to users as the number of users increases. The more users 
and content managers on a wiki, the greater the network effect 
because more users attract more contributors, whose work attracts 
more users, and so on. For example, Wikipedia becomes more 
valuable to users as the number of its contributors increases.
Wikis internal to firms can be vital tools for collecting and dis­
seminating knowledge throughout an organization, across geo­
graphic distances, and between functional business areas. For 
example, what U.S. employees call a “sale” may be called “an 
order booked” in the United Kingdom, an “order scheduled” 
in Germany, and an “order produced” in France. The corpo­
rate wiki can answer any questions about a business process 
or definition. Companies are also using wikis for documenta­
tion, reporting, project management, online dictionaries, and 
discussion groups. Of course, the more employees who use the 
corporate wiki, the greater the network effect and valued added 
for the company.
Mashups
A mashup is a website or web 
application that uses content from 
more than one source to create a 
completely new product or service. 
The term is typically used in the 
context of music; putting Jay-Z lyr­
ics over a Radiohead song makes 
something old new. The web ver­
sion of a mashup allows users to 
mix map data, photos, video, news 
feeds, blog entries, and so on to 
create content with a new purpose. 
Content used in mashups is typi­
cally sourced from an application 
programming interface (API), 
which is a set of routines, protocols, 
and tools for building software 
applications. A programmer then 
puts these building blocks together.
Most 
operating 
environments, 
such as Microsoft Windows, pro­
vide an API so that programmers 
can write applications consistent 
with them. Many people experi­
menting with mashups are using Microsoft, Google, eBay, 
Amazon, Flickr, and Yahoo APIs, leading to the creation of 
mashup editors. Mashup ­editors are WYSIWYG, or What 
You See Is What You Get tools. They provide a visual interface

to build a mashup, often allowing the user to drag and drop data 
points into a web application. An ezine is a magazine published 
only in electronic form on a computer network. Flipboard is 
a social-network aggregation, magazine-format application 
software for multiple devices that collects content from social 
media and other websites, presents it in magazine format, and 
allows users to flip thorough the content from social media and 
other websites, presents it in magazine format, and allows users 
to flip through the content.
Whoever thought technology could help sell bananas? Dole 
Organic now places three-digit farm codes on each banana 
and creates a mashup using Google Earth and its banana data­
base. Socially and environmentally conscious buyers can plug 
the numbers into Dole’s website and look at a bio of the farm 
where the bananas were raised. The site tells the story of the 
farm and its surrounding community, lists its organic certifica­
tions, posts some photos, and offers a link to satellite images of 
the farm in Google Earth. Customers can personally monitor 
the production and treatment of their fruit from the tree to the 
grocer. The process assures customers that their bananas have 
been raised to proper organic standards on an environmentally 
friendly, holistically minded plantation.22
THE CHALLENGES 
OF BUSINESS 2.0  LO3.9
As much as Business 2.0 has positively changed the global land­
scape of business, a few challenges remain in open source soft­
ware, user-contributed content systems, and collaboration systems, 
all highlighted in Figure 3.23. We’ll briefly describe each one.
LO3.9  Explain the three challenges associated with Business 2.0.
Technology Dependence
Many people today expect to be continuously connected, 
and their dependence on technology glues them to their web 
connections for everything from web conferencing for a uni­
versity class or work project to making plans with friends for 
dinner. If a connection is down, how will they function? How 
long can people go without checking email, text messaging, or 
listening to free music on Pandora or watching on-demand tele­
vision? As society becomes more technology-dependent, out­
ages hold the potential to cause ever-greater havoc for people, 
businesses, and educational institutions.
Information Vandalism
Open source and sharing are both major advantages of 
­Business 2.0, and ironically they are major challenges as well. 
Allowing anyone to edit anything opens the door for individu­
als to purposely damage, destroy, or vandalize website content. 
One of the most famous examples of wiki vandalism occurred 
when a false biography entry read that John Seigenthaler Sr. 
was assistant to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy in the 
early 1960s and was thought to have been directly involved in 
the assassinations of both Kennedy and his brother, President 
John F. Kennedy. Seigenthaler did work as an assistant to 
­Robert Kennedy, but he was never involved in the assassina­
tions. Wiki vandalism is a hot issue and for this reason wiki 
software can now store all versions of a web page, tracking 
updates and changes and ensuring the site can be restored to 
its original form if the site is vandalized. It can also color-code 
the background ensuring the user understands which areas have 
been validated and which areas have not. The real trick to wiki 
Kiva Collaboration
Kiva’s mission is to connect people through lend­
ing for the sake of alleviating poverty. Kiva is a 
micro-lending online nonprofit organization that 
Living the
enables individuals to lend directly to entrepre­
neurs throughout the world. If you want to partici­
pate in Kiva you simply browse the website (www.
kiva.org) and choose an entrepreneur that inter­
ests you, make a loan, then track your entrepre­
neur for the next 6 to 12 months while he or she 
builds the business and makes the funds to repay 
the loan. When the loan is up you can relend the 
money to someone else who is in need.23
Kiva is an excellent example of blending 
ethics and information technology. How is Kiva 
operating differently than traditional nonprofits? 
What are the risks associated with investing in 
Kiva? When you invest in Kiva you run three pri­
mary risks: entrepreneur risk, local field partner 
risk, and country risk. Analyze each of these 
risks for potential unethical issues that might 
arise when donating to Kiva.

software is to determine which statements are true and which 
are false, a huge issue when considering how easy and fre­
quently wiki software is updated and changed.24
Violations of Copyright and Plagiarism
Online collaboration makes plagiarism as easy as clicking a 
mouse. Unfortunately a great deal of copyrighted material tends 
to find its way to blogs and wikis where many times blame can­
not be traced to a single person. Clearly stated copyright and 
plagiarism policies are a must for all corporate blogs and wikis. 
These topics are discussed in detail in Chapter 4.
WEB 3.0: DEFINING 
THE NEXT 
GENERATION OF 
ONLINE BUSINESS 
OPPORTUNITIES  LO3.10
While Web 1.0 refers to static text-based information websites 
and Web 2.0 is about user-contributed content, Web 3.0 is 
based on “intelligent” web applications using natural language 
processing, machine-based learning and reasoning, and intel­
ligent applications. Web 3.0 is the next step in the evolution 
of the Internet and web applications. Business leaders who 
explore its opportunities will be the first to market with com­
petitive advantages.
Web 3.0 offers a way for people to describe information such 
that computers can start to understand the relationships among 
concepts and topics. To demonstrate the power of Web 3.0, 
let’s look at a few sample relationships, such as Adam Sandler 
is a comedian, Lady Gaga is a singer, and Hannah is friends 
with Sophie. These are all examples of descriptions that can be 
added to web pages allowing computers to learn about relation­
ships while displaying the information to humans. With this 
kind of information in place, there will be a far richer interac­
tion between people and machines with Web 3.0.
Applying this type of advanced relationship knowledge to a 
company can create new opportunities. After all, businesses run 
on information. Where Web 2.0 brings people closer together 
with information using machines, Web 3.0 brings machines 
closer together using information. These new relationships 
unite people, machines, and information so a business can be 
smarter, quicker, more agile, and more successful.
One goal of Web 3.0 is to tailor online searches and requests 
specifically to users’ preferences and needs. For example, 
instead of making multiple searches, the user might type a com­
plex sentence or two in a Web 3.0 browser, such as “I want to 
Using 
Hashtags
If you have ever seen a word with a 
# before it in Facebook or Twitter, you 
have seen a hashtag. A hashtag is a keyword 
or phrase used to identify a topic and is pre­
ceded by a hash or pound sign (#). Hashtags 
provide an online audience to expand business 
exposure and directly engage with customers. 
Customers can type any search keyword in a 
social media site with a hashtag before the 
word and the search results will show all related 
posts. Hashtags can be used to reference pro­
motions, observe market trends, and even pro­
vide links to helpful tips.
When you understand hashtags, you can use 
them to find business ideas and research poten­
tial employers. Pick a company you would like 
to work for and see whether you can find any 
related hashtags including what they are tweet­
ing and posting. See whether you can find any 
information on partners and competitors. Which 
hashtags generate discussion or offer business 
insights? Check Twitter’s and Facebook’s trend­
ing topics and see whether there are any issues 
or insights on your career area.
Connectivity Break-Down
W
hen you are considering connectivity 
services for your business, you need to 
take continuous access and connectiv­
ity seriously. What if one of your employees is 
about to close a huge multimillion-dollar deal 
and loses the Internet connection, jeopardiz­
ing the deal? What if a disgruntled employee 
decides to post your business’s collective intel­
ligence on an open-source blog or wiki? What 
if your patient scheduling software crashes and 
you have no idea which patients are sched­
uled to which operating rooms with which 
doctors? These are far worse scenarios than a 
teenage boy not gaining access to his email or 
Facebook page. What management and tech­
nical challenges do you foresee as people and 
businesses become increasingly dependent on 
connectivity? What can managers do to meet 
these challenges and prevent problems?

see a funny movie and then eat at 
a good Mexican restaurant. What 
are my options?” The Web 3.0 
browser will analyze the request, 
search the web for all possible 
answers, organize the results, and 
present them to the user.
Tim Berners-Lee, one of the 
founders of the World Wide Web, 
has described the semantic web 
as a component of Web 3.0 that 
describes things in a way that com­
puters can understand. The seman­
tic web is not about links between 
web pages; rather it describes 
the relationships between things 
(such as A is a part of B and Y is 
a member of Z) and the properties 
of things (size, weight, age, price). 
If information about music, cars, concert tickets, and so on is 
stored in a way that describes the information and associated 
resource files, semantic web applications can collect informa­
tion from many different sources, combine it, and present it 
to users in a meaningful way. Although Web 3.0 is still a bit 
speculative, some topics and features are certain to be included 
in it, such as:
	∙	 Integration of legacy devices: the ability to use current 
devices such as iPhones, laptops, and so on as credit cards, 
tickets, and reservations tools.
	∙	 Intelligent applications: the use of agents, machine learning, 
and semantic web concepts to complete intelligent tasks for 
users.
	∙	 Open ID: the provision of an online identity that can be easily 
carried to a variety of devices (cell phones, PCs) allowing for 
easy authentication across different websites.
	∙	 Open technologies: the design of websites and other soft­
ware so they can be easily integrated and work together.
	∙	 A worldwide database: the ability for databases to be distrib­
uted and accessed from anywhere.25

business.
Egovernment: The Government 
Moves Online
Recent business models that have arisen to enable organiza­
tions to take advantage of the Internet and create value are 
within egovernment. Egovernment involves the use of strate­
gies and technologies to transform government(s) by improv­
ing the delivery of services and enhancing the quality of 
interaction between the citizen-consumer within all branches 
of government.
One example of an egovernment portal, First-Gov.gov, the 
official U.S. gateway to all government information, is the cat­
alyst for a growing electronic government. Its powerful search 
engine and ever-growing collection of topical and customer-
focused links connect users to millions of web pages, from the 
federal government, to local and tribal governments, to foreign 
nations around the world. Figure 3.24 highlights specific egov­
ernment models.

Mbusiness: Supporting Anywhere 
Business
Internet-enabled mobile devices are quickly outnumber­
ing personal computers. Mobile business (or mbusiness, 
­mcommerce) is the ability to purchase goods and services 
through a wireless Internet-enabled device. The emerging tech­
nology behind mbusiness is a mobile device equipped with 
a web-ready micro-browser that can perform the following 
services:
	∙	 Mobile entertainment—downloads for music, videos, games, 
voting, ring tones, as well as text-based messaging services.
	∙	 Mobile sales/marketing—advertising, campaigns, discounts, 
promotions, and coupons.
	∙	 Mobile banking—manage accounts, pay bills, receive alerts, 
and transfer funds.
	∙	 Mobile ticketing—purchase tick­
ets for entertainment, transpor­
tation, and parking including 
the ability to automatically feed 
parking meters.
	∙	 Mobile payments—pay for goods 
and services including instore 
purchases, home delivery, vend­
ing machines, taxis, gas, and 
so on.
Organizations face changes more extensive and far reaching 
in their implications than anything since the modern indus­
trial revolution occurred in the early 1900s. Technology is a 
primary force driving these changes. Organizations that want 
to survive must recognize the immense power of technology, 
carry out required organizational changes in the face of it, and 
learn to operate in an entirely different way.

Companies must ensure that personal

You, the business student, must understand ethics and secu­
rity because they are the top concerns voiced by customers 
today. The way they are handled directly influences a customer’s 
likelihood of embracing electronic technologies and conducting 
business over the web–and thus the company’s bottom line. You 
can find evidence in recent news reports about how the stock 
price of organizations falls dramatically when information privacy 
and security breaches are made known. Further, organizations 
face potential litigation if they fail to meet their ethical, privacy, 
and security obligations in the handling of information. ■

invention and is granted by a government to the inventor. As it 
becomes easier for people to copy everything from words and 
data to music and video, the ethical issues surrounding copy­
right infringement and the violation of intellectual property 
rights are consuming the ebusiness world. Technology poses 
new challenges for our ethics—the principles and standards 
that guide our behavior toward other people.
The protection of customers’ privacy is one of the largest, and 
murkiest, ethical issues facing organizations today. Privacy is 
the right to be left alone when you want to be, to have control 
over your personal possessions, and not to be observed without 
your consent. Privacy is related to confidentiality, which is 
the assurance that messages and information remain available 
only to those authorized to view them. Each time employees 
make a decision about a privacy issue, the outcome could sink 
the company.
Trust among companies, customers, partners, and suppliers is 
the support structure of ebusiness. Privacy is one of its main 
ingredients. Consumers’ concerns that their privacy will be 
violated because of their interactions on the web continue to be 
one of the primary barriers to the growth of ebusiness.
Information ethics govern the ethical and moral issues aris­
ing from the development and use of information technologies, 
as well as the creation, collection, duplication, distribution, 
and processing of information itself (with or without the aid of 
computer technologies). Ethical dilemmas in this area usually 
arise not as simple, clear-cut situations but as clashes among 
competing goals, responsibilities, and loyalties. Inevitably, 
there will be more than one socially acceptable or “correct” 
decision. The two primary areas concerning software include 
pirated software and counterfeit software. Pirated software 
is the unauthorized use, duplication, distribution, or sale of 
copyrighted software. Counterfeit software is software that 
is manufactured to look like the real thing and sold as such. 
Digital rights management is a technological solution that 
allows publishers to control their digital media to discourage, 
limit, or prevent illegal copying and distribution. Figure 4.1 
contains examples of ethically questionable or unacceptable 
uses of information technology.1
Unfortunately, few hard and fast rules exist for always deter­
mining what is ethical. Many people can either justify or con­
demn the actions in Figure 4.1, for example. Knowing the law

ETHICS  LO4.1
Ethics and security are two fundamental building blocks for 
all organizations. In recent years, enormous business scandals 
along with 9/11 have shed new light on the meaning of eth­
ics and security. When the behavior of a few individuals can 
destroy billion-dollar organizations, the value of ethics and 
security should be evident.
Copyright is the legal protection afforded an expression of 
an idea, such as a song, book, or video game. Intellectual 
­property is intangible creative work that is embodied in physi­
cal form and includes copyrights, trademarks, and patents.

is credit. A representative for Equifax 
stated, “As long as AT&T Wireless (or 
any company for that matter) is offering 
the cell phone service on a credit basis, 
such as allowing the use of the service 
before the consumer has to pay, it is in 
compliance with the FCRA.” However, 
the question remains—is it ethical?2 ­
Figure 4.2 shows the four quadrants where 
ethical and legal behaviors intersect. The 
goal for most businesses is to make deci­
sions within quadrant I that are both legal 
and ethical. There are times when a busi­
ness will find itself in the position of making a decision in 
quadrant III, such as hiring child labor in foreign countries, or 
in quadrant II where a business might pay a foreigner who is in 
the process of getting her immigration status approved because 
the company is in the process of hiring the person. A business 
should never find itself operating in quadrant IV. Ethics are 
critical to operating a successful business today.
LO4.1  Explain the ethical issues in the use of information 
technology.
Information Does Not Have 
Ethics; People Do
Information itself has no ethics. It does not care 
how it is used. It will not stop itself from spam­
ming customers, sharing itself if it is sensitive 
or personal, or revealing details to third parties. 
Information cannot delete or preserve itself. 
Therefore, it falls to those who own the infor­
mation to develop ethical guidelines about how 
to manage it. 
A few years ago the ideas of information man­
agement, governance, and compliance were 
relatively obscure. Today, these concepts are a 
must for virtually every company, both domestic 
and global, primarily due to the role digital infor­
mation plays in corporate legal proceedings or 
litigation. Frequently, digital information serves 
as key evidence in legal proceedings and it is 
is important but that knowledge will not always help, because 
what is legal might not always be ethical, and what might 
be ethical is not always legal. For example, Joe Reidenberg 
received an offer for AT&T cell phone service. AT&T used 
Equifax, a credit reporting agency, to identify potential custom­
ers such as Joe Reidenberg. Overall, this seemed like a good 
business opportunity between Equifax and AT&T wireless. 
Unfortunately, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) forbids 
repurposing credit information except when the information is 
used for “a firm offer of credit or insurance.” In other words, 
the only product that can be sold based on credit information

 Information - Does It Have Ethics?
A
 high school principal decided it was a 
good idea to hold a confidential con­
versation about teachers, salaries, and 
student test scores on his cellular phone in a 
local Starbucks. Not realizing that one of the stu­
dents’ parents was sitting next to him, the prin­
cipal accidentally divulged sensitive information 
about his employees and students. The irate 
parent soon notified the school board about the 
principal’s inappropriate behavior and a com­
mittee was formed to decide how to handle the 
situation.
With the new wave of collaboration tools, 
electronic business, and the Internet, employ­
ees are finding themselves working outside 
the office and beyond traditional office hours. 
Advantages associated with remote work­
ers include increased productivity, decreased 
expenses, and boosts in morale as employees 
are given greater flexibility to choose their work 
location and hours. Unfortunately, disadvan­
tages associated with workers working remotely 
include new forms of ethical challenges and 
information security risks. 
In a group, discuss the following statement: 
Information does not have any ethics. If you were 
elected to the committee to investigate the prin­
cipal’s inappropriate Starbucks phone conversa­
tion, what types of questions would you want 
answered? What type of punishment, if any, would 
you enforce on the principal? What types of poli­
cies would you implement across the school dis­
trict to ensure that this scenario is never repeated? 
Be sure to highlight how workers working 
remotely affect business along with any potential 
ethical challenges and information security issues.

Ethical Computer Use Policy
In a case that illustrates the perils of online betting, a leading 
Internet poker site reported that a hacker exploited a security 
flaw to gain an insurmountable edge in high-stakes, no-limit 
Texas hold-’em tournaments—the ability to see his opponents’ 
hole cards. The cheater, whose illegitimate winnings were esti­
mated at between $400,000 and $700,000 by one victim, was 
an employee of AbsolutePoker.com and hacked the system 
to show that it could be done. Regardless of what business a 
­company operates—even one that many view as unethical—the 
company must protect itself from unethical employee behavior.6

Treating sensitive corporate information as a valuable resource 
is good management. Building a corporate culture based on eth­
ical principles that employees can understand and implement is 
responsible management. Organizations should develop writ­
ten policies establishing employee guidelines, employee proce­
dures, and organizational rules for information. These policies 
set employee expectations about the organization’s practices 
and standards and protect the organization from misuse of com­
puter systems and IT resources. If an organization’s employees 
use computers at work, the organization should, at a minimum, 
implement epolicies. Epolicies are policies and procedures

to Risk It?4
Ethics. It’s just one tiny word, but 
it has monumental impact on every 
area of business. From the maga­
zines, blogs, and newspapers you 
read to the courses you take, you 
will encounter ethics because it is 
a hot topic in today’s electronic 
world. Technology has provided 
so many incredible opportunities, but it has also 
provided those same opportunities to unethical people. Discuss the 
ethical issues surrounding each of the following situations (yes, these 
are true stories):
	∙	 A student stands up the first day of class before the professor arrives 
and announces that his fraternity scans textbooks and that he has the 
textbook for this course on his thumb drive, which he will gladly sell 
for $20. Several students pay on the spot and upload the scanned 
textbook to their PCs. One student takes down the student informa­
tion and contacts the publisher about the incident.
	∙	 A senior manager is asked to monitor his employee’s email because 
there is a rumor that the employee is looking for another job.
	∙	 A vice president of sales asks her employee to burn all of the 
­customer data onto an external hard drive because she made a deal 
to provide customer information to a strategic partner.
	∙	 A senior manager is asked to monitor his employee’s email to 
­discover if she is sexually harassing another employee.
	∙	 An employee is looking at the shared network drive and discovers his 
boss’s entire hard drive, including his email backup, has been copied 
to the network and is visible to all.
	∙	 An employee is accidentally copied on an email that lists the targets 
for the next round of layoffs.

starting point and the umbrella for any other policies 
the organization might establish.
Part of an ethical computer use policy can include a 
BYOD policy. A bring your own device (BYOD) 
policy allows employees to use their personal mobile 
devices and computers to access enterprise data and 
applications. BYOD policies offer four basic options, 
including:
	∙	
Unlimited access for personal devices.
	∙	
Access only to nonsensitive systems and data.
	∙	
Access, but with IT control over personal devices, 
apps, and stored data.
	∙	
Access, but preventing local storage of data on 
personal devices.
Information Privacy Policy
An organization that wants to protect its information should 
develop an information privacy policy, which contains 
general principles regarding information privacy. Visa cre­
ated Inovant to handle all its information systems, including 
its coveted customer information, which details how people 
are spending their money, in which stores, on which days, and 
even at what time of day. Just imagine what a sales and mar­
keting department could do if it gained access to this informa­
tion. For this reason, Inovant bans the use of Visa’s customer 
information for anything outside its intended purpose—billing. 
Innovant’s privacy ­specialists developed a strict credit card 
information privacy policy, which it follows.
Now Inovant is being asked if it can guarantee that unethi­
cal use of credit card information will never occur. In a large 
majority of cases, the unethical use of information happens 
not through the malicious scheming of a rogue marketer, but 
rather unintentionally. For instance, information is collected 
and stored for some purpose, such as record keeping or bill­
ing. Then, a sales or marketing professional figures out another 
way to use it internally, share it with partners, or sell it to a 
trusted third party. The information is “unintentionally” used 
for new purposes. The classic example of this type of uninten­
tional information reuse is the Social Security number, which 
started simply as a way to identify government retirement ben­
efits and then was used as a sort of universal personal ID, found 
on everything from drivers’ licenses to savings accounts.
comments transmitted via the Internet or posted on the website. 
A threat is an act or object that poses a danger to assets. Click-
fraud is the abuse of pay-per-click, pay-per-call, and pay-per-
conversion revenue models by repeatedly clicking on a link 
to increase charges or costs for the advertiser. ­Competitive 
click-fraud is a computer crime where a ­competitor or disgrun­
tled employee increases a company’s search advertising costs 
by repeatedly clicking on the advertiser’s link. Cyberbullying 
and click-fraud are just a few examples of the many types of 
unethical computer use found today.
One essential step in creating an ethical corporate culture 
is establishing an ethical computer use policy. An ethical 
­computer use policy contains general principles to guide 
computer user behavior. For example, it might explicitly state 
that users should refrain from playing computer games dur­
ing working hours. This policy ensures the users know how to 
behave at work and the organization has a published standard 
to deal with infractions. For example, after appropriate warn­
ings, the company may terminate an employee who spends sig­
nificant amounts of time playing computer games at work.
Organizations can legitimately vary in how they expect 
employees to use computers, but in any approach to controlling 
such use, the overriding principle should be informed consent. 
The users should be informed of the rules and, by agreeing to 
use the system on that basis, consent to abide by them.
Managers should make a conscientious effort to ensure all 
users are aware of the policy through formal training and other 
means. If an organization were to have only one epolicy, it 
should be an ethical computer use policy because that is the

CHAPTER 4  |  Ethics and Information Security: MIS Business Concerns  97
Fair information practices is a general term for a set of standards 
governing the collection and use of personal data and address­
ing issues of privacy and accuracy. Different organizations and 
countries have their own terms for these concerns. The United 
­Kingdom terms it “Data Protection,” and the European Union 
calls it “Personal Data Privacy”; the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) has written Guidelines 
on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal 
Data, which can be found at www.oecd.org/unitedstates.
Acceptable Use Policy
An acceptable use policy (AUP) requires a user to agree to 
follow it to be provided access to corporate email, informa­
tion systems, and the Internet. Nonrepudiation is a contrac­
tual stipulation to ensure that ebusiness participants do not 
deny (repudiate) their online actions. A nonrepudiation clause 
is typically contained in an acceptable use policy. Many busi­
nesses and educational facilities require employees or students 
to sign an acceptable use policy before gaining network 
access. When signing up with an email provider, each 
customer is typically presented with an AUP, which 
states the user agrees to adhere to certain stipu­
lations. Users agree to the following in a typi­
cal acceptable use policy:
	∙	 Not using the service as part of violating any law.
	∙	 Not attempting to break the security of any 
computer network or user.
	∙	 Not posting commercial messages to groups 
without prior permission.
	∙	 Not performing any nonrepudiation.
Some organizations go so far as to create a unique informa­
tion management policy focusing solely on Internet use. An 
­Internet use policy contains general principles to guide the 
proper use of the Internet. Because of the large amounts of

Due Diligence //: 
The Right To Be Forgotten
The European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights, and Citi­
zenship, Viviane Reding, announced the European Commission’s pro­
posal to create a sweeping new privacy right—the right to be forgotten, 
allowing individuals to request to have all content that violates their pri­
vacy removed. The right to be forgotten addresses an urgent problem in 
the digital age: the great difficulty of escaping your past on the Internet 
now that every photo, status update, and tweet lives forever in the cloud. 
To comply with the European Court of Justice’s decision, Google created 
a new online form by which individuals can request search providers to 
remove links that violate their online privacy. In the first month, Google 
received more than 50,000 submissions from people asking the company 
to remove links. Many people in the United States believe that the right to 
be forgotten conflicts with the right to free speech. Do people who want 
to erase their past deserve a second chance? Do you agree or disagree?5
15 Million Identity Theft Victims
Identity theft has quickly become the most common, expensive, and 
­pervasive crime in the United States. The identities of more than 15 mil­
lion U.S. citizens are stolen each year, with financial losses exceeding 
$50 billion. This means that the identities of almost 10 percent of U.S. 
adults will be stolen this year, with losses of around $4,000 each, not 
to mention the 100 million U.S. citizens whose personal data will be 
compromised due to data breaches on corporate and government 
databases.
The growth of organized crime can be attributed to the massive 
amounts of data collection along with the increased cleverness of 
professional identity thieves. Starting with individually tailored phish­
ing and vishing scams, increasingly successful corporate and 
government databases hackings, and intricate networks of bot­
nets that hijack millions of computers without a trace, we must 
wake up to this ever-increasing threat to all Americans.6
You have the responsibility to protect yourself from data theft. In

large extent, this expectation is based on the false assumption 
that email privacy protection exists somehow analogous to that 
of U.S. first-class mail. Generally, the organization that owns 
the email system can operate the system as openly or as pri­
vately as it wishes. Surveys indicate that the majority of large 
firms regularly read and analyze employees’ email looking for 
confidential data leaks such as unannounced financial results or 
the sharing of trade secrets that result in the violation of an email 
privacy policy and eventual termination of the employee. That 
means that if the organization wants to read everyone’s email, it 
can do so. Basically, using work email for anything other than 
work is not a good idea. A typical email privacy policy:
	∙	 Defines legitimate email users and explains what happens to 
accounts after a person leaves the organization.
	∙	 Explains backup procedure so users will know that at some 
point, even if a message is deleted from their computer, it is 
still stored by the company.
	∙	 Describes the legitimate grounds for reading email and the pro­
cess required before such action is performed.
	∙	 Discourages sending junk email or spam to anyone who does 
not want to receive it.
regulation in the workplace a requirement. Cybervandalism is 
the electronic defacing of an existing website. ­Typosquatting 
is a problem that occurs when someone registers purposely mis­
spelled variations of well-known domain names. These vari­
ants sometimes lure consumers who make typographical errors 
when entering a URL. Website name stealing is the theft of 
a website’s name that occurs when someone, posing as a site’s 
administrator, changes the ownership of the domain name 
assigned to the website to another website owner. These are all 
examples of unacceptable Internet use. Internet ­censorship 
is government attempts to control Internet traffic, thus prevent­
ing some material from being viewed by a country’s citizens. 
Generally, an Internet use policy:
	∙	 Describes the Internet services available to users.
	∙	 Defines the organization’s position on the purpose of Internet 
access and what restrictions, if any, are placed on that access.
	∙	 Describes user responsibility for citing sources, properly han­
dling offensive material, and protecting the organization’s 
good name.
	∙	 States the ramifications if the policy is violated.
Email Privacy Policy
An email privacy policy details the 
extent to which email messages may 
be read by others. Email is so perva­
sive in organizations that it requires its 
own specific policy. Most working pro­
fessionals use email as their preferred 
means of corporate communications. 
While email and instant messaging are 
common business communication tools, 
there are risks associated with using 
them. For instance, a sent email is stored 
on at least three or four computers (see 
­Figure 4.5). Simply deleting an email 
from one computer does not delete it 
from the others. Companies can mitigate 
many of the risks of using electronic 
messaging systems by implementing 
and adhering to an email privacy policy.
One major problem with email is the 
user’s expectations of privacy. To a

took notice when disgusted customers began posting negative 
comments all over Twitter. Not having a Twitter account, cor­
porate executives at Domino’s did not know about the damag­
ing tweets until it was too late. The use of social media can 
contribute many benefits to an organization, and implemented 
correctly it can become a huge opportunity for employees to 
build brands. But there are also tremendous risks as a few 
employees representing an entire company can cause tremen­
dous brand damage. Defining a set of guidelines implemented 
in a social media policy can help mitigate that risk. Compa­
nies can protect themselves by implementing a social media 
policy outlining the corporate guidelines or principles govern­
ing employee online communications. Having a single social 
media policy might not be enough to ensure the company’s 
online reputation is protected. Additional, more specific, social 
media policies a company might choose to implement include:7
	∙	 Employee online communication policy detailing brand 
communication.
	∙	 Employee blog and personal blog policies.
	∙	 Employee social network and personal social network 
policies.
	∙	 Employee Twitter, corporate Twitter, and personal Twitter policies.
	∙	 Employee LinkedIn policy.
	∙	 Employee Facebook usage and brand usage policy.
	∙	 Corporate YouTube policy.
	∙	 Prohibits attempting to mail bomb a site. A mail bomb sends 
a massive amount of email to a specific person or system that 
can cause that user’s server to stop functioning.
	∙	 Informs users that the organization has no control over email 
once it has been transmitted outside the organization.
Spam is unsolicited email. It plagues employees at all levels 
within an organization, from receptionist to CEO, and clogs 
email systems and siphons MIS resources away from legiti­
mate business projects. An anti-spam policy simply states 
that email users will not send unsolicited emails (or spam). 
It is difficult to write anti-spam policies, laws, or software 
because there is no such thing as a universal litmus test for 
spam. One person’s spam is another person’s newsletter. End 
users have to decide what spam is, because it can vary widely 
not just from one company to the next, but from one person to 
the next. A user can opt out of receiving emails by choosing 
to deny permission to incoming emails. A user can opt in to 
receive emails by choosing to allow permissions to incoming 
emails. Teergrubing is an anti-spamming approach where the 
receiving computer launches a return attack against the spam­
mer, sending email messages back to the computer that origi­
nated the suspected spam.

Monitoring 
Employees
Every organization has the right to moni­
tor its employees. Organizations usu­
ally inform their employees when workplace 
monitoring is occurring, especially regarding 
organizational assets such as networks, email, 
and Internet access. Employees traditionally 
offer their consent to be monitored and should 
not have any expectations of privacy when using 
organizational assets.
Do you agree or disagree that organizations 
have an obligation to notify employees about 
the extent of workplace monitoring, such as 
how long employees are using the Internet and 
which websites they are visiting? Do you agree 
or disagree that organizations have the right to 
read all employees’ email sent or received on 
an organizational computer, including personal 
Gmail accounts?

100  MODULE 1  |  Business Driven MIS
Social media monitoring is the process of monitoring and 
responding to what is being said about a company, individual, 
product, or brand. Social media monitoring typically falls to 
the social media manager, a person within the organization 
who is trusted to monitor, contribute, filter, and guide the social 
media presence of a company, individual, product, or brand. 
Organizations must protect their online reputations and continu­
ously monitor blogs, message boards, social networking sites, 
and media sharing sites. However, monitoring the hundreds of 
social media sites can quickly become overwhelming. To com­
bat these issues, a number of companies specialize in online 
social media monitoring; for example, Trackur.com creates dig­
ital dashboards that allow executives to view at a glance the date 
published, source, title, and summary of every item tracked. 
The dashboard not only highlights what’s being said but also 
the influence of the particular person, blog, or social media site.
Workplace Monitoring Policy
Increasingly, employee monitoring is not a choice; it is a risk-
management obligation. Michael Soden, CEO of the Bank of 
Ireland, issued a mandate stating that company employees could 
not surf illicit websites with company equipment. Next, he hired 
Hewlett-Packard to run the MIS department and illicit websites 
were discovered on Soden’s own computer, forcing Soden to 
resign. Monitoring employees is one of the biggest challenges 
CIOs face when developing information management policies.8
Physical security is tangible protection such as alarms, 
guards, fireproof doors, fences, and vaults. New technologies 
make it possible for employers to monitor many aspects of their 
employees’ jobs, especially on telephones, computer termi­
nals, through electronic and voice mail, and when employees 
are using the Internet. Such monitoring is virtually unregulated. 
Therefore, unless company policy specifically states otherwise 
(and even this is not assured), your employer may listen, watch, 
and read most of your workplace communications. Workplace 
MIS monitoring tracks people’s activities by such measures 
as number of keystrokes, error rate, and number of transactions 
processed (see Figure 4.6 for an overview). The best path for an 
organization planning to engage in employee monitoring is open 
communication including an employee monitoring policy 
stating explicitly how, when, and where the company monitors 
its employees. Several common stipulations an organization can 
follow when creating an employee monitoring policy include:
	∙	 Be as specific as possible stating when and what (email, IM, 
Internet, network activity, etc.) will be monitored.
	∙	 Expressly communicate that the company reserves the right 
to monitor all employees.
	∙	 State the consequences of violating the policy.
	∙	 Always enforce the policy the same for everyone.
Many employees use their company’s high-speed Internet 
access to shop, browse, and surf the web. Most managers do

PROTECTING 
INTELLECTUAL 
ASSETS  LO4.3
To accurately reflect the crucial interdependence between MIS 
and business processes, we should update the old business 
axiom “Time is money” to say “Uptime is money.” Downtime 
refers to a period of time when a system is unavailable. Unplanned 
downtime can strike at any time for any number of reasons, from 
tornadoes to sink overflows to network failures to power outages 
(see Figure 4.7). Although natural disasters may appear to be 
the most devastating causes of MIS outages, they are hardly the 
most frequent or most expensive. Figure 4.8 demonstrates that 
the costs of downtime are not only associated with lost revenues, 
but also with financial performance, damage to reputations, and 
even travel or legal expenses. A few questions managers should 
ask when determining the cost of downtime are:10
	∙	 How many transactions can the company afford to lose with­
out significantly harming business?
	∙	 Does the company depend upon one or more mission-critical 
applications to conduct business?
	∙	 How much revenue will the company lose for every hour a 
critical application is unavailable?
	∙	 What is the productivity cost associated with each hour of 
downtime?
	∙	 How will collaborative business processes with partners, sup­
pliers, and customers be affected by an unexpected IT outage?
not want their employees conducting personal business during 
working hours, and they implement a Big Brother approach 
to employee monitoring. Many management gurus advocate 
that organizations whose corporate cultures are based on trust 
are more successful than those whose corporate cultures are 
based on mistrust. Before an organization implements monitor­
ing technology, it should ask itself, “What does this say about 
how we feel about our employees?” If the organization really 
does not trust its employees, then perhaps it should find new 
ones. If an organization does trust its employees, then it might 
want to treat them accordingly. An organization that follows its 
employees’ every keystroke might be unwittingly undermin­
ing the relationships with its employees, and it might find the 
effects of employee monitoring are often worse than lost pro­
ductivity from employee web surfing.

Corporations are starting to implement 
policies against smoking and obesity and 
are testing their employees for tobacco 
use and high-blood pressure. If the tests 
are positive, the employee can face 
fines or even dismissal. At Weyco Inc., 
four employees were fired for refusing 
to take a test to determine whether they 
smoke cigarettes. Weyco Inc. adopted a 
policy that mandates that employees who 
smoke will be fired, even if the smoking 
happens after business hours or at home. 
Howard Weyers, Weyco founder, believes 
the anti-smoking policies were designed 
to protect the firm from high health care 
costs. “I don’t want to pay for the results 
of smoking,” states Weyers.
Minority and pregnant women are 
protected by law from discrimination in 
the workplace. Unfortunately, if you have 
a few bad habits, you are on your own. 
How would you feel if you were fired 
because you were smoking on the week­
end? Do you agree that unhealthy habits 
warrant disciplinary actions? If companies 
are allowed to implement policies against 
smoking and obesity, what unhealthy 
habit might be next? To date, there have 
not been any policies on the consumption 
of alcohol outside of work. Do you agree 
that overeating and smoking are worse 
than a drinking habit?

Security Threats Caused 
by Hackers and Viruses
Hackers are experts in technology who use their knowledge to 
break into computers and computer networks, either for profit 
or just motivated by the challenge. Smoking is not just bad for 
a person’s health; it seems it is also bad for company secu­
rity as hackers regularly use smoking entrances to gain build­
ing access. Once inside they pose as employees from the MIS 
department and either ask for permission to use an employee’s 
computer to access the corporate network, or find a confer­
ence room where they simply plug-in their own laptop. Drive-
by hacking is a computer attack where an attacker accesses 
a wireless computer network, intercepts data, uses network 
services, and/or sends attack instructions without entering the 
office or organization that owns the network. Figure 4.9 lists 
the various types of hackers for organizations to be aware of, 
and Figure 4.10 shows how a virus is spread.
One of the most common forms of computer vulnerabilities is a 
virus. A virus is software written with malicious intent to cause 
annoyance or damage. Some hackers create and leave viruses 
causing massive computer damage. A worm spreads itself not

	∙	 Crackers have criminal intent when hacking.
	∙	 Cyberterrorists seek to cause harm to people or to destroy critical systems or information and use the Internet as a weapon of 
mass destruction.
	∙	 Hactivists have philosophical and political reasons for breaking into systems and will often deface the website as a protest.
	∙	 Script kiddies or script bunnies find hacking code on the Internet and click-and-point their way into systems to cause damage or

Two additional computer vulner­
abilities include adware and spy­
ware. Adware is software that, 
while purporting to serve some use­
ful function and often fulfilling that 
function, also allows Internet adver­
tisers to display advertisements 
without the consent of the computer 
user. Spyware is a special class of 
adware that collects data about the 
user and transmits it over the Inter­
net without the user’s knowledge 
or permission. Spyware programs 
collect specific data about the user, 
ranging from general demographics 
such as name, address, and browsing 
habits to credit card numbers, Social 
Security numbers, and user names 
and passwords. Not all adware pro­
grams are spyware and used cor­
rectly it can generate revenue for a 
company allowing users to receive 
free products. Spyware is a clear 
threat to privacy. ­Ransomware is 
a form of malicious software that 
infects your computer and asks 
for money. Simplelocker is a new 
ransomware program that 
encrypts your personal files and demands payment for 
the files’ decryption keys. ­Figure 4.12 displays a 
few additional weapons hackers use for launch­
ing attacks.11
Organizational information is intellectual capi­
tal. Just as organizations protect their tangible 
assets—keeping their money in an insured bank 
or providing a safe working environment for 
employees—they must also protect their intellec­
tual capital, everything from patents to transac­
tional and analytical information. With security breaches 
and viruses on the rise and computer hackers ­everywhere, an 
organization must put in place strong security measures to 
survive.
Backdoor programs open a way into the network for future attacks.
Denial-of-service attack (DoS) floods a website with so many requests for service that it slows down or crashes the site.
Distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) attacks from multiple computers that flood a website with so many requests for service that it slows down 
or crashes. A common type is the Ping of Death, in which thousands of computers try to access a website at the same time, overloading it and shutting it 
down.
Polymorphic viruses and worms change their form as they propagate.
Trojan-horse virus hides inside other software, usually as an attachment or a downloadable file.
Worm spreads itself, not only from file to file, but also from computer to computer. The primary difference between a virus and a worm is that a virus must 
attach to something, such as an executable file, to spread. Worms do not need to attach to anything to spread and can tunnel themselves into computers.
FIGURE 4 . 1 1  Common Forms of Viruses
Beyond Passwords
The password, a combination of a user name and personal code, 
has been the primary way to secure systems since computers first 
hit the market in the 1980s. Of course, in the 1980s, users had only 
one password to maintain and remember, and chances are they still 
probably had to write it down. Today, users have dozens of user 
names and passwords they have to remember to multiple systems 
and ­websites—it is simply no longer sustainable! A few companies 
are creating new forms of identification, hoping to eliminate the 
password problem.

Wave service.
	∙	 Illiri is developing an app that emits a unique sound on your 
smart phone that can be used to unlock other devices, process

write them on sticky notes next to their computers, leaving the 
door wide open for hackers. Through social engineering, 
hackers use their social skills to trick people into revealing 
access credentials or other valuable information. Dumpster 
diving, or looking through people’s trash, is another way hack­
ers obtain information. Pretexting is a form of social engi­
neering in which one individual lies to obtain confidential data 
about another individual.
Information security policies identify the rules required to 
maintain information security, such as requiring users to log 
off before leaving for lunch or meetings, never sharing pass­
words with anyone, and changing passwords every 30 days. An 
­information security plan details how an organization will 
implement the information security policies. The best way a 
company can safeguard itself from people is by implementing 
and communicating its information security plan. This becomes 
even more important with Web 2.0 and as the use of mobile 
devices, remote workforce, and contractors is growing. A few 
details managers should consider surrounding people and infor­
mation security policies include defining the best practices for:12
THE FIRST LINE OF 
DEFENSE–PEOPLE  LO4.4
Organizations today are able to mine valuable information such 
as the identity of the top 20 percent of their customers, who usu­
ally produce 80 percent of revenues. Most organizations view 
this type of information as intellectual capital and implement 
security measures to prevent it from walking out the door or 
falling into the wrong hands. At the same time, they must enable 
employees, customers, and partners to access needed informa­
tion electronically. Organizations address security risks through 
two lines of defense; the first is people, the second technology.
Surprisingly, the biggest problem is people as the majority 
of information security breaches result from people misusing 
organizational information. Insiders are legitimate users who 
purposely or accidentally misuse their access to the environ­
ment and cause some kind of business-affecting incident. For 
example, many individuals freely give up their passwords or 
Elevation of privilege is a process by which a user misleads a system into granting unauthorized rights, usually for the purpose of compromising or 
destroying the system. For example, an attacker might log onto a network by using a guest account and then exploit a weakness in the software that lets 
the attacker change the guest privileges to administrative privileges.
Hoaxes attack computer systems by transmitting a virus hoax, with a real virus attached. By masking the attack in a seemingly legitimate message, 
unsuspecting users more readily distribute the message and send the attack on to their co-workers and friends, infecting many users along the way.
Malicious code includes a variety of threats such as viruses, worms, and Trojan horses.
Packet tampering consists of altering the contents of packets as they travel over the Internet or altering data on computer disks after penetrating a 
network. For example, an attacker might place a tap on a network line to intercept packets as they leave the computer. The attacker could eavesdrop or 
alter the information as it leaves the network.
A sniffer is a program or device that can monitor data traveling over a network. Sniffers can show all the data being transmitted over a network, including 
passwords and sensitive information. Sniffers tend to be a favorite weapon in the hacker’s arsenal.
Spoofing is the forging of the return address on an email so that the message appears to come from someone other than the actual sender. This is not a 
virus but rather a way by which virus authors conceal their identities as they send out viruses.
Splogs (spam blogs) are fake blogs created solely to raise the search engine rank of affiliated websites. Even blogs that are legitimate are plagued by 
spam, with spammers taking advantage of the Comment feature of most blogs to comments with links to spam sites.
Spyware is software that comes hidden in free downloadable software and tracks online movements, mines the information stored on a computer, or uses 
a computer’s CPU and storage for some task the user knows nothing about.

Identity theft is the forging of someone’s identity for the 
purpose of fraud. The fraud is often financial, because thieves 
apply for and use credit cards or loans in the victim’s name. 
Two means of stealing an identity are phishing and pharming. 
Information secrecy is the category of computer security 
that addresses the protection of data from unauthorized disclo­
sure and confirmation of data source authenticity. Phishing 
is a technique to gain personal information for the purpose of 
identity theft, usually by means of fraudulent emails that look 
as though they came from legitimate businesses. The mes­
sages appear to be genuine, with official-looking formats and 
logos, and typically ask for verification of important infor­
mation such as passwords and account numbers, ostensibly 
for accounting or auditing purposes. Since the emails look

identity theft at least 13 times. The 
first theft occurred when someone 
used his identity to secure a $500 loan from a check-cashing company. 
Davis discovered the crime only after the company called his wife’s cell 
phone to recover the unpaid debt.13

information. A zombie is a program 
that secretly takes over another com­
puter for the purpose of launching 
attacks on other computers. Zom­
bie attacks are almost impossible to 
trace back to the attacker. A zom­
bie farm is a group of computers on 
which a hacker has planted zombie 
programs. A pharming attack uses 
a zombie farm, often by an organized 
crime association, to launch a mas­
sive phishing attack.
Authentication 
and 
authorization 
technologies can prevent identity 
theft, phishing, and pharming scams. 
Authentication is a method for 
confirming users’ identities. Once a 
system determines the authentication 
of a user, it can then determine the 
access privileges (or authorization) for that user. Authorization 
is the process of providing a user with permission including 
access levels and abilities such as file access, hours of access, 
and amount of allocated storage space. Authentication and 
authorization techniques fall into three categories; the most 
secure procedures combine all three:
	1.	 Something the user knows, such as a user ID and password.
	2.	 Something the user has, such as a smart card or token.
	3.	 Something that is part of the user, such as a fingerprint or 
voice signature.
Something the User Knows Such as a User 
ID and Password  A password is string of alphanu­
meric characters used to authenticate a user and provide access 
to a system. The first type of authentication, using something 
the user knows, is the most common way to identify individual 
users and typically consists of a unique user ID and password. 
However, this is actually one of the most ineffective ways for 
determining authentication because passwords are not secure. 
authentic, up to one in five recipients responds with the infor­
mation and subsequently becomes a victim of identity theft and 
other fraud. Figure 4.14 displays a phishing scam attempting 
to gain ­information for Skyline Bank; you should never click 
on emails asking you to verify your identity as companies will 
never contact you directly asking for your username or pass­
word.15 ­phishing  expedition is a masquerading attack that 
combines spam with spoofing. The perpetrator sends millions 
of spam emails that appear to be from a respectable company. 
The emails contain a link to a website that is designed to look 
exactly like the company’s website. The victim is encouraged to 
enter his or her username, password, and sometimes credit card 
information. Spear phishing is a phishing expedition in which 
the emails are carefully designed to target a particular person 
or organization. Vishing (or voice phishing) is a phone scam 
that attempts to defraud people by asking them to call a bogus 
telephone number to “confirm” their account information.
Pharming reroutes requests for legitimate websites to false 
websites. For example, if you were to type in the URL to your 
bank, pharming could redirect to a fake site that collects your

All it typically takes to crack one is enough time. More than 50 
percent of help-desk calls are password related, which can cost 
an organization significant money, and a social engineer can 
coax a password from almost anybody.
Something the User Has Such as a Smart 
Card or Token  The second type of authentication, using 
something the user has, offers a much more effective way to 
­identify individuals than a user ID and 
password. Tokens and smart cards are 
two of the primary forms of this type of 
authentication. Tokens are small elec­
tronic devices that change user pass­
words automatically. The user enters 
his or her user ID and token-displayed 
password to gain access to the network. 
A smart card is a device about the size 
of a credit card, containing embedded 
technologies that can store information 
and small amounts of software to per­
form some limited processing. Smart 
cards can act as identification instru­
ments, a form of digital cash, or a data 
storage device with the ability to store 
an entire medical record.
Something That Is Part of 
the User Such as a Finger­
print or Voice Signature  The 
third kind of authentication, something 
that is part of the user, is by far the 
best and most effective way to manage 
authentication. Biometrics (narrowly 
defined) is the identification of a user 
based on a physical characteristic, such 
as a fingerprint, iris, face, voice, or hand­
writing. A voiceprint is a set of measur­
able characteristics of a human voice that 
uniquely identifies an individual. These 
characteristics, which are based on the 
physical configuration of a speaker’s 
mouth and throat, can be expressed as 
a mathematical formula. Unfortunately, 
biometric authentication such as voice­
prints can be costly and intrusive.
Single-factor authentication is the traditional security pro­
cess, which requires a username and password. Two-factor 
authentication requires the user to provide two means of 
authentication, what the user knows (password) and what the user 
has (security token). Multifactor authentication requires more 
than two means of authentication such as what the user knows 
(password), what the user has (security token), and what the user 
is (biometric verification). The goal of multifactor authentication

Due Diligence //:
Doodling Passwords14
As our online world continues to 
explode, people are finding the num­
ber of usernames and passwords they 
need to remember growing exponen­
tially. For this reason, many users will 
assign the same password for every 
logon, 
choose 
easy-to-remember 
names and dates, or simply write 
down their passwords on sticky notes 
and attach them to their computers. 
Great for the person who needs to 
remember 72 different passwords, but 
not so great for system security.
Of course, the obvious answer is 
to deploy biometrics across the board, 
but once you start reviewing the costs 
associated with biometrics, you quickly 
realize that this is not feasible. What is 
coming to the rescue to help with the 
password nightmare we have created? The doodle. Background Draw-a-
Secret (BDAS) is a new program created by scientists at Newcastle Univer­
sity in England. BDAS begins by recording the number of strokes it takes a 
user to draw a doodle. When the user wants to gain access to the system, 
he simply redraws the doodle on a touchpad and it is matched against the 
stored prototype. If the doodle matches, the user is granted access. Doo­
dles are even described as being far more ­anonymous, therefore offering 
greater security, than biometrics.
You are probably thinking that 
you’ll end up right back in the same 
position having to remember all 72 of 
your password doodles.
The good news is that, with doodle 
passwords, you don’t have to remem­
ber a thing. The doodle password can 
be displayed to the user, and they 
simply have to redraw it since the 
system analyzes how the user draws 
or the user’s unique hand strokes, not 
the actual doodle (similar to handwrit­
ing recognition technologies).
If you were going to deploy doo­
dle passwords in your organization, 
what issues and concerns do you 
think might occur? Do you agree that 
doodles are easier to remember than 
text passwords? Do you agree that doodles offer the most effective way 
to manage authentication, even greater than biometrics? What types of 
unethical issues do you think you might encounter with doodle passwords?

is to make it difficult for an unauthorized person to gain access to 
a system because, if one security level is broken, the attacker will 
still have to break through additional levels.
Data: Prevention and Resistance
A privilege escalation is a network intrusion attack that takes 
advantage of programming errors or design flaws to grant the 
attacker elevated access to the network and its associated data 
and applications. There are two kinds of privilege escalation:
	∙	 Vertical privilege escalation Attackers grant themselves 
a higher access level such as administrator, allowing the 
attacker to perform illegal actions such as running unauthor­
ized code or deleting data.
	∙	 Horizontal privilege escalation Attackers grant them­
selves the same access levels they already have but assume 
the identity of another user. For example, someone gaining 
access to another person’s online banking account would 
constitute horizontal privilege escalation.
Prevention and resistance technologies stop intruders from 
accessing and reading data by means of content filtering, 
encryption, and firewalls. Time bombs are computer viruses 
that wait for a specific date before executing their instructions. 
Content filtering occurs when organizations use software that 
filters content, such as emails, to prevent the accidental or mali­
cious transmission of unauthorized information. Organizations 
can use content filtering technologies to filter email and pre­
vent emails containing sensitive information from transmitting, 
whether the transmission was malicious or accidental. It can 
also filter emails and prevent any suspicious files from trans­
mitting such as potential virus-infected files. Email content fil­
tering can also filter for spam, a form of unsolicited email.
Encryption scrambles information into an alternative form 
that requires a key or password to decrypt. If there were a secu­
rity breach and the stolen information were encrypted, the thief 
would be unable to read it. Encryption can switch the order of 
characters, replace characters with other characters, insert or 

110  MODULE 1  |  Business Driven MIS
remove characters, or use a mathematical formula to convert 
the information into a code. Companies that transmit sensi­
tive customer information over the Internet, such as credit card 
numbers, frequently use encryption. To decrypt information is 
to decode it and is the opposite of encrypt. ­Cryptography is 
the science that studies encryption, which is the hiding of mes­
sages so that only the sender and receiver can read them. The 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intro­
duced an advanced encryption standard (AES) designed to 
keep government information secure.
Some encryption technologies use multiple keys. Public key 
encryption (PKE) uses two keys: a public key that every­
one can have and a private key for only the recipient (see 
­Figure 4.15). The organization provides the public key to all 
customers, whether end consumers or other businesses, who 
use that key to encrypt their information and send it via the 
Internet. When it arrives at its destination, the organization uses 
the private key to unscramble it.
Public keys are becoming popular to use for authentication tech­
niques consisting of digital objects in which a trusted third party 
confirms correlation between the user and the public key. A 
certificate authority is a trusted third party, such as VeriSign, 
that validates user identities by means of digital certificates. A 
digital certificate is a data file that identifies individuals or 
organizations online and is comparable to a digital signature.
A firewall is hardware and/or software that guard a private net­
work by analyzing incoming and outgoing information for the 
correct markings. If they are missing, the firewall prevents the 
information from entering the network. Firewalls can 
even detect computers communicating with the Inter­
net without approval. As Figure 4.16 illustrates, 
organizations typically place a firewall between 
a server and the Internet. Think of a firewall as a 
gatekeeper that protects computer networks from 
intrusion by providing a filter and safe transfer 
points for access to and from the Internet and other 
networks. It screens all network traffic for proper 
passwords or other security codes and allows only 
authorized transmissions in and out of the network.

Hackers Love Phish, and I Don’t Mean the Band
Phishing is a technique used to gain personal information for the pur­
pose of identity theft, usually by means of fraudulent email. Phishers 
will pretend to be your favorite website or social networking friend to 
see if you will fall for the bait and send them your personal informa­
tion. In other words, the keys to your online identity kingdom. Review 
each of the following and see if you would end up as Phish bait.
	1.	 Which of the following are real websites and which are 
phishing scams?
		
a.  www.books-google.com
		
b.  www.amazom.com
		
c.  www.hotmail.com.profile.php.id.371233.cn
		
d.  www.gmaill.com
	2.	 True or False: HTTPS represents a fraudulent site and 
the S stands for Scam.
	3.	 Which of the following are the best ways to determine 
if a website is legitimate?

b.  Review the site to see if it has an information privacy 
policy
		
c.  Type in your username and the wrong password to 
see if the site accepts it

all computer systems are protected. The presence of 
an intruder can be detected by watching for suspi­
cious network events such as bad passwords, the 
removal of highly classified data files, or unauthor­
ized user attempts. Intrusion detection software 
(IDS) features full-time monitoring tools that search 
for patterns in network traffic to identify intruders. 
IDS protects against suspicious network traffic and 
attempts to access files and data. If a suspicious 
event or unauthorized traffic is identified, the IDS 
will generate an alarm and can even be customized 
to shut down a particularly sensitive part of a net­
work. After identifying an attack, an MIS depart­
ment can implement response ­tactics to mitigate the 
damage. Response tactics outline procedures such as 
how long a system under attack will remain plugged 
in and connected to the corporate network, when to 
shut down a compromised system, and how quickly 
a backup system will be up and running.
Guaranteeing the safety of organization information is achieved 
by implementing the two lines of defense: people and tech­
nology. To protect information through people, firms should 
develop information security policies and plans that provide 
employees with specific precautions they should take in creat­
ing, working with, and transmitting the organization’s informa­
tion assets. Technology-based lines of defense fall into three 
categories: authentication and authorization; prevention and 
resistance; and detection and response.

odule 2 concentrates on the technical foundations 
of MIS. The power of MIS comes from its ability 
to carry, house, and support information. And 
information is power to an organization. This module high­
lights this point and raises awareness of the significance of 
information to organizational success. Understanding how the 
MIS infrastructure supports business operations, how business 
professionals access and analyze information to make business 
decisions, and how wireless and mobile technologies can make 
information continuously and instantaneously available are impor­
tant for strategically managing any company, large or small. Thus, 
these are the primary learning outcomes of Module 2.
The module begins by reviewing the role of MIS in supporting 
business growth, operations, and performance. We quickly turn to 
the need for MIS to be sustainable given today’s focus on being 
“green,” and then dive into databases, data warehousing, network­
ing, and wireless technologies—all fundamental components of MIS 
infrastructures. A theme throughout the module is the need to lever­
age and yet safeguard the use of information as key to the survival 
of any company. Information must be protected from misuse and 
harm, especially with the continued use, development, and exploita­
tion of the Internet and the web. ■

116  MODULE 2  |  Technical Foundations of MIS
everyone needs to learn about MIS infrastructures. You never 
want to leave the critical task of backing up your data to your MIS 
department. You want to personally ensure that your information 
is not only backed up, but also safeguarded and recoverable. For 
these reasons, business professionals in the 21st century need 
to acquire a base-level appreciation of what MIS can and cannot 
do for their company. Understanding how MIS supports growth, 
operations, profitability, and most recently sustainability, is crucial 
whether one is new to the workforce or a seasoned Fortune 500 
employee. One of the primary goals of this chapter is to create a 
more level playing field between you as a business professional 
and the MIS specialists with whom you will work. After reading it 
you should have many of the skills you need to assist in analyzing 
current and even some future MIS infrastructures; in recommend­
ing needed changes in processes; and in evaluating alternatives 
that support a company’s growth, operations, and profits. ■
even changed the way companies operate. What is the foundation 
supporting all of these systems that enable business growth, oper­
ations, and profits? What supports the volume and complexity of 
today’s user and application requirements? What protects systems 
from failures and crashes? It is the MIS infrastructure, which 
includes the plans for how a firm will build, deploy, use, and share 
its data, processes, and MIS assets. A solid MIS infrastructure can 
reduce costs, improve productivity, optimize business operations, 
generate growth, and increase profitability.
Briefly defined, hardware consists of the physical devices 
associated with a computer system, and software is the set of 
instructions the hardware executes to carry out specific tasks. In 
today’s business environment, most hardware and software is 
run via a network. A network is a communications system cre­
ated by linking two or more devices and establishing a standard 
methodology in which they can communicate. As more compa­
nies need to share more information, the network takes on greater 
importance in the infrastructure. Most companies use a specific 
form of network infrastructure called a client and server network. 
A client is a computer designed to request information from a 
server. A server is a computer dedicated to providing informa­
tion in response to requests. A good way to understand this is 
when someone uses a web browser (this would be the client) to 
access a website (this would be a server that would respond with 
the web page being requested by the client). Anyone not familiar 
with the basics of hardware, software, or networks should review 
Appendix A, “Hardware and Software,” and Appendix B, “Net­
works and Telecommunications,” for more information.
In the physical world, a detailed blueprint would show how 
public utilities, such as water, electricity, and gas support the 
foundation of a building. MIS infrastructure is similar as it 
shows in detail how the hardware, software, and network con­
nectivity support the firm’s processes. Every company, regard­
less of size, relies on some form of MIS infrastructure, whether 
it is a few personal computers networked together sharing an 
Excel file or a large multinational company with thousands of 
employees interconnected around the world.
An MIS infrastructure is dynamic; it continually changes as 
the business needs change. Each time a new form of Internet-
enabled device, such as an iPhone or BlackBerry, is created 
and made available to the public, a firm’s MIS infrastructure 
must be revised to support the device. This moves beyond 
just innovations in hardware to include new types of software 
and network connectivity. An enterprise architect is a per­
son grounded in technology, fluent in business, and able to 
provide the important bridge between MIS and the business.

or external hard drive. Today’s managers must act responsibly 
to protect one of their most valued assets, information. To sup­
port continuous business operations, an information infrastruc­
ture provides three primary elements:
	∙	 Backup and recovery plan.
	∙	 Disaster recovery plan.
	∙	 Business continuity plan (see Figure 5.2).
LO5.2  Identify the three primary areas associated with an 
information MIS infrastructure.
Backup and Recovery Plan
Each year businesses lose time and money because of system 
crashes and failures. One way to minimize the damage of 
a system crash is to have a backup and recovery strategy in 
place. A backup is an exact copy of a system’s information. 
­Recovery is the ability to get a system up and running in 
the event of a system crash or failure that includes restoring 
the information backup. Many different types of backup and 
recovery media are available, including maintaining an iden­
tical replica or redundant of the storage server, external hard 
drives, thumb drives, and even DVDs. The primary differences 
between them are speed and cost.
Fault tolerance is the ability for a system to respond to unex­
pected failures or system crashes as the backup system imme­
diately and automatically takes over with no loss of service. 
For example, fault tolerance enables a business to support 
continuous business operations if there is a power failure or 
would it take you to recover all 
of that information? A few things 
you might lose include music, 
movies, 
emails, 
assignments, 
saved passwords, not to mention 
that all-important 40-page paper 
that took you more than a month 
to complete. If this sounds pain­
ful then you want to pay particular 
attention to this section and learn 
how to eliminate this pain.
An information MIS infrastructure 
identifies where and how impor­
tant information is maintained 
and secured. An information 
infrastructure supports day-to-day 
business operations and plans for 
emergencies such as power out­
ages, floods, earthquakes, mali­
cious attacks via the Internet, theft, 
and security breaches to name just 
a few. Managers must take every 
precaution to make sure their systems are operational and pro­
tected around the clock every day of the year. Losing a laptop 
or experiencing bad weather in one part of the country simply 
cannot take down systems required to operate core business 
processes. In the past, someone stealing company information 
would have to carry out boxes upon boxes of paper. Today, 
as data storage technologies grow in capabilities while shrink­
ing in size, a person can simply walk out the front door of the 
building with the company’s data files stored on a thumb drive

information, then it might require 
only weekly backups to exter­
nal hard drives or thumb drives. 
A company that backs up on a 
weekly basis is taking the risk 
that, if a system crash occurs, 
it could lose a week’s worth of 
work. If this risk is acceptable, a 
weekly backup strategy will work. 
If it is unacceptable, the company 
needs more frequent backup.
Disaster Recovery 
Plan
Disasters such as power outages, 
fires, floods, hurricanes, and 
even malicious activities such as 
hackers and viruses strike companies every day. Disasters can 
have the following effects on companies and their business 
operations.
flood. Fault tolerance is an expensive form of backup, and only 
mission-critical applications and operations use it. Failover, a 
specific type of fault tolerance, occurs when a redundant stor­
age server offers an exact replica of the real-time data, and if 
the primary server crashes, the users are automatically directed 
to the secondary server or backup server. This is a high-speed 
and high-cost method of backup and recovery. Failback occurs 
when the primary machine recovers and resumes operations, 
taking over from the secondary server.
Using DVDs or thumb drives to store your data offers a low-
speed and low-cost backup method. It is a good business 
practice to back up data at least once a week using a low-cost 
method. This will alleviate the pain of having your laptop sto­
len or your system crash as you will still have access to your 
data, and it will only be a few days old.
Deciding how often to back up information and what media to 
use is a critical decision. Companies should choose a backup 
and recovery strategy in line with their goals and operational 
needs. If the company deals with large volumes of critical 
information, it will require daily, perhaps hourly, backups to 
storage servers. If it relies on small amounts of noncritical

just lost your entire document. Well, 
there might be one thing that is worse. 
You submit your final paper, which is 
worth 50 percent of your grade, and 
then you head off to Florida for spring 
break. You return to find that you failed 
the course and you frantically check 
email to find out what happened. In 
your email is a message from your pro­
fessor informing you that your paper 
was corrupt and couldn’t be opened 
and that you had 24 hours to resend 
the file, which, of course, you missed 
because you were lying on the beach.
There is an entrepreneur in every 
bunch, and good business-people 
can take lemons and make lemon­
ade. One such savvy individual saw 
lemonade in the corrupted file issue 
and launched Corrupted-Files.com, which sells students (for only $3.95) 
intentionally corrupted files. Why would anyone want to purchase a cor­
rupted file? According to the website, the reasons are obvious.
“Step 1: After purchasing a file, rename the file, e.g., Mike_Final-
Paper. Step 2: Email the file to your professor along with your ‘here’s 
my assignment’ e-mail. Step 3: It will take your professor several hours 
if not days to notice your file is 
‘unfortunately’ corrupted. Use the 
time this website just bought you 
wisely and finish that paper!!! This 
download includes a 2, 5, 10, 20, 
30 and 40 page corrupted Word 
file. Use the appropriate file size to 
match each assignment. Who’s to 
say your 10-page paper didn’t get 
corrupted? Exactly! No one can! It’s 
the perfect excuse to buy yourself 
extra time and not hand in a garbage 
paper. Cheating is not the answer to 
procrastination!—Corrupted-Files.

When discussing service-oriented 
architectures, there are three primary 
components, services, interoperability, 
and loose coupling. What is the ser­
vice in Corrupted-Files.com? Does it 
matter if a student is using a Mac or 
a PC when submitting the corrupted 
file, and how does this relate to 
interoperability?
failover  A specific 
type of fault tolerance, 
occurs when a redundant 
storage server offers 
an exact replica of the 
real-time data, and 
if the primary server 
crashes the users are 
automatically directed to 
the secondary server or 
backup server.
failback  Occurs when 
the primary machine 
recovers and resumes 
operations, taking over 
from the secondary 
server.

need to have backups and their corresponding frequency and 
methods along with the strategic location of the storage in a 
separate physical site that is geographically dispersed. A com­
pany might strategically maintain operations in New York 
and San Francisco, ensuring that a natural disaster would not 
impact both locations. A disaster recovery plan also fore­
sees the possibility that not only the computer equipment but 
also the building where employees work may be destroyed. 
A hot site is a separate and fully equipped facility where the 
company can move immediately after a disaster and resume 
business. A cold site is a separate facility that does not have 
any computer equipment but is a place where employees can 
move after a disaster. A warm site is a separate facility with 
computer equipment that requires installation and configura­
tion. Figure 5.3 outlines these resources that support disaster 
recovery.
A disaster recovery plan usually has a disaster recovery cost 
curve to support it. A disaster recovery cost curve charts 
(1) the cost to the company of the unavailability of information 
and technology and (2) the cost to the company of recovering 
from a disaster over time. Figure 5.4 displays a disaster recov­
ery cost curve and shows that the best recovery plan in terms 
of cost and time is where the two lines intersect. Creating such 
a curve is no small task. Managers must consider the cost of 
losing information and technology within each department or 
functional area, and across the whole company. During the 
first few hours of a disaster, those costs may be low, but they 
rise over time. With those costs in hand, a company must then 
determine the costs of recovery. Figure 5.5 displays Tech­
Target’s disaster recovery strategies for business.
	∙	 Disrupting communications: Most companies depend on 
voice and data communications for daily operational needs. 
Widespread communications outages, from either direct dam­
age to the infrastructure or sudden spikes in usage related to 
an outside disaster, can be as devastating to some firms as 
shutting down the whole business.
	∙	 Damaging physical infrastructures: Fire and flood can 
directly damage buildings, equipment, and systems, making 
structures unsafe and systems unusable. Law enforcement 
officers and firefighters may prohibit business professionals 
from entering a building, thereby restricting access to retrieve 
documents or equipment.
	∙	 Halting transportation: Disasters such as floods and hurri­
canes can have a deep effect on transportation. Disruption 
to major highways, roads, bridges, railroads, and airports can 
prevent business professionals from reporting to work or 
going home, slow the delivery of supplies, and stop the ship­
ment of products.
	∙	 Blocking utilities: Public utilities, such as the supply of elec­
tric power, water, and natural gas, can be interrupted for 
hours or days even in incidents that cause no direct damage 
to the physical infrastructure. Buildings are often uninhabit­
able and systems unable to function without public utilities.
These effects can devastate companies by causing them 
to cease operations for hours, days, or longer and risk los­
ing customers whom they cannot then supply. Therefore, 
to combat these disasters a company can create a disaster 
recovery plan, which is a detailed process for recovering 
information or a system in the event of a catastrophic disas­
ter. This plan includes such factors as which files and systems

Business Continuity 
Plan
An emergency is a sudden, unex­
pected event requiring immedi­
ate action due to potential threat to 
health and safety, the environment, 
or property. Emergency prepared­
ness ensures a company is ready to 
respond to an emergency in an orga­
nized, timely, and effective man­
ner. Natural disasters and terrorist 
attacks are on the minds of business 
professionals who take safeguarding 
their information assets seriously. 
Disaster recovery plans typically 
focus on systems and data, ignoring 
cross-functional and intraorganiza­
tional business processes that can 
be destroyed during an emergency. 
For this reason many companies are 
turning to a more comprehensive 
and all-­encompassing 
emergency prepared­
ness plan known as 
business continuity planning (BCP), which details 
how a company recovers and restores critical business 
operations and systems after a disaster or extended 
disruption. BCP includes such factors as identifying 
critical systems, business processes, departments, 
and the maximum amount of time the business can 
continue to operate without functioning systems (see 
Figure 5.6). BCP contains disaster recovery plans 
along with many additional plans, including prioritiz­
ing business impact analysis, emergency notification 
plans, and technology recovery strategies.
On April 18, 1906, San Francisco was rocked by an earthquake 
that destroyed large sections of the city and claimed the lives of 
more than 3,000 inhabitants. More than a century later, a rebuilt 
and more durable San Francisco serves as a central location 
for major MIS corporations as well as a major world financial 
center. Managers of these corporations are well aware of the 
potential disasters that exist along the San Andreas Fault and 
actively update their business continuity plans anticipating such 
issues as earthquakes and floods. The Union Bank of California 
is located in the heart of downtown San Francisco and main­
tains a highly detailed and well-developed business continuity 
plan. The company employs hundreds of business professionals 
scattered around the world that coordinate plans for address­
ing the potential loss of a facility, business professionals, or 
critical systems so that the company can continue to operate if 
a disaster happens. Its disaster recovery plan includes hot sites 
where staff can walk in and start working exactly as if they were 
in their normal location. It would be a matter of minutes, not 
hours, for the Union Bank of California to be up and running 
again in the event of a disaster.3

DISASTER RECOVERY STRATEGIES
1. Activate backup and recovery facilities in secondary company data 
center; transfer production to that site
Assumes the secondary data center has sufficient resources, e.g., 
storage capacity, server hardware to accommodate additional processing 
requirements
2. Activate recovery resources in a cloud-based service; failover critical 
systems to that site and resume operations
Ensure that your contract for this service has the ability to flex as your 
needs dictate; ensure that security of your data can be maintained
3. Activate backup systems and data at a hot site; transfer operations to 
that site
Be sure you know what resources you have available at the hot site, what 
the declaration rules and fees are, and what your options are if multiple 
declarations are occurring at the same time
4. Replace damaged equipment with spare components
As much as possible, have available spare systems, circuit boards, and 
power supplies; backup disks with system software; and hard and soft 
copies of critical documentation
5. Recover virtual machines at an alternate site; assumes VMs have been 
updated to be current with production VMs
Create VM clones at an alternate site, keep them updated, and if needed 
they can quickly become production VMs
6. Activate alternate network routes and re-route data and voice traffic 
away from the failed network service
Ensure that network infrastructures have diverse routing of local access 
channels as well as diverse routing of high-capacity circuits 2

122  MODULE 2  |  Technical Foundations of MIS
Business Impact Analysis 
A business impact analysis iden­
tifies all critical business functions 
and the effect that a specific disaster 
may have upon them. A business 
impact analysis is primarily used 
to ensure a company has made the 
right decisions about the order of 
recovery priorities and strategies. 
For example, should the account­
ing department have its systems up 
and running before the sales and 
marketing departments? Will email 
be the first system for recovery to ensure employees can com­
municate with each other and outside stakeholders such as 
customers, suppliers, and partners? The business impact 
analysis is a key part of BCP as it details the order 
in which functional areas should be restored, 
ensuring the most critical are focused on first.
Emergency Notification Services 
A business continuity plan typically includes 
an emergency notification service, that is, 
an infrastructure built for notifying people in the 
event of an emergency. Radio stations’ occa­
sional tests of the national Emergency Alert 
System are an example of a very large-scale emergency noti­
fication system. A firm will implement an emergency notifi­
cation service to warn employees of unexpected events and 
provide them with instructions about how to handle the situa­
tion. Emergency notification services can be deployed through 
the firm’s own infrastructure, supplied by an outside service 
provider on company premises, or hosted remotely by an out­
side service provider. All three methods provide notification 
using a variety of methods such as email, voice notification to a 
cell phone, and text messaging. The notifications can be sent to 
all the devices selected, providing multiple means in which to 
get critical information to those who need it.
Recovering from Disaster
Backup and recovery are essential for any computer system. How 
painful would it be if someone stole your laptop right now? How 
much critical information would you lose? How many hours would 
it take you to re-create your data? Perhaps that will motivate you to 
implement a backup procedure. How many of you have a disaster 
recovery plan? Disaster recovery is needed when your best friend 
dumps a grande latte on your computer or you accidentally wash 
your thumb drive.
Disaster recovery plans are crucial for any business, and you 
should ensure that your company has everything it needs to con­
tinue operations if there is ever a disaster, such as 9/11. You need 
to decide which disasters are worth worrying about and which 
ones probably will never occur. For example, if you live in Colo­
rado, chances are good you don’t have to worry about hurricanes, 
but avalanches are another story.
How often does a company need to back up its data? Where 
should the backup be stored? What types of disasters should com­
panies in your state prepare for in case of an emergency? Why is it 
important to test the backup? What could happen to a company if it 
failed to create a disaster recovery plan?
BUSINESS CONTINUITY STRATEGIES
1. Evacuate existing building and relocate to a prearranged 
alternate work area
Assumes the alternate site is ready for occupancy, or can be made ready quickly, based on 
recovery time objectives; ensure that transportation is available
2. Work from home
Ensure that staff have broadband and Internet access at home; ensure that there are 
sufficient network access points to accommodate the increase in usage
3. Move selected staff to a hot site.
Assumes a hot site program is in place and that space is available at the site for staff
4. Move alternate staff into leadership roles in the absence 
of key leaders; ensure that they have been cross-trained
Succession planning is a key strategy in business continuity; it ensures that loss of a senior 
manager or someone with special expertise can be replaced with minimal disruption to the 
business
5. Move staff into local or nearby hotels and set up 
temporary work space
Make sure this kind of arrangement is set up with hotels in advance, especially in case of an 
incident that disrupts many other businesses in the same area
6. Relocate staff to another company office
Organizations with multiple offices that have access to the company network as well as 
work space can be leveraged to temporarily house employees 4

of these four vital components is not functioning, the entire sys­
tem will be unavailable, shutting down cross-functional business

Backup and recovery are essential for any computer system. Hopefully, most 
of you have a backup of your data. If you have not, let me ask you a ques­
tion: How painful would it be if some­
one stole your laptop right now? How 
much critical information would you 
lose? How many hours would it take 
you to re-create your data? Perhaps 
that will motivate you to implement a 
backup procedure. Now, how many 
of you have a disaster recovery plan? 
I’d be surprised if any of you have 
disaster recovery plans for your per­
sonal computers. Disaster recovery 
occurs when your best friend decides 
to dump a grande latte on your com­
puter or your roommate accidentally 
washes your thumb drive.
Disaster recovery plans are cru­
cial for any business, and you should 
ensure that your company has everything it needs to continue operations if 
there is ever a disaster, such as 9/11. Now, you need to decide which disas­
ters are worth worrying about and which ones are probably never going 
to occur. For example, if you live in Colorado, chances are good you don’t 
have to worry about hurricanes, but avalanches are another story. There 
are a few companies that take disaster recovery too far, such as the Uni­
versity of Florida that lists the disaster recovery plans for a zombie apoc­
alypse on its disaster recovery website. Yes, you read that correctly. The 
zombie apocalypse disaster recov­
ery exercise details how the school 
could respond to an outbreak of the 
undead, along with plans for deal­
ing with hurricanes and pandemics. I 
guess you can never be too prepared 
to deal with the unexpected!
How often does a company 
need to back up its data? Where 
should the backup be stored? What 
types of disasters should companies 
in your state prepare for in case of 
an emergency? Why is it important 
to test the backup? What could hap­
pen to a company if it failed to back 
up its data and applications?

Accessibility
Accessibility refers to the varying levels that define what a user 
can access, view, or perform when operating a system. Imagine 
the people at your college accessing the main student information 
system. Each person that accesses the system will have different 
needs and requirements; for example, a payroll employee will 
need to access vacation information and salary information, or a 
student will need to access course information and billing infor­
mation. Each system user is provided with an access level that 
details which parts of the system the user can and cannot access 
and what the user can do when in the system. For example, you 
would not want your students to be able to view payroll infor­
mation or professor’s personal information; also, some users can 
only view information and are not allowed to create or delete 
information. Top-level MIS employees require administrator 
access, or unrestricted access to the entire system. Administra­
tor access can perform functions such as resetting passwords, 
deleting accounts, and shutting down entire systems.
Tim Berners-Lee, W3C director and inventor of the World Wide 
Web, stated, “the power of the web is in its ­universality. Access 
by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.” Web 
accessibility means that people with disabilities, including 
visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and ­neurological

CHANGE: AGILE MIS 
INFRASTRUCTURE  LO5.3
Agile MIS infrastructure includes the hardware, software, and 
telecommunications equipment that, when combined, pro­
vides the underlying foundation to support the organization’s 
goals. If a company grows by 50 percent in a single year, its 
infrastructure and systems must be able to handle a 50 percent 
growth rate. If they cannot, they can severely hinder the com­
pany’s ability not only to grow but also to function.
The future of a company depends on its ability to meet its part­
ners, suppliers, and customers any time of the day in any geo­
graphic location. Imagine owning an ebusiness and everyone on 
the Internet is tweeting and collaborating about how great your 
business idea is and how successful your company is going to 
be. Suddenly, you have 5 million global customers interested in 
your website. Unfortunately, you did not anticipate this many 
customers so quickly, and the system crashes. Users typing in 
your URL find a blank message stating the website is unavail­
able and to try back soon. Or even worse, they can get to your 
website but it takes three minutes to reload each time they click 
on a button. The buzz soon dies about your business idea as 
some innovative web-savvy fast follower quickly copies your 
idea and creates a website that can handle the massive number 
of customers. The characteristics of agile MIS infrastructures 
can help ensure your systems can meet and perform under any 
Creating A BCP 
Plan
Business disruption costs money. In the 
event of a disaster or emergency, you will 
not only lose revenue, you will also incur addi­
tional expenses. If you are expecting your insur­
ance to cover your losses, be careful—there are 
many losses your insurance will not cover such 
as lost sales, lost business intelligence, and lost 
customers. To mitigate the risks of a catastro­
phe, you will want to create a detailed business 
continuity plan. A business continuity plan (BCP) 
is not only a good idea but also one of the least 
expensive plans a company can develop. A BCP 
will detail how employees will contact each 
other and continue to keep operations function­
ing in the event of a disaster or emergency such 
as a fire or flood. Regrettably, many companies 
never take the time to develop such a plan until 
it is too late.
Research the web for sample BCP plans 
for a small business or a start-up. In a group, 
create a BCP for a start-up of your choice. Be 
sure to think of such things as data storage, 
data access, transaction processing, employee 
safety, and customer communications.

CHAPTER 5  |  Infrastructures: Sustainable Technologies  125
Sometimes systems must be taken 
down for maintenance, upgrades, 
and fixes, which are completed 
during downtime. One challenge 
with availability is determining 
when to schedule system down­
time if the system is expected to 
operate continuously. Performing 
maintenance during the evening 
might seem like a great idea, but 
evening in one city is morning 
somewhere else in the world, and 
business professionals scattered 
around the globe may not be able 
to perform specific job functions if 
the systems they need are unavailable. This is where companies 
deploy failover systems so they can take the primary system 
down for maintenance and activate the secondary system to 
ensure continuous operations.
Maintainability
Companies must watch today’s needs, as well as tomorrow’s, 
when designing and building systems that support agile infra­
structures. Systems must be flexible enough to meet all types 
of company changes, environmental changes, and business 
disabilities, can use the web. The web accessibility 
initiative (WAI) brings together people from industry, 
­disability organizations, government, and research labs from 
around the world to develop guidelines and resources to help 
make the web accessible to people with disabilities, including 
auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual 
disabilities. The goal of WAI is to allow people to access the 
full potential of the web, enabling people with disabilities to 
participate equally. For example, Apple includes screen mag­
nification and VoiceOver on its iPhone, iPad, and iPod, which 
allows the blind and visually impaired to use the devices.
Availability
In a 24/7/365 ebusiness environment, business professionals 
need to use their systems whenever they want from wherever 
they want. Availability refers to the time frames when the 
system is operational. A system is called unavailable when 
it is not operating and cannot be used. High availability 
occurs when a system is continuously operational at all times. 
Availability is typically measured relative to “100 percent 
operational” or “never failing.” A widely held but difficult-
to-achieve standard of availability for a system is known as 
“five 9s” (99.999 percent) availability. Some companies have 
systems available around the clock to support ebusiness opera­
tions, global customers, and online suppliers.

of rogue users inaccurately updating information. Many users 
skip over Google search findings that correlate to Wikipedia for 
this reason. Housing unreliable information on a website can 
put a company at risk of losing customers, placing inaccurate 
supplier orders, or even making unreliable business decisions. 
A  vulnerability is a system weakness, such as a password 
that  is  never changed or a system left on while an employee 
goes to lunch, that can be exploited by a threat. Reliable systems 
ensure that vulnerabilities are kept at a minimum to reduce risk.
changes. Maintainability (or flexibility) refers to how quickly 
a system can transform to support environmental changes. 
Maintainability helps to measure how quickly and effectively a 
system can be changed or repaired after a failure. For example, 
when starting a small business you might not consider that you 
will have global customers, a common mistake. When building 
your systems, you might not design them to handle multiple 
currencies and different languages, which might make sense if 
the company is not currently performing international business. 
Unfortunately, when the first international order arrives, which 
happens easily with ebusiness, the system will be unable to 
handle the request because it does not have the flexibility to be 
easily reconfigured for a new language or currency. When the 
company does start growing and operating overseas, the system 
will need to be redeveloped, which is not an easy or cheap task, 
to handle multiple currencies and different languages.
Building and deploying flexible systems allow easy updates, 
changes, and reconfigurations for unexpected business or envi­
ronmental changes. Just think what might have happened if 
Facebook had to overhaul its entire system to handle multiple 
languages. Another social networking business could easily 
have stepped in and become the provider of choice. That cer­
tainly would not be efficient or effective for business operations.
Portability
Portability refers to the ability of an application to operate on 
different devices or software platforms, such as differ­
ent operating systems. Apple’s iTunes is readily avail­
able to users of Mac computers and also users of 
PC computers, smartphones, iPods, iPhones, 
iPads, and so on. It is also a portable applica­
tion. Because Apple insists on compatibility 
across its products, both software and hardware, 
Apple can easily add to its product, device, and 
service offerings without sacrificing portabil­
ity. Many software developers are creating pro­
grams that are portable to all three devices—the 
iPhone, iPod, and iPad—which increases their 
target market and, they hope, their revenue.
Reliability
Reliability (or accuracy) ensures a system is functioning cor­
rectly and providing accurate information. Inaccuracy can occur 
for many reasons, from the incorrect entry of information to the 
corruption of information during transmissions. Many argue that 
the information contained in Wikipedia is unreliable. Because the 
Wikipedia entries can be edited by any user, there are examples 
maintainability (or 
flexibility)  Refers to how 
quickly a system can transform to 
support environmental changes.
portability  Refers to the 
ability of an application to operate 
on different devices or software 
platforms, such as different 
operating systems.
reliability (or 
accuracy)  Ensures a system is 
functioning correctly and providing 
accurate information.
vulnerability  A system 
weakness that can be exploited by 
a threat; for example, a password 
that is never changed or a system 
left on while an employee goes 
to lunch.
Ranking the -ilities
Agile MIS infrastructure includes the hardware, software, and tele­
communications equipment that, when combined, provide the 
underlying foundation to support the organization’s goals. As an 
organization changes, its systems must be able to change to sup­
port its operations. If an organization grows by 50 percent in a single 
year, its systems must be able to handle a 50 percent growth rate. 
Systems that cannot adapt to organizational changes can severely 
hinder the organization’s ability to operate. The future of an organiza­
tion depends on its ability to meet its partners and customers on their 
terms, at their pace, any time of the day, in any geographic location.
Evaluate the agile MIS infrastructure for your school. Review the list 
of agile MIS infrastructure characteristics and rank them in order of 
their impact on your school’s success. Use a rating system of 1 to 7, 
where 1 indicates the biggest impact and 7 indicates the least impact.

CHAPTER 5  |  Infrastructures: Sustainable Technologies  127
Web 2.0 is a big driver for capacity planning to ensure agile 
infrastructures can meet the business’s operational needs. 
Delivering videos over the Internet requires enough bandwidth 
to satisfy millions of users during peak periods such as Friday 
and Saturday evenings. Video transmissions over the Internet 
cannot tolerate packet loss (blocks of data loss), and allow­
ing one additional user to access the system could degrade the 
video quality for every user.
Usability
Usability is the degree to which a system is easy to learn and 
efficient and satisfying to use. Providing hints, tips, shortcuts, 
and instructions for any system, regardless of its ease of use, 
is recommended. Apple understood the importance of usabil­
ity when it designed the first iPod. One of the iPod’s initial 
attractions was the usability of the click wheel. One simple and 
efficient button operates the iPod, making it usable for all ages. 
And to ensure ease of use, Apple also made the correspond­
ing iTunes software intuitive and easy to use. ­Serviceability 
is how quickly a third party can change a system to ensure 
it meets user needs and the terms of any contracts, includ­
ing agreed levels of reliability, maintainability, or availabil­
ity. When using a system from a third party, it is important to 
ensure the right level of serviceability for all users, including 
remote employees.
Scalability
Estimating company growth is a challenging task, in part 
because growth can occur in a number of different forms—the 
firm can acquire new customers, new product lines, or new mar­
kets. Scalability describes how well a system can scale up, or 
adapt to the increased demands of growth. If a company grows 
faster than anticipated, it might experience a variety of prob­
lems, from running out of storage space to taking more time to 
complete transactions. Anticipating expected, and unexpected, 
growth is key to building scalable systems that can support that 
development.
Performance measures how quickly a system performs a pro­
cess or transaction. Performance is a key component of scal­
ability as systems that can’t scale suffer from performance 
issues. Just imagine your college’s content management system 
suddenly taking five minutes to return a page after a button is 
pushed. Now imagine if this occurs during your midterm exam 
and you miss the two-hour deadline because the system is so 
slow. Performance issues experienced by firms can have disas­
trous business impacts causing loss of customers, loss of sup­
pliers, and even loss of help-desk employees. Most users will 
wait only a few seconds for a website to return a request before 
growing frustrated and either calling the support desk or giving 
up and moving on to another website.
Capacity represents the maximum throughput a system can 
deliver; for example, the capacity of a hard drive represents its 
size or volume. Capacity planning determines future envi­
ronmental infrastructure requirements to ensure high-quality 
system performance. If a company purchases connectivity soft­
ware that is outdated or too slow to meet demand, its employees 
will waste a great deal of time waiting for systems to respond to 
user requests. It is cheaper for a company to design and imple­
ment agile infrastructure that envisions growth requirements 
than to update all the equipment after the system is already 
operational. If a company with 100 workers merges with 
another company and suddenly there are 400 people using the 
system, performance time could suffer. Planning for increases 
in capacity can ensure systems perform as expected. Waiting 
for a system to respond to requests is not productive.

MIS refers to the environmental impact of computing as a 
whole, clean computing is specifically focused on the produc­
tion of environmental waste. A green personal computer 
(green PC) is built using environment-friendly materials and 
designed to save energy. Building sustainable MIS infrastruc­
tures is a core initiative and critical success factor for socially 
responsible corporations. Figure 5.9 ­displays the three primary

and faster, allowing more people from all income levels to pur­

MIS AND THE 
ENVIRONMENT  LO5.4
The general trend in MIS is toward smaller, faster, and cheaper 
devices. Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, the world’s larg­
est producer of computer chips or microprocessors, observed 
in 1965 that continued advances in technological innovation 
made it possible to reduce the size of a computer chip (the 
brains of a computer, or even a cell phone now) while dou­
bling its capacity every two years. His prediction that this trend 
would continue has come to be known as Moore’s Law, which 
refers to the computer chip performance per dollar doubles 
every 18 months. Although Moore originally assumed a two-
year period, many sources today refer to the 18-month figure.
Moore’s Law is great for many companies because they can 
acquire large amounts of MIS equipment for cheaper and 
cheaper costs. As ebusinesses continue to grow, compa­
nies equip their employees with multiple forms of electronic 
devices ranging from laptops to cell phones to iPads. This is 
great for supporting a connected corporation, but significant 
unintended side effects include our dependence on fossil fuels 
and  increased need for safe disposal of outdated computing 
equipment. Concern about these side effects has led many 
companies to turn to an ecological practice known as sustain­
able MIS. Sustainable, or green, MIS describes the produc­
tion, management, use, and disposal of technology in a way 
that minimizes damage to the environment. Sustainable MIS 
is a critical part of corporate social responsibility, that is, 
companies’ acknowledged responsibility to society. Clean 
computing, a subset of sustainable MIS, refers to the environ­
mentally responsible use, manufacture, and disposal of technol­
ogy products and computer equipment. Although sustainable

different devices allowing users to connect and compute around the 
globe. Moore’s Law has been accurate about computing power roughly

Solving The Ewaste 
Problem
The United States disposes of more 
than 384 million units of ewaste 
yearly and currently recycles less 
than 20 percent, according to 
the Electronics TakeBack Coali­
tion. The remaining 80  percent 
is burned or dumped in landfills, 
leaking toxic substances such as 
mercury, lead, cadmium, arsenic, 
and beryllium into the environ­
ment. Reports predict that ewaste 
will weigh as much as 200 Empire 
State Buildings by 2017. Solving 
the Ewaste Problem (StEP) Initia­
tive is a group represented by the 
Living the
United Nations organizations, governments, and 
science organizations, and their mission is to 
ensure safe and responsible ewaste disposal. 
StEP predicts ewaste will grow by a third in the 
next five years with the United States and China 
being the biggest contributors. Until recently, 
comprehensive data on global ewaste has been 
hard to collect because the definition of ewaste 
differs among countries. For example, the 
United States only includes consumer electron­
ics such as TVs and computers, 
whereas Europe includes every­
thing that has a battery or power 
cord in the ewaste category.6
The growth of ewaste is an 
opportunity for entrepreneurs. 
Research the web and find exam­
ples of schools around the country 
that are responsibly tackling the 
ewaste problem. In a group, cre­
ate a plan for implementing an 
ewaste recycling program at your 
school.

Ewaste and the 
Environment
By some estimates, there may be as 
many as 1 billion surplus or obsolete 
computers and monitors in the world. Consider 
California, where 6,000 computers become sur­
plus every day. If not disposed of properly, this 
enormous ewaste stream, which can contain 
more than 1,000 toxic substances, is harmful to 
human beings and the environment. Beryllium 
is found in computer motherboards, chromium 
in floppy disks, lead in batteries and computer 
monitors, and mercury in alkaline batteries. One 
of the most toxic chemicals known is cadmium, 
found in many old laptops and computer chips.
In poorer countries, where the United States 
and Europe export some of their ewaste, the full 
impact of the environmental damage is quickly 
being realized. These areas have little use for obso­
lete electronic equipment so local recyclers resell 
some parts and burn the rest in illegal dumps, often 
near residential areas, releasing toxic and carcino­
genic substances into the air, land, and water.9
Have you ever participated in ewaste? What 
can you do to ensure that you are safely dispos­
ing of electronic equipment including batteries? 
What can governments do to encourage compa­
nies to dispose of ewaste safely? What can be 
done to protect poorer countries from receiving 
ewaste? Create a list of the ways you can safely 
dispose of cell phones, computers, printers, ink 
cartridges, MP3 players, and batteries. What 
could you do to inform citizens of the issues 
associated with ewaste and educate them on 
safe disposal practices?
numerous environmental issues. Ewaste refers to discarded, obso­
lete, or broken electronic devices. Ewaste includes CDs, DVDs, 
thumb drives, printer cartridges, cell phones, iPods, external hard 
drives, TVs, VCRs, DVD players, microwaves, and so on. Some 
say one human year is equivalent to seven years of technologi­
cal advancements. A personal computer has a life expectancy of 
only three to five years and a cell phone is less than two years. An 
upcycle reuses or refurbishes ewaste and creates a new product.
Sustainable MIS disposal refers to the safe disposal of MIS 
assets at the end of their life cycle. It ensures that ewaste does 
not end up in landfills causing environmental issues. A single 
computer contains more than 700 chemicals; some are toxic, 
such as mercury, lead, and cadmium. If a computer ends up in a 
landfill, the toxic substances it contains can leach into our land, 
water, and air. Recycling costs from $15 to $50 for a monitor 
or computer. Many companies, including public schools and 
universities, simply can’t afford the recycling costs.7
Ewaste also occurs when unused equipment stored in attics, 
basements, and storage facilities never reaches a recycling cen­
ter. Retrieving the silver, gold, and other valuable metals from 
these devices is more efficient and less environmentally harm­
ful than removing it from its natural environment.
Currently, less than 20 percent of ewaste in the United States 
is recycled; however, even recycling does not guarantee the

Smart cities are being created around the globe 
with the use of advanced technology coupled 
with strong government. Smart cities use mobility, 
construction, energy, transportation, and the lat­
est green technology in new and innovative ways 
to help the environment. A few examples include:
	∙	 San Francisco’s California Academy of Sci­
ences building sports a living roof and is 
one of the most sustainable structures in the 
world. Its 2.5-acre “living roof” features local 
plants and a glass canopy of photovoltaic 
cells that produces energy for the building.

puter networks to monitor traffic during peak 
periods.
	∙	 Shanghai boasts the world’s first low-­
pollution magnetic railway that transports 
passengers at more than 100 mph.
	∙	 Massachusetts plans to install 300 wind

and India, where environmental enforcement is weak. This 
action poses its own global environmental problems.
Increased Energy Consumption
Energy consumption is the amount of energy consumed by 
business processes and systems. Huge increases in technology 
use have greatly amplified energy consumption. The energy 
consumed by a computer is estimated to produce as much as 
10 percent of the amount of carbon dioxide produced by an 
automobile. Computer servers in the United States account for 
about 1 percent of the total energy needs of the country. Put in 
perspective, this is roughly equivalent to the energy consump­
tion of Mississippi.
Computers consume energy even when they are not being 
used. For convenience and to allow for automatic updates and 
backup, the majority of computer equipment is never com­
pletely shut down. It draws energy 24 hours a day.

CHAPTER 5  |  Infrastructures: Sustainable Technologies  131
create a “virtual supercomputer” 
that can process intensive tasks. 
Grid computing makes better 
use of MIS resources, allowing 
greater scalability as systems can 
easily grow to handle peaks and 
valleys in demand, become more 
cost efficient, and solve problems 
that would be impossible to tackle with a single computer (see 
­Figures 5.12 and Figure 5.13).12  
The uses of grid computing are numerous, including the cre­
ative environment of animated movies. DreamWorks Anima­
tion used grid computing to complete many of its hit films 
including Antz, Shrek, Madagascar, and How to Train Your 
Dragon. The third Shrek film required more than 20 million 
computer hours to make (compared to 5 million for the first 
Shrek and 10 million for the second). At peak production times, 
DreamWorks dedicated more than 4,000 computers to its Shrek 
grid, allowing it to complete scenes in days and hours instead 
of months. With the increased grid computing power, the 
DreamWork’s animators were able to add more realistic move­
ment to water, fire, and magic scenes (see Figure 5.14). With 
grid computing a company can work faster or more efficiently, 
providing a potential competitive advantage and additional cost 
savings.13
Increased Carbon Emissions
The major human-generated greenhouse gases, such as carbon 
emissions from energy use, are very likely responsible for the 
increases in climatic temperature over the past half a century. 
Additional temperature increases are projected over the next 
hundred years, with serious consequences for Earth’s environ­
ment, if carbon emissions, including the carbon dioxide and 
carbon monoxide produced by business processes and systems, 
are not reduced.
In the United States, coal provides more than 50 percent 
of electrical power. When left on continuously, a single desk­
top computer and monitor can consume at least 100 watts of 
power per hour. To generate that much energy 24 hours a day 
for a year would require approximately 714 pounds of coal. 
When that coal is burned, it releases on average 5 pounds of 
sulfur dioxide, 5 pounds of nitrogen oxides, and 1,852 pounds 
(that is almost a ton) of carbon dioxide.10
SUPPORTING THE 
ENVIRONMENT: 
SUSTAINABLE MIS 
INFRASTRUCTURE  LO5.5
Combating ewaste, energy consumption, and carbon emissions 
requires a firm to focus on creating sustainable MIS infrastruc­
tures. A sustainable MIS infrastructure identifies ways that 
a company can grow in terms of computing resources while 
simultaneously becoming less dependent on hardware and 
energy consumption. The components of a sustainable MIS 
infrastructure are displayed in Figure 5.10.
LO5.5  Explain the three components of a sustainable MIS 
infrastructure along with their business benefits.
Grid Computing
When a light is turned on, the power grid delivers 
exactly what is needed, instantly. Computers 
and networks can now work that way using grid 
computing. Grid computing is a collection of 
computers, often geographically dispersed, that 
are coordinated to solve a common problem. 
With grid computing a problem is ­broken into 
pieces and distributed to many machines, allowing 
faster processing than could occur with a single 
system (see Figure 5.11). Computers typically 
use less than 25 percent of their processing power, leaving more 
than 75 percent available for other tasks. Innovatively, grid 
computing takes advantage of this unused processing power by 
linking thousands of individual computers around the world to 
How Big is Your Carbon Footprint?
Inevitably, in going about our daily lives—commuting, sheltering our 
families, ­eating—each of us contributes to the greenhouse gas emis­
sions that are causing climate change. Yet, there are many things 
each of us, as individuals, can do to reduce our carbon emissions. 
The choices we make in our homes, our travel, the food we eat, and 
what we buy and throw away all influence our carbon footprint and 
can help ensure a stable climate for future generations.11
The Nature Conservancy’s carbon footprint calculator mea­
sures your impact on our climate. Its carbon footprint calculator 
estimates how many tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse 
gases your choices create each year. Visit the Nature Conservan­
cy’s carbon footprint calculator to determine your carbon footprint 
and what you can do to reduce your emissions (http://www.nature.
org/greenliving/carboncalculator/).

operating systems along with multiple software applications—
all at the same time. Virtualization creates multiple “virtual” 
machines on a single computing device. A good analogy is a 
computer printer. In the past you had to purchase a fax machine, 
copy machine, answering machine, and computer printer sepa­
rately. This was expensive, required enough energy to run four 
separate machines, not to mention created additional amounts 
of ewaste. Today, you can buy a virtualized computer printer 
that functions as a fax machine, answering machine, and copy 
machine all on one physical machine, thereby reducing costs, 
power requirements, and ewaste. Virtualization is essentially a 
form of consolidation that can benefit sustainable MIS infra­
structures in a variety of ways, for example:
	∙	 By increasing availability of applications that can give a higher 
level of performance depending on the hardware used.
	∙	 By increasing energy efficiency by requiring less hardware to 
run multiple systems or applications.
	∙	 By increasing hardware usability by running multiple operat­
ing systems on a single computer.
Originally, computers were designed to run a single application 
on a single operating system. This left most computers vastly 
underutilized (as mentioned earlier, 75 percent of most com­
puting power is available for other tasks). Virtualization allows 
multiple virtual computers to exist on a single machine, which 
allows it to share its resources, such as memory and hard disk 
space, to run different applications and even different operating 
systems. Mac computers have the ability to run both the Apple 
Solving the Energy Issue with Smart Grids  A 
smart grid delivers electricity using two-way digital technol­
ogy. It is meant to solve the problem of the world’s outdated 
electrical grid, making it more efficient and reliable by add­
ing the ability to remotely monitor, analyze, and control the 
transmission of power. The current U.S. power grid is said to 
have outlived its life expectancy by as much as 30 years. Smart 
grids provide users with real-time usage monitoring, allowing 
them to choose off-peak times for noncritical or less urgent 
applications or processes. Residents of Boulder, Colorado, can 
monitor their use of electricity and control appliances remotely 
due to the city’s large-scale smart grid system. Xcel Energy has 
installed 21,000 smart grid meters since the $100 million pro­
gram started several years ago. Energy use by early adopters is 
down as much as 45 percent.14
Virtualized Computing
Most computers and even servers typically run only one oper­
ating system, such as Windows or Mac OS, and only one 
application. When a company invests in a large system such 
as inventory management, it dedicates a single server to house 
the system. This ensures the system has enough capacity to run 
during peak times and to scale to meet demand. Also, many sys­
tems have specific hardware requirements along with detailed 
software requirements, making it difficult to find two systems 
with the same requirements that could share the same machine. 
Through the use of virtualization, computers can run multiple

	∙	 Server virtualization combines the physical resources, 
such as servers, processors, and operating systems, from 
the applications. (This is the most common form and typically 
when you hear the term virtualization, you can assume server 
virtualization.)
Virtualization is also one of the easiest and quickest ways to 
achieve a sustainable MIS infrastructure because it reduces 
power consumption and requires less equipment that needs 
to be manufactured, maintained, and later disposed of safely. 
Managers no longer have to assign servers, storage, or network 
operating system and the Windows PC operating system, with 
the use of virtualization software (see Figure 5.15). Unfortu­
nately, virtualization, at least at the moment, is not available for 
a PC to run Mac software. There are three basic categories of 
virtualization:
	∙	 Storage virtualization combines multiple network storage 
devices so they appear to be a single storage device.
	∙	 Network virtualization combines networks by splitting the 
available bandwidth into independent channels that can be 
assigned in real time to a specific device.

capacity permanently to single applications. Instead, they 
can assign the hardware resources when and where they are 
needed, achieving the availability, flexibility, and scalability a 
company needs to thrive and grow. Also, by virtually separat­
ing the operating system and applications from the hardware, 
if there is a disaster or hardware failure, it is easy to port the 
virtual machine to a new physical machine allowing a company 
to recovery quickly from disasters. One of the primary uses of 
virtualization is for performing backup, recovery, and disaster 
recovery. Using virtual servers or a virtualization service pro­
vider, such as Google, Microsoft, or Amazon, to host disaster 
recovery is more sustainable than a single company incurring 
the expense of having redundant physical systems. Also, these 
providers’ data centers are built to withstand natural disas­
ters and are typically located far away from big cities (see 
Figure 5.16).
System virtualization is the ability to present the resources of 
a single computer as if it is a collection of separate computers 
(“virtual machines”), each with its own virtual CPUs, network 
interfaces, storage, and operating system.

Virtual machine technology was first implemented on main­
frames in the 1960s to allow the expensive systems to be parti­
tioned into separate domains and used more efficiently by more 
users and applications. As standard PC servers became more 
powerful in the past decade, virtualization has been brought 
to the desktop and notebook processors to provide the same 
benefits.
Virtual machines appear both to the user within the system and 
the world outside as separate computers, each with its own net­
work identity, user authorization and authentication capabili­
ties, operating system version and configuration, applications, 
and data. The hardware is consistent across all virtual machines: 
While the number or size of them may differ, devices are used 
that allow virtual machines to be portable, independent of the 
actual hardware type on the underlying systems. Figure 5.17 
shows an overview of what a system virtualization framework 
looks like.

used to house management information systems and associated 
components, such as telecommunications and storage systems. 
Data centers, sometimes referred to as server farms, consume 
power and require cooling and floor space while working to 
support business growth without disrupting normal business 
operations and the quality of service. The amount of data a data 
center stores has grown exponentially over the years as our reli­
ance on information increases. Backups, graphics, documents, 
presentations, photos, audio and video files all contribute to 
the ever-expanding information footprint that requires storage. 
One of the most effective ways to limit the power consump­
tion and cooling requirements of a data center is to consolidate 
parts of the physical infrastructure, particularly by reducing 
the number of physical servers through virtualization. For 
this reason, virtualization is having a profound impact on data 
centers as the sheer number of servers a company requires to 
operate decreases, thereby boosting growth and performance 
while reducing environmental impact, as shown in Figure 5.18. 
Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Yahoo! have all created data 
centers along the Columbia River in the northwestern United 
States. In this area, each company can benefit from affordable 
land, high-speed Internet access, plentiful water for cooling, 
and even more important, inexpensive electricity. These factors 
are critical to today’s large-scale data centers, whose sheer size

and power needs far surpass those of the previous generation. 
Microsoft’s data center in Quincy, Washington, is larger than 
10 football fields and is powered entirely by hydroelectricity, 
power generated from flowing water rather than from the burn­
ing of coal or other fossil fuel.15
If we take a holistic and integrated approach to overall com­
pany growth, the benefits of integrating information MIS infra­
structures, environmental MIS infrastructures, and sustainable 
MIS infrastructures become obvious. For example, a company 
could easily create a backup of its software and important 
information in one or more geographically dispersed locations 
using cloud computing. This would be far cheaper than build­
ing its own hot and cold sites in different areas of the country. 
In the case of a security breach, failover can be deployed as a 
virtual machine in one location of the cloud can be shut down 
as another virtual machine in a different location on the cloud 
comes online.
Cloud Computing
Imagine a cyclical business that specializes in Halloween 
decorations and how its sales trends and orders vary depend­
ing on the time of year. The majority of sales occur in Sep­
tember and October, and the remaining 10 months have 
relatively small sales and small 
system usage. The company does 
not want to invest in massive 
expensive servers that sit idle 
10 months of the year just to meet 
its capacity spikes in September 
and October. The perfect solution 
for this company is cloud com­
puting, which makes it easier to 
gain access to the computing power that was once reserved 
for large corporations. Small to medium-size companies no 
longer have to make big capital investments to access the 
same powerful systems that large companies run.
According to the National Institute of Standards and Technol­
ogy (NIST) cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiqui­
tous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool 
of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, 
storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provi­
sioned and released with minimal management effort or ser­
vice provider interaction. Cloud computing offers new ways 
to store, access, process, and analyze information and connect 
people and resources from any location in the world where an 
Internet connection is available.

Virtualization for 
Your Cell Phone
Virtualization is a difficult concept to under­
stand. The formal definition is a framework 
dividing the resources of a computer into multiple 
execution environments. OK, let’s try that again in 
English. Imagine you have three cell phones, one 
for the company you work for, one for a company 
you are starting on the side, and one for personal 
calls. For the most part, the phones are idle and 
they seldom ever ring at the same time. Because 
the phones are idle the majority of the time, you 
notice that it’s a waste of time and resources to 
support idle time, especially when you are paying 
for cell service on each phone. You decide to use 
virtualization to help your situation.
What this would do is essentially put three 
virtual cell phones on one device. The individual 
services and application for each phone would 
be independently stored on the one device. 
From the device’s perspective, it sees three 
separate virtual phones. This saves time and 
money in expenses and maintenance. You could 
even use virtualization to turn your cell phone 
into a scanner. Just visit ScanR.com; for just $5 a 
month you can use the camera on your phone to 
scan documents. Take a photo of any document, 
business card, or whiteboard and upload it to 
ScanR’s website, and in minutes it is returned 
to you in a digital file. Could be helpful if your 
friend has to miss class and you want to save 
your professor’s notes.
Virtualization is a hot topic these days as 
more and more businesses focus on social 
responsibility and attempt to find ways to reduce 
their carbon footprints. What are the potential 
environmental impacts of virtualization? What 
are the business advantages of virtualization? 
What risks are associated with virtualization?

138  MODULE 2  |  Technical Foundations of MIS
As shown in Figure 5.19, users connect to the cloud from their 
personal computers or portable devices using a client, such as 
a web browser. To these individual users, the cloud appears 
as their personal application, device, or document. It is like 
storing all of your software and documents “in the cloud,” and 
all you need is a device to access the cloud. No more hard 
drives, software, or processing power—that is all located in 
the cloud, transparent to the users. Users are not physically 
bound to a single computer or network; they can access their 
programs and documents from wherever they are, whenever 
they need to. Just think of having your hard drive located in the 
sky and you can access your information and programs using 
any device from wherever you are. The best part is that even 
if your machine crashes, is lost, or is stolen, the information 
hosted in the cloud is safe and always available. (See Figure 
5.20 for cloud providers and Figure 5.21 for cloud computing 
advantages.)
Multi-tenancy in the cloud means that a single instance of a 
system serves multiple customers. In the cloud, each customer 
is called a tenant and multiple tenants can access the same sys­
tem. Multi-tenancy helps to reduce operational costs associated 
with implementing large systems as the costs are dispersed 
across many tenants as opposed to single-tenancy, in which 
each customer or tenant must purchase and maintain an indi­
vidual system. With a multi-tenancy cloud approach, the ser­
vice provider only has one place to update its system. With 
a single-tenancy cloud approach, the service provider would 
have to update its system in every company where the software 
was running. The cloud fabric is the software that makes pos­
sible the benefits of cloud computing, such as multi-tenancy. 
A cloud fabric controller is an individual who monitors and 
provisions cloud resources, similar to a server administrator 
at an individual company. Cloud fabric controllers provision 
resources, balance loads, manage servers, update systems, and 
ensure all environments are available and operating correctly. 
Cloud fabric is the primary reason cloud computing promotes 
all of the seven abilities, allowing a business to make its data 
and applications accessible, available, maintainable, portable, 
reliable, scalable, and usable. Figure 5.22 displays the top busi­
ness cloud applications.
The cloud offers a company higher availability, greater reliabil­
ity, and improved ­accessibility—all with affordable high-speed 
access. For flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency, cloud 
computing is quickly becoming a viable option for companies

of all sizes. With the cloud, you could simply purchase a single 
license for software such as Microsoft Office or Outlook at a 
far discounted rate and not worry about the hassle of installing 
and upgrading the software on your computer. No more wor­
ries that you don’t have enough memory to run a new program 
because the hardware is provided in the cloud, along with the 
software. You simply pay to access the program. Think of this 
the same way you do your telephone service. You simply pay 
to access a vendor’s service, and you do not have to pay for the 
equipment required to carry the call around the globe. You also 
don’t have to worry about scalability because the system auto­
matically handles peak loads, which can be spread out among 
the systems in the cloud. Figure 5.23 displays the characteris­
tics of cloud computing.
Because additional cloud resources are always available, 
companies no longer have to purchase systems for infrequent 
computing tasks that need intense processing power, such 
as preparing tax returns during tax season or increased 
sales transactions during certain holiday seasons. If a com­
pany needs more processing power, it is always there in the 
cloud—and available on a cost-efficient basis. Heroku is the 
leading cloud platform for building and deploying social 
and mobile customer applications. Built on open standards, 
Heroku supports multiple open frameworks, languages, and 
databases.
With cloud computing, individuals or businesses pay only for 
the services they need, when they need them, and where, much 
as we use and pay for electricity. In the past, a company would 
have to pay millions of dollars for the hardware, software, and 
networking equipment required to implement a large system 
such as payroll or sales management. A cloud computing user 
can simply access the cloud and request a single license to a

payroll application. The user does not have to incur any hard­
ware, software, or networking expenses. As the business grows 
and the user requires more employees to have access to the sys­
tem, the business simply purchases additional licenses. Rather 
than running software on a local computer or server, companies 
can now reach to the cloud to combine software applications, 
data storage, and considerable computing power.
Regardless of which cloud model a business chooses, it can 
select from four different cloud computing environments—
public, private, community, and hybrid (see Figure 5.24).
Public Cloud  Public cloud promotes massive, global, 
and industrywide applications offered to the general public. 
In a public cloud, customers are never required to provision, 
manage, upgrade, or replace hardware or software. Pricing 
is utility-style and customers pay only for the resources they 
use. Public clouds are the type used by service providers to 
offer free or paid-for services to the general public.  They are 
open, but often with standard restrictions requiring passwords. 
A few great examples of public cloud computing include 
Amazon Web Services (AWS), 
Windows Azure, and Google 
Cloud Connect.
Private Cloud  Private cloud 
serves only one customer or orga­
nization and can be located on 
the customer’s premises or off 
the customer’s premises. A pri­
vate cloud is the optimal solu­
tion for an organization such as 
the ­government that has high 
data security concerns and val­
ues information privacy. Private 
clouds are far more expensive 
than public clouds because costs are not shared across multiple 
customers. Private clouds are mostly used by firms and groups 
who need to keep data secure. The main downside is that they 
still require significant investment of time and money to set 
them up.
 Hack Attack13
A
 few years ago, it would have been diffi­
cult to pull off a hacker attack like the one 
that took down Twitter. A sophisticated 
hacker would have needed either the technical 
savvy to hijack thousands of computers simulta­
neously or tens of thousands of dollars to pay 
someone else to do it. Not today. The tools for 
taking down websites like Twitter, 
Amazon, or Facebook are getting 
so cheap and easy to use that the 
average Joe could easily wreak 
havoc on any website.
In the Twitter attack, hackers 
were trying to silence a single 
blogger who criticized the Rus­
sian government, Georgy Jakhaia, 
who is known online as Cyxymu. 
The hackers launched a denial-of-
service attack, in which thousands 
of computers try to communicate 
with the target website at the 
same time so the site’s computers 
are overwhelmed and can’t han­
dle legitimate requests. In what 
appears to be collateral damage, 
the hackers took down the entire Twitter service 
and hobbled the blogging sites LiveJournal and 
Facebook, where Jakhaia also posted.
How does it work? Criminal groups and 
hackers have infected tens of millions of com­
puters around the world with viruses that allow 
them to control the machines to launch attacks 
or send spam. These networks of zombie com­
puters, called “botnets,” are then rented out on 
a per-machine and per-day basis through web­
sites that make executing a denial-of-service 
attack almost as easy as getting a book from 
Amazon. No password cracking or software 
coding is necessary. And it is almost as cheap. 
A few years ago the cost of rent­
ing out 10,000 machines would 
have 
been 
between 
$2,000 
and $5,000. Today you can rent 
10,000 machines—enough to take 
down Twitter—for a mere $200.
With all that you have read in 
this chapter, highlight the steps 
an organization can take to pro­
tect itself from hacker attacks. 
Explain how a denial-of-service 
attack works and why it is illegal. 
Would using a service-oriented 
architecture protect a company 
from a denial-of-service attack? If 
you were using virtualization, how 
could you protect your computers 
from a denial-of-service attack?

Community Cloud  Com­
munity cloud serves a specific 
community with common business 
models, security requirements, 
and compliance considerations. 
Community clouds are emerging 
in highly regulated industries such 
as financial services and pharma­
ceutical companies. Community 
clouds are private, but spread over 
a variety of groups within one 
organization. Different sections of 
the cloud can be set up specifically 
for each department or group.
Hybrid Cloud  Hybrid cloud 
includes two or more private, 
public, or community clouds, but 
each cloud remains separate and is only linked by technol­
ogy that enables data and application portability. For example, 
a company might use a private cloud for ­critical applications 
that maintain sensitive data and a public cloud for nonsensitive 
data applications. The usage of both ­private and public clouds 
together is an example of a hybrid cloud. Hybrid clouds offer 
services even if connectivity faults occur and are often used 
to provide backup to critical online services. Cloud bursting 
is when a company uses its own computing infrastructure for 
normal usage and accesses the cloud when it needs to scale for 
peak load requirements, ensuring a sudden spike in usage does 
not result in poor performance or system crashes.
Deploying an MIS infrastructure in the cloud forever changes 
the way an organization’s MIS systems are developed, 
deployed, maintained, and managed. Moving to the cloud is 
a fundamental shift from moving from a physical world to 
a logical world, making irrelevant the notion of which indi­
vidual server applications or data reside on. As a result, orga­
nizations and MIS departments need to change the way they 
view systems and the new opportunities to find competitive 
advantages.
community

specific community 
with common 
business models,

and compliance 
considerations.
hybrid

or more private, public, 
or community clouds, 
but each cloud remains

Utility Computing
Utility computing offers a pay-per-use revenue model simi­
lar to a metered service such as gas or electricity. Many cloud 
computing service providers use utility computing cloud infra­
structures, which are detailed in Figure 5.25.
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)  Infrastructure 
as a Service (IaaS) delivers hardware networking capabilities, 
including the use of servers, networking, and storage, over the 
cloud using a pay-per-use revenue model. With IaaS, the cus­
tomer rents the hardware and provides its own custom applica­
tions or programs. IaaS customers save money by not having to 
spend a large amount of capital purchasing expensive servers, 
which is a great business advantage considering some servers 
cost more than $100,000. The service is typically paid for on 
a usage basis, much like a basic utility service such as elec­
tricity or gas. IaaS offers a cost-effective solution for compa­
nies that need their computing resources to grow and shrink as 
business demand changes. This is known as dynamic scaling, 
which means the MIS infrastructure can be automatically 
scaled up or down based on requirements. Disaster ­Recovery 
as a Service (DRaaS) offers backup services that use cloud 
resources to protect applications and data from disruption 
caused by disaster. It gives an organization a total system 
backup that allows for business continuity in the event of sys­
tem failure. DRaaS is typically part of a disaster recovery plan 
or business continuity plan.
Currently the most popular IaaS operation is Amazon’s Elastic 
Compute Cloud, generally known as Amazon EC2, or simply 
EC2. EC2 provides a web interface through which customers 
can load and run their own applications on Amazon’s com­
puters. Customers control their own operating environment, 
so they can create, run, and stop services as needed, which is 
why Amazon describes EC2 as elastic. IaaS is a perfect fit for 
companies with research-intensive projects that need to pro­
cess large amounts of information at irregular intervals, such as

those in the scientific or medical fields. Cloud computing ser­
vices offer these companies considerable cost savings because 
they can perform testing and analysis at levels that are not pos­
sible without access to additional and very costly computing 
infrastructure.
Software as a Service (SaaS)  Software as a Service 
(SaaS) delivers applications over the cloud using a pay-per-use 
revenue model. Before its introduction, companies often spent 
huge amounts of money implementing and customizing special­
ized applications to satisfy their business requirements. Many 
of these applications were difficult to implement, expensive to 
maintain, and challenging to use. Usability was one of the big­
gest drivers for creating interest in and success for cloud com­
puting service providers.
SaaS offers a number of advantages; the most obvious is tre­
mendous cost savings. The software is priced on a per-use basis 
with no up-front costs, so companies get the immediate ben­
efit of reducing capital expenditures. They also get the added 
benefits of scalability and flexibility to test new software on a 
rental basis.
Salesforce.com is one of the most popular SaaS providers. It 
built and delivered a sales automation application, suitable for 
the typical salesperson, that automates functions such as tracking 
sales leads and prospects and forecasting. Tapping the power of 
SaaS can provide access to a large-scale, secure infrastructure, 
along with any needed support, which is especially valuable for 
a start-up or small company with few financial resources.
Data as a Service (DaaS) facilitates the acces­
sibility of business-critical data in a timely, 
secure, and affordable manner. DaaS depends 
on the principle that specified, useful data can 
be supplied to users on demand, irrespective of 
any organizational or geographical separation 
between consumers and providers.
Platform as a Service (PaaS)  Platform 
as a Service (PaaS) supports the deploy­
ment of entire systems, including hardware, 
networking, and applications, using a pay-per-use revenue 
model. PaaS is a perfect solution for a business because it passes 
on to the service provider the headache and challenges of buy­
ing, managing, and maintaining web development software. 
Upcycle Your Old PC
Imagine walking into your friend’s home and seeing her computer 
with live fish swimming around inside it. Upon taking a second 
look, you realize she has upcycled her old Mac into an innovative 
macquarium. Some young entrepreneurs are making a fortune by 
upcycling old Mac desktops as fish tanks. An upcycle reuses or refur­
bishes ewaste and creates a new product. With the growing problem 
of ewaste, one alternative is to upcycle your old technology by creat­
ing innovative household products or personal accessories. Take a 
look at one of the devices you are currently using to see whether 
you can create an upcycled product. Here are a few great ideas to

	∙	 Increased speed to market with significantly less cost.
One of the most popular PaaS services is Google’s Applica­
tion Engine, which builds and deploys web applications for a 
company. Google’s Application Engine is easy to build, easy to 
maintain, and easy to scale as a company’s web-based applica­
tion needs grow. Google’s Application Engine is free and offers 
a standard storage limit and enough processing power and net­
work usage to support a web application serving about 5 million 
page views a month. When a customer scales beyond these initial 
limits, it can pay a fee to increase capacity and performance. This 
can turn into some huge costs savings for a small business that 
does not have enough initial capital to buy expensive hardware 
and software for its web applications. Just think, a two-person 
company can access the same computing resources as Google. 
That makes good business sense. Regardless of which cloud 
model a business chooses, it can select from four cloud comput­
ing environments—public, private, community, and hybrid.
Combining infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and 
data as a service we arrive at Big Data as a Service. Big Data 
as a Service (BDaaS) offers a cloud-based Big Data service 
to help organizations analyze massive amounts of data to solve 
business dilemmas. BDaaS is a somewhat nebulous term often 
used to describe a wide variety of outsourcing of various Big 
Data functions to the cloud.  This can range from the supply of 
data, to the supply of analytical tools with which to interrogate 
the data (often through a web dashboard or control panel) to 
carrying out the actual analysis and providing reports. Some 
BDaaS providers also include consulting and advisory services 
within their BDaaS packages.

various bits of data stored across 
multiple, operational databases 
can be transformed in a centralized 
repository of summarized informa­
tion in a data warehouse, which can be used for discovering 
business intelligence.
You, as a business student, need to understand the differ­
ences between transactional data and summarized information 
and the different types of questions you could use a transac­
tional database to answer versus a data warehouse. You need 
to be aware of the complexity of storing data in databases and 
the level of effort required to transform operational data into 
meaningful, summarized information. You need to realize the 
power of information and the competitive advantage a data 
warehouse brings an organization in terms of facilitating business 
intelligence. Armed with the power of information, business stu­
dents will make smart, informed, and datasupported managerial 
decisions. ■
perform. The ability to understand, digest, analyze, and fil­
ter information is key to growth and success for any pro­
fessional in any industry. Remember that new perspectives 
and opportunities can open up when you have the right data 
that you can turn into information and ultimately business 
intelligence.
Information is everywhere in an organization. Managers in 
sales, marketing, human resources, and management need 
information to run their departments and make daily decisions. 
When addressing a significant business issue, employees must 
be able to obtain and analyze all the relevant information so 
they can make the best decision possible. Information comes 
at different levels, formats, and granularities. Information 
granularity refers to the extent of detail within the informa­
tion (fine and detailed or coarse and abstract). Employees must 
be able to correlate the different levels, formats, and granu­
larities of information when making decisions. For example, 
a company might be collecting information from various sup­
pliers to make needed decisions, only to find that the infor­
mation is in different levels, formats, and granularities. One 
supplier might send detailed information in a spreadsheet, 
while another supplier might send summary information in a 
Word document, and still another might send a collection of 
information from emails. Employees will need to compare 
these different types of information for what they commonly 
reveal to make strategic decisions. Figure 6.1 displays the 
various levels, formats, and granularities of organizational 
information.
Successfully collecting, compiling, sorting, and finally ana­
lyzing information from multiple levels, in varied formats, 
and exhibiting different granularities can provide tremendous 
insight into how an organization is performing. Exciting and 
unexpected results can include potential new markets, new 
ways of reaching customers, and even new methods of doing 
business. After understanding the different levels, formats, and 
granularities of information, managers next want to look at the 
four primary traits that help determine the value of information 
(see Figure 6.2).
LO6.1  Explain the four primary traits that determine the value of 
information.
Information Type: Transactional 
and Analytical
As discussed previously in the text, the two primary types of 
information are transactional and analytical. Transactional 
information encompasses all of the information contained 
within a single business process or unit of work, and its pri­
mary purpose is to support daily operational tasks. Organi­
zations need to capture and store transactional information 
to perform operational tasks and repetitive decisions such 
as analyzing daily sales reports and production schedules to

whether the organization should build a new manufacturing 
plant or hire additional sales personnel. Analytical infor­
mation makes it possible to do many things that previously 
were difficult to accomplish, such as spot business trends, 
prevent diseases, and fight crime. For example, credit card 
companies crunch through billions of transactional purchase 
records to identify fraudulent activity. Indicators such as 
charges in a foreign country or consecutive purchases of 
gasoline send a red flag highlighting potential fraudulent 
activity.
Walmart was able to use its massive amount of analytical infor­
mation to identify many unusual trends, such as a correlation 
between storms and Pop-Tarts. Yes, Walmart discovered an 
increase in the demand for Pop-Tarts during the storm season. 
Armed with the valuable information the retail chain was able 
to stock up on Pop-Tarts that were ready for purchase when 
customers arrived. Figure 6.3 displays different types of trans­
actional and analytical information.
Information Timeliness
Timeliness is an aspect of information that depends on the sit­
uation. In some firms or industries, information that is a few 
days or weeks old can be relevant, while in others informa­
tion that is a few minutes old can be almost worthless. Some 
organizations, such as 911 response centers, stock traders, and 
banks, require up-to-the-second information. Other organiza­
tions, such as insurance and construction companies, require 
only daily or even weekly information.

determine how much inventory to carry. Consider Walmart, 
which handles more than 1 million customer transactions 
every hour, and Facebook, which keeps track of 400 mil­
lion active users (along with their photos, friends, and web 
links). In addition, every time a cash register rings up a sale, 
a deposit or withdrawal is made from an ATM, or a receipt is 
given at the gas pump, capturing and storing of the transac­
tional information are required.
Analytical information encompasses all organizational 
information, and its primary purpose is to support the per­
forming of managerial analysis tasks. Analytical informa­
tion is useful when making important decisions such as 

150  MODULE 2  |  Technical Foundations of MIS
Real-time information means immediate, up-to-date infor­
mation. Real-time systems provide real-time information in 
response to requests. Many organizations use real-time systems 
to uncover key corporate transactional information. The growing 
demand for real-time information stems from organizations’ need 
to make faster and more effective decisions, keep smaller inven­
tories, operate more efficiently, and track performance more 
carefully. Information also needs to be timely in the sense that it 
meets employees’ needs, but no more. 
If employees can absorb information 
only on an hourly or daily basis, there 
is no need to gather real-time infor­
mation in smaller increments.
Most people request real-time infor­
mation without understanding one 
of  the biggest pitfalls associated 
with real-time information—continual 
change. Imagine the following sce­
nario: Three managers meet at the 
end of the day to discuss a business 
problem. Each manager has gath­
ered information at different times 
during the day to create a picture of 
the situation. Each manager’s picture 
may be different because of the time 
differences. Their views on the busi­
ness problem may not match because 
the information they are basing their 
analysis on is continually changing. 
This approach may not speed up 
decision making, and it may actually 
slow it down. Business decision mak­
ers must evaluate the timeliness for 
the information for every decision. 
Organizations do not want to find 
themselves using real-time informa­
tion to make a bad decision faster.
Information Quality
Business decisions are only as good 
as the quality of the information used 
to make them. Information incon­
sistency occurs when the same data 
element has different values. Take 
for example the amount of work that 
needs to occur to update a customer 
who had changed her last name due 
to marriage. Changing this infor­
mation in only a few organizational systems will lead to data 
inconsistencies causing customer 123456 to be associated with 
two last names. Information integrity issues occur when a 
system produces incorrect, inconsistent, or duplicate data. Data 
integrity issues can cause managers to consider the system 
reports invalid and will make decisions based on other sources.
To ensure your systems do not suffer from data integrity 
issues, review Figure 6.4 for the five characteristics common to 
real-time information

CHAPTER 6  |  Data: Business Intelligence  151
high-quality information: accuracy, completeness, consistency, 
timeliness, and uniqueness. Figure 6.5 provides an example of 
several problems associated with using low-quality informa­
tion including:
	1.	 Completeness. The customer’s first name is missing.
	2.	 Another issue with completeness. The street address con­
tains only a number and not a street name.
	3.	 Consistency. There may be a duplication of information since 
there is a slight difference between the two customers in the 
spelling of the last name. Similar street addresses and phone 
numbers make this likely.
	4.	 Accuracy. This may be inaccurate information 
because the customer’s phone and fax numbers 
are the same. Some customers might have 
the same number for phone and fax, but the 
fact that the customer also has this number 
in the email address field is suspicious.
	5.	 Another issue with accuracy. There is inaccu­
rate information because a phone number is 
located in the email address field.
	6.	 Another issue with completeness. The infor­
mation is incomplete because there is not 
a valid area code for the phone and fax 
numbers.
Nestlé uses 550,000 suppliers to sell more than 100,000 prod­
ucts in 200 countries. However, due to poor information, the 
company was unable to evaluate its business effectively. After 
some analysis, it found that it had 9 million records of vendors, 
customers, and materials, half of which were duplicated, obso­
lete, inaccurate, or incomplete. The analysis discovered that 
some records abbreviated vendor names while other records 
spelled out the vendor names. This created multiple accounts 
for the same customer, making it impossible to determine the 
true value of Nestlé’s customers. Without being able to identify 
customer profitability, a company runs the risk of alienating its 
best customers.1

data that is easily accessible in a consistent manner. A data stew­
ard is responsible for ensuring the policies and procedures are 
implemented across the organization and acts as a liaison between 
the MIS department and the business. One company discovered 
that even with its large number of golf courses, Phoenix, Arizona, 
is not a good place to sell golf clubs. An analysis revealed that 
typical golfers in Phoenix are tourists and conventioneers who 
usually bring their clubs with them. The analysis further revealed 
that two of the best places to sell golf clubs in the United States 
are Rochester, New York, and Detroit, Michigan. Equipped with 
this valuable information, the company was able to strategically 
place its stores and launch its marketing campaigns.
High-quality information does not automatically guarantee 
that every decision made is going to be a good one, because 
people ultimately make decisions and no one is perfect. How­
ever, such information ensures that the basis of the decisions is 
accurate. The success of the organization depends on appreci­
ating and leveraging the true value of timely and high-quality 
information.
Information Governance
Information is a vital resource and users need to be educated on 
what they can and cannot do with it. To ensure a firm manages 
its information correctly, it will need special policies and pro­
cedures establishing rules on how the information is organized, 
updated, maintained, and accessed. Every firm, large and small, 
should create an information policy concerning data governance. 
Data governance refers to the overall management of the avail­
ability, usability, integrity, and security of company data. Mas­
ter data management (MDM) is the practice of gathering data 
and ensuring that it is uniform, accurate, consistent, and com­
plete, including such entities as customers, suppliers, products, 
sales, employees, and other critical entities that are commonly 
integrated across organizational systems. MDM is commonly 
included in data governance. A company that supports a data 
governance program has a defined a policy that specifies who is 
accountable for various portions or aspects of the data, including 
its accuracy, accessibility, consistency, timeliness, and complete­
ness. The policy should clearly define the processes concerning 
how to store, archive, back up, and secure the data. In addition, 
Knowing how low-quality information issues typically occur 
can help a company correct them. Addressing these errors will 
significantly improve the quality of company information and 
the value to be extracted from it. The four primary reasons for 
low-quality information are:
	1.	 Online customers intentionally enter inaccurate information 
to protect their privacy.
	2.	 Different systems have different information entry standards 
and formats.
	3.	 Data-entry personnel enter abbreviated information to save 
time or erroneous information by accident.
	4.	 Third-party and external information contains inconsistencies, 
inaccuracies, and errors.
Understanding the Costs of Using Low-Qual­
ity Information  Using the wrong information can lead 
managers to make erroneous decisions. Erroneous decisions in 
turn can cost time, money, reputations, and even jobs. Some of 
the serious business consequences that occur due to using low-
quality information to make decisions are:
	∙	 Inability to accurately track customers.
	∙	 Difficulty identifying the organization’s most valuable 
customers.
	∙	 Inability to identify selling opportunities.
	∙	 Lost revenue opportunities from marketing to nonexistent 
customers.
	∙	 The cost of sending non-deliverable mail.
	∙	 Difficulty tracking revenue because of inaccurate invoices.
	∙	 Inability to build strong relationships with customers.
A data gap analysis occurs when a company examines its data 
to determine if it can meet business expectations, while identi­
fying possible data gaps or where missing data might exist.
Understanding the Benefits of Using High-
Quality Information  High-quality information can 
significantly improve the chances of making a good deci­
sion and directly increase an organization’s bottom line. Data 
­stewardship is the management and oversight of an organiza­
tion’s data assets to help provide business users with high-quality 
data gap

objects (inventory), events (transactions), people (employ­
ees), and places (warehouses). A database management 
system (DBMS) creates, reads, updates, and deletes data 
in a database while controlling access and security. Manag­
ers send requests to the DBMS, and the DBMS performs the 
actual manipulation of the data in the database. Companies 
store their information in databases, and managers access 
these systems to answer operational questions such as how 
many customers purchased Product A in December or what 
were the average sales by region. There are two primary tools 
available for retrieving information from a DBMS. First is a 
query-by-example (QBE) tool that helps users graphically 
design the answer to a question against a database. Second is 
a structured query language (SQL) that asks users to write 
lines of code to answer questions against a database. Managers 
typically interact with QBE tools, and MIS professionals have 
the skills required to code SQL. Figure 6.6 displays the rela­
tionship between a database, a DBMS, and a user. Some of the 
more popular examples of DBMS include MySQL, Microsoft 
Access, SQL Server, FileMaker, Oracle, and FoxPro.
A data element (or data field ) is the smallest or basic unit 
of information. Data elements can include a customer’s name, 
address, email, discount rate, preferred shipping method, 
product name, quantity ordered, and so on. Data models are 
logical data structures that detail the relationships among data 
elements using graphics or pictures.
Metadata provides details about data. For example, metadata 
for an image could include its size, resolution, and date created. 
Metadata about a text document could contain document length, 
the company should create a set of procedures identifying acces­
sibility levels for employees. Then, the firm should deploy con­
trols and procedures that enforce government regulations and 
compliance with mandates such as Sarbanes-Oxley.
It is important to note the difference between data governance 
and data stewardship.  Data governance focuses on enterprise­
wide policies and procedures, while data stewardship focuses 
on the strategic implementation of the policies and procedures. 
Data validation includes the tests and evaluations used to 
determine compliance with data governance polices to ensure 
correctness of data. Data validation helps to ensure that every 
data value is correct and accurate.  In Excel you can use data 
validation to control the type of data or the values that users 
enter into a cell. For example, you may want to restrict data 
entry to a certain range of dates, limit choices by using a list, 
or make sure that only positive whole numbers are entered.

154  MODULE 2  |  Technical Foundations of MIS
LO6.2  Describe a database, a database management system, 
and the relational database model.
Storing Data Elements in Entities 
and Attributes
For flexibility in supporting business operations, managers need 
to query or search for the answers to business questions such as 
which artist sold the most albums during a certain month. The rela­
tionships in the relational database model help managers extract 
this information. Figure 6.7 illustrates the primary concepts of the 
relational database model—entities, attributes, keys, and relation­
ships. An entity (also referred to as a table) stores information 
about a person, place, thing, transaction, or event. The entities, 
or tables, of interest in Figure 6.7 are TRACKS, RECORDINGS, 
MUSICIANS, and CATEGORIES. Notice that each entity is stored 
in a different two-dimensional table (with rows and columns).
data created, author’s name, and summary. Each data element is 
given a description, such as Customer Name; metadata is pro­
vided for the type of data (text, numeric, alphanumeric, date, 
image, binary value) and descriptions of potential predefined 
values such as a certain area code; and finally the relationship is 
defined. A data dictionary compiles all of the metadata about 
the data elements in the data model. Looking at a data model 
along with reviewing the data dictionary provides tremendous 
insight into the database’s functions, purpose, and business rules.
DBMS use three primary data models for organizing 
­information—hierarchical, network, and the relational data­
base, the most prevalent. A relational database model stores 
information in the form of logically related two-­dimensional 
tables. A relational database management system allows 
users to create, read, update, and delete data in a relational data­
base. Although the hierarchical and network models are impor­
tant, this text focuses only on the relational database model.

FIGURE 6. 7   Primary Concepts of the Relational Database Model

CHAPTER 6  |  Data: Business Intelligence  155
Coca Cola 
Relational Database 
Example
Figure  6.8  illustrates the primary 
concepts of the relational database 
model for a sample order of soda 
from Coca Cola. Figure 6.8 offers 
an excellent example of how data 
is stored in a database. For exam­
ple, the order number is stored 
in the ORDER table, and each 
line item is stored in the ORDER 
LINE table. Entities include CUS­
TOMER, ORDER, ORDER LINE, 
PRODUCT, and DISTRIBUTOR. 
Attributes for CUSTOMER include Customer ID, Customer 
Name, Contact Name, and Phone. Attributes for PRODUCT 
include Product ID, Description, and Price. The columns in the 
table contain the attributes.
USING A RELATIONAL 
DATABASE 
FOR BUSINESS 
ADVANTAGES  LO6.3
Many business managers are familiar with Excel and other 
spreadsheet programs they can use to store business data. 
Although spreadsheets are excellent for supporting some data 
analysis, they offer limited functionality in terms of security, 
accessibility, and flexibility and can rarely scale to support 
business growth. From a business perspective, relational data­
bases offer many advantages over using a text document or a 
spreadsheet, as displayed in Figure 6.9.
LO6.3  Identify the business advantages of a relational database.
Attributes (also called columns or fields) are the data elements 
associated with an entity. In Figure 6.7 the attributes for the 
entity TRACKS are TrackNumber, TrackTitle, TrackLength, 
and RecordingID. Attributes for the entity MUSICIANS are 
MusicianID, MusicianName, MusicianPhoto, and Musician­
Notes. A record is a collection of related data elements (in the 
MUSICIANS table these include “3, Lady Gaga, gag.tiff, Do 
not bring young kids to live shows”). Each record in an entity 
occupies one row in its respective table.
Creating Relationships Through Keys
To manage and organize various entities within the relational 
database model, you use primary keys and foreign keys to cre­
ate logical relationships. A primary key is a field (or group of 
fields) that uniquely identifies a given record in a table. In the 
table RECORDINGS, the primary key is the field RecordingID 
that uniquely identifies each record in the table. Primary keys are 
a critical piece of a relational database because they provide a 
way of distinguishing each record in a table; for instance, imagine 
you need to find information on a customer named Steve Smith. 
Simply searching the customer name would not be an ideal way 
to find the information because there might be 20 customers with 
the name Steve Smith. This is the reason the relational database 
model uses primary keys to uniquely identify each record. Using 
Steve Smith’s unique ID allows a manager to search the database 
to identify all information associated with this customer.
A foreign key is a primary key of one table that appears as 
an attribute in another table and acts to provide a logical rela­
tionship between the two tables. For instance, Black Eyed Peas 
in Figure 6.7 is one of the musicians appearing in the MUSI­
CIANS table. Its primary key, MusicianID, is “2.” Notice that 
MusicianID also appears as an attribute in the RECORDINGS 
table. By matching these attributes, you create a relationship 
between the MUSICIANS and RECORDINGS tables that states 
the Black Eyed Peas (MusicianID 2) have several recordings 
including The E.N.D., Monkey Business, and Elepunk. In 
essence, MusicianID in the RECORDINGS table creates a logi­
cal relationship (who was the musician that made the record­
ing) to the MUSICIANS table. Creating the logical relationship 
between the tables allows managers to search the data and turn 
it into useful information.
Due Diligence //:
That’s Not My Mother in the 
Casket!2
Information—you simply can’t put a value on having the right (or the 
cost of having the wrong) information. Just look at the mistake made 
at the Crib Point cemetery in Victoria, Australia, when they were 
burying Mrs. Ryan, an 85-year-old woman with almost 70 children, 
grandchildren, and great-grandchildren attending her funeral. The 
bereaved family of Mrs. Ryan was shocked to lift the lid of her coffin 
during the funeral to discover another woman lying in her clothes 
and jewelry. Where was the body of Mrs. Ryan? Mrs. Ryan had been 
buried earlier that day in the other woman’s clothes, jewelry, and 
plot.
What type of information blunder could possibly occur to allow some­
one to be buried in the wrong clothes, coffin, and plot? What could the 
cemetery do to ensure its customers are buried in the correct places? 
Why is the quality of information important to any business? What 
issues can occur when a business uses low-quality information to make 
decisions?

CHAPTER 6  |  Data: Business Intelligence  157
For example, are there more R&B 
recordings than rock, or are they 
evenly distributed? This example 
demonstrates that while a data­
base has only one physical view, it 
can easily support multiple logical 
views that provides for flexibility.
Consider another example—a mail-
order business. One user might 
want a report presented in alpha­
betical format, in which case last 
name should appear before first 
name. Another user, working with 
a catalog mailing system, would 
want customer names appearing as first name and then last name. 
Both are easily achievable, but different logical views of the same 
physical information.
Increased Flexibility
Databases tend to mirror business structures, and a database 
needs to handle changes quickly and easily, just as any busi­
ness needs to be able to do. Equally important, databases 
need to provide flexibility in allowing each user to access the 
information in whatever way best suits his or her needs. The 
distinction between logical and physical views is important 
in understanding flexible database user views. The physical 
view of information deals with the physical storage of infor­
mation on a storage device. The logical view of information 
focuses on how individual users logically access information to 
meet their own particular business needs.
In the database illustration from Figure 6.7, for example, one 
user could perform a query to determine which recordings 
had a track length of four minutes or more. At the same time, 
another user could perform an analysis to determine the distri­
bution of recordings as they relate to the different categories. 
Yes, I Started the Internet3
Imagine your favorite co-worker Mary, a 
hard working employee who is excelling 
at her job and continuously receives 
outstanding performance reviews. Sud­
denly, after two years of hard work, 
Mary is fired and you are wondering 
what happened. What will you say 
when you find out that Mary lied on 
her résumé about having a mas­
ter’s degree? Will you feel that Mary got what she 
deserved, or should her outstanding job performance have helped man­
agement look past this issue? After all, she is excellent at her job.
Every student should know that if dishonesty is discovered, it is often 
grounds for termination and possibly legal action. Information integrity 
is a measure of the quality of information. According to Steven D. Lev­
itt, co-author of Freakonomics and a renowned economics professor at 
the University of Chicago, more than 50 percent of people lie on their 
résumés. Given such repercussions as Mary’s fate, you will want to think 
twice before ever lying on your résumé. The integrity of the information 
on your résumé is a direct representation of your personal integrity. How 
would you handle Mary’s situation if you were her manager?

158  MODULE 2  |  Technical Foundations of MIS
There are two types of integrity constraints: (1) relational and 
(2) business critical.
Relational integrity constraints are rules that enforce basic 
and fundamental information-based constraints. For example, 
a relational integrity constraint would not allow someone to 
create an order for a nonexistent customer, provide a markup 
percentage that was negative, or order zero pounds of raw mate­
rials from a supplier. A business rule defines how a company 
performs certain aspects of its business and typically results in 
either a yes/no or true/false answer. Stating that merchandise 
returns are allowed within 10 days of purchase is an example 
of a business rule. Business-critical integrity constraints 
enforce business rules vital to an organization’s success and 
often require more insight and knowledge than relational integ­
rity constraints. Consider a supplier of fresh produce to large 
Increased Scalability 
and Performance
In its first year of operation, the official website of the ­American 
Family Immigration History Center, www.ellisisland.org, gen­
erated more than 2.5 billion hits. The site offers immigration 
information about people who entered America through the 
Port of New York and Ellis Island between 1892 and 1924. The 
database contains more than 25 million passenger names that 
are correlated to 3.5 million images of ships’ manifests.4
The database had to be scalable to handle the massive ­volumes 
of information and the large numbers of users expected for 
the launch of the website. In addition, the database needed to 
perform quickly under heavy use. Data latency is the time 
it takes for data to be stored or retrieved. Some organizations 
must be able to support hundreds or thousands of users includ­
ing employees, partners, customers, and suppliers, who all want 
to access and share the same information with minimal data 
latency. Databases today scale to exceptional levels, allowing all 
types of users and programs to perform information-processing 
and information-searching tasks.
Reduced Information Redundancy
Information redundancy is the duplication of data, or the 
storage of the same data in multiple places. Redundant data can 
cause storage issues along with data integrity issues, making it 
difficult to determine which values are the most current or most 
accurate. Employees become confused and frustrated when 
faced with incorrect information causing disruptions to busi­
ness processes and procedures. One primary goal of a database 
is to eliminate information redundancy by recording each piece 
of information in only one place in the database. This saves disk 
space, makes performing information updates easier, and 
improves information quality.
Increased Information 
Integrity (Quality)
Information integrity is a measure of the qual­
ity of information. Integrity constraints are 
rules that help ensure the quality of information. 
The database design needs to consider integrity 
constraints. The database and the DBMS ensures 
that users can never violate these constraints.

Excel or Access?
Excel is a great tool with which to perform business analytics. Your 
friend, John Cross, owns a successful publishing company special­
izing in Do It Yourself books. John started the business 10 years ago 
and has slowly grown to 50 employees and $1 million in sales. John 
has been using Excel to run the majority of his business, tracking 
book orders, production orders, shipping orders, and billing. John 
even uses Excel to track employee payroll and vacation dates. To 
date, Excel has done the job, but as the company continues to grow, 
the tool is becoming inadequate.
You believe John could benefit from moving from Excel to 
Access. John is skeptical of the change because Excel has done the 
job up to now, and his employees are comfortable with the cur­
rent processes and technology. John has asked you to prepare a 
presentation explaining the limitations of Excel and the benefits 
of Access. In a group, prepare the presentation that will help con­
vince John to make the switch.

access only to their own employ­
ees’ files, not the employee files 
for the entire company. Various 
security features of databases can 
ensure that individuals have only 
certain types of access to certain 
types of information.
Identity management is a broad 
administrative area that deals with 
identifying individuals in a system 
(such as a country, a network, or 
an enterprise) and controlling their 
access to resources within that sys­
tem by associating user rights and 
restrictions with the established 
identity. Security risks are increas­
ing as more and more databases 
and DBMS systems are moving to 
data centers run in the cloud. The 
biggest risks when using cloud 
computing are ensuring the secu­
rity and privacy of the informa­
tion in the database. Implementing 
data governance policies and pro­
cedures that outline the data man­
agement requirements can ensure 
safe and secure cloud computing.
grocery chains such as Kroger. The supplier might implement 
a business-critical integrity constraint stating that no product 
returns are accepted after 15 days past delivery. That would 
make sense because of the chance of spoilage of the produce. 
Business-critical integrity constraints tend to mirror the very 
rules by which an organization achieves success.
The specification and enforcement of integrity constraints pro­
duce higher-quality information that will provide better support 
for business decisions. Organizations that establish specific 
procedures for developing integrity constraints typically see an 
increase in accuracy that then increases the use of organiza­
tional information by business professionals.
Increased Information Security
Managers must protect information, like any asset, from unau­
thorized users or misuse. As systems become increasingly 
complex and highly available over the Internet on many differ­
ent devices, security becomes an even bigger issue. Databases 
offer many security features including passwords to provide 
authentication, access levels to determine who can access the 
data, and access controls to determine what type of access they 
have to the information.
For example, customer service representatives might need 
read-only access to customer order information so they can 
answer customer order inquiries; they might not have or need 
the authority to change or delete order information. Managers 
might require access to employee files, but they should have

Sorry, I Didn’t Mean to Post 
Your Social Security Number 
on the Internet5
Programming 101 teaches all students that security is the crucial part of 
any system. You must secure your data! It appears that some people 
working for the state of Oklahoma forgot this important lesson when tens 
of thousands of Oklahoma residents had their sensitive data—including 
numbers—posted on the Internet for the general public to access. You 
have probably heard this type of report before, but have you heard that 
the error went unnoticed for three years? A programmer reported the 
problem, explaining how he could easily change the page his browser 
was pointing to and grab the entire database for the state of Oklahoma. 
Also, because of the programming, malicious users could easily tamper 
with the database by changing data or adding fictitious data. If you are 
still thinking that isn’t such a big deal, it gets worse. The website also 
posted the Sexual and Violent Offender Registry. Yes, the Department 
of Corrections employee data were also available for the general public 
to review.
Why is it important to secure data? What can happen if someone 
accesses your customer database? What could happen if someone 
changes the information in your customer database and adds fictitious 
data? Who should be held responsible for the state of Oklahoma data 
breech? What are the business risks associated with data security?

DRIVING WEBSITES 
WITH DATA  LO6.4
A content creator is the person responsible for creating 
the original website content. A content editor is the person 
responsible for updating and maintaining website content. 
Static information includes fixed data incapable of change in 
the event of a user action. Dynamic information includes data 
that change based on user actions. For example, static websites 
supply only information that will not change until the content 
editor changes the information. Dynamic information changes 
when a user requests information. A dynamic website changes 
information based on user requests such as movie ticket avail­
ability, airline prices, or restaurant reservations. Dynamic web­
site information is stored in a dynamic catalog, or an area of 
a website that stores information about products in a database.
Websites change for site visitors depending on the type of 
information they request. Consider, for example, an automo­
bile dealer. The dealer would create a database containing data 
elements for each car it has available for sale including make, 
model, color, year, miles per gallon, a photograph, and so on. 
Website visitors might click on Porsche and then enter their 
specific requests such as price range or year made. Once the 
user hits “go” the website automatically provides a custom view 
of the requested information. The dealer must create, update, 
and delete automobile information as the inventory changes.
A data-driven website is an interactive website kept con­
stantly updated and relevant to the needs of its customers using 
a database. Data-driven capabilities are especially useful when 
a firm needs to offer large amounts of information, products, 
or services. Visitors can become quickly annoyed if they find 
themselves buried under an avalanche of information when 
searching a website. A data-driven website can help limit the 
amount of information displayed to customers based on unique 
search requirements. Companies even use data-driven websites 
to make information in their internal databases available to cus­
tomers and business partners.
There are a number of advantages to using the web to access 
company databases. First, web browsers are much easier to use 
than directly accessing the database using a custom-query tool. 
Second, the web interface requires few or no changes to the 
database model. Finally, it costs less to add a web interface in 
front of a DBMS than to redesign and rebuild the system to 
support changes. Additional data-driven website advantages 
include:
	∙	 Easy to manage content: Website owners can make changes 
without relying on MIS professionals; users can update a 
data-driven website with little or no training.
	∙	 Easy to store large amounts of data: Data-driven websites 
can keep large volumes of information organized. Website 
­owners can use templates to implement changes for lay­
outs, navigation, or website structure. This improves website 
­reliability, scalability, and performance.
	∙	 Easy to eliminate human errors: Data-driven websites trap 
data-entry errors, eliminating inconsistencies while ensuring 
all information is entered correctly.
Zappos credits its success as an online shoe retailer to its 
vast inventory of nearly 3 million products available through 
its dynamic data-driven website. The company built its data-
driven website catering to a specific niche market: consumers 
who were tired of finding that their most-desired items were 
always out of stock at traditional retailers. Zappos’ highly 
flexible, scalable, and secure database helped it rank as the 
most-available Internet retailer. Figure 6.10  displays Zappos 
data-driven website illustrating a user querying the database 
and receiving information that satisfies the user’s request.6
Companies can gain valuable business knowledge by view­
ing the data accessed and analyzed from their website. 
­Figure 6.11 displays how running queries or using analytical 
tools, such as a PivotTable, on the database that is attached to 
the website can offer insight into the business, such as items 
browsed, frequent requests, items bought together, and so on.

scattered across multiple systems with different file types (such 
as spreadsheets, databases, and even word processing files), 
making it almost impossible for anyone to use the information 
from multiple sources. Completing reporting requests across 
operational ­systems could take days or weeks using antiquated 
reporting tools that were ineffective for running a business. 
From this idea, the data warehouse was born as a place where 
relevant information could be stored and accessed for making 
strategic queries and reports.
A repository is a central location in which data is stored 
and managed. A data warehouse is a logical collection of 
­information—gathered from many different operational data­
bases—that supports business analysis activities and decision-
making tasks. The primary purpose of a data warehouse is to 
combine information, more specifically, strategic information, 
throughout an organization into a single repository in such a 
way that the people who need that information can make deci­
sions and undertake business analysis. A key idea within data 
warehousing is to collect information from multiple systems in a 
common location that uses a universal querying tool. This allows 
operational databases to run where they are most efficient for the 
business, while providing a common location using a familiar 
format for the strategic or enterprisewide reporting information.
Data warehouses go even a step further by standardizing infor­
mation. Gender, for instance can be referred to in many ways 
DATA 
WAREHOUSING  LO6.5
Applebee’s Neighborhood Grill & Bar posts annual sales in 
excess of $3.2 billion and is actively using information from its 
data warehouse to increase sales and cut costs. The company 
gathers daily information for the previous day’s sales into its 
data warehouse from 1,500 restaurants located in 49 states and 
seven countries. Understanding regional preferences, such as 
patrons in Texas preferring steaks more than patrons in 
New England, allows the company to meet its corporate 
strategy of being a neighborhood grill appealing to local 
tastes. The company has found tremendous value in its 
data warehouse by being able to make business decisions 
about customers’ regional needs. The company also uses 
data warehouse information to perform the following:
	∙	 Base labor budgets on actual number of guests 
served per hour.
	∙	 Develop promotional sale item analysis to help avoid 
losses from overstocking or understocking inventory.
	∙	 Determine theoretical and actual costs of food and 
the use of ingredients.
History of the Data Warehouse
In the 1990s as organizations began to need more timely 
information about their business, they found that tra­
ditional management information systems were too 
cumbersome to provide relevant information efficiently 
and effectively. Most of the systems were in the form 
of operational databases that were designed for specific 
business functions, such as accounting, order entry, cus­
tomer service, and sales, and were not appropriate for 
business analysis for the reasons shown in Figure 6.12.
During the latter half of the 20th century, the numbers 
and types of operational databases increased. Many 
large businesses found themselves with information

Data Mart
Data aggregation is the collec­
tion of data from various sources 
for the purpose of data processing. 
One example of a data aggrega­
tion is to gather information about 
particular groups based on specific 
variables such as age, profession, 
or income. Businesses collect a tre­
mendous amount of transactional 
information as part of their routine 
operations. Marketing, sales, and 
other departments would like to 
analyze these data to understand 
their operations better. Although 
databases store the details of all 
transactions (for instance, the sale 
of a product) and events (hiring a 
new employee), data warehouses 
store that same information but in an aggregated 
form more suited to supporting decision-making 
tasks. Aggregation, in this instance, can include 
totals, counts, averages, and the like.
The data warehouse modeled in Figure 6.14 
compiles information from internal databases 
(Male, Female, M/F, 1/0), but it should be standardized on a 
data warehouse with one common way of referring to each data 
element that stores gender (M/F). Standardization of data ele­
ments allows for greater accuracy, completeness, and consis­
tency and increases the quality of the information in making 
strategic business decisions. The data warehouse then is sim­
ply a tool that enables business users, typically managers, to be 
more effective in many ways, including:
	∙	 Developing customer profiles.
	∙	 Identifying new-product opportunities.
	∙	 Improving business operations.
	∙	 Identifying financial issues.
	∙	 Analyzing trends.
	∙	 Understanding competitors.
	∙	 Understanding product performance. (See Figure 6.13.)

company’s information overload problem. Once the employees 
began using the data marts, they were ecstatic at the wealth of 
information. Data marts were a huge success for Lands’ End.
Information Cleansing (or Scrubbing)
Maintaining quality information in a data warehouse or data 
mart is extremely important. The Data Warehousing Institute 
estimates that low-quality information costs U.S. businesses 
$600 billion annually. That number may seem high, but it is 
not. If an organization is using a data warehouse or data mart to 
allocate dollars across advertising strategies, low-quality infor­
mation will definitely have a negative impact on its ability to 
make the right decision.
Dirty data is erroneous or flawed data (see Figure 6.15). The 
complete removal of dirty data from a source is impractical or 
virtually impossible. According to Gartner Inc., dirty data is 
or transactional/operational data­
bases and external databases 
through extraction, transforma­
tion, and loading (ETL), which is 
a process that extracts information 
from internal and external data­
bases, transforms the information 
using a common set of enterprise 
definitions, and loads the infor­
mation into a data warehouse. 
The data warehouse then sends 
subsets of the information to data 
marts. A data mart contains a 
subset of data warehouse informa­
tion. To distinguish between data 
warehouses and data marts, think 
of data warehouses as having a 
more organizational focus and data 
marts as having focused information 
subsets particular to the needs of a 
given business unit such as finance 
or production and operations. Fig­
ure 6.14 provides an illustration of a 
data warehouse and its relationship 
to internal and external databases, 
ETL, and data marts.
Lands’ End created an organiza­
tion-wide data warehouse so all its 
employees could access organiza­
tional information. Lands’ End soon 
found out that there could be “too 
much of a good thing.” Many of its 
employees would not use the data 
warehouse because it was simply too 
big, was too complicated, and had too 
much irrelevant information. Lands’ 
End knew there was valuable infor­
mation in its data warehouse, and it 
had to find a way for its employees 
to easily access the information. Data 
marts were the perfect solution to the 
Butterfly Effects
The butterfly effect, an idea from 
chaos theory in mathematics, refers to 
the way a minor event—like the move­
ment of a butterfly’s wing—can have a major 
impact on a complex system like the weather. 
Dirty data can have the same impact on a 
business as the butterfly effect. Organizations 
depend on the movement and sharing of data 
throughout the organization, so the impact of 
data quality errors are costly and far-reaching. 
Such data issues often begin with a tiny mistake 
in one part of the organization, but the butterfly 
effect can produce disastrous results, making its 
way through MIS systems to the data warehouse 
and other enterprise systems. When dirty data 
or low-quality data enters organizational sys­
tems, a tiny error such as a spelling mistake can 
lead to revenue loss, process inefficiency, and 
failure to comply with industry and government 
regulations. Explain how the following errors 
can affect an organization:
	∙	 A cascading spelling mistake
	∙	 Inaccurate customer records
	∙	 Incomplete purchasing history
	∙	 Inaccurate mailing address
	∙	 Duplicate customer numbers for different 
customers

LO6.5  Describe the roles 
and purposes of data ware­
houses and data marts in an organization.
Achieving perfect information is almost impossible. 
The more complete and accurate an organization wants 
its information to be, the more it costs (see Figure 6.19). 
The trade-off for perfect information lies in accuracy 
versus completeness. Accurate information means it is 
correct, while complete information means there are no 
blanks. A birth date of 2/31/10 is an example of com­
plete but inaccurate information (February 31 does not 
exist). An address containing Denver, Colorado, with­
out a zip code is an example of incomplete information 
that is accurate. For their information, most organiza­
tions determine a percentage high enough to make good deci­
sions at a reasonable cost, such as 85 percent accurate and 65 
percent complete.
a business problem, not an MIS problem. Over the next two 
years, more than 25 percent of critical data in Fortune 1000 
companies will continue to be flawed; that is, the information 
will be inaccurate, incomplete, or duplicated.
Obviously, maintaining quality information in a data ware­
house or data mart is extremely important. To increase the qual­
ity of organizational information and thus the effectiveness of 
decision making, businesses must formulate a strategy to keep 
information clean. Information cleansing or scrubbing is a 
process that weeds out and fixes or discards inconsistent, incor­
rect, or incomplete information.
Specialized software tools exist that use sophisticated proce­
dures to analyze, standardize, correct, match, and consolidate 
data warehouse information. This step is vitally important 
because data warehouses often contain information from sev­
eral databases, some of which can be external to the organi­
zation. In a data warehouse, information cleansing occurs first 
during the ETL process and again once the information is in the 
data warehouse. Companies can choose information cleansing 
software from several vendors, including Oracle, SAS, IBM, 
and Tableau. Ideally, scrubbed information is accurate and 
consistent.
Looking at customer information highlights why informa­
tion cleansing is necessary. Customer information exists in 
several operational systems. In each system, all the details 
could change—from the customer ID to contact information—
depending on the business process the user is performing (see 
Figure 6.16).
Figure 6.17 displays a customer name entered differently in 
multiple operational systems. Information cleansing allows an 
organization to fix these types of inconsistencies and cleans

BUSINESS 
INTELLIGENCE  LO6.6
Many organizations today find it next to impossible to under­
stand their own strengths and weaknesses, let alone their 
biggest competitors’, because the enormous volume of orga­
nizational data is inaccessible to all but the MIS department. A 
data point is an individual item on a graph or a chart. Organi­
zational data includes far more than simple structured data ele­
ments in a database; the set of data also includes unstructured 
data such as voice mail, customer phone calls, text messages, 
video clips, along with numerous new forms of data, such as 
tweets from Twitter.
An early reference to business intelligence occurs in Sun Tzu’s 
book titled The Art of War. Sun Tzu claims that to succeed in 
war, one should have full knowledge of one’s own strengths 
and weaknesses and full knowledge of the enemy’s strengths 
and weaknesses. Lack of either one might result in defeat. A 
certain school of thought draws parallels between the chal­
lenges in business and those of war, specifically:
	∙	 Collecting information.
	∙	 Discerning patterns and meaning in the information.
	∙	 Responding to the resultant information.
Before the start of the information age in 
the late 20th century, businesses sometimes 
collected information from non-automated 
sources. Businesses then lacked the comput­
ing resources to properly analyze the infor­
mation and often made commercial decisions 
based primarily on intuition.  A data bro­
ker  is a business that collects personal 
information about consumers and sells that 
information to other organizations.
As businesses started automating more and more systems, 
more and more information became available. However, col­
lection remained a challenge due to a lack of infrastructure 
for information exchange or to incompatibilities between sys­
tems. Reports sometimes took months to generate. Such reports 
allowed informed long-term strategic decision making. How­
ever, short-term tactical decision making continued to rely on 
intuition. In modern businesses, increasing standards, automa­
tion, and technologies have led to vast amounts of available 
information. Data warehouse technologies have set up reposi­
tories to store this information. Improved ETL has increased 
the speedy collecting of information. Business intelligence 
has now become the art of sifting through large amounts of 
data, extracting information, and turning that information into 
actionable knowledge.
A data lake is a storage repository that holds a vast amount 
of raw data in its original format until the business needs it. 
While a traditional data warehouse stores data in files or fold­
ers, a data lake uses a flat architecture to store data. Each data 
element in a data lake is assigned a unique identifier and tagged 
with a set of extended metadata tags. When a business question 
arises, the data lake can be queried for all of the relevant data 
providing a smaller data set that can then be analyzed to help 
answer the question.

being data rich and information poor. Even 
in today’s electronic world, managers 
struggle with the challenge of turning their 
business data into business intelligence.
The Solution: Business 
Intelligence
Employee decisions are numerous and 
they include providing service informa­
tion, offering new products, and supporting 
frustrated customers. A data set is an orga­
nized collection of data. A comparative 
analysis can compare two or more data 
sets to identify patterns and trends. Employ­
ees can base their decisions on data sets, 
experience, or knowledge and preferably a 
combination of all three. Business intelligence can provide man­
agers with the ability to make better decisions. A few examples 
of how different industries use business intelligence include:
	∙	 Airlines: Analyze popular vacation locations with current 
flight listings.
	∙	 Banking: Understand customer credit card usage and non­
payment rates.
	∙	 Health care: Compare the demographics of patients with crit­
ical illnesses.
	∙	 Insurance: Predict claim amounts and medical coverage costs.
	∙	 Law enforcement: Track crime patterns, locations, and crimi­
nal behavior.
	∙	 Marketing: Analyze customer demographics.
	∙	 Retail: Predict sales, inventory levels, and distribution.
	∙	 Technology: Predict hardware failures.
Figure 6.20 displays how organizations using BI can find the 
cause to many issues and problems simply by asking “Why?” 
The process starts by analyzing a report such as sales amounts 
by quarter. Managers will drill down into the report looking for 
why sales are up or why sales are down. Once they understand 
why a certain location or product is experiencing an increase in 
sales, they can share the information in an effort to raise enter­
prisewide sales. Once they understand the cause for a decrease 
in sales, they can take effective action to resolve the issue. BI 
can help managers with competitive monitoring where a 
company keeps tabs of its competitor’s activities on the web 
using software that automatically tracks all competitor website 
The Problem: Data Rich, 
Information Poor
An ideal business scenario would be as follows: As a business 
manager on his way to meet with a client reviews historical 
customer data, he realizes that the client’s ordering volume 
has substantially decreased. As he drills down into the data, he 
notices the client had a support issue with a particular product. 
He quickly calls the support team to find out all of the informa­
tion and learns that a replacement for the defective part can be 
shipped in 24 hours. In addition, he learns that the client has 
visited the website and requested information on a new prod­
uct line. Armed with all this information, the business manager 
is prepared for a productive meeting with his client. He now 
understands the client’s needs and issues, and he can address 
new sales opportunities with confidence.
For many companies the above example is simply a pipe 
dream. Attempting to gather all of the client information would 
actually take hours or even days to compile. With so much data 
available, it is surprisingly hard for managers to get informa­
tion, such as inventory levels, past order history, or shipping 
details. Source data identifies the primary location where 
data is collected. Source data can include invoices, spread­
sheets, time-sheets, transactions, and electronic sources such 
as other databases. Managers send their information requests 
to the MIS department where a dedicated person compiles the 
various reports. In some situations, responses can take days, 
by which time the information may be outdated and opportuni­
ties lost. Many organizations find themselves in the position of

activities such as discounts and new products. Here are a few 
examples of how managers can use BI to answer tough busi­
ness questions:
	∙	 Where has the business been? Historical perspective offers 
important variables for determining trends and patterns.
	∙	 Where is the business now? Looking at the current business 
situation allows managers to take effective action to solve 
issues before they grow out of control.
	∙	 Where is the business going? Setting strategic direction is 
critical for planning and creating solid business strategies.
Ask a simple question—such as who is my best customer or 
what is my worst-selling product—and you might get as many 
answers as you have employees. Databases, data warehouses, 
and data marts can provide a single source of “trusted” data 
that can answer questions about customers, products, suppliers, 
production, finances, fraud, and even employees. A data map 
is a technique for establishing a match, or balance, between the 
source data and the target data warehouse. This technique iden­
tifies data shortfalls and recognizes data issues. They can also 
alert managers to inconsistencies or help determine the cause 
and effects of enterprisewide business decisions.
All business aspects can benefit from the added insights pro­
vided by business intelligence, and you, as a business student, 
will benefit from understanding how MIS can help you make 
data-driven decisions.  Data-driven decision management 
is an approach to business governance that values decisions 
that can be backed up with verifiable data. The success of the 
data-driven approach is reliant upon the quality of the data 
gathered and the effectiveness of 
its analysis and interpretation.
In the early days of computing, 
it usually took a specialist with a 
strong background in technology to 
mine data for information because 
it was necessary for that person to 
understand how databases and data 
warehouses worked. Today, busi­
ness intelligence tools often require 
very little, if any, support from the 
MIS department. Business manag­
ers can customize dashboards to 
display the data they want to see 
and run custom reports on the fly. 
The changes in how data can be mined and visualized allows 
business executives who have no technology backgrounds to be 
able to work with analytics tools and make data-driven decisions.
Data-driven decision management is usually undertaken as a 
way to gain a competitive advantage. A study from the MIT 
Center for Digital Business found that organizations driven most 
by data-based decision making had 4% higher productivity rates 
and 6% higher profits. However, integrating massive amounts of 
information from different areas of the business and combining 
it to derive actionable data in real time can be easier said than 
done. Errors can creep into data analytics processes at any stage 
of the endeavor, and serious issues can result when they do.

Follow the Data
T
here is a classic line in the movie All the 
President’s Men, which covers the Water­
gate investigation, where Deep Throat 
meets with Bob Woodward and 
coolly advises him to “follow the 
money.” Woodward follows the 
money, and the Watergate inves­
tigation ends with President Nix­
on’s resignation.
If you want to find out what 
is happening in today’s data­
filled world, you could probably 
change those words to “follow 
the data.” IDC reports that the 
amount of information stored in 
the digital universe is projected to 
hit nearly 1.8 zettabytes by 2011, 
representing a tenfold increase 
in five years. One of the new­
est forms of legal requirements 
emerging from the data explosion 
is ediscovery, the legal requirements mandat­
ing that an ­organization must archive all forms 
of software communications, including email, 
text messages, and ­multimedia. Yes, the text 
­message you sent four years ago could come 
back to haunt you.
Organizations 
today 
have 
more data than they know what 
to do with and are frequently over­
whelmed with data management. 
Getting at such data and present­
ing them in a useful manner for 
cogent analysis is a tremendous 
task that haunts managers. What 
do you think is involved in data 
management? What is contained 
in the zettabytes of data stored 
by organizations? Why would an 
organization store data? How long 
should an organization store its 
data? What are the risks associ­
ated with failing to store organiza­
tional data?

Virtualization
Virtualization is the creation of a virtual (rather than actual) 
version of computing resources, such as an operating system, a 
server, a storage device, or network resources (see Figure 6.25). 
With big data it is now possible to virtualize data so that it can 
be stored efficiently and cost-effectively. Improvements in net­
work speed and network reliability have removed the physical 
limitations of being able to manage massive amounts of data at 
an acceptable pace. The decrease in price of storage and com­
puter memory allow companies to leverage data that would 
have been inconceivable to collect only 10 years ago.
Analyzing Big Data
With the onset of big data, organizations are collecting more 
data than ever. Historically, data were housed in functional 
systems that were not integrated, such as customer service, 
THE POWER 
OF BIG 
DATA  LO6.7
Big data is a collection of large, 
complex data sets, including struc­
tured and unstructured data, which 
cannot be analyzed using tradi­
tional database methods and tools. 
Big data came into fruition primary 
due to the last 50 years of technology evolution. Revolutionary 
technological advances in software, hardware, storage, network­
ing, and computing models have transformed the data landscape, 
making new opportunities for data collection possible. Big data 
is one of the latest trends emerging from the convergence of 
technological factors. For example, cell phones generate tremen­
dous amounts of data and much of it is available for 
use with analytical applications. Big data includes data 
sources that include extremely large volumes of data, 
with high velocity, wide variety, and an understanding 
of the data veracity. The four common characteristics 
of big data are detailed in Figure 6.21 and Figure 6.22.
The move to big data combines business with science, 
research, and government activities. A company can 
now analyze petabytes of data for patterns, trends, 
and anomalies gaining insights into data in new and 
exciting ways. A petabyte of data is equivalent to 
20 million four-drawer file cabinets filled with text 
files or 13 years of HDTV content. Big data requires 
sophisticated tools to analyze all of the structured 
and unstructured data from millions of customers, 
devices, and machine interactions (see Figure 6.23). 
The two primary computing models that have shaped 
the collection of big data include distributed comput­
ing and vitalization.
Distributed Computing
Distributed computing processes and manages 
algorithms across many machines in a computing 
environment (see ­Figure 6.24). A key component of 
big data is a distributed computing environment that 
shares resources ranging from memory to networks 
to storage. With distributed computing individual 
computers are networked together across geographi­
cal areas and work together to execute a workload or 
computing processes as if they were one single com­
puting environment. For example, you can distribute 
a set of programs on the same physical server and 
use a message service to allow them to communicate 
and pass information. You can also have a distrib­
uted computing environment where many different 
­systems or servers, each with its own computing 
memory, work together to solve a common problem.

2 Trillion Rows of Data 
­Analyzed Daily — No Problem
eBay is the world’s largest online marketplace, 
with 97 million global users selling anything to 
anyone at a yearly total of $62 billion—more 
than $2,000 every second. Of course with this 
many sales, eBay is collecting the equivalent 
Living the
of the Library of Congress worth of data every 
three days that must be analyzed to run the 
business successfully. Luckily, eBay discovered 
Tableau!
Tableau started at Stanford when Chris 
Stolte, a computer scientist; Pat Hanrahan, an 
Academy Award–winning professor; and Chris­
tian Chabot, a savvy business leader, decided 
to solve the problem of helping ordinary people 
understand big data. The three created Tab­
leau, which bridged two computer science 
disciplines: computer graphics and databases. 
No more need to write code or understand the 
relational database keys and categories; users 
simply drag and drop pictures of what they want 
to analyze. Tableau has become one of the 
most successful data visualization tools on the 
market, winning multiple awards, international 
expansion, and millions in revenue and spawn­
ing multiple new inventions.7
Tableau is revolutionizing business analyt­
ics, and this is only the beginning. Visit the 
Tableau website and become familiar with the 
tool by watching a few of the demos. Once you 
have a good understanding of the tool, create 
three questions eBay might be using Tableau to 
answer, including the analysis of its sales data to 
find patterns, business insights, and trends.
DATA MINING  LO6.8
Reports piled on a manager’s desk provide summaries of past 
business activities and stock market data. Unfortunately, these 
reports don’t offer much insight into why these things are hap­
pening or what might happen over the next few months. Data 
mining to the rescue! Data mining is the process of analyzing 
data to extract information not offered by the raw data alone. 
Data mining can also begin at a summary information level 
(coarse granularity) and progress through increasing levels of 
detail (drilling down) or the reverse (drilling up). Companies 
use data mining techniques to compile a complete picture of 
their operations, all within a single view, allowing them to 
identify trends and improve forecasts. The three elements of 
data mining include:
	1.	 Data: Foundation for data-directed decision making.
	2.	 Discovery: Process of identifying new patterns, trends, and 
insights.
	3.	 Deployment:  Process of implementing discoveries to drive 
success.
One retailer discovered that loyalty program customers 
spent more over time and it strategically invested in specific 

CHAPTER 6  |  Data: Business Intelligence  173
marketing campaigns focusing on these high spenders, thereby 
maximizing revenue and reducing marketing costs. One manu­
facturer discovered a sequence of events that preceded acciden­
tal releases of toxic chemicals, allowing the factory to remain 
operational while it prevented dangerous accidents. One insur­
ance company discovered that one of its offices was able to 
process certain common claim types more quickly than others 
of comparable size. Armed with this valuable information the 
company mimicked this office’s best practices across its entire 
organization, improving customer service.
Data Mining Process Model
Data mining is a continuous process or cycle of activity where 
you continually revisit the problems with new projects. This 
allows past models to be effectively reused to look for new 
opportunities in the present and future. Data mining allows 
users to recycle their work to become more effective and effi­
cient on solving future problems. It is similar to creating a 
household budget and reusing the same basic budget year after 
year even though expenses and income change. There are six 
primary phases in the data-mining process, outlined in ­Figure 
6.27 and detailed in Figure 6.28.
Data Mining Analysis 
Techniques
Data profiling is the process of collect­
ing statistics and information about data 
in an existing source. Insights extracted 
from data profiling can determine how 
easy or difficult it will be to use exist­
ing data for other purposes along with 
providing metrics on data quality. Data 
replication is the process of shar­
ing information to ensure consistency 
between multiple data sources. Data min­
ing can determine relationships among 
such internal factors as price, product 
positioning, or staff skills, and exter­
nal factors such as economic indicators, 
competition, and customer demograph­
ics. In addition, it can determine the 
impact on sales, customer satisfaction, 
and corporate profits and drill down into 
summary information to view detailed 
transactional data. With data mining, a 
retailer could use point-of-sale records of customer purchases 
to send targeted promotions based on an individual’s purchase 
history. By mining demographic data from comment or war­
ranty cards, the retailer could develop products and promotions 
to appeal to specific customer segments.
A recommendation engine is a data-mining algorithm that 
analyzes a customer’s purchases and actions on a website and 
then uses the data to recommend complementary products. 
Netflix uses a recommendation engine to analyze each cus­
tomer’s film-viewing habits to provide recommendations for 
other customers with Cinematch, its movie recommendation 
system. Using Cinematch, Netflix can present customers with 
a number of additional movies they might want to watch based 
on the customer’s current preferences. Netflix’s innovative use 
of data mining provides its competitive advantage in the movie 
rental industry. Figure 6.29 displays the common data-mining 
techniques used to perform advanced analytics such as Netf­
lix’s Cinematch.

ducing a new product line.

Unethical Data Mining
Mining large amounts of data can create a number of benefits for busi­
ness, society, and governments, but it can also create a number of 
ethical questions surrounding an invasion of privacy or misuse of infor­
mation. Facebook recently came under fire for its data mining practices 
as it followed 700,000 accounts to determine whether posts with highly 
emotional content are more contagious. The study concluded that highly 
emotional texts are contagious, just as with real people. Highly emotional 
positive posts received multiple positive replies whereas highly emo­
tional negative posts received multiple negative replies. Although the 
study seems rather innocent, many Facebook users were outraged; they 
felt the study was an invasion of privacy because the 700,000 accounts 
had no idea Facebook was mining their posts. As a Facebook user, you 
willingly consent that Facebook owns every bit and byte of data you post 
and, once you press submit, Facebook can do whatever it wants with 
your data. Do you agree or disagree that Facebook has the right to do 
whatever it wants with the data its 1.5 billion users post on its site?8
patterns of these events, for example, “55 percent of the time, 
events A and B occurred together” or “80 percent of the time 
that items A and B occurred together, they were followed by 
item C within three days.”
One of the most common forms of association detection 
­analysis is market basket analysis. Market basket analysis 
evaluates such items as websites and checkout scanner infor­
mation to detect customers’ buying behavior and predict future 
behavior by identifying affinities among customers’ choices of 
products and services (see Figure 6.30). Market basket analysis 
is frequently used to develop marketing campaigns for cross-
selling products and services (especially in banking, insurance, 
and finance) and for inventory control, shelf-product place­
ment, and other retail and marketing applications.
Cluster Analysis  Cluster analysis is a technique used 
to divide an information set into mutually exclusive groups 
such that the members of each group are as close together as 
possible to one another and the different groups are as far apart 
as possible. Cluster analysis identifies similarities and differ­
ences among data sets allowing similar data sets to be clus­
tered together. A customer database includes attributes such 
as name and address, demographic information such as gender 
and age, and financial attributes such as income and revenue 
spent. A cluster analysis groups similar attributes together to 
discover ­segments or clusters, and then examine the attributes

and values that define the clusters 
or segments. Marketing manag­
ers can drive promotion strategies 
that target the specific group iden­
tified by the cluster analysis (see 
Figure 6.31).
A great example of using cluster 
analysis in business is to create 
target-marketing strategies based 
on zip codes. Evaluating customer 
segments by zip code allows a busi­
ness to assign a level of importance 
to each segment. Zip codes offer 
valuable insight into such things as 
income levels, demographics, life­
styles, and spending habits. With 
target marketing, a business can decrease its costs while increas­
ing the success rate of the marketing campaign.
Classification Analysis  Classification analysis is 
the process of organizing data into categories or groups for its 
most effective and efficient use. For example, groups of political 
affiliation and charity donors. The primary goal of a classifica­
tion analysis is not to explore data to find interesting segments, 
but to decide the best way to classify records. It is important 
to note that classification analysis is similar to cluster analysis 
because it segments data into distinct segments called classes; 
however, unlike cluster analysis, a classification analysis 
requires that all classes are defined before the analysis begins. 
For example, in a classification analysis the analyst defines two 
classes: (1) a class for customers who default on a loan; (2) a 
class for customers who did not default on a loan. Cluster analy­
sis is exploratory analysis and classification analysis is much 
less exploratory and more grouping. (See Figure 6.32.)
Data Mining Modeling Techniques 
for Predictions
To perform data mining, users need data mining tools. Data 
mining tools use a variety of techniques to find patterns and 
relationships in large volumes of information that predict future 
behavior and guide decision making. Data mining uncovers 
trends and patterns, which analysts use to build models that, when 
exposed to new information sets, perform a variety of informa­
tion analysis functions. Data-mining tools for data warehouses 
help users uncover business intelligence in their data. Data min­
ing uncovers patterns and trends for business analysis such as:
	∙	 Analyzing customer buying patterns to predict future market­
ing and promotion campaigns.
	∙	 Building budgets and other financial information.
	∙	 Detecting fraud by identifying deceptive spending patterns.
	∙	 Finding the best customers who spend the most money.
	∙	 Keeping customers from leaving or migrating to competitors.
	∙	 Promoting and hiring employees to ensure success for both 
the company and the individual.

LO6.8  Explain data mining and identify 
the three elements of data mining.

178  MODULE 2  |  Technical Foundations of MIS
DATA ANALYSIS  LO6.9
A relational database contains information in a series of two-
dimensional tables. With big data information is multidimen­
sional, meaning it contains layers of columns and rows. A 
dimension is a particular attribute of information. Each layer in 
big data represents information according to an additional dimen­
sion. A cube is the common term for the representation of mul­
tidimensional information. Figure 6.34 displays a cube (cube a) 
that represents store information (the layers), product informa­
tion (the rows), and promotion information (the columns).
Once a cube of information is created, users can begin to slice 
and dice the cube to drill down into the information. The sec­
ond cube (cube b) in Figure 6.34 displays a slice representing 
promotion II information for all products, at all stores. The 
third cube (cube c) in Figure 6.34 displays only information for 
promotion III, product B, at store 2. By using multidimensional 
analysis, users can analyze information in a number of differ­
ent ways and with any number of different dimensions. For 
example, users might want to add dimensions of information to 
a current analysis including product category, region, and even 
forecasts for actual weather. The true value of big data is its 
ability to provide multidimensional analysis that allows users 
to gain insights into their information.
Big data is ideal for off-loading some of the querying against 
a database. For example, querying a database to obtain an 
average of sales for product B at store 2 while promotion III is 
under way might create a considerable processing burden for 
a database, essentially slowing down the time it takes another 
person to enter a new sale into the same database. If an orga­
nization performs numerous queries against a database (or 
multiple databases), aggregating that information into big data 
databases could be beneficial.
Advanced Data Analytics
Algorithms  are mathematical formulas placed in software 
that performs an analysis on a data set. Analytics is the sci­
ence of fact-based decision making. Analytics uses software-
based algorithms and statistics to derive meaning from data. 
Advanced analytics uses data patterns to make forward-looking 
predictions to explain to the organization where it is headed. 
Anomaly detection is the process of identifying rare or unex­
pected items or events in a data set that do not conform to other 
items in the data set. One of the key advantages of performing 
advanced analytics is to detect anomalies in the data to ensure 
they are not used in models creating false results. An outlier is 
a data value that is numerically distant from most of the other 
data points in a set of data. Anomaly detection helps to identify 
outliers in the data that can cause problems with mathematical 
modeling.
Fast data is the application of big data analytics to smaller 
data sets in near-real or real-time in order to solve a problem

or create business value. The term fast data is often associated 
with business intelligence and the goal is to quickly gather 
and mine structured and unstructured data so that action can 
be taken. As the flood of data from sensors, actuators and 
machine-to-machine (M2M) communication in the Internet 
of Things (IoT) continues to grow, it has become more impor­
tant than ever for organizations to identify what data is time-­
sensitive and should be acted upon right away and what data 
can sit in a data warehouse or data lake until there is a reason 
to mine it.
A data scientist extracts knowledge from data by perform­
ing statistical analysis, data mining, and advanced analytics on 
big data to identify trends, market changes, and other relevant 
information. Figure 6.35 displays the techniques a data scientist 
will use to perform big data advanced analytics.
Data Visualization
Traditional bar graphs and pie charts are boring and at best con­
fusing and at worst misleading. As databases and graphics collide 
more and more, people are creating infographics, which display 
information graphically so it can be easily understood.  Info­
graphics (information graphics) present the results of data 
analysis, displaying the patterns, relationships, and trends in a 
graphical format. Infographics are exciting and quickly convey 
a story users can understand without having to analyze numbers, 
tables, and boring charts (see Figure 6.36 and Figure 6.37).
A data artist is a business analytics specialist who uses visual 
tools to help people understand complex data. Great data visu­
alizations provide insights into something new about the under­
lying patterns and relationships. Just think of the periodic table 
of elements and imagine if you had to look at an Excel spread­
sheet showing each element and the associated attributes in a 
table format. This would be not only difficult to understand 
but easy to misinterpret. By placing the elements in the visual 
periodic table, you quickly grasp how the elements relate and 
the associated hierarchy and data artists are experts at creating 
a story from the information. Infographics perform the same 
function for business data as the periodic table does for chemi­
cal elements.
Analysis paralysis occurs when the user goes into an emo­
tional state of over-analysis (or over-thinking) a situation so 
that a decision or action is never taken, in effect paralyzing the 
outcome. In the time of big data, analysis paralysis is a grow­
ing problem. One solution is to use data visualizations to help 
people make decisions faster. Data visualization describes

technologies that allow users 
to see or visualize data to 
transform information into 
a business perspective. Data 
visualization is a powerful 
way to simplify complex 
data sets by placing data 
in a format that is easily 
grasped and understood far 
quicker than the raw data 
alone. Data visualization 
tools move beyond Excel 
graphs 
and

into 
sophisticated analysis tech­
niques such as controls, 
instruments, 
maps, 
time-

Data visualization tools can 
help uncover correlations 
and trends in data that would 
otherwise go unrecognized.
Business intelligence dashboards track corporate 
metrics such as critical success factors and key perfor­
mance indicators and include advanced capabilities such 
as interactive controls, allowing users to manipulate data 
for analysis. The majority of business intelligence soft­
ware vendors offer a number of data visualization tools 
and business intelligence dashboards.
Big data is one of the most promising technology trends 
occurring today. Of course, notable companies such as 
Facebook, Google, and Netflix are gaining the most busi­
ness insights from big data currently, but many smaller 
markets are entering the scene, including retail, insur­
ance, and health care. Over the next decade, as big data 
starts to improve your everyday life by providing insights 
into your social relationships, habits, and careers, you can 
expect to see the need for data scientists and data artists 
dramatically increase. ■

News Dots
Gone are the days of staring 
at boring spreadsheets and trying to 
understand how the data correlate. With 
innovative data visualization tools, managers 
can arrange different ways to view the data, 
providing new forms of pattern recognition not 
offered by simply looking at numbers. Slate, a 
news publication, developed a new data visual­
ization tool called News Dots, that offers read­
ers a different way of viewing the daily news 
through trends and patterns. The News Dots tool 
scans about 500 stories a day from major publi­
cations and then tags the content with important 
keywords such as people, places, companies, 
and topics. Surprisingly, the majority of daily 
news overlaps as the people, places, and stories 
are frequently connected. Using News Dots, you 
can visualize how the news fits together, almost 
similar to a giant social network. News Dots 
uses circles (or dots) to represent the tagged 
content and arranges them according to size. 
The more frequently a certain topic is tagged, 
the larger the dot and its relationship to other 
dots. The tool is interactive and users simply 
click a dot to view which stories mention that 
topic and which other topics it connects to in the 
network such as a correlation among the U.S. 
government, Federal Reserve, Senate, bank, 
and Barack Obama.9
How can data visualization help identify 
trends? What types of business intelligence 
could you identify if your college used a data

you identify if you used a data visualization tool 
to analyze the industry in which you plan to

THE CONNECTED 
WORLD  LO7.1
Computer networks are continuously operating all over the globe 
supporting our 24/7/365 always on and always connected life­
styles. You are probably using several different networks right 
now without even realizing it. You might be using a school’s 
network to communicate with teachers, a phone network to 
communicate with friends, and a cable network to watch TV 
or listen to the radio. Networks enable telecommunications or 
the exchange of information (voice, text, data, audio, video). 
The telecommunication industry has morphed from a govern­
ment-regulated monopoly to a deregulated market where many 
suppliers ferociously compete. Competing telecommunication 
companies offer local and global telephony services, satellite ser­
vice, mobile radio, cable television, cellular phone services, and 
Internet access (all of which are detailed in this chapter). Busi­
nesses everywhere are increasingly using networks to commu­
nicate and collaborate with customers, partners, suppliers, and 
employees. As a manager, you will face many different commu­
nication alternatives, and the focus of this chapter is to provide 
you with an initial understanding of the different networking ele­
ments you will someday need to select (see Figure 7.1).

with the ability to operate inde­
pendently of, or in harmony with, 
the others. Keeping the Internet 
operational is no simple task. No 
one owns or runs it, but it does 
have an organized network topol­
ogy. The Internet is a hierarchical 
structure linking different levels 
of service providers, whose mil­
lions of devices, LANs, WANs, 
and MANs supply all the inter­
connections. At the top of the 
hierarchy are national service 
providers (NSPs), private com­
panies that own and maintain the 
worldwide backbone that sup­
ports the ­Internet. These include 
Sprint, Verizon, MCI (previously 
UUNet/WorldCom), 
AT&T, 
NTT, Level3, Century Link, and 
Cable & Wireless Worldwide. 
Network access points (NAPs) are 
traffic exchange points in the rout­
ing hierarchy of the Internet that 
connects NSPs. They typically 
have regional or national coverage 
and connect to only a few NSPs. 
Thus, to reach a large portion of 
the global Internet, a NAP needs 
to route traffic through one of the 
NSPs to which it is connected.1
One step down in the hierarchy 
is the regional service provider. 
Regional 
service 
providers 
(RSPs) offer Internet service by 
connecting to NSPs, but they also 
can connect directly to each other. 
Another level down is an Internet 
service provider (ISP), which spe­
cializes in providing management, 
support, and maintenance to a net­
work. ISPs vary services provided 
and available bandwidth rates. 
ISPs link to RSPs and, if they 
are geographically close, to other 
ISPs. Some also connect directly 
to NSPs, thereby sidestepping the 
hierarchy. Individuals and companies use local ISPs to connect 
to the Internet, and large companies tend to connect directly 
using an RSP. Major ISPs in the United States include AOL, 
AT&T, Comcast, Earthlink, and NetZero. The further up the 
hierarchy, the faster the connections and the greater the band­
width. The backbone shown in Figure 7.3 is greatly simplified, 
but it illustrates the concept that basic global interconnections 
are provided by the NSPs, RSPs and ISPs.2
Network Categories
The general idea of a network is to allow multiple devices 
to communicate at the highest achievable speeds and, very 
importantly, to reduce the cost of connecting. How a particu­
lar network achieves these goals depends in part on how it is 
physically constructed and connected. Networks are catego­
rized based on geographic span: local area networks, wide area 
networks, and metropolitan area networks. Today’s business 
networks include a combination of all three.
A local area network (LAN) connects a group of comput­
ers in close proximity, such as in an office building, school, or 
home. LANs allow sharing of files, printers, games, and other 
resources. A LAN also often connects to other LANs, and to 
wide area networks. A wide area network (WAN) spans a 
large geographic area such as a state, province, or country. 
Perhaps the best example is the Internet. WANs are essential 
for carrying out the day-to-day activities of many companies 
and government organizations, allowing them to transmit and 
receive information among their employees, customers, sup­
pliers, business partners, and other organizations across cities, 
regions, and countries and around the world. In networking, 
attenuation represents the loss of a network signal strength 
measured in decibels (dB) and occurs because the transmis­
sions gradually dissipate in strength over longer distances or 
because of radio interference or physical obstructions such as 
walls. A repeater receives and repeats a signal to extend its 
attenuation or range.
WANs often connect multiple smaller networks, such as local 
area networks or metropolitan area networks. A metropolitan 
area network (MAN) is a large computer network usually 
spanning a city. Most colleges, universities, and large compa­
nies that span a campus use an infrastructure supported by a 
MAN. Figure 7.2 shows the relationships and a few differences 
between a LAN, WAN, and MAN. A cloud image often repre­
sents the Internet or some large network environment.
While LANs, WANs, and MANs all provide users with an 
accessible and reliable network infrastructure, they differ in 
many dimensions; two of the most important are cost and per­
formance. It is easy to establish a network between two com­
puters in the same room or building, but much more difficult if 
they are in different states or even countries. This means some­
one looking to build or support a WAN either pays more or 
gets less performance, or both. Ethernet is the most common 
connection type for wired networking and is available in speeds 
from 10 Mbps all the way up to 10,000 Mbps (10 Gbit). The 
most common wire used for Ethernet networking is Cat5 (Cat­
egory 5) and the connectors used are RJ45, slightly larger than 
the RJ11 connectors used by phones, but the same shape.
Network Providers
The largest and most important network, the Internet has 
evolved into a global information superhighway. Think of it 
as a network made up of millions of smaller networks, each

Network Access Technologies
Performance is the ultimate goal of any computer, com­
puter system, or network. Performance is directly related 
to the network’s speed of data transfer and capacity to 
handle transmission. A network that does not offer ade­
quate performance simply will not get the job done for 
those who rely on it. Luckily, networks can be upgraded 
and expanded if performance is inadequate.
We measure network performance 
in terms of bandwidth, the maxi­
mum amount of data that can pass 
from one point to another in a unit of 
time. Bandwidth is similar to water 
traveling through a hose. If the hose 
is large, water can flow through it 
quickly. Data differs from a hose in 
that it must travel great distances, 
especially on a WAN, and not all 
areas of the network have the same 
bandwidth. A network essentially 
has many different hoses of unequal

DSL has two major advantages over 
dial-up. First, it can transmit and 
receive data much faster—in the 1 to 
2 Mbps range for downloading and 
128 Kbps to 1 Mbps for uploading. 
(Most high-speed connections are 
designed to download faster than 
they upload, because most users 
download more—including view­
ing web pages—than they upload.) 
The second major advantage is that 
because they have an “always on” 
connection to their ISP, users can 
simultaneously talk on the phone 
and access the Internet. DSL’s disad­
vantages are that it works over a lim­
ited physical distance and remains 
unavailable in many areas where the 
local telephone infrastructure does 
not support DSL technology.4
While dial-up and DSL use local tele­
phone infrastructure, high-speed 
Internet cable connections pro­
vide Internet access using a cable 
television company’s infrastructure 
and a special cable modem. A cable 
modem (or broadband modem) 
is a type of digital modem used with 
high-speed cable Internet service. 
Cable modems connect a home com­
puter (or network of home comput­
ers) to residential cable TV service, 
while DSL modems connect to resi­
dential public telephone service. The 
ISP typically supplies the cable and 
DSL modems. Cisco Systems is one 
of the largest companies producing 
computer networking products and 
services, including the Linksys brand 
of networking components. Typi­
cally, broadband or high-speed Inter­
net service has an average transfer 
rate 10 times faster than conventional dial-up service. Telecom­
muting (virtual workforce) allows users to work from remote 
locations, such as home or a hotel, using high-speed Internet to 
access business applications and data.
capacity connected together, which will restrict the flow of 
data when one is smaller than the others. Therefore, the speed 
of transmission of a network is determined by the speed of its 
smallest bandwidth.
A bit (short for binary digit) is the smallest element of data 
and has a value of either 0 or 1. Bandwidth is measured in 
terms of bit rate (or data rate), the number of bits transferred 
or received per unit of time. Figure 7.4 represents bandwidth 
speeds in terms of bit rates. Bandwidth is typically given in bits 
per second (abbreviated as bps) and bytes per second (abbrevi­
ated as Bps). It is important to note that these two terms are not 
interchangeable.
A modem is a device that enables a computer to transmit and 
receive data. A connection with a traditional telephone line 
and a modem, which most residential users had in the 1990s, 
is called dial-up access. Today, many users in underdeveloped 
countries and in rural areas in developed countries still use dial-
up. It has two drawbacks. First, it is slow, providing a maxi­
mum rate of 56 Kbps. (At 56 Kbps, it takes eight minutes to 
download a three-minute song and more than a day to down­
load a two-hour movie.) Second, dial-up modem access ties up 
the telephone line so the user cannot receive and make phone 
calls while online. The good news is this is not as big an issue 
as it once was as many people have cell phones and no longer 
require using the telephone line for making phone calls.3
Once the most common connection method worldwide, dialup 
is quickly being replaced by broadband. Broadband is a high-
speed Internet connection that is always connected. High-speed 
in this case refers to any bandwidth greater than 2 Mbps. Not 
long ago, broadband speeds were available only at a pre­
mium price to support large companies’ high-traffic networks. 
Today, inexpensive access is available for home use and small 
companies.
The two most prevalent types of broadband access are digital 
subscriber lines and high-speed Internet cable connections. 
Digital subscriber line (DSL) provides high-speed digital 
data transmission over standard telephone lines using broad­
band modem technology, allowing both Internet and telephone 
services to work over the same phone lines. Consumers typi­
cally obtain DSL Internet access from the same company that 
provides their wired local telephone access, such as AT&T or 
Century Link. Thus, a customer’s telephone provider is also 
its ISP, and the telephone line carries both data and telephone 
signals using a DSL modem. DSL Internet services are used 
primarily in homes and small businesses.

modems. BPL works by transmitting data over electrical lines 
using signaling frequencies higher than the electrical (or voice 
in the case of DSL) signals. BPL allows computer data to be 
sent back and forth across the network with no disruption to 
power output in the home. Many homeowners are surprised to 
learn that their electrical system can serve as a home network 
running speeds between 1 and 3 Mbps with full Internet access. 
Unfortunately, limitations such as interference and availability 
have affected BPL’s popularity.
Network Protocols
A packet is a single unit of binary data routed through a net­
work. Packets directly impact network performance and reli­
ability by subdividing an electronic message into smaller, more 
manageable packets. Standard packet formats include a 
packet header, packet body containing the original message, 
and packet footer. The packet header lists the destination (for 
example, in IP packets the destination is the IP address) along 
with the length of the message data. The packet footer rep­
resents the end of the packet or transmission end. The packet 
header and packet footer contain error-checking information to 
ensure the entire message is sent and received. The receiving 
device reassembles the individual packets into the original by 
stripping off the headers and footers and then piecing together 
the packets in the correct sequence. Traceroute is a utility 
application that monitors the network path of packet data sent 
to a remote computer. Traceroute programs send a series of test 
messages over the network (using the name or IP address) until 
the last message finally reaches its destination. When finished, 
traceroute displays the path from the initial computer to the 
Unlike DSL, high-speed Internet cable is a shared service, 
which means everyone in a certain radius, such as a neighbor­
hood, shares the available bandwidth. Therefore, if several 
users are simultaneously downloading a video file, the actual 
transfer rate for each will be significantly lower than if only 
one person were doing so. On average, the available bandwidth 
using cable can range from 512 Kbps to 50 Mbps for down­
loading and 786 Kbps for uploading.5
Another alternative to DSL or high-speed Internet cable is dedi­
cated communications lines leased from AT&T or another pro­
vider. The most common are T1 lines, a type of data connection 
able to transmit a digital signal at 1.544 Mpbs. Although this 
speed might not seem impressive, and T1 lines are more expen­
sive than DSL or cable, they offer far greater reliability because 
each is composed of 24 channels, creating 24 separate connec­
tions through one line. If a company has three separate plants 
that experience a high volume of data traffic, it might make 
sense to lease lines for reliability of service.6
A company must match its needs with Internet access methods. 
If it always needs high bandwidth access to communicate with 
customers, partners, or suppliers, a T1 line may be the most 
cost-effective method. Figure 7.5 provides an overview of the 
main methods for Internet access. The bandwidths in the fig­
ure represent average speeds; actual speeds vary depending 
upon the service provider and other factors such as the type of 
cabling and speed of the computer.7
Broadband over power line (BPL) technology makes pos­
sible high-speed Internet access over ordinary residential elec­
trical lines and offers an alternative to DSL or high-speed cable

could not detect which individual 
device a request should be sent to.
One of the most valuable charac­
teristics of TCP/IP is how scal­
able its protocols have proven to 
be as the Internet has grown from 
a small network with just a few 
machines to a huge internetwork 
with millions of devices. While 
some changes have been required 
periodically 
to 
support 
this 
growth, the core of TCP/IP is the 
same as it was more than 25 years 
ago.8 Dynamic host configura­
tion protocol (DHCP) allows 
dynamic IP address allocation so 
users do not have to have a pre­
configured IP address to use the 
network. DHCP allows a com­
puter to access and locate infor­
mation about a computer on the 
server, enabling users to locate 
and renew their IP address. ISPs 
usually use DHCP to allow cus­
tomers to join the Internet with 
minimum effort. DHCP assigns 
unique IP addresses to devices, 
then releases and renews these 
addresses as devices leave and 
return to the network.
If there is one flaw in TCP/IP, it 
is the complexity of IP addresses. 
This is why we use a domain 
name system (DNS) to convert 
IP addresses into domains, or 
identifying labels that use a vari­
ety of recognizable naming con­
ventions. Therefore, instead of 
trying to remember 97.17.237.15, 
users can simply specify a domain 
name to access a computer or 
website, such as www.apple.com. 
Figure 7.7 lists the most common 
Internet domains.10
destination computer. A proxy is software that prevents direct 
communication between a sending and receiving computer and 
is used to monitor packets for security reasons.
A protocol is a standard that specifies the format of data as 
well as the rules to be followed during transmission. Comput­
ers using the same protocol can communicate easily, providing 
accessibility, scalability, and connectability between networks. 
File transfer protocol (FTP) is a simple network protocol that 
allows the transfer of files between two computers on the Inter­
net. To transfer files with FTP, the FTP client program initiates 
a connection to a remote computer running FTP “server” soft­
ware. After completing the connection the client can choose to 
send and/or receive files electronically. Network access tech­
nologies use a standard Internet protocol called transmission 
­control ­protocol/­Internet protocol (TCP/IP), which provides 
the technical foundation for the public Internet as well as for large 
numbers of private networks. One of the primary reasons for 
developing TCP/IP was to allow diverse or differing networks to 
connect and communicate with each other, essentially allowing 
LANs, WANs, and MANs to grow with each new connection. 
An IP address is a unique number that identifies where comput­
ers are located on the network. IP addresses appear in the form 
of xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, though each grouping can be as short as a 
single digit.
TCP (the TCP part of TCP/IP) verifies the correct delivery of 
data because data can become corrupt when traveling over a 
network. TCP ensures the size of the data packet is the same 
throughout its transmission and can even retransmit data until 
delivered correctly. IP (the IP part of TCP/IP) verifies the data 
are sent to the correct IP address, numbers represented by four 
strings of numbers ranging from 0 to 255 separated by periods. 
For example, the IP address of www.apple.com is 97.17.237.15.
Here is another way to understand TCP/IP. Consider a letter 
that needs to go from the University of Denver to Apple’s head­
quarters in Cupertino, California. TCP makes sure the envelope 
is delivered and does not get lost along the way. IP acts as the 
sending and receiving labels, telling the letter carrier where to 
deliver the envelope and whom it was from. The Postal Service 
mainly uses street addresses and zip codes to get letters to their 
destinations, which is really what IP does with its addressing 
method. Figure 7.6 illustrates this example. However, unlike 
the Postal Service, which allows multiple people to share the 
same physical address, each device using an IP address to 
connect to the Internet must have a unique address or else it

old female, was disqualified 
from her first place spot in 
the Lakefront Marathon in Milwau­
kee after race officials spotted her 
using an iPod. Officials nullified 
Goebel’s first place time of 3:02:50 
because of a controversial 2007 
rule put into place banning head­
phones or portable music devices 
by U.S. Track and Field (USTAF), 
the governing body for running 
events. Race officials only decided 
to take action after viewing online 
photos of Goebel using her iPod 
during the last part of the race. The 
interesting part of this story—Goe­
ble posted the photos herself on 
her website. USTAF claims the ban 
is required because music could 
give some runners a competitive 
advantage, as well as safety con­
cerns when runners can’t hear race 
announcements.
Do you agree with the USTAF’s 
decision to disqualify Jennifer Goe­

so many wireless devices entering 
the market, it is almost impossible 
to keep up with the surrounding

In part due to the explosive use of the Internet and connectivity 
of TCP/IP, there is a convergence of network devices, applica­

web surfing, videoconference applications, online gaming, and 
ebusiness. Network convergence is the efficient coexistence 
of telephone, video, and data communication within a single 
network, offering convenience and flexibility not possible with 
separate infrastructures. Almost any type of information can be 
The list of domain names is 
expected to expand in the coming 
years to include entities such as 
.pro (for accountants, lawyers, and 
physicians), .aero (for the air-transport industry), and .museum 
(for museums). The creation of an .xxx domain was recently 
approved for pornographic content. Countries also have domain 
names such as .au (Australia), .fr (France), and .sp (Spain).
Websites with heavy traffic often have several computers 
working together to share the load of requests. This offers load 
balancing and fault tolerance, so when requests are made to a 
popular site such as www.facebook.com, they will not over­
load a single computer and the site does not go down if one 
computer fails. A single computer can also have several host 
names—for instance, if a company is hosting several websites 
on a single server, much as an ISP works with hosting.
Domain names are essentially rented, with renewable rights, 
from a domain name registrar, such as godaddy.com. Some reg­

CHAPTER 7  |  Networks: Mobile Business  191
Two ways to use VoIP for telephone 
calls are through a web interface 
that allows users to make calls from 
their computer and through a phone 
attached to a VoIP adapter that links 
directly to the Internet through a 
broadband modem. Figure 7.9 illus­
trates these two ways along with 
the use of VoIP-enabled phones, 
bypassing the need for an adapter.
VoIP services include fixed-price 
unlimited local and long-distance 
calling plans (at least within the 
United States and Canada), plus a 
range of interesting features, such as:
	∙	 The ability to have more than one 
phone number, including num­
bers with different area codes.
	∙	 Integrating email and voice mail so users can listen to their 
voice mail using their computer.
	∙	 The ability to receive personal or business calls via computer, 
no matter where the user is physically located.12
The biggest benefit of VoIP is its low cost. Because it relies on 
the Internet connection, however, service can be affected if the 
bandwidth is not appropriate or Internet access is not available.
Skype is a perfect example of IP applied to telephone 
use. Unlike typical VoIP systems that use a client and 
server infrastructure, Skype uses a peer-to-peer net­
work. Peer-to-peer network   (P2P) is a computer 
network that relies on the computing power and band­
width of the participants in the network rather than a 
centralized server. Skype’s user directory is distributed 
among the users in its network, allowing scalability 
without a complex and expensive centralized infra­
structure. Peer-to-peer networks became an overnight 
sensation years ago through a service called Napster 
that distributed digital music illegally. Skype has found 
a way to use this resource to provide value to its users.13
As the popularity of VoIP grows, governments are 
becoming more interested in regulating it as they do 
converted into digital form and exchanged over a network. Net­
work convergence then allows the weaving together of voice, 
data, and video. The benefits of network convergence allow for 
multiple services, multiple devices, but one network, one ven­
dor, and one bill, as suggested by Figure 7.8.
One of the challenges associated with network convergence 
is using the many different tools efficiently and productively. 
­Knowing which communication channel—PC, text message, 
videoconference—to use with each business participant can be a 
challenge. Unified communications (UC) is the integration of 
communication channels into a single service. UC integrates com­
munication channels allowing participants to communicate using 
the method that is most convenient for them. UC merges instant 
messaging, videoconferencing, email, voice mail, and VoIP. 
This can decrease the communication costs for a business while 
enhancing the way individuals communicate and collaborate.
One area experiencing huge growth in network convergence 
is the use of the Internet for voice transmission. Voice over 
IP (VoIP) uses IP technology to transmit telephone calls. For 
the first time in more than 100 years, VoIP is providing an 
opportunity to bring about significant change in the way people 
communicate using the telephone. VoIP service providers—
specialists as well as traditional telephone and cable companies 
and some ISPs—allow users to call anyone with a telephone 
number, whether local, long distance, cellular, or international.

Net Neutrality
Net neutrality—the great debate has been raging for some time now, 
with the battle lines clearly drawn. Net neutrality is about ensuring that 
everyone has equal access to the Internet. It is the founding principle 
that all consumers should be able to use the Internet and be free to 
access its resources without any form of discrimination.
On one side of the debate are the ISPs, such as Comcast, that are 
building the Internet infrastructure and want to charge customers rela­
tive to their use, namely, the amount of bandwidth they consume. The 
ISPs argue that more and more users accessing bandwidth-intense 
resources provided by the likes of YouTube and Netflix place huge 
demands on their networks. They want Internet access to move from a 
flat-rate pricing structure to a metered service.
On the other hand, content providers, such as Google, support the 
counterargument that if ISPs move toward metered schemes, this may limit 
the usage of many resources on the Internet 
such as iTunes and Netflix. A metered service 
may also stifle the innovative opportunities the 
open Internet provides.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit struck down the Federal Communications Commission’s 
net neutrality rules, which would have required Internet service providers 
to treat all Web traffic equally. The ruling will allow ISPs to charge compa­
nies such as Netflix and Amazon fees for faster content delivery.
Do you agree that the government should control the Internet? 
Should website owners be legally forced to receive or transmit informa­
tion from competitors or other websites they find objectionable? Provide 
examples of when net neutrality might be good for a business and when 
net neutrality might be bad for a business. Overall, is net neutrality good 
or bad for business?15

service providers compa­
rable to those for traditional 
telephone providers such as 
support for local number por­
tability, services for the disabled, and law enforcement for sur­
veillance, along with regulatory and other fees.
An exciting and new convergence is occurring in the area of 
television with Internet Protocol TV (IPTV), which distrib­
utes digital video content using IP across the Internet and pri­
vate IP networks. Comcast provides an example of a private IP 
network that also acts as a cable TV provider. Traditional televi­
sion sends all program signals simultaneously to the television, 
allowing the user to select the program by selecting a channel. 
With IPTV, the user selects a channel and the service provider 
sends only that single program to the television. Like cable TV, 
IPTV uses a box that acts like a modem to send and receive the 
content (see Figure 7.10). A few IPTV features include:
	∙	 Support of multiple devices: PCs and televisions can access 
IPTV services.
	∙	 Interactivity with users: Interactive applications and programs 
are supported by IPTV’s two-way communication path.
	∙	 Low bandwidth: IPTV conserves bandwidth because the pro­
vider sends only a single channel.
	∙	 Personalization: Users can choose not only what they want to 
watch, but also when they want to watch it.14

Music in the 
Clouds16
Years ago, if you wanted to save music 
to your computer you were required to have an 
enormous hard drive, which was rather expen­
sive. Today, you can listen to music in the cloud. 
Of course we do not mean real clouds, but the 
term cloud is now used as a metaphor for the 
Internet. Most songs exist somewhere in the 
“cloud,” and websites like YouTube, Pandora, 
or HypeMachine are all services allowing you 
to listen to streaming music without saving 
a single song to your own device. Wherever 
those elusive songs actually live—somewhere 
in the cloud—you can play, collect, and share 
them without downloading a single thing. Five 
sites you can use to access music in the cloud 
include:
	∙	 Fizy: A Turkish site compiles audio from 
around the net into a database from which 
you can create your own playlists.
	∙	 Muziic: Developed by high school student 
David Nelson with help from his dad. This 
upstart accesses the songs on YouTube via 
an iTunes interface.
	∙	 Songza: Songza wraps the music 
of Imeem and YouTube in a sweet, 
simple web interface.
	∙	 Spotify: A P2P streaming archi­
tecture lets users in supported 
countries create collections from a 
massive in-house music archive.
	∙	 Twones: Twones allows you to 
download software for playback 
and tracks user activity on multiple 
online service and offline players 
through a single web interface.
The world of online music is a dream 
come true for most music lovers 
because you can listen to any song 
your heart desires with a quick Google 
search. What role do copyright laws 
play in the world of online music? If you

resources, cloud computing and 
virtualization allow for collective 
computing power, storage, and 
software, in an on-demand basis.
Perhaps even more important than 
sharing physical resources is shar­
ing data. Most companies, regard­
less of size, depend not just on 
their customer records, invento­
ries, accounts receivable, financial 
statements, and tax information, 
but also on their ability to share 
these, especially with operations 
in remote locations. Networking with a LAN, WAN, or MAN 
allows employees to share data quickly and easily and to use 
applications such as databases and collaboration tools that rely on 
sharing. By sharing data, networks have made business processes 
more efficient. For example, as soon as an order is placed, any­
one in the company who needs to view it—whether in marketing, 
purchasing, manufacturing, shipping, or billing—can do so.
Intranets and extranets let firms share their corporate informa­
tion securely. An intranet is a restricted network that relies on 
Internet technologies to provide an Internet-like environment

Networks have created a diverse, yet globally connected world. 
By eliminating time and distance, networks make it possible to 
communicate in ways not previously imaginable. Even though 
networks provide many business advantages, they also create 
increased challenges in (1) security and (2) social, ethical, and 
political issues.
Security
Networks are a tempting target for mischief and fraud. A 
company first has to ensure proper identification of users and 
authorization of network access. Outside suppliers might be 
allowed to access production plans via the company’s extranet, 
for example, but they must not be able to see other information 
such as financial records. The company should also preserve 
the integrity of its data; only qualified users should be allowed 
to change and update data, and only well-specified data.

tion 
sharing, 
communications, 
collaboration, 
web 
publishing, 
and the support of business pro­
cesses, as suggested in Figure 
7.11. This network is protected by 
security measures such as pass­
words, encryption, and firewalls, 
and thus only authorized users can 
access it. Intranets provide a cen­
tral location for all kinds of com­
pany-related information such as 
benefits, schedules, strategic direc­
tions, and employee directories.17
An extranet is an extension of an 
intranet that is available only to 
authorized outsiders, such as cus­
tomers, partners, and suppliers. Having a common area where 
these parties can share information 
with employees about, for instance, 
order and invoice processing can be a 
major competitive advantage in prod­
uct development, cost control, market­
ing, distribution, and supplier relations. 
Companies can establish direct private 
network links among themselves or cre­
ate private, secure Internet access, in 
effect a “private tunnel” within the Inter­
net, called a virtual private network 
(VPN). Figure 7.12 illustrates using a 
VPN to connect to a corporate server.
Extranets enable customers, suppliers, 
consultants, subcontractors, business 
prospects, and others to access selected 
intranet websites and other company 
network resources that allow the sharing 
of information. Consultants and contrac­
tors can facilitate the design of new prod­
ucts or services. Suppliers can ensure 
that the raw materials necessary for the 
company to function are in stock and can 
be delivered in a timely fashion. Custom­
ers can access ordering and payment func­
tions and check order status. The extranet 
links the company to the outside world in a 
way that improves its operations.
Extranets provide business value in several 
ways. First, by relying on web browsers 
they make customer and supplier access 
to company resources easy and fast. Sec­
ond, they enable a company to customize 
interactive web-enabled services for the 
intended audience, to build and strengthen 
strategic relationships with customers and 

Should Airlines Allow 
­Cellphones on Flights?18
The Federal Communications Commis­
sion has proposed allowing passengers 
to use their mobile wireless devices, 
including cell phones, while flying 
above 10,000 feet. Cell phones 
on airplanes would not be using 
the traditional cellular networks 
because they are not designed 
to operate at 35,000 feet. Rather, calls 
would be batched and bounced down to the ground through a 
satellite or specialized air-to-ground cellular system, forcing airlines to 
charge much more per minute than standard carrier rates.
Supporters say that cell phone use does not interfere with aviation 
safety and that on foreign airlines where it is permitted, passengers’ 
calls tend to be short and unobtrusive.
Critics argue that allowing voice calls in flight would compromise 
flight attendants’ ability to maintain order in an emergency, increase 
cabin noise and tension among passengers, and add unacceptable risk 
to aviation security. They also point out that a majority of the traveling 
public want the cell phone ban maintained. Do you agree or disagree 
with the use of cell phones on airlines?
Due Diligence //:
Teddy the Guardian
Two London-based entrepreneurs are building an Internet of huggable 
things for sick children to make any hospital visit more like a trip to Dis­
neyland. Teddy The Guardian captures heart rate, temperatures, and 
blood-oxygen levels when a child grabs it by the paw to give it a cuddle. 
All measurements are sent wirelessly to nurses and parents, mobile 
devices. The new cute, cuddly teddy bear is packed full of sensors 
designed to track children’s vital signs and help quickly find out potential 
issues. Teddy The Guardian takes from 5 to 7 seconds to record mea­
surements and is programmed to run five times per hour. Future versions 
of Teddy The Guardian will be interactive, using machine learning to find 
out the child’s favorite song or bedtime story and then play the related 
content for a more soothing hospital visit. Big pharmaceutical companies 
in the United States have already placed over $500,000 in orders and 
plan to donate the bears to hospitals and clinics.
This is clearly a brilliant idea, and soon we will see Teddy The Guard­

a web server and a 
browser, ensuring that all 
data passed between them 
remains private.

electronic document that 
confirms the identity of 
a website or server and 
verifies that a public key 
belongs to a trustworthy 
individual or company.

(SHTTP or HTTPS)  A 
combination of HTTP and

CHAPTER 7  |  Networks: Mobile Business  195
Security problems intensify on the Inter­
net where companies need to guard against 
fraud, invalid purchases, and misappropria­
tion of credit card information.
Two methods for encrypting network traf­
fic on the web are secure sockets layer and 
secure hypertext transfer protocol. Secure 
sockets layer (SSL) is a standard security 
technology for establishing an encrypted 
link between a web server and a browser, ensuring that all data 
passed between them remain private. Millions of websites use 
SSL to protect their online transactions with their customers.
To create an SSL connection, a web server requires an SSL 
Certificate, an electronic document that confirms the identity 
of a website or server and verifies that a public key belongs to a 
trustworthy individual or company. (Public key is described in 
Chapter 4.) Typically, an SSL Certificate will contain a domain 
name, the company name and address, and the expiration date 
of the certificate and other details. Verisign is the leading 
Internet Certification Authority that issues SSL Certificates. 
When a browser connects to a secure site, it retrieves the site’s 
SSL Certificate, makes sure it has not expired, and confirms a 
Certification Authority has issued it. If the certificate fails on 
any one of these validation measures, the browser will display 
a warning to the end user that the site is not secure. If a website 
is using SSL, a lock icon appears in the lower right-hand corner 
of the user’s web browser.
Secure hypertext transfer protocol (SHTTP or HTTPS) is a 
combination of HTTP and SSL to provide encryption and secure 
identification of an Internet server. HTTPS protects against 
interception of communications, transferring credit card infor­
mation safely and securely with special encryption techniques. 
When a user enters a web address using https:// the browser will 
encrypt the message. However, the server receiving the message 
must be configured to receive HTTPS messages.

In summary, each company needs 
to create a network security policy 
that specifies aspects of data integ­
rity availability and confidentiality 
or privacy as well as accountability 
and authorization. With a variety of 
security methods, such as SSL and 
SHTTP, a company can protect its 
most important asset, its data.
Social, Ethical, and 
Political Issues
Only a small fraction of the 
world’s population has access to 
the Internet, and some people who 
have had access in the past have 
lost it due to changes in their cir­
cumstances such as unemployment 
or poverty. Providing network 
access to those who want or need 
it helps to level the playing field 
and removes the digital divide, a 
worldwide gap giving advantage 
to those with access to technology. 
Organizations trying to bridge the 
divide include the Boston Digital 
Bridge Foundation, which concentrates on local schoolchildren 
and their parents, helping to make them knowledgeable about 
computers, programs, and the Internet. Other organizations 
provide inexpensive laptops and Internet access in low-income 
areas in developing countries.19
Another social issue with networking occurs with newsgroups 
or blogs where like-minded people can exchange messages. 
If the topics are technical in nature or sports related such as 
cycling, few issues arise. Problems can begin when social 
media feature topics people can be sensitive about, such as 
politics, religion, or sex, or when someone posts an offensive 
message to someone else. Different countries have different 
and even conflicting laws about Internet use, but because the 
Internet knows no physical boundaries, communication is hard 
to regulate, even if anyone could. Some people believe network 
operators should be responsible for the content they carry, just 
as newspapers and magazines are. Operators, however, feel 
that like the post office or phone companies, they cannot be 
expected to police what users say. If they censored messages, 
how would they avoid violating users’ rights to free speech?
Many employers read and censor employee emails and limit 
employee access to distracting entertainment such as YouTube 
and social networks such as Facebook. Spending company time 
“playing” is not a good use of resources, they believe.
Social issues can even affect the government and its use of net­
works to snoop on citizens. The FBI has installed a system at 
many ISPs to scan all incoming and outgoing email for nuggets 
of interest. The system was originally called Carnivore but bad

publicity caused it to be renamed DCS1000. While the name is 
much more generic, its goal is the same—locate information on 
illegal activities by spying on millions of people. A common con­
ception associated with networking technologies is “Big Brother is 
watching!” People are wary of how much information is available 
on the Internet and how easily it can fall into the wrong hands.20
WIRELESS 
NETWORKS  LO7.3
As far back as 1896, Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi dem­
onstrated a wireless telegraph, and in 1927, the first radio­
telephone system began operating between the United States 
and Great Britain. Automobile-based mobile telephones were 
offered in 1947. In 1964, the first communications satellite, Tel­
star, was launched, and soon after, satellite-relayed telephone 
service and television broadcasts became available. Wireless 
networks have exploded since then, and newer technologies are 
now maturing that allow companies and home users alike to 
take advantage of both wired and wireless networks.21
Before delving into a discussion of wireless networks, we 
should distinguish between mobile and wireless, terms that are 
often used synonymously but actually have different mean­
ings. Mobile means the technology can travel with the user, for 
instance, users can download software, email messages, and 
web pages onto a laptop or other mobile device for portable 
reading or reference. Information collected while on the road 
can be synchronized with a PC or company server. Wireless, 
on the other hand, refers to any type of operation accomplished 
without the use of a hard-wired connection. There are many 
environments in which the network devices are wireless but not 
mobile, such as wireless home or office networks with station­
ary PCs and printers. Some forms of mobility do not require 
a wireless connection; for instance, a worker can use a wired 
laptop at home, shut down the laptop, drive to work, and attach 
the laptop to the company’s wired network.
In many networked environments today, users are both wire­
less and mobile; for example, a mobile user commuting to 
work on a train can maintain a VoIP call and multiple TCP/IP 
connections at the same time. Figure 7.13 categorizes wireless 
networks by type.

or base station by means of, for 
instance, wireless fidelity.
Areas around access points where 
users can connect to the Internet are 
often called hotspots. Hotspots are 
designated locations where Wi-Fi 
access points are publicly avail­
able. Hotspots are found in places 
such as restaurants, airports, and 
hotels—places where business pro­
fessionals tend to gather. Hotspots 
are extremely valuable for those 
business professionals who travel 
extensively and need access to 
business applications. By position­
ing hotspots at strategic locations 
throughout a building, campus, or 
city, network administrators can 
keep Wi-Fi users continuously con­
nected to a network or the Internet, 
no matter where they roam.23
In a Wi-Fi network, the user’s lap­
top or other Wi-Fi-enabled device 
has a wireless adapter that translates 
data into a radio signal and transmits 
it to the wireless access point. The 
wireless access point, which con­
sists of a transmitter with an antenna 
that is often built into the hardware, 
receives the signal and decodes it. 
The access point then sends the 
information to the Internet over a 
wired broadband connection, as illustrated in Figure 7.14. When 
receiving data, the wireless access point takes the information 
from the Internet, translates it into a radio signal, and sends it to 
the computer’s wireless adapter. If too many people try to use the 
Wi-Fi network at one time, they can experience interference or 
dropped connections. Most laptop computers come with built-in 
wireless transmitters and software to enable computers to auto­
matically discover the existence of a Wi-Fi network.
Wi-Fi operates at considerably higher frequencies than cell 
phones use, which allows greater bandwidth. The bandwidths 
associated with Wi-Fi are separated according to several wire­
less networking standards, known as 802.11, for carrying out 
Personal Area Networks
A personal area network (PAN) provides communication 
for devices owned by a single user that work over a short dis­
tance. PANs are used to transfer files, including email, calendar 
appointments, digital photos, and music. A PAN can provide 
communication between a wireless headset and a cell phone 
or between a computer and a wireless mouse or keyboard. 
Personal area networks generally cover a range of less than 
10 meters (about 30 feet). Bluetooth is a wireless PAN tech­
nology that transmits signals over short distances among cell 
phones, computers, and other devices. The name is borrowed 
from Harald Bluetooth, a king in Denmark more than 1,000 
years ago. Bluetooth eliminates the need for wires, docking 
stations, or cradles, as well as all the special attachments that 
typically accompany personal computing devices. Bluetooth 
operates at speeds up to 1 Mbps within a range of 33 feet or 
less. Devices that are Bluetooth-enabled communicate directly 
with each other in pairs, like a handshake. Up to eight can be 
paired simultaneously. And Bluetooth is not just for technology 
devices. An array of Bluetooth-equipped appliances, such as a 
television set, a stove, and a thermostat, can be controlled from 
a cell phone—all from a remote location.22
Wireless LANs
A wireless LAN (WLAN) is a local area network that uses radio 
signals to transmit and receive data over distances of a few hun­
dred feet. An access point (AP) is the computer or network 
device that serves as an interface between devices and the net­
work. Each computer initially connects to the access point and 
then to other computers on the network. A wireless access 
point (WAP) enables devices to connect to a wireless network 
to communicate with each other. WAPs with multiple-in/mul­
tiple-out (MIMO) technology have multiple transmitters and 
receivers, allowing them to send and receive greater amounts 
of data than traditional networking devices. Wireless fidelity 
(Wi-Fi) is a means by which portable devices can connect wire­
lessly to a local area network, using access points that send and 
receive data via radio waves. Wi-Fi has a maximum range of 
about 1,000 feet in open areas such as a city park and 250 to 
400 feet in closed areas such as an office building. Wi-Fi infra­
structure includes the inner workings of a Wi-Fi service or 
utility, including the signal transmitters, towers, or poles, along 
with additional equipment required to send out a Wi-Fi signal. 
Most WLANs use a Wi-Fi infrastructure in which a wireless 
device, often a laptop, communicates through an access point

Wireless Networks and Streetlamps27
Researchers at Harvard University and BBN Technologies have 
designed CitySense, a wireless network capable of reporting 
real-time sensor data across the entire city of Cambridge, Massa­
chusetts. CitySense is unique because it solves a constraint on pre­
vious wireless networks—battery life. The network mounts each 
node on a municipal streetlamp, where it draws power from city 
electricity. Researchers installed 100 sensors on streetlamps 
throughout Cambridge using a grant from the National Science 
Foundation. Each node will include an embedded PC running the 
Linux OS, an 802.11 Wi-Fi interface, and weather sensors.
One of the challenges in the design was how the network would 
allow remote nodes to communicate with the central server at Harvard 
and BBN. CitySense will do that by letting each node form a mesh with 
its neighbors, exchanging data through multiple-hop links. This strat­
egy allows a node to download software or upload sensor data to a 
distant server hub using a small radio with only a one-kilometer range.
You are responsible for deploying a CitySense network around 
your city. What goals would you have for the system besides moni­
toring urban weather and pollution? What other benefits could a 
CitySense network provide? How could local businesses and citizens 
benefit from the network? What legal and ethical concerns should 
you understand before deploying the network? What can you do to 
protect your network and your city from these issues?

more flexibility, and greater range. The organization denotes 
different versions of the standard—for example, Wireless-G

An increasing number of digital devices, 
including most laptops, netbooks, tablets such 
as the iPad, and even printers are incorporating 
Wi-Fi technology into their design. Cell phones 
are incorporating Wi-Fi so they can automati­
cally switch from the cell network to a faster 
Wi-Fi network where available for data com­
munications. BlackBerrys and iPhones can con­

such as email and web browsing, but not for voice

option is much faster than non-
line-of-sight service, and the dis­
tance between the WiMAX tower 
and antenna can be as great as 30 
miles. Figure 7.16 illustrates the 
WiMAX infrastructure.26
Some cellular companies are 
evaluating WiMAX as a means of 
increasing bandwidth for a variety 
of data-intensive applications such 
as those used by smartphones. 
Sprint Nextel and Clearwire are 
building a nationwide WiMAX 
network in the United States. 
WiMAX-capable gaming devices, 
laptops, cameras, and even cell phones are being manufactured­ 
by companies including Intel, Motorola, Nokia, and Samsung.28
Wireless WAN—Cellular 
Communication System
A wireless WAN (WWAN) is a wide area network that uses radio 
signals to transmit and receive data. WWAN technologies can be 
divided into two categories: cellular communication systems and 
satellite communication systems.
Although mobile communications have been 
around for generations, including the walkie-
talkies of the 1940s and mobile radiophones 
of the 1950s, it was not until 1983 that cellu­
lar telephony became available commercially. 
A cell phone is a device for voice and data, 
communicating wirelessly through a collec­
tion of stationary ground-based sites called 
base stations, each of which is linked to its 
nearest neighbor stations. Base station cover­
age areas are about 10 square miles and are 
called cells, as Figure 7.17 illustrates.29
The first cell phone was demonstrated in 1973 
by Motorola (it weighed almost 2 pounds), but 
it took 10 years for the technology to become 
commercially available. The Motorola Dyna­
TAC, marketed in 1983, weighed one pound 
and cost about $4,000. Cellular technology 
has come a long way since then.30
Cellular systems were originally designed to 
provide voice services to mobile customers 
and thus were designed to interconnect cells 
to the public telephone network. Increasingly, 
they provide data services and Internet con­
nectivity. There are more cell phones than 
landline phones in many countries today, and 
it is no longer uncommon for cell phones to 
be the only phones people have.
because they are not widely available, at least in the United 
States. One with the potential for success is Worldwide 
Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), a com­
munications technology aimed at providing high-speed wire­
less data over metropolitan area networks. In many respects, 
WiMAX operates like Wi-Fi, only over greater distances and 
with higher bandwidths. A WiMAX tower serves as an access 
point and can connect to the Internet or another tower. A single 
tower can provide up to 3,000 square miles of coverage, so 
only a few are needed to cover an entire city. WiMAX can sup­
port data communications at a rate of 70 Mbps. In New York 
City, for example, one or two WiMAX access points around 
the city might meet the heavy demand more cheaply than hun­
dreds of Wi-Fi access points. WiMAX can also cover remote or 
rural areas where cabling is limited or nonexistent, and where 
it is too expensive or physically difficult to install wires for the 
relatively few users.25
WiMAX can provide both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight 
service. A non-line-of-sight service uses a small antenna on a 
mobile device that connects to a WiMAX tower less than six 
miles away where transmissions are disrupted by physical 
obstructions. This form of service is similar to Wi-Fi but has 
much broader coverage area and higher bandwidths. A line-of-
sight option offers a fixed antenna that points at the WiMAX

usage; all wireless and even wired networks can take advantage 
of this method. The most obvious advantage is speed, a direct 
benefit for mobile and wireless devices since they are still not 
as fast as their wired counterparts. Voice over LTE (VoLTE) 
allows mobile voice calls to be made over broadband networks, 
­creating—under the right network conditions—clearer audio 
and fewer dropped calls. One easy way to think of VoLTE is 
as, essentially, a VoIP call on your mobile phone. The func­
tionality is still the same, but the data transfers in a faster and 
more efficient manner.31
Cell phones have morphed into 
smartphones that offer more 
advanced 
computing 
ability 
and connectivity than basic cell 
phones. They allow for web browsing, emailing, listening 
to music, watching video, computing, keeping track of con­
tacts, sending text messages, and taking and sending pho­
tos. The Apple iPhone and RIM BlackBerry are examples of 
smartphones.
Cell phones and smartphones, or 
mobile phones as they are collec­
tively called, need a provider to 
offer services, much as computer 
users need an ISP to connect to the 
Internet. The most popular mobile 
phone providers in the United States 
are AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and 
Verizon. They offer different cell 
phones, features, coverage areas, 
and services. One of the services is 
third-generation, or 3G, services 
that bring wireless broadband to 
mobile phones. Figure 7.18 lists the 
cell phone generations. The 3G net­
works let users surf web pages, enjoy 
streaming music, watch video-­on-
demand programming, download 
and play 3-D games, and participate 
in social media and teleconferencing.

audio and video files over the Internet 
in such a way that the user can view

Protecting Wireless 
Connections
Network intrusions can occur if 
access codes or passwords are 
stored on a device that is lost or 
stolen. However, anytime a wire­
less network connects to a wired one, the wireless network can 
serve as a conduit for a hacker to gain entry into an otherwise 
secure wired network. This risk is especially high if the wire­
less network is not sufficiently secured in its own right.
Before the emergence of the Internet, hackers generally had 
to be physically present within the corporate complex to gain 
access to a wired network. The thousands, if not millions, of 
access points enabled by the Internet now allow hackers to work 
from a distance. This threat has spawned a variety of security 
techniques, from firewalls to VPNs to SSL and HTTPS.
Several techniques can secure wireless networks from unau­
thorized access whether used separately or in combination. One 
method is authenticating Wi-Fi access points. Because Wi-Fi 
communications are broadcast, 
anyone within listening distance 
can intercept communications. 
Every time someone uses an 
unsecured website via a pub­
lic Wi-Fi access point, his or 
her logon name and password 
are sent over the open airwaves 
with a high risk that someone 
might eavesdrop or capture 
logon names, passwords, credit 
card numbers, and other vital 
information. Wired equivalent 
privacy (WEP) is an encryption 
Wireless WAN - Satellite 
Communication System
The other wireless WAN technology is a satellite communica­
tion system. A satellite is a space station that orbits the Earth 
receiving and transmitting signals from Earth-based stations 
over a wide area. When satellite systems first came into consid­
eration in the 1990s, the goal was to provide wireless voice and 
data coverage for the entire planet, without the need for mobile 
phones to roam between many different provider networks. But 
by the time satellite networks were ready for commercial use, 
they had already been overtaken by cellular systems.
The devices used for satellite communication range from handheld 
units to mobile base stations to fixed satellite dish receivers. The 
peak data transmission speeds range from 2.4 Kbps to 2 Mbps. For 
the everyday mobile professional, satellite communication may 
not provide a compelling benefit, but for people requiring voice 
and data access from remote locations or guaranteed coverage in 
nonremote locations, satellite technology is a viable solution.
Conventional communication satellites move in stationary 
orbits approximately 22,000 miles above Earth. A newer satel­
lite medium, the low-orbit satellite, travels much closer to Earth 
and is able to pick up signals from weak transmitters. Low-orbit 
satellites also consume less power and cost less to launch than 
conventional satellites. With satellite networks, businesspeople 
almost anywhere in the world have access to full communication

to use the same technology they have at home in the office. 
This blending of personal and business technology is having 
a significant impact on corporate MIS departments, which tra­
ditionally choose all of the technology for the organization. 
Today, MIS departments must determine how to protect their 
networks and manage technology that they did not authorize 
or recommend. Two ways an MIS department can manage IT 
consumerization is through mobile device management and 
mobile application management.
Mobile device management (MDM)  remotely controls 
smartphones and tablets, ensuring data security. MIS depart­
ments implement MDM by requiring passcodes on organiza­
tional smartphones to ensure data encryption and, in the event 
of a lost smartphone, that all data on the device can be deleted 
remotely. MDM tools can also enforce policies, track inven­
tory, and perform real-time monitoring and reporting. One 
problem with MDM is that the full-device approach can be too 
heavy-handed in an era when employees, not their employers, 
own their smartphones and tablets. Users may wonder, “If I 
only use my phone to check email at night, why do I have to 
enter my work password every time I want to use the phone?” 
or “If I lose my phone, why does my IT department want to 
wipe pictures of my dog remotely?”
Mobile application management  administers and delivers 
applications to corporate and personal smartphones and tab­
lets. MAM software assists with software delivery, licens­
ing, and maintenance and can limit how sensitive data can 
be shared among apps. An important feature of MAM is that 
it provides corporate network administrators with the abil­
ity to wipe corporate mobile apps from an end user’s device 
remotely.
algorithm designed to protect wireless transmission data. If 
you are using a Wi-Fi connection, WEP encrypts the data by 
using a key that converts the data to a nonhuman readable 
form. The purpose of WEP was to provide wireless networks 
with the equivalent level of security as wired networks. Unfor­
tunately, the technology behind WEP has been demonstrated 
to be relatively insecure compared to newer protocols such as 
WPA. WLANs that use Wi-Fi have a built-in security mecha­
nism called Wi-Fi protected access (WPA), a wireless secu­
rity protocol to protect Wi-Fi networks. It is an improvement 
on the original Wi-Fi security standard, wired equivalent pri­
vacy (WEP), and provides more sophisticated data encryption 
and user authentication. Anyone who wants to use an access 
point must know the WPA encryption key to access the Wi-Fi 
connection.
War chalking is the practice of tagging pavement with codes 
displaying where Wi-Fi access is available. The codes for war 
chalking tell other users the kind of access available, the speed 
of the network, and if the network is secured. War driving is 
deliberately searching for Wi-Fi signals while driving by in a 
vehicle. Many individuals who participate in war driving sim­
ply map where Wi-Fi networks are available. Other individuals 
have a more malicious intent and use war driving to hack or 
break into these networks. War driving has been a controversial 
practice since its inception and has raised the awareness of the 
importance of wireless network security.
Managing Mobile Devices
IT consumerization is the blending of personal and business 
use of technology devices and applications. Today’s workforce 
grew up with the Internet and its members do not differentiate 
between corporate and personal technology. Employees want

comprised of one or more RFID 
tags, one or more RFID readers, 
two or more antennas (one on the 
tag and one on each reader), RFID 
application software, and a com­
puter system or server, as Figure 
7.21 illustrates. Tags, often smaller 
than a grain of rice, can be applied to 
books or clothing items as part of an 
adhesive bar-code label, or included 
in items such as ID cards or packing 
labels. Readers can be stand-alone 
devices, such as for self-checkout 
in a grocery store, integrated with 
a mobile device for portable use, 
or built in as in printers. The reader 
sends a wireless request that is 
received by all tags in the area that 
have been programmed to listen 
to wireless signals. Tags receive 
the signal via their antennas and 
respond by transmitting their stored 
data. The tag can hold many types 
of data, including a product number, 
installation instructions, and history 
of activity (such as the date the item 
was shipped). The reader receives a 
signal from the tag using its antenna, 
interprets the information sent, and 
transfers the data to the associated 
computer system or server.
Passive RFID tags do not have 
a power source, whereas active 
RFID tags have their own trans­
mitter and a power source (typi­
cally a battery). The power source 
runs the microchip’s circuitry and 
broadcasts a signal to the reader 
(similar to the way a cell phone 
transmits signals to a base station). 
Passive RFID tags draw power 
from the RFID reader, which 
sends out electromagnetic waves that induce a current in the 
tag’s antenna. Semi-passive RFID tags use a battery to run 
the microchip’s circuitry, but communicate by drawing power 
from the RFID reader. Asset tracking occurs when a company 
places active or semi-passive RFID tags on expensive products 
or assets to gather data on the items’ location with little or no 
manual intervention. Asset tracking allows a company to focus 
on its supply chain, reduce theft, identify the last known user 
of assets, and automate maintenance routines. Active and semi-
passive tags are useful for tracking high-value goods that need 
to be scanned over long ranges, such as railway cars on a track. 
The cost of active and semi-passive RFID tags is significant; 
hence, low-cost items typically use passive RFID tags.
BUSINESS 
APPLICATIONS 
OF WIRELESS 
NETWORKS  LO7.4
Companies of all types and sizes have relied on wireless tech­
nology for years. Shipping and trucking companies developed 
some of the earliest wireless applications to help track vehicles 
and valuable cargo, optimize the logistics of their global opera­
tions, perfect their delivery capabilities, and reduce theft and 
damage. Government agencies such as the National Aeronau­
tics and Space Administration and the Department of Defense 
have relied on satellite technologies for decades to track the 
movement of troops, weaponry, and military assets; to receive 
and broadcast data; and to communicate over great distances.
Wireless technologies have also aided the creation of new 
applications. Some build upon and improve existing capabili­
ties. UPS, for example, is combining several types of wireless 
network technologies from Bluetooth to WWANs and deploy­
ing scanners and wearable data-collection terminals to auto­
mate and standardize package management and tracking across 
all its delivery centers. Figure 7.20 displays the three business 
applications taking advantage of wireless technologies.
LO7.4  Explain the different wireless network business applications.
Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)
Radio-frequency identification (RFID) uses electronic tags and 
labels to identify objects wirelessly over short distances. It holds 
the promise of replacing existing identification technologies such 
as the bar code. RFID wirelessly exchanges information between 
a tagged object and a reader/writer. An RFID tag is an electronic 
identification device that is made up of a chip and antenna. An 
RFID reader (RFID interrogator) is a transmitter/receiver that 
reads the contents of RFID tags in the area. A RFID system is

The RFID accelerometer is a 
device that measures the accelera­
tion (the rate of change of velocity) 
of an item and is used to track truck 
speeds or taxi cab speeds. Chipless 
RFID tags use plastic or conductive 
polymers instead of silicon-based 
microchips, allowing them to be 
washed or exposed to water without 
damaging the chip. Examples of the 
innovative uses of RFID include:
	 ∙	 RFID chips injected under the 
skin of animals using a syringe 
can help ranchers meet regula­
tions, track wild animals for eco­
logical studies, and return lost 
pets to their owners.
	 ∙	 Retail stores use RFID to track 
and monitor inventory. Hospitals 
and pharmaceutical companies 
meet government regulations 
and standards with RFID. Even 
local libraries are using RFID to 
control theft and speed up the 
checkout process.
	 ∙	 Car manufacturers install RFID 
antitheft systems. Toll roads use 
RFID to collect payments from 
passing cars.
	 ∙	 Hospitals track patients’, doctors’, 
and nurses’ locations to facilitate 
emergency situations and ensure 
safety. RFID also tracks equipment 
location to ensure quick response 
times during an emergency.
	 ∙	 American Express and Master­
Card use RFID for automatic 
payments.
	 ∙	 Walmart and other large retail­
ers use RFID to maintain inven­
tory, stop shoplifting, and speed 
customer checkout processes.35
Global Positioning System (GPS)
A global positioning system (GPS) is a satellite-based navi­
gation system providing extremely accurate position, time, and 
speed information. The U.S. Department of Defense developed 
the technology in the early 1970s and later made it available to 
the public. GPS uses 24 global satellites that orbit Earth, send­
ing signals to a receiver that can communicate with three or 
four satellites at a time. A GPS receiver can be a separate unit 
connected to a mobile device using cable or wireless technol­
ogy such as Bluetooth, or it can be included in devices such 
as mobile phones or vehicle navigation systems. Automatic 
vehicle location (AVL) uses GPS tracking to track vehicles. 
AVL systems use a GPS receiver in the vehicle that links to a 
control center. Garmin is one of the more popular manufactur­
ers of GPS tracking systems, offering vehicle tracking, phone 
and laptop integration, and hiker navigation for water and air.
The satellites broadcast signals constantly, while the receiver 
measures the time it takes for the signals to reach it. This mea­
surement, which uses the speed of the signal to determine the 
distance, is taken from three distinct satellites to provide precise 
location information. The time measurements depend on high-
powered clocks on each satellite and must be precise, because 
an error of one-thousandth of a second can result in a location 
variation of more than 200 miles. GPS can produce very accu­
rate results, typically within 5 to 50 feet of the actual location 
(military versions have higher accuracy). GPS also provides 
latitude, longitude, and elevation information. Latitude repre­
sents a north/south measurement of position. Longitude rep­
resents an east/west measurement of position. Geocache is a 
GPS technology adventure game that posts the longitude and 
latitude location for an item on the Internet for users to find. 
GPS users find the geocache and typically sign a guest book or 
take an item and leave an item for the next adventure players to 
find. Caches are often placed in locations that are interesting or 
challenging for people to discover. A geocoin, a round coin-
sized object, is uniquely numbered and hidden in geocache. 
Geocoins can also be shaped to match a theme such as the state 
of Colorado or a birthday party hat. Geocoins are often deco­
rative or commemorative, making them collectible and highly 
valuable for technology adventures.

Wi-Fi For Fishes
Not too long ago, the Seattle Aquarium decided 
it needed to take a deep dive into its network 
infrastructure and deploy wireless across its 
facilities. Now, a year and half in, the aquarium 
has found Wi-Fi to be a tool that not only lets 
it serve visitors in unique ways but enriches 
the exchanges possible between staff mem­
bers and the community, says Pam Lamon, the 
aquarium’s web and social media coordinator. 
For instance, there are long stretches when Umi, 
the aquarium’s 40-pound giant Pacific octopus, 
Living the
doesn’t move at all. Now, staff members armed 
with tablets can roam around the exhibit show­
ing visitors videos of Umi feeding while they 
field questions.
Wireless even lets the aquarium interact with 
people who can’t visit in person. For instance, 
during a recent Google + Hangout on Air, a young 
boy from an East Coast school asked an aquarium 
diver how many fish were swimming in the tank 
with her. The diver, wearing a wetsuit and a face­
mask with a microphone and speaker, began 
pointing out fish. “One, two, three, four, five, six, 
seven,” she counted off, before giving up and tell­
ing him there were 500, give or take a few. “It’s a 
little bit hard to know for sure because they just 
don’t hold still while we count them,” she joked.
The Seattle Aquarium is far from alone 
among businesses and organizations that are 
tapping into wireless to expand or improve ser­
vices. As wireless has morphed from a pleasant 
perk to a necessity for employees and clients 
across industries, many businesses are finding 
they can no longer make do without wireless 
or with limited Wi-Fi services. Today, not only is 
there incentive to find better solutions, but com­
panies have access to more sophisticated equip­
ment to help them pinpoint network problems. 
From next-generation access points to cloud-
based management systems, wireless tools can 
provide expanded capabilities, are easy to man­
age, and are available in a range of prices.36
In a group, choose a business in your area 
that could benefit from wireless technology, 
such as the Seattle Aquarium, and create a plan 
detailing the additional services it could offer its 
customers.

GPS applications are in every kind of company vehicle these 
days—from police cars to bulldozers, from dump trucks to 
mayoral limousines. Emergency response systems use GPS 
to track each of their vehicles and so dispatch those closest to 
the scene of an accident. If a vehicle is missing, its GPS loca­
tor can help locate it. Estimated time of arrival (ETA) is the 
time of day of an expected arrival at a certain destination and 
is typically used for navigation applications. Estimated time 
enroute (ETE) is the time remaining before reaching a destina­
tion using the present speed and is typically used for navigation 
applications.
Geographic Information 
Systems (GIS)
GPS provides the foundation for geographic information sys­
tems. A geographic information system (GIS) stores, views, 
and analyzes geographic data creating, multidimensional charts 
or maps. For example, GIs are monitoring global warming by 
measuring the speed of glaciers melting in Canada, Greenland, 
and Antarctica. Cartography is the science and art of mak­
ing an illustrated map or chart. GIS allows users to interpret, 
analyze, and visualize data in different ways that reveal pat­
terns and trends in the form of reports, charts, and maps. Edge 
matching (warping, rubber sheeting) occurs when paper 
maps are laid edge to edge and items that run across maps but 
do not match are reconfigured to match. Edge matching is a 
critical component of creating a GIS database because map 
misalignments occur frequently for many reasons, including 
survey error and cartographic errors. GIS map automation 
links business assets to a centralized system where they can be 
tracked and monitored over time.
Spatial data (geospatial data or geographic infor­
mation) identifies the geographic location of features and 
boundaries on Earth, such as natural or constructed features, 
oceans, and more. Spatial data can be mapped and is stored 
as coordinates and topology. A GIS accesses, manipulates, 
and analyzes spatial data. Geocoding in spatial databases is a 

 Snapping a Theftie
H
as your smart phone ever been stolen? If 
so, you are not alone; more than 3 million 
Americans’ phones were stolen in 2013, 
which is twice the number in 2012, according 
to a Consumer Reports survey. Of course, every 
good entrepreneur can spot an opportunity, and 
a new antitheft app is one step ahead of crimi­
nals who are targeting smart phones.
Lookout is among the latest additions to the 
growing antitheft industry, and the app features 
some smart ways of helping you get one step 
ahead of thieves. A smart phone’s front-facing 
camera is often regarded as merely a portal to 
endless selfie photographs. But Lookout puts 
the camera to good use by capturing a photo of 
you—or of any would-be thief—when someone 
inputs your phone’s password incorrectly three 
times. That photo, or theftie, is instantly emailed 
to the phone’s owner, along with the device’s 
approximate location. The antitheft app is free 
to download, but this handy photo feature is not 
available on iPhones due to Apple restrictions 
and comes with an annual charge of $30.39
Lookout’s team has been adding new fea­
tures to the app’s alerts, based on the methods 
thieves use to steal phones undetected. The 
app also will send emails to its owner if any­
one attempts to remove the phone’s SIM card, 
enables Airplane mode, or turns off the device. 
From that point, the owner can choose to lock or 
wipe the phone remotely.
Do you agree that antitheft apps are smart 
business? Are any ethical issues involved in tak­
ing thefties? How would you feel if company 
security policy required you to install Lookout on 
your cell phone? If you could add a new feature 
to Lookout, how would it work and what would it 
do to deter smart phone theft?

process that takes a 
digital map feature and 
assigns it an attribute 
that serves as a unique 
ID (tract number, node 
number) or classification 
(soil type, zoning 
category).

coding process that assigns a digi­
tal map feature to an attribute that 
serves as a unique ID (tract num­
ber, node number) or classifica­
tion (soil type, zoning category). 
GIS professionals are certified 
in geocoding practices to ensure 
industry standards are met when 
classifying spatial data.
Companies that deal in transporta­
tion combine GISs with database 
and GPS technology. Airlines 
and shipping companies can plot 
routes 
with 
up-to-the-second 
information about the location of 
all their transport vehicles. Hospitals can locate their medical 
staff with GIS and sensors that pick up transmissions from ID 
badges. Automobiles have GPSs linked to GIS maps that dis­
play the car’s location and driving directions on a dashboard 
screen. GM offers the OnStar system, which sends a continu­
ous stream of information to the OnStar center about the car’s 
exact location.
Some mobile phone providers combine GPS and GIS capabili­
ties so they can locate users within a geographical area about 
the size of a tennis court to assist emergency services such as 
911. Farmers can use GIS to map and analyze fields, telling 
them where to apply the proper amounts of seed, fertilizer, and 
herbicides.
A GIS can find the closest gas station or bank or determine the 
best way to get to a particular location. But it is also good at 
finding patterns, such as finding the most feasible location to 
hold a conference according to where the majority of a compa­
ny’s customers live and work. GIS can present this information 
in a visually effective way.
Some common GIS uses include:
	∙	 Finding what is nearby. Given a specific location, the GIS finds 
sources within a defined radius. These might be entertain­
ment venues, medical facilities, restaurants, or gas stations. 
Users can also use GIS to locate vendors that sell a specific 
item they want and get the results as a map of the surround­
ing area or an address.
	∙	 Routing information. Once users have an idea where they 
want to go, GIS can provide directions to get there using 
either a map or step-by-step instructions. Routing informa­
tion can be especially helpful when combined with search 
services.
	∙	 Sending information alerts. Users may want to be notified 
when information relevant to them becomes available near 
their location. A commuter might want to know that a sec­
tion of the highway has traffic congestion, or a shopper might 
want to be notified when a favorite store is having a sale on a 
certain item.
	∙	 Mapping densities. GIS can map population and event densi­
ties based on a standard area unit, such as square miles, mak­
ing it easy to see distributions and concentrations. Police can 
map crime incidents to determine where additional patrolling 
is required, and stores can map customer orders to identify 
ideal delivery routes.
	∙	 Mapping quantities. Users can map quantities to find out 
where the most or least of a feature may be. For example, 
someone interested in opening a specialty coffee shop can 
determine how many others are already in the area, and city 
planners can determine where to build more parks.37
A GIS can provide information and insight to both mobile users 
and people at fixed locations. Google Earth combines satellite 
imagery, geographic data, and Google’s search capabilities to 
create a virtual globe that users can download to a computer 
or mobile device. Not only does this provide useful business 
benefits, but it also allows for many educational opportunities. 
Instead of just talking about the Grand Canyon, an instructor 
can use Google Earth to view that region.

CHAPTER 7  |  Networks: Mobile Business  207
GPS and GIS both utilize location-based services (LBS), 
applications that use location information to provide a ser­
vice. LBS is designed to give mobile users instant access to 
personalized local content and range from 911 applications 
to buddy finders (“Let me know when my friend is within 
1,000 feet”) to games (treasure hunts) to location-based 
advertising (“Visit the Starbucks on the corner and get $1.00 
off a latte”). Many LBS applications complement GPS and 
GIS, such as:
	∙	 Emergency services
	∙	 Field service management
	∙	 Find-it services
	∙	 Mapping
	∙	 Navigation
	∙	 Tracking assets
	∙	 Traffic information
	∙	 Vehicle location
	∙	 Weather information
	∙	 Wireless advertising38
Just as Facebook and Twitter helped fuel the Web 2.0 revolu­
tion, applications such as Foursquare, Gowalla, and Loopt are 
bringing attention to LBS. Each application is a mobile phone 
service that helps social media users find their friends’ loca­
tion. Facebook and Twitter have added location-based services 
to complement their applications.

rganizations use various types of information 
systems to help run their daily operations. These 
primarily transactional systems concentrate on 
the management and flow of low-level data items for basic 
business processes such as purchasing and order delivery. 
The data are often rolled up and summarized into higher-level 
decision support systems to help firms understand what is hap­
pening in their organizations and how best to respond. To achieve 
seamless and efficient handling of data and informed decision mak­
ing, organizations must ensure that their enterprise systems are 
tightly integrated, providing an end-to-end view of operations.
This module introduces various types of enterprise information 
systems and their role in helping firms reach their strategic goals, 
including supply chain management, customer relationship man­
agement, and enterprise resource planning. Organizations that 
can correlate and summarize enterprisewide information are pre­
pared to meet their strategic business goals and outperform their 
competitors.
This module then dives into how enterprise systems can be 
built to support global businesses, the challenges in that process, 
and how well things turn out if systems are built according to good 
design principles, sound management practices, and flexibility to 
support ever-changing business needs. Making this happen requires 
not only extensive planning, but also well-honed people skills. ■

times. Often, management could not even compile the informa­
tion it needed to answer questions, solve problems, and make 
decisions.
To combat this challenge the ministry integrated its systems, 
or built connections among its many databases. These con­
nections or integrations allow separate systems to communi­
cate directly with each other, eliminating the need for manual 
entry into multiple systems. Building integrations allows the 
sharing of information across databases along with dramati­
cally increasing its quality. The army can now generate reports 
detailing its state of readiness and other essential intelligence, 
tasks that were nearly impossible before the integrations. ­
Eintegration is the use of the Internet to provide customers 
with the ability to gain personalized information by querying 
corporate databases and their information sources. Applica­
tion integration is the integration of a company’s existing 
management information systems. Data integration is the 
integration of data from multiple sources, which provides a 
unified view of all data.
Two common methods are used for integrating databases. The 
first is to create forward and backward integrations that link 
processes (and their underlying databases) in the value chain. 
A forward integration takes information entered into a given 
system and sends it automatically to all downstream systems 
and processes. A backward integration takes information 
entered into a given system and sends it automatically to all 
upstream systems and processes. Figure 8.1 demonstrates how 
this method works across the systems or processes of sales, 
order entry, order fulfillment, and billing. In the order entry 
system, for example, an employee can update the customer’s 
information. Via the integrations, that information is sent 
upstream to the sales system and downstream to the order ful­
fillment and billing systems. Ideally, an organization wants to 
build both forward and backward integrations, which provide 
the flexibility to create, update, and delete information in any 
of the systems. However, integrations are expensive and diffi­
cult to build and maintain, causing most organizations to invest 
in forward integrations only.
The second integration method builds a central repository for a 
particular type of information. Figure 8.2 provides an example 
of customer information integrated using this method across four 
different systems in an organization. Users can create, update, 
and delete customer information only in the central customer 
database. As users perform these tasks, integrations automati­
cally send the new and/or updated customer information to the 
other systems. The other systems limit users to read-only access 
of the customer information stored in them. Both integration 
methods do not entirely eliminate information redundancy, but 
they do ensure information consistency among multiple systems.
LO8.1  Explain integrations and the role they play in connecting 
a corporation.
You, as a business student, must 
understand the critical relationship 
your business will have with its 
employees, customers, suppliers, 
and partners. You must also under­
stand how to analyze your organi­
zational data to ensure you are not 
just meeting but exceeding expec­
tations. Enterprises are technologi­
cally empowered as never before 
to reach their goals of integrating, 
analyzing, and making intelligent 
business decisions. ■

Enterprise systems provide enterprisewide support and data 
access for a firm’s operations and business processes. These 
systems can manage customer information across the enter­
prise, letting you view everything your customer has expe­
rienced from sales to support. Enterprise systems are often 
available as a generic, but highly customizable, group of pro­
grams for business functions such as accounting, manufac­
turing, and marketing. Generally, the development tools for 
customization are complex programming tools that require 
specialist capabilities.
Enterprise application integration (EAI) connects the plans, 
methods, and tools aimed at integrating separate enterprise sys­
tems. A legacy system is a current or existing system that will

EAI reviews how legacy systems 
fit into the new shape of the firm’s

Integrations are achieved using 
middleware—several

types of software that sit between 
and provide connectivity for two 
or more software applications. 
Middleware translates information

customer value delivery sys­
tem is affected. For example, 
no matter how great a com­
pany is at CRM, if its SCM 
system does not work and the 
customer never receives the 
finished product, the com­
pany will lose that customer. 
The world-class enterprises 
of tomorrow must be built on 
the foundation of world-class 
applications 
implemented 
today.
SUPPLY CHAIN 
MANAGEMENT  LO8.2
The average company spends nearly half of every dollar it earns 
on suppliers and raw materials to manufacture products. It is 
not uncommon to hear of critical success factors focusing on 
getting the right products, to the right place, at the right time, 
at the right cost. For this reason, tools that can help a company 
source raw materials, manufacture products, and deliver fin­
ished goods to retailers and customers are in high demand. 
A supply chain consists of all parties involved, directly or 
indirectly, in obtaining raw materials or a product. Figure 8.5 
highlights the five basic supply chain activities a company 
undertakes to manufacture and distribute products. To auto­
mate and enable sophisticated decision making in these critical 
areas, companies are turning to systems that provide demand 
forecasting, inventory control, and information flows between 
suppliers and customers.
Supply chain management (SCM) is the management of 
information flows between and among activities in a sup­
ply chain to maximize total supply chain effectiveness and 
corporate profitability. In the past, manufacturing efforts 
focused primarily on quality improvement efforts within the 
company; today these efforts reach across the entire supply 
chain, including customers, customers’ customers, suppliers, 
and suppliers’ suppliers. Today’s supply chain is an intricate 
network of business partners linked through communication 
channels and relationships. Supply chain management sys­
tems manage and enhance these relationships with the pri­
mary goal of creating a fast, efficient, and low-cost network 
of business relationships that take products from concept to 
market. SCM systems create the inte­
grations or tight process and informa­
tion linkages between all participants 
in the supply chain. Supply chain man­
agement performs three main business 
processes (see Figure 8.6):
	
1.	 Materials flow from suppliers and 
their upstream suppliers at all 
levels. 
	
2.	 Materials are transformed into semi­
finished and finished ­products—
the organization’s own production 
processes. 
	
3.	 Products are distributed to cus­
tomers and their downstream cus­
tomers at all levels.
Consider a customer purchasing a 
mountain bike from a dealer. Dozens of 
steps are required to complete this trans­
action from beginning to end. The cus­
tomer places an order with the dealer. 
The dealer purchases the bike from 
the manufacturer. The manufacturer 
purchases the raw materials required 
to make the bike such as aluminum, 
rubber tires, brakes, accessories, and 
packaging from different suppliers. The 
raw materials are stored in the manu­
facturer’s warehouse until a production 
order requires the bike to be built, at 
which time the finished product is sent

to the dealer or, in 
some cases, directly 
to the customer. The 
supply chain for a bike manufacturer 
includes all processes and people 
required to fulfill the customer’s order 
(see Figure 8.7).
Walmart and Procter & Gamble (P&G) 
have implemented a successful SCM system 
that links Walmart’s distribution centers directly 
to P&G’s manufacturing centers (see Figure 8.8). 
The customer generates order information by 
purchasing a product from Walmart. Walmart 
supplies the order information to its warehouse 
or distributor. The warehouse or distributor transfers 
the order information to P&G, which provides pricing and 
availability information to the store and replenishes the prod­
uct to the distributor. Payment is transferred electronically. 
Effective and efficient supply chain management systems can 
enable an organization to have these impacts on Porter’s Five 
Forces Model:
	∙	 Decrease the power of its buyers. Increase its supplier power. 
	∙	 Increase buyers’ switching costs to reduce the threat of sub­
stitute products or services. 
	∙	 Create entry barriers to reduce the threat of new entrants. 
	∙	 Increase efficiencies while seeking a competitive advantage 
through cost leadership (see Figure 8.9).1
Supply chain management systems can increase profitability 
across an organization. For example, a manufacturing plant 
manager might focus on keeping the inventory of Product A 
as low as possible, which will directly reduce the manufactur­
ing costs and make the plant manager look great. However, the 
plant manager and the business might not realize that these sav­
ings are causing increased costs in other areas, such as having 
to pay more to procure raw materials for immediate produc­
tion needs or increasing costs due to expedited shipping ser­
vices. Only an end-to-end view or an integrated supply 
chain would uncover these issues, allowing a firm to 
adjust business strategies to increase profitability 
across the enterprise.
The supply chain is only as strong as its weak­
est link. Companies use supply chain manage­
ment metrics to measure the performance 
of supply chains to identify weak 
links quickly. A few of the com­
mon supply chain management 
metrics include:
∙	 Back order: An unfilled cus­
tomer order for a product 
that is out of stock.
	∙	 Inventory cycle 
time: The time it 
takes to manu­
facture a product 
and deliver it to the 
retailer.
	∙	 Customer order cycle time: The agreed upon time between 
the purchase of a product and the delivery of the product.
	∙	 Inventory turnover: The frequency of inventory replacement.

evidence shows that this type of supply chain 
design results in superior supply chain capa­
bilities and profits.
Supply chain visibility is the ability to view 
all areas up and down the supply chain in 
real time. To react to demand, an organiza­
tion needs to know all customer events trig­
gered upstream and downstream and so must 
their suppliers and their suppliers’ suppliers. 
Without this information, supply chain par­
ticipants are blind to the supply and demand needs occurring 
in the marketplace, a factor required to implement successful 
business strategies. To improve visibility across the supply 
chain, firms can use supply chain planning systems and supply 
chain execution systems.

CHAPTER 8  |  Enterprise Applications: Business Communications  217
Supply chain planning systems use advanced mathematical 
algorithms to improve the flow and efficiency of the supply 
chain while reducing inventory. To yield accurate results, how­
ever, supply chain planning systems require information inputs 
that are correct and up to date regarding customers, orders, 
sales, manufacturing, and distribution capabilities.
Ideally, the supply chain consists of multiple firms that function 
as efficiently and effectively as a single firm, with full infor­
mation visibility. Supply chain execution systems ensure 
supply chain cohesion by automating the different activities of 
the supply chain. For example, a supply chain execution sys­
tem might electronically route orders from a manufacturer to 
a supplier using electronic data interchange (EDI), a stan­
dard format for the electronic exchange of information between 
supply chain participants. Figure 8.10 details how supply chain 
planning and supply chain execution systems interact with the 
supply chain.
A good example of inventory issues that occur when a com­
pany does not have a clear vision of its entire supply chain 
is the bullwhip effect. The bullwhip effect occurs when 
distorted product-demand infor­
mation ripples from one partner 
to the next throughout the sup­
ply chain. The misinformation 
regarding a slight rise in demand 
for a product could cause differ­
ent members in the supply chain 
to stockpile inventory. These 
changes ripple throughout the sup­
ply chain, magnifying the issue 
and creating excess inventory and 
costs for all. For example, if a car 
dealership is having a hard time 
moving a particular brand of car, 
it might offer significant discounts 
to try to move the inventory. 
Without this critical information, 
the car manufacturer might see a 
rise in demand for this particular 
brand of car and increase pro­
duction orders, not realizing that 
the dealerships are actually chal­
lenged with selling the 
inventory. Today, integrated supply chains provide 
managers with the visibility to see their suppliers’ 
and customers’ supply chains, ensuring that supply 
always meets demand.

REINVENTING THE 
SUPPLY CHAIN  LO8.3
LO8.3  Identify the three technologies that are reinventing the 
supply chain.
Optimizing the supply chain is a critical business process for 
any successful organization. Just think of the complexity of 
Walmart’s supply chain and the billions of products being sent 
around the world guaranteeing every shelf is fully stocked. The 
three components of supply chain management on which com­
panies focus to find efficiencies include procurement, logistics, 
and materials management (see Figure 8.11).
Procurement is the purchasing of goods and services to meet 
the needs of the supply chain. The procurement process is a 
key supply chain strategy because the capability to purchase 
input materials at the right price is directly correlated to the 
company’s ability to operate. Without the right inputs, the com­
pany simply can’t create cost-effective outputs. For example, 
if McDonald’s could not procure potatoes or had to purchase 
potatoes at an outrageous price, it would be unable to create 
and sell its famous french fries. In fact, procuring the right size 
potatoes that can produce the famous long french fries is chal­
lenging in some countries where locally grown potatoes are too 
small. Procurement can help a company answer the following 
questions:
	∙	 What quantity of raw materials should we purchase to mini­
mize spoilage?
	∙	 How can we guarantee that our raw materials meet produc­
tion needs?
	∙	 At what price can we purchase materials to guarantee 
profitability?
	∙	 Can purchasing all products from a single vendor provide 
additional discounts?
Logistics includes the processes that control the distribution, 
maintenance, and replacement of materials and personnel to 
support the supply chain. Recall from the value chain analysis 
in Chapter 1 that the primary value activities for an organiza­
tion include inbound and outbound logistics. Inbound logistics 
acquires raw materials and resources and distributes them to 
manufacturing as required. Outbound logistics distributes goods 
and services to customers. Logistics controls processes inside a 
company (warehouse logistics) and outside a company (trans­
port logistics) and focuses on the physical execution part of the 
supply chain. Logistics includes the increasingly complex man­
agement of processes, information, and communication to take a 
product from cradle to grave. Cradle-to-grave provides logis­
tics support throughout the entire system or life of the product. 
Logistics can help a company answer the following questions:
	∙	 What is the quickest way to deliver products to our customers?
	∙	 What is the optimal way to place items in the warehouse for 
picking and packing?

	∙	 What is the optimal path to an item in the warehouse?
	∙	 What path should the vehicles follow when delivering the 
goods?
	∙	 What areas or regions are the trucks covering?
Materials management includes activities that govern the 
flow of tangible, physical materials through the supply chain 
such as shipping, transport, distribution, and warehousing. In 
materials management, you focus on quality and quantity of 
materials as well as on how you will plan, acquire, use, and 
dispose of such materials. It can include the handling of liq­
uids, fuel, produce, and plants 
and a number of other poten­
tially hazardous items. Mate­
rials management focuses on 
handling all materials safely, 
efficiently, and in compliance 
with regulatory requirements 
and disposal requirements. 
Materials management can 
help a company answer the 
following concerns:
	∙	 What are our current inven­
tory levels?
	∙	 What items are running low 
in the warehouse?
	∙	 What items are at risk of 
spoiling in the warehouse?
	∙	 How do we dispose of 
spoiled items?
	∙	 What laws need to be fol­
lowed for storing hazardous 
materials?
	∙	 Which items must be refrig­
erated when being stored 
and transported?
	∙	 What are the requirements to 
store or transport fragile items?
As with all other areas of busi­
ness, disruptive technologies are 
continuously being deployed to 
help businesses find competitive advantages in each component 
of the supply chain, as outlined in Figure 8.12.
3D Printing Supports Procurement
The process of 3D printing (additive manufacturing) builds—
layer by layer in an additive process—a three-dimensional solid 
object from a digital model. The additive manufacturing process 
of 3D printing is profoundly different from traditional manu­
facturing processes. The Financial Times and other sources are 
stating that 3D printing has the potential to be vastly more dis­
ruptive to business than the Internet. That is a bold statement!

3D Printing for Poverty
Thirty-three-year-old Kodjo Afate Grikou wanted 
to help his community in West Africa to print 
necessities that they can’t source locally, such 
as kitchen utensils for cooking. The structure of 
the 3D printer he had in mind uses very little in 
terms of new parts because it is mostly made 
up of ewaste and scrap metal. Before building 
this printer, he set up his project on the Euro­
pean social funding website, ulule. The project 
received more than $10,000, despite the printer 
costing only $1,000, mostly through purchasing 
new parts that he couldn’t find locally. Grikou 
hopes that his innovation will inspire teenag­
ers and young people in his community to 
attend school and gain an education so they 
can make further life-changing developments 
that will benefit not only their lives but also oth­
ers around them. In a group, brainstorm ways 
3D printing can help rural communities fight 
poverty.
220  MODULE 3  |  Enterprise MIS
The reason people are betting on 
3D printing to disrupt business is 
that it brings production closer to 
users, thus eliminating steps in 
the supply chain similar to dis­
intermediation by the Internet. 
Three-dimensional printing also 
promotes 
mass 
customization, 
small production batches, and 
reduction in inventory. Tradition­
ally, the costs associated with 3D 
printing made it accessible only 
to large corporations. Now with 
inexpensive printers, scanners, 
and applications, the technology 
is accessible to small and mid-
sized businesses and home users. 
With the advances in 3D printing, 
the need to procure materials will 
become far easier because busi­
nesses can simply print the parts 
and components required for the 
production process. There is no 
doubt about it—3D printing will 
affect production process and 
supply chains and cause business 
disruption. These printers are cre­
ating auto parts, cell phone covers, 
jewelry, toys, bicycles, and manu­
facturing prototypes for testing 
purposes.
To print a 3D product, users create a digital model that is 
sliced into thin cross-sections called layers. During the print­
ing process, the 3D printer starts at the bottom of the design 
and adds successive layers of material to complete the project. 
Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing 
(CAD/CAM) systems are used to create the digital designs and 
then manufacture the products. For example, a user creates a 
design with a CAD application and then manufactures the prod­
uct by using CAM systems. Before 3D printers existed, creat­
ing a prototype was time-consuming and expensive, requiring 
skilled craftsmen and specific machinery. Instead of sending 
modeling instructions to a production company, advances in 
3D printing allow users to create prototypes and products on 
demand from their desks. Shipping required parts from around 
the world could become obsolete because the spare parts can 
now be 3D printed on demand. This could have a major impact 
on how businesses large and small operate and interact on a 
global scale in the future.
The maker movement is a cultural trend that places value 
on an individual’s ability to be a creator of things as well as 
a consumer of things. In this culture, individuals who create 
things are called “makers.” The movement is growing rap­
idly and is expected to be economically disruptive; as ordi­
nary people become more self-sufficient, they will be able 
to make their own products instead of procuring brand-name 
products from retail stores. Makers come from all walks of 
life, with diverse skill sets and interests. The thing they have 
in common is creativity, an interest in design, and access to 
tools and raw materials that make production possible. The 
growth of the maker movement is often attributed to the 
rise of community makerspaces, a community center that 
provides technology, manufacturing equipment, and educa­
tional opportunities to the public that would otherwise be 
inaccessible or unaffordable. Although the majority of mak­
ers are hobbyists, entrepreneurs and small manufacturers are 
also taking advantage of the classes and tools available in 
makerspaces.

be home-based supply chain fulfillment. Walgreens is dif­

The Three Components to an RFID System
Tag - A microchip holds data, in this case an EPC (electronic
product code), a set of numbers unique to an item. The rest of
the tag is an antenna that transmits data to a reader.
EPC example: 01-0000A77-000136BR5
Reader - A reader uses radio waves to read the tag and
sends the EPC to computers in the supply chain.
Computer Network - Each computer in the supply chain
recognizes the EPC and pulls up information related to the item,
such as dates made and shipped, price, and directions for use,
from a server maintained by the manufacturer. The computers
track the item’s location throughout the supply chain.

electronically and then at their convenience go to the store 
to pick up their goods at a special self-service counter or the 
drive-through window. Walgreens is making a promise that 
goes beyond low prices and customer service and extends 
right into the home.
Radio-frequency identification (RFID) uses electronic tags 
and labels to identify objects wirelessly over short distances. 
It holds the promise of replacing existing identification tech­
nologies such as the bar code. RFID tags are evolving, too, 
and the advances will provide more granular information to 
enterprise software. Today’s tags can store an electronic prod­
uct code. In time, tags could hold more information, making 
them portable mini-databases. RFID’s Electronic Prod­
uct Code (RFID EPC) promotes serialization or the ability 
to track individual items by using the unique serial number 
associated with each RFID tag. Although a bar code might 
identify a product such as a bottle of salad dressing, an RFID 
EPC tag can identify each specific bottle and allow item-level 
tracking to determine whether the product has passed its expi­
ration date. Businesses can tell automatically where all its 
items are in the supply chain just by gathering the data from 
the RFID chips. The possibilities of RFID are endless, and 
one area it is affecting is logistics. RFID tags for applications 
such as highway toll collection and container tracking remain 
in continuous use for several years. Like regular electronic 
components, the tags are adhered to rigid substrates and 
packaged in plastic enclosures. In 
contrast, tags on shipping cartons 
are used for a much shorter time 
and are then destroyed. Dispos­
able tags are adhered to printed, 
flexible labels pasted onto the 
carton, and these smart labels 
contain an RFID chip and antenna 
on the back. A thermal printer/
encoder 
prints 
alphanumeric 
and bar code data on the labels 
while encoding the chip at the 
same time. Figures 8.13 and 8.14 
display how an RFID system 
works in the supply chain.
Drones Support 
Logistics
A drone is an unmanned air­
craft that can fly autonomously, 
or without a human. Amazon.
com is piloting drone aircraft for 
package deliveries. Amazon is 
now working on small drones that 
could someday deliver customers’ 
packages in half an hour or less. 
UPS and FedEx have also been 
experimenting with their own ver­
sions of flying parcel carriers. Drones are already here and 
use GPS to help coordinate the logistics of 
package delivery. The problems with drones 
include FAA approval and the advanced abil­
ity to detect and avoid objects. GPS coordi­
nates can easily enable the drone to find the 
appropriate package delivery location, but 
objects not included in the GPS, such as cars, 
dogs, and children, will need to be detected 
and avoided.
FedEx founder Fred Smith stated that his 
drones are up and running in the lab; all he 
requires to move his fleet of drones from the 
lab to production is approval from regulators. 
“We have all this stuff working in the lab right 
now, we don’t need to reinvent the wheel,” 
remarks Smith. “We need a set of rules from 
the FAA. It’s just a matter of getting the laws 
in place so companies can begin building to 
those specifications and doing some real field 
testing.”2

RFID tags are added to every product and shipping box. At every step of an item’s journey, a
reader scans one of the tags and updates the information on the server.
The Home
The consumer can have the tag disabled at the store for privacy
or place readers in closets to keep track of clothes. With
customers’ approval, stores can follow purchasing patterns and
notify them of sales.
The Store
Tags are scanned upon arrival to update inventory. At the racks,
readers scan tags as shirts are stocked. At the checkout counter, a
cashier can scan individual items with a handheld reader. As items
leave the store, inventory is updated. Manufacturers and retailers
can observe sales patterns in real time and make swift decisions
about production, ordering, and pricing.

3D Printing Weapons
In 1976, the big movie studios sued Sony for releasing the first VCR 
because it advertised it as “a way of recording feature-length movies 
from TV to VHS tape for watching and taking over to friends’ houses.” 
Over the next eight years Universal Studios, along with other powerful 
media groups, fought Sony over creating the device because it could 
allow users to violate copyright laws. The courts went back and forth 
for years attempting to determine whether Sony would be held liable 
for creating a device that enabled users to break copyright laws. In 
1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Sony: “If a device is 
capable of sustaining a substantial non-infringing use, then it is lawful 
to make and sell that device. That is, if the device is merely capable of 
doing something legit, it is legal to make no matter how it is used in 
practice.”
Just think of cars, knives, guns, and computers as they are all used 
to break the law, and nobody would be allowed to produce them if they 
were held responsible for how people used them. Do you agree that if 
you make a tool and sell it to someone who goes on to break the law, 
you should be held responsible? Do you agree that 3D printers will be 
used to infringe copyright, trademark, and patent protections? If so, 
should 3D printers be illegal?

sensory input. The term robot was coined by Czech playwright 
Karl Capek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots), 
which opened in Prague in 1921. Robota is the Czech word 
for “forced labor.” The term robotics was introduced by writer 
Isaac Asimov; in his science fiction book I, Robot, published in 
1950, he presented three laws of robotics:
  1.  A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, 
allow a human being to come to harm.
2.  A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings 
except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3.  A robot must protect its own existence as long as such pro­
tection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.4
You can find robots in factories performing high-precision 
tasks, in homes vacuuming the floor and the pool, and in 
dangerous situations such as cleaning toxic wastes or defus­
ing bombs. Amazon alone has more than 10,000 robots in 
its warehouses, picking, packing, and managing ­materials 
to fulfill customer orders. The robots are made by Kiva 
Systems, a company Amazon bought for $775 million in 
2012. Kiva pitches its robots—which can cost between a 
few ­million dollars and as much as roughly $20 million—as 
simplifying and reducing costs via materials management. 
The robots are tied into a complex grid that optimizes item 
placement in the warehouse and allows the robots to pick the 

Fixing the Post Office5
Is there anything more frustrating than 
waiting in line at the Post Office? Well, 
not only are those lines frustrating, 
they are also becoming unprofitable. 
The United States Postal Service is 
looking at a $15 billion loss, one of 
the greatest catastrophes in its 
history.
What is killing the Post Office? 
Perhaps it is Stamps.com, a website that allows 
you to customize and print your own stamps 24 hours a day. Getting mar­
ried? You can place a photo of the happy couple right on the stamp for 
the invitations. Starting a business? You can place your business logo on 
your stamps. Stamps.com even keeps track of all of a customer’s postal 
spending using client codes, and it can recommend optimal delivery 
methods. Plus, Stamps.com gives you postage discounts you can’t even 
get at the Post Office or with a postage meter.
What new products are stealing business from the Post Office? How 
could the Post Office create new products and services to help grow its 
business? How could the Post Office use cost, quality, delivery, flexibility,

Robots Took My Job3
Kiva’s little orange robots are becoming the latest craze and a truly fas­
cinating innovation in warehouse management. Kiva’s robots are replac­
ing conveyor belts and carousels at the order fulfillment warehouses of 
retailers such as Zappos, Staples, and Diapers.com.
According to the Kiva site, the Kiva Mobile Fulfillment System (Kiva 
MFS) uses a breakthrough parallel processing approach to order ful­
fillment with a unique material handling system that simultaneously 
improves productivity, speed, accuracy, and flexibility. Every distribu­
tion center (DC) strives to attain flexible, efficient order fulfillment but 
struggles with the limitations of current tools. Traditional automation 
and sortation systems such as conveyors, tilt tray sorters, sliding shoe 
sorters, horizontal and vertical carousels, and other automated material 
handling systems simply tinker with Henry Ford’s serial assembly line 
concept. Kiva Systems has created an innovative order fulfillment system 
that eliminates the constraints of existing warehouse automation and 
puts the supplier back in control.
In distribution centers, warehouses, and manufacturing plants 
equipped with the Kiva MFS, operators stand still while the products 
come to them. Pallets, cases, and orders are stored on inventory pods 
that are picked up and moved by a fleet of mobile robotic drive units. As 
a result, any product can go to any operator at any time to fill any order.
One of Kiva’s biggest customers, Zappos, was acquired by Amazon. 
Why would this information be important to Kiva? What impact could 
Amazon have on Kiva’s business? What impact could Kiva have on 
Amazon’s business? What other types of businesses could use Kiva to 
improve distribution productivity? How would your warehouse employ­
ees react if you told them you were looking at implementing Kiva robots?

inventory items and bring them to the workers for packing. 
Watching an order fulfillment center equipped with Kiva 
robots is amazing; the operators stand still while the products 
come to them. Inventory pods store the products that are car­
ried and transferred by a small army of little orange robots, 
eliminating the need for traditional systems such as convey­
ors and sorters. Though assessing the costs and benefits of 
robots versus human labor can be difficult, Kiva boasts that a 
packer working with its robots can fulfill three to four times 
as many orders per hour. Zappos, Staples, and Amazon are 
just a few of the companies taking advantage of the latest 
innovation in warehouse management by replacing tradi­
tional order fulfillment technologies such as conveyor belts 
with Kiva’s little orange robots.

CUSTOMER 
RELATIONSHIP 
MANAGEMENT   LO8.4
Today, most competitors are simply a mouse-click away. This 
intense marketplace has forced organizations to switch from 
being sales focused to being customer focused. Customer 
relationship management (CRM) involves managing all 
aspects of a customer’s relationship with an organization to 
increase customer loyalty and retention and an organization’s 
profitability. CRM allows an organization to gain insights into 
customers’ shopping and buying behaviors in order to develop 
and implement enterprisewide strategies. The key players in 
CRM initiatives are outlined in Figure 8.16. CRM strategic 
goals include:
	∙	 Identify sales opportunities.
	∙	 Classify low-value customers and create marketing promo­
tions  to increase consumer spending.
	∙	 Classify 
high-value 
customers 
and 
create 
marketing  
­promotions to increase consumer loyalty.
	∙	 Analyze marketing promotions by product, market segment, 
and sales region.

FIG U R E 8.18   Customer Relationship Management Overview
The complicated piece of the CRM puzzle is identifying cus­
tomers and the many communication channels they use to con­
tact companies including call centers, web access, email, sales 
representatives, faxes, and cell phones. A single customer may 
access an organization multiple times through many different 
channels (see Figure 8.17). CRM systems can help to collect all 
of the points of customer contact along with sales and financial 
information to provide a complete view of each customer (see 
Figure 8.18.) CRM systems track every communication 
between the customer and the organization and provide access 
to cohesive customer information for all business areas from 
accounting to order fulfillment. Understanding all customer 
communications allows the organization to communicate effec­
tively with each customer. It gives the organization a detailed 
understanding of each customer’s products and services record 
regardless of the customer’s preferred communication chan­
nel. For example, a customer service representative can easily 
view detailed account information and history through a CRM 
system when providing information to a customer such as 
expected delivery dates, complementary product information, 
and customer payment and billing information.
Companies that understand individual customer needs are best 
positioned to achieve success. Of course, building successful 
customer relationships is not a new business practice; how­
ever, implementing CRM systems allows a company to oper­
ate more efficiently and effectively in the area of supporting

customer needs. CRM moves far beyond technology by iden­
tifying customer needs and designing specific marketing cam­
paigns tailored to each. This enables a firm to treat customers as 
individuals, gaining important insights into their buying prefer­
ences and shopping behaviors. Firms that treat their customers 
well reap the rewards and generally see higher profits and highly 
loyal customers. Identifying the most valuable customers allows 
a firm to ensure that these customers receive the highest levels 
of customer service and are offered the first opportunity to pur­
chase new products. ­Customer ­analytics involves gathering, 
classifying, comparing, and studying customer data to identify 
buying trends, at-risk customers, and potential future opportuni­
ties. Sales analytics involves gathering, classifying, compar­
ing, and studying company sales data to analyze product cycles, 
sales pipelines, and competitive intelligence. Software with 
advanced analytics capabilities helps you attract and retain loyal 
and profitable customers and gives you the insight you need to 
increase revenues, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty.
Firms can find their most valuable customers by using the RFM 
formula—recency, frequency, and monetary value. In other 
words, an organization must track:
	∙	 How recently a customer purchased items.
	∙	 How frequently a customer purchases items.
	∙	 The monetary value of each customer purchase.
After gathering this initial CRM information, the firm can ana­
lyze it to identify patterns and create marketing campaigns and 
sales promotions for different customer segments. For exam­
ple, if a customer buys only at the height of the season, the firm 
should send a special offer during the off-season. If a certain 
customer segment purchases shoes but never accessories, the 
firm can offer discounted accessories with the purchase of a 
new pair of shoes. If the firm determines that its top 20 percent 
of customers are responsible for 80 percent of the revenue, it 
can focus on ensuring these customers are always satisfied and 
receive the highest levels of customer service.
There are three phases of CRM: (1) reporting, (2) analyzing, 
and (3) predicting. CRM reporting technologies help organi­
zations identify their customers across other applications. CRM 
analysis technologies help organizations segment their cus­
tomers into categories such as best and worst customers. CRM 
predicting technologies help organizations predict cus­
tomer behavior, such as which customers are at risk of leaving.
Figure 8.19 highlights a few of the important questions an orga­
nization can answer in these areas by using CRM technologies.
The Power of the 
Customer
A standard rule of business states 
that the customer is always right. 
Although most businesses use this 
as their motto, they do not actually 
mean it. Ebusiness firms, how­
ever, must adhere to this rule as 
the power of the customer grows 
exponentially in the information 
age. Various websites and vid­
eos on YouTube reveal the power 
of the individual consumer (see 
Figure 8.20). A decade ago if you 
had a complaint against a com­
pany, you could make a phone 
call or write a letter. Now you can 
contact hundreds or thousands of 
people around the globe and voice 
your complaint or anger with a

CHAPTER 8  |  Enterprise Applications: Business Communications  227

Nice Emotions
New emotion-detection software called Perform, created by Nice 
Systems, helps firms improve customer service by identifying call­
ers who are displeased or upset. Perform determines a baseline 
of emotion and can detect emotional issues during the first few 
seconds of a call; any variation from the baseline activates an 
alert. When an elderly person who was highly distressed over 
medical costs hung up during a phone call to the insurance com­
pany, Perform identified the customer’s frustration and automati­
cally emailed a supervisor. The supervisor was able to review 
a recording of the conversation and immediately called 
the customer back suggesting ways to lower the costs.
How do you think emotion-detection software will affect 
customer relationships? What other departments or busi­
ness processes could benefit from its use? Create a new 
product that uses emotion-detection software. What 
business problem would your product solve and who 
would be your primary customers?

company or product. You—the 
customer—can now take your 
power directly to millions of 
people, and companies have to 
listen.
Measuring CRM Suc­
cess  Using CRM metrics to 
track and monitor performance 
is a best practice for many com­
panies. Figure 8.21  displays a 
few common CRM metrics a 
manager can use to track the 
success of the system. Just 
remember that you only want to 
track between five and seven of 
the hundreds of CRM metrics available.
Operational and Analytical CRM
The two primary components of a CRM strategy are opera­
tional CRM and analytical CRM. Operational CRM supports 
traditional transactional processing for day-to-day front-office 
operations or systems that deal directly with the customers. Ana­
lytical CRM supports back-office operations and strategic anal­
ysis and includes all systems that do not deal directly with the 
customers. Figure 8.22 provides an overview of the two.
Figure 8.23  shows the different technologies marketing, 
sales, and customer service departments can use to perform 
operational CRM.
Marketing and Operational

Companies are no longer trying to sell one product to 
as many customers as possible; instead, they are try­

ability to gather and analyze the right customer information. The 
three primary operational CRM technologies a marketing depart­

2.	 Campaign management.
3.	 Cross-selling and up-selling.

marketing campaigns. These sources 
include website visits, questionnaires, 
surveys, marketing mailers, and so 
on. After compiling the customer 
list, it can be filtered based on crite­
ria such as household income, gender, 
education level, political facilitation, 
age, or other factors. List generators 
provide the marketing department 
with valuable information on the type 
of customer it must target to find suc­

Two key sales strategies a marketing 
campaign can deploy are cross-selling 
and up-selling. Cross-selling is sell­

lars. Emotional email pleas sent by imposters, 
such as “I’m stuck in London and I’ve been 
robbed, help me,” have become so effective 
that the FBI has issued warnings to consum­
ers about social networking sites. “Fraudsters 
continue to hijack accounts on social net­
working sites and spread malicious software 
by using various techniques,” the FBI stated 
after logging 3,200 complaints about such 
incidents within a week.
When Barry Schwartz logged on to Twit­
ter, he had 20 messages waiting for him, 
all with the unwelcome news: someone was 
impersonating his company on Twitter. Schwartz 
runs RustyBrick, a 15-employee, $2 million 
website development company. The impos­
tor had set up a profile using a slight variation 
of the company’s name and started following 
Schwartz’s 4,000 customer contacts with a 
message similar to spam: “Hey guys, you have 
to get this new Twitter Success Guide—it’s 
priceless.” A devastated Schwartz stated, “The 
last thing I want is to have people thinking that 
I’m following them and I’m selling a Twitter 
Success Guide.”
Internet impostors impersonate organi­
zations as well as individuals. What could 
happen to an organization whose custom­
ers are contacted by an impostor asking 
for money or selling a product? What hap­
pens when the relationship with a cus­
tomer turns sour? What type of power does 
a disgruntled customer or employee have 
against a company? Why is it more important 
than ever to build strong relationships with 
your customers, employees, partners, and 
  suppliers?

you were to purchase Tim Burton’s movie Alice in Wonderland 
on Amazon, you would also be asked if you want to purchase 
the movie’s soundtrack or the original book. Amazon is taking 
advantage of cross-selling by offering customers goods across 
its book, movie, and music product lines. Up-selling is increas­
ing the value of the sale. McDonald’s performs upselling by ask­
ing customers whether they would like to super-size their meals 
for an extra cost. CRM systems offer marketing departments 
all kinds of information about customers and products, which 
can help identify up-selling and cross-selling opportunities to 
increase revenues.
Sales and Operational CRM
Sales departments were the first to begin developing CRM sys­
tems. They had two primary motivations to track customer sales 
information electronically. First, sales representatives were 
struggling with the overwhelming amount of customer account 
information they were required to maintain and track. Second, 
managers found themselves hindered because much of their 
vital customer and sales information remained in the heads of 
their sales representatives, even if the sales representative left 
the company. Finding a way to track customer information 
became a critical success factor for many sales departments. 
Customer service and support (CSS) is a part of operational 
CRM that automates service requests, complaints, product 
returns, and information requests.
Figure 8.24 depicts the typical sales process, which begins with 
an opportunity and ends with billing the customer for the sale. 
Leads and potential customers are the lifeblood of all sales 
organizations, whether they sell computers, clothing, consult­
ing, or cars. How leads are handled can make the difference 
between revenue growth and decline.
Sales force automation (SFA) automatically tracks all the 
steps in the sales process. SFA products focus on increasing 
customer satisfaction, building customer relationships, and

improving product sales. The three primary operational CRM 
technologies a sales department can adopt are:
	1.	 Sales management CRM systems.
	2.	 Contact management CRM systems.
	3.	 Opportunity management CRM systems.
Sales Management CRM Systems
Sales management CRM systems automate each phase 
of the sales process, helping individual sales representatives 
coordinate and organize all their accounts. Features include 
calendars, reminders for important tasks, multimedia presen­
tations, and document generation. These systems can even 
provide an analysis of the sales cycle and calculate how each 
individual sales representative is performing during the sales 
process.
Contact Management CRM Systems
A contact management CRM system maintains customer con­
tact information and identifies prospective customers for future 
sales, using tools such 
as organizational charts, 
detailed customer notes, and 
supplemental sales informa­
tion. For example, a contact 
management system can 
take an incoming telephone 
number and automatically 
display the person’s name 
along with a comprehensive 
history including all com­
munications with the com­
pany. This allows the sales 
representative to personal­
ize the phone conversation 
and ask such things as, 
“How is your new laptop 
working, Sue?” or “How 
was your family vacation to 
Colorado?” The customer 
feels valued since the sales 
associate knows her name 
and even remembers details 
of their last conversation.
Opportunity Management CRM Systems
Opportunity management CRM systems target sales 
opportunities by finding new customers or companies for 
future sales. They determine potential customers and compet­
itors and define selling efforts including budgets and sched­
ules. Advanced systems can even calculate the probability of 
a sale, which can save sales representatives significant time 
and money when qualifying new customers. The primary 
difference between contact management and opportunity 
management is that contact management deals with existing 
customers and opportunity management with new or potential 
customers.
Customer Service and Operational 
CRM
Most companies recognize the importance of building strong 
customer relationships during the marketing and sales efforts, 
but they must continue this effort by building strong post-
sale relationships also. A primary reason firms lose custom­
ers is due to negative customer service experiences. Providing

Customer Power to the Rescue7
Today, when one of your customers is unhappy, you don’t have to worry 
about them telling a few friends and family; you have to worry about 
them telling everyone on the planet. Disgruntled employees and cus­
tomers have many channels they can use to fight back against a faulty 
product or unethical company. Free or low-cost websites empower con­
sumers to tell not only their friends, but also the world, about the way 
they have been treated. Here are a few examples:
	•	 Bad experience with Blue Marble Biking: Tourist on biking tour is 
bitten by a dog and requires stitches. Company is barred from hotel 
because of incident; in turn, it bars the tourist from any further tours.
	•	 Best Buy receipt check: Shopper declines to show register receipt 
for purchase to door guard at Lakewood Best Buy, which is voluntary. 
Employees attempt to seize cart, stand in shopper’s path, and park a 
truck behind shopper’s car to prevent departure.
	•	 Enterprise Rent-A-Car is a failing enterprise: Enterprise Rent-A-Car did 
not honor reservations, did not have cars ready as stated, rented cars with 
nearly empty tanks, and charged higher prices to corporate account holders.
The Internet is raising the stakes for customer service. With the ability 
to create a website dedicated to a particular issue, a disgruntled cus­
tomer can have nearly the same reach as a manufacturer.
The Internet is making it more difficult for companies to ignore their 
customers’ complaints. Search the web for the most outrageous story of 
a disgruntled customer.

outstanding customer service is 
challenging, and many CRM tech­
nologies can assist organizations 
with this important activity. The 
three primary ones are:
1.	 Contact center.
2.	 Web-based self-service.
3.	 Call scripting.
Contact Center  A con­
tact center or call ­center is 
where customer service represen­
tatives answer customer inquiries 
and solve problems, usually by email, chat, or phone. It is one 
of the best assets a customer-driven organization can have 
because maintaining a high level of customer support is critical 
to obtaining and retaining customers. Figure 8.25 highlights a 
few of the services contact center systems offer.
Contact centers also track customer communication histories 
along with problem resolutions—information critical for pro­
viding a comprehensive customer view to the service repre­
sentative. Representatives who can quickly comprehend the 
customer’s concerns provide tremendous value to the customer 
and to the company. Nothing makes frustrated customers hap­
pier than not having to explain their problems all over again to 
yet another customer service representative.
Web-Based Self-Service  Web-based self-service 
systems allow customers to use the web to find answers to 
their questions or solutions to their problems. FedEx uses web-
based self-service systems to let customers electronically track 
packages without having to talk to a customer service represen­
tative. Another feature of web-based self-service is click-­to-
talk functions, which allow customers to click on a button and 
talk with a representative via the Internet. Powerful customer-
driven features such as these add value to any organization 
by providing customers with real-time information that helps 
resolve their concerns.

Straight Jacket Customer Service
You might not want to put the fact that you won the Straightjacket 
Award on your résumé unless you worked for Rackspace, a 
Texas company that specializes in hosting websites. 
At Rackspace, the coveted Straightjacket Award is 
won by the employee who best delivers “fanatical 
customer support,” one of the firm’s critical success 
factors. The company motivates its customer service 
representatives by dividing them into teams, each 
responsible for its own profitability. The company then 
measures such things as customer turnover, up-selling, 
cross-selling, and referrals. The team with the highest 
scores wins the Straightjacket Award and each member receives a 
20 percent bonus.
Assume your professor has hired you as the employee relation­
ship manager for your class. What type of award would you create 
to help increase class participation? What type of award would you 
create to help increase the overall average on exams? What type of 
award would you create to help increase student collaboration? Be 
sure to name your awards and describe their details. Also, what type 
of metrics would you create to measure your awards? How could a 
CRM system help you implement your awards?
call scripting 
system  Gathers 
product details and issue 
resolution information 
that can be automatically 
generated into a script 
for the representative to 
read to the customer.
uplift modeling  A 
form of predictive 
analytics for marketing 
campaigns that attempts 
to identify target markets 
or people who could 
be convinced to buy 
products.

as age, location, gender,

Occurs when a website 
has stored enough data 
about a person’s likes 
and dislikes to fashion

CHAPTER 8  |  Enterprise Applications: Business Communications  233
Call Scripting
Companies that market and sell highly technical products have 
a difficult time finding competent customer service represen­
tatives. Call scripting systems gather product details and 
issue resolution information that can be automatically gener­
ated into a script for the representative to read to the customer. 
These systems even provide questions the representative can 
ask the customer to troubleshoot the problem and find a reso­
lution. This feature not only helps reps answer difficult ques­
tions quickly but also presents a uniform response so customers 
don’t receive different answers.
Analytical CRM
Analytical CRM provides information about customers and 
products that was once impossible to locate, such as which type 
of marketing and sales campaign to launch and which custom­
ers to target and when. Unlike operational CRM, which auto­
mates call centers and sales forces with the aim of enhancing 
customer service, analytical CRM works by using business 
intelligence to identify patterns in 
product sales and customer behav­
iors. Uplift modeling is a form 
of predictive analytics for mar­
keting campaigns that attempts to 
identify target markets or people 
who could be convinced to buy 
products. The “uplift” refers to 
the increased sales that can follow 
after this form of analytical CRM 
analysis. Analytical CRM pro­
vides priceless customer informa­
tion, supports important business 
decisions, and plays a vital role in 
your organization’s success.
Analytical CRM tools can slice 
and dice vast amounts of infor­
mation to create custom views of 
customers, products, and market 
segments, highlighting opportu­
nities for cross-selling and up-
selling. Analytical CRM provides 
customer segmentation, which 
divides a market into categories 
that share similar attributes such 
as age, location, gender, habits, 
and so on. By segmenting cus­
tomers into groups, it becomes 
easier to create targeted mar­
keting and sales cam­
paigns, ensuring that you 
are not wasting resources 
marketing products to the 
wrong customers. Website personalization occurs 
when a website has stored enough data about a per­
son’s likes and dislikes to fashion offers more likely 
to appeal to that person. Many marketers use CRM 
to personalize customer communications and decide 
which customers are worth pursuing. Here are a few 
examples of the information insights analytical CRM 
can help an organization gain.
	∙	 Find new profitable customers: Analytical CRM could high­
light that the most profitable market segment consists of 
women between 35 and 45 years old who drive SUVs and live 
within 30 miles of the city limits. The firm could then find a way 
to locate these customers for mailings and other opportunities.
	∙	 Exceed customer expectations: Analytical CRM helps a firm 
move past the typical “Dear Mr. Smith” greeting by person­
alizing communications. For example, if the firm knows the 
customer’s favorite brand and size of shoe it can notify the 
customer that a pair of size 12 Nike cross trainers are avail­
able for him to try on the next time he visits the store.
	∙	 Discover the activities the firm performs the best: Analytical 
CRM can determine what an organization does better than its

234  MODULE 3  |  Enterprise MIS
Supplier relationship management (SRM) focuses on 
keeping suppliers satisfied by evaluating and categoriz­
ing suppliers for different projects. SRM applications help 
companies analyze suppliers based on a number of key vari­
ables including prices, inventory availability, and business 
focus or strategies. It can then determine the best supplier 
to collaborate with and develop strong relationships with to 
streamline processes, outsource services, and provide prod­
ucts the firm could not offer alone.
Partner relationship management (PRM) discov­
ers optimal sales channels by selecting the right partners 
and identifying mutual customers. A PRM system offers 
real-time sales channel information about such things as 
inventory availability, pricing strategies, and shipping 
information, allowing a company to expand its market by 
offering specialized products and services.
Employee relationship management (ERM) provides 
web-based self-service tools that streamline and automate the 
human resource department. Employees are the backbone of an 
enterprise and the communication channel to customers, part­
ners, and suppliers. Their relationship with the company is far 
more complex and long-lasting than the relationship with cus­
tomers; thus many enterprises are turning to ERM systems to 
help retain key employees.

it can purchase a specialized

ers for future mailings.
∙	 Eliminate competition: Analytical 
CRM can determine sales trends 
allowing the company to provide 
customers with special deals out­
smarting its competition. A sports 
store might identify its best custom­
ers for outdoor apparel and invite 
them to a private sale right before 
the competition runs its sale.

CHAPTER 8  |  Enterprise Applications: Business Communications  235
Enterprise resource planning (ERP) integrates all depart­
ments and functions throughout an organization into a single 
system (or integrated set of MIS systems) so that employees 
can make decisions by viewing enterprisewide information on 
all business operations.  To truly understand the complexity of 
ERP systems you must think about the many different func­
tional business areas and their associated business processes 
as well as cross-functional business processes such as supply 
chain management and customer relationship management and 
beyond. At its most basic level, ERP software integrates these 
various business functions into one complete system to stream­
line business processes and information across the entire orga­
nization. Essentially, ERP helps employees do their jobs more 
efficiently by breaking down barri­
ers between business units.
Many organizations fail to maintain 
consistency across business opera­
tions. If a single department, such 
as sales, decides to implement a 
new system without considering the 
other departments, inconsistencies 
can occur throughout the company. 
Not all systems are built to talk to 
each other and share data, and if 
sales suddenly implements a new 
system that marketing and account­
ing cannot use or 
is inconsistent in 
the way it handles 
information, 
the 
­company’s opera­
tions become siloed. Figure 8.27 displays sam­
ple data from a sales database, and Figure 8.28 
displays samples from an accounting data­
base. Notice the differences in data formats, 
numbers, and identifiers. Correlating this data 
would be difficult, and the inconsistencies 
would cause numerous reporting errors from 
an enterprisewide perspective.
The two key components of an ERP system 
help to resolve these issues and include a com­
mon data repository and modular software 
design. A common data repository allows 
every department of a company to store and 
retrieve information in real-time allowing 
information to be more reliable and acces­
sible. Module software design divides the 
system into a set of functional units (named 
modules) that can be used independently or 
combined with other modules for increased 
business flexibility. Module software design 
allows customers to mix-and-match modules 
so they purchase only the required modules. 
If a company wants to implement the sys­
tem slowly it can begin with just one mod­
ule, such as accounting, and then incorporate 
additional modules such as purchasing and 
scheduling.
ERP systems share data supporting business 
processes within and across departments.  In 
practice, this means that employees in dif­
ferent divisions—for example, accounting 
and sales—can rely on the same informa­
tion for their specific needs. ERP software 
also offers some degree of synchronized 
reporting and automation. Instead of forcing

employees to maintain separate 
databases and spreadsheets that 
have to be manually merged 
to generate reports, some ERP 
solutions allow staff to pull 
reports from one system. For 
instance, with sales orders auto­
matically flowing into the finan­
cial system without any manual 
re-keying, the order management 
department can process orders 
more quickly and accurately, and 
the finance department can close 
the books faster. Other common 
ERP features include a portal 
or dashboard to enable employ­
ees to quickly understand the 
business’s performance on key 
metrics.
Figure 8.29  shows how an ERP 
system takes data from across the 
enterprise, consolidates and corre­
lates it, and generates enterprise­
wide organizational reports.  Original ERP implementations 
promised to capture all information onto one true “enterprise” 
system, with the ability to touch all the business processes 
within the organization. Unfortunately, ERP solutions have 
fallen short of these promises, and typical implementations 
have penetrated only 15 to 20 percent of the organization. The 
issue ERP intends to solve is that knowledge within a majority 
of organizations currently resides in silos that are maintained 
by a select few, without the ability to be shared across the orga­
nization, causing inconsistency across business 
operations.
The heart of an ERP system is a central data­
base that collects information from and feeds 
information into all the ERP system’s indi­
vidual application components (called mod­
ules), supporting diverse business functions 
such as accounting, manufacturing, marketing, 
and human resources. When a user enters or 
updates information in one module, it is imme­
diately and automatically updated throughout 
the entire system, as illustrated in Figure 8.30.
ERP automates business processes such as 
order fulfillment—taking an order from a cus­
tomer, shipping the purchase, and then billing 
for it. With an ERP system, when a customer 
service representative takes an order from a 
customer, he or she has all the information nec­
essary to complete the order (the customer’s 
credit rating and order history, the company’s 
inventory levels, and the delivery schedule). 
Everyone else in the company sees the same 
information and has access to the database that holds the cus­
tomer’s new order. When one department finishes with the 
order, it is automatically routed via the ERP system to the next 
department. To find out where the order is at any point, a user 
need only log in to the ERP system and track it down, as illus­
trated in Figure 8.31. 
In most organizations, information has traditionally been iso­
lated within specific departments, whether on an individual 
database, in a file cabinet, or on an employee’s PC. ERP enables

employees across the organization to share information across a 
single, centralized database. With extended portal capabilities, 
an organization can also involve its suppliers and customers to 
participate in the workflow process, allowing ERP to penetrate 
the entire value chain, and help the organization achieve greater 
operational efficiency (see Figure 8.32).
The Benefits of ERP
Originally, ERP solutions were developed to deliver automa­
tion across multiple units of an organization, to help facili­
tate the manufacturing process and address issues such as raw 
materials, inventory, order entry, and distribution. However, 
ERP was unable to extend to other functional areas of the com­
pany such as sales, marketing, and shipping. It could not tie in 
any CRM capabilities that would allow organizations to cap­
ture customer-specific information, nor did it work with web­
sites or portals used for customer service or order fulfillment. 
Call center or quality assurance staff could not tap into the ERP 
solution, nor could ERP handle document management, such as 
cataloging contracts and purchase orders. 
ERP has grown over the years to become part of the extended 
enterprise. From its beginning as a tool for materials planning, 
it has extended to warehousing, distribution, and order entry. 
With its next evolution, ERP expands to the front office includ­
ing CRM. Now administrative, sales, marketing, and human 
resources staff can share a tool that is truly enterprisewide. To 
compete on a functional level today, companies must adopt an 
enterprisewide approach to ERP that utilizes the Internet and 
connects to every facet of the value chain. Figure 8.33 shows 
how ERP has grown to accommodate the needs of the entire 
organization.
Applications such as SCM, CRM, and 
ERP are the backbone of ebusiness. Inte­
gration of these applications is the key to 
success for many companies. Integration 
allows the unlocking of information to 
make it available to any user, anywhere, 
anytime.
Most organizations today have no choice 
but to piece their SCM, CRM, and ERP 
applications together since no one ven­
dor can respond to every organizational 
need; hence, customers purchase appli­
cations from multiple vendors. As a 
result, organizations face the challenge 
of integrating their systems. For exam­
ple, a single organization might choose 
its CRM components from Siebel, SCM 
components from i2, and financial com­
ponents and HR management compo­
nents from Oracle. Figure 8.34 displays 
the general audience and purpose for 
each of these applications that have to be 
integrated.
The current generation of ERP, ERP-II is composed of two 
primary components—core and extended. Core ERP compo­
nents are the traditional components included in most ERP 
systems and primarily focus on internal operations. Extended 
ERP components are the extra components that meet orga­
nizational needs not covered by the core components and 
primarily focus on external operations. Figure 8.35  provides 
an example of an ERP system with its core and extended 
components.
Core ERP Components
The three most common core ERP components focusing on 
internal operations are:
1.	 Accounting and finance.
2.	 Production and materials management.
3.	 Human resources.

Deeley Harley-Davidson Canada (DHDC), the exclusive 
Canadian distributor of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, has 
improved inventory, turnaround time, margins, and customer 
­satisfaction—all with the implementation of a financial ERP 
system. The system has opened up the power of information to 
the company and is helping it make strategic decisions when it 
still has the time to change things. The ERP system provides 
the company with ways to manage inventory, turnaround time, 
and warehouse space more effectively.

with functions such as general led­
ger, accounts payable, accounts 
receivable, budgeting, and asset 
management. One of the most use­
ful features included in an ERP 
accounting/finance component is its 
credit-management feature. Most 
organizations manage their rela­
tionships with customers by setting 
credit limits, or a limit on how much 
a customer can owe at any one time. 
The company then monitors the 
credit limit whenever the customer 
places a new order or sends in a pay­
ment. ERP financial systems help 
to correlate customer orders with 
customer account balances deter­
mining credit availability. Another 
great feature is the ability to per­
form product profitability analysis. 
ERP financial components are the 
backbone behind product profitabil­
ity analysis and allow companies to 
perform all types of advanced prof­
itability modeling techniques.
Production and Materials 
Management ERP   Produc­
tion and materials management 
ERP components handle produc­
tion planning and execution tasks 
such as demand forecasting, produc­
tion scheduling, job cost accounting, 
and quality control. Demand fore­
casting helps determine production 
schedules and materials purchasing. 
A company that makes its own prod­
uct prepares a detailed production 
schedule, and a company that buys 
products for resale develops a mate­
rials requirement plan. Companies 
typically produce multiple products, 
each of which has many different 
parts. Production lines, consisting of

machines and employees, build the different types of products. 
The company must then define sales forecasting for each product 
to determine production schedules and materials purchasing. Fig­
ure 8.36 displays the typical ERP production planning process. 
The process begins with forecasting sales in order to plan opera­
tions. A detailed production schedule is developed if the product 
is produced and a materials requirement plan is completed if the 
product is purchased.
Grupo Farmanova Intermed, located in Costa Rica, is a phar­
maceutical marketing and distribution company that markets 
nearly 2,500 products to approxi­
mately 500 customers in Central 
and South America. The company 
identified a need for software 
that could unify product logistics 
management in a single country. 
It decided to deploy PeopleSoft 
financial and distribution ERP 
components allowing the company to 
improve customer data management, 
increase confidence among internal and 
external users, and coordinate the logis­
tics of inventory. With the software the 
company enhanced its capabilities for 
handling, distributing, and marketing its 
pharmaceuticals.
Human Resources ERP Com­
ponents  Human resources ERP 
components track employee ­information 
including payroll, benefits, compensa­
tion, and performance assessment and 
ensure compliance with all laws. Human 
resources components even offer features 
that allow the organization to perform 
detailed analysis on its employees to 
determine such things as the identification 
of individuals who are likely to leave the 
company unless additional compensation 
or benefits are provided. These compo­
nents can also identify which employees 
are using which resources, such as online 
training and long-distance telephone services. They can also 
help determine whether the most talented people are working 
for those business units with the highest priority—or where they 
would have the greatest impact on profit.
Extended ERP Components
Extended ERP components meet the organizational needs not 
covered by the core components and primarily focus on exter­
nal operations. Many are Internet-enabled and require interac­
tion with customers, suppliers, and business partners outside

the organization. The four most common extended ERP com­
ponents are:
	1.	 Business intelligence.
	2.	 Customer relationship management.
3.  Supply chain management.
4.  Ebusiness.
Business Intelligence ERP 
Components  ERP systems offer 
powerful tools that measure and con­
trol organizational operations. Many 
organizations have found that these 
valuable tools can be enhanced to pro­
vide even greater value through the 
addition of powerful business intel­
ligence systems. The business intel­
ligence components of ERP systems 
typically collect information used 
throughout the organization (includ­
ing data used in many other ERP 
components), organize it, and apply 
analytical tools to assist managers with 
decisions. Data warehouses are one of 
the most popular extensions to ERP 
systems, with over two-thirds of U.S. 
manufacturers adopting or planning 
such systems.
Customer 
Relationship 
Management ERP Com­
ponents  ERP 
vendors 
are 
expand­ing their functionality to provide services formerly sup­
plied by customer relationship management (CRM) vendors 
such as Siebel. CRM components provide an integrated view 
of customer data and interactions allowing organizations to 
work more effectively with customers and be more responsive 
to their needs. CRM components typically include contact cen­
ters, sales force automation, and marketing functions. These 
improve the customer experience while identifying a compa­
ny’s most (and least) valuable customers for better allocation 
of resources.
Supply Chain Management ERP Compo­
nents   ERP vendors are expanding their systems to include 
SCM functions that manage the information flows between 
and among supply chain stages, maximizing total supply chain 
effectiveness and profitability. SCM components allow a firm 
to monitor and control all stages in the supply chain from the 
acquisition of raw materials to the receipt of finished goods by 
customers.
Ebusiness ERP Components  The original focus 
of ERP systems was the internal organization. In other words, 
ERP systems are not fundamentally ready for the external 
world of ebusiness. The newest and most exciting extended 
ERP components are the ebusiness components. Two of the 
primary features of ebusiness components are elogistics and 

Classic Cars
Classic Cars Inc. operates high-end automotive dealerships that offer 
luxury cars along with luxury service. The company is proud of its exten­
sive inventory, top-of-the-line mechanics, and especially its exceptional 
service, which even includes a cappuccino bar at each dealership.
The company currently has 40 sales representatives at four loca­
tions. Each location maintains its own computer systems, and all sales 
representatives have their own contact management systems. This 
splintered approach to operations causes numerous problems, including 
customer communication issues, pricing strategy issues, and inventory 
control issues. A few examples include:
	•	 A customer shopping at one dealership can go to another dealership 
and receive a different price quote for the same car.
	•	 Sales representatives are frequently stealing each other’s customers 
and commissions.
	•	 Sales representatives frequently send their customers to other deal­
erships to see specific cars and when the customer arrives, the car is 
not on the lot.
	•	 Marketing campaigns are not designed to target specific customers; 
they are typically generic, such as 10 percent off a new car.
	•	 If a sales representative quits, all of his or her customer information is 
lost.

eprocurement. Elogistics manages the transportation and 
storage of goods. Eprocurement is the business-to-business 
(B2B) online purchase and sale of supplies and services. A 
common mistake many businesses make is jumping into online 
business without properly integrating the entire organization on 
the ERP system. One large toy manufacturer announced less 
than a week before Christmas that it would be unable to fulfill 
any of its online orders. The company had all the toys in the 
warehouse, but it could not organize the basic order processing 
function to get the toys delivered to consumers on time.
Ebusiness and ERP complement each other by allowing com­
panies to establish a web presence and fulfill orders expedi­
tiously. A common mistake made by many businesses is 
deploying a web presence before the integration of back-office 
systems or an ERP system. For example, one large toy manu­
facturer announced less than a week before Christmas that it 
would be unable to fulfill any of 
its web orders. The company had 
all the toys in the warehouse, but it 
could not organize the basic order 
processing function to get the toys 
delivered to the consumers on 
time. 
Customers and suppliers are now 
demanding access to ERP infor­
mation including order status, 
inventory levels, and invoice reconciliation. Plus, the custom­
ers and partners want all this information in a simplified format 
available through a website. This is a difficult task to accom­
plish because most ERP systems are full of technical jargon, 
which is why employee training is one of the hidden costs 
associated with ERP implementations. Removing the jargon to

accommodate untrained custom­
ers and partners is one of the more 
difficult tasks when web-enabling 
an ERP system. To accommodate 
the growing needs of the ebusiness 
world, ERP vendors need to build 
two new channels of access into 
the ERP system information—one 
channel for customers (B2C) and 
one channel for businesses, sup­
pliers, and partners (B2B).
Measuring ERP 
Success
There is no guarantee of success 
for an ERP system. It is difficult to measure the success of an 
ERP system because one system can span an entire organiza­
tion, including thousands of employees across the globe. ERPs 
focus on how a corporation operates internally, and optimizing 
these operations takes significant time and energy.
Two of the primary forces driving ERP failure include software 
customization and ERP costs. Software customization mod­
ifies existing software according to the business’s or user’s 
requirements. Since ERP systems must fit business processes, 
many enterprises choose to customize their ERP systems to 
ensure that they meet business and user needs. Figure 8.37 dis­
plays the different forms of software customization a business 
will undertake to ensure the success of an ERP implementation. 
Heavy customization leads to complex code that must be con­
tinuously maintained and upgraded. It should be noted that cus­
tomizing an ERP system is costly and complex and should only 
be done when there is a specific business advantage. According 
to Meta Group, it takes the average company 8 to 18 months to 
see any benefits from an ERP system. The primary risk for an 
ERP implementation includes the associated costs displayed in 
Figure 8.38.
One of the best methods of measuring ERP success is the bal­
anced scorecard, created by Dr. Robert Kaplan and Dr. David 
Norton, both from the Harvard Business School. The balanced 
scorecard is a management system, as well as a measurement 
system, that a firm uses to translate business strategies into exe­
cutable tasks. It provides feedback for both internal and external 
business processes, allowing continuous improvement. Kaplan 
and Norton describe the balanced scorecard as follows: “The 
balanced scorecard retains traditional financial measures. But 
financial measures tell the story of past events, an adequate story 
for industrial age companies for which investments in long-term 
capabilities and customer relationships were not critical for suc­
cess. These financial measures are inadequate, however, for 
guiding and evaluating the journey that information age com­
panies must make to create future value through investment in 
customers, suppliers, employees, processes, technology, and 
innovation.”8 The balanced scorecard uses four perspectives to 
monitor an organization:
	1.	 The learning and growth perspective.
	2.	 The internal business process perspective.
	3.	 The customer perspective.
	4.	 The financial perspective (see Figure 8.39).

ORGANIZATIONAL 
INTEGRATION WITH 
ERP  LO8.6
The goal of ERP is to integrate all of the organizational systems 
into one fully functioning, high-performance system that is capa­
ble of meeting all business needs and user requirements. Tra­
ditional ERP systems were typically accessed from a computer 
on the customers’ premises or office. Tomorrow’s ERP systems 
will enhance the ability of organizations to apply context to deci­
sion making and adapt more easily to changing events.  ERP 
systems in the future will focus on usability, ubiquity, accessibil­
ity, and mobility drawing many advantages including:
	∙	 Drive cost efficiencies.
	∙	 Faster time to market.
∙	 Better enable mobile workforce.
∙	 Better leverage data to provide 
insights.
∙	 New product development.
Of course, ERP of the future will have 
many challenges including data man­
agement, source record management, 
and coordinating integrations and sup­
port activities. Figure 8.40  displays 
the three primary ERP implementa­
tion choices driving the next genera­
tion of business operations. 
On-Premise ERP
Until a decade ago, virtually all ERP 
systems were installed on-premise. 
On-premise systems include a 
server at a physical location using an 
internal network for internal access 
and firewalls for remote users’ access. 
Remote users had to access the ERP 
system through a firewall, which pro­
tected the system against unauthorized 
access. These systems are known as 
on-premise systems, and they are still 
in wide use today. The ERP, SCM, 
and CRM systems that run on-premise 
are referred to as legacy systems. Leg­
acy system is an old system that is fast approaching or beyond 
the end of its useful life with in an organization. 
Cloud ERP
The cloud has changed the legacy model of ERP implemen­
tation. According to the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) cloud computing stores, manages, and 
processes data and applications over the Internet rather than 
on a personal computer or server. Cloud computing offers new 
ways to store, access, process, and analyze information and 
connect people and resources from any location in the world an 
Internet connection is available. As shown in Figure 8.41, users 
connect to the cloud from their personal computers or portable 
devices by using a client, such as a web browser. To these indi­
vidual users, the cloud appears as their personal application, 
device, or document. It is like storing all of your software and 
documents in the cloud, and all you need is a device to access

the cloud. No more hard drives, soft­
ware, or processing power—that is 
all located in the cloud, transparent 
to the users. Users are not physically 
bound to a single computer or net­
work; they can access their programs 
and documents from wherever they 
are, whenever they need to. Just think 
of having your hard drive located in 
the sky and you can access 
your information and pro­
grams using any device 
from wherever you are. The 
best part is that even if your 
machine crashes, is lost, or 
is stolen, the information 
hosted in the cloud is safe 
and always available.
Software as a Service 
(SaaS) delivers applications 
over the cloud using a pay-
per-use revenue model. Before 
its introduction, companies 
often spent huge amounts of 
money implementing and cus­
tomizing specialized applica­
tions to satisfy their business 
requirements. Many of these 
applications 
were 
difficult 
to implement, expensive to 
maintain, and challenging to 
use. Usability was one of the 
biggest drivers for creating 
interest in and success for cloud computing service providers. SaaS 
ERP uses the cloud platform to enable organizations not only to 
unite around business processes, but also to gather cloud data 
across supplier networks and supply chains to drive greater 
efficiency in manufacturing projects. The move to SaaS ERP 
is attracting many small and midsized businesses that simply 
cannot afford the costs associated with a traditional large ERP 
implementation. 
SaaS offers a number of advantages; the most obvious is tre­
mendous cost savings. The software is priced on a per-use 
basis with no up-front costs, so companies get the immedi­
ate benefit of reducing capital expenditures. They also get the

added benefits of scalability and flexibility to test new soft­
ware on a rental basis. Figure 8.42 displays the many advan­
tages of SaaS implementations.
Cloud ERP has been slow to take off across business because 
many people were initially uncomfortable with placing sensi­
tive data in the cloud. As the tremendous cost-saving advan­
tages associated with cloud applications and SaaS become more 
apparent, the reservations against cloud ERP are dissipating. 
Large organizations tend to have difficulty adjusting to cloud 
solutions simply because they want greater levels of control over 
their enterprise applications. Smaller, less complex organiza­
tions that lack sophisticated MIS departments are more likely to 
gravitate toward the cloud because it is easy for them to change 
business processes to fit the software. SaaS ERP can provide 
a company with the flexibility of on-premise software and the 
added benefits of a vendor maintaining and housing the applica­
tions off the premises. The biggest concerns for organizations 
interested in cloud ERP solutions is data security and potential 
vendor outages causing business downtime. Without an on-
premises MIS department, the organization is truly at the mercy 
of the vendor during any system outage, and for critical organi­
zational systems like ERP, this could be an unacceptable risk. 
Hybrid ERP
It is conventional wisdom that a diversified stock portfo­
lio is a very effective hedge against investment risk. For the 
same reason, companies that are not comfortable with the 
risk and/or loss of control associated with moving whole­
sale into ERP cloud computing, but still want to explore this 
evolving infrastructure, might find a hybrid ERP approach 
to be the perfect answer. By “hybrid ERP approach,” we 
mean mostly on site, but with some carefully selected hosted 
applications.  
Building an all-encompassing ERP system traditionally ended 
in expensive failures. Nike, K-Mart, and Hershey all lost over 
$100 million in failed ERP implementations. Based on the need 
to avoid expensive failures along with the emergence of cloud 
computing, enterprises can now adopt hybrid ERP architec­
tures. The idea behind hybrid ERP is to split the ERP functions 
between an on-premises ERP system and one or more functions 
handled as Software as a Service (SaaS) in the cloud. Typically 
the on-premise legacy application operates at the corporate 
headquarters, whereas cloud-based specific applications sup­
port business needs such as mobility and web-based function­
ality. It is also becoming increasingly popular. In fact many 
analysts are predicting that hybrid ERP will become a mainstay 
in the ERP market in the next few years.
Often a hybrid ERP system is implemented when the legacy sys­
tem becomes very large and costly to customize, maintain, and 
upgrade or when mergers and acquisitions leave an organization 
with multiple ERP solutions that it is unable to consolidate to a 
single ERP system. Hybrid ERP architectures also support orga­
nizations with multiple operations based in multiple geographic 
locations. The following scenarios are common in organizations 
that use hybrid architectures of ERP: 
	∙	 A business with a very specific local focus—single-site or mul­
tisite within a single country or region. 
	∙	 A business with operations geared strongly toward a spe­
cific industry that doesn’t feature strongly at corporate 
headquarters.

Managing the data across the enterprise is one of the biggest 
concerns for organizations deploying hybrid ERP architectures. 
It is critical for the business to have absolutely no duplication 
of effort between the two ERP systems. Consistency is required 
for any hybrid application to ensure that there is always a single 
source of information for accounting, financials, customer ser­
vice, production, and other business areas. Hundreds of ERP 
vendors offer best-of-breed ERP applications or vertical market 
solutions to meet the unique requirements of specific industries

At Flavors, a premium coffee 
shop, customers receive more than just 
a great cup of coffee—they receive expo­
sure to music, art, literature, and town events. 
Flavors’ calendar for programs gives customers 
a quick view into this corner of the world—from 
live music and art displays to volunteering or a 
coffee tasting. Flavors offers the following:
	∙	 Music center: Information is available for all 
live music events occurring in the area. The 
store also hosts an open microphone two 
nights a week for local musicians.
	∙	 Art gallery: A space in the store is filled with 
great pieces from local artists.
	∙	 Book clubs: Customers can meet to discuss 
current and classic literature.
	∙	 Coffee sampler: Customers can sample cof­
fees from around the world with the experts.
	∙	 Community events: Weekly meetings are 
held, where customers can find ways to 
become more involved in their community.
	∙	 Brewing courses: The finer details of the 
brewing, grinding, and blending equipment 
for sale in Flavors stores—from the tradi­
tional press to a digital espresso machine—
are taught. There is also a trouble-shooting 
guide developed by brewing specialists.
Flavors’ sales are great and profits are soaring; 
however, current operations need an overhaul. 
The owners of Flavors, J. P. Field and Marla Lily, 
built the business piece by piece over the past 
12 years. The following offers a quick look at cur­
rent operations.
	∙	 Flavors does not receive any information 
on how many of its customers attend live 
music events. Musicians typically maintain 
a fan email listing and CD sales records for 
the event; however, this information is not 
always provided to the store.
	∙	 Book club events are booked and run 
through the local bookstore, Pages Up. 
Pages Up runs a tab during the book club 
and provides Flavors with a check at the 
end of each month for all book club events. 
Flavors has no access to book club customer 
information or sales information.
	∙	 The artist gallery is run by several local art­
ists who pay Flavors a small commission 
on each sale. Flavors has no input into the 
art contained in the store or information on 
customers who purchase art.
	∙	 Coffee sampler events are run through Fla­
vors’ primary operations.
	∙	 Community event information is open to all 
members of the community. Each event is 
run by a separate organization, which pro­
vides monthly event feedback to Flavors in 
a variety of formats from Word to Access 
files.
	∙	 Brewing and machine resource courses 
are run by the equipment manufacturer, 
and all customer and sales information is 
provided to Flavors in a Word document at 
the end of each year.
You have been hired as an integration expert

take advantage of marketing and sales 
opportunities across its many different lines 
of business, such as offering customers who 
attend book club events discounts on art and

also want to gain a better understanding of how 
the different events affect sales. For example, 
should they have more open microphone nights 
or more book clubs? Currently, they have no way 
to tell which events result in higher sales. Cre­

	LO9.1	 Describe the seven phases of the systems 
­development life cycle.
	LO9.2	 Summarize the different software development 
methodologies.
	LO9.3	 Explain why a company would implement a 
­service-oriented architecture. 
It is difficult to get an organization to work if its systems do not 
work. In the information age, software success, or failure, can 
lead directly to business success, or failure. Companies rely on 
software to drive business operations and ensure work flows 
throughout the company. As more and more companies rely on 
software to operate, so do the business-related consequences of 
software successes and failures.
The potential advantages of successful software implementa­
tions provide firms with significant incentives to manage soft­
ware development risks. However, an alarmingly high number 
of software development projects come in late or over budget, 
and successful projects tend to maintain fewer features and 
functions than originally specified. Understanding the basics 
of software development, or the systems development life 
cycle, will help organizations avoid potential software develop­
ment pitfalls and ensure that software development efforts are 
successful.
Before jumping into software development, it is important 
to understand a few key terms. A legacy system is an old 
­system that is fast approaching or beyond the end of its use­
ful life within an organization. Conversion is the process of 
transferring information from a legacy system to a new ­system. 
­Software customization modifies software to meet specific 
user or business requirements. Off-the-shelf application 
software supports general business processes and does not 
require any specific software customization to meet the orga­
nization’s needs.
The systems development life cycle (SDLC) is the over­
all process for developing information systems, from planning 
and analysis through implementation and maintenance. The 
SDLC is the foundation for all systems development methods, 
and hundreds of different activities are associated with each 
phase. These activities typically include determining bud­
gets, gathering system requirements, and writing detailed user 
documentation.
The SDLC begins with a business need, proceeds to an assess­
ment of the functions a system must have to satisfy the need, 
and ends when the benefits of the system no longer outweigh 
its maintenance costs. This is why it is referred to as a life 
cycle. The SDLC is comprised of seven distinct phases: plan­
ning, analysis, design, development, testing, implementation, 
and maintenance (see Figure 9.1).
LO9.1  Describe the seven phases of the systems development 
life cycle.
Phase 1: Planning
The planning phase establishes a high-level plan of the 
intended project and determines project goals. Planning is 
the first and most critical phase of any systems development 
effort, regardless of whether the effort is to develop a system 
that allows customers to order products online, determine

The multimillion-dollar Nike SCM system failure is legendary 
as Nike CEO Philip Knight famously stated, “This is what we 
get for our $400 million?” Nike partnered with i2 to implement 
an SCM system that never came to fruition. i2 blamed the failed 
implementation on the fact that Nike failed to use the vendor’s 
implementation methodology and templates. Nike blamed the 
failure on faulty software.1

Have You Met Ted? If 
Not, You Need To!2
You’ll remember this day because it is the day 
you were introduced to Ted (www.ted.com). 
Ted, a small nonprofit started in 1984, is devoted to 
Ideas Worth Spreading, an annual conference focused 
around three worlds: Technology, Entertainment, and 
Design. Ted brings together the world’s most fascinat­
ing thinkers and doers, who are challenged to give 
the talk of their lives in 18 minutes. Each talk is video­
taped and posted to the Ted website including such 
famous speakers as:
	∙	 Chris Anderson: editor of Wired and author of 
Technology’s Long Tail.
	∙	 Tim Berners-Lee: inventor of the World Wide Web.
	∙	 Jeff Bezos: founder of Amazon.com.
	∙	 Richard Branson: founder of Virgin.
	∙	 Bill Clinton: former President of the United States.
	∙	 Peter Diamandis: runs the X Prize Foundation.
	∙	 Sergey Brin and Larry Page: co-founders of Google.
	∙	 Malcolm Gladwell: author of Blink and The Tipping 
Point.
	∙	 Bill Gates: founder of Microsoft.
	∙	 Seth Godin: marketing guru.

management, defines and develops the project plan, and 
tracks the plan to ensure the project is completed on time and 
on budget. The project manager is the person responsible for 
­executing the entire project and defining the project scope that 
links the project to the organization’s overall business goals. 
The project scope describes the business need (the ­problem 
the project will solve) and the justification, requirements, and 
current boundaries for the project. The project plan is a for­
mal, approved document that manages and ­controls the entire 
project.
Phase 2: Analysis
In the analysis phase the firm analyzes its end-user business 
requirements and refines project goals into defined functions and 
operations of the intended system. Business ­requirements 
are the specific business requests the system must meet to be 
successful, so the analysis phase is critical because business 
requirements drive the entire systems development effort. A 
sample business requirement might state, “The CRM system 
must track all customer inquiries by product, region, and sales 
representative.” The business requirement will state what the 
system must accomplish to be considered successful. If a sys­
tem does not meet the business requirements, it will be deemed 
a failed project. For this reason, the organization must spend as 
much time, energy, and resources as necessary to gather accu­
rate and detailed business requirements. (Figure 9.2 displays 
ways to gather business requirements.)
Requirements management is the process of managing 
changes to the business requirements throughout the project. 
Projects are typically dynamic in nature, and change should 
be expected and anticipated for successful project comple­
tion. A requirements definition document prioritizes all 
of the business requirements by order of importance to the 
company. Sign-off is the users’ actual signatures indicating 
they approve all of the business requirements.
the best logistical structure for 
warehouses around the world, or

alliance with another organization. 
Organizations must carefully plan 
the activities (and determine why 
they are necessary) to be success­
ful. A change agent is a person 
or event that is the catalyst for 
implementing major changes for a 
system to meet business changes. 
Brainstorming is a technique 
for generating ideas by encourag­
ing participants to offer as many 
ideas as possible in a short period 
without any analysis until all the 
ideas have been exhausted. Many 
times, new business opportunities 
are found as the result of a brain­
storming session.
The Project Management Insti­
tute (PMI) develops procedures 
and concepts necessary to support 
the profession of ­project man­
agement (www.pmi.org). PMI 
defines a project as a ­temporary 
activity a company undertakes to 
create a unique product, service, 
or result. Project management 
is the application of knowledge,

project activities to meet project 
requirements. A project man­

Phase 3: Design
The design phase establishes 
descriptions of the desired fea­
tures and operations of the system, 
including screen layouts, business 
rules, process diagrams, pseudo 
code, and other documentation. 
During the analysis phase, end 
users and MIS specialists work 
together to gather the detailed busi­
ness requirements for the proposed 
project from a logical point of 
view. That is, during analysis, busi­
ness requirements are documented 
without 
respect 
to 
technology or the tech­
nical 
infrastructure 
that will support the 
system. Moving into 
the design phase turns 
the project focus to the 
physical or technical 
point of view, defining 
the technical architec­
ture that will support 
the system, including 
data models, screen 
designs, report layouts, 
and database models 
(see Figure 9.4).
The graphical user 
interface (GUI) is the 
interface to an infor­
mation system. GUI 
screen design is the 
ability to model the information system screens for 
an entire system by using icons, buttons, menus, 
and submenus. Data models represent a formal 
way to express data relationships to a database 
Once a business analyst takes a detailed look at how an orga­
nization performs its work and its processes, the analyst can 
recommend ways to improve these processes to make them 
more efficient and effective. Process modeling involves 
graphically representing the processes that capture, manipu­
late, store, and distribute information between a system and its 
environment. One of the most common diagrams used in pro­
cess modeling is the data flow diagram. A data flow diagram 
(DFD) illustrates the movement of information between exter­
nal entities and the processes and data stores within the sys­
tem (see Figure 9.3). Process models and data flow diagrams 
establish the specifications of the system. ­Computer-aided 
software engineering (CASE) tools are software suites that 
automate systems analysis, design, and development. Process

Phase 4: 
Development
The development phase takes 
all the detailed design documents 
from the design phase and trans­
forms them into the actual system. 
In this phase, the project transi­
tions from preliminary designs to 
actual physical implementation. 
During development, the com­
pany purchases and implements 
the equipment necessary to sup­
port the architecture. Software 
engineering is a disciplined 
approach for constructing infor­
mation systems through the use 
of common methods, techniques, 
or tools. Software engineers use computer-aided software 
engineering (CASE) tools, which provide automated support 
for the development of the system. Control objects for infor­
mation and related technology­ (COBIT) is a set of best 
practices that helps an organization to maximize the benefits 
of an information system, while at the same time establishing 
appropriate controls to ensure minimum errors.
During development, the team defines the programming lan­
guage it will use to build the system. A scripting language is 
a programming method that provides for interactive modules 
to a website. Object-oriented languages group data and 
corresponding processes into objects. Fourth-­generation 
­languages (4GL) are programming languages that look 
­similar to human languages. For example, a typical 4GL 
­command might state, “FIND ALL RECORDS WHERE 
NAME IS “SMITH”.” Programming languages are displayed in 
Figure 9.6.
Phase 5: Testing
The testing phase brings all the project pieces together into 
a special testing environment to eliminate errors and bugs and 
verify that the system meets all the business requirements

Flawed Development
Data must be secure! A computer pro­
gramming course would teach you 
that security is a critical component 
that must be included in every sys­
tem. Apparently, the employees 
that developed the new system for 
the state of Oklahoma were out 
sick during this important class. 
The new system mistakenly 
posted confidential data, including Social Secu­
rity numbers, for thousands of Oklahoma residents on the state’s 
website. The really unfortunate part of this systems blunder is that 
the error went unnoticed for more than three years. A programmer 
found the error when he realized that by changing his web browser 
he could redirect his page to the entire database for the state of 
Oklahoma. To make matters even worse, due to development issues, 
a hacker could have easily changed all the data in the database or 
added false data to elements such as the state’s Sexual and Violent 
Offender Registry.
Why is it important to secure data? What can happen if someone 
accesses your customer database? What could happen if someone 
changes the information in your customer database and adds fictitious 
data? What phases in the systems development life cycle should have 
found these errors? How could these errors go unnoticed for over three 
years? Who should be held responsible for the system issues?

defined in the analysis phase. Bugs are defects in the code 
of an information system. Test conditions detail the steps 
the system must perform along with the expected result of 
each step (see Figure 9.7). Testers execute test conditions and 
compare the expected results with the actual results to verify 
the system functions correctly. Each time the actual result is 
different from the expected result, a “bug” is generated and 
the system must be fixed in development. A typical systems 
development effort has hundreds or thousands of test condi­
tions that must be verified against the business requirements to 
ensure the system is operating as expected. Figure 9.8 displays 
the different types of tests typically included in a systems 
development effort.
Phase 6: Implementation
In the implementation phase, the organization places the 
system into production so users can begin to perform actual 
business operations with it. In this phase, the detailed user 
documentation is created that highlights how to use the sys­
tem and how to troubleshoot issues or problems. Training is 
also provided for the system users and can take place online or 
in a classroom. Online training runs over the Internet or on a 
CD or DVD, and employees complete the training on their own 
time at their own pace. Workshop training is held in a class­
room environment and led by an instructor. One of the best 
ways to support users is to create a help desk or a group of 
people who respond to users’ questions. Figure 9.9 displays the 

Reducing 
Ambiguity 
in Business 
Requirements
The number one reason projects fail is because 
of bad business requirements. Business require­
ments are considered “bad” because of ambi­
guity or insufficient involvement of end users 
during analysis and design. A requirement is 
unambiguous if it has the same interpretation 
for all parties. Different interpretations 
by different participants will usually 
result in unmet expectations. Here is an 
example of an ambiguous requirement 
and an example of an unambiguous 
requirement:
	∙	 Ambiguous requirement: The finan­
cial report must show profits in local 
and U.S. currencies.
	∙	 Unambiguous requirement: The 
financial report must show profits in 
local and U.S. currencies using the 
exchange rate printed in The Wall 
Street Journal for the last business 
day of the period being reported.
Ambiguity is impossible to prevent 
comp­let­ely because it is introduced 
into requirements in natural ways. For 
example:
	∙	 Requirements can contain technical implica­
tions that are obvious to the IT developers 
but not to the customers.
	∙	 Requirements can contain business implica­
tions that are obvious to the customer but 
not to the IT developers.
	∙	 Requirements may contain everyday words 
whose meanings are “obvious” to everyone, 
yet different for everyone.
	∙	 Requirements are reflections of detailed 
explanations that may have included 
multiple events, multiple perspectives, 
verbal 
rephrasing, 
emotion, 
iterative 
refinement, selective emphasis, and body 
language—none of which are captured in 
the written statements.
You have been hired to build an employee 
payroll system for a new coffee shop. Review 
the following business requirements, and high­
light any potential issues.
	∙	 All employees must have a unique employee 
ID.
	 ∙	The system must track employee 
hours worked based on the employ­
ee’s last name.
∙	 Employees must be scheduled to 
work a minimum of eight hours per 
day.
∙	 Employee payroll is calculated by 
multiplying the employee’s hours 
worked by $7.25.
∙	 Managers must be scheduled to work 
morning shifts.
∙	 Employees cannot be scheduled 
to work more than eight hours per 
day.
∙	 Servers cannot be scheduled to 
work morning, afternoon, or evening 
shifts.
∙	 The system must allow managers to 
change and delete employees from 
the system.

different implementation methods an organization can choose 
to ensure success.
Phase 7: Maintenance
Maintaining the system is the final sequential phase of any 
systems development effort. In the maintenance phase, 
the organization performs changes, corrections, additions, 
and upgrades to ensure the system continues to meet business 
goals. This phase continues for the life of the system because 
the system must change as the business evolves and its needs 
change, which means conducting constant monitoring, sup­
porting the new system with frequent minor changes (for 

Report
Examples
Internal report
Presents data that are distributed inside the organization and intended for employees within an organization. 
Internal reports typically support day-to-day operations monitoring that supports managerial decision making.
Detailed internal report
Presents information with little or no filtering or restrictions of the data.
Summary internal report
Organizes and categorizes data for managerial perusal. A report that summarizes total sales by product 
for each month is an example of a summary internal report. The data for a summary report are typically 
categorized and summarized to indicate trends and potential problems.
Exception reporting
Highlights situations occurring outside of the normal operating range for a condition or standard. These 
internal reports include only exceptions and might highlight accounts that are unpaid or delinquent or identify 
items that are low in stock.
Information system control report
Ensures the reliability of information, consisting of policies and their physical implementation, access 
restrictions, or record keeping of actions and transactions.
Information systems audit report
Assesses a company’s information system to determine necessary changes and to help ensure the information 
systems’ availability, confidentiality, and integrity.
Post-implementation report
Presents a formal report or audit of a project after it is up and running.

coding standards, code libraries, development practices, and 
much more.
The oldest and the best known is the waterfall methodology, 
a sequence of phases in which the output of each phase becomes 
the input for the next (see Figure 9.11). In the SDLC, this means 
the steps are performed one at a time, in order, from planning 
through implementation and maintenance. The traditional water­
fall method no longer serves most of today’s development 
efforts, however; it is inflexible and expensive, and it requires 
rigid adherence to the sequence of steps. Its success rate is only 
about 1 in 10. Figure 9.12 explains some issues related to the 
waterfall methodology.
Today’s business environment is fierce. The desire and 
need to outsmart and outplay competitors desire and 
need remain intense. Given this drive for success, leaders push 
internal development teams and external vendors to deliver 
agreed-upon systems faster and cheaper so they can realize 
benefits as early as possible. Even so, systems remain large 
and complex. The traditional waterfall methodology no longer 
serves as an adequate systems development methodology in 
most cases. Because this development environment is the norm 
and not the exception anymore, development teams use a new 
breed of alternative development methods to achieve their busi­
ness objectives.
Prototyping is a modern design approach where the design­
ers and system users use an iterative approach to building the 
example, new reports or information capturing), and review­
ing the system to be sure it is moving the organization toward 
its strategic goals. Corrective maintenance makes system 
changes to repair design flaws, coding errors, or implementa­
tion issues. Preventive maintenance makes system changes 
to reduce the chance of future system failure. During the 
maintenance phase, the system will generate reports to help 
users and MIS specialists ensure it is functioning correctly 
(see Figure 9.10).
SOFTWARE 
DEVELOPMENT 
METHODOLOGIES  LO9.2
Today, systems are so large and complex that teams of archi­
tects, analysts, developers, testers, and users must work 
together to create the millions of lines of custom-written code 
that drive enterprises. For this reason, developers have cre­
ated a number of different systems development life cycle 
methodologies. A methodology is a set of policies, proce­
dures, standards, processes, practices, tools, techniques, and 
tasks that people apply to technical and management chal­
lenges. Firms use a methodology to manage the deployment 
of technology with work plans, requirements documents, and 
test plans, for instance. A formal methodology can include 

Planning for the Unexpected
Unexpected situations happen all the time, and the more you plan 
for them the better prepared you’ll be when developing software. 
Your employees will get into accidents, contract viruses and dis­
eases, and experience other life issues. All of these scenarios 
lead to unplanned absenteeism, which can throw your project 
plan into a tailspin. What can happen to a project when a key 
employee suddenly quits or is forced to go on short-term dis­
ability? When reviewing all the different SDLC methodolo­
gies, which one offers the greatest flexibility for unplanned 
employee downtime? If you could choose when your

user and business requirements. The advantages of prototyping 
include:
	∙	 Prototyping encourages user participation.
	∙	 Prototypes evolve through iteration, which better supports 
change.
	∙	 Prototypes have a physical quality allowing users to see, 
touch, and experience the system as it is developed.
	∙	 Prototypes tend to detect errors earlier.
	∙	 Prototyping accelerates the phases of the SDLC, helping to 
ensure success.
Agile Software Development 
Methodologies
It is common knowledge that the smaller the project, 
the greater the success rate. The iterative develop­
ment style is the ultimate in small projects. Basi­
cally, iterative development consists of a series 
of tiny projects. It has become the foundation of 
multiple agile methodologies. Figure 9.13 displays 
an iterative approach.
An agile methodology aims for customer sat­
isfaction through early and continuous delivery 
of useful software components developed by an 
iterative process using the bare minimum require­
ments. Agile methodology is what it sounds like: fast and 
efficient, with lower costs and fewer features. Using agile 
methods helps refine feasibility and supports the process for 
getting rapid feedback as functionality is introduced. Devel­
opers can adjust as they move along and better clarify unclear 
requirements.

Issues Related to the Waterfall Methodology
The business problem
Any flaws in accurately defining and articulating the business problem in terms of what the business users actually 
require flow onward to the next phase.
The plan
Managing costs, resources, and time constraints is difficult in the waterfall sequence. What happens to the schedule 
if a programmer quits? How will a schedule delay in a specific phase impact the total cost of the project? Unexpected 
contingencies may sabotage the plan.
The solution
The waterfall methodology is problematic in that it assumes users can specify all business requirements in 
advance. Defining the appropriate IT infrastructure that is flexible, scalable, and reliable is a challenge. The final 
IT infrastructure solution must meet not only current but also future needs in terms of time, cost, feasibility, and 
flexibility. Vision is inevitably limited at the head of the waterfall.

CHAPTER 9  |  Systems Development and Project Management: Corporate Responsibility  261
One key to delivering a successful product or system is to 
deliver value to users as soon as possible—give them some­
thing they want and like early to create buy-in, generate 
enthusiasm, and, ultimately, reduce scope. Using agile meth­
odologies helps maintain accountability and helps to establish 
a barometer for the satisfaction of end users. It does no good 
to accomplish something on time and on budget if it does not 
satisfy the end user. The primary forms of agile methodologies 
include:
	∙	 Rapid 
prototyping 
or 
rapid

methodology.
	∙	 Extreme programming methodology.
	∙	 Rational unified process (RUP) methodology.
	∙	 Scrum methodology.
It is important not to get hung up on the names of the 
­methodologies—some are proprietary brand names; others are 
generally accepted names. It is 
more important to know how these 
alternative methodologies are used 
in today’s business environment 
and the benefits they can deliver.

 Faking Your Own Death5
F
acing insurmountable troubles, some 
people turn to faking their own death to 
escape legal issues and even the Marines. 
Here are a few examples:
	∙	 Marcus Schrenker, a Wall Street investor 
whose company was under investigation 
for fraud, disappeared while flying his plane 
over Alabama. Schrenker’s plane was found 
in a swamp, and the last anyone heard from 
Schrenker was a distressed radio call—until 
he was discovered in a campground a few 
weeks later.
	∙	 A Colorado man returning from a hike 
reported that his friend, Lance Hering, had 
been injured on the hike, and rescue teams 
were dispatched to find the hiker. All the 
rescuers found was blood, a water bottle, 
and Hering’s shoes. Two years later, Hering 
was arrested with his father at an airport in 
Washington state. Hering, a Marine, claimed 
he faked his death to avoid returning to Iraq, 
where he feared other soldiers would kill 
him because of something incriminating he 
had witnessed.
	∙	 One Florida woman, Alison Matera, informed 
her friends, family, and church choir that 
she was entering hospice because she was 
dying of cancer. Matera’s plan unraveled 
when she appeared at her own funeral 
service, claiming to be her own long-lost 
identical twin sister. Police were called, and 
Matera admitted faking both her 
cancer and death.
Unexpected situations happen 
all the time, and the more you plan 
for them the better prepared you’ll 
be when developing software. 
Hopefully, your employees are not 
faking their own deaths, but they 
will get into accidents, have babies, 
contract viruses and diseases, and 
face other life issues. All of these 
scenarios lead to unplanned absen­
teeism, which can throw your proj­
ect plan into a tailspin. What can 
happen to a project when a key 
employee suddenly quits or is forced 
to go on short-term disability? When 
reviewing all of the different SDLC 
methodologies, which one offers 
the greatest flexibility for unplanned 
employee downtime? If you could 
choose when your employee was 
absent, during which phase in the 
SDLC would it be the safest if your 
project were to still continue and 
achieve success? What can you do to ensure 
you are preparing for unplanned absenteeism 
on your project plan?

results. XP has four basic phases: planning, designing, coding, 
and testing. Planning can include user interviews, meetings, and 
small releases. During­ design, functionality is not added until 
it is required or needed. During coding, the developers work 
together soliciting continuous feedback from users, eliminat­
ing the communication gap that generally exists between devel­
opers and customers. During testing, the test requirements are 
generated before any code is developed. Extreme programming 
saves time and produces successful projects by continuously 
reviewing and revamping needed and unneeded requirements.
Customer satisfaction is the primary reason XP finds success as 
developers quickly respond to changing business requirements, 
even late in the life cycle. XP encourages managers, custom­
ers, and developers to work together as a team to ensure the 
delivery of high-quality systems. 
XP is similar to a puzzle; there are

Rational Unified Process (RUP) 
Methodology
The rational unified process (RUP) methodology, owned 
by IBM, provides a framework for breaking down the devel­
opment of software into four “gates.” Each gate consists of 
executable iterations of the software in development. A proj­
ect stays in a gate waiting for the stakeholder’s analysis, and 
then it either moves to the next gate or is cancelled. The gates 
include:3
	∙	 Gate one: inception. This phase ensures all stakeholders 
have a shared understanding of the proposed system and 
what it will do.
	∙	 Gate two: elaboration. This phase expands on the agreed-
upon details of the system, including the ability to provide an 
architecture to support and build it.
	∙	 Gate three: construction. This phase includes building and 
developing the product.
	∙	 Gate four: transition. Primary questions answered in this 
phase address ownership of the system and training of key 
personnel.4
Because RUP is an iterative methodology, the user can reject 
the product and force the developers to go back to gate one. 
RUP helps developers avoid reinventing the wheel and focuses 
on rapidly adding or removing reusable chunks of processes 
addressing common problems.
Scrum Methodology
Another agile methodology, scrum methodology, uses small 
teams to produce small pieces of software using a series of 
“sprints,” or 30-day intervals, to achieve an appointed goal. In 
rugby, a scrum is a team pack and everyone in the pack works 
together to move the ball down the field. In scrum methodol­
ogy, each day ends or begins with a stand-up meeting to moni­
tor and control the development effort.

DEVELOPING A 
SERVICE-ORIENTED 
ARCHITECTURE  LO9.3
One of the latest trends in systems development is creating a 
service-oriented architecture. Service-oriented architecture 
(SOA) is a business-driven enterprise architecture that supports 
integrating a business as linked, repeatable activities, tasks, or 
services. SOA ensures that MIS systems can adapt quickly, 
easily, and economically to support rapidly changing busi­
ness needs. SOA promotes a scalable and flexible enterprise 
architecture that can implement new or reuse existing MIS 
components, creating connections 
among disparate applications and 
systems. It is important to under­
stand that SOA is not a concrete 
architecture; it is thought that 
leads to a concrete architecture. 
It might be described as a style, 
paradigm, concept, perspective, 
philosophy, 
or 
representation. 
That is, SOA is an approach, a 
way of thinking, a value system 
that leads to decisions that design 
a concrete architecture allowing 
enterprises to plug in new services 
or upgrade existing services in a 
granular approach. Figure 9.15 
discusses the problems that can be 
addressed by implementing SOA. 
Figure 9.16 displays the three key 
technical concepts of SOA.
Service
Service-oriented 
architecture 
begins with a service—an SOA 
service being simply a business 
task, such as checking a poten­
tial customer’s credit rating when 
opening a new account. It is 
important to stress that this is part 
of a business process. Services are 
like software products; however, when describing SOA, do 
not think about software or MIS. Think about what a company 
does on a day-to-day basis and break up those business pro­
cesses into repeatable business tasks or components.
SOA works with services that are not just software or hard­
ware but, rather, business tasks. It is a pattern for developing 
a more flexible kind of software application that can promote 
loose coupling among software components while reusing 
existing investments in technology in new, more valuable 
ways across the organization. SOA is based on standards 
that enable interoperability, business agility, and innova­
tion to generate more business value for those who use these 
principles.
SOA helps companies become more agile by aligning business 
needs and the IT capabilities that support these needs. Business 
drives requirements for IT; SOA enables the IT environment to 
respond to these requirements effectively and efficiently. SOA 
is about helping companies apply reusability and flexibility that 
can lower cost (of development, integration, and maintenance), 
increase revenue, and obtain sustainable competitive advantage 
through technology.
It is very important to note that SOA is an evolution. Although 
its results are revolutionary, it builds on many technologies 
used in the marketplace, such as web services, transactional

well-defined interfaces, and organizational commitments to 
reuse key services instead of reinventing the wheel. SOA is not 
just about technology, but about how technology and business 
link themselves for a common goal of business flexibility.
Interoperability
As defined earlier, interoperability is the 
capability of two or more computer systems 
to share data and resources, even though 
they are made by different manufacturers. 
Businesses today use a variety of systems 
that have resulted in diverse operating envi­
ronments. This diversity has inundated 
businesses with the lack of interoperability. 
With SOA, a business can create solutions 
that draw on functionality from these exist­
ing, previously isolated systems that are 
portable, interoperable, or both, regardless 
of the environment in which they exist.
A web service is an open-standards way 
of supporting interoperability. Web ser­
vices are application programming inter­
faces (API) that can be accessed over a 
network, such as the Internet, and executed 
on a remote system hosting the requested 
services. SOA is a style of architecture that 
enables the creation of applications that are 
built by combining loosely coupled and 
interoperable services. In SOA, since the 
basic unit of communication is a message 
rather than an operation, web services are 
usually loosely coupled. Although SOA can

components, and object-oriented design. The beauty of SOA is 
that these technologies exist together in SOA through standards, 

Scratch
Scratch is a visual programming language that is perfect for anyone 
learning to code. Scratch creates programs by connecting blocks of code 
by using a drag-and-drop GUI so users do not have to type programming 
languages. Users can simply select colored blocks of code that, when 
joined, create a script or a set of computer instructions that can make 
objects such as people and animals move and speak. Users can create 
interactive stories, games, and animations with the click of a button.
Scratch is a free project created by the Lifelong Kindergarten 
Group at the MIT Media Lab and currently has more than 8 million 
users. The goal of Scratch is to help young people learn to think 
creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively—
essential skills for life in the 21st century.

exist without web services, the best-practice implementation of 
SOA for flexibility always involves web services.
Technically, web services are based on Extensible Markup 
Language (XML), a markup language for documents, containing 
structured information. The technical specifics of XML’s capa­
bilities go beyond the scope of this book, but for our purposes, 
they support things such as ebusiness transactions, mathematical 
equations, and a thousand other kinds of structured data. XML is 
a common data representation that can be used as the medium of 
exchange between programs that are written in different program­
ming languages and execute different kinds of machine instruc­
tions. In simple terms, think about XML as the official translator 
for structured information. Structured information is both the 
content (word, picture, and so on) and the role it plays. XML is 
the basis for all web service technologies and the key to interoper­
ability; every web service specification is based on XML.
Loose Coupling
Part of the value of SOA is that it is built on the premise of 
loose coupling of services. Loose coupling is the capability 
of services to be joined on demand to create composite services 
or disassembled just as easily into their functional components. 
Loose coupling is a way of ensuring that the technical details 
such as language, platform, and so on are decoupled from the 
service. For example, look at currency conversion. Today all 
banks have multiple currency converters, all with different rate 
refreshes at different times. By creating a common service, 
conversion of currency, that is loosely coupled to all banking 
functions that require conversion, the rates, times, and sam­
plings can be averaged to ensure floating the treasury in the 
most effective manner possible. Another example is common 
customer identification. Most businesses lack a common cus­
tomer ID and, therefore, have no way to determine who the 
customers are and what they buy for what reason. Creating a 
common customer ID that is independent of applications and 
databases allows loosely coupling the service, customer ID, to 
data and applications without the application or database ever 
knowing who it is or where it is.
The difference between traditional, tightly bound interactions 
and loosely coupled services is that, before the transaction 
occurs, the functional pieces (services) operating within the 
SOA are dormant and disconnected. When the business 
process initiates, these services momentarily interact 
with each other. They do so for just long enough 
to execute their piece of the overall process, 
and then they go back to their dormant state, 
with no long-standing connection to the other 
services with which they just interacted.
The next time the same service is called, it could 
be as part of a different business process with 
different calling and destination services. A great 
way to understand this is through the analogy of 
the telephone system. At the dawn of widespread 
phone usage, operators had to plug in a wire 
physically to create a semi-perma­
nent connection between two par­
ties. Callers were “tightly bound” 
to each other. Today you pick up 
your cell phone and put it to your 
ear, and there’s no dial tone—it’s 
disconnected. You enter a number, 
push “Talk,” and only then does 
the process initiate, establishing 
a loosely coupled connection just 
long enough for your conversa­
tion. Then when the conversation 
is over, your cell phone goes back 
to dormant mode until a new con­
nection is made with another party. 
As a result, supporting a mil­
lion cell phone subscribers does 
not require the cell phone service 
provider to support a million live 
connections; it requires supporting 
only the number of simultaneous 
conversations at any given time. 
It allows for a much more flexible 
and dynamic exchange.

USING PROJECT 
MANAGEMENT TO 
DELIVER SUCCESSFUL 
PROJECTS  LO9.4
No one would think of building an office complex by turning loose 
100 different construction teams to build 100 different rooms 
with no single blueprint or agreed-upon vision of the completed 
structure. Yet this is precisely the situation in 
which many large organizations find them­
selves when managing information technology 
projects. Organizations routinely oversched­
ule their resources (human and otherwise), 
develop redundant projects, and damage prof­
itability by investing in nonstrategic efforts that do not contribute 
to the organization’s bottom line. Business leaders face a rapidly 
moving and unforgiving global marketplace that will force them 
to use every possible tool to sustain competitiveness; project man­
agement is one of those tools. For this reason, business personnel 
must anticipate being involved in some form of project manage­
ment during their career. Figure 9.17 displays a few examples of 
the different types of projects organizations encounter.
Tangible benefits are easy to quantify and typically measured 
to determine the success­ or failure of a project. ­Intangible 
­benefits are difficult to quantify or measure (see Figure 9.18 for 
examples). One of the most difficult decisions managers make 
is identifying the projects in which to invest time, energy, and 
resources. An organization must choose what it wants to do—
justifying it, defining it, and listing expected results—and how 
to do it, including project budget, schedule, and analysis of proj­
ect risks. Feasibility is the measure of the tangible and intan­
gible benefits of an information system. Figure 9.19 displays 
several types of feasibility studies business analysts can use to 
determine the projects that best fit business goals.
With today’s volatile economic environment, many businesses 
are being forced to do more with less. Businesses today must 
respond quickly to a rapidly changing business­ environment­ 
by continually innovating goods and services. Effective

project management­ provides a controlled way 
to respond to changing market conditions, to 
foster global communications, and to provide 
key metrics to enable managerial decision­ mak­
ing. Developing projects within budget and on 
time is challenging, and with the help of solid 
project management skills, managers can avoid 
the primary reasons projects­ fail, including:
∙	 Unclear or missing business requirements.
∙	 Skipped SDLC phases.
∙	 Changing technology.
∙	 The cost of finding errors.
∙	 Balance of the triple constraints.
LO9.3  Explain 
project 
management 
and 
identify the primary reasons projects fail.
Unclear or Missing 
Business Requirements
The most common reason systems fail is 
because the business requirements are either 
missing or incorrectly gathered during the 
analysis phase. The business requirements 
drive the entire system. If they are not accurate 
or complete, the system will not be successful.
Skipped Phases
The first thing individuals tend to do when a 
project falls behind schedule is to start skip­
ping phases in the SDLC. For example, if a 
project is three weeks behind in the develop­
ment phase, the project manager might decide

Sharepoint
Life is good when you can com­
plete all your projects by the due date 
and under budget. Life is not good 
when you miss your deadlines, exceed your 
budget, and fail to meet the business require­
ments. One tool that can help ensure that your 
life always stays good is Microsoft SharePoint. 
With SharePoint, you can connect with employ­
ees enterprisewide to collaborate, share ideas, 
and reinvent the way work flows. Whether 
working as a team or an individual, SharePoint 
helps you organize information, people, and 
projects. SharePoint can make any manager’s 
life easier by organizing teamwork around com­
mon milestones. You can make sure that work 
is completed by assigning people tasks that can 
be tracked and prioritized. You can keep an eye 
on important details with real-time summaries 
of your projects that warns you about delays 
and keeps next steps and milestones on your 
radar. Explain why using a project management/
collaboration tool such as SharePoint can help 
ensure that you never fail as a manager. Be sure 
to explain any project management terms such 
as deliverables, dependencies, and milestones.

to cut testing from six weeks to three 
weeks. Obviously, it is impossible 
to perform all the testing in half the 
time. Failing to test the system will 
lead to unfound errors, and chances 
are high that the system will fail. It is 
critical that an organization perform 
all phases in the SDLC during every 
project. Skipping any of the phases is 
sure to lead to system failure.
Changing Technology
Many real-world projects have hun­
dreds of business requirements, take 
years to complete, and cost millions 
of dollars. As Moore’s Law states, 
technology changes at an incredibly 
fast pace; therefore, it is possible that 
an entire project plan will need to be 
revised in the middle of a project as 
a result of a change in technology. Technology changes so fast 
that it is almost impossible to deliver an information system 
without feeling the pain of updates.
The Cost of Finding Errors in the SDLC
It is important to discuss the relationship between the SDLC 
and the cost for the organization to fix errors. An error found 
during the analysis and design phase is relatively inexpensive 
to fix. All that is typically required is a change to a Word docu­
ment. However, exactly the same error found during the test­
ing or implementation phase is going to cost the organization 
an enormous amount to fix because it has to change the actual 
system. Figure 9.20 displays how the cost to fix an error grows 
exponentially the later the error is found in the SDLC.
Balance of the Triple Constraint
Figure 9.21 displays the relationships among the three primary 
and interdependent variables in any project—time, cost, and 
scope. All projects are limited in some way by these three con­
straints. The Project Management Institute calls the framework 
for evaluating these competing demands the triple constraint.

FIGURE 9. 2 2   PMBOK Elements of Project Management
Tool
Description
Communication plan
Defines the how, what, when, and who regarding the flow of project information to stakeholders and is key for 
managing expectations.
Executive sponsor
The person or group who provides the financial resources for the project.
Project assumption
Factors considered to be true, real, or certain without proof or demonstration. Examples include hours in a 
workweek or time of year the work will be performed.
Project constraint
Specific factors that can limit options, including budget, delivery dates, available skilled resources, and 
organizational policies.
Project deliverable
Any measurable, tangible, verifiable outcome, result, or item that is produced to complete a project or part of a 
project. Examples of project deliverables include design documents, testing scripts, and requirements documents.
Project management office (PMO)
An internal department that oversees all organizational projects. This group must formalize and professionalize 
project management expertise and leadership. One of the primary initiatives of the PMO is to educate the 
organization on techniques and procedures necessary to run successful projects.
Project milestone
Represents key dates when a certain group of activities must be performed. For example, completing the planning 
phase might be a project milestone. If a project milestone is missed, then chances are the project is experiencing 
problems.
Project objectives
Quantifiable criteria that must be met for the project to be considered a success.
Project requirements document
Defines the specifications for product/output of the project and is key for managing expectations, controlling 
scope, and completing other planning efforts.
Project scope statement
Links the project to the organization’s overall business goals. It describes the business need (the problem the 
project will solve) and the justification, requirements, and current boundaries for the project. It defines the work 
that must be completed to deliver the product with the specified features and functions, and it includes constraints, 
assumptions, and requirements—all components necessary for developing accurate cost estimates.
Project stakeholder
Individuals and organizations actively involved in the project or whose interests might be affected as a result of 
project execution or project completion.
Responsibility matrix
Defines all project roles and indicates what responsibilities are associated with each role.
Status report
Periodic reviews of actual performance versus expected performance.
CHAPTER 9  |  Systems Development and Project Management: Corporate Responsibility  269
The relationship among these variables is such that if any one 
changes, at least one other is likely to be affected. For example, 
moving up a project’s finish date could mean either increas­
ing costs to hire more staff or decreasing the scope to eliminate 
features or functions. Increasing a project’s scope to include 
additional customer requests could extend the project’s time to 
completion or increase the project’s cost—or both—to accom­
modate the changes. Project quality is affected by the project 
manager’s ability to balance these competing demands. High-
quality projects deliver the agreed upon product or service on 
time and on budget. Project management is the science of making 
intelligent trade-offs between time, cost, and scope. Benjamin 
Franklin’s timeless advice—by failing to prepare, you prepare to 
fail—applies to many of today’s software development projects.
The Project Management Institute created the Project Manage­
ment Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) for the education and cer­
tification of project managers. Figure 9.22 summarizes the key 
elements of project planning according to PMBOK.

PLANNING 
DIAGRAMS  LO9.5
Project planning is the process of detailed planning that gener­
ates answers to common operational questions such as why are 
we doing this project or what is the project going to accomplish 
for the business? Some of the key questions project planning 
can help answer include:
	∙	 How are deliverables being produced?
	∙	 What activities or tasks need to be accomplished to produce 
the deliverables?
	∙	 Who is responsible for performing the tasks?
	∙	 What resources are required to perform the tasks?
∙	 When will the tasks be performed?
∙	 How long will it take to perform each task?
∙	 Are any tasks dependent upon other tasks being completed 
before they can begin?
∙	 How much does each task cost?

The project objectives are among 
the most important areas to define 
because they are essentially the 
major elements of the project. When 
an organization achieves the proj­
ect objectives, it has accomplished 
the major goals of the project and 
the project scope is satisfied. Proj­
ect objectives must include metrics 
so that the project’s success can be 
measured. The metrics can include 
cost, schedule, and quality met­
rics. Figure 9.23  lists the SMART 
­criteria—useful reminders about 
how to ensure the project has cre­
ated understandable and measurable 
objectives.
The project plan is a formal, 
approved document that manages 
and controls project execution. 
The project plan should include a 
description of the project scope, a list of activities, a schedule, 
time estimates, cost estimates, risk factors, resources, assign­
ments, and responsibilities. In addition to these basic components, 
most project professionals also include contingency plans, review 
and communications strategies, and a kill switch—a trigger that 
enables a project manager to close the project before completion.
A good project plan should include estimates for revenue and stra­
tegic necessities. It also should include measurement and report­
ing methods and details as to how top leadership will engage in 
the project. It also informs stakeholders of the benefits of the 
project and justifies the investment, commitment, and risk of the 
project as it relates to the overall mission of the organization.
Managers need to continuously monitor projects to measure 
their success. If a project is failing, the manager must cancel 
the project and save the company any further project costs. 
Canceling a project is not necessarily a failure as much as it is 
successful resource management as it frees resources that can 
be used on other projects that are more valuable to the firm.
The most important part of the plan is communication. The 
project manager must communicate the plan to every member 
of the project team and to any key stakeholders and executives. 
The project plan must also include any project assumptions and 
be detailed enough to guide the execution of the project. A key 
to achieving project success is earning consensus and buy-in 
from all key stakeholders. By including key stakeholders in 
project plan development, the project manager allows them 
to have ownership of the plan. This often translates to greater 
commitment, which in turn results in enhanced motivation and 
productivity. The two primary diagrams most frequently used 
in project planning are PERT and Gantt charts.
A PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) 
chart is a graphical network model that depicts a project’s tasks 
and the relationships between them. A dependency is a logi­
cal relationship that exists between the project tasks, or between 
a project task and a milestone. PERT charts define dependency 
between project tasks before those tasks are scheduled (see 
Figure 9.24). The boxes in Figure 9.24 represent project tasks, 
and the project manager can adjust the contents of the boxes to 
display various project­ attributes such as schedule and actual 
start and finish times. The arrows indicate that a task depends 
on the start or the completion of a different task. The critical 
path estimates the shortest path through the project ensuring all 
critical tasks are completed from start to finish. The red line in 
Figure 9.24 displays the critical path for the project.
A Gantt chart is a simple bar chart that lists project tasks vertically 
against the project’s time frame, listed horizontally. A Gantt chart 
works well for representing the project schedule. It also shows 
actual progress of tasks against the planned duration. Figure 9.25
displays a software development project using a Gantt chart.

Honestly, It Cost $7,500 for 
a Steak Dinner7
The next time one of your employees 
submits an expense report, you might 
want to think twice: there are a num­
ber of websites offering all kinds of 
phony documentation that indi­
viduals can use to help cheat on 
their taxes, expense reports, or 
even spouses. Here are a few 
you should be aware of:
∙	 Customreceipts.com: This site prints fake ATM receipts for 
those individuals who want to casually let other people see their 
massive bank balance.
	∙	 Alibi Network: Creates custom tailored excuses, such as a call claim­
ing to be an “emergency” so that the employee can leave that boring 
meeting or dreadful company picnic. The site will even write and send 
false invitations for business events or telephone an unfaithful part­
ner “confirming” that their beloved will be caught up in a meeting.
	∙	 CorruptedFiles.com: Sells corrupted files guaranteed not to open on 
a Mac or PC, allowing employees to miss that deadline.
	∙	 Restaurant Maloney & Porcelli’s: This innovative, yet perhaps 
unethical, restaurant started the “expense a steak” tool that works 
by entering the bill for the dinner and automatically creates a fake, 
work-related receipt ranging from cab rides to office supply stores. 
For example, enter a meal costing $149.37 and the program gen­
erates a $135.73 receipt from the “Office Supply Hut” and a $13.64 
receipt from “The Panini Experience.”
Does the existence of services like these affect how you will run your 
business? What would you do to an employee who was using one of 
these services? What would happen to a company’s budget if it believed 
the fraudulent expenses were required to be paid by the business? How 
can a company fight back against these types of fraudulent activities 
without wasting enormous amounts of time and energy?

nonprofit organizations to build custom web 
solutions. CharityFocus is completely run by vol­
unteers, and the services of its volunteers are 
absolutely free. The nonprofit believes that it is 
impossible to create a better world without inner 
change resulting from selfless service. In the 
spirit of selfless service, volunteers created the 
following on the website to inspire and cultivate 
change:
	∙	 DailyGood: Email service that delivers a lit­
tle bit of good news to thousands of people 
all over the world.
	∙	 KarmaTube: Site that uses the power of 
video to document multiple acts of compas­
sion, generosity, and selflessness.
	∙	 Conversations: Site (Conversations.org) that 
hosts in-depth interviews of everyday heroes 
and a broad spectrum of artists.
	∙	 HelpOthers: A kindness portal based on 
the smile, a universally recognized symbol. 
People smile because they are happy and 
people smile because they want to become 
happy. The purpose of HelpOthers.org is 
to bring more of those smiles in the world 
through small acts of kindness.

OUTSOURCING 
PROJECTS  LO9.6
In the high-speed global business environment, an organization 
needs to increase profits, grow market share, and reduce costs. 
Two basic options are available to organizations wishing to 
develop and maintain their information systems—in-sourcing 
or outsourcing.
In-sourcing (in-house development) uses the professional 
expertise within an organization to develop and maintain its 
information technology systems. In-sourcing has been instru­
mental in creating a viable supply of IT professionals and in 
creating a better quality workforce combining both technical 
and business skills.
Outsourcing is an arrangement by which one organization 
provides a service or services for another organization that 
chooses not to perform them in-house. In some cases, the entire 
MIS department is outsourced, including planning and business 
analysis as well as the design, development, and maintenance 
of equipment and projects. Outsourcing can range from a large 
contract under which an organization such as IBM manages all

MIS services for another company, to hiring contractors and 
temporary staff on an individual basis. Common reasons com­
panies outsource include:
	∙	 Core competencies. Many companies have recently begun to 
consider outsourcing as a way to acquire best-practices and 
the business process expertise of highly skilled technology 
resources for a low cost. Technology is advancing at such 
an accelerated rate that companies often lack the technical 
resources required to keep current.
	∙	 Financial savings. It is far cheaper to hire people in China and 
India than pay the required salaries for similar labor in the 
United States.
	∙	 Rapid growth. Firms must get their products to market quickly 
and still be able to react to market changes. By taking advan­
tage of outsourcing, an organization can acquire the resources 
required to speed up operations or scale to new demand levels.
	∙	 The Internet and globalization. The pervasive nature of the 
Internet has made more people comfortable with outsourcing 
abroad as India, China, and the United States become virtual 
neighbors.
Outsourcing MIS enables organizations to keep up with market 
and technology advances—with less strain on human and finan­
cial resources and more assurance that the IT infrastructure will 
keep pace with evolving business priorities (see Figure 9.26). The 
three forms of outsourcing options available for a project are:
	1.	 Onshore outsourcing—engaging another company within 
the same country for services.
	2.	 Nearshore 
outsourcing—contracting 
an 
outsourcing 
arrangement with a company in a nearby country. Often this 
country will share a border with the native country.
	3.	 Offshore outsourcing—using organizations from develop­
ing countries to write code and develop systems. In offshore 
outsourcing the country is geographically far away.
Since the mid-1990s, major U.S. companies have been send­
ing significant portions­ of their software development work 
offshore—primarily to vendors in India, but also to vendors in 
China, eastern Europe (including Russia), Ireland, Israel, and 
the Philippines.­ The big ­selling 
point for offshore outsourcing 
is inexpensive but good work. 
The overseas­ counterpart to an 
­American programmer who earns 
as much as $63,000 per year is paid 
as little as $5,000 per year (see 
Figure 9.27). Developing coun­
tries in Asia and South Africa offer 
some outsourcing services but are 
challenged by language difference, 
inadequate­ 
telecommunication­ 
equip­ment,­ and regulatory obsta­
cles. India is the largest offshore 
marketplace­ because it promotes 
English along with a technologi­
cally advanced population.­ Info­
sys, NIIT, Mahindra­ Satyam, Tata 
Consultancy Services, and Wipro 
are among the biggest Indian out­
sourcing service providers, each of 
which has a large presence in the 
United States.8
LO9.6  Identify the three different 
types of outsourcing along with 
their benefits and challenges.

Benefits
The many benefits associated with 
outsourcing include:
	∙	 Increased quality and efficiency 
of business processes.
	∙	 Reduced operating expenses 
for head count and exposure to 
risk for large capital investments.

Due Diligence //: 
DUI in a Golf Cart9
Swedish police stopped Bill Murray and charged him with drunk driving 
when he attempted to drive his golf cart from Café Opera, an upscale 
restaurant in the center of town, back to his hotel. A golf cart only goes 
about three miles per hour, and it seems odd that you can be issued a 
DUI for driving one. However, different countries have different laws. A 
few other cultural blunders you want to avoid include:
	∙	 Several managers of an American company realized the brand name 
of the cooking oil they were marketing in a Latin American country 
translated into Spanish as “Jackass Oil.”
	∙	 American Motors was excited to market its new car, the Matador, 
which was based on the image of courage and strength. However, 
in Puerto Rico the name Matador equates to “killer,” and consum­
ers were not willing to drive a Killer car on the country’s hazardous 
roads.
	∙	 A new cologne advertisement pictured an idyllic scene with a man 
and his dog. It failed in Islamic countries because dogs are consid­
ered unclean.
	∙	 One popular Procter & Gamble European soap commercial featured 
a woman bathing and her husband entering the bathroom and smil­
ing. P&G decided that the commercial did so well they would air it in 
Japan. The problem? The Japanese considered this ad an invasion of 
privacy, inappropriate behavior, and in very poor taste.
	∙	 One American refused to accept an offer of a cup of coffee from a 
Saudi businessman. Such a rejection is considered very rude, and the 
entire deal was ended.
	∙	 A golf ball manufacturing company packaged golf balls in packs of 
four for convenient purchase in Japan. Unfortunately, pronunciation 
of the word “four” in Japanese sounds like the word “death,” and 
items packaged in fours are unpopular.
Companies that are expanding globally are looking for opportuni­
ties, not problems. Yet local laws and procedures that come into play 
when setting up shop abroad—everything from hiring and firing to 
tax filings—can be a minefield. What types of culture, language, and 
legal issues should a company expect to encounter when dealing 
with an outsourcing company? What can a company do to mitigate 
these risks?

	∙	 Access to outsourcing service provider’s expertise, econo­
mies of scale, best practices, and advanced technologies.
	∙	 Increased flexibility for faster response to market changes 
and less time to market for new products or services.
Outsourcing Challenges
Outsourcing comes with several challenges. These arguments 
are valid and should be considered when a company is think­
ing about outsourcing. Many challenges can be avoided with 
proper research. The challenges include:
	∙	 Length of contract. Most companies look at outsourcing as a 
long-term solution with a time period of several years. Train­
ing and transferring resources around the globe is difficult 
and expensive, hence most companies pursuing offshore 
outsourcing contract for multiple years of service. A few of 
the challenges facing the length of the contract include:
	  1.	 It can be difficult to break the contract.
	2.	 Forecasting business needs for the next several years is 
challenging and the contract might not meet future business 
needs.
	3.	 Re-creating an internal MIS department if the outsource pro­
vider fails is costly and challenging.
	∙	 Threat to competitive advantage. Many businesses view MIS 
as a competitive advantage and view outsourcing as a threat 
because the outsourcer could share the company’s trade 
secrets.
	∙	 Loss of confidentiality. Information on pricing, products, sales, 
and customers can be a competitive asset and often critical 
for business success. Outsourcing could place confiden­
tial information in the wrong hands. Although confidentiality 
clauses contained in the contracts are supposed to protect 
the company, the potential risk and costs of a breach must be 
analyzed.
Every type of organization in business today relies on soft­
ware to operate and solve complex problems or create excit­
ing opportunities. Software built correctly can support nimble 
organizations and transform with them as they and their busi­
nesses transform. Software that effectively meets employee 
needs will help an organization become more productive 
and enhance decision making. Software that does not meet 
employee needs might have a damaging effect on productivity 
and can even cause a business to fail. Employee involvement in 
software development, along with the right implementation, is 
critical to the success of an organization.

Death March
Edward Yourdon’s book Death March describes the complete soft­
ware developer’s guide to surviving “mission 
impossible” projects. MIS projects are chal­
lenging, and project managers are expected 
to achieve the impossible by pulling off a suc­
cessful project even when pitted against 
impossible challenges. In Death March, 
infamous software developer Edward 
Yourdon presents his project classification 
displayed here. Yourdon measures projects 
based on the level of pain and chances for 
success.
∙  Mission Impossible Project: This project has a great chance of 
success and your hard work will pay off as you find happiness and 
joy in the work. For example, this is the type of project where you 
work all day and night for a year and become the project hero as 
you complete the mission impossible and reap a giant promotion as 
your reward.
Kamikaze
Suicide
Ugly
Chance of Success
Mission
Impossible
Level of Happiness
	∙	 Ugly Project: This project has a high chance of success but is 
very painful and offers little happiness. For example, you work 
day and night to install a new accounting system and although 
successful, you hate accounting and dislike the company and its 
products.
	∙	 Kamikaze Project: This is a project that has little chance of 
success but you are so passionate about the content that you 
find great happiness working on the project. For example, you 
are asked to build a website to support a cancer foundation, 
a cause near to your heart, but the company is nonprofit and 
doesn’t have any funds to help buy the software you need to 
get everything working. You patch the system together and 
implement many manual work-arounds just to keep the system 
functioning.
	∙	 Suicide Project: This project has no chance of success and offers 
you nothing but pain. This is the equivalent of your worst night­
mare project. Word of caution, avoid suicide projects!12
Analyze your school and work projects and find a project that 
would fit in each box. What could you have done differently on your 
suicide project to ensure its success? What can you do to avoid being 
placed on a suicide project? Given the choice, which type of project 
would you choose to work on and why?
