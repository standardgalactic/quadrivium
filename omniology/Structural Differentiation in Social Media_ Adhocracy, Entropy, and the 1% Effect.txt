Acknowledgments
This book is the product of a long journey. Although there are only two authors on 
the cover, the book and the projects behind it are the product of a true fellowship. 
We are in debt to the many people and many organizations that made this book pos-
sible. First, we would like to thank Purdue University and the National Science 
Foundation, specifically those officers, administrators, and anonymous reviewers 
and colleagues who believed in our project and in our work. Several Purdue grants, 
including those awarded by the College of Liberal Arts, by the Purdue Research 
Foundation, by the Office of the Vice President for Research, and by Discovery 
Park, made this book possible, and the NSF award BCS 1244708 was instrumental 
in bringing this project to fruition.
Among the many individual people who selflessly supported this book, we need 
to first acknowledge Elisa Bertino, the head of the Purdue University Cyber Center 
and a mentor for us all in grant writing and research design. Luca de Alfaro, from 
the University of California, Santa Cruz, graciously shared the core data set of 
Wikipedia revisions for the 2001–2010 interval with us, including a core metric for 
effort at the revision level. We have also benefitted from support from our col-
leagues, Michael Zhu and Chuanhai Liu, as well as from their graduate student, 
Wutao Wei. Another of our colleagues, David Braun, and our graduate students, 
David Lazer and Azat Khairov, also contributed a good amount of effort through 
various channels, including the Discovery Park Internship Programs. Serendipity 
Labs, in Chicago, was the place where this volume took shape, and the hospitality 
of this co-working space and of its manager, Andreas Brandl, should also be 
mentioned.
We are also in debt to our families and friends who listened to our presentations 
and encouraged us along the way. These individuals are too numerous and their sup-
port too great to properly detail here, but this volume, and the years of work that 
culminated in it, would not have been possible without their love and the strength 
that they gave us.

Chapter 1
Introduction
1.1  Inequality in Online Groups
If Wikipedia was a country and words its income, the wildly uneven distribution of 
wealth among its contributor-citizens would be unheard of. The wealth distribution 
of the USA, for instance, which some see as quite unfair, pales by comparison, as 
the top 1% of American earners account for “only” 15% of the national income 
compared to the 77% of content “owned” by the top 1% of Wikipedians (see 
Fig. 1.1).
Our book explains why and how this uneven distribution matters. We believe 
that, far from being an abnormality, this inequality is a sign that Wikipedia has 
developed organically and naturally. The imbalance, in fact, shows that the site is 
structurally differentiated and that functional leaders have emerged, both processes 
that are essential for a healthy, functioning project. In this respect, the proverbial top 
1% of contributors have a positive effect, as they anchor and serve as a contributing 
elite group with an important role in shaping the project.
We call the emerging Wikipedia elite “functional leaders.” Unlike elected or 
nominated leaders, or leaders who are hired and bestowed with certain rights and 
privileges consecrated by an organizational chart and bylaws, functional leaders 
lead by doing. They do more and contribute more frequently than anyone else in the 
same project. They are the most productive contributors. They naturally emerge in 
many social media spaces, initially as essential nodes of production and later 
through leading contributions as well as their interactions with other members.
In this volume, we analyze the emergence of functional leaders on Wikipedia to 
explain how this elite group shapes one of the most successful social media projects 
on the planet in terms of both content and organizing the division of labor. In the 
process, we also show how the Wikipedia elites tend to become stable and increas-
ingly influential over time. Finally, we interpret these findings, suggesting that 
social media projects that have a collaborative goal develop, in a rather short period, 
a new, resilient, yet different type of social hierarchy that combines features of 

2
­traditional and new, online, social organizations. The main proposition is that these 
features do not resemble anything that we have previously observed. They are not 
authoritarian and top-down, nor democratic, nor egalitarian. They are a form of 
adhocratic, hierarchical social organization. To explain the terms and its evolution, 
we propose a new organizational change framework, which considers a gamut of 
organizational configurations and transition processes that drive their evolution.
As a brief introduction, the term “adhocracy” suggests that, far from being decen-
tralized, spontaneously coordinated crowdsourced projects such as Wikipedia are, in 
fact, orchestrated by an organizational system that combines a stable power hierarchy 
with individual mobility. More experienced members maintain a relatively structured 
collaboration process, while—at least on Wikipedia—users ascend to positions of 
power through an osmotic process of social advancement. Our time series analysis of 
Wikipedia contributions shows that as the elite group becomes more stable, with the 
same individuals maintaining their elite status over time, the project tended to reach 
and stay at a relatively high level of social structuration. In addition, we used a social 
entropy method to measure social structuration by observing the inequality of contri-
butions. This approach showed that over time, Wikipedia editors tend to separate into

subgroups representing varying contribution intensity levels and functional roles, and 
these subgroups maintain considerable stability over time.
One especially distinguishing feature of our book is its broad set of theoretical 
and practical implications. In this book, we explain the prevalence of uneven contri-
bution distributions across online projects from a new perspective. We reject the 
claims that these skewed distributions merely result from the fact that not all con-
tributors can work together all of the time. Rather, we demonstrate that top contribu-
tors tend to form a stable elite through which they build and maintain their roles. In 
addition, we propose an organizational configuration model that advances the con-
cept and operationalization of structuration from a unidimensional measure to a 
five-dimensional space describing organizational change.
1.2  Theoretical Starting Points
The advent of the Internet promised faster and more direct social interactions. Some 
predicted more equal contributions and greater access to the human store of knowl-
edge (Benkler 2006; Brafman and Beckstrom 2006). Yet, empirical observations 
have dampened these claims of egalitarianism, suggesting an alternative scenario: 
inequality is just as prevalent in online interactions as it is in real life, if not even 
more so (Matei et al. 2015).
Shirky (2008) offers an especially lucid assessment of this inevitable imbalance. 
He proposes that the amount of voluntary work invested in Internet communities 
follows the Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule) wherein a few individu-
als (20%) contribute most (80%) of the effort. While the exact proportions might 
vary, particularly in social systems with even more extreme long-tail distributions 
(Huberman 2003), the observed inequality is itself not unusual. Barabási (2014; see 
also Newman et al. 2006), among others, referred to it when discussing the power-­
law distribution of web links and interactions. It has also been observed in many 
other human pursuits, particularly the distributions of income, of volunteer time, 
and of work team effort, the latter of which will be discussed below.
With a few exceptions, such as Shirky’s work and more empirically based 
research (Kuk 2006; Ortega et al. 2008) on free and open source software (FLOSS), 
as well as the occasional paper dedicated to Wikipedia (Muchnik et al. 2013), the 
uneven distribution of inputs and outputs in social media remains a topic that leaves 
many questions to be asked and answered. Of course, we know and expect that 
some voices might dominate social media discourse. Yet, we are only beginning to 
understand some of the most basic differences between the elites who dominate 
social media and those at the top of the income, civic, and other social distribution 
pyramids. In particular, despite the revelation that online volunteer contribution dis-
tributions tend to be much more skewed than those of face-to-face social systems1 
1 “[A] tight-knit community of 600 to 1000 volunteers does the bulk of the work [on Wikipedia], 
according to Wikipedia cofounder Jimmy Wales.”
1.2  Theoretical Starting Points

(Shaw 2008), we lack an integrated theory-based perspective to explain why the 
online realm in particular lends itself to such dramatically uneven distributions.
Beyond that, examining the extreme inequalities of online groups begs a few 
additional questions about the nature of elites in such communities, especially since 
they are set apart from the masses to a much greater degree than the top participants 
in most face-to-face groups. For instance, how does one become a super contributor 
to a platform like Wikipedia and how long does one’s status as such last? More 
importantly, how does the presence of such contributors influence the system-level 
contribution dynamics? Finally, are organizations with such significant contribution 
inequalities stable? If not, how do they evolve? The evolutionary perspective is par-
ticularly important for our study, as it grounds the discussion about social media 
projects on a principled sociological basis, connecting older concerns with newer 
theories about social organization among humans.
Beyond the broader theoretical considerations, the current study is grounded in a 
very specific domain of investigation, addressing the nature and extent to which 
contributions made to the online encyclopedia Wikipedia are unequal. Yet, describ-
ing the extent of inequality is not the ultimate goal. The final goals are:
	1.	 To longitudinally describe elite contributions and the process of social 
differentiation
	2.	 To derive an empirical model for evolutionary differentiation
	3.	 To use elite evolution, both in terms of resilience and relative weight in the pro-
duction system, as an explanatory lens for the global evolution of an online 
(social media) system
	4.	 To demonstrate that social media dynamics lead to a new type of leadership 
borne out of an adhocratic organizational structure that combines top-down and 
bottom-up processes
	5.	 To propose a principle-based evolutionary model for organizational change
	6.	 To develop a multidimensional method to explain transitions between organiza-
tional configurations
Our theoretical framework is that of social differentiation enhanced with an 
adhocratic perspective (Matei and Bruno 2014). Through it, we argue that the 
unevenness observed in many social media spaces conceals an even more important 
process: the emergence of division of labor and a hierarchical functional power 
structure that is, at the same time, adhocratic. By this, we mean that while the identi-
ties of the roles and missions performed by those at the top of the social structure 
are quasi-stable, the occupants of those roles and performers of those missions are 
subject to highly contingent factors such as availability, social interaction con-
straints arising from time and space, and so forth.
Building on this argument, we propose an evolutionary model complete with a 
new theory for the emergence of a small and resilient contributor elite on Wikipedia. 
Highly active contributors effectively shape the social structuration of the project. 
They create and perform specific functional roles, especially that of the “elite 
­contributor,” an individual who leads by example. He or she shapes the collaboration

and the content by intervening often, at certain intervals, to shape the overall content 
of an article or topic.
We also propose a method to detect how long elite members survive at the top of 
the contribution pyramid, which is subsequently used to explain how resilience or 
“stickiness” among members of the elite group influences the emergence of functional 
leadership. Beyond this, we evaluate the ways in which individual connections to 
members of the elite create a path for advancement to an elite contributor status. In 
other words, we consider whether an ordinary contributor’s collaboration with elite 
members affects his or her likelihood of advancing from ordinary to elite status as 
well.
Finally, we propose a synthesized theoretical model of organizational change 
that integrates five dimensions of collaborative activities on Wikipedia. The model 
incorporates the development of collaborative attractiveness, extroversion, commu-
nication flows, structural order, and trends in the choice of coeditorial partners. Our 
goal in using this model is to determine the specific historical points at which 
Wikipedia changed organizational configurations between set of several possibili-
ties: entrepreneurial, machine bureaucratic, professional bureaucratic, divisional-
ized, and adhocratic. Our explanatory model can naturally be extended to other 
social media, explaining how they develop a specific type of social order within 
which social mobility, power differentiation, and division of labor are the norm.
In the end, we aim to contribute to the broader understanding of the purported 
“egalitarianism,” or lack thereof, in social media projects and how much a new class 
of “sticky elites” shapes the fate of social media projects.
1.3  Problem Significance
It is generally easy and cheap to join and to add content to social media sites such 
as Wikipedia. After all, this is part of the new generation of so-called user-generated 
media. Wikipedia is built around the idea that anyone who wants to change content 
should be able to do so. Because of such functionality and inclusiveness, many 
believe that social media like Wikipedia are spaces of free association and minimal 
hierarchically driven interaction (Gillmor 2006; Goode 2009).
Social media are indeed peer production hubs in which individuals connect to 
each other without supervision or censorship, and users are clearly not controlled or 
directed by a centralized formal control mechanism. And, to a certain extent, social 
media users do co-orient their contributions based on the cues that are provided by 
the tools they use, engaging with the content in a somewhat similar manner, thus 
suggesting a form of homogeneity across users.
With that said, is this co-orientation the only coordination mechanism existing in 
social media spaces? Are social methods of coordination also important? To what 
degree do these ultimately encourage more or less evenly distributed contributions? 
Further, how much do these methods clash with technological coordination

­mechanisms, which some believe discourage the emergence of formal social roles 
and leadership positions (Benkler 2006; Segerberg and Bennett 2011; Shirky 2008)?
We suggest that Wikipedia and other social media do involve ad hoc leadership 
structures that are responsible for most social coordination. These are not immedi-
ately apparent or even immediately present in social media projects. They evolve 
over time and are, in certain instances, preceded by organizational configurations 
that resemble older and more common forms of organizing. Yet, in the end, social 
media tend to foster a certain kind of leadership that is defined by the amount of 
work completed rather than by an official organizational chart. Such leadership 
plays a functional social role, that of funneling effort and content in particular ways, 
which may exacerbate unequal social contribution patterns.
To preface the more detailed argument to be presented below, let us briefly exam-
ine how the skewness of contribution patterns on a social medium like Wikipedia 
compares to those found in more mundane areas of human activity. For the sake of 
brevity, we will only mention civic and economic systems as illustrative examples, 
but many others could be invoked as well.
We analyzed the entire Wikipedia editorial database, containing every single edit 
made to every article, between 2001 and 2010, for a total of approximately 250 mil-
lion edits made by roughly 22 million editors. Three million of these editors were 
attributed to logged-in accounts, while the remaining 19 million were anonymous 
users who were nonetheless identifiable by IP addresses (see below for method-
ological details). Our study starts from one foundational finding of our own analy-
sis: the top 1% of all Wikipedia contributors are responsible for 77% of the 
collaborative effort on Wikipedia based upon the extent to which the text of articles 
was actually changed. Likewise, the top 20% of the editing population covers a 
staggering 99% of Wikipedia’s collaborative effort.
This far exceeds the comparatively modest inequalities among civic activities in 
the USA. For example, the American Time Use Survey conducted by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics (2016) reveals that between 2003 and 2011, 1% of the US adult 
population was responsible for 40% of the total time volunteered to civic, religious, 
or sport associations.2 This is an impressive enough figure, but it is nonetheless only 
half as overwhelming as the contribution inequality observed on Wikipedia. Further, 
if we only take into account the people who volunteered at least once (much like 
how our Wikipedia figures only consider individuals who revised an article at least 
once), the top 1% of all volunteers contributed only 5% of all volunteer time, and 
individuals in the top 20% were responsible for merely 50% of the time volunteered 
in the USA.
Inequality on Wikipedia is also far more intense than that of income distribution. 
The top 20% of the American workforce, each of whom makes over $101,582 per 
year, jointly reap 51% of the combined national personal income (US Census 
Bureau 2014). Again, although this figure may be noteworthy in its own right, it 
pales in comparison to the 1% of Wikipedia contributors responsible for 77% of the 
work.

1  Introduction

The sharp divergence between inequality online and the distribution of tradi-
tional social interactions demands an explanatory mechanism. Shirky’s (2008, 
2010) popular books on the social media revolution opened the conversation. 
Shortly thereafter, Kumar et al. (2006) highlighted the prevalence of this inequality 
in online social networks, and Ortega et al. (2008) demonstrated its applicability to 
free software projects (FLOSS). In a limited sense, using simpler measures than the 
ones proposed here, Ortega et  al. (2008) showed that the online community of 
Wikipedia editors does indeed have an unequal distribution of contributions. The 
more important question, however, is not merely whether or not such inequalities 
exist, but rather, what they mean.
Some early work (Javanmardi et al. 2009; Nov 2007) attributed online inequali-
ties to the different motivations and abilities of contributors. Matei and Bruno 
(2014) and Arazy and Nov (2010), however, extended the conversation about the 
nature of such differentials, arguing that inequalities on Wikipedia represent much 
more than natural variations of individual effort or abilities. Matei and Bruno (2014) 
in particular suggested that inequalities tap into something more significant: the 
emergence of leading functional roles. Such role differentiation speaks about the 
fundamental nature of human collaboration.
At the same time, the ethical dimension of unequal distributions remains impor-
tant, as examining inequality in social media may yield a better understanding of 
equality across contexts. Equality, after all, is the cornerstone of democratic society. 
Are online processes a reflection of our existing (presumably) egalitarian society? 
Or are they making an already unbalanced situation even worse?
1.4  Research Strategy
To answer such questions, we need to move beyond the descriptive research that 
currently predominates. The next natural step is to propose explanatory models for 
how online inequality emerges and why it matters. To this end, we have developed 
a social structural evolutionary model in which observed inequalities in social 
media are considered to be symptoms of larger social growth and transformation. In 
short, when we detect inequalities, it means that loosely connected individuals are 
about to form more complex communities of practice. Such inequalities also sug-
gest the emergence of functional roles and of a stewardship mechanism to accultur-
ate newcomers. When observed in a multidimensional space that incorporates a 
variety of interactional choices, we can describe inequality as a part of a set of 
interactional dynamics that correspond to specific organizational configurations.
In this volume, we propose and follow a multistep research strategy for deploy-
ing our explanatory mechanism:
	1.	 Map the evolution of inequality on Wikipedia and detect the distinct growth 
phases determined by the emergence of functional leaders over a period of 
9.5 years (2001–2010).
1.4  Research Strategy

8
	2.	 Develop and test an organizational evolution model for Wikipedia.
	3.	 Study the in-project social mobility of functional leaders on Wikipedia by mea-
suring the stability of the top 1% of all Wikipedia contributors over time as long-­
term members of this elite group.
	4.	 Hypothesize a hierarchical model of functional elites that accounts for both top-­
down and bottom-up processes.
	5.	 Propose an online organizational transformation framework that relies on a mul-
tidimensional organizational configuration approach.
	6.	 Validate the proposition that Wikipedia advanced toward an adhocratic organiza-
tional model over time.
Of these three steps, 4 and 6 are perhaps the most important, as they address 
processes that have largely been ignored in the literature: namely, the role of social 
influence in the formation of digital elites and paths for organizational transforma-
tion. At the same time, our strategy also promotes a new way of understanding the 
social evolution of the online spontaneous groups that are responsible for much of 
the knowledge that we use in our everyday lives.
1.5  Theoretical Perspective
1.5.1  Inequality and Evolutionary Processes
Besides structural differentiation, another cornerstone of our research is an evolu-
tionary perspective on organizational growth within online projects in which mem-
bers may freely associate with one another. A number of theoretical perspectives 
support the proposition that in spontaneously emerging organizations, contribution 
inequality is not an isolated phenomenon but is instead fundamentally connected to 
other organizational dynamics. We employ a distinct theoretical strand that treats 
this inequality as a symptom of, among other things, functional differentiation 
(Bales 1950; Blau 1977; Britt 2013). While inequalities could certainly be exacer-
bated by authoritarian control and manipulation, a significant degree of inequality 
emerges during the evolution of online collaborative communities via their natural 
process of social organization alone. This is also what we would expect to find on 
Wikipedia, which experiences relatively minimal formal managerial intervention.
In short, as spontaneously emerging organizations take on more complex tasks 
and as their members develop ongoing interactions over time, roles and a division 
of labor emerge. This naturally creates an unequal distribution of inputs and out-
puts, which thus reflects a process of structural differentiation. Structural differen-
tiation, in turn, develops over time as the organization proceeds through a series of 
different configurations.
An evolutionary perspective represents the optimal avenue for explaining 
inequality as functional and structural differentiation. After all, inequality can be 
seen as a component of functional differentiation if, when mapping it over time, we

uncover discrete phases and emergent social roles (see Britt 2013) and, at the same 
time, identify specific influences that drive transformations into various organiza-
tional configurations. This perspective is congruent with the evolutionary paradigm 
proposed by Wenger (1998) for communities of practice, some of the most con-
spicuous forms of spontaneously emerging organizations. The community of prac-
tice lens also fits Wikipedia, our object of study, as suggested by Ayers et al. (2008) 
and O’Sullivan (2009). Our organizational configuration change model, likewise, 
builds upon the foundations of several long-standing theoretical domains, including 
the seminal works of Van de Ven and Poole (1995) and Mintzberg (1979).
Communities of practice are domain-specific voluntary associations with a prac-
tical orientation. They generate, exchange, and curate “practice,” that is, know-how 
informed by knowledge. Structurally, they are crosscutting communities based on 
functional roles. In such communities, individual participants focus on the most 
sensible ways of generating a particular outcome (product, process, know-how, 
knowledge, etc.) and perform their functions accordingly. It is not especially impor-
tant for members of such groups to follow formally prescribed modes of production 
or official chains of command, yet leaders still serve a vital role in guiding the work 
effort. These leaders are rarely appointed; rather, they naturally emerge from the 
process of collaboration itself, leading by doing and stewarding by showing new-
comers the standard practices and norms of the community—in other words, dem-
onstrating “how it’s done.”
Ayers et al. (2008) provide a historical perspective to illustrate how Wikipedia 
functions as a successful community of practice. Briefly, the community relies on 
informality and bold leadership. It fosters functional, achieved roles, eschewing 
formal hierarchies and ascribed organizational roles. Yet leaders are nonetheless 
real and influential. They represent the future of the project, teaching new members 
how to use the tools and showcasing the norms related to editing, organizing con-
tent, and combating vandals. While many editors move between these roles, there 
are others who specialize in one particular task. In short, much like the old Royal 
Society of London, Wikipedia is a community dedicated to the practice of gathering 
and sharing knowledge. Their organizational mechanisms may differ, but their goals 
are the same.
According to Wenger (1998), communities of practice typically start with a 
rough period of incubation. During this phase, members experiment with the tools 
and rules and try to define their own participant roles. This is a time of sudden shifts 
in responsibilities and membership. Contributions can be fairly even at times, while 
at other points certain members dominate.
The second period is that of coalescence, a stage in which the community 
emerges as a well-defined collaborative space. Members negotiate the manner in 
which the community will operate, developing initial behavioral norms. This slowly 
reduces the initial chaos of the growing social system. During this period, the ulti-
mate direction in which the organization will grow is clarified, at least to a degree. 
The long-term community goals and an envisioned trajectory for reaching them also 
become more tangible.
1.5  Theoretical Perspective

10
In the third, climactic phase, associative processes reach a form that the organi-
zation would consider close to its ideal. This is also when a final stewardship system 
emerges. Specific members take charge of both the coordination and the contribu-
tion process for longer periods of time. Inequality also stabilizes once the leaders 
have emerged. Structural differentiation, whereby functional leaders become distin-
guishable from ordinary participants, is complete. Activity may expand or decay 
over time, depending on the effectiveness of the leaders.
Britt’s (2013) initial organizational-level examination of Wikipedia falls in line 
with Wenger’s claim. According to Britt, the first phase of Wikipedia’s development 
was a period of gestation during which inequality varied wildly and even declined 
to a certain degree. He equated this period with that of a simple organization, during 
which Wikipedia relied on the efforts of a very small number of contributors whose 
participation was sometimes inconsistent. Although Britt primarily focused on 
high-level organizational structures rather than the fine-grained behaviors of indi-
vidual editors, at this stage we can nonetheless conjecture that the community 
appeared to be exploring various schemes for self-organization and leadership roles. 
In any case, after reaching a relative minimum, egalitarianism on Wikipedia 
rebounded until eventually stabilizing, at which point it remained at a rather high 
level for years afterward. This signaled that the organization had finally settled on a 
more permanent structure and suggested that organizational leaders and stewards 
had also emerged. The structure was, however, an adhocratic one, as we will show 
in the text to come.
One of the purposes of this manuscript is to expand on this initial model and to 
provide a comprehensive method to define and track organizational change. This 
approach is detailed at length in part II of this volume.
In brief, the evolutionary model for communities of practice proposes specific 
phases of inequality, with discrete inflection points separating each phase from the 
other. This volume illustrates how to detect such points in the evolution of inequal-
ity on Wikipedia. In addition, it proposes an organizational configuration change 
model, which overlaps and more precisely describes the evolutionary process.
By detecting the phases in the evolution of inequality, we also facilitate a further 
exploration of the emergence of functional leaders. As previously noted, a steady 
state of inequality indicates that a long-term stewardship mechanism has emerged, 
through which certain individuals willfully lead the coordination efforts. These 
stewards invest greater amounts of energy and time in the project and set the tone 
and expectations for the larger working group, becoming functional leaders. They 
lead by example.
Wenger (1998) and others (see, e.g., Bales 1953) argue that the emergence of 
stewards is a natural and recurrent process. The roots of this perspective can be 
traced to the earliest studies in organizational sociology. Durkheim’s (1893) Division 
of Labor in Society is the earliest investigation of the issue, and several of its core 
concepts, especially roles and dynamic density, are still useful today. With that said, 
Blau’s (1977) more recent foundational work is also quite relevant. He argued that 
we need to consider inequality (in terms of organizational work) as a binding factor 
1  Introduction

11
when a given organization exhibits sufficient heterogeneity in its group affiliations, 
a supposition that is quite germane in this context.
Bales’ (1953) work on the distribution of effort in small teams can also be 
invoked here. Bales observed that in most spontaneous small teams, a few members 
are ultimately responsible for the majority of a team’s output. In his classic study on 
small group interaction, Bales noted that, across experiments, the distribution of 
effort was unequal. Even in groups of complete strangers with no prior history, 
some members stood out. They interacted more, talked more, and were recognized 
as leaders more often than other members. This illustrates, firstly, the prevalence of 
role divisions and contribution inequality across contexts. For our purposes, it also 
further explains why such obviously critical inequalities might be even more pro-
nounced in some contexts—like Wikipedia—than others.
1.5.2  Adhocracy: Social Mobility Moderates Inequality
The suggestion that uneven contributions are symptoms of structural differentiation 
demands a caveat, as inequality might have two main components. The first of these 
would be social/interaction inequality, a mere measure of skewness in the distribu-
tion of rewards and benefits across the system at various points in time. The second 
is social mobility, a measure of how “sticky” people are in receiving this skewed 
proportion of rewards and benefits over time—in other words, whether elites and 
followers tend to resiliently maintain their relative statures from day to day, week to 
week, and so forth.
This distinction is crucial. Even if inequality in a system is high at a particular 
point in time, the community can be characterized by even contributions over time 
if mobility is also high. When everyone rotates in and out of the “top” positions over 
time, inequality matters less. In fact, in such a scenario, structural differentiation 
may be low or almost nonexistent. Furthermore, inequality at a particular moment 
may be a mere statistical artifact if contributors are simply taking turns in adding 
content to a given project. Although some people do contribute a large amount of 
content within a given temporal span, such as a day, a week, or a month, the suppos-
edly unequal contributions might even out as different people contribute at different 
times. Yet, if specific community members consistently contribute the most over a 
long duration, then those unequal distributions become true footprints of functional 
roles played by certain “sticky” contribution leaders. All the same, even if func-
tional leaders emerge, it is not wise to presume that top contributors rigidly or 
oppressively dominate the contribution process. Organizations, especially those that 
function online, experience considerable turnover. As voluntary groups with low 
barriers to entry, online group membership will inevitably vary over time.
The research literature reviewed by Britt (2013) on the pattern of contributions to 
social media suggests an alternative, middle-ground view. While inequality is not a 
mere statistical artifact (Matei et al. 2015), there are nonetheless indications that the 
resilience of the functional elites varies over time. On this basis, we can expect a 
1.5  Theoretical Perspective

12
mixture of both elite resilience and elite membership turnover. Perhaps the best 
summation of this phenomenon comes from research on organizational leadership 
dynamics and, in particular, the idea of an adhocracy, an organizational configura-
tion that serves as an especially apt description of Wikipedian processes. After all, 
the name adds a nuance of fleetingness to an otherwise structured, long-lasting pro-
cess of leadership.
Let us address this concept at greater length. The term “adhocracy” was first 
introduced to the social scientific vocabulary by Alvin Toffler (1970) in his work on 
postmodern organizations. Mintzberg (1979, 1989) and Waterman (1993) later 
adapted the term to organizational science, using it to describe leadership in the 
context of just-in-time production and customized consumption. More recently and 
less formally, “adhocracy” was defined in A Dictionary of the Internet (Oxford 
Reference 2009) as a form of organization “that [does] not rely on job descriptions, 
hierarchy, standards, and procedures; rather, workers in the company carry out tasks 
because they need to be done.”
Adhocracies come with an important substantive proposition that goes beyond 
semantic innovation. Positions of power exist only as “virtual loci” of control. They 
are not substantive, permanent functions to be occupied by specific individuals for 
an indefinite period of time. Instead, they are relatively easily seized and, after a 
period, which might be prolonged but not unbounded, relinquished. In view of this, 
it is important to identify the rate and the mechanisms by which positions are gained 
and surrendered. More importantly, we need to determine how the top members or 
contributors survive in the elite group and how long they do so. In other words, what 
is the individual and group stickiness of the elite and by what methods do members 
enter or leave the elite group?
One core mechanism by which adhocracies promote leaders is osmotic inclu-
sion. New members are slowly and individually acculturated into the environment. 
The process is not one of deliberate recruitment but a gradual progression from user 
to leader, as suggested by Preece and Shneiderman (2009). Future elite members are 
only dimly aware of their initial own position in the grand scheme of things. They 
engage in tasks and incrementally increase their effort, and they become elite mem-
bers as their productivity reaches a loosely defined threshold. They take over for the 
members who tacitly drop out as the priorities, tasks, and time availabilities change. 
The process is one of overlapping individuals, microgroups, or dyads that naturally 
and seamlessly exchange roles and in-progress work activities over time, and it has 
no formal boundaries or mechanisms. In short, users ascend to the elite merely by 
working harder than everyone else.
Yet, the likelihood of stepping over the threshold may be enhanced through 
active engagement with existing elite members. Theoretically, a relatively produc-
tive nonelite member might have a higher chance to ascend to an elite position if he 
or she more closely collaborates with an elite member, and likewise, the pace of 
advancement to leadership positions could be hastened by establishing connections 
with existing elites, thereby growing more acculturated more quickly.
In our study, one core analytic step is detecting and mapping the longitudinal 
changes in the likelihood of nonelite users to become members of the functional 
1  Introduction

13
elite on Wikipedia. In the very specific terms of our study, we test the hypothesis 
that one’s likelihood of joining the group of functional leaders on Wikipedia is 
indeed dependent, at least in part, on the establishment of prior collaborative con-
nections with existing leaders. Our findings further open a secondary discussion 
about the adhocratic nature of the leadership cadre.
One note of caution should be issued about the interpretation of the adhocratic 
mechanism as described above. While adhocracy can explain, to a certain extent, the 
emergence of functional leadership positions, it cannot explain everything. 
Wikipedia is far more complex than the terms “functional role” or “osmotic induc-
tion” alone might suggest. In particular, the site includes several layers of formal 
control mechanisms, enforced by formal roles, including the “bureaucrats,” 
“admins,” and “sysadmins.” The former two groups have administrative rights, 
while the latter has coding privileges and access that allow them to run the software 
and hardware that power Wikipedia. These privileges include the ability to add, 
eliminate, and change site functionalities and utilities, rights that are exclusive to 
the formally defined role and which shape the entire contribution process. No study 
of Wikipedia’s collaborative structure can be considered complete in the absence of 
an acknowledgment of formal leadership roles. In that respect, the present study is 
only a partial attempt to disentangle one power and social structuration mechanism 
among many on Wikipedia. Although functional leadership is critically important 
on Wikipedia, that is not the only type of leadership at hand.
1.5.3  Wikipedia as a Site of Investigation: Significance, 
Research Review, and Data
As a whole, this volume examines Wikipedia as a major social project. Regardless 
of any arguments about the quality (or lack thereof) in its content (Giles 2005; 
Mullan 2009), Wikipedia’s prominence and relevance to this text come from its 
central role in the everyday lives of the general population. Briefly, Wikipedia is the 
fifth most visited website in the world (Alexa 2016). Approximately 300 million 
individuals check Wikipedia each day, a figure that equates to just under 10% of the 
world’s Internet-connected population of 3–3.5 billion people (International 
Telecommunication Union 2016). Just as importantly, Wikipedia is joined at the hip 
with major social media and search technologies. At least eight in ten searches for 
common nouns on Google return a Wikipedia article as one of the top 10 results 
(Miller 2012; Silverwood-Cope 2012). Consequently, Wikipedia is one of the most 
common sources of information for student papers, with over 80% of college stu-
dents making use of it (Head and Eisenberg 2010; Colón-Aguirre and Fleming-May 
2012), and it is even becoming a major source for journalists (Cision and Bates 
2009), as 61% of professionals use it for their own research (Shaw 2008).
Wikipedia is, however, more than a simple reference site: it is a community of 
contributors in continuous growth. It grew from a dozen hackers and enthusiasts, 
1.5  Theoretical Perspective

14
bandied together by a former commodities trader and online entrepreneur, into a 
community of over 20 million registered users. We should add that tens of millions 
of anonymous users have also edited Wikipedia, resulting in a truly unprecedented 
base of contributors for this one community.
The dynamic of the contributions made by these individuals has been scrutinized 
in the past. At times, the goal has been to emphasize the egalitarianism and openness 
of the project. For example, Andrew Lih’s (2009) insider account, The Wikipedia 
revolution, was subtitled, How a bunch of nobodies created the world’s greatest 
encyclopedia, in an apparent attempt to promote the ideal of the “wisdom of the 
masses” over the role of either experts or organizational structures. Yet systematic 
research has uncovered the more complex underpinnings of Wikipedia’s editorial 
process, such as the findings of Kittur and Kraut (2008, 2010; see also Kittur et al. 
2009a, b), which highlighted the importance of coordination (operationalized as 
inequality assessed via the Gini coefficient) in constructing content.
Various scholars have explored the nature of Wikipedia’s content production sys-
tems, with a particular emphasis on the relatively structured nature of the interaction 
(Brandes et al. 2009). Others have investigated the topics of roles and leadership, 
albeit mostly from a qualitative perspective or by focusing only on the social roles 
adopted in very specific contexts (Konieczny 2009). Arazy and his colleagues 
(Arazy et al. 2015, 2017) went beyond these narrow approaches, taking a closer 
look at the diversity and quasi-permanence of roles of Wikipedia. They ultimately 
found that roles are defined through an increasing tendency to invest oneself in the 
project by taking over and “curating” specific articles, thus validating the idea of a 
functional role in which an individual leads by active work. This volume intersects 
and builds upon this idea at a more abstract level of analysis, as we ask the broader 
question of how and why online communities generate stable elites like those that 
Arazy et al. observed.
Social collaboration on Wikipedia has also been researched in some depth, at 
times under the rubric of social network approaches, and typically with the goal of 
detecting communities and patterns of cooperative work (Yang et al. 2013). Finally, 
the evolution of Wikipedia as a social space has also been investigated using social 
network approaches (Capocci et al. 2006) as well as more traditional perspectives 
(Kittur et al. 2007). Previous work has only intermittently examined these systems 
from a quantitative, longitudinal perspective, however, and aside from the very 
recent exceptions published by Arazy et al. (2015) and Muchnik et al. (2013), they 
certainly have not developed any high-level abstract explanatory mechanisms for 
the development of social collaboration systems over time. Likewise, the other core 
questions in this volume—the evolving interaction between contribution inequality 
and leadership role stability, the mechanisms by which a contributor ascends to a 
leadership role, and the multidimensional nature of organizational configuration 
change—have not been previously addressed. This text serves to fill these gaps in 
the literature.
Chapter 2 is dedicated to reviewing some of the literature on social media, with 
special attention paid to the perspective of the studies dedicated to Wikipedia, 
through which we explore and clarify the social structuration and inequality that is

present in social media spaces. In the remainder of part I, we continue with an 
analysis of social structuration and online elite resilience, which provides a key 
underpinning for our theoretical understanding of how social media develop their 
adhocratic power. Finally, in part II of this volume, we introduce, present, and 
employ a theoretical mechanism for future work on organizational structures that 
extends beyond adhocracy alone, together with some social structural analyses that 
serve to validate it.

2.1  Introduction
Humans are social animals. Sociability is not a mere behavioral accident. On the 
contrary, it is probably what makes us human in the first place. Some have claimed 
that language is the defining characteristic that sets the human species apart, while 
others claim that the distinguishing factor is reason, art, or even humor. All of these 
are true, to an extent, as they are key components of our ability to socialize—a 
behavior in which humans engage more frequently and more dynamically than any 
other creature.
This is, of course, when observers do not claim that evolution only incrementally 
pushed some human traits a bit further than other species while simultaneously 
restraining certain other traits. By this account, the difference between humans and 
other animal species would be incremental and quantitative rather than qualitative.
Regardless, sociability is the pillar upon which collaboration can occur and 
through which human society as we know it today was built. The vital functions of 
families, clubs, businesses, communities, nations, and our increasingly connected 
world hinge upon social interactions. One can consider the paper on which this 
book was printed (or the e-reader screen on which it is displayed), the money that 
you used to purchase it, the profession through which you secure your income, and 
so forth. All of these artifacts only arise from our engagement with those around us, 
and those essential elements of our lives in turn give rise to new means of socializa-
tion. Every element of day-to-day human existence that we take for granted as being 
unique to our species is, in fact, only possible because of social engagement. It 
should come as no surprise that sociability stands as the crux of society.
Although this volume is not intended to resolve the age-old philosophical argu-
ment about the uniqueness of human existence, it does stake out a perimeter in the 
debate about the nature of online sociability, which we see as a very specific phe-
nomenon with particular characteristics. To accomplish this, we need to start with a 
few preliminary considerations about social behavior in general, as online ­sociability 

22
is a species of a given genus. This discussion is necessary because sociability is the 
unavoidable criterion for defining human existence and, moreover, because it can be 
seen as a superseding factor that may explain many other human phenomena.
In consequence, any explanation of what humans do, especially when they do 
something socially in a new way (e.g., invisible communities mediated by digital 
technologies), needs to account for the deeper meanings of the social nature of the 
behavior and related forms of organization. In what follows, we will outline how the 
human propensity for sociability shapes the emergence of some truly novel and 
unexpected forms of collaboration such as that observed on Wikipedia as well as 
other types of social media that produce useful knowledge.
2.2  Human Sociability: Possible Definitions
To begin, let us consider sociability at a rather deep and not so intuitive level. We 
may first state that sociability is a useful and necessary term because it does not 
simply state that humans are social. Rather, sociability further signals that humans 
are social in a special, human way. Our focus on sociability is a pointed one, as we 
believe that sociability encompasses the concepts of social order, social meaning, 
social roles, and social structure (Blau 1977). To paraphrase the famous dictum of 
the communication scholar Kenneth Burke, humans are “goaded by the spirit of 
hierarchy” (Burke 1966, p. 16). Otherwise put, there are at least theoretical reasons 
to believe that sociability is related to more specific concepts, such as patterned 
social interactions that lead to meaningful social structures and roles (Berger and 
Luckmann 1980). At the same time, sociability cannot be reduced to a form of trans-
actional individualistic organization in which only individual, autonomous, locally 
oriented acts matter. Otherwise, much of what people do offline or online, including 
the staggering inequality of effort and rewards, would be hard to explain.
Further, our use and understanding of term “sociability” rest both on a deeper, 
more philosophical foundation and on more tangible theorems about human interac-
tion and organization (Schutz 1967). At the deepest level, our concept of sociability 
taps into the deeper meanings of Aristotle’s famous dictum, “anthropos zoon poli-
tikon.” Translated by some as “the human being is a political animal,” we prefer the 
interpretation “humans are sociable animals.” In the former English rendering, the 
aphorism misses the true point of Aristotle’s vision of human essence. His use of the 
word “politikon” was forced by the nature of Greek thinking at the time, which 
identified living in a city (polis) with living in a polity, that is, the Greek city state, 
which to him meant “living in a society.” Yet, what Aristotle truly meant to say is not 
that “man” (as he understood it in a gendered way) is limited to those who lived in 
Greek states. His intention was to define universal man, Greek or barbarian:
Hence it is evident that the state is a creation of nature, and that man is by nature a political 
animal. And he who by nature and not by mere accident is without a state, is either a bad 
man or above humanity; he is like the “Tribeless, lawless, hearthless one,” whom Homer 
denounces—the natural outcast is forthwith a lover of war; he may be compared to an

­isolated piece at draughts. Now, that man is more of a political animal than bees or any other 
gregarious animals is evident. Nature, as we often say, makes nothing in vain, and man is 
the only animal whom she has endowed with the gift of speech. And whereas mere voice is 
but an indication of pleasure or pain, and is therefore found in other animals (for their 
nature attains to the perception of pleasure and pain and the intimation of them to one 
another, and no further), the power of speech is intended to set forth the expedient and 
inexpedient, and therefore likewise the just and the unjust. And it is a characteristic of man 
that he alone has any sense of good and evil, of just and unjust, and the like, and the associa-
tion of living beings who have this sense makes a family and a state. (Aristotle 350 B.C.)
In Aristotle’s view, the human being is unique because to function, he or she 
needs a community of beings like him or her. This is necessary not merely to survive 
in the most immediate sense, but more importantly, to grow, to become autono-
mous, and to contribute back to the survival of the larger community that makes his 
or her own subsistence possible. To this end, the community will, by necessity, use 
language to instruct, command, educate, and support. The social ties that the com-
munity needs to bind and support individuals to maturity will be articulated by logi-
cal thought and reasoned principles but also by emotionally expressed connections. 
Logic and reason and affect and emotion always occur in the context of language 
and communication. Communication is symbolic, and thus it conveys messages 
through a variety of means, from commonplace verbal discourse to highly stylized 
artifacts and representations of shared meaning. Such methods include both sci-
ences and the arts, from the fine (painting, sculpture) to the performative (poetry, 
theatre, dance).
Throughout the process of making humans what they are through communica-
tion and culture, sociability will bestow on some certain roles, complete with asso-
ciated rights, privileges, and obligations, while to others various alternative roles. 
Fathers and mothers rear and teach sons and daughters some basic elements of 
being human. These include customary habits of behavior and thought, elementary 
moral principles, and rules of social conduct ranging from good manners to reli-
gious and ethical principles. After a certain age, teachers take over this educational 
role, and eventually, humans learn their trade of being human “on the job” as mem-
bers of various institutions, groups, and social arrangements that are more or less 
formally defined. In each of these situations, starting with what was initially defined 
by the family context, certain divisions and situations—at some times, of labor, and 
at others, of power and privilege—teach humans to work with, to submit to, or to 
take control over others. These constraints teach growing individuals that human 
affairs are patterned interactions by which individuals assume one or more roles that 
give them just as much as they take in terms of autonomy.
Of course, this learning on the job, “learning by doing,” does not mean that the 
social institutions, the roles, the power arrangements, or the difference between the 
“haves” and “have nots” that they often entail are natural or justified. All roles and 
the privileges or privations they entail are the product, after all, of a place and a time 
in which human ideas of worth, power, and representativity are influenced by a 
variety of factors. These may be merit-related, or they may be mere accidents of 
human inequality or chance. Roles and rules are subsequently consolidated by

­religious or quasi-religious justifications of sacred vs. ordinary vocations or rein-
forced by material interest, birthright, raw power differences, or pseudo-moral prin-
ciples of the “first come, first served” kind (Weber 1947).
Yet across, above, and beyond the particular ways in which roles and social 
forms of organization exist, and superseding any discussion about one’s ethical, 
moral, and justifiable existence, being human inevitably hinges upon assuming and 
enacting roles within social institutions (Schutz and Luckmann 1989). In fact, if we 
are to believe that there is a possibility to improve the human species in the social 
and moral realm, we have to believe that this can only be done by making sure that 
roles are acquired or rights and obligations distributed in an equitable, just, and 
moral way. The alternative view that the human vocation is to free humans from all 
roles and organization, that human autonomy is the only measure of all good things, 
and that roles, rules, and obligations must be abolished has remained so far the 
province of utopian projects that have failed and continue to fail in practice, from 
the short-lived radical Anabaptist communities of the Protestant Reformation to the 
doomed province of some communist experiments shortly after 1917 and the hippie 
communes of the 1960s.
With all of this said, Aristotle’s dictum is not merely another metaphoric utter-
ance of an ancient figure about the out-of-fashion idea of “man,” with all the bag-
gage this interpretation might mean. Although he lived in a world that is quite 
different from ours in mores, technology, and social institutions, not to mention the 
implicit definition of “men” as male, Aristotle’s definition of humanity nevertheless 
includes a formal and comprehensive idea of sociability, which by necessity and 
definition includes communication, symbols, meaning, reason, and emotion. This 
urges us to highlight the human vocation as engaging with others in a meaningful, 
patterned way, emphasizing sociability in particular, as the main way to understand 
humans.
Returning full circle, human sociability is thus the crux of human existence in 
that its regular patterns of interaction, guaranteed by norms and role and reinforced 
by values and symbols, are, in the end, the core of human life. This philosophical 
principle, however, cannot simply be proclaimed in isolation. In stating it, we need 
to both fall back on and project a set of theorems about human interactions and 
human social life. These ultimately suggest that regular, role-based interactions 
with others are the sine qua non—the indispensable ingredient—not just of a good 
human existence but of all human existence.
2.3  Sociability and Structural Differentiation
Classical sociology (Alexander 1982; Levine 1995; Nisbet 1993), which has been 
extended through rigorous theoretical and practical work in modern social psychol-
ogy (Alexander et al. 1987; Hare et al. 1965; Hogg 1992), emphasized the role of 
social differentiation and the emergence of division of labor as essential instruments 
for understanding the evolution of human sociability. From Durkheim (1893) to 
2  Macro-Structural Perspectives on Social Differentiation and Organizational…

25
Bales and Slater (1956), and further through a variety of social scientific studies, 
sociology has delineated a theory of social organization that strongly relies on the 
importance of social roles and social structures for understanding human sociabil-
ity. A simpler way to put it is that sociability, as a broad philosophical concept, 
relies on a conceptual infrastructure. This has, at its core, the idea of social struc-
ture: patterned, predictable interactions that emerge from a given division of labor. 
Here, division of labor expands past the narrow concept of material production, 
entailing any and all human collaborative processes that lead to a finished product, 
material or immaterial (Friedson 1976; Merton 1934).
Any division of labor necessarily implies a process of structural differentiation in 
which certain group members perform certain activities unique to their roles 
(Friedson 1976). The emergence of this role and performative allocation is not 
merely conditioned by formal arrangements; it stems from the natural preconditions 
of effective group work itself. One of these preconditions is that the amount of work 
expended by each individual to monitor other members should be minimized, while 
the amount of work performed that directly contributes to the final production of the 
intended object of the collaboration must be maximized. Groups in which roles are 
poorly differentiated force members to spend a significant amount of time monitor-
ing other members in order to prevent replication of duties or work performed, to 
learn new processes and norms, or to avoid mistakes. In the absence of well-defined 
and distinct roles, individuals also have to ensure that costs and benefits are equita-
bly distributed. As groups increase in size, the amount of information that needs to 
be collected about the other members of the group and about the state of the group 
as a whole increases. Collection and processing time expands. Soon, individuals 
spend more and more time monitoring each other, devoting less and less time to 
working on the task at hand. Thus, a group of undifferentiated collaborators will 
eventually collapse under the weight of its communication and coordination 
demands.
However, as soon as a subset of individuals begins to specialize in communica-
tion and coordination—in other words, as soon as at least two roles emerge, that of 
coordinator and “worker”—groups can again grow without putting undue strain on 
the collaborative process, at least up to a point. Eventually, when the coordinators 
themselves receive so much information that it exceeds their physical processing 
capabilities (natural or augmented by various technologies), the group will again 
stop growing and its efficiency will start to decay. A new round of structural differ-
entiation, by which coordinators specialize in specific functions—some collecting, 
some processing, and some relaying information—can unlock the next horizon of 
organizational growth. Similarly, as workers themselves start to specialize in spe-
cific tasks, which are coordinated by dedicated role-playing individuals, the organi-
zation will begin increasing in sophistication and improving its ability to grow and 
explore new levels of complexity.
Of course, growth has its limits, even when supported by structural differentia-
tion (Blau 1972). As new layers of command, control, and coordination emerge, the 
roles assigned to these functions are connected to the actual work through increas-
ingly extensive and longer chains of command (Blau and Schoenherr 1971). Roles 
2.3  Sociability and Structural Differentiation

26
themselves become ever more autonomous, gaining new identities and missions that 
are sometimes disconnected from the job at hand. In short, especially complex orga-
nizations with multiple layers of command and control tend to place the mission of 
mere organizational preservation and the interests of the roles found at the top of the 
pyramid ahead of the real mission of the organization. Furthermore, as information 
is collected by some roles, processed by others, and disseminated by yet another 
role-playing group, signals become attenuated by noise. Information is inevitably 
lost along the way or, worse yet, cherry-picked in order to support individual needs 
or political ends rather than the goals of the organization (Blau 1970).
Therefore, structural differentiation is not necessarily an absolute, normative 
solution to the requirements of human organization, nor it is infinitely expandable 
(Blau 1970). Yet, for organizations that emerge spontaneously, the path of structural 
differentiation is the one that they follow up to a certain point. We should expect it 
to emerge in most situations where human groups aim to solve a certain task, as 
role-based differentiation provides context for individual work and life.
The debate mentioned so far not only follows in the footsteps of classical sociol-
ogy harkening back to Durkheim, but it is also connected to more recent debates 
about the natural limits of human organization as facilitated by normed roles and 
interaction patterns (Burgers et al. 2009; Cullen et al. 1986; Mayhew et al. 1972). It 
also intersects with Olson’s (1971) ideas about the prerequisites of “collective” 
action and the “free riding problem.” Just like in Olson’s public goods production 
processes, in our research we noticed that online collaboration works well when 
there are selective incentives for the active members. In our case, such incentives are 
a sense of ownership and the intrinsic psychological reward active users get from 
shaping a given online collaborative project. These motivators lead to a production 
system that is driven by a small group of contributors, who have both a higher level 
of investment in and reward from the project, while the rest more or less benefit 
from their work. Our work also intersects with Marwell and Oliver’s (2007) ideas 
on critical mass, which established that a critical mass of dedicated individuals may 
propel social movements and voluntary projects. Like them, we think of this group 
of dedicated individuals as constitutive. We also agree that the critical mass concept 
should not be seen as the mere minimum number of participants, but as the mini-
mum number of active (high contributing) participants needed to jump start a proj-
ect. In other words, the “1% effect” that underlies our argument (the top 1% of users 
effectively shape and are shaped by online collaboration through social differentia-
tion) is closely related to the critical mass argument.
However, our work is not a mere derivation of Olson’s or Marwell and Oliver’s 
prior work. We are not directly interested in the public goods nature of the products 
generated by online groups, as Olson would be, nor in the “production functions” 
that may or may not moderate the self-sustaining chaining-out process of collabora-
tion, which are at the heart of Marwell and Oliver’s work. Instead, we focus on the 
social and communicative dynamics that lead in time to social structuration and 
differentiation. While complementary, this is a distinct problem, with its own 
research questions.
2  Macro-Structural Perspectives on Social Differentiation and Organizational…

27
Our work also intersects with other scholarly debates, especially those that 
emerged around the discussion introduced by Coase (1937) about the nature and 
limits of formal business organizations (Ellickson 1989; Gibbons 1999), as well as 
the debate about the possibility of “peer production” (Benkler 2002).
While these are fascinating topics, our book will not formally or directly engage 
such arguments. Our focus is much more specific. Simply put, we aim to test if 
voluntary knowledge production organizations such as Wikipedia can be seen 
through a structural differentiation perspective, if specific phases can be discerned 
in their life cycles, and if elites emerge while differentiation is ongoing. We also 
investigate the process of organizational change more broadly, proposing a new 
multidimensional perspective for understanding organizational evolution and the 
“motors” that move it forward.
2.4  Online Sociability and Structural Differentiation: 
Connections and Directions of Study
To conclude this overview chapter, it is worthwhile to outline in summary the theo-
retical ideas behind our specific structural differentiation theoretical framework and 
the possible ways in which it can explain knowledge production organizations 
online. In particular, the following pages focus on some core concepts, especially 
sociability, differentiation, and adhocracy.
Since this volume is not one of general theoretical sociology, but one rooted in 
communication research and dedicated to examining specific social groups medi-
ated by technology, sociability needs to be adapted to serve the more immediate 
research context. In that respect, online sociability is the set of generalizable rules 
by which we can describe regularities in online social interactions and communica-
tion. Here, again, we do not take sociability to be an empty tautology by which we 
simply designate what people do in online groups (viz., interacting with other peo-
ple online). To be useful, online sociability needs to account for several factors: low 
barriers of entry and exit, weak pressures to conform and commit, and voluntary 
and natural interactions (Blanchard and Markus 2004; Ciffolilli 2003; Rheingold 
2000).
Online sociability should thus be seen as structured and flexible, hierarchical and 
relatively decentralized, normed and anti-normative, and authoritative while not 
authoritarian. Of course, this only offers a general set of tendencies, thus allowing 
online sociability to take a range of possible forms. Yet, through embracing these 
attributes, online sociability comes to resemble other, more traditional terms, such 
as “adhocracy.” First proposed by Warren Bennis (1968) and further developed by 
Alvin Toffler (1970) and Henry Mintzberg (1979), among others, adhocracy 
describes a form of social organization that supports organically emergent groups in 
which roles are achieved, not prescribed, and in which members enter and leave the 
organization at a certain rate, which is neither very high nor very low. At the same 
2.4  Online Sociability and Structural Differentiation: Connections and Directions…

28
time, adhocracy does allow for roles which, even if temporary, are occupied by 
certain members for a nontrivial period of time. Such roles carry real power, and this 
power has consequences. Similarly, control and communication mechanisms exist 
alongside norms, rules, and enforcement mechanisms, thereby enabling the devel-
opment and application of a power structure based in functional roles. Yet, again, 
adhocratic roles are weakly formed and achieved by completing their attendant obli-
gations, not by formal induction, nomination, or election.
While it is not a new term, we aim to instill adhocracy with sufficient theoretical 
rigor, buttressed with empirical evidence, to justify a new take on an old problem: 
how and within what parameters do new forms of human organization appear?
Within this context, a significant theoretical effort should be made to better cir-
cumscribe the role that elites and leadership groups play in the social context of 
adhocracy. Here, the most important issue is that of articulating the contributions 
that elite groups offer in structuring social groups online. This point is developed in 
the next chapter.

Specifying a Wikipedia-Centric Explanatory 
Model for Online Group Evolution 
and Structural Differentiation
3.1  Introduction
In the previous chapter, we set up the broader sociological underpinnings of our 
argument. This chapter will focus on the more immediate and tangible mechanisms 
that shape the emergence and evolution of social media groups, such as those that 
build Wikipedia. Our theoretical argument will devote particular attention to the 
role played by contributing elites in organizing and sustaining collaborative 
activity.
It is worth noting that the mechanisms described here may transcend specific 
social media, and likewise, there might exist some specific features of particular 
media that do not entirely intersect with our more generalizable propositions. Before 
dealing with these issues, however, one important premise should be declared 
immediately. Some might wonder why Wikipedia is considered a collaborative 
social medium. One could, after all, imagine a knowledge-construction community 
of this sort operating more like a factory, in which work proceeds in the manner of 
an assembly line with minimal interaction between contributors. While some work 
on Wikipedia is indeed completed in isolation, the overall production process is col-
laborative and intensely interactive. Simply put, Wikipedia is an example of col-
laborative social media because its content is contributed by users who engage in 
collaborative practices that extend over long periods of time. Users freely engage 
with one another’s work when editing articles, and they also directly interact with 
one another via open discourse on discussion pages. This collaborative process is a 
prime example of sociability, so Wikipedia must itself be considered a social 
medium.
With that in mind, this chapter provides answers to the following questions: 
How, exactly, do social media groups like Wikipedia come together? Through what 
distinct phases do they progress, if any? Do they create structures and roles for their 
members to fill? How does this matter?

3.2  Volunteering and Social Inequality
Let us start by stating that collaborative online social media groups are, for the most 
part, a species within a broader genre. The larger sociological category in which 
they may be positioned is that of voluntary organizations. These have been present 
in everyday life for a long time, from loosely defined club affiliations to highly 
structured volunteer service organizations such as the famous Lions, Shriners, or 
Kiwanis. Some of the assumptions we currently utilize to explain this larger class of 
organizations should also apply, to a certain extent, to collaborative social media.
Yet at the same time, collaborative social media groups are task-oriented in the 
narrowest sense. Each such group deals with one objective at a time: build a 
Wikipedia article, maintain a conversation or dispute on Reddit, make content viral 
on Twitter, and so forth. Because of this, social media groups also resemble com-
munities of practice (Wenger 1998). Furthermore, online groups, especially when 
they are small, may take a variety of other forms through their functional require-
ments, including that of an entrepreneurial or bureaucratic organization. We will 
expand on this later, especially in Chap. 8.
Whenever individuals join forces to perform a voluntary task, the groups they 
form ultimately split into at least two categories of members: leaders and followers 
(Shafiq et al. 2013). The working mom who takes it upon herself to organize a 
neighborhood watch group, the dad who coaches the local little league baseball 
team, the girl who is the president of the school robotics club, and the boy who 
clocks the most hours volunteering at the local library are all well-known figures 
in local communities that foster volunteer organizations. They stand out not only by 
personal involvement but also by the amount of time and effort they commit to their 
chosen activities.
To make the point clearer, recall that as we noted in Chap. 2, between 2003 and 
2011, the top 20% of all volunteering individuals contributed 50% of the time vol-
unteered in the USA, as calculated from raw data retrieved from the American Time 
Use Survey (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2016). In other words, if you compare the 
top 20% of volunteers against the rest, the average individual in this elite group 
contributed four times as many hours as the average person in the bottom 80%.
This is a significant difference in workload, to be sure. Given this prevalence of 
unequal involvement in volunteer activities in general, it should come as no surprise 
that contributions are also unequal for one of the most gigantic volunteer collabora-
tion projects in the world, Wikipedia. Between 2001 and 2010 (the timeframe of our 
retrospective study), there were 235,701,162 edits made by 22,792,847 unique 
users. 19,680,637 of these accounts consisted of IP addresses attributed to anony-
mous individuals, while the other 3,112,210 were user-created accounts. Logged-in 
users, which represent only 16% of all users, contributed almost twice as many edits 
as their anonymous peers—they were responsible of almost two-thirds (68%) of all 
revisions made to Wikipedia, a clear majority of the workload. Further, if we ana-
lyze contributions not by edits, but by the amount of work estimated by a measure

of effort,1 observed inequality increases dramatically: the top 1% logged-in user 
accounts are responsible for 82% of the effort of all logged-in users. More impor-
tantly, 77% of the effort is produced by the top 1% of users, regardless if they were 
logged in or not.
In brief, when people volunteer their time and effort to work on a group project, 
be it online or offline, they do so at different rates. With that in mind, what explains 
the gap between high-contributing and low-contributing individuals? We propose 
that such inequality is, among other things, a marker of social organization.
3.3  Why Inequality Matters
At the heart of our book lies a simple proposition: the often-observed inequality 
found in everyday interactions online (Barabási 2014; Nielsen 2006; Sauermann 
and Franzoni 2015) is not an accident nor do its origins lie in factors extraneous to 
the online social dynamics. Thus, inequality is neither a triviality to be dismissed 
nor a side effect to be decried. Inequality online is, in fact, closely related to other 
types of collaborative inequalities, many of which are found offline. When com-
pared with the longstanding Pareto principle (80% of something is produced by 
20% of the potential sources), we immediately recognize that online inequalities are 
not very different from the uneven distributions of effort, contributions, rewards, or 
inputs in everyday life (Newman 2005; Pareto 1906). While the proportions differ 
from one situation to the next, and although online groups tend to feature a notice-
ably higher skewness (often more like 90/9/1; see Nielsen 2006), the observed 
inequality is itself not particularly unusual.
As this phenomenon may, at first glance, appear to be an inconsequential statisti-
cal artifact, it demands a parsimonious interpretation that can shed light on its sig-
nificance. We propose that observed inequalities in effort distributions are, at least 
in part, a reflection of the quasi-natural and self-regulatory process of structural 
differentiation in human organizations (Blau 1970).
The relationship between inequality and structural differentiation can be estab-
lished at several levels. First, as discussed in the previous chapter, larger groups 
impose higher coordination and control costs on individual members if they are all 
to perform their respective activities by themselves, in isolation. As soon as indi-
viduals assume differentiated roles, some of them focusing more on communication 
and coordination or on setting expectations for the general effort, the group struc-
tures itself and work distribution becomes more efficient.
Furthermore, it is not even essential to have a subgroup of members engage in 
explicit coordination and control activities. It is sufficient for some individuals to 
work more than their peers. As a comparatively larger amount of effective and use-
ful work is done by fewer individuals, the group of contributors who matter shrinks, 
and with it, the need for coordination and control also declines, as most work is

34
done within a rather narrow circle. In fact, this is probably what we witness on 
Wikipedia and other large-scale online production systems in which effective col-
laborative processes are maintained over time with minimal explicit coordination or 
control—there is little need for extensive mechanisms to serve these purposes if the 
circle of significant contributors is small.
Given these assumptions, we should acknowledge that the process of peer pro-
duction, as it is called in some quarters, is a complex one whose understanding 
demands multiple analytic perspectives. The summary offered by Benkler et al. 
(2015) provides a good overview of the problem space. One of the core conclusions 
of this overview is that peer production has drifted at least conceptually, if not in 
actual practice, away from a vision of locally coordinated, horizontally distributed 
tasks. This notion has been supplanted by a more complex and realistic explanatory 
framework that takes into account the fact that leaders in collaborative spaces lead 
by doing more and by staking out specific territories, which they de facto, if not de 
jure, take into ownership (Arazy et al. 2015).
Much of the research on collaborative inequality has been dedicated not only to 
theoretical explanations of online interaction and collaboration phenomena, but also 
to their practical implications, especially those related to growth and recruitment 
(Halfaker et al. 2012). The concerns appear to be legitimate, as some sites, including 
Wikipedia, have seen slower growth in recent years. Yet, the worries might not be so 
legitimate if we consider that online social spaces may follow an evolutionary pro-
cess with an upper limit for growth. Expectations of linear growth are not always 
warranted, especially after social groups go through a period of structural differen-
tiation, eventually reaching a plateau of patterned interaction and role allocation. As 
we suggest below, interaction and inequality on Wikipedia actually reached this 
level quite soon after launch, so it has therefore been in a state of quasi-equilibrium 
for quite some time, especially in terms of the structural differentiation and contri-
bution inequality within the collaborative effort.
3.4  Social Roles and Structural Differentiation
Speaking about inequality, how should we translate it in a more direct and intuitive 
manner using the language of structural differentiation? At its very core, the idea 
suggests that as voluntary groups grow, some members tend to assume leading posi-
tions based on the amount and type of work they perform (Preece and Shneiderman 
2009). This is nothing new, as Welser et al. (2011) as well as, more recently, Arazy 
et al. (2015) proposed specific sets of roles defined by substantive, technical, and 
communication attributes. While these roles involve both qualitative (what) and 
quantitative (how much) descriptions of the work being done, in what follows, we 
will focus on the quantitative differentiation of leaders from the rest of the group.
From our perspective, leaders are those who lead by example (Plowman et al. 
2007). By doing so, leaders implicitly become anchor points for everybody else’s 
work. A recent, path-breaking study by Muchnik and collaborators showed quite 
3  Specifying a Wikipedia-Centric Explanatory Model… 

35
convincingly that there is a direct connection between ranking in the “head” of a 
power-law distribution of effort on Wikipedia and the extensiveness of one’s work 
and communicative connections (Muchnik et al. 2013). The probability that an ordi-
nary, less involved collaborator will touch upon a top contributor’s work increases 
quite substantially as collaborative inequality increases. Consequently, top contrib-
utors act as driving forces that shape the mores, norms, and standards of the col-
laborative community. Furthermore, leaders stake out areas of interest, which they 
then “shepherd” (Halfaker et al. 2009). This personal stake in their respective slices 
of the community and the resulting product provides top contributors with an extra 
motivation to contribute, which further accentuates the uneven distribution of effort 
while giving the leaders the feeling of literally being in control of the process 
(Panciera et al. 2009).
The net outcome of leading by doing more is the tendency of groups to self-­
organize. This organization includes both formal and informal roles (Blau 1977). 
On Wikipedia, editors are often given badges or “barnstars” to signify their leading 
positions on the project (Kriplean et al. 2008). These signs of recognition along with 
subtler interactional cues, such as participation in discussions on “talk” pages,2 may 
also help a user become a formal “admin” through election by his or her peers. Such 
users have the power to close certain articles to editing, for example, or to partici-
pate in procedures that may even lead to banning other users. Thus, in some cases, 
the unspoken, informal leadership roles that members adopt are eventually con-
verted into formal leadership positions.
Yet—and this is a critical caveat—informal roles, which we also call “functional 
roles” (Arazy et al. 2015), are the defining social roles that make Wikipedia and 
other online voluntary organizations work. These informal roles are carved out by 
doing and by working more and harder than everybody else. Such roles inform the 
formal administrative hierarchy and are, in fact, a precondition for official advance-
ment. As such, the informal roles are those that tend to matter most.
In previous work (Matei et al. 2015), we have developed this argument more 
formally for Wikipedia. In the text that follows, we reiterate some of those ideas as 
scaffolding for the present, broader investigation, which more strongly emphasizes 
the role of structural differentiation in the evolutionary process of social media 
spaces. For more information on the growing literature on Wikipedia, see Jullien 
(2012).
In the past, collaborative inequality was explained through individual motiva-
tions and abilities (Javanmardi et al. 2011; Nov 2007). In more recent work, how-
ever, Welser et al. (2011) and Arazy and Nov (2010) suggested that this inequality 
might also reflect a tendency toward role specialization. We pursue this insight fur-
ther, although via our own structural differentiation perspective, which is not explic-
itly present in the previous literature. In this respect, we tend closer to the theoretical 
arguments of Blau (1970), Mintzberg (1979), and Bales and Slater (1956). The lat-
ter is particularly important, as Bales’ research on small groups showed that the

can discuss the editorial process.
3.4  Social Roles and Structural Differentiation

36
emergence of functional leaders—those who lead by doing—is a constant process 
in all spontaneous organizations.
These early insights are cross-pollinated with Wenger’s (1998) proposition that 
organically emerging organizations, such as communities of practice that are cre-
ated by free association, follow an evolutionary path that can be divided into distinct 
phases. Communities of practice in particular, and voluntary organizations with 
explicit collaborative goals more generally, typically emerge through a four-stage 
process (Fig. 3.1).
The first stage is that of incubation or gathering potential. Participants discover 
their own abilities, resources, skills, and capacity to collaborate, as well as those of 
the group itself. This is a period of numerous and, at times, momentous shifts in 
technologies, rules, strategies, commitment, amount of time spent on the project, 
and member-to-member interactions. The distribution of effort may likewise shift 
quickly and dramatically, from relatively even to extremely uneven.
In the second phase, coalescence, participants start orienting toward each other, 
with some individuals assuming increasingly large shares of effort. The collabora-
tion develops such that it can be defined as a space that encompasses clearly distin-
guishable “in” (high-effort) and “out” (lower commitment) members.
The third phase is that of maturing. At this point, interactions between members 
and expectations of effort, especially those of longtime members, consolidate. 
Collaboration becomes routinized, with high-effort members contributing much of 
the content and consequently shaping the overall collaborative process and 
product.

37
Finally, there is the fourth phase, stabilization, during which the leaders take a 
step back. This is also known as the “stewardship” period. While the leaders still 
dominate the work effort itself by almost an order of magnitude, they also dedicate 
some of their time to other tasks, including control, coordination, and adjudication 
of conflicts. The change of focus allows the other members of the project to increase, 
in relative and limited terms, their share of the effort. The stabilization period is, as 
the label suggests, one in which we may observe a relatively stable, albeit skewed, 
level in distribution of effort. Once matured, the group maintains the distribution of 
effort between the top contributors and everybody else at a highly skewed level, 
which replicates itself in successive periods. This is the phase in which we may say 
that structural differentiation has reached its maximum potential.
Notably, most communities of practice and voluntary associations do not persist 
in the “stabilization” phase forever. Cohort or cultural changes introduced by social 
contact with other projects or induced by social context pressures may draw some 
members away from the project or may change the characteristics and goals of the 
members. When this happens, some organizations enter a period of dramatic trans-
formation that results in either organizational identity change or splintering. 
Importantly, those organizations that resist change or otherwise fail to transform 
upon exiting the stabilization phase instead slowly decline and die.
The phase approach to organizational evolution and growth is extremely impor-
tant for detecting changes in the structural differentiation process.3 The reverse is 
likewise true, as any detectable changes in structural differentiation may indicate 
that the group has entered a new phase of activity. The main challenge is to identify 
a measure that meaningfully aligns changes in distribution of effort or contributions 
with claims of structural differentiation. We achieve this by using social entropy as 
a core measure, as we will discuss below and in later chapters.
The goal of uncovering phases in activity over time demands a method to detect 
boundaries in the evolutionary process (Cummings and Worley 2014; Lewin 1947). 
These are points of inflection in the trajectory of the measurable indicator of uneven 
contributions (or, perhaps, alternative indicators representing other collaborative 
dynamics, as will be discussed in Chap. 7). Contribution unevenness is interpreted 
as a sign of social structuration that may be expressed as social entropy (O’Connor 
1991), whereas an evolutionary boundary is defined as a statistically measurable 
shift in entropy (Leydesdorff 2002).4 Such boundaries are indicators of social move-
ment toward or away from social structuration. As we trace the evolution of struc-
tural differentiation and its discrete phases, we effectively map the “embryology” of 
the collaborative space. This is a core contribution of this volume and of the research 
agenda that made it possible.
3 We borrow the idea of phased development mostly from Wegner, as indicated above. Yet, there are 
other views, such as those of Tushman and Romanelli (2008), which can also be taken into account. 
Our view, in distinction to Tushman and Romanelli, who proposed a punctuated equilibrium per-
spective, takes a more incremental approach to phase transitions.
4 The cited paper refers to informal scientific groups, which is highly relevant for this context.
3.4  Social Roles and Structural Differentiation

38
With all of that said, a mere change in the entropy indicator is not sufficient rea-
son to make the claim that an evolutionary phase has started or ended. Detectable 
changes in social differentiation and social aggregation via measurements of contri-
bution inequality need to be validated through a second, dependent measure, which 
demonstrates that any observed inequality is the product of a quasi-stable elite 
group consistently contributing more than the rest of the community, rather than an 
artifact merely resulting from members taking turns in making contributions and 
rotating into and out of arbitrarily defined “elite” positions (Dellarocas et al. 2014).
To put it another way, we are keenly aware of the possibility that a group that is 
uneven in contributions can be open or closed. The roster of top contributors may 
have a constant composition over time, with a particular group of individuals per-
petually participating and occupying leadership positions. Alternatively, it may 
instead be that the “top contributors” are continuously refreshed with new recruits 
such that a wide range of members periodically ascend into and descend from the 
highest ranks, as in a game of “musical chairs.”
In the former scenario, the group is closed. In the latter, it is open. When an open 
group displays high contribution inequality, this can simply reflect the fact that not 
all members can sustain high levels of contribution all the time. Members of the 
group may distribute their efforts in time, with some of them working more during 
certain intervals and less during others. Thus, while during any given interval it 
would appear that the group is dramatically divided into high- and low-productivity 
members, contributions over time may, in fact, even out.
However, if we concurrently observe uneven processes and “elite stickiness,” 
wherein members of the elite group tend to remain in an elite role for a prolonged 
period, and if we can determine that unevenness precedes this observed stickiness, 
we may conclude that the phases and phase shifts in the collaborative unevenness 
measure (entropy) are indeed the product of structural differentiation.
A key element of this type of analysis, and the associated theories that drive it, is 
the specific manner in which we conceptualize social structuration and structural 
differentiation. In Chap. 4, we elaborate on the idea of structural differentiation as a 
non-entropic phenomenon. The reasons and articulations of this concept are pre-
sented there in more detail. For the sake of immediate clarity and the continuity of 
this argument, however, it is at least worth reiterating that our argument rests, in 
large part, on the assumption that uneven distributions can be characterized by a 
social entropy measure which indicates whether or not the uneven collaborative 
process is evidence of a meaningful social structure.
In this respect, we take our cue from Shannon and Weaver (1948), who proposed 
an entropy-derived measure to characterize a process that is intrinsic to human phe-
nomena, namely, communication. Shannon and Weaver made the claim, which was 
later substantiated, that an even occurrence of symbols in a communicative system 
betrays a state of randomness and entropy. Such systems, when observed, are inher-
ently disorganized, noisy, and lacking meaningful signals. In such systems informa-
tion is minimal or absent. At the same time, when certain symbols of a communication 
system occur more often than others, beyond a rate that chance alone would predict, 
meaningful information and signals are more likely to be present. In this state, the 
3  Specifying a Wikipedia-Centric Explanatory Model… 

39
system as a whole is more likely to be “structured.” More recent literature, including 
trade publications, revived this insight, expanding it to a more comprehensive view 
of reality as an information-based system (Seife 2007).
We take this insight to the next level (Bailey 1990), applying the logic of this 
communication-based analysis to social phenomena in the manner suggested by 
Osgood and Wilson (1961). Social systems, which are similar to and overlap with 
communication systems, are comprised of elements (individuals) that are in various 
states of presence within a range of contexts: collaborative, communicative, interac-
tive, persuasive, and so forth. When all individuals are in the same state of presence 
(i.e., they collaborate in the same proportion, talk the same amount, interact at the 
same rate, etc.), the social system is more or less random and disorganized, as 
everybody is doing the same things at the same rate and no leaders are emerging to 
guide any component of the interaction. On the other hand, when some individuals 
are more present than others, whether through communication or other types of 
behavior, the system starts displaying signs of organization. This insight is not spec-
ulative. It relies on well-established theoretical ideas within communication and 
sociology (Backstrom et al. 2006; Georgescu-Rogen 1971; Schramm 1955).
In this context, Osgood and Wilson’s (1961) insights are particularly germane. In 
their groundbreaking but almost forgotten text, Some terms and associated mea-
sures for talking about communication, they argue that the degree of structuration 
or organization of a communicative and social system is the inverse of its level of 
uncertainty. According to them, “uncertainty is a characteristic of a system which 
increases with the number of its states and the degree to which these states occur 
with equal frequency or probability” (2). Uncertainty maps onto entropy, and in this 
respect, even or random states are, in effect, uncertain states.
At the same time, we must emphasize that while uneven distributions suggest the 
presence of social structures, the structures themselves might not be static, mono-
lithic social orders. Individuals who are at the top of the functional hierarchy are not 
necessarily their rulers. Neither do they wield absolute directive control over the 
community. Leadership is, again, defined in terms of what one does. One’s role as a 
leader lasts only as long as the individual works harder than everybody else. 
Likewise, competing leaders, with competing roles, might exist.
When taking all of this into account, we can anticipate a certain amount of lead-
ership turnover. In this text, we report our measurements of this turnover, which we 
use to more accurately assess the level of relative elite resilience (“stickiness”) and 
to discern whether it represents a form of leadership that could be called “adho-
cratic” or “just-in-time leadership.” Adhocracy, as a term, was first popularized to 
the public by Toffler (1970), and Mintzberg (1979), Van de Ven and Poole (1995), 
and Waterman (1993) directly and indirectly refined it through their explicit and 
implicit intellectual theorizing about organizational structures. For now, we may 
defer to a more concise definition offered by the Oxford Dictionary of the Internet 
(Ince 2009), which states that an adhocratic organization is one “that does not rely 
on job descriptions, hierarchy, standards, and procedures; rather, workers in the 
company carry out tasks because they need to be done.”
3.4  Social Roles and Structural Differentiation

40
Adhocracies encourage members and teams to aggregate and disperse according 
to need. While individuals do have some roles to play, these roles are not permanent. 
An adhocratic order is a type of organic structure within which ties of dependence 
and collaboration exist. Yet, interpersonal connections and the structure itself are 
flexible. Leaders may, at times, be quite distant from the rest of the group in terms 
of collaboration, yet this is all temporary and liable to change, as leaders depart for 
periods of time and new leaders constantly emerge.
In terms of operationalization, adhocracy can be conceptualized in several ways. 
In this book, adhocracy is considered to be both a broader framework and a specific 
organizational configuration. As a framework, adhocracy refers to situations in 
which the elite group’s composition is both changing and resilient. In more specific 
terms, adhocracy is an organizational configuration. As such, it is described as a 
multidimensional phenomenon, which can be measured in terms of its network or 
organizational form.
In Part I of this volume, we look at adhocracy through the first lens—that of elite 
churn—which we may describe in more vernacular terms as the “stickiness” of elite 
members. We take a dynamic approach, addressing the manner in which changes in 
stickiness, or increases and decreases in turnover rates among members of the elite 
group, are associated with changes in structuration (entropy). In other words, we 
determine whether decreasing entropy is associated with a decrease in elite 
turnover.
In Part II, we return to the concept of adhocracy, describing it as one of several 
possible organizational configurations. This portion of the text examines adhocracy 
through the perspective of entropy (structuration) and four other collaborative fac-
tors: collaborative attractiveness, collaborative extroversion, communication flows, 
and partner choice.
Returning, for the moment, to the first part of the analysis, recall that the inverse 
of entropy is order. Therefore, the lower the entropy and the greater the structura-
tion, the more likely adhocracy may be to consolidate and become a quasi-stable 
form of leadership. To think of it in other terms, if the system becomes more stable 
and predictable because an elite group becomes increasingly dominant over time, 
then it stands to reason that those highly productive members who would be consid-
ered elite are likely to maintain their stable positions over a long duration. Yet, this 
resilience over time is not absolute. On the contrary, elite stickiness is temporally 
limited, a conjecture that is addressed at length in the chapters to come.
3.5  Research Questions
Given these premises, our first primary mission is to investigate the evolution of 
structuration over time and to determine the inflection points in its evolution, in 
order to pinpoint any discrete phases that are specific to adhocratic communities of 
practice.

41
In formal terms, we propose an evolutionary model for detecting the emergence of 
functional roles and of adhocratic leadership mechanisms. The temporal dependency 
between elite stickiness and system inequality, which offers evidence of a causal rela-
tionship, must first be assessed. We then examine how “sticky” the elites are in distinct 
periods of organizational development and, as levels of inequality increase, whether 
members of the elite are indeed more likely to linger in high contributor positions, as 
suggested above. Finally, we evaluate the direction of this temporal relationship—that 
is, whether increasing stickiness precedes growing inequality or vice versa.
After connecting stickiness to group structuration as described above, we subse-
quently examine the extent to which promotion to elite status is conditional on one’s 
collaborative connections to existing members of the elite. Two scenarios are pos-
sible. Collaboration with members of the existing elite may contribute toward even-
tually being counted among their ranks, or ascension to elite status may be the 
product of one’s own efforts regardless of interpersonal connections. The first sce-
nario is more common in everyday, bureaucratic, or otherwise hierarchical organiza-
tional configurations, while the second would suggest an adhocratic configuration.
The explanatory mechanism proposed above is encapsulated by the following 
five research questions, which will offer the first in-depth exploration of the emer-
gence of adhocracy on Wikipedia:
	1.	 Is there a distinct group of highly productive (elite) users on Wikipedia, and if so, 
to what extent do they dominate contributions to the project over time?
	2.	 What is the social mobility (or its inverse, elite “stickiness”) of functional lead-
ers on Wikipedia over time?
	3.	 Are there distinct growth phases determined by the emergence of functional 
leaders in Wikipedia’s first 9 years of existence (2001–2010)?
	4.	 What is the relationship between global inequality, or social structuration, and 
elite stickiness?
	5.	 Is promotion to the elite group a function of prior interactions with elites?
Before presenting the data analysis that was used to answer the questions above, 
we would like to expand some more on the topic of entropy and its use as a measure 
for social structuration, as this is an essential component of our approach that 
deserves in-depth attention. Therefore, the next chapter is dedicated to this theoreti-
cal topic. Readers already familiar with Shannon’s work may skip that chapter and 
proceed directly to the analysis in Chap. 5.

Social Structuration Online: Entropy 
and Social Systems
4.1  Introduction
One of the most important goals of the present volume is to define and relate group 
structuration to other online organizational and interactional phenomena. Although 
structuration is a high-level concept that may hold different meanings for different 
people, within this research, the concept is quite simple and clear. In brief, structura-
tion is equated with the concept of “signal” in information systems, as defined by 
Shannon and Weaver (1948). Structuration is meaningful order, so by Shannon’s 
logic, structure is the opposite of entropy. Since structure is measured using entropy, 
we may say that structure increases as the observed value of entropy decreases. 
Conceptually, this means that structure is captured in the negative by observing the 
degree to which the system is not random (noisy or disordered).
Shannon’s fundamental insight in the information sciences—a simple formula 
and metric (entropy) that can be used to measure the presence of order and 
­meaning—is extended in this volume to social phenomena. How do we propose to 
do this? In the following text, we outline our method in detail.1 For readers familiar 
with Shannon’s work and his use of entropy to define and measure order in informa-
tion systems, this chapter might cover known territory. However, its role is not to 
merely state the obvious, but to advance the conversation from communication and 
information processing to social phenomena as a whole. In this respect, it is an 
essential step in our argument.
The use of entropy to detect social structuration in online groups may strike some 
as counterintuitive, as our approach is premised on the assumption that structuration 
appears when some elements, behaviors, symbols, or actors in a system are more 
likely to be present or to interact than others. This contradicts some earlier notions 
about online environments, which were viewed in an idealistic light and promoted 
on the basis of doing precisely the opposite: namely, equalizing interaction rates via

the uniquely egalitarian capabilities of computer-mediated communication. To put 
it another way, online interaction has often been seen as a panacea for real-world 
inequalities, as the social order exhibited in online media was supposed to be more 
egalitarian, more even, and more interactive (Berman and Weitzer 1997; Braman 
1994; Kiesler et al. 1984; Licklider and Taylor 1968; Rheingold 2000; Sclove 1995; 
Sproull and Kiesler 1991).
This egalitarianism was premised on a number of characteristics considered to be 
intrinsic to online communication technologies, the most important of which was 
the functional equality of the nodes, human or technological, which constitute any 
computer network (Hauben 1996). This assumption naturally led the first generation 
of Internet and new media researchers to believe that online groups might exhibit 
egalitarian characteristics (Hiltz 1984; Hiltz and Turoff 1978; Kiesler and Sproull 
1992). Many further felt that the assumed and quasi-necessary equality of online 
social systems would hinder or even prevent majorities from becoming tyrannical 
(Grossman 1995; Hiltz and Turoff 1978) and that the egalitarian nature of the 
medium would create new avenues for expressing non-mainstream views (Myers 
1987; Turkle 1995).
Within this set of interlocked expectations was something akin to a Holy Grail of 
collaboration: a method for producing rich and diverse knowledge that grows out of 
the egalitarian efforts of the many, including the ignored, marginalized, and nonin-
volved voices. This utopian view was intensely and broadly popularized through 
books such as The Wisdom of the Crowds (Surowiecki 2004), Out of Control (Kelly 
1995), The Wealth of Networks (Benkler 2006), and Emergence (Johnson 2001).
However, over the past two decades, it has become increasingly apparent that 
online social groups, including those defined by the latest wave of social media, are 
in fact quite skewed, with a few contributors responsible for a sizable majority of 
contributions. This observation clashes, at least in relative if not absolute terms, 
with the equality that commentators expected to observe. As such, most reflections 
on such findings have tended to explain them away rather than to deal with inequal-
ity as a widely recurring, unavoidable fact. In general, the early literature simply 
avoided confronting the issue of inequality on its own territory as a constitutive and 
generative phenomenon. Although methods for characterizing inequality and diver-
sity in online environments were present in earlier research, they were used only 
episodically and as “pass-through” mechanisms to address other, unrelated issues; 
the existence of inequality itself was typically viewed as a nonessential by-product 
(Kittur et al. 2009).
In brief, until recently (Shaw and Hill 2014), inequality and its measurement were 
not considered to be central, significant issues warranting in-depth investigation in 
their own right. By largely neglecting this matter, researchers have unwittingly 
neglected decades-old studies on uneven distributions in a variety of domains related 
to communication, from programming and agenda-setting (Chaffee and Wilson 
1977; Dominick and Pearce 1976) to some of Osgood and Wilson’s (1961) and 
Schramm’s (1955) polymath considerations about entropy as a communicative phe-
nomenon. By neglecting the inequality of distributions in social phenomena, we 
have lost an important point of purchase, not only in the conversation about equality 
4  Social Structuration Online: Entropy and Social Systems

47
but also in the more significant discussion about the relationship between equal dis-
tributions, randomness, entropy, and structuration. This is particularly important 
when considering online communication, where we have yet to directly and objec-
tively engage structuration and inequality as related system-level phenomena.
In the present volume, we restart this conversation, illustrating how and why 
online inequality should be a focal point for further study. Inequality, within certain 
limits, is more than a side effect or a statistical artifact. Rather, it betrays important 
constitutive phenomena that reveal the mechanisms through which online groups, 
and social groups more generally, structure themselves.
4.2  Diversity and Social Entropy: A Neglected Tradition
Outside of the communication sciences, the process of characterizing and quantify-
ing a system by assessing how evenly (or randomly) its elements or states are dis-
tributed is a relatively mature theoretical and methodological concern (Seife 2007). 
In physics, for instance, this probabilistic approach is fundamental for understand-
ing system behavior. In this context, entropy is largely used as a measure of system 
organization or, in other cases, of uncertainty.
The concept was introduced to the social sciences relatively early by Shannon 
and Weaver (1948), who proposed “entropy” as a central measure of information 
systems and, therefore, of information itself. It should be remembered that Shannon 
was, in fact, the scholar responsible for setting information theory on sound meth-
odological grounds, rigorously defining the construct of information and associat-
ing it with the nonrandom states of the symbols or carriers in a communication 
system. For Shannon, communicative acts that carry meaning were characterized by 
two factors: redundancy and organization. The lower the level of randomness in a 
given communication act and, therefore, the higher the degree of order, the more 
likely that act is to carry meaning. In other words, the act of communication can be 
characterized as “information” or as a “signal” that is distinguishable from mean-
ingless “noise.” This is a crucial insight, since Shannon’s conceptualization explic-
itly equates order with nonrandomness.
As mentioned, Shannon and Weaver borrowed the conceptual and mathematical 
tools needed to describe information load, and by extension the organization of a 
communicative system, from physics, where the presence or absence of order in a 
system is termed its level of “entropy.” This construct measures how diverse a sys-
tem is in terms of its constitutive elements. When the elements are present in an 
equal proportion, they present a maximum level of diversity, so the system is said to 
have a high level of entropy. When the elements are imbalanced such that some are 
more prevalent than others, diversity and therefore entropy are low, and we would 
say that the system is “ordered.”
Intuitively, a gallon of water, in which the molecules float freely, each being able 
to occupy any location in the container, is less organized (and has higher entropy) 
than the same gallon of water frozen into an ice cube, in which each molecule is 
4.2  Diversity and Social Entropy: A Neglected Tradition

48
bound to a certain spot in the crystalline structure of the frozen water. Therefore, we 
may think of ice crystals as organized water, so we would characterize ice as having 
a lower level of entropy than liquid water. This is both metaphorically and scientifi-
cally true. Chemistry and physics have, in fact, articulated this idea as the “entropy 
of fusion”: melting a substance always involves an increase in entropy.
With that said, entropy in social systems is defined not as a physical but as a 
socio-communicative concept, so it requires a modified interpretation. We start 
from the same idea: disorganized systems are random, so by the logic of probabili-
ties, their elements are more likely to be in the same states as one another. If these 
elements are people or symbols, systems that distribute them equally are disorga-
nized. Imagine, for instance, a message in which all possible symbols are equally 
likely to occur. This message is more likely to be nonsensical because it appears 
(and typically is) disorganized. A text that uses “a” and “z” with equal frequency is 
probably garbage since there are very few words that include the letter “z.”
When observing social systems, if we detect a situation in which all individuals 
communicate at the same rate, it probably means that they are communicating to no 
one in particular or that they are communicating only to themselves. Why is this so? 
Consider the following. The members of a group start talking about a given topic. 
However, they cannot all talk at the same time. A true communication act requires 
at least two partners, one of whom should keep quiet. Thus, when a group’s mem-
bers engage in communication among one another, no more than half of their poten-
tial to “send” raw communication can be realized at any given moment. Further, if 
we take sending potential to be similar to “raw communicative potential,” we realize 
that a true act of communication is maximized socially when this potential is only 
partially realized individually.
As a consequence, when a group is communicating, the degree to which its 
members send information—and, therefore, their raw communication rates—can-
not be absolutely even at any moment. A snapshot of a true communication process 
at any given moment will reveal an imbalanced communication process. Some talk, 
while others listen. If we focus on sending alone, and if we consider a hypothetical 
situation where communication is dyadic and the sending rates among the members 
that speak relatively equal, the unevenness of communication would be at least 50% 
greater than what chance alone would predict. In other words, the entropy of com-
munication should be at least half of the maximum possible value that can be 
obtained when everybody communicates equally.
The lesson here is that absolute egalitarianism is hardly the ideal state for col-
laboration. Rather, not only is it unrealistic, but it is essentially impossible if any 
actual communicative and collaborative work is to occur. Social systems demand a 
degree of structural order in order to function, so a degree of role differentiation—
even if those roles are as simple as “talkers” and “listeners”—is an essential prereq-
uisite and one that will inevitably preclude the egalitarianism that some would 
naïvely prefer to pursue. Without such differentiation, we are left with nothing more 
than a cluster of people talking to themselves. If everyone is a “talker,” then no one 
is listening.
4  Social Structuration Online: Entropy and Social Systems

49
All told, a perfectly equal distribution of anything in human or communicative 
affairs betrays not the presence but the absence of order, which has numerous practi-
cal implications. Furthermore, by using a mathematical measure of distribution 
such as entropy, we can determine at a glance whether or not a system is organized. 
By extension, taking multiple measurements allows us to directly observe whether 
the system is growing more or less organized over time.
Yet, scholars of communication, sociology, and other related fields have 
neglected the potential benefits and implications of employing the entropy concept. 
In their absence, scientists in other disciplines have more deeply explored the issues 
of diversity and entropy, developing very sophisticated statistical methods for iden-
tifying their magnitude within a given context and for assessing their comparability 
between systems. Economics, geography, and environmental sciences are just a 
few of the disciplines that have modified and refined the concept of entropy to their 
own ends (McDonald and Dimmick 2003), with examples including adaptations of 
the entropy measure to describe the degree of organization or diversity of firms, 
species, features, etc. in a given population, geographic area, or society (Maignan 
et al. 2003).
These methods and the theoretical implications of their conceptualization, both 
of which will be discussed later in this chapter, are now ripe to be incorporated in 
the communication discipline, especially among those researchers focusing on the 
emergence and impact of new online communication environments. Communication 
technologies present an especially great need to measure and understand entropy 
and its opposite order. After all, online environments are widely considered to be 
intrinsically egalitarian, and by a leap of “sociological imagination,” one may be 
tempted to think that online order is or should be driven by equality. Axiological 
ideals are thus extended to ontological realities: the value expectation that egalitari-
anism should prevail in online collaboration and communication extends a moral 
ideal to an alternative vision for creating social order and social coordination 
(Johnson 2001; Rheingold 2002).
Online environments are generally believed, especially by several key early 
observers, to have the ability to self-organize and to create “emergent” orders pre-
cisely because all participants are equal. The idea posed is that individual actors 
within a system are no different than neurons within the brain, so the “hive mind” 
of users adopts whatever order is necessary at a given moment in time rather than 
adhering to an arbitrarily imposed hierarchy (Johnson 2001). Here, the presupposi-
tion is that egalitarianism is not only a normative ideal but also one demanded by 
efficiency. The more decentralized and egalitarian the interaction and the more mas-
sive the collaboration, the argument goes, the more likely the online systems are to 
generate solutions that hierarchical, top-down methods of control and coordination 
could not (Raymond 2001). Yet these claims cannot be verified and the nature of 
these phenomena cannot be understood until we improve our measurement of the 
evolution of collaborative organization over time, thereby allowing us to ascertain 
whether increased egalitarianism is desirable or even, for that matter, feasible.
As collaborative communication environments have become mainstream tools, 
and as researchers have increasingly relied upon presuppositions of social structure

50
rather than objective data, the low awareness (and, in some circles, the total lack of 
acknowledgment) of online structuration measures that employ entropy has become 
more and more glaring, and the need to redress this situation has grown increasingly 
urgent. Any possible first step toward resolving our lack of concepts and tools to 
understand structuration must involve some methodological strategies and theoreti-
cal principles that can be jointly used to operationalize, measure, and understand 
entropy in online collaborative and communication environments.
To illustrate the practical implications of our argument, we will discuss the col-
laborative diversity issues raised by one of the most intriguing technologies that 
have emerged in the field of online collaboration, Wikipedia. We will illustrate our 
main points about the utility and operationalization of entropy with a number of 
examples related to this online project. These examples function not only as a self-­
contained conversation, but more importantly, they set the stage for our more in-­
depth study of the project’s structuration over time, of its adhocratic organizational 
strategies, and of the emergent online social phenomena that these processes bring 
to light.
To illustrate our main points about using entropy in the study of online environ-
ments, we start by providing a brief overview of Wikipedia’s inner workings, which 
will serve as our main research laboratory. This will be followed by a discussion 
about some specific methodological and theoretical avenues related to diversity and 
entropy. We will conclude with an example of how these principles and methodolo-
gies can be used in practice for measuring collaborative diversity and entropy on 
Wikipedia over time, with the implications derived from this example yielding 
important insights for future research on online collaborative environments.
4.3  Wikipedia
One of the most significant technologies that have emerged in the last several years 
is Wikipedia, an online collaborative encyclopedia created outside of traditional 
authorship, editorial, and copyright constraints, which is built around the very idea 
of equality and diversity of contributions. As an “open content” repository of ency-
clopedic knowledge, Wikipedia was designed from its foundations as a collective 
and distributed effort (Lih 2009; Wikipedia 2016a).
Akin to the open source software movement, described in the famous essay “The 
Cathedral and the Bazaar” (Raymond 2001), Wikipedia relies, as its name suggests, 
on the wiki publishing paradigm (Leuf and Cunningham 2001). Wikis2 are web-­
based collective and nondirected online publication systems shaped on the model of 
the Portland Pattern Repository. The first wiki repository, launched by programmer 
Ward Cunningham in 1995, served as a historical record of computer programming 
ideas. Like other wiki systems that followed, Ward’s wiki used an open web-based

can be implemented (Cunningham 2005).

editing interface, which allowed any visitor to the website to add, delete, and pub-
lish content at will.
The wiki idea was transferred from computer programming to knowledge pro-
duction in 2000, as an attempt to improve the editorial process of an online peer-­
reviewed encyclopedia (Nupedia). Although the peer-reviewed expectations limited 
the Nupedia project, it laid the groundwork for Wikipedia, which was founded by 
Jimmy Wales, a businessman with a Master’s degree in economics, and by Larry 
Sanger, an academic philosopher. While Nupedia ceased operation in 2003 after 
having produced only 25 peer-reviewed articles, Wikipedia has experienced explo-
sive growth: as of 2016, Wikipedia has tens of millions of contributors who have 
jointly developed over five million articles in English alone, in addition to those in 
over 100 other languages (Wikipedia 2016c).
Wikipedia’s simple web interface allows any visitor to read and, if he or she 
disagrees or finds the content inaccurate or insufficient, to immediately alter or 
change its entries (Wikipedia 2017b). The edits are subjected only to limited edito-
rial gatekeeping. For some articles, a Wikipedia member must be registered for a 
number of days before her or his changes will be immediately accepted by the sys-
tem. The vast majority of articles, however, may be freely edited, even by unregis-
tered users.
As for the editorial process itself, on each entry page, there is an “edit” button; 
when pressed, it switches the page from “display” to “edit” mode. The reader can 
then make any desired changes immediately, and, for most pages, this means that 
alterations are recorded almost instantaneously. In fact, initially, all Wikipedia arti-
cles could initially be edited with no restriction. However, several incidents—most 
notably that of John Seigenthaler, a former Robert Kennedy aide who was falsely 
accused on Wikipedia of participating in the conspiracy that killed his former 
employer (Seigenthaler 2005)—necessitated the invocation of a “protection” policy 
(Hafner 2006) for some high-profile pages, such as those dedicated to George 
W.  Bush, Jesus, or Adolf Hitler, which are among the most controversial on 
Wikipedia (Goodfellow 2016; Wikipedia 2017a). This means that only administra-
tors and selected users can edit “protected” articles. Again, however, most articles 
are editable by any user, even those who have not registered an account on Wikipedia. 
Those individuals who do register and complete nominal editorial work gain even 
more leeway in editing the site.
Despite newer policies facilitating article protection, the Wikipedia editorial sys-
tem remains relatively open. The idea is still to make any reader into a coauthor of 
the Wikipedia project and, when possible, to give everyone the chance to contribute 
equally. Although Wikipedia utilizes a code of conduct, which dictates the manner 
in which content should be changed (Wikipedia 2017b), this set of guidelines is 
limited in scope and, in many cases, essentially unenforceable. Its main requirement 
is that each contributor abides by a “neutral point of view” writing policy (Wikipedia 
2016b). This means that the contributor should avoid making personal comments or 
otherwise injecting judgments or opinions about the various perspectives on a spe-
cific topic. Disputes regarding the neutrality of a specific article may be settled 
through arbitration, but this is a protracted process that is generally avoided (Matei 
and Dobrescu 2011).
4.3  Wikipedia

52
More important than the code of conduct is the expectation that even when 
­partisan interests or inaccuracies seep into the read-write mechanism, the system 
itself will provide the means for quick redress. It is assumed that communal editing, 
by its open nature, will ensure continuous vigilance and general objectivity. In other 
words, the rationale for Wikipedia’s editing process hinges on the assumption that 
exposing an article to many users will result in self-correction. In theory, as soon as 
a biased contribution is posted, a thousand eyes will spot and correct it (Sanger 
2001), or to quote Linus’ law of computer programming, “Given enough eyeballs, 
all bugs are shallow” (Raymond 2001).
Yet the editorial mechanism described above relies, to a significant degree, on 
the expectation that the collaborative efforts will be egalitarian. The basic premise 
of a wiki system is that knowledge will be more abundant, reliable, and useful when 
it incorporates highly diverse inputs and viewpoints from a large number of con-
tributors who are all offering significant ideas and contributions, a notion that 
demands at least a degree of equality among contributors. Further, the egalitarian-
ism incorporated in the method of publication itself is expected to motivate con-
tributors, driving the generation of knowledge that offers quality and reliability that 
is equivalent, if not superior, to that of knowledge developed from more stratified 
social systems. Of course, these are normative expectations. The observable facts, 
as mentioned above and reiterated below, demand a different explanatory mecha-
nism for Wikipedia’s staying power.
There are many issues associated with claims that egalitarian systems will self-­
correct, the most obvious of which is that, after experimenting with radical open-
ness, Wikipedia itself was compelled to switch to a mix of openness and controlled 
access. Even more important, however, is the fact that equality might not have been 
present in the first place, despite the deeply ingrained assumptions to the contrary. 
After all, even though synthetic indicators of equality were used sporadically and 
only for descriptive purposes, there were nonetheless some early indications that the 
collaborative process was quite skewed, even at the early stages of the project 
(Ortega et al. 2008). When one considered the success of Wikipedia—which has 
often been attributed to its supposed egalitarianism—the possibility that this per-
ceived equality was a mere illusion from the start has significant ramifications for 
online social structuration and collaboration, both on Wikipedia and elsewhere.
With that in mind, in the following text, we outline our approach to measure 
equality, including a number of theoretical and statistical considerations that need to 
be addressed when measuring the equality of participation in online environments 
in general and on Wikipedia in particular. However, as has already been mentioned, 
this is not a goal in and by itself. Rather, it is a means toward an end, which is to 
explore the issue of structuration, to which the rest of the volume will be devoted.
With that in mind, the goal of the rest of this chapter is threefold. First, we aim 
to dispel the naïve understanding of online social dynamics, particularly as it relates 
to the frequent claims of implicit egalitarianism. Second, we offer a justification of 
our application of Shannon’s approach to information to serve as a social indicator 
and a proxy for structuration. Third, we lay the groundwork for a more in-depth 
analysis of the relationship between general system-level structuration and local

elite resilience. Entropy is, as we have already noted and will further explain below, 
the core indicator for tracking Wikipedia’s evolution over time. Thus, the choice of 
this metric and its significance deserves due attention.
4.4  Determinants of Structuration
Since the measures that we are introducing to address both claims of equality and 
our own perspective on structuration are relatively new to the analysis of social 
media, at least in the particular implementations that we propose, let us start by 
briefly explaining their statistical characteristics, methodological advantages, and 
potential shortcomings.
The discussion starts with the conceptual idea of the equal representation of ele-
ments in a system. When equal representation is present, there is maximum diver-
sity in the variation of qualities or attributes within a given system (in our case, the 
online collaborative environment). By this definition, diversity is not necessarily a 
cultural or even a social ideal; rather, it is a mere instrument of measurement. In 
fact, although systems that are composed of all possible elements in equal propor-
tions would have a maximum level of diversity by this definition, which emphasizes 
equal representation, they would not be “diverse” in the traditional sense of the 
word, which implies differences and, oftentimes, the presence or mitigation of 
minority groups and viewpoints. To put it another way, our measurement of diver-
sity does not include any evaluative meaning. It does not signal, as is the case in 
common parlance, that there is a “healthy combination” or a “good” variety of char-
acteristics and elements, each represented to maximize their potential and together 
to enhance the value of the whole. Diversity as a measurement tool in this context is 
maximized only when the elements are randomly distributed, thus reflecting a low 
level of structuration or none at all.
In this particular understanding, diversity is a measurement technique used to 
address other conceptual issues rather than merely an assumed ideal end state. We 
use the term in a technical sense, similar to that employed by other sciences. For 
example, in the contexts of ecology and biology this concept is known as biodiver-
sity, which is defined as a variety of life forms and which may be measured within 
a given ecological community (Maignan et al. 2003). In economics, various diver-
sity measures are used to evaluate the structure of an industry or of a geographically 
situated industrial or business environment (Stigler 1983). When applied to social 
contexts, the notion of diversity commonly refers to the presence of a variety of 
opinions, cultures, ethnic groups, and socioeconomic characteristics (Maignan et al. 
2003; McDonald and Dimmick 2003). Due to its wide utilization, the operational-
ization of the diversity concept tends to vary from discipline to discipline. For 
example, biodiversity in ecology includes diversity both within species and among 
species, as well as comparative diversity among ecosystems. The definition of 
­species itself is also dependent on research contexts, which necessitates additional 
definitions of diversity as it relates to species.
4.4  Determinants of Structuration

54
The common thread uniting all of these uses of diversity, however, is that maxi-
mum diversity is not a desired end state or even a possible one. For instance, no 
ecosystem can survive if all species are equally represented. As animal species feed 
on each other or on plant species, the ones at the top of the food chain need to be 
less prevalent than the ones that are at the bottom of the chain. An ecosystem in 
which the number of foxes and rabbits is equal will collapse, as there will be too 
many foxes for the available number of rabbits. The exhaustion of the rabbit popula-
tion will be promptly followed by the starvation of the foxes.
The same applies in economic systems. Firms at the end of the production chain 
are fewer than the ones at the bottom. An economy with an equal number of units at 
each level of production would be quite unstructured and could be found only in the 
earliest stages of human and societal evolution.
In an online collaboration system, we consider the issue of content production. 
Here, as we will see, when every member does as much work as any other, the work 
is likely to be very fragmented and thus not very structured. In addition, the lack of 
proper leadership will lead to problems, as higher transaction costs naturally result 
in either stagnation in the workflow or poor coordination in work objectives.
Now that the conceptual aspects of diversity in online collaborative systems have 
been addressed, extending the philosophic issues addressed in Chaps. 2 and 3, the 
remainder of this chapter focuses on a simpler question: How should we effectively 
employ diversity and entropy to measure structuration? In Sect. 4.5, we explore this 
process on a general level, touching on both measurement and conceptual issues, 
including those related to uncertainty.
4.5  Conceptual Underpinning
Suppose that we have an online communication space (O), which has n number of 
opinions and m number of members:
	
O

(4.1)
Let C be a classification of O. The opinions posted on the communication space 
can be classified by a certain criterion variable. For example, C might be a classifi-
cation set comprising each participant through number m. Thus,

(4.4)
The question that we want to answer, then, is how we can measure and quantify 
the diversity of contributions, participation, involvement, or presence in this con-
text. As a starting point, suppose that in the online communication space O, there is 
only one opinion posted by a single participant (Tom).
	
O
P
= *
{ }
={
}
1
and
Tom 	
(4.5)
where P represents the set of participants in O.
In this scenario, there is no uncertainty about who posted this opinion. It is com-
pletely certain that the sole contributor Tom must have been the person who posted 
his opinion in this communication space—in the absence of other participants, there 
are no other possibilities—so the online communication space therefore has no 
diversity.
Now suppose that there is another participant (say, Sara) in O. In other words,
	
O
P
= *
{ }
={
}
1
and
Tom, Sara .	
(4.6)
In this situation, the contributions to the online site could be made either by Tom 
or Sara. Therefore, we necessarily have a degree of uncertainty about contributions. 
From the perspective of information theory (Shannon and Weaver 1948), it is said 
that a question like this, which has two possible answers (Tom or Sara), carries 1 bit 
of information. More generally, if we had m participants in a communication space, 
the question of who made a given post would have m possible outcomes and would 
thus carry log2 m bits of information (Cover and Thomas 2006). To simplify the 
matter, this formula yields a rather trivial fact: as more people participate in an 
online community, social diversity tends to increase and so does uncertainty.
The value of measuring diversity with a mathematical formula becomes clearer 
when there are many members and many opinions in a communication space. For 
example:
	
O
P
C

= * * *

In this example (4.7), the star (*) and sharp (#) notations represent opinions. Tom 
posted three opinions, denoted with stars (*), and Sara posted one, given by a sharp

(#). Tom’s posts comprise 75% of the total opinions, with Sara’s accounting for the 
remaining 25%.
To extend the example, we can consider more diverse communication spaces 
with equal contributions by all members, such as the following:

(4.8)
The equal number of contributions made by these participants, 1
25
n =
% , clearly 
implies that the level of diversity in the communication space given in this new 
scenario (4.8) is higher than that of the communication space in the previous exam-
ple (4.7). In general, when we observe a uniform distribution of contributions 
among all participants in a communication space, then that space has the highest 
possible level of diversity.
4.5.1  Social Entropy as a Measure of Diversity and Equality
In sum, the diversity of opinions in communication spaces is a function of the num-
ber of participants (m) and the shares of participants (Si). The presence of more 
participants facilitates more diverse (and equal) participation—and as the contribu-
tions made by members of a community become more uniformly distributed, par-
ticipation necessarily becomes more diverse. In this respect, greater diversity means 
greater uncertainty and “disorder,” which can be conceptually explained as a higher 
level of “entropy.”
So, how can we translate this into a synthetic indicator? We can do it, as Shannon 
and Weaver suggested, by measuring the relative degree of disorganization found in 
any system. We may think of disorganization as the random mixing of various ele-
ments, whose relative presence should thus be equal. In social systems, disorganiza-
tion also implies a higher level of uncertainty and unpredictability of contributions. 
In this “random mixing” scenario, we can also say that the diversity of the system is 
at a maximum, since all elements are equally (randomly) present and their contribu-
tions entirely unpredictable.
With this in mind, we may turn to Shannon’s entropy index, which takes a value 
of 0 when there is absolute order in a given system (one element is prevalent at the 
expense of all others; contribution is perfectly uncertain) and holds a maximum 
value—which varies from system to system—when there is perfect disorder and 
diversity (all elements are equally present, and the source of a given contribution is 
maximally uncertain). In short, entropy is a synthetic measure that indicates, at a

glance, the extent to which the different components of a social or communicative 
space are well represented.
Mathematically, the entropy of a random variable X (in our case, the proportion 
of contributions made by different members of a social system) is defined as 
follows:

where K is a constant.
The value of entropy varies from zero (no entropy) to log2 m (maximum entropy).3
How do we apply this measure to online collaboration environments? Consider 
an online communication space in which there is a uniform distribution of contribu-
tions by four members: 1

(4.11)
The entropy of the communication space with a uniform distribution of contri-
butions is higher than the one with unequally distributed contributions. Likewise—
and this is crucial for the substantive interpretations that we can make with this 
type of measure—when entropy holds its maximum possible value, uncertainty is 
also maximized, especially with respect to the potential future states of the 
system.
3 The present example employs logarithms taken at base 2, which allows entropy to be measured in 
bits. Other values such as e or 10 could be used for the base instead, as this choice is relatively 
arbitrary and does not affect the calculation of normalized entropy values or any proportional 
comparisons between contributors and contributions (Lemay 1999).
4.5  Conceptual Underpinning

58
4.5.2  Normalized Social Entropy as a Diversity/Equality 
Measure
Before further developing this conceptual point about uncertainty, we need to make 
a mathematical observation. Although entropy is an elegant modality to measure 
diversity in a system, it carries some potential limitations. In particular, entropy, as 
laid out above, reflects not just one but two system dimensions: richness and even-
ness (equality). When we collapse them into one index score, there is a loss of 
information. Moreover, the two dimensions may act in opposition to one another 
such that very different online communication groups in terms of composition and 
contributions exhibit similar entropy scores (Balch 2000). It goes without saying 
that this can lead to some confusion.
As an example, communication space (C1) has two opinions expressed by two 
participants. The two participants have contributed an equal share of opinions: 
1
2

participants, and the opinions are unequally distributed among the 8 participants:

counterintuitive result: while the entropy of the first communication space (C1) is 1, 
the entropy of the second communication space (C2) is 2. Thus, (C2) has a higher 
entropy level despite the fact that its opinions are less evenly distributed compared 
to (C1). This is because (C2) has more participants, so the fact that its contributions 
are unequally distributed is hidden—the change in richness masks differences in 
evenness between the two communication spaces. The direct consequence is that 
the absolute increase in the value of entropy does not reliably indicate how much 
more (or less) organized a system is compared to another if the number of elements 
(participants) differs between the two systems.
We may solve this problem by normalizing the entropy values. Doing so enables 
us to compare the evenness of multiple communication spaces or to assess changes 
in evenness within one communication space over time, by controlling for the num-
ber of elements that composes the system. We achieve this normalization by divid-
ing the absolute entropy score by its maximum, log2m, which limits the range of 
possible entropy values from 0 to 1.

As a side note, normalized entropy is particularly useful for handling the “lurker” 
problem of studying diversity in online environments. Lurkers are users who do not 
directly contribute to a communication environment; he or she is just an observer. 
Lurkers can potentially make the communication environment richer, and their

presence may also impact diversity. The challenge, then, is capturing both of these 
aspects of lurker behavior.
Suppose that there are two communication spaces. In both, the two members

In addition to Tom and Jane, who contributed equally, the second communication 
space also includes lurker Sara, who did not contribute to the interaction. Despite 
this important difference, the non-normalized entropy of the two communication 
environments is the same:

By comparing the normalized entropy of the two communication spaces, we can 
see that the first communication space is more diverse—that is, more randomly 
distributed and less structured—than the second one, because the normalized 
entropy formula properly accounts for the presence of the lurker.

4.6  Using Entropy to Study Online Collaborative Systems 
such as Wikipedia
Social entropy can be used to measure changes over time in terms of contribution 
diversity and, thus, structuration of contributions to Wikipedia articles (entries). When 
tracked over time, entropy can also be used to measure system-level changes in struc-
turation, beyond individual articles in isolation. We can therefore use values of social 
entropy to answer two key questions: “How equally distributed are the contributions to 
Wikipedia among users?” and “How structured are collaborative groups on Wikipedia?”
It should further be noted that our earlier examples assumed that all contributions 
were equal, but this may not necessarily be the case. After all, in a collaborative 
system like Wikipedia, some contributions—in this context, revisions to an ­article—
may have much more of an impact than others. (Should we really deem contributing 
a paragraph of original content to have the same value as correcting a single typo-
graphical error?) Such differences need to be addressed in order to properly assess 
the social structuration of collaborative processes.
With that in mind, the following example illustrates how entropy can be used to 
determine the evolution of collaborative structuration in specific Wikipedia articles 
and to do so while accounting for the relative significance of each contribution.
We selected the first few edits made to the Indian film Naina (Wikipedia 2008). 
On May 16, 2005, Hemanshu created the article using 16 words4: “Naina is a Hindi 
movie to be released in India in 2005. It stars Urmila Matondkar.” On July 4, 2005, 
an anonymous user (A1)5 added 15 words at the end of Hemanshu’s original entry: 
“It’s genre is horror. It is having great similarities over the English film The Eye.” 
On December 24, 2005, a second anonymous user (A2) contributed 24 more words 
to the article, and on December 30, a third anonymous user (A3) proofread and 
edited the article, deleting 21 words and adding 10 of his or her own (in bold).
Naina is a Hindi movie released in India in 2005. It stars Urmila Matondkar. It’s genre is 
horror. It has many similarities with the English film The Eye. It’s release created contro-
versy in India because of the fact that the lady had eye transplant before experiencing 
extra sensory perceptions in the film, and that discouraged many people from receiving 
eye transplants.
Finally, in January and February 2006, NilsB and DomLachosicz added external 
hyperlinks6 and jointly deleted 13 words and added 12 new words.
4 As an alternative to the number of words added, deleted, or modified, one could instead choose to 
use the number of characters as a measure of the amount of information contributed. The choice of 
measures will be addressed at greater length in Chap. 5.
5 On Wikipedia, registered users have their own screen name that appears in the history page for 
every article. Peripheral users with no membership have no screen name. However, we may still 
determine who wrote what using anonymous users’ IP addresses, which the wiki makes visible.
6 Measuring visible text is a relatively straightforward task. In contrast, it is challenging to deter-
mine how to count and measure the effort and/or impact of visual content and interactive media 
such as diagrams, photographs, videos, hyperlinks, and so forth. This conceptual and technical 
question calls for further scholarly attention and discussion; it is not addressed at length in this 
volume. The present study considers only visible text in calculations of effort and entropy, as well 
as various other measures to be discussed later in this volume.

Figure 4.1 shows the relative contributions made by the editors who made these 
initial substantive revisions, with the proportions based on the number of words 
added or deleted from the text to showcase the impact of a given revision upon the 
article’s content. The changes in these proportions are given over time, with five 
especially meaningful iterations of the article provided for illustrative purposes.
Likewise, Table  4.1 provides the descriptive and entropy statistics associated 
with these five successive versions. As shown in Table 4.1, the length of the article 
substantially increased over time, reaching 69 words by the end of this set of 
revisions.
As a consequence of the increase in textual contributions and the number of con-
tributors, the social entropy of the article also increased over time. As is evident

from Fig. 4.2, social entropy increased from 0 (no diversity) upon the article’s cre-
ation, when only one user had contributed, to 2.53 in the last version shown, which 
demonstrates the increasing tendency toward diversity in the collaborative process.
Does the observed increase in diversity, however, represent an increase in ran-
domness and an indication that the editorial process became more uncertain and less 
structured over time? Or, is it merely a by-product of the growing richness of the 
communication environment surrounding this article as additional editors joined the 
collaborative process? To answer this question, we must separate collaborative 
structuration from mere richness. This can be achieved by converting the raw 
entropy values using the normalized entropy formula that was previously 
discussed.
Figure 4.3 shows that normalized entropy did not steadily decline but instead 
fluctuated over time. The second version of the article7 had a normalized entropy 
value of Ho = 0.998, which is very close to the maximum value of 1. This means that 
Hemanshu and the first anonymous user (A1) contributed to almost exactly the 
7 Note that the first version was skipped, as normalized entropy cannot be calculated when only one 
user has contributed since the maximum possible entropy value would be Hmax = log2 1 = 0.

same degree. In the third version of the article, the normalized entropy slightly 
dropped as the second anonymous user (A2) added a relatively large amount of 
textual information (44% of the words in the article) compared to the other two 
contributors. Then, in the fourth and fifth versions of the article, the normalized 
entropy increased as other new contributors (A3, NilsB, and DomLach) participated 
relatively evenly in this collaborative writing process. Overall, though, the amount 
of normalized entropy and structuration declined from its initial value, reaching a 
submaximal level.
Of course, this example has little meaning by itself, since it does not track a suf-
ficient number of edits for us to draw generalizable conclusions about social struc-
turation across collaborative interactions. What this simple example does provide, 
however, is “proof of concept”—a demonstration of the synthetic characterization 
of social entropy’s evolution over time, through which we may measure the diversity 
within an article. Further, by comparing the two versions of entropy (raw and nor-
malized), it becomes clear that while the first measure yields only a relatively steady 
(and uninteresting) increase in entropy over time, the second is capable of capturing 
subtle fluctuations and variations at a level lower than the maximum possible value.
Moreover, if we compare Fig. 4.2 with Fig. 4.3, we notice that the slope for the 
increase in raw entropy is far more abrupt than the one for normalized entropy, even 
after the third version of the article. Observations like this one, along with the fluc-
tuations observed in Fig. 4.3, can facilitate the formulation of tentative hypotheses.
We can speculate, for instance, that the effect of newly added information on 
diversity will diminish in size as the total amount of textual information increases. 
In other words, as more and more contributions are made to an article, each succes-
sive contribution will tend to have less of an effect on entropy. Consequently, nor-
malized social entropy may tend to level off as the article evolves, eventually 
reaching a somewhat stable value that represents not merely a meaningless statisti-
cal artifact, but a form of structural stabilization within the collaborative process. 
Such conjectures could be addressed beyond the hypothetical level by directly 
observing the evolution of social entropy (and collaborative evenness) across the 
entire collaborative Wikipedia space over a long period of time.
This is, in fact, the approach that we will present in the next few chapters. We used 
the normalized entropy index to measure the evolution of collaborative structuration 
across Wikipedia between its inception (2001) and 2010, encompassing nearly a 
decade of collaborative activity. Contributions to Wikipedia were operationalized as 
the “amount of effort” or “contribution effort” performed for each unique editorial 
intervention made to Wikipedia throughout the nine-and-a-half-year period. 
“Contribution effort” was quantified by Luca de Alfaro and his colleagues at the 
University of California, Santa Cruz (see de Alfaro 2009 for details) using a “delta” 
metric, which is used to assess how “far” each successive edit moves a given article 
from its preceding version. This measure encompasses three factors: how much con-
tent was contributed through a particular edit, how much old content was deleted in the 
process, and how much the existing text was reordered. The specific formula used is

where
I = total inserted text,
D = total deleted text,
M = total relative change of position (a measure of text reordering).
In effect, the edit “distance” formula (de Alfaro et al. 2010) ranges from zero to 
infinity, representing the amount of content contributed at each editing iteration and, 
more importantly, the effort that went into generating said content. Minor revisions, 
like the correction of typographical errors or simple cut-and-paste operations, count 
for less than content that is new, changes the flow of the text, or is added at multiple 
locations in the text. Appendix A provides an in-depth presentation of the methods 
used for pre-processing the data analyzed in this book.
4.7  What Have We Learned So Far?
Social entropy is a very promising procedural approach for assessing group dynam-
ics, especially in terms of measuring the structuration of contributions in online 
communication. This is relevant not only for wiki articles but also in other types of 
virtual communities: social media, newsgroups, email lists, blogs, and so forth. 
Given this cross domain applicability, a significant impact of this measure would be 
to rekindle interest in system-level processes and their measurement in online 
environments.
Social entropy enables us to characterize the status of a system with respect to its 
level of diversity and structuration in a very parsimonious manner. A wide range of 
questions—does this communication system develop a structure over time? at what 
optimal level does the structuration process stop? and so on—become addressable 
and measurable. Of course, the assumption that open, networked systems would 
automatically engender egalitarian environments has been relatively naïve. We 
already suspect that as online communication systems matured, they often became 
dominated by the few at the expense of the many. With that said, using the approach 
proposed above, we can transcend mere conjecture and form decisive conclusions 
about social inequalities. In short, we now have a way to systematically examine 
these inequalities as more than anecdotal aberrations.
Thus, the need to examine diversity, structuration, and the equality of contribu-
tions (or the lack thereof) is also an invitation to use social entropy, not as an end in 
itself, but as a means toward better understanding the vast array of social and com-
municative systems in our world. In particular, although it may initially seem 
­intuitive, the claim that open communication systems should be egalitarian or tend 
toward diversity and equality—that is, that their levels of entropy should increase 
over time—does not make much theoretical sense. Such suppositions contradict 
what we know about human organization, which is that at least for some periods of 
growth it becomes more structured and predictable, not less.
4  Social Structuration Online: Entropy and Social Systems

65
Future research should take into account the fact that diversity and equality, 
although seemingly admirable societal and moral goals, might not always be pres-
ent or even functionally desirable in the structure of a collaborative group, espe-
cially when diversity increases to such an extent that it affects the group’s ability to 
structure itself. Processes related to group structure and functional differentiation of 
the members, creation and maintenance of group communicative standards, preser-
vation of a given meaning over time, and prevention of ambiguity might be critical 
forces that promote the group’s evolutionary life cycle and growth. Additionally, as 
groups coalesce and functional hierarchies are formed, entropy may not be maxi-
mized but instead reduced or maintained at an optimal level. From this perspective, 
one of the most important theoretical goals of the social entropy perspective would 
be to discern what entropy levels are optimal for any given online communicative 
and collaborative system and, further, to pinpoint which entropy level corresponds 
to what degree of functional differentiation and hierarchical organization.
Ultimately, what makes the social entropy index so enticing is that it gives 
researchers a gauge to directly measure and assess levels of collaboration and their 
significance. Yet, the theoretical and practical ramifications of such a measure 
extend even further than that. In the chapters to come, we will investigate some of 
these wide-ranging ramifications as they emerge on Wikipedia.

Analytic Investigation of a Structural 
Differentiation Model for Social Media 
Production Groups
5.1  Introduction
In the previous chapters, we articulated the role of evolutionary processes on 
Wikipedia and similar social media production sites and then outlined the main 
reasoning behind using entropy as a measure of structuration. The main claim is 
that, just like many other self-organizing voluntary organizations, online social 
groups need to overcome the increasing costs of communication and coordination 
as they continue to grow and evolve, which they do via the emergence of leading 
contributors who work substantially more than their peers.1
By taking on central roles in the production process, emergent leaders provide 
several services to the group at once. First, they reduce the collaborative paths 
between the core participants. The contributors who are responsible for most of the 
contributions only need to keep an eye on each other to learn what is happening 
around them.
More importantly, their constant presence in a variety of collaborative contexts within 
the group allows them to act as go-between nodes in the structure of collaboration. This 
need not be explicit or even deliberate, as a leader’s mere presence and the social cues 
sent through one’s contributions signal to the rest of the collaborative team that a central 
member of the project is about to bring the current collaborative task to closure.
Finally, emergent leaders play a crucial role in shaping the content itself, ensur-
ing continuity, direction, and narrative coherence. Although these elements may, at 
times, be tainted by partisanship and turf wars, which are typically won by the par-
ticipants with the most time available to “fight it out,” this is an unavoidable cost 
that must be accepted for the sake of the project’s success (Kriplean et al. 2007, 
2008).
1 In what follows, we summarily recapitulate the arguments made in the previous chapters. For the 
sake of readability, we have limited the citations to the minimum necessary. All the claims made in 
this chapter, however, are richly and completely referenced in Chaps. 2, 3, and 4 of Part I.

70
Throughout their interventions, activities, and implicit and explicit communica-
tion processes, the leaders lead first and foremost by doing more than their peers, 
not by merely claiming to be leaders. Their leadership is, as previously mentioned, 
functional. It is leadership that comes from working harder than everybody else. If 
the collaborative process on Wikipedia were likened to a marathon, the leaders 
would be those who could run the fastest over the longest periods of time. Wikipedia 
and many other social media projects are, after all, endurance contests. As soon as a 
leader ceases to contribute at a high rate and be present in as many aspects of the 
project as possible, he or she starts sliding down the metaphorical ladder. This pro-
cess is captured within the idea of adhocracy, as leading by doing is necessarily 
characterized by a certain turnover rate. This turnover rate can neither be too low 
(which would imply leaders who are entrenched regardless of effort) nor too high 
(suggesting a lack of any consistency whatsoever in the leadership cadre).
In this chapter, we will look at the contours of leadership groups and at their 
temporal persistence, or stickiness, the latter of which we will assess via their turn-
over. We will further analyze the relationship between the evolution of group struc-
turation (entropy) and elite stickiness in order to elucidate the role of elites in 
relation to the larger organization. Finally, we will examine the factors that explain 
how individuals advance to elite status, thereby adding a microlevel perspective to 
the meso- and macro-level dynamics under study.
5.2  Methods
5.2.1  Data
The present study investigates Wikipedia’s first 9.5 years of editorial activity, span-
ning the beginning of 2001 through June 2010. Our data includes every single edito-
rial change made to any content article. Revisions to talk or policy pages were not 
included in the data set, as we chose to focus on the most visible outputs that would 
have a direct effect on Wikipedia visitors, most of whom are unlikely to view any 
pages beyond the articles themselves. Data was obtained from the MediaWiki proj-
ect at https://dumps.wikimedia.org, which until a few years ago freely provided 
Wikipedia database dumps to the research community. Since 2010, data releases 
have become much more difficult and of inconsistent quality, so we thus decided to 
use the last reliable corpus available.
With these restrictions in mind, we identified approximately 235 million edito-
rial changes made by 22 million unique editors. Of these, three million were unique 
registered users, while the rest were anonymous editors represented only by their 
respective IP addresses.
The raw editorial data was processed with the WikiTrust parser (Adler et al. 
2008), which analyzes each editorial intervention and calculates its “contribution 
delta” (d)—the amount of effective change and, by proxy, of effort invested in the 
change. As noted in Chap. 4, the d formula takes into account all three kinds of 
5  Analytic Investigation of a Structural Differentiation Model for Social Media…

changes that could be recorded for a given intervention: additions, deletions, and 
changes to existing text. It aims to provide a moderated score that accounts for but 
also limits the impact of deletions and mere copy-paste changes when compared 
with additions of new content. In this respect, this formula represents a superior 
measurement strategy over previous attempts made in similar studies, which typi-
cally used mere character counts to estimate the significance of different 
contributions.
For reference, the contribution delta formula, which was also provided in Chap. 
4, is as follows:

M

(5.1)
where I = total inserted text, D = total deleted text, and M = total relative change of 
position (a measure of text reordering).
The d score is used throughout this study as the main measure of user contribu-
tions. Ascertaining the exact quantity of material contributed by each individual 
user further allowed us to calculate three key parameters: the degree of system 
inequality, the presence or absence of a given individual in the contributing elite, 
and the strength of collaborative connections among fellow contributors.
First, system inequality was measured using an application of the entropy for-
mula (Shannon and Weaver 1948):

(5.2)
where K is a constant.
For each week, a normalized entropy value between 0 and 1 was calculated to 
ensure comparability across weeks. Normalized entropy was 1 when observed 
entropy equaled the maximum possible entropy level, with lower levels of entropy 
signifying a higher level of group structuration (see Appendix A for details). With 
this in mind, we measured group entropy at a weekly level, considering all contribu-
tions dating back to Wikipedia’s launch, for a total of 495 weeks. (For instance, the 
first measurement used all contributions made in Wikipedia’s first week, the second 
accounted for all revisions made in the first 2 weeks, and so forth.) These data are 
presented in Appendix A, Table A.2.
Second, to evaluate elite group stickiness, we measured the percentage of indi-
viduals present among the elites from one 5-week period to the next. The intervals 
for elite stickiness are longer than the ones for entropy because 1 week is not a suf-
ficiently long period to distinguish elite editors from more casual contributors. The 
5-week interval was determined empirically by observing the intervals that offered 
the best smoothing function. Additionally, for the sake of ensuring sufficient data to 
define an elite group, the first 3 weeks were dropped from this assessment, which 
left 98 measurement points. This data set is presented in Appendix A, Table A.3.
The last key parameter was the strength of coeditorial connections between edi-
tors. This measure was necessary in order to see if nonelite members’ connections

to members of the elite would impact their probability of being in the elite at a 
future time. To assess this final parameter, we constructed a graph of coeditorial 
connections for each week to summarize the intensity of implicit collaboration 
between all editors up to that point in time. Our measure of intensity used a gravi-
tational model, where two editors who edited the same article in close succession 
and whose contributions were both substantial in nature held a stronger connection. 
This method is similar to the gravitational model for constructing economic, social, 
and organizational networks, pioneered by Isard (1954, 1975). Specifically, the for-
mula is

where Mi is the contribution delta of the revision made by the first editor, Mj is the 
contribution delta of the revision made by the first editor, and dij is the distance 
between the revisions, measured by consecutive edits.
If the same two editors coedited more than one article, or if they coedited the 
same article through multiple iterations, their total connection was deemed equal to 
the sum of all their connections across all articles (Britt 2011, 2013; Matei et al. 
2015). Again, for details, see Appendix A.
5.2.2  Overall Analysis Strategy
In Chap. 3, we proposed five research questions to direct our investigation:
	RQ1.	 Is there a distinct group of highly productive (elite) users on Wikipedia, and 
if so, to what extent do they dominate contributions to the project over time?
	RQ2.	 What is the social mobility (or its inverse, elite “stickiness”) of functional 
leaders on Wikipedia over time?
	RQ3.	 Are there distinct growth phases determined by the emergence of functional 
leaders in Wikipedia’s first 9 years of existence (2001–2010)?
	RQ4.	 What is the relationship between global inequality, or social structuration, 
and elite stickiness?
	RQ5.	 Is promotion to the elite group a function of prior interactions with elites?
We start by determining the contours of the contributing elite. If members of the 
elite are, as would be expected, one or several orders of magnitude more productive 
than the rest of the editors, then the distribution curve would follow a power law, 
with a definite inflection point. After ascertaining the presence of a power-law dis-
tribution at the global level with an inflection point, data for each week was simi-
larly plotted, and the respective inflection points that differentiated the elite 
contributors from the rest during each individual week were determined as well. 
Finally, the weekly inequality level was calculated using entropy.

73
The percentage of users in the elite varied, but on average, this was essentially 
the same as that of the global level, at approximately 1%. For each 5-week period, 
we calculated the level of elite stickiness, and average levels of entropy for 5-week 
intervals were also calculated so that these measures could be aligned. Next, we 
used a stepwise segmented regression analysis to determine the discrete phases of 
inequality (structuration) for the entire period (2001–2010). For further details 
about this procedure, see Chap. 9 and Appendix C.
Given the longitudinal nature of the data, we also evaluated the presence and 
intensity of autoregressive processes in the two core variables, entropy and sticki-
ness. An ACF (autocorrelation function) suggested a baseline predictive model and 
its directionality, which was tested using lagged regression (Shumway and Stoffer 
2010).
Finally, we tested the probability that a current nonelite member would be pres-
ent in the elite at a future point in time on the basis of his or her connections to 
members of the elite as well as the amount of past and present contributions made. 
The different factors predicting elite ascension were plotted onto the evolutionary 
phases predicted by Wenger (1998) to determine if recruitment processes changed 
along with those phases or were independent of them.
5.2.3  Descriptive Exploration
Over the study period (2001–2010), we observed 235,701,162 edits completed by 
22,792,847 unique contributors. Of these, 19,680,637 users were anonymous, iden-
tified only by their unique IP addresses. The rest (3,112,210) were registered users 
who were logged into their respective accounts. As previously mentioned, logged-in 
users were the clear minority group, yet they contributed far more edits than the 
anonymous users—all told, those logged-in individuals were responsible for almost 
two-thirds (68%) of the observed revisions. Even more importantly, the top 1% of 
all contributors were responsible for 77% of the collaborative effort based upon the 
extent to which the text of articles was actually changed (i.e., the contribution delta). 
Logged-in users were also more important among elite users—within the top 1% of 
contributors, those who were logged in accounted for 82% of the elite group’s col-
laborative effort.
The contribution quantity follows a power-law distribution (long tail, sharp head 
slope) with a definite inflection point defining the top 2–3% of contributors 
(Fig. 5.1). Thus, the “head” of the curve includes approximately the top 1% of all 
contributors, the “neck” the top 2–3%, and the tail the remaining 97%. We used a 
maximum likelihood estimation technique combined with bootstrapping using the 
poweRlaw library in R to determine that the observed distribution indeed belongs to 
the power law family (p > 0.1; see Clauset et al. 2009).
These findings indicate that the first part of research question 1 (RQ1), “Is there 
a distinct group of highly productive (elite) users on Wikipedia?” should be answered 
in the affirmative. Even more significantly, the majority of the contributions made 
5.2  Methods

74
by elite members belong to the logged-in users. The logged-in members of the top 
1% contributor elite singlehandedly comprise a very significant share of contribu-
tions made to Wikipedia, measured by amount of effective work. This makes sense, 
as one can easily guess that logged-in users, who bother to create online names and 
identities to which their efforts are attributed, would be the most invested and moti-
vated to enhance the long-term structuration of the project. As we can see, those 
logged-in elites thoroughly dominate the project, thereby answering the second part 
of RQ1 as well.
Furthermore, it is worth recognizing that IP addresses would be unreliable indi-
cators for determining the unique identities of contributors over long periods of 
time, so any structuration analysis using that data would be unreliable as well. On 
the basis of this practical reality as well as our finding about the relative importance 
of registered users—even among the elites—we chose to focus the rest of our 
research on logged-in users, since they carry the weight of the project.
Therefore, the rest of the analysis focuses on the social structuration and elite 
temporal behavior among a subset of Wikipedia contributors, those users logged 
into registered accounts, as they are the most heavily invested in the project and 
contribute the most to it.
With that in mind, mapping the inequalities among editors in terms of both raw 
effort (amount of d contributed by the top logged-in users) and the entropy level of 
all contributions allows us to observe the trajectory of the structuration process as it 
developed on a week-by-week basis throughout the 9.5-year period (Fig. 5.2). For 
the sake of visual comparisons between variables, all entropy values shown in 
Fig. 5.2 have been multiplied by 100.

On this chart, entropy has an interesting trajectory, although when we consider 
Wenger’s (1998) perspective on organizational evolutionary phases it becomes quite 
understandable. After a period of turbulence spanning its first 92  weeks, the 
Wikipedia project quickly gained new editors and progressed through a period of 
increasing egalitarianism (at least in relative terms). However, in week 226, the 
project reached a minimum of relative inequality (and maximum entropy), and after 
that week, inequality steadily increased over time. During this period, entropy 
declined (and inequality correspondingly increased) by 12%, from 0.719 to 0.635. 
Importantly, this inequality continued to grow even as the numbers of articles, 
authors, and editorial interventions rapidly swelled.
Elite resilience (stickiness), represented as gray spikes marking the end points of 
our 5-week intervals, varied widely in the first half of the project, when participation 
was more chaotic and less structured. After week 290, following the decline in 
entropy and the corresponding increase in structural differentiation, it started 
increasing at a steady pace. Setting aside these variations, the simple answer to 
research question 2 (RQ2), “What is the social mobility (or its inverse, elite “sticki-
ness”) of functional leaders on Wikipedia over time?” is that on average, across the 
entire 9.5-year period, an individual who was a top contributor at a given point in 
time had a 40% probability of remaining in the top contributor group 5 weeks later. 
Twenty weeks later, that individual would have a 32% chance of still being a top 
contributor, and after 30 weeks, this figure would be at 28%.

5.2.4  Inferential Analysis
In addition to RQ1 and RQ2, both of which were broad, exploratory questions, we 
proposed three research questions that explore specific details pertaining to the rela-
tionships between elite stickiness, social structure, and organizational evolution.
	RQ3.	 Are there distinct growth phases determined by the emergence of functional 
leaders in Wikipedia’s first 9 years of existence (2001–2010)?
	RQ4.	 What is the relationship between global inequality, or social structuration, 
and elite stickiness?
	RQ5.	 Is promotion to the elite group a function of prior interactions with elites?
Research question 3 (RQ3) deals with a crucial issue regarding social media 
spaces. Are they evolutionary organisms? Can we detect discrete phases in their 
evolution? To address this matter, we adapted and extended segmented (piecewise) 
regression analysis. Typically, this type of analysis is used when, for different ranges 
of X values explaining a response variable Y, there are different intercepts, slopes, 
or higher-order terms separated by clear breakpoints. Segmented regression allows 
different models to be fit to different segments of the data. In the process, model 
boundaries will indicate the breakpoints in the explanatory data.
In a segmented regression model, one of the main explanatory variables is an 
indicator function, which acts as a dummy variable. According to Britt (2013), each 
indicator function corresponds to all data points following a given point in the data 
set. Thus, by employing a stepwise selection procedure, indicator functions may be 
added and removed from the model using a predetermined selection threshold, such 
as the common α = 0.15 standard (Crawley 2007). A given data point is a statisti-
cally significant breakpoint whenever its indicator function has a statistically sig-
nificant effect the model, and that breakpoint signifies that the data segment 
following it has a significantly different intercept, slope, or higher-order term than 
the segment preceding the breakpoint. In other words, there is a clearly discernible 
change in the model.
Our stepwise segmented regression analysis used the week number as the predic-
tor variable to predict entropy. In other words, we modeled changes in entropy over 
time, so any breakpoints represented fundamental changes in the growth or stability 
of entropy. We identified several breakpoints, which are listed in Table 5.12:
By comparing the intercepts occurring before and after each breakpoint (see the 
parameter estimates in Table 5.1), we notice that some shifts are very significant in 
magnitude (e.g., weeks 92, 204, and 250), while other breakpoints denote much 
smaller changes (such as weeks 42 and 335). More importantly, visually inspecting 
2 For the sake of simplicity, only the intercept terms are provided in Table 5.1. The complete regres-
sion model including all intercept, slope, and quadratic terms is provided in Appendix A. Likewise, 
in Chap. 9, we identify several other breakpoints denoting significant transition points in the evolu-
tion of the project. These emerged from analyzing four other dimensions of collaboration that are 
not discussed in this chapter. Again, a full description of the significance of all breakpoints is 
provided in Appendix A.

the curve (Fig. 5.3) and comparing it with the parameter estimates from Table 5.1 
allow us to identify four main phases spanning weeks 0–91, weeks 92–203, weeks 
204–334, and week 335 to the end of the data set.
These periods map well onto Wenger’s (1998) phases of organizational evolu-
tion. The first phase, potential, is characterized by wide swings in behavioral norms 
and expectations—including leadership dynamics—which fits the erratic vacilla-
tions observed during the first 91  weeks. An approximate midpoint at week 42 
marks a maximum of entropy for the entire period. The second period, coalescence,

is theorized to be one of rapid growth, characterized by a sharper evolutionary slope, 
as it is in our case from weeks 92 to 203. Notably, the abrupt drop in entropy at week 
92 is the product of the introduction of the first bot (rambot), which added a large 
number of articles in a very short period of time. This occurred early in the life of 
the project, and its contributions were, in time, overshadowed by the larger-scale 
organic growth of the project. Nonetheless, this intervention is significant consider-
ing its impact on the collaborative effort at the time, so it will be discussed at length 
in Chap. 9.
The last two periods that Wenger (1998) described are those of maturation and 
stabilization or stewardship. In our context, we may observe that the entropy curve 
shown in Fig.  5.3 exhibits a distinct “cooling off” (maturation) phase between 
weeks 204 and 334 and a “leveling off” (stabilization) phase from week 335 to the 
end of the data set.
This alignment of our breakpoints onto an existing evolutionary model provides 
a clear answer to RQ3, as it demonstrates that the social structuration of Wikipedia 
included discrete and well-defined evolutionary phases that followed predictable 
steps of growth and stabilization. This strengthens the claim that Wikipedia, as a 
social space of collaboration, followed an evolutionary path, which by definition 
involved structural differentiation. With that said, we still require a more complete 
demonstration of the phase approach for revealing collaborative structures and, 
more importantly, a concrete articulation of the identity of those structures. This 
will be provided in Part II of this volume, especially in Chaps. 8 and 9.
Moving on, research question 4 (RQ4) is probably the most important of our 
study, as it addresses the crucial relationship between elite resilience (stickiness) 
and organizational structuration (entropy). In other words, we ask whether pro-
cesses that occur at local (intra-elite) levels interact with global structuration 
processes.
To answer this question, we analyzed the relationship between two variables, 
elite resilience (stickiness) and entropy, using a lagged regression approach. This 
procedure is used to discern the effect of past values of the predictor variable 
(entropy) on future changes in the variable of interest (stickiness). Importantly, we 
focused on the periods of growth and maturity occurring from week 92 onward. The 
reasons for this are twofold. First, as we will explain in Chaps. 9 and 10, up to week 
92, Wikipedia went through two major socio-technological changes, including a 
new database structure and a massive injection of content that was automatically 
generated. Given the small size of the project (hundreds and thousands of articles 
and authors compared to the millions by the stabilization phase), these early changes 
made the data very noisy. Second, our focus is on detecting the relationship between 
stickiness and entropy in the context of adhocracy, which starts, as we will show in 
Chaps. 9 and 10, after week 92.
Given the time series nature of the data, we analyzed the cross-correlation func-
tion (CCF) using the ts library in R to determine what leads the process: structura-
tion or elite stickiness. We regressed the stickiness of the logged-in editors on lagged 
values of entropy and found that changes in entropy lead to changes in stickiness, 
not vice versa. Figure 5.4 shows that, with entropy as the independent variable to 
5  Analytic Investigation of a Structural Differentiation Model for Social Media…

79
predict stickiness, the highest lag is the seventh negative one. Negative lags indicate 
that changes in the X variable, entropy, lead and potentially cause those for the Y 
variable, stickiness. Since elite stickiness was measured every 5 weeks, this means 
that changes in entropy have a maximum and statistically significant effect 
30–35 weeks later. Furthermore, the correlation value for lag 7 is negative, at −0.5. 
In conceptual terms, as the level of structuration increases—which we observe as a 
decrease in entropy—the likelihood that current members of the elite will still be in 
the elite at a future point in time also increases. Thus, increasing structuration results 
in increasing elite stickiness.
Lagged regression analysis of the effect of lag 7 of entropy on stickiness, control-
ling for unlagged values of entropy, yielded a negative (unstandardized b = −2.21, 
standardized β = −0.94) and highly significant (p < 0.001) effect. Furthermore, 
almost half of the variance in stickiness is explained by present and past values of 
entropy (R2 = 0.47). Our ACF analysis of the residuals indicates that the autocorrela-
tion function is not systemic, suggesting a good model fit (see Fig. 5.5).

80
All told, then, the answer to RQ4 is that there is a significant relationship between 
social structuration and elite resilience, with the former preceding the latter. 
Structuration precedes elite consolidation, not the other way around.
Research question 5 (RQ5), the last at this stage of our discussion, addresses the 
mechanism by which members of the elite are promoted in the period of maturity. 
Two models of ascension may be proposed. The first model presumes that advance-
ment is osmotic, as new members rise among the most productive contributors 
solely through their own efforts, with no support from those already in the elite. The 
second instead assumes that interacting with the elite members by collaborating 
with them on specific articles in close succession constitutes a process of implicit 
acculturation and social training. While the latter model does not assume collusion, 
it does assume that collaborative work increases the chances of interaction and the 
acceptance of one’s own contributions. This may motivate nonelite users, whose 
increased productivity would then lead them to an elite status.
We tested both models using logistic regression. The dependent variable was 
whether or not current elite and nonelite members were present in the elite group in 
the future (specifically, during the following 5-week interval), while the key 
­independent variable was the strength of one’s existing connection to elite members 
in the current 5-week interval. Elite membership was defined in terms of the loca-
tion of one’s own contribution quantity, whether to the right (tail, low contribution) 
or left (head, high contribution) of the inflection point in the power-law distribution 
of contributions in each 5-week period (see Fig. 5.1).
The following predictor variables were also introduced into the model:
•	 Contribution quantity in the current 5-week period (lag 1) and the immediately 
previous period (lag 2)
•	 Number of collaborative connections to elite and nonelite members in the current 
period (lag 1) and the previous one (lag 2)
•	 Weight of connections to elite and nonelite members in the current period (lag 1) 
and the previous one (lag 2)
The number of connections was operationalized as the number of times a given 
pair of individuals coedited any article, while “weight” was the sum of the value of 
the connections formed between the pair as specified by the gravitational model 
(Eq. 5.3).
In order to handle the massive amount of available data, we used a random sam-
ple of up to 1,000 individuals from the elite and 1,000 from the nonelite for each 
5-week interval. With an effect size of 1,000 contribution delta units and α = 0.05, 
the power of the random sample was 0.994, a high value that justifies a sample-­
based analysis. However, this approach compelled us to skip the first 100 weeks 
within the data set, during which the total number of contributors for many 5-week 
periods was lower than 2,000.
A logistic regression approach demands that the dependent variable be trans-
formed into a logit odds ratio, log

. Additionally, an iteratively 
reweighted least squares method was applied to maximize the likelihood function, 
so in our case, the higher the odds ratio for the parameter estimate, the more likely 
that a user belonged to the elite group.
Upon fitting this model, we concluded that one’s connection to elite members, 
whether based upon number of coedits or the sum of connection weights, did not 
significantly predict future presence among the elite. The only significant and con-
sistent predictor was the amount of contribution, or contribution delta, for all revi-
sions made by the user in the preceding period. In other words, the only statistically 
significant predictor of a given user’s presence in the elite group was the amount of 
content that he or she contributed in the immediately preceding 5-week period.
Figure 5.6 shows the odds ratios for presence in the elite group based upon one’s 
past contributions. Because the contribution metric is represented in small incre-
ments, representing minute changes for each editorial intervention, we multiplied 
each odds ratio by 100,000. This allows us to see the effect of an individual contrib-
uting an additional 100,000 units of effort, or contribution delta, on his or her 
chances of subsequently being in the elite group. The effect is estimated in percent-
ages. That is, we estimate the percent increase in the probability of being in the elite 
in the next 5-week interval, if a member of the nonelite contributes an extra 100,000 
contribution units in the present 5-week interval. Figure  5.6 indicates that after 
week 101, the effect of one’s past contributions on the probability of joining the 
elite is almost always positive—in other words, a greater amount of effort always 
increases the likelihood that a given user will subsequently ascend to the elite group. 
As an example, an increase of 100,000 in a given user’s cumulative contribution 
delta value between weeks 195 and 199 would result in a 10% increase in his or her 
probability of entering (or remaining in) the elite in the week 200–204 interval.

As previously noted, this analysis specifically targets collaborative dynamics as 
they developed after the potential phase (Wenger 1998). To that end, week 101, the 
starting point for this analysis, is also very close to week 92, the boundary between 
the coalescence and stabilization phases identified in the answer to RQ3.
Overall, we observe that the impact of hard work on one’s promotion to elite 
status was greater at the beginning and at the end of the study period, corresponding 
to the coalescence (weeks 101–204) and stabilization (weeks 335–495) intervals. 
Between weeks 101 and 334, corresponding with the rapid growth and maturation 
period previously identified for RQ3, the log odds declined, indicating a weakening 
effect of one’s past contributions on a future rise to the elite group.
To put it in more tangible terms, during the period spanning weeks 101–204, an 
additional 100,000 contribution units generated, on average, an increase of 20% in 
the probability of joining the elite. In the 205–334 interval, the increase in the prob-
ability of joining the elite from each additional 100,000 units of contribution 
declined to an average of 6%. In the last period, however, after week 335, the impact 
of a user’s prior contributions increased once more. Overall, for the entire period, 
the average increase in the probability of joining the elite due to each 100,000 units 
was 11%. And, during the period from weeks 435 through 495, the average proba-
bility was even higher, returning to the 20% value recorded at the beginning of the 
study period. Further, the last statistically significant log odds ratio, obtained for 
weeks 490–494, showed a jump of its own, indicating that 100,000 in contribution 
delta would result in a 45% increase in the likelihood of reaching the elite ranks.
5.3  Looking Back, Looking Forward
The findings presented so far suggest that deep contribution imbalances in social 
media projects with deep contribution imbalances are, in fact, evidence of an evolu-
tionary process. Some members will naturally grow to play high contributor roles, 
and the system will evolve with them in distinct phases of social structuration: 
potential/incubation, coalescence, maturation, and stewardship/stability. Thus, 
social media projects like Wikipedia are not a mere “wise crowd” in which individu-
als perform similar functions with minimal social coordination in approximately the 
same proportion and using roughly the same approach. Social structure and a stable 
elite are also essential to the process. In fact, social structuration leads to “stickier” 
elites, with structuration explaining almost half of the variance in elite stickiness.
Most importantly, we uncovered an apparent causal relationship, as elite sticki-
ness increases only after entropy declines. This means that elites “gel” in their posi-
tions after the project as a whole becomes top-heavy. The top functional elite leaders 
are organically encouraged by the success of their content to stay with the project 
for longer periods of time. Their presence on the project becomes very important, as 
their ceaseless activity becomes increasingly visible and harder to replace due to its 
sheer mass. In addition, functional leaders who have a greater vested interest in the 
project are more likely to return to the site in order to ensure the continuity of their 
5  Analytic Investigation of a Structural Differentiation Model for Social Media…

83
efforts. Thus, the likelihood that their content will be preserved and even increase in 
mass will be enhanced accordingly.
Our findings contradict alternative explanations that claim that contributors 
freely rotate into and out of elite roles as in a game of musical chairs—thus making 
any differentiation between contributors even out over time—and, therefore, that 
any observed inequality would essentially disappear if we took elite turnover into 
account. For this to be true, elite stickiness would have to be almost zero. What we 
found, instead, is that stickiness is relatively high, at 40% across the duration of the 
study.
Finally, we determined that an osmotic model of social promotion based on indi-
vidual effort was more useful for explaining one’s future presence in the elite than 
coeditorial connections to existing elite members. However, this relationship was 
not linear. In particular, during the period of coalescence, hard work did not always 
pay off, or at least not to a substantial degree. This finding might be the result of a 
rapid increase in the number of contributors during that phase. After all, when many 
new contributors join a project at once, the “social dividend,” or probability of rising 
to the elite, declines as competition rapidly intensifies. Only when the project stabi-
lizes does the “social dividend” of hard work begin to pay off for those contributors 
who persisted in their efforts. Toward the end of the study period, for each 100,000 
units contributed during a 5-week period in terms of delta scores, the likelihood of 
joining the elite (or staying in it) increased by 45%. Taken together, these findings 
exemplify the stabilization and “stewardship” phase that we would expect from a 
fully mature collaborative project.
These findings are essential for understanding the formation of social groups 
online, especially on social media, since they rely on an intact data set of an entire 
social medium over almost a decade of activity. Still, in looking forward to Part II 
of this volume, it is important to recognize that the mechanisms described thus far 
are rather basic. They only explain the incubation, coalescence, growth, and stabili-
zation of social media collaborative groups in terms of general trends, referring 
loosely to concepts like adhocracy as omnibus terms to explain the phenomena. 
However, complex projects such as Wikipedia span a variety of work and interac-
tional contexts, some of which may be more traditional than newer ideas like adhoc-
racy would suggest, and many of which demand more nuanced explanations for the 
phenomena at hand.
As we draw Part I of this volume to a close, we still need a clearer understanding 
of the collaborative dynamics behind the contributions that we observed and the 
organizational phenomena that drive them. This includes, crucially, the ways in 
which specific organizational configurations develop as well as how they are entan-
gled with the larger evolutionary process that we have observed thus far.
In the next two chapters, we will propose a more sophisticated interpretation of 
the evolutionary process and a more detailed description and interpretation of the 
adhocracy concept to which we have referred thus far. We have acknowledged the 
conceptual importance of adhocracy as a broad process, but at the same time, when 
it is rigorously applied and defined, it also represents a very specific type of organi-
zational arrangement. For the sake of this second perspective on adhocracy, we need

to consider the multiple facets of the collaborative process and outline the main 
motors and configurations of organizational change and transformation. This 
approach requires the addition of new dimensions to our research, including a more 
complex organizational change model, which will facilitate a more nuanced explo-
ration of online collaborative evolution. These objectives will be addressed at length 
in Part II.

The Foundations of a Theoretical Model 
for Organizational Configurations and Change 
in Online Collaborative Processes
6.1  Introduction
So far, we have presented an evolutionary model for the development and struc-
turation of collaborative groups. We have shown that as collaborative entropy on 
Wikipedia decreased, a stable elite took shape, with the former process driving 
the latter. We have also presented considerable evidence for a process of “adho-
cratic” change in elite behavior and for longitudinal development with distinct 
phases of growth and maturation. However, this analysis captures a global pro-
cess at a high level of abstraction. As such, it does not specify the possible mech-
anisms by which social structuration, which we measured through entropy, 
actually takes place.
In the text that follows, we will develop a more complex theoretical model, 
which includes a set of discrete organizational configurations that may be found in 
the life cycle of a collaborative organization. We will also propose some “motors,” 
or transformative factors, that drive the process of evolution and structuration. This 
model is grounded in organizational communication and organizational behavior 
research, while the empirical testing of these factors is rooted in the more special-
ized field of computational social science.
The remainder of this chapter introduces the long-standing gap in the literature 
at the intersection of organizational configurations and organizational change. 
Chapter 7 delves further into the concept of organizational configurations, which 
has an extensive history in the management literature. Then, in Chap. 8, we unite 
the domain of organizational configurations with that of organizational change 
motors, thereby yielding a synthesized theoretical framework that may be used to 
explain the entire process by which an organization’s form changes over time. We 
then employ this framework in Chap. 9 to determine the mechanisms of online 
social structuration, with the broader ramifications of our findings detailed in 
Chap. 10.

6.2  Toward a Theoretical Explanatory Model 
of Organizational Change in Online Collaborative 
Structures
Our model is rooted in the theoretical perspectives offered by research on organiza-
tional configurations and organizational change. In this context, “configurations” 
refer to patterned and recurring interactions and role allocations, with the concept 
speaking in a more direct way about the processes of social organization and dif-
ferentiation that were introduced in the previous chapter. Organizational change 
research, in turn, deals with why and how large groups of individual communicators 
develop in particular ways or along specific trajectories over time.
Configuration research has proven especially useful for classifying organizations 
into meaningful typologies, while change scholars have emphasized the long-term 
development of organizations as opposed to the examination of mere snapshots in 
time. Yet there has been minimal crossover between these two areas, with a particu-
lar lack of research devoted to organic changes to organizational configurations 
emerging from within the organization itself. More importantly, the literature does 
not offer a clear connection between these areas, nor does it address the issue of 
social structuration in voluntary online organizations in any fashion.
With that in mind, this chapter begins the process of intertwining the domains of 
organizational configurations and organizational change into a synthesized frame-
work of configurational change motors. The goal is to articulate a comprehensive 
theoretical model that can bring the conversation about social structuration, covered 
in the previous chapters within a very broad and abstract terrain, to a more tangible 
and precisely specified reality. The first step is to identify specific types of system-­
level structuration, which in keeping with existing literature (e.g., Mintzberg 1979, 
1989) we will call “organizational configurations.” Second, we will discuss the 
necessity and sufficiency of the configurations identified to date. Third, we will 
derive methods of translating the conceptual definitions of the configurations into 
specific operationalizable concepts. Fourth, we will lay the groundwork for the spe-
cific mechanisms by which configurations change and succeed each other over time 
(Van de Ven and Poole 1995), which will be further developed in Chap. 7.
Our theoretical model extends, on the one hand, the framework of Mintzberg’s 
(1979, 1989) Configurational Array, which integrates many otherwise fragmented 
theories into one simple explanatory mechanism grounded in organizational pro-
cesses and structures that are relatively easy to measure. And, on the other hand, we 
also build upon Van de Ven and Poole’s (1995) system of organizational “motors,” 
which is arguably the single most comprehensive synthesis of existing theories on 
the internal dynamics and environmental forces that propel organizational change.
In brief, this chapter aims to connect our very macro-theoretical proposition 
about structural differentiation, which was delineated in very broad terms through 
its definition and our measurement of it through entropy, with meso- and micro-­
level theories that detail and explain specific organizational configurations as well 
as the transition processes between them. All told, we explain, in especially tangible 
terms, how social structuration emerges and develops over time.
6  The Foundations of a Theoretical Model for Organizational Configurations…

It bears noting that our discussion about organizational configurations 
­distinguishes between configurational archetypes and an organization’s present 
configuration. A configurational archetype is an ideal type, to use Weber’s (1946) 
theoretical concept: a possible and greatly simplified organizational pattern that 
may be found in an organization at a certain point. These archetypes stand as poles 
on a spectrum, representing extreme cases in order to provide a frame of reference 
for understanding. Present configurations, on the other hand, are observable and 
measurable patterns that may closely resemble one configurational archetype or fall 
between two or more archetypal patterns. The distinction is that between the con-
cept itself and the observable instantiation of the concept. It is analogous to the 
distinction between the concept of “organization”—which denotes the idea of a 
group of people who interact with each other according to certain rules, roles, val-
ues, and intended goals—versus the various groups in the world that we identify as 
“organizations.”
Our model utilizes a few common organizational constructs to assess the con-
figurational archetype toward which the present form of an organization is moving 
at any given moment, which thus facilitates the identification of key evolutionary 
trends and revolutionary moments over time. Once these critical change periods and 
instances have been identified, we may then explore a variety of internal and exter-
nal factors in order to assess how they push the organization from one configura-
tional archetype toward another. Thus, the configurations are linked with the change 
motors through a set of conventional organizational measures as well as an interpre-
tive assessment of the motors that contributed to the observed changes, using the 
dichotomy of evolutionary and revolutionary change as a conduit for the theoretical 
integration. This ultimately serves to unite these traditionally disparate research 
areas and permit the assessment of configurational change motors, including those 
that we may readily observe within the increasingly common member-defined 
online organizational configurations throughout the modern world.
6.3  Configurational Change: Critical Theoretical Gap 
and Bridges
Over the past few decades, a great deal of research has been conducted on classify-
ing organizations into meaningful configurations based on the ways in which they 
operate, most commonly focusing on their respective structures, the managerial 
strategies that undergird them, and the core missions that they serve. Numerous 
researchers have devoted substantial attention to the kinds of configurations that 
are commonly implemented within organizations and the consequences of those 
managerial implementations (e.g., Birkinshaw and Lingblad 2005; Davidow and 
Malone 1992; Dess et al. 1997; Handy 1989; Heckscher 1994; Kang et al. 2007; 
Kaufman et al. 2000; Korunka et al. 2003; Kotha and Vadlamani 1995; Lucas 1996; 
Menguc and Auh 2010; Miles and Snow 1986; Mowshowitz 1994; Mueller et al. 
2003; Nair and Filer 2003; Payne 2006; Pegels et al. 2000; Rauch et al. 2004;

Spanos et  al. 2004; Stabell and Fjeldstad 1998; Stordeur and D’Hoore 2007; 
Veliyath and Shortell 1993; Wiklund and Shepherd 2005; Youndt and Snell 2004). 
Together, these scholars have generated, for better or worse, an ever-increasing 
array of organizational characteristics and configurations that describe the particu-
lar systems they have observed across a range of contexts, along with just as many 
explanatory mechanisms for how and why those particular configurations devel-
oped (see Lammers 1988; McPhee and Poole 2001; Winter and Taylor 1996).
An equally rich research tradition can be found in the area of organizational 
change. Scholars vary in their area of interest within the organizational change lit-
erature, with foci running the gamut from stage theories featuring slower evolution-
ary changes punctuated by instantaneous revolutionary changes (e.g., Auzair and 
Langfield-Smith 2005; Flynn and Forman 2001; Gersick 1991; Greiner 1972; 
Hwang and Park 2006; Lester et al. 2003; Levy and Merry 1986; Meyer et al. 1993) 
to integrative concepts like organizational ecology (e.g., Becker 2007; Grote and 
Lang 2003; Monge et al. 2011) as well as the particular forces and motivations 
behind organizational transformations (e.g., Chakravarthy and Lorange 1991; 
Flavell 1982; Hegel 1812; Kimberly and Miles 1980; Matei et al. 2010).
Individually, both organizational configurations and organizational change have 
received substantial attention. But by and large, very little work has been devoted 
toward synthesizing these two areas in order to better study organizational develop-
ment over time. Astley and Van de Ven (1983) pointed out the need for more research 
on configurational change 30 years ago, and in a more recent review of the configu-
rations literature, Short et al. (2008) reiterated the problem that “…change and sta-
bility have not been major foci in recent years” (1067). Even less effort has been 
devoted to connecting organizational configurations and organizational change 
research to the much broader issue of structural differentiation at large, which fur-
ther highlights the persistent gap in the literature.
With that said, it is clear that some scholars of organizational configurations are 
at least moving past the notion of the configuration as a static entity by studying the 
development of organizations over time. In particular, many researchers have 
devoted their attention to processes that extend or transform formally defined orga-
nizational structures (e.g., Carley and Svoboda 1996; Chan 2002; Cross et al. 2001; 
de Toni and Nonino 2010; Han 1996; Kratzer et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2002; Macintosh 
and Maclean 1999; Markus et al. 2002; Peng et al. 2004; Pullman and Dillard 2010; 
Schonpflug and Luer 2013; Shi 2010; Škerlavaj and Dimovski 2013; Uhl-Bien 
2006), although few of these researchers have used their findings either to define 
new configurations or to classify organizations based on existing configurations. 
Furthermore, much of this work has only considered the initial emergence of such 
alternative structures or has treated them as static entities to merely be contrasted 
with formally defined organizational configurations—such as the informal commu-
nication that occurs outside the bounds of an official organizational chart—so the 
development of those emergent structures has remained largely unexplored. 
Nonetheless, these studies at least serve as a first step toward understanding the 
longitudinal development of emergent configurations and toward connecting spe-
cific configurations to stages, like those described earlier in this volume, in a more 
conceptual structural differentiation process.
6  The Foundations of a Theoretical Model for Organizational Configurations…

91
As a whole, insufficient work has connected organizational configuration theory 
with existing theories on organizational change as it occurs over time. Siggelkow 
(2002) and Tyrrall and Parker (2005) serve as notable exceptions, but these are iso-
lated examples that, importantly, remain confined to institutionally imposed con-
figurations. By and large, few scholars have considered the types of change that 
organizational configurations undergo or the forces that drive those changes, par-
ticularly within the realm of emergent configurations.
This inattention may be due in part to overlapping and inconsistent terminology 
use. As Short et al. (2008) explained, configurational research has been conducted 
under many different names, and definitions of several key terms have varied sig-
nificantly among scholars. Most of those differences arose between scholars from 
different disciplines whose respective literatures rarely intersect, highlighting the 
need for scholars to bridge disciplinary gaps and connect useful frameworks and 
theories with one another.
Further, some scholars have employed the term “configuration” itself toward 
other ends. For instance, “network configuration” refers to structural elements 
embedded within a larger network, from micro-level relations such as simple dyads 
and triads to higher-level tendencies like reciprocity and transitivity (Robins et al. 
2007; Shumate and Palazzolo 2010; Snijders et  al. 2006). Since organizational 
structures themselves are often a key criterion for classifying organizations into 
configurations and network configurations offer a natural (if underused) means of 
measuring those structures, this subtle terminology conflict is especially problem-
atic for organizational configuration researchers. In fact, network configurations 
have themselves been connected with many different change theories, of which the 
most notable may be evolutionary and ecology theories (see Monge et al. 2011 for 
a review). Since the key term “configurations” has already been extensively used in 
the intertwining of network configurations with well-established change theories, 
that literature inadvertently masks the lack of a similar connection between organi-
zational configurations and theories that would explain changes between them, as 
well as the related gap between the ideas of structural differentiation and 
evolution.
This literature gap is especially salient in the context of online voluntary organi-
zations, such as sites like Wikipedia that were formed from user-generated content. 
After all, one of the very few areas in which organizational configuration research 
has focused on configurational changes has been the acknowledgement that emer-
gent communication systems and organizational structures can arise from formally 
defined configurations, and even then, too little work has been done on the long-­
term change and growth of those emergent structures. Even less attention has been 
devoted to those organizations with no initial formal structure, whose configura-
tions are defined from the very beginning solely by the actions of their members.
This particular gap is, in large part, a consequence of circumstance. Two decades 
ago, few could have imagined an organization that could (a) accumulate enough 
members to be defined in a more interesting and nuanced way than “team” or “small 
group,” (b) survive long enough to grow and transform in any meaningful manner, 
and (c) do so with neither an external incentive system nor an organizational chart

explicitly defined by a managerial system. Yet, with the advent of the Internet and 
of online collaborative platforms, it has become clear that organizations can emerge 
with little more than a name and an objective for members to fulfill and ultimately 
blossom into massive communities on par with the largest, most active and success-
ful corporations in the world.
It is worth recognizing that developing an organizational configuration in this 
way, with minimal boundaries and resources for members, may be a viable approach 
for some offline organizations as well, even if online communities served as the first 
examples. With that said, the Internet offers an inexpensive space for communica-
tion and collaboration at any location and any time of day, reducing the risk for 
those who wish to undertake such an endeavor and increasing access to free (or at 
least cheap) labor. As such, it is obvious that the online domain does make Wikipedia-­
like efforts more feasible than they would be through face-to-face interactions 
alone.
6.4  Conclusion
As a whole, we have observed that it is possible for organizational configurations to 
be defined by their members from the very beginning, in contrast with other emergent 
configurations that instead merely adapt or escape an established formal structure. 
The process by which such a freely constructed configuration matures and grows, 
being actively defined and redefined by its members as the organization itself moves 
forward, is an entirely different dynamic that itself demands attention. As such, in 
addition to uniting the domains of organizational configurations and organizational 
change, this chapter also serves as an early endeavor into the study of configurations 
which do not emerge from institutionalized structures but which are initially formed 
and subsequently shaped only by the individuals embedded within them.
While a limited number of analyses have showcased how particular organiza-
tions move from one configuration to another, including those emergent structures 
that extend from formal hierarchies, not enough work has targeted changes that 
occur over long periods of time and the particular reasons why organizational con-
figurations change in the ways that we have observed. Fewer studies still have con-
nected case-specific causes for configurational changes with an established, 
generalizable theoretical framework that would explain long-term changes across 
organizations and contexts.
Our work, then, will intertwine these distinct frameworks. We delineate a set of 
key metrics that can be used to identify both periods of gradual evolution and 
moments of dramatic revolution in online and offline organizations alike, then 
extend this measurement approach to show how we can determine the ways in 
which an organizational configuration developed over time, and finally demonstrate 
a procedure to discern the motors that caused the configurational changes that have 
been identified. These constitute the critical objectives that we will address in the 
remainder of Part II.

Organizational Configurations 
and Configurational Change
7.1  Introduction
The first step in setting up the synthesized theoretical framework described in Chap. 6, 
which lays the groundwork for analyzing and understanding the full process of emer-
gent organizational change—especially the changes observed in online organizations 
like Wikipedia—is to unite the storied domain of organizational configurations with 
the basic change dichotomy of evolution and revolution. This initial interweaving of 
concepts will facilitate the subsequent integration of organizational change motors, 
thereby yielding a powerful theoretical framework to serve future work in this area.
As such, this chapter explores the area of organizational configurations and links it 
with the evolutionary and revolutionary changes that we may observe in those configu-
rations. We start by assessing the model laid out by Mintzberg (1979), significantly 
expanding on it by developing a comprehensive protocol to align any given organiza-
tion with Mintzberg’s theoretical archetypes. This is then connected, on both a concep-
tual and a measurement level, with the evolutionary and revolutionary changes that we 
may observe in those configurations, thereby yielding a new approach for researchers 
to directly observe and comprehend the development of organizational configurations 
over time. This is a vital piece of our larger theoretical model that specifies the mecha-
nisms through which social structuration occurs in online collaborative groups.
7.2  Organizational Configurations
7.2.1  Configurations and Archetypes
One of the most important yet controversial methods for studying organizations is 
classifying them based on their respective configurations. A considerable amount of 
research has been devoted to this topic over the past 30  years, with multiple 

98
taxonomies and typologies emerging (see McPhee and Poole 2001 for an extensive 
review). This domain represents an attempt by scholars to move past analyzing 
where an organization falls on the spectra of a limitless number of attributes and 
toward synthesizing theory into a finite set of organizational forms which may be 
readily used for descriptive and prescriptive purposes.
The main allure of such classification schemes is their parsimony. Condensing 
the results of countless organizational measures into a few critical archetypes allows 
practitioners to steer their organizations toward a desired, time-tested structure or at 
least to coax an emergent structure in a positive direction from above or from within. 
This is a much more effective strategy than merely working to match the scores of 
quantitative metrics which, in the first place, only indirectly tap into the underlying 
constructs of interest. Configurations, seen as concepts, are also useful for analysts 
trying to study differences between subsets of organizations, as those subsets can be 
constructed heuristically based on matching configurations, and those configura-
tions themselves typically integrate many otherwise divergent bodies of literature 
on various aspects of organizational structure.
Still, this approach has its share of detractors (see McPhee and Poole 2001, 514–
515). In particular, as McPhee and Poole note, many scholars vigorously challenge 
the notion of casting organizational structures into rigid groups, rightly arguing that 
no real organization can be expected to represent a pure version of any classification. 
Given this fact, we sacrifice a great deal of information when we ignore the impuri-
ties in any organization’s true configuration by defining it based upon an archetype.
Opponents of such classification systems therefore advocate treating the factors 
that would define a typology as spectra rather than exclusive groups. As they argue, 
just as restricting the concept of “color” to the seven well-known shades of the rain-
bow would needlessly cast aside all the other tints and hues, arbitrarily limiting the 
literature to a finite number of organizational structures would necessarily mean 
discarding an infinite number of intermediate and combination forms.
It is possible, however, to achieve the benefits of existing organizational classifi-
cations while avoiding the trap of overclassification. Rather than merely seeking the 
configurational archetype closest to a given organization and defining it accord-
ingly, we may instead examine several commonly measured organizational charac-
teristics and then use them to describe the configuration, or variation, that the 
organization holds. Because these measures themselves take on spectra of possible 
values, they may be used to discern the degree to which an organization resembles 
a range of different configurations rather than wrongly treating it as a perfect 
­representation of a single archetype. In other words, the pure configurations are 
treated as poles on a spectrum, and this approach simply measures how closely the 
organization in question fits each of those poles. To use our earlier analogy, while 
we are certainly right to acknowledge that there are infinite shades between orange 
and red, it is still useful to have something that we can just call “red.”
Additionally, using common organizational measures to classify organizations 
into configurations provides a secondary benefit in its own right, greatly simplifying 
the often-complicated classification process. The approach articulated in this chap-
ter may therefore serve as a guide for others who want a parsimonious, straightfor-
ward method of classifying organizations of all types.
7  Organizational Configurations and Configurational Change

99
7.2.2  Mintzberg’s Configurational Array
Henry Mintzberg (1979, 1989) is responsible for what is arguably the most highly 
respected and widely used set of organizational configurations in the literature (for 
prominent examples of use, see Boumgarden et al. 2012; Finkelstein et al. 2009; 
Fiss 2011; Ireland et al. 2009; McPhee and Zaug 2009; Rainey 2003). Mintzberg’s 
Configurational Array, as it has come to be known, shares many similarities with 
prior taxonomies of organizational configurations, combining them into a theoreti-
cally satisfying system of organizational sectors, processes, and configurations that 
formed the foundation for much of the modern configuration literature.
Mintzberg’s typology focuses on the structural form that an organization holds, 
as well as the processes and systems that support and maintain that structure, allow-
ing it to be more easily generalized across domains than other configurational typol-
ogies that focus more on the size of the organization, the industry in which it is 
embedded, and other context-specific features. This chapter refers to Mintzberg’s 
configurations as “organizational configurations” or simply “configurations” in 
order to maintain consistency with the literature. However, to be clear, Mintzberg’s 
organizational configurations are defined by the organization’s structural form, so 
these structural forms represent the focal point of much of the present chapter.
With that in mind, Mintzberg’s Configurational Array was originally (1979) 
grounded in five organizational coordination mechanisms: direct supervision, stan-
dardization of work processes, standardization of work outputs, standardization of 
work skills, and mutual adjustment through informal communication. These formed 
the foundation for his five original configurational archetypes, which he termed 
simple structure (or entrepreneurial), machine bureaucracy, professional bureau-
cracy, diversified (or divisionalized), and adhocracy, the last of which, as we have 
previously mentioned, takes on a much more specific definition here than the generic 
concept used in Part I of this book.
Briefly, the entrepreneurial organization resembles the classic “mom-and-pop” 
store, with a single leader directly managing a collection of loosely organized sub-
ordinates. This stands in contrast with the more rigid, hierarchical machine bureau-
cracy, as well as the professional bureaucracy, the latter of which relies more on the 
efforts of its lower-level members, the “operating core,” than the hierarchy through 
which orders are disseminated from the top to the bottom. The diversified organiza-
tion is split into a number of nearly autonomous divisions, operating much like 
franchises of a restaurant chain, thus drawing control away from the top toward each 
individual unit. Finally, an adhocracy features project teams that overlap with one 
another and may disperse and reform organically, without clearly defined, perma-
nently occupied roles. Notably, structure is not absent from adhocracies; what 
makes them different is the ad hoc nature of their structures and the order in which 
various actors occupy an assortment of positions and roles over time.
Mintzberg later (1989) added two additional processes—the standardization of 
norms and political conflict (the latter of which opposes coordination)—which are 
essential for two further configurations, the missionary organization and the ­political 
7.2  Organizational Configurations

100
organization, respectively. However, the political configuration is rarely seen ­outside 
of the political realm itself, as most organizations would quickly disintegrate if their 
dominant processes were those of political warfare. For that matter, political sys-
tems are generally comprised of multiple parties with mutually exclusive goals, in 
contrast with most organizations that have at least one primary shared objective that 
pervades the system. Since calling a political system an “organization” would strip 
the term of much of its meaning, most scholars have since come to ignore the politi-
cal configuration.
Similarly, a missionary organization generally has its ineffable mission instilled 
within it from the beginning such that only a very specific set of organizations, such 
as religious sects, can ever be realistically classified as missionary organizations. As 
such, much like the political configuration, many scholars ignore the missionary 
configuration due to similar limitations and focus only on the five core configura-
tions that Mintzberg (1979) originally devised.
As Mintzberg argued, different parts of an organization may use various coordi-
nation mechanisms to exert pressure on the organization itself and pull it toward a 
particular manner of functioning. For instance, the chain of middle management, or 
“middle line,” as Mintzberg called it, may take advantage of its ability to directly 
supervise other workers, with each manager systematically issuing orders to a group 
of subordinates, in order to push the organization toward the machine bureaucracy 
archetype. It should come as no surprise, then, that any given part of an organization 
tends to be associated with a single coordination mechanism, which in turn drives 
the organization toward one particular configuration.
More broadly, the five primary archetypes and the processes that generate them 
are directly related to several structural dynamics that occur within organizations 
(Mintzberg 1979). The leader who stands atop a simple structure, for instance, holds 
command over decision-making and stands at the peak of a free-form, organic struc-
ture with minimal differentiation among the other organizational members. The 
machine bureaucracy maintains that locus of power at the top of the organization, 
but with its leaders imposing a fixed hierarchy upon subordinates such that there is 
minimal intermixing among unrelated work groups. On the other hand, the profes-
sional bureaucracy is characterized by a great deal of control being ceded to the 
operating core at the bottom of the hierarchy, so organizational power is not nearly 
as localized among a small clique of leaders and behavior is not as formalized as it 
is within the more rigid machine hierarchy.
Within a diversified organization, the structure is fragmented into a number of 
largely distinct divisions, each of which maintains its own structure and strict stan-
dards for activity such that the organization’s activities as a whole are somewhat 
decentralized, yet the leaders continue to serve as a vital link between the disparate 
units. And lastly, the final archetype, that of an adhocracy, features an organic struc-
ture similar to that of the simple structure, but with the flexibility to form self-­
directed project teams as needed based on the specialized skills of their members 
and without an entrenched leader necessarily dominating the structure from the top. 
Yet, adhocracy should not be confused with a total lack of organizational structure. 
Again, its distinguishing feature is the flexibility of roles and attributes, which is 
7  Organizational Configurations and Configurational Change

101
supported by the members’ ability and willingness to take over specific roles and 
abandon them as needed.
Importantly, Mintzberg’s Configurational Array is defined by the extent to which 
a particular component pulls the organization toward a structure that benefits itself, 
which implicitly allows the typology to handle hybrid or in-between organizational 
configurations well—these, after all, would be represented by the transition or 
struggle for control between competing sectors. As such, Mintzberg’s typology 
avoids falling into the trap of needlessly forcing all organizations to fit within a 
finite set of overly rigid, extreme archetypes, instead allowing for a spectrum of 
organizations to be observed. Furthermore, regardless of the organizational struc-
ture that is formally prescribed, any functional configuration might ultimately 
emerge as the dominant mechanism, as different parts of the organization may pull 
the system into a configuration that better serves their respective designs.
In short, Mintzberg’s Configurational Array is perhaps the single most prominent 
set of organizational configurations in the literature, offering a useful, theoretically 
driven synthesis of many other classification systems. It offers researchers a straight-
forward way to conceptualize and identify various organizational configurations, 
and it grants practitioners a natural mechanism for evaluating and managing their 
own organizations. The typology makes use of several well-defined and often-­
implemented organizational forms, and by focusing on the influences that shape a 
configuration rather than merely the end result, it effectively accounts for hybrid 
organizational forms and facilitates the observation of a range of intermediate clas-
sifications between the archetypes. As such, Mintzberg’s Configurational Array rep-
resents an optimal tool to observe and define an organization’s configuration as well 
as its transitions between distinct configurations.
7.3  Configurational Change
7.3.1  Configurations and Change in Virtual Organizations
Our next major step, then, is to draw a conceptual connection between organiza-
tional configurations and organizational change. Yet in order to understand the 
importance of combining these two frameworks, one must first recognize the limita-
tions of classifying organizations using static configurations alone.
Online groups such as Wikipedia serve as a particularly useful example of such 
limitations, as one of the biggest disputes among researchers who have studied 
Wikipedia is the particular configuration that it holds. Much of this debate originally 
stemmed from Wikipedia’s longtime slogan, which labeled it “The free online ency-
clopedia that anyone can edit” (Fallis 2008; Wikipedia 2012) and which implied 
that such an open organization would eschew any restrictive organizational hierar-
chies and result in equal rights among all members. Some (e.g., Faucher et al. 2008; 
Jemielniak 2012) have argued that Wikipedia’s lack of formal stratification in its 
7.3  Configurational Change

102
organizational structure and the prioritization of consensus over control necessarily 
imply a lack of order, with members engaging with one another within an anarchy 
that is largely free of rulings imposed from above. Besides, as Mateos-Garcia and 
Steinmueller (2006) pointed out, a number of top contributors have perceived at 
least a degree of anarchism within Wikipedia, as has founder Larry Sanger (2006, 
323; see also Wikimedia 2011), further evoking notions of egalitarianism and the 
so-called wisdom of crowds (Shirky 2008; Surowiecki 2004).
Others have belied this notion and claimed that, contrary to popular belief, the 
system of Wikipedia editors closely resembles a formalized bureaucracy, in which a 
few key individuals hold all the power and command those at the lower levels of the 
organization, just as we are accustomed to observing and experiencing in traditional 
hierarchies. Such scholars, such as Butler et al. (2008), have noted that Wikipedia 
holds a relatively small administrative staff (1,281 administrators, 22 bureaucrats, 
and 30 stewards as of January 29, 2017), a small subset of the millions of Wikipedia 
contributors. These leaders collectively designed the community’s rules and arbi-
trate any disputes, taking the authority out of the hands of the masses (Wikimedia 
2013; Wikipedia 2013a, b). Viégas et al. (2007) likewise argued that the wiki frame-
work itself is uniquely suited to authoritative control. Beyond this, a number of 
researchers have noted the prevalence of the Pareto principle on Wikipedia (e.g., 
Bruno 2010; Ehmann et al. 2008; He 2011; Matei and Bruno 2015), ultimately 
demonstrating that 80–90% of the encyclopedic content was generated by a minor-
ity group encompassing 1% of the editors (see Ortega et al. 2008 for the early stages 
and Matei and Bruno 2015 for more recent history). Some may argue that these 
findings suggest that the organization’s power is localized at the top of a relatively 
strict hierarchy, even if that hierarchy rests beneath the surface of the organization 
(Matei and Dobrescu 2011). Finally, to further drive home the point, Müller-Seitz 
and Reger (2010) showed that even Wikipedia contributors themselves perceive 
their organization to be bureaucratic, in stark contrast with the flexible anarchic 
system that others have long suspected the community represents.
But this perception, too, is contested. A few scholars (e.g., Jameson 2011; 
Konieczny 2010) have more recently claimed that Wikipedia instead represents an 
adhocracy thanks to its organic structure and lack of formalization (see Mintzberg 
1989). While Wikipedia indeed has a structure, these scholars argue, it is not explic-
itly defined in the same manner as a bureaucracy, so it may freely change to suit its 
own needs (Matei and Dobrescu 2011). Furthermore, the division of Wikipedia into 
millions of articles, or focused “project teams,” would also seem to align with the 
notion of an adhocratic structure (Pamkowska 2008). It is possible that an elite 
group eventually solidified at the top of the organization, as Ortega et al. (2008) 
argued, or that the top contributors change from week to week, a belief that many 
who believe in an anarchic Wikipedia espouse. Scholars like Konieczny (2010) and 
Matei and Dobrescu (2011), however, claim that any such leadership roles are 
dynamic, emerging from behavior within the organization and subject to significant 
change over time, rather than representing inscribed positions defined by a set of 
bureaucratic heads.
7  Organizational Configurations and Configurational Change

103
Clearly, Wikipedia appears to share traits with many different organizational 
forms. Even Wikipedians themselves have been unable to conclusively determine 
what configuration their own system follows (Wikimedia 2012), especially since 
numerous alternative terms such as republic, despotism, and plutocracy have been 
proposed to describe the community. It is little wonder, then, that scholars have long 
debated which theoretical form is the most accurate representation of the knowledge-­
construction community (see O’Neil 2010 for a focused review of the debate). In 
light of Wikipedia’s importance to users around the world, it would certainly 
behoove organizational scholars to conclusively determine this fundamental detail 
about how the system as a whole operates.
Yet in truth, the bigger point is not merely the question of whether Wikipedia is 
an anarchy, a bureaucracy, an adhocracy, or something else. It isn’t even that schol-
ars have been unable to agree on what, exactly, Wikipedia and other online collabo-
ration groups are. Rather, the point is that all of these arguments over online 
organizational configurations miss a critical issue: online collaborative groups, like 
any other organization, are not static. They have grown considerably over the years, 
and much like the McDonald’s fast-food chain now hardly resembles the single 
restaurant from which the international powerhouse originated (Mieth 2007), it is 
likely that the structures of online collaborative groups, especially Wikipedia, have 
undergone substantial transformations over the course of their development.
As such, we are free to speculate that Wikipedia, as well as any other collaborative 
group, may have been an anarchy, a bureaucracy, and an adhocracy at various points 
in time, and it may have also held any number of other organizational configurations 
that one might envision. Furthermore, it could be that Wikipedia was founded in such 
a way that it evolved along a substantially different course than other organizations 
that have failed, moving toward a more novel organizational form than its fallen peers, 
or it could be that Wikipedia, like many traditional offline organizations, became 
increasingly rigid and bureaucratic as it expanded, and that it simply emulated particu-
lar aspects of an archetypal organizational form better than its competitors.
In order to clarify the organizational configuration or configurations that online 
collaborative groups may have held over time, we will consider the case of Wikipedia 
on a much deeper level. Understanding the transitions that an organization makes 
between different organizational configurations, after all, necessarily illuminates 
the organizational configurations themselves. Further, prior studies of Wikipedia’s 
early years (Britt 2011; Matei et al. 2015) suggest that the structure of Wikipedia 
progressed through transitional stages over the course of its development, so it is 
reasonable to suspect that the Wikipedia coeditorial community may have also 
cycled through a number of different configurations over time. This would, after all, 
explain why there is such little agreement about the particular organizational con-
figuration that Wikipedia, which is often envisioned as a static, monolithic entity, 
holds. It is with this in mind that we begin to build upon the framework of organiza-
tional configurations by turning to the two primary classes of organizational change: 
evolution and revolution.
7.3  Configurational Change

104
7.3.2  Evolutionary and Revolutionary Change
Many organizational change scholars (e.g., Greiner 1972, 1994; Mezias and Glynn 
1993) have historically dichotomized the concept of change into two primary 
classes: evolution and revolution. The distinction in the dichotomy is largely a mat-
ter of timing, or the speed at which significant change occurs, whether modest and 
gradual or dramatic and immediate (Gersick 1991; Levy and Merry 1986).
Revolution, as the term implies, denotes moments of rapid, significant change, 
akin to the act of deposing a king or dictator, which can sharply divert the course of 
a nation’s history. As Greiner (1972) defines it, “The term revolution is used to 
describe those periods of substantial turmoil in organization life.” Relative to the 
long-term growth that we might otherwise observe, such a revolution generally 
occurs in an instant, as a sudden, decisive moment in history. As a result of the revo-
lution, be it the overhauling of a corporate hierarchy or the overthrowing of a ruler, 
the organization is forever changed. This change may constitute the reassignment or 
reversal of roles for members of the organization, or it could entail the development 
of a completely new role or system of roles altogether, as evidenced by changes in 
some central measures of social organization and structuration, such as entropy, as 
suggested above.
This stands in contrast with much slower evolutionary changes that occur gradu-
ally, as the organization shifts slowly, almost imperceptibly, toward a new standard, 
norm, policy, framework, or goal. For instance, daily tasks may become entrenched 
as regimented routines, accruing value and subtly pulling the organization toward 
actions that would maintain them as a standard practice, or they may instead falter 
over time as organizational members find merit in alternative approaches and incre-
mentally deviate from the original routine, with those members pushing the 
­organization away from past methods and toward standards that they deem superior. 
While revolution implies a sharp change in trajectory, we may conceive of evolution 
as an organization following its existing momentum for a period of time (Miller and 
Friesen 1980), with greater stability in behavioral norms and in the operational 
characteristics of the organization in the long term.
Revolutionary and evolutionary change offer, as a pair, a comprehensive repre-
sentation of all organizational change. Either an organization changes instantly, 
with the community suddenly shocked into a new mode or form, or it undergoes a 
much smoother, incremental change. The difference is not strictly one of time but of 
the degree of structural change—in other words, the contrast is that between an 
abrupt break and a gradual curve, one of which is a much more severe, jarring shift 
than the other. Some evaluation may be necessary to properly classify observed 
changes into these two groups, of course, but the simplicity of this dichotomy, with 
the categories of change very broadly defined, is what allows for its 
comprehensiveness.
As a caveat, some scholars (especially Levy and Merry 1986) argue for a con-
tinuum of change between evolution and revolution rather than the present dichot-
omy of timings. However, these arguments have largely been grounded in the dual 
7  Organizational Configurations and Configurational Change

105
ideas that evolutionary change may be too slow for managers to deem it a successful 
strategy and that revolutions can likewise damage an organization, rather than sub-
stantial evidence that the evolutionary-revolutionary dichotomy is incorrect. In 
other words, the arguments against this dichotomy are based only on how some 
scholars think organizations ought to operate as opposed to what researchers have 
actually observed.
More importantly, organizations may very well be subject to both types of 
change, with gradual evolutionary trends punctuated by moments of revolution. 
These two types of change, then, combine to represent the full progression of orga-
nizational change as it occurs over time. Greiner (1972) offered one of the most 
famous examples of such a model, presenting a growth process consisting of five 
evolutionary phases culminating in crises that must be overcome through a suitable 
revolution. With this conceptualization in mind, one could presumably measure any 
particular organizational attribute over time, chart the way it changed during the 
organization’s development, and quickly identify those periods of evolutionary 
change (stable linear and curvilinear trends) and revolutionary change (sharp jumps 
or breaks from the prior trend). This conceptualization is used below to describe 
Wikipedia and, by extension, similar online collaborative communities.
7.3.3  Pinpointing Configurational Evolution and Revolution
In what follows we will propose specific conceptual perspectives and measurements 
to characterize organizational configurations. First and foremost, the defining char-
acteristics of organizational configurations can be assessed using five key organiza-
tional dimensions: the structures of collaborative attractiveness and extroversion, 
communication flow, partner choice trends, and structural order.
Collaborative attractiveness is the extent to which organizational members are 
drawn toward interactions with a few particular elites, while collaborative extrover-
sion refers to the efforts of a few especially active individuals to seek out interac-
tions with others throughout the community, well beyond the interaction-seeking 
behaviors of their peers. Communication flow describes the extent to which a small 
set of especially well-positioned members control the interactions between larger 
constituencies by serving as the primary conduits connecting otherwise largely dis-
tinct groups. The partner choice trends dimension refers to the tendency for organi-
zational members to form and build relationships with specific types of peers based 
on mutual similarities or differences. Finally, structural order describes the extent to 
which an elite group dominates the collaborative process such that contributions 
and the resulting content are centered on their efforts, above and beyond those of 
other contributors.
These dimensions jointly reflect the five coordination mechanisms of direct 
supervision, standardization of work processes, standardization of work outputs, 
standardization of work skills, and mutual adjustment through informal communi-
cation that define Mintzberg’s (1979) configurational archetypes.
7.3  Configurational Change

Briefly, direct supervision, the cornerstone of a simple structure, allows a subset 
of leaders to directly oversee subordinates, becoming the most vocal (extroversion) 
members of the organization as well as those who receive the most communicative 
feedback (attractiveness) and allowing them to assign and reassign tasks and teams 
on a regular basis (structural order). However, given that other organizational mem-
bers would still need to interact with one another in order to perform their roles, 
direct supervision would not necessarily constrain communication flow, especially 
if teams were indeed shuffled over time. Likewise, since individual members would 
have little control over the peers with whom they would interact at any given 
moment, no partner choice trends would be likely to have significant relevance 
within such a model.
In contrast, the standardization of processes, which stands as the hallmark of the 
machine bureaucracy archetype, may only be carried out when a set of leaders takes 
command of information dissemination within the organization (communication 
flow) to direct activities accordingly. Such leaders are likely to find themselves as 
the most frequent communicators (extroversion) as well as those who receive the 
most information from within the organization (attractiveness), though this would 
likely be more of an unintended consequence of controlling the communication 
flow rather than the leaders’ intention. On the other hand, standardizing work pro-
cesses would demand a high degree of structural order, and as work processes 
became increasingly standardized, those performing similar roles would likely be 
grouped together (partner choice trends) in order to further standardize their 
processes.
The standardization of outputs, which pushes an organization toward a division-
alized form, still demands the separation of members performing different tasks or 
otherwise operating in different branches of the organization (partner choice trends), 
and as those distinct units come to engage in minimal direct interaction with one 
another, the organizational leaders assume even greater control over information 
dissemination (communication flow) than in a machine bureaucracy. Such a con-
figuration must be highly structured, of course (structural order), yet as the various 
units gain increasing autonomy from the rest of the organization, the leaders play a 
declining role in directing the day-to-day activities of other members (extroversion) 
and receiving feedback thereafter (attractiveness).
When skills are standardized, on the other hand, there is little need for an exten-
sive leadership structure that would direct (extroversion) and track (attractiveness) 
the organizational activities, nor would such leaders have any need to guide the dis-
semination of information throughout the organization (communication flow). Yet, 
as such a mechanism would lend itself to a professional bureaucracy, the form of the 
organization would still be well defined (structural order), and those members who 
perform similar roles or have similar functional specialties (see Mintzberg 1979, 
354) would likely still be grouped together (partner choice trends).
Finally, the act of mutual adjustment through informal communication necessar-
ily implies a lack of consistent structural order. Like the divisionalized organization, 
there would be no substantial need for leaders to directly manage the process, 
­meaning that structures of attractiveness and extroversion would hold minimal

107
importance. Further, since members would coordinate themselves rather than 
­relying on an entrenched leadership cadre to direct their activities, any leaders that 
were present would hold minimal control over information distribution across the 
organization (communication flow). Similarly, since members would frequently 
adjust their associations with others, rapidly rotating between different small groups 
in an adhocratic manner, we would not expect members to consistently associate 
with similar peers; in fact, members who tend to fill gaps in functional roles within 
various groups might consequently be more likely to interact with peers who are 
substantially different than themselves (partner choice trends).
As illustrated here, the five dimensions of collaborative attractiveness and extro-
version structures, communication flow, partner choice trends, and structural order 
jointly reflect the key processes that define Mintzberg’s (1979) five configurational 
archetypes by further decomposing the associated coordinating mechanisms into 
their behavioral components.
These five key constructs, in turn, are themselves associated with five simple 
measurements: inbound degree centralization, outbound degree centralization, 
betweenness centralization, assortativity, and entropy. Inbound and outbound degree 
centralization, as defined by Freeman (1979), offer a direct summary of how much 
communication is localized around a few key individuals. Both of these measures 
assess how much the communicative activity within an organization is localized 
around a few key individuals, and their measurements effectively serve as ratios 
between the communicative activity of the most prominent organizational members 
and the activity of the entire system as a whole. In short, inbound and outbound 
degree centralization serve as operationalizations of the structures of attractiveness 
and extroversion, respectively, within a given organization.
While high outbound degree centralization would indicate that a small set of 
individuals speak directly to most of the organization, whether to informally con-
verse or to issue explicit directives, high inbound degree centralization would sug-
gest that the “masses” of the organization seek out a few prominent individuals and 
that those leaders are the targets of much more communication than the rest of the 
organization. In a hierarchy, this would be the difference between top-down and 
bottom-up communication. Depending on other structural factors, declining 
inbound and outbound degree centralization could suggest a more extensive hierar-
chy, with more messages between the operating core and the leadership apex pro-
ceeding through or being filtered by intermediate layers of the organization, or it 
could instead indicate the erosion of the leadership position as the organization 
flattens and minimizes its reliance on authority from above.
One of those other structural factors is betweenness centralization, which, like 
the two forms of degree centralization, indicates how much the organization’s power 
is focused around a few key individuals. Unlike degree centralization, however, 
betweenness centralization describes the extent to which the flow of communication 
through the organization must go through particular individuals and, therefore, how 
much control the most prominent individuals have over information in contrast with 
all the other organizational members. In a rigid hierarchy with wholly distinct divi-
sions, for instance, the individual coordinating those divisions from the top would 
7.3  Configurational Change

108
wield tremendous power over the flow of communication through the organization, 
as those distinct divisions would have no means to communicate with one another 
except through their leader. The more rigid the organizational hierarchy grows, the 
more that communication between disparate units must travel through the apex of 
that hierarchy, and the greater the organization’s betweenness centralization will be.
It is also important to assess the degree to which organizational members are 
restricted to interacting with peers in their particular subgroup, or, in other words, 
how much intermixing occurs across organizational levels (i.e., the partner choice 
trends within the organization). The extent to which individuals interact with those 
who are similar to them, as opposed to those who hold a very different standing in 
the organization, may be evaluated using assortativity (Newman 2002). When orga-
nizational leaders tend to interact primarily with fellow leaders and their subordi-
nates, likewise, are drawn to interact with fellow subordinates, the organizational 
network is considered assortative. If, instead, the organization’s leaders engage 
more with those at the bottom of the organization and vice versa, the network is 
more disassortative, with its members routinely crossing traditional status boundar-
ies that might otherwise prevent, for instance, a factory worker from interacting 
extensively with his company’s CEO.
Lastly, the concept of order within the community structure can be operational-
ized using social entropy which, as described by Matei et al. (2010a) and expanded 
upon in Chap. 4, indicates the balance of contributions made to the system (see also 
Bailey 1990; Britt 2013; Shannon and Weaver 1948). When a small subset of the 
population takes control of the collaborative effort and contributes most of the prod-
uct on its own, the organization becomes highly structured around this core group 
of individuals. If, on the other hand, contributions are made relatively evenly across 
the population, no individual or group clearly rises to power, making the organiza-
tional structure flatter and the power dynamic much more entropic. So as a general 
rule, the more entropic the community, the less structured it is and the less predict-
able future activity is.
While equality in contributions across group members is often colloquially con-
sidered to represent pure, perfect collaboration (see Chap. 4), numerous studies 
have shown that in most groups a small core of individuals dominates the interac-
tions and, further, that a degree of inequality in contributions actually improves 
collaboration in both its process and its product (e.g., Bruno 2010; Kittur et al. 
2007; Kuk 2006; Shirky 2008). Although a highly structured organization may 
waste excessive energy maintaining its structure, a completely free-form or flat 
organization can find its efforts stymied by the lack of any clear leadership or direc-
tion as well as redundancy, so some balance between these two structural extremes 
has been proposed as an ideal state for collaboration (Bruno 2010; Kittur et al. 2007; 
Matei et al. 2010b; Shirky 2008). Notably, a degree of contribution inequity has 
previously been found on Wikipedia, with a small set of leading contributors driving 
the majority of the knowledge-construction work (Bruno 2010; Ehmann et al. 2008; 
He 2011; Matei et al. 2015; Ortega et al. 2008), but the stability of this inequity 
remains unclear.
Together, these five constructs allow us to directly observe the extent to which a 
given organization follows each of Mintzberg’s (1989) configurational archetypes. 
7  Organizational Configurations and Configurational Change

109
More specifically, the five organizational dimensions and their accompanying ­metrics 
can be used as a multidimensional scale to characterize these configurations.
Figure 7.1 illustrates the combinations of organizational levels that best represent 
each of the five archetypes. Exact numerical figures are not given for measurements 
of these constructs in order to facilitate easier interpretations, but we may generally 
say that the more closely that a given organization adheres to a particular combina-
tion, the purer a representation it is of the associated configuration.
It may be noted that we would expect the observed patterns of inbound degree 
centralization and outbound degree centralization to be very similar to one another 
within any of the configurational archetypes. Nonetheless, past research (e.g., Britt 
et al. 2011) suggests that it may be worthwhile to examine inbound degree central-
ization and outbound degree centralization separately rather than to combine them 
into a single degree centralization measure. In particular, one form of degree cen-
tralization might shift before the other, offering an earlier indication of a configura-
tional change than what may be observed through a combined assessment, as a 
unified degree centralization measure may mask changes to either of its individual 
components. Furthermore, while inbound and outbound degree centralization 
should be virtually identical within any of Mintzberg’s archetypes, the same may 
not necessarily be true of configurations lying on the spectrum between those arche-
types, so using both measures facilitates the characterization of those intermediate 
organizational forms.
7.4  Conclusion
As a whole, this chapter serves as a theoretical and methodological unification of 
Mintzberg’s Configurational Array (1979) with the conceptual pair of evolution and 
revolution, using five common organizational measures as a tool for classification

purposes. On its surface, this extension of the configuration framework is relatively 
simple, as evolution and revolution merely describe the ways in which an organiza-
tion moves from one configuration to the next. Yet, this seemingly basic conceptual 
integration is essential to enable the change dichotomy to serve as a conduit that 
ultimately connects organizational configurations with organizational change 
motors. With that in mind, the incorporation of organizational change motors, which 
completes the unified theoretical framework, is addressed at length in the next 
chapter.

A Synthesized Theoretical Framework 
for Motors Driving Organizational 
Configurational Change
8.1  Introduction
Now that we have a framework for understanding organizational configurations and 
the manner in which they change over time, we need to unite this with the forces 
that drive those configurational changes. To that end, this chapter introduces the 
concept of organizational change motors, as articulated by Van de Ven and Poole 
(1995), and then serves to synthesize the two historically distinct domains of orga-
nizational configurations and organizational change motors into a unified theoreti-
cal framework, using the basic constructs of evolution and revolution as a conduit 
for this theoretical integration.
8.2  Organizational Change Motors
8.2.1  Organizational Change Motor Typology
The previous two chapters introduced, among other concepts, the dichotomy of 
evolutionary and revolutionary change. It bears repeating that in this context, evolu-
tion refers to the gradual shifts in an organizational configuration over time, a pro-
cess that is punctuated by instantaneous revolutionary changes.
While scholars tend to agree that organizations go through both evolutionary and 
revolutionary change over the course of their development, the literature on the 
reasons why organizations develop in any particular manner has been inconsistent. 
A number of scholars have proposed sets of stages through which organizations will 
inevitably progress throughout their lifetimes (e.g., Burgelman and Sayles 1986; 
Flavell 1982; Kimberly and Miles 1980; Nisbet 1970; Rogers 1983), but with con-
siderable disagreement about which model or models are accurate and which ones 
fail to represent real-world organizations. Others have tended to focus on the roles 

114
that internal and external dynamics play in actively shaping the trajectory of organi-
zational change (e.g., Berger and Luckmann 1966, 1980; Brunsson 1982; 
Chakravarthy and Lorange 1991; Hegel 1812; Weick 1979), but again, with a great 
deal of disagreement about which factors might be important and which of them 
lack impact in reality.
Regardless of these disagreements between scholars, however, the broader claim 
that organizational growth progresses through a series of phases aligns with past 
research (e.g., Britt 2011, 2013). Moreover, when we apply this perspective to col-
laborative online production, such as that which takes place on Wikipedia, we might 
expect to detect a set of phase shifts at critical moments that separate and demarcate 
distinct phases. These phase shifts could represent “critical mass” moments in 
which the project reaches a threshold for growth that can only be surpassed by tran-
sitioning into a new structural form, or they may instead indicate the community’s 
response to some coincidental factors that pushed it into a new way of conducting 
its daily practices. In either case, past research suggests that organizational configu-
rations do in fact undergo significant, revolutionary changes of this sort—we simply 
do not know the reasons for those changes.
With both the importance of organizational change and the historical conflicts 
between change scholars in mind, we turn our attention to Van de Ven and Poole 
(1995), who offered one of the most comprehensive typologies of organizational 
change to date. In constructing this framework, Van de Ven and Poole sought to 
synthesize the four primary classes of change theories—life-cycle, evolutionary, 
dialectical, and teleological—into a single typology describing the forces, or 
“motors,” that drive change.
Let us first briefly summarize these four classifications. Theorists of life-cycle 
change argue that organizations develop like organisms, progressing through a pre-
determined linear sequence toward an inevitable conclusion, with little more flexi-
bility than a railroad car moving down a set of train tracks. Evolutionary theories—not 
to be confused with the “evolutionary change” that is dichotomized with “revolu-
tionary change”—instead focus on the environmental forces that promote and main-
tain the three key evolutionary processes of variation, selection, and retention 
among different organizations and organizational forms. Dialectical theories high-
light conflicts as they emerge between actors with competing goals or values as well 
as the ways in which the resolution of those conflicts may establish new norms 
within the organization and within the interorganizational context. Finally, teleo-
logical theories consider the presumed “final state” of the organization and use 
developments that push the organization toward this end result as the standard for 
judging change, even though this destination itself may change over time such that 
the organization never actually reaches a point of stagnation, stability, or finality.
Among these, the evolutionary and teleological change theories rank as the most 
prominent in the literature (Phillips and Duran 1992), but all four are sufficiently 
established to stand apart from the others (see Levy and Merry 1986). Others have 
proposed additions to Van de Ven and Poole’s typology, especially the social cogni-
tion and cultural approaches to change (see Kezar 2001), but there is still significant 
doubt about whether such additions would offer a significant improvement upon the 
existing typology or merely clutter an otherwise parsimonious explanatory scheme.
8  A Synthesized Theoretical Framework for Motors Driving Organizational…

115
Importantly, Van de Ven and Poole (1995) did not envision these four theories as 
mutually exclusive perspectives that necessarily compete against one another, but as 
classes of potential “motors” for a given organization. They argued that an organiza-
tion may be driven by any number of these four types of motors and that the various 
motors may struggle against each other or play complementary roles in any given 
context.
With that in mind, these four classes of motors vary across two dimensions: 
scope and determinism (see Table  8.1). Evolutionary and dialectic motors arise 
from the interactions between multiple entities, while motors associated with the 
life-cycle and teleological theories focus on the way in which a single unit naturally 
changes over time solely based on its own natural progression or the direct influence 
of a single party on the organization. Likewise, the life-cycle and evolutionary 
frameworks treat certain changes as inescapable, whether they are internally defined 
trajectories imposed upon the organization by those who first established it or envi-
ronmental forces that the organization is powerless to combat, while the dialectic 
and teleological frameworks prioritize the agency of individual actors to challenge 
one another and to spur the organization toward its ultimate purpose, respectively.
In other words, evolutionary motors are the exogenous forces that act upon the 
organization, or the environmental influences to which the organization must adapt 
in order to survive and to thrive. A life-cycle motor is, in essence, the natural pro-
gression of the organization along the largely predestined course that was laid when 
it was first formed. While life-cycle motors emerge from within the organization 
itself, its members cannot easily reshape or resist those motors, much like humans 
can do little to manipulate their own progression through their respective life cycles.
It is therefore largely impossible for organizations to escape either of these 
forces. An organization can, in theory, try to resist either type of motor, but it does 
so at its own peril. An organization that ignores the larger environment in which it 
is embedded is likely to quickly become irrelevant and be abandoned. Likewise, an 
organization that resists its own need to grow and evolve as its makeup changes is 
apt to stagnate and collapse. Either way, the organization must change in order to 
survive. With that said, the members of an organization may be able to exert some 
limited control over certain elements of the change, coaxing the organization in one 
direction or another, but the change itself is largely inevitable.
Dialectic and teleological motors, on the other hand, both represent forces that 
stem from the internal activities of their members rather than circumstances outside 
their control. Dialectic motors emerge from dialogue between individuals within the 
organization. When organizational members disagree upon the direction in which 
they feel the organization needs to progress, they may clash with one another,

­struggling as opposing forces that both aim to move the organization forward in 
their own ways. Often this disagreement manifests as a conflict between change and 
the status quo, and it may result in the organization shifting toward a synthesis of the 
two competing ideas, a victory for one ideology over the other, or an entirely differ-
ent alternative direction.
In contrast, teleological motors come from the force that a single unit imposes 
directly and deliberately on the organization. For instance, when a manager or man-
agerial unit enacts a new policy or standard set of procedures, it constitutes a manip-
ulation of the organization itself, in contrast with a dialectic process that generally 
works between fellow organizational members within the confines of the existing 
organizational framework. Teleological changes are much more fundamental exer-
tions of an individual’s will upon the organization than a mutual, collaborative pro-
cess of reshaping the community, and these more deliberate changes to an 
organization are often further observed and adjusted as time goes on.
It should be noted that regardless of whether internal or external factors are iden-
tified as important motors for change in any particular organization, including 
Wikipedia, the result would not necessarily imply mere technological determinism. 
Even if external factors are particularly important in the development of the organi-
zation, it is quite possible that certain types of individuals tend to play key roles in 
organizations embedded in different contexts, such as the unique combination of 
users who have a great affinity for the developing cyberculture and who take a spe-
cial interest in online organizations (see, for instance, Escobar 1994; Lévy 1997; 
Turner 2006)—a matter of personal agency in determining the internal organiza-
tional dynamic. Likewise, we may conjecture that the environment in which an 
organization resides offers different external restrictions and boundaries than other 
analogous environments, and the organization must chart its course differently in 
order to navigate this environment—again, implying that the organization has its 
own will instead of being passively pushed about like a sailboat adrift at sea.
All told, there is no inherent preference for any one change motor type over the 
others, as different motors are applicable to different situations. Rather, Van de Ven 
and Poole’s (1995) framework is a heuristic taxonomy that was devised to help 
future researchers discern what organizational changes occurred at a given point in 
time, how they were manifest, and why they occurred in the observed manner. 
Importantly, this approach further provides us with a framework to describe the 
ways in which organizations create and manage their own social orders as well as 
how their members socially differentiate themselves over time (see Chap. 2).
With that said, it is worth recognizing that although no single type of change 
motor is necessarily “best” or “worst” across cases, it is quite possible that certain 
motors might be more or less useful in different organizational contexts. As such, 
there may be benefits for organizations whose leaders tailor organizational develop-
ment by facilitating the influence of some motors while limiting the impact of others 
at different points in time, particularly in terms of the rate, direction, and perceived 
forces behind a given organizational change. This issue is discussed in more detail 
near the end of this chapter.

8.2.2  Configurational Change Motors
Taking the literature on both organizational configurations and organizational 
change motors into account, once the key evolutionary periods and revolutionary 
moments of configurational change have been identified, those points in time may 
be explored to determine why the organization developed in the way we have 
observed. In other words, we can assess what motors drove particular configura-
tional changes by using the formal evolutionary and revolutionary changes to con-
nect the heuristically defined configurations with the substantive evolutionary, 
life-cycle, dialectical, and teleological motors that caused shifts between them. 
Thus, by aligning the observed configurational changes with the underlying change 
motors that drove the observed organizational transformations, we may intertwine 
the two domains and uncover the primary configurational change motors that acted 
to push the organization from one organizational configuration to the next.
As for the particular methods used to identify organizational change motors, an 
extensive range of approaches may be used; a comprehensive list of potential meth-
odologies is beyond the scope of this chapter. By and large, however, these tech-
niques tend to be primarily qualitative examinations of interpersonal interactions 
along with organizational and public documents, with a considerable amount of 
subjective interpretation, particularly when comparing motors against one another 
to determine which ones were the more likely causes of a particular configurational 
change. For instance, when examining a particular revolutionary change, care must 
be taken to isolate internal and external forces that might reasonably have the 
observed effect, which coincided with the moment of revolution itself and whose 
lack of influence at other points in time can be explained by other factors (such as 
the motor’s absence or other mitigating motors).
Importantly, the configurational change itself may serve as a litmus test for a 
motor’s validity with respect to the change. If, for example, the revolutionary 
moment described above results in the organization moving from a relatively free-­
form configuration like the simple structure toward a more rigid machine bureau-
cracy or divisionalized configuration, then it is reasonable to ask how or why an 
observed motor would result in the organization becoming more bureaucratic. If we 
are looking for the motors that explain a particular configurational change, it makes 
sense to use the configurational change itself to evaluate the validity of those motors 
as explanatory mechanisms, thereby connecting the frameworks of organizational 
configurations and organizational change motors on a methodological as well as a 
theoretical level.
As a whole, these conceptual interconnections serve to interweave the otherwise 
distinct theoretical frameworks of organizational configurations and organizational 
change motors by using the basic change dichotomy of evolution and revolution as 
a conduit between the two areas. This unification will allow scholars and practitio-
ners alike to take advantage of the heuristic parsimony of Mintzberg’s Configurational 
Array (1979, 1989) to quickly diagnose organizational configurations, while also 
recognizing that those configurations, far from static, are subject to change over 
8.2  Organizational Change Motors

118
time, which we may explore on a more nuanced level via Van de Ven and Poole’s 
(1995) organizational change motors. In short, this synthesis blends a straightfor-
ward configurational diagnostic instrument with a deeper consideration of the causal 
factors driving configurational changes, thereby enriching our understanding of 
both theoretical domains.
8.3  Practical Implications
This chapter serves to complete a new theoretical framework that unites existing 
explanations of the ways in which organizations proceed through evolutionary and 
revolutionary change, the various configurations that organizations adopt, and the 
key organizational and environmental motors that fuel organizational growth. The 
digital age offers countless opportunities for individuals to contribute to an array of 
organizations and help to reshape those communities from the inside, making a 
deeper understanding of how organizations and their configurations change over 
time all the more important.
Both Mintzberg’s Configurational Array (1979, 1989) and Van de Ven and 
Poole’s (1995) organizational motors were designed to unify many competing frag-
mented theories into a single explanatory mechanism. Similarly, this chapter fuses 
two disparate research domains, bringing together ideas and scholars that might 
otherwise remain apart and aiding in the development of unified theories to explain 
online organizational change and social structural development.
All told, this new synthesized framework offers a fundamentally enhanced 
approach to examine the long-term transformation of organizations and to under-
stand the motors that form and reconstitute organizational configurations through-
out their development. Of course, one important question remains: How can we use 
these findings in the real world? More specifically, what if practitioners were to use 
this unified framework to guide decision-making? What can we learn from this new 
theoretical model?
8.3.1  Identifying Existing Informal Configurations
The first lesson to apply stems from the simple fact that communication patterns 
rarely align with formal organizational structures. This is just as true in any com-
pany or nonprofit organization (Kraut et al. 1990) as it is on Wikipedia, where there 
is indeed a hierarchy that features a small group of administrators, but for which 
editing and communication patterns hardly conform to that hierarchy. Certainly, 
some misguided corporate managers may demand that their employees communi-
cate only with coworkers to whom they are officially connected on a formal organi-
zational chart. Such efforts not only stymie the organization and its members; they 
also generally fail.
8  A Synthesized Theoretical Framework for Motors Driving Organizational…

119
Broadly speaking, there will inevitably be conversations that occur outside these 
restrictions—and, in many cases, such “water cooler” conversations spawn the 
most productive, innovative, and collaborative work in the organization. Therefore, 
it is in the best interest of any manager, community organizer, or moderator to 
examine the communication that is happening beyond the formal organizational 
structure. These interactions constitute the emergent structure of the organization—
the form toward which it is gravitating on its own, regardless of any official man-
dates otherwise—which may very well be a configuration that would operate more 
effectively than the formal one that the creators or managers of the organization 
imposed. If that is the case, and if the organization could benefit by being reorga-
nized around this emergent structure, then it would certainly behoove an intelligent 
manager to be able to identify that configuration. This is where Mintzberg’s typol-
ogy comes into play.
Of course, as we have discussed at length, a snapshot does not offer a sufficient 
picture to define an organization. As such, the unofficial communication network, or 
the emergent structure, should be assessed over time in order to see how, indeed, it 
is “emerging.” Doing so will allow an intelligent manager or community creator to 
assess the trajectory of this emergence—Is the unofficial network becoming more 
or less similar to the formal organizational chart? Toward what configuration arche-
type is it moving?—as well as the various motors that might be driving this configu-
rational change.
Understanding these issues will allow a smart organizational “instigator” a 
means to assess the communicative health of his or her organization, including the 
relevance of the formal communication structure in the actual day-to-day activities 
of the organization members.
8.3.2  Influencing Informal Configurations
With that in mind, it stands to reason that if an organization’s creator, moderator, or 
manager can gain extra insight into his or her organization by assessing the configu-
rations represented by its informal communication networks, then it might be 
worthwhile for the leaders or moderators to influence those informal configurations 
in order to serve organizational interests in the long run.
It should first be noted that such deliberate efforts are not always appropriate, and 
in fact, the emergent communication structure is often superior to one that a mod-
erator or leader might impose. After all, when users or organization members go out 
of their way to interact with others with whom they are not “officially” connected, 
it is often out of necessity (see, for instance, Krackhardt and Stern 1988), to take 
advantage of a unique opportunity (Kraut et al. 1990), to obtain a more diverse 
­perspective (Burt 1995), or to otherwise improve their work and the company itself. 
Why, indeed, should such communication be discouraged?
Further, even if the informal configuration is developing in a manner that greatly 
diverges from the formal communication network, this is also not necessarily a 
8.3  Practical Implications

120
problem. It could be that an internal or external need or opportunity is driving the 
shift, or the emerging configuration might merely be part of the next stage in the 
organization’s life cycle—perhaps it has outgrown its old form, and the formal orga-
nizational chart simply has not caught up to the new communication network.
For that matter, there is likely some benefit in allowing communication beyond 
that of a rigidly defined formal organizational chart, whether in online communities 
or in businesses. In such contexts, members or employees who feel free to interact 
with their peers as they please, rather than being ordered to interact with some indi-
viduals while remaining forbidden to speak to others, will likely be happier, more 
creative, more dedicated, and generally more productive as a result. Beyond this, an 
overly controlling manager who compels especially rigid patterns of interaction can 
sometimes push subordinates away, giving them cause to deliberately interact with 
those outside their assigned cadre simply as a momentary escape. Consequently, 
when the informal communication network wildly diverges from the formal con-
figuration, it may be a sign that management has been too restrictive and that it may 
be worthwhile to allow employees a bit more freedom and flexibility than they have 
previously been given.
Yet, there may be some cases, such as in business organizations that extend 
online, in which a manager does need to exert a degree of control over the develop-
ing informal communication configurations. As an extreme example, if a few muti-
nous employees are fueling unrest within the company, then they may need to be 
removed and, more broadly, the organization may need to be reconfigured in order 
to prevent future cliques of dissatisfied subordinates from wreaking similar havoc in 
the future. More commonly, communication that occurs outside the bounds of an 
organizational chart may distract employees or lead to the spread of rumors and 
other disinformation more quickly than it can be contained or counteracted.
Either way, and across various online and offline organizations, a smart leader, 
creator, or moderator will consider the alignment of formal and informal communi-
cation networks with one another and will evaluate the manner in which they are 
changing over time, whether they are growing in tandem or in competition with one 
another. A leader who is flexible in considering alternative organizational configura-
tions will be able to adapt his or her organization to suit its ideal form—perhaps the 
one that its members are already trying to adopt on their own—rather than being 
tied to an outdated, historical structure. In other words, forward-thinking leaders 
can use this approach to seek opportunities for positive change rather than being 
married to the past.
Sadly, though, as Crampton et al. (1998) noted almost two decades ago, manag-
ers rarely take an active role in guiding or even swaying the informal communica-
tion networks of their organization’s members, especially in more formal settings, 
which may straddle offline and online environments. Little has changed since their 
initial study. The importance of informal configurations has largely been neglected 
in orchestrating complex organizations, especially collaborative ones, with leaders 
neglecting to use their influence to affect or even monitor such activities. Left 
unchecked, a detrimental informal configuration can undermine the entire group’s 
activities, driving member discontent and internal strife. When this happens, groups 
suffer and slowly die.

8.3.3  Inciting Formal Configurational Change
As suggested above, there are many benefits in terms of both user satisfaction and 
effective collaboration to be derived from allowing organizations of all kinds—and 
especially online collaborative ones—to develop along a path set forth by their 
members, especially if doing so leads to member-inspired innovation. This is just as 
true of formal organizational configurations as it is of any informal communication 
networks.
However, it is sometimes appropriate for leaders and organizers, formal or infor-
mal, to guide an organization themselves in order to deliberately shape its growth 
rather than leaving it up to the collective judgment of their less influential peers. 
This frequently occurs on Wikipedia, and such activities can be used as exemplars 
for the development and maintenance of collaborative online organizations. After 
all, emergent communication structures in such environments sometimes develop 
out of self-interest rather than with the organization’s goals in mind, and even well-­
meaning beginning or intermediate users or members often lack the wide-ranging 
perspective that a community leader or creator with a bird’s-eye view of the organi-
zation has in orchestrating interaction patterns. With that in mind, a leader or col-
laborative community organizer may wish to influence two interrelated elements of 
the formal organizational structure: the configuration toward which the organization 
is moving, and the motors that are driving it there.
The rationale for the first element is obvious. In order for an organization to con-
tinue to survive and thrive, it needs to be structured such that it can operate in an 
ideal manner. Naturally, then, the configuration that the organization adopts is 
important. A global social media platform, for instance, likely would not be well 
served by adopting a simple structure, nor would a divisionalized configuration be 
appropriate for a fledgling Internet forum that is just beginning to grow. Online 
organizational leaders should consider the kind of interactions in which their mem-
bers are engaging and what interactions are actually necessary in order to foster 
success, be it in terms of entertainment, content production, social networking, or 
something else entirely. Notably, the configuration of the existing informal com-
munication network might serve as an important factor for such decisions, though it 
is unlikely to be the sole determinant.
On the other hand, it is not as obvious why a leader would want to be concerned 
with the organizational motors that drive the change between configurations, nor, 
for that matter, what control the leader might have over them. After all, if the change 
is a positive one, why should anyone care what causes it?
This is a dangerous sentiment. To take a lesson from the business world, history 
is littered with cases in which well-meaning managers drove their companies to 
ruin by trying to enact a positive change but doing so ineffectively. We may easily 
expect the same to be true of online organizations. As a simple illustration of this 
phenomenon, in any given business, few things scare and anger employees more 
than having change forced upon them. In general, most people tend to fear change 
anyway, and this is all the more true when one does not have a voice in the process. 
8.3  Practical Implications

122
When the environment in which we live changes around us, without any input or 
consent on our part, it makes it difficult for us to even function, let alone thrive as 
we once did. Maybe it is, indeed, a good idea to combine departments, to change 
managerial lines, to reassign roles, and so forth. Nonetheless, if the change is thrust 
upon employees, then they are likely to resist, opposing the new policies and 
defaulting to their existing informal communication networks, their previous for-
malized hierarchy, and their long-established ways of interacting. Such dissent 
would certainly stymie the organization as a whole, and it could ultimately turn any 
positive growth that might have been envisioned into the death knell of the 
business.
Yet many managers nonetheless rely on sweeping mandates to direct their 
employees to behave in a desired manner. There are isolated instances in which it is 
indeed necessary to enact major policy changes without consulting with one’s sub-
ordinates—particularly to stifle crises before they can fully erupt—but if your orga-
nization is generally healthy and your aim is simply to make it even stronger, there 
is little reason to do so.
In short, employees adapt best to change when they respect and trust its initiator 
or feel that they have a degree of control over the forces driving the organizational 
shift. More broadly, the lesson is that the motors driving a given change matter just 
as much as whether or not the change itself is well founded.
Therefore, in both online and offline organizations, it is worthwhile for a smart 
leader to consider the motors that should be fostered and those worth tempering in 
the process of inciting an organizational change. For instance, if you hope to make 
your formal organizational configuration more closely resemble the existing infor-
mal communication network, then it is easy to allow internal motors to drive the 
change: just gradually relax the formal restrictions and let the organization trans-
form naturally. Perhaps, on the other hand, it is worth pursuing a more dramatic 
change in order to help the organization progress beyond a point of critical mass, in 
which case you will want to highlight the life-cycle motors at play that necessitate 
the change. In other contexts, it might be worth breaking existing patterns of inter-
nal communication in order to allow external forces to play more of a role, thereby 
making it easier for the organization to adapt to its environment.
The point here is that the driving forces—or, at least, the perceived motors—
behind a change are sometimes even more important than whether or not the change 
itself is a good idea. Yes, a good leader will want to help guide his or her organiza-
tion in a positive direction, and such an individual may have the vision to see what 
configurations would be most useful for the future. Yet the motors that drive this 
change must also be given due attention, as members’ sentiments about the causes 
behind a change are a prerequisite for reacting positively to the change itself. In the 
end, rather than moving the community forward, blindly attempting to compel a 
constructive configurational change is likely to instead backfire and send the orga-
nization into decline. In this respect, the process of achieving a change is just as 
important as its product.

8.4  Conclusion
In closing, the focus of the last three chapters was on providing much more specific 
explanatory mechanisms for the emergence of social structures. Notably, not all 
organizations are the same, and not all phases through which an online collaborative 
organization progresses are triggered by similar motivations or socio-technological 
mechanisms. Therefore, our theoretical approach acknowledges the variety of con-
figurations that an organization may adopt and the range of motors that may drive 
changes in those social structures. This allows researchers to properly assess the 
trajectories through which organizational growth and development may occur in 
different contexts, and it provides practitioners with the means to guide their own 
groups along a healthy trajectory, while simultaneously avoiding the pitfalls of a 
misguided one-size-fits-all conceptualization of online and offline social 
structures.
The primary goal of these three chapters was to provide a clear and detailed 
explanatory framework along with a complex, concrete, and operationalizable 
method for discerning organizational structuration and change. The payoff is not 
merely theoretical, as there is also a practical dimension to our propositions. Above 
and beyond measurement and diagnosis, the method offers valuable insights about 
how formal and informal collaborative processes can be harnessed to grow and 
maintain online collaborative spaces. All told, this new synthesized theoretical 
framework offers a fundamentally enhanced approach to examine the long-term 
transformations of organizations and to understand the motors that shape, affect, 
and transform organizational configurations throughout their development, yielding 
a theoretical lens that offers valuable insights to scholars and practitioners alike.

Wikipedia Evolution: Trends and Phases
9.1  Introduction
In the previous chapters, we presented a theoretical framework to explain the emer-
gence and transformation of complex organizational configurations from an inte-
grated perspective. We suggested that structural differentiation is an early and 
constitutive process by which online social organizations emerge, grow, and become 
stable. In this chapter we explore some empirically measurable trends on Wikipedia 
that more concretely reveal structural differentiation through the lens of organiza-
tional configurations.
As a reminder, structural differentiation can take several forms or organizational 
configurations, each of which may be identified by the combination of our five dif-
ferent effort distribution and network dimensions (see Chap. 7). In other words, 
organizational configurations are observed in terms of collaborative ties and associ-
ated social graphs of interaction along with the division of labor among collabora-
tors, and those configurations are, in turn, used to explain the growth and maturation 
of collaborative projects such as Wikipedia. This provides a unique frame of refer-
ence to study online production communities of this sort, whose forms naturally 
emerge from user activity rather than being imposed by a top-down management 
scheme and deliberate organization design.
In this chapter, we analyze data across the five dimensions of inbound and out-
bound degree centralization, betweenness centralization, assortativity, and entropy 
to track the ways in which Wikipedia has changed over time. We also propose a 
statistical method that may be used to determine the moments at which internal and 
external phenomena triggered revolutionary shifts in an organization’s develop-
ment, and we subsequently use that method to identify transformative changes in 
the social structure of the online group that built Wikipedia.

126
9.2  Configurational Phase Shifts: Criteria and Significance
Recall, first and foremost, that structuration is expected to progress through certain 
phases over time. In Part I of this volume, structuration was examined through only 
one dimension: entropy. In this chapter, we consider changes in entropy as well as 
four other collaborative network factors: three types of centralization (betweenness, 
inbound degree, and outbound degree) and assortativity.
As was explained in Chap. 7, inbound degree centralization describes the dif-
ferentiation in the extent to which some individuals attract collaborative partners, 
while outbound degree centralization refers to differentiation in the extent to which 
some members pursue collaborative ties with others. In other words, this is the dif-
ference between seeking others (outbound) and being sought after (inbound). Note 
that in this study, the direction of collaborative ties is determined by the order in 
which individuals edited a given article, as described in Appendix A.
Betweenness centralization refers to the extent to which certain individuals in a 
collaborative network act as bridges, creating “shortest paths” of collaboration that 
unite otherwise disparate partners and groups. Finally, assortativity is the tendency 
of individuals to associate with those who are similar to them on a given dimension. 
In this context, this similarity emerges in the form of similar productivity levels 
among coeditors. High assortativity would indicate that individuals who are more 
productive are concentrated in a local network of highly productive contributors, 
while disassortativity would instead suggest that top contributors prefer to engage 
with fledgling contributors rather than fellow elites.
These four measures reflect four core organizational processes. Inbound central-
ization represents collaborative attractiveness, outbound centralization signifies col-
laborative extroversion, betweenness centralization provides a summary of 
communication flow and coordination, and assortativity is our operationalization 
for the concept of partner choice tendencies (for further details, see Chap. 7). These 
complement entropy, our measure of structural order, to jointly produce a compre-
hensive view of an organization’s principal attributes and processes.
We use the five dimensions together to detect the “breakpoints” that occurred in 
the development of Wikipedia’s collaborative evolution and to paint a more nuanced 
image of its changes over time. Breakpoints appear where “revolutionary” changes 
can be detected via statistical analysis, including those signifying transitions 
between configurations. By exploring the tendency for organizations like Wikipedia 
to move from one configuration to another, we also gain precious insight into the 
natural inertia of organizations in general and of online social collaborative spaces 
in particular.
The synthesized theory established in Chaps. 7 and 8 is complemented by the 
methodological perspective and analysis presented in this chapter. In Sect. 9.3 we 
provide a primer on the statistical requirements for a suitable algorithm to detect 
development thresholds, then in Sect. 9.4 we will introduce a stepwise segmented 
regression analysis that satisfies those needs. If you are interested in a more ­technical 
overview of the algorithm, please refer to Britt (2013, 2015) and Appendix A for 
further information.

127
Afterward, we will use this method to identify the theorized periods of evolution 
and moments of revolution, and with them, the activation of various phases of orga-
nizational change over time. This will showcase the points of transition from one 
organizational configuration to another, which is essential for our final description 
and interpretation of the phases in the development of structurally differentiated 
online collaborative groups.
In effect, in this chapter we upgrade the analysis presented in Part I of this vol-
ume from a one- to a five-dimensional investigation of structural differentiation. 
Our goal is to identify the specific organizational configurations that emerge and 
succeed each other in online production spaces, such as that surrounding Wikipedia. 
Of particular importance is detecting the emergence of a final form of structural dif-
ferentiation, which the analyses earlier in this volume suggested might emerge as an 
adhocratic order.
9.3  Existing Breakpoint Detection Algorithms
The analytic portion of this chapter will focus on determining breakpoints in five 
collaborative dimensions, which jointly map onto the theoretical model developed 
in the previous three chapters. The dimensions reflect long-term measurements of 
the set of factors (inbound degree centralization, outbound degree centralization, 
betweenness centralization, assortativity, and entropy) introduced in Chap. 7 to 
describe organizational configurations. In other words, a set of time series was cre-
ated, with one such series corresponding to each of the five key factors.
The time series, which are described in more detail in Appendix A, were con-
structed on the basis of a quasi-complete network of collaborative ties between 
Wikipedia users. The ties in this network were derived from coeditorial interactions. 
A user was considered to be connected to another user if both individuals edited the 
same article, as doing so suggested that they may have been engaging with one 
another or, at the very least, with one another’s thoughts and ideas. The more signifi-
cant the revisions and the closer they were together in time, the stronger the weight 
of the edges, indicating an increasing likelihood that the users were indeed engaged 
with each other’s work. Such edges additively grew in degree over multiple sets of 
revisions and multiple articles, strengthening over time, with the result being a 
probabilistic network representing the relative likelihood of any given pair of users 
holding a significant collaborative relationship.
The network was examined based on the manner in which it grew on a weekly 
basis. A single network graph was constructed corresponding to each week of 
Wikipedia’s development over its first 9.5 years, with any given graph containing all 
of the edges that resulted from all revisions made during or prior to the week in 
question. This resulted in the generation of almost 500 network graphs, each of 
which added the edges that resulted from one additional week of revisions to the 
graph that came before it.
9.3  Existing Breakpoint Detection Algorithms

Afterward, these networks were all analyzed in order to measure the values of 
our five key metrics: inbound degree centralization, outbound degree centralization, 
betweenness centralization, assortativity, and entropy. All told, this approach yielded 
five distinct time series that each offered a description of one organizational factor 
related to Wikipedia’s development over its first 9.5 years.
Further, we have already described the importance of distinguishing between 
prolonged evolutionary shifts and nigh-instantaneous revolutions, so these must be 
identified within the time series. For this purpose, we refer to the idea of “break-
points” that, when apparent in time series data, present themselves as changes in the 
path of the plotted line. In more concrete terms, a breakpoint may consist of a 
change in the line’s intercept, slope, or an exponential term. In this sense, a break-
point is a tangible representation of a revolutionary change, as evidenced by a dra-
matic, instantaneous shift in one of the major factors being examined.
The core idea behind this approach is that from a measurement standpoint, only 
sharp, abrupt changes matter, since they capture breakpoints in the evolutionary pro-
cess. In truth, while we are also interested in periods of evolution, only the revolution-
ary moments must be pinpointed—after all, if we know when a finite number of 
revolutions occurred to fundamentally change the system, then the periods between 
those dramatic shifts must instead constitute evolution or stability. So if we can identify 
the revolutions, then we have by definition denoted the evolutionary periods as well. 
These revolutions, when apparent in time series data, present themselves as break-
points in which path of the plotted line changes. In terms of the graph itself, a break-
point may consist of a change in the line’s intercept, slope, or an exponential term.
Breakpoints are common reference points in quasi-experiments, such as those 
conducted in pharmacology (Wagner et al. 2002). In these studies, some metric 
related to a subject’s health or aptitude is measured over a period of time. At a pre-­
specified time, a treatment (such as a new medication) is applied to the subject, and 
measurement continues thereafter as the treatment continues. The moment at which 
the treatment was applied is deemed the breakpoint, and separate regression equa-
tions can be fitted to the line segments that occurred before and after the breakpoint. 
If there is a statistically significant difference between the parameters of the two line 
segments, then the treatment is deemed to have had an effect accordingly.
It is easy to see how breakpoints, then, signify “revolution,” in this case indicating 
the application of a treatment. Yet, in quasi-experiments, the location of the break-
point is known in advance: it’s the moment at which the treatment was initiated. This 
is not the case in studies of emergent processes, such as collaborative behavior on 
Wikipedia, for which we would like to determine when moments of revolution natu-
rally occurred, without a researcher’s deliberate intervention. So, while the impor-
tance of breakpoints remains, we need some means of identifying where those 
breakpoints are present and even how many breakpoints there actually are.
A number of existing methods promise to identify breakpoints in order to serve 
this need. Unfortunately, each such method carries several significant limitations 
that mitigate its usefulness for studies of this sort (see Britt 2015 for a more detailed 
overview). For instance, the steepest descent and gradient descent models, as well 
as the Newton, Gauss-Newton, and Marquardt algorithms commonly employed by 
the statistical package SAS, only work with continuous breakpoints, which may not 
9  Wikipedia Evolution: Trends and Phases

129
be a realistic assumption for volatile online social systems in which the community 
may transition into a completely different form almost overnight. These approaches 
also presuppose a specific number of breakpoints, which cannot be known in 
advance when one is trying to detect revolutions between an unknown number of 
developmental stages.
Likewise, although Achim Zeileis’ strucchange algorithm (Zeileis et al. 2003, 
2010) might appear to offer more promise for fitting an unknown number of con-
tinuous and discontinuous breakpoints to real-world data, Britt (2013) found that 
this algorithm dramatically overfit data with substantial amounts of random noise, 
attributing an unrealistic number of breakpoints that merely fit error variance and 
generating comparatively mediocre fits to genuine revolutions. We would expect 
measurements of online communities to have exceptionally large degrees of error 
variance, and for growing or declining groups, such error variance is frequently of a 
heteroscedastic nature, which further confounds Zeileis’ approach. As a whole, 
these phenomena render the strucchange algorithm wholly unsuitable for break-
point detection in online communities.
All told, no previously existing algorithm provides an acceptable method to iden-
tify revolutions in an online community like Wikipedia, yet the ability to pinpoint 
these breakpoints is essential for assessing organizational growth over time. This 
need drives us toward the creation of a new statistical method that is especially 
suited for breakpoint detection in volatile time series data sets, such as those of 
online social systems.
9.4  Stepwise Segmented Regression Analysis
This new approach, called stepwise segmented regression analysis, draws from the 
principles of stepwise model selection as well as the traditional use of segmented 
regression analysis in quasi-experimental designs, offering a new way to detect 
breakpoints in volatile environments like those of online communities and other 
sites of human interaction. Its basis in regression analysis offers a degree of robust-
ness against high-variance data sets and heteroscedasticity, and it is flexible enough 
to handle continuous and discontinuous breakpoints alike in raw data sets with no 
need for data transformation or smoothing.
Stepwise segmented regression analysis is, at its core, a modified form of seg-
mented regression. Just as in a quasi-experiment, this analysis is designed to detect 
the differences, if any, between two or more adjacent line segments. These line seg-
ments may be modeled with intercepts, slopes, and any number of exponential 
terms, just as in typical regression analyses. The primary modification that the step-
wise segmented regression algorithm applies is that every interval between any two 
adjacent data points is considered to be a possible breakpoint and stepwise model 
selection is used to select which breakpoints, if any, are statistically significant. This 
provides us with a straightforward way to detect social revolutions as evidenced by 
breakpoints of any type.
9.4  Stepwise Segmented Regression Analysis

130
The basic procedure behind stepwise segmented regression analysis is as fol-
lows. First, a model is fit with only the basic terms defined by the researcher (such 
as an intercept, slope, and any higher-order regression terms). This set of terms can 
be considered the first level of a hierarchical regression, as they are never removed 
from the model regardless of significance level.
Second, each possible breakpoint is considered for inclusion in the model based 
upon a standard model selection threshold such as α = 0.15. All terms associated 
with an interval between two points are considered. For instance, if the initial model 
included an intercept, a slope, and a quadratic term, then each potential breakpoint 
would also constitute intercept, slope, and quadratic terms representing the change 
in each parameter occurring at that breakpoint. A breakpoint consisting of all three 
terms would then be added to the regression model if and only if at least one of its 
three terms was statistically significant at the α = 0.15 level. It should be noted that 
the reason for adding all three terms associated with a given breakpoint to the model, 
rather than just adding the statistically significant term or terms, is to avoid errone-
ously fitting breakpoints resulting from different parameters at consecutive or proxi-
mal data points when only one revolution has in fact occurred.
Third, if any breakpoints already in the model have all of their associated terms 
cease to meet the α = 0.15 level of significance, then all terms associated with those 
breakpoints are removed from the model. To be clear, all terms related to a given 
breakpoint (intercept, slope, quadratic, etc.) are all added to the model together and 
deleted together; in the interest of avoiding spurious “extra” breakpoints in the 
model, individual terms are never added or removed in isolation.
Steps 2 and 3 then continue to repeat until no further breakpoints can be added 
or removed. The resulting model offers the starting position and initial trajectory of 
the parameter or parameters measured in the time series, the changes that resulted 
from any breakpoints (revolutions) identified, and the evolutionary trends observed 
in the periods between those breakpoints.
Importantly, some of our network measures, especially the centralization met-
rics, are not necessarily directly comparable across networks of different sizes 
(Freeman 1979). However, this is not a problem for breakpoint detection using step-
wise segmented regression analysis. Let us assume, for instance, that a metric such 
as betweenness centralization is naturally predisposed toward a downward curvilin-
ear trend as the number of members within a given organization increases. In that 
case, the “first level” of the regression would be used to model that curvilinear 
trend, while the stepwise procedure would capture any significant deviations from 
that trend—which are, indeed, the breakpoints that we would like to assess.
9.5  Breakpoints as Revolutionary Change
The theoretical model behind our analysis is premised on the idea that dramatic 
revolutionary changes in key time series variables (entropy, centralization of each 
kind, assortativity) indicate breakpoints or thresholds that mark transitions in core 
9  Wikipedia Evolution: Trends and Phases

131
organizational configuration dimensions. When specific levels in these dimensions 
align in specific ways, the combination of factors signifies the presence of a corre-
sponding organizational configuration. Likewise, when the values of these dimen-
sions change, organizational configurations change as well.
To recount, the five dimensions are the structures of collaborative attractiveness 
and extroversion, communication flow, partner choice trends, and structural order. 
For each, there is a specific measure—structures of collaborative attractiveness are 
measured using inbound degree centralization, those for extroversion are assessed 
with outbound degree centralization, communication flow is reflected in between-
ness centralization, partner choice trends are detected via assortativity, and struc-
tural order is measured with entropy. A full justification for these associations is 
presented in Chaps. 7 and 8.
We used stepwise segmented regression analysis to examine changes in these 
five factors, as measured for the Wikipedia collaborative project from 2001 to 2010. 
(For a complete description of the data set, see Appendix A.) To that end, our five 
system-level parameters, which jointly tapped into Mintzberg’s (1979) five organi-
zational configurations, were assessed over the 9.5-year period. Figure 9.1 indicates 
the relative level we would expect for each dimension within each configuration 
archetype. For example, when inbound and outbound centralization are high, 
betweenness centralization is low, assortativity is either negative or near zero, and 
entropy is somewhat high, the observed organization resembles that of a simple 
structure configuration.
The diagram and the values in the cells of Fig. 9.1 reflect the theoretical model 
for organizational change presented in Chaps. 7 and 8. We derived the expected 
values and their combinations from a series of axioms, presented below. The axioms 
summarize the theoretical argument behind each configuration, as presented in 
Chaps. 7 and 8, reflecting the essential characteristics of each configuration. 
Corollaries, inferred from the axioms, provide guidance for determining the expected 
levels for each dimension in each organizational configuration. The breakpoints,

132
then, provide guidance for interpreting the movement of these measurable ­dimensions 
over time, including whether they meet or fail to meet the combinations of thresh-
olds suggested in Fig. 9.1 at various points in time.
The process of identifying organizational change in this manner differs from that 
discussed in Chaps. 3 and 5 in that it is multidimensional and it aims to capture not 
mere evolutionary phases but complex configurational changes. Of course, the 
sequencing of the previously identified phases and of changes in the organizational 
configurations should and do overlap. Yet, these sequences take on a new, deeper 
meaning through the explication of these configurational changes.
Based on the literature and the organizational configuration concepts presented 
in Chaps. 7 and 8, we propose the following axioms and measurement corollaries 
for determining the contours of the organizational configurations and the break-
points separating them:
9.5.1  Simple Structure or Entrepreneurial Organization
Axioms
	1.	 Resembles the classic “mom-and-pop” store.
	2.	 One leader directly manages a collection of loosely organized subordinates.
	3.	 Work is distributed: due to small size, everybody needs to do his or her share.
Corollary
Given the small size of the group, the leader will attract many inbound and out-
bound collaborative ties. However, the work is distributed, which means that there 
will also be lateral connectivity. Entropy will be somewhat inflated, reflecting the 
limited control that the leader exerts over the work process and the diffuse nature of 
the organization. Assortativity will also be low, as the leader, by necessity, has to 
work with everybody else. Betweenness centralization will also be low due to the 
distribution of collaborative ties and the resulting free flow of information.
9.5.2  Machine Bureaucracy
Axioms
	1.	 Power concentrated at the top of the organization.
	2.	 Leaders impose a fixed hierarchy upon subordinates.
	3.	 Compartmentalization: minimal intermixing among unrelated work groups.
	4.	 Unified structure.
Corollary
A small group of leaders, which is itself layered into tiers of power and communica-
tion, attracts a somewhat high level of inbound and outbound connections compared 
with the other organizational members. Their dominance is lower on the 
9  Wikipedia Evolution: Trends and Phases

133
attractiveness/extroversion dimension than the simple structure archetype, however, 
due to the plurality of commanding roles and the number of “middle management” 
layers separating the top of the hierarchy from the bottom. The stratification in this 
structure, though, does generate a higher level of betweenness centralization, with 
the flow of information across the hierarchy funneled through a limited number of 
intermediate leaders. Assortativity is prevalent in this archetype, as the organiza-
tional stratification and the small size of the top group both encourage preferential 
connections between fellow leaders. At the same time, entropy in a machine bureau-
cracy is low, as such systems are structured and relatively top-heavy by definition.
9.5.3  Professional Bureaucracy
Axioms
	1.	 Elites are increasingly layered and more likely to designate power to middle 
management and team leaders.
	2.	 Top groups are increasingly distant and separated from the rest of the 
organization.
	3.	 Organizational power is, to a certain degree, localized within working groups.
	4.	 Organization is integrated along a nexus of power.
Corollary
In a professional bureaucracy, a great deal of control is ceded to the operating core 
at the bottom of the hierarchy, so organizational power is not nearly as concentrated 
among a small clique of leaders and behavior is not as formalized as it is within the 
more rigid machine hierarchy. This leads to low centralization across the board, as 
communication and collaborative activity are both more distributed than they are in 
a machine bureaucracy. Assortativity remains high, indicating that, as with the 
machine bureaucracy, leaders are more likely to interact with each other than with 
members of the organization found on the lower levels. Entropy also remains low, 
as the amount of structuration is significant.
9.5.4  Diversified Organization
Axioms
	1.	 Diversified organizations are federated organizations.
	2.	 Work is the product of collaboration between entities that share some of their 
prerogatives at the highest level yet maintain a large degree of autonomy within 
themselves.
	3.	 Some central individuals serve as essential bridges between entities/
departments.
	4.	 Basic units (divisions) have their own level of structuration.
9.5  Breakpoints as Revolutionary Change

134
	5.	 Structuration within and across entities is relatively high.
	6.	 Organizational divisions separate different types of members, fostering preferen-
tial connections between those who are similar.
Corollary
Within a diversified organization, the structure is fragmented into a number of 
largely distinct divisions, each of which maintains its own structure and standards 
of activity. The organization’s activities are somewhat decentralized, yet the leaders 
serve as an absolutely vital link between the disparate units. Consequently, inbound 
and outbound centralization are somewhat low due to the highly fragmented nature 
of the organization, yet the federated nature of the organization demands that the 
organization’s leaders serve as the point of connection between the divisions, so the 
overall level of betweenness centralization is correspondingly very high. The high 
level of structuration necessarily leads to a low level of entropy; on the other hand, 
the divisions between functionally distinct groups result in an assortative mixing 
pattern among members.
9.5.5  Adhocracy
Axioms
	1.	 Structural organization is moderate, driven by “functional” leaders.
	2.	 Functional leaders are born, not made. They are defined by what and how much 
they do, not by who they claim to be.
	3.	 Structure of leadership is simple: leaders do, followers follow.
	4.	 Structure is organic; members depend on each other to a larger degree than in 
bureaucracy.
	5.	 Structure is temporally stable, yet there is temporal churn of elite membership.
Corollary
Adhocracies feature an organic structure similar to that of the simple structure but 
with the flexibility to form self-directed project teams as needed, based on the spe-
cialized skills of their members, and without an entrenched leader heavily dominat-
ing the structure from the top. Yet, adhocracy is not to be confounded with a total 
lack of organizational structure. Its distinguishing feature is the flexibility of roles 
and attributes, which is supported by the members’ ability and willingness to take 
over specific roles and abandon them as needed. As a consequence, the only distin-
guishing feature of adhocracy is a moderate level of entropy and structuration. 
Inbound and outbound degree centralization and betweenness centralization are 
low. More generally speaking, an adhocratic organization follows either a disassor-
tative mixing trend—with individuals gravitating toward others who are different 
from themselves—or no form of preferential attachment at all. This aligns with our 
findings from Chap. 5, in which we found that associations between elites and near-­
elite members do not improve the chances of those individuals on the cusp of a 
functional leadership position successfully ascending to the elite group.

135
9.5.6  Classification of Archetypes
Figure 9.1 consolidates the corollaries by indicating, for each organizational con-
figuration, the expected measurement levels of each of the five dimensions based 
upon these axioms and corollaries. It should be noted that this is a relative classifica-
tion system in which parameter values are described only as they are expected to 
change between the various configurations, but not with precisely defined numbers 
or ranges. The parameter associations were laid out in this manner because mere 
classification is not the goal of this analysis—rather, the objective is to assess move-
ment between the archetypes. This goal does not demand that each archetype be 
rigidly and quantitatively delineated, and the lack of a strict numeric definition for 
each archetype permits some flexibility in its application across contexts.
As shown by Figs. 9.2 and 9.3, the observed levels of the five variables at various 
points in time suggest some interesting interpretations. All variables except assorta-
tivity start high, suggesting a configuration resembling the simple structure arche-
type. Three of them (entropy, inbound degree centralization, and outbound degree 
centralization) feature several apparent inflection points throughout the 9.5-year 
period, while assortativity and betweenness centralization trend toward nonsignifi-
cance over time. This indicates a shift toward adhocracy. What are, however, the 
breakpoints around which we can more definitively say that the organizational con-
figuration dimensions are shifting in a significant, dramatic yet concrete way? What 
should be the revolutionary change boundaries in this assessment? More precisely, 
at what critical breakpoints do organizational configuration changes occur?

smoothen periodic changes for the sake of interpretability. Moving averages calculated with a

Appendix A, Table A.2
9.5  Breakpoints as Revolutionary Change

136
9.6  Analysis
To determine these breakpoints, we ran five stepwise segmented regression analy-
ses, one for each of the five parameters, for all weekly parameter values calculated 
across the 9.5-year period.1 The first 3 and last 3  weeks of observations were 
removed from the data set due to issues with data completeness and parameter esti-
mation, leaving 488 data points corresponding to weeks 4–491 of Wikipedia’s exis-
tence for use in the analysis.
We identified 11 statistically significant breakpoints at the typical α = 0.05 level 
after a Holm-Bonferroni correction (see Tables 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, and 9.5). These 11 
breakpoints corresponded to changes that were evident at the onset of weeks 7, 10, 
42, 54, 92, 93, 142, 204, 207, 250, and 335 of Wikipedia’s existence. Note that 
Chap. 5 only included those breakpoints resulting from our analysis of entropy, 
while this chapter also includes those from the time series for inbound degree cen-
tralization, outbound degree centralization, betweenness centralization, and 
assortativity.
As shown in Fig. 9.4, while many breakpoints suggest accelerating or decelerat-
ing transitions between configurations, only two breakpoints stand out as funda-
mental changes that dramatically altered the trajectory of the Wikipedia coeditorial 
configuration. Specifically, these are the shifts that occurred at weeks 54 and 92. 
1 The complete justification for this approach, including the rationale for conducting separate 
regression analyses instead of a single multivariate analysis, is provided in Appendix C.

These appear to delineate intervals that align, based on the values of the five dimen-
sions being measured, with three distinct organizational configurations: simple 
structure, machine bureaucracy, and adhocracy.
More specifically, in the beginning of Wikipedia’s existence, the social system 
featured relatively high entropy and a disassortative mixing pattern along with 
very low betweenness centralization. Thus, although the structure was relatively

egalitarian, there was a tendency for some individuals to connect and coordinate 
with other members who were different from themselves, maximizing diversity as a 
result. The high values for outbound degree centralization also suggested that some 
individuals were much more extroverted than others in seeking collaborative part-
ners. Overall, the configuration resembled that of a simple structure, dominated 
more in spirit than in fact by a very hard working, minuscule leadership cadre.
As time passed, however, betweenness centralization increased, and entropy at 
least momentarily did so as well. If we also factor in the relative decline in disas-
sortativity, we can say that Wikipedia was gradually shifting toward a machine 
bureaucracy, in which some members played an important role as power brokers 
and those elites also grew to interact with one another more often based on the 
decline in disassortativity.
Between weeks 54 and 92, both entropy and betweenness centralization declined. 
This indicates a period of reorganization during which some leaders took charge by 
working hard and focusing on particular parts of the project rather than by scattering

their efforts across domains. In this respect, they grew increasingly dedicated and 
bound to particular parts of the work. Their role as “makers” increased, while that 
of “coordinators” decreased. Overall, these trends signaled the beginning of a diffu-
sion process in which a functional leadership of “leading by doing” emerged. This 
was a transition period, during which time the system essentially sought a new 
structure after having shifted off its initial trajectory toward the machine bureau-
cracy archetype.
The role of the leaders was consolidated after week 92. During this last major 
interval, although entropy fluctuated along the expected paths of growth and matu-
ration, it eventually found its “steady state,” especially after week 250. Additionally, 
and most importantly, assortativity almost reached zero after week 250, while two 
forms of centrality were consistently low (betweenness) or very low (outbound 
degree). All three were also very stable after week 92, with minimal erratic 
­vacillations in observed values. Due to these “leveling off” processes, we can 
broadly say that Wikipedia shifted to an adhocratic state during this phase.
After week 92, entropy increased for a while, indicating an inflow of new col-
laborators, only to peak around week 250 and to level off after week 335. Also, 
betweenness centrality and assortativity, two central measures of more formal orga-
nizational configurations—especially those of a bureaucratic sort—tended toward

zero. The only type of centralization that saw a recovery was inbound degree 
­centralization, which suggests that some contributors drew others’ efforts toward 
them, but the lack of a similar growth in outbound degree centralization indicates 
that there was not an especially active core group that actively sought out connec-
tions with others.
Overall, when we consider all five dimensions that may be used to characterize 
organizational configurations, we can say that Wikipedia gradually moved from a 
simple organization (at the beginning of the data set) toward a machine bureaucracy 
(until week 54), entered a period of flux between weeks 54 and 92, and finally 
developed into an increasingly accentuated adhocracy (from week 93 onward).
9.7  The Path Toward Adhocracy
The division into phases articulated here only partially overlaps with the phases of 
evolutionary development described in Chap. 5. For instance, in Chap. 5 we dis-
cussed four phases, while here we have only three major ones if we exclude the 
period of transition from weeks 54 to 92. There are two reasons for this difference. 
First, in Chap. 5, we took a strict and unidimensional view of evolution that was 
derived from the community of practice framework. In that chapter, we followed the 
evolution of the practice of editorial collaboration, specifically aiming to identify 
the expected phases of incubation, coalescence, growth, and maturity.
Further, only one aspect of the organization’s structuration was observed for the 
identification effort in Part I of this volume. The description was, at the same time, 
formal and meta-theoretical, and the domain-specific nature of the organization 
and the substance of any given change were set aside. In Part II, especially in 
Chaps. 8 and 9, we added a substantive investigation of the transformation process. 
To put it another way, in Chap. 5 we looked at “how” organizational change took 
place, while in the chapters since, we have considered “what changed and to what 
effect.”
This brings us to the second reason for the simpler, tripartite division of 
Wikipedia’s organizational evolution, as proposed in this chapter. When all is said 
and done, as we first suggested in Chap. 1, Wikipedia’s evolution has a beginning, 
middle, and end. Both transformation models—the one presented in Chap. 5 and 
the one detailed in this chapter—can be seen through this lens. The ways in which 
the evolutionary model presented in Chap. 5 complies with these three stages are 
self-­evident. As for this change model presented in this chapter, mapping it onto a 
­beginning, middle, and end paradigm is also relatively easy. Wikipedia was born as 
a simple, mom-and-pop organization. As it matured, much like many traditional 
corporations, it grew into something resembling a machine bureaucracy. In the 
long run, however, its configuration eventually gravitated toward that of an 
adhocracy.
More to the point, in the beginning, Wikipedia was driven by a group of dedi-
cated individuals who worked in an entrepreneurial context. For a period, covering 
9  Wikipedia Evolution: Trends and Phases

141
a bit less than the first 2 years of growth, the organization found a viable manner of 
functioning within a quasi-bureaucratic structure that included implicit task leaders 
and coordinators. In the end, however, its explosive success was only possible 
because it accepted and embraced an adhocratic regime. Although the adhocratic 
form of Wikipedia that we see today has a leadership structure, those leaders are 
simply those who do the most work, not those who give orders, arbitrate disputes, 
or otherwise make guiding decisions for the organization. In this adhocratic phase, 
Wikipedia’s social structure could be likened to that of a gigantic marathon. The 
leaders, then, are those who run the fastest while maintaining the highest level of 
stamina. The pace setters determine the rhythm and the direction of the entire proj-
ect. In other words, those who are most dedicated, as exhibited through their work 
alone, enjoy, as their reward, more of a voice and more control over Wikipedia as a 
whole.
9.8  Conclusion
As we have now shown, the development of online collaboration spaces, such as 
that surrounding Wikipedia, does indeed proceed through a series of phases, ulti-
mately culminating as an adhocratic order that combines several interesting collab-
orative characteristics. Of these, the combination of fluid leadership roles with the 
domination of the “1%” contributor group is probably the most intriguing, as it 
provides a tangible representation of the theorized flexibility that an adhocratic 
structure entails.
The discussion about adhocracy cannot be completed without reiterating the 
point made earlier about the double meaning of the term. In Part I of this book, 
adhocracy was introduced as a framework and was considered through the lens of 
elite turnover. In Part II, we looked at adhocracy as a specific organizational con-
figuration that was defined by five different dimensions. With this redefinition of 
adhocracy, we transition from simpler questions about “how” to more sophisticated 
inquiries about “what” and “to what effect.”
Of course, the impact of this analysis is not merely to capture a few changes in 
variables, nor only to specify the meaning of adhocracy. Rather, this also serves as 
a first step toward validating the entire synthesized theoretical model articulated in 
the previous three chapters. Focusing first on the distinction between evolutionary 
trends and revolutionary moments allows us to quantitatively determine the exact 
phases through which Wikipedia progressed in its development. Using those same 
factors, we can also identify the trajectory taken by Wikipedia during its growth. 
And, as will be shown in Chap. 10, we also relate those key changes to some con-
current socio-technical organizational events, providing a better understanding of 
Wikipedia itself, yielding insights about the needs of online collaborative organiza-
tions in general, and solidifying the synthesized theoretical model provided in this 
volume for future use across online and offline contexts.

Breakpoints and Concurrent Factors
10.1  Introduction
Up to this point, we have articulated a synthesized model of organizational change, 
and we subsequently detailed some initial findings about the moments at which the 
organizational configuration of Wikipedia—or the manner in which that configura-
tion was changing over time—shifted.
Our perspective has, so far, been social structural, as we observed only the col-
laborative factors that were associated with Wikipedia’s organizational changes 
over time. However, this leaves out the forces that drove such changes. These are the 
factors that operate at the level of organizational policy, deliberate and unconscious 
organizational engineering and management, and socio-technical infrastructures. 
These concurrent factors further coincide and have points of convergence with the 
changes we detected in Wikipedia’s structural evolution, suggesting that they may 
play a casual role in the revolutions observed on Wikipedia.
To identify candidates for concurrent, potentially causal factors, we conducted 
an archival analysis of major events that occurred within the Wikipedia community, 
its policymaking environment, and its socio-technical design processes. In this anal-
ysis, we looked at the revisions made to key Wikipedia policy pages as well as 
contributions made to their associated “Talk” pages, in which editors discuss the 
revisions being made, in addition to larger societal events that may have affected 
Wikipedia. The findings of the archival search were used to assess the significant 
internal and external dynamics acting upon the Wikipedia collaborative 
community.
For the purposes of this chapter, we will focus only on the internal policies 
under study; the full analysis including external phenomena is detailed at length in 
Appendix B. With that in mind, our investigation included all of the pages listed 
under the “Principles,” “Content standards,” and “Working with others” categories 
on Wikipedia’s “Policies and guidelines” page (Wikipedia 2016b, d). The “History” 
page for Wikipedia (2017a) was also observed for the sake of capturing other key 

144
moments in the community’s history beyond policy changes. Major concurrent 
factors were further explored using discussion forums frequented by longtime 
Wikipedia users (such as Wikipedia-L, archived at https://lists.wikimedia.org/
pipermail/wikipedia-l) as well as the growing literature dedicated to Wikipedia as 
a community project (Jullien 2012; Tkacz 2014).
In this enterprise we seek central organizational events and aim to present the 
change process in terms that are as detailed and tangible as possible. In this, we take 
an idiographic approach (Lamiell 2014). As a term whose origins lie in the history 
of ideas, idiography is the practice of identifying unique events, decisions, motiva-
tions, or behaviors that occur above and beyond what regular trends might predict 
(Luthans and Davis 1981). We adopted this approach to account for unique events, 
which can act as “switches” in the otherwise incremental development of Wikipedia. 
The main justification of this approach is to avoid the temptation of overemphasiz-
ing and rationalizing the evolutionary process. Living organizations, like Wikipedia, 
are not absolutely preordained to take a very specific path. While they can and do 
follow some regularities that are imposed by various constraints (material, formal, 
efficient, or teleologic, to use the old Aristotelian adage), they are not entirely pre-
determined, in much the same way that the growth of an organism is only partially 
predicted by genes and biology. Accidents, context, and human decisions may have 
a significant influence on collaborative evolution and its organizational outcomes.
In addition, we will examine the manner in which those factors shifted Wikipedia’s 
trajectory of growth, building on the theory of organizational motors that was 
addressed in Chap. 8. To recount, there are four modalities of change: life-cycle, 
evolutionary, dialectical, and teleological. Life-cycle motors are those internal 
forces that promote the organization’s natural, uninhibited life span, much like the 
way in which a child will grow taller over time in the absence of other prohibitive 
forces to prevent it, due solely to his or her own life cycle. In the context of organi-
zations, life-cycle motors effectively coax the organization along a predetermined 
linear sequence that leads toward an inevitable conclusion, with little more flexibil-
ity than a railroad car moving down a set of train tracks.
Evolutionary change, in contrast, is driven by the environmental forces that pro-
mote and maintain the three key evolutionary processes: variation, selection, and 
retention. For both life-cycle and evolutionary motors, the organization has little 
power to resist the change in question (at least, if its members want the organization 
to survive). The major difference between the two is whether the change involves 
the organization following its own natural trajectory or whether the organization is 
instead driven toward a new form or process by environmental conditions or 
constraints.
Dialectical change emerges through conflicts between actors who hold compet-
ing goals or values. The resolution of those conflicts through dialogue may establish 
new norms within the organization and throughout the larger environment in which 
the organization is embedded. And lastly, teleological change unfolds when the 
leadership unit within the organization pushes it forward in pursuit of a desired 
“final state,” without necessarily engaging in extensive dialogue and negotiation 
about the change in question.
10  Breakpoints and Concurrent Factors

145
Overall, the efforts described in this chapter were undertaken to identify the 
major policy, technology, and community events occurring immediately before, 
during, and after each breakpoint. This deeper assessment of concurrent factors 
allows us to examine the extent to which the observed configurational changes were 
impacted by particular regulatory, managerial, technological, or social factors. The 
goal in doing so is to link the observed internal configurational changes with the 
various motors that contributed to those changes, firmly unifying the work of 
Mintzberg (1979, 1989) with that of Van de Ven and Poole (1995).
10.2  Identifying Concurrent Factors and Change Modalities
The analysis in this chapter considers all major breakpoints identified through step-
wise segmented regression (Tables 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, and 9.5) in all five dimensions, 
as shown in Figs. 10.1 and 10.2. These correspond to weeks 7, 42, 54, 92, 142, 204, 
250, and 335.1 We examined the various major events that occurred in the 4 weeks 
prior to each breakpoint as well as the week afterward in order to properly account 
for events that may have had a delayed effect or that may not have been widely 
recognized until after their impact.
1 For the purposes of this assessment, multiple breakpoints occurring within 5 weeks of one another 
were considered to constitute a single breakpoint, as it would otherwise be impossible to properly 
distinguish the motors that affected different breakpoints in such close temporal proximity.

10.2  Identifying Concurrent Factors and Change Modalities

146
We will first examine the events surrounding each breakpoint sequentially. After 
this “blow-by-blow” account, we will explore the full set of breakpoints in the con-
text of their respective idiographic and concurrent organizational change factors. 
This allows for the assessment of momentary forces at work as well as any consis-
tent themes that pervaded the full data set. In the process, we will also discuss the 
modality of the change process at each given point in time when appropriate.
10.2.1  First Breakpoint: Week 7
During its first weeks of life, in January–March 2001, Wikipedia was a tiny organi-
zation animated by the ideals of the “open source” software movement and run by a 
very small group of people. Yet, its growth was promising, as indicated by Appendix 
A, Table A.1. Twelve authors already generated 648 articles. At the same time, the 
work was rather dispersed: only 905 revisions, or about 1.4 per article had been 
made. Yet, if we instead divide the number of revisions by the number of authors, 
the work is rather significant, with approximately 75 revisions per author. Entropy 
was relatively high during this period, reaching almost 0.7 on a scale from 0 to 1. 
So, although the load was carried by a small group of contributors, the effort was 
rather evenly spread among these individuals.
At this stage, policies and rules were more implicit than explicit. In fact, the 
“Policies and guidelines” page used as an index of major Wikipedia policies did not 
yet exist, as the community was still too small for strict rules to be necessary.

breakpoint to breakpoint. Vertices in the lines indicate breakpoints
10  Breakpoints and Concurrent Factors

147
Considering that a small group had, to that point, produced relatively minimal con-
tent, there was hardly a need for a rigid set of guidelines dictating interpersonal 
behavior and contribution quality.
However, although there was hardly an extensive system of Wikipedia rules at 
this time, Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger did formally establish one of the organiza-
tion’s most important policies, the “neutral point of view” standard for revisions 
(Wales 2001; Wikipedia 2017a, c), around this time. This policy, which was first 
posted to Wikipedia on February 16, would eventually become one of Wikipedia’s 
three “core content policies” that govern all information added to the 
encyclopedia.
10.2.2  Second Breakpoint: Week 42
The shift in collaborative dynamics captured after this date by our metrics, espe-
cially entropy, appeared to reflect a major change in Wikipedia’s social infrastruc-
ture. In this and the weeks that followed, the entropy of collaborative effort on 
Wikipedia reached its highest level, at almost 0.8. At the same time, on November 
1, 2001, the third day of week 42, Wikipedia cofounder Larry Sanger created the 
“Policies and guidelines” page that would eventually serve as the foundation for the 
community’s array of policies (Wikipedia 2017d). The creation of this article in 
particular began the process of formalizing Wikipedia policies in a manner that 
offered a degree of permanence as a master code of conduct, much more so than the 
earlier drafts of individual policies like Wikipedia’s “neutral point of view” (see 
Wales 2001), and it ultimately served as an important step toward guiding editors’ 
efforts in a positive, productive direction.
Although entropy continued to increase in the weeks immediately following this 
change, which might suggest a progression toward relative egalitarianism, in the 
long run Wikipedia’s policies throttled this movement. The effect of Wikipedia’s 
formalized policies would be felt in the more distant future, when the project 
became increasingly dominated by some voices who often used the rules to defend 
their edits (Matei and Dobrescu 2011), while coeditorial connections between high- 
and low-activity editors concurrently declined in prevalence.
10.2.3  Third Breakpoint: Week 54
In terms of broader organizational dynamics, this was a major organizational con-
figuration shift point, which was first identified in Chap. 9. At this point, entropy 
and betweenness centralization began declining, indicating a process of reorganiza-
tion. Some leaders took charge by working in a concerted, focused manner. More 
broadly, week 54 signaled the beginning of a diffusion process in which a functional 
10.2  Identifying Concurrent Factors and Change Modalities

148
leadership style of “leading by doing” emerged. This acted as the beginning of a 
transition phase between bureaucracy and adhocracy.
In the weeks prior to this breakpoint, Wikipedia’s editorial velocity had begun to 
rapidly increase. Between week 42 and week 54, the number of articles that had 
been created and revised jumped from roughly 13,000 to 20,000, and the number of 
authors also climbed from approximately 250 to 500. In other words, Wikipedia 
almost doubled in size.
More authors and more articles also meant more computing time. The growing 
server load started to take its toll, causing persistent performance issues through the 
community. And although Wikipedia was still mostly unnoticed by the outside 
world, members were already concerned that even a single article in a major media 
outlet might spur a flood of new members to the encyclopedia, which could derail 
the site entirely.
In order to cope with this success, university student Magnus Manske began 
developing a new PHP script in summer 2001 that would better manage Wikipedia’s 
resources. This database-driven application was designed to reduce the performance 
problems that plagued the previous UseModWiki content management system.
On January 25, 2002, halfway through week 54, Manske’s script replaced the 
UseModWiki engine on Wikipedia. The use of his script would later become known 
as “Phase II” in contrast with the “Phase I” UseModWiki engine (Mediawiki 2016; 
Wikipedia 2017a). Its introduction enabled a greater amount of activity on Wikipedia 
without users enduring the performance issues that had come to plague the 
UseModWiki-powered Wikipedia.
As a secondary consideration, it should be noted that when the database software 
was transitioned from Phase I to Phase II, only the most recent revision of each 
article was converted to the new system. Another leading Wikipedia developer, 
Brion Vibber, partially restored previous iterations of each article in September 
2002, but it does not appear that the full set of these initial revision records was ever 
completely restored (Mediawiki 2016). The problem of incomplete data was exac-
erbated by the small sample sizes in the beginning stages of Wikipedia’s develop-
ment. Consider that across Wikipedia’s first 53 weeks, revisions were attributed to 
only 444 registered members, while the significance of those revisions as measured 
by their combined delta scores was only 5,786,348. In contrast, in week 250 alone 
over 3,000 new editors joined the Wikipedia community, as the number of regis-
tered members who had made at least one revision increased from 120,630 to 
123,715. Further, the combined delta scores of all revisions made during week 250 
amounted to approximately 15,000,000, so based on the present data set, more than 
twice as much editing activity occurred during week 250 alone than in Wikipedia’s 
first 53 weeks combined.
When taken together, the small number of Wikipedians during its first year of 
development and the fact that the available data on editor activity is incomplete may 
cast some doubt upon the accuracy of measures prior to week 54, as smaller samples 
are likely to generate much greater week-to-week variance and the incomplete data 
further has the potential to be systematically biased. As such, any breakpoints that 
emerged in the year prior to week 54 must be treated with greater scrutiny.
10  Breakpoints and Concurrent Factors

149
10.2.4  Fourth Breakpoint: Week 92
As can be seen from Fig. 10.1, there was a major drop in entropy at the site of this 
breakpoint, the greatest and most dramatic in the entire history of Wikipedia, with 
entropy falling from a relatively high level of 0.7 to just under 0.5. This coincided 
with the launch of Derek Ramsey’s “bot,” or automated user account, which rapidly 
added about 10,000 new articles to Wikipedia corresponding to cities listed in the 
US census (Wikipedia 2017a), doubling the number of articles on the site (see 
Appendix A, Table A.1). Although bots had already seen limited use on Wikipedia 
in handling repetitive tasks, the so-called “rambot” implementation was the first 
large-scale use of bots to systematically write large amounts of content with mini-
mal human supervision.
Rambot created its first article on October 5 (Wikipedia 2016a), and 2 weeks 
later it dramatically increased its activity on Wikipedia, generating a deluge of new 
articles for months to come. Its use would set the standard for the numerous bots 
created ever since (Wikipedia 2017b). More immediately, rambot transformed 
Wikipedia’s division of labor, taking sole responsibility for almost half of the con-
tent added to Wikipedia over a period of several weeks and dramatically shifting the 
community entropy as a result. The dramatic drop in entropy that can be seen in 
week 92 is the product of rambot’s intervention on the site. It is important to note, 
however, that in time, bots declined in importance; historically, their overall impact 
comprises less than 5% of all Wikipedia content (Steiner 2014).
10.2.5  Fifth Breakpoint: Week 142
The week 142 breakpoint fell in September–October 2003, almost exactly 1 year 
after the week 92 breakpoint. The editorial dynamic, as can be seen from Fig. 10.1 
and Appendix A, Table A.2, suggests a slow but significant increase in entropy, and 
the number of articles and revisions was also about to dramatically increase. This is 
the phase that we identified in Part I of this volume as one of “growth.” We did not, 
however, discuss it in Chap. 9 since it did not mark sufficient changes in several 
dimensions. As we will indicate below, this is a momentary signpost that only marks 
a “waypoint” in Wikipedia’s evolutionary process.
Much like our previous breakpoint (week 92), this breakpoint coincided with 
very few revisions to Wikipedia policies. The most noteworthy activity during this 
time was an anonymous editor vandalizing the “Policies and guidelines” page on 
September 8; it was reverted to its original version within 2 min.
10.2  Identifying Concurrent Factors and Change Modalities

150
10.2.6  Sixth Breakpoint: Week 204
The breakpoint for week 204, which occurred at the end of 2004, represented the 
end of the growth period (see Fig. 10.1). Although entropy was inching upward (at 
0.68) and was near the top of the entropy “bulge” during the second half of 
Wikipedia’s evolution, its values were still not as high as those seen during the ini-
tial stages of the project (see Appendix A, Table A.2). More importantly, all of the 
other organizational change dimensions were becoming less relevant. Wikipedia 
would soon reach a state of maturity and stability, after which it would remain in a 
relatively steady state for the rest of the recorded period.
Likewise, in almost 4 years, Wikipedia had accumulated over 700,000 articles 
revised by over 40,000 members. Clearly, Wikipedia stood as a growing social 
medium with a significant following. It also started getting substantial attention 
from the press during this time, appearing in 34 articles in major US newspapers 
during the 5-week assessment period surrounding this breakpoint (for details about 
the press coverage, see Appendix B). Not all of the attention was positive, however. 
As Wikipedia grew, it had attracted the attention of individuals who saw it as the 
perfect target for vandalism. One newspaper article noted that the pages for George 
W. Bush and John Kerry had to be locked in the weeks before the 2004 US presi-
dential election, yet on November 2, election day, Bush’s page was nonetheless 
vandalized twice: the first time, a “Kerry for President” banner appeared over a 
photograph of Bush, and the second time, his picture was replaced with a photo-
graph of Adolf Hitler (Boxer 2004).
In response to the events that brought Wikipedia’s credibility into question, a 
“Verifiability” policy was added to the site’s “Policies and guidelines” page 
(Wikipedia 2017d). This more explicitly highlighted the need for editors to cite 
external sources when adding new content, further raising the standards for 
Wikipedia content and the effort required to make an acceptable contribution. 
“Verifiability” would eventually become one of the most important policies on 
Wikipedia, as is discussed in more detail below. While the policy did not throttle 
participation on its own, it would, in time, contribute to stabilizing the participation 
and contribution regime.
10.2.7  Seventh Breakpoint: Week 250
The week 250 breakpoint, which marked the end of the maturation phase, was found 
in late September 2005. In the period between week 204 and week 250, entropy 
reached a local maximum and then started leveling off. Assortativity and between-
ness centrality, two core indicators for social aggregation in complex bureaucracies, 
steadily approached zero, making it clear that Wikipedia was operating as an adhoc-
racy in full. Along with these configurational developments, content production 
started to grow exponentially. The number of revisions made to Wikipedia would 
10  Breakpoints and Concurrent Factors

151
double in the following 6 months and would double again in the 6-month interval 
after that.
As Wikipedia neared the end of its fifth year, it increasingly became a topic of 
public debate. It was mentioned in 95 separate articles in major US newspapers dur-
ing the five-week period corresponding to the week 250 breakpoint (see Appendix 
B), although again, not all of the attention was positive. On October 3, author 
Nicholas Carr highlighted significant stylistic problems with Wikipedia on his blog, 
specifically using the Bill Gates and Jane Fonda articles as examples of “incoherent 
and dubious” writing (Carr 2005; Langberg 2005). His comment, and the discussion 
that followed, spurred Wikipedia cofounder Jimmy Wales to send several messages 
of his own through the Wikipedia WikiEN-l mailing list on October 6 and 7. 
Although he made it clear that he disagreed with some of Carr’s central points, 
Wales conceded that “[t]he two examples he puts forward are, quite frankly, a hor-
rific embarrassment. [sic] Bill Gates and Jane Fonda are nearly unreadable crap. 
Why? What can we do about it?” (Wales 2005).
Wales’ concession that Wikipedia content may be flawed, at least occasionally, 
quickly became a hot topic in the press, especially since Wikipedia was itself 
becoming increasingly legitimate competition for traditional news media. Many in 
the press latched onto Wales’ words, using them to justify the continued existence 
of journalism professionals like themselves (e.g., Harkin 2005; Orlowski 2005).
Yet, with greater controversy came not only greater scrutiny but also greater 
popularity. By week 250, Wikipedia stood as a rapidly growing resource for infor-
mation and learning, and public discourse around it would hardly stifle that growth.
10.2.8  Eighth Breakpoint: Week 335
This final breakpoint at week 335, corresponding to late May 2007, marked the 
point at which Wikipedia reached a steady state. Setting aside minor vacillations 
and small periodic shifts, all five dimensions being measured were almost com-
pletely level. Even entropy had become linear and flat.
Two major dynamics followed this breakpoint. First, the collaborative dynamic 
surrounding many Wikipedia policy pages dramatically changed. Policy pages, 
documents that record the major decisions made by a group of active and knowl-
edgeable users regarding editorial contributions, content, and interaction dynamics, 
became increasingly difficult to edit. The few revisions made to Wikipedia policies 
during this time tended to involve mere copy editing or, at most, clarifications of 
existing policies. They were either actively protected by old-timers, who watched 
changes and promptly reverted them if they did not fall in line with the established 
consensus, or they were “padlocked” with a protection mechanism that prevented 
changes by ordinary users. By early 2006, only activity on the corresponding talk 
(commentary) pages had increased and only for some of the more controversial 
policies. Many others had organically reached states of relative stability, as 
­individuals who tried to alter them struggled to obtain a consensus from the com-

152
munity, with many fellow editors seeing little need to overturn long-standing 
policy.
Second, a new article by Nicholas Carr, the very same author who lambasted 
Wikipedia just 2  years earlier (Carr 2005, 2007), suggested that Wikipedia had 
become a favored source of reference materials for search engines. By this point, as 
Carr suggested, many searches for common nouns returned a Wikipedia article as 
one of its top results. This was not a concession about Wikipedia’s quality, but if 
nothing else, it illustrated how far Wikipedia had come to be acknowledged, if only 
based upon its widespread use.
Likewise, Wikipedia’s image in the press further evolved. Two hundred one 
major newspaper articles mentioned Wikipedia in the five-week period surrounding 
the week 335 breakpoint alone. More importantly, many of the articles mentioning 
Wikipedia ceased to explain its status as an online encyclopedia that anyone could 
edit, instead merely using it as a source or to provide examples of the key points 
being made within the article (e.g., Cohen 2007; Whyte 2007). In other words, 
Wikipedia’s existence no longer needed to be explained—its use had become so 
widespread that its role in society was common knowledge.
10.3  Systematic Overview of the Factors Shaping 
Wikipedia’s Evolution
Across these eight breakpoints, a consistent theme emerged, with multiple break-
points aligned with major Wikipedia policy changes. The week 7 breakpoint fell in 
line with the introduction of the neutral point of view standard, for instance, while 
the week 42 breakpoint corresponded to the creation of the “Policies and Procedures” 
page. There were also a few prominent Wikipedia events outside of policy changes, 
especially the institution of the Phase II software in week 54 and Jimmy Wales’ 
public admission of substantial writing problems with Wikipedia content near the 
week 250 breakpoint.
Let us start this overview discussion with week 42, which coincides with the 
creation of the “Policies and procedures” page. This page served as the starting 
point for formalizing standards for content and behavior on Wikipedia, giving them 
a degree of permanence by collecting the many distributed policies into a single 
guide and establishing them as a single, unified code of conduct that stood as the 
sole authority for proper Wikipedia discussion and editing decorum.
When Larry Sanger organized the array of Wikipedia policies to make them eas-
ier for editors to find and follow, his actions further established the policies’ impor-
tance to the community. This initiative highlighted the clear expectation that editors 
should know and follow the guidelines. The easier it is to locate and understand the 
“rules,” after all, the less of an excuse there is for not following them (the “Ignore 
all rules” policy notwithstanding).
10  Breakpoints and Concurrent Factors

153
Sanger’s action stood as a significant teleological motor, to use the terminology 
proposed in Chap. 8, thus raising the standard for contributions to Wikipedia. Since 
it became clear to users that they would have to devote a substantial amount of effort 
in order to make an acceptable revision to a given Wikipedia article, editors were 
prevented from simply flooding Wikipedia with lackluster content to boost their 
own standing through the sheer number of contributions. It would be natural to 
expect entropy to decline as a result of these stricter standards—not all users have 
the time to develop pages upon pages of well-crafted content, so stratification 
between top editors and the rest would be quite likely—and values of the measure 
did indeed fall after Sanger’s addition.
Moving to the week 54 breakpoint, the major change in Wikipedia software 
architecture prompted a key organizational shift. Wikipedia moved from the 
UseModWiki database engine to the PHP script written by Magnus Manske. On the 
broadest scale, this had two very important effects on the project and the present 
data set. First, at least for a time, it resolved the performance issues that had been 
making editing more difficult for Wikipedians since the middle of 2001. This facili-
tated much greater, more consistent activity on Wikipedia without generating sub-
stantial slowdowns like what some editors had experienced in the past. Just as 
importantly, however, when Wikipedia changed to the Phase II architecture, not all 
revisions to existing articles were maintained, and the records of earlier revisions 
were only partially restored later.
In fact, this revelation about the incomplete data prior to week 54 might place the 
week 54 breakpoint itself in doubt. If there was a systematic bias in values of the 
measures taken before week 54, then that could, conceivably, be the cause of the 
breakpoint itself. On the other hand, if revisions were lost at random rather than as 
the result of a particular pattern, then any effect on values of the five key measures 
used in this study would be negligible, so the breakpoint would indeed have been 
the result of behavioral changes among editors rather than a mere result of missing 
data.
With that in mind, it is to be expected that the measures taken before week 54 
would have greater variance than those that came afterward due to the reduced sam-
ple size. This alone would not have erroneously caused the week 54 breakpoint, 
however, as changes in variance would not have presented as breakpoints within the 
regression-based approach for identifying phase shifts.
The only way, then, that the missing data would have falsely generated the week 
54 breakpoint would be if it presented a systematic bias that altered a given measure 
to make it consistently higher or lower than its true value. In that instance, we would 
expect the week 54 breakpoint to be punctuated by a substantial discontinuous jump 
like that observed for entropy at weeks 92 and 93 (see Fig. 10.3), not merely a 
change in the slope of the line. If, for instance, the measures for betweenness cen-
tralization were consistently much greater than they should have been, that shift 
would be immediately reflected at week 54 as the bias was instantaneously cor-
rected. A close examination of Fig. 10.4, however, reveals that this was not the case.
Certainly, the fitted values for betweenness centralization changed dramatically 
at week 54, but the observed values themselves began a slower path downward

rather than instantly changing to match the rightmost portion of the regression line. 
Since betweenness centralization began a sharp decline at week 54—not an imme-
diate reversion back to “true” values—it suggests that there was no systematic error 
in the measure prior to week 54. Rather, the community merely changed course as 
a result of the transition to the Phase II architecture, allowing members to more 
freely cross boundaries and connect with one another, escaping the bureaucratic 
structure that had been developing over Wikipedia’s first year.
To return to the discussion of the week 54 breakpoint, as Wikipedia grew, it 
was inevitable that it would eventually have to change its software in order to 
allow more editors to offer more contributions without the system breaking down. 
A growing community requires a larger infrastructure, after all. As such, this 
upgrade to the Phase II architecture and the resulting shift in Wikipedia’s configu-
rational trajectory were the result of a life-cycle motor, to use the terms presented 
in Chap. 8. To put it simply, just as a growing child will need larger clothes over 
time, by the end of its first year the community of Wikipedia editors had outgrown 
its initial system.
Just as the continuous nature of the week 54 breakpoint helps us to verify its 
veracity, we may also trust in the continuous breakpoint observed at week 42. At 
this point, entropy clearly peaked rather than exhibiting a discontinuous shift that 
would have indicated a systematic bias for measures taken prior to week 42. 
Statistically speaking, the fact that this breakpoint also appears in the form of con-
tinuous connections between the line segments on either side suggests that it was 
not merely spawned by systematically biased observations on one side of the break-
point, despite the greater variance for observations prior to week 54.
With that being said, the lost data prior to week 54 may weaken the value of the 
breakpoint for week 7. As is clear from Fig. 10.3, the first two segments of the plot 
(corresponding to weeks 4–6 and 7–9, respectively) are nearly vertical, suggesting 
dramatic changes even within these segments. If we were to accept this breakpoint 
as it is, we would have to conclude that entropy started near its maximum in week 4 
and then plummeted, yet suddenly reversed direction and skyrocketed beginning in 
week 7.
While this is within the realm of possibility, the following might be a better 
explanation. Consider, instead, the aforementioned fact that in Wikipedia’s first 
10 weeks, very few people on earth had ever heard of it, so there were exceedingly 
few individuals taking part in what was, at the time, merely an experiment 
designed to attract more attention to a related effort, Nupedia (Mediawiki 2016). 
By week 10, only 21 unique editors existed within the Wikipedia data set, and not 
all of their contributions may even have been available in full due to the revisions 
lost during the change to Phase II. With such little activity in the community, there 
was a great deal of week-to-week variability in the community based on how a 
very small number of people happened to behave on any given day. In this light, 
the dramatic changes that occurred in Wikipedia’s first 10 weeks seem more like 
random fluctuations than fundamental changes to the organizational 
configuration.
10.3  Systematic Overview of the Factors Shaping Wikipedia’s Evolution

156
This leaves the introduction of the neutral point of view policy as the only other 
realistic explanatory mechanism for the breakpoint observed at week 7. It is reason-
able to suspect that the introduction of this critical policy might have had some 
effect. But at the same time, this foundational policy was introduced on February 
16, 2001, barely a month after Wikipedia’s January 15 launch, making it difficult to 
separate the policy from the launch itself. After all, Wales himself framed the policy 
as a mere clarification of Wikipedia’s role as an encyclopedia, something which was 
implicit in the creation of Wikipedia itself. Certainly, the formalization of Wikipedia 
policies can have a significant effect, as has been previously discussed. Yet, since 
this initial policy came so soon after Wikipedia’s launch, at a point in time when the 
entire data set still contained just eight registered members, it is easy to treat the 
policy invocation as part and parcel with the launch itself.
More to the point, even if one believes that the neutral point of view policy really 
could offer an explanatory mechanism for a breakpoint, the fact remains that the 
breakpoint itself is in doubt. With such high variability within the first few weeks of 
the data set due to both low membership and incomplete revision data for the very 
small number of editors within that period, it is much easier to conclude that the 
breakpoint for weeks 7 and 10 was simply a product of random noise. Yes, it is 
likely that the neutral point of view policy had some sort of effect on Wikipedia, but 
a causal link cannot reasonably be established between the creation of that policy 
and the particular changes observed at weeks 7 and 10. It is much more likely that 
this breakpoint was nothing more than a statistical artifact borne of missing and 
minimal data. As already mentioned in Chap. 5, it was not directly used in our first 
evolutionary model, as it offers minimal explanatory power.
The week 92 breakpoint, in contrast, occurred well after Wikipedia was estab-
lished, and it aligns with a major concurrent factor. During this period, we saw the 
activation of “rambot” to expediently create thousands of articles on various US 
cities using census data. While rambot’s efforts began on October 5, 2002, in 
Wikipedia’s 90th week, it was fully unleashed 2 weeks later, during week 92. Within 
this week alone, the combined delta value of all of rambot’s revisions was over 8.86 
million, and in week 93, its efforts as measured by delta amounted to approximately 
15.1 million. To put that figure in perspective, the combined efforts of all revisions 
made to Wikipedia by registered users in week 91 summed to a delta value of only 
18.6 million, so rambot’s presence alone nearly doubled the amount of content 
being produced on Wikipedia on a weekly basis.
This naturally caused the entropy measure to plummet, as this one automated 
editor controlled a tremendous amount of Wikipedia’s content. However, since few 
other editors were actively engaging with these newly created articles, many of 
which dealt with relatively obscure cities, rambot did not become a central figure in 
the collaboration network, so its presence had minimal effect on the centralization 
and assortativity measures even as it fundamentally altered the division of labor on 
Wikipedia. Moreover, in the years to come, its contributions would become a meta-
phorical drop in the ocean.
Yet, Derek Ramsey’s decision to implement rambot constituted a powerful teleo-
logical force on the organization, as his actions changed, at least for a while, the 
10  Breakpoints and Concurrent Factors

157
division of labor on Wikipedia. With that said, it did not necessarily alter Wikipedia’s 
progress toward an adhocracy as observed through Fig. 10.1. Rather, the trajectory 
of Wikipedia’s development was moving toward an adhocracy before the week 92 
breakpoint, and it continued to do so afterward. The only difference is that labor 
gradually became more evenly divided after the breakpoint (corresponding to rising 
entropy values) as opposed to the declining entropy levels that preceded the break-
point. Both trends were, in fact, converging toward the same moderately high 
entropy values. From a practical standpoint, after the introduction of rambot, more 
and more members had to arrive and increase their contribution rates in order to 
counterbalance the significant efforts of the new bot in pursuit of the archetypal 
adhocracy.
Moving forward, when examining the week 142 and week 204 breakpoints, we 
may observe that outbound degree centralization—the measure in which the break-
points were observed—appears to hold a wave shape (Fig. 10.5).
Visually, it does appear that there is a slight dip in the data between weeks 142 
and 204, suggesting that the detection of two breakpoints in this area is well justi-
fied. Yet, when we consider the entire picture and the significance of key events 
during this period, these breakpoints seem to be purely developmental, correspond-
ing only to the natural growth (i.e., the life cycle) of the organization. As has already 
been mentioned, the only significant incident occurring around week 142 was the 
vandalization of the “Policies and guidelines” page, which was reverted to its origi-
nal version within 2 min of the incident, thereby mitigating any long-term ramifica-
tions. It is thus safe to conclude that this breakpoint is relatively inconsequential as 
far as revolutionary change is concerned.
The week 204, however, coincided with a more consequential event, as the 
“Verifiability” policy was added to the master “Policies and guidelines” page around 
this time. But this development demands closer attention. It is true that “Verifiability” 
stands as one of the three core content policies on Wikipedia, alongside “Neutral 
point of view” and “No original research.” At the time, however, this trio had not yet 
been established as the core of Wikipedia’s governing policies, so “Verifiability” 
was just one of many, many policies active on Wikipedia. In fact, when it was added 
to the “Policies and guidelines” page, it was simply inserted into a block of listed 
rules, with nothing indicating that it was any more or less important than any other 
policy in the community. Following this logic, if the mere addition of the 
“Verifiability” policy to this master list was enough to spark an organizational shift 
on Wikipedia, then the addition of any other policy should have had a similar effect. 
Such changes were not observed every time a new policy was added to the “Policies 
and guidelines” page, so there is no particular reason why “Verifiability,” which was 
not yet deemed especially important, would have been any different.
In the end, if we look at the overall graph outbound degree centralization values, 
we can observe an apparent sinusoidal curve following the red trend line both before 
the week 142 breakpoint and after that for week 204. Although the period from 
weeks 142 to 204 does appear to follow a slightly different path, the overall curve 
seems to have been unaffected by the segment between these two breakpoints. 
Therefore, we may tentatively say that the week 142 and week 204 breakpoints are 
10.3  Systematic Overview of the Factors Shaping Wikipedia’s Evolution

158
relatively weak compared to the others that we have discussed, as they do not cor-
respond to any major changes in policies, standard practices, or technological 
changes, and certainly not organizational configurations; in fact, any effect that they 
may have held seems to have been temporary. The most that we can claim is the 
possible role of life-cycle change motors near the end of Wikipedia’s third and 
fourth years, around the time that Wikipedia entered and consolidated its maturity 
phase. Otherwise, the impact of those motors is limited at best.
The concurrent motors surrounding the week 250 breakpoint, on the other hand, 
demand closer inspection. At this point, Nicholas Carr’s blog (Carr 2005) had drawn 
Jimmy Wales into a debate on the value of the content produced on Wikipedia, and 
Wales admitted that Wikipedia content was, in some cases, “unreadable crap.” This 
concession reverberated through Wikipedia, resulting in a wave of activism that led 
to new tools and methods to improve content quality. For instance, the “Barnstar” 
program (Wikipedia 2005a), through which active and “quality” users are rewarded 
with a star of recognition, had appeared in late 2004; in response to Wales’ com-
ments, it markedly increased in use. Likewise, the “featured article” designation, 
which had begun a few months beforehand, similarly increased in prevalence 
(Wikipedia 2005b). Such quality checks, in concert with the general debate about 
Wikipedia as a whole, may have attracted new contributors to the project.
In terms of inner collaborative dynamics, values of the entropy measure climbed 
for quite some time before the week 250 breakpoint, and they had only tailed

­downward at the end of a curvilinear segment shortly before the breakpoint. After 
Wales’ admission, entropy continued to decline, indicating a growing tendency 
toward structuration, but it would begin to level off in the months and years to come.
One may surmise that Wales’ admission shamed those who read it, leading to a 
more “take charge” attitude. Of course, the most likely readers of the Wikipedia 
WikiEN-l listserv were those editors who were dedicated enough to Wikipedia to 
subscribe to it. Therefore, it is quite likely that when those dedicated editors read 
Wales’ message, it spurred them into action, and for much of the following year, 
they took on a greater amount of the editing workload themselves in order to per-
sonally ensure its quality. The goal of Wales’ message, after all, was to fix the prob-
lems that Nicholas Carr had revealed, so it is hardly a stretch to suppose that Wales 
accomplished his goal through his ensuing conversations with the most dedicated 
Wikipedia editors. It would make sense, then, that the dialogue gave those editors a 
reason to work harder to refine the project and to push the community toward 
higher-quality work overall, so Wales’ admission and the discussion about quality 
control that followed constituted a dialectic change on Wikipedia. In short, the most 
active editors took matters into their own hands by doing more of the work them-
selves, which increased the proportion of effort concentrated at the “top” of the 
project.
This leaves only the week 335 breakpoint. At this point in time, entropy exhib-
ited a minor peak, but it was still almost unchanged from its existing trajectory, and 
it would remain around the same level for some time to come. As we can see from 
Fig. 10.1, assortativity was exceedingly close to zero, as was betweenness central-
ization. Inbound and outbound degree centralization were declining somewhat, but 
their movement was minimal and generally flat. Thus, this breakpoint serves as an 
indication that although Wikipedia’s entropy level had “leveled off,” its stability was 
driven by more intense lateral connections, which strengthens the claim that it had 
entered a period of adhocracy.
There were no major changes in the policy and “political” life of the project 
around this time. The talk pages corresponding to many policies featured a consid-
erable amount of activity, but this had been the case for over a year, so its continua-
tion would constitute an evolutionary change, if anything, rather than a revolution. 
Similarly, Wikipedia had become common enough knowledge that the news media 
did not have to explain it, but the project’s gradual exposure to the public was also 
an evolutionary change spanning many years; it had nothing to do with a Wikipedia 
revolution.
All told, this breakpoint seemed to constitute a fairly minor adjustment of 
Wikipedia’s existing trajectory toward the pure adhocracy archetype. The likeliest 
conclusion is that the motor behind that adjustment was a purely endogenous life-
cycle modality, but even this cannot be claimed with any real certainty.

10.4  Conclusion
This chapter aimed to identify the policy, managerial, and socio-technical factors 
that influenced Wikipedia’s evolutionary process. We observe these forces as unique 
events that operated alongside internal, structural factors. Consequently, our above 
discussion was descriptive, aiming to “connect the dots” related to the observed 
statistical changes in quantitative measurements. To that end, this discussion comes 
as a complement, not a supplement, to the more rigorous discussion about 
Wikipedia’s organizational change discussed in the previous chapter. When we con-
nect the rigorous, formal model developed in Chaps. 6, 7, 8, and 9—dealing with 
the structural differentiation factors and organizational configuration dimensions 
through which Wikipedia’s growth is broken into phases—with the more idio-
graphic, descriptive analysis contained in this chapter, we obtain the summary pre-
sented in Table 10.1.
For each major breakpoint, we have a major change in policies or internal dynam-
ics. More specifically, the week 42 breakpoint represented a legitimate revolution-
ary change, as Larry Sanger created the “Policies and guidelines” page as a master 
code of conduct for Wikipedia editors. Based on the descriptions provided in the 
previous chapters, this served as a “teleological” motor through which the work 
started to be more projective and driven by a clearer end goal. This raised the stan-
dard for editing, and since more effort was demanded for each contribution, it con-
sequently became harder for a large group of editors to all contribute massive 
amounts of content. Rather, a few especially dedicated editors provided especially 
substantial work, while others only contributed to the extent that they were able. In 
other words, the knowledge-production process became more stratified.
In week 54, Wikipedia’s database system was upgraded in order to handle 
increasing amounts of activity. This resolved long-standing performance issues with 
the site, allowing users to more freely and quickly explore different articles and col-
laborate with a wider range of peers on a wider range of articles. We may speculate 
that this broke up the hierarchy that had been developing between the majority of 
users who could only spare the time to work on a few isolated articles and those few 
who weathered the frustration of slowdown and database errors to oversee a wide 
range of articles—with a better database system, all editors could more quickly 
engage with many more articles than they ever had before, so they were free to 
explore many different domains. This was a necessary step along Wikipedia’s life 
cycle, and it allowed the organization to abandon its progression toward a machine 
hierarchy and begin moving toward an adhocratic structure instead.
At week 92, the automated user later known as rambot began adding countless 
articles to Wikipedia, quickly becoming responsible for a disproportionate amount 
of the content produced. This would radically shift the overall division of labor, 
instantly reducing entropy throughout the community. This was, however, a tempo-
rary disturbance; by the end of the 9.5-year period examined here, bots were only 
responsible for a small minority of content on Wikipedia. And, even in the aftermath 
of this breakpoint, Wikipedia still progressed toward an adhocracy, with entropy 
10  Breakpoints and Concurrent Factors

161
increasing toward the expected values that would suggest an adhocratic archetype. 
This major breakpoint, like the one observed for week 54, was both momentous and 
accidental, at least in the sense that it did not constitute an explicit, deliberate effort 
to change Wikipedia. Nonetheless, although the large amount of content that was 
automatically generated by this one actor only had a temporary effect on entropy 
levels within the collaborative community, its significance should not be under-
stated, as this development opened the metaphorical floodgates to new possibilities 
for contributions within the Wikipedia project.
In contrast, the breakpoints corresponding to weeks 142 and 204 appeared to be 
simple road markers. Wikipedia merely went through a slow phase of maturity, 
which included a relative peak in entropy.
Around week 250, Jimmy Wales admitted through the WikiEN-l mailing list that 
some Wikipedia content was atrocious, shaming both himself and those editors who 
were dedicated enough to Wikipedia to subscribe to the mailing list and see his mes-

the problem, and their discussions spurred the most dedicated editors to take even 
more of the workload upon themselves to ensure that it would maintain a higher 
quality. This dialogue between Wales and the other editors represented a dialectic

motor that drove entropy downward and, more to Wales’ point, pushed the quality 
of articles upward. At this time, the use of “Barnstars” and the “featured article” 
designation, both of which had recently been introduced, dramatically increased as 
prevalent mechanisms to highlight high-quality editors and editorial products. 
Nonetheless, Wikipedia still continued to become an example of the adhocracy 
archetype; this revolution was just a minor adjustment along the route to that 
destination.
Finally, the week 335 breakpoint represented a very minor adjustment that stabi-
lized entropy on Wikipedia and helped to nudge it toward an especially pure form 
of the adhocracy archetype. This breakpoint marked the point at which Wikipedia 
reached a stable, balanced state, so the process of structuration could be considered 
to be complete in its own right.
In the final chapter of this volume, we will summarize the entire story of this 
evolution, highlighting some of the core processes, the evolutionary patterns, and 
the significant interplay between leaders, adhocratic tendencies, and evolutionary 
processes. This concluding chapter will also reconnect the narratives of Parts I and 
II of this volume with one another and with the broader framework of social 
differentiation.

Conclusions
11.1  Overall Narrative
The core argument of this volume can be summarized as follows. The unequal dis-
tribution of effort found in social media projects is not a mere accident, but a fact of 
life. A group of very productive users dominates the collaborative process due to a 
natural trend toward social differentiation. Contribution patterns differentiate lead-
ers from followers relatively early in the process, which offers a convenient and 
flexible (adhocratic) mechanism of coordination and control through a functional 
response: leading means achieving by doing the most. The metaphorical “1% effect” 
in the title of this volume makes a direct allusion to this process. In time, online col-
laborative projects set aside a selected group of individuals to “make a difference.” 
Their role is to differentiate the project from its competitors, while they, themselves, 
are differentiated as working leaders or, to apply a term used on several occasions 
in this volume, as functional leaders. Another way to understand the “1% effect” is 
by stating that the contribution leaders are “constitutive.” Their efforts generate the 
momentum needed for the growth of the project.
The volume goes, however, beyond this relatively simple statement, further 
revealing how and by what means the process of growth takes place, including the 
discrete phases in the process of differentiation. For each phase, we also propose a 
specific type of organizational configuration exemplified by that phase: simple 
structure, machine bureaucracy, and adhocracy. The latter is also found to be the 
dominant form of organization, which is proposed as a structural framework for 
understanding structural differentiation in established social media.
At a more general level, this volume makes a broader point. Online collaborative 
organizations are, like many other human endeavors, regular affairs. They coalesce, 
grow, and reach an optimal state under the imperative of social structuration. Social 
structuration, in turn, is the product of social differentiation. Participants in online 
collaborative organizations assume roles that differentiate them based upon the 
quantity and quality of work performed, meaning that this role assumption leads to 

168
an uneven distribution of effort. Thus, a key sign of social differentiation is the 
emergence of an uneven effort distribution.
Of course, an uneven effort distribution alone does not automatically translate 
into social organization. So, to better detect social organization, we proposed a mea-
sure that more directly taps into the meaningful significance of uneven distributions. 
This is social entropy, a concept that we carry over from information science. We 
treat social systems in a manner similar to communication systems, making the 
assumption that even distributions of system elements across levels of possible 
states indicate a lack of order (randomness) and, consequently, a maximum level of 
entropy. As entropy declines, some system elements occur at higher rates than oth-
ers, and social order can be detected. In more tangible and directly intuitive terms, 
order appears when some individuals assume leadership positions by working sub-
stantially more than others and thus shaping the project to a greater degree.
This differentiation, however, does not necessitate that leading roles be accompa-
nied by the power to order collaborators to do certain things. In other words, a lead-
ership position does not have to have ascribed powers that explicitly differentiate 
“leaders” from the rest of the contributors. Working more, shaping more of the prod-
uct, and intervening more in the collaboration process serve as implicit, not explicit, 
forms of command and control. In short, leading is doing. This is, in fact, the most 
common modality by which online structuration via differentiation occurs. Thus, as 
a corollary, we can also say that social organization online is implicit, not explicit.
Our research on the evolution of effort or collaborative entropy on Wikipedia 
also suggests that social order is evolutionary in nature. Group structures change 
over time. A claim of structural differentiation would not be complete unless it was 
accompanied by discrete phases in the evolution of entropy and in the uneven distri-
bution of effort. With that in mind, when we analyzed entropy on its own, we 
detected discrete phases typically associated with communities of practice, includ-
ing those of potential, coalescence, maturity, and stabilization.
We then enhanced this model with an organizational configuration perspective 
through which we proposed that Wikipedia gained its potential as a simple organiza-
tion, coalesced under the guise of a quasi-bureaucracy, and ultimately matured into an 
adhocracy. We proposed a new method to detect the boundaries of the organizational 
configurations and the criteria for their identification (Chap. 9). Finally, in Chap. 10 
we proposed a series of factors whose occurrence coincided with the major changes 
that we observed, allowing us to explain the manner in which socio-­technical deci-
sions and events outside the collaborative space impacted Wikipedia’s transformation. 
As a whole, the introduction of policies, debates, and even interventions by automated 
scripts (“bots”) played unique roles in shaping Wikipedia’s trajectory of growth.
11.2  Elites and Social Structuration
One specific contribution of our volume was that of a dual focus that blended global 
and more local, elite-specific processes. Social order, after all, is a complex reality 
that can only be properly captured through triangulation. Consequently, social

entropy or network graph measures at the global (system) level are not always 
­sufficient. They need to be complemented by observations of the elite members’ 
resilience over time, as social order is present to a greater degree when an uneven 
distribution of effort is present and some individuals are, in actuality, present at the 
top of the work pyramid for longer periods of time.
We measured the resilience of the top 1% contributor elite over time and learned 
that there is, indeed, considerable “elite stickiness” on Wikipedia. On average, 
across the entire period of the project, an individual identified as a top contributor in 
a given 5-week interval had a 40% chance of still being in the top contributor group 
during the following period. This stickiness, when taken over 20 weeks, was 32%, 
and even over 30 weeks it remained at 28%.
In a second analytic step, we used lagged regression to determine the relationship 
between social structuration (functional differentiation) and elite stickiness over 
time. The results indicated that stickiness is the product of social differentiation. As 
the collaborative project became more orderly and contributors were differentiated 
into an elite group and ordinary members, the elite also became stable. This sug-
gests an organic process by which elites are borne out of functional differentiation, 
not vice versa. To put it another way, the process is bottom-up, not top-down. Elites 
do not precede structuration, and they do not impose it. Rather, they naturally 
emerge as the group becomes increasingly structured in terms of the effort contrib-
uted over time.
The function and abilities of the functional elite, however, are not extensively 
regulated by formal rules and procedures. Although some rules decide what content 
can be retained or treated as “spam” (promotional content) or vandalism (disruptive 
content), in the end it is the raw quantity of one’s contributions that decides how 
much is to be preserved and who is a “leader.” Further, elites do change over time, 
and with these changes come functional transitions between various types of orga-
nizational configurations. The most important of these is the transition to “adhoc-
racy,” a form of social organization and leadership in which roles are functional and 
their occupancy is temporary, acting as a function of the work that is effectively 
performed.
To paraphrase a dictionary definition, adhocracy does not rely on role descrip-
tions, bylaws, and organizational charts. Work is done because it needs to be done, 
not because of explicit rules and norms that define who is supposed to do what and 
in what amount. As individual contributors come and go, and as promotion to the 
elite group ebbs and flows, the social structure organically reshapes itself. Thus, 
those who lead are those who “are there.” Adhocracy, then, as a term, suggests a 
simple idea: adhocracy is the rule of those who are there.
The transition to adhocracy and its differentiation from several other types of 
organizational configurations (simple structure, machine bureaucracy, professional 
bureaucracy, or diversified/divisionalized organizations) was not merely assessed 
indirectly through our analysis of elite resilience. Rather, we captured the emer-
gence of adhocracy by looking at a broader set of specific indicators: collaborative 
attractiveness and extroversion, communication flow, partner choice trends, and 
structural order. To measure these factors, we took a network analysis approach. 
11.2  Elites and Social Structuration

170
Collaborative attractiveness was represented as inbound degree centralization, 
while extroversion was operationalized as outbound degree centralization. We used 
assortativity to discern trends in partner choices among fellow collaborations, and 
the structure of communication flows, in turn, was modeled using betweenness cen-
tralization. Finally, structural order was captured directly through collaborative 
entropy.
These dimensions and measures, which map onto our set of five organizational 
configuration dimensions, jointly define the patterns of collaboration and contribu-
tion differentiation within the project. Assortativity, for example, captures the likeli-
hood of elite interaction with nonelites, while the other three measures capture the 
degree to which individuals initiate, receive, or mediate collaborative ties. The five 
indicators provide a representation of the five organizational configurations articu-
lated by Mintzberg (1979), and specific combinations at various levels of these 
dimensions indicate transitions from one type of organizational configuration to 
another. As discussed in Part II of this volume, we used this approach to determine 
that Wikipedia started with a simple structure, similar to a mom-and-pop business, 
in which work was performed in small groups of highly motivated individuals. This 
transitioned to a relatively short period of machine bureaucracy, characterized by a 
significant degree of differentiation among collaborators, and was followed by the 
most stable phase, that of adhocratic collaboration.
Beyond specific findings regarding the presence of or transitions between spe-
cific organizational configurations, our research converges on a proposition of 
greater significance: namely, online environments naturally create social structures 
that are organized around quasi-stable roles. The dual processes of structural dif-
ferentiation and role allocation are also detectable in online collaborative environ-
ments, and through this assessment, the “mystery” of online inequality becomes 
easy to understand. Although online environments do invite new voices and partici-
pants into the social production game, these need not and will not end up in a state 
of equality. In other words, equality of opportunities to participate does not translate 
into equality of results. In fact, by the very logic of the measure that we used in our 
study, entropy, a space that is perfectly egalitarian, would also be the most 
random.
On a side note, our approach also suggests that the quest for equality at all costs 
might actually be counterproductive. All that such a blind effort will yield is maxi-
mum entropy, which is the opposite of what we should seek to create: more mean-
ingful, functional, and structured online organizations. This issue will be developed 
further in future research.
More importantly, uneven distributions are not the product of mere power grabs 
(even though such political activities may indeed take place online), but of the sim-
ple fact that successful collaborative projects need leaders. Such leaders are not, 
however, authority figures in the traditional sense—that is, their leadership is not 
derived from externally prescribed authority bestowed through regulations, organi-
zational charts, and strictly defined control mechanisms with minute rules that dic-
tate who can do what and to what effect. Rather, their ad hoc authority is defined by 
how much they do in terms of effective work and effort spent on the project.
11  Conclusions

171
Likewise, advancement to an elite position is itself a function of hard work. Our 
results also show that working with former members of the elite is not related to 
one’s presence in the elite at a future point in time, meaning that the elite do not 
reach that stature through mere cronyism. Moreover, one’s authority lasts only as 
long as he or she continues to perform work. If leaders slack on the job, their power 
vanishes. There are no “idle aristocrats” and “absentee landlords” on Wikipedia or 
in other social media collaborative groups.
11.3  Looking Forward: Wisdom of the Differentiated Crowd
Ultimately, these findings illuminate several key points that have dramatic ramifica-
tions for modern online organizations. First and foremost, Wikipedia was never an 
egalitarian utopia. This is not a new finding, as a number of other researchers have 
come to the same conclusion (Shaw and Hill 2014), but since public misconceptions 
on this front existed (Lih 2009), it is worth repeating this point (Matei and Bruno 
2015; Matei and Foote 2015).
As we have shown, Wikipedia is dominated at large by a small set of members 
who contributed the vast majority of content to the collaborative effort. Likewise, 
most individual articles are similarly commanded by a few key editors who largely 
dictate the collaboration, with many other individuals “chipping in” as necessary 
with comparatively minor revisions. As we and other researchers indicate, the roles 
are in fact very diverse and complex, which suggests that Wikipedia is a complex 
mechanism (Arazy et al. 2015).
Thus, the role differentiation observed on Wikipedia is a process to be reckoned 
with. All facets of the collaborative effort, large and small, experience stratification 
wherein a few individuals take charge and everyone else follows their lead. Size is 
largely irrelevant for this role differentiation: even the smallest elements of the com-
munity have leaders and followers, and regardless of how attractive egalitarianism 
may sound, the natural emergence of this social structure appears to have benefitted 
Wikipedia.
Despite our personal inclinations, when we work atop or within an organization, 
we must resist our instinct to pursue absolute equality among all contributors. Role 
differentiation, unromantic though the notion may be, is important for organiza-
tional success, so leaders should foster the emergence of such distinctions among 
members rather than seeking homogenization. This is just as true in the online realm 
as it is offline, even if other aspects of collaboration may change.
11.4  The Fallacy of the Mini-Wikipedia
As is often forgotten, large-scale collaborative groups, as with organizations of any 
nature, did not merely emerge in years past as smaller-scale versions of themselves 
that are otherwise identical to their current forms. Case in point: Wikipedia, in its 
11.4  The Fallacy of the Mini-Wikipedia

172
earliest days, was not the adhocracy that we observe now. It instead functioned akin 
to a small business, like the classic mom-and-pop store, and only when it outgrew 
those constraints could it transcend its initial configuration—though, unlike most 
major corporations, Wikipedia eschewed some tendencies toward a bureaucratic 
organization and instead found stability as the adhocracy that we know today.
This is not a trivial realization. We are frequently driven to compare current indi-
viduals, groups, and products against their predecessors, assuming that the best of 
tomorrow will look like a smaller, younger clone of the gold standard from today. Is 
LeBron James the next Michael Jordan? What company will be the next Walmart, 
or the next Chipotle? Who is the next American Idol (following in the footsteps of 
Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood, the “gold standards” of popular and finan-
cial achievement, rather than the other not-as-successful winners)?
But in looking for the “next Wikipedia,” we should not attempt to find collabora-
tive communities that already resemble the Wikipedia of today. Those organizations 
most likely to find similar prosperity as Wikipedia are those that presently operate 
as budding small groups, with a growing membership that has the potential to tran-
scend their simple structures and grow along the same path as their predecessor. In 
other words, organizations aiming to emulate Wikipedia must follow in its footsteps 
rather than attempting to start at the end point of Wikipedia’s journey. It is not 
enough to merely make a “mini-Wikipedia” based only on what we observe today 
and then to just sit back and wait for contributors to join and fill the void.
11.5  Embracing Revolution
Just as it is important to trace the footsteps of Wikipedia’s growth, there are lessons 
to be drawn from the jumps between those footsteps, as well. As our research has 
shown, Wikipedia proceeded through several distinct phases in its first several years, 
each of which was marked by a moment of change that served to redefine the col-
laborative community as a whole. In other words, Wikipedia’s growth was not 
solely one of gradual, incremental evolution. It also involved revolutionary shifts 
that fundamentally and permanently redefined the organization as a whole.
This is a key point for leaders of online startup organizations to recognize as they 
chart the growth of their respective endeavors over time. As Wikipedia’s leaders 
realized, for instance, while the system architecture that initially facilitated contri-
butions was sufficient in its earliest days—when, from an organizational stand-
point, it still functioned as a simple structure—technical limitations eventually 
became a force that inhibited further growth. Only once the existing editing and 
publishing engine was replaced was Wikipedia able to grow beyond its initial con-
ception as an experiment and support a long-term community of members (Britt 
2013; Mediawiki 2016).
Not coincidentally, this was also the point at which Wikipedia’s configuration 
transitioned from its original path, which it had been following toward a machine 
bureaucracy, and began moving toward an adhocratic system instead. In other 
11  Conclusions

173
words, social and organizational change online may be accompanied by ­technological 
transformation. Yet technology is not destiny, as social and organizational forces are 
more important, to a certain extent, than technological ones—after all, if Wikipedia’s 
users were bound by their technologies with no agency of their own, then the site 
would still be using its Phase I engine, and we likely would not be talking about the 
collaborative group today.
The most important takeaway from this is that organizational leaders need to be 
ready and willing to catalyze (or at least enable) dramatic, earthshaking changes in 
their organizations when they are ready to grow. As an organization expands, it will 
inevitably encounter barriers that inhibit further growth. A wise leader will be ready 
to break down those barriers, freeing the organization to continue to grow.
Furthermore, such growth will not always be expected, and in some eyes, it may 
not even be desirable. For example, the abandonment of the first technological infra-
structure, the so-called UseModWiki editing and publishing engine (Wikipedia 
2016), and the adoption of the increasingly complex MediaWiki platform (Wikipedia 
2017), while a necessary step in Wikipedia’s development, also facilitated later 
developments like the introduction of large-scale editing bots. These bots, computer-­
automated editing tasks triggered by the addition, change, or presence of specific 
types of article content or editing behaviors, made Wikipedia an even more complex 
socio-technical laboratory. At the time of the first bot’s activation in 2002, however, 
many members viewed the use of automated editing software like “rambot” as a 
potential source of devastation that could drive the growing project to ruin. Bots 
quickly became a hot-button issue in the community, particularly due to the signifi-
cant technical issues that sometimes resulted from their use. Ultimately, discussions 
among concerned members resulted in the creation of a formal bot policy that 
allowed the continued use of bots but set limits on their application in order to pre-
vent Wikipedia from descending into chaos.
Today, bots play a vital role on Wikipedia, performing a wide range of tasks such 
as cleaning up articles so that they meet Wikipedia’s presentation standards and 
mining external databases in order to create new articles and populate existing ones 
with content. Yet permitting bots, while an important step for Wikipedia’s develop-
ment, was one that filled many Wikipedians with trepidation at the time. Still, 
regardless of one’s fears that an idyllic organization may be ruined by dramatic 
changes, it is often necessary to embrace those changes and foster revolution in 
order to allow the organization to reach its potential. The old saying, “If it ain’t 
broke, don’t fix it,” no longer applies.
This, however, does not mean that revolution should be incited for its own sake. 
As we have shown, Wikipedia largely stabilized midway through its seventh year 
and has not undergone any substantial revolution since then; for that matter, even 
those revolutionary moments that we detected after 2003 were of much less conse-
quence than those that came before. Furthermore, even bot contributions are a rela-
tively minor part of the English Wikipedia’s editorial life today. Not factoring in edit 
size, only 5% of individual edits are performed by bots (Steiner 2014), and given 
that many such automated edits constitute minor stylistic adjustments, their overall 
workload is quite small compared with the community of human editors. Therefore, 
11.5  Embracing Revolution

174
it is not as though the introduction of bots served to reinvent the entire project; it 
only altered its potential and its course. So while the revolution was certainly a 
meaningful change, it should not be viewed as the abandonment of everything that 
had made Wikipedia successful and interesting in the first place.
All told, Wikipedia has reached a state of relative stability, and it remains one of 
the most-visited websites in the world. While it is important to avoid stagnation, it 
is also necessary to consider what benefits a revolutionary change could provide. 
Moreover, adhocratic regimes are notoriously hard to change, as they tend to func-
tion by customs and practical know-how. With that in mind, for many years, there 
has not been compelling evidence to suggest that major alterations to Wikipedia 
would provide any real benefits, and until there is such a rationale, there is no reason 
for Wikipedia’s leaders to attempt to affect the existing system in such a dramatic 
fashion. In short, change is good, but only if it is purposeful change.
11.6  Interchangeable, Irreplaceable Leaders
Perhaps the most curious finding to date is the stickiness of Wikipedia elites. Those 
who contribute the most content to Wikipedia in a given week are very likely to 
continue to find themselves in the upper echelons in the following week, and the 
week after that, and so forth, to a far greater degree than what we would expect by 
random chance alone. As previously mentioned, when we consider contributions 
made during successive 5-week periods, elite stickiness from one interval to the 
next was 40%.
This is especially curious when one considers that the roster of elite members 
today is nonetheless very different than its constitution was several years ago. In 
other words, top-level contributors remain in that role for a time, but gradually 
recede into the shadows, allowing others to take the helm in their absence. 
Nonetheless, as we have seen, there is a consistently stark contrast between the mas-
sive amount of content contributed by those elites and the comparatively middling 
contributions of all other editors. This holds true regardless of whether we compare 
the elites against the masses throughout Wikipedia’s lifetime, as we did in Chap. 5, 
or whether we isolate a specific period of time (such as all contributions made only 
in a particular week).
All of this ultimately suggests that, for Wikipedia and other collaborative systems 
of a similar nature, it is essential to have a subset of contributors who perform the 
bulk of the work, carrying the effort forward largely on their own shoulders. Such 
members are those who have sufficient experience to understand the way in which 
Wikipedia operates and the “best practices,” in a sense, of contributing. As such, 
these individuals are able to lead by example, passing down their knowledge to up-
and-coming editors, and eventually passing the metaphorical baton of leadership—
but not before leading long enough to first confer their own wisdom, both in terms 
of the organizational behaviors that they model and the raw factual knowledge that 
they add to Wikipedia.
11  Conclusions

175
In short, Wikipedia needs to have leaders in order to survive, and those leaders 
have to do the lion’s share of the work—as previously noted, by our calculations, 
the top 1% of contributors provided 77% of Wikipedia’s content. Those leadership 
positions are indeed sticky, but they are not permanent. As such, those leaders can 
and do gradually rotate, with new leaders eventually stepping in to fill the role. In 
other words, the role of “elite” is a crucial one for Wikipedia, which illustrates the 
need for differentiation between editors at large and those who adopt positions at 
the top of the system, even if the particular individuals who fill those roles vary 
over time.
Furthermore, if the constitution of this elite group changed too rapidly, dramati-
cally shifting from one day to the next, then the system would likely be thrown into 
chaos, with little in the way of guiding principles to consistently direct behavior. 
But because elites tend to remain in the top levels of Wikipedia for at least a few 
weeks, their resilience in that position lends a degree of stability to the system that 
they help to drive. Even as leaders gradually cycle in and out of the role, the transi-
tion periods are gradual enough to foster an air of consistency among Wikipedia 
contributors. As such, while their spot among the elites is only quasi-permanent, 
those who lead for a short time are nonetheless irreplaceable—at least until their 
stickiness reaches its end.
11.7  Structures and Structuration Through an Entropy 
Lens: What Is the Optimal Range?
Although this volume presents two different approaches to detect structural differ-
entiation and changes in its composition, the first one, which relies more heavily on 
entropy, is simpler and may gain more currency as a result.
With that said, measuring structuration through entropy values presents both 
advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is parsimony. A single statistical 
indicator provides a very specific measurement through which an organization’s 
state may be pinpointed. The main disadvantage, then, is the linear progression 
embedded in the measurement. While it is valid to assume that maximum entropy 
values represent a state of disorganization, is it appropriate to claim that the mini-
mum level of entropy is the most perfect form of an organization? Recall that 
entropy exhibits a level of zero only when a single element accounts for all of the 
activity within the system. Considering the collaborative work on Wikipedia, if one 
member singlehandedly accounted for all the contributions, would that make 
Wikipedia the most efficiently organized system in the world, online or offline? 
Insofar as social systems are collaborative, of course not. To be blunt, the example 
is nonsensical at its core, since no collaborative system of any significant size can 
offload all of the work onto one individual.
Let us therefore move a bit closer to reality. If a very small group of ­individuals—
let us say, 10 or 50 members—accounted for all the work performed in a collabora-
tive project of 1,000,000 members, would that reflect a more “organized” and

socially differentiated collaborative space than one in which 100 or 1,000 members 
contributed the same amount of work? Intuitively, one might be tempted to say that 
a Wikipedia edited by ten individuals would still be closer to an ideal state of dif-
ferentiation than one edited by 100. However, it is, of course, somewhat more real-
istic than a Wikipedia edited by one individual.
As we move down the ladder of unevenness, we realize that although grotesquely 
small values are not to be taken seriously, we still have a hard time naming the 
magic threshold at which a relatively low (yet still reasonable) entropy value indi-
cates that we have entered the realm of appropriate “social order.” Does such a fig-
ure exist? Perhaps not, or at least there is no such number that we can uncover 
through deduction alone. However, it is certainly possible to use inductive research 
on a range of values to ascertain the entropy levels that designate various levels of 
social organization. If an organization exceeded the maximum value of this entropy 
range, its social order would unravel, while if entropy dropped under the minimum, 
social order would ossify into a system dominated by very few, which nullifies the 
entire idea of social order based on collaboration. In other words, empirical research 
might reveal that entropy, as a measure, captures social order in a curvilinear man-
ner. At the lower and higher ends, social order is a vanishing reality. Social “noise” 
might drown it at one end of the spectrum, while rigid control by very few would 
smother it at the other end.
In view of this, entropy-based research on social order needs to go through an 
extensive process of validation and calibration. In a way, using entropy as a social 
diagnosis instrument is similar to using a thermometer in medicine. While we know 
from our own experience that the temperature of the human body cannot be too low 
or too high, the thresholds for what is “low” and what is “high” could not have been 
and were not determined by deductive insight alone. Rather, a significant amount of 
empirical research of a large number of humans, in a variety of conditions, leads to 
the conclusion that the healthy human body temperature cannot vary more than 
fractions around 37 °C (98.6 °F) degrees (Bleich et al. 1978).
The calibration of the normal temperature range of the human body was a major 
medical accomplishment, providing a significant tool for detecting and tracking 
febrile states and, through them, the evolution of certain illnesses. With that said, the 
observed values do vary, even if ever so slightly. For example, the human body is a 
bit colder in the morning, a change that is not associated with illness but with the 
natural fluctuations inherent in an otherwise healthy stable state. Furthermore, mea-
suring and charting body temperature did not immediately provide a direct answer 
about the root cause of a given illness. It took many decades until fever was associ-
ated with various conditions, such as epidemics triggered by infectious agents, and 
it took even longer for researchers to provide a specific physiological explanation 
for the infection-related mechanisms that generate the directly observable symptom 
of fever.
At present, entropy-based research on social order is at a crossroads similar to 
that when physicians first began to realize that normal body temperatures vary 
among specific values and that significant departures suggest a pathologic problem. 
The next step, then, is to determine the reasonable and expected ranges for

­collaborative entropy in a variety of human organizations. Importantly, the ­variability 
of these ranges might be far greater than those associated with the medical analogy 
presented above. After all, organizations involving innumerable human actors may 
be more challenging to predict than a single person, and organizations in distinct 
contexts or with varying internal features may be quite different from one another, 
as opposed to the relatively standard biology of human beings. It is even possible 
that these ranges might not even overlap across contexts. Furthermore, since entropy 
is dependent on determining the elements of the system and the manner in which 
they manifest themselves in relation to a given variable of interest, it might not even 
be possible to compare entropy values and ranges in some situations. Beyond this, 
even when “healthy” ranges are eventually determined for each context, much more 
research will be necessary for us to outline the system-specific “physiological” 
mechanisms that are responsible for entropy variations.
Therefore, entropy measurement can and should be improved at the observa-
tional level as well. As our research currently stands, we only take into account the 
amount of work completed to determine participant roles, and those are defined 
dichotomously as leader vs. regular contributor. However, more recent work has 
provided ways through which we may detect more nuanced patterns of interaction 
and role allocation that make qualitative distinctions between substantive and for-
mal edits and between broad and deep contributions (Arazy et al. 2015). We can 
easily imagine a modified entropy indicator that takes into account both the nature 
of the role and the breadth or depth of the work to provide a richer, multidimen-
sional measurement of social order, one that implicitly controls for the specifics of 
the work performed. Of course, this would cause us to lose some of the parsimoni-
ousness of the unidimensional metric, but it may nonetheless be a worthwhile sac-
rifice for the sake of improving our understanding and classification of contributor 
roles.
Likewise, our entropy-based methodology may open other new avenues for 
research as well, as it provides a common theoretical and methodological ground 
through which we may unify and explain a wide variety of problems and processes 
related to social order. One particularly important and promising area of investiga-
tion would be the effect of optimal ranges of entropy on system states and system 
outcomes. The question of whether optimal entropy ranges translate into optimal 
system functioning is particularly tantalizing. Are systems that hold an optimal or 
“normal” entropy level more efficient? Or, in more intuitive terms, at what level of 
unevenness and functional distribution of roles do systems allocate tasks and allow 
individuals to function most efficiently? Within what entropy ranges will the quality 
of the collaborative product be maximized?
If, let us say, Wikipedia reaches a certain entropy optimum that, as determined by 
repeated observations, is found to be most efficient, will the content reach its high-
est level of quality as a result? Will the articles become especially complete, timely, 
accurate, or well written? Will that optimized entropy level instead drive the quan-
tity of contributions rather than its quality? Or will it ultimately yield some balance 
between the competing desires of quality and quantity? Again, this type of deep 
research has yet to be conducted. Some of these issues are already undergoing early

investigations (e.g., Sydow et al. 2016), and we sincerely hope that further research 
in this vein will provide some valuable insights in this direction. Our own upcoming 
research, which includes Wikipedia projects in non-English languages (French, 
Spanish, Romanian, Arabic, etc.), will more directly examine these issues and will 
both broaden and expand upon the foundational work that was presented in this 
volume.

Preprocessing, and Analysis
Data Acquisition
In order to examine the research questions highlighted in this volume, we examined 
every revision made to every encyclopedic article on Wikipedia between January 
16, 2001 and July 5, 2010. Luca de Alfaro and his colleagues at the University of 
California, Santa Cruz contributed the complete data set of revisions to the Wikipedia 
corpus made during this period. As part of their WikiTrust project conducted in 
conjunction with the Wikimedia Foundation, de Alfaro, Adler, and Pye (2010) 
parsed all revisions to all Wikipedia articles and collected a wide range of data about 
each of those revisions. The parsing was done only once, due to computing space 
limitations, in 2010.
During the 9.5-year interval for our study, a total of 22,792,885 users contributed 
235,701,162 million revisions to 7,296,360 different articles. Of these users, 
3,112,211 were logged into a registered account when making their revisions and 
could therefore be tracked as individuals, while the remaining 19,680,674 users 
made changes anonymously. Anonymous users were only identified by the IP 
address of the computer that was used to perform the edit. Thus, anonymous users 
cannot be identified as unique individuals—if a Wikipedia editor’s computer hap-
pened to be assigned an IP address previously used by a fellow editor, their contribu-
tions could overlap and be incorrectly identified as coming from the same individual 
using the same IP address. Likewise, a single anonymous user could be assigned any 
number of IP addresses over time, and furthermore, a given individual with a regis-
tered account could have made some revisions while logged in and contributed oth-
ers anonymously, thus creating the illusion of an additional anonymous user.
With that in mind, although anonymous “users” were six times more numerous 
than logged-in users, they only accounted for about one-third of the total amount 
of contributions, as measured by de Alfaro et al.’s delta formula (see below). This 
makes sense, as it would be difficult for others to form long-term relationships 
with a fellow editor who remains anonymous and therefore does not have an easily

identifiable (or even a unique or stable) username. In contrast, when an individual 
registers an account on Wikipedia and logs into that account before editing a 
Wikipedia article, that individual is choosing to be part of the Wikipedia editing 
community and to be recognized based on the contributions that he or she has 
made, all of which can be connected back to the username.
Thus, for the purposes of this project, we focused on the evolution of contribu-
tion diversity and entropy only among the 3,112,211 logged-in users, who jointly 
offered about two-thirds of the total effort in the production of Wikipedia content 
between January 16, 2001 and July 5, 2010. This allowed us to minimize the chance 
of misrepresenting one editor as multiple users or vice versa and to properly assess 
the activities of the most dedicated contributors to the project: those who bothered 
to sign up.
Beyond this, the data was bounded in time due to the nature of the analysis, 
which specifically looked at effort. Our collection of Wikipedia revisions needed to 
be expressed in a manner that demonstrated the system of collaborative relation-
ships as it changed over time. Therefore, the raw data was preprocessed by de Alfaro 
and his colleagues and expressed as a new unit of measurement signifying effort.
More specifically, the de Alfaro parser was used to analyze each editorial inter-
vention and calculate the amount of effective change resulting from a given revision 
and, by proxy, of effort invested in the change. Due to the specific method of calcu-
lation, the value is also called “delta,” which makes allusion to the fact that effort is 
a human facet of the concept of “edit distance.”
de Alfaro’s formula (Eq. A.1) takes into account all three kinds of changes that 
could be recorded for a given intervention: additions, deletions, and changes to 
existing text. In so doing, the formula limits the impact of deletions and mere copy-­
paste changes, thereby offering a superior measurement strategy over many previ-
ous attempts in similar studies that typically used mere character counts to assess 
the significance of a given contribution.

The d score was used throughout this study as the main measure of user contribu-
tion (effort). Delta (effort) scores were used in all calculations of core measures and 
relationships, including entropy, the presence of a given individual in the contribut-
ing elite, and coeditorial connections between participants in the collaborative 
effort. Inequality was measured using a standard application of the entropy formula, 
as detailed in Chap. 5.
We chose entropy over other measures of inequality, such as the Gini coefficient, 
due to its broader conceptual implications. Lower levels of entropy can, in fact, be 
interpreted as a higher level of system structuration. In other words, as entropy goes 
down, we expect that the group will become more structured.

Network Conception
In Part II of this volume, organizational configurations were assessed using five dif-
ferent dimensions, four of which were network dimensions. In order to serve this 
objective, we undertook a second preprocessing phase during which the effort data 
was organized into a series of networks to describe the evolution of collaborative 
connections and self-organizing practices among Wikipedia editors over time.
In order to assess these changes, Wikipedia’s life span was first divided into 
seven-day windows, beginning from the first week after its formal launch on January 
15, 2001. These windows were narrow enough to yield many data points over the 
longitudinal data set but wide enough so that the network constructed for each week 
would show a rich, meaningful network of interpersonal connections that developed 
over those 7 days, given the number of revisions made during that period.
The first network, therefore, described all collaborative connections formed dur-
ing Wikipedia’s first week of activity, the second network reflected those connec-
tions made during second week, and so forth. The sequence of these networks, then, 
described changes in the community’s collaborative processes over time. These net-
works were conceptualized in terms of user-to-user (editor-to-editor) collaborative 
connections, or the collaborative ties formed when one user changed content that 
another user had contributed. In other words, when two different individuals 
engaged with the same material, a coeditorial connection between the two users was 
generated (Matei et al. 2015).
However, precise data on the exact text that each user contributed and changed 
could not feasibly be analyzed across the entire Wikipedia corpus for its develop-
ment over 9.5 years. In other words, while it was feasible to analyze data regarding 
which users revised which articles at what points in time, more detailed assessments 
of user changes to the exact sections and words within an article were not computa-
tionally feasible.
Consequently, even if two individuals revised the same article, it was possible 
that they altered entirely distinct portions of the text and never actually interacted 
with one another’s work. Likewise, it was also possible that one editor could revise 
a given article and then have that change reverted or otherwise heavily modified by 
subsequent editors. In that instance, someone viewing and editing the article at a 
later date might never even see the contribution of the first editor, as the text that 
person contributed might have already been erased or modified beyond 
recognition.
Given that coediting activity could not be directly assessed, a modified version of 
Isard’s (1954) gravity model of trade was used as a proxy measurement to instead 
evaluate the likelihood that any two editors interacted (Matei et al. 2015). Isard’s 
original model was designed to assess the likelihood of two countries, provinces, or 
other distinct entities sharing a trade relationship based on each entity’s trade activ-
ity and the geographic distance between them. For any two communities, their 
shared score under Isard’s formulation increased as each group’s trade activity 
increased, but declined as they grew further apart. The higher the result based on 
Appendix A: Data Collection, Management, Preprocessing, and Analysis

182
Isard’s formula, the more likely that the two groups shared a trade relationship, and 
the more likely that relationship was to be especially active as well.
Based on this formulation, as well as prior work on Wikipedia (Britt 2011, 2013; 
Matei et al. 2015), the present study used the gravity model of online interaction (see 
Eq. A.2 below) to assess the likelihood and extent of coediting interactions between 
any two Wikipedia editors. In this case, the number of editing iterations between two 
contributors’ revisions represented the “distance” between two revisions to the same 
article. The more revisions made between the contributions of those two editors, the 
more likely it was that the first editor’s work had been significantly altered or com-
pletely removed before the second editor ever approached the article.

The significance of changes made to a given article also played a major role in 
the likelihood that two editors interacted with the same text (Britt 2011; Matei et al. 
2015). A user who added several pages of text was much more likely to have 
engaged with the work of many previous collaborators—and to have many subse-
quent editors engage with his or her own work—than another user who added only 
a few words or a single sentence. As mentioned above, the significance of any given 
revision was quantified by de Alfaro et al.’s (2010) “delta” measure, which was 
based upon the number of words added, removed, changed, and moved across a 
given article.
In tandem, the significance of any two revisions and the number of iterations 
between them gives us likelihood that the two editors themselves interacted with the 
same text in the article. Thus, the weight of a network edge formed between two edi-
tors who revised the same article represented the probability of their interaction, so 
the combination of all of these edges yielded a probabilistic network of collaboration, 
a concept that was proposed through the Visible Effort project (Matei et al. 2015).
These relationships formed the basis of the weekly networks designed to demon-
strate changes in the collaborative system on Wikipedia over time. For each revision 
j made to any article on Wikipedia, a directional edge was formed from the author of 
that revision to the authors of all previous revisions of the same article. This edge was 
placed within the weekly network whose seven-day time range contained the point at 
which the revision j was made, as determined by its timestamp. The weight, or degree, 
of the edge pointing from the author of revision j to the author of any prior revision i 
within the same article was calculated using the gravity model of online interaction.
In the event that the weekly network in question already contained an edge 
pointing from the author of revision j to the author of revision i, then the weight of 
Appendix A: Data Collection, Management, Preprocessing, and Analysis

183
the new edge to be created was simply added to the weight of the existing edge. This 
produced a single edge describing the engagement that the author of revision j 
devoted within the week in question to the work of the editor who created revision 
i. As such, a coediting relationship between two users could be strengthened through 
repeated revisions to the same article or through mutual collaboration on multiple 
Wikipedia articles.
It is worth making special note that any network edge formed between any two 
editors did not carry over to subsequent networks describing later weeks of interac-
tion on Wikipedia. This stands in contrast with the networks devised in Britt’s 
(2011) previous study on Wikipedia’s growth over time. In that earlier study, net-
works aggregated across time, so any given week’s network consisted of all the 
collaborative connections formed in that week in addition to those formed in all 
prior weeks. As such, each weekly network was larger than the one that preceded it, 
highlighting the growth of collaborative connections over time.
In the present study, all edges formed in prior weeks were instead ignored in 
constructing the network for any subsequent week. Because edges were not aggre-
gated across weekly networks, organizational structures that may have been promi-
nent months or years earlier did not necessarily persist—such persistence of 
long-forgotten structures would have needlessly obscured later structural changes. 
In other words, keeping the weekly networks distinct permitted more direct obser-
vation of sharp changes in the way that the community behaved from one week to 
the next.
In total, 491 networks were generated to represent the collaborative networks 
(see Table A.1). The first 3 weeks as well as the final week in the data set were not 
included in the network analyses due to issues with data size and completeness 
(Matei et al. 2015; see also Table A.2).
The entropy of contributions, which was the fifth dimension used to assess orga-
nizational configurations, was also assessed at a weekly level for a total of 
495 weeks—all of which were used for the analyses in Part I of this volume (see 
Table A.3) and 491 of which were included in the analyses in Part II (Table A.2). 
This entropy value was normalized such that the range of possible values spanned 
the interval between 0 and 1 in order to ensure comparability over time. The entropy 
of each week took into account all the contributions made by all Wikipedia editors 
up to that point. Thus, this represented a cumulative entropy measure, so the final 
entropy value represented the state of entropy (and diversity) for the entire Wikipedia 
project over the entirety of the study interval.
Data Management
Because of the massive size of the data set in this study—the raw data comprised a 
text file of over 67 GB—sophisticated hardware and software resources had to be 
utilized to handle the data. The raw data was stored on and accessed from the Coates 
cluster within Purdue University’s Community Cluster Program, a supercomputing

infrastructure managed by the Rosen Center for Advanced Computing (Purdue 
University 2008). This system was powerful enough to handle most of the compu-
tational load of this project.
Similarly, most standard software packages for network analysis would have 
been unable to handle such a large quantity of data or would have taken many years 
of processing to complete the analysis. Consequently, the second author of this vol-
ume and two other programmers, David Braun and Dennis Lazar of the Rosen 
Center for Advanced Computing, designed and wrote several custom Java pro-
grams. These programs moved the data from the raw text file into a SQL database 
to be queried; constructed network graphs from that database as described above; 
calculated the inbound degree centralization, outbound degree centralization, 
betweenness centralization, and assortativity from each of those network graphs; 
and calculated the social entropy from the SQL database for the same weeklong 
time ranges.
This collaborative programming effort was undertaken as part of the Visible 
Effort/KredibleNet research initiative, serving the needs of multiple research stud-
ies (Matei et al. 2015), including the present analysis. As a whole, after the first 
3 weeks and the final week of revisions were removed from the data set (see above), 
the computational process conducted by Britt, Braun, and Lazar distilled the 67 GB 
text file into a core data set of five variables, each of which was evaluated 491 times, 
corresponding with the 491 weeks of Wikipedia’s growth from February 6, 2001, to 
July 5, 2010.

Organizational Structure Measures
Part of our research deals with the gradual trends and sudden phase shifts that the 
Wikipedia community underwent. In order to properly address this question, the 
five well-established measures of organizational structure and behavior described 
above were assessed in 1-week windows for a total of 491 measurements.
First, structural changes in collaborative attractiveness, as they occurred in the 
Wikipedia community, were assessed using inbound degree centralization. Freeman 
(1979) developed this metric to indicate the extent to which some actors in a given 
network are more attractive than others. Broadly speaking, the more edges that 
point toward a given actor, and the stronger those edges are, the more effort others 
are exerting to form a relationship with that individual. The more that a few key 
individuals stand out as being substantially more “central” than others, the more 
centralized the organization is around those individuals.
In the Wikipedia context, it is quite possible that the revisions made by a few 
central editors are, for whatever reason, especially attractive to others, in that their 
revisions to particular articles prompt other editors to further revise and develop the 
content in question. It would be as though the other community members were 
clamoring around the few “popular” editors in question, following them and further 
editing their content across the knowledge production system. The small locus of 
attractive editors would thus hold a great deal of influence in dictating where the 
community at large focused its efforts.
Simply put, inbound degree centralization is designed to measure the extent of 
stratification between the “popular” group and the rest of the masses. Higher values 
of inbound degree centralization indicate that a small set of editors are far more 
attractive than the rest, with fellow editors much more inclined to engage with the

content added by the attractive few than that contributed by others. In such a com-
munity, the power is localized around those individuals toward whom the commu-
nity at large is drawn.
Likewise, changes in the structure of collaborative extroversion were represented 
by outbound degree centralization. Using a similar approach as that of inbound 
degree centralization, outbound degree centralization examines how active an indi-
vidual is in forming and strengthening connections with others in the network by 
summing the weight of all edges leading away from the actor in question toward 
collaborative peers. Those individuals who form strong relationships with many oth-
ers can influence the behavior of a wide proportion of the population accordingly.
The extent to which some individuals are more active than others in expanding 
their span of influence is measured using outbound degree centralization. As out-
bound degree centralization increases, the locus of power becomes more concentrated 
within a few individuals who are far more active than others in forging connections 
with their peers and spreading their influence throughout the organization.
Next, changes in communication flow through the community were operational-
ized as shifts in betweenness centralization. As noted by Freeman (1979), among 
others, an individual lying on the shortest path between any two others in a network 
holds a great deal of influence over the relationship between those two individuals, 
as ideas and knowledge that would move from one to the other are likely to pass 
through that central individual. In other words, the person along the shortest path 
between two other individuals acts as a gatekeeper between them. In the Wikipedia 
network, this manifests itself in control over the flow of information or knowledge, 
which is the most prized resource within knowledge construction communities.
Betweenness centralization assesses the localization of such power, specifically 
by examining the disparity between the most central community members and 
everyone else in the network. Higher betweenness centralization indicates that the 
locus of power is being leeched away from the network at large as a few key indi-
viduals take command over the flow of information throughout the entire organiza-
tion. It also indicates a higher potential velocity of communication and collaboration 
flows, with a small group of elites acting as hubs responsible for transmitting infor-
mation throughout the organization.
Trends in partner choice, on the other hand, were evaluated using assortativity. 
This measure highlights the choices that fellow community members make when 
forming connections with others who are similar or dissimilar to themselves (Newman 
2002). In other words, when the general trend is for organizational members to form 
coediting connections with others who share a similar level of prominence as them-
selves—whether they are similarly well connected or similarly poorly connected in 
the community—assortativity increases. As this trend declines, assortativity itself 
declines. Should the trend reverse itself, such that community members seek out 
coediting connections with others who hold dissimilar levels of prominence to their 
own more than they pursue those of a similar level, then the assortativity measure 
becomes negative, indicating a disassortative tendency throughout the organization.
On Wikipedia, past research (Britt 2011) indicated that the community behaved 
in a disassortative manner during the early weeks of its development, but that this 
Appendix A: Data Collection, Management, Preprocessing, and Analysis

213
trend progressively declined. However, as noted above, this previous study aggre-
gated the network of contributions over time, so the disassortativity finding suggest-
ing that community members sought out dissimilar partners was due, at least in part, 
to the positions they had established over the prior weeks, months, and years. It is 
quite possible that the network actually became assortative in later weeks, but that 
this change was obscured by the structure of the past. As previously noted, the 
research presented in this volume avoids such residual effects in order to make any 
such changes more visible.
Finally, social entropy served as a measurement of the extent of order within the 
community. In contrast with the various forms of centralization and assortativity, 
social entropy was measured using the distribution of contributions as opposed to 
the network of connections between editors (see Matei et al. 2015; Matei et al. 
2010a). The significance of each revision made by a given editor, as quantified by 
de Alfaro et al.’s (2010) delta measure, was used to assess how much that editor 
contributed to the community, with the delta values of all revisions the editor made 
in a given week summed to determine his or her overall contribution to the project 
in that week (Matei et al. 2015). The more equal that editor contributions across the 
community were during a given week, the higher that the community’s social 
entropy climbed toward a maximum value of 1, signifying perfect evenness. 
Likewise, unequal levels of contributions would cause the social entropy calculation 
to drop, with the minimum of zero indicating that only one community member 
made any contributions whatsoever during the week in question (Matei et al. 2015).
Existing Breakpoint Identification Approaches
The present study uses a new approach to identify the locations of breakpoints. As 
such, before delving into the details of the present analysis, it is worth explaining 
why other, established techniques would have been inappropriate for this study.
First, it would be reasonable to expect the time series data in the present study to 
exhibit some autocorrelative properties, which might suggest the use of an ARIMA 
model, a spectral analysis, or a similar statistical approach. However, the key com-
ponents of an ARIMA model have the potential to mask phase shifts, effectively 
negating the very trends we hope to observe. For instance, the entire point of differ-
encing data is to remove linear and higher-order terms, which can make it extremely 
difficult to detect the locations of otherwise clear changes in the trend over time.
Consider, for instance, the fictional data set in Fig. A.1, which was generated from 
two distinct linear trends (given by the red and blue lines) along with normally dis-
tributed random noise. In Fig. A.1, the trend appears to be fairly constant for the first 
100 data points. Around that 100th data point, however, its value plummets, and then 
the fictional measure appears to increase in a roughly linear fashion for the remain-
der of the data set. This radical change is easy to observe, even with the naked eye.
Figure A.2, however, shows the result of differencing the example data. From 
this plot, there does not appear to be any change at all, despite how obvious the

215
transition was in Fig. A.1. Now that the data has been differenced, it would be virtu-
ally impossible to detect the 100th data point as a key change moment, regardless of 
the statistical approach employed.
It is clear that while differencing would be necessary to fit autoregressive or 
moving average terms to the present data, doing so can also mask moments of flux 
and substantially inhibit any subsequent effort to detect changes. Furthermore, 
ARMA terms alone can obscure otherwise distinct breakpoints. Moving averages, 
after all, are frequently used for smoothing jagged plots, which in this case may be 
the most crucial part of the data. Even when a breakpoint is still evident after apply-
ing a moving average term, its location may be left in doubt, as the analysis of any 
given data point will necessarily include other data points as well, blending them 
together and making it difficult to determine at which data point a change occurred. 
Autoregressive terms can have similar effects. At best, ARIMA terms could mask 
the exact location of a given breakpoint, and at worst, they could hide the breakpoint 
entirely.
A few other techniques exist to handle problems related to change points in data, 
but each of these suffers from a critical limitation. Segmented regression analysis, 
which is generally used to detect repeated-samples treatment effects in quasi-­
experiments, presupposes that the location of the change is known and only tests the 
significance of the change at that location, whether in terms of the intercept, the 
slope, or a higher-order term. In other words, segmented regression merely assesses 
the differences between two or more known segments. In the present study, no 
experimental change was deliberately applied by any researcher—rather, any 
changes were observed as they naturally occurred without intervention—so any 
change points that may have occurred were not known in advance. Therefore, since 
we could not assume any particular moments of change, our goal was instead to 
identify the significant breakpoints within the data set whose locations and number 
were unknown.
Several iterative methods have been developed to find the most appropriate 
breakpoint locations given the number of breakpoints for which to search. The SAS 
statistical package, for instance, uses steepest-descent and gradient descent 
approaches as well as the Newton, Gauss-Newton, and Marquardt methods of esti-
mating breakpoints. However, these iterative methods can only be used on 
­continuous segments. In other words, all of these approaches assume that data seg-
ments are linked together and only aim to detect a “bend” in a continuous line, such 
as that shown in Fig. A.3. As such, they are unable to identify “jumps” in the data 
caused by an instantaneous change in the intercept when the higher-order terms 
remain constant between the two segments (Fig. A.4), a scenario that was consid-
ered to be likely in the present study (see Britt 2013).
As a final alternative, a team of statisticians led by Achim Zeileis (Zeileis et al. 
2003, 2010) devised the “strucchange” algorithm to determine the number and loca-
tions of N unknown breakpoints by minimizing the Bayesian information criterion 
(BIC). However, initial testing indicated that this approach tended to dramatically 
overfit data when its variance was high in comparison with evolutionary movement 
due to linear and higher-order terms. This issue was so severe that in almost every

217
trial there were as many regression terms as data points assigned to some segments. 
The problem was further exacerbated when the variance was heteroscedastic, as 
Zeileis’s algorithm flooded the more volatile areas of the data set with numerous 
breakpoints, perfectly fitting random noise and generating comparatively mediocre 
fits for the more significant, meaningful shifts that occurred during periods of lesser 
variance. Britt (2011) previously found that assortativity on Wikipedia followed an 
especially heteroscedastic trend, and other factors addressed in this volume were 
later revealed to have similar variance structures, so Zeileis’s approach would not 
have been appropriate for this study.
Stepwise Segmented Regression Analysis
Algorithm Description
With the inadequacy of the above approaches in mind, this analysis used an alterna-
tive, more general approach based on the principles of stepwise regression model 
selection. This approach was inspired by Crawley’s (2007, 425–430) method of con-
ducting a piecewise regression using indicator functions (see also Lemoine 2012). 
However, his approach only incorporated intercepts and linear terms, neglecting the 
potential for curvilinear trends, and it focused only on detecting significant trends for 
each segment rather than assessing the significance of the breakpoints that divided 
them. The present study synthesizes and builds upon Crawley’s initial ideas in order 
to detect revolutionary changes, not just the significant evolutionary trends between 
them, and to handle multiple breakpoints and higher-order regression terms.
Using the R statistical software package, a separate regression model was fitted 
to each of the five dependent variables measured in this study: inbound degree cen-
tralization, outbound degree centralization, betweenness centralization, assortativ-
ity, and entropy. For each of these models, an intercept term, the slope, and a 
quadratic term were included in the model, and these base terms, much like the first 
level in a hierarchical regression, were never removed. Afterward, interaction terms 
incorporating indicator functions were added and removed from the model based on 
the α = .15 standard, a common threshold for stepwise model building. At each 
stage of the process, terms were added to the model if they were statistically signifi-
cant at the α = .15 level, then insignificant terms were removed if they no longer met 
the α = .15 threshold after the addition of other terms.
Each indicator function corresponded to all data points prior to a specified week 
in the data set. If a given observation of the measure in question occurred after that 
specified week, the indicator function took on a value of 1. Otherwise, the indicator 
function was 0. For instance, if an interaction term corresponding to week 100 was 
added to the model for inbound degree centralization, then the Intercept∗I(Week ≥ 
100) term would equal 1 for all observations of inbound degree centralization from 
week 100 onward. For weeks 4–99, the I(Week ≥ 100) indicator function was 0, so 
the Intercept∗I(Week ≥ 100) term estimated the intercept from week 100 onward, in addi-
tion to the global Intercept term applied to the entire data set. As such, the interaction 
Appendix A: Data Collection, Management, Preprocessing, and Analysis

218
term effectively served to estimate the change in the intercept at each breakpoint. 
The same approach applied for the linear and quadratic terms in each regression 
model. Each indicator function was treated as its own variable, multiplied by the 
week number, and multiplied by the squared week number, such that the changes in 
the intercept, slope, and quadratic terms at each breakpoint were each estimated by 
these various interaction terms.
A given week was deemed a significant breakpoint whenever its indicator func-
tion, its indicator function times the week number, or its indicator function times the 
week number squared were all added to the model and at least one of the three terms 
was statistically significant. In other words, if adding a breakpoint to a data segment 
would split it into two segments with significantly different intercepts, slopes, or 
quadratic terms at the α = .15 level, all three were added to the regression model 
accordingly. Likewise, only when all three terms were insignificant was the break-
point removed from the model.
Terms were grouped in this way in order to prevent needlessly overfitting the 
number of breakpoints due to spurious statistics. Otherwise, one could envision, for 
instance, a slope change being added to the model in the 100th week, and a quadratic 
change later being added at week 101—not because both weeks served as indepen-
dent breakpoints modeling distinct changes on Wikipedia but merely because fitting 
the second change to week 101 would happen to explain more variance than adding 
a second indicator function for week 100 to the model. This, notably, would result in 
the higher-order terms between the two breakpoints being inestimable.
It is also worth noting that two breakpoints corresponding to back-to-back weeks 
could nonetheless be added to the model on the sole basis of their respective intercepts 
being significantly different in their own right. This would also result in the higher-
order terms corresponding to short line segments being inestimable, but this would 
nonetheless cause no problems with the core task of identifying the locations of statis-
tically significant breakpoints, so it was otherwise not a problem for model fitting.
Step-by-Step Walkthrough

with an intercept, slope, and quadratic term already in the model:

219
could have a higher week number than the last week in the data set). Then it selects the 
value of X that would yield the regression model with the smallest error sum of 
squares, and if Intercept∗I(Week ≥ X), Week∗I(Week ≥ X), or Week2∗I(Week ≥ X) is 
statistically significant at the α = .15 level, all three terms are added to the model. For 
the sake of the example, suppose that the value of X that would yield the smallest error 
sum of squares is X = 300. Then the process would consider the model

and if Intercept∗I(Week ≥ 300), Week∗I(Week ≥ 300), or Week2∗I(Week ≥ 300) was 
statistically significant at the α = .15 level, this model would be accepted, and the 
process would move to the next step. For instance, if Week∗I(Week ≥ 300) was statis-
tically significant, that would mean that the slope of the segment ending in week 299 
was significantly different than the slope of the segment from week 300 onward.
After the three terms corresponding to a breakpoint at a given week were added 
to the model, any insignificant breakpoints were removed from the model. For 
instance, consider the above model a few steps later in the model-building process:

After the latest set of intercept, slope, and quadratic terms are added to the model, 
all terms are again checked for significance. If all three terms corresponding to a 
given week have become statistically insignificant, those three terms are removed 
from the model. Suppose that in this case Intercept∗I(Week ≥ 200), Week∗I(Week ≥ 
200), and Week2∗I(Week ≥ 200) are all statistically insignificant terms at the α = .15 
level, and Intercept∗I(Week ≥ 300), Week∗I(Week ≥ 300), and Week2∗I(Week ≥ 300) 
are also statistically insignificant. In that case, the model becomes

and the process will next determine whether the terms for another breakpoint can 
be added to the model.
In this project, the process rotated back and forth between these two steps, add-
ing the terms for a significant breakpoint, removing the terms for any insignificant 
breakpoints, and then adding the terms for another significant breakpoint, until no 
further terms could be added or removed from the model.
Appendix A: Data Collection, Management, Preprocessing, and Analysis

220
It should also be noted that the independent variables were certainly not indepen-
dent from one another, as adding or removing any indicator function inevitably 
changed the number of data points estimated by the term which followed, which had 
the potential to profoundly affect the existing estimation. This multicollinearity was 
inescapable but in this case was not cause for alarm. After all, the goal was to find 
breakpoints indicating significant differences between adjacent data segments. If 
the potential effect of an indicator term was masked due to multicollinearity, that 
only meant that the term in question did not highlight a substantial change from the 
trends already in the model and therefore did not deserve to be added as a break-
point in its own right. In much the same way, typical regression diagnostics for 
phenomena like outliers and non-normality would have been meaningless, as the 
entire point of this analysis was to detect significant deviations from the existing 
model.
Once the final model was determined, the respective significance of each term 
was assessed at the standard α = .05 level. Because of the large number of factors 
under consideration, a Holm-Bonferroni correction was applied to the model selec-
tion and significance testing thresholds in order to control the experimentwise Type 
I error rate. With that in mind, in addition to the three terms included from the 
beginning, a total of 487 breakpoints had the potential to be added to each regres-
sion model. Each of these breakpoints, in turn, was comprised of three terms that 
could be significant, the intercept, the slope, and the quadratic term, and if any one 
of those terms was significant, all three were added to the regression model. As 
such, the Holm-Bonferroni correction was applied based on the presence of 1,464 
regression terms being tested.
Results
The breakpoint detection procedure in our study used stepwise segmented regres-
sion models for each of the five respective organizational measures. These models 
are given in Tables A.4, A.5, A.6, A.7, and A.8, and they correspond to the time 
series plots in Figs. A.5, A.6, A.7, A.8, and A.9. Significant factors at the α = .05 
level, with the Holm-Bonferroni correction, are labeled with an asterisk. Figure 
A.10 features all five measures on a single plot, without the fitted values from their 
respective regression models.
For each regression model in Tables A.4, A.5, A.6, A.7, and A.8, each segment is 
defined by the sum of all applicable indicator functions. For instance, in the model 
of outbound degree centralization (Table A.5, Fig. A.6), the segment from weeks 4 
to 141 is defined by the equation

with E used to represent scientific notation as appropriate. In other words, each 
coefficient indicated the magnitude of the shift at each breakpoint. The estimated 
values of the intercept, slope, and quadratic term themselves may be determined by 
taking each sequential shift into account.
For convenience, breakpoints are named by the week number that begins the seg-
ment following the breakpoint. For instance, the outbound degree centralization 
model defined two breakpoints positioned between weeks 141 and 142 and between 
weeks 206 and 207, which have been labeled as the week 142 and week 207 break-
points, respectively. The betweenness centralization model yielded only one break-
point at week 54, while entropy gave eight breakpoints at weeks 7, 10, 42, 92, 93, 
204, 250, and 335.

Appendix B: Historical and Media Analysis 
of Wikipedia’s Evolutionary Context
Introduction
An investigation of Wikipedia’s evolution would not be complete without putting it 
in the context of real life events. While Wikipedians were adding, deleting, revert-
ing, and debating, the world was moving apace, marked by some extremely impor-
tant events. We recount them here for two reasons. First, in doing so, we provide 
some overall context for the historical era in which Wikipedia was born. Second, 
and more importantly, this effort connects some especially relevant developments to 
specific organizational changes, showing how societal and environmental forces 
may have served as evolutionary motors that influenced editors’ behavior on 
Wikipedia, even if only indirectly, and demonstrating that they can be seen as feed-
ing factors for editing increases and the expansion of Wikipedia’s content overall.
Our historical review is therefore rather detailed. The goal is to provide, as has 
previously been mentioned, an idiographic description of the events at hand. 
Therefore, the scale of the described events is intentionally taken at the smallest 
level of granularity, as we aim to detail all of the idiosyncratic phenomena that sur-
rounded Wikipedia’s evolution.
We also offer this as tool for future research, providing a first layer for a future 
“thick description” (Geertz 1973) of the environment of events and ideas in which 
Wikipedia was born. Thus, what follows is a sui generis primary and secondary 
document, which may prove useful especially in future research. If the details tend 
to be many, the justification is that reality tends to be overabundant.

Data Collection Strategy
We used the “Major Newspapers” archive within the LexisNexis Academic data-
base as a source for prominent historical events. This particular resource offered two 
major benefits: the high-profile newspapers themselves and LexisNexis’ own meta-
data about the articles in question.
First, in terms of the newspapers, the “Major Newspapers” grouping itself con-
sisted of 69 of the most well-respected English-language media sources in the 
world. As described by LexisNexis (2013b), in order to be included within this 
archive:
United States newspapers must be listed in the top 50 circulation in Editor & Publisher Year 
Book. Newspapers published outside the United States must be in English language and 
listed as a national newspaper in Benn’s World Media Directory or one of the top 5% in 
circulation for the country.
All told, the range of this archive ensured that only significant topics that could 
realistically have an effect across Wikipedia coeditors would receive substantial 
attention, yet it also captured those issues that emerged both in the USA and 
worldwide.
Just as importantly, each article featured several pieces of key metadata that 
allowed the archive to be quickly reduced to only the most relevant potential forces. 
Each article was labeled based on its publication date, location in the newspaper, 
and key organizations, people, and subjects (or, to put it more generally, the article’s 
key terms), as identified through LexisNexis’ SmartIndexing Technology 
(LexisNexis 2013a). In effect, these key terms serve as tags, the results of a content 
analysis that LexisNexis conducted on its own articles.
These were used to conduct two separate data collection processes for newspaper 
articles for each breakpoint. For the first search, all front-page articles from the 
“Major Newspapers” archive within the 4 weeks prior to a given breakpoint and the 
week following it were retrieved from LexisNexis (see Chap. 10 for details on the 
time range). These records were further reduced to only the most prominent recur-
ring terms using an R script that counted the number of times each subject appeared 
in all of the front-page articles for a given breakpoint period; created three scree 
plots of the number of appearances of each organization, person, and subject; and 
found the optimal cutoff to define highly significant terms for each of these plots. 
This cutoff point was determined by iterating through each term and, at each itera-
tion, creating a regression model of two linear segments joined at the location of 
that term on the plot’s x-axis, determining the error sum of squares for that regres-
sion model, and selecting the model that yielded the lowest error sum of squares.
For the selected model, the term corresponding to the location of the bend or 
“elbow” in the scree plot was deemed the ideal cutoff point for prominent terms of 
that category (organizations, people, and subjects), and all terms with at least as 
many front-page appearances as the identified cutoff term were treated as promi-
nent. This approach was based upon the use of scree plots to identify key factors in 
principal component analysis, with the idea that there is a distinction between the 
Appendix B: Historical and Media Analysis of Wikipedia’s Evolutionary Context

229
mass of news topics that receive brief, dispersed attention, and those that either 
receive sustained front-page coverage in a few markets or a burst of front-page cov-
erage around the world.
Figure B.1 shows one of these scree plots, with subjects ordered from most 
appearances to least appearances. All subjects left of the “elbow” point in the regres-
sion line were considered prominent enough to warrant further examination.
Just as the 5-week time range was intentionally devised to be wider than was 
likely necessary, it was expected that many of the “prominent” terms within that 
range would not be remotely connected with the behavior of Wikipedia editors. 
With that in mind, this approach did not serve as a final analysis to define a concrete 
set of relevant terms; rather, it was instead used to filter approximately 100,000 front 
page “Major Newspapers” articles into a short list of those events and issues that 
had a major societal impact and which may therefore have impacted Wikipedia 
contributors as well, to be used in the next analysis step.
As for the second data collection process, in addition to the front-page articles 
that were retrieved regardless of subject, another search was conducted to retrieve 
all articles within a given breakpoint period, front-page or otherwise, from the 
“Major Newspapers” database, as long as they contained the word “Wikipedia” 
somewhere within the text. This produced a much smaller number of records than 
the thousands of front-page articles initially retrieved for each period. For the sake

subject and the corresponding segmented regression line

230
of consistency, the subjects addressed in each article mentioning Wikipedia were 
ordered by number of appearances in the same way as the front-page articles, but 
the smaller set of results was not further refined through the use of a scree plot. The 
topics uncovered through this second mode of data collection are addressed at 
greater length in Chap. 10.
We examined the full text of each article that matched a prominent term or sub-
ject word. For each breakpoint, we identified the major news items that coalesced 
into key themes, whether they dealt with momentous events like a presidential inau-
guration or a school shooting, or a very long-term news item like economic woes or 
the war on terror. For the sake of space, not all terms that were identified as promi-
nent within the scree plot are discussed at length within this written document, but 
any terms that were found to be related to a given configurational change are indeed 
included in full.
First Breakpoint: Week 7
Wikipedia was born in 2001, a year of momentous change and dramatic shifts in 
American politics. The year started with a lingering controversy surrounding the 
presidential election and, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, ended with a major 
military conflict in Afghanistan. The major events surrounding week 7 of Wikipedia’s 
existence were of a largely political nature. It would be reasonable to speculate that 
these fueled some of the activity on the site, particularly since Wikipedia did pro-
vide some information about the election and the vote count.
It is worth mentioning that during the 10th week of Wikipedia’s life, a controver-
sial Supreme Court ruling halted a recount of Florida ballots from the 2000 US 
Presidential Election, so although some voters held lingering doubts about what the 
recount results would have been, George W. Bush took office as the 43rd President 
of the USA on January 20, 2001. Arguments over the election results continued well 
into Bush’s first term as president. Several newspapers jointly conducted a partial, 
unofficial recount of some of the questionable ballots (Cauchon and Drinkard 2001), 
and a New York Daily News headline from February 26, 2001, ultimately proclaimed 
“Miami-Dade Recount BUSH REALLY WON New tally nets Gore only 49 votes” 
(Dineen 2001). Nevertheless, a pall remained over much of Bush’s time in office, as 
some citizens argued that the Supreme Court effectively handed Bush the election 
and wrongly mitigated the public’s role in the democratic process, even as most 
media outlets shifted their attentions to Bush’s policies as the controversy 
subsided.
With that said, in the weeks that followed, a great deal of the media’s focus was 
diverted toward the case of FBI agent Robert Hanssen. On February 18, 2001, 
Hanssen was arrested for selling American secrets to the Soviet Union and Russia 
(Savino 2001; Willing and Watson 2001). Hanssen reportedly made more than $1.4 
million for his spying activities from 1979 to 2001, and he would ultimately plead 
guilty several months after his arrest (Risen 2001).
Appendix B: Historical and Media Analysis of Wikipedia’s Evolutionary Context

231
The embattled music-sharing service Napster stood alongside Hanssen in legal 
news. Several record labels along with the RIAA had already won a 2000 copyright 
infringement lawsuit against Napster, but its owners continued the fight in the US 
Court of Appeals. Napster was ultimately allowed to continue operating, but only if 
the system tracked user activity and if its owners restricted access to copyright-­
infringing material upon being notified of its presence. The company was only able 
to guarantee that it would be able to restrict 99.4% of copyright-infringing activity, 
which the court said was not good enough, so Napster was eventually closed in July 
2001 (Douglas 2004; Lessig 2004).
Europe was facing its own share of problems, as a plague of foot-and-mouth 
disease swept through the continent (Cryderman 2001; Kennedy 2001). The first 
cases of foot-and-mouth were discovered in British cattle in mid-February, and the 
disease quickly spread into France and other parts of Europe. Other countries were 
compelled to enforce additional airport screenings for passengers arriving from 
Europe, and many placed temporary embargoes against European agricultural prod-
ucts in order to protect their own supplies. The disease was not contained until 
October 2001, by which time Great Britain had slaughtered over ten million sheep 
and cattle in its efforts to control the spread (Uhlig 2002). All told, the plague cost 
the UK an estimated £8.5 billion ($12.9 billion) in 2001 (Cormier 2013).
Overall, between January 30, 2001, and March 26, 2001, a total of 1,616 organi-
zations, 4,934 people, and 8,439 subjects appeared as key terms within the “Major 
Newspapers” database. These lists were reduced to the 27 organizations, 46 people, 
and 192 subjects that appeared in the most articles based on the results of our three 
scree plots, and all articles featuring at least one of these especially prominent terms 
were analyzed to determine the most important recurring themes in the media.
Second Breakpoint: Week 42
This breakpoint, which appeared during the first week of November, came shortly 
after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. One might speculate that some of the work on 
Wikipedia could have been impacted by the “canary in the coalmine” effect wherein 
people demanded more answers and Wikipedia editors strived to offer them, ulti-
mately attracting more contributors, more data, and more information. Case in 
point: Over the 4 weeks preceding 9/11, Wikipedia attracted 20 new authors, reach-
ing a total of 145. In the 4 weeks after the attack, on the other hand, Wikipedia 
recruited 84 new authors, reaching a total of 229. Similarly, the number of articles 
revised jumped from just under 7,000 to over 11,000, and the number of revisions 
likewise increased by almost 50% (Appendix A, Table A.1). This is a significant 
outpouring of new activity.
Of the many other issues that dominated the public conversation during this 
week, a few topics accrued scattered attention in the press, like the 2001 Australian 
federal election, which saw Prime Minister John Howard’s Liberal Party, alongside 
their coalition partners, the National Party of Australia, defeat the Australian Labor 
Appendix B: Historical and Media Analysis of Wikipedia’s Evolutionary Context

232
Party headed by Kim Beazley (Australian Electoral Commission 2013; Lewis 2001; 
Macken 2001). And in baseball news, Barry Bonds broke the all-time single-season 
home run record on October 5, 2001, amidst a barrage of questions about possible 
steroid use (Aratani 2001).
Yet the biggest topics were, of course, those related to terrorism. Beginning on 
September 18, several lethal anthrax-laced envelopes were delivered to unsuspect-
ing recipients, killing five people and eventually shutting down post offices across 
the country (Beach 2001). The nation remained on high alert for quite some time in 
anticipation of further attacks, especially considering the unexpected use of 
America’s own planes and postal service to attack its citizens where they lived 
(Beach and McCabe 2001). The FBI would conclude in 2010 that a single biologist, 
Bruce E. Ivins, prepared and mailed the anthrax spores himself, without any assis-
tance from others, although some skeptics in Congress maintained that they did not 
believe the real culprit had been found. Regardless, Ivins committed suicide in 2008 
as the government was preparing to indict him, so the FBI closed the case with the 
2010 report (Warrick 2010).
The week 42 breakpoint fell in a media period dominated, according to our anal-
ysis, by 2,646 organizations, 6,981 people, and 18,435 subjects. These were reduced 
to the most prominent 16 organizations, 29 people, and 254 subjects that appeared 
repeatedly across articles.
Third Breakpoint: Week 54
Wikipedia’s one-year anniversary heralded a dramatic change of its own in the form 
of the week 54 breakpoint. Prior to the archival analysis, the set of key terms was 
again reduced to only the most prominent recurring topics, with the full set of 976 
organizations, 2,780 people, and 5,962 subjects condensed to the most frequently 
appearing 14 organizations, 20 people, and 145 subjects.
The theme of interest was again terrorism along with the major economic 
upheaval produced by the Enron scandal. On December 22, 2001, 28-year-old 
Richard Reid attempted to board an airplane in France with the soles of his sneakers 
stuffed with triacetone triperoxide, an explosive powder that experts said may have 
doomed the Boeing 767 aircraft along with its 183 passengers and 14 crew members 
(Hagel et al. 2001; Reid 2001). Thanks to flight delays and rainy weather, however, 
Reid struggled to ignite the explosive while on the plane, and after it became clear 
that he was trying to detonate his shoes, several passengers jointly subdued him. 
Reid pled guilty on October 4, 2002, and was sentenced to life in prison without the 
possibility of parole (Butterfield 2002). His actions contributed to tighter security 
screening procedures at airports, many of which remain in effect a decade and a half 
later (Leiser and Wilson 2002).
The story of John Walker Lindh, the American who went to Afghanistan to join 
al Qaeda, also began to unfold at the start of 2002. In May 2001, Lindh went to 
Afghanistan and decided to fight for the Taliban, readily engaging in combat with 
Appendix B: Historical and Media Analysis of Wikipedia’s Evolutionary Context

233
American troops and their allies in Afghanistan. On November 25, 2001, Lindh’s 
unit surrendered, and he was captured along with his comrades. After a failed prison 
uprising at Qala-i-Jangi and roughly 45 days of interrogations, Lindh was brought 
back to the USA to stand trial (Beach 2002); he pled guilty several months later and 
received a 20-year prison sentence (Liptak 2007).
Also at the beginning of 2002, the Enron Corporation was imploding as the result 
of one of the largest accounting scandals of all time. For years, its executives had 
used an array of accounting loopholes and complicated financial reports to overre-
port earnings and hide billions of dollars in debt from the company’s board of direc-
tors and stockholders (Oppel and Labaton 2002). As a result, Enron’s stock swelled 
to $90 per share in 2000 before diving below $1 by November 2001. The company 
filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and failed entirely shortly thereafter. At the time, it was 
the largest company in history to fall into bankruptcy. Enron executives and several 
involved parties eventually faced criminal charges for fraud, conspiracy, money 
laundering, and other related counts; 16 of them pled guilty to their respective 
charges, and another five were convicted at trial (Pasha and Seid 2006).
Fourth Breakpoint: Week 92
For this breakpoint we identified 1,216 organizations, 3,584 people, and 5,971 sub-
jects that appeared at least once, which we then reduced to the set of 6 organiza-
tions, 9 people, and 136 subjects with the most frequent appearances. In the news, a 
number of serious and, in a few cases, deadly stories took command of the front 
pages. The war on terror still remained the most prevalent topic in the media, but 
with a rather different focus than in the previous year. Specifically, by the one-year 
anniversary of the September 11 attacks, most of the media’s attention had refo-
cused on America’s efforts to combat Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. In mid-­
September, President Bush, along with Britain Prime Minister Tony Blair and 
Australian Prime Minister John Howard, warned Americans that Hussein would 
have access to nuclear weapons by Christmas (Barker 2002; Maguire 2002; Taylor 
2002), and they contended that since an Iraqi attack on the USA was inevitable, they 
needed to take down the “murderous tyrant” first (Mackenzie 2002). Hussein offered 
to readmit U.N. arms inspectors for the first time in four years, supposedly to prove 
that his forces had no nuclear capabilities. Bush, however, dismissed the gesture as 
“a cynical ploy” designed to stall the implementation of tougher U.N. resolutions 
(Harnden 2002). In addition to the nuclear threat, federal health officials were also 
preparing for the possibility of a bioterrorism attack that would reintroduce the 
smallpox virus to America (Auge and Sherry 2002; Franscell 2002).
Nonetheless, some analysts were beginning to blame the weakening US econ-
omy on Bush’s “Iraq rhetoric” (Collins and James 2002), with reluctance toward the 
war (Knickerbocker 2002) and skepticism about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction 
(Black and von Sternberg 2002) beginning to spread through the country. The other 
members of the U.N. security council, especially France and Russia, expressed 
Appendix B: Historical and Media Analysis of Wikipedia’s Evolutionary Context

234
similar sentiments in response to a proposed resolution which would have autho-
rized an invasion of Iraq, chastising US representatives for going “against interna-
tional law” (Overington 2002).
During the same period, the USA was preparing for its midterm elections. Prior 
to the campaign, Democrats had hoped to strengthen their control over the Senate, 
particularly given the number of Republican-held seats that would be contested and 
the stumbling national economy. However, with the November 5 elections coming 
only 14  months after the September 11 attacks, Democrats struggled to muster 
much momentum against their Republican rivals, particularly with a Republican 
sitting as president. Many races were too close to call until election day (Branch-­
Brioso and Plambeck 2002). In the end, Democrats would lose two Senate seats to 
the Republican Party, conceding control of the Senate along with the already 
Republican-controlled House of Representatives (Nagourney 2002). On the other 
hand, in the gubernatorial elections, Democrats gained three governorships while 
the Republicans lost only one (Fox News 2002).
This period also circumscribed the Beltway snipers’ 3-week reign of terror. John 
Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo carried out a series of shootings from 
October 2 through October 22, killing ten people and critically injuring three others 
around Washington, D.C. In each shooting, the victim was killed by a single bullet 
fired from long range. After Muhammad and Malvo killed four people in less than 
2 h, fear pervaded the region. Parents forbade their children from riding the school 
bus home; schools were locked down, with no outdoor gym classes or recesses; and 
pedestrians zigzagged while crossing streets just to counteract the mere possibility 
that a sniper might be aiming at them (MacLeod 2002; see also Washington Post 
Staff Writers 2002). Police eventually connected the pattern of shootings and traced 
an earlier incident to Malvo, who they quickly discovered held close ties to 
Muhammad. The pair were arrested, and while Malvo, who was 17 at the time of the 
attacks, was sentenced to life in prison, Muhammad was sentenced to death and 
eventually executed in 2009 after multiple appeals were denied (Chang et al. 2002; 
White and Glod 2009).
Elsewhere, Russia was dealing with a hostage crisis, as Chechen rebels took con-
trol of a packed theater in Moscow on October 23 and held 912 Russians and foreign 
citizens captive (Krechetnikov 2012; Strauss 2002). After a 3-day standoff, Russian 
forces seized control of the building and killed the rebel chief (Engleman 2002), but 
at the cost of also killing 129 of the hostages—not with guns, but with an unknown 
chemical agent (Coker and Yermolenko 2002; Johnston 2013). The particular gas 
that Russia used was never revealed to the public, nor to foreign embassies in Russia 
that sought to offer their support, all of which complicated doctors’ efforts to treat 
the victims and roiled the international press (Hunter 2002; Ingram 2002).
Yet the biggest story in the worldwide media may have been the bombing attack 
that killed 202 people and injured 240 more in Bali on October 12 (BBC 2003). In 
a coordinated effort, a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives 
inside Paddy’s Pub. Seconds later, another suicide bomber illegally parked a mini-
van, which held 12 filing cabinets containing a volatile chemical compound, outside 
the Sari nightclub across the street from Paddy’s Pub and detonated it. The second

235
blast decimated three buildings and ripped apart the surrounding area, leaving a one 
meter-deep crater in the street (Callinan 2002b; Moor 2012; Parkinson 2002).
This incident, which was eventually connected to Islamist extremists with ties to 
Osama bin Laden, furthered developing fears that Indonesia had become a hiding 
place for al Qaeda and other terrorist cells (Callinan 2002a; Firdaus 2002). Three of 
the terrorists were executed by a firing squad in 2008, and notably, shortly before 
their execution, Indonesia’s Communication and Information Minister Mohammad 
Nuh finally asked his country’s media outlets to stop calling the three executed ter-
rorists “heroes” (Allard and Murray 2008; Antara News 2008).
Fifth Breakpoint: Week 142
The media analysis retained a set of 1,255 organizations, 3,917 people, and 5,723 
subjects, which were condensed to the most prominent 18 organizations, 11 people, 
and 166 subjects, and once again, all articles featuring at least one of those promi-
nent terms were studied within the further archival analysis. The week 142 break-
point included the second anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks (Coorey 
2003), but the period was otherwise uneventful compared with the US elections, the 
Bali bombings, and the Beltway sniper attacks observed during the analysis period 
for the previous breakpoint. However, it was apparent that anti-US sentiments had 
grown considerably over the previous year. French and German representatives 
criticized the USA for seeking greater U.N. involvement in the campaign against 
Iraq, especially given concerns about how quickly governmental control would be 
returned to the Iraqi people (Hartcher 2003b; Richburg 2003). US Democrats lam-
basted Bush for his plans to spend $87 billion more to rebuild Iraq, while other 
nations balked at his request for an additional $55 billion from them (Grice and 
Usborne 2003; Gumbel 2003; Hartcher 2003a; Hutcheson and Douglas 2003). The 
lack of evidence that Iraq ever possessed any weapons of mass destruction, and 
America’s continued search for them, further amplified the anti-US sentiment 
abroad and the anti-Bush attitude among a growing number of Americans (Hartcher 
2003b; Hutcheson and Thomma 2003; Miller 2003).
The US economy, at least, appeared to be on the road to recovery. US census 
data, released at the end of September, revealed that poverty rates rose in 2002 
(Clemetson 2003), but the jobs recovery in the USA, along with similarly positive 
economic trends worldwide, served to offset the census findings (Aylmer 2003; 
Mellish 2003; Pretty 2003). California, on the other hand, was dealing with the 
aftermath of an energy crisis from 2000 to 2001, during which resource mismanage-
ment hit the state with skyrocketing electricity costs and multiple large-scale black-
outs. In 2003, Governor Gray Davis was targeted by a recall campaign by citizens 
who argued that he did not properly respond to the crisis, and after multiple delays, 
the state’s first-ever recall election was scheduled for October 7 (Puzzanghera 
2003). Arnold Schwarzenegger would eventually win the position of governor, 
Appendix B: Historical and Media Analysis of Wikipedia’s Evolutionary Context

236
claiming almost half the votes despite challenges from Democrat Cruz Bustamante, 
fellow Republican Tom McClintock, and 132 other candidates (Finnegan 2003).
Aside from the Iraqi campaign, the only real violence in the news stemmed from 
the long-standing conflict between Israel and its Palestinian neighbors. On 
September 9, two suicide bombings in Israel killed over a dozen people (Bennet and 
Myre 2003), and a second suicide bombing by a Syrian terrorist group reportedly 
claimed 21 lives on October 4. The next day, Israeli jets responded by bombing a 
terrorist base in Syria to send a “very clear message” to the terrorist organizations 
focusing on Israel as well as any countries that harbored terror cells (Blair and Stack 
2003). They were met with limited support from the international community. While 
the EU formally declared Hamas, one of the key groups involved, a terrorist organi-
zation (Keinon 2003), the U.N. tried to enact a resolution that would have protected 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat from harm or expulsion by Israel—a resolution that 
the USA eventually vetoed in order to protect its Israeli allies (Teather 2003).
Congress also approved a do-not-call list to prevent unwanted telemarketing 
calls (McGough 2003), and there was growing controversy regarding the PATRIOT 
Act, a piece of legislation that offered special investigative privileges for the pur-
pose tracking terrorist activity in the USA, a criterion that some commentators 
found overly broad (Lichtblau 2003). Otherwise, though, the period surrounding 
week 142 was relatively quiet compared with the news stories in proximity to previ-
ous breakpoints.
Sixth Breakpoint: Week 204
We retrieved 1,636 organizations, 4,971 people, and 5,672 subjects that appeared at 
least once during the period surrounding the week 204 breakpoint, and 33 organiza-
tions, 21 people, and 168 subjects were found to be especially prevalent. The big-
gest such story was undoubtedly the tsunamis that devastated Indonesia, Sri Lanka, 
India, and Thailand, along with numerous other countries in the region (Gardner 
and Schubert 2004). On December 26, a megathrust earthquake rocked the Indian 
Ocean off the coast of Sumatra; the undersea quake was the third largest ever cap-
tured on a seismograph, with its magnitude estimated to be above 9.0 (US Geological 
Survey 2011). Because of its location, the seismic activity itself did little damage. 
However, it triggered tsunamis that besieged a dozen different countries along the 
coast, annihilating entire communities in an instant. Taken together, the tsunamis 
that stemmed from the Sumatran quake constituted one of the deadliest natural 
disasters ever recorded, claiming the lives of an estimated 225,000–275,000 people 
(CBC 2010) and leaving millions more injured or homeless. The disaster prompted 
worldwide humanitarian aid efforts that ultimately exceeded $14 billion (Jayasuriya 
and McCawley 2010).
Iraq was facing problems of a different sort. Its first democratic elections were 
close on the horizon, yet clashes with insurgents in Fallujah (Allam and Landay 
2004) and elsewhere in the troubled nation (Vick and Sebti 2004) threatened to 
Appendix B: Historical and Media Analysis of Wikipedia’s Evolutionary Context

237
derail the election entirely (Strobel et  al. 2004). The Elections for the National 
Assembly of Iraq did indeed transpire on January 30, 2005, although there were 
more than 100 armed attacks on polling places. Still, tight security prevented any 
major disruptions despite extremist threats to “wash the streets in blood” (Associated 
Press 2005).
Finally, in the USA, the press was ardently covering the fallout of the Guantanamo 
Bay detention camp scandal. In June 2004, a Red Cross team that included experi-
enced medical personnel visited the detention center, and late in November 2004, 
the team’s report, which alleged significant detainee abuses (Leonnig 2004), was 
released (Lewis 2004).
Seventh Breakpoint: Week 250
Our search in the proximity of week 250 retrieved 1,101 organizations, 3,049 peo-
ple, and 4,628 subjects, lists that were subsequently reduced to the most frequently 
recurring 20 organizations, 19 people, and 167 subjects.
Sadly, this breakpoint coincided with another large-scale natural disaster. On 
October 8, a major earthquake struck Kashmir, a disputed territory administered by 
India, Pakistan, and China. The earthquake’s strength was recorded as magnitude 
7.6 on the Richter scale, and an estimated 100,000 people were killed as a result of 
the quake. 138,000 more were seriously injured and approximately 3.5 million lost 
their homes (Haseeb et al. 2011; Mirror Australian Telegraph Publications 2005a, 
b). The earthquake was so severe that it even cracked some of the nearby mountains 
(Sengupta and Rohde 2005).
An estimated $6.7 billion in international aid was pledged toward the relief 
efforts (Associated Press 2010), but much like relief efforts for the Sumatran tsuna-
mis a year earlier, help was slow to arrive to survivors. In this case, however, the 
delays were blamed more on political strife and governmental mismanagement of 
resources than on the conditions themselves. Many of the best-organized aid groups 
were radical Islamic factions, some of whom had thrown their support behind the 
Taliban. Pakistan’s forces, on the other hand, devoted much of their energy toward 
fending off the Taliban along the Afghanistan border, so the groups with the best 
opportunity to assist in the relief effort on the Pakistani side of the border were 
reportedly fighting one another instead. Likewise, India was reportedly slow to 
assist its own citizens in the wake of the disaster, leading some to question the ben-
efit of being Indian (Baldauf and Winter 2005).
In Iraq, the big story was the beginning of Saddam Hussein’s criminal trial (Ford 
2005; Mirror Australian Telegraph Publications 2005c). The defiant former dictator 
was charged with murder, genocide, and ethnic cleansing before the Iraqi Special 
Tribunal on June 30, 2004, based on his actions in the 1982 Dujail massacre (Spinner 
2005). Hussein, who had to be held in a bulletproof cage during the trial, asserted 
that he was still the President of Iraq and that the court had no authority to judge 
him. Arguments about the court’s validity notwithstanding, Hussein would be con-

238
victed of crimes against humanity on November 5, 2006 and hanged on December 
30, 2006 (BBC 2006).
The American press, for its part, was just as concerned with the aftermath of 
Hurricane Katrina, which ravaged the country’s eastern coast in late August. Some 
parties were working to assist with the recovery efforts, whether by providing hous-
ing (Gurnon 2005) or offering employment (Armour 2005). Others were more 
focused on determining who deserved blame for delays and resource shortages in 
the relief efforts (Grier 2005). Numerous aspects of the relief efforts were question-
ably managed, including $5.3 million in food donations that could not be delivered 
due to US rules (Connolly 2005), contracts that were awarded to large corporations 
instead of local businesses without any bidding process (Weisman and Witte 2005), 
and $200 million in donations to the Red Cross that were given for Katrina relief 
and that the organization instead earmarked for use in future crises (Crary 2005). 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) drew especially great public 
scorn for the relief efforts, which eventually led to the ouster of FEMA Director 
Michael Brown (Hsu 2005; McCaffrey 2005).
Eighth Breakpoint: Week 335
Week 335, the moment defining our final breakpoint, fell in mid-June 2007. A total 
of 463 organizations, 593 people, and 3,634 subjects appeared as key terms at least 
once in the “Major Newspapers” database for the 5-week analysis period, but only 
18 organizations, eight people, and 124 subjects were found to hold special 
importance.
The Palestinian struggle between Hamas and Fatah was making headlines, with 
the Gaza Strip in the midst of a civil war between the two sects (Prusher 2007a, b). 
The conflict itself was nothing new; in 2006, Hamas had won control over the 
Palestinian Legislative Council, sparking political and military battles between the 
two groups. These clashes came to a head at this time, as the Battle of Gaza erupted 
from June 7 to June 15 (BBC 2007). As Hamas wrested command over the region 
from Fatah (Nissenbaum 2007), Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, a member 
of the Fatah party, dissolved the Palestinian government on June 14, declaring a 
state of emergency and dismissing Hamas-supported Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh 
(Fisher and Wilson 2007; Wilson 2007). The two groups effectively split into two 
separate, autonomous governments, complicating international relations. Tensions 
in the region only grew worse when Hamas launched a fresh volley of rocket attacks 
at Israel, threatening to destabilize the entire region (Katz 2007; Katz and Keinon 
2007; Katz et al. 2007).
During the same period, another global health scare stirred up public fears once 
more. An Atlanta man who had just returned from his honeymoon in Europe was 
quarantined on May 31 with a potentially deadly strain of tuberculosis (Young 
2007). Many were appalled that Andrew Speaker was able to reenter the USA on 
May 24 despite his symptoms and the fact that European physicians had already 
Appendix B: Historical and Media Analysis of Wikipedia’s Evolutionary Context

239
directed him not to travel. The fear was exacerbated by the fact that computer 
screening at the border failed to properly result in Speaker’s quarantine, stoking 
concerns that the imperfect system might be allowing other dangerous illnesses into 
America’s borders as well (Bluestein and Barrett 2007; Deans 2007; Neergaard and 
Barrett 2007).
Finally, the Group of Eight (G8) summit convened from June 6 to 8 to discuss the 
question of climate change. While the G8’s European members hoped to set spe-
cific, binding benchmarks for greenhouse emission reduction, US representatives 
balked at the idea of aligning its standards solely with those of the other European 
members, saying that China and India had to be part of any global climate change 
plan (Adam and Wintour 2007; Blair and Helm 2007). China’s proposal, in contrast, 
explicitly prioritized economic development and poverty reduction over controlling 
greenhouse gases, eschewing any quantitative requirements for emission reduction 
(Jiangtao 2007). The summit eventually resulted in a climate deal that offered no 
firm targets, only a promise to “seriously consider” setting a goal of halving emis-
sions by 2050 (Laghi 2007).
It was little wonder that the parties failed to reach a compromise on climate 
change, especially given arguments over Russia’s proposed missile defense shield. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin had spent months rejecting a White House plan to 
build a missile defense base in Eastern Europe. He assailed the USA for its plans to 
build missile defense bases in the area he still considered a Russian zone of influ-
ence. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, in turn, warned Putin that European busi-
nesses would leave Russia unless the country embraced western values, to which 
Putin replied that he was the world’s “only true democrat” (MacLeod 2007; 
Saunders 2007).
Concluding Remarks
This overview of world events highlights the variety of sociohistorical and intellec-
tual influences that defined the context in which Wikipedia grew. Although the 
results articulated in Chap. 10 indicate that most of the transitions observed were 
likely triggered primarily by Wikipedia-specific internal factors and external influ-
ences, our detailed investigation on the events surrounding these breakpoints illumi-
nates the fact that Wikipedia’s growth did not occur in a historical void. Rather, the 
community was surrounded by major historical events, especially major natural 
disasters and momentous civil and military conflicts. While we cannot propose any 
direct causal relationships between these events and Wikipedia collaborative pat-
terns, we would like to highlight the fact that the growth of the project, especially its 
agglutination of information in a short period of time, can and does account for 
these events. At each turning point, major events created nodes of interest and activ-
ity that, at the very least, fed the public’s hunger for information and fostered sub-
sequent activity on Wikipedia. The precise manner in which these events interacted 
with Wikipedia’s development, however, demands further investigation.

Appendix C: Advantages and Disadvantages 
of Stepwise Segmented Regression Analysis
In the context of discussing our breakpoint detection strategy, it is worth noting a 
few key strengths and weaknesses of stepwise segmented regression analysis com-
pared to other methods. First and foremost, unlike other algorithms, stepwise seg-
mented regression is able to account for continuous and discontinuous breakpoints 
alike and can detect them without the need for a priori specification. It is also more 
robust than competing approaches due to its basis in regression, which allows it to 
handle high-variance data as well as, to a degree, heteroscedastic variance.
Additionally, because this method is based in regression, stepwise segmented 
regression is further extensible to multidimensional time series. In our study, we 
assessed five factors over time: inbound degree centralization, outbound degree cen-
tralization, betweenness centralization, assortativity, and entropy. Here, five sepa-
rate stepwise segmented regression analyses were conducted to assess these five 
factors. However, a single multivariate regression could have been undertaken to 
achieve the same goal. In our case, the present study stood as a validation of the 
method itself, among other objectives, so conducting five separate analyses and 
observing the differences in the results offered a superior means to observe the 
analysis in action across a range of variables. Other researchers using this method 
may prefer a multivariate regression instead, as that approach will allow them to 
minimize the chance of erroneously detecting multiple breakpoints in close proxim-
ity when only one revolution actually transpired since all available data will be 
incorporated into the sole analysis being conducted rather than being partitioned 
across multiple regression analyses.
On the other hand, while the ability to include regression terms of multiple orders 
(intercept, linear, quadratic, etc.) offers stepwise segmented regression considerable 
versatility, doing so may make it difficult to detect breakpoints that occur in close 
proximity to one another due to the lack of a unique solution. For instance, if four 
regression terms are used in an analysis but a pair of revolutions occurs only 3 weeks 
apart, then the model for that 3-week segment and the associated revolutions will 
inevitably be overfit.

More generally, terms of different orders can easily become confounded with 
one another, particularly for relatively short line segments between breakpoints. For 
example, if even one data point in a short line segment is an outlier, then while the 
revolutions circumscribing that evolutionary period may be correctly identified, that 
period itself may not be properly fitted. As an example, if a given measure experi-
ences a momentary dip that is shortly followed by a return to a high level, the short 
period during which the measure adopted a low level might be inappropriately mod-
eled as a positive quadratic term competing with a negative linear term, when in 
reality the period was one of relative stability. One could even argue, in fact, that the 
breakpoints corresponding to weeks 142 and 207, as modeled for outbound degree 
centralization (Fig. C.1), circumscribed a period that could have been modeled in a 
relatively flat, almost linear fashion rather than as a sharp curvilinear trend.
Such problems are unlikely if, for instance, only an intercept and a linear term 
are included in the stepwise segmented regression model, but they can quickly 
become hazardous with the introduction of additional variables. Therefore, care 
must be taken in incorporating quadratic, cubic, and other higher-order terms into 
any stepwise segmented regression analysis, as the potential consequences of 
including unnecessary terms are greater than in traditional regression.
As a final note, the algorithm upon which stepwise segmented regression is con-
ducted is computationally complex. At each iteration of the process, the algorithm 
must conduct a complete segmented regression analysis corresponding to every

possible breakpoint that could be added to the model. As long as the data set con-
tains only a few hundred or thousand data points, this is not a problem. However, a 
time series with millions of data points would be unwieldy, as this would effectively 
mean that millions of regression terms would have to be evaluated in the stepwise 
model selection process, which in turn would require millions of segmented regres-
sion analyses at every step. Again, this is not a problem for the vast majority of time 
series, for which stepwise segmented regression analyses can be conducted in min-
utes on an average PC. However, attempting to analyze an especially long time 
series with this approach would require either a degree of data compression or sub-
stantial modifications to the analysis itself, as even high-performance computing 
resources might struggle to handle the challenge of analyzing millions upon mil-
lions of successive segmented regression models.
Regardless of the limitations noted above, however, stepwise segmented regres-
sion analysis remains an optimal approach for analyzing longitudinal behavioral 
data, particularly due to its ability to identify any number of continuous and discon-
tinuous breakpoints even amidst substantial error variance. As illustrated in Chap. 9, 
it is ideal for assessing large-scale community dynamics as they change over time, 
and it offers especially great potential for researchers exploring the array of online 
interaction data sets that are waiting to be mined.
