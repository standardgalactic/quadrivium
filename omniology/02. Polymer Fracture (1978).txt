Preface 
This book on "Polymer Fracture" might as well have been called "Kinetic Theory 
of Polymer Fracture". The term "kinetic theory", however, needs some de-
finition or, at least, some explanation. A kinetic theory deals with and particu-
larly considers the effect of the existence and discrete size, of the motion and of 
the physical properties of molecules on the macroscopic behavior of an ensemble, 
gaseous or other. A kinetic theory of strength does have to consider additional 
aspects such as elastic and anelastic deformations, chemical and physical reactions, 
and the sequence and distribution of different disintegration steps. 
In the last fifteen years considerable progress has been made in the latter do-
mains. The deformation and rupture of molecular chains, crystals, and morphologi-
cal structures have been intensively investigated. The understanding of the effect of 
those processes on the strength of polymeric materials has especially been furthered 
by the development and application of spectroscopical methods (ESR, IR) and of 
the tools offracture mechanics. It is the aim of this book to relate the conventional 
and successful statistical, parametrical, and continuum mechanical treatment of 
fracture phenomena to new results on the behavior of highly stressed molecular 
chains. 
The ultimate deformation of chains, the kinetics of the mechanical formation 
of free radicals and of their reactions, the initiation and propagation of crazes and 
cracks, and the interpretation of fracture toughness and energy release rates in 
terms of molecular parameters will be discussed. Although the prime interest had 
been given to these subjects it was not possible to cover the literature completely. 
The author apologizes in advance for all intentional and unintentional omissions 
that will have occurred. In any event this book draws on the existing literature on 
morphology, viscoelasticity, deformation and fracture of high polymers. It is hoped 
that it forms a useful supplement of such monographs in view of a molecular inter-
pretation of polymer fracture.

Chapter 1 
Deformation and Fracture of High Polymers, 
Definition and Scope of Treatment 
The importance of a thorough understanding of the deformation behavior and the 
strength of polymeric engineering materials need not be emphasized. It is obvious 
to anyone who wants to use polymers as load bearing, weather-resisting, or deform-
able components or who wants to grind or degrade them. "Strength" and "frac-
ture" of a sample are the positive and negative aspects of one and the same phenom-
enon, namely that of stress-biased material disintegration. The final step of such 
disintegration manifests itself as macroscopic failure of the component under use, 
be it a water pipe, a glass fiber reinforced oil tank, or a plastic grocery bag. The 
preceding intermediate steps - nonlinear deformation, environmental attack, and 
crack initiation and growth - are often less obvious, although they cause and/or 
constitute the damage developed within a loaded sample. 
Efforts of fracture research are directed, therefore, towards three goals: 
1. To understand the cause and development of a failure and to assess the im-
portance of anyone process contributing to a failure or delaying it 
2. To see whether, how, and with what effect the most damaging process can 
be controlled or even eliminated, and how the strength-determining material prop-
erties can be improved 
3. With the first two goals only partly attainable, one would like to have know-
ledge of the endurance limit of a part in terms of stress or strain level, environment, 
number of loading cycles, or of loading time. 
The first goal is equivalent to the ability to predict the material response under 
all kinds of foreseeable conditions of mechanical, thermal, or environmental attack, 
to characterize the constantly changing state of the material, and to know at any 
moment which conditions of attack are critical for the state the material just at-
tained. To achieve this goal in all generality is hardly possible, in view of the com-
plexity involved in characterizing polymeric structures, let alone their deformation. 
A conclusive discussion of those two subjects and of their interrelation with and 
dependency on other aspects of polymer science is perhaps achieved in the frame-
work of polymer science encyclopedias [1,2] and partially in specialized textbooks 
on the viscoelastic [3, 4], mechanical [5], and physical [6-8] behavior of polymers. 
Although the first goal cannot be achieved in all generality, the literature on frac-
ture (cf. textbooks [9-12]) deals extenSively and successfully with interpretations 
of the fracture event which focus on just those processes which account for the 
most obvious changes of sample morphology during fracture development. 

1. Deformation and Fracture of High Polymers, Definition and Scope of Treatment 
The previous statements on the goals of fracture research are well illustrated 
by the fracture patterns of rigid polyvinylchloride (PVC) shown in Figures 
1.1-1.3. The samples, water pipes internally pressurized, fractured in a brittle man-
ner when the circumferential stress level was high, in a partially ductile manner 
and only after prolonged times at medium stresses, and through thermal crack 
growth (creep crazing) after very long times at low stress levels. The three processes 
leading to pipe failure in these three cases are respectively the rapid extension of a 
flaw, the flow of matter, and the thermally activated growth of a flaw. In all three 
cases the volume element within which the fracture is initiated is finite, consequent-
ly nonhomogeneous deformation must have occurred locally. We will deal with the 
nature and interpretation of such heterogeneous deformation of a supposedly homo-
geneous material later. 
Fig. 1.1. Brittle fracture of an in-
ternally pressurized water pipe 
(polyvinylchloride, PVC), taken 
from Ref. [13]. 
fig. 1. 2. Ductile failure of a PVC pipe at medium stress 
levels (rupture as a result of the reduction of wall thick-
ness at a defect at the indicated position), taken from 
Ref. [131. 
Fig. 1. 3. Long-time failure of a PVC pipe through 
development of a creep craze (from [l3]). 
We also understand the importance of the first goal with respect to achieving 
the second. In the described example of pressurized PVC pipes it was known that 
in the medium time range the performance of a pipe was limited by its creep be-
havior. We would wish, therefore, to decrease the creep rate by increasing the rigidi-
ty of the material; in doeing so, however, we would facilitate crack propagation 
and, possibly, craze initiation and thus reduce the permissible stress levels at short 
and very long times of application.

The third goal, the knowledge of the endurance limit of a part in terms of stress 
or strain level, is generally directly attainable within a certain experimental region. 
Figure 1.4 summarizes, for instance, the test results on PVC pipes at temperatures 
between 20 and 60°C, circumferential stresses between 10 and 50 MN/m2 and a 
range of times to fracture of 0.3 to 104 h. Such representations, which in nongraphi-

cal form can be extended to interrelations between more than three parameters, 
form an important basis of our understanding of material behavior within the multi-
dimensional space covered by the parameters investigated. Material selection and 
optimization of its properties through parameter variation become possible to the 
extent the mathematical framework of parameter-property coefficients holds. With 
regard to fracture this means that one would like to define a fracture criterion in 
terms of the relevant structural and environmental parameters. 
A good example for the occurrence of unpredicted events is offered by the 
behavior of polyethylene (PE) pipes - and of other semicrystalline materials -
under constant circumferential stress; they showed a rapid drop of sustained stresses 
after long loading times (Fig. 1.5). With PE - as with PVC - an initial time range is 
observed where the times to failure are only a weak function of stress. Depending 
on the temperature, the failure mode is either brittle (Fig. 1.1) or ductile (Fig. 1.2 
and 1.6). Both materials are also comparable insofar as the thermally activated 
growth of a creep crack (Fig. 1.3, 1.7, and 1.8) can be held responsible for the fail-

ure of a pipe after long times of service. Both materials are different insofar, as one 
finds in PE - but practically not in PVC - that the kinetics of creep crack develop-
ment differs markedly from that of ductile failure (Fig. 1.5). This finding only under-
lines that it is necessary to deal directly with the physical nature of material defect 
development in order to predict reliably material behavior - especially for new ap-
plications - and/or improve properties through additional components or modified 
production. 
In this monograph we wish to discuss the physical nature of defect develop-
ment, and we will focus on linear thermoplastic and elastomeric polymers (Table 1.1.). 
We recognize that these materials cover a wide range of properties, although they 
are composed of molecules which exhibit a number of similarities: they are pre-
dominantly linear, flexible, highly anisotropic (nonp.xtended) chains having molecu-
lar weights between 20000 and more than 1000000. Figure 1.9 gives a represen-

tation of a (polyamide 6) chain showing the nonextended collformation, an 
arbitrary division into segments, and - in the insert - the primary bonds forming 
the backbone chain The relative sizes of the atoms and the proportion of volume 
occupied by them within the chain is illustrated by the Stuart model of a polyamide 
segment (Fig. 1.10). In actual size this segment has an extended length of 1.97 nm. 
If such a segment could be stressed in the chain axis direction, the bending and 
stretching of primary bonds would result in a chain stiffness of about 200 GN/m2 
[15], whereas the intermolecular attraction of segments through the much weaker 
van der Waal's forces entails a stiffness of "only" 3 to 8 GN/m2 in a direction per-
pendicular to the chain axis. The fact that polymer molecules are long, anisotropic, 
and flexible chains accounts for the characteristic properties of polymeric solids,

namely the anisotropy of macroscopic properties, the microscopic heterogeneity 
and the nonlinearity and strong time-dependency of polymer response to mechanical 
excitation. 
All solid plastics, from rubbery networks to rigid glasslike bodies, are aggregates 
of such molecular chains, which cohere through physical (temporary) or chemical 
(permanent) "cross-links". The wide variety of the macroscopic mechanical properties 
of these materials is caused by differences in aggregation (crystallinity or super-
structure) and in molecular parameters, as for instance by differences in chain 
structure, intermolecular segmental attraction, segment mobility, or cross-link den-
sity. Unfortunately these parameters are not fixed values attached to a molecular 
species or a polymeric body, but depend on polymer processing and on environ-
mental conditions. In fact simply by changing the time or temperature scale of 
the mechanical excitation of one and the same polymer a wide range of responses 
will be obtained: from that of a brittle glass to that of a highly viscous liquid. 
This general behavior is depicted in a time-temperature diagram, given by Retting 
[22] for hard PVC (Fig. 1.11). Within the relatively small temperature interval 
from 0 to 100 °C (rapid loading) or - 100 to +60 °c (creep) the indicated changes 
from glass to rubber, from - macroscopically - brittle to highly ductile defor-

mation and fracture are observed. The changes in the type of response of a given 
aggregate of chains clearly indicate that different deformation processes must be 
dominant in different regions of the time-temperature regime. 
In discussing the physical nature of defect development it is necessary to speci-
fy which form of local deformation eventually leads to a disintegration of the poly-
meric solid or to a localized heterogeneous deformation and to crack initiation. In 
previously proposed kinetic theories quite different processes were held responsible 
for the development of macroscopic failure. Viscous flow (within cotton fibers) was 
suggested by Busse and his colleagues [23] to determine the fatigue life of these 
fibers. The "slippage" of secondary bonds and the net decrease of the number of 
bonds was considered by Tobolsky and Eyring [24] for the two cases where repair 
of bonds under stress is possible or impossible. A model involving two independent 
networks was discussed by Stuart and Anderson [25] who argued that only fracture 
within the first network with unsymmetrical potential barriers between broken and 
unbroken states contributes to failure of glasses. A theory of correlated Brownian 
motion of groups of atoms (VielJachplatzwechsel) proposed by Holzmiiller [26, 
27] is based on Boltzmann statistics of phonon energy distribution where the pho-
nons are the independent statistical units. 
The idea that the breaking of primary chemical bonds plays a decisive role in 
fracture was independently forwarded by Zhurkov [28, 29] and Bueche [30, 31]. 
Bueche, and later Halpin [32, 33] and Smith [34, 35], had been concerned with the 
strength of rubbery polymers, and found that the time-temperature dependence 
of the ultimate properties could be explained by the deformation behavior and the 
finite extensibility of molecular strands. Prevorsek and Lyons [36, 37] emphasized 
that the random thermal motion of chain segments leads to nucleation and growth 
of voids without breakage of any load-carrying bonds. The lifetime of a sample 
then is determined by the time it takes one flaw to grow to a critical size. Niklas 
and Kausch [13] discussed the effect of the dissociation of dipole-dipole associates 
on the strength of PVC. 
To the molecular processes specified above one has to add the unspecified ones: 
internal destruction, damage, or crack formation probability. In analogy to the 
molecular description of deformation used by Blasenbrey and Pechhold [38] all of 
these molecular processes can be referred to the four physical rearrangements that 
can occur between neighboring chain segments with parallel chain axes: change of 
conformation (segment rotation, gauche-trans transformation), cavitation, slip, and 
chain scission. In Figure 1.12 these rearrangements of segment pairs are shown. Of 
these chain scission and - to some extent - cavitation and slip are potentially 
detrimental to the load-bearing capacity of a polymer network. Conformational 
changes on the other hand appear to be "conservative" processes, which by them-
selves will modify and delay but never generate any progress in the development 
of a fracture process. 
Here it seems to be necessary to say a word about the meaning of the terms 
fracture, rupture, and failure as they will be used within this text. Andrews [9] says, 
"Fracture is the creation of new surfaces within a body ... The term rupture may 
be regarded as truly synonymous but not the term failure since the latter indicates 
only that some change has taken place in the body (generally an engineering com-

ponent of some kind) which renders it unsuitable for its intended use. Fracture is 
only one of many possible modes of failure". We will supplement this definition 
by saying that as a result of the creation of new surfaces either holes have to open 
up or formerly connected parts of the fractured specimen have to become detached 
from each other. 
In mathematical terms we may define a fracture process as one by which the 
sum of the degrees of connectedness of the parts of a sample or a structural element 
is increased by at least one. This definition includes the piercing of films and tubes, 
but excludes minute damages as caused by crazing or chain scission. 
The term fracture process is meant to describe the whole development of a 
fracture from its initiation through crack growth and propagation to completion 
of the fracture. In contrast to thermal or environmental degradation and failure 
10 

1. Deformation and Fracture of High Polymers, Definition and Scope of Treatment 
the fracture process is understood as stress-biased material disintegration. It carries 
on if and only if a driving force exists, which has literally to be a force. Forces,how-
ever, will give rise to deformations. This means that fracture initiation will always 
be preceeded by specimen deformation. 
From Figure 1.12 it could be concluded that, in the absence of flow, chain scis-
sion and chain strength determine the mechanical properties of polymers. In fact, 
there are a number of observations which support this assumption: 
with increasing number n of chain atoms, a saturated linear hydrocarbon will 
turn from gas to liqUid (n;> 5) and to solid (n ;> 18); the solid will attain tech-
nically useful strength (10 MN/m2 ) if n is around 2000; with increasing molecular 
weight and chain orientation that strength may still be increased 50-fold [19, 
20]; 
the mechanical loading and rupture of virtually all natural and synthetic polymers 
leads to the scission of molecular chains and the formation of free radicals [39]; 
the strength and the hardness of solids increase with volume concentration of 
primary bonds [40]; 
in a number of uniaxial tensile fracture experiments the energy of activation of 
sample fracture coincided with the activation energy for main chain bond 
scission [39]. 
The observation that sample strength increases with molecular weight and chain 
orientation is illustrated in more detail by Figure 1.13. In low molecular weight ma-
terial chain slip occurs readily, so that the sample strength depends solely on the 
strength of intermolecular attraction. Noticeable macroscopic strength is only ob-
tained once the molecular weight is sufficient to permit physical cross-links through 
entanglements or chain folds between several chains. In the range of molecular 
weights between 1.5 and 3 x 104 g/mol, fiber strength increases with molecular 
weight, whereas at still higher molecular weights, the effect of the increasing num-
ber of defects introduced in processing such a fiber, tends to outweigh the effect 
of the decreasing number of chain ends (Fig. 1.13, Curve I). It is also indicated in 
Figure 1.13 (Curves I-IV) that high strength with a high, degree of orientation (e.g., 
obtained at higher drawing temperatures Td ) requires high molecular weights [41]. 
The effects of crystal structure and molecular weight on macroscopic tensile strength 
are shown by curves V and VI [43]. 
On the other hand, the data of Table I do not support a simple relation between 
the strength values of individual chains and of the solids formed thereof. Young's 
moduli of bulk specimens are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the 
corresponding chain moduli, bulk strengths at room temperature are two to three 
orders of magnitude smaller than chain strengths. The critical stress, which is the 
fracture stress at that temperature where fracture changes from ductile to brittle, 
i.e., at a temperature well below the glass transition temperature, is also one to two 
orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding chain strengths. The tensile 
strengths observed at different morphological levels are indicated in Figure 1.14. 
In the cited monographs [2-10] very little has been said about the details of 
how molecular destruction processes effect ultimate properties. In the last 10 years, 
however, considerable progress has been made in precisely this area, in the investi-
gation of the deformation, strength, and scission of chain molecules. Mainly dealing

With these words of introduction we are in a position better to define the scope 
of this book. The central theme is the behavior of chain molecules under conditions 
of extreme mechanical excitation and the likely role of chain scission in the initia-
tion and development of macroscopic fracture. We will study the structure and de-
formation of solid polymers (Chapter 2) in an attempt to define the conditions 
under which elastic straining of chains occurs. We will then discuss existing non· 
morphologic fracture theories (Chapter 3) in view of our central theme. The mo· 
lecular description of fracture begins with a brief account of the strength of primary 
bonds (Chapter 4) and of the thermo mechanical excitation and scission of chain 
segments (Chapter 5). The study of free radicals formed as a consequence of stress· 
induced chain scission (Chapters 6~8) constitutes the main part of this volume. It 
is the only part of this book where a comprehensive coverage of the existing litera-
ture has been attempted. In the final chapter, 9, the role of molecular chains in 
heterogeneous fracture will be analyzed. For this purpose a brief introduction is 
given into the mechanics of fracture (stress analysis of cracks in elastic and elastic· 
plastic materials, slow crack propagation). The fracture mechanical functions criti-
cal energy release rate GIc and fracture toughness KIc are interpreted from a non·

ing. A discussion of molecular and morphological aspects of crack propagation and 
of possible failure criteria concludes this monograph. 
As mentioned in the introduction, a kinetic theory of fracture deals with and 
particularly considers the existence and discrete size, the motion, and the response 
of molecules or their parts in a stressed sample. It thus requires a molecular de-
scription of polymer structure and deformation. Such a description is available in 
the cited books [1-12], [20] or papers [15,38]. In Chapter 2 only a very brief 
summary is offered which is not meant to be self-supporting or complete.

The basic structural elements of high polymer solids are the chain rr.olecules. The 
variety of their structure and flexibility permits different modes of organization 
and mechanical interaction. At this point the characteristic elements of structure 
and superstructure of amorphous and semi crystalline polymers will be introduced. 
The interrelations between chain parameters (structure and regularity), crystal or 
superstructural parameters (degree of crystallinity, lattice structure, nucleation and 
growth kinetics, defects), and environmental parameters are extensively discussed 
in the literature and are not the object of this book [1-3]. 
If no regular organizatzion or no colloidal structure within a solid aggregate of 
chains becomes apparent one speaks of an amorphous state. In recent years the 
interpretation of the non-ordered or amorphous state of solid high polymers has 
been subject to lively discussions and careful studies. Until about 1960 the general 
view prevailed that the chain molecules in isotropic, non-crystalline polymers as in 
many rubber, glassy polymers such as PS*), PVC, PMMA, PC, or quenched "semi-
crystalline" polymers such as PCTFE, PTFE, PETP have a random conformation 
and that the random coil or spaghetti model gives an adequate description of the 
"structure" of these polymers. In the years following 1960 the concept of a close 
range order of the chain molecules within X-ray amorphous polymers gained grow-

which are used in this monograph. The abbreviations are in accordance with the international 
standards proposed by ASTM. DIN, and ISO.

ing support. The evidence for a close range order was thought to derive from a com-
parison of segment volume and amorphous density, from electron microscopic ob-
servation of structural elements, from calorimetric investigations, from a discussion 
of crystallisation kinetics, and from a study of network orientation. After 1970 
Kirste, Schelten, Fischer, Benoit, and their associates [4-6,91] were applying neu-
tron scattering techniques to amorphous polymers in addition to employing light 
and small angle x-ray scattering and spectroscopic methods. They concluded that 
their experiments and the previous experiments of other authors have given no 
positive clue either against the random coil hypothesis or in favor of the concept 
of an existing close range order in PS, PMMA, PC, SI or the amorphous regions of 
PE. Flory [7], [8] also summarizes his extended observations on polymers in solu-
tion, rubbery networks, and amorphous one- and two-phase materials in favor of 
the random coil structure of chains in bulk. These authors [4-8], [9], [100- 104 ] 
state in fact that the radius of gyration of a polymer molecule in the bulk agrees 
well with the unperturbed dimensions measured in the melt or in dilute solution. 
Hosemann, Pechhold, and Yeh [9- 12] propose that amorphous states and 
defect-rich, Originally ordered states are commensurable. They thus retain elements

of close range order. Their amorphous state is not principally but only gradually 
different from a well ordered state. Figure 2.1 shows model representations of the 
various interpretations of the nature of the amorphous state: 
a) interpenetrating random coils [4], [7] 
b) and c) honeycomb and meander m0!iel [10], [11]

e) fringed micellar domain structure [13]. 
In agreement with the considerations above the term amorphous is used to in-
dicate the absence of crystallographic reflections. If we wish to place importance on 
the absence or presence of a close range order within amorphous regions we will 
explicitly say so. In the following discussion ordered structural elements are to be 
characterized. In doing so one should keep in mind that for the interpretation of 
ordered structures in real polymer solids one finds a situation somewhat inverse to 
the interpretation of the amorphous state, i.e. one should keep in mind that in any 
real polymer well ordered regions are of limited size and finite degree of perfection. 
B. Crysta llites 
From the beginning of polymer science it had been known that native as well as 
synthetic high polymers crystallize [14a]. Analysis of x-ray diffraction patterns has 
revealed the lattice structure and unit cell dimensions of high polymer crystallites. 
Up to 1957 it was believed that the crystallites are of the fringe micelle type. A 
typical micelle was supposed to bundle some tens of hundreds of different molecules 
which - after leaving the micelle and passing through amorphous regions - would 
at random join other micelles. In 1957 Fischer [15], Keller [16], and Till [17] in-
dependently from each other discovered and proposed that high polymers form single 
crystal lamellae within which chain folding occurs. Figure 2.2 shows an electron 
micrograph of a stack of PE single crystals [18] grown from dilute solution and 
Figure 2.3 the arrangement of the chain molecules in such lamellar crystals. Here

the PE chain is folded - with adjacent reentry of the chain after each fold - within 
the (110) plane of the ortho-rhombic PE crystal. The unit cell dimensions have been 
determined [19] to be 
a = 0.74 nm 
b = 0.493 nm 
c = 0.353 nm (chain axis direction). 
The largest of the lozenge-shaped single crystals shown has an edge length of 
4700 nm and a thickness of about 10 to 15 nm (originally the crystal seems to 
have been a hollow pyramid which became flattened during preparation). Lamellar 
crystals - including extended chain crystals - of various degrees of perfection and 
size are the product of crystallization from solution or from the melt under appro-
priate conditions. The extreme mechanical anisotropy of the chain molecules is 
reflected by that of their crystallites. For example the elastic response of PE single 
crystals in the three axis directions differs by two orders of magnitude. The elastic 
modulus is found [20] to be: 
Ea = 
5.7 GN/m2 
Eb= 
2.1 GN/m2 
Ee = 180-340 GN/m2 
C. Superstructure 
At this point the superstructure or morphology of polymers is reviewed with a desire 
to identify and define elements of their heterogeneity. The most important hetero-
geneities derive from the tendency of many polymers to (partially) cry&tallize. More 
or less well defmed crystalline lamellae are found in form of single crystals as de-
scribed above, stacked and/or grown upon each other in the form ofaxialites or 
sheaving layer structures, as twisted aggregates in spherulites, and in the form of 
sandwich-like structures in highly oriented fibrils [1-3]. The radially symmetric 
growth of twisting lamellae (Fig. 2.4) from many nuclei which leads to the spherulitic 
structure, is shown in Figures 2.5. This is the largest and dominant feature of melt-
crystallized specimens.

lized polyoxymethylene. 
Presently it is discussed [91,92,100] whether and to what extent the lamellar 
crystals of a solid semicrystalline polymer show the same regularly folded structure 
as solution grown single crystals. Schelten et al. [91] concluded that the results of 
the small-angle neutron scattering of deuterated PE molecules (PED) in a protonated 
PE host (PEH) are incompatible with a regularly folded morphology. Yoon and Flory 
[92] supported Scheltens conclusions. They compared the intensity distributions 
calculated for several morphological models with the experimental scattering data 
[91]. The best fit could be obtained for a model where 30% of "the chains emanating 
from a crystalline layer escape therefrom instead of re-entering the layer at the ad-
jacent lattice site". After extended analysis of these and additional own data, Fischer 
[100] stated that the radii of gyration (of quenched PE, of PEO crystallized by slow 
cooling, and of isothermally crystallized isotactic PP) were only slightly affected 
by crystallisation or annealing even though drastic changes of the long spacing 
(12-25 nm) had occurred. With regard to the problem of chain folding and adjacent 
reentry, the majority of the results seemed to indicate that the adjacent reentry model 
is not compatible with neutron scattering behavior. On this basis Fischer [100] ad-
vanced a "solidification-model of crystallization" which excludes large scale diffusion-
al motion of chain segments during crystallization. 
The boundaries between spherulites resemble grain boundaries; these grain bound-
ary zones are enriched in low molecular weight material, impurities, chain ends, and 
defects. The deformation and strength of such a "composite" structure naturally 
depend on the compliances of all of its components. In such a composite large com-
pliances (small constants of elasticity) have to be assigned to the cohesion across 
19 

2. Structure and Deformation 
grain boundaries and across lamellar fold surfaces. The cohesion between chains 
within a crystal lamella is much stronger than the inter crystalline interaction; this 
renders a certain stability to the lamellar elements in sample deformation. The de-
formation behavior of such a non-oriented semicrystalline polymer will, therefore, 
depend much more on the nature of the secondary forces between the structural 
elements than on the length or strength of the chain molecules. 
The different forms of superstructure are related to the structure and compo-
sition of the molecular species involved, and to the conditions of polymerization, 
processing, and environmental treatment, i.e. on nearly every parameter involved 
in producing a polymeric solid. For illustration of the size and shape of supermolec-
ular structures formed during the initial phase of polymerization of a homopolymer 
attention is called to the fibrous or globular structures reported by Wristers [21] for 
polyolefines. These structures are obtained after polymerization in gaseous or liquid 
environment and at low or high efficiency of various Ti-, V-, Cr-, or AI-based cata-
lysts. In Figures 2.6 to 2.8 electron micrographs of such nascent polymer structures 
are reproduced [21]. Polypropylene at low catalyst efficiency is formed in globules 
of 0.5 J.llIl diameter (Fig. 2.6), at high catalyst efficiency fibers several J1m long are 
observed (Fig. 2.7); the fiber diameter is closely correlated with the lateral face 
dimension of the primary catalyst crystal and varies between 0.37 and 2 J.llIl for 
TiCl3 -crystal breadths of between 5 and 50 nm. Polyethylene samples prepared with 
TiCI4-AI(i-Buh or other colloidal catalysts show less regular surface structures 
(Fig. 2.8).

propylene prepared at low catalyst efficiency

efficiency (taken from Ref. (211). 
In the course of the bulk polymerization of lactams it was observed [22] that 
the resultant polymers precipitated in the form of spherulites. Other examples are 
the fibrous, globular, or star-shaped aggregates existing in PVC [23-26] which have 
sizes of between 10 and about 500 nm. In good solvents the largest aggregates dis-
integrate into single molecules but only at temperatures larger than 200°C [25]. 
20 

I. Elements of the Superstructure of Solid Polymers 
Fig. 2.8. Polypropylene prepared with 
TiCl4 - Al(i-Buh (taken from Ref. (211). 
A large group of multi-phase polymeric systems is formed by the block co-
polymers, graft copolymers, random copolymers, and poly-blends. This group of 
polymers has received increasing attention (e.g. 27-29) because of the controllable, 
"tailor-made" properties of these engineering materials. Here the superstructure is 
determined by the relative weight, sequential order, and limited miscibility or even 
incompati bility 
of the covalently connected molecular segments of hard (glassy, thermoplastic) 
and soft (elastomeric, rubbery) chains as within the (two- or three-) block copoly-
mers and random copolymers 
of the (two) phases grafted onto eachother within graft-copolymers or 
of the molecules mixed together in poly-blends. 
The variety of ensuing multi-phase structures cannot be discussed here in any 
detail; it ranges from the extremely ordered hexagonal patterns of spherical domains 
of one phase embedded within the continuous phase (mostly of the dominant com-
ponent) to the partial phase separation of solution-cast poly-blends occurring only 
after heat treatment [27-29]. In Figure 2.9 an electron micrograph of the morpho-
logy of a butadiene styrene diblock copolymer is reproduced [31]. At 17% by weight 
the styrene forms the discrete phase of spherical or cylindrical aggregates in a con-
tinuous butadien phase. Owing to the homogeneity of block lengths the aggregates 
are arranged in highly regular lattices. The sizes of the aggregates correspond very 
well to the molecular conditions. They must be larger than one diameter of the coil 
formed by the PS segment and must be smaller than two such diameters to permit 
phase separation while maintaining material continuity [28-30]. 
For a study of the effect of chain length and strength quite naturally structures 
which contain a high degree of oriented chains are more promising than others. One 
of the most widely investigated ones are the semicrystalline fibers. The characteristic, 
microfibrillar and sandwichlike structure of highly oriented fibers will be discussed 
in connection with the electron spin resonance investigations of chain scission es-
pecially observed in these fibers. 
Still higher degrees of chain orientation are found in the extended chain crys-
tallites, row structures, and highly lamellar "hard-elastic" or "springy" forms of 
crystallizable polymers which recently have become of considerable interest. Follow-

ing early investigations of Keller [32], Pennings et al. [33] and Kawai et al. [34] 
much work has been devoted to the row structures or shish-kebabs which consist 
of ribbon-like backbones overgrown by folded chain platelets. Each backbone fiber 
again seems to be composed of ultimate fibrils (microfibers) less than 10 nm in 
diameter [35]. These structures do form in crystallization under molecular orienta-
tion, in sheared dilute solution as well as in extrusion from the melt [36]. Com-
prehensive reviews on these microfibers have recently been given by Tucker and 
George [35-36]. According to them the transverse dimension of these microfibers 
is of the order of 0.8 to 20 nm in various celluloses, and between 7 and 50 nm in 
most thermoplastic fibers; rnicrofiber lengths are given as 18 to over 1000 nm [35]. 
At the time of this writing Zwijnenburg and Pennings [37] report on a technique 
to obtain PE macrocrystals of virtually infinite length. There, a seed crystal and -
subsequently - the growing crystalline PE fiber is pulled under steady-state con-
ditions from a flowing solution. The diameter of the obtained fiber, an agglomera-
tion of shish-kebab fibrils, varied between 10 and 40 Jilll [37]. 
In the more recent years the solid state extrusion of thermoplastic polymers 
involving very high pressure (up to 5 kbar = 0.5 GN/m2 ), temperatures between 
30 and about 250°C, and extensional flow has been studied [38-44]. In the case 
of PE such a treatment led to a new high-pressure, high-temperature phase of hexag-
onal symmetry at a high level of chain extension. In analogy to the extended-chain 
crystals observed by e.g. Anderson [45] in the fracture surfaces of low-molecular 
weight PE the term extended-chain crystals is presently being used for pressure crys-
tallized PE also. Weeks and Porter found that highly oriented strands of such material 
(Mw = 58000) have an exceptional stiffness of 70 GN/m2 at room temperature 
which is comparable to that of E-glass [40]. In addition a good tensile strength of 
500 MN/m2 is reported [41]. Lupton and Regester [39] worked with ultrahigh-
22 

I. Elements of the SuperstrUcture of Solid Polymers 
molecular-weight (UHMW) HDPE with Mw between 2 and 3· 106 g/mol and ob-
tained a stiffness of 2 to 3 GN/m2 and a strength of 33-39 MN/m2 , but an excel-
lent tensile-impact resistance of 300 to 600 kJ/m2 • Capaccio and Ward [93-98] 
prepared ultra oriented polymers (PE, PP, POM) by means of cold drawing and 
hydrostatic extrusion. A fibrillar structure seemed to be retained in those samples. 
With increasing draw ratio the morphology would be characterized primarily by a 
continuum of oriented material in which a statistical distribution of chain ends 
would constitute the only discontinuities. Thus an increasingly smaller fraction of 
the material would show the conventional morphology comprising crystals and 
oriented amorphous chains, including tie molecules, in series. 
In the last few years it has been discovered that by controlled drawing and an-
nealing treatment of a number of fiber forming thermoplastics a highly crystalline 
morphology with "springy" or hard elastic response could be obtained [46-51, 
105]. Springy behavior, the characteristics of which will be discussed in the next 
section, has been found so far in PP, POM, PE, PMP, PES, and even in PA 66 [47, 
105]. The morphology is proposed to consist of stacks of flat, highly regular, 
c-axis oriented folded chain lamellae with the lamellae interconnected at points 
about 100 nm apart [46-51,105]. 
D. Characterization 
The experimental methods available to determine or characterize the structure of 
polymer chains or of their aggregates are discussed in the general references of 
Chapter 1. In addition information on X-ray diffraction [3], neutron scattering 
[4-6], electron- and light-scattering [4, 52, 53], optical and electron microscopy 
[3, 14b], thermal [3, 54] and viscoelastic behavior [14c, 55-57], and nuclear mag-
netic resonance (NMR) technique [3] can be obtained from the references of this 
Chapter. Infrared absorption (IR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques 
will be introduced in Chapters 5 and 6 respectively. Except for the microscopic 
methods all of the mentioned techniques provide an average information, an in-
formation to which all structural elements within the active volume of an investi-
gated sample contribute according to their individual response, concentration, and 
position. Any macroscopic information which is not solely taken as such but is used 
to characterize an inhomogeneous solid generally involves elemental response func-
tions and orientation distributions which are not completely known. For this reason 
a certain ambiguity is introduced into the deconvolution of such experimental data. 
This leaves some room for individual interpretations as to the concentration and 
nature of structural elements. This ambiguity has been inherent in the discussion 
of the existence or non-existence of close range order in amorphous polymers and 
of the nature and distribution of defects within crystallites. Of even more concern 
for the structural interpretation of mechanical properties is the fact that the nature 
of the connecting members between structural elements is much less well known 
than the nature of the latter. This is true on all levels: for the arrangement and inter-
action of non-ordered chain segments, for the fold surfaces of lamellar crystals and 
the connections between them, for the amorphous regions between crystallites in 
23 

2. Structure and Deformation 
fibers or unoriented poly crystalline samples, and for the boundaries of microfibrils 
or spherulites. This will be further illustrated in the next section. 
II. Deformation 
A. Phenomenology 
The deformation of the complex structures described in the last section involves a 
number of different - and characteristic - phenomena ranging from a linear elastic 
to a highly viscous response. Figure 2.1 0 gives examples of the different types of 
quasi-static uniaxial-deformation behavior of thermoplastic polymers in the non-
rubbery temperature region. The stress-strain curve a) is that of a brittle polymer 
(polystyrene at room temperature) characterized by its very limited extensibility 
and the steep and monotonous increase of stress with strain. Curve b) represents a 
hard elastic polymer, lamellar polypropylene film [58], which combines strong 
elastic behavior with good extensibility at a high stress level and almost complete 
recovery (within a period of days). Curve c) is that of a ductile polymer. The initial 
monotonous increase of the engineering stress generally is less steep than that of a 
brittle polymer, i.e. the secant modulus is smaller. The engineering stress a reaches 
a maximum at the yield point (Streckgrenze) which marks the beginning of the so-
called cold drawing, a notable reduction in cross-section of the strained specimen. 
If the stress-strain curve extends considerably beyond the yield point one speaks of 
a tough polymer; the shape of the curve depends on the strain hardening behavior 
of the polymer and on the tendency to neck formation. Curve d) is characteristic 
for soft polymers, e.g. for thermoplastics at a temperature close to their glass transi-
tion temperature or plasticised polymers, which do not yet show rubber elastic be-
havior. 
As indicated earlier the different stress-strain curves are not characteristic for 
particular, chemically defined species of polymers but for the physical state of a 
polymeric solid. If the environmental parameters are chosen accordingly transitions 
from one type of behavior (e.g. brittle, curve a) to another (e.g. ductile, curve c) 
will be observed. These phenomenological aspects of polymer deformation are dis-
cussed in detail in [14], [52-53], [55-57], and in the general references of Chap-
ter 1. A decrease of rate of strain or an increase of temperature generally tend to 
increase the ductility and to shift the type of response from that of curve a) towards 
that of curves c) and d). At small strains (between zero and about one per cent) the 
uniaxial stress a and the strain € are linearly related (Hooke's law): 
(2.1) 
Even at these small deformations the apparent Young's modulus E is a function 
of the rate of strain. This shows that E is not solely determined by the energy elastic 
deformation of bond angles, bond lengths, and intermolecular distances but also 
involves time-dependent displacements of atoms and small atom-groups. In the fol-
24 

II. Deformation 
lowing region (1 to about 5% of strain) stress and strain are no longer proportional 
to each other, structural and conformational rearrangements occur that are me-
chanically although not thermodynamically reversible, one speaks of an elastic (vis-
coelastic in the narrow sense) or paraelastic behavior. Beyond the yield point large 
scale reorientation of chains and lamellar crystals begins, a process generally termed 
plastic deformation. A true plastic deformation can be understood as the transfor-
mation from one equilibrium state to another equilibrium state without the creation 
of frozen-in tensions. The latter point is particularly important in view of the fact 
that the average post-yield deformation is brought about largely by mechanically 
reversible anelastic conformational changes of the molecules and not by flow of 
molecules past each other. Unless a state of equilibrium had been established through 
proper annealing treatment highly drawn samples may retract considerably. Within 
the context of this book emphasis should be placed, however, not so much on the 
processes leading to or accompanying molecular reorientation - which is basically 
a reinforcing effect - but on the damaging processes of chain scission, void forma-
tion, and flow. The latter processes gradually occur in the strain region from just 
before the yield point up to final fracture. Among the damaging processes one has 
also to include the phenomenon of normal stress yielding or crazing of glassy poly-
mers which will be discussed in Chapter 9. 
Not represented in Figure 2.1 0 is the deformation behavior of cross-linked net-
works of highly flexible elastomeric chains. The characteristic tensile deformation 
of elastomers is not based on energy elasticity but rather on the change of entropy 
accompanying the deformation and orientation of randomly coiled chain molecules

[59]. To a first approximation stress, uniaxial extension ratio A, and shear modulus 
G are related by 
(2.2) 
The shear modulus G is proportional to the absolute temperature T, Boltzmann 
constant k, and the number N of subchains between cross-links: 
G = NkT = pRT (1-2 Me/M)/Me 
(2.3) 
where M and Me are the number-average molecular weights of the uncrosslinked 
polymer and of the sub chains respectively, p is polymer density. 
The pure rubber-elastic deformation is mechanically completely reversible and 
does not involve chain scission or creep. A real rubber, however, like any viscoelastic 
solid, shows on a molecular scale energy and entropy elastic deformation accompa-
nied by viscous flow. Thus it shows stress relaxation at constant strain, creep at 
constant load, and energy dissipation in dynamic excitation. Representation of the 
macroscopic mechanical response of viscoelastic solids - even in a strain region 
where no large-scale reorientation occurs - requires, therefore, the use of damped 
elastic elements consisting of springs (modulus G) and rate sensitive damping ele-
ments (dashpots characterized by a viscosity 1/). The simplest elements are the Max-
well element with spring (G) and dashpot (1/) in series and the Voigt (Kelvin) element 
with spring G and dash pot 1/ in parallel. The Maxwell element has a relaxation time 
T = 1//G, the Voigt-Kelvin element has the same relaxation time which here more 
precisely is called retardation time. The phenomenological theory of viscoelasticity 
[55] describes the mechanical response of a body in terms of a distribution of basic 
viscoelastic elements primarily characterized by their relaxation times Tj. If the 
spectra of the molecular relaxation times, H (1m), are known, then the viscoelastic 
modulus functions are, in principle, derivable therefrom [14c, 14d, 55]. The time-
dependent shear or stress relaxation modulus G(t) becomes in terms of a continuous 
spectrum of relaxation times: 
+= 
G(t) = Ge + f H exp(-tIT) dIm 
(2.4) 
where Ge is the modulus at infinite times which - in the case of a solid - is sup-
posedly larger than zero. The modulus functions are conveniently treated as complex 
quantities consisting of a ( recoverable) storage and an (irrecoverable) loss compo-
nent; the ratio of loss (e.g. Gil) and storage component (G') is called the loss tangent 
or loss factor, i.e. tan 0 = Gil IG'. The phenomenological theory of viscoelasticity is 
based on the Boltzmann superposition principle, i.e. on the linear additivity of the 
effects of mechanical history. It should be emphasized that the aim of that theory 
is not so much to derive the form of the relaxation time spectra from detailed struc-
tural considerations but rather to utilize the response functions obtained in one 
experiment, e.g. creep, to predict the response of the same material under different 
excitations, e.g. dynamic loading [14, 55]. The general application of this approach 
26 

II. Deformation 
is restricted to the linear range of response. The theory has been extended into the 
non-linear range [14d], it has also been adapted to account for limited changes in 
the structure and/or of the orientation of the stressed system [l4e]. In the context 
of this book use will be made of the established results of the phenomenological 
theory as well as of the "molecular theory" of viscoelasticity [55-57], particularly 
of the molecular friction coefficient introduced in it. 
B. Molecular Description 
A kinetic theory of fracture intends to interrelate the motion and response of mole-
cules to the ultimate properties of a stressed sample. A kinetic theory, therefore, 
entails a molecular description of the deformation of the microscopically hetero-
geneous and anisotropic aggregates of chains to such an extent that critical defor-
mation processes can be identified. The macroscopic deformation of any aggregate 
potentially involves the deformation, displacement, and/or reorientation of so dif-
ferent substructural elements as bond vectors, chain segments or crystal lamellae. 
The molecular origin of observed deformation mechanisms have been elucidated 
by various spectroscopic methods - including mechanical relaxation spectroscopy -
and by the previously listed tools which characterize the morphology. They are 
supplemented by dynamic scattering and diffraction techniques [52, 53]. 
The following molecular description of the uniaxial straining of unoriented 
semicrystalline polyethylene characterizes the ductile deformation of fiber-forming 
spherulitic thermoplastics and may serve to illustrate the large variety of deforma-
tion mechanisms involved. At small strains of less than one per cent one observes 
the anisotropic elastic response of the (orthorhombiC) PE crystallites [57] and of 
the amorphous material [53]. At the same time those anelastic deformations of 
CH2-groups and chain segments occur that characterize the low temperature (3-, 'Y-, 
and o-relaxation mechanisms [10,56]. At larger strains (1 to 5 per cent) additional 
chain segments change their relative position and conformational changes are ini-
tiated (bond rotation). A detailed study on the behavior of the chains within amor-
phous regions had been carried out by Petraccone et al. [53]. In crystalline regions 
subjected to strains of this order, dislocations and dislocation networks are generated 
(in lamellar crystals observed by means of moire patterns). Depending on environ-
mental parameters and the type of the dislocations their movement leads to crystal 
plastic deformation through twinning or slip or to a phase transformation from the 
orthorhombic to a monoclinic unit cell. An extensive review on the deformation 
behavior of polymer single crystals has recently been given by Sauer et al. [57] and 
in the book of Wunderlich [3]; a detailed account of the contribution of the various 
structural elements and defects to the deformation of semicrystalline polymers is 
found in the literature in a large number of papers of which only a few have been 
cited here [47-62]. Although the above mentioned effects lead to a non-linear stress-
strain response, the initially present substructure is still maintained. Such a defor-
mation is called homogeneous. 
Still larger stresses cause a destruction of the substructure, involving reorienta-
tion of chain segments and of lamellar crystals (crystal rotation, chain tilt and slip), 
27 

2. Structure and Deformation 
opening-up of voids, and the first breakages of chains take place. These processes 
account for the ductile deformation. At this stage the mechanical energy input is 
largely dissipated as heat as shown in later Chapters. Since the deformation proceeds 
at an almost constant level of engineering stress it has generally been termed plastic 
deformation - although on a molecular basis it does not correspond to the plastic 
deformation of metals. The initial post-yield deformation of PE is predominantly 
not brought about by mechanically irreversible flow. In a strain region of up to 
about 50 per cent the lamellar crystals slip and/or orient their a-axes perpendicular 
to the draw direction. The c-axes (chain axes) resume a preferred angle of 35 to 40° 
with respect to the draw direction. The latter orientation, however, is reversible and 
changes into a random distribution if external stresses are removed [61]. In a strain 
region of between 100 and 400 per cent an increasing c-axis orientation in the draw 
direction is observed. In this strain region the polymer undergoes the important 
transition from a spherulitic to a fibrillar structure. According to Peterlin [62] micro-
fibrils with lateral dimensions of 20 to 40 nm are formed which contain nearly un-
modified blocks of folded chains broken away from crystal lamellae but still inter-
connected by unfolded sections of tie molecules. A model of the fibrillar structure 
of a highly drawn fiber is shown in Fig. 2.l1. The originally random distribution of

chain segments and crystal blocks has become highly oriented. The load carrying 
capability of such a structure is - as will be studied in considerable detail - many 
times larger than that of the unoriented, spherulitic sample. 
The described molecular deformation processes affect the macroscopic fracture 
behavior of a given high polymer. The relative magnitude of the deformation com-
pletely determines:

the level of stress and strain to be attained in "homogeneous" deformation 
the volume density of elastically stored energy 
the rates of energy dissipation and local heating 
network reorientation and possible strain hardening 
chain scission, void formation, and other forms of structural weakening.

III. Model Representation of Deformation 
For the interpretation of the complex mechanical response of a highly anisotropic 
polymeric network it is indispensable to have a simplifying model representation 
of the arrangement and interaction of the structural elements and of their deforma-
tion. Such model representations will be useful in the further investigations which 
necessarily focus on some aspects while averaging or neglecting a large number of 
others. In this section one would like to characterize the assumptions made on the 
geometry and mode of interaction of structural elements in basic theories of the 
deformation of a composite body. These theories had been developed to account 
for the behavior at small strains. They can be extended into theories of strength if 
and only if failure criteria are introduced which become effective within the range 
of validity of the particular deformation theory. 
There is a large body of literature on the purely elastic interaction of non-pris-
matic structural elements within a deformed "composite" solid (e.g. 63-70); this 
literature also forms part of the theoretical foundation of the behavior of viscoelastic 
composite solids. While not generally discussing these foundations three groups of 
model descriptions of multi-phase materials will be singled out: 
those of Voigt [63], Reuss [64], or Takayanagi [71] which assume a homogeneous 
distribution of strain or stress, 
the calculations of Kerner [65], Hashin [66], van der Poel [67], or Uemura et al. 
[72] which minimize the elastic energy of a system containing assumedly spheri-
cal inclusions, and 
the empirically modified models of Eilers [68], Guth [69], Mooney [70], and 
Nielsen [73] which are based on the original calculations of Einstein [74], where 
the disturbances of an elastic field in the vicinity of - and caused by - completely 
rigid, spherical inclusions is considered. 
It is to be investigated which chain properties are effectively recognized by 
these groups of model descriptions of polymer deformation. One knows that the 
semicrystalline samples discussed previously are poly crystalline solids containing 
dispersed amorphous regions with frequently ill-defined boundaries and equally ill-
defined interaction between amorphous and crystalline regions. In a direct approach 
Takayanagi [63] represented semicrystalline polymers by "diagrams" (Fig. 2.12) in-
volving straight boundaries and conditions of plane stress or strain. He obtained a 
t stress

meaningful interpretation of the relative contributions of crystalline and amorphous 
phases to the complex moduli of these materials. The Takayanagi approach can well 
accomodate information on the deformation behavior of individual crystalline [57] 
or amorphous regions [53] that becomes available from other sources. In the analysis 
of e.g. the response of a fiber to dynamic loading through a Takayanagi diagram the 
nature of chain segment orientation is considered in detail but likely distributions 
of chain length and axial chain stresses do not enter the model. 
The two-shell model of Kerner [65] conforms to the conditions of the second 
group of models. The dilatation of a spherical inclusion surrounded by a homo-
geneous medium is derived subject to the condition that displacements and tractions 
at the surface of the inclusion are continuous. The homogeneous medium is supposed 
to have the elastic properties of the composite as a whole. The model interrelates 
shear (Gj ) and compressive (Kj) moduli (or Poisson's ratios Vj) of an arbitrary num-
ber of isotropic elements with the macroscopic moduli Gc and Kc. 
In the case of isotropic inclusions of an elastic shear modulus Gf comparable to 
that of the matrix, Gm , Eq. (2.5) describes the variation of the complex shear 
modulus, G~, of the composite as a function of the volume content Vf of the dis-
crete phase: 
G~= 
(l-Vr)G~+(a+Vf)Gf 
G~ (1 +aVr)G~ +a(l-Vf)Gf 
(2.5) 
The quantity a is derived from the Poisson's ratio vm as: 
(2 .6) 
As will be noted no molecular anisotropies and no effects due to size and size 
distribution of the particles of the discrete phase are recognized. Through 
E* = 2(1 + v)G* Eq. (2.5) can be used to predict also the complex tensile modulus. 
A good example for the applicability of Eq. (2.5) is furnished by the experimental 
data obtained by Dickie et al. [75]. For the dynamic tensile modulus of a physical 
mixture (polymer blend) of 75% by weight polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA, con-
tinuous phase) and 25% butylacrylate (PBA, discrete phase) within experimental 
error correspondence of calculated and measured data was obtained (Fig. 2.13,

solid curves). A copolymer of equal volumetric composition, where 25% by volume 
of the elastomeric butylacrylate had been grafted onto PMMA, yielded the experi-
mental data points shown. In the region between the glass transition temperatures 
of the PBA (-20°C) and of the PMMA (at these conditions 160°C) a difference 
between the response of the mixture and of the graft copolymer can be observed. 
This difference can be related to the existence of the primary bonds which connect 
matrix and inclusion and which lead to frozen-in stresses. 
A three-shell model of a two-phase solid was proposed by van der Poel ([67], 
Fig. 2.14). An interior sphere representing a hard component (Gf , Kf , Vf ) is sur-
rounded by a soft shell (Ga, Ka , Va), and by a continuum, for which the elastic

moduli G and K are being calculated in terms of the mentioned elastic constants 
and of the volume concentration (Vf ) of the hard component. The condition of 
mechanical equilibrium under shear and hydrostatic pressure leads to an explicit 
expression for K and to a complicated determinant for G which has to be solved 
numerically and for each individual system. The van der Poel approach had yielded 
the best results in describing the elasticity of elastomers highly filled (up to 50 vol.%) 
with mineral fillers (see e.g. [77]). Again no orientation distributions or physical an-
isotropies of the constituent particles enter the model. 
As mentioned frequently the mechanical and optical response of molecules -
and of their crystallites - is highly anisotropic. Depending on the property under 
consideration the carriers of the molecular anisotropy are the bond vectors (infra-
red dichroism), chain segments (optical and mechanical anisotropy), or the end-to-
end vectors of chains (rubber elastic properties). For the representation of the ensu-
ing macroscopic anisotropies one has to recognize, therefore, the molecular aniso-
tropy and the orientation distribution of the anisotropic molecular units (Fig. 1.9.). 
Since these are essentially one-dimensional elements their distribution and orienta-
tion behavior can be treated as that of rods; such a model had been used successfully 
to explain the optical anisotropy [78], and the anisotropies of thermal conductivity 
[79], thermal expansion or linear compressibility [80], and Young's modulus [59, 
65,80,81] of rubbers and oriented thermoplastics. The rod models focus on the 
large anisotropies which exhibit properties such as the polarizability or the retractive 
31 

2. Structure and Deformation 
elastic forces; only two components of such a property, namely that in chain axis 
direction and that perpendicular to it enter the model as independent parameters. 
For example the macroscopic elastic response of an aggregate of randomly, 
partly, or well oriented chains can be represented by that of a corresponding dis-
tribution of one-dimensional finite elements (Fig. 2.15) if the following conditions 
are fulfilled: 
p 
external forces P cause a homogeneous local strain which determines the axial 
stress 1/1 ({), I.{J, t) of a chain segment 
forces between chains are not transferred by shear or bending moments 
the state of stress at any arbitrary point A is given as the integral over all the 
traction forces exerted by the chain segments intersecting the surface of a volume 
element enclosing the point A [82]. 
Fig. 2.15. Application of the condition of homogeneoLls strain E (P, t) to a partially oriented 
system of finite, one-dimensional elements. The stress tensor ajj is obtained by space averaging 
over the traction vectors 'It ({), <p, t). 
The components of stress of such a homogeneously strained, partly oriented 
aggregate of elastic elements with axial Modulus Eb length L, volume concentration 
A, and orientation distribution p was derived by Hsiao [82] as a special case of the 
Voigt-model employing a homogeneous distribution of strain: 
(2.7) 
Here the summation convention of repeated indices is used. The Sj are the com-
ponents of the unit vector in the principal axis directions and w the solid angle. Into 
this model only one molecular elastic component enters: the axial chain modulus. 
Any interactions by shear or in a direction perpendicular to the chain axes cannot 
be accounted for. It should only be applied, therefore, if these interactions can be 
meaningfully neglected. 
A much more general representation of either different or differently oriented 
molecular domains can be achieved, of course, through three-dimensional elements. 
In the case of transverse symmetry the molecular elements must be characterized 
32 

III. Model Representation of Deformation 
by 5 elastic constants (compliances), the orientation of one or two axes, and the 
condition of stress and strain at the boundary of an element. Voigt [63] based his 
calculations on the assumption that there be no discontinous change of strain at 
any boundary; Reuss [64] made the assumption of homogeneous stress. Following 
either Voigt or Reuss the space averaging over the elastic constants Cijmn or elastic 
compliances sijmn of the molecular domains leads to the upper or lower bound res-
pectively of the macroscopic moduli [83]. For an affinely deforming aggregate of 
such elements Ward [84] and later Kausch [85] have calculated the macroscopic 
elastic moduli as a function of domain orientation. The calculated curves for the 
change of the elastic moduli with draw ratio are particularly characterized by the 
rate of change and by the extent of change ultimately attained. If only reorienta-
tion of otherwise unchanged molecular domains occurs in drawing, the properties 
of a "completely" oriented sample must correspond to the properties of the mole-
cular domains. In Figure 2.16 the calculated changes of Young's modulus in the direc-

tion of draw as a function of draw ratio and domain anisotropy are represented in 
comparison to experimental data [13, 85]. The findings of Ward and Kausch may 
be summarized by saying: 
the orientation behavior of amorphous thermoplastics (PS, PMMA, PVC) could 
be represented by the affine deformation of oriented domains 
the observed data for PS, PMMA, and PVC were in agreement with the assump-
tion of homogeneous stress at the boundaries of the orienting domains, the data 
for PC were better in agreement with a condition of homogeneous strain 
the orienting molecular domains have comparatively small elastic anisotropies 
(S3333/S1111 -values ranging from 0.5 to 1), the axial compliances being more 
than an order of magnitude larger than those of the chains; this indicates that 
33 

the domains are not equivalent to chains, micro-crystallites, or fringe micelles; 
if such domains do have a physical significance in amorphous polymers then they 
must be considered to be aggregates of chain segments with a stiffness about twice 
as large as that of the sample as a whole [13] 
- the concept of a/finely orienting lamellae in semicrystalline polymers is only a 
crude approximation [13, 87-89, 106]. 
The mathematical representation of the elastic behavior of oriented hetero-
geneous solids can be somewhat improved through a more appropriate choice of the 
boundary conditions such as proposed by Hashin and Shtrikman [66] and Stern-
stein and Lederle [86]. In the case of lamellar polymers the formalisms developed 
for reinforced materials are quite useful [87-88]. An extensive review on the experi-
mental characterization of the anisotropic and non-linear viscoelastic behavior of 
solid polymers and of their model interpretation had been given by Hadley and Ward 
[89]. New descriptions of polymer structure and deformation derive from the con-
cept of paracrystalline domains particularly proposed by Hosemann [9, 90] and 
Bonart [90], from a thermodynamic treatment of defect concentrations in bundles 
of chains according to the kink and meander model of Pechhold [10-11], and from 
the continuum mechanical analysis developed by Anthony and Kroner [14g, 99]. 
The theory of paracrystals recognized that chain molecules form three-dimen-
sionallattices and establish a certain long range order between members of the same 
lattice while postulating at the same time that in a real solid the lattice will be dis-
torted. The degree of lattice distortion is measured by the variation in length that 
the three distance vectors ai between corresponding lattice points encounter if moved 
in the three lattice directions. If the dimensionless relative mean fluctuations gik of 
the distance vectors 3j are all zero the structure is crystalline and if all gik > 0.1 it 
is amorphous. The gik provide a quantitative measure of the colloidal structure of 
micro heterogeneous solids. If for instance g13 and g23 are large compared with the 
other gik we deal with the nematic state (segments parallel but at random distances), 
if g31 and g32 are large compared with the other gik we have a smectic state where 
the segments arrange in layers [9]. The relative paracrystalline distance fluctuation 
was shown to be inversely related to the maximum number of network planes within 
one microdomain [9]. The gik are obtained from line profile measurements in small 
angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). 
Hosemann's schematic representation of a two-dimensional paracrystalline lattice 
is given in Figure 2.17. If we interpret a superstructure (e.g. the fibrillar structure 
shown in Figure 2.11) in terms of paracrystals rather than crystals we arrive at the 
very same size and orientation distribution of the scattering elements - be they 
crystallites or paracrystals. The differences in interpretation become apparent, how-
ever, if intercrystalline rearrangements in annealing, during deformation, or after 
irradiation are discussed [9]. 
The general concept that there are only gradual differences between the more 
or less ordered regions of polymers is also employed by Pechhold and his co-workers 
in their quantitative microstructural theory (Kinkenmodell) of deformation [10, 
11, 14f]. Pechhold recognizes that chain molecules exist in energetically different 
states of rotational isomers between which - cooperative and mostly rapid - tran-
sitions can be accomplished. He bases his quantitative thermodynamical calculations

on kink isomers, which show only a small departure from the extended planar chain 
and are most likely to form bundles ([ 11], Fig. 2.18 a). The neighbouring chains with-
in such bundle form various pairs of segments (cf. Fig. 1.12) which have different 
volumes, axial lengths and interaction energies. The concentration of kinks deter-
mines the axial extension of the bundle. In the partition function of a bundle of 
chains all these quantities enter; the partition function relates, therefore, the kink

concentration with bundle geometry and internal and free energy of the isomers. 
Consequently the elastic compliances of a transversely isotropic bundle of chains 
could be determined as a function of kink concentration, kink block size, width of 
kink steps, and temperature [10,11, 14f]. The anelastic and plastic deformation 
may be interpreted in terms of successive dislocation motion and slip of bundle sur-
face areas. The kink model offers in every respect a molecular description of poly-
mer structure. Again there are only gradual differences between ordered and non-
ordered regions. Pechhold estimates that an apparently perfect PE-crystallite may 
contain up to 4 kinks per 1000 CH2 -groups whereas in a melt-like structure this con-
centration is about 200 in 1000. Although this concentration is so large as to an-
nihilate all close and long range order some logical principles should govern the space 
filling through chain molecules. Pechhold generated appropriate patterns, the honey-
comb- and the meander model (Fig. 2.1 c). He feels that the latter structure is the 
more probable one and may exist in semi-crystalline fibers (Fig. 2.18 b) as well as 
in rubbers [11, 14f]. The previously mentioned a, (3 and 'Y relaxations are interpreted 
in terms of the above model as the motion of kink-blocks, as freezing-in of segment 
rotation because of lack of free volume, and as the steps and jumps of kinks in the 
amorphous and crystalline regions respectively lll]. Although meanwhile the neu-
tron scattering experiments [100-104] strongly disprove the existence of a distinct 
meander arrangement of chains, Pechhold's considerations have greatly fertilized the 
efforts to study the structure of amorphous regions. 
The close geometrical description of the arrangement of chain molecules within 
bundles offered by the kink-model have been used by Kroner and Anthony [14g, 
99] to develop a quantitative non-linear deformation theory based on the structure 
defect "disclination". The meander model, then, is reduced to a particular arrange-
ment of disclinations.

With regard to the elucidation of phenomena occurring during crack propaga-
tion in polymers it is generally not necessary to consider intracrystalline processes in 
detail. If, however, the intracrystalline segments of tie molecules are concerned then 
one has to be aware of the fact that the intermolecular interaction determines what 
forces can be transmitted onto these chain segments and whether or not these forces 
are large enough to cause chain scission. 
Thus far model representations of polymer deformation have been discussed. 
Each of those could be converted into a model representing the fracture behavior 
if it were possible to formulate an adequate fracture criterion within the range of 
validity of these models. Having dealt with deformation the fracture criteria to be 
formulated would have to involve finite extensibility, critical load, or limited volume 
concentration of stored or dissipated energy. Dealing with fracture one will find 
that strain, stress, and energy are not sufficient as variables and that one will have 
to add at least two new dimensions: time and structural discontinuity. This will be 
explained in the following Chapter.

Test specimens loaded under laboratory conditions, but also regular engineering com-
ponents fracturing in service, provide many different data which lend themselves to 
evaluation of the fracture process. These data are, for instance, the time to onset 
and completion of fracture, details of the fracture pattern (ductile or brittle frac-
ture, appearance of the breaking specimen and of the fracture surface), crack dynam-
ics, and change in physical or chemical properties. Naturally the most straight-
forward evaluation of a test or a set of data is the direct correlation of the property 
of interest (e.g., time under stress) to the environmental parameter(s) of interest 
(e.g., stress and temperature). In Figure 1.4 a set of data with just these variables has 
been plotted (PVC pipes under internal pressure). If one uses such a plot a number 
of questions arise: 
40 
what is the statistical significance of an individual data point 
what are the failure conditions and how do they depend on external parameters 
and material properties 
what is the likely cause of failure 
what conclusions can be drawn with respect to extrapolating the set of curves 
into hitherto non-accessible regions of time, pressure, or temperature? 

II. Statistical Aspects 
The first of these points will be commented upon subsequently in connection 
with an interpretation of the statistical variability of fracture events. To answer 
this and the second question the highly developed tools of statistical analysis (e.g., 
1-2) are available; their application forms a backbone of industrial quality control 
and material design. Understandably, the complex input (mechanical, thermal, and 
environmental attack) acting upon a complex system (e. g., a highly structured 
polymer) has a complex, non-deterministic output. The determination and evaluation 
of only a small number of different data will necessarily reveal only a partial aspect 
of the fracture process. For this reason the questions as to cause and kinetics of 
fracture development can rarely be answered unambiguously. Any mathematical 
interrelations established between variables (e.g., time and stress) are valid for ex-
trapolation only if the basis does not change. 
In this chapter an overview of conceptually different fracture theories is pre-
sented which have in common that they do not make explicite reference to the 
characteristic properties of the molecular chains, their configurational and super-
molecular order and their thermal and mechanical interaction. This will be seen 
to apply to the classical failure criteria and general continuum mechanical models. 
Rate process fracture theories take into consideration the viscoelastic behavior of 
polymeric materials but do not derive their fracture criteria from detailed mor-
phological analysis. These basic theories are invaluable, however, to elucidate 
statistical, non-morphological, or continuum mechanical aspects of the fracture 
process. 
II. Statistical Aspects 
Experimentally determined quantities (observables) such as strength, time to frac-
ture, or concentration of free radicals show a wide scatter of values; they are sto-
chastic variables. As an extreme example of a stochastic variable in Figure 3.1 the 
service lives t of 500 HDPE-tubes under identical test conditions are plotted in the 
form of a histogram [3]. The distribution shown can be represented by a logarithmic 
normal distribution (Fig. 3.2) with a mean oflg t/h equal to 2.3937 and a variance 
of s = 0.3043. The expectation value of the time to fracture of a specimen subject 
to the test condition employed is the time which corresponds to the mean value of 
the (logarithmic) distribution, here 247.6 h. The actually determined values of t 
evidently scatter widely around this expectation value. Nevertheless even such a 
distribution can be characterized by testing just a few randomly selected specimens. 
For a normally distributed observable any three random values cover on the average 
a range of 1.69 s - which contains in 86% of all cases the mean value of the (in-
finite) distribution also [3]. This extreme example has been chosen to emphasize the 
meaning of stochastic variables with which one is dealing subsequently. It was also 
intended to show the Significance of small samples - containing 3 to 10 members 
- which are generally used in practice to establish correlations between stochastic 
variables and environmental or material parameters. At this point we are not going 
to talk further about the statistical reduction of such a set of data. Here we are in-
terested in the information which may be drawn from such a statistical analysis.

Lifetime 
Fig. 3.2. Cumulative normal distribution of the logarithms of the lifetimes plotted in Fig. 3.1. 
From a statistical standpoint, the variability of a material property, e.g., frac-
ture strength, is explained by referring to one or more of the following three ar-
guments: 
1. The beginning of fracture is a statistical event, the occurrence of which is de-
scribed by probability laws. 
2. Apparently identical specimens of a set are inherently different, e.g., they contain a 
large number of flaws of different size or severeness and the most severe of these 
flaws determines the fracture strength. 
3. The load to which a sample is subjected until it fractures activates a large 
number of molecular processes. The uncertainty of the cumulative event, e.g., mac-
42 

II. Statistical Aspects 
roscopic failure, then results from the uncertainty of the molceular events and the 
mode of correlation of these events. 
The first argument (fracture is a statistical event) would lead to the following 
general equation for the rate of change of the number N of members belonging to 
one ensemble: 
dN/dt=-NK 
(3.1) 
where K may be a function of N, stress, stress history, temperature, or other en-
vironmental parameters. For a number N of statistically equal, independent and 
separately loaded units the rate function Kin Eq. (3.1) is independent of N, but 
generally a function of time. Equation (3.1) is readily solved with respect to the 
number N(t) of surviving units: 
N(t)::: Noexp [ - ~ K(r) dr] 
(3.2) 
where No is their initial number. The fraction of units broken after some time tb 
is obviously 1 - N(tb)/No and the cumulative distribution function of lifetimes, 
Q(tb), therefore is: 
Q(tb) =1 - exp [ -? K(r) dr ] . 
(3.3) 
The average lifetime, < tb >, is solely determined by K and becomes for constant K: 
< tb > = NI ; tNoK exp (-Kt) dt = K- 1 . 
o 0 
(3.4) 
It may be noted that in this case the life expectancy of a surviving unit is at any 
time independent of Nand t. This is equivalent to the assumption that the residual 
strength is equal to the initial strength, i.e., that no aging or deterioration has taken 
place in the stressed sample. The rate K of failure occurrence can be determined 
experimentally from the scatter of tb [4]. Using this assumption Kawabata and 
Blatz [5] developed a simple stochastic theory of creep failure. They argued that the 
first moments of tb for an ensemble of ruptured specimens should reveal whether 
or not K is independent of time. If K depends only on initial load and is independent 
of N the equation 
K::: (m!/< t: »l/m 
(3.5) 
should hold for any m, that is for any order of moments of tb' An investigation of 
the variability of fracture times in the special case of a rubber vulcanizate gave ex-
cellent agreement with the assumption of a time-independent K as used in Eq. (3.4). 
43 

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
The same conclusion was drawn by Narisawa et al. [82] from the exponential decrease 
ofN(t) with t of uniaxially stressed PA 6 monofIlaments. 
In other experiments Kawabata et al. [6] investigated the failure statistics of 
carbon-filled styrene butadien rubber (SBR). They arrived at the conclusion that 
either the coefficient relating stress and rate of failure is increasing with time or 
that several local fracture events must be independently initiated before the rubber 
specimen breaks. The best fit of their theory with experiments was obtained for a 
critical number of 3 to 4 microscopic fracture events as nucleus for unstable crack 
formation. For the asymmetric distribution of times-to-fracture shown in Figure 3.2 
the relation Eq. (3.5) is also not valid for higher orders of m (m equal to or larger 
than two). This means either that the probability density K for pipe failure is smaller 
for specimens having a longer service life or that K is a function of loading time. In 
the first case it must be assumed that from the beginning the specimens had not 
been statistically identical, in the second that they underwent structural changes 
affecting K. The first assumption seems to be valid for pipe failure through creep 
crack development. The investigations of Stockmayer [83] recently have shown that 
nature and location of material inhomogeneities largely determine the creep lives 
tb of LDPE pipes. Morphological parameters thus account for more than half of 
< t% > [84]. The conclusion that structural differences exist and affect K must be 
drawn for other materials as well which exhibit a log-normal distribution of tb values 
[3, 83-85]. These aspects will have to be discussed in later sections in terms of 
detailed structural models of the failing specimens. 
Without reference to any such models and based purely on statistical considera-
tions, Coleman and Marquardt developed their important theory of breaking kinetics 
of fibers (reviewed in ref. 7). They especially investigated the distribution of life-
times of fibers under constant or periodic load and the effects of fiber length, rate 
of loading, and bundle size on the strength of fIlaments or bundles thereof (Figs. 
3.3 and 3.4). Two statistical effects should be noted: the lower strength of a bundle 
as compared with that of a monofIlament (due to the accelerating increase in failure 
probability K after rupture of the first fIlament within a bundle) and the increase of 
strength with loading rate here derived from the reduced time each fIlament spends 
at each load level. The authors [8] determined the average tensile strengths of 
15-denier 66 nylon monofIls and that of an infinite bundle; the strength values are 
plotted as a function of loading rate in Figure 3.3. 
As mentioned above the large scatter of strengths and the dependency on sample 
geometry may be explained by introducing the concept of flaws of different degrees 
of severity. This means substituting one statistical variable (e.g., underlying strength) 
for another one (e.g., macroscopic strength or time to failure). Even though such a 
substitution leaves the nature of the microscopic defects out of consideration, it 
still allows one to obtain, from statistical analysis, some information on the size, 
number, location, and severity of these defects (or flaws). The term flaw needs some 
deliberation. First, a flaw can be considered as an ellipsoidaUy shaped void which 
may act as a stress concentrator and as the eventual cause of instability and failure. 
Secondly, it should also be understood as a weak region containing molecular irregu-
larities. When being stressed the weak region may fail, leading to a void, a craze, 
and/or to a propagating crack and macroscopic failure. Following Epstein's statistical

theory of extreme values [9] the strength of a material volume element depends on

The macroscopic strength distribution gel, x) of fibers of different length L but 
uniform cross section can then be expressed as 
45 

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
x 
gel, x) = Lnof(x)[1 - f f(y)dy]LnO-l 
(3.6) 
where no is the number of flaws per unit length of fiber and f(x) the underlying 
strength distribution. For f(x) being a Gaussian distribution with mean f.1 and 
variance v, the most probable strength, a* , depends on Lno as shown by the solid 
line (theory) in Figure 3.4. Also plotted are the experimental data of Levin and Savi-
ckij [10]. Even though it appears as if the experimental data would be fitted by 
the theoretical curve in the range of 103 < Lno < 106 , some caution is required. 
If indeed the inherent distribution of flaws is a Gaussian distribution, then the 
decrease of a*(Lno) with L and the variance of a(Lno) are both related to v and 
n(= Lno) in a known manner and subject to proof. A proof is also possible for other 
underlying distributions. For the data of Levin and Savickij [10] neither a Gaussian 
distribution of x, nor a Laplacian, nor a Weibull distribution describes a* (Lno) and 
v(Lno) simultaneously [11]. As a result of this analysis one may conclude that 
either the underlying distribution f(x) is truncated at the left-hand side (small values 
of x), or the variance of a is much larger than to be expected from the number of 
flaws. The truncation at small strength values could be caused by a multi-step crack 
initiation process which would require a certain time. The effect of sample volume 
on strength was also not in agreement with extreme value statistics for viscose fila-
ments, carbon fibers, and cotton yam [12]. Fedors and Landel [13] obtained a 
doubly exponential distribution of strength values for eight SPR gum Vllicanizates. 
Such a distribution derives, for example, from an underlying exponential distribu-
tion of flaw cross sections [14]. Here the volume effect was not studied. 
When dealing with underlying distributions it should be recognized that dif-
ferent regions (core, surface) of a (seemingly) homogeneous specimen may have 
different underlying distributions. Evidence of this behavior was for instance found 
in polyamide fibers [15] and LOPE pipes [84]. Depending on processing conditions 
volume-related and surface-related breakages with quite different stress-lifetime 
characteristics could be distinguished. At this point the many attempts to determine 
underlying distributions are not discussed any further but reference is made to the 
publications on this subject [11-17]. If any conclusion may be attempted from 
statistical investigations of uniaxial failure of thermoplastics it is that the underlying 
distribution, f(x), of natural flaws could be a Laplacian distribution possibly skewed 
at the left-hand side (small values of x). Moreover, it appears unlikely that a deter-
ministic view may be adopted associating a particular flaw with a particular strength 
(or time to failure) but rather necessary to allow for the uncertainty of multistep 
flaw growth. 
The third statistical argument (fracture as the result of a large number of molecu-
lar processes) is very old. Its application to polymers definitely was stimulated from 
many sides including fracture and fatigue of metals [4] or glasses [17] and the ther-
modynamics ofreactions [19]. The interpretation of fracture as a sequence of in-
dividual steps will be mainly used in the following. It necessitates a consideration 
of the correlation of such steps and of the final failure criterion. 
The discussion of the three different statistical arguments can be summarized 
by saying that in the first case (fracture as a statistical event) a property (probability 
46 

III. Continuum and Fracture Mechanics Approach 
of fracture) is attached to the material body as a whole. In the second case one 
flaw, i.e., one micro-heterogeneity (out of many), within the body is considered 
to dominate failure; in the third case many events interact, influence, and determine 
each other. The very same lines of thought used here to explain the variability of 
strength,for example, are found in the continuum mechanics, fracture mechanics, 
and molecular approach to theories of strength, respectively.

In classical continuum mechanics homogeneous isotropic materials are taken into 
consideration. Failure criteria are established on the basis that there is indeed one 
strategic material property such as uniaxial tensile strength, shear strength, elastic 
or total extensibility, or energy storage capability that determines the failure of 
the stressed sample. If, in establishing such criteria, all environmental parameters 
(e.g., temperature T, strain rate, e, or surrounding medium) are taken to be con-
stant, then failure has to be expected whenever the components of multiaxial stress 
- usually the three principal stresses 01, 02, and 03 are considered - combine in 
such a way that the strategic quantity reaches a critical value C. For different Tor 
e C may assume different values. The condition f(Ol, 02, 03) = C(T, e) represents 
a two-dimensional "failure surface" in three-dimensional stress space. The stable 
states of stress form a continuous body bounded by the failure surface against the 
unstable stress points. 
It has already been indicated that failure in polymeric materials may occur in 
a number of phenomenologically different ways, e.g., as brittle fracture through 
propagating cracks, as ductile fracture through plastic deformation following shear 
yielding, or as quasi-brittle fracture after normal-stress yielding (crazing). It had 
correctly been anticipated that these different phenomena respond differently to 
the magnitude and the state of stress. This means that for different fracture phe-
nomena separate failure surfaces exist which may overlap and penetrate each other. 
These facts are extensively investigated and discussed in the recent monograph by 
Ward [20] and in the general literature (e.g., 21-34). 
The classical criteria were conceived to describe the failure of isotropic, elastic-
plastic solids. The physical content of the six principal criteria is in brief the follow-
ing: 
1. The maximum principle stress theory (Rankine's theory) states that the largest 
principle stress component, 03, in the material determines failure regardless of the 
value of normal or shearing stresses. The stability criterion is formulated as 
(3.7) 
In this case 0* is considered a basic material property which can be determined 
from, for example, a tension test. In stress space the surface of failure according to 
47 

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
the maximum stress theory is a cube. A modified form of this theory allows for a 
larger critical value a* if one of the stresses is compressive. Then the surface of failure 
is a cube again, but with the center displaced from origin. 
2. The maximum elastic strain theory (St. Venant's theory) states that incep-
tion of failure is due if the largest local strain, €3, within the material exceeds some-
where a critical value €*. The failure criterion, therefore, is derived as 
(3.8) 
where E is the isotropic Young's modulus and v Poisson's ratio. The term in square 
brackets thus has to be smaller than an equivalent stress, a*. 
3. The theory of total elastic energy of deformation was first proposed by Bel-
trami. Since under high hydrostatic pressure large amounts of elastic energy may be 
stored without causing either fracture or permanent deformation, the elastic energy 
as such seems to have no significance as a limiting condition. 
4. Theory of constant elastic strain energy of distortion (Huber, v. Mises, Hen-
cky). The consideration of the poor significance of the elastically stored energy in 
hydrostatic compression or tension led to the idea of subtracting the "hydrostatic:' 
part of the energy from the total amount of elastically stored energy. Thus, it is 
assumed that only the energy of distortion, W, determines the criticality of a state 
of stress. For small deformations one obtains: 
16+Ev W =[(01 - a2)2 + (a2 - a3)2 + (a3 - al)2] <2(a*)2. 
(3.9) 
5. If a limiting octahedral shearing stress, T*, is postulated as a failure criterion 
the same mathematical expression as in Eq. (3.9) is obtained with 
(3.1 0) 
In this case the limiting condition of small deformations does not pertain. 
6. The Coulomb yield criterion states that the critical stress, T*, for shear de-
formation to occur in any plane increases linearly with the pressure, an, applied 
normally to that plane: 
(3.11) 
Here the material constant TO is given by the cohesion of the material and /1 is 
a "coefficient of friction". If friction is neglected the Tresca yield criterion is ob-
tained. 
The above failure (or stability) criteria do not explicitly contain time as a 
variable. One may apply them to rate sensitive materials, however, if one recognizes 
that 0* and T* will depend on stress history. The classical approach of Eyring and 
other rate theories will be discussed in Section IV of this chapter. The limits of the 
applicability of the classical criteria and of their extension to anisotropic materials 
are analyzed by Ward [20]. Also in recent years numerous papers (e.g., 21-28) 
48 

III. Continuum and Fracture Mechanics Approach 
and review articles [29-34] have appeared which concern the geometry of failure 
surfaces of polymeric materials. Multiaxial failure experiments on elastomers which 
seem to corroborate the St. Venant criterion have been carried out [21] by Gent 
and Lindley on endbonded penny-shaped samples of a natural rubber gum vulca-
nizate, by Ko on polyurethan rubber, by Oberth and Bruenner on castable elastomers 
containing solid inclusions, and by Lim [22] on tubular samples of polyurethane 
and of a butadiene/acrylic acid copolymer. Figure 3.5 depicts Lim's data and a 
failure envelope for v = 0.37 resulting from the St. Venant criterion .

Of the other theories, the Huber-v. Mises-Hencky criterion and the Coulomb 
yield criterion have received the most experimental support. The failure surface in 
the stress space described by Eq. (3.9) is a cylinder with its axis along the space 
diagonal. Traces of this cylinder with the (01, 02)-plane are ellipses symmetric with 
respect to the point of origin. One such ellipse is shown in Figure 3.5. The failure sur-
face corresponding to the Coulomb criterion is a cone. Its traces with the (a 1 , 02)-
plane are also ellipses but displaced with regard to the origin. Elliptic traces seem 
to form the best available failure criterion in the biaxial yielding experiments with 
tubular specimens ofPMMA [23, 33], PVC [26,27], PC [27] and ofPS, PE, PP, PA, 
ABS, and CAB [33]. In the case of multi axial fracture without yielding (Trenn-
bruch) elliptic and parabolic traces are obtained which pertain to a cone or a para-
boloide in stress space [30, 33]. In any event there is no strict distinction between 
the form of failure surfaces describing failure through flow and the form of the sur-
faces referring to failure through material separation (brittle fracture). This indicates 
that in these isotropic polymers the initiation of failure was strongly influenced by 
shear stresses irrespective of the ultimate material behavior. No unique 0* or f*

proved to be a critical quantity in the experiments of Dickie and Smith [25] on the 
fracture of SBR in equal biaxial tension and of Dong [28] on a highly filled fluor 
elastomer (Viton ®). 
More recently there has been a strong interest in the deformation and fracture 
behavior of plastics under large hydrostatic pressures [31-32]. One should expect 
- and one observes - that the rigidity of a polymer increases with pressure. Sauer 
et al. [32] report that a pressure of 3.5 kbar raises the initial Young's moduli of 
amorphous thermoplastics (PC, PI, PSU, PVC, CA) by a factor of 1.2 to 1.9, that 
of crystalline polymers by 1.4 (POM) to 7.5 (PUR). Despite the increased rigidity, 
ductile fracture occurs. The effects are not yet understood in all generality. Follow-
ing the two major review articles on this subject by Radcliffe [31] and Sauer and 
Pae [32] the Coulomb criterion corresponds best to most pressure-yield experiments. 
In the case of PTFE and PC with their nonlinear increase of yield strength with 
hydrostatic pressure (an = p) even the consideration of a second-order term of p 
appeared to be necessary [32]. Whereas the application of pressure restricts the cold 
drawing of many ductile polymers, it enables yielding of normally brittle polymers, 
e.g., of PS at room temperature at a pressure of 2 to 3 kbar, and of PSU and polyimides 
at 3 to 7 kbar [32]. 
In this chapter no molecular interpretations of fracture phenomena are given. 
The above discussion has already shown, however, that a consideration of the three-
dimensional state of stress is not sufficient to elucidate the possible role of chain 
scission or disentanglement in failure of polymers. This is particularly true if the 
phenomenon of crazing ("normal stress yielding") is included. Before investigating 
the molecular aspects, however, in the later chapters, the presentation of general, 
non-molecular fracture theories should be continued. 
B. Fracture Mechanics 
Real solids are inhomogeneous. Even if they are one-phase materials they will con-
tain defects, voids, inclusions, flaws, cracks, and/or other inhomogeneities which 
are able to distort an otherwise homogeneous stress field. A continuum mechanical 
approach that analyzes these (singular) stress-strain fields in the vicinity of flaws 
or cracks and derives its criteria of crack stability from an energy balance considera-
tion is the fracture mechanics approach. Griffith [35] was the first to find wide 
acclaim for his considerations of the energetic changes occurring as a consequence 
of the widening of a crack (of length 2a). He equated the resulting decrease dU of 
elastic energy stored within a stressed specimen with the surface energy 'YedA 
necessary to enlarge the crack by an infinitesimal area dA:

For a plate containing an elliptical hole and stressed at right angles to the major 
axis a, he obtained the stability criterion

III. Continuum and Fracture Mechanics Approach 
The size of the largest material defect together with the material constants 
modulus of elasticity (E) and surface work parameter (1 c), thus, supposedly deter-
mine the strength of the material, Le., that macroscopic value a* of uniaxial stress 
at which irreversible crack propagation begins. Equation (3.13) gives a mathematical 
form to the earlier used concept that flaw size (or severity) determines the inherent 
strength of a sample. It also explains that the actually observed macroscopic strength 
is much smaller than the theoretical strength of flawless specimens. 
The application of fracture mechanics to viscoelastic media is caught between 
the limitations that are brough about by the deviation from infinitesimal strain con-
dition, by molecular anisotropy, local concentration of strains, and the time depen-
dency of stress and strain functions. It has been notably successful in investigations 
of crack propagation. The analytical extension of Griffith's work to linearly vis-
coelastic materials has been reviewed by Williams [36] and more recently by Knauss 
[37]. In Chapter'9 a more detailed account on the application of fracture mechanics 
to crack propagation is given. There the morphological aspects and the effect of 
time-dependent plastic deformation, craze initiation and growth, and chain scission 
on the energy of cohesive fracture of high polymers will be considered. 
At this point attention will be drawn to an application of the Griffith approach 
to the effect of matrix orientation on strength. Such an interpretation has been 
forwarded by Mikitishin et al. [79] and Stemstein et al. [80]. These authors suggest 
that during the orientation process a rotation, elongation, and widening of possible 
defects takes place. The change of shape and orientation changes the effect of these 
flaws as stress concentrators. They become less dangerous in a direction parallel to 
the draw direction (z) and more critical in the perpendicular direction (x). If only 
the increase in length of (elliptical) voids which are oriented parallel to the draw 
direction is considered, the lateral strength ax is derived from Eq. (3.13) as: 
(3.14) 
where A is the draw ratio. Sternstein et al. [80] have made comprehensive calcula-
tions in two dimensions of the flaw-rotation and widening effect on axial and lateral 
strength for a statistical distribution of flaw orientations and various flaw geometries. 
They compare their predictions of the lateral strength of polystyrene with the ex-
perimental data of Retting [81]. For moderate molecular weights and draw ratios 
up to 1.5 they find a correspondence to within 20%. For higher molecular weights 
and larger draw ratios the discrepancies are above 70%. 
If a crack travels at the interface of an adhesive joint one observes an adhesive 
debonding rather than cohesive failure. Except for minor differences in boundary 
condition the analgy to the fracture mechanical treatment of cohesive failure is 
complete [38-40] and the normal debonding stress a: is obtained as: 
(3.13a) 
The interpretation of 1a and E is rather involved. These quantities not only 
depend on the static surface free energies and elastic moduli of the interacting 
(polymeric) materials but also on the work of deformation which the adhesive layer 
51 

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
undergoes in debonding and on the surface activity of a possible third phase having 
access to the debonded area [40]. 
C. Continuous Viscoelastic Models 
Under the heading of this section belongs the very fruitful model of a common 
"failure envelope" proposed by Smith [41] It is based on a consideration of the 
viscoelastic behavior of continuous high polymer bodies, i.e., on the concept that 
a reduction according to the time-temperature superposition principle of the en· 
vironmental parameters stress, strain-rate, and temperature should lead to corre-
sponding molecular states. If a fracture criterion refers indeed to unique limits of 
molecular load-carrying capability, for example, then the plotting of reduced stress 
at break versus strain at break for different experimental conditions should lead 
to one master curve, the failure envelope (Fig. 3.6). For a large number of natural 
and synthetic rubbers and vulcanizates under similar modes of mechanical excita· 
tion, this concept was found to hold. It thus generally allows the extrapolation of 
the ultimate behavior into unknown regimes of time, strain·rate, or temperature. This 
model, however, does not allow prediction of the shape of the fracture envelope or

IV. Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
the conversion of data obtained under different modes of excitation (uniaxial, 
equal biaxial, or other multiaxialloading). 
An argument to resolve the discrepancy between the failure envelopes obtained 
for different modes of straining is indicated by the work of Blatz, Sharda, and 
Tschoegl [42]. These authors have proposed a generalized strain energy function 
as constitutive equation of multi axial deformation. They incorporated more of the 
nonlinear behavior in the constitutive relation between the strain energy density and 
the strain. They were then able to describe simultaneously by four material con-
stants the stress-strain curves of natural rubber and of styrene-butadiene rubber in 
simple tension, simple compression or equibiaxial tension, pure shear, and simple 
shear. 
The continuous viscoelastic models discussed in this section make use of the 
theory of rubber elasticity and of the time-temperature superposition principle. 
They implicitly very well recognize the molecular origin of the viscoelastic behavior 
of a material - but explicitly they do not refer to noncontinuous quantities such 
as the discrete size, structure, and arrangement of molecules, the anisotropy of 
molecular properties, or the distribution of molecular stresses or stored strain energy. 
If individual molecular events or discontinuities of stress or strain are either not 
discernible or not of particular importance, a representation of a solid as a contin-
uum is quite adequate. 
IV. Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
A. Overview 
As opposed to the continuum mechanical theories, "molecular" rate process theo-
ries of fracture recognize the presence of discrete particles or elements forming 
the material body. Rate process theories intend to relate in a straightforward man-
ner breakage, displacement, and reformation of these elements to deformation, 
defect development, and fracture of the structured material. 
All theories of a first group to be described subsequently have in common the 
assumption that macroscopic failure is a rate process, that the basic fracture events 
are controlled by thermally activated breakages of secondary and/or primary bonds, 
and that the accumulation of these events leads to crack formation and/or to break-
down of the loaded sample. Here the basic events are defined in a general manner 
and not experimentally related to particular morphological changes. A second group 
of theories is based on the physical evidence of molecular damage obtained by 
spectroscopy and X-ray scattering methods it will be discussed in Chapters 7 and 
8. A third group of theories concerns the role of cracks and craze initiation and is 
treated in Chapter 9. 
One of the early applications of the theory given by Glasstone, Laidler, and 
Eyring [43] was the prediction of the flow and diffusion behavior of liquids. From 
the original concept of flow, the thermally activated jump of molecules across an 
energy barrier, various fracture theories of solids have emerged. Tobolsky and 
53 

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
Eyring [44] considered the general decrease of secondary bonds, Zhurkov [45-47] 
and Bueche [48-50] that of primary bonds to be the strength controlling factor. 
In their recent monographs on deformation and fracture of polymers Bartenev and 
Zuyev [51], Andrews [52], and Regel, Slutsker, and Tomashevskii [53] have re-
viewed a considerable amount of experimental data under this aspect; reference 
to their works should be made if information is sought on the effect of time and 
temperature on the fracture behavior of polymers of different composition and 
structure and under various environments. 
Following the earlier works of Eyring, Zhurkov, and Bueche, these and other 
authors have continued to develop different aspects of the kinetic theory of frac-
ture. Particularly in the USSR fracture data have been interpreted in terms of the 
failure of regular, nonmorphological model lattices (e.g., 54-58). Gubanov et al. 
[54], Bartenev [55], and Perepelkin [56] focussed on the potential energy of inter-
action between adjacent members of a polymer chain, Mikitishin et al. [57] on the 
defects introduced into the lattice by chain ends, and Dobrodumov [58] on the 
increase of the load and - consequently - of the rate of scission of bonds adjacent 
to a broken bond. 
Hsiao and Kausch [59 -61] studied the effect of orientation -dependent local 
strain on the total rate of chain scission. Holzmillier [62], Bartenevet al. [63], and 
Salganik [64] analyzed the amount of thermal energy and the direction of relative 
motion imparted by statistically fluctuating phonons to adjacent segments. Dif-
ferent statistical aspects of the accumulation of molecular defects were treated by 
Orlovet al. [65], Goikhman [66], and Gotlib [67] who simulated the isolated pro-
duction, growth, interaction, and coalescence of defects. An energy probability 
theory was forwarded by Valanis [68] who combined the role of strain energy den-
sity, the stochastic nature of fracture, and the fracture hypothesis of Zhurkov. 
Whereas all of the above theories [54-68] refer in one way or another to the 
thermally activated breakage of one kind of molecular bonds as primary fracture 
event, the Bueche-Halpin theory for the tensile strength of gum elastomers [69] 
employs the idea that the viscoelastic straining of rubber filaments together with 
the degree of their ultimate elongation determine the kinetics of crack propagation 
in an elastomeric solid. 
In the following the characteristic aspects of these generalized, nonmorphological 
rate process fracture theories are to be discussed, i.e. the nature of the basic fracture 
events, their distribution in space and time, the law of the accumulation of these 
events, and resulting fracture criteria. 
B. Eyring' Theory of Flow 
Flow of a liquid, melt, or solid is the result of a stress-biased thermodynamically 
irreversible displacement of molecules past each other. A molecule in thermal 
equilibrium with its surroundings is in thermal motion, which in the case of a liquid 
or solid is predominantly a vibration around a temporary equilibrium position. The 
amplitude of vibration is constantly changing. Eyring [43] postulated that a displace-
ment ( or jump) of a molecule from an initial to a neighboring equilibrium position 
54 

IV. Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
may occur if the thermal energy of the molecule is sufficient to reach the "activated" 
stage, i.e., the top of the energy barrier separating the initial and the final equilibrium 
positions. The rate of decay of activated states towards the final position was ob-
tained by him as 
kT 
ko = t<. h exp (-uo/kT) exp As/k. 
(3.15) 
Here t<. is the transmission constant which indicates how many of the activated 
complexes actually disintegrate, k is Boltzmann's, h Planck's, and R the gas con-
stant, T is absolute temperature, Uo the height of the potential barrier, and As the 
difference in entropy between ground state and activated state (the quantities u 
and s in small letters refer to one particle, the capital quantities to a mole of them). 
In the absence of external forces initial and final equilibrium states are assumed to 
have the same potential energy. Then the rates of flow of particles across the divid-
ing potential barrier are the same in the forward and backward directions. Under 
the influence of external forces, however, local stress fields are generated. A particle 
thermally activated to move in the direction of, say, stress qr by a distance 'A/2 then 
gains an amount of energy w: 
(3.16) 
where q is the average cross section occupied by the particle normal to the direction 
of motion. A particle moving in the -qr direction will loose the same amount of 
energy. The first particle, therefore, needs less thermal energy to reach the activated 
state. than the second particle. Consequently the rates of flow of particles across an 
energy barrier in opposite directions are biased by the local stress: 
kl = ko exp (w/kT) 
(3.17) 
k2 = ko exp (-w/kT). 
(3.18) 
The net flow rate, therefore, is: 
K = kl - k2 = 2 ko sinh (w/kT). 
(3.19) 
It should be noted very carefully that w is equal to the product of local stress 
times an activation volume; this is the volume drawn up by particle cross section 
and step width in the process of activation. Activation volume and activation energy 
necessarily must refer to one and the same activation process. 
c. Tobolsky-Eyring 
The concept of slipping of secondary bonds was applied by Tobolsky and Eyring 
in 1943 to the breaking of polymeric threads under - uniaxial - load [44]. The 
55 

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
rate of decrease of the number N of such bonds per unit area under constant uniaxial 
stress 'lro is obtained from Eqs. (3.1) and (3.l9): 
-! dN = 2 ko sinh ('Ir 0 A/2 NkT). 
N dt 
(3.20) 
For large values of stress the flow of bonds takes place almost exclusively as 
breakage and not as reformation. In that case one may use Eq. (3.17) instead of 
(3.19). If one substitutes there 'lroA/2 NkT by y one obtains a solution in terms of 
the exponential integral -Ei( - y): 
00 
-Ei(-y) = f dy'exp(-y')/y' =kotb. 
(3.21) 
Yo 
The lower limit of integration isyo = 'lroA/2 NokT = w/kT. Equation (3.21) 
offers an implicit relation between the expectation value of the time to fracture of 
the thread, tb, the rate of flow of unstressed secondary bonds, ko, and the stress 
'lro acting on the No initial bonds. With w ~ kT the exponential integral may be 
approximated by: 
-Ei(-y) = [(exp - y)/y](1- l/Y)· 
(3.22) 
Within the range of validity of this approximation the logarithm of lifetime, 
log tb, is almost linearly related to w, i.e., to the applied stress. Exactly this behavior 
is exhibited by a large number of stressed metals, ceramics, or polymers. Together 
with Eyring's original interpretation this has laid the foundations of the kinetic theory 
of fracture, to which - as indicated above - subsequently a large number of research-
ers have contributed. 
D. Zhurkov, Bueche 
Independently from each other Zhurkov et al. [45-47] in the USSR and Bueche 
[48-50] in the USA expressed the idea that in fracture of polymers - and also of 
metals for that matter - the breakage of primary (chemical) bonds plays an im-
portant role. They found that the time to fracture under uniaxial stress ao of Zn, 
AI, and for example, PMMA and PS below their glass transition temperatures could 
be expressed by an exponential relationship involving three kinetic parameters: 
(3.23) 
The three parameters were - based on the available data - interpreted as energy 
for activation of bond scission (Uo), as the inverse of molecular oscillation frequen-
cy (to), and as a structure sensitive parameter 'Y. In Figure 3.7 experimental data and 
the theoretical curves according to Eq. (3.23) are reproduced. 
Equation (3.23) can be considered as a general expression of the kinetic nature 
of material disintegration. A closer discussion of the meaning of the molecular os-
cillation frequency, of the structure-sensitive parameter 'Y, and also of the activation

energy for bond scission in view of the molecular structure and of the sequence of 
molecular processes will be given in Chapters 7- 9. At this point one would like to 
check further arguments that the existence (and volume concentration) of the strong 
primary bonds determines the rigidity and strength of (polymeric) solids. 
Holliday et al. (70] have looked under this aspect on the degree of connectivity 
CN (average number of main network bonds per chain atom, e.g., 2 in hydrocarbon 
chains, 3 in graphite, and 4 in diamond) and on the relative volume density of main 
bonds NCR (which here is density times number of network atoms in the repeat 
unit divided by molecular weight of a repeat unit). The term NCR varies between 
less than 0.01 for bulky polymeric chains and 0.58 for diamond. The bulk moduli, 
Young's moduli, hardness values, and cubical coefficients of thermal expansion of 
the more than 50 organic and inorganic polymers investigated at room temperature 
exhibit a strong correlation with NCR. In Figure 3.8 the best fit curves drawn by Holli-
day for Young's modulus and Brinell hardness values BHN are reproduced (the ac-
tual NCR values - except for those of the graphitelike structures - fall into a narrow 
band along the curves having a width of ± 0.05). The nearly identical shapes of the 
upper portions of both curves suggest that hardness (compressive yield strength) 
and elastic modulus depend in the same way on the concentration of primary bonds. 
In fact for the points on the curve with NCR> 0.08 (mostly organic thermosetting 
resins or inorganic polymers) the ratio of BNH value and E has a constant value of 
0.0625. 
For values of NCR < 0.08 (thermoplastic materials) the correlation between 
mechanical properties and bond density is much less pronounced although the steep 
slopes of the shown curves tend to make the scatter of the actual data points less 
apparent. The main reason for the lack of good correlation certainly is the fact that 
in high polymer solids the stiffness and strength can be utilized only to that extent 
permitted by intermolecular attraction and segment orientation (cf. Table 1.1 for 
the differences in elastic moduli of chains, highly oriented fibers, and isotropic 
solids; in section E below and in Chapter 5 the role of orientation and intermolecular 
attraction on chain strain is discussed in detail). 
In order to investigate the effect of the density of main chain bonds on the 
mechanical properties it is necessary to select experimental conditions such that

comparable mechanical excitation of said bonds does indeed take place. According 
to Vincent [71] commensurable reference temperatures to measure a critical tensile 
strength are the brittle point temperatures, where brittle failure changes to a ductile 
failure. As indicated in Figure 3.9 he has related the number of backbone bonds per 
unit area (i.e., sample density times length of repeat unit over weight of repeat unit) 
to the critical tensile strength ()f (isotropic) polymers. A linear relationship exists 
between critical sample strength and bond packing density which does not seem to 
depend on the chemical nature of the bond. From the slope of the straight line the 
critical strength (in MN/m2) of the isotropic polymers is obtained as 36.8 times 
the number of backbone bonds per nm2 . In highly oriented textile fibers this figure 
is much larger and amounts to between 100 and 250; in aromatic polyamide fibers 
(Kevlar 49) it reaches about 650. This should be compared with the theoretical 
value for fully oriented chains of infinite length which is about 3000, since the axial 
load to break a molecular chain of anyone of the species listed in Figure 3.9 is of 
the order of 3 nN. 
In other words, in isotropic thermoplastics at the point of brittle failure only 
a minute fraction - less than 1 % - of all main chain bonds is fully strained. Under 
these conditions, onset of unstable crack propagation is determined by the mag-
nitude of intermolecular attraction. Reinterpreting Vincent's data one must say that 
it is not the number of backbone bonds per unit area and their accumulated strength

which determine macroscopic strength but the level of intermolecular forces; the 
latter benefit from a closer packing. 
The effect of molecukIr weight on fiber strength has been widely investigated 
(cf. 20, 51, 52, 54, 72-74). The general observations have been briefly summarized 
and illustrated by Figure 1.13 for PA 6 fibers. In low molecular weight material chain 
slip occurs readily so that the sample strength depends solely on the strength of 
intermolecular attraction. Noticeable macroscopic strength is only obtained if the 
molecular weight is sufficient to permit physical cross-links through entanglements 
or chain folds between several chains. 
In the following section it will be discussed in more detail to what extent the 
orientation distribution of chain segments, the ensuing distribution of axial chain 
stresses, and the gradual accumulation of defects through successive breakage of 
chains can be held responsible for the discrepancy between actual and theoretical 
strength. 
E. Hsiao-Kausch 
In the fracture theory of Hsiao-Kausch [60, 61] the state of orientation of a polymeric 
solid is explicitly recognized. The theory combines the kinetic concept of Zhurkov or 
Bueche and the theory of deformation of anisotropic solids developed by Hsiao [59] 
59 

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
for a model made up of rodlike elastic elements. The fracture theory is based on the 
simplifying assumption that the mechanical properties of the anisotropic solid are 
predominantly determined by the state of orientation and the properties of the (one-
dimensional) elastic elements. The intermolecular interaction is neglected. In Chapter 2 
the mathematical model (Fig. 2.12) has been described and the constitutive stress-
strain relations (Eq. (2.5)) have been derived. The kinetic aspects are introduced into this 
model through the assumption that the rodlike elastic elements can undergo breakage, 
that the probability of failure of an element is determined by the axial stress acting 
upon that element, and that an immediate redistribution of the load carried up to 
then by the breaking element occurs. Again the models is characterized by the fact 
that it distinguishes between the macroscopic state of stress ( fJ) and the microscopic 
(axial) stress 'I! of an element. The axial stress of a one-dimensional elastic element 
deformed in a homogeneous strain field Emn is determined by its axial elongation: 
(3.24) 
The summation convention for repeated indices is used. E is the modulus of 
elasticity of the elastic elements, and sm, Sn are components of the unit vector in 
the direction of orientation identified by {} and cp (S1 = sin {} cos cp, S2 = sin {} sin cp, 
s3 = cos {}). For uniaxial stress, 033 = 00, and transverse symmetry about the 
33-axis Eq. (3.24) becomes: 
(3.25) 
where II is Poisson ratio Ell /E33. 
In a partially or nonoriented system, the microscopic axial stresses are larger 
than 00 by a factor of up to E/E"A. where E"A. is the longitudinal modulus of elasticity 
of the subvolume containing the elastic element. If all subvolumes of a sample behave 
identically, then E"A. is the longitudinal modulus of the (partially) oriented sample. 
Naturally the largest axial stresses are experienced by those elements oriented in 
the direction of uniaxial stress. In a completely oriented ~ystem E and E"A. are equal 
by definition, and macroscopic and microscopic stress (in the direction of orienta-
tion) are equal also. 
As stated above it is then first assumed in accordance with Zhurkov's kinetic 
considerations that elements break and secondly that the orientation-dependent 
rate of breakage of elements is given by Eq. (3.17) as 
d f ({) t) 
-
'= k ({}) = ko exp (f3'1!/RT) 
fdt 
(3.26) 
where f3 is the activation volume for breakage of the elastic elements in question 
and f= N({}, t)/N({}, 0) the fraction of unbroken elements. 
Thirdly it is assumed that after breakage of an element mechanical equilibrium 
is established within the affected subvolume and that strain E33 increases. This means 
that the elastic elements of all orientations take over an appropriate share of the 
load carried previously by the broken element to balance the load acting on the 
60

boundaries of the sub volume. It has been shown in Chapter 2 that the stress tensor 
acting on a small volume element of the elastic network can be calculated once the 
orientation distribution function, p, is known 
Ojj = J p(&) f(~, t) Sj Sj 'l'(~, t) dn 
where dn is the infinitesimal solid angle. 
In uniaxial stressing, mechanical equilibrium within the elastic network is 
established if

(3.29) 
The system of Eqs. (3.26), (3.28), and (3.29) has been evaluated for a complete-
ly oriented and an unoriented network under constant uniaxial stress 00. The case 
of a completely oriented network is that treated by Tobolsky and Eyring. All ele-
ments are thought to be subjected to the same stress 'l' which increases inversely 
proportional to the decreasing number of unbroken elements. Breakdown of the 
subvolume occurs with breakage of the last element within the subvolume, i.e., 
after f has reached zero. The time to breakdown of the subvolume, tb, is taken from 
Eqs. (3.20), (3.21), and (3.26) as 
koto = - Ei (-iN'0 /RT) 
(3.30) 
where'l'o is the initial stress carried by elements of orientation ~ = O. 
In the case of random network orientation the system of Eqs. (3.26), (3.28), 
and (3.29) cannot be solved analytically. An approximation method has been pro-
posed, however [60]. Without repeating details of the method it may be said that 
the changes of f for a time interval Ll t as calculated from Eq. (3.26) are being fed 
back into Eqs. (3.28) and (3.29) giving the corresponding changes of €ll (t) and 
€33(t), which in turn determine the changes of 'l'(t). The iterative integration of 
Eqs. (3.26), (3.28), and (3.29) can be carried out numerically. 
Two results of these calculations seem to be of interest with respect to the 
effect of network orientation on defect accumulation and strength: that the range 
of orientation angles within which elements break preferentially is narrow and that 
the increase in strength resulting from improved uniaxial orientation is limited. The 
first effect is illustrated in Figure 3.10 for a randomly oriented network where the 
initial distribution p = 1/2 1T, of elements is independent of~. Elements oriented 
in the direction of uniaxial stress (cos ~ = 1) experience the largest initial stress 
('l' 0), and they break preferentially. The angular distribution of f (cos ~, TIME) is 
shown for three different stages of defect development, namely after f (1, TIME) 
has dropped to 0.5 and zero, respectively, and for the point of impending network 
failure - where the numerical calculations had been terminated because breakage

time scale is given in terms of TIME where 
TIME = t/tz = ko t exp ({3'1t 0 /RT) 
(3.31) 
and tz the time to failure according to Zhurkov's Eq. (3.23). It should be noted 
that more than one-half of the loading period has to pass before one-half of the 
most heavily stressed elements is broken. More than 90% of the loading period has 
to elapse before all elements within a small angular section are broken. At this 
second stage the majority of all elements is still unbroken. The step from the second 
to the third stage of defect accumulation is rather short « 6% ofloading time) and 
from there to network failure practically negligible. It should also be noted that 
TIME (failure) of a randomly oriented network composed of successively breaking 
interacting elements is only somewhat smaller than the time given by the empirical 
Eq. (3.23) where TIME (failure) for a stress 'Ito is unity; on the other hand it is 
larger than RT/{3'1t, the value predicted by the exponential integral (Eq. (3.22)) for 
a completely oriented network loaded to such an extent that again the elements 
experience the same initial stress 'Ito. 
The numerical calculations according to the above model resulted in an estimate 
of the time to failure of arbitrarily oriented networks under constant load: 
ko tb = -[Ei (-{3'1to/RT)]C 
(3.32) 
where C is a slowly varying correction term the limits of which are expressed by: 
1 ~ C"::;; 1 + 0.63 {3 'lto/RT.

The lower limit refers to completely oriented, the upper to randomly oriented 
networks. With C being determined it has become possible to compare Eqs. (3.23)

and (3.32) and to express the structure sensitive kinetic parameter -y in terms of 
the element properties. In the range of validity of Eq. (3.22) one obtains for a fully

The term in parentheses is an orientation-dependent and minor kinetic contri-
bution derived from the assumption of successive failure of many elements (in the 
technically relevant range of 1J'I1 0 values from 40 to 200 kJ /mole the term in paren-
theses assumes values between 1.17 and 1.0). If the nature of the breaking elements 
is not changed during sample treatment or fracture development, then IJ can be con-
sidered to be constant. The major effect on -y is derived from the local stress con-
centration 'I1o/ao which here is equal to the stiffness ratio E/E?-. This theory essen-
tially predicts, therefore, that the increase in strength is equal to the increase in 
stiffness; it is based on the presumption that the elements break indeed at a critical 
local strain (kinetic version of St. Venant's criterion of maximum strain). A different 
interpretation of the strength of oriented samples which is based on the rotation of 
flaws has been presented in an earlier section of this chapter. 
In Figure 3.11 the experimental data obtained by Regel and Leksovskii [75] 
for the lifetimes of partially oriented PAN fibers are compared with theoretical 
curves derived from Eq. (3.32). It should be emphasized that the gain in strength

through improved orientation of the PAN fibers (or of their model representation) 
amounts to a factor of '110/00 = 5. Similar values of between 2 and 5 for the increase 
in strength with orientation have been reported for PE, PP, PS, PVC, PMMA, or PA 
[51, 54]. It should be pointed out that the rather limited increase in stiffness in

these experiments indicates that the orienting "elements" are not simply highly ex-
tended chain segments but larger molecular domains of limited anisotropy. This 
does not preclude the possibility that breakage of an element is essentially identical 
to breakage of the most highly stressed chain molecule(s). This will be the case if 
the breaking chain(s) carry practically the total load of an element or initiate its 
breakage. 
A comparison of different reaction rate models was made by Henderson et al. 
[76] who found that the bond rupture theories (Tobolsky-Eyring, Zhurkov-Bueche) 
gave better agreement with fracture data on filled poly butadiene and filled and un-
filled PVC than the bond slippage hypothesis. Primary uncertainties exist, however, 
with respect to a repair reaction and to the temperature dependence of {3 and 'Y- The 
question of the true meaning of the activation volumes {3 and 'Y, of the stress ratio 
wo/ao, and of the role of chain stretching and chain scission in macroscopic frac-
ture will be resumed in Chapters 7 to 9. 
F. Gotlib, Dobrodumov et al. 
In none of the previously treated molecular fracture theories (A - E) allowance has 
been made for possible stress concentration in the neighborhood of a breaking 
element. The first ruptures in a large ensemble of initially equally stressed molecules 
certainly will occur at random within the stressed volume. The breakage and retrac-
tion of a particular element must lead, however, preferentially to an increase in 
axial stresses of those elements to which it is coupled (through secondary forces). 
The probability density for rupture of those elements will, therefore, be slightly 
higher than that for others. But the higher probability density applies only to the 
small number of elements in the vicinity of the existing fracture points. So the (in-
tegrated) probability for rupture of one of these elements is initially smaller than 
the probability for rupture of one of the large number of chains hitherto not af-
fected by a ruptured element. The rupture events, therefore, will continue for some 
time to occur at random [67]. With their growing number, chances are increasing 
that rupture events occur in an immediate vicinity of each other thereby forming 
the nucleus of a crack and enhancing the fracture probability of neighboring 
elements. 
Whenever the random accumulation of defects in one site has grown to such 
a size that subsequent fractures will preferentially occur at that site, one has reached 
the end of the phase of fracture initiation and the beginning of (thermal) crack 
growth 
In Figure 3.12 a computer simulation by Dobrodumov et al. of the fracture 
development within a regular model lattice is shown [58]. The authors have taken 
the ratio of the elastic constants in and perpendicular to the direction of orientation 
as lO: 1 and an element fracture probability as given by Eq. (3.23). The distribution 
of local stresses was determined by a numerical iteration procedure. It is readily ob-
served that for small loads ({3wo/RT = 5) a large number of isolated defects appear 
before (from the accidental accumulation of a few defect points) a "crack" starts 
growing. At higher loads ({3wo/RT = 20) a smaller number of defect points initiate

a crack and very little damage is done to the remainder of the plane during fracture 
initiation. These results are qualitatively similar to those of Hsiao and Kausch shown 
in Figure 3.10. From these studies the authors [57, 67] conclude that in polymers 
only weak stress concentration on a molecular scale can exist (axial stresses adjacent 
to a site comprising j defects should be larger by a factor of VI'than the stress further 
away). It should be noted that this model - as the previous one - strictly operates 
with elastic elements and with their rupture as the only way to relieve local stress. 
The application of these models, therefore, seems to be restricted to the brittle frac-
ture of organic glasses or to other systems not involving large anelastic or plastic 
deformation in fracture initiation. 
G. Bueche -
Halpin 
The limited viscoelastic extensibility of rubber strands determines according to the 
theory of Bueche and Halpin [69] the fracture of elastomers. The authors assume 
65 

3. Statistical, Continuum Mechanical, and Rate Process Theories of Fracture 
that a large number of filaments at the tip of a growing crack have to be strained 
successively to their critical elongation Ac. The sample will fracture at a gross strain 
Ab after q filaments have been broken in a time tb = qt'. The values Ab and Ac are 
connected through the creep function of the material and the stress concentration 
factor. The theory allows one to calculate the elongation at break, Ab, from the 
knowledge of the creep function. It does not take into consideration any change 
of stress concentration with growing crack length or the decrease of t', the time 
necessary to fracture one filament, with continuing creep of the sample. It is as-
sumed that all filaments will have to be stretched from practically zero elongation 
to Ac. That will, in the first place, affect any numerical valUes of q which may be 
calculated from fitting experimental failure envelopes. A group of q filaments 
subject to the statistical condition that fracture of one filament may start once 
the fracture of the preceding one is completed has an average lifetime, < tb >, of 
qt' and a Poisson distribution oftb: 
(3.36) 
The same concept of filament deformation was independently employed by 
Bartenev et al. [77] to the opening and growth of crazes (silver cracks) in PMMA. 
The molecular theories treated in this chapter have considered the thermally 
activated breakage of elements or filaments as a source of crack initiation and 
macroscopic failure. It is the purpose of the following chapters to investigate the 
mechanical strength of primary bonds and of molecular chains and to study the 
occurrence of chain breakages. With that information available it will be possible 
to resume the discussion on the nature of the "elements" used in molecular theories 
of fracture.

In the last chapter, in the section on molecular theories of fracture, almost through-
out an Arrhenius equation has been used to describe the activation of element break-
age. The energy of activation, Uo, frequently turned out to be equal to (or was 
assumed to be equal to) the dissociation energy of the weakest main chain bond. 
Before further analyzing the kinetics of element - and possibly chain - breakage 
a definition of the mechanical strength of a bond and of a chain have to be given. 
In order to do this basic results of quantum chemistry [1, 2] are recalled in this 
chapter which concern the "strengths" of intramolecular bonds and factors in-
fluencing the binding potential such as electronic excitation or ionization. 
A. Atomic Orbitals 
Covalent chemical bonds between atoms of the same or a different species rely on 
the interaction of the outermost - or valence - electrons. Even though one speaks 
of electrons one should rather think of electron clouds, i.e. of electronic density 
distributions. The radial and angular distribution of the electron density is described 
by "one electron" wave functions \}I - also called atomic orbitals - which are 
derived as a solution of the quantum mechanical Schrodinger equation: 
69 

4. Strength of Primary Bonds 
(4.1) 
Here h is Planck's constant, mr the reduced mass of an electron with charge e, 
V the Nabla operator, and E the energy eigenvalue of an electron moving within a 
potential V. The term in brackets constitutes the Hamiltonian operator H. 
The Schrodinger equation has a solution only for certain discrete energy values 
E. Different values of E mean different forms of the electronic density distributions 
which are characterized by the principal quantum number n, the angular quantum 
number Q and the magnetic quantum number m. 
For the simplest atomic system, the hydrogen atom, which consists of one pro-
ton and one electron the potential V is _e2 /f. In this case energy levels are obtained, 
which are degenerate, i.e. the energy levels for different I and m coincide. The cor-
responding wave functions, however, do depend on the three quantum numbers n, I 
and m. It should be noted that the radial distribution, R(r), and the angular distribu-
tion 8(8, (1) may be separated: 
( 4.2) 
The quantum numbers are subject to the condition that 
Q = 0,1,2 ... n-l 
m = 0, ±1, ±2 ... ±Q. 
It is customary to denote the atomic orbitals by the spectroscopical terms s, 
p, d ... if Q is 0, 1, 2 ... respectively. 
The first few wave functions for a hydrogen-like atom with a charge of + Ze of 
the nucleus then have the following form: 
Is RlO(r) = (Z/ao)3/2 2 exp (-Zr/ao) 
2s R20(r) = (Z/ao)3/2 (2 - Zr/ao) (exp - Zr/2ao) (1/2 0) 
2p R21 (r) = (Z/ao)3/2 (Zr/2ao v'6j exp (- Zr/2ao) 
and

8Ix (8, (1) = (.../3/2 y'rr) cos 11 sin 8 
8 ly (8, (1) = (v'3/2 y'rr) sin 11 sin 8 
81z (8, (1) = (v'3/2 y'rr) cos 8.

(4.4) 
(4.5) 
(4.6) 
(4.7a) 
(4.7b) 
(4.7c) 
Here ao is the radius of the first Bohr orbit in hydrogen (0.529 . 10-10 m). 
According to the Pauli exclusion principle every atomic orbital may be occupied 
by one or two electrons which in the latter case have to have their spins aligned 
antiparallel to each other (paired electron spins). 
For many-electron atoms an exact analytical solution of the Schrodinger 
equation (Eq. 4.1) is not possible. Nevertheless atomic orbitals may be obtained 
70 

I. Covalent Bonds 
by an iterative procedure, which starts by placing the appropriate number of elec-
trons on hydrogen-like one-electron orbitals. With the potential obtained from such 
a charge distribution a better approxiination of the first orbital can be calculated 
which in tum is considered in the recalculation of the second orbital and so on until 
no further corrections become necessary. Again these orbitals are denoted by 1 s, 
2s, 2p, 3d if the quantum numbers n and Q are 1 and 0, 2 and 0, 2 and 1, 3 and 2 
and so on. 
In a many-electron atom - as for instance U - one finds a particular electron 
in any of the accessible orbitals (1 s, 2s) and in any of the two possible states of 
spin (ms = + 1/2 or -1/2). Since electrons are indistinguishable the energy of the 
atom must not be affected by interchanging the coordinates of any pair of elec-
trons. The wave function belonging to one eigenvalue E will have to encompass, 
therefore, all terms resulting from an interchange of electron numbering. 
In the case of U the ground state has the wave function: 
ls a (1) lsj3 (1) 
2s a (1) 
'1'= 
(4.8a) 
2s a (3) 
or 
'I' = Is a(I) Isj3 (2)2s a (3) - Is a (2) Isj3 (1) 2s a (3) + ... 
(4.8b) 
Each of the six terms of the fully written determinant (4 .8b) contains an orbital 
and a spin function for each of the three electrons. The spin function a (I) may 
denote that the electron 1 has a spin quantum number ms = +1/2,13(1) corresponds 
to m = -1/2. 
B. Hybridization 
It can easily be shown that an atom with one electron in each of the 2s-, 2px-, 
2py-, and 2pz-orbitals has a total charge density distribution which is completely 
spherical, i.e. independent of e and cp. The s- and p-atomic orbitals are not the only 
functions that lead to a spherical distribution of the total charge. A large number 
of suitable linear combinations of the s- and p-orbitals do have the same property. 
These linear combinations are called hybrid orbitals or hybrids. Depending on the 
number and kind of atomic orbitals used in hybridization the hybrids are denoted 
as sp, Sp2, sp3, dsp etc. The four normalized and orthogonal Sp3 -hybrids (of a 
C-atom) have the form: 
(4.9a) 
(4.9b) 
(4.9c) 
71 

4. Strength of Primary Bonds 
(4.9d) 
The individual hybrid is, of course, non-spherical, i.e. the electron density dis-
tribution has a characteristic shape. In this particular case the directions of maximum 
electron density point into the corners of a regular tetrahedron. 
The electronic energy of a C-atom with electrons in hybrid orbitals is higher 
than that of the ground state. In carbon the ground state will be formed by two elec-
trons in each of the lowest orbitals: 1 S2 2S2 2p2. Hybridization involves the change 
from pyramidal orbitals (p3) to tetragonal ones (Sp3); it requires, that three p-or-
bitals be occupied. The first step is, therefore, that one electron be promoted from 
2s to 2p which necessitates an energy of promotion. The effect of promotion and 
hybridization is, however, that four rather than two electrons are available for bond-
ing. The gain in binding energy of the two additional C-H bonds (90 to 100 kcal/mol 
per C-H bond) more than balances the energy expended for promotion and hybrid-
ization. 
c. Molecular Orbitals 
Within the limited scope of this book a mere terminology of molecular orbital theory 
can be supplied - intended only for the discussion of bond energies. Rigorous quan-
tum mechanical calculations for any molecule being more complex than the hydrogen 
molecule are not feasible. Therefore, approximate methods for calculation of the 
orbitals of the bonding electrons have been developed [1,2]. The two most impor-
tant ones are the molecular orbital (MO) method relating to the work of Hund, Mulli-
ken, and Hiickel [la] and the bond orbital method, the Heitler-London-Slater-
Pauling (HSLP) method [1 b]. In the MO approach electrons are placed in one-
electron-wave functions which belong to the molecule as a whole with each nucleus 
in its proper configuration. In its crudest form these wave functions are obtained as 
a linear combination of the atomic orbitals (LCAO) of all atoms forming the molecule 
[2a]. 
In bond orbital theory the wave functions of the molecule are derived from the 
wave functions associated with the different bonds of a molecule, Le. from the bond 
orbitals. In the LCBO model the molecular orbitals are a linear combination of bond 
orbitals which in turn are a combination of the atomic orbitals or hybrids forming 
the bond in question [2b]. In the HLSP-method the many-electron wave functions 
are a sum of product functions which contain a HeitIer and London type of factor 
(space function and spin function) for each bond of the molecule. 
Bond orbital and molecular orbital approach lead to the common conclusion 
that bonding will occur only at directions where the atomic orbitals have large values 
and only if the atoms are close enough to each other so that the atomic orbitals 
overlap, i.e. if the "electron clouds" partly penetrate each other. 
A covalent bond is associated with an electron pair and hence subject to the 
quantum mechanical phenomenon of electron exchange: in a molecule A-B the 
electron from A may also be found near the nucleus of atom B and vice versa. It is 
72 

II. Bond Energies 
this additional exchange energy term which significantly deepens the interatomic 
potential and leads to a distinct potential minimum - prerequisite for a stable 
binding. Thus a bond can be formed if a bonding molecular orbital exists and if 
it is occupied by an electron or an electron pair. In the ground energy state of a 
molecule paired electrons occupy the molecular orbitals with the lowest energy. 
D. Multiple Bonds 
So far multiple bonds between atoms of the same or a different species such as carbon, 
nitrogen, and oxygen have not been explicitly discussed). At this point attention 
should be drawn to the fact that the two (or three) molecular orbitals involved in 
forming a double (or triple) bond are usually not of the same kind but of different 
character. In ethylene(H2 C=CH2) all six atoms lie in one plane. Therefore, one 
may take three sp2-hybrid orbitals of each C·atom to form the four C-H bonds 
and the one axially symmetric C-C bond, the a bond. 
The two remaining pz orbitals are combined into the so called (molecular) 1f 
bond orbital. Since the pz orbitals are directed perpendicular to the 1f bond which 
they are forming their overlap is smaller than that of orbitals forming a a bond. 
Also the regions of maximum overlap are not in the xy plane between the C-atoms 
but rather above and below this plane. Because of this orientation of the pz orbitals 
the interaction between conjugated 1f bonds is so strong that in fact it leads to a 
delocalization of the 1f electrons. In view of the geometry of the 1f bond it is easily 
realized that rotation of a group around multiple bonds is forbidden [Ic]. 
II. Bond Energies 
A. Electronic Energy and Heat of Formation 
The term bond energy requires a definition. The potential energy·scheme of an ar· 
bitrary bond A-B in a poly atomic molecule given in Figure 4.1 serves to illustrate 
this point. As pointed out previously one has to take into account that in poly· 
electronic atoms the valency state of the atom may lie above the respective ground 
state. If this is the case no binding can occur between two atoms in their ground 
states; if they encounter each other their potential energy will rise. At some inter-
atomal distance the potential energy of the system will approach the energy of the 
atoms in their valency states (Fig. 4.1, dashed line) and a transition to the binding 
state can occur. The intrinsic binding energy (wahre Bindungsenergie) E is, therefore, 
the difference between the energy of the molecular ground state and that of the 
valency states at infinite interatomal distance. The energy of dissociation D is smaller 
than E, namely by the zero point energy (Nullpunktsenergie) h v/2 of vibration 
and by the sum P of energies of promotion, hybridization, and polar and steric 
rearrangements necessary to attain the valency state. The difference between zero 
point energy and the maximum of the potential energy curve is the activation

energy Do of bond dissociation. In diatomic molecules Do and D generally have the 
same value and represent the bond energy. 
In molecules with three or more atoms the assignment of a specific increment 
of energy to a particular bond is complicated by the presence of the above mentioned 
energy term P for promotion and electron reorganization, by the occurrence of delo-
calized electrons, and by the fact that the dissociation energies of successively broken 
identical bonds are different. The latter statement may be illustrated by the disinte-
gration of CH4 .1t must be assumed that the four hydrogen atoms in CH4 are equiv-
alent, all C-H bonds are formed by hydrogen Is orbitals and carbon 2Sp3 orbitals. 
Abstraction of the first hydrogen atom requires an energy of 425.8 kl Imol 
(101.7 kcal/mol) and changes the methane atom into the methyl radical CH3. From 
symmetry considerations confirmed by ESR investigations it has been concluded 
[4] that the methyl radical is planar, with the unpaired electron undoubtedly in a 
2p orbital of the C-atom. The bond character of the C-H bonds remaining in what 
now is the methyl radical has changed, therefore, from the tetrahedral configuration 
of sp3 hybrid orbitals into the planar one of Sp2 hybrids. The dissociation energy 
of one of these C-H bonds is 477.3 kllmol (114 kcal/mol). The third hydrogen 
has a dissociation energy of 418.7 (100 kcal/mol), the fourth of 341.2 kllmol 
(81.5 kcal/mol). The total energy gained in forming CH4 from its constituent atoms 
is, therefore, 1663 kllmol (397.2 kcal/mol), the average C-H bond energy 
415.7 kJ/mol (99.3 kcal/mol) [5]. It is this average derived from the energy offor-
mation of the molecule which is usually termed bond energy (mittlere Bindungs-
energie). 
The bond energies of saturated and unsaturated homologues of hydrocarbons 
may be treated in some detail since they will give us some understanding of the cor-
relation of bond energies in poiyoiefins. In saturated hydrocarbons with localized 
electrons it is reasonable to equate the energy of a bond with the energy of the 
74 

II. Bond Energies 
electrons forming that particular bond. Theoretically the electronic energy of a 
molecule may be calculated using any of the mentioned approximations, for in-
stance the LCBO method [2b, 6]. In that case the molecular orbitals for the 2N u-
electrons of a hydrocarbon with N bonds may be written as a linear combination of 
N bond orbitals cPj: 
N 
Wj = ~ Cij CPj. 
i=1 
One assumes that the wave functions Wj are a solution of the equation 
or 
(H-E) Wj = O. 
If one defines the notations 
Hij = f CPi H CPj dv 
Sjj = f cPj CPj dv 
(resonance integral) 
(overlap integral), 
(4.10) 
( 4.11) 
( 4.12) 
(4.13a) 
(4.13b) 
introduces Eq. (4.10) into Eq. (4.12), and multiplies that equation from the left 
hand side by CPj one obtains 
N 
.~ Cji(Hji-ESji)=0 j=1,2, ... N. 
1=1 
(4.14) 
The system (4.14) of equations has a nontrivial solution only if the determinant 
of the quantities in brackets is zero. Since in principle the coefficients Hij and Sij 
are derivable from the electron wave functions the secular determinant of the sys-
tem (4.14) may be solved to yield the energy eigenvalues El to EN. The total 
electronic energy E of the molecule then is 
N 
E = ~ 2 Ej . 
j= 1 
(4.15) 
Following the treatment of Brown [6] it is assumed that the Coulomb integral, 
Hmm, of an orbital CPm depends only on the type of bond in which it resides, thus 
all C-H bond orbitals will be assigned the same value a of the Coulomb integral. 
The term is one half of the binding energy of an isolated C-H bond. The resonance 
integral, Hmn, will be assumed to be zero unless m and n denote adjacent bonds. In 
that case Hmn still depends on the type of neighboring bonds. In Table 4.1 the as-
signments of Brown for the bond interaction parameters in saturated hydrocarbons 
are listed.

In Table 4.2 and 4.3 the electronic energies of a few hydrocarbons and of their 
radicals are given in terms of Brown's parameters. It will be noted that to a zeroth 
approximation (S = 0) the total electronic energy E of a molecule or a radical is given 
by the sum of the energie& of the corresponding number of isolated C-C and C-H-
bonds. In the first approximation also the energetic interactions of neighboring 
bonds are considered (terms to the first power of S as listed in Tables 4.2 and 4.3) 
and higher powers of S are neglected. Such terms would be necessary, however, 
to account for the effect of third neighbors within the molecule. That effect is 
clearly revealed by analysis of thermochemical data [7]. 
If it were possible to determine the numerical values of the bond interaction 
parameters by simply using molecular geometry and atomic constants one would 
have a direct and independent way to calculate bond energies. So far, however, it 
has proven very cumbersome to derive the explicit values of the bond energy para-
meters 0:, h, 'Y, 8 2 , T/2 , and S directly and sufficiently correctly from molecular 
wave functions. Usually thermochemical data are employed to obtain the electronic 
energy of a molecule. For example the electronic energy E of a hydrocarbon can be

calculated from the enthalpies Ha of atomization of hydrogen, L of sublimation 
of graphite, and ~Hf of formation of the hydrocarbon from H2 and Cn : 
E(CnH2n+2) = - n L(C) - (n + 1 )Ha + ~Hf - w. 
(4.16) 
The term W accounts for the fact that the minimum of a binding potential is by 
the zero point vibrational energy (I/2 hv) lower than the corresponding dissociation 
energy (Fig. 4.1). Since the relevant frequencies are of the order of 2.5 . 1013 s-l 
(C-C skeleton) and 9 . 1013 s-l (C-H) the zero point vibrational energies range 
between 5 kJ/mol and 18 kJ/mol. 
A quantitative analysis of the quantum mechanical calculations through ther-
mochemical data will be attempted, although considerable uncertainties exist. These 
are caused by the limitations of the used first order approximation, the lack of con-
sideration of steric interaction of atoms, and of the difficulties to determine W. The 
analysis is firstly based on the fact that the differences between the electronic 
energies of the listed hydrocarbons and their radicals can be expressed by only four 
quantities Fj : 
Fl =-2a+ 1282 Sr 
F2 = 4(1-82) Sr 
F3 = -4(1 - 282 + 7]2) Sr 
F4 = -2a- 2hr + 247]2 Sr. 
(4.17) 
(4.18) 
(4.19) 
(4.20) 
Brown [6] determined F2 to be 15.5 kJ/mol (from the radical dissociation 
energies listed in Table 4.3) and F 3 to be -6.7 kJ Imol (from the energy differences 
found for 5 pairs of isomers listed in Table 4.3). 
Since these difference values are not so much affected by the systematic un-
certainties mentioned above they will be adopted here along with the value of 
300 kJ Imol for F 4; F 4 is the electronic energy of a C-C bond interacting solely 
with C-C bonds as in (CH3hC-C(CH3h- Further the standard values (at 
298.15 K and 1 bar) L = 717.2 kJ/mol and Ha = 436.2 kJ/mol [7] and a ~ Hf (CH4) = 
= -75 kJ/mol have been used [6]. The zero point vibrational energy of the 9 vibra-
tional modes of the -C-H and H-C-H bonds of methane is estimated at 100 kJ Imol. 
The total electronic energy of methane then is derived from Eq. (4.16) as E (CH4) 
= -1765 kJ /mol. From Eqs. (4.17) and (4.18) it follows that 6.2 < Sr < 8.4 kJ /mol.

one obtains 
On the basis of these values the electronic energies of the hydrocarbons have 
been determined and listed as Etheor in Table 4.2. For comparison the thermo-
chemically determined enthalpies of formation are referenced as Eexp + W. The 
latter values are consistently larger than Etheor although the difference decreases 
rather than to increase with the number of vibrational modes available to a molecule.

4. Strength of Primary Bonds 
The treatment may be extended to deal with the energy of alkyl radicals if one 
assumes that the single unpaired elec.L on on the "radicalized" carbon atom occupies 
of 2P1T molecular orbital and does not change the interaction of other electrons on 
other orbitals. As mentioned earlier this assumption is in accord with ESR-investi-
gations [4]. In electronic terms the dissociation eq.ergy D of a bond Rl - R2 can 
then be formulated as 
(4.21) 
In Table 4.3 the electronic energy of hydrocarbon radicals and R-H dissociation 
energies are listed together with thermo chemically determined values. The difference 
values of electronic and thermochemical data are in correspondence with each other. 
The absolute value of F 1 = D(R-H) + 1/2 hv(R-H) can be calculated from Eq. 
(4.17) to be 431 kllmol; since D(R-H) for tertiary carbon atoms is 381 kllmol a 
contribution of 50 kllmol must be assigned to the zero point vibrations. This con-
tribution is certainly too high by ~30 kllmol. The discrepancies between cal-
culated and measured dissociation energies of C-C bonds, however, lie between 0 
and 6 kllmol for the bonds covered by Tables 4.2 and 4.3. The experimentally 
determined dissociation energies of small molecular groups are listed in the upper 
and left hand side of Table 4.4 [after van Krevelen, 9]. For these molecular frag-
ments the activation energy of bond rupture and the dissociation energy are assumed 
to correspond. In the lower right hand side we have listed the dissociation energies 
obtained for Sp2 and sp3 bonds by Stepan'yan et al. [10]. In their semi-empirical 
approach the authors calculate the bond dissociation energies RI-R2 byextrapo-
lation from those of the series of compounds R-X, X representing F, H, CI, Br, 
and I.ludging the available experimental and theoretical determinations of bond 
energies of chain molecules it must be stated that still considerable differences with 
respect to the depth of the binding potentials for main chain bonds exist. 
Before leaving the subject of bond energies one should briefly discuss the mean-
ing of the term bond strength. In quantum chemistry the term bond strength, or 
more explicitly the bonding strength of atomic orbitals, refers to the excentricity 
of a (hybrid or nonhybrid atomic) orbital and is measured by the maximum 
angular intensity of the wave function as compared with the spherically symmetrical 
s-orbital [1]. So the strength of an sp3 hybrid is 'Ir 1 (8 = 54° 44'; <p = 45°)1 (;1T) 1/2 = 2. 
Other hybrids of interest have the following bond strengths: the (pyramidal) p3 
hybrid 1.732, the (plane triangular) Sp2 hybrid 1.991, and the (linear) sp hybrid 
1.932. 
Throughout our further discussions, however, the term bond strength will have 
a more technological meaning, i.e. that of the force required to break the bond 
(cf. Chapter 5). 
B. Binding Energy of Excited States and Radicalized Chains 
In as much as the covalent binding force between any two atoms rests on the electron 
density distribution between (and around) these atoms any change of the electron 
80 

II. Bond Energies 
distribution necessarily affects the bond strength. Since the states of different elec-
tronic energy of a molecule are states of different electron distribution they are also 
states of different interatomal forces. 
This is also true, of course, for molecular ions, i.e. for molecules where one or 
more electrons have been removed completely. As already seen for methane the 
character of a bond and its energy are also affected through the radicalization of the 
atom group to which it belongs. 
1. Electronic Excitation 
The electronic excitation of a polymeric network chain can be caused by elec-
tromagnetic (light, UV, '}') or particle irradiation. The transfer of energy from the 
impinging particle or quantum of radiation to the electron requires that sufficient 
energy is available to reach an excited state and that an interaction mechanism exists. 
In the case of visible light a photon of, say, a wavelength of 330 nm has enough 
energy to break a C-C bond. However, the photon will not be absorbed by alkanes 
and there are no electronic states of that or a smaller energy which could be ex-
cited. To be effective a photon has to be absorbed and to interact with a binding 
electron. This interaction occurs either directly or indirectly through the mechanisms 
of energy transfer by exciton diffusion, single step transfer or absorption of fluores-
cence light emitted by the same or another (impurity) molecule [11]. The nature 
and sequence of these important processes which determine the photochemical 
stability - or instability - of polymers will not be treated here in detail. One is 
interested, however, to know the levels of energy where the excitation of electrons 
- or the ionization of molecules - begins and to know the changes of binding energy 
caused by excitation - or ionization - respectively.

4. Strength of Primary Bonds 
The potential curves of different excited states of the C2 -molecule illustrate the 
effect of electronic excitation on bond energies (Fig. 4.2). We would like to point 
out that the dissociation energies of the different molecular states shown range from 
350 to 119 kJ/mol (84 to 28 kcal/mol). These dissociation energies are generally 
smaller than the energy differences caused by the electronic excitation. The excited 
states of the (many-electron) C-atoms are denoted in the usual manner as S, P, D. 
Since two excited atoms may combine in a number of ways there are more than one 
molecular state corresponding to any two atomic states. 
Transitions from the ground state of a molecule to an excited state usually occur 
from a bonding orbital (a or 1r electron) or a non-binding orbital (n electron) to an 
antibonding a* or 1r* orbital. In Table 4.5 are listed the electronic transitions for 
some common high polymers as given by [13]. If an electronic excitation of a net-
work chain occurs, it leads to decreased bond energies. This will reduce the mechanical 
stability of a loaded polymeric network and thus contribute to chain scission, frac-
ture initiation or facilitated crack propagation. It is readily seen from Table 4.5,

however, that the energy values of the lowest lying excited states are larger than 
that of any C-C bond. One does not expect, therefore, that the recombination of 
any chain radicals will lead to energy quanta which are large enough to cause elec-
tronic excitation of the reacting radicals or of neighboring molecules. 
2. Ionization 
The complete removal of an electron from a molecule, Le. the ionization, requires 
more energy than electron excitation and has an even stronger effect on the dissocia-
tion energy. In Table 4.6 the dissociation and ionization potentials of the first few 
hydrocarbons have been collected from various sources. It is assumed that ioniza-
tion is first accomplished through removal of the least bound electron from the 
highest occupied orbital and also that this orbital embraces the whole molecule.

4. Strength of Primary Bonds 
The dissociation energies D(R J - R;) in the last column of Table 4.6 can be cal-
culated from the ionization energies according to the relation 
(4.22) 
The values derived in that (indirect) way are given in parenthesis because of the 
ambiguities that are still involved in obtaining the ionization potentials from elec-
tron impact or photo ionization efficiency measurements. For the molecules listed 
here it is clearly apparent that the dissociation energies of the positive molecular 
ions are much smaller than those of the non-ionized molecule. (It should be noted 
that the dissociation energies of excited states are not necessarily always smaller 
than those of the corresponding ground states. But in the organic compounds here of 
interest dissociation energies are reduced by electron removal.) 
It has been emphasized here that the ionization should lead to a positive molec-
ular or radical ion because the electronic energy of negative ions may be quite dif-
ferent. These differences are not expected and not explained in molecular orbital 
theory. If no electron repulsion term is explicitely introduced then the same amount 
of energy will be predicted for the removal of an electron and for placing an electron 
onto such an orbital. These differences can be quite considerable. For H2 the state 
H+ + H- lies above the state H + H by an amount of 12.8 eV (1230 kllmol). The 
energy difference between Ri + R2 and R J + R2 is given by I(Rd -E' (R2) where 
E' (R2) is the electron affinity of R2 (i.e. the energy which is released when the 
atom or radical R2 combines with an electron to form a negative ion). As is illustrated 
by Table 4.7 the electron affinities of saturated hydrocarbons are of the order of 
1 eV (96 kllmol) or less, the differences between I(R) and E(R) are of the order 
of 7 eV (672 kllmol) or more. The dissociation of a hydrocarbon molecule R J- R2 
into the two radical ions Rl and R; generally requires an amount of 672 kllmol 
or more in addition to the energy required for homolytic scission into the radicals 
R J and R2. Homolytic chain scission, therefore, is a much more probable mode of 
molecular disintegration (of saturated hydrocarbons) than ionic dissociation. 
3. Radicalization 
The removal of a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon leads to the formation of a 
radical. Its electron distribution differs from the original one near the radical

II. Bond Energies 
C atom. In saturated hydrocarbons the 4 Sp3 hybrid orbitals change to 3 Sp2 hy-
brids. The radical free electron is considered to be located in a completely separated 
1f eigenfunction which has no interaction with the a-system. The strength of a bond 
connecting a C atom with the radicalized C atom, t, is now mainly determined by the 
interaction of an Sp2 with an sp3 hybrid. The energy of a bond formed by an over-
lap of an Sp3 hybrid and an Sp2 hybrid is not smaller than that formed by two Sp3 
hybrids. This is concluded from the dissociation energies of the C-C bonds in 
RCH2-CH2R (337 kJjmol) and RCH2'--C6 Hs (381 kJjmol). The assumption that 
replacing sp3 orbitals by sp2 orbitals in bonds will not reduce the bond energy per 
se is further supported by the observation that the bond energy of the C(sp2)-H 
bond in H2C=CH2 is the same as the value of the C(sp3)-H bond in H3C-CH3 
(436 kJjmol). The increased energy of dissociation of the C(sp2)-H bond in the 
methyl radical (477 kJjmol) leads to a similar conclusion. 
The C-C bonds in Q position to the carbon carrying a free electron are, there-
fore, slightly stronger than the same bonds in the original molecule. The C-C bonds 
in {3 position, however, are adversely affected by the described electronic reorgani-
zation. In thermal or mechanical degradation they are found to break preferentially. 
Reactions involving the scission of a radicalized carbon backbone chain lead to the 
formation of a double bond: 
R1-CHX-CH2-CX-CH2-R2 -+ R1-CHX + CH2=CX-CH2-R2. 
(3 
c< 
The considerable amount of energy gained in transforming a -CH2 -CX- bond 
into a double bond (250-280 kJjmol) should decrease the activation energy of such 
a reaction correspondingly. Kagiya [14] has derived a number of activation energies, 
D, mostly for vinyl polymers. He uses the assumption that D is equal to the heat 
of polymerization, Q, and the activation energy Ep of the propagation reaction: 
D =Q+ Ep. 
(4.23) 
His values are reported in Table 4.8. Again it must be mentioned that a stress-
induced scission reaction may require an energy of activation which is conSiderably 
higher than the listed values of D.

4. Strength of Primary Bonds 
III. Form of Binding Potential 
In Figure 4.1 it was qualitatively indicated how the potential energy of two bonded 
atoms changes with their interatomal distance r. Knowledge of the exact form of 
the interatomal potential could - in principle - be obtained from a calculation of the 
total electronic energy E of a molecule as a function of r. For polyatomic molecules, 
however, E(r) cannot be calculated by any of the mentioned approximation methods 
with reasonable accuracy. So the potential functions are described by empirical, 
phenomenological functions. These functions will, of course, necessarily utilize 
those molecular constants which are otherwise obtainable, e.g. bond length (ro), bond 
stretching force constant, and dissociation energy D. One of these functions is the 
Morse potential function which has the virtue to lead to a solvable SchrOdinger 
Equation: 
v = D exp [-2a(r - ro)] - 2D exp [-a(r - ro)]. 
(4.24) 
The Morse constant a can be expressed through force constant and anharmonici-
ty constant x of the oscillator formed by the bond atoms. The Morse function yields 
the energy eigenvalues of an anharmonic oscillator which are correct within a size-
able range of amplitudes (in the case of H2 for 0.4 < rlro < 1.6). For large r, how-
ever, V becomes progressively too small [8b].

A chain molecule as part of a thermoplastic body is in thermal contact with other 
chains and - at room temperature - constantly in motion. The atoms vibrate and 
take part in the more or less hindered rotations of groups and even of chain seg-
ments. With no external forces acting all molecular entities try to approach - and 
fluctuate around - the most stable positions attainable to them. The action of 
external forces causes - or maintains - displacements of the chain from those 
positions and evokes retractive forces. Let us consider a chain or a bundle of chains 
in thermal contact with the surrounding and at constant volume. The condition 
of thermodynamic stability of such a system is that the free energy 
F= U- TS 
(5.1) 
assume a minimum. The differential changes of the free energy of the system are 
given by the changes of its internal energy U and its entropy S. 
dF= dU - TdS. 
(5.2) 
An increase of U can be effected by heat dQ flowing into the system from the 
outside or by mechanical work dW done onto the system. The change of entropy 
may be split up into a portion -deS which is equal to dQ/T and into the internal 
entropy production diS caused by irreversible processes as for instance by stress 
relaxation or generation of heat through friction: 
87 

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
(S.3) 
From Eq. (S.3) one derives the force f acting upon a chain with end-to-end 
distancer as: 
(aw) 
(aF) 
(ais) 
f= ~ 
V,T = ar V,T +T ~ V,T 
(S.4) 
The uniaxial force on a relaxing chain molecule depends, therefore, on the 
changes of internal energy and entropy associated with a change of its end-to-end 
distance and on the entropy production term (which is always positive). These three 
different force contributions will be examined in the following. 
A. Entropy Elastic Deformation 
The kinetic theory of rubber elasticity was essentially developed between 1930 
and 1943. A detailed description of the development of this theory and its present 
state is given by e.g. the classical treatises of Flory [1] or Treloar [2]. The necessary 
conditions for the occurrence of rubberlike elastic behavior are the presence of a 
long chain molecule possessing internal flexibility (freely rotating links) and the 
absence of strong secondary bonds acting between a segment and surrounding seg-
ments of the same or other chains. The stress-strain relation for a single finite chain 
then is derived from the distribution of chain conformations. Following the treat-
ment of Treloar it will briefly be recalled which chain properties enter the stress-
strain relations and what levels of force are attainded. 
First the conformations of certain idealized chains are considered. For the chain 
of n equal links of length Q joined entirely at random (Le. neglecting valence angles 
and hindrances to internal rotation) the probability distribution p(x, y, z) to find 
a chain end at a point (x, y, z) - if the other end is fixed at the origin - is obtained 
as a Gaussian distribution: 
(S.S) 
The only parameter, b, is the inverse of the most probable chain end separation 
and is under the above conditions .J3/nQ2 . The extended length of the chain is, of 
course, equal to nQ, whereas the average chain end separation (the "root-mean-
square length"....rrz equals Q yn. 
More realistic is the model of the statistically kinked chain with valence angles 
and hindrances to internal rotation. Here the mean square length is derived as: 
;Z = nQ2 1 + cos ex . 1 + a 
1- cos ex 
1 - a 
(S.6) 
where ex is the semi-angle of the cone of bond rotation and a is the mean value of 
cos r/J, r/J being the angk of bond rotation counted with respect to the trans-con-
formation. The ratio r2/nQ2 is called the characteristic ratio. If the rotation of a 
88 

1. Stress-Strain Curve of a Single Chain 
bond is considered to be independent of the position of other bonds and free with-
in its cone of rotation then a is zero. 
A given (hydrocarbon) chain can be treated as a statistically kinked chain with 
valence angles and also as freely jointed chain. The root-mean-square lengths and 
extended lengths of both models correspond to each other then and only then 
when a random link of appropriate length has been used. This "equivalent random 
link" of length Qr is rather short and contains only a few chain atoms. For paraffin-
type chains Treloar obtained a length Qr of 0.377 run, for cis-polyisoprene 0.352 nm. 
These equivalent random links are about two times smaller than the (shortest) seg-
ment lengths necessary to form a fold of 1800 • 
The entropy S of a single chain is according to Eq. (5.5) and the Boltzmann 
relation 
(5.7) 
where C 1 is a constant. An important aspect of the entropy of a chain is - in the 
words of Treloar [2a] -: "A chain does not possess an entropy by the mere fact 
of having a specified conformation, but only on the virtue of the large number of 
conformations accessible to it under specified conditions of restraint". If these 
conditions consist only in the location of the end-points of the chain at specified 
positions, then the appropriate expression for the entropy is Eq. (5.7). In the 
presence of external hindrances to bond rotation the entropy of a chain is not given 
by Eq. (5.7) since p(x, y, z) must then be corrected for the number of inaccessible 
states. 
The retractive force / acting between the chain ends - and in the direction of 
the line joining them - is derived from Eqs. (5.2), (5.4) and (5.7). If one considers 
a reversible deformation and postulates that all conformational states posses the 
same internal energy U so that U does not depend on conformation then 
/=2kTb 2 r. 
(5.8) 
The random coil in thermal equilibrium behaves as a spring (of length zero) 
with a spring constant 2 kT b2 . The level of force exerted by such a spring with its 
ends separated by the most probable distance r = lib is fairly small. For a hydro-
carbon chain of molecular weight 14'000 with an extended length of 125.5 nm 
and a most probable chain end distance of 7 nm, this force is 17 . 10-13 N which 
corresponds to a force per cross-section of the chain, //q, of 10 MN/m2 
(l08 dyn/cm2). As one should expect this "chain stress" is very close to the 
modulus G = NkT of a rubber network having chains of exactly this length between 
crosslink points and for which Gis 17.5 MN/m2 . 
The Gaussian theory considers the number of possible conformations of a chain 
having a specified end-to-end distance. A more accurate non-Gaussian statistical 
treatment of the random chain is based on the distribution of sin 8 1 , i.e. of the 
angle between the direction of a random link and of the end-to-end vector. From 
the probability of finding nl links in the range bo8 1 , n2 in bo82 and so on, the 
entropy of a single chain is derived [2b] as

It is of special interest to note that this stress-strain relation can also be derived 
from a consideration of the potential energy of the statistical links in a unidirectional 
force field. James and Guth [3] and Flory [1] have used the fact that an amount of 
work of f . Q (1 - cos ei) must be performed to rotate a link from a position of 
e = 0 to e = ei ; if the orientational energy -f Q cos ei is distributed according to 
Boltzmann statistics then the mean extension of a link in the direction of force is 
Zi = Q..2"'(fQ/kT) 
(5.12) 
and the mean total chain end-to-end distance is 
r = nZj = nQ..2'" (fQ/kT) 
(5.13) 
which by inversion directly yields Eq. (5.10). It should be pointed out that so far this 
result has been derived without introducing - or permitting - any internal or 
external hindrances to rotation of a link. The absence of external hindrances also 
means that in longitudinal extension or contraction of the chain or of parts thereof 
no frictional forces are encountered. The forces exerted by the chain ends are solely 
the consequence of the imbalance of exchange of momentum between the chain 
and its surrounding. 
If a hydrocarbon chain behaves as described by Eq. (5.13) and if such a chain 
were to reach a breaking force (of, say, 17 . 10-10 N) at room temperature then 
fQ/kT must exceed 150. For an argument that large the Langevin function is equal 
to 1 -kTIfQ andfis: 
f= nkT(nQ - r). 
(5.14) 
In the chosen example of a hydrocarbon chain of 125.5 nm extended length, 
breaking stresses will only be reached if r is larger than 124.7 nm. In other words only 
2 of the 333 random links of 0.377 om length may point in a direction perpendic-
ular to the chain end-to-end vector while all the remaining ones then have to be 
fully aligned. Even at this extreme elongation the Langevin function gives a good 
approximation of the stress-strain behavior of the randomly kinked chain. This 
90 

I. Stress-Strain Curve of a Single Chain 
becomes evident by comparison with the so called exact solution of Treloar [2c] 
which is purely based on geometrical (and combinatorial) considerations and from 
which one derives for extreme elongations: 
f= -kT dl2np/dr = -kT/r + (n-2) kT/(nQ-r). 
(5.15) 
The force-elongation relations (5.8), (5.10), and (5.15) have been derived under 
the condition that all conformational states have the same internal energy, that all 
states are accessible, and that transitions between different states are easily accom-
plished. No chain molecule - and especially not within a solid - does fully comply 
with the above conditions. For one thing there are the intramolecular interactions 
(between nearest and second nearest atoms of one chain) which cause the potential 
energy of the chain to be a function of the angle of rotation with distinct relative 
minima in more than one position. All this is well known and documented (e.g. 1-5) 
and will not be discussed here. The direct or indirect consequences with respect to 
the retractive forces between (PE or PA) chain ends are the following: 
-
the internal energy of (in-plane) trans-conformations is lower than that of (out-
of plane) gauche-conformations 
-
the probability to find a conformation with internal energy LlU is weighted by 
the Boltzmann factor exp (-LlU/kT) 
-
the average end-to-end distance increases with a according to Eq. (5.6), the 
length Q ofthe equivalent random link also grows in proportion to (1 +a)/(1 -a), 
while the number n of random links in a chain of finite length decreases 
the force between chain ends at their most probable distance (r = lib) is in-
versely proportional to r and thus also to the square root of the characteristic 
ratio, the force is the smaller the larger the characteristic ratio is. 
The characteristic ratio of PE at room temperature is - according to Abe 
et al. [4] - 8.0 as compared to a value of 2 calculated under neglect of hindrances 
to bond rotation. The force between PE chain ends, therefore, is by a factor of 2 
smaller if the effect of the potential energy on chain conformation is taken into 
consideration. For polyamide chains the detailed calculations of Flory and Williams 
[5] led to characteristic ratios of 6.08 (PA 6) and 6.10 (pA 66) in excellent agree-
ment with the experimental value of 5.95 for PA 66 found by Saunders [6]. The 
calculated force between PA chain ends, then, will be smaller by a factor of about 
1.7. 
A second cause to invalidate Eq. (5.7) are strong intermolecular interactions 
between chain segments which do have the effect that only a restricted number of 
conformational states are accessible to a chain segment, that transitions between 
different states may not be independent from each other, and that energy is required 
to activate these (cooperative) transitions. In recent years considerable progress has 
been made to apply the methods of statistical thermodynamics also to systems 
subject to the above restrictions and to explain e.g. their dynamic stress-strain 
behavior [7] or their melting and crystallisation [8]. With respect to chain loading 
one is interested in the entropy changes associated with the elongation of a highly 
extended chain. In the following LlS will be calculated for PE and PA chain segments 
of 3 to 6 nm length. 
91 

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
It is convenient to start with Pechhold's [7] treatment of the polyethylene 
molecule. He derived the partition function of the rotational isomers of a chain 
with n independent C-C bonds. The chain is allowed to rotate around its C-C 
bonds, it will, therefore, encounter three minima of potential energy of which the 
absolute minimum belongs to the extended trans-conformation (t). Two relative 
minima at an angle ± 1200 out of plane allow two gauche-conformations (g,g) 
with a conformational energy of + ~U. The kink-isomers are the subclass of the 
rotational isomers where only n/2 of the bonds - and no adjacent ones - may have 
a g or g position. For kink isomers entropy, internal energy, and free energy as a 
function of the average concentration x of gauche-conformations are derived [7] 
as: 
x = exp (-~U/kT) / [1 + 2 exp (-~U/kT)] 
S = - 0.5 nk Qn (1 - 2x) + oX ~U/T 
U =nx ~U 
F = 0.5 nkT Qn (1 - 2x). 
(5.16) 
(5.17) 
(5.18) 
(5.19) 
The group of kink isomers still comprises chains with quite different deviations 
from a planar zig-zag conformation, the simplest of those kinks being ttgtgttt 
(2gl kink), tgttgt (2g2 kink), tgtgtgt (3g2 kink). Each kink causes a contraction 
in longitudinal direction which is a multiple & of Y2f3 a with a the length of a C-C 
bond (pechhold accordingly denotes a kink containing q gauche positions and 
causing a contraction & as a qg ~z-kink). A chain with n C-C bonds and mi qgi-
kinks has a projected length in z-direction of (n - imi) Y2f3 a. Vice versa a pro-
jected length corresponding to that of n C-C bonds can be realized as well by an 
extended chain with n C-C bonds, by a chain with n + 1 bonds containing a 2gl 
kink, by chains with n + 2 bonds containing either two 2g1 kinks or a 2g2 kink or 
by other appropriate combinations. The statistical weight of each conformation is 
given by the number of ways that conformation can be realized and by the Boltz-
mann factor of its conformational energy. The by far leading term in the partition 
function for a given r is always that listing the number of possible conformations 
of chains containing only 2g1 kinks. The number of ways of arranging ng/2 pairs of 
g and g bonds on n/2 available positions clearly is 
ng/2 (n 
) 
Z (n, ng) = 2ng/2.1T

(5.20) 
In Table 5.1 the statistical weights ofPE chains with a gauche-concentration of 
up to 20% are given according to Eq. (5.20). Also listed are the statistical weights 
of 6 PA chains subject to the condition that the two gauche positions of anyone 
gtgt kink are confined to the (six) C-C bonds of one monomeric unit and that the 
carbonamide group adheres to a trans-planar conformation [5]. As potential energy 
~U of a gauche position the "preferred value of 0.5 kcal/mol" [5] has been used. 
The change of Qn Z (n, i) with r is essentially the same as the change of the 
complete partition function (which accounts for mgi-kinks of all types). One can cal-

culate, therefore, from the data of Table 5.1 the entropy elastic contribution to the 
retractive force as - kT Ll Qn (Z)/Llr. The energy elastic contribution, fe, derives 
here from the change of conformational energy and is LlngLlU/Llr. For the chosen 
examples of a PE chain with 40 C-C bonds, a 6 PA chain of 6 monomer units and 
gauche energies LlU of 0.5 and 0.75 keal/mol one obtains the force contributions 
listed in Table 5.2. For comparison the forces derived for the statistieally kinked 
chain according to the Langevin and the "exact" approximation are also given. It 
is immediately apparent that in kink isomers the energy-elastic contribution fe is 
of the same order of magnitude - and opposite sign - as the entropy-elastic force. 
The molecular stresses, 'l!, are obtained by dividing the axial forces f through the 
molecular cross-section q, whereas the elastic moduli are understood as: 
E = r Llf/ Mq. 
(5.21) 
This investigation may be summarized by saying that the retractive forces ex-
perienced by highly extended chain segments at room temperature due to confor-
mational changes are small in comparison to the ultimate forces that can be carried 
by a chain. External hindrances to segment rotation have not been treated here. At 
present is suffices to state that they will only further diminish the -already - small 
entropy elastic forces. 
B. Energy Elastic Chain Deformation 
So far the energy-elastic deformation of the (assumedly rigid) chain skeleton has 
not been considered. In response to axial forces the chain skeleton will deform,

however, through hindered rotation, bending, and stretching of main chain bonds 
(9). In Table 5.3 the stiffnesses characterizing these individual modes of deforma-
tion and their combination in a loaded chain are listed. The C-C bond bending and 
stretching moduli have been calculated from the corresponding force constants. The 
modulus for the hindered rotation of a kinked chain is derived from the rotational 
potential of CH2 groups and the associated axial chain elongation as formulated 
by Pechhold [7] who used an intramolecular rotational barrier of 2 kcal/mol above 
gauche energy. The resulting modulus is a function of the angle of rotation and 
ranges between 4 and 7 GN/m2 in good agreement with a value of Bowden [10] 
of 5.7 GN/m2. In axial stretching the hindered rotation of gauche bonds contributes 
to axial elongation, the chain stiffness thus decreases with the concentration of gauche 
bonds. 
Longitudinal chain moduli, defined as in Eq. (5.21), have been determined 
theoretically and experimentally in a number of ways: 
through calculation from spectroscopically determined bond bending and stretch-
ing constants 
from the Raman shifts of extended chain hydrocarbons 
from x-ray observations of load-induced changes of the unit cell dimensions in 
highly oriented polymers. 
These methods, their results, and the arguments to explain a certain disagreement 
between the numerical results have been reviewed by e.g. Sauer and Woodward [9]. 
More recently the direct calculation of the total ( electronic) energy (of a PE chain) 
with changing atomic geometry has been attempted by Boudreaux [11]. In his self-
consistent field molecular orbital (SCF - MO) calculations he searched for "that 
set of numbers which, when used as coefficients of the assigned atomic orbitals, 
produces an approximation to the wave function which minimizes the total energy". 
Hahn et al. [14] presently investigate a model based on the elastic interaction of 
essentially rigid sp3 valence tetrapods (shell-model). 
From Table 5.3 it is apparent that the weakest mode of skeleton deformation 
(4.7 GN/m2) is that derived from the hindered rotation of (non-extended) bonds 
whereas a fully extended chain segment has a 50 times larger stiffness. The elastic 
modulus of a partially extended kinked chain, then, is: 
I/E = ~ xdEi 
i 
(5.22) 
where the Ei are the stiffnesses of the individual (trans-planar, kinked, or helical) 
segments of a chain and the Xi are the corresponding (volume) fractions. 
One is now in a position to determine the change of the free energy F of a 
partly extended chain as a function of the end-to-end distance r. As an example 
the quasi-static deformation of PE segments will be treated within the frame of 
the bond-bending and stretching model. The minimum free energy of a segment 
containing n C-C bonds and nk 2g1 kinks is attained at an end-to-end distance 
r = (n - nk)V2f3 a. This minimum free energy is equal to nk ~U-RT Qn Z. From 
the statistical weight of the (n, nk) conformations of PE segments with n = 40 
(Table 5.1) the minimum free energy values have been calculated. They are indicated 
in Figure 5.1 at the proper chain-end distances. If the chain ends are axially dis-

placed from these equilibrium positions energy elastic forces arise which have an 
unsymmetric potential. In stretching completely extended sections the trans bonds 
are deformed in the plane of the zig-zag chain according to the chain modulus Estr • 
The gauche bonds are performing a hindered rotation out of the zig-zag plane 
(Erat). The stretching modulus E of the kinked segment then is derived from 
Eq. (5.22). The chain is the stiffer the fewer gauche bonds it contains. Employing 
the rotation potential mentioned above [7] and an extended chain modulus of 
200 GN/m2 the tensile sections of the free energy curves have been calculated. The 
presence of only 5 kinks softens the chain segment quite noticeably (E decreases 
to 9.5 GN/m2). 
The axial compression of an extended chain differs in so far as the trans bonds 
now aquire the freedom to perform a hindered rotation out of the zig-zag plane. 
This freedom is not exercised in tension because it would be energetically less 
favorable than bond bending and stretching. The axial compression modulus of a 
zig-zag chain is essentially determined by the hindered rotation mode of deforma-
tion, it corresponds to the extension modules of a highly kinked chain (nk = n/4) 
and has been taken to be 5 GN/m2. 
For each conformational state an asymmetric parabola is obtained. In quasi-
static straining an individual, kinked chain will tend to assume that state of minimum 
free energy accessible to it. Transitions between different conformational states will 
occur (solid line in Fig. 5.1). The transition to a more extended conformation will 
cause an immediate release of axial stress for the chain segment in question - and 
97 

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
thus constitute a thermodynamically irreversible process. Macroscopically the step-
wise and uncorrelated release of stress in a large number of chains is felt as stress 
relaxation. The random thermal motion of chain atoms and the existence of ex-
ternal hindrances to bond rotation are the reason that the deformation potentials 
of individual chain segments deviate from each other and from the solid line - as 
arbitrarily indicated by the heavy dashed line. The deformation potential shown 
in Figure 5.1 essentially represents also that of other (planar) zig-zag chains such 
as PA 6 or 66 which have the same kind and concentration of gauche bonds and 
about the same length. 
C. Non-Equilibrium Response 
The stress-induced conformational transitions of a kinked chain as represented by 
the solid line in Figure 5.1 are thermodynamically irreversible, internal energy is 
converted into heat. At this point one is interested in the time-constant of the tran-
sition process: if it is small compared to the time within which chain stretching is 
accomplished then the stress-strain curve will not deviate very much from the solid 
line, if the time constant is extremely large then transitions may be considered to 
be impossible, the chains deform energy-elastically. In the intermediate region of 
time constants, however, the largest stresses of not fully extended chains will depend 
on the rate at which stress releasing conformational transitions take place. A detailed dis-
cussion of this effect would require a consideration of the geometry and interaction 
of molecular chains, of the principles of irreversible thermodynamics [15], and analy-
sis of the potential of the secondary or van der Waal's bonds between segments 
[16]. It would then lead to a description of the anelastic deformation of polymers 
which is not intended in this book. Nevertheless one is still interested in some in-
formation with respect to the rate of stress relieving transitions between different 
kink-isomers. Since any transitions leading to the motion of just a single kink gene-
rally do not cause any axial chain elongation one has at least to consider the simul-
taneous activation and annihilation of two kinks. Such process involves the rotation 
of four gauche bonds and the rotational translation of the segment between the 
kinks, the energy of activation can be estimated to be 8 kcal/mol for the rotation 
of gauche bonds [7] and 0.5 to 1.2 kcal per mol of rotating CH2 groups to overcome 
the intermolecular barriers [17, 18]. A tgtgttg tgt-kink requires, therefore, an acti-
vation energy of 11 to 15.2 kcal/mol to transform into the all-trans conformation. 
One may assume that in stress-free PE chains such transformations do occur with 
a rate of at least 1 S-l at a temperature somewhat below the melting point, i.e. at 
400 K. One may then calculate the rate of this process at 300 K from Eq. (3.22) 
as 0.0018 s-l . If the chain is strained the activation energy for segment rotation 
only decreases and the rate of stress relieving transitions increases [19]. With such 
a time-scale one may consider stress-induced rotational transitions as being easily 
accomplished before a chain segment reaches elastic energies sufficient for chain 
scission at room temperature, i.e. more than 25 kcal/mol. 
It remairls the entropy production term in Eq. (5.4) to be discussed. Under 
the conditions of this section - quasi-static axial loading of the ends of a segment 
and determination of the ensuing retractive forces - this term is essentially zero.

A. Secondary or van der Waal's Bonds 
In Section A the stress-strain behavior of a single chain segment loaded pointwise at 
its ends has been discussed. In (uncross-linked) thermoplastic polymers, however, 
large axial forces cannot be applied pointwise to a main chain bond but only be 
built up gradually along the chain through - the much weaker - intermolecular 
forces. The forces between molecules are a superposition of the close range (nucle-
onic) repulsion and the (electronic) van der Waal's attraction, which includes elec-
trostatic forces between ions, dipoles or quadrupoles, induction forces due to polari-
zation of atoms and molecules, and the generally most important quantum-chemical 
dispersion forces. The van der Waal's attraction is the cause of the solidification and 
crystallization of high polymers, it is theoretically quite well understood and has 
been treated in detail by Langbein [16]. With reference to this work and the general 
references in Chapter 1 it can be stated that the secondary forces are not saturated 
and are nondirectional, i.e. not confined to precise locations of the neighbor atoms 
at e.g. tetrahedral bond angles. To the extent that these assumptions are valid the 
potential of the intermolecular forces acting on a chain or segment can be replaced 
by the sum of the interaction potentials of all appropriate pairs of atoms. The pair 
potentials contain an attractive term - which is theoretically derivable and decreases 
with the 6th power of the interatomal distance [16] and a repulsive term for which 
only semi-empirical expressions can be given. The total energy of intermolecular 
interaction, i.e. the cohesive energy of a solid then is to be understood as the sum of 
the pair interactions. In thermodynamic equilibrium a chain segment attains' a position 
such that the free energy of interaction is a minimum. If a chain segment is displaced 
with respect to this position the free energy is raised and retractive forces ari&e. Such 
axial displacements are realized in quasi-static pulling a chain segment which is part 
of a crystal lamella against the crystal lattice or of extended chains against a glassy 
matrix. Dynamic chain stretching occurs in the shear deformation of molecules in 
solution or the melt. In the following it will be discussed which level of axial chain 
stress can be attained in these cases, that is in the loading of primary bonds through 
secondary or van der Waal's forces. 
B. Static Displacements of Chains Against Crystal Lattices 
The first investigations of the loading of chains displaced with respect to their 
equilibrium positions within a crystal lattice have been carried out by Chevychelov 
[20]. He used a continuum approach, i.e. replaced the string of discrete chain atoms 
by a continuous mass distribution. Each mass point experiences a periodic repulsive 
crystal potential if displaced from its equilibrium position. Later Kausch and Lang-
bein [21] and Kausch and Becht [22] extended these calculations to treat the static 
and dynamic interaction of chains of discrete atoms with arbitrary periodic poten-
tials.

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
The model used in these investigations is represented by Figure 5.2. It consists 
of a tie molecule (t) which forms part of a crystal lamella ( c), leaves it perpendicular. 
ly to the crystal fold surface, (I), extends straightly through an amorphous region 
(a) and enters the adjacent crystallite of which it forms a part. The crystal boundaries 
are assumed to be ideally sharp. No interaction between the tie chain and the amor· 
phous material outside of the crystallite is taken into account.

a = amorphous region, Lo = length of

A tie molecule thus embedded in two different crystalline layers is streched if 
the crystal lamellae are separated by macroscopic stresses. Because of the large elastic 
modulus of the chain molecule very high axial stresses are exerted onto the chain 
if it experiences the same strain as its amorphous vicinity. This high axial stress 
tends to pull the tie molecule against the intracrystalline potential and out of the 
crystal lamella. 
In the following calculations the assumedly rigid solid is represented by an 
interaction potential the depth of which corresponds to two times the average 
(lateral) cohesive energy U with which the chain segments are bound within lamellar 
crystals or amorphous regions. Upon axial displacement in z·direction ( chain axis) 
a chain will rotate and translate along a temperature· dependent minimum energy 
path. For polyethylene (PE) Lindenmeyer [17] has given the maximum potential 
energy to be overcome by a CH2 group in twisted translation as LlUtt = 500 cal/mol 
at room temperature. The potential energy of a CH2 group within the amorphous 
phase can be determined from the difference of the enthalpies of crystalline and 
amorphous PE at absolute zero temperature, Ham, 0 
- Her, 0 = 661 cal/mol [23]. 
It should also be taken into account that the internal energy of a partly oriented 
PE may be smaller than that of an amorphous one. The energy difference will be 
comparable to the enthalpy difference (Ham - Hder), which was estimated by 
Fischer and Hinrichsen [24] to be 140 cal/mol. As function of its z'position within 
an otherwise undisturbed crystal a CH2 group would encounter a potential energy 
as shown in Figure 5.3. 
Each point along a tie chain is characterized by its distance z from the crystal 
boundary, where z refers to the unstressed situation. The displacement of the molec' 
ular point z under stress is denoted by u = u (z) and the crystal potential per unit

ing at the crystal boundary (z = 0). In Figure 5.4 tension and displacement of aPE 
chain within a PE crystallite are shown for maximum axial chain tension So equal 
to 1.372 oN. For any force larger than So no static equilibrium can be established 
within a defect-free crystallite. It should be noted that this force which pulls out of 
the crystal a chain of full crystal length is 15.8 times larger than the force" v d 
which is necessary to pullout a single monomer unit. If the tension So is divided

II. Axial Mechanical Excitation of Chains 
by the chain cross-section (0.1824 run2) one arrives at the maximum axial stress 
which a perfect PE crystallite is able to exert on a tie molecule: 7.5 GN/m2. As can 
be seen from Figure 5.4, the maximum mechanical excitation of a chain penetrates 
about 5 run into the crystallite. At a distance of 6 run from the crystal boundary it 
is smaller than the average thermal amplitude at room temperature, which is about 
0.008nm. 
Kausch and Langbein [21] extended the above calculations to various boundary 
conditions at the lower stress end, -Z, of the chain. If the chain terminates at -Z 
or continues into the adjacent amorphous region, it experiences no or only very weak 
axial forces. This case is covered by putting A < v/". If, on the other hand, a stressed 
tie-chain folds back at -Z, any axial displacement there implies a deformation of 
the fold. Such a deformation entails a considerable distortion of the crystal lattice 
and requires strong axial forces. In this case the integration constant A generally 
becomes larger than v/". After having derived the equations necessary for describing 
the elastic interaction between a chain and a crystal - represented by one unique 
potential- for arbitrary boundary conditions the authors [21] took into account 
also the fact that in a crystal containing hydrogen bonds - like that of 6-polyamide -
the intermolecular interaction differs in different crystal regions. It is much stronger 
at the sites of C=O and N-H chain groups than it is at the sites of CH2 groups. The 
problem of calculating the elastic displacement of a continuous chain passing through 
alternating regions of strong and weak attraction can be solved through alternate 
application of appropriate boundary conditions. In this case the boundary condition 
is that chain displacement and chain tension are continuous at all points Zj where 
the potential changes from weak attraction (v = vd to strong attraction (v = V2) 
or vice versa (refer to Fig. 5.5 for notation). Here it was assumed that the difference

between the cohesive energies Ucoh ofPA (18.4 kcal/mol) and PE (6.3 kcal/mol) is 
caused by the presence of hydrogen bonds between the carbonamide groups of 
neighboring molecules within the grid planes of the ( monoclinic) P A crystallites. 
This excess energy contributes to the intermolecular potential V2 acting between 
carbonamide groups. The potential V2 thus is (12.1 + 0.50) kcal/mol, which is 
equivalent to 0.369 nN.

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
Chain tension and displacement of a 6-PA tie molecule within a 6-PA crystal 
are shown in Figure 5.6. The strong attractive effect of the hydrogen bonds results 
in a rapid drop of chain tension at the position of the carbonamide groups. The de-
crease of both tension and displacement is much more rapid than in the case of PE. 
At a distance of 2.1 nm from the crystal boundary the displacement has already 
dropped to the average level of thermal vibration at room temperature. With the 
crystal boundary positioned - as shown in Figure 5.6 - at the end of a (-CH2 -)5 
segment the maximum chain tension is So = 3.94 nN. This tension is only 1.7 times 
the force necessary to remove one carbonamide group from the crystal, i.e. 59% 
of the maximum chain tension is expended to break the hydrogen bonds of the

first CONH group. It should be noted that the value of So depends upon the geometric 
arrangement of the atoms at the crystal boundary. With a carbonamide group at the 
crystal boundary the maximum tension So is about 20% smaller than in the case 
where the crystal boundary runs through the middle of the (-CH2 - h segment [21]. 
If So is divided by the molecular cross section (0.176 nm2) a stress of 22.4 GN/m2 
is obtained, which may be termed the static strength of a perfect (monoclinic) 
6-PA crystal. 
The above strength values have been derived for the interaction between a periodic 
potential and a continuous elastic chain. Kausch and Langbein [21] have shown, how-
ever, that there are only insignificant changes if the model using a continuous chain 
is replaced by the more accurate one using a string of discrete atoms.

II. Axial Mechanical Excitation of Chains 
C. Thermally Activated Displacements of Chains· Against Crystal Lattices 
As stated repeatedly crystal and chain are in thermal motion; the chain atoms, there-
fore, vibrate around the new equilibrium positions z + u given e.g. by Eq. (5.28). 
The effect of the correlated or uncorrelated motion of the chain atoms on the inter-
molecular potential energy can be calculated if the dispersion of vibrational ampli-
tudes along the chain is known [22]. A chain subjected to maximum tension So 
is not resistant to translation. Even the smallest thermal vibration will cause further 
displacement of the chain and a decrease in axial tension at the boundary. The point 
of maximum tension will rapidly propagate into the crystallite (Fig. 5.7). The "dis-

location" is fully developed once Ua has reached the value of d. The energy W d of 
the defect introduced into the crystal by displacement of the atoms of one chain 
is easily calculated as the sum of the potential energies of the chain atoms and of 
the elastic chain energy. Both are a function of external tension. In Figure 5.8 the 
dislocation energy has been plotted as a function of displacement Ua and tension 
sa at the crystal boundary. The energy of a completed defect (displacement of the 
chain by d) in PE amounts to 32.85 kcal/mol. At tensions smaller than So the dis-
placements Ua are smaller than d/2, the defect energy is smaller than W d(SO)' and 
the defect has a stable position. At displacements larger than d/2 the system becomes 
unstable since the chain tension decreases with increasing displacement ua. 
As shown in Figure 5.8, transitions between the stable and the unstable state 
can be caused by thermal activation. The required activation energy Ud is given by 
(5.30) 
In Table 5.4 the activation energies required for translation of CH2 -CH2 seg-
ments are listed for various displacements Ua and tensions sa. One observes that 
at chain tensions which are as little as 4% less than the maximum tension still an 
activation energy for chain translation of 9.8 kcal/mol is required. One may safely

state, therefore, that even under consideration of longitudinal chain vibrations 
chain translation will occur at chain tensions close to the specified values. 
D. Chain Displacements Against Randomly Distributed Forces 
The rupture of chains in amorphous matrices or in solution clearly indicates that 
large axial forces can also be reached in the absence of periodic potentials. Again 
forces derive from the displacement of chains or of parts thereof with respect to 
the surrounding matrix. If one divides a non-extended chain into small sections of 
identical projected lengths one will obtain sections of quite different conformation. 
As well the sectional chain moduli Ei as - most probably - the interaction poten-
tials Vi = -Wi' Uj2/2 will vary from section to section. To obtain the axial displace-
ment of an arbitrary sequence of chain sections an interpolation given by Kausch 
and Langbein [21] may be used who have found that the changes of chain stress a 
and displacement u within a heterogeneous matrix are interpolated by an exponen-
tiallaw: 
u = Uo exp "1 z/L 
(5.31) 
(5.32) 
The chain stress is derived from Eq. (5.24) replacing the chain elasticity constant 
I<. by the elastic constant of a series of elastic elements 
(5.33) 
The above equation shows quantitatively that large chain stresses will only be 
obtained ifthe interaction force constants Wi are of about the same order they are 
in a crystal and if the elastic moduli of the chain sections are large throughout. One 
"weak" section will greatly enhance average displacement and reduce the stress. It 
should also be mentioned that it is not the chain length L and the absolute number 
n of interaction sites which raise the chain stress but the intensity of the interaction 
forces per unit chain length. 
As an example of the static excitation of a chain under these conditions a nearly 
extended chain of end-to-end distance L embedded in a glassy matrix may be con-
sidered. If the matrix (index m) and the chain (no index) were homogeneously 
strained in chain axis direction they would experience the following stresses: 
and 
(5.34) 
(5.35)

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
Due to the different elastic response the free chain would have to act against 
the lattice potential until chain stress and lattice interaction were in equilibrium at 
any point of the chain. This interaction can be described by identically the same 
mathematical formalism developed above. Since the chain ends are assumed to be 
free they cannot bear any axial stresses. This condition will exactly be met if one 
superimposes the hypothetical stress a (Eq. 5.35) by a compressive stress according 
to Eq. (5.33) where 
Uo = €mL/r. 
(5.36) 
The largest stresses will be found in the center section of the strained chain and 
here the superposition yields: 
€m L 
a(L/2) = ~ L-!E. [1 - exp (-'Y/2)].

1 
(5.37) 
The distribution of axial stresses along the chain is characterized by the two 
stress-free chain ends, two terminal sections of length L/r where the stress increases 
with a rate determined by 'Y/L, and a central chain segment subjected to the maximum 
stress given by Eq. (5.37). The continuous straining of a chain segment through in-
teraction with (harmonic) lattice potentials - as required for the terminal sections -
is limited to a section of finite length because the largest displacement u may not 
exceed the range of validity of the intermolecular potential which is of the order 
of 0.1 nm. For breaking stresses of 20 GN/m2 to be reached under such a condition 
the constant 'Y/L must be larger than 0.01 nm and the average chain modulus at 
these loads must be that of a fully extended chain; since the displacements of PE 
and 6 P A chains within their rigid crystal lamellae led to 'Y /L-values of 0.004 and 
0.015 nm respectively [22] one is forced to the conclusion that the displacements 
of extended chains within the less tightly packed random aggregates of misaligned 
chains can only lead to smaller than the above values of 'Y/L. If chain scission were 
to occur under the above static conditions it would require a sufficiently stable 
physical crosslinking of the (then non-extended) terminal chain sections to the 
matrix through folds or kinks. 
E. Dynamic loading of a chain 
So far the quasi-static interaction between a chain and a surrounding matrix has 
been investigated. It has been indicated that the level of axial forces to be obtained 
in that manner is limited by the occurrence of chain slip. In dynamic loading these 
force levels can be exceeded if frictional forces or forces of inertia become effective. 
If the chain displacement does not occur in static equilibrium and not through 
a single thermally excited step then the translation will not occur reversibly along 
a path of least energy but will require more energy than in the previous cases. The 
rate-dependent energy expended per unit distance of forced translation of a chain 
segment i is equivalent to a frictional shearing force ri. The response of chains to 
108 

II. Axial MechamCai t.xcltauon 01 \.-mllns 
shearing forces in solution has extensively been investigated and discussed [25]. A 
number of different molecular theories of the viscoelastic behavior of polymer chains 
in solution have been developed. These predict a relation between e.g. molecular 
weight M (or degree of polymerisation P), solvent viscosity 1]s, intrinsic viscosity 
[1]] = lim (1] -1]s)/C1]s, molecular friction coefficient ~o, and mean square end-to-end 
distance r5. Following the bead spring model of Rouse [25] one obtains 
(5.38) 
The quantity ~ ° 
represents the frictional force encountered by each monomeric 
unit within the chain which is moved with unit velocity through its surrounding. 
The sectional force fi' therefore, is: 
(5.39) 
In the case of additivity of all sectional forces and in a homogeneous shear field 
one obtains the following distribution of axial stress 1/1 within a chain of length L: 
(5.40) 
The largest stresses are encountered in the middle (z = 0) and amount to 
(5.41) 
Equation (5.41) predicts that for a given system (~o, Lmon, Mo) axial stresses 
are proportional to shear strain and square of molecular weight. Chain rupture 
occurs if 1/1max reaches or exceeds the chain strength 1/1b resulting in a gradual 
decrease of M. The decrease of the average molecular weight diminishes if M ap-
proaches the limiting value M(oo) which is derived from Eq. (5.41) for the chain 
strength 1/1b. The Eqs. (5.41), (5.38), and (5.6) together predict that [1]] € M(oo) is 
constant for a given polymer/solvent system. Kadim [26] obtained for a 0.5 to 
1 % solution of PIB in decalin [1]] 7 M(oo) = 1.34 kJ/mol. He employed shear rates 
between 25 and 700 S-I. Abdel-Alim et al. [27] report on a relation of 7°·41 M(oo) = 
= const. for a 2% solution of polyacrylamide in water subjected to shear rates of 
between 3000 and 100000 S-I. 
Within more concentrated solutions the physical-chemical behavior of long 
chains (size and interpenetration of molecular coils, kinetics of entanglement forma-
tion) seems to be much more important than the rheological behavior characterized 
by ~ ° 
and €. A striking demonstration of this fact was given by Breitenbach, Rigler 
and Wolf [28], who prepared solutions of 3.6 to 14.2% by weight of polystyrene 
in cyclohexane. These systems showed a concentration-dependent phase separation 
at a temperature Ttr between 26.4 and 29.4 °C. Shearing these solutions at a rate 
of 600 S-1 and at temperatures slightly above Ttr they observed a dramatic increase 
in the rate of degradation when approaching Ttr. At Ttr + 11.6 K no noticeable 
109 

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
degradation occurred within 20 h. At Tr + 0.6 K a 13% decrease of the limiting vis-
cosity [11] was measured after one hour already. Within 20 h a reduction of the molec-
ular weight from ~ 7 . 105 g/mol to 1.6 . 105 could be achieved. 
A related subject of growing interest is the ultrasonic degradation of polymers 
in solution. In their recent review Basedow and Ebert [29] summarize that ultrasonic 
chain scission is the result of cavitation, i.e. of the nucleation, growth and collapse 
of (gas-filled) bubbles. Chain scission occurs in the convergent flow fields in the vi-
cinity of collapsing bubbles and through the ensuing shock waves. The properties of 
the solvent do not seem to be of particular importance, but the presence of nuclei 
to initiate cavitation and a minimum intensity of the ultrasonic field (environ 4 W/cm2 ) 
are necessary conditions. Owing to the nature of the degradation process, i.e. to the 
shear loading of chains, the rates of degradation decrease with decreasing molecular 
weight (degree of polymerization) and become infinitely small at a so-called limiting 
molecular weight. For polystyrene in tetrahydrofuran degraded 88 h at 20 kHz 
Basedow and Ebert cite one limiting molecular weight of 24000 g/mol and a newer 
value of 15000 g/mol. In a quite recent publication Sheth et al. [39] report for the 
same system the appearance of appreciable amounts of polymer material at molecular 
weight of 1000 g/mol or lower in the gel permeation curve of the degraded sample. 
They indicate that the limiting degree of polymerization depends on the initial 
molecular weight distribution and is either much lower than previously reported 
or perhaps non-existent. 
The stresses encountered by a chain displaced with respect to a solid matrix can 
also be described utilizing the concept of the monomeric friction coefficient ~o [25]. 
The implications of such an assumption are discussed in detail by Ferry [25] who 
also lists the numerical values of the monomeric friction coefficients for many high 
polymers. Naturally the coefficients strongly depend on temperature. But even if 
compared at corresponding temperature, e.g. at the individual glass transition tem-
peratures, the monomeric friction coefficients vary with the physical and chemical 
chain structure by 10 orders of magnitude. In the upper region one finds the 
1740 Ns/m for Polymethylacrylate, the 19.5 Ns/m for Polyvinyl acetate, and the 
11.2 Ns/m for Polyvinyl chloride, each at the respective glass transition temperature 
[25]. This means that a PVC segment pulled at 80 °c through a PVC matrix at a 
rate of 0.005 nm/s encounters a shearing force of 0.056 nN per monomeric unit. 
At lower temperatures the molecular friction coefficient increases essentially in pro-
portion to the intensity of the relaxation time spectrum H (T), the increase being 
about one to two orders of magnitude with every 10 K temperature difference [25]. 
If a PVC segment has a length of 2 L = 10 nm and is part of a PVC matrix strained 
at a rate of 0.001 / s at the glass transition temperature it experiences at the center 
an axial force of magnitude 1.1 nN. This force is about as large as that statically 
transferred upon extended PE chains by PE crystallites at room temperature. It 
may be repeated that the above estimate on the level of axial forces is based on the 
assumption that in sample straining an extended chain segment is subjected to shear-
ing forces determined by the monomeric friction coefficients ~ 0 and that the seg-
ment does not relieve axial stresses through conformational changes. Using the same 
assumptions one expects forces up to 206 nN for PMMA and up to 0.01 nN for PS 
each at the respective glass transition temperature and a strain rate of O.OOI/s. 
110 

III. Deexcitation of Chains 
This estimate shows that in dynamic straining of glassy polymers very large 
axial forces can be transferred onto extended chain segments if the straining occurs 
at a temperature not higher than the glass transition temperature (PMMA) or some 
10K (PVC) to 20 K (PS) lower than that. These forces are sufficient to cause chain 
breakage. 
A loading mechanism not to be investigated in detail in the context of this mono-
graph is the straining of chain molecules through forces of inertia, e.g. through prop-
agating stress waves. Brittle thermoplastic materials (pS, SAN, PMMA) behave 
"classically" at velocities of uniaxial straining below 3 mls or strain rates below 
50 S-1 [30]. In this region increase the strength properties and decrease the elonga-
tion with increasing strain rate. At strain rates between 50 and 66 S-1 a transition 
to stress wave-initiated fracture was observed which was accompanied by a tenfold 
reduction of the apparent load-carrying capability [30]. Skelton et al. [40] studied 
PA 6, PETP, and aromatic polyamide (Nomex). At ambient temperatures and in 
the range ofloading rates between 0.01 and 140 S-1 these fibers also behaved clas-
sically. At -67°C and -196°C a decrease in strength with loading rate was observed 
at a loading rate of 30 S-I. 
III. Deexcitation of Chains 
The mechanisms of deexcitation of stressed chains have been discussed en passant 
while investigating bond strength and chain loading. These mechanisms are chain 
slip with respect to a surrounding matrix (enthalpy relaxation), change of chain con-
formation (entropy relaxation), or chain rupture. 
The retraction of a stressed chain through slippage leads to an exponential stress 
relaxation 
IjI = ljIo exp (-tlr). 
(5.42) 
If the slippage is adequately described by the monomeric friction coefficient 
ro the relaxation time r will be given by: 
r = ro Lmon/E q 
(5.43) 
where q is the chain cross-section. For a PVC chain at the glass transition temperature 
one obtains a relaxation time of 0.05 s. 
The effect of a change of conformation on the elastic chain energy had been 
demonstrated in Figure 5.1. The annihilation of 4 gauche conformations within a 
PE segment of 5 nm length corresponds to an increase in length of the segment of 
0.25 nm. This increase of 5% will reduce the axial elastic forces acting on the chain 
by 0.05 E, i.e. by::::: 10 GN/m2 . In static straining this will correspond to complete 
unloading since the largest elastically transmitted forces yielded axial stresses of 
only up to 7.5 GN/m2 . The stress-biased change of chain conformation will lead, 
therefore, to a considerable reduction of axial stresses. The rate of conformational 
111 

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
changes - even of high T g polymers and in a stress-free state - is sufficiently large 
and it will be further increased under stress [19, 31]. 
Conformational changes under stress have been observed repeatedly (e.g. 41-45). 
Gafurov and Nowak [41] studied the IR absorption of PE fibers in the range of 
1200 to 1400 cm- 1 • The extinctions offour bands (at 1370, 1350, 1305, and 
1270 cm- 1) observed there and related to the (wagging) vibra1ions of methylene 
groups in gauche conformations decreased with strain. The authors estimated that 
at 4% sample strain (which corresponded to much larger amorphous strains) the 
number of gauche isomers in the amorphous regions was decreased by 20%. 
Zhurkovet al. [42] derived the degree of chain orientation from the dichroism 
of "deformed-IR bands" of PETP (cf. Chapter 8 I B and Fig. 8.5); they observed 
that for highly stressed segments an initial orientation with cos2e = 0.75 had turned 
into practically complete orientation (cos2e ~ 1.0). The problems posed by an ap-
plication of this method are discussed in detail by Read et al. [43]. Bouriot [44] 
deduced from IR measurements a reversible cis-trans transformation of the ethylene 
glycol segment in PETP fibers under the effect of tensile stresses. In polyamide 66 
he observed a reversible increase of free (non-associated) NH groups and an increase 
in the average chain orientation with chain tension. 
Conformational changes due to straining of highly uniaxially oriented PETP 
films have been reported by Sikka et aI. [45]. These changes have been inferred from 
a comparison of the IR spectrum of unloaded and loaded PETP films. Employing a 
highly sensitive Fourier Transform IR spectrometer Sikka noticed frequency shifts 
and splittings of the absorption bands in the subtraction spectra (stressed PETP IR 
spectrum minus unstressed PETP IR spectrum). At a stress of the order of 20% of 
the breaking stress those IR bands were affected which are assigned to the gauche 
conformations of the C-O bond next to the C-C bond. These conformations are 
most likely to exist in the amorphous regions of the highly uniaxially oriented semi-
crystalline polymer. The stress-induced conformational changes seemed to include 
all angles of bond rotation from minute ones to the completed gauche-trans transi-
tion. 
The third mechanism of releasing axial stresses is the breakage of a chain through 
homolytic bond scission, ionic decomposition or degrading chemical reactions. 
It is assumed that chain scission is a thermo-mechanically activated process. A 
chain segment containing ne weakest bonds of energy Uo, and carrying at its ends 
a constant stress 1/10 will, on the average, break after time Te. One refers to I/Ie as the 
time-dependent strength of a chain segment: 
(5.44) 
The quantities Wo and {3 have been defined as bond vibration frequency and 
activation volume for bond scission respectively [32]. AS nm PA 6 segment, for 
instance, at room temperature, has an instantaneous strength of 20 GN/m2 (taking 
Uo = 188 kJ/mol, Wo = 1012 S-1, ne = 12, Te = 4 s, (3 = 5.53 . 10-6 m3 /mol). If in 
straining a segment, a stress of 20 GN/m2 is maintained for a period of 4 s the seg-
ment has a probability of failure of 1 - lie = 63%. In view of the different interpre-
tations found in the literature concerning the significance of wo, {3, and even Uo the 
assumptions made in deriving Eq. (5.44) will briefly be discussed. 
112 

III. Deexcitation of Chains 
A chain in thermal contact with its surrounding can be represented by a system 
of coupled oscillators. The degree of excitation of individual oscillators (modes of 
vibration) is statistically changing. In the absence of external mechanical forces 
chain scission at a C-C bond will occur whenever an oscillator representing a C-C 
stretch vibration becomes excited beyond a critical level, Vo, the "strength" of the 
C-C bond. In Figure 4.1 the potential energy scheme was given illustrating different 
states of vibrational energy, the bond strength Vo, and the dissociation energy D. 
One is interested in the rate of dissociation events of oscillators activated beyond 
Vo· 
To evaluate this problem it will be assumed that Boltzmann statistics can be 
applied to the system of, say, s oscillators representing the C-C stretch vibrations 
within a volume element of the polymer. The fraction of energy states in which this 
system s will have a total energy level 1;. = rE is proportional to the degeneracy gr 
of the energy level Er and the Boltzmann factor exp (-Er/RT). (E is the - constant 
spacing between oscillator energy levels). The partition function, therefore, will be 
given by: 
Qt = ~ gr exp (-Er/RT). 
(5.45) 
r 
The number of states in which at least one oscillator has an energy Ej > Vo is 
given by Qa : 
Qa = ~ g; exp [-(Er + Vo)/RT]. 
(5.46) 
r 
For thermodynamic equilibrium within the volume element comprising s os-
cillators the fraction K+ of activated states, i.e. states with Ej > Vo, is given by: 
(5.47) 
This can be approximated [33] if r ~ 1 by: 
(5.48) 
where gm is the degeneracy of the most probably energy level. Expressing gm by 
the entropy S according to: 
S= RQn gm 
(5.49) 
one obtains 
K+ = exp (-Vo/RT) exp I:!.. SIR 
(5.50) 
which is identical with the relation Qn K+ = - I:!.. F+ IRT. The rate of dissociation, 
kb' then follows from K+ [341:

where" is the transmission constant which indicates how many of the activated 
complexes actually disintegrate. By combining all front factors and exp ~S/R one 
may rewrite this equation as: 
kb = Wo exp (-Uo/RT). 
(5.52) 
The quantity Wo is proportional to T; this dependency is generally negligible 
against the T-dependency caused by the exponential term. 
The rate kc for the breakage of one out of ne equal and independent bonds is 
ne times the rate kb for the breakage of an individual bond. If the bonds are not 
independent it will mean that more than one oscillator has to acquire enough vi-
brational energy for dissociation. Depending on the coupling such a cooperative 
region may count some 5 or more oscillators [35J. In this case an experimentally 
determined term Uo stands for the total vibrational energy required by all (coupled) 
atoms which are involved in one chain rupture event. This could mean that the poten-
tial barrier between neighboring sites of an uncoupled atom is much less than Uo. 
This meaning of Uo has to be kept in mind if the numerical value Uo is being com-
pared with other activation energies. 
Another problem in connection with Uo arises from the fact that in a kinetic 
experiment such as the determination of the rate of chain scission one derives the 
bond strength Uo, that is the maximum of the potential barrier (cf. Fig. 4.1). In 
calorimetric measurements the reaction enthalpy (dissociation energy D) is deter-
mined. 
By application of external forces the free energy of the activated state is changed 
with respect to the ground state. One may say that ~ F+ has to be replaced by 
~ p+ + ~ F ext. The term ~ F ext will be some function f of the stress t/I which is act-
ing on the molecular chain along its axis; Equation (5.52) then becomes: 
k = n w exp _ Uo + f(t/I) 
ceO 
RT· 
(5.53) 
The form of f is subject to discussion [35-37J. Linear and quadratic relation-
ships have been proposed. A linear relationship follows if one assumes that the force 
acting on a particular chain is not changed by the displacement of the chain under 
action of the force (comparable to a dead weight loading). The correction term f (t/I) 
will be quadratic in t/I if the stored elastic energy within a small chain section to 
either side of the point of chain scission is thought to be responsible for the rate 
of chain fracture. From the Morse potential one obtains a difference of square root 
expressions which, however, results in an almost linear relationship between force and 
activation energy in the force region of interest [36J. The effect of a linear stress 
potential on the intramolecular binding energy is shown in Figure 5.9. 
Some information concerning the form of f( t/I) and the relation between molec-
ular stress t/I and macroscopic stress a has been obtained by Zhurkov, Vettegren 
et al. [37, 32J. These authors have studied the effect of macroscopic stress a on in-
frared absorption of oriented polymers. The frequencies of skeleton vibrations of 
polymer molecules show the effect of external axial forces on molecular binding 
force-constants. The shift and change of shape of suitable infrared absorption bands

Fig. 5.9. Effect of axial stress on intra-
molecular binding potential (from [19 D· 
should reveal, therefore, the intensity and distribution of actual molecular stresses 
1/1. Experiments carried out with polypropylene and polyamide 6 have shown that 
for a stressed sample the maximum of the investigated absorption band decreases 
slightly and shifts towards lower frequencies [37, 32]. In addition a low frequency 
tail of the absorption band appears. In agreement with existing structural models 
the authors interpreted their results in assigning the shifted symmetrical part of the 
absorption band to the crystalline phase of the sample, the low frequency tail to 
the amorphous phase. The shift of the symmetrical part of the absorption band, 
b. vs, turned out to be linear with macroscopic stress in all performed experiments: 
(5.54) 
Following a theory of Bernstein [38] the shift of the stretching frequency of 
a bond can be related to a shift in dissociation energy D of the same bond: 
(5.55) 
Since b. Vs ~ Vo one may substitute v5 -
v~ by b. Vs . 2 vo. A consequence of 
this condition is that also (v5 -
v~) is proportional to a. The choice of v or v2 in 
Eq. (5.54) only affects a, not the power of a. If one further assumes that the activa-
tion energy Uo is changed by a similar amount as Do one obtains:

5. Mechanical Excitation and Scission of a Chain 
In order to derive the form of f( t/I) the relation between u and t/I for oriented 
crystalline phases has to be established. According to experimental and theoretical 
evidence it is assumed that a condition of homogeneous stress exists within the 
crystalline layers of a regular sandwich structure and that t/I is proportional to u. 
Equation (5.56) thus yields that the activation energy for scission of an oriented 
chain molecule is linearly decreased by stresses acting upon this molecule. Equation 
(5.53) with (5.56) may be written as: 
ke = ne Wo exp [(-Vo + 13 t/I)/RT] 
(5.57) 
which is equivalent to Eq. (5.44). It is believed that the rate of fracture of chains 
all subjected to the same local stress t/I can correctly be described by Eq. (5.57). 
On the basis of the foregoing considerations the response of two chains of dif-
ferent conformation to axial stresses has been evaluated in Figure 5.10. An extended 
chain segment (L = Lo) stretches elastically up to the time-dependent fracture stress. 
The calculations have been carried out employing a modulus of elasticity for the 
polyamide 6 chain of 200 GN/m2 • As indicated in Table 5.3 it is still open to dis-
cussion whether this value can be unambiguously accepted. The times to fracture 
have been calculated from Eq. (5.57) for a segment comprising 12 bonds of low 
strength (Vo = 188 kJ /mol). The partially extended chain (L = 1.1 Lo) contains 
initially four kinks (8 gauche bonds). It responds in region A (Fig. 5.10) mostly by 
the hindered rotation of its gauche bonds, which, in this region, accounts for 90% 
of the axial deformation. The resulting combined modulus amounts to 22 GN/m2 . 
If geometrically possible a transition to the fully extended conformation will occur 
in region B. Region C represents the energy elastic straining of the then extended 
chain segment of length 1.1 Lo. 
The degradation of chains through ionic decomposition or chemical reactions 
under stress will be discussed where appropriate in the following chapters.

The action of axial tensile forces on a molecular bond RI-R2 results in a decrease 
of the apparent binding energy of the bond and thus in an increase of the probability 
for bond scission. If the reduction of the apparent binding energy is sizeable the 
mechanical action may be considered as the main cause of chain destruction. In as 
much as the scission of a chain molecule into organic radicals and the resulting ap-
pearance of unpaired free electrons is governed by mechanical forces a study of 
radical formation and of radical reactions will reveal information on the forces acting 
on a chain at a molecular level. The method of investigating free radicals by para-
magnetic resonance techniques has been highly developed during the last thirty years 
[1, 2]. Since then it was successfully applied to elucidate the mechanism of the for-
mation of free radicals in chemical reactions and under irradiation of visible and 
ultraviolet light, of x- and ,),-rays, and of particles [1.3]. Also the value of the spec-
troscopic splitting factor g, the magnetic surrounding of the unpaired free electron 
spin, and the structure of the free radical have been studied. In all these cases the free 
electron spin acts as a probe, which, at least temporarily, is attached to a certain 
molecule, takes part in the motion of the molecule, and interacts with the surround-
ing magnetic field. 
In investigations of the deformation and fracture of high polymer solids [4-67] by 
electron paramagnetic resonance techniques (EPR) similar experimental problems 
arise as during the above mentioned applications of EPR: 
1. Interpretation of the form of the observed spectra, i.e. determination of the 
position of the free electron within the molecule. 
119 

6. Identification of ESR Spectra of Mechanically Formed Free Radicals 
2. Measurement of spectrum intensity, i.e. determination of the number of free 
electrons. 
3. Observation of the changes displayed by the EPR signal and elucidation of the 
nature and kinetics of radical reactions. 
From these primary data, information is sought to obtain with respect to the 
deformation behavior of chain molecules, their scission and their role in fracture 
initiation. 
In the following a brief description of EPR spectroscopy will be given in order 
to provide an understanding of the main experimental technique which is used in 
these investigations. Subsequently reactions, identification, and concentration of 
mechanically formed free radicals will be discussed. 
II. EPR Technique 
A. Principles 
The EPR spectroscopy of free electrons is based on the paramagnetism of free electron 
spins. For this reason one also speaks of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. 
Electrons on fully occupied molecular orbitals generally do not give rise to a magnetic 
moment since - according to the Pauli principle - pairwise spins compensate each 
other. If, however, a bond is broken through homolytic scission, then free radicals 
with impaired electron spins are formed which are detectable. A free electron has the 
magnetic moment IJ. given by 
(6.1) 
where g is the spectroscopic splitting factor, {3 is the Bohr magneton, and s is the 
spin vector. In a magnetic field H the spin may assume one of two positions (spin 
quantum numbers m being either + 1/2 or - 1/2). The energy difference between 
these two states is 
AE = g{3H. 
(6.2) 
The populations of the two energy levels at equilibrium are given by Boltzmann 
statistics which indicate that more of the free electrons will normally reside in the 
- 1/2 "ground state". However, when electromagnetic energy of an appropriate 
(microwave) frequency v is supplied, an electron can be "pumped" to the higher 
+ 1/2 state. The resonance condition is fulfilled when hv is just equal to the energy 
difference between the two levels: 
AE = hv = g{3Hres 
(6.3) 
where h is Planck's constant. In resonance, microwave energy is absorbed by the 
resonating sample if the upper energy level is constantly depopulated by thermal 
interaction between the spins and the molecular lattice. Generally the microwave 
120 

II. EPR Technique 
frequency employed by commercially available ESR spectrometers is fixed (at about 
9.5 GHz) and the magnetic field is swept through the resonance (at about 3200 Oe). 
B. Hyperfine Structure of ESR Spectra 
Since the "free" electrons are attached to molecules, they will sense not only the 
presence of the applied external magnetic field but will show magnetic interactions 
with nuclei of surrounding atoms which have a magnetic moment. These interactions 
give rise to the "splitting" that can be used to identify particular radicals. Equa-
tion (6.3) is accordingly transformed into 
n 
Hres = h ZJ / g ~ - L (Ai + Bi) mIi. 
(6.4) 
i= 1 
Here mn is the spin quantum number of the interacting nucleus i, Ai the iso-
tropic part of the magnetic coupling between radical electron and nucleus i, and 
Bi the anisotropic part which depends on the orientation of the radical within the 
external magnetic field. 
For the important class of hydrocarbon radicals, B is different from zero only for 
the a-protons, i.e. for the nuclei of hydrogen atoms directly bound to the radical 
C atom. In well ordered systems (highly oriented polymers, single crystals) these 
radicals do have a strongly orientation dependent hyperfine structure. 
In the simplest case of no interaction (A = 0, B = 0) there will be one line with 
its center at Hres. If only one proton interacts isotropically (B = 0) with the radical 
electron then the spectrum will show two lines displaced from Hres by ± A. If two 
equivalent nuclei interact with the electron then m! can assume the values + 1, 0, 
and -1 so that a triplet of lines appears with distances of -A, 0, and +A from the 
center respectively. Since the state with m! = 0 appears twice as often as the other 
ones the individual resonance lines have intensitfes as 1: 2: 1. It may generally be said 
that n equivalent protons give rise to a spectrum with (n + 1) lines which show an 
intensity distribution given by the binomial coefficients of exponent n. For illustra-
tion Figure 6.1 shows the spectra of alkyl radicals -CH2 -CH-CH2 - in highly 
{3 
{3 
oriented polyethylene monofilaments which were produced by irradiation with fast 
electrons [37]. In one orientation (fiber axis parallel to H, spectrum at bottom) the 
total splitting parameter (A + B) of the a-protons is just equal to the isotropic para-
meter of the 4 equivalent {3-protons. Therefore, a spectrum is observed which might 
be caused by 5 equivalent protons, i.e. a sextet with intensities 1: 5: 10: 10: 5: 1 (some 
background including the small center line belongs to a second radical present within 
the sample). In the case of a perpendicular arrangement of fiber axis and magnetic 
field the spectrum shown in the upper portion of Figure 6.1 is observed. Now the 
a- and ~-protons have different splitting parameters and a quintet of lines appears 
due to 4 equivalent ~-protons with each quintet line split into a doublet by the 
a-proton. In all 10 lines result with intensity ratios of 1:1:4:4:6:6:4:4:1:1:. Again 
the small background of a superimposed second spectrum is observed. The orienta-

ethylene fiber parallel to magnetic field Ho, b. axis of fiber per-
pendicular to Ho (after [37,38]). 
tion dependency of the hyperfine structure of hydrocarbon radicals offers the op-
portunity to study the orientation of radical carrying chains. 
C. Number of Spins 
In most spectrometers lines are recorded which are the first derivative of the energy 
absorption peaks with respect to the magnetic field Ho. It is the plot of these first 
derivates that is usually called the ESR spectrum. 
The total microwave energy absorption can be obtained by double integration 
of the ESR spectrum. In the absence of saturation effects the total power absorbed, 
1(00), depends upon the number of spins No, the intensity of the oscillating magnetic 
(microwave) field HI' and the frequency v according to

(6.5) 
To calculate absolute intensities of spins usually comparison of the unknown 
intensity No is made with a standard sample with a known concentration Ns of spins 
[I]. Frequently a solution of the stable free radicall,l-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl 
(DPPH) in benzene is used as standard radical. If the "unknown" spectrum is sym-
122 

III. Reactions and Means of Identification 
metrical and narrow and the experimental conditions (sample size and shape, con-
ditions of spectrometer operation) are the same in both cases the relation 
(6.6) 
is valid where Ns and Is (00) refer to the standard sample. If lines of identical shape 
and width are compared it is sufficient to measure the peak height h of the first 
derivative. The numbers N 1 and N2 of unpaired electrons causing these peak heights 
are then related by: 
(6.7) 
For most cases of stress induced free radical formation this relation has been 
used for evaluation of time-dependent intensities. 
The number of free radicals necessary for detectable peak heights depends on 
the line shape and the effective volume of the spectrometer cavity. At the time 
covered by the referenced investigations (1960-1976) the lower limit of detectabili-
ty of polymer radicals in the solid state can be given as 1013 spins/ cm3 . 
It may be mentioned that the number of free radicals present in a liquid or at 
the surface of a solid can also be determined by a non-spectroscopic method. This 
method exploits the color changes associated with the consumption of free radicals 
from a test solution e.g. of DPPH [39]. It should be emphasized again that great 
caution must be exercised in comparing absolute values of free radical concentra-
tions obtained from differently shaped samples and/or in different cavities. Accord-
ing to general experience deviations of up to a factor of 2 must be expected. 
III. Reactions and Means of Identification 
The assignment of the specific peaks to specific types of free radicals is not always 
obvious; it sometimes involves highly intriguing techniques and the knowledge of 
related spectra and of chemical reactions to be expected [64, 67]. The main obstacles 
to be overcome are the broad line widths of resonance lines from solid specimens 
and the high rate of many radical reactions. It is evident that a large line width often 
prevents an effective resolution of nuclear hyperfine structure. The so-called 
"5 + 4 line" spectrum of mechanically destroyed methacrylic polymers [4] is an 
example of a spectrum which had only been identified after comparison with the 
16-line-spectrum of an aqueous solution of the polymerization radical of methacrylic 
acid. Thus it was learned that the former spectrum is the unresolved form of the latter 
and has to be assigned to the same radical [40]. 
The difficulties in identifying an observed spectrum are well illustrated by the 
spectrum of 6 polyamide shown in Figure 6.2. It was obtained after stretching a fiber 
sample at room temperature in the ESR cavity by an automatic servo-control system 
to the point of radical detection, then scanning the magnetic field from 3071 to 
3571 Oersted (mean, 3321 Oe) at 9.433 GHz and a time constant of 0.5 second.

6. Identification of ESR Spectra of Mechanically Formed Free Radicals 
Fig. 6.2. Apparent 5-line spectrum 
as obtained after stretching of a 
bundle of 6 polyamide fibers at 
room temperature in an ESR cavity. 
This apparent 5-line spectrum is obtained, under exclusion of oxygen, when highly 
stressed fibers or finely ground or milled material are investigated at room tempera-
ture [41]. A similar spectrum is observed after 'Y or electron irradiation of PA 6 
[42, 43). Two different interpretations of this 5-line spectrum have been given. Graves 
and Ormerod [42] suggested that an apparent quartet coming from the radical 
-CH2-CO-NH-CH-CH2- (radical I) is superimposed by a singlet which may be 
due to -CH2-CHO-NH-CH2- (II). Kashiwagi [43] deduced, after comparison with 
radicals from polyurea and succinamide, that the apparent 5-line spectrum from 
6 polyamide and the 6-line spectra from 610, 66 and 57 polyamides are a triplet of 
doublets stemming from the radical!. It is, therefore, generally concluded that the 
radicals observed at room temperature in mechanically degraded polyamide material 
are mainly of type I, superimposed to a varying degree by a component of type II. 
The radicals I are secondary chain radicals which can only have been produced by 
the reaction of a hydrogen from a methylene group with an other - a primary -
radical. Since the secondary radicals are reaction products they give no direct in-
formation on the nature and location of the primary process of mechanical degrada-
tion of the above solids. 
The appearance of free radicals in the process of mechanical degradation reveals 
conclusively that under the action of local mechanical forces main chains have been 
broken and that the breakage of a main chain bond has led to the formation of a 
chain end free radical at either side of the broken bond. Knowledge of these facts 
can already be employed to study the relation between environmental parameters 
and the rate of chain scission. The kinetics of chain scission and its possible role in 
fracture initiation is investigated in detail in Chapters 7 and 8. Apart from the inten-
sity which gives a quantitative measure of chain scission the form of free radical 
spectra has been used to determine the location of primary and secondary radicals 
within the molecule [64] and within morphological units (within crystals, on crys-
tal surfaces, in amorphous regions). 
If degradation and ESR investigation of a sample are carried out at liquid nitrogen 
temperature, the rate of radical reactions is slowed down sufficiently and a direct 
observation of the primary radicals produced by mechanical degradation becomes 
124 

IV. Assignment of Spectra 
possible. In a thorough investigation Zakrevskii, Tomashevskii, and Baptizmanskii 
[10] have cleared up the scheme of radical reactions for 6 polyamide (caprolactam, 
capron). At 77 K they observed a complex spectrum showing the hyper fine struc-
ture of a sextet superimposed on a triplet. From the distance between the different 
lines of the sextet (splitting) and their intensity ratios the above authors established 
the presence of the radical R-CH2 -CH2 (III). This radical will form after rupture 
of any of the bonds 1 to 6 in the caprolactam unit: 
If the superimposed sextet is subtracted from the original spectrum a triplet 
remains which must be due to a scission product of the above molecule. The ex-
clusive breakage of bonds 3 and 4 can be ruled out immediately since it would only 
lead to radicals of type III. Breakage of bonds 6 and 7 was eliminated after compari-
son with capron deuterated in the imino groups; breakage of bond 1 would not lead 
to a radical with a triplet spectrum. After inspection of all other possibilities, in-
cluding secondary radicals, there remain as likely scission points only the bonds 
2 and 5. After having studied a and e methyl substituted caprolactam the authors 
[10] finally were able to state that in a stressed 6 polyamide molecule both the bonds 
2 and 5 do break and with equal probability. The rupture of a PA 6 molecule, there-
fore, leads to three primary radicals: 
-CH2-CH2 (III, 50%), -NH-CH2 (IV, 25%) and -CO-CH2 (V, 25%). 
Upon slowly rising the temperature from 77 K radical III begins to disappear 
leaving at 120 K only IV and V. At higher temperatures IV and V are gradually trans-
formed into I which prevails above 240 K. Within the experimental limits mentioned 
above with respect to comparing the absolute numbers of radicals of different species 
there seems to be no loss of radicals during conversion of III, IV, and V into radical I. 
In the following Sections and Tables the experimental conditions are reported 
which were employed during mechanical production and ESR investigation of free 
radicals. The assignments of primary and/or secondary radicals are given. For a dis-
cussion of the nature and kinetics of possible transfer reactions the reader is referred 
to the recent and comprehensive reviews of Ranby et al. [2] and of Sohma et al. [64]. 
Special problems in view of polymer morphology and of the reduction of chain 
strengths will be treated in Chapters 7 and 8. 
I V. Assignment of Spectra 
A. Free Radicals in Ground High Polymers 
The appearance of macroradicals in mechanically destroyed polymers was first shown 
in 1959 [4-6]. Since then, fairly systematically natural and synthetic organic ma-
terials have been investigated with respect to formation of free radicals in mechanical 
125 

6. Identification of ESR Spectra of Mechanically Formed Free Radicals 
degradation (see for instance the monograph by Ranby and Rabek [2] and the review 
papers by Butyagin et al. [7], Kausch [8], aNd Sohmaet al. [64]). Owing to the original-
ly limited sensitivity of ESR-spectrometers, the first experiments have been carried 
out with crushed polymers which have a high ratio of fracture surface to volume and, 
therefore, a comparatively large ESR signal. 
The experimental equipment is described by various authors (referenced in 2). 
Grinding, milling, cutting or crushing of the polymer sample is done in vibration mills 
or mortars, under inert atmosphere, in vacuo, or in liquid nitrogen. Magnetic drills 
have been reported by which the shavings or grindings are produced within a sealed 
glass tube immediately at the ESR-cavity. Most equipment used in these experiments 
allows for a control of the gaseous environment and for temperature control from 
liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) to above room temperature. 
In Table 6.1 the presently available details of sample preparation (crushing tech-
nique, temperature, environment), the treatment of the crushed sample, the tem-
peratures at which the ESR-spectra were taken, and the assignments of the observed 
spectra to primary and/or secondary free radicals are listed for 35 different polymeric 
materials. The common result of practically all of the reported ESR work [4-36] on 
comminuted polymers is that the mechanical action leads to the severance of a main 
chain bond and to the formation of chain end radicals as primary radicals. The only 
exception to this rule are the substituted polydimethylsiloxanes (No. 32 to 35) where 
there is a strong indication that the Si-O bond decomposes by an ionic mechanism 
rather than by homolytic bond scission [36]. In no case free radicals are produced 
by a mechanical stripping off of sidegroups or -atoms from the main chain. For this 
to occur stresses are required which simply cannot be transmitted onto the relatively 
small sidegroups present in the materials listed in Table 6.1. In fact the attempted 
degradation of low molecular weight compounds (paraffins, ethanol, benzene) with 
a molecular weight equal to or larger than that of those sidegroups failed, although 
mechanical means identical to those used successfully for macromolecules had been 
employed [13, 14,62]. 
B. Free Radicals in Tensile Specimens 
Mechanical degradation which leads to formation of free radicals can be achieved 
in various ways but generally two types of samples are being used in experiment: 
powders of finely ground polymers as discussed above or uniaxially stressed fibers, 
monofilaments, or strips of films. In samples of the first type all molecular fracture 
processes are completed before the ESR investigation begins. These samples can 
primarily be used to obtain information on the nature and absolute number of free 
radicals present within the degraded polymer. 
Samples of the second type, tensile specimens, are in princi pIe suitable for study-
ing the time-dependent formation of free radicals and their effect on strength and on 
other macroscopic properties. It can be said a priori that the free radical intensities 
of tensile specimens - be it before or after rupture - will be very much lower than 
the intensities found in finely ground polymers with fracture surfaces of several 
thousand cm2/g. Even with the increased sensitivity of presently available ESR spec-
126 

IV. Assignment of Spectra 
trometers the investigation of stressed samples is limited to a few with favourable 
properties. The only experiments leading to a successfull investigation of time-
dependent formation of free radicals were carried out with highly oriented, semi-
crystalline fibers like 6 and 66 polyamide, polyoxamides, polyethylene, polyethylene 
terephthalate, or natural silk and with preoriented rubbers (natural rubber, polychlo-
roprene) near liquid nitrogen temperatures. 
In Table 6.2 experimental conditions and types of radicals observed are listed. 
The experimental equipment necessary for stressing fibers within the resonant 
cavity has been extensively reviewed by RAnby et al. [2]. It is quite more elaborate 
than that for investigating powders, although the requirements for controlled tem-
perature and atmosphere are nearly the same. Lever systems or servo-controlled 
hydraulic loading systems have been reported [29, 37, 44, 60] through which pro-
grammed load or strain functions can be applied to bundles of fibers (or other tensile 
specimens) in the resonant cavity. The stretching of the tensile specimens necessarily 
has to be carried out in that temperature regime within which free radical spectra can 
be well observed. For thermoplastic fibers this meant 200 to 320 K; for preoriented 
rubbers ambient temperatures of 93 to 123 K were necessary. At these temperatures 
the primary free radicals are sufficiently mobile to react rapidly with atom groups 
of the same or other chain molecules, with absorbed gases, or with additives or im-
purities acting as radical traps. For this reason the observed free radicals listed in 
Table 6.2 are secondary radicals - with the only exception of the highly stable pri-
mary radical of poly-p-(2-hydroxyethoxy) benzoic acid (PEOR) studied by Naga-
mura and Takayanagi [60]. The secondary radicals - if sufficiently resolved - have 
been assigned to either peroxy radicals (R-O-O), main chain radicals (R-CH-R), 
unknown impurities [55], or deliberately added radical traps as, for instance chloranyl 
[61 ].

Historically, the first ESR experiments with mechanically produced free radicals 
have been made in the Ioffe-Institute in Leningrad in 1959 [1] with ground or milled 
polymers, the samples being investigated after completion of the fracture process. 
To elucidate the effect of structural or environmental parameters on the kinetics of 
stress-induced free radical formation it is necessary to study - by ESR - highly 
stressed chains during the loading process. As outlined in Chapter 5 a notable energy 
elastic straining of a chain can only be achieved if the chain cannot relieve stresses 
internally by a change of conformation or externally by slippage against the field 
exerting the uniaxial forces. Vice versa the mechanical scission of a chain must be 
taken as an indication that at the time of chain rupture axial stresses 1/1 equal to the 
chain strength 1/1 c had not only been reached but also maintained during the average 
lifetime period T c of the chain segment. 
141 

7. Phenomenology of Free Radical Formation 
In view of the fact that the slippage of chains, microfibrils, or fibrils reduces or 
prevents the mechanical scission of chains highly oriented thermoplastic fibers with 
little potential for plastic deformation are the most suitable objects for a study of 
chain scission kinetics. ESR investigations using fibers of polyamide 6, 66, and 12, 
PE, PP, PETP and of other materials have been carried out in a limited number of 
laboratories, at first in the USSR, later in the USA, Germany, Great Britain, and 
Japan (see Table 6.2). Practically all researchers worked with highly oriented mono-
filaments, stacks of strips, or mostly with commercial yarns made up of a few hun-
dred filaments each having a diameter of about 20 Ilm. As discussed in Chapter 2 the 
filaments consist of fibrils and these in turn of microfibrils with a diameter of 20 
to 40 nm. The experimental set-up allowing uniaxial straining of these samples under 
controlled atmosphere and directly within the ESR cavity has been described and 
referenced in Chapter 6, Section IV B. It has also been seen that the primary radicals 
formed in tensile straining can - with one exception - be assigned to the breakage 
of main chains. In the following discussion, concentrations of secondary - rather 
than of primary - radicals are usually analyzed. It can be understood that the con-
version factor from the number of primary radicals to the number of secondary radi-
cals is constant (and, if not stated otherwise, close to unity). 
If a semi crystalline microfibril is subjected to stresses, the resulting deformation 
will be non-homogeneous at the molecular level. The bulk of the deformation will 
be born by the amorphous regions. As discussed in Chapter 5 the largest stresses are 
transferred upon extended chain segments which share the strain imparted onto an 
amorphous region. The stress induced scission of chains must, therefore, be ex-
pected to occur within the amorphous regions. 
Becht and Fischer [2] have demonstrated directly that free radicals are formed 
in the amorphous regions. These authors observed that polycaprolactam samples 
swollen in methacrylic acid did not show in subsequent stressing the usual ESR 
spectrum of the polyamide radical but the polymerization radical of the methacrylic 
acid. Based on the logical assumption that only amorphous regions had been swollen 
it was proved, therefore, that free radicals had formed in the amorphous regions 
only. Verma et al. [3] reached at the same repeatedly confirmed conclusion studying 
irradiation-produced radicals in semi crystalline polymers. Those radicals had been 
created under 'Y-irradiation within the whole volume of a PA 66 film i.e. as well with-
in amorphous as within crystalline regions. At room temperature Verma observed -
depending on sample orientation within the ESR cavity - a three, four, or six line 
spectrum. He assigned the pronounced anisotropy of the spectrum to the fact that 
the majority of the remaining radicals is located in the well oriented crystalline blocks. 
If the free radicals were introduced into the same material by stretching, no conspi-
cuous anisotropy of the ESR spectrum could be observed. In this case the radicals 
were obviously located in sites showing rather small local chain orientation. In 
terms of fiber morphology the chain scission events must have taken place, there-
fore, in the amorphous regions between the crystal lamellae within the microfibrils 
(Fig. 2.11, 2.17b, 2.18b), at microfibril surfaces, or in interfibrillar regions (Fig. 2.11). 
The question of the location of chain scission points will be touched upon repeated-
ly within this chapter. 
At first the phenomenology of free radical production in preoriented yarns will 
be discussed taking 6 and 66 polyamide as examples. In constant load rate tests a 
142 

I. Radical Formation in Thermoplastics 
very steep increase in concentration of fairly stable secondary radicals is observed 
in a strain regime of between 8% and rupture strain (16 to 25%) which corresponds 
to a stress regime of between 500 and 900 MN/m2 (Fig. 7.1). Load rate tests are a 
suitable means to demonstrate the effect of mechanical action on radical formation 
and accumulation, but they are not sufficient to discriminate between the simulta-
neous effects of stress, strain, and time on the rate of radical formation. From con-
stant load tests it was learned that, under constant load, the rate of radical forma-
tion decreases quite rapidly whereas the amount of radicals formed in virgin samples 
reaches a constant equilibrium value (Fig. 7.2). If a sample is strained repeatedly to 
a strain level tJ then free radicals will be formed, i.e. chains will break, only during 
the first straining cycle. If, however, in subsequent straining the level tJ is exceeded, 
more chains will be seen to break. In a step-strain test the radical population increases 
stepwise (Figs. 7.3 and 7.4).

In the first paper on this subject [7] Kausch and Becht gave a detailed discussion 
of the notable fact that within each strain step the radical concentration increases 
concurrently with a decrease of the macroscopic tensile stress. The conclusion was 
drawn that the local molecular stresses are unevenly distributed. They are not simply 
a constant multiple of the macroscopic stresses. The chain segments breaking to-
wards the end of a strain interval quite obviously do not participate in the macro-

scopic stress relaxation (a decrease of the axial chain stress to 0.9 t/lc increases the 
lifetime by two orders of magnitude and virtually stops the chain scission process). 
It was furthermore concluded that the microfibrils do not unload through slippage 
and that the lateral rigidity of the crystal blocks within the sandwich-structured 
microfibrils must be large enough so as to permit the build-up of large stress concen-
trations. If the lateral rigidity of the crystal blocks were insufficient the fibril would 
break up into submicrofibrils. This situation is schematically shown by Figure 7.5. The

central diagram represents the alledged sub microfibrillar structure within an un-
stressed microfibril. If the crystal blocks break up while being strained the tensile stresses 
in every part of the structure will equilibrate and be equal to the external stress 
(right hand side). The external stresses are, as one knows from Chapters 1 and 5 al-
ways much smaller than the chain strength. If, however, the layered structure is also 
preserved at large strains stresses proportional to local strain and tensile modulus Ej 
of the amorphous subregions can be exerted (left hand side of Fig. 7.5). This means 
that within a subregion with large Ej correspondingly large - although locally well 
confined - stresses €aEj - can be reached. For this reason the left hand side model 
is proposed to describe the mechanical response of an axially strained microfibril. 
The observed fact that chains break even after (20 minutes of) stress relaxation 
not only demands the integrity of the crystal blocks but also an intimate and per-
sistent lateral cohesion between microfibrils within a fibril and between fibrils within 
a filament. In the same way as studied in detail in Chapter 5 for single chains the 
shear displacement of the ends of microfibrils against the interfibrillar cohesion per-
mits the transfer onto the microfibrils of those forces which accumulate within the 
stress-transfer lengths to the axial stress a. This stress relaxes at constant filament 
elongation. The continued rupture of chains indicates that the axial strains of the 
microfibrils are maintained during such stress relaxation. Those strains, however, 
can only be maintained if large scale slip of microfibrils or fibrils does not occur. 
In the described experiments with P A 6 fibers the cause of stress relaxation must 
obviously be sought within the microfibrils. Following the model shown on the left 
hand side of Figure 7.5 decrease of aCt) at constant microfibril elongation can be 
caused. 
-
either by the gradual and fairly general decrease of the relaxation moduli Ej of 
practically all amorphous regions within the microfibril 
or by the preferential and large decrease of the Ej of just a few amorphous regions, 
accompanied by their large deformation and by the retraction of others. 
The previously discussed intimate lateral cohesion would favor the more homo-
geneous decrease of all relaxation moduli. The same conclusion was drawn by Geza-
low et al. [8] from the uniformity of stress induced long period changes. 
The following statements will serve, therefore, as the basis for a mathematical 
analysis of the ( static) chain scission experiments such as step-strain or small loading 
rate tests at sufficiently low temperatures: 
stress relaxation or creep is not caused by slippage of fibrils or microfibrils; 
chain scission occurs in tie-segments, i.e. in those segments of a chain molecule 
which connect two different crystal blocks traversing in a fairly extended con-
formation the amorphous region in-between (e.g. Fig. 5.2); most frequently tie-
segments interconnect adjacent crystal blocks within a microfibril, but also more 
distant or interfibrillar ties have to be considered; 
eventually breaking tie-segments are solidly held, most probably by the crystal 
blocks; although the clamping extends over 2 to 5 nm the tie-segments are treated 
as if they had a well defined end-to-end distance Lo and contour length L; 
chain scission occurs if the axial chain stress 1/1 reaches chain strength 1/1 c; 
the large value of molecular stress concentration (ratio of 1/1 to a of the order of 
50) follows from the fact that individual (highly rigid and nearly extended) chains 
146 

I. Radical Formation in Thermoplastics 
are subjected to the comparatively large strains of the intra- or interfibrillar amor-
phous regions they span. 
At this point only the results of the mathematical analysis with respect to the 
kinetics of the formation of free radicals are presented. A discussion of the possible 
role of chain scission in fracture will be resumed in Chapter 8. 
The analysis concerns the general case of fairly extended tie-segments of contour 
length ~, end-to-end distance Lo, and elastic modulus Ek . Each segment spans an 
arbitrary number nai of amorphous regions (width La) and nei = na - 1 of crystalline 
regions (width Lc). As discussed in Chapter 5 a segment i will experience ultimate 
stresses 1/Ii only after it has assumed the most extended conformation accessible to 
it. The elastic stress then is: 
(7.1 ) 
At a given average axial microfibril strain E the stresses 1/Ii are largest for tie-
segments interconnecting adjacent crystal blocks (Lo = La). The third term in Eq. 
(7.1) then disappears. If the tie-segments extend over several sandwich layers and 
crystal blocks of the same or different microfibrils the first term in Eq. (7.1) be-
comes small. In that case the average tensile strain E determines the stress level1/li' 
It is important to point out again that in this analysis no loading of interfibrillar 
tie-segments through shear strains (slippage between microfibrils) will be considered. 
At a degree of crystallinity of 50% E is by a factor of (2-E/Ec) smaller than Ea, where 
E and Ec deSignate the relaxation modulus of the microfibril as a whole and that of 
the crystalline regions. 
The mathematical analysis of the free radical production curves aimes at a deter-
mination of the distribution No(~/Lo) and of the kinetic parameters Uo, wo, and 
{3. It can be carried out taking into consideration only tie-segments between adjacent 
crystal blocks (Lo = La). If only long interfibrillar tie-segments were present the 
resulting distribution N~ (~/Lo) would be narrower and approximately obtainable 
through the transformation No -
= No --- -
. The following analysis

([I+Ea]Li )

also assumes a homogeneous distribution of amorphous strains within a microfibril. 
Consideration of a non-homogeneous distribution of strains Eai would again result 
in narrowing No(LdLo). From Eqs. (5.57) and (7.1) one obtains straight forwardly 
the expectation value of the number of broken chains or formed free radicals: 
(7.2) 
where Wb = Wo exp (-Uo/RT). 
Through a numerical iteration procedure, a distribution of LdLo can be deter-
mined [7] in such a way that Eq. (7.2) describes the experimental points (e.g. those 
radical concentrations shown in Fig. 7.4). The length distribution of the intrafibrillar 
tie-segments obtained in that case is shown in Figure 7.6, it ranges from L/Lo = 1.06

the rupture of fairly long interfibrillar tie-segments then their relative lengths must 
have a distribution of L/Lo between 0.97 (!) and 1.05. Since a given distribution of 
segment lengths is essentially reflected by the step heights of radical eqUilibrium 
concentrations a histogram of these step heights serves to characterize the apparent 
segment length distribution without introducing any assumptions on the nature of 
the tie-segments. In Figure 7.7 histograms from step strain tests carried out at dif-
ferent temperatures are reproduced. 
The association of the observed free radical distributions with apparent chain 
length distributions requires the smallest number of additional assumptions. If it 
were to be assumed that the microfibrils contained a monodisperse distribution of

1. Radical Formation in Thermoplastics 
relative segment lengths (e.g. LILo = 1.0) it were also necessary to assume that 
the amorphous strains are unevenly distributed throughout the fiber 
the molecular extensibility is comparable to the amorphous strains, i.e. reaches 25 
to 35% 
there is a rapid strain hardening of an amorphous region after breakage of the 
tie molecules (otherwise collapse of that region would lead to complete stress 
relaxation in the whole microfibril). 
Particularly the latter two conditions seemed to be unrealistic. So the early 
proponents [3-7] were led to their interpretation that a fiber contains tie chains of 
different conformations ("tautness"). 
A third interpretation of step-strain data was advanced by Crist and Peterlin [9]. 
They suggested that there is an uneven distribution of strains due to differences in 
the lengths of the many thousand filaments strained simultaneously in any of the 
above experiments. The uneven-length effect undoubtedly broadens the observed 
distributions of relative chain lengths. But the premature breakages of individual 
filaments, and the formation of their fracture surfaces, cannot account for the num-
ber of free radicals formed. To further disprove this contention Hassell and DeVries 
examined the free radicals formed in straining of highly oriented bulk nylon 66 
banding material [10]. They obtained quite similar and even slightly wider histograms 
in straining bulk strip material than bundles of nylon 66 fibers. A scanning electron 
micrograph of the strip material fracture surface reveals that in banding material -
as postulated for yarns - defects are introduced throughout the stressed sample 
volume (Figs. 7.8 and 7.9). The final fracture surface propagates along the path of 
least resistance which includes the previously developed defect zones. It is only at 
a level of deformation close to the rupture strain that a difference between the strain-
ing of a single fiber and of a bundle thereof becomes noticeable. A statistical explana-
tion of this fact has been given in Chapter 3.

7. Phenomenology of Free Radical Formation 
Convincing evidence against the assumption that segment length distributions 
are macroscopic artefacts was derived from step-temperature tests carried out by 
Johnsen and Klinkenberg [11] which will be discussed in Section C. 
B. Effect of Strain Rate on Radical Production 
Local molecular stresses can partly be relieved by slip or uncoiling of molecules. In 
thermoplastics the relaxation times governing those viscoelastic deformations at room 
temperature are of the order of milliseconds to minutes, i.e. smaller or comparable 
to the duration of the mechanical excitation. Rapid loading, then, can bring more 
nonextended chain segments to high stresses and eventually to chain scission than 
slow loading during the same strain interval. But their number should be small. On 
the other hand, the higher rigidity of a rapidly loaded viscoelastic body leads to a 
decrease of the strain at fracture and, therefore, also to decrease of the largest strain, 
Ea, imposed on the amorphous regions. 
The effect of strain rate on chain scission of rigidly clamped segments follows 
from Eq. (7.2). The higher the loading rate the smaller the time t necessary to reach 
a certain strain, the shorter also the time interval a stressed chain spends at the stress 
level aCt) and the smaller the probability for chain scission at that level [7]. In 
Figure 7.10 the decay curves of polyamide 6 segments of monodisperse contour 
lengths L = 1.09 Lo have been plotted. At 20% amorphous strain Ea a segment of 
length L will assumedly have a fully extended conformation and experience a chain 
strain of 10%. At this strain level chain scission becomes noticeable at small strain 
rates (0.1 . 10-6 S-I). At larger strain rates an equivalent decay is observed later. 
For the given system an increase of strain rate by a factor of 10 will shift the decay 
curve to higher strain values by .::lEa = 0.9%. 
The effect of a change of strain rate in the course of a tensile experiment can 
be predicted from Figure 7.10. An instantaneous increase in strain rate is equivalent

to changing from a certain level of depletion (e.g. 40% at point A) to a level where 
the depletion at that rate should have been much lower (6% at B). In other words a 
fraction of 34% of those chains which are supposed to scission beyond B are already 
gone. Consequently the rate of chain scission following an increase in strain rate 
should be reduced. This has been quantitatively verified by Klinkenberg [13]. 
Only few experiments are known where the concentration of free radicals as a 
function of strain rate has been investigated [12-16]. In Figure 7.11 the total num-
ber of spins at fracture of a 6 polyamide fiber sample is shown to increase in the 
range of clamp displacement rates between 1 and 10 . 10-3 cm/s. Above 
20· 10-3 cm/s (which corresponds to a strain rate of 1.43· 10-3 S-I) a drop in 
free radical production is indicated [14]. The total rate effect seems to be not very 
large, however. For the present experiment, it did not exceed 50%. Similar values 
have been reported [16] from an investigation of the cold drawing of polycarbonate 
[15]. Here the total concentration of free radicals obtained increased by 140% with 
strain rates varying from 0.017 S-1 to 1.7 S-1 (Fig. 7.12). The effect of strain rate 
on the formation of free radicals in polychloroprene will be discussed in Section II A.

7. Phenomenology of Free Radical Formation 
In all of these cases the variation of free radical concentration seems to reflect 
more the changes of material response than the kinetics of decay of stressed chains. 
The effect of strain rate on radical production in comminution (grinding, milling) 
would be very difficult to determine and no results have been reported. 
c. Effect of Temperature 
1. Apparent Energy of Bond Scission 
It is presumed that the stress-induced scission of chain molecules is achieved through 
the cooperative action of mechanical forces (lowering the bond's binding potential 
barrier) and of statistically fluctuating thermal vibrations supplying the remaining 
increment of energy which is necessary to split the loaded bond. It is also believed 
that Eq. (5.57) provides an adequate description of how mechanical and thermal 
energy affect the rate kc of the thermo-mechanical chain scission process. If this 
presumption is correct, the lack of thermal vibrational energy should increase the 
stability of a stressed bond. Vice versa an increase in thermal energy should make 
previously stable bonds reach the critical level of excitation and should break them. 
It is of interest to quantitatively analyze this aspect of interaction of thermal and 
mechanical energy terms in the scission kinetics of 6-polyamide chains. 
The largest energy available to one RCONHCH2-CH2R' bond within a time 
period of l/kb is (Eq. 5.57 for ne = 1): 
(7.3) 
Using as before a value of ""0 equal to 1012 S-l, a value of ~ of 5.53· 10-6 
m3/mol, and a rate kb = l/Tb = 1/48 S-l the thermal term in Eq. (7.3) has, at a 
temperature of 20°C, a value of 77 .2 kl /mol. The stress term ~ 1/1 must reach, there-
fore, a value of 110.8 kl/mol before U(T) is larger than the Uo of PA 6 and bond 
rupture at room temperature can occur. At 200 K the thermal term has decreased 
to 52.7 kl/mol. In order to provide a total energy of 188 kl/mol, the mechanical 
term must now reach 135.3 before bond breakage will occur within 48 s. For a 
chain segment containing ne weak bonds the rate of scission, 1 /T e' employed in the 
above calculations will be I/Te = nc/Tb. 
If one assumes that neither ~ nor Uo depend on temperature, one has to conclude 
that at 200 K it is possible to raise the molecular stress to a level which is 17% higher 
than the largest molecular stress attainable at room temperature. In other words, a 
polyamide fiber highly strained at 200 K will quite stable contain many bonds with 
~ 1/1 values between 110 and 135 kl /mol. Those bonds will break, of course, if the 
temperature is raised to room temperature provided that no other means of stress 
relaxation (slip, uncoiling) become available to the strained chain segment. 
The search for chain scission events during an upward temperature scan can be 
called a critical experiment for the validity of both the kinetic equation (Equation 
5.57) and the morpholOgical model (Fig. 7.5). These investigations have been carried 
out in the Deutsches Kunststoff-Institut in Darmstadt. Following earlier experiments

206,227,248,269 and 290 K. These tests showed the same stepwise increase of 
radical concentration and a relaxing stress as reported earlier by them [6, 7, 11, 17] 
and other authors [3, 4, 10, 14] and as described in Section A. The result ofa step-
temperature experiment is shown in Figure 7.13. Whereas the stress relaxation is 
much more pronounced here than it is in a step-strain test, the radical accumulation

appears to be very similar in both experiments. The authors [11] established that 
the final radical concentration [R (T, e)] practically did not depend on the way T 
and e were attained. Their experiment has proven the contention made earlier about 
the kinetics of thermo mechanical chain scission. It has also proven that the·highly 
loaded chains do show in the region T < 260 K essentially no slip or anelastic defor-
mation during the time they are held at the high load, despite the considerable 
amount of overall stress relaxation. A slight loss of stressed chains becomes apparent 
at T>270 K. 
The equivalence of thermal and mechanical action on a given network of chains 
is further illustrated by calculating the relative length L/Lo of those intrafibrillar 
chains which are just about to break. One considers that condition to be fulfilled 
if the 1/J (L), calculated from Eq. (7.1) for La = Lo and introduced into Eq. (7.3), 
yields Uo: 
( L) _ (l - xE/Ec)e/(l -x) + 1 
Lo -1 +(Uo -RT£nwo!kc)/PEk • 
(7.4) 
153 

7. Phenomenology of Free Radical Formation 
E and Ec are respectively the (temperature-dependent) Young's moduli of the 
sample as a whole and of the crystal lamellae in chain axis direction, x is the degree 
of sample crystallinity. 
Equation (7.4) relates sample strain e, temperature T, and relative length L/Lo 
of critically loaded chain segments, but subject to the condition that no chain slip 
occurs simultaneously. Under this condition the following equivalence between in-
cremental changes of sample strain and temperature is obtained from Eq. (7.4): 
.::le=- (I -x).::lT [LRQnwo/kc -{(I + Uo -RTQnwo/kc)~ -I}. 
(1 - xE/Ec) 
Lo (3 Ek

. d(E/Ec)/dT ]. 
(7.5) 
1 - xE/Ec 
The two terms in the square brackets refer respectively to the change of chain 
strength and of strain distribution with temperature. Using the kinetic parameters 
employed in evaluating Eq. (7.3) for PA 6 chains, values of Ec = 25 GN/m2 and of 
Ek = 200 GN/m2 as previously, and an estimated temperature coefficient d(E/Ec)dT 
of -0.8· 10- 3 K- 1 one obtains at a temperature of -20°C the following quantita-
tive evaluation of Eq. (7.5): 
.::le = - [0.12.10-3 L/Lo + 0.48.10- 3 (1.1 L/Lo -I)].::l T. 
(7.6) 
This means that for a critically loaded PA 6 chain segment with L/Lo = 1.1 a 
temperature increase of 10 K can be compensated by a decrease of strain of only 
0.23%. The result of this calculation agrees fairly well with the average value of 
0.3%/10 K derivable from the experiments of Johnsen and Klinkenberg [11]. For 
preoriented PA 6 fibers they observed that at -60°C a sample strain of 14.6% led 
to the same number of (1017 ) free radicals as a strain of 12.2% at +20 °C. 
The loading of possibly present long interfibrillar tie-segments is essentially 
determined by 1 + e rather than 1 + ea. Accordingly in Eq. (7 .5) the first term in 
square brackets and a front factor equal to .::l T must be retained. For P A 6 this leads to a 
.::le equal to -0.24· 10- 3 .::IT L/Lo, i.e. to 0.26%/10 K at L/Lo = 1.1. This compari-
son does not permit, therefore, to rule out the existence of interfibrillar tie-segments. 
2. Rate of Bond Scission 
A rate of bond scission can be defined in terms of time as d [R]/ dt or in terms of 
strain as d [R]/ de. The relation between the two rate expressions is defined by the 
identity

I. Radical Formation in Thermoplastics 
In the absence of plastic flow (chain scission at strains of 10 to 30%) the rate 
can be derived numerically from Eq. (7.2); since the rate will depend on the shape 
of the tie-segment length distribution, No (Li)' no general analytical function can 
be given for d[R]/de. The effect, however, of a change of € on d[R]/de is the same 
as that illustrated by Figure 7.10. The effect of the strain e 1 at which the rate ofbond 
scission is determined, depends on the shape of the segment length distribution, i.e. 
on the number AN(L/Lo) of chains having a relative length L/Lo suitable to be 
broken by an increment Ae of sample strain:

In Figures 7.6 and 7.7 typical segment length distributions are given. 
A change of temperature will affect the rate of radical production in three ways. 
Firstly the number N of highly extended chains will decrease if thermally activated 
slip becomes possible. Secondly the activation energy U (T) decreases with increasing 
temperature. Thirdly the sample modulus E and the crystalline modulus Ec are af-
fected by temperature. 
If in a region of sufficiently low temperatures chain slip can be excluded i.e. if 
~/ 
is constant with T the temperature affects solely the width A (L/Lo) of the 
dL Lo 
chain segment population which is critically loaded by a strain increase: 
A(L/Lo) = 
(1 - xE/Ec)/(1 - x) 
Ae 
[1 + (Uo -
RTQnwo/kc)/~Ek] . 
(7.9) 
Employing the same values as used in the evaluation of Eq. (7.3) one arrives at 
A(L/Lo) = 1.7 .1e at 20°C and at .1(L/Lo) = 1.6.1e at -60°C. This means for 
example that a given distribution of segments with relative lengths L/Lo between 
1.1 and 1.3 break at room temperature within the strain interval from 12 to 13.5%. 
At a temperature of -60°C sample strains of between 13.5 and 15.1% are required. 
A completely different chain loading mechanism prevails during the plastic de-
formation of polymers at strains of between 30 and several hundred per cent. In that 
case a chain will rupture as a consequence of the frictional forces encountered by 
the cham itself or by other morphological units in the dynamic shearing (cf. Chap-
ter 5 II E). The obtainable axial chain stresses are proportional to the molecular or 
fibrillar friction coefficients and to the strain rate E. The number of critically loaded 
chains will reflect, therefore, the strong increase of the friction coefficient with de-
creasing temperature. Davis et al. [19] strained sheets of high molecular weight poly-
ethylene in air and observed the formation of peroxy radicals. At a level of true strain 
£n £/£0 of e.g. 1.1 - which corresponds to a conventional strain of 200% - the con-
centration of the peroxy radicals increased from 5 . 1014 cm- 3 at 294 K to 
1016 cm- 3 at 160 K. The rate of radical accumulation, d[R]/d £n(£/£o), revealed 
two transition regions, one between 180 and 200 K and another beginning at 250 K. 
155 

7. Phenomenology of Free Radical Formation 
The low temperature transition was assigned to the transition of amorphous PE to the 
glassy state, the other to slippage of chains within crystal lamellae [19]. 
3. Concentration at Break 
The increase of temperature has a fourfold effect on the number of free radicals ob-
served at the point of macroscopic fracture. Firstly as seen previously the bond 
strength is decreased and thus chain scission at a given molecular stress is facilitated. 
Secondly the decrease in intermolecular attraction and the increase in molecular 
mobility lead to more rapid relaxation of molecular stresses. For the same reason 
- thirdly - the density of stored elastic energy at a given strain level is decreased 
which will in turn affect crack stability and propagation. Fourthly, the increased 
reactivity of the free radicals may lead to an increased discrepancy between the con-
centrations of radicals formed and of radicals observed at the point of failure. 
Whenever possible the fourth point has been taken into consideration and radical 
concentrations have been corrected for losses due to recombination or other decay 
reactions of the (secondary) radicals under consideration. In the case of 6 polyamide 
fibers [5, 11, 17, 18] the radical decay is a second order recombination reaction with 
the rate constant depending on type, location, and mobility of the radicals (see Sec-
tion III below). 
In Figure 7.14 the concentration of free radicals at fracture of 6 polyamide 
fibers is shown as observed and also corrected for radical decay during and after sample 
fracture [18]. The indicated decrease of the radical concentration at break towards

lower temperatures was well confirmed by Johnsen and Klinkenberg [11] who ex-
tended their measurements to -67 °e. At that temperature they obtained a concen-
tration which was by a factor of 8 smaller than that at room temperature. 
The first three of the initially mentioned temperature effects can be better un-
derstood if one makes use of the segment length distribution model. If, in fact, at 
low temperatures the changing bond strength is the only temperature dependent para-
156 

I. Radical Formation in Thermoplastics 
meter then a chain length distribution derived at about -25°C should exactly in-
clude the (narrower) distributions at still lower temperatures. Vice versa from one 
measured step-strain free-radical curve all narrower ones must be predictable. John-
sen and Klinkenberg [11, 13] have confirmed that the chain length distributions 
obtained at temperatures between -67 and -25°C are derived from one and the 
same "master" distribution which is skewed to a different extent at the right hand 
side. At higher temperatures (-4 and 17°C) discrepancies between the apparent dis-
tributions and the master distribution are observed. They are interpreted as indica-
tion of structural changes leading to a relaxation of some overstressed chains. These 
chains may, however, break at a later stage of the loading process [11, 13]. The re-
laxation and slip effect is stronger at higher temperatures and at 50°C it clearlyout-
weighs the effect of diminished bond strength, i.e. the total number of broken bonds 
at fracture decreases. Beyond 50°C most of the chain segments belonging to the 
master distribution escape chain scission because the crystal blocks are no longer 
able to exert and maintain large enough molecular stresses. At this point it may re-
main open which mechanisms are responsible for the stress relieving structural 
changes. 
In the above sections were discussed the scission of tie chains in highly oriented 
fibers. Judging from the absence of any scale effect the molecular fracture events 
are evenly distributed throughout the amorphous volume of the stressed sample. 
Those "volume" concentrations of 1015 to 1018 spins/cm3 accounted for almost 
the total radical intensity whereas the fmal fracture surfaces (with estimated radical 
populations of 1012 to 1013 spins/cm2 ) did not noticeably contribute towards the 
total number of radicals observed in tensile straining of the fiber samples. This is 
different if the mechanical degradation is achieved through milling, grinding and/or 
cutting. In all these techniques comminution is achieved through failure of virgin 
material resulting from the application of multiaxial stress particularly involving 
compressive components. In impact loading of platelike or granular samples com-
pressive waves may be generated. Upon reflection on boundaries or discontinuities, 
compressive waves become dilational waves giving rise to tensile fracture. All forces 
combine to overcome the cohesive forces and to create new surface area. Those chains 
which break in this process are either intersecting weak cross-sections and/or are con-
tained in shear zones along a suitable direction. It must be assumed, therefore, that 
chains are broken preferentially - but not exclusively - in the zones of new surface. 
The surface concentration of free radicals in ground polymers has been deter-
mined by different investigators [20-23). As to be expected the mobility of the 
chains within the degrading material strongly effects the obtainable radical concen-
trations. Backman and DeVries [21,22] sliced 66 PA, PP, and PE in a nitrogen at-
mosphere and transferred the slices within less than 0.5 s into liquid nitrogen and 
determined the number of free radicals by ESR. The degradation temperature was 
varied between -20°C and 90°C. The authors observed a rapid decrease of surface 
concentrations at the respective glass transitions (Fig. 7.15). It should be noted that 
the rate of decay of the radicals formed also increases beyond T g' but that this loss 
of radicals amounts to less than 30% [18]. From the level of the low temperature 
radical concentrations it can be concluded that the average fracture plane breaks be-
tween 5 and 10% of all chains intersecting the plane. Pazonyi et al. [22] investigated

polyvinylchloride with differing contents of plasticizer (30, 40, 50, and 60% respec-
tively of dioctylphthalate, DOP). They estimated that cutting at 30°C led to the 
scission of (128, 105, 55 and 34% respectively of all) chains intersecting the fracture 
plane. They also investigated low and high density polyethylene and found 1.39 and 
1.17 . 1015 spinS/ cm2 which means they had to cut 120 and 104% respectively of the 
intersecting chains. Pazonyi et al. did their cutting in an ethanolic solution of diphenyl 
picryl hydrazyl the color change of which was used as a measure for the number of 
free radicals formed. The unusually large molecular cutting ratios given by Pazonyi 
et al. and their discrepancy with the values cited earlier are noted and discussed by 
Salloum and Eckert [23]. They point out that reactions of DPPH with ethanol and 
with polymer surfaces not containing free radicals may take place thus accounting 
for the excessively high radical numbers determined by Pazonyi. Salloum and Eckert 
drilled PE, Nylon, and PP in a solution of DPPH in benzene. They obtained 0.1-2 
(PE), 0.5-4 (6 PA) and 7-9 . 1013 spins/cm2 (PP) respectively. The first two values 
are in agreement with the results of Backman and De Vries, the latter is not. 
Both laboratories [20-22] conclude that free radicals are formed within a sur-
face layer of finite thickness. From a study of oxygen diffusion rates and of the con-
version of the original ESR signal from secondary 6 nylon radicals to that of peroxy 
radicals Backman and DeVries determine that 50% of all "damage" occurred within 
a layer of less than 0.6 JlIl1 from the surface. The remaining 50% of chain radicals 
were found in a depth of up to 3 JlIl1 from the surface. Considering the morphology 
of the degraded polymers, the mechanics of the comminution process, and the mo-
bility of the primary formed free radicals the spatial distribution of the secondary 
radicals can be understood. In this case the pullout and breakage of individual PA 
chains appears unlikely in view of the crystal strength. As we have discussed in Chap-
ter 5, a 6 PA chain embedded within a crystallite with more than 1.7 nm of its length 
will rather break than be pulled away from the crystallite. The pull out of whole 
158 

I. Radical Formation in Thermoplastics 
micro fibrils from a fracture surface very probably will occur and will be accompanied 
by breakage of interfibrillar tie chains thus introducing damage within a surface layer 
of up to 1 pm depth. Even more important will be the heavy plastic deformation of 
the material ahead of a growing fracture surface. The propagation of free radicals 
certainly contributes to deepen the layer of apparent damage. The layer depths ob-
served in these experiments do coincide, however, very well with the lower limits of 
particle sizes obtainable in mechanical degradation [24] indicating, that the damage 
may indeed be introduced mechanically up to the observed depths. 
D. Effect of Sample Treatment 
The effect of heat treatment on structure, fracture strength and chain scission has 
been very extensively investigated by Statton, Park and DeVries [25-27] and by 
Uoyd [5). With respect to our understanding of chain breakages in annealed fibers 
the following morphological changes seem to be particularly noteworthy. Relaxed 
heat treatments result in [25]: 
1. Increases of the degree of crystallinity, perfection of crystallites, density, chain 
folding, Young's modulus, and intensity of the fluid-like component of the NMR-
signal. 
2. Decreases of sample length (shrinkage), breaking strength, sonic modulus, and T g' 
The changes are the more intense the higher the annealing temperature. Tension 
during annealing tends to modify or reduce the above listed effects. Relaxed and 
tension annealing do, however, increase the long period. 
The morphological changes certainly have a bearing on the molecular stress dis-
tribution and chain breakage. In Figure 7.16 the histogram from an ESR step-strain 
test is reproduced which was obtained from a tension-free annealed polyamide sample 
at 199°C [27). The histogram is broader, indicating a less homogeneous distribution 
of molecular strains, and it is shifted towards higher strains by about two to four

bution of the annealed sample is compared with that of an unannealed reference

Fig. 7.17. Probability plot of histogram of 
radical concentration of 1. reference sample 
and 2. sample slack annealed at 199 DC [4,51. 
The observed conformational changes in slack annealing have been interpreted 
[25-27] as an increase in relative length of (the formerly) extended tie chain seg-
men ts due to defect migration out of the crystal blocks. The number of regular 
chain folds also increases. Shrinkage of the yarn appears to be governed by the num-
ber of folds introduced. The structural changes occurring during annealing are me-
chanically stable and not simply reverted under tensile stress. In Figure 7.18 a model 
repres~ntation of the conformational changes in annealing are given [4, 5]. Because 
of defect migration one obtains in tension annealing a relaxation of local molecular 
strains and thus a larger number of extended chain segments. On the basis of this 
experimental evidence Statton has constructed a string model of slack annealed, 
tension annealed, and reference fibers which is shown in Figure 7.19 [28]. The effect 
of the annealing process on the total number of free radicals formed in subsequent 
straining at room temperature and on fracture strength is shown in Figures 7.20 and 
7.21. The annealing at maximum tension (11.7% elongation) does lead to a smaller 
number of spins at fracture and may be explained by the breakage of chains during 
tension annealing. Intermediate positive annealing strains (not shown in Fig. 7.20) 
do slightly increase the number of spins. The opposite effects of annealing tempera-
ture and of constraint of the sample during annealing on the homogeneity of the 
chain length distribution are shown in Figure 7.22. These effects are discussed in 
more detail in Chapter 8.

II. Free Radicals in Stressed Rubbers 
A. Preorientation, Ductility, and Chain Scission 
In Section I we have discussed the stress-induced chain scission of thermoplastic 
polymers. As we have seen chain scission could occur whenever the intermolecular 
forces acting on tightly embedded sections of extended (tie) molecules were strong 
enough to resist segment slip during deformation in such a manner as to give rise to 
axial forces equal to or larger than the mechanical strength of the molecular chain. 
Exactly the same considerations apply to chain scission in elastomers which are in 
a temperature region below Tg • Andrews, Reed, and Natarajan [29-31] have studied 
162

under these aspects the deformation behavior of sulphur cured natural rubber (cis-
polyisoprene), dicumyl peroxide-cured natural rubber, and polychloroprene. They 
observed that (see Fig. 7.23) in the temperature region I from glass transition (200K) 
to 160 K the deformation behavior of natural rubber was very similar to that of a 
thermoplastic polymer, with a clearly discernible yield point and a yield stress which

Fig. 7.23. Deformation and fracture behavior of preoriented polyisoprenes and polychloroprene 
(after Andrews and Reed, [31 J. 
increased with decreasing temperature. Following a transition region there was a 
narrow temperature band (II) between 150 and 130 K within which brittle fracture 
occurred at strains of less than 5%. For still lower temperatures - and only for these 
temperatures - the authors [29-31] made the very interesting observation that the 
deformation behavior was determined by the state or orientation of the stressed net-
work. Unoriented rubber specimens behaved brittle just as they do within the tem-
perature band above. A second group of samples was prepared by first preorienting 
them at room temperature by uniaxial straining to 100 to 200%, and then cooling 
them down to 90 to 130 K (region III). These samples showed a ductile deforma-
tion behavior (Fig. 7.23). In this case the ductile low temperature deformation was 
accompanied by microvoiding in narrow striations, the formation of detectable 
amounts of free radicals, and by absorption of environmental gases within the micro-
voids. These gases expanded upon warming of the deformed specimens and gave rise 
to a peculiar foaming effect. The observed free radical spectra of sulphur-cured poly-
isoprene have been assigned to allyl main chain radicals stemming from the scission 
of the (weakest) bond located between the two a-methylene groups. These radicals 
appeared together with a contribution of possibly RS radicals. The spectra of dicumyl 
peroxide-cured polyisoprene and polychloroprene were assigned to secondary peroxy 
radicals ROO. The concentration offree radicals (in polychloroprene) varied with 
strain rate and yielded a maximum of 6 . 1016 spins/g at a strain rate of 0.01 S-1 
[31 ]. 
Taking all these observations together, the following model of the deformation 
behavior of elastomers below their glass transition temperature is proposed: In region I 
intermolecular attraction is sufficiently strong to permit energy elastic deformation 
of chain segments. Gradually at first, and exclusively beyond the yield point, slip and 
163 

7. Phenomenology of Free Radical Formation 
reorientation of chain segments occur. Chain scission is negligible because chains will 
rather slip than break. In temperature region II where brittle fracture occurs irrespec-
tive of the state of preorientation the intermolecular attraction seems to be just large 
enough to permit the axial loading of chain segments up to their breaking stress. In 
the absence of local strain hardening the largest crack initiated within the specimen 
during deformation to the 5% level will rapidly expand and prevent the growth of 
any other crack nuclei. As discussed for thermoplastics, the formation of essentially 
~ne plane of fracture is hardly sufficient to produce a detectable amount of free radicals. 
Unoriented rubber specimens (samples frozen in the relaxed state) show the same brittle 
behavior also in temperature region III (90 to 130 K). Specimens preoriented by ex-
tensions of 100 to 200%, however, obviously have gained the property oflocal strain 
hardening. The nature of this effect can only be speculated on and probably is re-
lated to the build up of partially oriented microfibrils within the preoriented elasto-
mers. The result of local strain hardening is that the flaws and defects which are still 
present develop into a system of interconnected microvoids and extended fibrils form-
ing the large and clearly visible striations. Environmental gases are adsorbed to the 
newly formed surfaces. Since the micro fibrils are strong enough to carry the load 
transferred upon them the strained sample will not break but more and more defects 
will develop into crazes and striations. The largest number of striations appears at 
medium extension rates (0.01 s-1 in polychloroprene). The large local deformation 
(up to more than 100% strain) which is found throughout the total volume of the 
sample together with the strong intermolecular attraction between different chain 
segments leads to a large axial excitation - and breakage - of those chain segments 
which play the role of tie molecules. As the discussed results show, the spin concen-
tration at break of elastomers in temperature region III is comparable to that ob-
tained from 6 polyamide. In case of a large preorientation of 300% (in polychloro-
prene) a ductile deformation behavior and the formation of free radicals are observed 
[31]. The deformation is macroscopically homogeneous. No striations or crazes are 
visible indicating that the strain hardening is more effective than at lesser preorien-
tations. The growth of microvoids obviously is stopped before they coalesce and 
form crazes. The absence of large scale gas adsorption and of foaming upon subse-
quent heating together with differences in the observed ESR spectrum support this 
view [31]. 
Brown, DeVries, and Williams duplicated these experiments and extended them 
to Hycar 1043, an acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber [32] and to Silastic E RTV, a silicone 
elastomer [33]. They confirmed for these polymers the above described effect of pre-
strain on the stress-strain behavior at low temperatures (118 to 193 K) the formation 
of free radicals with increasing sample strain, and the effect of strain rate on radical 
concentration with a maximum at a rate of 9 . 10-4 S-1 . For these polymers they 
did not observe, however, the three temperature zones mentioned above which are 
characterized by distinctly different types of mechanical response. They also propose 
that during preorientation numerous regions of higher strength and degree of orien-
tation are created which later serve to arrest developing microcracks before those 
can attain a critical size. The fact that for the latter two polymers [32,33] only one 
region of ductile and one region of brittle fracture were observed may be attributed 
to different physical and chemical properties of those networks (configuration, cross-
164

link density, glass transition temperature). Some of these structural parameters will 
be studied in the following section. 
B. Cross-Link Density, Impurities, Fillers 
We have seen above that in low temperature ductile deformation of rubbers a large 
number of chain segments break which indicates that the local axial stresses exceed 
the strengths of the chain segments. We have shown earlier that the stresses required 
for bond breakage are more than two orders of magnitude larger than those applied 
macroscopically to deform the rubber specimens. The appearance of free radicals, 
therefore, indicates the highly inhomogeneous distribution of local stresses. The 
radical intensity gives an account of the number N of segments which have been 
stressed beyond their strength; N will depend, therefore, on all parameters which 
raise the local stresses like cross-link density or content of reinforcing fillers, which 
decrease the bond strength like presence of hetero-groups in the main chain, or which 
affect the number of observed radicals through radical reactions. 
Andrews and Reed [31] observed an increase in radical intensity with increasing 
cross-link density of SUlphur cured natural rubber (Fig. 7.24) using the preorienta-
tion-technique described above. This observation is well in keeping with the fact that

tensile stresses of identically strained rubbery specimens increase with increasing 
cross-link density i.e. decreasing chain length between cross-links. The effect of im-

7. Phenomenology of Free Radical Formation 
radical reactions or a direct effect on bond strengths it is believed that the impurities 
constitute stress raising inhomogeneities [31]. 
It is not always necessary to prestrain rubbers to induce the development of a 
large number of microcracks distributed throughout the bulk of the rubber sample. 
Wilde et al. [34, 35] have shown that certain granular fIllers can promote bond rup-
ture during sample fracture. Again the studies were by necessity conducted at tem-
peratures below 210 K where the radicals were sufficiently stable. Fillers in elasto-
mers are commonly used for a variety of reasons. In any case the presence of such 
fillers increases the complexity of the micromechanics of deformation and fracture. 
The presence of the filler results in very non-homogeneous localized stress fields 
ranging from levels of high strain concentration to complete separation between the 
matrix and filler (dewetting). The filler particles may serve as crack arrestors and/or 
initiators and thereby alter the fracture strength, resilience, and/or toughness. Wilde 
studied four systems all filled to approximately 50% by weight. These were: 
1. 29 J.1.ID glass beads in EPDM, 
2. silane treated 15 fJ.m glass bead filled polyisoprene, 
3. NaCI fIlled polyisoprene and 
4. HiSil 233 (silica) filled polyisoprene. 
The first system provided very weak interaction between filler and matrix, the 
last very strong interaction, and the other two demonstrated intermediate filler-
matrix interaction. All systems were tested in temperature region I (I 70 to 200 K), 
a region within which an unfilled rubber without pre orientation produces no free 
radicals in tensile straining. Three of the four filled systems, however, behaved dif-
ferently. It was found that the untreated glass filled elastomer fractured with no 
detectable production of free radicals, fracture in the rubbers filled with silane 
treated glass and NaCI produced easily detectable concentrations of radicals 
(3.21 . 1014 spins/cm3 ). The HiSil system produced at some temperatures and 
strain rates, up to an order of magnitude more radicals than NaCI or treated glass 
(7.86· 1014 spins/cm3 ). In his PhD thesis Wilde [35] details a rather comprehensive 
comparison of scanning electron microscope photographs with the ESR results. The 
photographs indicate that at room temperature dewetting started to occur in the 
untreated glass system at strains of less than 10 to 20%, in the treated glass beads 
and NaCI systems it occurred at strains of between 50 and 100%, and in the HiSil 
system at strains greater than 200%. Scanning electron micrographs of the fracture 
surfaces at all temperatures between 150 and 300 K revealed the same findings and 
showed 1. that untreated glass beads were sitting essentially loose in the "smooth" 
vacuoles or voids on the fracture surface, 2. that treated glass surfaces and NaCI 
behaved similar to untreated glass except that here the vacuoles were not so smooth 
and that there was material adhering to the filler particles, and 3. that the HiSil 
particles were embedded in the matrix at the fracture surface with the rubber ad-
hering completely to the particle surfaces. 
A slightly different two-phase system with strong bonds at phase boundaries 
is that obtained from triblock copolymers such as styrene-butadiene. As discussed 
in Chapter 2 such a copolymer molecule is composed of rigid (styrene) end blocks 
joined by elastomeric (butadiene) center blocks. The styrene blocks aggregate to 
form small domains which act as cross-links leading to a rubberlike elasticity of the 
166 

III. Mechanically Relevant Radical Reactions 
block copolymer at ambient temperatures but to the possibility of plastic deforma-
tion at high temperatures. For an understanding of the fracture behavior of these 
systems it would be useful to identify in which of the phases molecular rupture 
most often occurs. The direct means of accomplishing this goal would be to frac-
ture the material and analyze the hyperfine structure of the resulting ESR spectra. 
In the temperature range between liqUid nitrogen and room temperature, however, 
tensile straining does not lead to sufficiently observable accumulations of free radicals. 
As a consequence, De Vries, Roylance, and Williams [36] adapted the less conclusive 
but more straight-forward method of comparing the spectrum of styrene-butadiene 
block copolymers (SBS) with those of styrene and butadiene alone. These studies 
were done on grindings to accumulate large amounts of fracture surface and at liquid 
nitrogen temperatures. The low temperature made the radicals more stable and hope-
fully "froze" the primary radicals. Comparison of the spectra of the three materials 
showed that the spectrum in the SBS contained all the lines of the butadiene radical 
but not of the styrene radical. The radical of the SBS system was, therefore, assigned 
to the butadiene phase. Unfortunately the study leaves open the questions as to 
whether or not the radical formed by grinding at low temperatures is the same as 
that presumably formed under normal conditions at room temperature and whether 
the observed radical is the primary radical or a secondary one. 
Taking together the experimentally observed effects of the five parameters im-
purity content, degree of cross-linking, ease of crystallite formation, strength of 
filler-matrix adhesion, and presence of different phases on the nature and intensity of 
free radicals formed we derive at the following conclusions. All five parameters tend 
to increase the apparent cross-link density and decrease the extensibility of chain 
segments between cross-links. They thus enhance the forces acting at a given strain 
and also the ultimate forces that can be transmitted onto chain segments. Both con-
ditions are necessary before chain stresses can exceed chain strengths. Furthermore 
all five parameters increase the number of actual or potential defect sites and cause 
a better spatial distribution of chain scission events. If chains fail they will always 
be located in the amorphous or more flexible regions of the (hetero-phase) elasto-
mers. 
III. Mechanically Relevant Radical Reactions 
In Sections I and II of this Chapter primary and secondary free radicals have been 
treated as microprobes which characterize occurrence and molecular environment 
of chain breakages. As shown in Chapter 6 the primary mechano-radicals are always 
chain end radicals which are mostly unstable. At a rate depending on temperature 
these radicals will transfer the free electrons and thus "convert" to secondary ra-
dicals. This reaction and also subsequent conversion and decay reactions including 
recombination are relevant with respect to an interpretation of the fracture process 
in two ways. Firstly these reactions interfere with a determination of the concentra-
tion and molecular environment of the original chain scission points. Secondly they 
change the physical properties of other network chains through the introduction of 
167 

7. Phenomenology of Free Radical Formation 
unpaired electrons and the formation of crosslinks. For a discussion of spectro-
scopic details and of the stability and conformation of the free radicals the reader 
is referred to the comprehensive monograph of R£nby and Rabek [37] and to the 
review articles of Campbell [38] and of Sohma et al. [39]. In the following the me-
chanically relevant aspects of radical transfer and decay are reported. 
A. Transfer Reactions 
At this point the geometrical aspect of transfer reactions is to be investigated. Through 
breakage of an elastically strained chain the primary radicals are formed at either side 
of the breakage site. Because of the axial chain stresses the new chain end radicals 
rapidly retract from each other. They are thus being prevented from recombination. 
The primary radicals then convert to secondary ones mostly by transfer of a hydrogen 
atom (see Table 6.1). If hydrogen transfer occurs along one and the same chain no 
effect on the phYSical network properties is to be foreseen. If, however, a hydrogen 
is abstracted from a neighboring chain the radical is transferred to a mid-chain posi-
tion at a hitherto uneffected chain segment. There is strong evidence for the occur-
rence of both processes, the radical migration along a chain [39] and the hydrogen 
hopping accross chains [40]. The hydrogen hopping process was demonstrated by 
Dole et al. [40] who had molecular deuterium gas, D2, diffuse into irradiated poly-
ethylene; D2 was then converted to HD by the following reactions: 
R + D2 --RID+D 
b + R'H--R' 
+HD. 
Although in this experiment a gaseous tracer had been used it is believed that 
hydrogen abstraction from a hydrocarbon chain proceeds in the same manner. In 
view of the mobility of the chain end radical the hydrogen abstraction seems to be 
a logical vehicle for the transfer of a free electron to a central position within another 
chain segment. 
The radical migration along a chain was found by Sohma et al. [39] to give the 
only plaUSible explanation for his observation that in PE and PMMA chain end radicals 
convert to a near-end radical:

III. Mechanically Relevant Radical Reactions 
Sohma indicates that also in these polymers radical migration along the chain 
and successive hydrogen abstraction are both important mechanisms of radical migra-
tion. 
Transfer reactions are, of course, influenced by the presence of impurities or 
additives which are active as radical acceptors or radical scavengers. Their mechanical 
relevance lies in the fact that they reduce or prevent transfer of free radicals to cen-
tral chain positions, radical recombination, and/or cross-linking. The latter aspect is 
discussed in Chapter 8. For a review of radical reactions with H2, D2, O2, S02, NO 
and N02, NH3 , H2S, and various halogens the reader is referred to the works of 
Campbell [38] and of RImby and Rabek [37], the latter being especially concerned 
with the reactions of oxygen in its different forms (triplet and singlet molecular 
oxygen, atomic oxygen). 
B. Recombination and Decay 
The normal decay of macroradicals by recombination in the solid phase is a second 
order reaction [5,11,17-18,37-39,41-43] 
[R(t)] = [Ro ]/(1 + k [Ro ]t). 
(7.10) 
The decay rate term kRo depends - as expected - on temperature: for unloaded 
fibers under He atmosphere values of 0.0014 S-1 (75°C) and 0.0110 S-1 (100 0c) 
have been determined [18]. This value ties in with the 0.001 s-1 measured at 50 
and 60°C under N2 [11,41]. It should be noted that the recombination reaction 
is slowed down by the application of tensile forces as for instance during the pre-
fracture loading period: under near maximum tensile stress the decay rate terms 
were only 0.00035 S-1 (75°C) and 0.00075 S-1 (100 0c) respectively [18]. The 
kinetics of decay is also affected by conversion reactions (e.g. of alkyl into allyl 
radicals) or catalytic effects [37]. 
The effect of the mobility of the radical site on the recombination rate has been 
clearly shown by the pressure [44-46] and temperature dependence [41-43,47-49] 
of radical decay in e.g. PE, PP, PA 6, 66, and 12, and PPO. The decay curves of free 
radical populations in (irradiated) polymers as a function of increasing temperature 
reveal a number of plateaus each corresponding to radicals trapped in a particular 
morphological site. A transition from one plateau to the next indicates that one 
species of the trapped free radicals has become sufficiently mobile for recombination 
(chemically identical radicals in crystalline and amorphous regions may differ in steric 
configuration which also effects the rate of recombination [37,42,47]). The transi-
tions are hence associated with the corresponding mechanical 'Y, (3, and a dispersions 
[41-43). 
As already indicated earlier apparent steps in those radical concentration curves 
which are obtained by straining fibers by equal increments at different temperatures 
[11,19], are not solely related to dispersion regions of the modulus but reflect de-
tails of the relative segment length distribution as well.

7. Phenomenology of Free Radical Formation 
For chemically different radical species generally different decay constants with 
different activation energies are observed. Tino et al. [42] determined for the central 
polyamide radical-NH-CH-CH2- in the temperature region of 15 to 50 °c an 
activation energy for decay of 10 kcal/mol, for the chain end radical-CONH-CH2 
a value of 5.2 kcal/mol. 
Studies of the effect of hydrostatic pressure on free radical decay have the aim 
of elucidating the mobility and the distance of migration. A series of experiments 
has been carried out at the Polymer Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences in 
Bratislava. The rate constants of free radical decay decrease exponentially with in-
crea~ing pressure [44-46]. At low temperatures the rate constant varies only slightly 
with pressure. The retarding effect becomes stronger at higher temperatures; the 
closer the decay temperature to the glass transition temperature T g the more pro-
nounced the stabilizing effect of pressure. Of course the pressure effect shows a 
saturation once the pressure is so large as to inhibit the molecular motion in question, 
8 kb for the Q( relaxation in PE and PV AC at 80-110 0 C [44], 15 kb for the Q( relaxa-
tion in 6 PA [44J. 
c. Anomalous Decay 
Sohma et al. [39] investigated the thermal decay of mechano-radicals. They observed 
for PE, PP, and PTFE an increase in the concentration of free radicals while increas-
ing the temperature from 77 to 170 K. They termed this behavior which is not found 
for irradiation-produced radicals, anomalous. The anomalous increase is enhanced by 
excess triboelectric charges of the sawed samples and by the presence of oxygen [39]. 
On the basis of their extensive investigations the authors advance a mechanism for 
the creation of free radicals through heat treatment at the rather low temperatures 
of 77 to 170 K. They postulate the formation of (spectroscopically neutral) carb-
anions during the degradation process at 77 K, here illustrated for PP: 
-CH2-(CH3)CH + e-
~ -CH2-(CH3)CH-
t 
(carbanions, no ESR spectrum) 
+ 
-(CH3)CH-CH2 + e-
---. 
-(CH3)CH-CH2". 
During the "heat" treatment (100-173 K) the carbanions react with O2 to form 
spectroscopically active peroxy radicals. The released electrons leak to the ground: 
-CH2-(CH3)CH-
+ O2 
~ -CH2-(CH3)HCOO + e-
-(CH3)CH-CH2" 
+ O2 
~ -(CH3)CH-H2COO + e-. 
D. Radical Trapping Sites 
Mechanically relevant information has been obtained from an analysis of radical 
trapping sites. Thus it has been concluded in previous sections of this chapter that 
170 

References for Chapter 7 
it is the amorphous regions of a semicrystalline polymer where mechano-radicals 
are formed. Apart from that changes in sample morphology during mechanical work-
ing have been investigated by ESR technique. Kusumoto, Takayanagi et al. [50-51] 
studied PE and PP films by successively removing the amorphous material through 
nitric acid etching. They then analyzed the ESR spectra obtained by 'Y irradiation 
of the so treated films. Thus they were able to correlate the octet observed in PP with 
radicals trapped at defect sites within the crystallites, the nonet with radicals in the 
amorphous fold surfaces. The latter are especially effective radical trapping sites. 
The authors analyzed the effect of quenching, annealing, and cold-drawing on the 
mosaic-block structure of their fllms. 
From a change in line shape parameter of the PE sextet spectrum and of the 
temperature dependence of radical recombination rates the authors determined the 
increase in unoriented material content during mechanical fatigue [51]. For the 
study of the surfaces of as-grown and annealed PE single crystals Kusumoto et al. 
[52] also employed the spin-probe method. 
The ESR technique has permitted to identify initial rupture points in mechanical-
ly degraded copolymers. Lazar and SZQCS [53] investigated random, block, and graft 
copolymers of methylmethacrylate (MMA) and styrene (S). They found in a degraded 
mixture of equal parts MMA and S homopolymers equal concentrations of MMA 
and S radicals. In a random copolymer (MMA : S = 1 : 1) the styrene radical prevailed 
clearly. By comparing the reactions of mechano-radicals in ball-milled PP with those 
of "'Y-radicals" Kurokawa et al. [54] concluded that the mechano-radicals were pro-
duced and trapped on the fresh surfaces created by the breaking-up of solid poly-
propylene.

Section II B of Chapter 2 gave a description of the uniaxial deformation behavior 
of an unoriented thermoplastic polymer. It was indicated that - depending on 
experimental and material parameters - failure could occur at any of the different 
stages of a tensile loading process: 
as brittle fracture due to crack initiation and propagation during anelastic de-
formation 
as a consequence of plastic flow after necking or homogeneous yielding 
as ultimate failure following plastic deformation with strain hardening. 
It is useful, therefore, to distinguish between brittle strength, yield strength, 
and ultimate strength of a polymer. 
Quite obviously the role of chain loading and scission within the three strength 
determining mechanisms will be quite different. It has been stated repeatedly 
throughout this book that the load carrying capabilities of chain molecules are uti-
lized most effectively if chain orientation and intermolecular attraction permit 
the gradual accumulation of large axial chain stresses and oppose slip and 
173 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
void formation. It is for this reason that highly oriented polymer fibers are the most 
suitable objects to study chain loading and scission. In Chapter 7 the experimental 
observations concerning the formation of mechano-radicals and of their conversion 
have been reported. With respect to the phenomenology there is little disagree-
ment in the literature. In the first section of this chapter the possible effects of 
chain scission and of radical reactions on ultimate strength will be discussed, which 
is a more controversical subject. 
The second section concerns unoriented polymers and failure mechanisms, which 
are homogeneous on a macroscopic scale. Thus the conditions of impact loading 
(large loading rates), creep (constant load), yielding, necking, and drawing (constant 
strain rate), and fatigue (intermittent or cyclic loading) will be investigated. Elasto-
mers also belong to the group of unoriented polymers although their failure may 
occur after considerable elongation and orientation. 
The chapter closes with a discussion of chain scission caused or assisted by the 
simultaneous action of stress and aggressive environment. 
I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
A. Underlying Problems 
The undisputed fact of the rupture 0/ chains in large numbers during mechanical 
action [1] is, in itself; neither proof nor even indication that macroscopic stress relaxa-
tion, deformation and fracture are a consequence of the breakage of chains. As was 
pointed out by Kausch and Becht [2] the observed total number of broken chains 
is much too small to account (by virtue of their load carrying capability) for the 
measured reductions in macroscopic stress. As shown in Figure 7.4 the stress relaxa-
tion within a strain step (of 0.65%) amounts to 60 to 100 MN/m2 • The load having 
been carried by the 0.7 . 1017 chain segments broken during such strain step, how-
ever, is calculated to be 2.4 MN/m2 if the tie-segments had traversed just one amor-
phous region; it is n . 2.4 MN/m2 if they had spanned n such regions. For these and 
most of the following calculations a sandwich-type model of the fiber structure will 
be used such as represented in Figure 7.5 I. In the case of n = 1 the macroscopic stress 
relaxation obviou~ly has an intensity 25 to 40 times larger than the decrease of the 
accumulated molecular stresses derived from the number of the observed chain 
scission events. However, here also one must say that this discrepancy in itself is 
neither proo/nor even indication that macroscopic stress relaxation, deformation 
and fracture are not a consequence of the breakage of chains. 
A basic problem of microstructural fracture theories involving chain scission 
is clearly an elucidation of this descrepancy. Such a clarification can only be at-
tempted by widening the scope and by including other experimental observations. 
Three principal questions must be raised before supporting or discarding a chain 
scission fracture hypothesis: 
-
Does the number of chain scission events observed by anyone method corre-
spond to the number of chains actually breaking? 
174 

1. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
Does chain scission effect the mechanical properties of a polymer network in an 
indirect way, e.g. through the release of stored elastic energy or ensuing radical 
reactions? 
-
At what point and why does the phase of spatially homogeneous defect devel-
opment turn into local crack growth? Is chain scission a necessary or all acci-
dental precursor to mechanical instability? 
The discussion of the underlying problem of the nature of the primary molec-
ular processes of damage, their interaction and possible propagation has been initiated 
and constantly stimulated through the various detailed studies carried out in the 
A. F. Ioffe Physico technical Institute in Leningrad by S. N. Zhurkov and his col-
leagues [3-33]. The individual problems attacked concern 
investigation of the loading of chain segments before chain scission by IR tech-
nique [4-16] 
determination of the absolute numbers [16-18] of chain scission events using 
ESR [19-21] and IR [22-26] spectroscopy 
formation of microcracks studied by X-ray diffraction [27-29] 
-
kinetics of thermal, mechanical and molecular degradation [30-33] 
analysis of the structure, mechanical behavior and fatigue under various environ-
mental conditions in view of the foregOing considerations. These are reviewed in 
[3] and will be discussed later in this Section. 
A general remark must be made concerning the comparison and transfer of 
results obtained from different specimens (e.g. films or fibers), methods (e.g. IR or 
ESR), or laboratories. Whereas relative data such as the effect of time, temperature 
or stress on the behavior of one specimen (in one spectrometer at one laboratory) 
are generally in good agreement inconsistencies still persist with respect to absolute 
figures and to the possible structural and/or chemical identity of different specimens. 
The following discussion of the fracture work and of fracture theories involving 
chain scission will be centered around the three principal questions raised earlier 
even though they will not always be answered. 
B. Loading of Chains before Scission 
To date two methods have been employed for the determination of the distribution 
N (t/I) of (large) axial chain stresses: 
the indirect method of observing the formation of free radicals after a lowering 
of chain strengths through increasing temperatures 
the direct method of evaluating the stress-induced shift of infrared (IR) adsorp-
tion bands. 
The indirect method of obtaining stress-distributions is based on the fact that 
the strength of a chain segment decreases with increasing temperature. During an 
upward temperature scan, therefore, those chain segments will be broken successive-
ly whose strength t/lb(T) becomes smaller than their axial load. The method has 
been discussed in Section ICI of Chapter 7 for groups of chain segments with dif-
ferent relative lengths L/Lo. The ensuing relative length distribution N (L/Lo) can

easily be transformed into a stress distribution N [l/l (L/Lo)] with the aid of 
Eq. (7.1). 
This indirect method has a rather restricted applicability. It is limited to a tem-
perature region T < T 1 where interfibrillar slip is still negligible and to molecular 
stresses l/l > l/lb(T 1)' Furthermore the method does not permit the solution of a 
problem inherent to all ESR measurements; namely to determine whether the abso-
lute concentration of broken bonds is equal to twice the observed concentration of 
free radicals or whether it is (much) larger. 
To overcome this difficulty Zhurkov and his collaborators began in 1965 to 
study by an independant method, the IR technique, the effect of axial stress on 
molecular chains [4-16]. Subsequently similar [35, 37-40] infra-red studies were 
carried out in the USA. All these investigations are based on the fact that frequency 
and intensity of skeletal or backbone vibrations of chain segments respond to a 
superimposed deformation of the vibrating skeleton. In polypropylene for example 
C-C stretch vibration modes have been assigned [16, 36,41,42] to the parallel 
dichroic bands (Fig. 8.1) at 1326, 1168, 1045,975,842,456, and 398 cm- 1 . All 
of these bands have been found to be stress sensitive [36]. The stress effect manifests 
itself as a shift of the frequency of maximum absorption and in the occurrence of a 
"tail" at longer wavelengths (Fig. 8.2).

The mechanisms of the distortion of IR absorption bands of stressed polymers 
have been discussed especially by Gubanov [7-9], Kosobukin [13], Vettegren and 
Novak [15] and Wool [36]. There is a general agreement that the distorted IR absorp-
tion band profile D(v) can be related to a large number of separate oscillators with 
strongly overlapping absorption bands whose maxima are shifted by different amounts. 
The possible causes of the frequency shift of an individual stressed oscillator have 
been considered to be the quasielastic deformation of the harmonic oscillator (re-

duction of force constant under stress), the elastic increase of bond angles, changes 
of segments conformation, and the creation of defects. For small deformations one 
predicts [4-16, 36], that for the first three mechanisms there is a quite linear change 
of frequency with molecu lar stress l/I: 
!::.v' = vI/! - Vo = ex' l/I.

As discussed previously molecular stresses are a function of molecular strains 
which depend on sample morphology and chain orientation. Any real sample, there-
fore, contains a variety of differently stressed oscillators. The profile of the deformed 
band, D(v), representing such a system of oscillators can be expressed by a convolu-
tion integral: 
00 
D(v)=J F(n)U(v-n)dn. 
(8.2) 
Here F (n) is the distribution of stressed oscillators, U (v) the shape of the nor-
malized undeformed band, and n an integration variable. The distribution F (v) can 
be obtained by deconvolution and transformed into a molecular stress distribution 
by Eq. (8.1). 
As already indicated and shown in Figure 8.2 the distribution of molecular 
stresses in semi crystalline polymers contains a peak of apparently homogeneously 
stressed chain segments - related to the crystalline regions - and a tail of very dif 
ferently stressed chains - related to highly stressed tie segments. For a regular sand-
wich structure of crystalline regions having a modulus Ee and a chain axis orientation 
described by cos () one observes a frequency shift !::.v of the crystalline peak: 
!::.v= ex' Ek G cos2 () = exG. 
Ee 
(8.3) 
Thus the macroscopic stress sensitivity factor ex depends on sample-morphology 
and orientation. As shown in Figure 8.3 quite different stress sensitivities have been 
observed for identical bands in different samples [36]. In any real sample the mac-
roscopic stress sensitivity factor ex is an average value. For the 975 cm- 1 band of 
polypropylene it ranges from 2 to 6 cm- 1 per GN/m2 (Fig. 8.3). The 1168 cm- 1

I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
band of the same polymer has a larger stress sensitivity of 10 cm-1 per GN/m2 
[15]. Vettegren and Novak [15,16] report an a of 2.2 cm- 1 per GN/m2 for the 
930 cm- 1 band of PA 6 and of 3.6-6 cm- 1 per GN/m2 for the 974 cm- 1 band 
of PETP. For the latter band depending on sample treatment Mocherla and Statton 
fmd stress sensitivity values of 12 to 20 cm- 1 per GN/m2 [40]. More recently Vet-
tegren et al. [16] have obtained a stress sensitivity value of 8 cm-1 per GN/m2 at 
1350 cm- 1 for polyacrylonitrile. 
In the tail region of the "stressed 975 cm- 1 band" of PP frequency shifts of 
up to 35 cm- 1 are discernible which correspond to molecular stresses up to 12 GN/m2. 
Although the significance and dynamics of "stressed-IR" investigations are not yet 
understood in detail a number of interesting observations have been made: 
-
the integrated area of a deformed band (975 cm- 1 PP) remained constant with 
a increasing from 0 to 700 MN/m2 [5] indicating that no new oscillators had 
been created under stress; 
-
the area fraction in that band related to overstressed segments increased with 
stress to 15% at a = 400 MN/m2 and 18% at 490 MN/m2 [12]; for the 1170 cm- 1 
band an area fraction of 6% is reported [16] together with 15% for PETP 
(976 em-I), and 7% for PA 6 (930 em-I), all at a stress of 500 MN/m2 ; 
-
it is interesting to note that the segment density l/q L for PP segments of 5 nm 
length amounts to 56· 1019 segments per cm3 of which 15% or 8.5' 1019 
segments/cm3 would be overstressed at a = 400 MN/m2 ; 
at a constant stress level this tail area is directly proportional to the content of 
non-crystalline material, i.e. the overloaded segments seem to be contained in 
the amorphous regions [5]; 
the tail regions of the deformed bands (930 cm- 1 PA 6; 970 cm- 1 PETP; 
975 cm- 1 PP) show fairly well defined limits at the lower frequency end corre-
sponding to fairly well defined limits of sustained molecular stress"'; these limits 
are determined [6, 15, 16] to be 11-13 GN/m2 in PP, 15-20 GN/m2 in PETP 
(lavsan),8 GN/m2 in PAN and 16 to 20 GN/m2 in PA 6; 
with some samples [12, 24, 25] these limits are already reached at moderate 
macroscopic stresses smaller than 50% of sample strength; in other samples the 
limits are only attained at a stress level close to the breaking stresses [16];

Figure 8.4 reproduces the results ofVettegren et al. [16] on the maximum stresses 
on molecular segments for three morphologically different samples each ofPP 
and PETP; the - non-specified - morphological differences do not seem to effect 
the limiting stress value; in samples a) the largest molecular stress concentration 
(l/Imla) is larger than in b) or c) but in all three samples it is apparently extremely 
homogeneous as indicated by the fact that the maximum value of l/I m is only 
reached at the maximum of a; this behavior ties in with the observation [5] that 
the deformation of a band (975 cm- 1 PP) of a highly drawn sample (A. = 10) is 
much less than that of a sample drawn to A = 5; 
the observed molecular stress limit is also a function of temperature; in PETP 
Zhurkov et al. [6] determined a decrease from 22 GN/m2 at 100 K to 15 GN/m2 
at 400 K (on the basis that the observed molecular stress limits correspond to the 
chain strengths l/Ib and using wo/kb = 48· 1012 S-l as for PA 6 segments one 
derives an activation volume of 11.7· 10-6 m3/mol and an activation energy 
Do = 316 kllmol for the PETP segments); from later experiments Vettegren 
et al. [16] obtained activation volums of 13.2 . 10-6 m3/mol for PETP, 
15.0· 10-6 m3/mol for PA 6 and 15.6 .10-6 m3/mol for PP; 
the dichroism of a band permits the determination of the average degree of orien-
tation (cos2 0) ofloaded chain segments; Zhurkov et al. [5] found for a PETP 
with cos2 0 = 0.75 that the most highly stressed segments approached cos2 0 = 
= 1, i.e. complete uniaxial orientation (Fig. 8.5); 
the distribution of molecular stresses in PP varies during deformation (creep) 
and stress relaxation as indicated by the different time dependent intensity 
changes of fixed frequencies in the deformed part of the spectrum (dynamic 
polarized IR studies [6, 35])

I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
creep deformation tends to increase the highly loaded chain area of the 975 cm- 1 
band in PP at the expense of intermediately stressed segments [6, 35] further 
supporting the hypothesis that the band deformation is indeed due to a shift of 
frequencies and not to a creation of new oscillators 
. 
stress relaxation after shock loading of highly oriented PP showed an initial 10 
to 70 s period of fast decay at practically constant degree of crystal orientation 
[35] as evidenced by the absorption of the 899 cm -1 band which is a highly 
dichroic, crystalline or "helix" band [43]; at later times a "steady state" relaxa-
tion takes place which is accompanied by a decrease of absorption of the 
899 cm -1 band indicating a decrease of crystallinity or of helical regularity 
[35]; 
in shock loading PP (e.g. up to a strain of 10.5% in less than 0.1 s) the largest 
absorption at 955 cm -1 is observed after t = 69 s when considerable stress re-
laxation has occurred whereas in ramp loading at a rate of lO%/min the largest 
absorption is attained at the maximum of stress at 10.5% strain; the largest 
increase in intensity at 955 cm- 1 is (3.2 times) larger in shock loading than in 
ramp loading [38]; the molecular stress transfer in this highly oriented PP, there-
fore, is a viscoelastic process involving the deformation of the amorphous regions 
and the resistance to uncoiling of helices; Wool [39] has carried out a detailed 
experimental and computational analysis of stress relaxation, dynamic IR be-
havior and bond rupture; he concluded that different stress sensitivity values 
for crystalline regions (2.1 cm- 1 per GN/m2 ) and individual chains (8 cm- 1 
per GN/cm2 ) should be employed, that the most highly stressed chains 
(952 cm- 1 ) relax first thus contributing to the increase in intensity at higher 
frequencies (e.g. 955 and 960 cm- 1), and that bond scission will be negligible 
if its activation energy Uo is equal to or larger than 121 kllmol (29 kcal/mol); 
with Uo = 105 kllmol very little chain scission occurs (affecting IR tail inten-· 
sities by less than 0.3%), with 84 kllmol the majority and with Uo = 63 kllmol 
(15 kcal/mol) all of the overloaded chains are expected to break; in his PP 
material chain scission did not seem to contribute measurably to the relaxation 
phenomena, this argument was backed by the observation that the absorption 
bands characteristic for chain-end groups remained constant within 0.5% [39]; 
on the other hand in the PP material of Vettegren et al. [16] stress relaxation 
at 100°C was accompanied by the measurable appearance of chain-end groups. 
The dynamic IR behavior of PETP has recently been investigated by Mocherla 
et al. [40]. Apart from the already discussed stress effects the authors observed the 
existence of an initial region of small stresses (up to 70 MN/m2) within which stress 
effects (on the 973 cm- 1 band of PETP) were absent. They concluded from ex-
tended studies of differently heat-treated films that this initial region coincides 
with the range of elastic response of the sample; obviously small elastic stresses are 
predominantly transmitted by secondary forces not giving rise to axial distortion 
of the chains. 
Summarizing the above results from this important new method one may say 
that amorphous chain segments exist in appreciable numbers which carry up to about 
twenty times the average stress. There are upper limits of molecular stress which in 
the case of polyamide 6 seem to be given by the chain strength (21 GN/m2 ). With 
181 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
polypropylene the upper limit of molecular stresses in the highly, uniaxially oriented 
material of Wool is due to the inception of a distortion of helical chain conforma-
tions and of crystal lamellae. No bond breakages could be traced. 
In loading their oriented PP films Zhurkov, Vettegren et al. [6-16] observed, 
however, that an initially present concentration of 1-10 . 1018 carbonyl groups 
per cm3 increased [24]. They found this increase and the formation of other end 
groups (see below) related to the decrease of the number of overloaded chains [16]. 
The Russian authors concluded from the equality of the activation energies of ther-
mal and mechanical destruction of their PP films (29 kcal/mol) with that of end-
group accumulation (30 kcal/mol) that the kinetics of all three processes is con-
trolled by the same molecular process, the thermomechanical scission of chain seg-
ments. According to the calculations of Wool, chain scission should practically never 
occur in PP if Vo is equal to 29 kcal/mol. Those calculations, however, most prob-
ably refer to a constant temperature in the network of loaded and overloaded 
chains. Consideration of the large strain energy release at chain breakage would lead 
to the adjustment that local temperatures T are higher than the ambient temperature 
To and that the effective chain strengths, lh(T), are smaller than lJib(To). It seems 
likely, therefore, that the phenomenological observations do not contradict each 
other especially taking into account possible structural differences of the PP samples 
of the laboratories. 
The upper limits of molecular stresses deduced for PETP(15-20 GN/m2) and 
PAN (8 GN/m2) were also related to chain breakage by the Russian authors [16]. 
With these materials, however, no comparable results on scission products (end groups, 
free radicals) have been reported. In these cases as with the PP material of Wool the 
upper stress limit seems to derive from the limited resistance of the crystal lamellae 
against distortion and break-up. 
The latter conclusion is supported by the investigations of Becht and Kausch 
[44-48] concerning the deformation of highly oriented semicrystalline fibers. In a 
regular sandwich structure critical axial forces can be exerted onto tie segments if, 
and only if, the crystal lamellae can withstand stresses up to the chain strength. Other-
wise crystal disintegration would precede chain scission. Using the spin probe tech-
nique, calorimetry and molecular weight measurements Becht [44-47] demon-
strated the strain effect on crystal integrity. He irradiated samples of highly oriented 
6 PA, 12 PA, PP, PETP, and PE by I-Mev electrons at liquid nitrogen temperature. 
Subsequently, all samples were heated to their glass-transition-temperature (or 
above) for at least 5 minutes; thus, all radicals in the amorphous phase disap-
peared, and radicals remained within the crystallites only. These samples were then 
strained within the cavity of an ESR spectrometer at room temperature. 
The rate-determining steps of the radical-decay reactions in these cases are trans-
fer reactions and oxygen diffusion. They are both very strongly correlated with the 
mobility of the radical-carrying molecular segments with respect to their surroundings, 
Le., the crystal lattice. An increase in these rate constants, therefore, is a measure of 
an increase in mobility, which may be due to a decrease in intermolecular attraction 
and/or to the introduction of new crystal defects. 
In Figure 8.6, the concentration of free radicals is plotted versus a reduced time 
KoAt, where Ko is the rate of radical decay a t zero strain and At is the time elapsed

from the inception of sample straining. It should be noted that in PE, PP, PETP, and 
12 PA, the application of sample strain has a twofold result: an immediate and ir-
reversible decrease of the (crystalline) radical population and a stress-dependent re-
versible increase in the rate of decay. In 6 PA neither of these two effects can be 
observed. It was concluded from this experiment that in strained 6 PA, the tie mole-
cules fail before axial chain stresses are reached which are sufficient to distort the 
crystal lamellae. In PE, PP, PETP, and 12 PA, however, forces can be transmitted 
which clearly affect the crystal lamellae. It is logical to assume that these forces are 
primarily transmitted by the tie segments. One would have to conclude that the 
axial load bearing capability of microfibrils of PE, PP, PETP and 12 PAis limited 
through the beginning crystal distortion. Thus chain strengths are not fully utilized 
in these polymers. 
Still another combination of chain and crystal properties seems to exist in the 
PE films used by Vettegren et al. [15-18] for their end-group studies. Under stress 
vinyl, methyl, and oxygen-containing end groups formed readily and in large con-
centrations while no stress effects on IR bands were reported. 
C. Spatially Homogeneously Distributed Chain Scissions 
The scission of molecular chains generally leads to highly reactive chain end 
radicals and eventually to the formation of new end groups (cf. Chapters 6 and 7). 
Unless oxygen is excluded the following end groups are formed most frequently: 
methyl, aldehyde, ester, carbonyl, carboxyl, or vinyl groups. All of these groups 
have characteristic IR absorption bands (Table 8.1). Based on this consideration Zhur-
kov and his collaborators quantitatively investigated the build-up of new end groups 
in loaded polymer films [16-18, 22-26]. They employed a double beam technique 
the principle of which is illustrated in Figure 8.7. The optical densities D = Qn 10/1 of 
a stressed (a) and an unstressed reference film (r) are compared:

Here k is the absorption coefficient, d the thickness of the film, and C the con-
centration of end-groups. Figure 8.8 shows such a difference spectrum recorded by

The spectra have been evaluated with respect to the kinetics of end-group accumula-
tion and to the absolute number of chain scission events. The results will be reported 
although it seems as if a full understanding has not yet been obtained in terms of 
sample morphology, molecular weight changes and ESR results. So far only three 
polymer samples (PE-LO, PE-HO and PP investigated in the Joffe-Institute) have 
yielded end-group concentrations sufficient for detection. Thus the initial remarks 
concerning comparison and transfer of results apply here.

Subjecting uniaxially oriented films to uniaxial loads Zhurkov et al. [16-18, 
22-26] measured by such a technique the accumulation of aldehyde groups in high 
pressure and low pressure polyethylene and in polypropylene after predetermined 
loading intervals. Typical results are reproduced in Figure 8.9. The concentration 
C(t) of aldehyde-end groups increased with loading time according to a first-order 
kinetic equation: 
C(t) = C* (l-exp-Kt) 
(8.5) 
with rate constant K and apparent concentration C* of mechanically excitable -
and thus breakable - bonds. The authors found that the concentration C* depended 
only slightly on temperature and stress (changes from 1 to 4 . 10 19 cm -3 for stres-
ses between 180 and 500 MN/m2 at temperatures between -70°C and +20 DC) 
whereas the rate "constants" K varied by several orders of magnitude (Fig. 8.10). 
The authors noted that the rate constant K for accumulation of end groups was 
governed by an effective, stress-dependent activation energy E* which is plotted in 
Figure 8.11. Using the apparent linear relation between E* and a one obtains:

For polypropylene they derived concentrations of 6· 1019 cm- 3 broken bonds in 
the surface layer - as compared to 0.25 - 0.40· 1019 cm-3 reported by Zhurkov 
et al. [17, 18] for the interior of the film. The latter value should be compared with 
the number of overloaded 5 nm segments. In Section I B a concentration of 
8.5 . 1019 cm- 3 overloaded segments had been determined from the area of the 
tail region of the "stressed IR band". Such a comparison indicates that of 
No = 56· 1019 cm- 3 segments present in the interior material of the PP film 0.15 No 
are initially overloaded and 0.0045 No will have been broken at the point of mac-
roscopic fracture. In another study on PP [25] a concentration of broken bonds 
of 3· 1019 cm- 3 is reported, i.e. a fraction of 35% of the overloaded bonds is broken 
throughout the total volume of the sample. In the latter case wholesale destruction 
of the polymer must have occurred since on the average each molecule in a (mono-
disperse) Mn = 50000 g/mol sample would have been broken 2.5 times. In the for-
mer case the effect is ten times smaller, but Mn is still reduced to 40000 g/mol and 
Mw to 43750 g/mol. The effect is even more drastic with higher initial molecular 
weights. The fracture criterion derived at the Leningrad Institute for the three poly-

mer fIlms on the basis of the kinetics of thermal and mechanical destruction and of 
end-group formation is that of a critical concentration of newly broken chains 
[16-18]. 
In view of the fact that so far the end-group analysis has only been successful 
with these three polymer fl1ms one would welcome further studies on the extent to 
which the end-group formation depends on the initial concentration of carbonyl 
groups - or of other oxygen-containing groups. More extensive molecular weight 
measurements, especially by fractionating methods would also be useful to corro-
borate the absolute concentrations of end groups [220]. 
If the number of breaking chain segments is as large as indicated by the end-
group analysis and if each segment breaks at the limiting stress value derived from 
the analysis ofdeformed-IR bands then the accumulated molecular stresses would 
be comparable within an order of magnitude to the applied macroscopic stress. 
In that case it must be assumed that apart from conformational rearrangements and 
chain slippage chain scission events noticeably influence observed stress-strain curves. 
So far the PP material from Leningrad is the only polymer which has lent itself suc-
cessfully to both of the above mentioned IR analysis. In the cited literature [4-33] 
there is no reference to an attempt to explain stress-strain or stress-time data of this 
PP material on the basis of its end group-formation kinetics. 
As discussed frequently within this text stress-relaxation data can not and must 
not be related solely to chain scission [2-52]. Attempts have been forwarded, how-
ever, to explain the stress-strain curves of polyamide-6 [49-51] and PEOB fibers 
[ 5 2] on the basis of free radical production kinetics. In these models the concept 
was employed that tie segments show a distribution of relative lengths. The (taut-
ness) distribution, N(L/Lo), was assumed to remain unchanged in a wide time-tem-
perature regime. As detailed in Chapter 5, a tie-chain segment will respond to a strain 
€a predominantly rubber-elastically if €a < (L-Lo)/Lo, it will break if €a > (1 + 1/Ib/ 
Ek)L/Lo - 1, and it will respond energy-elastically in the intermediate region where 
it happens to be fully extended and sub critically loaded. From these considerations 
a homogeneous four-phase model can be derived (Fig. 8.13). It is based on the assump-

I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture or Highly Oriented Polymers 
tion that a highly oriented semi-crystalline fiber can be represented by crystalline 
and amorphous regions in series with the latter consisting of three fractions, i.e. of 
the fully extended segments, of the non-extended tie-chains, and of the remaining 
matrix (folds, ciliae, broken chains). Once the strain-dependent widths of the frac-
tions are obtained from a relative segment length distribution and appropriate moduli 
are assigned to the individual phases a stress-strain curve can be constructed. Such a 
procedure was proposed in 1971 by DeVries and Williams [49]. It has been executed 
by Lloyd [50] and by Klinkenberg [51] for PA 6 fibers and by Nagamura et al. [52] 
for PEOB multi-filaments. The calculated stress-strain curves can be made to fit the 
stress-strain response of virgin material; they contain as possible sources of uncer-
tainty the choice of the "elastic" moduli and of the number and distribution of tie-
segment lengths, i.e. of N (L/Lo). The choice of the form of N (L/Lo) determines 
which number of segment lengths is assigned to the fraction of non-extended chain 
segments by way of extrapolation. Lloyd [50] and Nagamura et al. [52] have chosen 
a normal distribution to represent N(L/Lo). 
A fit of observed and calculated stress-strain curves of first and second stretching 
cycles was obtained if the calculated number of radicals formed (or of chains broken) 
was taken as considerably larger than the observed number. Nagamura et al. [52] 
report a factor fc of 40 for PEOB fibers, Klinkenberg [51] of 20 for PA 6 fibers. 
If one wishes to explain such a discrepancy while maintaining the basic model 
one is forced to make additional assumptions: 
-
either the number of broken chains is systematically larger by fc than the number 
of observed radicals, e.g. due to a Zakrewskii-mechanism [20] to be discussed 
later; 
or the breakage of N 1 chains in a particular volume element leads to the preferen-
tial unloading of fc N 1 extended chains; this amounts to the consideration of a 
microfibrillar substructure; 
in any event provision must be made to account for the anelastic deformation 
of the non-extended chains; the stress-induced change of the conformation of a 
tie-segment profoundly reduces the axial chain stress while not effecting N(L/Lo) 
(cf. Chapter 5 IB and III); in subjecting a fiber to several stress-strain cycles a 
large fraction of the more extended relaxed, conformations formed during the 
first cycle are present at the beginning of the second cycle; these stress-induced, 
temporarily stable conformational changes are considered to be mostly responsible 
for the differences between first and second loading cycles [2]. 
It is the common observation of the above authors [49-52] that qualitatively 
the slopes of stress-strain and of radical concentration-strain curves correspond. For 
a quantitative correspondance one would have to assume that 20 to 40 times as many 
chains break as free radicals are observed. Such an assumption appears to be rather 
large in view of the facts that no correspondingly strong decrease of the molecular 
weight has been reported and that the load bearing capability of the fiber material 
outside of the immediate fracture zone does not necessarily suffer. Prevorsek [53] 
showed that the strengths of fiber segments subjected repeatedly to breaking loads did 
not decrease. The rupture segments obtained in a first loading exhibited a larger 
strength than the original fiber and maintained this strength in subsequent loadings 
(Fig. 8.14). It seems more likely, therefore, that the concentration of chain scission

events is of the order indicated by the ESR investigations, i.e. 1016 to 5· 1017 cm- 3 . 
Such concentrations in themselves do not weaken the polymer network decisively since 
they amount to the breakage of only 0.002 to 0.10% of all amorphous chain seg-
ments [2]. Unless the qualitative agreement between the slopes of stress-strain and 
free radical-strain curves is coincidental it can be sought in an amplification effect 
accompanying the rapid release of stored elastic energy. The ensuing local temperature 
rise will facilitate the extension of kinked chains under annihilation of kinks which 
is practically equivalent to unloading those chains without breaking them (cf. Chap-
ter 5). Within the framework of this model one would have to conclude that the 
breakage of one amorphous segment at maximum load ql/lb leads to conformational 
changes in the surrounding segments of the same microfibrillar region resulting in 
local load decreases of 40 q I/Ib' In view of the fact that on the average there are 
more than 2000 surrounding segments (of 5 nm length in any amorphous region 
400 nm2 in cross-section) the value of 40 q I/Ib appears very reasonable. 
One word of caution must be said with respect to the extrapolation of the seg-
ment length distribution N(L/Lo) into the unknown regions of L/Lo. For this pur-
pose DeVries et al. [49, 50] and Nagamura et al. [51] used the assumption that the 
"visible" part of the segment length distribution (Fig. 7.16) constitutes the skewed 
part of a normal distribution. A plot of the skewed distribution on probability 
coordinates (Fig. 7.17) apparently does not disprove the contention made. They had 
derived the parameters of the normal distribution (mean, variance) using the existence 
and location of an inflection point in the - always only partially known - cumula-
tive distribution. It cannot be excluded that such inflection points result from the 
increased unloading of microfibril ends at larger strains since the stress-transfer length 
Le of a micro-fibril (with modulus Ef , diameter d) increases in case of perfect inter-
fibrillar adhesion (of strength 7) with Le = Ef df €/27. The eventual error of an extra-
polation of N (L/Lo) into the range of not fully - or even slightly - loaded segments 
is of not too much importance in calculating accumulated molecular stresses. It is 
of importance, however, if the distribution N(L/Lo) is used to derive a fracture 
190 

I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
criterion. A fracture criterion in which macroscopic failure coincides with breakage 
of the last tie segment of the total distribution must be ruled out. Against such a 
fracture criterion the above mentioned argument holds that at the point of macro-
scopic failure 99.7% of all tie-segments are still unbroken (Fig. 7.6). 
Although DeVries, Lloyd, and Williams [49, 50] work with a normal distribu-
tion of relative chain lengths they do not put it to a full and questionable use. Their 
assumptions may be reformulated on the basis of the above considerations. It is 
assumed 1. that the segment length distribution N(L/Lo) - derived from spatially 
homogeneous chain scission events of virgin material - be representative for the 
homogeneity of molecular stress distribution in any average amorphous region of 
the fiber, 2. that an initially narrow distribution continues to rise sharply with seg-
ment length and 3. that the complete break-down of tie segments within micro-
fibrillar amorphous regions be restricted to a comparatively small fracture zone 
which does not contribute measurably to the free radical population. They use the 
widths of their chain length distributions N(L/Lo) and correlate it with macroscopic 
strength (Fig. 8.15). In other words they correlate the non-homogeneity of the 
molecular stress distribution with macroscopic strength - and find a negative cor-
relation.

It has been stated frequently in this work that the tie segments which eventually 
break are not the main source of strength of highly oriented fibers. The total number 
of radicals formed at macroscopic fracture does not measure, therefore, the strength 
of the sample. The wide differences in radical concentrations N(R) at break of com-
parably strong fibers (cf. Table 6.2) illustrate this statement. Again these concentra-
tions should be taken only as an indication of the homogeneity of stress distribution 
between different rnicrofibrils and of stress response within different micro fibrils. 
The later a possible defect zone starts its accelerated growth the longer the phase of 
spatially homogeneously distributed chain scission and the larger the number of 
191 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
chains which are loaded up to breakage. If one compares, under this aspect, members 
from one family of samples strength-related conclusions seem to be justified. 
In Chapter 7 the morphological changes in PA 6 fibers due to annealing and 
their effect on chain scission have been discussed. In Figure 7.18 and 7.19 it had 
been indicated that slack annealing is accompanied by a relative lengthening of tie-
segments and to a widening of the length distribution. The indicated losses of homo-
geneity lead to accelerated flaw growth already at stresses lower than those exerted 
on the control sample, i.e. to a loss of strength (Fig. 7.20, "slack"). Annealing at 
fixed fiber ends leads to a certain loss in homogeneity while maintaining the average 
relative segment length. The loss in strength (Fig. 7.21) and in the number N of radicals 
at break (Fig. 7.20) as compared to the control sample is small. This result confIrms 
the findings of Levin et al. [21] with highly oriented tensile Kapron annealed at 200 0 C. 
Annealing under all. 7% prestrain increases the relative segment length (Figs. 7.18 
and 7.19), segment homogeneity (Fig. 7.22), and sample strength (Fig. 7.21). 
The opposing effects of increasing annealing temperature and increasing tensile 
prestrain on segment homogeneity are clearly indicated on Figure 7.22. The concen-
tration Nit of radicals at break formed after annealing initially increases with pre-

strain (Fig. 8.16), showing a maximum at a 5% prestrain. At that strain radical forma-
tion in prestraining (Np) starts. The total number of radicals (Np + NR) is approxi-
mately constant in that region. The sample strength increases by 20% up to a maxi-
mum at 7.5% prestrain and decreases slightly thereafter (Fig. 8.16). 
D. Formation of Microcracks 
All of the foregoing considerations have been concerned with a distribution of chain 
scission events homogeneous on a macroscopic scale. The accelerating effects of 
stress concentrations at microstructural inhomogeneities and of mutual interaction 
of scission points have so far been neglected. Such effects were not apparent in the 
discussed IR and ESR investigations of chain rupture; in any event they did not 
prevent tremendous concentrations of scission points being accumulated before 
final fracture. This fact can certainly be taken as an indication that during a con-
siderable period of straining, chain scission points remain isolated "defects" and 
do not give rise to unstable cracks. 
On the other hand the appearance of submicrocracks in loaded polymers has 
been known for many years since the Leningrad school [17, 18, 27, 28] employed 
X-ray scattering techniques to search for it. Such submicrocracks were found in PE, 
PP, PVC, PVB, PMMA, and PA 6. The authors noted two important regularities of 
the sub micro crack formation [28). First of all, the submicroscopic cracks appear at 
finite sizes with their transverse dimensions practically independent of load duration, 
stress value, and temperature (Table 8.3). Secondly the transverse size of the sub-
microcracks is determined by the polymer structure. For oriented crystalline poly-
mers the transverse size coincides with the microfibril diameter; for non-oriented, 
amorphous polymers having a globular structure it coincides with the diameter of 
the globules [28]. 
Two explanations have been given for the formation of these submicrocracks: 
Zakrewskii [20] proposes a radical chain reaction and Peterlin [58] suggests that the 
ends of micro fibrils are the crack nuclei.

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
The Zakrewskii-mechanism was proposed by the Russian school following their 
studies of the formation of free radicals and of end-groups. They had noted that 
the concentration of free radicals was either by a factor of 4000 (PE-HD) smaller 
than the concentration of newly formed end-groups or even unmeasurably small 
(PP). This led them to search for a reaction by which chains might break without 
increasing the concentration of free radicals. 
The mechanism of the proposed mechano-chemical reaction chain is illustrated 
in Figure 8.17. The thermo-mechanical scission of a regular covalent bond (a) leads 
to the formation of two chain-end radicals (b). As amply discussed in Chapter 6 the 
latter radicals are highly reactive. They will transform by hydrogen abstraction into 
stable end groups at the same time creating main-chain radicals within neighboring 
chains (c). It is then assumed by Zakrevskii and Zhurkov [17, 20] that the decreased 
energy of activation for the thermal scission reaction of radicalized chains (cf. Chap-
ter 4) also leads to a lower tensile strength of these chains causing them to rupture 
(d). Repetition of the steps c and d would not increase the number of free radicals 
present but would mUltiply the number of chains broken. In Figure 8.18 the energy 
levels of the proposed steps of the reaction chain are indicated. It should be noted, 
however, that the lowering of the activation energy for scission of a radicalized 
chain is effective only where thermal eqUilibrium can be established (cf. Chapter 
4 II B).

of the steps (c) and (d); III chain-end radical e.g. -CH2-CH2, x main-chain radical e.g. 
-CH2-CH-CH2-, • stable end groups e.g. -CH2-CH3. 
The authors suggest [17,18] that the 3300 new end groups formed per sub-
micro crack in PE-HD (5000 in PP) are created by such a mechanism. Their data in-
dicate also that there is less than a single pair of free radicals available per submicro-
crack (0.4 in HDPE, 0.3 in PA 6 and an immeasurable small fraction in PP). These 
discrepancies, the unfavorable conditions for thermal equilibrium in the splitting 
reaction, and the absence of a well defined termination of the reaction chain raise 
considerable concern. They make it difficult to believe that such a reaction is the 
major reason for the formation of submicrocracks which remain fairly stable during 
extended and repeated loading periods [220]. 
Peterlin [58] has based his proposal on the origin of sub microcracks on mor-
phological considerations and analysis of the previously mentioned X-ray data

[17 -21,27]. He suggests that the ends of microfibrils, preferentially situated on the 
outer surface of the fibrils, retract under stress (Fig. 8.l9). In low strength PA 6 they 
thus open up about 1016 oblate spheroids per cm3 having 6 nm diameter in fiber 
axis direction and 10 nm in the perpendicular direction. He estimates that the num-
ber and size of cracks in high strength polyamide is considerably smaller and is in 
agreement with the much higher draw ratio employed in producing those fibers. 
For highly oriented films with microfibrillar substructure similar considerations on 
the origin of the voids hold.

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
Considering the two important regularities of submicrocrack formation [28], 
the inconsistencies of the Zakrewskii-mechanism [17], and the morphological as-
pects [58] the retraction of microfibril ends seems to be a logical interpretation of 
the opening-up of fixed-geometry voids. This means at the same time that the sub-
micro crack formation is a process inherently independent of chain scission or end-
group formation [220]. The voids constitute structural irregularities and contribute as 
such toward the general non-homogeneity of the distribution of stresses or strains. 
Their direct influence as potential stress concentrators is weak and ineffective with 
regard to accelerating chain scission. This conclusion is based on the following facts: 
microfibril ends are free to undergo shear deformation and are free from axial 
stresses, 
obviously the voids do not prevent the build-up of large elastic strains in the fibers 
or films - as evidenced by the scissioning of chains and the appearance of de-
formed-IR bands, 
if chain scission would occur preferably adjacent to microfibril ends further lateral 
widening of the there existing microcracks would then invariably accelerate chain 
scission. 
E. Energy Release in Chain Scission 
A molecular chain segment stressed almost to its load-bearing capacity constitutes 
an extremely powerful source of elastically stored energy. In thermo-mechanically 
activated bond scission only a minor fraction of this stored energy is needed to break 
the chemical bond, namely the mechanical contribution {31/ib to the activation energy 
Uo. The remaining, major part of the energy is available for mechanical interaction 
with surrounding chains or is diSSipated as heat. The diSSipated heat has a twofold 
effect through the ensuing local temperature rise: it increases the mobility of other 
chain segments and decreases their rupture strength 1/ib (T). Both effects tend to 
facilitate the further degradation of the stressed polymer. 
The total elastic energy stored in a segment of elastic modulus Eb length L, 
and cross-section q amounts to 
(8.7) 
For a polyamide 6 segment of5 nmlength with q = 0.189 nm2, 1/ib = 21 GN/m 2 
and Ek = 200 GN/m2 one obtains a value of 1 .10- 18 J per segment or 600 kJ/mol 
for the elastically stored energy. To break a C-C bond at room temperature a me-
chanical energy of 110 kJ Imol is needed (cf. Chapter 7 I C l). In setting up an energy 
balance the contribution of the elastic forces must not be forgotten which hold the 
highly stressed tie-segment ends within the crystal lamellae. At the rupture stress this 
energy amounts to about 190 kJ/mol for each segment end (cf. Table 5.5). One thus 
arrives at an energy of 870 kJ/mol which is liberated at the moment of chain scission. 
If this energy were to be confined within the volume of the segment and of its ends 
(Ltotal ~ 10 nm) it would constitute an energy density of Wtotadqtotal = 764 MJ/m 3 . 
196 

I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
Chain scission events, therefore, have been justly termed micro-explosion by Zhurkov 
and his colleagues. 
On the other hand at a (large) concentration of (0.6 . 10+ 24) bond ruptures per 
m3 (Le. of 0.83 mOl/m3 ) the total energy having been stored in the retracting chain 
ends amounts to an average of 722 kJ per m3 which will be dissipated as heat Qb. 
The chemical energy Vb of this number of broken bonds amounts to 156 kJ /m3 . 
These average energy values should also be compared against the density of elastically 
stored energy, i.e. against a2 /2 E. This term reaches about 125 MJ /m3 for very high 
strength PA 6 fibers, which in tum is only one sixth of the cohesive energy density 
of that material. The energy dissipation due to ruptured bonds is slightly smaller, 
therefore, than the pure hysteresis losses encountered in loading and unloading a 
polyamide fiber (for PA-6 at 10 to 30 Hz tan 8 is of the order of 5.10-3 ). 
The important problem of how the external work W done on a polymer sample 
during a loading-unloading cycle serves to increase the internal energy V, to change 
the entropy S, or to be irreversibly dissipated as heat Qir = TdiS was attacked by 
MUller in 1956 in his classical experiments [59-62]. According to Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3 
one can write 
dW= dV - TdS - Qir. 
(8.8) 
Miiller and his co-workers measured several deformation-related thermodynamic 
quantities: the reversible and irreversible parts of heat production during the plastic 
deformation ofPE, PVC, PETP, PA 6 [59-61], PC [63], PS [64], and of various 
elastomers [61, 65, 66], the ensuing temperature rises [67], the change of internal 
energy with the time of storage [68] and its effect on the energy of dissolution [69]. 
They noted that the entropy of thermoplastics during cold flow is decreased and 
that the internal energy is increased. They also measured the balance of energy in 
stressing (s) and during retraction (r) of PIB in a sequence of stretching cycles. The 
change of internal energy in an i th cycle can be written as: 
(8.9) 
of which the entropy terms are equal by definition. The authors observed that 8 Vi 
was different from zero only in the first cycle. The increase of internal energy during 
extension of elastomers and thermoplastics was ascribed by them to a reduction of 
close range order and to chain scission and formation of radicals as further sinks of 
external energy. 
The latter hypothesis was further tested by Godovskii et al. [31]. PA-6 fibers 
drawn to A = 5.5 at 210°C were repeatedly stretched at room-temperature. The 
authors found for PA 6 the same characteristic difference between the first and the 
following loading cycles as did MUller for PIB: 8 V was essentially different from 
zero only in the first loading cycle. The ratio of 8 WI /8 VI was found, independent 
of the macroscopic stress, to amount to 7.0. This constancy of 8 WI /8 Viis in fact 
remarkable. It indicates that processes are responsible for the increase of internal 
energy which occur, independent of a, if locally a critical excitation is surpassed. 
Godovskii et al. assume that these processes are chain ruptures. They derive from 
197 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
8 U 1 the number N 1 of chain scission events each of which contributes an increment 
of internal energy of 1.7· 10-19 J (100 kJ/mol). The dissipated energy per chain 
scission event, 8 W 1 /N 1 , amounted to 700 kJ /mol. These figures are only slightly 
smaller than the values found above on the basis of elasticity considerations for the 
mechanical contribution to chain scission (110 kJ /mol) and for the energy dissipated 
by the retracting segments (870 kJ/mol). This striking coincidence does not prove, 
however, the above hypothesis that 8 U1 might be interpreted solely as an increase 
in chemical bond energy due to chain scission. 
Millier [62] and Kausch and Becht [55] have indicated that slip processes and 
conformational changes may respond energetically similar to bond ruptures if they 
are occurring as a consequence of stress induced distortion of the polymer network 
or as a result of local heating. The increase in internal energy is then related to a 
decrease of close range order or the decrease of the number of hydrogen bonds or 
to internal stresses between chains and within crystallites. The existence of inter-
molecular forces of considerable magnitude in oriented polymers can be inferred 
from a number of optical, spectroscopical and mechanical experiments. Particularly 
noteworthy are the following observations. Vettegren et al. [70] noted that in per-
fectly annealed PETP film the maximum of the characteristic backbone vibration 
band lies at 975 cm- 1 , whereas in oriented PETP film it lies at 972 cm- 1 . Lunn and 
Yannas [71] found that the asymmetric stretch vibration band of methyl groups 
with a maximum at 2971 cm- 1 in isotropic PC film splits into two components 
1 cm- 1 apart in a PC film drawn to about 85%. They assigned this frequency shift 
to the action of intermolecular rather than intramolecular forces. With the drawn 
material they also studied chain-segment orientation by determining the dichroic 
ratio of the 1364 cm- 1 band. They obtained an interesting result that chain back-
bone motion (with an ensuing change of the degree of orientation) in drawn PC films 
was clearly observable more than 60 K below the glass transition temperature of 
149°C. The largest deviations from an equilibrium state (highest intermolecular 
tensions) existed in those films drawn at the lowest temperature (23 °C) were anneal-
ing at 81 ° C resulted in measurable changes of the orientation distribution. Millier 
[62] determined that in the cold drawing of non-oriented polymers the fraction 
8 U/8 W of internal energy rise to external work amounted to 0.2 (PE), 0.3 to 0.45 
(PA 6, PETP) and 0.3 to 0.5 (PVC). 
The question is still open, therefore, as to the extent the internal energy rise 
is due to the chemical energy of broken bonds or to the local rearrangements trig-
gered by chain scission. 
F. Fatigue Fracture of Fibers 
The preceeding Sections have dealt exclusively with the response of chains 
and micro fibrils to constant or monotonically increasing stress or strain. In service, 
however, fibers are frequently subjected to intermittent, alternating, or cyclic loads. 
The behavior of fibers, therefore, to repetitive cyclic loading has been studied for 
many years (e.g. 72-82). Following an extensive review of Hearle et al. [76] it can 
be said that in cumulative extension cycling a fiber fails by virtue of having reached 
198 

I. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
its breaking extension. Under such a condition of constantly increasing maximum 
extension, fatigue can be predicted from an adequate knowledge of the anelastic 
deformation and the time-dependent breakage conditions of the fiber. As yet no 
specific fatigue effects have been identified in cumulative extension cycling [76]. 
In one of the earliest reports on fatigue of fibers and fabrics Busse et al. [72] 
pointed out that the vibration life of nylon, cotton, and rayon cords is inversely 
proportional to the rate of thermally activated flow steps. 
A similar conclusion has been drawn by Regel et al. [74] and Tamush [75] for 
cyclic stressing. These authors assume the validity of the principle of damage ac-
cumulation ("Miner's rule"), i.e. of 
21TNF/W 
f dt / T(a[t]) = 1 
o 
(8.10) 
with NF the number of cycles to failure and w the loading frequency. If T, the expec-
tation value of the time-to-break under constant stress, is taken to be the common 
Arrhenius expression one obtains 
21TNF/W 
f dt / TO exp [(Uo - 'Y a [t])/RT] = 1. 
o 
(8.11 ) 
Regel et al. [74] report that such a damage accumulation law did apply to PAN 
fibers loaded at 24 Hz up to 1.5 . 107 cycles. For PMM films, viscose fibers, and 
capron fibers (PA 6) correspondance of experimental data with Eq. (8.11) could be 
obtained through air cooling of the fatigued samples, after preliminary drawing, or 
at elevated temperatures. The authors concluded that Eq. (8.11) would describe 
fatigue fracture within the kinetic concept of fracture if (ambient) temperature T 
and activation volume 'Y would be replaced by values T* and 'Y* which would depend 
on the parameters of the fatigue experiment (frequency, form of stress or strain pulse) 
The fatigue failure of fibers has also been extensively investigated by Prevorsek, 
Lyons, and co-workers. Their many pertinent papers are referenced in [78]. The 
authors interpret the fatigue life as the time to void nucleation by rearrangement of 
molecular segments. They arrive at a kinetic equation relating the number of cycles 
to failure with various mechanical and molecular parameters [78]. 
Employing a load-controlled fatigue tester Bunsell and Hearle [77] have more 
recently found a distinctive fatigue fracture morphology in polyamide 66 fibers. A 
necessary requisite for this fatigue mechanism to operate was the cycling of loads 
down to zero stress values. Under such conditions fibers failed at a maximum load 
only 60 to 70% of the normal breaking load [77, 79]. This observation will be further 
discussed in the following section (8 I G). 
DeVries et al. [49] studied the formation of free radicals under cyclic tensile 
loading. The radical accumulation curves reflected the stress cycles. The authors 
explained the kinetics of radical accumulation on the basis of Eq. (7.2), i.e. with-
out assuming a special fatigue mechanism. 
Summarizing the above observations one has to conclude that no distinctive 
fatigue mechanism - other than hysteresis heating - is operating when highly ori-
199 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
ented fibers are subjected to cyclic loads which remain always positive. Initiation 
and propagation of fatigue cracks will be favored, however, if chains and fibrils are 
given a chance to relax stresses, to degrade possible strain hardening effects, and to 
reorient. Thus the fatigue mechanism described by Bunsell and Hearle [77,79] mani-
fests itself as an increase in interfibrillar slip and crack growth almost parallel to the 
load direction. It will be further discussed in the following section. Characteristic 
fatigue mechanisms are also well observable in non-oriented polymers. They will be 
treated in Section II C of this and in the next chapter. 
G. Fractography 
The visual inspection and the study of broken samples by means of optical or scann-
ing electron microscopy (SEM) are important tools of fracture analysis. They ob-
viouslyaid 
-
in the detection of possible causes of crack initiation and 
-
in the interpretation of the fracture process. 
The appearance of a fracture surface undoubtedly is the most convincing evidence 
that the fracture process has reached the phase of non-homogeneous deformation. 
But rather frequently the surface and morphology of a failed specimen reveal whether 
or not a phase of homogeneous material deformation has contributed to the fracture 
event. It is in this sense that a paragraph on fractography has been introduced into 
the chapter on homogeneous deformation and fracture. Figures 7.8 and 7.9 serve 
to illustrate this point. These fracture surfaces are more or less an arbitrary result 
of a large number of homogeneously distributed scission and slip processes of chains 
and microfibrils. The fracture surface was developed within a very small fraction of 
the total lifetime and at a location not predictable in advance. 
Hendus and Penzel [83] investigated the fracture morphology of polyamide 6 
monomaments. The regularly spun and drawn monomaments were subsequently 
subjected to tensile tests at various strain rates. Characteristic fracture surfaces are 
reproduced in Figures 8.20 and 8.21 [84]. At small strain rates (e = 0.033 S-I) fre-
quently v-shaped notches are observed (Fig. 8.20). Such a notch is formed through 
a crack which initiates at a flaw or material inhomogeneity contained in the ma-
ment surface or in a zone close to the surface. While the crack grows slowly the re-
maining fiber cross-section continues to deform plasticly. At a point determined by 
the sizes of the crack and of the remaining cross-section and by the material pro-
perties rapid transverse crack propagation occurs. The measured strength of the mono-
mament is the higher the smaller the v-shaped notch [83]. Filaments of highest 
strength contained barely visible small voids. 
Figure 8.20 also shows an enlargement of the head of the monofilament. This 
enlargement corresponds to a shrinkage of the oriented material caused by the warm-
ing of the mament during the plastic deformation. If the rate of deformation is in-
creased to 50 S-1 then the heat generated through the plastic deformation of the 
remaining cross-section cannot be dissipated fast enough. Locally the melt tempe-
rature is exceeded, the mament heads expand almost to the diameter of the undrawn 
material (Fig. 8.21).

The fibrillar nature of drawn monofilaments becomes apparent in Figure 8.22. 
The filament ends of two different fracture events show a strong axial splitting. As 
concluded from the formation of small heads at the ends of some microfibrils the 
fibrillation must have occurred before the catastrophic fracture took place. Strong 
axial splitting is also known from polyamide 66, Kevlar [148], PETP, acrylic fibers, 
wool, human hair, and cotton fibers [85]. 
On the basis of fractographic studies Bunsell and Hearle [77, 79] indirectly 
identified a fatigue mechanism in polyamide 66. Oriented PA-66 fibers failed in a 
tensile type manner if they were fatigued uniaxially between an upper stress level 
equal to the long-time static strength and a lower level of clearly non-zero tensile 
stresses. These fatigue failures had a morphology similar to that shown in Figure 8.20. 
The breakage apparently did not involve any specific fatigue effect. If the loading 
conditions were changed, however, so as to include zero tensile or even compressive

stresses a specific fatigue fracture morphology became apparent. Those breaks, oc-
curring after 105 cycles, were characterized by the propagation of a crack, almost 
parallel to the direction of the fiber axis. As shown by Figure 8.23a [86] this leaves 
a long tail of material at one fiber end. Although this phenomenon is not yet com-
pletely understood it may be concluded from Bunsell's and Reade's observations 
[77, 79, 85] that compressive yielding and/or buckling of microfibrils or fibrils takes 
place on a microscopic scale. The repeated lateral rearrangement leads to a gradual 
loss of interfibrillar cohesion. A crack which has started at some flaw in a direction 
normal to the tensile stress a will turn, therefore, into a direction u almost parallel 
to a - the angle between u and a being a function of the lateral stress transfer 
which still remains.

1. Small-Strain Deformation and Fracture of Highly Oriented Polymers 
On the basis of his extensive investigations Hearle [85] has established a classi-
fication of the main features of fiber fracture morphologies: 
A. Transverse Elastic Crack Propagation 
This is the classic form of failure in elastic materials and consists of a relatively 
smooth "mirror zone" of crack propagation leading to a rougher zone of final 
failure due to multiple crack-initiation (comparable in morphology to Fig. 1.7). 
B. Ductile Transverse Crack Propagation 
This is a form of fracture in which a crack propagates stably across a fiber under 
increasing load and/or strain and is opened out into a V-notch by the continued 
plastic yielding (the final stages of the drawing process) of the remaining material; 
the crack leads into a region of final catastrophic failure, occurring when the stress 
in the remaining reduced cross-section reaches a critical level (Fig. 8.20). 
C. Transverse "Fibrous" Break 
This type of break runs perpendicularly across the fiber, with a rough texture 
and no evidence of any propagating cracks; the whole structure appears to be 
ready to fail at the same time, and the breaks are very similar in appearance to 
lower-magnification views of the fracture of fiber-reinforced composites (Fig. 7.8 
and 7.9). 
D. Axial Splitting under Tension 
In some fibers failure in axial tension occurs by cracking, or splitting, along planes 
close to the fiber axis. Due to a nonhomogeneous fibrillar substructure there will 
be shear stresses in these planes. With reduced interfibrillar cohesion a break is 
produced characterized by multiple axial splitting over a long length (equal to 
many fiber diameters) (Fig. 8.22). 
E. Splitting Due to Torsion 
Under shear stresses generated by torsion, splitting can occur along lines deter-
mined by the directions of stress and of material weakness. 
F. Axial-fatigue Cracks 
Particular localized cracks, deviating slightly from the fiber-axial direction, 
develop in many fibers as a result of tensile fatigue: they are associated with shear 
stresses at discontinuities. The resulting breaks show a long tail on one end, a strip 
off the other end, and a final catastrophic-failure region (Fig. 8.23). 
G. Fatigue-cracking along Kink-bands 
Kink-bands at angles of about 45° develop in many fibers in compression, for 
example, or on the inside of bends, and, in repeated flexing, these eventually turn 
into cracks and lead to fiber failure. 
H. Multiple Splitting in Fatigue 
In torsional- or flexural-fatigue situations, multiple splitting frequently occurs 
and can eventually lead to failure. 
For a more detailed discussion of fiber fracture morphology the reader is referred 
to the series of publications by Hearle, especially to "An Atlas of Fibre Fracture" 
[87]. The fracture morphology of non-oriented polymers under various loading con-
ditions will be treated, where appropriate, in subsequent sections of this and the final 
chapter.

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
A. Impact Loading 
Polymeric materials are viscoelastic solids. Their propensity to anelastic and plastic 
deformation is reduced when they are tested at high load rates and/or at low tem-
peratures. The reduced deformability causes a formerly tough or highly elastic poly-
mer to respond in a brittle manner. The impact fracture of natural rubber at liquid 
nitrogen temperature is convincing evidence of this fact. 
The resistance of polymeric materials to impact loading is of considerable tech-
nical importance as illustrated by the following examples: 
aircraft windows have to withstand impinging particles or rain 
protective coverings of high voltage switches must resist the impact of metal chips 
water pipes or plastic floor tiles should not be damaged if hit accidentally 
car bumpers or packaging materials must absorb as much of the energy of a col-
lision as possible 
-
household items are not expected to break the first time they fall to the ground 
gears should transmit even rapidly increasing forces 
-
safety belts should yield but not fracture. 
In view of the technical relevance the impact resistance of polymers has been 
intenSively investigated. The cited references [88-103] may serve as an introduction 
into the large body of literature. Vincent [88] and Bucknall et al. [89] give a general 
survey of the impact testing of polymers. Other references concern the molecular 
aspects [88-96], instrumentation [97-100], and particle impact [101-103]. The 
extensive literature on the fracture mechanical analysis of impact bending tests will 
be referenced in Chapter 9. 
The fact that the impact resistance depends strongly on the presence and shape 
of stress concentrators, on the sample geometry, and on the testing conditions has 
made it very difficult to define and measure a unique material property impact 
resistance. Since the impact behavior under one condition (e.g. impact bending) 
cannot very well be predicted from the behavior under different conditions (e.g. 
falling weight) quite a number of impact tests have been devised. The four best known 
ones are the three point bending (Charpy unnotched and notched), two point bend-
ing (Izod), tensile-impact, and falling-weight tests which have been standardized 
(DIN 53453, 53448,53373, 53443E; ASTM D 256, 1822,2444,3029). 
In the context of this chapter-only the three-point bending test (Charpy) will be 
discussed. In this test the energy loss An is measured which a pendulum incurs in 
striking and breaking a prismatic specimen (of thickness D and width B). The ob-
served energy loss comprises basically four different terms: 
the energy We to bend the sample up to the point of crack initiation, 
the energy GcBD to propagate the crack through the specimen, 
the kinetic energy Wkin of the broken sample, and 
vibrational or otherwise dissipated energy. 
The simple excess energy measurement of the pendulum does not permit dis-
crimination between these different energy sinks. The separation of the first three 
terms becomes possible, however, if the bending force P acting between pendulum 
head and specimen is measured (so-called instrumented impact test). 
204 

II. Deformation, Creep, and l-atIgue ot Unonented Polymers 
For the elastic bending of a prismatic beam between supports at a distance Ls 
the following expressions for energy and strain are obtained. 
The total bending energy We, as a function of beam deflection D , is 
(8.12) 
the largest density of stored elastic energy in the tensile fiber: 
(8.13) 
and the largest strain can be expressed as 
(8.14) 
From this relation the strain rate Em at a pendulum velocity of 2.9 m/s (DIN 
51222, 0.5-4 J) is obtained as 65 S-I. The kinetic energy of a sample of a mass of 
1 g ejected by the striker at that speed of 2.9 m/s would amount to 4.2' 10-3 J. 
The ratio, an, of the fracture energy An to the sample cross-section B . D is 
termed impact strength (Schlagzahigkeit). Such a notation creates the allusion that 
an is a fracture surface specific material property. It has frequently been pointed out 
that this is not the case [88-89]. Neither We nor Wkin are proportional to the sample 
cross-section. A comparison of an values should only be made, therefore, if all values 
are obtained from one type of test, preferably even from specimens of identical geom-
etry. Impact strength values an of Charpy un-notched specimens (DIN 53453) at 
20°C range from 3.5-12 kJ/m2 for filled phenol melamine and urea resins, 
4-22 kJ/m2 for various filled epoxy and polyester resins, 12-20 kJ/m2 for PMMA, 
PS, and SAN, and 50-90 kJ/m2 for ethyl cellulose, CA, styrene-butadiene copoly-
mers, and POM. For many thermoplastics (ABS, CAB, PE, PP, PTFE, PC, PVC, PA) 
no fracture is observed under these test conditions [104]. 
The above impact strength values designate brittle behavior if an < 40 kJ/m2 . 
The materials with an between 50 to 90 kJ/m2 will generally the brittle if bluntly 
notched. Of those polymers not breaking in the Charpy un-notched test some will 
respond in a brittle manner if they are sharply notched, whereas others remain tough 
even then. Vincent [96] and Bucknall et al. [89] propose, therefore, the following 
qualitative impact resistance rating: brittle (an < 40 kJ /m2 ), brittle if bluntly notched, 
brittle if sharply notched, tough but crack propagating, and very tough and crack ar-
resting. 
The characteristic impact behavior of brittle polymers can conveniently be out-
lined using polystyrene as an example. Ramsteiner [105] has quite recently performed 
instrumented impact test on standard prismatic polystyrene bars. An inspection of 
the broken samples revealed that they had failed through rapid propagation of a crack 
emanating from the more or less highly crazed tensile zone. The length of the longest 
crazes was generally identical to the length of the mirror-like zone of the fracture 
surface. The force-deflection curves obtained in this instrumented impact test show 
205 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
a slightly non-linear increase of the load during 1 ms followed by a rapid drop to 
zero within less than 50 tJ.S (Fig. 8.24). 
The deformation mechanisms taking place during rapid loading can be inter-
preted as follows: The deformation is homogeneous up to a strain level where crazes 
are initiated. The craze initiation stress depends on molecular weight, sample treat-
ment, time and temperature (cf. Chapter 9). For the above experiments it would 
be reasonable to assume that crazes are initiated once the load attains between 60 
and 70% of the maximum load. The maximum of the load corresponds to the point 
where rapid crack propagation sets in.

(A) polystyrene as moulded, (B) annealed 30 min at 130 0 C. 
The impact toughness of a brittle polymer (area under the load-deformation 
curve) is essentially determined by the energy We to reach the stage of rapid crack 
propagation (maximum of P). The energy input for separation of the material during 
the phase of rapid crack propagation is negligible (Fig. 8.24). One of the most im-
portant aspects of the impact toughness of brittle polymers concerns, therefore, the 
limiting conditions under which rapid crack propagation in a material becomes pos-
sible. This problem, the fracture mechanics approach, will be treated in Chapter 9. 
The absolute values of the largest bending force Fm or of the largest stresses in the 
tensile fiber are not a measure of impact toughness. In fact an annealing treatment 
(30 min. at 130°C) of an injection moulded polystyrene bar increased the impact 
toughness (due to increased deflection <5) from 18 to 21 kJ/m2 while decreasing Fm 
from 235 to 215 N [105]. 
Before 'characterizing the role of molecular chains in impact loading the fracture 
of normally tough polymers (e.g. HDPE, PVC, PP, PA) will be studied. Cleavage frac-
ture is difficult to obtain by bending and occurs only in notched specimens of low 
aspect ratio (Ls/D) or if the rate of loading is high (impact loading). In samples of 
HDPE with extremely high molecular weight (Mw > 106 g/mole) cleavage fracture 
does not occur at all. The fracture surface shown in Figure 8.25 was obtained by 
Gaube and Kausch [106] in impact loading at 20°C from a standard-HDPE bar con-
taining a knife cut. The surface clearly reveals three different morphologies: 
a zone of thermally activated crack growth starting from the knife cut (enlarged 
in Fig. 8.26) 
a zone of unstable crack propagation under a condition of tensile strains 
206 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
a zone where the now rapidly propagating crack is deviated through the stresses 
in the compressive fiber of the bending specimen 
Within the zone of thermal crack growth two features seem to be of particular 
interest, the cellular area II (enlarged in Figs. 8.27 to 8.29) and the void containing 
area III (enlarged in Figs. 8.30 and 8.31). Figures 8.27 to 8.31 give an impression 
of the large plastic deformation of the surface within rosettes and ridges where the 
walls are drawn by up to several hundred per cent. Even the surface of an unstable 
propagating crack (area IV, enlarged in Figs. 8.32 and 8.33) is not smooth but plas-
ticly deformed throughout. The morphological details of the fracture surface zones

clearly indicate that crack initiation - even under impact loading - does not simply 
occur by cutting those molecular chains which happen to traverse the planes of lar-
gest tensile stresses. Due to the limited lateral load transfer between unoriented, un-
crosslinked chains (cf. Chapter 5) plastic deformation always precedes eventual chain 
breakage.

On the basis of the foregoing discussion of the phenomenology of impact frac-
ture it can be said that the impact resistance of a material is increased by all molecu-
lar properties or processes which assist the distribution and dissipation of the me-
chanical energy and permit the attainment of a large deflection before inception of 
rapid crack propagation. In particular the importance of the relaxation behavior 
[91,93-96], of high molecular weight [106], of partial orientation [l08], and of 
the unoccupied volume [92] have been emphasized. 
A maximum fractional unoccupied volume if) was defined by Litt et al. [92] 
through the densities of the amorphous (Pa) and the crystalline state (Pc) as: 
(8.15) 
The 1 values of common polymers at room temperature vary between zero and 
0.12. Litt found a good - although not perfect - correlation between 1 and impact 
strength. He indicates that polymers with high impact strength all have 1 > 0.07. 
Considerable qualitative evidence has been cited in the literature (e.g. 88- 105) 
that the intensities of the low-temperature relaxation peaks deriving from main-chain 
motion ({3 and 'Y peaks) are related to impact toughness. A certain correlation has 
to be expected since an increased molecular mobility 
reduces the level of stored elastic energy at a given sample deformation and load 
rate, 
prolongs the phase of thermal crack growth, i.e. retards the inception of an un-
stable crack, 
and increases the energy expenditure during crack propagation. 
Although all three effects tend to increase impact toughness a correlation will 
be limited by the fact that the relaxation behavior is determined in the linear anelastic 
range of stresses and at small strain rates. These conditions are quite different from 
those of an impact test. A quantitative discussion also has to be based on a fracture 
mechanical analysis of crack initiation and propagation (cf. Chapter 9). 
210 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
The impact resistance of a polymer is reduced by all factors which lead to a 
general or local increase of stored elastic energy at a given deformation but are not 
accompanied by an overproportional increase in strength Thus the stress concen-
trating effect of notches, flaws, or inclusions in an otherwise unchanged polymer 
considerably lowers its impact resistance. Increasing the degree of cross-linking 
beyond the point which insures the loading of all chains only leads to the formation of 
short, tightly anchored chain segments. Such segments are the first to be overloaded 
and scissioned upon straining. The small impact resistance of fully cured thermosett-
ing resins underlines this point. Reinforcing thermoplastics by short random fibers 
increases their rigidity more effectively than their strength which leads to a net decrease 
of impact resistance. 
A considerable toughening is to be expected, if strength and deformation can be 
made to increase simultaneously. Such an effect is realized through the partical orien-
tation of an un-oriented, brittle polymer. For PS drawn to A = 3.4 Retting [108] 
reports increases in tensile strength from 47 to 80 MN/m2 and of strain at break 
from 7 to 22%. The IUP AC Working Party "Structure and Properties of Commercial 
Polymers" studied systematically the effect of orientation of various polystyrene 
samples (homo polymers and rubber-modified polystyrenes) on optical and mechanical 
properties [109,110]. It was observed that the impact strength an of un notched homo-
polymer specimen increased with draw ratio from about 3 at A = 1 to more than 
50 kJ/m2 at A = 6 if the molecular orientation was parallel to the main specimens 
dimension. In a perpendicular direction an decreased from 3 to 0.3 kJ/m2 for the 
homopolymer and from about 9 to 2 kJ/m2 for a commercially available rubber-
modified polystyrene [109, 110]. 
The principal effect of chain backbone properties on impact strength has become 
clear. A chain does not so much contribute to impact strength through the level of 
stress l/Ib it supports at the moment of chain scission or disentanglement but rather 
through the energy dissipated before l/Ib is reached. Chains are loaded in shear which 
necessitates the displacement of chains with respect to each other. A maximum of 
energy dissipation is obtained, therefore, if the intermolecular shear stresses are large 
but insufficient to break a chain (cf. Eq. 5.41) and if the chains do not easily disent-
angle so as to insure chain slip over large volume elements (Fig. 8.28). 
B. Failure Under Constant Load 
Subjecting a specimen to a constant load evidently can have one of three results: 
the specimen breaks upon application of the load 
the specimen fails after some time 
the specimen carries the load for an indefinite period of time. 
Generally the third result is technologically desirable. In order to define the 
region of permissible loads a study of the delayed failure, i.e. of the time-dependent 
strength, is indispensable. 
Owing to its fundamental importance the time-dependent strength of load-bear-
ing polymers has been extenSively investigated with temperature as the principal para-

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
meter. In Figures lA, l.5, and 3.7 stress-time-temperature diagrams of various ther-
moplastics are represented. The phenomenon of a delay between load application 
and final failure has found numerous interpretations. Among these interpretations 
one group is based on purely statistical considerations. There the time-to-failure tb 
is inversely related to the probability that a certain detrimental event takes place 
in an otherwise unchanged material Such events are e.g. the formation of a void of 
sufficient size or the coincidence of local fracture events. The statistical aspects of 
fracture have been discussed in Section II of Chapter 3. 
A second group of interpretations is based on reaction rate theory and on the 
gradual exhaustion of the polymer load carrying capability due to the breakage 
and/or displacement of elements and/or to the formation of defects (cf. Section IV 
of Chapter 3). At this point the role of molecular backbone chains in delayed frac-
ture of non-oriented polymers is to be elucidated. 
The presence of long and flexible chains causes a polymeric material to show 
a monotonic, partly anelastic deformation under constant load, viz. a creep defor-
mation. In statistical theories of fracture generally no special consideration is made 
of the extent of creep deformation. From Section IV of Chapter 3 it may be recalled 
that the kinetic theory of Zhurkov and Bueche also does not contain creep deforma-
tion as a variable. The theory of Hsiao-Kausch, developed for solids not showing large 
scale anelastic deformation introduces a time-dependent strain which derives, how-
ever, as a consequence of the gradual network degradation. Bueche and Halpin ex-
pressly consider the macroscopic creep function to reflect the creep behavior of 
molecular filaments which in turn would effect the time-to-rupture. In their theory 
the retarding response of a rubbery or thermoplastic matrix causes the delay - by 
tb - in the growth of a crack nucleus to a critical size. 
The mode of creep failure in thermoplastic materials is not unique. As an example 
the creep fracture morphologies of PVC tubes subjected to different stress levels have 
been reproduced in Chapter 1. At higher stresses (Oy = 50 MN/m2) PVC tubes fail in 
a brittle manner after little creep deformation, and one speaks of delayed brittle frac-
ture (Fig. 1.1). At medium stresses (42 MN/m2) and after prolonged times the tubes 
show large scale plastic deformation, i.e. delayed yielding (Fig. 1.2). At lower stresses 
(Oy < 20 MN/m2) failure does either not occur at all within experimental time scales 
or by a competing mechanism, the formation of a creep crack (Fig. 1.3). 
In brittle fracture the time-to-break tb is determined by the time to initiate a 
rapidly propagating crack at a flaw or material inhomogeneity. The role of chains in 
this process will be discussed in Chapter 9. 
In ductile failure tb is equivalent to the time it takes to develop a local yield zone. 
For this to occur it is necessary that the stress level be insufficient to initiate a running 
crack at a flaw or material inhomogeneity before the homogeneous anelastic deforma-
tion of the sample volume deactivates possible stress concentrators. A transition from 
a ductile to a brittle fracture mode occurs, therefore, if the temperature is lowered 
and/or the load rate is increased sufficiently. The structural weakening associated with 
the continued creep deformation sets the stage for the eventual local yielding. The· 
circumferential creep strain of the afore mentioned PVC pipe at Oy = 42 MN/m2 is 
plotted in Figure 8.34. The curve clearly represents the characteristic parts of a creep 
curve: the instantaneous (elastic) deformation EO, a primary phase with a decreasing

strain rate, a secondary phase where the strain rate is constant and a third phase of 
accelerated creep. During the latter phase creep rates are large, the material approaches 
the yield condition. Such a condition is generally reached first within the most highly 
stressed material, i.e. at the smallest sample cross-section. 
In order to predict the creep behavior and possibly the ensuing failure a number 
of approaches have been proposed. These are based respectively on the theory of 
viscoelasticity - including the concept of free volume - or on empirical represen-
tations of e(t) or of the creep modulus E (t) = aojeCt). The framework of the linear 
theory of viscoelasticity permits the calculation of viscoelastic moduli from relaxa-
tion time spectra and their interconversion. The reduction of stresses and time periods 
according to the time-temperature superposition principle frequently allows estab-
lishment of master-curves and thus the extrapolation to large values of t (cf. Chapter 
2). The strain levels presently utilized in load bearing polymers, however, are gener-
ally in the non-linear range of viscoelasticity. This restricts the use of otherwise known 
relaxation time spectra or viscoelastic moduli in the derivation of e(t) or E(t). 
The limits of linearity are discussed in a review article by Yannas [I 12]. He con-
cludes that for practically all polymers at T-Tg < - 20 K a strain smaller than 1% 
forms the limit of linear response. For semicrystalline polymers (e.g. PP, PAN, PETP, 
PA 66) a limit of 0.1 to 0.4% seems to be valid also above the glass transition tem-
perature T g (even at T - T g > 100 K). 
For amorphous polymers (PC, PIB, NR) the limit increases around T g from 1 
to about 50% of strain [112]. There are some special approaches to a calculation 
of creep and recovery based on non-linear theories of viscoelasticity [112-114]. At 
present it is not possible, however, to predict with sufficient generality the onset of 
accelerated creep and thus of delayed yielding from non-linear viscoelastic theories. 
213 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
Promising results have been obtained, however, using the free volume concept to 
account for the shift of relaxation times with strain and thermal history and to pre-
dict changes offailure stress and failure mechanism [123,124]. 
Empirical approaches to represent the creep curves of materials by mathematical 
functions have been known for more than 60 years. One of the first is the Andrade 
equation 
e(t) - €o = {3 (t/tO)1/3 + Kt 
(8.16) 
where to1/3 and K are adaptable constants [115]. This equation - originally derived 
for metals - describes the uniaxial creep of different materials such as Ph, Cu, Fe, 
Cd, PMMA, PA, PVC within certain time periods very well [111, 115, 116]. Various 
empirical modifications of this equation have been reported [116]. Thus the circum-
ferential creep is described by a similar potential law 
(8.17) 
For PVC tubes the exponent n was found by several investigators to be about 
0.23 [111]. For the dependency of {3 on 00 a hyperbolic sine function has been 
frequently proposed in the literature (e.g. 111, 116). For PVC tubes at 20 °C{3 as-
sumes the form [111]: 
{3 = 0.019 sinh (00/8.85 MN m-2). 
(8.18) 
Equations (8.17) and (8.18) permit the calculation of €(t, 00) at 20 °C. They thus 
also permit one to determine at which stress a specified strain value € 1 is being reached 
after very long times. One finds that a strain value €1 = 3% - at which the creep rate 
of moderately stressed PVC tubes (ov = 35 to 48 MN/m2) changes from phase I to 
phase II - will be reached at 00 = 22 MN/m2 only after 50 years. An eventual frac-
ture should take place even later than that. 
A still simpler and more accessible approach to predict the creep strain of engineer-
ing components is based on a logarithmicly linear approximation of the creep modulus, 
E(t): 
log [E(t)/E(to)] =!. log (t/to) log [E(1000 h)/E(l h)]. 
3 
(8.19) 
Values of the 1-h and 1000-h moduli are generally given in the technical literature 
(e.g. 104). At 20 °c and at small stresses (5 to 20 MN/m2) the ratios of E (1000 h) 
E(1 h) of common polymers are of the order of 0.96 (SB), 0.92 to 0.93 (PC,PETP, 
fiber reinforced thermoplastics), 0.88 to 0.90 (PS, PVC, PMMA, POM), and 0.72 to 
0.79 (HDPE, PP, ABS). Whereas extrapolation methods are frequently the only means 
available they are subject to all the limitations introduced by the gradual development of 
structural weakening (demonstrated by the change from a decelerating creep rate to 
an accelerating one). Also the action of competing processes (creep crack develop-
ment) is generally not taken into account by this extrapolation method. 
214 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
The development of a creep crack is the dominating failure mechanism of non-
oriented thermoplastics at smaller stresses (see diagrams Fig. 1.4 and 1.5). The frac-
ture surface morphology of a typical creep crack is reproduced in Figure 1.7. The 
final failure of that sample had been caused by crack growth over the whole wall 
thickness. 
The pattern of creep-crack failure shows the three well-known phases: a period 
tj of apparently homogeneous deformation up to the point of crack initiation, a 
period ta of thermally activated slow crack growth, and a final period tr of unstable 
crack growth. An inspection of loaded samples during and after the creep experiihent 
reveals a number of morphological features: 
creep cracks initiate at flaws or material inhomogeneities, more often in the sur-
face zones (Figs. 1.7, 8.35a) but also in the bulk material (Fig. 8.35b) [111, 117, 
118]; 
Fig. 8.35. Fracture surface of creep cracks in LOPE tubes (Courtesy of P. Stockmayer, [1181). 
(a) crack initiation at inside boundary of tube wall, Oy = 2 MN m-2, T = 80 °C, tb = 140 h, 
(b) crack initiation within tube wall, Oy = 2 MN m -2, T = 80 °C, tb = 7082 h. 
the initiated crack grows through thermal activation during a period ta under 
apparently constant conditions; this is evidenced by the appearance of the "mirror 
zone", the frequently ideally circular or semicircular, smooth interior fracture 
surface (Figs. 1.7, 8.35b); depending on the stress level the mirror zone may ex-
tend over almost the complete wall thickness of tubular specimens; 
at higher magnifications of the mirror zones it can be seen that the surfaces are 
not smooth on a molecular level; in the case of amorphous PVC an irregular, rough, 
and scaly surface is observed (Fig. 8.36) and in the case of semi-crystalline PE a 
cellular, locally highly drawn surface morphology becomes apparent (Fig. 1.8); 
inspection of transparent tubular samples under load and of non-transparent 
samples after an interruption of the creep test showed that in PVC and PE creep 
crack development started rather late in the experiment, i.e. tj was larger than 
0.90 tb [111, 117]; in PP tubes the first creep cracks could be detected at tj being 
about 0.5 tb [1171. 
Before developing a hypothesis as to the origin of creep crack formation it must 
be discussed which information can be obtained from an evaluation of the stress-time-
215

temperature diagrams (Figs. 1.4,1.5,3.7, and 3.11). The essential feature certainly 
is that within a large interval of time the logarithm of the time-to-break tb decreases 
linearly with increasing uniaxial or principal stress ao. Anyone of these straight lines 
can be expressed by 
(8.20) 
where to, A, and a are constant with respect to time and stress. As discussed in Sec-
tion IV of Chapter 3 various authors have proposed that these "constants" have a 
more general significance. Most approaches work with an Arrhenius equation: 
(8.21 ) 
In this form Uo , 'Y, and to are supposedly independent of temperature. The ex-
perimental data of Savitskii et al. [119] plotted in Figure 3.7 verify this point for a 
cellulose nitrate film and the polyamide 6 mono filaments investigated. For each 
material only one set of constants is necessary to describe all data points. For cel-
lulose nitrate the authors obtained Uo = 159 kllmol, 'Y = 644· 10-6 m3/mol, 
to = 10- 13 s and for the oriented polyamide 6 (Capron) Uo = 184 kllmol, 
'Y = 113 . 10-6 m3 /mol, to = 10-13 s. 
In the case of PVC tubes one obtains from an evaluation of Figure 1.4 accord-
ing to Eq. (8.21) values of Uo = 397 kllmol, 'Y = 1740 . 10-6 m3/mol and (a purely 
formal value of) to = 1.7 . 10-52 S. It should be noted that this set of parameters 
describes the PVC fracture times notwithstanding the fact that these data belong to 
three different fracture modes. In the stress-time curves of non-oriented semicrystal-
line polymers (PE, PP) one observes a drop of strength at larger values of tb, the well-
known bend (Fig. 1.5). The data of the flat portions (relating predominantly to 
ductile failure) can be represented by 
216 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
Do = 307 kJ/mol, 'Y = 4390 . 10-6 m3/mol, and to = 3 . 10-40 S 
and the data of the steep portions (creep crack failure) by 
Do = 181 kJ/mol, 'Y = 3610 . 10-6 m3/mol, and to = 8 . 10-20 s. 
For oriented semicrystalline polymers Zhurkov et al. [18] report: 
HDPEDo = 113 kJ/mol, 'Y = 109.10-6 m3/mol, to = 10-11 s 
LDPe Do = 117 kJ /mol, 'Y = 247 . 10-6 m3/mol, to = 10-12 S 
PP 
Do = 125 kJ/mol, 'Y = 213 . 10-6 m3/mol, to = 10-12 s. 
These formal evaluations need discussion. The good correspondence between 
Do and the dissociation energy of the weakest main chain bonds for many of the 
(mostly oriented) polymeric materials investigated by him has led Zhurkov [120, 18] 
to establish his kinetic theory of fracture. This theory assumes that all important 
steps contributing to the fracture of a material are not only related to but even con-
trolled by the breakage of primary bonds, hence by Do and to. As important steps 
chain scission, rnicrocrack formation, and crack propagation through material separa-
tion have been considered [3]. The effect on fracture behavior of structure, orienta-
tion, dimensionality of the state of stress, morphology, and homogeneity of chemi-
cally "identical" polymers must be expressed, therefore, through the single parameter 'Y. 
The parameter 'Y has the dimension m3/mol and is termed activation volume. 
With reference to Chapter 3, Section IV, it should designate the thermally activated 
volume if the stress 00 indeed acts on this volume directly and without intermediates. 
This is approximately the case in flow but not in chain scission. The scission of a 
chain necessitates molecular stresses l/Ib which are clearly much larger than the applied 
external stresses 00. For PA 6 molecular stress concentration factors l/Ib/OO of 
between 10 and 40 are commonly determined (cf. Chapters 7 and 8 above). Taking 
12· 10-6 m3/mol for the activation volume {3 ofthe chain scission process a param-
eter 'Y = {31/J/oo of 120 to 480· 1O-6m3/mol should be predicted. The activation 
volume of 12 . 10-6 m3/mol amounts to (0.27 nm)3 or to a stretching of the ruptur-
ing bond by 0.1 nm. 
The effect of the structural parameter chain orientation on 'Y becomes apparent 
from Figure 3.11. There the stress-lifetime data of PAN fibers [74] are plotted with 
draw ratio A as a parameter. The highest draw ratio (A = 17.3) corresponds to a'Y of 
248· 10-6 m3/mol, A = 4 to 590, A = 2.62 to 841 and A = 1 to 'Y = 1200 . 10-6 m3/ 
mol. The 'Y values are the smaller the more homogeneously the macroscopic stress 
is distributed over the molecular chains. 
The foregoing discussion shows that the 'Y values of PMMA, PVC, and PE can 
hardly be explained on the basis of chain scission unless extremely large stress con-
centration values are postulated. In the case of PVC the 'Y corresponds to (1. 7 nm)3 
which points to the involvement of larger domains in the activation of the creep 
process. The fact that the PVC fracture data of all modes are described by one equa-
tion seems to indicate that all modes depend on the creep deformation. Once a cer-
217 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
tain structural weakening has resulted from creep the final failure is accomplished 
by one of the three modes, e.g. by brittle fracture at large stresses, ductile failure, 
or creep crack development. Since the final period accounts only for a small frac-
tion of tb no effect on the slope of Qn tb/tO is noted. 
This is different in the case of semicrystalline polymers which form a 
"ductile and a brittle branch" of the stress-lifetime curve. There it can be said that 
two different mechanisms are active, of which the creep crack initiation has the 
apparently smalle~ activation energy (181 kJ/mol) and activation volume (1.8 nm)3. 
The fact that chain breakages in PE are rarely observed even at high stresses and low 
temperatures in highly oriented samples makes it very unlikely that the mechanism 
of creep crack initiation involves chain breakages. 
Kagan et al. [121] have studied the effect of supramolecular structure on the 
time-dependent strength of HDPE. They found a good correlation between the 1-h 
(plastic) creep strength and the yield strength for materials of different crystallinity, 
density (0.945 < p < 0.960 g cm-3) crystallite size, and spherulite diameter. These 
parameters hardly affected the activation volume 'Y but slightly the activation 
energy of the plastic deformation process (parallel displacement of the ductile branch 
of the a-log t/to curve). On the other hand they found a clear tendency to higher 
long-tenn brittle strength (resistance against creep crack formation) with an increase 
in density and size of crystallites and with a reduction of spherulite diameter. Gaube 
et al. [117] also report that an increase in crystallinity (Le. density) of PE, PP, PETP, 
POM, PA leads to a higher yield strength - at lower strain values - and to a higher 
ductile strength. They point out, however, that the decrease of brittle strength in 
the steep region begins sooner, the higher the crystallinity and the lower the molec-
ular weight. The ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene GUR does not show creep 
crack formation at all. Judging from these observations the process of creep crack 
formation seems to be related to the gradual disentanglement of chains and the ease 
of void opening in the inter-crystalline and/or inter-spherulitic regions. Both mech-
anisms must be fairly independent of creep deformation. The fact that generally creep 
cracks are only observable shortly before they cause the final failure indicates that 
these cracks grow at considerable rates once they are initiated. 
Morphological effects on the initiation of creep cracks were also studied by Stock-
mayer [118]. Using an elaborate peeling technique he transformed whole tube sec-
tions into thin films of up to 0.06 mm thickness (Fig. 8.37). The walls of LDPE tubes, 
transformed into films of 0.9 m2 area, then were scanned under a microscope for 
flaws or material inhomogeneities (Fig. 8.38). Inhomogeneities could be detected in 
every tube and have been related to an imperfect blending of the LDPE with carbon 
black [118]. Stockmayer also found two interesting correlations: 
creep cracks were initiated preferentially in those zones which also contained 
(the most) inhomogeneities 
tube lifetimes were greatly reduced if the creep cracks had been initiated in the 
outside or inside zones of the wall; from an ensemble of tubes tested at 80°C 
and having an average lifetime tb of 2340 h tubes with inhomogeneities (and crack 
initiation) in the boundary zones failed after a it, of 740 h; tubes with crack initia-
tion in the central region of a wall lasted to it, = 7400 h, Le. a factor of 10 longer 
[118,149].

Comments are necessary concerning the significance of to and 00 in Eq. (8.21). 
Values of 10-12 to 10-14 s have been frequently determined for to; they have been 
assigned to longitudinal vibrational modes of the backbone chain. For PVC and PE 
extremely small values are obtained which certainly cannot be interpreted in the 
same manner. With flow processes it must be recognized that the activation energy 
is not temperature independent but decreases with temperature:

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
A value tg formally determined from experimental data according to Eq. (S.21) 
contains, therefore, the two terms to and the temperature-independent part of 
aa~o ~~ . The latter term seems to be responsible for tg values of 10- 40 s and less. 
The term 00 in Eq. (S.21) has been taken to represent the macroscopic uniaxial 
stress 00 in the event of uniaxial stretching - or the largest principal stress component 
Oy in the event of multiaxial states of stress. This does not mean that the times to 
fracture of tubular and uniaxial specimens are always identical if only Oy is equal 00. 
As discussed above the creep functions in these two cases are described by different 
potential laws, namely by Eqs. (S.16) and (S.17) respectively. 
A systematic study of the effect of the state of stress on the lifetime of PVC 
tubes has been carried out by Smotrin et a1. [151]. They found that at short times 
to fracture (at stresses of 50 MN m- 2 ) the simple Rankine criterion 0 < 0* repre-
sented their failure data in two-dimensional stress space. With increasing times to 
fracture, however, the von Mises criterion gave the better representation. Gotham 
[152] studied the uniaxial creep failure of 15 different polymer materials at 20 0 C. 
Within a time range of up to 107 s he observed brittle failure with injection molding 
grade PMMA, PS, SAN, and glass-fiber reinforced PA 66, and ductile failure for PP, 
bulk cast PMMA, PC, PSU, PVC, ABS, POM, PA 66, and P4MP. 
Concluding this section one may say that there is very little evidence that the 
loading and breaking of chains controls the creep of unoriented polymers. The soften-
ing mechanism - common to all linear polymers [122, 12S] - responsible for the 
change from decelerated to accelerated creep is generally related to segmental motion 
and changes in intermolecular attraction but not to a reduction of chain length or 
strength. A search for free radical formation in creep of non-oriented polymers car-
ried out by Jansson et al. [125] is as yet also inconclusive. These authors had included 
radical scavengers in PVC which led to a considerable reduction in creep rate (by a 
factor of up to about 10). They state, however, that it has not been possible to sepa-
rate the stabilisation effect from the effect of mechanical reinforcement [125]. 
c. Homogeneous Fatigue 
1. Phenomenology and Experimental Parameters 
Polymeric engineering materials subjected to strong mechanical and environmental 
excitation show - as any other material - a gradual degradation of their performance 
including eventual failure. If the property changes are mostly due to chemical reac-
tions one speaks of corrosion, or of radiative degradation. The term fatigue (Zerriit-
tung) is used if a deterioration of material properties is caused by the repeated cyclic 
or random application of mechanical stresses. The synergistic interaction of mecha-
nical and environmental attack leads to the phenomenon of environmental stress 
corrosion (ESC). The role of molecular chains in ESC, and in corrosive, thermal, and 
radiative degradation will be discussed in the final Section of this Chapter. The fa-
tigue of polymeric fibers has already been treated in Sections I F and G of this Chap-
220 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
ter. The present Section, therefore, will deal mainly with the principal aspects of 
fatigue and with isotropic thermoplastics. The fatigue of polymeric engineering 
materials has received a growing attention in the last thirty years. Review articles on 
this complex subject have appeared from time to time; the reader is referred to the 
ones authored by Andrews [126] and more recently by Manson and Hertzberg 
[127-128], Oberbach [129-130], and Schultz [131]. In addition, a large number 
of research papers have been published of which an incomplete listing is given in 
this Section [116,132-147]. 
It is the general observation that failure in repeated loading occurs at load levels 
which are lower than the stresses sustained under the conditions of static loading 
(creep) or of monotonously increasing deformation (drawing). The lower the stress 
level to which a material is subjected the larger the number N of load cycles which 
are sustained. The total time tf, however, which a fatigued sample spends under 
load is generally much smaller than the time to failure under static loading condi-
tions. Load reversals or load interruptions have an accelerating effect, therefore, on 
the loss of load bearing capability; load reversals or interruptions constitute the ele-
ments of fatigue. It may already be stated at this point that the accelerating effect 
of load reversals has to be related to two characteristic material properties: 
the anelastic response which leads within each loading cycle to a dissipation of 
mechanical energy as heat and 
the occurrence of molecular rearrangements which may lead to the disentangle-
ment and slip of chain segments, to local reorientation, and/or to the formation 
of voids. 
It has to be expected, and must be recognized, therefore, that three principal 
mechanisms may contribute to fatigue failure: thermal softening, excessive creep or 
flow, and/or the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks. 
The experimental parameters of a fatigue test have been aptly defined by An-
drews [126]: 
. 
a periodically varying stress system having a characteristic stress amplitude, Lla; 
a corresponding periodic strain amplitude, Ll€; 
a mean stress level, am;

More recently the (computer-programmed) random loading has also found grow-
ing application in testing structural components [132]. Of course, the above para-
meters can be combined in different ways and be changed within a test. They par-
tially depend upon each other and on environmental conditions. 
The experimental equipment will not be described here, the reader is referred 
to the cited review articles or pertinent research papers (e.g. 132-138). In practice 
five different types of stress-strain control are employed which are classified by 
Andrews [126] and Manson et al. [127] as: 
periodic tensile loading (between fixed stress limits, in tension or compression); 
[133-135]

periodic loading (between fixed strain limits, in tension or compression); [133-

reversed bending stress (implicit in flexing a sheet in one dimension); [136] 
reversed bending stresses in two dimensions (by rotary deflection of a cylindrical 
specimen); [137] 
reversed shear stresses, e.g. obtained by torsional deformation. [138] 
2. Thermal Fatigue Failure 
In cyclic loading of a viscoelastic solid an amount of energy d W is dissipated per 
cycle. For sinusoidal loading in the anelastic range, one obtains 
u(t) =uosinwt 
dW =1Tuo€osino. 
(8.24) 
(8.25) 
This hysteresis heating leads to a noticeable temperature rise. At low test fre-
quencies and low stress levels the temperature increase of the test specimen generally 
approaches a finite value .. A PA 6 sample for instance fatigued at 50 Hz, at a constant 
stress amplitude of 8 MN m- 2 , and at an ambient temperature of 21°C, assumed a 
stable temperature of 27 °c after some 104 cycles [139-140]. At this temperature 
mechanical energy input and thermal energy loss were in equilibrium. 
At higher frequencies w, higher ambient temperatures, or higher stress amplitudes, 
however, the energy input into a sample becomes larger than the heat which can be 
transferred out of the sample through conduction or radiation. Depending on the 
experimental setup, failure of the sample then occurs through thermal softening and/ 
or plastic flow. The stress and frequency range, where this type of thermal failure 
has to be expected, can be calculated from the energy input, the geometry, and the 
thermal properties of a sample. Thermal equilibrium in a cylindrical sample of radius 
R is reached once 
(8.26) 
approaches zero. The highest temperature, Te , observable at equilibrium in the center 
of the cylinder then amounts to

Ta designates the ambient temperature, h the coefficient of convection at the 
sample surface; and the constants p, cp ' and r.. have their usual significance as den-
sity, specific heat, and heat conductivity of a material. The term r../pcp is also known 
as temperature conductivity number. For conventional polymeric materials this num-
ber assumes values between 1.0 . 10-7 m2 /s (PTFE) and about 2.1 . 10-7 m2 /s 
(HDPE, POM).

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
It should be mentioned at this point that the hysterises heating ~ W in a fatigue 
test with constant-strain amplitude decreases with increasing temperature, since ~ W 
is proportional to 00 sin 5, i.e. to E". Under this condition thermal equilibrium can 
generally be established. The same effect, a decrease of E", can of course be reached 
if a sample is plasticized. The plasticization of an engineering component subjected 
to fatigue at constant-strain amplitude can be, therefore, a suitable way to prolongue 
the fatigue life of the sample [152]. Machyulis et al. [152] point out that the thermo-
stabilization, the fatigue-stabilization, and the plastization effects of various additives 
on polyamide are not related to each other. For optimal results on fracture energy 
and cycles to failure Kuchinskas et al. recommend diffusion stabilization from a 5% 
ethanolic quinhydrone solution at 343 K for 1 h [152]. 
The conditions of thermal failure are especially discussed by Oberbach[129-130] 
for a variety of polymers, by Zilvar [139-140] for PA 6, and by Alf[141] forPMMA 
and unsaturated polyester resins. 
It is only through their effect on the above constants and on the complex modu-
lus E* that the molecular chain structure influences thermal failure. In the context 
of this monograph this type of failure will, therefore, not be discussed any further. 
3. Wohler Curves 
The common observation that the number of cycles to failure, NF , depends on the 
stress or strain amplitude is generally represented in the form of Wohler curves (Woh-
lerkurven, S - N curves). Such a representation accounts for the fact that stress (or 
strain) amplitUde and number of load cycles are the most important of the many 
(and closely interacting) parameters which affect the fatigue life. 
The fatigue data represented by Figure 8.39 were obtained from fully reversed, 
uniaxial tension-compression tests at 0.1 Hz with temperature rises Te-Ta below 
2 K [142]. The three different regions of the S - N curve of polystyrene are fairly 
typical for the fatigue-life curves of other glassy polymers as well. In region I crazes 
form during the ftrst tensile quarter cycle. The fatigue behavior is essentially that of 
a pre-crazed sample. Failure occurs through the initial slow growth of a crack through 
craze material followed by catastrophic crack propagation. The number of cycles to 
failure NF is strongly influenced by the stress amplitude, presumably through the 
strong dependency of the number of crazes on the stress level.

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
Region-II fatigue fracture is characterized by the fact that a period of craze nu-
cleation precedes craze growth and the formation, slow growth, and catastrophic 
propagation of.a crack. This type of fatigue fracture is observed at stress levels 
just below the immediate craze initiation stress ai. The dependency of NF on a is 
considerably reduced. This accounts for the delay in craze initiation as well as for the 
reduced rate of slow crack growth at lower stress levels. The slope (~ 14 MN m-2 
per decade of N F) seems to be characteristic for a variety of polymers [142, 153]. 
The long-life region III essentially forms the endurance limit of the material. 
The dependency of NF on a is extremely small. Crack initiation has a very long in-
cubation period. Analysis of the fracture surfaces of fatigue failures in this region 
reveals furthermore that the slow crack growth mode has two phases. The first shows 
little evidence of crazing, the second resembles the region-II failure mode. 
The above considerations concern polystyrene fatigued by completely reversed 
stress (am = 0, I:l.a = 2a). In principle similar observations are also made with other 
polymers and at other conditions of stress, e.g. under constant maximum stress at 
various stress amplitudes [127, 153]. At this point is should be emphasized that the 
"fatigue process" under conditions II and III comprises at least two phases: an initial 
phase of crack or craze initiation with an apparently homogeneous response of the 
material and a second phase of heterogeneous fatigue with localized and growing 
material discontinuities (fatigue cracks). The second phase in turn comprises several 
modes of crack propagation (thermal and athermal growth, catastrophic failure). 
This will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 9. 
The discrimination between homogeneous and heterogeneous is certainly useful 
although not necessarily always significant. Most of the kinetic theories of failure 
treated in Chapter 3 encompass the two phases of crack initiation and slow crack 
growth. Thus they implicitly assume that the entity of molecular rearrangements 
between the application of load and the end of the slow crack growth period can 
be described by one constitutive equation. 
4. Molecular Interpretations of Polymer Fatigue 
Different experimental observations permit the conclusion that the prolonged peri-
ods of craze or crack initiation at lower stresses are not simply due to the reduced 
probability for crack nucleation in an otherwise unchanged material. The nature of 
the changes occurring on a molecular level during sample fatigue have been investi-
gated by several authors [e.g. 138,143-147,153]. Thus molecular mobility, inter-
action, and damping have been studied by the torsion pendulum [138,134-144] 
and by infra-red technique [138], molecular packing and defect structure by density 
measurements and X-ray scattering technique [144-146] and by the use of samples 
of different molecular weight [153], and morphological changes by the recombina-
tion kinetics of trapped free radicals [146]. The results obtained from these different 
experimental methods characterize the molecular rearrangements, but they do not 
yet permit the establishment of quantitative fatigue limits. 
Through simultaneous application of several of these methods Sikka [144] has 
been able to characterize some molecular rearrangements in homogeneous fatigue. 
He fatigued in cyclic extension thin films (0.075 mm thick) of polystyrene (Tricite) 
224 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
and polycarbonate. Subsequently he investigated these films by Fourier transform 
infrared (FTIR) and mechanical spectroscopy and by X-ray diffraction technique. 
The fatigued PS samples were scanned under an electron microscope to detect any 
crazes that might have developed due to fatigue. No crazes were observed in the 
samples fatigued up to 2500 cycles. 
The FTIR results obtained on a PS film after 2500 cycles are shown in Figures 
8.40 and 8.41. In the superimposed FTIR spectra slight distortions of IR bands 
are noticeable in the frequency range of 900 to 1700 cm-' (Fig. 8.40). To detect 
minute changes caused by the fatigue process Sikka also recorded computer-sub-

tracted FTIR spectra. One such spectrum (fatigued-90% unfatigued) is plotted in 
Figure 8.41, the changes observed in this spectrum are listed in Table 8-IV. 
From X-ray diffraction data Sikka obtained a mean Bragg distance dBragg of 
about 0.48 nm for the unfatigued PS films which showed a decrease of ~ 0.01 nm 
in the fatigued sample (2500 cycles). This negative shift in dBragg was believed to be 
conclusive. It was related to the decrease in interphenyl and intraphenyl distances. 
The fatigue to 2500 cycles also resulted in a change of dynamic mechanical losses 
[144). Figure 8.42 shows a plot of tan 8 versus temperature obtained at a frequency 
of3.5 Hz.

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
The FTIR results seem to indicate that the fatigue process has caused changes 
in the absorption frequencies of various vibrational modes of the phenyl side groups. 
Also the IR bands associated with bending and stretching modes of CH2 groups and 
bending modes of CH groups show frequency shifts and band distortions. These 
results suggest that fatigue has modified the internal and external environment (in-
trachain and interchain interactions) of PS chains. 
On the basis of these assignments and of his X-ray studies Sikka proposes that 
during fatigue weaker Van der Waal's and possibly some backbone bonds are broken. 
This has a twofold effect. The loosening of the structure permits on one hand the 
PS chains to locally rearrange themselves in a more perfect manner and to reduce 
the average intraphenyl and interchain distances. The local rearrangements are, on 
the other hand, accompanied by an increase in free volume in interstitial areas be-
tween the domains of improved order. 
In his experiments with polycarbonate films Sikka [144] used cyclic tensile 
stresses between 50 and 91 % of the yield stress. In the upper stress range the stress-
strain curve was clearly non-linear. He employed the same experimental techniques 
as mentioned before to study molecular fatigue effects. The (occasionally minute) 
shifts in the IR spectrum are made apparent in the computer-subtracted FTIR spec-
trum (Fig. 8.43). Sikka's vibrational assignments of the affected bands are compiled 
in Table 8.5. They indicate a stretching of some backbone chains. X-ray diffraction 
again revealed change of the mean interchain distance. It amounted to a decrease 
of 1.25% after 5800 cycles under a tensile stress reaching 83% of the yield stress Oy . 
No effects of fatigue on orientation could be detected in such samples by birefrin-
gence measurements. The densities decreased by a fraction of up to 0.083% to 
1.1966 g/cm3 .

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
Also in this case one has to conclude that under fatigue stresses chains are 
stretched and locally packed more closely whereas the overall free volume increases. 
The observations discussed in detail above seem to be representative for the 
findings of other authors as well. Bouda et al. [138] report a decrease of density with 
cycle number for PA 6 and PMMA which they ascribe to the formation of micro-
voids. The decrease of heat capacity in PMMA in the temperature range 350 to 
400 K, the decrease of tan 8 at 93 K (1 Hz) and an increase in shear modulus G' in 
the range 100 to 250 K (where no crazes had formed) seemed to indicate a non-
uniform local volume contraction during the fatigue process. 
Schrager [134] investigated epoxy resins of different degrees of cure. A fully 
cured sample showed a monotonous decrease of G' and an increase in tan 8. Notable 
is a complete and persistant recovery of G' and tan 8 within 20 h. An incompletely 
cured sample responded to fatigue loading by an initial rise of G' (indicating comple-
tion of chemical cure simultaneously to chain scission in other parts of the matrix). 
After some 20· 103 cycles chain scission and a decrease of G' dominated. 
Wendorff [145] studied fatigue-induced density fluctuations in polyoxymethylene 
(Hostaform T 1020) by X-ray scattering. He reports several interesting structural de-
tails of these defects: 
a constant concentration of about 1012 cm- 3 
a size growing with stress amplitude and cycle number 
a shape resembling that of a rotation ellipsoid (with axes 2a = 2 to 6 nm, 2b = 
9 to 50 nm) 
the defects have a compliance some 3 to 5 times larger than that of the bulk 
material 
the defects show viscoelastic behavior and a size distribution 
annealing close to the melting temperature leads to partial healing; the defects 
reappear if cycling is resumed 
form and size of the defects depend on crystallization conditions. 
These observations indicate that the defects are microvoids appearing preferen-
tially at interlamellar boundaries oriented perpendicular to the loading direction. 
Similar defects are observed in homogeneous deformation during static loading at 
those strains where the stress-strain curve begins to deviate from linearity [145]. 
Whereas Wendorff states that fatigue does not affect the crystalline regions of 
POM Nagamura et al. [146] report a change of the crystalline mosaic block struc-
ture of HDPE. They arrived at this conclusion by analysis of the trapping and decay 
behavior of 'Y-ray induced free radicals. 
Measurable macroscopic parameters which have been related to the progress of 
material fatigue are creep strain and strain rate [72, 116, 122, 123, 147]. Mindel et al. 
[122] studied the creep rate as a function of strain in pure compression of polycar-
bonate. They found that fatigue loading becomes effective through an increase of 
strain rate after each interruption of loading. Since the strain level after which ac-
celerated creep began remained constant (at 8.8%), fatigue lives were reduced. Ten-
sile creep has frequently been held responsible for the fatigue failure of polymers. 
In 1942 Busse et al. [72] suggested this mechanism for polyamide, cotton and rayon. 
Briiller et al. [147] stated cyclic creep strains were predictable from the Boltzmann 
su perposition principle. 
229 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
Sauer et al. [153] studied particulary the effect of molecular weight on fatigue 
of PS and PE under different alternating stresses. They observed that an increase in 
molecular weight dramatically increases the fatigue life of PS (an increase of the 
number of cycles by a factor of 10 for an increase of M by a factor of 5). This effect 
is partly assigned to the retardation in craze initiation because of the fewer number 
of chain ends and the larger number of entanglements in high molecular weight 
samples. The major contribution derives, however, from the increased resistance of 
the crazed material to rupture (cf. Chapter 9.11). 
Comparing the fatigue behavior ofPE and PS Sauer et al. [153] conclude: 
in both crystalline polymers, like polyethylene, and amorphous polymers, like 
polystyrene, increases of molecular weight lead to increased fatigue lifetimes, for 
a given imposed alternating stress, and to increased endurance limits, 
the ratio of the estimated fatigue endurance limit strength to the nominal static 
fracture strength for specimens prepared from narrow molecular weight poly-
styrene standards rises appreciably with increasing molecular weight, from a value 
of 0.19 for a molecular weight of 160,000 to a value of 0.30 for a molecular weight 
of2·106 . 
if fatigue failure due to excessive thermal heating is avoided, the resistance of 
polyethylene of medium or high molecular weight to alternating loading is con-
siderably greater than that of polystyrene, based on static stress values to produce 
either yield or fracture. Thus, at comparable molecular weights of about 2 . 106 , 
polyethylene gives an estimated ratio of endurance limit strength to yield stress of 
about 0.90 as compared to the 0.30 ratio for polystyrene, 
the greater resistance of crystalline PE to fatigue type failure as compared to 
amorphous PS is attributed primarily to two characteristics. The first concerns 
the phase of homogeneous fatigue. Because PE has a much lower amorphous-
phase T g and consequent greater molecular and chain mobility of its amorphous 
chains, it is much less sensitive to surface or volume flaws; and secondly, because 
of its heterogeneous nature, with crystallites imbedded in an amorphous matrix, 
it is also much more resistant to fatigue crack propagation (cf. Chapter 9). 
D. Yielding, Necking, Drawing 
Shear yielding, i.e. the onset of large-scale intersegmental displacements within a non-
oriented thermoplastic polymer, has a distinct effect on the stress-strain curve. In ten-
sile tests a drop in engineering stress is usually observed and the yield point defined 
as the point of maximum load (Fig. 2.10, curves b and c). In other tests, e.g. in a com-
pression test, there mayor may not be a load drop but a sudden decrease of do/de 
may be noticed. The important phenomenon of yielding has been intensively inves-
tigated. Review articles have appeared almost annually in recent years in the general 
literature [e.g. 114,154-164]. 
The classical continuum mechanical criteria for shear yielding have been dis-
cussed in Chapter 3, Section III A in terms of the three-dimensional state of stress. 
At this point molecular interpretations are reviewed in an attempt to assess the role 
of molecular backbone chains. 
230 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
Experiments at different temperatures, strain rates, and hydrostatic pressures 
have established that shear yielding is a thermally activated process [154-168, 
170-173]. According to Eyring's theory of flow (Chapter 3) strain rate can be ex-
pressed as 
€ = A exp - (Vo - ru)/RT. 
(8.28) 
This gives the following dependence of yield stress uy on strain rate and tem-
perature: 
uy 
Vo

€ 
-=- +-Qn-
T

(8.29) 
This equation was found to be valid for a number of polymers (pVC, PC, PMMA, PS, 
CA) in more or less extended regions of temperature and strain rate [154,156,158]. 
The (temperature-dependent) activation volumes r had at room-temperature values 
between 1.4 (PMMA) and 17 nm3 (CA). This means that according to this concept 
polymer deformation at the yield point is due to the thermally activated displace-
ment of molecular domains over volumes which are between 10 (PMMA) and 120 
times (PVC) as large as a monomer unit. It has been indicated by several authors 
[155-158,160] that the above criterion (Eq. 8.29) corresponds to the Coulomb 
yield criterion TO + IlP = constant. The coefficient of friction 11 is inversely propor-
tional to r. From an analysis of their experimental data on polycarbonate according 
to Eq. (8.29) Bauwens-Crowet et al. [158] conclude that two flow processes exist. 
They relate these to an a-process Gumps of segments of the backbone chains) and 
to the ~ mechanical relaxation mechanism. 
Argon and Bessonov [161,162] have recently presented a molecular model of 
shear yielding which involves the rotation of molecular segments against intra- and 
intermolecular forces and the systematic, pairwise reduction of kinks in a strained 
polymer. They calculate the free enthalpy of activation of a double kink in a small 
bundle of collectively acting molecules, LlG*, as 
LlG* = 31TGw2a3 '[I _ 8.5 (1 _1)5/6 (~) 5/6] , 
16(1-1) 
G 
(8.30) 
where G is the shear modulus, I) Poisson's ratio, w the angle of bundle rotation dur-
ing the activation, and a the mean bundle radius. Having examined a large number 
of glassy polymers Argon and, Bessonov fmd that the bundles comprise between 
about one (PMMA, PS), two (PPO), three to four (PC, PETP) or seven (PI) molecular 
chains. The distances between double kinks along the molecule range from 0.8 to 
1.6 nm [162]. 
All of these proposed interpretations of yielding state that yielding is brought 
about by a displacement of neighboring chain segments under change of conforma-
tion. In the process of yielding of unoriented thermoplastics no large axial chain 
stresses are built up and no chain scission has ever been observed in strains below 
the yield strain €y. Yielding is equivalent to the onset oflarge scale orientational 
deformation. It is generally accompanied by a decrease of the material resistance 
231 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
against deformation, by a reduction of sample cross-section in a plane perpendicular 
to the direction of tensile plastic deformation and by a temperature increase due to 
the dissipated mechanical work. Material and thermal weakening at constant or in-
creasing true stress give rise to a plastic instability. In uniaxial tensile straining this 
instability manifests itself as 
shear banding [155-157], 
neck formation [165-175], or 
homogeneous drawing [176-182]. 
The phenomenon of crazing also can be regarded as a (although localized) 
deformational instability. It will be discussed in the final chapter. 
The large scale "plastic" deformation associated with yielding quite naturally 
gives rise to shear and extensional deformation of molecular coils.The response of 
molecular chains in solution to shear or extensional flow has been described in Chap-
ter 5I1E. It has been stated that chain breakages are obtained if strain rates are suffi-
ciently large (generally above 600 S-l). The strain rates in a yielding solid are con-
siderably smaller. The local strain rates across the neck of a sample are typically 1 s-l 
or less (Fig. 7.12). On the other hand molecular friction coefficients in a solid are so 
much larger than in a liquid that large forces will be transmitted once a chain mole-
cule slips through the surrounding matrix. As discussed in 5I1 E axial forces sufficient 
for chain breakage will be built up if the slipping chains have a highly extended con-
formation.1t must be expected, therefore, that all those chain segments rupture as a 
consequence of necking or drawing which are properly oriented and which initially 
do have a highly extended conformation or assume such a conformation at the early 
stages of the yield process. With regard to chain breakage in necking or drawing the 
total orientational strain A. and the drawing temperature T d are the most important 
variables. 
There are very few reports on ESR investigations of chain rupture during necking 
and drawing [21, 169, 174-177]. These reports will be discussed in the following and 
be supplemented by observations with other methods: the IR spectroscopy of chain-
end groups [178] and the determination of molecular weight distributions [179]. 
Zaks et al. [169] investigated the neck formation in polycarbonate. As inferred 
from the reduction of sample cross-section in the neck, an orientational strain A. of 
about 2 had been imparted onto the material while "passing through the neck". At 
room temperature and at various sample stretching rates corresponding to strain 
rates in the neck of between 0.02 to 2 S-l , the authors [169] observed a fairly stable 
but not very well resolved ESR spectrum. The intensity of this spectrum increased 
with the rate of passage of undrawn PC through the neck from 3 . 1015 to 1.8 . 1016 
spins/g (Fig. 7.12). The authors also studied the behavior of stable nitroxide radicals 
and of radicals formed by photolysis during necking of LDPE and PC. The thus ob-
served increased decay of the initially present radicals may be assigned to the reac-
tion with newly formed radicals but, as well, to the strain-induced increased rate of 
recombination or decay of radicals already present. The existence of the latter phe-
nomenon in highly oriented HDPE, PP, PA 12, and PETP was pointed out by Becht 
et al. [47]. 
The ESR technique had also been employed by Lishnevskii [174, 175] who found 
that during cold drawing of PP, PVC, PA 6, and aromatic polyamide fibers free 
232 

II. Deformation, Creep, and Fatigue of Unoriented Polymers 
radicals were formed in a concentration of between 8· 1014 to 3· 1016 g-1. 
Matthies et al. [176] noted the intense coloring of different polyoxamide and hexa-
methylene isophthalamide fibers during cold drawing. They confirmed by ESR measure-
ment that the formation of free radicals had given rise to the appearance of the color 
centers. In the case of the polyoxamide fibers they associated these color centers 
with the -NH-CO-CO-NH-group. The largest concentration of spins observed 
was 1 . 1016 g-1. 
The above ESR experiments [174-176] were carried out on cold drawn 
samples immediately after completion of the drawing procedure. Thus the measured 
radical concentrations [R] are integral values. Nothing can be said about the form of 
[R(A)], but, in all probability, most of the chain breakages have occurred during the 
final stages of the drawing procedure, i.e. within moderately to highly oriented and 
even microfibrillar structures. This assumption is supported by the ESR experiments 
of Levin et al. [21] and Chiang and Sibilia [177] with fibers partially oriented at ele-
vated temperatures. 
The hot drawing of PA 6 at temperatures of e.g. 150 to 210°C permits one to apply 
orientational strains of up to A = 6 without breaking an observable number of chains 
[21]. As discussed in detail in Chapters 7 and 8-1, free radicals are formed if such fibers 
are stretched at room temperature. For a PA-6 fiber hot stretched to A = 3.7 radical 
formation began at an "additional cold" strain of 20%, i.e. at a total elongation of 
A = 4.44 [21]. PETP fibers hot stretched to A = 3 showed some radical formation 
at "cold" strains of between 5 and 20% but deformed by chain slippage thereafter -
up to a strain of 50%, i.e. to a total elongation of A = 4.5 [177]. In HDPE films no 
breakage of chains could be observed during cold drawing unless the draw ratio A 
exceeded 5 [178]. 
An infra-red study of the latter material also revealed [178] that the number N 
of coiled rotary isomers (chains containinggg andgtg conformations) depends on 
the draw ratio A. While N (A) is rather constant in < 5, N decreases linearly at higher 
draw ratios to reach about 0.2 N (1) at A = 12. 
That chain scission occurs during drawing of PA-6 multifilament yarn becomes 
apparent from an investigation of the molecular weight. Using a fractional precipi-
tation technique Sengupta et al. [179] determined the molecular weight distribu-
tions of undrawn yarn and of yarn drawn at 35°C to A = 2.92 and A = 4.20 respec-
tively. They observed that for the yarn drawn to A = 2.92 the molecular weight 
distribution is unimodal as in the undrawn fiber, but the peak is smaller and 
slightly shifted toward smaller values of M. At A = 4.2 this peak is further di-
minished and shifted and a second peak at low molecular weights (at less than half 
the viscosity number) appears [179]. 
Indirect evidence of the likely occurrence of chain scission was proposed by 
Davis et al. [170-173] who studied the deformation behavior of high molecular 
weight low density PE (and of PTFE) at hydrostatic pressure. From the pressure 
sensitivity of the rate of plastic deformation they derived a zero-pressure activation 
volume of 0.266 nm3 which they suggested to correspond to the activation volume 
'Y for the breakage of a PE chain. 
From the presented evidence it must be concluded that during the initial stages 
of necking and drawing (A < 3) of semicrystalline polymers chain breakages do not 
233 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
occur in large numbers. This conclusion is completely in accord with the Peterlin 
model of the "plastic deformation" of semicrystalline polymers. As described in 
2.11 B the early stages of plastic deformation comprise the destruction of an original 
spherulitic texture and its transition to the new microfibrillar structure. During the 
transition interspherulitic tie molecules are most highly loaded and some are ex-
pected to break. The ties between the crystal blocks, however, are generally not 
severed at this stage and are instrumental in establishing the microfibrillar structure. 
If a semicrystalline polymer is carried from moderate to high extension ratios 
(3 < A. < 10) then chain breakages can occur [21,169,174-178]. All of the men-
tioned breakages must be considered to be of the static-loading type (cf. 5 II Band 
D). They become possible in large numbers because the presence of laterally rigid 
crystalline regions permits: 
the static transmission of large axial stresses onto chains, 
the balancing of ensuing irregularities of stress distribution, and thus 
the widespread attainment of critical chain stresses before macroscopic break 
down. 
In recent years ultra-high modulus fibers with draw ratios up to 35 have received 
increased attention [180-182]. Their highly extended chain structure and their ex-
treme mechanical properties (elastic modulus E up to 67 GN m- 2 , ab up to 1.7 GN 
m-2) have been discussed in 2IC, and the techniques for their processing (drawing, 
hydrostatic extrusion, solution spinning) are outlined by Bigg [180]. As yet there 
is no information on the extent of chain breakage during drawing or stressing of these 
fibers. Capaccio et al. [181] point out that in very highly drawn PE (A. = 30) much 
finer fibrils are present and these are characterized by an amazingly high concentra-
tion of longitudinal discontinuities in the form of microfibril ruptures. Molecular 
defects (chain ends, folds) are certainly present in extended chain crystals - but not 
in quantities indicating major chain breakages during processing [180-182]. 
With the exception of PC non-oriented amorphous polymers have not given rise 
to measurable quantities of broken chains during yielding in tension. This behavior 
is the result of their different morphology. In the absence of crystallites, large axial 
rorces leading to chain scission can only be caused by frictional loading of slipping 
chain segments. The volume concentration of chain breakages (because of the larger 
size of the slipping segments) is predictably much smaller than in semicrystalline 
polymers. In addition (and because of the absence of the equalizing effect of a 
microfibrillar substructure) macroscopic tensile failure begins before stresses and 
strains have reached a level sufficient for widespread chain scission. 
During necking or homogeneous drawing of many (transparent) polymers an 
intensive whitening is observed. The origin of this phenomenon are voids which are 
either formed in a correlated manner within crazes (cf. 9 II) or within shear bands 
or which appear in an uncorrelated manner within the deforming volume elements. 
Uncorrelated voids form in semicrystalline polymers (PE, PP) as well as in amorphous 
ones (PVC) and in elastomers at cryogenic temperatures (BR, PI). Figure 8.45 shows 
an electron micrograph of a cross-section through the voided area which appeared 
during necking of a dry PA 6 monofilament [83]. The fact that the voiding starts in 
the center of the necking region and in dry monofilaments only, indicates that it is 
related to a triaxial state of stress. The coalescence of such voids may give rise to the 
234

amide monofilament (Courtesy H. Hendus, (831). Magnification 4800 x. 
fibrillar fracture shown in Figure 8.22 [83]. From the triaxiality of the initiating 
stresses and from the absence of measurable intensities of free radicals in slightly 
drawn isotropic polymers (A < 3), from the absence of conspicuous molecular weight 
changes [179,220], and from the reversibility of the formation of holes it must be 
concluded that the hole formation depends more on conformational rearrangements 
of chains and on surface free energy than on the breakage of chains. 
The material behavior described above referred mainly to uniaxial tensile defor-
mation. It will be different in techniques of working or forming of polymeric mate-
rials, such as rolling, sawing or grinding. These processes involve compressive, tensile, 
and shear deformation in a generally complex manner. Breakage of chains has been 
observed in various ways. In 6IV Band 7IC3 a detailed account of the nature and 
concentration of free radicals formed in comminution has been given. Other me-
chano-chemical aspects will be discussed in 9 III D. 
E. Elastomers 
It is evident that the role of highly coiled, loosely interacting but permanently cross-
linked chain backbones in the rupture of elastomeric materials must be quite different 
from the role of chains in thermoplastics. The basic principles and notations of rub-
ber elasticity have been presented in Chapter 2 (Section IIA), different fracture 
models in Chapter 3, and a discussion of the entropy-elastic deformation of a single 
chain in Chapter 5 (Section IA). If one speaks of a "chain" in relation to a filled 
and cross-linked polymer network one refers, of course, to the part of a molecule 
between adjacent points of attachment (filler particle or cross-link). Thus chain rup-
ture refers to the breaking of a chain at or between these points. It has been proposed 
by Mullins [183] some thirty years ago (and has since been known as Mullins effect) 
that the breakage of chains in a first loading cycle is responsible for the softening ob-
servable in subsequent load cycles. In that respect the phenomenology of the Mullins 
effect is comparable to that of the breakage of chains in the stretching of fibers. 
235 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
The values of the entropy-elastic forces acting on highly extended 5-nm chain 
segments (cf. Table 5.2) indicate that they are by more than one order of magnitude 
too small to cause main chain bond breakage. For a chain of 125.5 nm length break-
ing stresses are reached if the chain is extended to an end-to-end distance of 124.7 nm 
which corresponds to a stretch ratio A. of 18. Rupture of most technically important 
elastomers takes place, however, at stretch ratios A. smaller than 8 [183-195]. As 
shown in Figure 3.6 and indicated in the literature the reduced ultimate stresses ub 
plotted versus elongation A.b form a failure envelope. The elongation to break A.b is 
shifted along the failure envelope (towards larger elongations) if the temperature 
and/ or the degree of cross-linking decrease or if the strain rate increases [183 -19 5]. 
The macroscopic breaking stresses ub are of the order of 1 to 30 MN m -2 (depend-
ing on degree of filling or cross-linking), they decrease with increasing time-to-failure 
and degree of swelling. 
From these observations it has been quite unanimously concluded that an aver-
age network chain influences the deformation and breakdown of a stretched rubber 
in several ways: 
the originally random chain conformation changes to a more extended one at a 
rate determined by strain, temperature, and internal viscosity, 
in highly cross-linked or filled rubbers numerous (of the shortest) network chains 
have been completely extended and broken at the fracture elongation (cf. 7 II), 
additional physical cross-links are introduced through crystallization at high 
elongations, 
voids or cavities can be formed due to non-homogeneous distribution of strains 
in filled or unfilled elastomers, 
the limits of extensibility are reached once the majority of the network chains 
has reached a highly extended conformation. In the case of a homogeneously 
cross-linked network with n random links per network chain the largest breaking 
elongation A.b max will approach Vn. At that strain all chains oriented in stretch-
ing direction are fully extended (cf. 5 I A). 
Studying the influence of the aforementioned parameters on the load bearing 
capability of elastomeric networks one may say that forces are transmitted 
through the entropy-elastic deformation of network chains between cross-
linking points, 
in the case of highly extended chains through their energy-elastic deformation 
(cf. 5 I), 
through shearing forces between segments. 
The first mode of load transfer prevails in the rubber-elastic time-temperature 
region, and the third at very low temperatures [190]. 
For the breakdown of a stressed rubber two basic mechanisms are conceivable: 
the initiation and growth of a cavity in a moderately strained matrix or the accelerat-
ing, cooperative rupture of interconnected, highly loaded network chains. It has 
generally been concluded that the second mechanism is of dominating importance 
under experimental conditions, permitting the largest breaking elongation A.b max to 
be attained [187, 192, 194, 195]. For a network with chains extended in loading 
direction a dependence of A.b max on the inverse square root of the cross-link density 
lle is predicted. In experiment A.b max was found to be proportional to (lle)-O.5 to 
236 

III. Environmental Degradation 
(Ve)-U.78 for a variety of networks (Butyl, BR, EPR, SBR, SI, fluorinated rubber). 
Smith [187] concludes that the maximum elongation Abrnax is the only feature of 
large deformation behavior which clearly depends only on network topology. 
At ultimate strains which are smaller than Abmax some chains are already highly 
extended but their number is insufficient for cooperative accelerating breakdown. 
It is the general opinion that under such experimental conditions the final break-
down occurs through formation and growth of cavities [184,185, 190]. It will not 
be further investigated at this point to what extent chain scission may accompany 
cacity formation and growth. It may be stated, however, that the chain scission 
mechanism does not determine the rate of cavity formation. 
As a final point it should be emphasized that elastomeric materials are showing 
a higher strength if they exhibit a multiphase microstructure [183, 184, 186, 188, 
195]. This may be achieved by incorporation of suitable filler materials (carbon 
black, silica); by crystallization under strain, or by blending or copolymerization 
with an incompatible polymer. The possible role of chain orientation, loading, and 
scission in these cases has been discussed in 7 II. 
III. Environmental Degradation 
Within the framework of this book the effect of thermomechanical chain scission on 
the mechanical properties of polymers are to be investigated. Up to this point it has 
been tried, therefore, to separate and exclude environmental effects whenever pos-
sible. In many cases it was tacitly assumed that the variables investigated (e.g. strain, 
stress, temperature, sample morphology, free radical concentration) had been the 
dominating variables in comparison to e.g. humidity, oxygen content, chemical at-
tack, or effects of irradiation. It goes without saying that these environmental fac-
tors are of extreme importance to the service lives of polymer engineering compo-
nents. A considerable number of comprehensive recent monographs and handbook 
articles treat the environmental degradation of polymers (e.g. [196-203 D. They 
deal in depth with those aspects of environmental degradation which cannot be dis-
cussed any further at this point: thermal degradation, fire and heat stability, chemical 
degradation, weathering, aging, moisture sensitivity, effects of electromagnetic and 
particle irradiation, cavitation and rain erosion, and biological degradation. For any 
detailed information on the above subjects and on methods and agents to protect 
and stabilize polymeric materials the reader is referred to the cited comprehensive 
references [196-203,207 -209]. 
It mainly remains to be discussed in this section the nature of the effect which 
the simu ltaneou s action of mechanical and environmental parameters may have on 
mechanical properties. One of the most interesting phenomena in this field, the 
environmental stress crazing (ESC), will be treated in the final chapter. 
A characteristic stress-induced degradation process is that of unsaturated rub-
bers in the presence of ozone. The rates of crack initiation and growth, of forma-
tion of free radicals, and of stress relaxation and creep are amplified up to and more 
than a thousandfold by the action of ozone [196-197,199,201,204-206]. The 
chemical reaction is not completely understood. It is normally assumed that the 
237 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
first steps of ozone degradation of unsaturated polymers follow the "Criegee me-
chanism". 
Under the effect of molecular ozone the 1T-bonds of olefines are polarized and 
ozone joins the double bonds to form primary ozonides [196, 197a]. Primary ozonides, 
-CH - CH-, are unstable, they either isomerize into iso-ozonide, -HC - 0 - CH-, 
~ 
o-if 
or polymerize, or decompose into chains terminated by a zwitterion, Rl COO-; and 
a carbonyl group, R2 CO, respectively. If a bond attacked by ozone is under stress, de-
composition can occur during the isomerization reation. 
The reaction with ozone obviously is a surface reaction leading to the formation 
of a surface layer of ozonides and/or further reaction products. This layer grows in 
thickness in proportion to the square root of the time of exposure [199]. With in-
creasing layer thickness ozone is gradially prevented from reaching undegraded rub-
ber. The mechanical aspects of ozone cracking are extensively reviewed in the cited 
articles [196-197,199,201, 204-206]. It is unanimously reported that the degraded 
rubber material (natural rubber, SBR, acrylonitrile-butadiene, cis-polybutadiene) has 
a reduced strength and elasticity. Cracks open up and propagate at strains as low as 
5 to 12%; it has been estimated [199] that even at the tip of a slowly propagating 
crack strains do not exceed 30% (as compared with 700% in an undegraded matrix). 
As a consequence of the chemical destruction of the material at the tip of a crack the 
mechanical energy expended in crack propagation (material resistance R) is exceed-
ingly small. Employing the Griffith fracture criterion the various authors have ob-
tained values of 0.05 to 0.12 J/m2 from observation of macroscopic cracks [197a, 
199a, 204, 205] or of 0.4 to 0.5 J/m2 from micromorphological theories [206]. 
The formation of free radicals in unsaturated rubbers under simultaneous attack 
of ozone and stress is of particular interest. The primary steps of the above described 
reaction of ozone with unsaturated bonds do not lead to free radicals. In cis-poly-
butadiene (BR), natural rubber (NR), and acrylonitrile-butadiene (ABR), however, 
large quantities of peroxy radicals have been observed [206,208]. As one possibility 
it was pointed out that these radicals may derive from the ozonides or zwitterions 
through unknown secondary steps pOSSibly involving hydrogen abstraction or proton 
migration [197, 206, 208]. Another possibility certainly is that radicals are formed 
through scission of undegraded rubber molecules and that these primary radicals react 
with molecular oxygen. In BR and ABR the concentration of free radicals has shown 
the same dependency on strain and ozone concentration as the visual damage, i.e. 
the ozone cracking of the surface of the degrading rubber specimen. Notably the 
following observations may be mentioned [206, 208]: 
no (detectable quantities of) lree radicals are formed below certain threshold 
strains (of between 5 and 12%) 
for strains beyond the threshold strain the rate of increase in free radical concen-
tration increases initially linearly with strain and ozone concentration (in the range 
of 0.08 to 1.6 mg/l) 
-
increasing strain or ozone concentration lead to a preferential increase in number 
rather than size of microcracks. 
238 

III. Environmental Degradation 
The number of free radicals (up to 8 . 1014 spins per cm2 rubber surface) cor-
responds at a given ozone concentration of 2.8 mg/l to the number of ozone molecules 
in a zone of surrounding atmosphere of 0.02 cm depth. This number is very much 
smaller than the total number of ozone molecules available in the ambient atmos-
phere of the degraded specimens. The linear dependency of radical concentration 
on ozone concentration and strain, therefore, means that potential radical sites are 
created only after the application of stress and in the presence of ozone molecules. 
The appearance of free radicals simultaneously with crack opening certainly indi-
cates the breakage of chains during the process of crack opening. In Section I E of 
this chapter an analysis of the energy content of an unsevered hydrocarbon chain 
strained elastically up to chain scission had been carried out. This analysis leads to 
the estimate that the 2 . 1014 chains per cm2 of new fracture surface can only be 
broken elastically if more than 91/m2 were expended in forming that surface. Since 
the observed surface work parameters are much smaller one has to conclude that 
under ozone attack the breaking and radical forming chains break at small strains. 
This interpretation looks identical to that derived from analysis of the behavior of 
ozone cracks. Its importance lies in the statement, however, that during crack open-
ing chains (of very low strength) are broken and not only broken chains are separated. 
The breakage of ozone attacked chains is a conspicuous example of the syner-
gistic effect of the simultaneous action of mechanical and environmental parameters. 
There are many other environmental parameters (e.g. moisture or oxygen content) 
which have an accelerating effect in a given situation [196-203]. Of these observa-
tions only a few will be discussed here namely the ones which characterize respec-
tively the chemical aging of stressed rubbers [209c-21 0], the role of moisture in 
fatigue of PA 66 and PC [211-212], and the accelerating effect of UV irradiation 
on sub micro crack formation and breakdown of highly oriented polymers [74, 
213-214]. 
The oxidative degradation of polymers has been recognized and studied for quite 
some time (cf. the extensive review 209a). Most investigations in this field deal with 
the effect of degradation on the properties of polymers (e.g. 189,202, 203, 207, 
20ge) or with an elucidation of the nature and kinetics of the intervening reactions 
[200,201,207,208, 209a-d]. As one of the first Kim [210] also searched for a 
possible stress effect on the rate of chain degradation [209d, 210]. She employed a 
constant-load technique which permitted to derive the relative number of network 
chains, N(t)/N(O), by comparing the Mooney-Rivlin plot, ao/(A.-1/"),2), of an aging 
sample with that of a fresh sample. Her interesting results may be summarized as 
follows: 
The creep rate of polybutadiene rubber films loaded in ambient atmosphere was 
about a thousandfold larger than the creep rate under dry nitrogen. 
A comparison of the relative potency of the chemical agents present in the ambient 
atmosphere showed that the few parts per hundred million of naturally occurring 
ozone had a much stronger effect than the oxygen. 
In ozone-containing air a behavior comparable to that described above for higher 
ozone concentrations had been found. A critical stress of 0.1 MN m -2 had to be 
exceeded in order to influence the initial creep rate. The (initial) rates of chain 
cleavage dN(t)/N(O)dt were found to be independent of stress within a stress range 
239 

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
of 0.1 < 00 < 0.5 MN m-2 and amounted to 2 . 10-6 S-I. This phenomenon was 
explained in the same way as for higher ozone concentrations through formation 
and cracking of a degraded surface layer. Microscopical investigations of the sample 
surface confirmed such a statement. 
-
In the absence of ozone the rates of creep and chain scission were greatly reduced. 
The effect of oxygen at room temperature was small and hardly any differences 
between creep rates in dry nitrogen, dry air without ozone, and ozone-free air of 
40% relative humidity had been observed. At slightly higher temperatures (49°C), 
however, creep rates in dry air accelerated whereas those in inert atmosphere 
(Argon) remained constant. 
-
From her experiments Kim concludes that in the initial phase of degradation in 
ozone-free oxygen stress or strain have no effect on the rate of chain cleavage. 
After the chemical degradation had reached a stage, however, where cracks 
opened up under stress, the straining of a sample accelerated the failure process 
of the specimen through stress concentration and change in cross-linking behav-
ior [210]. 
The general effect of cross-link density on the elastic modulus of an elastomer 
is indicated by Eq. 2.3. In their paper Landel and Fedors [189] consider the in-
fluence of a time-dependent cross-link density on the shape of the stress-strain 
curves of silicon, butyl, natural, and fluorinated rubbers. Introducing an additional 
shift-factor ax related to the cross-link density, they were able to represent reduced 
breaking stresses as a function of reduced time in one common master curve. 
Thermal and chemical degradation of cross-linked rubbers was also reviewed by 
Murakami [209c] who especially analyzed whether cleavage occurs along main chains 
or at cross-links. Depending on the nature of the chain and on that of the cross-links 
both mechanisms are observed. Natural rubber, radiation cross-linked to various 
degrees, showed at 20% strain and at temperatures of 80 to 130°C random scission 
of network chains. An EPT rubber cross-linked by tetramethyl thiuram disulfide 
(TMTD) showed degradation at the junction points of network chains. There the S 
and S2 linkages seemed to be preferred scission points. In TMTD-cured natural 
rubber both types of degradation occur simultaneously. The dependency of the 
stress relaxation curves on time, temperature, and initial cross-link density permitted 
discrimination between thermal and oxidative degradation. For differently cured 
natural rubber (peroxide-, irradiation-, TMTD-, and sulfur-cured) Murakami [209c] 
has tabulated the degradation mechanisms. 
The accelerating effect of mechanical stresses on chemical stress relaxation 
clearly became apparent through the comparison of continuous and intermittent 
stress relaxation. The relative stress relaxation, 1-0 (t, )0...)/0 (0, )0...), under continuous 
loading was the more pronounced the higher )0... and always consistently larger than 
under intermittent load application. Murakami [209c] also discussed possible increases 
of relative stresses due to cross-linking reactions and their partial prevention through 
radical acceptors. 
With respect to the general effect of an active liquid environment on a polymer 
reference to the literature must be made [196-199]. This applies especially to 
quantitative data concerning the reduction in strength accompanying the swelling 
or plasticization of a material. The penetration of low molecular weight molecules 
240 

III. Environmental Degradation 
into a polymer generally reduces the intermolecular attraction and facilitates chain 
slippage. In the case of hydrogen-bonded materials the possible interaction of the 
diffUSing liquid with the hydrogen bonds has to be considered. 
In a series of experiments Hearle et al. [211] studied the effect of air, water, 
hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, and a laundering detergent on the strength 
and fatigue of PA-66 fibers. Their results confirm that the breaking strength of a 
PA-66 fiber immediately after immersion in water is 5% smaller than that in air. 
Pre-conditioning by immersion for 3 hours causes an additional strength reduction 
of 3%. Immersion in aqueous solutions of NaOH and HCI with ph-values larger than 
2.5 has an effect similar to that of water. In the range of ph-values between 2 and 0, 
however, strength decreases linearly with decreasing ph up to a strength loss of 20%. 
Notable is the observation that the pre-conditioning of fibers before making a 
fatigue test (by rotation over a wire) does not have such a great effect on the 
fatigue life. This may be explained by the fact that the slow growth rates of a 
fatigue crack starting from the surface permit the environmental agent to always 
penetrate the crack growth region [211]. 
The partial penetration of a liquid or vapor into a matrix establishes concen-
tration gradients which do lead to a direct mechanical action through non-uni-
form swelling or to indirect actions through the nonhomogeneous relaxation or 
distribution of stresses. These actions are even enhanced in the presence of ther-
mal gradients and may cause rapid crack or craze formation. In the case of a slowly 
penetrating environment in a well entangled, homogeneous matrix the induced stresses 
generally can be accommodated elastically or viscoelastically. For example in poly-
carbonate sheets exposed to artificial weathering no cracking becomes apparent even 
after severe cycling of temperature and humidity [212]. Within a relatively short 
period of 30 to 32 months of outdoor weathering, however, a network of surface 
microcracks developed on the side exposed to the solar radiation. By comparison 
with artificial UV irradiation the authors [212] were able to show that the photo-
chemical degradation of the surface layer introduces defects and lowers the strength 
of the polymeric material to such an extent that physically induced non-homoge-
neous stresses cause micro cracking rather than being accommodated. The effect of 
liquid environment on crack or craze formation will be further discussed in 9 IID. 
Photo-chemical degradation is probably the most important factor of environ-
ment. The cited monographs [196-203, 207-209] treat in detail the primary pro-
cesses of photon ab sorption, electron excitation, energy transfer through excitons, 
luminescence, phosophorescence, and raditionless transitions, chain scission and free 
radical formation, secondary reactions, stabilization and protection, and the effect 
of irradiation on the mechanical properties. Here only one point can be touched: 
the accelerating effect of UV radiation on micro crack formation in loaded polymers 
[74,213-214]. 
As indicated by Tables 4.4 and 4.5 photon energy in the spectral range of 
250 < A < 360 nm is larger than the dissociation energy of C-C bonds. The high 
energy tail of solar radiation extends to about A = 300 nm. Chain scission in UVand 
solar light is, therefore, energetically possible. In the near UV in unprotected glassy 
polymers quantum yields of the order of 1 . 10-3 to 60 . 10-3 are observed [209b].

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
The principle mechanisms of the synergistic action of load and UV radiation 
may be discussed using the few data available. The simultaneous application of ten-
sile load and UV irradiation to oriented polymers clearly accelerated the formation 
of free radicals and/or of micro and macro cracks in PA 6 [213-214] and in natural 
silk, cotton, and "triacetate" fibers [213]. No effect was observed in PMMA [213]. 
The experiments on cotton and triacetate fibers revealed that at low tensile stresses 
(uo < 70 MN m -2) the UV irradiation reduced the lifetimes of the fibers by more 
than 4 orders of magnitude. Under these conditions the absence or presence of 
oxygen was of some, but minor, importance since the irradiation in vacuum led to 
only slightly longer lifetimes than the irradiation in air. In a range of stresses with 
70 < Uo < 220 MN m -2 no oxygen effect on the lifetime of triacetate fibers became 
apparent. In this stress range the irradiation effect decreased with increasing uo. For 
Uo > 220 MN m-2 the lifetime depended only on stress and not on the environ-
mental factors UV irradiation and oxygen content. With cotton fibers a somewhat 
similar behavior was observed although the upper stress limit was smaller and de-
pended on absence or presence of air [213]. The described behavior points to the 
existence of three failure mechanisms which are occurring simultaneously and at 
different rates: oxydation, UV degradation, and creep. An effect of oxydation was 
observed for the acetate fibers only at lifetimes tb > 5 . 103 s and in the presence of 
UV radiation. At shorter lifetimes, 100 < tb < 5 . 103 s, failure was essentially due 
to irradiation. At very short lifetimes (and higher stresses) oxydation and UV degrada-
tion were irrelevant if compared to the stress effect. 
The determination by X-ray scattering of the number of microcracks in a PA-6 
fiber stressed in air at 128 MN m-2 gave the notable result [214] that the rate of 
micro crack accumulation increased almost instantaneously (from 5 . 1016 m-3 S-1 
to 110· 1016 m-3 s-l) with the application of UV irradiation. The rate decreased 
to its initial value in the same abrupt and repeatable manner when UV was switched 
off after 104 s. Irradiation of an unstressed sample did not cause any micro crack 
formation and did not influence subsequent formation rates. In a previous study 
[213] it had been shown that UV irradiation of stressed PA-6 and natural silk fibers 
in a helium atmosphere increased the accumulation of free radicals. In that case the 
rate of radical accumulation at 200 < Uo < 600 MN m-2 decreased with the length 
of the time of irradiation and reached a steady state concentration NCR) after 
5 . 103 s. In PA 6 at a stress of 600 MN m -2 the concentration NCR) was of the 
order of 1024 m- 3; this is about the limiting concentration observed in purely stress-
induced chain scission also. 
From these results the following conclusions can be derived. The photodegrada-
tion of unstressed PA 6 in air most probably is a random oxidative chain scission 
process [215]. Based on a study of the formed ESR spectra Heuvel et al. [216] con-
cluded that amide bonds in the amorphous regions are broken leading to R-CO and 
NH-R' free radicals. Subramanian et al. [215] propose formation ofhydroperox-
ides and keto-intermediates at the a-CH2 group and a subsequent hydrolytic break-
down at the RCO-NHCOR' bond. It must be assumed that in PA-6 in air under the 
combined action of UV and stress all chain segments in the amorphous regions are 
possible fracture sites and not only the most highly stressed ones. The rates of chain 
degradation and cross-linking may depend on chain stress through the mechanisms 
242

discussed below. In the absence of oxygen, UV irradiation accelerated the breakage 
of chains but did show a saturation at a concentration N(R). This result can be 
explained if one assumes that in irradiated and stressed PA 6 preferentially those 
chains are broken and are prevented from recombination which are most highly 
stressed. 
Several mechanisms are conceivable through which the UV degradation of highly 
extended and stressed chains would be facilitated. In the first place the decrease of 
bond dissociation energies through electronic excitation and tensile stress has to be 
mentioned (cf.4UB). In the case of ionized hydrocarbon chains, bond dissociation 
energies are as small as 100 kJ/mol (Table 4.6). As outlined in Chapter 7 bonds of 
such energy require rather small stresses for breakage (about 1 14 to 1 15 of the 
strength of a non-ionized chain). In addition to the reduction of the dissociation 
energy an increase in local thermal excitation - due to energy transfer or dissipa-
tion - may have an effect. Chain orientation and segment conformation also 
influence the effective stability of a chain. Very little is being said in the literature 
about the relation between molecular order and UV resistance. Reinisch et al. [217] 
investigated the influence of sample orientation on photo-chemical degradation. 
They found that highly drawn PA-6 fibers (A. = 3.9) had an even higher degradation 
resistance than undrawn material. Krlissmann et al. [218] indicate that the reactivity 
(in photo oxidation) of N-vicinal methylen groups in trans conformation is 60 times 
that of those in gauche conformation. These data [213-218] were obtained for 
quite different specimens and experimental conditions. They do not yet permit a 
quantitative estimate as to the importance and interaction of the above mechanisms. 
Electronic excitation, ionization, radical formation, oxidation, and cross-linking 
are also the principal processes occurring in polymer solids subjected to nuclear 
radiation (a, (3, 'Y, nucleons). In view of the fact that the molecular mobility influences 
the kinetics of degradation and cross-linking a synergistic stress effect is conceivable 
but not yet proven. The current investigations aim at an understanding of the inter-
relation between irradiation characteristics (dosis and dosis rate), network structure, 
and macroscopic properties after irradiation [198, 200, 219].

220: After completion of the manuscript this detailed study of the relation between 
viscometry, ESR, and IR estimates of bond rupture has appeared. The authors report 
that in PE and PP fibers and films very little chain scission can be detected through 
viscometry; the number of broken bonds, N(vis), was 0.4 '1016 to 5 '1016 cm-3. 
N(vis) is by a factor of 1000 smaller than the elsewhere reported IR end-group con-

8. The Role of Chain Scission in Homogeneous Deformation and Fracture 
centrations. Virtually no change of M was observed in cold drawing of a PA 6 mono-
filament whereas the viscosity-average molecular weight of PA 6, PA 66, and PETP 
fibers decreased measurably during loading to fracture. Evaluating their viscosity and 
ESR measurements the authors concluded that N(vis) and N(ESR) are of the same 
order, if nonrandom scission prevails. In the case of random scission a number 
N(vis) of broken bonds was derived from viscometry which was by a factor of 6 to 
20 larger than the value N(ESR) obtained from the intensity of the ESR spectra. 
Observing opposite influences of an annealing treatment of PA 6 fibers on micro-
crack formation and free radical intensity the authors question the close correlation 
between microcrack formation and bond rupture.

In Chapter 8 principally the contribution of spatially homogeneously distributed 
molecular rearrangements to fracture initiation was studied. The term spatially 
homogeneous referred to the absence of flaws, inclusions, cracks, or notches of a 
size sufficient to act as a stress concentrator. Under those conditions during an initial 
phase of external loading damage development or growth is homogeneously distri-
buted on a macroscopic scale. Heterogeneous fracture now is defined as the converse 
of homogeneous fracture or briefly as fracture through crack propagation. In this 
case cracks, notches, inclusions, or accumulated crack nuclei act as macroscopic 
stress concentrations and essentially confine further damage development to the 
close proximity of the then existing defect( s). The phenomenon of crazing has been 
included in this chapter because of the well observable structural irregularities and 
despite the fact that with increasing stress new crazes can be formed at arbitrary 
nucleation sites. 
The development of fracture through cracks will be treated in this chapter fol-
lowing the fracture mechanics approach. In view of the extensive, competent, and 
recent literature on this subject prime attention will be given to the effect of chain 
properties (length, structure, strength) on crack propagation and on fracture me-
chanics parameters.

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
I. Fracture Mechanics 
A. Stress Concentration 
In Section III B of Chapter 3 Griffith's early considerations [(2)] were outlined. From 
the balance of elastically stored energy (U) and energy to produce new surface area 
('YcA) Griffith derived his well-known fracture criterion for isotropic materials con-
taining an elliptical crack oflength 2a (Eq. 3.13). In the last 50 years this fracture 
mechanics approach has been systematically developed to account for partially an-
elastic and/or plastic behavior of solids for various crack and sample geometries, and 
even for material heterogeneities: In all cases it has been - and still is - the aim of 
the fracture mechanics analysis to derive generally valid quantitative criteria for 
crack stability and crack propagation behavior. Criteria are being sought which are 
as much independent of the state of external and internal stresses and of crack and 
sample geometry as possible and which depend principally on material functions such 
as material resistance R (Ri~ausbreitungswiderstand), critical stress intensity factor 
Kc (kritischer Spannungsintensitatsfaktor), and elastic modulus E. 
A detailed account of the development and of the present state of the theory of 
fracture mechanics is given in the series Mechanics of Fracture [2]. From the extensive 
general literature on this subject only a few works may be cited which deal with the 
deformation and fracture of engineering materials [3] or specifically polymers [4-6] 
and standards [7, 8]. For the determination of the material functions R and Kc three 
experimental methods of controlled crack propagation are predominantly used 
(Fig. 9.1): 
Mode I, crack opening or tensile mode (einfache RiMffnung) 
Mode II, sliding or in-plane shear mode 
Mode III, tearing or antiplane shear mode. 
F or details of these methods, their evaluation, and possible influences of sample 
geometry on the resulting "material" functions the reader is referred to the general 
literature cited [2-8]. In this Section the most frequently used crack opening mode, 
namely mode (I), will be considered (Figs. 9.1 and 9.2). 
For a uniaxially stressed isotropic, elastic, thin plate containing an infinitely 
sharp edge crack a state of plane stress arises which has a singularity at the crack tip 
[3-8], for r ~a the components of stress are expressed as 
Mode I 
Mode II 
Mode III 
Fig. 9.1. Experimentally used modes of controlled crack propagation: I crack opening or tensile 
mode, II sliding or in-plane shear mode, III tearing or anti-plane shear mode.

The coordinates rand ¢ are indicated in Figure 9.1. The quantity Kr determines 
the intensity of the stress field without affecting its shape. It is accordingly termed 
stress intensity factor. The stress intensity factor takes into account both the external 
(uniaxial) stress 00 and the crack length a: 
Kr = oo..;;ra . f(alb) 
(9.4) 
where f(alb) is a correction factor of the order of unity which derives from the finite 
specimen dimensions and crack configuration [3-8]. The stress intensity factor can 
be considered a much more general measure of the criticality of the state of a stressed, 
cracked plate than 00 or a individually. 
In the case of a thick plate the lateral contraction of the material at the crack tip 
is hindered; a state of plane strain prevails and in addition to Ox and Oy a normal 
stress 0 z exists: 
(9.5) 
In plane strain and for r <{ a the components of displacement in the x -direction 
(u) and the y-direction (v) are obtained [6] as:

Whereas the stresses show a singularity for r -+ 0 the displacements go to zero. 
Through the introduction of a crack into a (thick) plate under constant uniaxial stress 
00 the elastically stored energy in the vicinity of the crack tip is increased by the 
finite amount W: 
(9.9) 
Concurrently work 2 W is expended by the external system to maintain the uni-
axial stress 00' The total elastic energy Ue decreases, therefore, by W. This apparent 
paradox was pointed out by Eshelby [9]. If the crack is extended by b.a then the 
stress field is shifted by b.a in the x-direction and its energy content increased by 
oW/oa; an energy increment of the same magnitude is set free by the stress release 
accompanying the failure of the highly stressed crack tip material. It is the latter 
energy increment which is termed energy release rate G1: 
G1 = - aUe = 7ra 05 (1 _ v2) f(alb).

E(T, t) 
(9.10) 
For a thin plate (state of plane stress) the terms (1 + v2 ) and (1 - v2 ) in Eqs. (9.6) 
to (9.10) have to be replaced by unity. In view of the discussion later it is important 
to determine how the energy G1 is distributed around the crack tip. Following Irwin 
[10] the elastic strain energy within a cylinder of radius rl around the crack tip is 
(per unit of plate thickness):

(9.11) 
Whereas the energy content W(rd increases proportionally to rl the local energy 
density w(r) decreases as 1/r; for large distances from the crack tip it attains Wo = 
OS/2 E, the strain energy density of an isotropic, elastic solid. From Figure 9.3 it is 
readily seen that increasing a by b.a = r 1 sets free an amount of stored energy G1 b.a 
which is a factor of (8 - 8 v)/(5 - 8 v) larger than the elastic energy stored within a 
cylinder of radius rl around the crack tip. This ratio is independent of the absolute 
value of r 1 . In other words any crack propagation step in an ideal elastic material -
even the smallest - releases elastic energy in a material volume several times larger 
than that immediately surrounding the crack tip (volume 7rb.a2B). Experimentally 
it is seen that a triangular zone bounded by a plane connecting the crack tip with the 
lateral face is unloaded. Increasing a requires in any event the breakage of primary 
and/or secondary bonds and thus energy, say Bb.a'Yc. In order to obtain a strict 
correspondence between Bb.a'Yc and Bb.aG1 one would require that the total of the

elastic energy stored in the contributing volume region be used for the separation of 
bonds traversing BLla. For polymeric solids the smallest conceivable step would be 
the scission of a single bond, i.e. a step width of Lla = 0.4 nm. The activation volume 
for bond scission is of the order of (j = 0.008 nm3 . Such a volume element constitutes 
only a fraction 0.125/1T of 1TLla3 and contains about 0.015 of GILla2 • It must be 
noted, therefore, that on a molecular scale - even in the absence of plastic deforma-
tion - fracture propagation requires the release of energy from a volume at least 60 
times larger than the activation volume for breakage of primary bonds across the 
newly formed surface area BLla. 
Propagation of a crack occurs if the energy release rate GI is sufficient to account 
for the material resistance R, i.e. for all modes of energy consumption related to the 
propagating crack. The condition for crack growth is written, therefore, as 
GI(a, t) ~ R(a, t). 
(9.12) 
At low crack propagation rates kinetic energy terms in R can be neglected. 
Then the material resistance will include the specific surface energy 2 r (to overcome 
the cohesion of atoms or molecules across the newly formed surface area), and the 
energy terms V re of elastic retraction of stressed molecules, V pI of plastic deforma-
tion, and V ch of chemical reactions including bond scission. The release of internal 
stresses (Ui) or chemical reactions with the environment (Uch) may subtract from R: 
R=2r+ oVre + OVPI+ OVCh+ ... _[OUi + OUCh].

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
In general - and especially with polymeric materials - R will be a function of 
crack length, specimen geometry, and extent and rate of plastic deformation at the 
crack tip. A schematic representation of an R(a) of a ductile, strain hardening 
material is given in Figure 9.4. A crack ao grows if Gr (ao) > R(ao); if G1 (ao) = R(ao) 
it continues to grow if the slope of the line GI(a), i.e. 3Gj3a, is larger than the change 
of material resistance with crack length, 3Rj3a. For an arbitrary energy release rate 
GI with R(ao) < GI(ao) < Gc(ao) crack stability will again be achieved at a new 
value at >ao where G(a) intersects R(a) (cf. Fig. 9.4). If, however, GI(a) is equal to 
0 0

Fig. 9.4. Schematic representa-
tion of crack stability in ductile, 
strain-hardening material: 
1. G < R(ao), 2. G(ao) = R(ao), 
3. G(at) < Gc, 4. G = Gc. 
or larger than Gc(a) - which forms the tangent to R(a) - then the rate of energy release 
remains always larger than the material resistance and the crack will grow continually. 
It follows from Figure 9.4 that Gc generally is the larger the larger R(a ~ ao). Since 
R depends most strongly on the plastic energy term 3Vp1!B3a it also depends on the 
size of the volume element which deforms plastically during crack propagation. The 
material resistance R is the smaller, therefore, the more constraint to plastic deforma-
tion exists, i.e. it is smaller in plane strain than in plane stress. Under conditions of 
plane strain Gc approaches a limiting value of GIc which - through Eqs. (9.4) and 
(9.10) - defines a critical value of KI . This critical value, KIc ' is termed fracture 
toughness. For a brittle fracture the numerical value of KIc can generally be deter-
mined from the measurement of crack length and load at the onset of unstable crack 
propagation [3-8]. 
Plastic deformation is especially pronounced in polymeric materials. The electron 
micrographs presented in Chapter 8 provide ample evidence of this fact. It will be 
necessary, therefore, to study whether and how the fracture mechanics approach 
derived for an elastic material can be applied to elastic-plastic solids as well. The 
effect of plastic deformation on the stress distribution at a crack tip is well docu-
mented [3-7]. An elastic-plastic material under quasi-elastic conditions, for instance, 
begins to deform plastically wherever the state of stress meets the yield or flow 
criterion. Plastic deformation begins in the region of largest stresses, i.e. in the prox-
imity of the crack tip; it limits the components of stress to the yield stress of. In 
256 

1. Fracture Mechanics 
order to maintain the mechanical equilibrium stresses must be raised (up to the yield 
stress) in more distant regions. Thus the plastic deformation has the effect of in-
creasing the effective crack length [3-7]. Two common approaches to calculate the 
effective crack enlargement through plastic deformation are based respectively on the 
von Mises yield criterion [6] and on the consideration of aF as an additional com-
pressive stress [7]. 
From the von Mises yield criterion together with Eqs. (9.1) to (9.3) one derives 
the shape of the plastic zone (r < rF) for a state of plane stress as [6]:

In a moderately thick plate one finds a state of plane strain in the center and of 
plane stress at the lateral faces. This leads to the well-known dog-bone shape of the 
plastic zone. 
The Dugdate model [7] recognizes the effect of the plastic deformation in front 
of the crack tip in a different way. It considers a virtual crack which includes the 
plastic zone - of size rp - and it treats the yield stress as a superimposed stress acting 
normally on the boundary between the elastic and the "plastic" zone. The superim-
posed stress tends to bend the surface of the virtual crack. A consideration of me-
chanical equilibrium gives [6, 7]

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
Equations (9.14) to (9.18) do not constitute a fracture criterion since they do 
not specify whether and when material separation in the plastically deformed zone 
occurs. In order to use fracture mechanics to predict the stability of an elastic-plastic 
crack, limits of the plastic deformation have to exist and must be known explicitly 
or implicitly. Understandably the determination, interpretation, and application of 
critical stress intensity factors for viscoelastic solids is particularly complicated due 
to the pronounced time and temperature dependence of the mechanical properties 
of these materials. The fact that a material shows a ductile behavior does not preclude 
the use of fracture mechanics but it reduces - or even eliminates - the independence 
of the fracture mechanics functions (G, K, R) from the geometrical parameters [6]. 
The occurrence of plastic deformation in a material has a threefold effect: 
it limits the elastic energy density to u}/2 E 
it leads to an increase in R (roughly in proportion to the volume of the plastically 
deformed zone) 
it may render uncritical any KI (Le. any Uo and a) unless the extent of plastic de-
formation is limited. 
Following earlier concepts applied to metals the quantitative assessment of the 
contribution of plastic deformation to material resistance R of polymers has made 
considerable progress. Recognizing the difference between an Rl (brittle) observed 
under plane strain and an R2 (plastic) resulting from the plastic deformation under 
plane stress one may rewrite Eq. (9.12) as 
(9.21) 
Formally one may equate R2 with a GC2 ' the "plastic component" of the strain 
energy release rate, and Rl with GCI which should correspond to G1c ' 
It has been indicated that Gc is the smaller the more pronounced the condition 
of plane strain, i.e. the larger the specimen thickness B. At the other extreme of com-
paratively small thicknesses also a dependency of Gc on B is noticed (Fig. 9.5). The

V groove, crack length taken to be equal to visible crack, (d) tapered V groove, plastic zone

258 

I. Fracture Mechanics 
almost linear increase of Gc with B indicates that (in this case of a single groove double 
cantilever beam) the volume of the plastically deformed zone (shear lips) increases in 
proportion to B2. The decrease of Gc due to the beginning mixed mode fracture at 
larger specimen thicknesses just becomes apparent [21]. 
At present several different experimental methods of working in the crack open-
ing mode are employed [7-15]. Flat samples with a single edge notch (SEN) are 
preferentially used under constant load, under slowly increasing strain or under 
cyclic tensile loading. These conditions permit a subcritical crack growth leading 
eventually to instability. To determine the energy release rate Eq. (9.10) can be used 
if the appropriate long-term relaxation modulus E(T, t) is employed. The same is true 
for plates with a central notch (CN), compact tensile (CT) specimens, Charpy notched 
samples in slow bending, and wedge open loaded (WOL) plates at small loading rates. 
In shock loading the short-time moduli are relevant to describe the energy release 
rate of pre-cracked samples; crack instability is reached primarily because of the in-
creasing stresses and at unchanged crack length. The contribution of thermally acti-
vated crack growth to an increase of KI is, therefore, negligible (the situation is dif-
ferent, though, with uncracked samples and flaws of molecular dimensions as has 
been shown in Chapter 8). 
The WOL and the double-cantilever beam (DCB) specimens are suitable to deter-
mine the arrest of an initially unstable crack; the double-torsion (DT) specimen per-
mits the investigation of crack propagation under constant KI [7-15]. 
Values of various types of energy release rates G and of fracture toughness values 
K of polymeric materials have been gathered from the literature [12-75] and are 
compiled in Table 9.1. Although the experimental method and the principal para-
meters and observations have also been indicated in Table 9.1, a discussion of some 
molecular aspects will be attempted in the following. 
B. Subcritical Crack Growth 
The Griffith concept of an energy balance (G = R) furnishes a criterion of instan-
taneous stability (G < R) or instability (G > R, crack propagation). It does not 
explicitely contain time as a variable. It has been pointed out above, however, that 
G depends on t through E(t) and R depends on t predominantly through the plastic 
energy dissipation term. The larger G, the rate of release of provided elastic energy, 
the larger d, the rate of crack propagation. The opposite is not always true; thus 
material resistances determined in bending, tension, or tearing may decrease with 
the rate of deformation [17, 20-25, 35-37, 57]. 
In many polymeric materials three zones of crack propagation behavior can be 
distinguished: 
no crack growth at G < Gi 
(stable crack) 
slow crack growth at Gi < G < G1c 
(subcritical crack growth) 
rapid crack propagation at G ~ Glc .

I. Fracture Mechanics 
This behavior is especially well demonstrated by PMMA. In Figure 9.6 the data 
of Doll [30] are represented. 
The slow subcritical crack growth in a polymer is due to thermomechanically 
activated processes of the same nature as described in the last chapter for the homo-
geneous fracture, i.e. chain stretching, plastic deformation, void opening, chain dis-
entanglement, and chain scission. The rate with which these processes occur is, how-
ever, in the strain field surrounding a crack tip larger than elsewhere in the material.

The growth rate d in the subcritical region seems to be determined by K1. (In 
subcritical crack growth any imposed KI corresponds per definitionem to the Kc for 
crack growth at the observed speed.) Several relations between KI and a have been 
established. One of these has been found to describe the sub critical crack growth of 
a number of polymers [3, 12, 13]: 
d=AK~ 
(9.22) 
with A and b being empirical constants, depending on material, environment, tem-
perature, etc. The constant b has been related to l/tan 0 of the {3 relaxation [12]. 
The subcritical crack growth data obtained by several investigators [12-15] for 
PMMA have been compiled in Figure 9.7. The double-logarithmic plot reveals an 
extended linear section (growth rates d from 10-8 to 10-2 m/s for stress intensity 
factors from 0.8 to 1.4 MN m -3/2). 
For this linear portion the exponent bin Eq. (9.22) can be determined to be 
25 ± 2 [13]. 
From Eqs. (9.22) and (9.4) one can determine the time .l t necessary for the 
growth of a crack a 1 to length a2. Neglecting here and in the following f(alb) one

data from ref. 112-15 n. 
If one choses as upper limit Kic and as lower limit KIm' i.e. that value of K which 
corresponds to the largest flaw or defect present in the sample, then one obtains as 
~ t the lifetime tb of the sample under constant stress. The extremely strong expo-
nential dependence of ~ t on KIm makes tb very sensitive to flaw size. Increasing the 
size of the largest flaw, am, by only 10% decreases the lifetime tb by a factor of 3. 
The above considerations on the dependence of tb on the size of inherent flaws 
have been extended by various authors [13,16-17] to a method of predicting the 
creep life of glassy polymers. It is assumed that the size am of the largest intrinsic 
flaw can be determined from the breaking stress ab in short time loading according 
to Eq. (9.4): 
(9.24) 
Broutman and McGarry [17] thus obtained intrinsic flaw sizes of 50 Jlm for 
PMMA and of 620 Jlm for PS. Berry [13] reports values of between 62 and 95 Jlm 
for PMMA. These values seem to be very high and no direct optical observations of 
such flaws have been reported. They are also two to three orders of magnitude larger 
than the diameters of microcracks found in PMMA and listed in Table 8.3. The micro-
cracks are assumed to have dimensions comparable to those of a globular substructure 
which may be responsible for their appearance under stress. The "intrinsic flaws" 
must have a different significance, therefore, and may only develop at a stress level 
close to abo 
The higher the crack propagation rate in a sample gets (d > 10-:3 m/s) the more 
the relation between d and KI - and even the measured value of Kic - depend on 
the parameters of the experiment. As shown in Fig. 9.7 Kc increases monotonically 
up to a Kic of 1.6 MN/m- 3/ 2 if ao is kept constant [12, 13]. In other experiments 
(Charpy impact tests, crack initiation and arrest in DCB specimens) K-values at higher 
crack speeds (2 to 300 m/s) are obtained which lie below the Kic [14, 18]. 
268 

I. Fracture Mechanics 
The different points on the d - KI curve in Figure 9.7 represent quite different 
energy release rates G1. According to Eqs. (9.4) and (9.10) G1 increases with the 
square ofK1. For the material employed one may use an average elastic modulus E 
of 4.5 GN/m2 and a v of 0.36 thus obtaining G1 values of 70 J m-2 at the lower 
range ofKc (0.6 MN m-3j2 ) and 500 J m-2 for a K1c of 1.6 MN m-3j2 • These G 
values are equal to the corresponding material resistance R under the given experi-
mental conditions. Their significance and interpretation will be discussed in the fol-
lowing Section. 
The slow crack growth behavior of poly carbonate, also a glassy polymer, is even 
more complex than that ofPMMA. At low temperatures (T < -40°C) Kc values be-
tween 2.6 and 3.4 MN m-3/ 2 have been obtained [19] from DT specimen which 
were independent of crack speed at small crack speeds (d < 1O-3m/s) but dependent 
on sample thickness and temperature. At higher crack speeds (d ~ 10-1 m/s) Kc 
values slowly increased. Double-side grooved DCB specimen (DG-DCB) however 
showed a decrease of Kc with increasing Ii in the region of d < 10-1 m/s [20]. This 
behavior was confirmed by Kambour et al. [21], who observed a Gc of 8.2 kJ/m2 at 
d = 2.5 . 10-5 m/s and of 12 J/m2 at d = 300 m/s. The microphotographical investiga-
tion of the slowly fractured sheets (B = 12.7 mm) revealed the - energy-consuming-
formation of shear lips 0.4 mm wide (mixed mode crack propagation). At high speeds 
no shear lips were found. By copolymerisation of PC with silicone blocks the authors 
[21] were able to increase the fracture toughness in the whole temperature range 
T > -110°C. With this material mixed mode crack propagation occurred fairly 
independently of crack velocity. 
The increase of crosshead speed (over 7 decades) in static three point bending of 
PC resulted [22] only in a slight decrease of the calculated Kc from 3.8 to 3.0 MN 
m-3/ 2 • From the three point bending test a K1c is derived [14] from: 
(9.25) 
if P is taken as the largest load measured, ac/aa as the proper change of specimen 
compliance with growth of a (perpendicular) crack, and BN as the thickness of the 
load carrying section. The quantity ac/aa increases with increasing crack length. 
At the beginning of crack growth the values of P and ac/aa (and the corresponding 
Ku) will be smaller than the Klc at catastrophic failure. Arad et al. [22] point out 
that Kn and K1c are the closer together the less material ductility and/or slow crack 
growth are favored by the experimental conditions. 
In relation to studies of the fracture surface energy as a function of loading rate 
the early and wide application of the tear test (mode III) must be mentioned 
(e.g. [5, 23-28]). In this fracture mode the material in the crack tip zone is sub-
jected to a complex and highly plastic deformation. Without going into details it 
may be mentioned that rate effects on the extent of plastic deformation (and thus 
on fracture surface or tearing energies) have been found [23-29] and correlated 
with (3- and 'Y-relaxation maxima [5, 23-26]. The tearing energies of thermoplastics 
and rubbers are generally quite large: e.g. up to 1 kJ/m2 for PS, 20-200 kJ/m2 for 
PE, and 0.1-500 kJ/m2 for various butadiene copolymers [24-26]. For elastomers 
269 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
Thomas [27] and Ahagon and Gent [28] report that after adjustment for the chang-
ing effective fracture area a common threshold fracture energy To of 40 to 80 J/m2 
could be determined under different experimental conditions. This energy was shown 
to be independent of temperature and degree of swelling for various types of swelling 
liquid. The threshold energy decreased slightly with increasing degree of crosslinking 
(of the polybutadiene samples). In aggressive environment (oxygen, ozone) To is sub-
stantially reduced. 
An experimental and theoretical analysis of the steady propagation of a crack in 
a viscoelastic continuum is due to Knauss [29]. Employing a polyurethane elastomer 
(solithane 113) as material Knauss studied crack propagation under pure shear. From 
his extensive analysis, Knauss derives a solution to the viscoelastic-boundary-value 
problem represented by a crack moving in an isotropic, homogeneous, incompressible 
solid. He finds that the stress singularity at the crack tip vanishes. Under these condi-
tions the stress-intensity factor only describes the far-field loading conditions. Knauss 
observes that the rate-dependent fracture energy is essentially the product of an 
"intrinsic fracture energy", presumably of molecular origin, and of a non-dimensional 
function which relates to the rheology of the material surrounding the crack tip. For 
the polyurethane elastomer this intrinsic fracture energy amounted to 2.45 J/m2 • As 
criteria for crack stability are concerned, he found that the criterion of ultimate, 
constant strain (crack-opening displacement) is as applicable as a generalized energy 
criterion. 
As stated in the introduction to this section the subcritical crack growth in a 
polymer is due to the thermomechanical activation of different molecular deforma-
tion processes such as chain slip and orientation or void opening. The energy dissipated 
depends on the frequency, nature, kinetics, and interaction of these processes. But 
there are many and notable attempts to treat the sub critical crack propagation as 
one thermally activated multi-step process characterized by one enthalpy or energy 
of activation and one activation volume. Several of these kinetic theories of fracture 
have been treated in Chapters 3 and 8. 
The concept of thermal activation has been extended to the fracture mechanical 
analysis of crack propagation. Thus Pollet and Burns [179] have discussed earlier 
approaches and the significance of various variables. Commonly the energy release 
rate G1 is considered as the mechanical intensive parameter. In their treatment, the 
crack front is thus represented by a line on which a force per unit length, G1, tends 
to move it in the forward direction; its motion is, however, restrained by the presence 
of "thermal" obstacles, i.e., obstacles, or barriers, which can be overcome by thermal 
activation. Whether the physical origins of those energy barriers are individual ob-
stacles placed on a unique surface along the fracture path or whether they are located 
somewhere in the surrounding region, does not affect the generality of the treatment 
if G1 can be considered as an intensive variable. 
With the assumption of thermally activated barriers, the average crack velocity 
can be written according to a general Arrhenius-type equation as: 
II = Vo exp [-LlG(G1, T)/kT] 
(9.26) 
where the quantity Vo can be thought of as the maximum attainable crack velocity 
and LlG as the free enthalpy of activation to overcome one "obstacle". 
270 

I. Fracture Mechanics 
As observed by various investigators [12-15,180] an approximately linear rela-
tion holds between the logarithms of crack velocity and crack extension force: 
(9.27) 
Pollet and Burns find the data for PMMA taken by Atkins et al. [180] at various 
temperatures to comply with Eq. (9.27). They determine from C(T) an area of activa-
tion A* = C(T)/G1 of the order of 0.7 . 10-4 to 2' 10-4 nm2. They interpret this 
small value as indicating that the thermal obstacles are not lined up on a single surface 
along the fracture path but distributed in space in a region of material near the ap-
parent fracture path. In view of the consideration in Section IA it should be said that 
G1 is not an intensive variable. Only a small fraction a of G1 contributes to a reduc-
tion of the energy of activation. If slow crack propagation were due solely to the 
repeated shear displacement ofPMMA segments of 0.2 nm length over a distance of 
0.8 nm an activation area of 0.16 nm2 would have been expected. Since 2 . 10-4 nm2 
have been formally calculated one would have to conclude that a amounts to 
2· 10-4/0.16 = 1/800. 
C. Critical Energy Release Rates 
It has been discussed in the previous Section that an increase in stress intensity factor 
or in G1, the driving force for crack extension, promotes sub critical crack growth 
(Figs. 9.6 and 9.7). Since the material resistance R was found to increase with d a new 
equilibrium between G1 and R could be established following any change in G1. If 
G1 of KI are continually increased, however, a point of crack growth instability is 
reached. The instability may be characterized by the statement that at this point the 
material resistance R(d) as given by Eq. (9.13) is not sufficiently rate sensitive to 
compensate the increase in G1. Consequently the crack accelerates to a level of 
velocities where inertia forces and the finite speed Ve of elastic waves have to be con-
sidered [67,181-182]. So far the contribution of the kinetic energy of the receding 
fracture surfaces to R has been neglected. At the point of incipient crack instability 
in PMMA with crack velocities of about 0.1 m/s the kinetic energy term amounts to 
6 J /m3 • At these velocities this term is, therefore, an insignificant fraction of the 
average strain energy density of 100 to 500 kJ/m3• At velocities of between 100 and 
1000 m S-I, however, an increasingly larger fraction of the stored elastic energy 
G1(static) is necessary to account for the kinetic energy of the crack front - reaching 
100% at a crack speed equal to the Rayleigh surface wave velocity VR' The dynamic 
strain energy release rate Gd is, therefore, only a fraction F of G1(static) :

Broberg [181] derived the function F(d, ve) for an infinite, isotropic, elastic plate. 
His expression may be approximated by (1 - d/VR)' 
271 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
Similar considerations apply to the slowdown and eventual arrest of a rapidly 
propagating crack [18, 182]. An understanding of this phenomenon is of consider-
able importance in the use of high pressure pipes where the propagation of a crack 
over long distances must be prevented under any circumstances. 
The transition from subcritical to rapid crack propagation is especially pronounced 
in PMMA but more or less clearly observed in all polymers capable of brittle fracture. 
The corresponding critical quantities K1c and G1c characterize the fracture behavior 
of a material. In Table 9.1 an (incomplete) listing of measured £ritical values 
(G1c and K1c) and of energy release rates referring to particular experimental condi-
tions (Gc ' Gd , GIll) are given. The main experimental parameters and their ranges of 
variation have been indicated. 
Of the various terms of Eq. (9.13) contributing to the material resistance the 
plastic deformation, aVpdBaa, is generally by far the largest. It has been attempted 
in Table 9.2 to identify also surface tension 'Y and the (hypothetical) energy density 
of chain breakage U I qN L' The smallest term is that of the specific surface energy 'Y 
(free surface energy, surface tension). The 'Y values of polymers lie in the range of 
0.020 to 0.046 Jim 2 [31]. The energy of elastic retraction is the product of strain 
energy density and width of the retracting layers. If the layers consist of fully 
oriented chains stressed to break and thus having the highest possible energy density 
(of the order of 1000 MJ/m3 ) the energy of retraction of chain ends of length 
L = 5 run amounts to 8 J/m2 . 
The chemical surface energy, aVch/Baa = Uo/qNL also contributes comparatively 
modestly to R, even if one chain breakage event per molecular cross-section q is con-
sidered: 0.4 J/m2 in PMMA, 2.9 J/m2 in HDPE. The terms Ui and Uch cannot be 
evaluated in all generality. The physico-chemical data used for the above and sub-
sequent calculations are collected in Table 9.2 for seven semicrystalline or glassy 
polymers. 
II. Crazing 
A. Phenomenology 
The phenomenon of crazing has been observed in many glassy polymers, and also in 
some crystalline polymers, when subjected to tensile stress. Polymer crazes (Fig. 9.8a) 
in their appearance are similar to the very fine cracks known for a long time to occur 
on the surfaces of inorganic materials such as ceramics. However, there is a difference 
between the crazes and the cracks in that crazes have a continuity of material across 
the craze plane (Figs. 9.8b, 9.9-9.11) whereas cracks do not possess any continuity. 
Consequently crazed zones are capable of bearing loads as opposed to cracked ones. 
In the last thirty years a growing number of publications has been devoted to the 
phenomenon of crazing. Two comprehensive reviews [76-77] on this subject have 
appeared in 1973. The bibliography on crazing compiled in this monograph [78-178] 
is mostly to be understood as an extension of the earlier reviews.

The subject of crazing has been extensively researched for various reasons: 
in brittle fracture of a crazeable material, cracks generally grow and propagate 
through crazed material, 
the formation of crazes under stress, and/or in presence of an active environment, 
effect (and generally impairs) mechanical and optical properties, surface quality, 
and permeability, 
crazes trace and make visible the statistical and geometrical distribution of the 
variables of their initiation (states of strain or stress, molecular properties, struc-
tural defects). 
Crazes occur most commonly in amorphous, glassy polymers such as PS, SAN, 
PMMA, PVC, PSU, PPO, and PC but also in semicrystalline ones (PE, PP, PETP, and 
POM). Crazes have also been observed in epoxy [131] and phenoxy resins [l09]. 
With reference to the cited literature (e.g. [76-78, 85, 106]) it can be said that 
crazes are sharply bounded regions fIlled with "craze matter". The craze matter 
consists of oriented strands interspersed with voids and has an average density of 40 
to 60% of the matrix density (Figs. 9.9 and 9.10). Kambour [76, 85] has described 
the structure of crazes to be similar to an opencelled foam in which the average dia-
meter of the holes and polymer elements is about 20 nm. There is much evidence 
that the polymer elements are oriented primarily along the direction of the principal 
tensile stress. Beahan et al. [106] noted that a fairly uniform fibril structure exists 
over the whole length of a tapered craze (Fig. 9.9). From the uniformity of this 
structure, these authors conclude that the increase in the width of the craze with 
sample extension is mostly due to fibrillation of further matrix material rather than 
to an increase in fibril extension. More extensive studies [150] have shown, however, 
that there is a change in the micromorphology of the craze along its length, with 
coarser, thicker fibrils being found in the tapered section near the craze tip. The 
morphology of crazes in thin cast films as well as in bulk specimens is rather similar

[115]. In the bulk, fibrils of 25 to 50 run in diameter have been observed (Fig. 9.11, 
b and c). At low strain rates, the crazes grow in thickness by drawing further matrix 
material but also to some extent by an increase in the orientation and elongation of 
the fibrils leading eventually to the breakage of the fibrils. The first stages have been 
shown schematically in Figure 9.11. The principal observations with regard to craze 
morphology are indicated in Table 9.3. 
The mechanical response of fibrils in the direction of the applied stress has been 
determined for polycarbonate [83] and polystyrene [120]. Figure 9.12 shows a stress-
strain curve of craze material obtained by Kambour and Kopp [83] for Pc. It may 
be noted that the craze material can sustain tensile stresses only slightly less than the 
yield stress aF of the bulk material. The strains, however, are enormously greater in 
the craze - between 40 and 140% as compared to the bulk yield strain of about 2%.

It follows from this behavior that the energy of deformation of a thoroughly crazed 
sample can attain very large values (cf. 8 II A). 
B. Craze Initiation 
In spite of the fact that a considerable amount of research has been conducted on 
various aspects of crazing, there has been no exact agreement on the mechanism of 
craze initiation. So far, there is no theoretical model available which can predict in 
all generality whether a certain polymer will craze or not under a given set of condi-
tions. And, if it does craze, what effect the temperature and rate of deformation will 
have on craze formation and propagation. This is certainly due to the fact that the 
initiation of a craze depends simultaneously on three groups of variables characterizing 
respectively the macroscopic state of strain and stress, the nature of defects of hetero-
geneities in the matrix, and the molecular behavior of the polymer in the given thermal 
and chemical environment. In focussing on particular variables five conceptually dif-
ferent approaches to describe the craze initiation emerge. These are based on stress-
bias, critical strain, fracture mechanics, molecular orientation, and molecular mobility 
respectively. The principle observations and the craze initiation criteria proposed on 
the base of the above concepts are listed in Table 9.4. 
These criteria describe different states of local excitation and deformation of 
chain segments. The stress bias criterion [86, 139] refers implicit ely to two mecha-
nisms: cavitation in a dilatational stress field and stabilization of cavities through a 
deviatoric stress component. These mechanisms have been more explicitely con-
sidered in the mathematical model of cavity expansion in .a rigid plastic by Haward 
et al. [137] and in the molecular models by Argon [152] and Kausch [11].

Observations 
Optical and mechanical study of the effect of various 
variables, such as magnitude and duration of stress on 
initiation and development of crazing. 
X-ray scattering and electron microscopy suggests that 
void content of the craze is dispersed in the form of 
inter-connected spheroidal holes having a common 
dimension of 10-20 nm. Stress-strain curves of crazes 
have been determin'ed showing a yield stress followed 
by a recoverable flow to roughly 40 to 50% strain at 
41 to 55 MN/m2. Returned to zero-stress, the craze 
exhibits creep recovery at a decelerating rate.

Conclusions 
Crazing is a mechanical separation of polymer chains or 
groups of chains under tensile stress. Crazing does not 
occur in materials oriented along the draw direction. 
Crazes resemble on open-celled foam, the holes and polymer 
elements of these average about 20 nm in diameter. 
Craze-tensile behavior is an extension of the craze formation 
process. Decrease in elastic modulus and yield stress with 
increasing strain are rationalized in terms of strain-induced 
decrease in density and resultant increase in stress concen-
tration factor on the microscopic polymer elements of the 
craze. Polymer surface tension and large internal specific 
surface areas of the craze are suggested to b'e important 
factors in large creep recovery rates of craze. 
Fibrils of 25-50 nm are a common feature of the micro-
structure of crazes in cast and bulky films. 
Major fibrils diameter = 20-30 nm. 
Minor fibrils connecting major fibrils have a diameter 
> 10 nm and they tend to orient normally to major fibrils. 
At large total deformation at low E, there is a gradual transi-
tion from coarse to fine microstructure of crazes. 
The large number of parallel crazes formed permitted 
the determination of the stress-strain curve of a craze; 
it is similar to that found by Kambour and Kopp (83) 
for solvent-induced crazes in PC (Fig. 9.12)

craze propagation and final failure. 
Kinetics of craze growth in methanol explained by liquid 
flow through the porous crazed material (to which a void 
spacing of 0.25 /lm, a void size of 72 nm and a craze yield 
stress of 9 MN m - 2 are assigned). 
In a plot of a; (square of the threshold stresses for crack 
propagation) versus reciprocal crack length a a distinct lower 
bound was found which defined a critical energy release rate 
Gj; whereas Gj initially decreases with temperature it becomes 
independent of temperature at T > T c where T c roughly 
corresponds to the T g of PMMA in the particular environment. 
Stress concentration at crack tip is sensibly reduced with craze 
initiation and not transferred to craze tip. 
There is a critical stress intensity factor Km below which no 
crazing occurs: 
Km = 0.13 MN m- 3/2 PMMA 
Km = 0.29 MN m-3/2 PC 
The difference in sorption kinetics is held responsible for the 
higher critical stress intensity factor and the lower exponent 
n in PC, relative to PMMA.

Craze initiation occurs in regions where chains were oriented

The crazing stress increases with amount of orientation when 
the tensile axis is parallel to the draw direction, and decreases 
with amount of orientation when the axis is normal to the 
draw direction. 
At high draw ratios the crazing stress parallel to the draw 
direction is higher than the shear yielding stress and the 
material undergoes a yielding process similar to compression 
yielding. 
Molecular orientation has only a small effect on the orientation 
of the craze plane. 
The effect of molecular orientation on the crazing behavior 
of polystyrene is primarily associated with the nucleation 
stage of the crazing process. 
The time required for the formation of crazes is an inherent, 
but statistical, characteristic of the material itself involving 
a stress depending rate process reflecting to some extent the 
initial microscopic flaw distribution.

Conclusion 
Both yield stress and .:razing stress vary with temperature, 
but crazing stress varies less than the yield stress. This 
indicates that crazing has to provide the nucleation surface 
energy for voids. 
Similar response of crazing and yielding data to temperature 
indicates that in both cases similar molecular conformational 
changes and backbone motions are involved. 
Materials having highest crazing tendency (PMMA, PS, SAN) 
also have high yield stress and thus a large energy associated 
with local plastic instability (which is necessary to account 
for the nucleation and growth of the tiny voids). 
Crazes initiate at surface or interface stress concentrations 
where localized plastic flow produces micro cavities by intense 
inhomogeneous plastic shear at a molecular scale. 
The rate of cavity formation depends primarily on the activation 
free energy ~G* (cf. Eq. 8-30) and on the local concentrated 
deviatoric stress while the subsequent plastic expansion into 
craze nuclei is in response to global negative pressure.

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
The strain criteria [104, 110, 113, 121] specify that no crazing will occur if the 
largest principal strains - even at extended times - remain below a limiting value, 
which was found to be some 2% or less. At short times craze initiation strains may, 
in some polymers, be of the order of 3 to 5% [104,113]. In the absence of intensive 
strain concentration strains of this order are insufficient to cause chain scission but 
they tend to decrease the intermolecular attraction (cf. 8 II B). This is recognized 
by Oxborough and Bowden [142] who also use the tensile hydrostatic stress (Id in 
their general critical-strain criterion. In biaxial stress fields the stress bias criterion 
and their criterion differ only little; as Oxborough and Bowden point out Sternstein's 
data and their own can be explained by either one of the two criteria. 
If one would apply either of the above criteria the craze initiation in a sharply 
notched plate loaded in tension, one would have to expect instantaneous crazing 
since both I a 1 - all and E show a singularity at an infmitely sharp crack tip 
(cf. Eqs. 9.1 to 9.3). Such an expectation would be contrary to the experimental 
findings. Marshall et al. [102] and Narisawa et al. [127] have established that it is the 
initial stress intensity factor Ko which controls craze initiation at the crack tip. In 
the case of PMMA and PC immersed in methanol or kerosene critical values Km exist 
below which no craze initiation and growth occurs. This behavior can be understood 
in view of the discrete sizes of the chain segments and of any voids to be formed, in 
view of the fact that the density of stored elastic energy is limited (Fig. 9.3), and in 
view of plastic deformations eliminating the stress singularity. Marshall et al. [102] 
conclude from their data that crazing occurs when the material at the crack tip 
reaches a critical strain or crack opening displacement. 
The effect of sample structure and morphology on craze initiation has been 
recognized since the earliest investigations [78]. The structure of the sample surface 
is for various reasons especially important: 
- defects and/or contaminations are preferentially found at the surface enhancing 
craze initiation there [173, 176]; 
injection molded or machined samples mostly contain a surface structure which 
differs from that of the bulk material [89, 175, 176]; 
molecular chain segments in surfaces have a higher degree of mobility [112]; 
environmental attack (diffusion, plastification, degradation) begins at the surface 
and penetrates from there. 
The investigations of the effect of chain orientation on craze initiation show that 
a transverse orientation of the chains with respect to the direction of principal stress 
enhances craze initiation [89, 153]. Because there are fewer chain segments pointing 
in the direction of principal stress critical local strains are obtained at smaller stresses 
(cL 3 IV E). On the other hand the craze initiation stress increases with the degree of 
alignment of the chains in the stress direction (increasing degree of orientation, small 
angles 8 between draw direction and principal stress). In the case of good alignment 
craze initiation stresses will be higher than the stress for shear yielding so that no 
crazing is observed. For PS at 20°C yielding in tension occurs in samples drawn to 
/... = 2.6 or more and at a 8(/...) smaller than 20 to 30° [153]. Particularly noteworthy 
is the observation of Hull and Hoarse [153] that the molecular orientation has only a 
small effect on the orientation of the craze plane. 
282 

II. Crazing 
This indicates that the transfer of stresses along the axes of the oriented chain 
segments does not determine the direction of craze extension. 
As an effect of sample structure and morphology the enhancement of craze 
initiation through surface flaws [118,152,173,176], impurities [155,161], and 
heterophase inclusions (reviewed in [114, 168, 190, 191] has also to be mentioned. 
The molecular criteria generally take into consideration molecular weight, chain 
entanglement and the local mobility of chain segments at the given temperature and 
chemical environment [11, 15,50, 79, 146, 165-167,173]. The effect of the chemical 
environment will be discussed in Section D. The follOwing investigations generally 
have been conducted in standard atmosphere. An interpretation of craze initiation 
in terms of local strain softening has been given by Rusch and Beck [95]. They pro-
pose that there exists a critical strain for crazing which is dependent on the level of 
frozen free volume initially distributed in the bulk of the material. Through the im-
posed dilatant strain sufficient free volume is added to bring the polymer to a state 
similar to the one reached by it at its T g' Gent [96], too, suggests that craze initiation 
results from lowering of the T g in local high stress fields at surface flaws. However, 
as shown by various authors [89, 129, 158] surface crazes occur in PS, PMMA, and 
PC at temperatures of -75°C and below. This raises a doubt whether the polymer 
reaches a state characteristic of its Tg at such low temperatures or not. 
Lipatov and Fabulyak [112] point to the importance oflow temperature relaxa-
tion processes due to the motions of side chains. These relaxations shift towards 
lower temperatures in samples with high surface to volume ratios. This behavior has 
been interpreted in terms of lower segmental packing on the surface and, therefore, 
easier molecular motions. It is claimed that this facilitates crazing. Shifts of molecu-
lar relaxations towards lower temperature (in PC) have also been observed by Sikka 
[163] who suggested that this shift may have its origin in the formation of microvoids. 
Studies of molecular weight dependence of crazing and of breaking stresses have 
been carried out by Fellers and Kee [146]. These authors suggest that craze initiation

stresses are independent of molecular weight when Mn > 2 Me whereas craze devel-
opment and breakdown are clearly molecular weight dependent. This is evident from 
the plot of stresses versus molecular weight, shown in Figure 9.13. Since the measured 
elastic moduli (1.5 GN m-2) did not depend on molecular weight the craze initiation 
strains are also constant (2%). From these results it may be concluded that craze 
initiation is an event which depends primarily on the interaction between chain 
segments. Contrary to the apparent independence of stress and strain at craze initia-
tion to molecular weight the T g of the different PS fractions rises monotonically 
from 88°C at Mn = 70000 to 105°C at Mn = 150000_ Another observation made 
by these and other authors is that crazes in high molecular weight samples are very 
fine, numerous, long, and straight as compared to the ones in lower-molecular weight 
polymers, which are coarser in texture and somewhat shorter in length. This pheno-
menon seems to be related to the homogeneity of the stress field which is the better 
the more numerous and the stronger the fibrils. Based on these studies and on the 
extensive investigations of Doll et al. [15, 30, 50, 60, 61, 67] a model of craze initia-
tion and propagation is presented (Fig. 9.14). The effects of molecular weight

(Mn > 2 Me) on crazing may be characterized using this model: 
Mn has very little influence on the elastic straining behavior (region A) and on the 
stress or strain at which crazes are initiated (B) 
after craze initiation, fibrils are formed which are stronger and which can develop, 
under increasing stress and time, to greater lengths the higher Mn ; consequently 
region C is the more extended the higher Mn 
the force transmitted by region C grows with Mn and so does the stress at break.

II. Crazing 
In an attempt to reconcile the various partially insufficient craze initiation 
criteria with the experimental data Argon [165-167] and Kausch [11] have proposed 
models of the craze initiation process which take molecular structure, chain rigidity, 
conformational changes, and intermolecular interaction into consideration. Argon 
bases his criterion of the transition from A to B on the break-up of concave air-
polymer interfaces (cf. Table 9.4). Kausch has described a three-step craze-nucleation 
mechanism: 
a primary step of de cohesion of molecular coils with low degree of entanglement, 
i.e. the formation of unstable micro-voids (B 1 in Fig. 9.15). 
a secondary step of anelastic deformation of adjacent molecular coils containing 
topological entanglements (B2 in Fig. 9.15), 
a third step of direct lateral transmission of strain onto adjacent coils which leads 
to a preferred formation of micro-voids in correlation to the first .

The micro-voids are stabilized through the anelastic deformation of coils in the 
secondary step. According to a suggestion of Fischer the attainment of a critical 
macroscopic compliance permitting an anelastic deformation of the coils of sufficient 
amplitude is the necessary prerequisite for the secondary step to take place [11]. 
With sustained or increased load the micro-voids coalesce and leave micro-fibrils

which connect the opposite craze surfaces. These micro-fibrils are formed, therefore, 
of moderately elongated, physically entangled molecular coils. The diameter of the 
micro-voids of 10 to 20 nm and that of the fibrils of 10 to 50 nm indicate that the 
formation of a micro-void is an event involving only very few molecular coils. 
C. Molecular Interpretation of Craze Propagation and Breakdown 
The foregoing discussion on the phenomenology of craze initiation has also given a 
molecular interpretation of the propagation of an individual craze. Taking into con-
sideration the formation of many crazes either simultaneously, or in sequence, a par-
ticular craze grows through: 
displacement of the craze tip into uncrazed material by the formation of voids 
ahead of the craze tip or by coalescence with a separate and smaller craze, 
widening of the craze while extending the craze matter, Le. the molecular strands; 
depending on the overall conditions strands may rupture or disentangle giving rise 
to a crack. 
There are three aspects of craze propagation which will be discussed at this point: 
the kinetics of craze growth, the stress at the craze-matrix interface (region C in 
Fig. 9.13), and the craze breakdown. 
The rate of longitudinal craze growth has been studied by a number of authors. 
The many problems still existing with regard to the transition of matrix material 
into craze matter and with the rheological properties of the latter are found to be of 
double weight in any quantitative description of craze propagation. For this reason 
no detailed description of the various approaches will be given here - but the basic 
concepts should be mentioned. The fracture mechanical investigations on PMMA 
[15,50,102,127,133] and PC [127, 144] have led to empirical expressions for 
d(a + rp)/dt, the rate of craze growth, in terms of stress intensity factors. Kambour 
[76] and Marshall et al. [102, 133] stress the importance of environmental flow 
through the porous craze material. Verheulpen-Heymans [155] formulates a model 
for craze growth based on stress and strain analysis around a craze and on the rheo-
logical properties of the craze matter. In those cases where the craze length was 
found proportional to the crack length [15,144,177] the empirical law for crack 
growth (e.g. Eq. 9.22) also describes craze growth. 
The stresses at the craze-matrix interface may be determined from the craze 
shape. It was found by Weidmann and Doll [15] for PMMA and by Fraser and Ward 
[177] for PC that the shape of these interfaces conformed very well to the predicted 
shape according to the Dugdale-Muskelishvili plastic zone model [7]. In that model 
it is assumed that a normal stress equal to the matrix yield stress aF is acting on the 
interfaces. This stress aF is derived from Eqs. (9.18) and (9.20) as 1TEva/4rp. Using 
the approximately molecular-weight independent ratio of rp/2va ~ 27 as given by 
Weidmann and Doll [15] for PMMA and using an E of 4.5 GN m-2 one arrives at an 
aF of 65 MN m- 2. This value corresponds to the strength of the isotropic PMMA 
(Table 1-1). Fraser and Ward [177] obtained in the same wayan interfacial stress of 
58 MN m-2 (at 22°C) and 130 MN m-2 (at -130°C) for PC. 
286 

II. Crazing 
Another method, Knight's analysis of stress distribution along a craze, has been 
used in a number of investigations (cf. [76,77]). Verheulpen-Heymans [157] quite 
recently pointed out, however, that the - mostly unknown - rheological behavior 
of craze material and of the craze tip zone has such a strong effect on the calculated 
stress field that at the present time the results of this method cannot be interpreted 
unambigously. 
Using holographic interferometry Peterson et al. [148] determined the distribu-
tion of the incremental stresses caused by a strain increment applied to a craze in PC. 
At low prestrains (1.3-1.7%) they observed that the craze material near the tip of 
the craze actually supporte~stress increment .6.ay well in excess of the average 
stress increment .6.ay (.6.ay/ .6.ay equal to 1.2 to lAS). The peaks in the stress incre-
ments occurred at a distance of 0.2 to OA of the craze length behind the craze tip. 
In their photoelastic studies of PMMA and PC crack tips Narisawa et al. [127] noted 
high stress concentrations just before the initiation of a craze and very modest stresses 
60 min later. No noticeable new stress concentration appeared at the craze tip. 
In a growing craze molecular strands are formed (at B in Fig. 9.14) and extended 
(zone C in Fig. 9.14). The growth of a craze is slowed down or even halted 
if the craze hits upon an obstacle which prevents further fibrillation of matrix 
material (e.g. a heterophase inclusion; a zone of higher orientation, larger flexibility 
or lower stresses; the end of the specimen) 
if the craze has grown to such an extent that the initiating crack or flaw is blunted 
and rendered uncritical 
if the craze interacts with other crazes or with the environment in such a way as 
to change the conditions which have led to its initiation and/or growth (stress 
relaxation of the sample because of craze-related creep deformation, penetration 
into a lower-stress zone adjacent to another craze). 
On the other hand craze growth will continue or be resumed if the molecular 
strands fail (transition from craze to crack, zone D in Fig. 9.14). It becomes imme-
diately clear from Figure 9.14 and Eq. (9.18) that the energy dissipated in the open-
ing up of a craze is the higher the longer and wider the craze (zone C) and the larger 
aF. By no means all questions are answered concerning the structure and rheology 
of the molecular strands and of the interface craze-matrix. Nevertheless it can be said 
that at a void content of 50% a molecular strand is subjected to a tensile stress of 
about 2 aF, a stress which does not vary too much with development of the craze 
from B to D. The mentioned maximum in incremental stress at a distance of 0.2 to 
OA of the craze length in PC does not contradict the above statement. It indicates, 
however, that the differential compliance of a freshly developed strand is smaller 
than that of an extended fibril. 
While being subjected to the tensile load the molecular strand obviously degrades 
and eventually fails and this causes a transition from a craze to a crack. The break-
down occurs by one or more of the following mechanisms: 
slippage and disentangelment of molecular coils leading to fibril rupture (frequently 
of the central section of the fibril), 
fibril rupture through breakage of entangled chains, 
fibril-matrix separation.

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
The phenomenon of the loading and breakdown of the molecular strands has 
been studied by various methods. Optical and electron micrographs of crazes are 
shown in most of the cited references. Examples have been reproduced in Figures 
9.8-9.10. Investigations of the craze shape by interference microscopy [15, 155, 177] 
have also been discussed. At this point some results will be reported which have been 
obtained by thermal measurements [31, 50, 184-186], from analysis of the influence 
of molecular weight on crazing [11,15,65,79,146,178], through acoustic emission 
[174,188], and by the ESR technique [189-190] respectively. 
Doll [31, 50] determined the amount of heat Q dissipated in PMMA at the tip 
of a rapidly propagating crack. To derive Q they measured the temperature rise 
ilT 1 (t) at a thermocouple placed on the specimen surface close to the prospective 
fracture plane. Considering geometry, thermal conductivity, and crack speed a they 
calculated the heat Q dissipated per unit are of crack surface. As expected Q increased 
with ti and Mw (from 0.15 to about 5 kJ/m2 ) and it was found proportional to the 
dynamic energy release rate Gd . Extrapolating Q(Gd ) down to G1c (at Ii = 140 m S-1) 
they observed that the dissipated heat Q (li = 140 m S-I) = Qo accounted for only 
57% of the released mechanical energy G1c ' They ascribe this difference to the fact 
that the highly stressed molecular strands conserve an amount of energy of the order 
of 0.43 G1c , that this energy is released at the moment offibril rupture and that it is 
dissipated over wide distances in the form of small shock waves which escape measure-
ment by the employed difference technique [30]. The acoustic emission analysis 
(AEA) of a crazing PMMA sample by Roeder [188] permits similar conclusions. The 
formation of crazes (transition A ~ C in Fig. 9.14) did not give rise to any discernible 
acoustic signal. Whereas the transition from a craze to a crack (C ~ D) could be traced 
by AEA even at an earlier stage than by optical microscopy. In PS, however, craze 
formation is accompanied by sharp cracking sounds at strains of 0.6% or less [78]. 
The thermal measurements are not only interesting in view of the energy balance 
of the crazing process but also because they permit the calculation of the local tem-
perature rise il T 0 caused by the opening up and breakdown of the craze in PMMA. Doll 
[30] assumed that Qo was initially confined to the zone of crazed material. Using a density 
of 0.6 g cm-3, a specific heat of 1.46 J g-1 K-1, a craze layer thickness 2 v of 
1.65 pm, and a Qo of 335 J m-2 he arrives at a ilTo = 230 K. This value is in accord 
with theoretical estimates of Weichert and SchOnert [185] and with infrared measure-
ments of Fuller et al. [184] on PMMA. The latter determined within a range of ti of 
200 to 640 m S-1 a constant ilT of 500 K. The Simultaneously observed increase 
in Q(d) implied that the plastic deformation at the crack tip became more extensive 
at higher crack speeds. Preliminary experiments on PS showed a il T of 400 K and 
smaller heat values [184]. These temperatures are certainly large although not com-
pletely unreasonable. They indicate that not only melting but thermal degrada-
tion must occur under these conditions. And they are in proportion with the much 
higher temperature rises - of several thousand K - which were deduced by Weichert 
[186] from the spectroscopical analysis of light emitted during fracture of glass. 
It was noted at an early stage that sample molecular weight is an important 
variable in craze propagation and breakdown. Rudd [79] studied the stress relaxation 
ofPS fllms in contact with the crazing environment butanol. A plot of a(t)/a(O) 
versus logarithm of time revealed that the time to reach the 40% stress level was three 
288 

II. Crazing 
orders of magnitude larger for the higher molecular weight samples. The final decay 
from 0.4 0(0) to zero stress occurred rather rapidly for all molecular weights [79]. 
The observation of Fellers and Kee [146] that the breaking stress ofPS only 
gradually increases once Mn > 2 Me has already been mentioned in the previous 
section (Fig. 9.13). Their results conform quite well to those of Doll and Weidmann 
[15,50]. These authors determined the shape of a craze, the released heat Q and the 
material resistance R for a series of PMMA samples having well defined molecular 
weights Mw between 1.1 . lOS and 8 . 106 • Measuring the crack opening 2 v, the 
craze width 2 ve' and the craze length rp at a crack speed of 10-8 m S-1 they noted 
that these parameters of the craze shape increased with Mw up to an Mw of about 
2· lOs. At higher Mw hardly any changes of 2 v and rp and very small increases of 
craze width were observed [15]. This means that initially (Mw < 1.6 . lOs) craze 
widths increase with chain lengths. The craze widths are found to be by a factor of 
5.2 larger than the extended chain length. This does not mean, however, that each 
molecular strand consists of just a few, highly extended chains. One may assume 
that before craze initiation the molecules have their randomly coiled conformation. 
Chains ofMw = 1.1 . lOS for instance have an end-to-end distance of 21 nm. During 
craze opening this distance will on the average increase by the fibril strain, i.e. to 
about 30 nm. A total of 2360 of these elongated coils are contained in a fibril of 
20 nm diameter and 1200 nm length. At molecular weights comparable to Me the 
interpenetration and entanglement of these coils hardly allows the formation of 
fibrils [11, 146,187]. At higher molecular weights (up to Mw = 2· lOS) the coils are 
larger in size and the absolute number of entanglements per coil increases; the fibrils 
become stronger and more resistant to failure by slippage or disentanglement. At 
even higher molecular weights (Mw > 2' lOS) and under constant load the fibril 
strength seems to be more determined by the strength than by the flow behavior 
of the molecules. Under oscillating loads disentanglement may even occur at such 
molecular weight levels. Recent experiments of Skibo, Hertzberg, and Manson [191 ] 
strongly support the contention that the breakdown of molecular strands as a con-
sequence of their disentanglement triggers the stepwise growth of fatigue cracks. 
This phenomenon will be discussed in more detail in Section 9 III C. 
The critical energy release rates GIe show a behavior similar to that of the craze 
shape. For small Mw the GIe are strongly dependent on Mw' Thus they increase from 
1.4 J m-2 at Mw = 2· 104 to 110 J m-2 at Mw = 12 to 15 . 104 [65]. At higher 
molecular weights - up to 8 . 106 - only a gradual increase of GIe to values of be-
tween 160 and 600 J m-2 is observed [30,65]. This corresponds to what has been 
said above on the effect of molecular weight on fibril length and strength. 
The occurrence of chain rupture in craze breakdown has been inferred from the 
above thermal, mechanical and acoustical evidence. Its direct observation by ESR 
technique is difficult because of the limited number of crazes which can simulta-
neously be carried to breakdown. The number of chain breakages generally corre-
sponds to that of a single fracture plane. No quantitative data on free radicals formed 
in crazing have been reported. DeVries et al. [189] have observed a very weak ESR 
signal in a crazed and cut PMMA fiber. Nielsen et al. [190] did not find any evidence 
offree radicals in thoroughly crazed - but unbroken - samples ofPS and ABS. 
289 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
The above considerations mostly dealt with an individual craze, with the condi-
tions of its initiation, propagation and breakdown in a brittle polymer. Generally a 
larger number of crazes is formed in a stressed specimen (cf. Fig. 9.8a). If those 
crazes are sufficiently distant from each other then they will grow freely. Opfermann 
[175] found that in PMMA a lateral distance between crazes of 80 J1ffi assured their 
unimpeded longitudinal growth. The macroscopic mechanical properties (strain at 
break, strength at short or long times, energy to break) depend to some extent on 
the number of crazes per (surface) area, but they are still comparable to those of a 
brittle solid with a strain at break of some 4 to 5% and a low fracture energy. In order 
to sensibly increase the macroscopic creep compliance and the energy to break, crazes 
must be initiated in large numbers throughout the sample volume and they must be 
prevented from premature breakdown. Both objectives have been achieved with 
heterophase copolymers or blends. 
The obvious technological importance of the toughening of brittle polymers 
through controlled crazing is reflected by the considerable amount of work done in 
this area. In a recent monograph by Manson and Sperling [192] a comprehensive 
elaboration of the physical, chemical, technological, and materials science aspects of 
polymer mixtures, rubber-toughened plastics, block copolymers, grafted copolymers, 
interpenetrating networks, and polymer blends has been given. The reader is referred 
to this monograph for any detailed information on these systems. The conference 
proceedings [193] from the Bad Nauheim meeting on multiphase polymer systems 
also treat synthesis, compatibility, and mechanical properties of copolymers and 
blends. In addition, references are given which focus on individual aspects. Argon 
[152] and Retting [168] have reviewed the crazing of heterogeneous glassy polymers. 
A quantitative method to describe creep and impact toughening of HiPS is presented 
by Bucknall et al. [114]; the effect of crazing on the stress-dependence of creep in 
PS and SAN is discussed by Moore et al. [94]. the surface morphology of stress 
whitening in ABS by Morbitzer et al. [97], the effect of rubber on the environmental 
stress-crack resistance ofPE by Spenadel [117], and the rapid healing of crazes in 
ruptured rubber-toughened ABS/MMA sheets by Takahashi [143]. 
Valuable information on the role of crazing in breakdown of a polymer is ob- . 
tained, of course, from fractographY. Relevant investigations [30, 49, 61, 66, 132, 
150, 155, 169, 194-204] on this subject will be discussed in Section III A. 
D. Response to Environment 
In the previous sections on crazing primarily mechanical and molecular parameters 
have been discussed while the chemical environment was not considered as a variable. 
At this point an overview over the physico-chemical response of a crazable material 
to an active chemical environment will be given. (The chemical response to an active 
physical environment such as photo degradation or ozonolysis has been treated or 
referenced in 8 III). 
The physico-chemical actions of a (gaseous or liquid) chemical agent on a 
polymer involve adsorption and absorption of the agent, the swelling and/or plasti-
cization of the matrix, the reduction of surface energies, and/or chemical reactions 
290 

II. Crazing 
such as the hydrolytic depolymerization. These aspects of environmental stress 
cracking (ESC) have been treated in numerous original articles and some reviews 
(e.g. [80, 76-77, 171 D. From the extremely large body of experimental observations 
only a few can be discussed in the following. 
The physico-chemical actions of a liquid environment may influence the initia-
tion, propagation, or breakdown of a craze in a thermoplastic polymer. There seems 
to be agreement that a liquid must be able to diffuse into a polymer in order to in-
fluence craze initiation. Narisawa [119] determined the critical stresses Uj for craze 
initiation in thin films of PS and PC in contact with various alcohols and hydro-
crabons. He observed that crazes appear without significant delay and that ui 
decreases with decreaSing chain length of the solvent (from 45 to 20 MN m-2 for 
PS, from 70 to 50 MN m- 2 for PC). From these results he concludes that a slight 
swelling of a microscopic surface area is necessary and sufficient to effect craze 
initiation. He derived a criterion for Uj in the form of Eq. (8.29) with activation 
volumes of the order of 1.0 to .13 nm3 , activation energies of 109 to 130 kJ/mol, 
and rate constants of 1 to 10 . 10-38 S-1 (PS) and 2 to 50 . 10-45 S-1 (PC). 
The solvent crazing in terms of polymer and liquid solubility parameters has been 
studied in detail by Andrews et al. [124,126] and Kambour et al. [125, 128]. Kambour 
employed a wide range of swelling liquids with solubility parameters Os between 
5.34 and 19.2 cal 1/ 2 cm -3/2. He determined the equilibrium solubility Sy, expressed 
as volume of liquid absorbed per unit volume of polymer, for PS, PPO, and PSU. 
The swelling of PPO across the whole spectrum of organic liquids was found to be 
inversely correlated by los -0 PPO 1 and, consequently, the craze resistance was 
correlated by 1 os-oppo I. In PS and PSU craze resistance was less well correlated by 
the solubility parameters. With all three polymers, however, the equilibrium solubility 
Sy gave a good measure of the polymer-solvent interaction. Using Sy as independent 
variable, unique plots of T g and of craze initiation strain €j were obtained for two 
sets of polystyrene data. One set was obtained from samples preplasticized to various 
degrees by o-dichlorobenzene; the other from "dry" samples in contact with the 
swelling agent (€j) or swollen films (Tg). Kambour concludes from these results that 
the presence or absence of a liquid/polymer interface is immaterial to the crazing 
effectiveness of a given crazing agent. 
The crazing agent thus acts through its presence within the polymer matrix. In 
increasing the chain mobility (lowering T g) it facilitates the primary and secondary 
steps of craze initiation: nucleation and stabilization of a craze. This leads to the 
lowering of Uj and €j in brittle polymers such as PS. Easier nucleation and stabilization 
even cause the appearance of crazes in otherwise ductile materials such as PPO, PSU, 
PVC, or PC. 
Andrews et al. [124, 126] also studied the equilibrium swelling, of PMMA, 
in various alcohols and related it to the observed changes in yield stress, UF, glass 
transition temperature, T g, and material resistance R. They report the interesting 
phenomenon that R above a certain critical temperature T c became independent of 
temperature. Within experimental error T c corresponded to the T g of the PMMA 
under the particular conditions of swelling. They propose a relation for R involving 
the surface energy of the nucleated cavities and UF. They then interpret the constancy 
of R(T > T c) with the vanishing of uF(T > T c). The absolute values of R(T > T c) 
291 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
are rather small: about 0.1 J m-2 (or PMMA in isobutanol, carbon tetrachloride, 
n-propyl and isopropyl alcohols, 0.3 J m-2 for ethanol, 0.45 J m-2 for methanol 
[124 ]. 
The swelling, crazing, and cracking behavior of PMMA, PVC, and PSU in contact 
with some 70 different liquids was analyzed by Vincent and Raha [123]. They con-
sidered not only the solubility parameter Os but also the value of the hydrogen 
bonding parameter HOD based on the displacement of the OD infra-red absorption 
band in CH30D in presence of the particular liquid and benzene. Better (but still 
no unique), correlation between the mode of failure and Os and HOD was obtained. 
An extensive investigation of the role of metal salts in stress cracking of various 
polyamides was carried out by Dunn and Sansom [90-93]. Metal halides permitted 
to distinguish two types of action: the formation of complexes between the metal 
and the carbonyl oxygen and interference with the hydrogen bonding (found for the 
chlorides of Zn, Co, Cu, Mn) or with solvent cracking, as with Li CI, Ca C12, Mg C12 , 
or Li Br [90-91]. The action of metal thiocyanates on polyamide 6 was similar to 
that of the corresponding metal halides [92]. Of various nitrates Cu(N03h had the 
strongest effect on the stress cracking ofPA6 fIlms [93]. 
In the investigations of Marshall and Williams et al. [52, 102, 133, 151, 164] 
Narisawa et al. [127], Kitagawa et al. [144], and Krenz et al. [159-160] craze growth 
and creep were related to fracture mechanical quantities. Graham et al. [164] model 
crazes in PMMA as a line plastic zone subjected to a craze stress aer. In the presence 
of active liquids aer is reduced from its air value of 100 MN m-2 to e.g. 7 (methanol), 
5 (ethanol and propanol) or 10 MN m-2 (butanol). A clear linear correlation be-
tween Km and aer was found to exist. For the craze size at initiation (i.e. just before 
the beginning of crack growth) the authors found a unique value of 11.5 f..LITl [164]. 
Similar fracture mechanical studies of solvent crazes in polystyrene were carried out 
by holographic interferometry by Krenz et al. [159-160]. 
Studies of the micromechanics of deformation in semicrystalline polyethylene 
in environmental stress cracking agents [107, 154, 170, 171, 204] have elucidated 
the role of spherulites and of the mosaic block structure and its disintegration into 
independent nonuniform fibrils. The morphology of crazes in amorphous PVC in 
liquid and vapor environment was examined by Driesen [122] and Martin et al. [198]. 
It has not always been recognized that liquid gases such as N2 and Ar are also 
acting as environmentally active agents. Parrish and Brown et al. [116, 129] have 
been the nrst to report that the fracture stresses of PE and PTFE immersed in helium 
at 78 K are respectively 21 and 33% larger than those obtained in liqUid N2. Later 
studies of Brown et al. [134, 157-158], Peterlin et al. [135,137-138,145] and 
Kastelic and Baer [140] concern N2 , Ar, O2 , CO2 , and He and a variety of materials 
(pP, PTFE, PETP, PC, PMMA). It is the common consensus that 
-
N2 and Ar exert an environmental effect on the tensile stress-strain curves of all 
polymers at low temperatures 
-
the environmental effect is the larger the closer a gas is to its condensation point 
and the greater its thermodynamic activity [145] 
-
N2, Ar, O2 , and CO2 usually cause craze yielding whereas in He or in vacuo the 
polymers undergo brittle fracture without crazing 
-
the gases have to act at or close to a free surface 
292 

III. Molecular and Morphological Aspects of Crack Propagation 
as crazing mechanisms gas absorption and matrix plasticization are proposed as 
well as gas adsorption and surface energy reduction which facilitates cavity forma-
tion. 
From the discussion in this section a number of craze suppression mechanisms 
have become apparent which may be summarized here: 
imposition of hydrostatic pressure in addition to tensile stresses [86,139,142] 
introduction of compressive stresses into the surface [77, 174, 176] 
orientation of molecules in the surface layer [89, 153] 
plasticization, preferentially of the surface [82, 162, 178] 
coating of the surface by an oligomer of the sample material, e.g. coating of PS 
by a 600 molecular weight polystyrene oligomer [178] polishing of the surface 
[173, 178] 
increase of sample molecular weight. 
III. Molecular and Morphological Aspects of Crack Propagation 
A. Fracture Surfaces 
Fractography, the study of the morphology of fracture surfaces, is an obvious tool 
to elucidate the origin and the mode of propagation of a crack. In this monograph 
fracture surfaces of fibers (in 8 I G) and of other samples have already been analyzed 
where appropriate. At this point some additional remarks are necessary concerning 
particularly the effect of chain length and intermolecular attraction on fracture 
surface morphology. 
The discussion in 9 I C of the various terms contributing to the critical energy 
release rate G1c and the data assembled in Tables 9.1 and 9.2 have made it clear that 
a fracture surface is obviously not simply formed by the breakage of primary and/or 
secondary bonds across a fracture plane of molecular dimensions. There is always a 
plastic deformation of the crack tip zone and, consequently, of the ensuing fracture 
surface. It is to be expected that the extent of plastic deformation is the smaller the 
smaller the segmental mobility, i.e. the lower the temperature. At liquid nitrogen 
temperature most high polymers resemble glasses and fracture in a brittle manner.

bending at liquid nitrogen temperature

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
Viewed without magnification the fracture surfaces (e.g. Fig. 9.16) show a macro-
scopic roughness but they appear to be locally smooth although not shiny. This 
indicates that the surfaces contain structural irregularities larger than the wavelength 
of light. This is the case with e.g. PE, PP, PVC, PS, and also with PMMA which, how-
ever, has a very smooth surface. 
The macroscopic features of the shown fracture surface (Fig. 9.16) can be ascribed 
to the propagation of a cleavage crack at high speed normal to the direction of local 
tensile stress. The local stress field is strongly affected by elastic waves generated at 
earlier stages of crack development and by the initiation of secondary cracks. The 
fracture surface was obtained by bending a notched polyethylene sample at liquid 
nitrogen temperature [130]. The surface is locally smooth but otherwise full of steps 
and ridges. The intersection of wavefronts and crack planes under different (e.g. right) 
angles leads to the curious patterns as shown in the bottom right of Figure 9.17. The 
characteristic properties of thermoplastics, molecular anisotropy and strong rate 
dependency of deformation become apparent to a limited extent only. 
Fig. 9.17. Section of the fracture surface 
in the originally compressive zone from 
the same specimen shown in Fig. 9.16 
(from [130)). 
The seemingly smooth parts of the cleavage surface deserve two further com-
ments. Figure 9 .18 shows that the material disintegration of the "smooth" surface 
is not restricted to molecular dimensions but has a honeycomb-structure with cells 
of 100 to 600 nm width. This is in accordance with the earlier statement on the size 
of surface irregularities. It is also of interest to note that these dimensions are only a 
few times larger than the radius of gyration of the chain molecules. The ridges be-
tween cells are highly deformed. As their width is comparable to that of the cells a 
plastic deformation of about 100% is indicated. This is in view of the test temperature 
quite remarkable. It is definitely caused by the fact that the comparatively long and 
strong molecules are not highly oriented but have a coiled conformation correspond-
ing in all probability to the "solidification model" of semicrystalline polymers 
(cf. 2 I C). Under these circumstances axial forces are only built up if a segment is 
subjected to a sufficiently large shear displacement. Material separation thus neces-
sitates the deformation of several entangled molecular coils. 
At room temperature molecular mobilities are increased and intermolecular 
attraction is decreased. The extent of plastic deformation leading to material separa-
tion is, therefore, increased rendering some of the formerly brittle plastics tough

propagation) can be obtained by bending, it occurs only in notched specimens of 
low aspect ratio or if the rate of loading is high (impact loading). In samples of HDPE 
with extremely high molecular weight (Mw > 106 ) cleavage fracture does not occur 
at all. Material separation must be enforced through large strains. Figure 8.28 gives 
an impression of the very large plastic deformation of the fracture surface of a 
notched bending specimen. The walls of the numerous rosettes and ridges are drawn 
by several hundred per cent. The energy consumed in forming new surface area is 
accordingly high. One can state that in short time loading of isotropic bulk polymers 
chain molecules do not significantly contribute to the fracture surface energy through 
the energies of bond breakage and elastic retraction. Large values of chain length and 
chain strength reduce, however, the effect of natural or artificial flaws as stress con-
centrators due to the larger amount of plastic deformation necessary before material 
separation occurs. Vice versa, at low molecular weights samples are increasingly more 
brittle, fracture surfaces are smoother, secondary fracture events are rare or absent, 
and the fracture surface energy accordingly small. 
The above considerations apply to isotropic homogeneous materials, i.e. to 
amorphous [61, 198, 200] and to semicrystailine polymers having no well defined 
microstructure [130]. There the direction of the fracture path is more or less deter-
mined by the local stress field . In any event no traces of a microstructure became 
apparent through the fracture surface morphology. This does not preclude the 
existence of a certain globular microstructure (cf. 2 I C) which can be made visible 
through ion-etching [132, 208]. Distinct fracture surface features are obtained, how-
ever, from polymers with a pronounced microstructure as introduced by extended-
chain crystallites or spherulites. There the material resistance depends strongly on 
the relative orientation of the fracture plane with respect to the structural element. 
Extended-chain crystallites have been studied by several authors (cf. 2 I C), most 
recently by Gogolewski and Pennings et al. [201 - 203].

In Figures 9.l9-9.21 electron micrographs of their replicas from the fracture 
surface of pressure crystallized polyamide 6 are reproduced [202]. The micrographs 
reveal stacks of lamellae which have a thickness of up to 700 run. The authors con-
clude from their extensive IR, W AXS, and electron microscopical studies that the 
lamellae represent extended chains. As they have proposed in Figure 9.22 a crack 
may preferentially proceed either along the (010) planes (which contain the chain 
ends as well as impurities rejected from the crystal growth front) or along the (002) 
hydrogen bonded sheets of the lamellae. Both processes do not involve the breakage 
of main chain bonds or of hydrogen bonds.

With respect to extended chain crystallization under high pressure (p > 4 kbar) 
the authors discuss two mechanisms [201-202]. Based on the observed change in 
molecular weight distribution and decrease in molecular weight concurrent with 
chain extension they suggest that the thermal treatment under high pressure makes 
possible a transamidation reaction between -NH and -CO groups of broken chain 
folds belonging to adjacent lamellae [201]. On the other hand the appearance of 
lamellae with a thickness much smaller than the average chain length has led them 
to the conclusion that fractionation is accompanying the pressure crystallization 
[202]. 
The influence of a spherulitic structure of a semicrystalline polymer on its 
mechanical properties has been implicitely and explicitely recognized for a long 
time. Only a few references can be given here [183, 204-207]. Clark and Garber

[205] review the effects of industrial processing on the morphology of crystalline 
polymers. Patel et al. [206] and Andrews [207] are especially concerned with a 
stress-strain analysis of spherulitic HDPE. They find a maximum of sample elastic 
modulus of 1.2 GN m-2 at a spherulite radius of 13 11m. Studies of the failure 
morphology of HDPE in an active environment [204] revealed 
that failure occurred almost entirely in a brittle mode 
that failure within an individual spherulite is interlamellar, and 
that the mode of crack propagation depended on the position of the spherulite 
center with respect to the crack front (leading to interspherulitic fracture in the 
case of poorly matching interfaces [204]. 
Extensive morphological studies of polypropylene fracture surfaces have been 
carried out by Menges et al. [121,136] and quite recently by Friedrich [183]. Using 
polypropylenes of different molecular weight and tacticity subjected to different 
thermal treatment Friedrich [183] obtained samples of different microstructure:

II coarse spherulites embedded in a matrix of finer spherulites 
III fully grown coarse spherulites (is up to 500 11m).

represented in Figure 9.23 a. Crazes were seen to develop ahead of the crack preferen-

logical studies Friedrich [183] derived an order of the partial material resistance 
values which decrease from that of the 
separation of finely spherulitic matrix, which is the largest, to 
straight paths through coarse spherulites and their center, 
radial and tangential planes in coarse spherulites, and 
interfaces between coarse spherulites and fine matrix, to that of 
,- polygonal interfaces between coarse spherulites.

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
The Kc values were found to decrease linearly with D, increase with decreasing 
strain rate, and increase with molecular weight, the latter effect being especially 
pronounced with the coarsely spherulitic morphology. Tentative absolute values of 
R are determined for the separation of finely spherulitic matrix as 22 kJ m-2 , and 
for interspherulitic rupture as 4 kJ m -2 [183]. The first value is of the same order of 
magnitude as that calculated by Kausch [11] for an oriented PP film (cf. further 
below). 
In the first part of this section, semicrystalline polymers (HOPE, PP, PA) have 
been discussed. The fracture surface morphology of glassy polymers has received no 
less attention in the literature. In fact many of the investigations of crazing [76-177] 
use fractography as a means to elucidate the propagation and breakdown of crazes. 
Fractographic studies of fracture processes concerning PS are especially reported in 
refs. [106,115,132,150,155,169,191,194,199], concerningPMMA in [61, 66, 
197,200], PVC in [198, 208], and PC in [196]. 
A feature common to practically all fracture surfaces of glassy polymers are the 
remnants of craze layers. At low speeds of crack propagation craze breakdown will 
generally occur in the center of the craze material leaving a more or less homogeneous 
layer on each fracture surface [15, 50,150, 194, 199]. In PS at intermediate and 
higher crack speeds decohesion at the craze/matrix interface becomes possible at 
room temperature. Beahan et al. [150] have investigated this phenomenon more close-
ly; Figure 9.25 shows their micrograph of (the rather isolated) event of a crack which

left to right in polystyrene. (Courtesy D. Hull, Liverpool). 
after having propagated at intermediate speeds was stopped in the craze region. The 
micrograph permits recognition of the decohesion of highly strained craze material at 
the interface and also the oscillation of this phenomenon between the opposite inter-
faces. The regular oscillation of the decohesion of craze material creates "mackerel 
patterns" with typical band repeat distances of between 10 and 70 11m. Hull et al. 
[150, 194, 199] discuss the dynamic conditions of their formation and the effect of 
sample temperature. They observe that at temperatures below 235 K no mackerel 
patterns are formed whereas the initiation of secondary fractures is greatly enhanced. 
A more pronounced transition from slow to fast crack propagation is reported 
for PMMA [61,66,197,200] but the surface features are roughly comparable to 
those in PS. As observed by 0611 and Weidmann [61,66] at slow crack speeds 
(li < 0.1 ms- l ), independent of molecular weight, a rather smooth fracture surface is

formed which even carries on accidental deviations from the plane in the form of 
parallel markings (left hand side of Fig. 9.26). After the transition to rapid crack 
propagation the fracture surface morphology changes completely. A pattern of ribs 
or lines running approximately parallel to the crack front becomes visible. Although 
length, direction, and spacing of the ribs are not very regular (Fig. 9.26, right hand 
side) an average spacing of 90 f.1m has been measured [61]. At a somewhat higher 
molecular weight (Mw = 163000) a spacing of about 220 f.1m is observed (Fig. 9.27, 
right hand side). At very low molecular weight (Mw = 51000) rib spacing is 20 to

24 11m [200]. In view of the symmetry of these markings on the two corresponding 
fracture surfaces, rupture of the craze material in the center plane seems to be indi-
cated. This phenomenon is somewhat different in origin, therefore, from the mackerel 
pattern but also related to the formation and breakdown of crazes. The mackerel 
pattern was caused by the oscillating occurrence of craze/matrix decohesion. The rib 
markings, however, are better interpreted as hesitation lines, also designated as stick-
slip, i.e. as the alternating development and breakdown of craze material [61,196, 
200]. This is explained by referring to the craze model presented in Figure 9.14. It 
may be assumed that at t = to the crack front just faces a fully developed craze whose 
width and length (region C) comply with the Dugdale model (Eqs. 9.18 and 9.20). 
The propagating stress field and the stresses which can be supported by the craze 
zone are momentarily in equilibrium. At t = to + ~t, however, the craze is supposed 
to open further and to support loads which are beyond the load carrying capability 
of the molecular strands. Consequently the most advanced strands break thus initiat-
ing the rupture of neighboring strands as well. The catastrophic breakdown is slowed 
down once the crack has advanced within region C so far as to reach little-drawn 
craze material. After the slow-down of crack propagation redevelopment of the craze 
begins which may be completed at, say, t = to + t 1 . Considering the average crack 
speed (v = 400 ms- 1) and the rib spacing in Figure 9.27 (220 11m) one can calculate 
that the time interval tl for catastrophic breakdown and redevelopment is 0.55I1S. 
The cyclic crack propagation seems to be influenced, however, by additional mecha· 
nisms which are not yet fully understood. 
Thus the PMMA samples having the slightly higher molecular weight reveal at 
crack speeds of 200 to 300 ms-1 a rather smooth fracture surface containing no ribs 
but a large number of parabolic markings (Fig. 9.27, left hand side). These markings 
are seen in higher magnification in Figure 9.28, they derive from the coalescence of 
primary and secondary crack fronts travelling in one craze zone but in slightly dif· 
ferent planes. The fracture surface of polycarbonate - broken in tension at room 
temperature - reveals a strikingly similar pattern [196]. In that case the distance 
between the planes of primary and secondary cracks has been found to be 0.43 11m 
at room temperature increasing to 0.75 11m at -196°C. 
Doll [61] reports that PMMA samples with a higher molecular weight 
(Mw ~ 490000) do not show ribs on the high-speed fracture surface (Fig. 9.29). 
Secondary fractures (this time in different craze zones) may be initiated, however, 
leading to parabolic markings in that surface region (Fig. 9.30). Kusy et al. [200] 
find ribs and parabolas in the molecular weight range 92000 ~ Mv < 270000. A cer-
tain molecular coil size is (quite obviously) necessary to permit the transfer of 
stresses sufficient for the initiation and temporary propagation of a secondary fracture 
plane. So far no generally valid relation between material parameters, experimental 
conditions, and morphological observations can be given. 
In the referenced literature further details are discussed which may be obtained 
from fractographic analysis, such as the effect of Wallner lines on the disposition of 
the ribs [61,196,200], "crazeless fracture" in low molecular weight PS [155], the 
retarded breakdown of crazes in fatigue (cf. III C), the ductile fracture ofPS at lower 
loading rates and at temperatures close to T g through the growth of one or more 
diamond shaped cavities [169], the globular appearance of ion·etched PS craze matter

[132] and PVC surfaces [208], and craze-like features on the surface of broken phenol-
formaldeyhde samples [195]. 
In this section the morphology of fracture surfaces has been discussed, a mor-
phology which reflects the local modes of material separation. The microscopic size 
of the structural elements to be broken or separated has been recognized: molecular 
strands, fibrils or coils, ribs, crystalline lamellae, spherulites. In talking about their 
ultimate response, however, macroscopic terms had been used: breakage, shear de-
formation, limits of plastic deformation, material resistance. For good reasons no 
molecular criteria for material separation had been given. For individual molecules 
such criteria exist: the temperature of thermal degradation and the stress or strain 
which causes the chain to scission. For the mentioned structural elements no such 
simple criteria exist. Perhaps one may mention the critical role of temperature in the 
transition to rapid crack propagation [30, 50, 184-186, 197] and the constant value of 
local strain €y in the extension direction (Fig. 9.31) which was found - independent 
of crack length - to reach about 60% at the cracktip in biaxially oriented PETP film 
[209]. One may also mention the critical concentration of chain end groups NIR 
determined by microscopic infra-red spectroscopical investigation of the near-crack 
zones of oriented PP film (Fig. 9.32) and of the fracture surface ofPE bulk material 
[210]. Both materials are tough and strong. The given stress distribution in front of 
the crack in the PP film permits calculation ofKc as a (r)yrirr = 8.3 ± 2 MN m-3/ 2 
and Gc as 30 ± 17 kJ m-2 [11]. These values, in connection with Table 9.2, indicate 
quite clearly that chain scission is accompanied by severe plastic deformation. The

possible role of chain scission during or after the application of large orientational 
strains has been discussed in detail in Chapter 8. 
B. Notched Tensile and Impact Fracture 
In Chapter 8 tensile and impact behavior of unnotched specimens have been discussed. 
The principal changes in behavior to be expected from the presence of a notch would 
have to be due to the changed state and intensity of stress in the crack tip zone, to 
the essential confinement of fracture development to a limited region, and to the 
increase in rate of local deformation. An analytical description of these effects has 
been attempted in terms of linear elastic fracture mechanics (9 I). Neglecting the 
geometrical correction term the uniaxial brittle strength of a cracked thick plate is 
derived from Eq. (9.10) as: 
(9.29) 
In this case the effect of a notch of length a is clearly indicated, therefore. In the 
general case of rupture involving plastic deformation, however, one would have to use 
Kc (or Gc) and a corrected crack length a + f(rp) in Eq. (9.29). All these quantities 
depend heavily on the degree of plastic deformation at the crack tip, which in turn is 
influenced by crack length, notch tip radius, and loading conditions. In the case of 
heavy plastic deformation the rupture stress of a specimen would depend little on 
the initial crack geometry but strongly on the "strength" of the plastically deforming 
matrix. Three questions are raised, therefore, which will be discussed in the following: 
which notch sensitivity is actually observed with different polymers, when are geo-
metrical and when are material parameters of critical importance, and what is the 
influence of chain length and mobility? 
The notch sensitivity of polymeric materials has been comprehensively investi-
gated by Takano and Nielsen [211]. The authors define a notch sensitivity factor ks 
of the yield or breaking strength of tensile bars as 
ks = °F(O) A (a) 
0F(a) A(o) 
(9.30) 
with A being the (residual) sample cross-section. In the same way a notch sensitivity 
factor k T of the energy to break (area under stress-strain curve) is defined. 
The authors tested some 40 different materials at strain rates of 2.5 mm/min for 
rigid materials and of 25 mm/min for soft elastomers employing six different crack 
geometries. The "most severe" was a single notch of 3 mm depth (in a 12 mm wide 
sample) and of 0.25 mm notch tip radius (notch s). The "least severe" was a double 
notch of 3 mm depth and 1.5 mm notch tip radius (notch d). The authors measured 
- where possible - the Izod impact strengths, the yield (OF) and breaking strengths 
(Ob), and Young's modulus of notched and unnotched specimens. 
From their measurements a sequence ofks(s) values can be established: 
PMMA (4.71), Kraton ®-1l01 (3.68), SAN (2.71), PSU (2.36), EPDM rubber (2.12) 
306 

Ill. Molecular and Morphological Aspects of Crack Propagation 
and various particle filled thermoplastics (2.14-1.33). The ks(d) values exhibit a 
similar sequence: 
PMMA (1.64), Kraton ® -11 01 « 1.69), SAN (1.62), and PPO (l.48). There are, how-
ever, quite a number of (ductile) materials with ks(s) values smaller than one, 
notably HDPE (0.88), PTMT (0.96), PTFE (0.94), PA 6 (0.93), and Hytrel ® 4055. 
Values below unity of ks(d) are more numerous than those of ks(s). 
Notch sensitivity factors for energy, kT' show a somewhat different order. With 
some rare exceptions (PP + 20% glass, PE + 40% glass) kT values are always larger 
than unity. The factor kT(S) reaches values of 625 (semi-transparent PETP), 241 (PSU), 
61 (PA 66 + 0.6% H20), 48 (PP and PMMA), and 16 to 17 (mineral filled PA 66, PC). 
For kT(d) the authors determine 81 (PA 66 + 0.6% H20), 34 (PPO), 29 (semi-trans-
parent PETP), 19 (PP), and 14 (annealed HDPE and transparent PETP). All other kT 
values measured are smaller than 13. 
The data of Pagano and Nielsen [211] confirm the observation that the presence 
of a crack not necessarily reduces the tensile strength of a sample or its energy to 
break. The authors also note that in some cases (notably in HDPE, PTMT, PTFE, 
PA 66 + 0.56% H20) the "more severe" notch s is the less dangerous and has a smaller 
kT value than notch d. The reason for this unexpected reversal is not clear but it may 
be related to the volume of polymer under elevated stress in the notched region. This 
volume at the tip of a blunt notch is larger than that at the tip of a sharp notch [211]. 
Regarding the experimental evidence (e.g. [58,64,211,214]) one may say that in 
the case of a very sharp notch (Pa < 50 tlm) the onset of rapid crack propagation is 
determined predominantly by notch length a and material fracture toughness Kc 
according to Eq. (9.29). In a blunt notch specimen, however, the tangential stress 
Oy at the root of the notch has to be considered the critical quantitiy [58, 64 ].If the 
shape of a blunt notch is approximated by an ellipse the well known Neuber-Inglis 
formula [4] can be used to calculate Oy: 
(9.31 ) 
The stress concentration increases with decreasing Pa whereas the apparent 
critical energy release rate (Gc)blunt decreases. Considering also a plastic zone of size 
rp Plati and Williams [64] obtain: 
(G ) 
= G (l + Pa/2rp)3 
c blunt 
c (1 
/)2 
+ Pa rp 
(9.32) 
Whenever the measurement of the energy to break a specimen in tension or 
flexion is used to determine critical energy release rates, it must be recognized, that 
this energy is the sum of a number of quite different terms. As outlined in 8 II A, 
the energy loss An' which a pendulum incurs in striking and breaking a specimen, is 
a measure of the elastically stored energy We, of the fracture surface energy Ws' of 
the kinetic energy W kin of the broken pieces, and of otherwise dissipated energy. 
The elastic energy to bend the specimen to a deflection 0 under load P amounts to: 
We = ~ oP = ~ P2C, with C being the bending compliance. The energy to propagate 
307 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
a crack through the ligament area is taken to be Ws = GcB(D-a). The problem of how 
these two energy terms are related to the impact strength an has first been examined 
independently and simultaneously by Brown and Marshall, Williams, and Turner [53]; 
it has recently been reviewed by Williams and Birch [69]. 
Crack propagation in a notched bending specimen becomes possible once the 
release of stored elastic energy is equal to or larger than the material resistance:

(9.33) 
The crack will propagate in an unstable manner and without additional external 
driving forces, i.e. at constant deflection, as long as the release of energy due to the 
increase in specimen compliance C remains sufficient to supply the energy needed 
for material separation, i.e. as long as 
a Gc(a) > oR(a) .

If R is taken to be constant with a Eq. (9.38) is equal to the condition for crack 
instability analyzed by Williams et al. [64,69]. 
The calibration factor cp(a/D) has been tabulated by Plati and Williams [64] for 
the two most widely used impact tests, the three point bending (Charpy) test and the 
cantilever bending (Izod) test (with aiD ranging from 0.04 to 0.60, 2 L/D from 4 to 
12). If a bending specimen fails due to unstable crack propagation then its energy to

III. Molecular and Morphological Aspects of Crack Propagation 
failure should principally correspond to the elastic energy stored at the point of onset 
of rapid crack propagation, which can be expressed now as: 
An ~ Wei = RBD1> 
(9.39) 
A plot of An over BD1> should give, therefore, a straight line with slope R = Gc. 
Testing nine different brittle and ductile polymers (from PS to PE) by the Charpy 
and the Izod methods, Plati and Williams [64] were able to arrive at fairly unique 
values of Gc (cf. Table 9.2). They point out, however, that in order to obtain linear 
BD1> plots they had to consider an effective crack length consisting of the initial 
crack length and the size of a suitably chosen plastic zone. 
If the condition for unstable crack propagation is not fulfilled or maintained 
throughout the available range of crack lengths then a continued supply of mechani· 
cal energy is necessary to propagate the crack through the material. In that case the 
failure energy An should be mainly proportional to the ligament area: 
(9.40) 
Corresponding plots of An over B (D-ao) for HiPS and ABS [53, 64, 69] revealed 
this linear relationship. 
The fact that even the rapid deformation of a glassy polymer under concentrated 
stresses entails considerable local plastic deformation immediately suggests that the 
molecular properties, which influence yielding and flow, are also effecting Gc and 
thus the impact strength. The data compiled in Table 9·11 reveal this dependency of 
Gc on temperature, rate of deformation, and molecular properties. A possible relation 
between molecular relaxation processes and fracture surface energy of polymers has 
been pointed out in many of the cited references (e.g. [14,19,22,24,25,54,63, 
64,212-214]). 
In 8 II A an account of the role of mechanical relaxation mechanisms in the 
impact loading of unnotched specimens has been given. The reasons for an expected 
positive correlation (and for the also observed deviations) between impact strength 
and magnitude of mechanical losses have been indicated there. At this point the 
molecular aspects of notched impact strength are to be investigated. Sauer [213] and 
Vincent [214] have reviewed the impact and stress-relaxation data from a large 
number of publications including their own extensive works and those referenced in 
8 11 A. They arrive at various general conclusions which may be listed in the following: 
The impact resistance rating of a polymer is generally determined by the storage 
component E' of its dynamic modulus. For some twenty different polymers tested, 
65% of the data complied with the following correlation [214]: 
Impact resistance rating 
Modulus 
-
brittle 
E' > 4.49 GN m-2 
-
brittle if bluntly notched 
E' ~ 3 GN m-2 
-
brittle if sharply notched 
E' ~ 2.2 GN m-2 
-
tough but crack propagating E' < 1.5 GN m-2 
Deviations from this scheme were either related to molecular structure (bulky side 
groups ofPMMA), to mechanical loss peaks (PTFE, HDPE, PC, PPO), to mor· 
309

phology (injection molded PP), or to heterogeneous reinforcements (short glass 
fibers, particulate fillers). 
-
Polymers with high impact strength at room temperature also have a significant 
low temperature loss peak (tan [) ~ 5 . 10-2 or higher). Polymers in this class 
include, PE, PC, PB, PTFE, PCTFE, POM, and the polyamides. 
-
Polymers with low impact strength at room temperature usually have no signifi-
cant low temperature loss peaks in the 100 K to 300 K range (PS, PMMA). 
-
Impact strengths have been measured as a function of temperature in several 
polymers and it has been shown that in many cases one gets a rise in brittle impact 
strength in the vicinity of the low temperature 'Y-relaxation (PTFE, PE, POM). 
For example, in PTFE at about 210 K, in PE at 150 K. Good correlation has also 
been observed between the magnitude of the low temperature 'Y-loss peak in poly-
sulfone and impact resistance for a series of specimens containing various amounts 
of an antiplasticizer. 
-
An increase in molecular weight will generally affect the impact strength through 
the increase in Gc ; this is most notably observed in HDPE (cf. 8 II A). 
-
In high impact polystyrene (HiPS) the normally brittle PS matrix has been blended 
with a suitable rubber-type component such as a styrene-butadiene copolymer 
which has a glass transition well below room temperature. The impact strength 
increases in proportion to the amount of the second component added. In this 
case of a two-phase polymer, however, impact resistance is increased through the 
initiation of a myriad of fine crazes and not through the generally increased 
extensibility of a homogeneously deforming matrix. 
C. Fatigue Cracks 
The characteristics of fatigue loading, i.e. of the repeated application of varying stress 
or strain amplitudes have been introduced in detail in Section 8 II C. In that discussion 
one point was left open: that of the mechanism of fatigue crack propagation. A com-
prehensive elaboration of this subject has quite recently been given by Hertzberg in 
his book on "Deformation and Fracture Mechanics of Engineering Materials" [3]. 
The reader is referred to this work or to the review articles by Plumb ridge [217] and 
Manson and Hertzberg [218] for a detailed discussion of the different stages of 
fatigue crack growth, of the distinct characteristics of fatigue fracture surfaces, of 
the various theoretical approaches to derive crack growth-rate equations, and of the 
S-N curves of a wide variety of homogeneous and fiber reinforced polymers - and 
of metals, for that matter [3, 217, 218]. At this point only some recent observations 
will be discussed which seem to be directly related to the chain-like nature of macro-
molecules [173,178,191,215-220]. 
As to be expected, the growth of a crack under constant or increasing load and 
fatigue crack propagation have quite a few features in common. Thus both the static 
and the fatigue fracture surfaces reveal a slow growth and a rapid crack propagation 
zone. The stress intensity factors reached in both cases at the transition from stable 
to unstable crack propagation correlate very well [218]. The rate of stable fatigue 
crack growth is empirically expressed by most authors in form of 
310 

III. Molecular and Morphological Aspects of Crack Propagation 
(9.41) 
with A and n material parameters and AK the applied stress intensity factor range. 
This is in complete analogy to the expression for the rate of crack propagation under 
static loading (Eq. 9.22). Marshall et al. [133] and Radon et al. [219] substitute AK 
by the difference of K2 and K3 terms. Andrews et al. [215] employ in their analysis 
of the fatigue of PE the energy release rate Gc (instead of AK) as independent param-
eter. Such approaches are not significantly different because of the relation between 
K and G and of the form of Eq. (9.41). In their detailed reports [3, 218] Hertz-
berg and Manson analyse the various theoretical approaches, furnish fatigue crack 
growth data for some 20 materials at different temperatures and frequencies, and 
discuss the effect of environmental and material parameters. 
Skibo, Hertzberg, and Manson [191] studied fatigue crack growth characteristics 
in polystyrene as a function of stress intensity factor range and cyclic frequency. 
Precracked single edge notched and compact-tension type specimens made from 
commercially available polystyrene sheet (mol. wt. = 2.7 . 105) were cycled under 
constant load at frequencies of 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 Hz, producing growth rates rang-
ing from 4 . 10-7 to 4· 10-3 cm/cycle. For a given stress intensity level, fatigue 
crack growth rates were found to decrease with increasing frequency, the effect being 
strongest at high stress intensity values. The variable frequency sensitivity of this 
polymer over the test range studied was explained in terms of a variable creep com-
ponent. The macroscopic appearance of the fracture surface showed two distinct 
regions. At low stress intensity values, a highly reflective, mirror-like surface was 
observed which transformed to a rougher, cloudy surface structure with increasing 
stress intensity level. Raising the test frequency shifted the transition between these 
areas to higher values of stress intensity. The microscopic appearance of the mirror 
region revealed evidence of crack propagation through a single craze while the appear-
ance of the rough region indicated crack growth through many crazes, all nominally 
normal to the applied stress axis. Electron fractographic examination of the mirror 
region revealed many parallel bands perpendicular to the direction of crack growth, 
each formed by a discontinuous crack growth process as a result of many fatigue 
cycles. The size of these bands was found to be consistent with the dimension of the 
crack tip plastic zone as computed by the Dugdale model. At high stress intensity 
levels a new set of parallel markings was found in the cloudy region which corre-
sponded to the incremental crack extension for an individual loading cycle [191]. 
In these experiments two chain-related phenomena have been observed: the dis-
continuous growth of a fatigue crack and the frequency sensitivity of the growth 
rate. The discontinuous growth of a fatigue crack had been noted earlier for other 
polymers as well: PVC [216], PMMA, PC, and PSU [191]. Elinck et al. [216] report 
that, depending on frequency, between 130 and 370 load cycles were necessary to 
form one "arrest line" in PVC; Skibo et al. [191] found 600 to 1400 cycles for PS. 
The width of these growth bands corresponded well to the plastic zone size rp cal-
culated from the Dugdale model. Based on these findings Skibo et al. [191 ] propose 
as a possible crack growth mechanism the gradual development of a craze of width 
rp and its subsequent and rapid breakdown. Such a mechanism would also be sup-
311 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
ported by the model of craze formation given in G II C: once the critical and fre-
quency-dependent fibril extension is reached at the crack tip cooperative breakdown 
of the fibrils occurs and the crack propagates from D/C almost to B (Fig. 9.14). 
The frequency-dependent rate of disentanglement of the molecular coils in the 
fatigued fibrils seems to account for part of the frequency effect on growth rate. 
In addition hysteresis heating occurs in the straL'led craze material. Both effects 
combine to give rise to a distinct frequency sensitivity of A for a variety of materials 
such as PC and PMMA [219, 220], and PPO,PVC,PA 66,PC,PVDF, and PSU[220]. 
As has been noted by Skibo et al. [220] the frequency sensitivity varies with tem-
perature. It reaches a maximum at that temperature where the external (fatigue) 
frequency corresponds to the internal segmental jump frequency (of the (3-relaxation 
process). 
The effects of strain amplitude, sample molecular weight, environment, and 
surface coating on the fatigue properties of PE and PS have been studied by Sauer 
et al. [173, 178]. Their results have been discussed in 8 II C. It is especially note-
worthy that the initiation of a fatigue crack can be retarded by a decade or more 
through the application of a compatible, viscous coating. A 600 molecular weight 
PS oligomer served this purpose for both polished and unpolished surfaces of cylin-
drical PS specimens [178]. 
The relation between microstructure of LDPE and fatigue crack growth was 
investigated by Andrews et al. [215]. They found growth rates according to Eq. 9.41 
in two regions: that of the initial brittle transpherulitic crack propagation and that 
of the ductile crack propagation at higher K values. Between these two regions a 
distinct transition region was found where da/dNF depended little on ~K. 
D. Mechano-Chemistry 
In a broader sense mechano-chemistry comprises all aspects of the stress-induced 
scission of chain molecules. In a narrower sense, however, one speaks of mechano-
chemical methods if one refers to the intentional mechanical degradation of (solid) 
polymers. The objectives in the latter cases are the comminution or softening of the 
material or the production of large and highly reactive surfaces as a means to initiate 
permanent chemical bonding between different polymers. In Table 9.5 an overview 
on methods and processes is given which may result in a mechanical degradation of 
chain molecules. The objectives of these processes are indicated with respect to the 
deformation mechanism. It should be pointed out that in the mechano-chemical 
methods, in the narrower sense, the degrading solids are subjected to ill defined, com-
plex states of stress leading to a deformation which always includes simultaneously 
the yielding and flowing of material and the breakage of chains. Table 9.5 lists 
the deformation mechanisms which are the most important in view of the corre-
sponding objective. Reference is made to those chapters and sections of this book 
where the particular deformation mechanisms are treated. 
In recent years a number of comprehensive review articles on the mechano-
chemistry of polymers have appeared [221-226]. A competent two-volume hand-
book by Porter and Casale on this subject [227] has just become available. The

reader is referred to these references [222-227] for any extended information on 
the effect of experimental variables (type of equipment, temperature, rate of mechani-
cal working, atmosphere) or polymer characteristics (chemical structure, initial molecu-
lar weight) on the resulting material properties. 
Within this monograph special consideration is given to the loading and breakage 
of molecular chains. With regard to mechano-chemical processes such as comminution 
or mechanical synthesis one has to study, therefore, 
the response of the polymer matrix to mechanical working 
the consequences of chain scission: reduction of molecular weight and radical 
formation 
the results of radical reactions, e.g. oxidative degradation, cross-linking, copoly-
merization. 
The property changes resulting from a mechanical treatment of polymeric 
materials have been known and utilized for a long time. Thus knowledge of the fact 
that mechanical working of natural rubber leads to its softening already dates back 
120 years [225]. But it was only after the introduction of the concept of macro-
molecules some fifty years ago that this effect of mechanical treatment was related 
to the rupture of molecular chains. The fact that the intensive milling of a hetero-
phase mixture (of rubber and maleic acid anhydride) can induce a chemical reaction 
between the components was first observed in 1941 [224]. Systematic studies of the 
nature of these chemical reactions and particularly of the role of the formed free 
radicals began about ten years later [224-225]. 
The response of polymer matrices and of chain molecules to mechanical working 
have been intensively discussed in the previous chapters. The ESR investigations of 
ground polymers (6.1V A and 7.1 C 3) have shown that in a comminution process 
(e.g. milling) chain molecules are broken in large numbers and as a consequence of 
the formation of new surface during the breaking-up of the polymer particles. The 
313 

9. Molecular Chains in Heterogeneous Fracture 
chain ruptures have an immediate and notable effect on the sample molecular weight 
M [221-338]. In Figure 9.33 M is plotted as a function of particle diameter D. The 
linear sections may be represented by a potential law 
(9.42) 
where A and n are material-related constants. Curves a and b in Figure 9.33 reveal 
that chain scission is more effective in polystyrene (n = 0.76) than in PMMA 
(n = 0.50). In both cases co~inution was carried out [228] in the presence of 
radical scavengers (N02 ) to prevent chain recombination or cross-linking. Comminu-
tion in air seems to have permitted cross-linking reactions to such an extent that the 
average molecular weight of a particle size fraction did not change with D (curve c). 
The opposite effect, decrease of M without increase of specific surface was noted by 
Komissarov et al. [222] in the dispersion of PA and PETP fibers without cooling.

(b) polymethylmethacrylate 
block copolymer in N02. 
(c) polystyrene in air. 
It is a general observation that in continuous mechanical working D (and M) do 
not decrease indefinitely but reach certain limiting values. These limiting average M 
values are of the order of the entanglement molecular weight Me. This does not 
preclude the possibility that in mechanical degradation fractions of low molecular 
weight and even volatile components can be produced [221-225]. 
The effect of environmental temperature on the rate of degradation has also been 
widely studied [221-227]. In view of the composite nature of the degradation process 
no simple rate equations can be expected. It becomes clear from Eqs. (5.41) and (7.3) 
that the softening of the matrix (decrease of ~ 0) and the reduced effective bond 
strength U(T) partly balance each other. According to an extensive review by Casale 
[226] the temperature effect on matrix rigidity seems to be the dominant one. The 
slower relaxation times at lower temperatures lead to an increase in mechanical degra-
dation with decreasing temperature (negative temperature coefficient of the overall 
mechano-chemical reaction).
