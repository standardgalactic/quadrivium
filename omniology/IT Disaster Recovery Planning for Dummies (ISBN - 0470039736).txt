IT Disaster Recovery Planning For Dummies

Foreword
I
n the late 1960s, I was first exposed to what would later become known as
disaster recovery. I was responsible for the systems software environment
for a major university computer center at the time. It was at the height of the
Vietnam War protests, and one of those protests spilled over to the building
housing the computer room. A number of the protesters were running
through the building and randomly damaging whatever was in their path.
When they got to the computer room, they found a locked, heavy steel door
and moved on.
It suddenly dawned on me that we had no clue — let alone plan — to deal
with damage or destruction, should the protesters have gained entry to the
computer room. As I thought about it and discussed this with others on the
computer operations team, I realized there were many other threats and vul-
nerabilities that had never been discussed, let alone addressed.
Fast forward forty years. The single-mainframe data center has given way to
clusters of dozens, if not hundreds, of servers and decentralized data cen-
ters; networking is often more critical than processors; dozens of computer
room operators have been replaced by lights-out data centers; a week-long
recovery from a data center disruption is now more likely to be an almost
instantaneous failover to a backup; and disaster recovery has become a fact
of life.
The bad news is that too many data center managers still have not been able
to effectively address disaster recovery, whether because of lack of manage-
ment commitment or lack of knowledge or lack of resources. By effectively,
I mean
 A comprehensive disaster recovery plan, based on objective
assessment of threats, vulnerabilities and exposure to loss
 Integration with comprehensive enterprise business continu-
ity programs so that IT disaster recovery is consistent with
overall business needs and priorities
 A meaningful exercise program, combined with training and
plan maintenance, to ensure that the plan is current, realistic,
and likely to work when called upon

IT Disaster Recovery Planning For Dummies 
xx
The good news is that with Peter Gregory’s new book, even a team without
prior experience in disaster recovery planning can address these issues — 
“ . . . those frustrated and hard-working souls who know they’re not dumb,
but find that the technical complexities of computers and the myriad of per-
sonal and business issues — and all the accompanying horror stories —
make them feel helpless,” as www.dummies.com points out.
Disaster recovery is not simply about Katrinas nor earthquakes nor 9/11
catastrophes. Sometimes, the focus on these monumental events could intimi-
date even the most committed IT manager from tackling disaster recovery
planning. Disaster recovery is really about the ability to maintain business as
usual — or as close to “as usual” as is feasible and justifiable — whatever
gets thrown at IT. Peter’s book helps to establish this perspective and pro-
vides a non-nonsense yet manageable foundation. I actually found, despite
my long involvement with business continuity and disaster recovery, that he
has identified many issues, techniques, and tips which I found quite useful.
While I confess I enjoyed Italian Wines For Dummies more, Peter Gregory’s
new book succeeds in taking the intimidation factor out of IT disaster recov-
ery and offers a common-sense, practical, yet comprehensive process for
analyzing, developing, implementing, exercising, and maintaining a successful
IT disaster recovery program — even if he has, regrettably, failed miserably
to enlighten me about Super-Tuscan wines.
Philip Jan Rothstein, FBCI, is President of Rothstein Associates Inc. (www.
rothstein.com, Brookfield, Connecticut USA), a management consultancy
focused on business continuity and disaster recovery since 1984. He has edited
or written close to 100 books and more than 200 articles, and is publisher of
The Rothstein Catalog on Disaster Recovery.

Introduction
D
isasters of many kinds strike organizations around the world on an almost
daily basis. But most of these disasters never make the news headlines
because they occur at the local level. You probably hear about disastrous events
that occur in or near your community — fires, floods, landslides, civil unrest,
and so on — that affect local businesses, sometimes in devastating ways. Larger
disasters affect wide areas and result in widespread damage, evacuations, and
loss of life, and can make you feel numb at times because of the sheer scale of
their effects.
This book is about the survival of business IT systems in the face of these
disasters through preparation and response. You’re largely powerless to stop
the disasters themselves, and even if you can get out of their way, you can
rarely escape their effects altogether. Disasters, by their very nature, disrupt
everything within their reach.
Your organization can plan for these disasters and take steps to assure your
critical IT systems survive. This book shows you how to prepare.
About This Book
IT Disaster Recovery Planning For Dummies contains a common and time-
proven methodology that can help you prepare your organization for disaster.
My goals are simple — to help you plan for and prepare your systems,
processes, and people for an organized response to a disaster when it strikes.
You can make your systems more resilient, meaning you’ll need less effort to
recover them after a disaster. By using this book as a guide, you can journey
through the steps of a disaster recovery (DR) project, as thousands of organi-
zations have done before you.
This book progresses in roughly the same sequence that you must follow if
your organization hasn’t developed a disaster recovery plan before or if
you’re about to do a major refresh of outdated or inadequate plans.

How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into four parts that you can use to quickly find the
information you need.
Part I: Getting Started with 
Disaster Recovery
In Part I, I describe the nature of disasters and their effects on businesses. In
Chapter 1, I take you on an end-to-end tour of the entire disaster recovery
planning process.
I start Chapter 2 with a discussion of the various ways that a disaster can
affect an organization and the role of prevention. I also include how to begin
planning your disaster recovery project and emergency operations planning.
Then, I show how you can quickly develop an interim disaster recovery plan
that can provide some basic protection from a disaster if one occurs before
you finish your full disaster recovery plan.
In Chapter 3, I take you on a deep dive into the vital first phase of a DR
project — creating the Business Impact Analysis, during which you discover
which business processes require the most effort in terms of prevention and
the development of recovery procedures.
Part II: Building Technology 
Recovery Plans
Part II contains the core components of the disaster recovery plan. Chapter 4
describes how you determine which systems and underlying infrastructure
support critical business processes that you identify in the Business Impact
Analysis. Chapter 5 through Chapter 8 go through the work of preventing
disaster and recovering from disaster in distinct groups — end users, facilities,
systems and networks, and data. Chapter 9 discusses details about the actual
disaster recovery plan documents — what those documents should contain
and how to manage their development.
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans
Part III focuses on what happens after you write your disaster recovery plans.
Chapter 10 discusses DR plan testing and the five types of tests organizations
often perform. Chapter 11 describes what activities you need to do to ensure
2
IT Disaster Recovery Planning For Dummies 

that your DR plans stay current. Disaster prevention is the topic of Chapter
12. If you can prevent disasters, your organization is better off. Chapter 13
discusses many disaster scenarios and what each one brings to a disaster
recovery plan.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
The much loved and revered Part of Tens contains four chapters that are more
than mere lists. These chapters contain references to external sources of
information, more reasons to develop business recovery plans, and the benefits
your organization can gain from having a well-developed recovery plan.
What This Book Is — and What It Isn’t
Every business needs to complete disaster recovery (DR) planning and business
continuity (BC) planning.
The terms DR planning and BC planning are often confused with each other,
and many people use them interchangeably. And ultimately, they’re comple-
mentary activities that you have to do before a disaster occurs (in terms of
planning), and during and after a disaster (in terms of response and business
resumption).
IT Disaster Recovery Planning For Dummies focuses on DR planning as it
relates to IT systems and IT users. In this book, I discuss the necessary steps
to develop response, assessment, and recovery plans to get IT systems and
IT users back online after a disaster.
This book doesn’t cover business continuity planning, which focuses on
generic business process resumption, as well as continuity and communica-
tions with customers and shareholders.
Assumptions about Disasters
When you think about disasters, you may think about horrific natural events,
rescue helicopters, hospital ships, airlifts, the International Red Cross or World
Vision, looting and mayhem, large numbers of human casualties, and up-to-the-
minute coverage from CNN. You may also think of wars, terrorist attacks, or
nuclear power plant explosions, and the fallout (no pun intended) that ensues.
Yes, these events certainly qualify as disasters, and this book discusses the
preparations that businesses can and should take to survive them.

Introduction

But you also have to think about the less sensational disasters that play out
almost every day in businesses everywhere — not only fires, floods, strikes,
explosions, and many other types of accidents, but also security incidents,
vandalism, and sabotage — not to mention IT system hardware and software
failures, data corruption, and errors. All of these problems can become
disastrous events that can threaten a business’s survival.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, you may notice little icons in the left margin that act
as road signs to help you quickly pull out the information that’s most important
to you. Here’s what they look like and what they represent.
Information tagged with a Remember icon identifies general information and
core concepts that you may already know but should certainly understand
and review.
Tip icons include short suggestions and tidbits of useful information.
Look for Warning icons to identify potential pitfalls, including easily confused
or difficult-to-understand terms and concepts.
Technical Stuff icons highlight technical details that you can skip unless you
want to bring out the tech geek in you.
Where to Go from Here
If you want to understand the big picture about disaster recovery planning,
go straight to Chapter 1. If your organization has no plan of any kind, Chapter
2 can help you get something started right away that you can have in place
next week. (No kidding!) If you want to dive straight into a full-blown DR pro-
ject, begin at Chapter 3.
If your organization already has a disaster recovery plan, you can turn to
Chapters 11, 12, and 13, in which I discuss the activities that you need to-
perform on an ongoing basis.

In this part . . .
T
his part introduces the technical side of disaster
recovery (DR) planning. Chapter 1 provides an
overview of the entire DR process.
Chapter 2 is for organizations that have no disaster recov-
ery plan at all. It shows you how you can make a quick
start with an interim plan that provides some protection
against disaster while you develop a more formal plan.
Chapter 3 covers the Business Impact Analysis (BIA) —
the vital first part of the formal, long-term development of
a disaster recovery plan. You use the BIA to identify the
most critical business processes — those that need disas-
ter recovery plans the most!

isaster recovery (DR) planning is concerned with preparation for and
response when disaster hits. The objective of DR planning is the survival
of an organization. Because DR planning is such a wide topic, this book focuses
only on the IT systems and users who support critical business processes.
Getting this topic alone to fit into a 400-page book is quite a challenge.
In this chapter, I describe why you need disaster recovery planning and what
benefits you can gain from going through this planning. You may be pleasantly
surprised to find out that the benefits go far beyond just planning for disaster.
I also take you through the entire disaster recovery planning process — from
analysis, to plan development and testing, to periodic plan revisions based on
business events. If you’ve never done any work in disaster recovery planning
before, this chapter’s a good place to start — you can get the entire story in
20 pages. Then, you can branch out and go to the specific topics of interest to
you elsewhere in this book.
Disaster Recovery Needs and Benefits
Stuff happens. Bad stuff.
Disasters of every sort happen, and you may find getting out of their way and
escaping their consequences very difficult. If you’re lucky enough to avoid
the direct impact of a disaster, dodging its secondary effects is harder still.

The effects of disasters
The events that I list in the preceding section have the potential to inflict
damage to buildings, equipment, and IT systems. They affect people, as well —
killing, injuring, and displacing them, not to mention preventing them from
reporting to work. Disasters can have the following effects on organizations:
 Direct damage: Many of these events can directly damage buildings,
equipment, and IT systems, rendering buildings uninhabitable and sys-
tems unusable.
 Inaccessibility: Often, an event damages a building to such an extent
that it’s unsafe to enter. Civil authorities may prohibit personnel from
entering a building, even to retrieve articles or equipment.
 Utility outage: Even in incidents that cause no direct damage, electric
power, water, and natural gas are often interrupted to wide areas for
hours or days. Without public utilities, buildings are often uninhabitable
and systems unable to function.
 Transportation disruption: Widespread incidents often have a profound
effect on regional transportation, including major highways, roads,
Here are some of the disasters that can assail an organization:

bridges, railroads, and airports. Disruptions in transportation systems
can prevent workers from reporting to work (or going home), prevent
the receipt of supplies, and stop the shipment of products.
 Communication disruption: Most organizations depend on voice and
data communications for daily operational needs. Disasters often cause
widespread outages in communications, either because of direct damage
to infrastructure or sudden spikes in usage related to the disaster. In
many organizations, taking away communications — especially data
communications — is as devastating as shutting down their IT systems.
 Evacuations: Many types of disasters pose a direct threat to people,
resulting in mandatory evacuations from certain areas or entire regions.
 Worker absenteeism: When a disaster occurs, workers often can’t or
won’t report to work for many reasons. Workers with families often need
to care for those families if the disaster affects them. Only after they take
care of their families do workers consider reporting to work. Also, trans-
portation and utility outages may prevent them from traveling to work.
Workers may also not know whether the organization expects them to
report to work if the disaster damages or closes the work premises.
These effects can devastate businesses by causing them to cease operations
for hours, days, or longer. In most cases, businesses simply can’t survive
after experiencing such an outage. Businesses supply goods and services to
customers who, for the most part, just want those goods and services; if the
customers can’t obtain those goods or services from one business, they often
simply go to another that can provide them. Many businesses don’t recover
from such an exodus of customers.
Minor disasters occur more frequently
Don’t make the mistake of justifying your lack of a DR plan by thinking,
“Hurricanes rarely visit my neck of the woods,” or “Earthquakes occur only
every one hundred years,” or “No country has ever invaded our country,” or
“Mt. Rainier hasn’t erupted in recorded history.” All of these statements may
be true. However, disasters on smaller scales happen far more frequently,
often hundreds of times more frequently, than the big ones.
Smaller disasters — such as building fires, burst pipes that flood office space,
server crashes that result in corrupted data, extended power outages, 
severe winter storms, and so on — occur with much greater regularity than
big disasters. Any of these small events can potentially interrupt critical
business processes for days. In time-critical, service-oriented businesses, 
this interruption can be a fatal blow. Contingency Planning and Management
Magazine indicated that 40 percent of companies that shut down for three
days or more failed within 36 months. An unplanned outage may be the
11
Chapter 1: Understanding Disaster Recovery

beginning of the end for an organization — everything starts to go downhill
from that point forward. That sobering thought should instill fear in you. You
might even put that chilling thought on a sticky-note and attach it to your
monitor as a reminder.
Recovery isn’t accidental
From a DR perspective, the world is divided into two types of businesses —
those that have DR plans and those that don’t. If a disaster strikes businesses
in each category, which ones will survive?
When disaster strikes, businesses without DR plans have an extremely diffi-
cult road ahead. If the business has any highly time-sensitive critical business
processes, that business is almost certain to fail. If a disaster hits a business
without a DR plan, that business has very little chance of recovery. And it’s
certainly too late to begin planning.
Businesses that do have DR plans may still have a difficult time when a disaster
strikes. You may have to put in considerable effort to recover time-sensitive
critical business functions. But if you have DR plan, you have a fighting
chance at survival.
Recovery required by regulation
Developing disaster recovery plans used to be simply a good idea. These
plans are still a good idea, but they’re also beginning to appear in standards
and regulations, including
 PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): Although
not really government legislation, it’s required for virtually every merchant
and financial services firm. PCI is a great example of what I call private
legislation — laws made by corporations instead of governments. All the
major banks and credit card companies impose PCI.
 ISO27001: This international standard for security management is gaining
considerable recognition. Many larger organizations require their IT ser-
vice providers to be ISO27001 compliant.
 BS25999: The emerging international standard for business continuity
management.
 NFPA 1620: The National Fire Protection Association standard for pre-
incident planning. It’s a recommended practice that addresses the
protection, construction, and operational features of specific occupancies
to develop pre-incident plans that responders can use to manage fires
and other emergencies by using available resources.
12
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

 HIPAA Security Rule: This U.S. law requires the protection of patient
medical records and a disaster recovery plan for those records.
Over time, more data security laws are certain to include disaster recovery
planning.
The benefits of disaster recovery planning
Besides the obvious readiness to survive a disaster, organizations can enjoy
several other benefits from DR planning:
 Improved business processes: Because business processes undergo
such analysis and scrutiny, analysts almost can’t help but find areas for
improvement.
 Improved technology: Often, you need to improve IT systems to support
recovery objectives that you develop in the disaster recovery plan. The
attention you pay to recoverability also often leads to making your IT
systems more consistent with each other and, hence, more easily and
predictably managed.
 Fewer disruptions: As a result of improved technology, IT systems tend
to be more stable than in the past. Also, when you make changes to
system architecture to meet recovery objectives, events that used to
cause outages don’t do so anymore.
 Higher quality services: Because of improved processes and technolo-
gies, you improve services, both internally and to customers and supply-
chain partners.
 Competitive advantages: Having a good DR plan gives a company bragging
rights that may outshine competitors. Price isn’t necessarily the only point
on which companies compete for business. A DR plan allows a company
to also claim higher availability and reliability of services.
A business often doesn’t expect these benefits, unless it knows to anticipate
them through its development of disaster recovery plans.
Beginning a Disaster Recovery Plan
Does your organization have a disaster recovery plan today? If not, how many
critical, time-sensitive business processes does your organization have?
If your organization has no DR plan at all, you might be thinking that even if you
start now, you can’t finish your DR plan for one or two years, leaving your
business exposed. Although that may be true, you can start with a lightweight
interim plan that provides some DR value to the organization while you
complete your full-feature DR plan.
13
Chapter 1: Understanding Disaster Recovery

Starting with an interim plan
You can develop an interim DR plan, which you design as a stopgap plan, rather
quickly. It leverages current capabilities and doesn’t address any technology
changes that you may need over the long haul.
An interim plan is an emergency response plan that answers the question, “If a
disaster occurs tomorrow, what steps can we follow to recover our systems?”
Although a full DR plan takes many months or even years to complete, devel-
oping an interim DR plan takes just two to four days from start to finish. The
procedure for developing an interim DR plan is simple: Take two or three of
the most seasoned subject matter experts and lock them in a room for a
single day. Usually, these experts are line managers or middle managers who
are highly familiar with both the critical business processes and the support-
ing IT systems. Using existing capabilities, the team develops the interim DR
plan by following these procedures:
 Build the emergency response team. Identify key subject matter experts
who can build the environment from the ground up if the business has
such a need.
 Procedure for declaring a disaster. A simple procedure that the emergency
response team can use to decide if events warrant declaring a disaster.
 Invoke the DR plan. The procedure for getting the disaster response
effort under way.
 Communicate during a disaster. Whom the disaster response team
needs to communicate with and what to say. This list of personnel might
include other employees, customers, and the news media.
 Identify basic recovery plans. Roughed-in procedures that can get critical
systems running again.
 Develop processing alternatives. Ideas on how and where to get critical
systems going, in case the building in which you now house them
becomes unavailable.
 Enact preventive measures. Steps the organization can take quickly, in
advance, to make recovery easier, as well as measures to prevent a
disaster in the first place.
 Document the interim DR plan. Write down all the procedures, contact
lists, and other vital information that the team develops during the planning
process.
 Train the emergency response team members. Train the emergency
response team members that the team chooses.
The two or three subject matter experts/managers should develop all the
points in the preceding list in one day, and then one of those people should
14
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

spend the next day typing it up. The other people review the plan to make
sure it’s correct, and then the experts take half a day to train the emergency
response team.
Don’t let the organization rely on this lightweight plan as the DR plan. It’s a
poor substitute for a full DR plan, but it can provide some disaster response
capability in the short term. The interim DR plan isn’t a full DR plan, and it
doesn’t deliver the value or confidence of a real plan. Have the experts who
create the interim DR plan review that plan every three or four months until
you complete the full DR plan. Then, you can put the interim plan in a display
case in the lobby so passers-by can see it and think, “Gee, that’s the first DR
plan the company had . . .”
Beginning the full DR project
As soon as possible after you develop the interim DR plan, you need to get the
real DR project started. The time you need to develop a full DR plan varies
considerably, based on the size of your organization, the number of critical
business functions, and the level of commitment your business is willing to make.
I estimate that developing a DR project takes three months for the very smallest
organization (less than 100 employees and only one or two critical applications)
and two years for a large organization (thousands of employees and several
critical applications). But you have many other variables besides company
size to consider. I don’t have a formula to give you because I don’t think one
exists. My advice: Don’t get hung up on timeframes — at least, not yet.
You need to take care of a number of steps before you can begin a DR project,
as I discuss in the following sections.
Gaining executive support
DR projects are disruptive. They require the best and brightest minds in the
business, taking those minds away from other projects. From a strictly finan-
cial perspective, disaster recovery planning doesn’t provide profitability, nor
should you expect the organization to become any more efficient or effective
(although both can happen).
You may find selling the idea of a DR project to management difficult. A DR
project doesn’t have a ROI (return on investment), any more than data security
does. Both disaster recovery planning and security deal with preparing for and
avoiding events that you hope never happen (and if you do your job correctly,
the fact that the events don’t happen is your return on investment!). Still, you
may need to convince management that DR planning is a worthwhile investment
for any (or all) of the following reasons:
 Disaster preparation and survival: The most obvious benefit of a
completed DR plan is the organization’s survival from a disaster —
survival that comes as a result of planning and preparation.
15
Chapter 1: Understanding Disaster Recovery

 Disaster avoidance: Disaster recovery planning often leads to the
improvement of processes and IT systems that makes those processes and
systems more resilient. Events that would result in a severe business
interruption before you had the DR plan in place become, in many cases,
just a minor event after you enact the plan. Table 1-1 includes many
examples of events and their impact on organizations with and without
DR plans.
 Due diligence and due care: Few organizations have never experienced
an accident or event that resulted in the loss of data. Neglecting the need
for disaster recovery planning can be as serious an offense as neglecting
to properly secure information. DR planning protects data against loss. If
your organization fails to exercise this due care, it could face civil or criminal
lawsuits if a preventable disaster destroys important information.

Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

Understanding the frequency of disaster-related events
Getting an accurate idea of how frequently certain disaster-related events can
occur may be difficult. Some events, such as volcanoes and tsunamis, happen
so rarely that you may find quantifying the probability, not to mention esti-
mating the impact, next to impossible. You can statistically predict other
events, such as floods, a little more easily (primarily because they occur
somewhat more frequently and predictably), but even then these events vary
in intensity and effect.
If your organization has any sort of insurance policy that covers disasters,
the insurance company might have some useful information about coverage
for disasters. Also, insurance companies may offer a premium discount for
organizations that have a disaster recovery plan in place, so you should ask
your provider whether it offers such a discount.
Civil disaster preparedness authorities in your area may have some helpful
information about the frequency and effect of disasters that occur with any
regularity in your region. Where I live, many rivers flood in the fall and
winter; earthquakes occur fairly regularly; and Mt. Rainier, an active volcano,
sits a scant 20 miles away from my residence. Perhaps your location is
blessed with hurricanes, tornadoes, or ice storms; regardless, local authori-
ties should have some clues as to the frequency and severity of natural disas-
ters in your area and how businesses can prepare for them.
Completing important first steps in a DR project
After you gain executive support, you probably just want to get started on
your DR plan. But you need to take some important first steps before you
launch your DR project:
 Create a project charter. A charter is a formal document that defines an
important project. A typical project charter includes these sections:
• Project definition
• Names of executive sponsors
• Project objectives
• Project scope
• Key milestones
• Key responsibilities
• Sources of funding
• Signatures
Chapter 16 contains a more detailed description of a DR project charter.
 Select a project manager. An individual with project management
experience and skills — someone who can develop and track the plan,
work with project team members, create status reports, run project
17
Chapter 1: Understanding Disaster Recovery

meetings, and (most importantly) keep people on task, on time, and
within budget.
 Create a project plan. A highly detailed description of all of the steps
necessary to complete the DR project — the required sequence of steps,
who’ll perform those steps, which steps are dependent on which other
steps, and what costs (if any) are associated with each step.
 Form a steering committee. The executives or senior managers who are
sponsoring and supporting the project should select members for a
formal steering committee. The DR steering committee has executive
supervision over the DR project team. While you develop the DR project,
the DR steering committee may need to meet as often as one or two
times each month, but after you complete the DR project, they probably
need to meet only two to four times each year.
After you put these initial pieces in place, you can launch the formal DR
project, which I talk about in the following section.
Managing the DR Project
Begin your DR project with a kickoff meeting that can last from one and a half
to three hours. The entire DR project team, the members of the DR steering
committee, all executive sponsors, and any other involved parties should
attend. The steering committee should state their support for the DR project.
After the initial kickoff meeting, the DR project team should probably meet
every week to discuss progress, issues, and any adjustments you need to make
to the project plan. The project manager should publish a short status report
every week that you can review in the meeting. You can send the status
report to the steering committee members to keep them up to date on how
the project is progressing.
You need to identify and manage many more details to manage a project that
spans many departments, which a DR project usually does. If you need more
details on project management, I recommend you pick up a copy of Project
Management Planning For Dummies (Wiley), by Stanley E. Portny.
The following sections discuss the sequence of events for an effective disaster
recovery planning project.
Conducting a Business Impact Analysis
The first major task in any disaster recovery project involves identifying the
business functions in the organization that require DR planning. But you also
need to conduct risk analysis of each critical business function to quantify
18
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

the effect on the organization if something interrupts each of these functions
for a long time. This activity is known as the Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
because it analyzes the impact that each critical process has on the business.
Setting the Maximum Tolerable Downtime
For each critical process, the team needs to determine an important measure —
the longest amount of time the process can be unavailable before that unavail-
ability threatens the very survival of the business. This figure is known as 
the Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD). You may measure an MTD in hours
or days.
On the surface, setting the MTD for a given process may appear arbitrary —
and, to be honest, it might be at first. Get members from the DR steering
committee involved in setting the figures for each MTD. Committee members’
somewhat arbitrary estimates may be more educated than estimates you could
get from other sources, such as senior management and outside experts.
You may run into some problems setting an MTD:
 Strictly speaking, an MTD is hypothetical. If a given business process in
the organization had been unavailable for that long, you wouldn’t be sitting
around talking about it because the business would have failed.
 You may have trouble finding valid examples of peer organizations that
failed because of a critical outage.
 You’re dealing with degrees of failure. A business could suffer a lengthy
outage, resulting in a big loss of market share that leaves the organization
a shadow of its former self. Do you consider that failure?
Setting the MTD for each critical process is at least somewhat arbitrary. But
the team has to establish some figure for each process. And don’t worry —
you can always adjust the figure if later analysis shows it’s too high or too low.
Setting recovery objectives
After you set the MTD for each critical process, you need to set some specific
recovery objectives for each process. Like the Maximum Tolerable Downtime
(which I talk about in the preceding section), recovery objectives are some-
what arbitrary. The two primary recovery objectives that you usually set in a
BIA are
 Recovery Time Objective (RTO): The maximum period of time that a
business process will be unavailable before you can restart it. For
instance, you set an RTO to 24 hours. A disaster strikes at 3 p.m., inter-
rupting a business process. An RTO of 24 hours means you’ll restart the
business process by 3 p.m. the following day.
The RTO must be less than the MTD. For example, if you set the MTD for
a given process for two days, you need to make the RTO less than two
19
Chapter 1: Understanding Disaster Recovery

days, or your business may have failed (or put failure in its destiny)
before you get the process running again! In other words, if you think
that the business will fail if a particular business process is unavailable
for two days, you must make the target time in which you plan to
recover that process far less than two days.
 Recovery Point Objective (RPO): The maximum amount of data loss
that your organization can tolerate if a disaster interrupts a critical busi-
ness process. For example, say you set the RPO for a process to one
hour. When you restart the business process, users lose no more than
one hour of work.
In the final analysis, arriving at an MTD (as well as an RTO, RPO, and so on) is
a business decision that senior management needs to make.
Developing the risk analysis
After you set recovery objectives (see the preceding section), you need to
complete a risk analysis. For each critical business process, you need to
determine the following:
 Likely disaster scenarios: List the disasters that can possibly strike.
Include both natural disasters and man-made disasters. You might end
up with quite a long list, but you don’t need to go overboard. Don’t get
too detailed or list highly unlikely scenarios, such as a tsunami in
Oklahoma City or an alien spaceship crash landing.
 Probability of occurrence: The probability of each scenario actually
happening. You can use a high-medium-low scale, or you can get more
detailed if you want.
 Vulnerabilities: Identify all reasonable vulnerabilities within each busi-
ness process. Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that contribute to the likeli-
hood that an event such as a flood or earthquake will result in a
significant outage.
 Mitigating steps: For each vulnerability you list, cite any measures that
you can take to reduce that vulnerability.
The risk analysis takes quite some time to complete, even for a smaller-
organization that has only a handful of critical business processes.
You may be able to take a shortcut in the risk analysis: Instead of developing
a list of all disaster scenarios for every business process, you may want to list
all scenarios for each business location.
Seeing the big picture
After you complete the MTD, RTO, RPO, and risk analysis for each business
process, you need to condense the detailed information down to a simple
spreadsheet so you can see all the business processes on one page, along
with their respective MTD, RTO, RPO, and risk figures.
20
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

If you sort the list by RTO, you can see which processes you need to recover
first after a disaster. If you sort by RPO, you can see which processes are the
most sensitive to data loss.
You can add a column on your big-picture spreadsheet that expresses the
cost or effort you need to upgrade each process so that you can recover it in
the timeframe set by its RTO and RPO. You can express these needs roughly
by using symbols such as $, $$, $$$, and $$$$, where each $ represents thou-
sands of dollars. A $ represents thousands of dollars, $$ means tens of thou-
sands, and so on.
With this high-quality spreadsheet, you can easily see all critical business
processes and the key measures for each. When you rank the processes, you
can instantaneously see which processes are the most critical in the organi-
zation. Those critical processes — of course — require the most work in
terms of disaster recovery planning.
Time for decisions: In or out
Sometimes, a DR team can become overwhelmed by the number of critical
processes and the cumulative estimated cost of getting each process to a
point at which the organization can recover it within the targeted timeframes.
And if the team isn’t intimidated by the cost, they may be daunted by the
sheer number of IT applications that require work. In this situation, I suggest
several remedies:
 Revise recovery objectives. When you see the recovery objective and
the estimated investment side by side, senior managers can make some
decisions about a reasonable amount of investment for a given process.
Early estimates can place the cost of upgrading recoverability at a
higher figure than the value of the process itself. Senior managers or
executives can help to place limits on what you can reasonably spend.
 Combine recovery capabilities. You can probably combine the investment
for improving the recovery time for several applications, which can reduce
costs. For instance, investment in a single large storage system costs far
less than separate storage systems.
 Sharpen those estimates. The project team can do more detailed work
on the investments required to improve recovery times for applications
by drawing up actual architectures and plans and then obtain actual
estimates for investment. If you proceed with those investments, you
need those more detailed numbers, so you can prepare these more accu-
rate figures now and save yourself time later in the DR planning process.
 Make a multi-year investment in recovery. After obtaining accurate
estimates for improving application recovery, you may reasonably plan
for a multi-year investment that improves the most critical applications
in the first year and less-critical applications in subsequent years. Or
you can use staged investments to incrementally improve recoverability.
21
Chapter 1: Understanding Disaster Recovery

For example, if critical applications’ RTO is 24 hours, investment can
improve applications’ RTO to 48 hours in the first year and to 24 hours
in the second year.
 Do the most critical now and the rest later. The team can draw a line on
the chart, handling processes above the line (those that are most critical)
in the current project and processes below the line (those that are less
critical) in future DR projects.
DR teams often find that their first set of RTO and RPO figures are just too
ambitious, perhaps even unrealistic. You may need to revise the objectives and
the investment requirements up or down until you reach reasonable figures.
Chapter 3 describes the end-to-end development of a Business Impact
Analysis in detail.
Developing recovery procedures
After the DR planning team agrees on recovery objectives (primarily RTOs
and RPOs) and chooses the list of in-scope processes, you need to develop
disaster recovery procedures for each process.
Mapping in-scope processes to infrastructure
Before you can start preparing actual recovery procedures for applications,
you need to know precisely which applications and underlying infrastructure
support those processes. Although you probably did some of that work when
you made cost estimates for recovery in the BIA (which I talk about in the
section “Conducting a Business Impact Analysis,” earlier in this chapter), you
need to go into more detail now.
Many organizations have equipment and component inventories, so you can
use those inventories as a good place to begin. Getting an accurate inventory of
all equipment and then mapping that inventory to individual business processes
definitely takes some time. But without this information, how can you approach
the task of developing a viable recovery plan for a business process?
You can find inventory information and get a better understanding of applica-
tions’ system support from technical architectures, especially drawings and
specifications. Technical architectures give you an invaluable look at how
systems and infrastructure actually support a business process. If these
architectures don’t exist for your organization, consider developing them
from scratch.
When you know all the parts and pieces that support an application, you can
begin developing plans for recovering that application when disaster strikes.
22
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

Developing recovery plans
When you think about it, you have to do an amazing amount of up-front work
and planning before you can take pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) and
begin drafting actual recovery plans. But you do eventually get to the plan-
writing point.
Disaster recovery has many aspects because you may need to recover differ-
ent portions of your environment, depending on the scope and magnitude of
the disaster that strikes. Your worst case scenario (an earthquake, tornado,
flood, strike, or whatever sort of disaster happens in your part of the world)
can probably render your work facility completely damaged or destroyed,
requiring the business to continue elsewhere. So, you can logically approach
DR planning by considering recovery for various aspects of the business and
infrastructure:
 End users: Most business processes depend on employees who perform
their work functions. Those employees’ workstations may need recov-
ery after a disaster. In the worst case scenario, all those workstations
are damaged or destroyed (by water, volcanic ash, or whatever), and
you have to get new ones somehow. Chapter 5 discusses user recovery
in detail. Employees also need a place to work, but because this book
primarily focuses on IT and systems recovery, where you put the
employees’ replacement workstations is beyond the scope of this book.
When you develop contingency plans for locating critical servers,
include work accommodations for your critical employees, also.
 Facilities: You need to recover the building(s) in which your organization
houses its IT systems. If those buildings are damaged, you need to repair
them. But if they’re beyond repair, you need to identify alternate facili-
ties. No, don’t go shopping for space during a disaster — you have to
work it all out in advance. Do you need a cold, warm, or hot site? You need
to consider that and may more details. I cover all these considerations in
exquisite detail in Chapter 6.
 Systems and networks: The core of IT system recovery is the servers
that applications use to do whatever they do. In worst case scenarios,
servers are damaged beyond repair, so you need to build them from
scratch. And no server is an island, so you also need to recover a
server’s ability to communicate with other servers and end-user work-
stations. Chapter 7 goes into these tasks in detail.
 Data: Data is the heart of most business applications. Without data,
most applications are practically worthless. You may find recovering
data tricky because data changes all the time, right up until the moment
a disaster occurs. You can recover data in many different ways, depending
on how much data you need to recover, how quickly that data changes,
and how much data you can stand to lose when a disaster strikes. I
cover data recovery in its entirety in Chapter 8.
23
Chapter 1: Understanding Disaster Recovery

 Preventive measures: Within the context of developing recovery plans,
you have many opportunities to improve applications, systems, net-
works, and data to make them more resilient and recoverable. An ounce
of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and this saying really does apply
to disaster recovery planning. You can prevent or minimize the effects of
a disaster by taking certain measures, and you should identify those mea-
sures. I cover the topic of prevention in Chapter 5 through Chapter 8, as
well as in Chapter 12.
Writing the plan
As you prepare to actually develop and document the recovery plans for the
components that support critical business processes, you should know what
exactly goes into a plan, how to structure it, and how to manage the contents
of the plan.
A disaster recovery plan should include the following sections:
 Disaster declaration procedure
 Emergency contact lists and trees
 Emergency leadership team members
 Damage assessment procedures
 System recovery and restart procedures
 Transition to normal operations
 Recovery team members
After you write the plan, you need to publish it in forms that make it available
to recovery personnel. You can’t just put the DR documents on your organiza-
tion’s intranet or the file server because the intranet may be down and the file
server unreachable when the disaster strikes. In order to make DR plans avail-
able and usable, you need to distribute them in multiple forms (including hard
copy, CD-ROM, USB drive, and so on) so emergency response personnel can
actually access those plans from wherever they are, without having to depend
on the same IT systems that they may be expected to recover.
I cover the details on writing DR plans and more in Chapter 9.
Testing the plan
After you develop the DR plan, you need to put it through progressively
intense cycles of testing. If an organization needs to trust its very survival to
the quality and accuracy of a disaster recovery plan, you need to test that
plan to be sure that it actually works. In disasters, you rarely get second
chances.
24
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

You need to do several types of tests:
 Paper tests: Staff members review and annotate written procedures on
their own.
 Walkthrough tests: A group of experts walks and talks through a recovery
procedure, discussing issues along the way.
 Simulations: A group of experts goes through a scripted disaster scenario
to see how well the procedures work.
 Parallel testing: The recovery team builds or sets up recovery servers and
runs test transactions through those servers to see if they actually can.
 Cutover testing: The ultimate test of preparedness. The recovery team
builds or sets up recovery servers and puts the actual business process
workload on those systems.
These tests move from simple reviews of DR procedures to simulations to the
real thing.
Chapter 10 covers DR plan testing in detail.
Understanding the Entire DR Lifecycle
After you write and fully test the DR plan, you’re still not done. Business
processes and IT systems change with regularity, almost as often as the sun
rises and sets. In even a short period of time, disaster recovery plans can get
out of sync with the systems they’re supposed to protect, and after enough
time, the DR plans have little value.
The time spent on the original DR plan will be a waste if you don’t update
that plan!
Disaster recovery planning is a lifecycle proposition: After you establish a DR
plan, you need to regularly review, revise, and test that plan.
I discuss all the topics outlined in the following sections in Chapter 11.
25
Chapter 1: Understanding Disaster Recovery

Changes should include DR reviews
To protect and preserve the value and relevance of your DR plan, you need to
modify the plan’s coverage of several business processes when changes
occur to these processes:
 Technology changes
 Business changes
 Personnel changes
 Market changes
 External changes
When any of the events in the preceding list occur in your organization, you
need to review and revise your DR plan so that the plan stays up to date and
can continue to protect the business.
Periodic review and testing
Establish a calendar of review and testing to ensure that your DR plans are up
to date. For instance, set up a calendar for your disaster recovery procedures
like this list:
 Review monthly
 Walkthrough test quarterly
 Parallel or cutover test annually or semi-annually
How often you perform these reviews and tests depends on many factors,
including the value and risk associated with supported business processes
and the rate of change that occurs.
Training response teams
The stakes are high in disaster recovery planning: The survival of the business
may hang in the balance if disaster strikes. Periodically train the likely disaster
response team members on recovery procedures. In fact, you should train even
staff members who aren’t likely to end up on the disaster response team —
you never know who’ll be available when a disaster hits.
26
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

Training, if you do it right, doesn’t overburden personnel. Because you should
perform testing regularly, that testing can serve as the bulk of the training effort.
By including the right personnel in paper tests, walkthrough tests, simulations,
parallel tests, and cutover tests, you train them simply by exposing them to
the recovery plans in these levels of testing.

Bootstrapping the DR Plan Effort
In This Chapter

 Emergency operations planning
 Developing and testing an interim plan
P
utting a full disaster recovery (DR) effort into place for your organization
can take a year or two, from inception, to Business Impact Analysis, to
plan development and testing. A proper DR project must wrap its arms around
the entire business (or, at any rate, around those parts of the business you
choose to place in-scope for the project because they’re important enough to
warrant DR planning); perform a deep analysis of business processes; untangle
and analyze dependencies among processes, information systems, assets, and
suppliers; and begin building the DR plans themselves.
A DR project is a considerable effort for you to start — and complete. You
can take some different approaches to get started. You might think of these
approaches as differences in styles, or as ways of addressing operational
gaps or risks:
 Conduct a full DR project. You can just jump into the big DR project,
starting with the Business Impact Analysis (BIA), criticality analysis, 
risk analysis, and specific recovery plans for IT systems.
 Start with a short-term project. Then again, you might decide to 
build an emergency operations plan first, just in case a disaster occurs
before you complete the main DR plan. Creating an emergency operations
plan — basically, an established command-and-control structure and a
communications plan without any actual recovery procedures — can
help you identify and document top-down management structures and
communications that need to take place during a disaster.

 Develop an interim plan. You might build an interim DR plan that
addresses specific steps you can take to get the IT systems that support
critical business processes up and running as soon as possible. An interim
DR plan isn’t a full plan, and it’s not a substitute for one, but it does pro-
vide you with some protection in case a disaster strikes before you finish
the full DR plan.
In this chapter, I give you things to consider about how to approach DR plan-
ning for your organization. Then, I describe the critical resources that you
need for DR planning and how to conduct emergency operations planning
and interim DR planning.
Starting at Square One
Before beginning a DR planning effort, you need to imagine what effects a disa-
ster would have on your organization. DR planning is about preventing and
responding to disasters, and to properly plan, you need to know what to plan
for. The following sections take a look at the effects of disasters, and how you
can use prevention and planning to reduce the effects of those disasters.
How disaster may affect your organization
Think about disasters that have occurred in your region of the world. Consider
the immediate effects that the disaster had: Perhaps the disaster damaged
communications facilities; interrupted public utilities, such as electricity or
natural gas, for hours or days; or damaged transportation systems, such as
roads, railways, and airports.
Now, consider secondary effects of the disaster. When a disaster interrupts
major infrastructure facilities, such as communications, transportation, and
energy, your business’s ability to function is greatly impaired. Workers can’t
travel and report to work. Customers can’t travel to company premises or
visit those companies online.
If a disaster’s effects are relatively short-lived (meaning only hours or a few
days), most businesses can recover. The organization can satisfy pent-up
demand for services when it resumes its most critical business processes,
usually those processes directly associated with revenue generation or 
customer service.
30
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

If a disaster’s effects are more persistent, customers may temporarily divert
their demand for goods and services to other suppliers (if other suppliers are
available). The nature of the goods or services that an organization provides
helps determine whether that organization can recover from a disaster that
lasts for more than a few days.
Understanding the role of prevention
You can’t prevent either natural disasters or man-made disasters. However,
you can somewhat control the impact that a disaster has on your organization’s
operations by reducing the disaster’s impact on the business.
In disaster recovery planning, prevention means enacting measures in advance
that lessen or eliminate the effects that a disaster can have on critical business
processes. Here are some examples:
 Emergency power: An organization may be able to mitigate the effects
of a disaster by investing in emergency power generation equipment
that can produce electricity, even when public utilities are unavailable
for several days or longer.
 Multiple communications paths: If you recognize that disasters often
cause communications disruptions, you may be able to mitigate this risk
by investing in secondary and tertiary communications capabilities that
may continue functioning, even if primary facilities are damaged.
 Backup computers in another city: A business that services customers
over the Internet may be able to provide those services from virtually
anywhere, if those capabilities were designed-in from the beginning.
Although none of the measures in the preceding list prevent disasters, those
measures can help an organization continue operating after a disaster takes
place. All of these measures require advance planning and investment. The
time to equip an ocean liner with life jackets is before it leaves port, not after
the ship starts sinking.
Understanding the role of planning
The preceding section talks about measures that you can take to lessen the
effects of disasters. These measures are the essence of disaster recovery
planning. Planning for scenarios in advance, and preparing for them through
investment in equipment and training, constitute the bulk of DR planning.
31
Chapter 2: Bootstrapping the DR Plan Effort

The planning part of DR planning involves figuring out what personnel should
do when a disaster strikes. When the earthquake, tsunami, hurricane, land-
slide, or labor strike hits, what do people need to do to keep critical systems
running? If a processing center floods, destroying equipment, how can the
organization continue to keep its critical IT systems running? These and many
other scenarios require advance planning so emergency operations personnel
know how to keep those systems going.
Advance planning is the key to survival when disaster strikes.
Resources to Begin Planning
To get your disaster recovery project going, you need resources from many
different parts of the business. The project requires people with a wide variety
of skills, as well as a lot of information — and to get that information, you need
to involve even more people.
Starting a DR project is no small task. Disaster recovery planning is compli-
cated and multi-disciplinary. It’s likely to be one of the larger projects that
most organizations undertake, and it brings together many people who don’t
normally associate with each other. For these and other reasons, you need
many important resources before you start a DR project:
 Executive sponsorship: A senior manager or executive who’s willing to go
on record to say, “Disaster recovery planning is so important that we need
to complete it by this date.” In other words, you need to find someone
who’s willing to put their money where their mouth is!
 Budget: In the early stages of a DR project, you need money for a project
manager, technology experts, process experts, or supplemental help for
departments as they divert resources away from their usual business to
the DR project. In the later stages of the project, you spend money on
technology improvements that you need to support recovery objectives.
 Project manager: You need a strong project manager for a multi-
disciplinary project that can involve dozens of people or more, such as
disaster recovery planning. You can have a part-time or full-time project
manager, depending on the number of people and activities involved.
 Subject matter experts: You need experts in the business processes 
that the organization has in play, particularly those processes that earn
revenue or service customers. You also need technology experts who
understand the IT applications and infrastructure that support those
processes.
32
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

 People with writing skills: Later phases of DR projects require people
who can write processes and procedures in a way that anyone can under-
stand. You never know who might end up on a disaster response team.
A typical DR project can take anywhere from three months (for the smallest
organization) to well over a year to complete. How quickly you get a DR plan
in place depends on how high a priority you need to make it and how much
extra money you have available for outside help.
If you really don’t have a good handle on the amount of resources that you
may need for your project, here are a couple of suggestions:
 Hire a consultant. Bring in an experienced DR consultant, just for a
short term engagement (no more than a few days), to have a look
around and give you some thumbnail estimates on project sizing.
A consultant who says he or she needs a month to give you these esti-
mates either doesn’t understand that you want only rough estimates or
just wants the billable hours.
 Develop an interim DR plan. You should develop an interim DR plan,
anyway, but by writing this plan, you can get additional exposure on the
number of critical processes, systems, suppliers, and so on in your busi-
ness. That information can help you estimate the size and scope of the
real DR plan.
If you’re thinking about starting with the full-blown DR plan, turn to Chapter 3
and begin putting together your Business Impact Analysis. If you’re considering
an interim DR plan, start with the following section.
Emergency Operations Planning
After a disaster strikes, the disaster response team begins to perform its vari-
ous tasks that relate to the assessment, restart, and recovery of the critical IT
systems that support critical business processes. Disaster response involves
more than just those people who are recovering systems, however. Other dis-
aster response personnel have to perform a variety of activities, including com-
municating with customers, company management, suppliers, and partners. 
As the disaster response unfolds, a lot of people are working, communicating,
and making decisions. Controlling all of these activities requires considerable
management, leadership, and planning. Emergency operations planning is the
portion of disaster recovery planning associated with the setup and operations
of emergency operations during and immediately after a disaster.
33
Chapter 2: Bootstrapping the DR Plan Effort

You often undertake emergency operations planning in the early stages of 
disaster recovery planning. The primary purpose of emergency operations
planning is to ensure that company management can continue managing day-
to-day business operations, including disaster response efforts, during and
immediately after a disaster.
An emergency operations plan may include
 Emergency contact lists: Key personnel need to know how to contact
one another when a disaster strikes.
 Disaster declaration procedure: Key personnel need to know how to
recognize when an event has disrupted key business activities enough to
initiate disaster response.
 Emergency communications: Communications procedures, contact
information for additional staff and resources, and perhaps scripted
communications to customers or shareholders.
Your emergency operations plan may also include establishing an Emergency
Operations Center (EOC). Larger organizations often set up such an emer-
gency command and control center as the nerve center for their emergency
operations during a disaster.
Preparing an Interim DR Plan
Most organizations can immediately recognize the risks associated with the
absence of a disaster recovery plan. If you know that you can’t have a full DR
plan in place and tested for more than a year, you may want to have some-
thing in place while you complete the full DR plan.
Often, an interim DR plan can fill this gap. You can create this plan quickly
and with minimal effort. It isn’t, of course, as comprehensive as a full DR plan.
It’s like tossing a tow rope in the back of a car, knowing that you need major
engine work — the rope can’t fix the engine, but it can help you out of a bad
situation if the engine goes belly-up.
The following sections describe one way to build an interim DR plan. Here are
the general characteristics of an interim plan:
 It’s built quickly, usually in less than 15 to 20 man-hours.
 It’s built with a relatively low amount of effort.
34
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

 It provides your business with some limited capabilities if a disaster
strikes before you complete the full DR plan.
 It’s no substitute for the full DR plan that your organization is (or should
be) working on.
Why should you build an interim plan? Well, statistically speaking, disasters
strike infrequently — but they do strike. For example, if your organization is
located in a 50-year flood plain (such plains invariably seem to flood every
ten years or so — why is that?), the chances are 1 in 25 that a flood will strike
in the next two years, before you complete your DR plan for dealing with the
flood. Your interim plan addresses what to do if the flood happens in the next
two years. It helps keep your business afloat (no pun intended) — but it’s not
a replacement for a real DR plan.
When you make an interim DR plan, you’re developing only a lightweight 
DR plan.
Staffing your interim DR plan team
The members of senior or executive management who are sponsoring the full
DR effort should select two or three experienced and knowledgeable managers
to build the interim DR plan. These managers must have pragmatic and hands-
on knowledge of the business operations and processes currently in place.
I call this group the interim DR planners.
Find the interim DR planners an office or a conference room, and provide
them whiteboard space, a couple of notebook computers, and about a day’s
worth of food.
Looking at an interim DR plan overview
The interim DR planners’ objective is to put together an interim DR plan that
consists of the following:
 An Emergency Response Team (ERT), a group of individuals who 
are called into action if a disaster strikes
 A procedure for declaring a disaster, during or outside normal 
working hours
 A procedure for invoking the interim DR plan
35
Chapter 2: Bootstrapping the DR Plan Effort

 A plan for maintaining communications during a disaster
 Identifying some basic recovery requirements for the business premises
 Determining alternative ways to continue critical business operations
during a disaster
 Identifying preventive measures to protect business information,
records, and critical assets in a disaster
 Documenting the interim DR plan and making sure that all of the team
members have copies of it readily available, regardless of where they are
 Identifying an off-site location where you can store the interim DR plan
 Ensuring that the Emergency Response Team is familiar with the interim
DR plan and can implement it in a disaster
Creating the interim DR plan should take no more than one or two days of
dedicated time from the two or three people on the interim DR planning
team. The team may, however, need to spend a few hours a day over a period
of a week or two to put this plan together.
Building the Interim Plan
Your interim DR planning team is assembled, and they have ample food and
caffeine to support their development of the interim DR plan. Now what do you
do? The following sections describe the steps that the interim DR planners
need to do to get the interim DR plan built. The steps are as follows:
1. Build the Emergency Response Team.
2. Define the procedure for declaring a disaster.
3. Invoke the DR plan.
4. Maintain communications during a disaster.
5. Identify basic recovery plans.
6. Develop processing alternatives.
7. Enact preventative measures.
8. Document the interim DR plan.
9. Train ERT members.
36
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

Step 1 — Build the Emergency 
Response Team
The interim DR planners first identify a team of individuals within the organi-
zation who can be called into action, any time of the day or night, when a 
disaster strikes. This team is called the Emergency Response Team (ERT).
The interim DR planners choose the ERT members from among the general
staff population, taking the following into consideration when making 
their choices:
 ERT members have management authority.
 ERT members (for the most part) reside close enough to the business
premises that they can most likely get themselves there if a disaster
strikes.
 ERT members are reachable in the event of a disaster. They have more
than one means of communication available (for instance, a home phone
and a cellphone).
 ERT members are familiar with present business processes and the 
technology that supports those processes.
 ERT members need to know how individual employees get their jobs
done from day to day, in grisly detail.
A disaster can disrupt transportation and communications infrastructure, kill
or injure staff members or their family members, and damage staff members’
property. For any of these (and other) reasons, staff members may be unavail-
able for short or long periods of time after a disaster. So you should select at
least one alternate staff member for each member on the Emergency Response
Team. Treat these alternate team members as full team members because you
might have to call them into action when a disaster occurs.
Step 2 — Define the procedure 
for declaring a disaster
The interim DR planners need to figure out how the ERT members will
declare a disaster. When they declare a disaster, they launch the interim DR
plan into action.
37
Chapter 2: Bootstrapping the DR Plan Effort

Determine the Maximum Acceptable Outage Time (MAOT) in advance of a
disaster — the MAOT may be a period ranging from a few hours to several
days or more. The MAOT is the longest period of time between the onset of 
a disaster and the resumption of a critical business process. The ERT should
assess the disaster and determine whether your business’s critical processes
will likely exceed the MAOT. If the ERT (Emergency Response Team) thinks
you’ll exceed the MAOT, the ERT should declare a disaster.
Knowing when to declare a disaster isn’t really difficult, but it isn’t obvious,
either. Say that a region has experienced a severe wind storm. This sort of nat-
ural event usually takes place over a period of several hours. In such an event,
storm damage may be highly localized: Buildings may be damaged, power may
be disrupted by trees falling into power lines, and some roads may be closed.
But you may not immediately know whether the wind storm has caused direct
damage to the business premises to such an extent that your business can’t
perform its normal functions. The business premises themselves may not be
damaged at all, but a wind-caused prolonged power outage may prevent the
business from operating. Or road closures may prevent employees from being
able to report to work, which can also precipitate a disaster.
If you face this sort of situation, allow the ERT to decide whether to declare a
disaster. When a man-made or natural event occurs that may disrupt or impair
business operations, the ERT members should communicate with one another,
perform a quick assessment (for example, determine whether the building is
damaged, electric power is still running, employees will be able to report to
work, and so on), and make a judgment call as to whether the business should
initiate the interim DR plan.
Empowering two or more ERT members with the ability to declare a disaster
is a simple and reasonable approach.
38
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 
What is a disaster declaration?
Declaration of a disaster is not the simple recog-
nition that a destructive man-made or natural
event has occurred. For example, a tornado tear-
ing through town, a terrorist attack, or a severe
wind storm doesn’t equal a disaster. These events
may be related to a disaster, but they aren’t the
disaster by themselves.
A disaster occurs when a natural or man-made
event causes a significant disruption to, or com-
pletely stops, business operations. More than that,
even, a disaster occurs when the ERT says so.

Step 3 — Invoke the interim DR plan
After the ERT decides that the MAOT (Maximum Acceptable Outage Time)
has been exceeded for critical processes, it invokes the interim DR plan.
Here’s what you need to do to get your DR plan up and running:
1. Appoint one of the ERT members to make entries in a logbook.
Make sure that member takes note of the following:
• Overall description of the event that has occurred
• Damage to premises, assets, systems, and communications facilities
• Personnel available, and personnel missing, injured, or deceased
2. Arrange an initial emergency meeting.
The team needs to do the following:
• Appoint an ERT leader.
• Assign other roles, such as damage assessment and communica-
tions.
• Establish an Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
3. Make decisions.
The ERT needs to determine whether sufficient personnel remain 
to relocate to another site, for instance.
4. Initiate recovery plans.
The ERT needs to begin performing the recovery plans that the interim
DR plan outlines.
Depending on the type of business and the nature of the disaster, the ERT
may operate continuously, or in shifts.
Step 4 — Maintain communications
during a disaster
At this point, two or more ERT members have determined that business-
disrupting events have taken place, signaling the start of DR activities. In 
this section, I describe some things that can help an ERT during a disaster 
situation.

Chapter 2: Bootstrapping the DR Plan Effort

When the ERT first convenes to discuss and declare the disaster (which I talk
about in the preceding section), the team members have already overcome 
a number of potential challenges, including dealing with communications out-
ages (which can make it difficult for the ERT members to reach one another).
In many disaster scenarios, communications networks are damaged and/or
usage spikes create congestion, making it difficult for ERT members to reach
one another.
The likelihood that communications will be congested calls for some communi-
cations contingencies:
 Have at least two different phone numbers for each ERT member.
 Make sure ERT members are on several different phone networks so that
an outage in any one network won’t affect communications to all ERT
members.
 Avoid depending on only one wireless communications provider.
 Avoid putting the organization’s phone system (PBX), voice mail, e-mail,
and conferencing capabilities on the critical path. (In other words, try to
avoid communications bottlenecks brought about by the disaster.)
 Use non-company e-mail as an alternative to company e-mail, in the
event that company e-mail servers are unavailable.
 Use Instant Messaging (IM) as a supplemental means of communication.
 Use cellphone text messaging as a supplemental means for transmitting
status updates.
 Set up emergency teleconference bridges in advance of a disaster.
A teleconference bridge is a phone service that permits several people to
participate in a group phone call. Include a second teleconference bridge
that uses a different provider in case the primary teleconference bridge
provider is unreachable. You can find many teleconference bridge
providers online.
Some of these contingencies take a bit of time to set up. During the develop-
ment of the interim DR plan, the team should agree on which communications
contingencies are appropriate for their organization.
Also, print at least a portion of each ERT member’s contact info on small,
laminated cards and give one to each ERT member. With this card, each ERT
member has this contact information close at hand when a disaster strikes. 
I discuss contact-information cards in more detail in the section “Emergency
contact information,” later in this chapter.

Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

Step 5 — Identify basic recovery plans
This step takes you closer to the meat in the sandwich — identifying basic
recovery plans that the interim DR planners need to write. In the preceding
sections, you create the Emergency Response Team (ERT), work on the proce-
dure for declaring a disaster, and discuss issues related to communications
during a disaster.
The approach I suggest in this section is a little more methodical than those
in preceding sections. Follow these steps:
1. Identify all business functions in the organization.
Start at a high level by listing the basic functions (products/services,
invoice customers, customer support, process payments, and so on).
2. Develop a list of business processes that make up the business functions
you identify in Step 1.
3. Rank this list, placing the most critical processes at the top of the list.
You probably need to spend at least half an hour on the preceding steps. 
You don’t need to hurry — take your time and consider all of the functions
performed in your organization. A typical organization’s high-level list might
look something like this:
 Marketing
 Sales
 Support
 Operations
 Shipping and Receiving
 Legal
 Facilities
 Information Technology (IT)
 Engineering
 Human Resources (HR)
Use a copy of the company organization chart (if you have one) to help 
identify all of the major functions in your organization. You can also use the
organization directory, brochures, e-mail distribution lists, and so on in this
identification process.
41
Chapter 2: Bootstrapping the DR Plan Effort

After you create your list of business processes, follow these steps:
1. Identify which processes you need to restart as soon as possible after
a disaster occurs.
2. For each process, identify how soon you need to restart the process
after a disaster.
3. For each process, identify what resources you need to restart the
process.
Here are some issues to consider when you go through the preceding 
numbered list:
 Depending on the type of disaster, only a small fraction of the normal
staff may be available.
 Suppliers and other supply chain partners may have difficulty maintaining
service levels that your organization’s critical processes require.
 Avoid listing too many critical processes that you must start at the same
time. Pace your plans to restart critical processes because many kinds
of resources may be limited.
 Depending on the nature of your organization’s business activities,
demand for your business’s goods and services could dramatically rise or
fall (or it may not be affected at all). For instance, a store selling bottled
water is in high demand after almost any kind of natural disaster, whereas
a business that manufactures party supplies may see a drop in business.
 Communications will be impaired, impacting the ability to restart critical
processes, as well as communications with customers and supply chain
partners.
Your final list of processes that you need to restart soon after a disaster
should take into account the issues in the preceding list. Don’t develop an
overly-ambitious list of processes to start immediately after a disaster — 
you probably won’t be able to actually get them up and running because of 
a lack of personnel and other resources.
In interim DR planning, you’re developing only lightweight DR plans.
Step 6 — Develop processing alternatives
In many disaster scenarios, you may not be able to restart critical processes.
If the systems or assets you need to support a critical process are damaged or
destroyed, or if critical personnel are simply unavailable, starting the critical
process in the location affected by the disaster just may not be possible — at
least, not right away.
42
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

The interim DR planners need to identify nearby locations where critical busi-
ness operations can resume in the event of a highly-localized disaster such as
a fire, in which buildings even a short distance away remain unaffected.
In a regional disaster, such as a flood or hurricane, locations a short distance
away may also be damaged. In this situation, you need to identify locations a
greater distance from the main business location.
When considering any alternate location, the team needs to prepare for the
possibility that you need to put in place any necessary assets or systems in the
alternate location so you can continue business operations. Assets or systems
located in the main business location may be damaged by the disaster event,
and you may not be able to use them in the alternate location.
Consider these factors when you’re searching for alternative locations:
 Can it house the assets, systems, and personnel required to continue
critical business processes?
43
Chapter 2: Bootstrapping the DR Plan Effort
Is your business location-sensitive?
In the universe of individual businesses and
business models, some businesses are location-
sensitive, and others are aren’t. Knowing where
your business fits makes a difference, even for
your interim DR planning. Here are some exam-
ples to help explain why:
 An online Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
isn’t location-sensitive. Its customers use
its services over the Web from any location.
The service provider can host its online
presence from anywhere. The logistics of
locating employees is relatively minor in
comparison to the following two examples
because most employees can perform their
duties from any location that has Internet
connectivity.
 An online merchandiser has some location-
sensitivity. Its customers shop via the Web from
wherever they happen to be. The merchandiser
can host its online presence from anywhere in
the world. However, the merchandiser proba-
bly has to package and ship goods from a
warehouse. If this warehouse location is dam-
aged, the business needs to operate from a dif-
ferent location and work with its suppliers to
route incoming goods to this new location.
 A large retail electronics store is highly
location-sensitive. Its customers must travel
to its business location to purchase goods
and services. If a disaster damages a busi-
ness such as this store, the business must
resume operations in the original site (or
close by) so that customers will still be will-
ing to travel there. A business such as this
one can’t consider changing to a different
city, unless the disaster is so severe that it
will affect business in the long-term.
These examples illustrate the factors that you
must take into consideration when developing
processing alternatives.

 If the location is a significant distance away from the original business
location, is temporary housing available for staff who need to report 
to work at the alternate location?
 Can customers and supply chain partners adjust their routes and 
schedules to utilize the alternate location?
Your organization may also have other issues to consider when seeking 
alternate locations.
You develop an interim DR plan in one to two days. The effort required to make
formal business arrangements with an alternate site falls outside of the scope
of an interim DR plan.
After a disaster, an organization may need to make compromises in order 
to continue its critical business processes. The interim DR planners need to
take into account these other factors when they consider possible processing
alternatives:
 Reducing service levels or output temporarily
 Substituting components
 Using temporary staff
 Sharing premises with other businesses
 Using more manual processes and relying less on information systems
 Utilizing alternate suppliers and service providers
You know your organization far better than I do. Let your business model and
the disaster scenarios you’re planning for dictate what alternatives you can
consider in your interim DR plan.
You can apply some of what you figure out during the development of your
interim DR plan when you develop your formal DR plan.
Step 7 — Enact preventive measures
The loss of key information and assets can be devastating if a disaster
strikes. The interim DR plan needs to identify critical information, records,
and assets, and come up with prevention measures that can be quickly and
easily implemented in order to reduce the likelihood and impact of losing
those records and assets.
44
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

The following list contains tips on preventive measures that may be appro-
priate for your organization:
 IT preventive measures, such as
• Confirm working backups. Make sure that backups are actually
backing up critical data. Confirm what systems, directories, and files
are being backed up and whether they can actually be restored.
• Store backup tapes off-site. Develop a backup media storage plan
that includes off-site storage. What good are backups if the backup
media are damaged by the same fire, flood, or earthquake that
damaged the systems?
• Practice safe racking. Make sure that systems in racks are fastened
securely, so that an event such as an earthquake won’t cause
damage. Also, make sure that racks are cross-braced for stability.
These measures can also ensure the safety of personnel who work 
in these areas by preventing injuries from falling equipment.
 Recordkeeping preventive measures, such as
• Centralize records storage. A logical first step to protecting vital
records is to get them out of workers’ desk drawers and into a 
central location.
• Scan hardcopy records onto file servers. Consider enacting a pro-
ject to electronically scan hard-to-replace hardcopy records, such as
personnel files and contracts.
• Photocopy hardcopy records. Have vital records photocopied and
store the copies at a secure off-site location, far enough away that a
regional disaster doesn’t damage both the originals and the copies.
• Use fire-resistant file cabinets. Consider using fire-resistant file cabi-
nets for vital records. In the event of a fire, records stored in these
cabinets suffer less damage than records stored in more traditional
file cabinets.
 Facility preventive measures, such as
• Use fire-resistant cabinets. Consider upgrading storage cabinets
for critical assets in order to protect those assets from fire.
• Inspect fire detection and suppression systems. Make sure that
fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, sprinkler systems, and other
measures for fire detection and suppression are up to date and
working properly. In many locales, local authorities enforce these
inspections. In areas where local authorities don’t enforce fire-
protection inspections, local businesses need to take the burden 
of these inspections upon themselves.
45
Chapter 2: Bootstrapping the DR Plan Effort

• Set up emergency aid and evacuation plans. Establish and periodi-
cally test personnel safety measures — such as first aid supplies,
emergency lighting, and evacuation plans. An organization’s most
important assets are its personnel, and DR planners sometimes
overlook them in an overall risk management plan.
Your organization’s interim DR planners may come up with other preventive
measures, as well.
Step 8 — Document the interim DR plan
After you develop the interim DR plan, you must clearly document it. The 
DR plans that the interim DR planners develop must be written down and
managed. The structure of the interim DR plan might include any or all of 
the following features:
 Background: Who promoted and sponsored the development of the
interim DR plan, who actually wrote it, and who worked as the interim
DR planners.
 Emergency Response Team (ERT): The members of the ERT and what
departments they represent. Include full contact information.
 Disaster declaration procedure: Describes how your business declares a
disaster. This procedure should include the MAOT (Maximum Allowable
Outage Time), as well as a justification for the MAOT value.
 Communications procedures: Describes how the ERT and other busi-
ness personnel are to communicate, both with one another and with the
outside world.
 Recovery plan procedures: These procedures are the meat of the
interim DR plan. They describe recovery procedures, alternate locations,
and other contingency information for each business process that you
included in the interim DR plan.
 Preventive measures: Okay, these measures aren’t really a part of the
interim DR plan itself, but you still need to document the preventive
measures in the form of action items so that people and departments
actually carry out these measures.
Storage and distribution
When you complete the documentation of the interim DR plan, you need to
store and distribute it in such a way that it’s adequately protected in the event
a disaster strikes. At a minimum, have these copies in place:
46
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

 Hardcopy: Each ERT member should have at least two hardcopies of the
plan: one to keep at work and another at home.
 Off-site hard copy: Have a copy of the interim DR plan available at an off-
site location, far enough away that it won’t be at risk in a regional disaster.
 Soft copy: Each ERT member should also have soft copies of the interim
DR plan. An ERT member might find a copy on a USB stick useful in case
he or she can’t get his or her laptop running but can find someone else
who does have a laptop that works.
 Online: Place the interim DR plan in a secure online location, accessible
by all ERT members. The online location shouldn’t be hosted by the orga-
nization itself: If the building that hosts the online copy of the interim DR
plan is damaged in a disaster, what good is that copy?
Emergency contact information
In the event a disaster strikes during off-work hours, I suggest the interim DR
planners produce small emergency contact cards that can fit into a wallet or
purse. Such a card should contain the names and contact info for everyone
on the ERT, other communication information (such as conference bridges),
and the URL where they can obtain an online copy of the interim DR plan.
Figure 2-1 shows an example of an online contact card.
When each ERT member has this card in his or her wallet or purse, he or she
can more easily reach other ERT members if a disaster occurs after business
hours, even when he or she is away from home.

Chapter 2: Bootstrapping the DR Plan Effort

Step 9 — Train ERT members
Almost done! You’ve developed and documented the interim DR plan, but do
the ERT members know who they are and what to do when a disaster strikes?
All ERT members, and their alternates, need to go through a formal training
session, in which they get all of the basics of the interim DR plan, including
 What the plan is and isn’t: ERT members need to know that the interim
DR plan isn’t the long-term DR plan, it’s just a stopgap until you can fully
develop and implement the long-term DR plan.
 Disaster declaration: Probably the most difficult part of a DR plan is get-
ting ERT members to actually declare a disaster. They need to be familiar
with the procedure and criteria used to determine whether they should
invoke a disaster. Make sure they know that the higher-ups will forgive
them if they declare a disaster unnecessarily (unless they do so over 
and over!).
 Emergency Operations Center (EOC): The ERT members need to know
how to set up and manage emergency operations in the EOC. Each ERT
member needs to understand that he or she may be the EOC leader,
depending on who’s available and how a disaster situation plays out.
 Enacting recovery operations: Each ERT member needs to be familiar
with the recovery operations in the interim DR plan.
Be prepared for the possibility that new issues may arise in the training 
sessions — you may need to make small changes to the interim DR plan. But
remember, the interim DR plan isn’t the save-the-company-from-all-disasters
plan: It’s the simpler stopgap plan you use until you fully develop and test
that larger and more formal DR plan.
Testing Interim DR Plans
An organization that devotes the resources to the development of an 
interim DR plan wants to know that the interim DR plan will work in a disas-
ter. Granted, you use a pretty lightweight process to develop the interim DR 
plan, so you can do your testing on the light side, too.
Here’s a list of the types of DR tests:
 Checklist (paper test): Staff members individually review the plan for
accuracy and completeness.
 Walkthrough: Staff members gather together to walk through the DR
plan as a group, discussing each step along the way.
48
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

 Simulation: Staff members perform a walkthrough in the context of a
pretend disaster that includes periodic announcements of events as
they occur in the region. The ERT members don’t actually perform any
recovery steps, however.
 Parallel: The ERT performs actual recovery steps to move business
processes to alternate locations. The ERT builds or starts recovery
servers and runs some actual business transactions through the recovery
servers while primary servers are also still working. Primary everyday
business processes should continue uninterrupted.
 Interruption (cutover test): The business stops performing critical busi-
ness processes, as though an actual disaster has occurred. The ERT and
other staff members carry out business operations according to the
interim DR plan.
Sure, you built the interim DR plan on a shoestring. But it was time well-spent
because the interim DR plan is the DR plan if a disaster strikes before you finish
the full DR plan. Although it’s unlikely, your business’s long-term future may
depend on the quality of the interim plan. A disaster could occur tomorrow.
At a minimum, you should checklist test and walkthrough test the interim DR
plan. Seriously consider simulation testing, as well. Here’s a breakdown of
how to run each of these tests:
 Checklist testing: Every Emergency Response Team (ERT) member, plus
selected other staff members in the organization (particularly those who
will be assisting with interim business operations during a real disaster),
should carefully review the entire interim DR plan. Ask them to make
suggestions for changes or improvements in the plan. The authors of the
DR plan make the recommended changes and distribute the plan for
comments one more time to be sure everyone agrees that the DR plans
are accurate and complete.
 Walkthrough testing: The entire ERT should take as much time as needed
(half a day to a full day or longer) to go over the interim DR plan, step by
step. They should have plenty of discussions, including question-and-
answer sessions.
The people who developed the interim DR plan should be present, even
if they themselves aren’t ERT members. That way, the plan’s authors can
answer any questions raised.
 Simulation testing: If disaster recovery planning is new to your organiza-
tion (and it probably is if you’re developing an interim DR plan), also
perform simulation testing on your new plan. A simulation test enables
the ERT to more vividly imagine how actual response will take place
during a disaster.
49
Chapter 2: Bootstrapping the DR Plan Effort

The main difference between walkthrough testing and simulation testing is
where you do it. In a walkthrough, you’re in a conference room with four
walls and a whiteboard; in a simulation test, you walk all around your
building, DR plan in hand, observing, asking questions, and pointing out
issues that you can see only in person.

Impact Analysis

 Deciding what’s critical in your business
O
rganizations have limited resources. You can do only so much with 
the people, budget, and equipment available. Software companies want
to add more features and functionality to their products; financial services
organizations want to have additional investment and management plans avail-
able for their customers; automobile manufacturers want to have additional
models, features, and accessories available for their customers to choose from.
But these organizations can’t always add what they want to their products and
services.
Businesses that want to develop disaster recovery (DR) capabilities are 
also constrained by limited resources. At first glance, it makes sense that all
business processes and information systems should have disaster recovery
capabilities. However, an organization just can’t have DR plans for all of its
processes and systems — it doesn’t have enough resources or enough time.
So how does an organization decide which processes and systems warrant
the expense and effort related to the development of DR plans? Most busi-
nesses use a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) to help them make this decision.
You use a structured, top-down approach to create a BIA. In this chapter, I take
you through a tour of the ins and outs of BIA development and how it supports
long-term DR development.

Understanding the Purpose of a BIA
A Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is a detailed inventory of the primary
processes, systems, assets, people, and suppliers that are associated with 
an organization’s principle business activities.
The BIA starts out as a list, but it becomes a web. You end up with a connected
set of lists in which the entries in one list refer to entries in other lists —
dependencies across the spectrum of processes, systems, assets, people, 
and suppliers. Process A depends on Systems K, L, and M; requires the use 
of Assets S and T; is operated by key personnel in Department Q; and depends
on supplies delivered by Suppliers Y and Z. Think of the BIA as a sort of three-
dimensional connect-the-dots, in which entries in various layers have connec-
tions to entries in other layers. Like in the organization itself, everything is
interconnected.
The core purpose of a Business Impact Analysis is to identify which processes
and systems are the most critical to the survival of an organization.
Here’s a closer look at two of the terms I use in the preceding paragraph:
 Critical: This word refers to those processes and systems that your
business absolutely needs in order to perform its main functions.
 Survival: Saving your business from suffering a catastrophic blow that
could result in substantial damage to the business, including closing its
doors for the last time and shutting down for good. I’m not talking about
avoiding a bad financial year or trying not to lose customers or market
share.
Here’s what the Business Impact Analysis does:
 Determines which business processes you need to recover and restart
as soon as possible after a disaster
 Determines how soon you need to restart business processes
 Identifies the resources you need to restart these business processes
Without a BIA, you don’t know which processes are mission critical (crucial to
the ongoing success of the organization) or time critical (those processes that
negatively affect the organization when they’re not performed promptly), and
you don’t know which ones require attention in the DR planning and testing
phases. Without a BIA, you’re just guessing, and you’re liable to identify
processes and systems as critical by some less-than-ideal criteria, including
52
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

 Your favorites
 Those with which you’re most familiar
 The ones that the executives like best
 The shiny, new ones
 Pet processes (the favorites of others)
 The easy ones
The criteria listed above don’t make good business sense. The BIA uses
objective criteria to select those processes that are truly the most critical to
the organization, instead of relying on subjective criteria.
Scoping the Effort
Early on, you need to clearly establish the scope of the entire project. If the
scope of an organization’s DR project is unclear, members in the project team
may arbitrarily cut out important components or increase the scope beyond
what the project’s sponsors originally intended.
You need to first establish the boundaries of the DR project by addressing
the following questions:
 Project team: Which staff members will make up the DR project team?
How much time per week do you expect each team member to work on
the DR project?
Similarly, do you have any staff members on loan for the DR project, 
and do you need to obtain any contractors for the project?
 Scope: Which sets of business functions are in the scope of the DR 
project, and which are out? Have you established a quick analysis of
dependencies in order to firmly establish the scope?
 Project plan: Have you established a high-level project plan that
includes important dates?
 Budget: What budget are you establishing for each phase of the DR 
project? Have you established the budget in such a way that you can 
use the results of the BIA to help shape the budget for the DR effort
itself, after you know better how much investment you need in order 
to meet established recovery criteria?
Has management committed to establishing an annual budget that can
help maintain the DR plan and keep it relevant and effective?
53
Chapter 3: Developing and Using a Business Impact Analysis

 Executive support: What level of executive support do you have for the
DR project? Are company executives firmly behind the DR project, or are
they only lukewarm about it?
You need a formal, written charter that answers all the questions in the preced-
ing list if you want a truly successful DR project. In all but the smallest organi-
zations, a DR project can easily take a year or longer, from the inception of the
BIA all the way to the investment in any necessary systems and equipment,
training, and testing.
Conducting a BIA: Taking 
a Common Approach
The information-gathering stage of the BIA involves a great number of inter-
views that one or more people carry out. You need to develop a common
approach so that every interviewer gathers the same information from every
person he or she interviews about every process, system, asset, and supplier.
Instead of steaming headlong into interviews and other information-gathering
activities without a plan, spend some time developing procedures and tem-
plates so that you can make the interviewing process (probably the most
labor-intensive of all BIA activities) as efficient and effective as possible.
54
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 
Should you hire a consultant?
You may want to hire an outside consultant who’s
an expert at disaster recovery planning and per-
forming a Business Impact Analysis. Hiring an out-
side consultant for this type of work has its pros
and cons. The pros include that the consultant is
 An expert at DR planning
 An expert at creating Business Impact
Analyses
 Objective
Consultants do have their downside:
 They’re not familiar with your business
 They have few, if any, relationships with
staff
 Their services are costly
You need to weigh these factors and decide how
much you want a consultant to do for you. You can
have him or her give you a little up-front advice, or
you can let him or her manage the entire process.

Your BIA should focus on identifying and inventorying several key aspects
and characteristics of an organization, including
 Business processes: This generic term refers to business activities that
your business’s personnel carry out, often with the help of machinery —
including information systems. Processes are made up of one or many
procedures. Business processes can be fairly simple, one or two people
carrying them out with minimum dependency on other resources; or they
can be quite complex, involving people in many parts of the organization,
as well as suppliers and other external resources.
 Information systems: This generic term means computer systems, 
applications, databases, and devices. An information system can be as
simple as an Excel spreadsheet on a desktop computer or as complex 
as an application running on dozens of servers in locations throughout
the world.
 Assets: The equipment needed to facilitate the production of whatever
products or services your organization produces. Assets may consist 
of machinery or tools that are essential to the business. Assets can be
servers (although you could argue that computers belong in the informa-
tion systems category, but don’t get too nit-picky); mechanical devices,
such as milling machines or lathes; tools, such as forklifts and electric
generators; or equipment, such as X-ray machines and CAT scanners.
 Personnel: The people who perform the processes or support them in
some direct way. These people may be located anywhere, and they can
include your employees, contractors, and temps.
 Suppliers: The outside organizations that supply your business with
goods or services that it needs in order to produce its goods or services.
Suppliers include organizations that provide you raw materials, such as
steel, lumber, or blank CDs; a public utility supplying electricity, natural
gas, or water; and a service organization, such as an Internet colocation
facility or a data storage provider.
Gathering information through interviews
The best approach to inventorying all of the items in the preceding section is
to schedule discussions with key people in the business. Business processes
and information systems can’t explain themselves, so you need to talk to the
people who are responsible for those processes and systems.
You’re not going to be able to create a complete list of people you need to inter-
view initially. When people describe their processes and systems to you, they
may point out more names that you need to add to your list of interviewees.
55
Chapter 3: Developing and Using a Business Impact Analysis

Don’t look at the incompleteness of your initial list of suspects as a sign of
weakness — it’s just a simple fact. Few organizations have a single individual
who has an exceedingly clear view of every critical process, system, and 
supplier.
Here are some tips for these interviews:
 Arrange the interviews in advance with department or business unit
owners, letting them know what to expect so they can be prepared.
 Plan the interviews so that they’ll be effective and won’t waste time. For
instance, create a list of standard questions so that you can get more 
consistent answers, particularly if more than one person does the 
interviewing.
 Conduct the interviews in person when possible.
Using consistent forms and worksheets
You can make the information-gathering stage of the BIA most effective if you
ask for the same types of information from each process or system owner.
You can (arguably) most easily accomplish this conformity by developing
forms that you (or whoever conducts the interview) use when interviewing
each process owner. Using forms has several advantages, including
 Completeness: You can be sure that you ask all the key questions in
every interview.
 Conciseness: You can more easily capture a higher amount of detail in
interviews by including details in forms.
 Consistency: Whether one person or several people are conducting the
interviews, they’re more likely to ask the same questions every time if
you use a form.
You can use simple paper forms that the interviewer fills out in hardcopy,
then the interviewer enters that information into spreadsheets or databases
later; or you can use soft forms in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat that the
interviewer can fill out on-screen. Electronic note-taking may be more effi-
cient because you don’t have to transcribe the written notes. Exactly how
you conduct your interviews is up to you.
Here are some tips as you develop your information gathering forms and 
procedures:
56
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

 Use one form per process, not one per interview. Unless an inter-
viewee is responsible for only one process, use a separate form for each
process (or system, asset, person, supplier, and so on). You want your
information gathering to focus on the processes, not the personnel
you’re interviewing.
 Cross-reference. On a process intake form, list critical suppliers, person-
nel, assets, and systems. Likewise, on a critical supplier’s intake form,
cross-reference the processes and systems that supplier supports.
 Include metadata. Be sure that the form includes information such 
as the name of the interviewee, the interviewee’s contact information,
who conducted the interview, and when it took place. You want to be
able to trace data back to its source in case you come up with more
questions later.
To help clarify this whole business of interviews and intake forms, Figure 3-1
shows a part of a sample intake form that you can use as a starting point. You
can see the metadata (information about the information gathered, such as
the names of the people interviewed, who did the interviewing, the date of
interviews, and so on) and dependencies in this sample process intake form.
As you develop your forms, keep this in mind: You’ll probably want to trans-
fer the data gathered on the forms into a spreadsheet, in which you’ll be able
to view the data that you gather, as well as sort, filter, and merge that data
with other related data that you might have on-hand.
The information-gathering stage of the BIA should help you build a high-level
view of critical business processes and the systems that support them that
lets you examine the details without getting mired in them.
57
Chapter 3: Developing and Using a Business Impact Analysis
The bird’s eye detailed view of the business
Often, an organization doesn’t have personnel who
have a comprehensive view of allan organization’s
processes, suppliers, assets, and personnel until
the organization undertakes its first Business
Impact Analysis. Many in the organization will want
to get their hands on your business’s completed
BIA that describes the entire business in detail,
including rank-ordered lists of critical processes,
systems, suppliers, assets, and personnel.
No one knows the details of a business as well as DR
and security people do. These personnel are respon-
sible for reducing risk across the entire business, and
in the process of doing so, they accumulate much
knowledge about all aspects of the business.

Capturing Data for the BIA
The BIA is all about gathering information and then analyzing it. Gather infor-
mation for the BIA methodically, consistently, and in a way you can repeat. In a
larger project, in which more than one person gathers information, you should
get the same details, regardless of who’s doing the gathering.
You gather a lot of information on a variety of topics for the Business Impact
Analysis. Even though this book focuses on the IT side of disaster recovery
planning, you can’t ignore the fact that IT systems support business processes.
Ultimately, you need to know about the business processes — which ones are
the most critical and how quickly you need to recover them. The BIA helps you
figure out your organization’s processes.

Business processes
Business processes, or just processes, are the activities that an organization
performs in support of its primary purpose(s): the production and delivery
of goods and/or services.
All businesses have processes, although they may not be called processes.
The following list includes some possible features of a business’s processes:
 Processes contain one or more procedures. Procedures are (usually) 
written instructions that people carry out. Simple processes may contain
only a single procedure, whereas complex processes may have many 
procedures (which personnel don’t necessarily carry out sequentially).
Examples of procedures include intubate the patient, install the operating
system, and replace the brake pads.
Procedures consist of one or more tasks, which are the individual steps
that you need to perform in a procedure. Example tasks include log out
of the application, turn off the power supply, and fasten the sensor to
the bracket.
A DR project can expose weaknesses in business processes, including
when you don’t have procedures in writing. In a smaller, newer, or less
formal organization, you may be able to get away with maintaining a pro-
cedure in more of an oral tradition, rather than in a formal written form.
But an organization that wants to establish an effective disaster recovery
plan needs to document its procedures, in both disaster and peacetime
settings.
 Processes are carried out by people. Examples of people who carry out
processes include bank tellers, database administrators, and mechanics.
In highly automated processes, such as oil refineries, the machinery 
does most of the real work, but operators and engineers are in there
somewhere, turning equipment off and on, and making adjustments 
to machinery as it continues operation.
 Processes may depend on information systems. Personnel can carry out
some processes without using an information system, but increasingly,
business processes require information systems in some direct or indi-
rect manner. Examples of these dependencies include the availability of
a patient records system in order to admit a patient, the availability of
an inventory system in order to identify the location of a replacement
part, and the availability of a directory server to perform backups.
 Processes may require assets. Processes often depend on one or more
assets. For instance, a medical office needs a copier or scanner to make
copies of insurance benefit cards and scales to weigh patients. A fueling
station needs tanks and pumps. A manufacturing company needs its
forklifts, packing machines, machine tools, and assembly lines.
59
Chapter 3: Developing and Using a Business Impact Analysis

Some organizations list their computer systems under assets rather than
under information systems. I won’t get in the middle of that argument:
As long as you document the dependencies, you can label them any way
you want that makes sense for your organization.
 Processes may depend on suppliers or service providers. Most
processes require supplies or raw materials, which your business often
gets from external suppliers.
The Business Impact Analysis contains all the features in the preceding 
list about business processes in a high level of detail. Your BIA may contain
several worksheets listing the organization’s business processes, one per row
(or even one per worksheet), with columns containing the individual items 
in the preceding list.
Bottom line: The BIA contains a detailed list of all the processes (at least, the
important ones) that the organization carries out. It’s a summary of everything
the organization does.
Information systems
The BIA contains an inventory of the organization’s information systems. Like
the list of processes (which I discuss in the preceding section), the list of
information systems probably will be quite detailed.
I deliberately use the rather general term information system, as opposed to
more specific terms such as application, server, device, or database system.
The term information system includes some or all the components in an IT
environment. To some extent, what falls into your information systems group
depends on how your organization thinks about its own information systems.
For example, a large medical clinic has a patient information system that
manages all the information about its patients. If you think about the patient
information system as an application, the system contains not only the appli-
cation, but the servers it resides on; (potentially) separate database servers;
and other elements, such as directory servers, print servers, and file servers.
Without all these other elements, the patient information system wouldn’t
function. And don’t forget the network (at least a part of it), as well as work-
stations and other equipment.
Your business model, information systems, application architecture, and
even the structure of your org chart (who works for whom, and how responsi-
bilities align with senior managers and executives) may dictate the ways that
you slice and dice your complete collection of information assets. You don’t
have to worry about a right way or wrong way, as long as the methods for
identifying and classifying your information systems work for you.
60
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

Structure your inventory of information systems in such a way that you can
easily identify dependencies between processes and information systems, as
well as assets, personnel, and suppliers.
Assets
A Business Impact Analysis contains a list of important assets that the busi-
ness uses, particularly those assets that are directly or indirectly related to
the production of whatever goods or services the business produces.
Your organization’s assets might be any of the following or something entirely
different:
 Delivery vehicles
 Cranes
 Printing presses
Regardless of the specific items on your list of assets, a BIA should contain
the assets that are related to the organization’s primary activities.
Cross-reference your assets with whichever lists are relevant — processes,
information systems, suppliers, and personnel.
61
Chapter 3: Developing and Using a Business Impact Analysis
External or internal: It depends on scope
Many larger organizations perform not only the
activities that directly result in the delivery of
their primary goods and services, but also many
supporting activities. Here are some examples:
 An office supply company may have its own
fleet of delivery vehicles.
 An online travel services provider may
operate its own Internet data center.
 A fleet of limousines may have its own tow
trucks and mechanics.
The scope of a DR project determines whether
you consider supporting or adjunct services
internal or external. For example, if the scope of
the online travel services provider’s DR plan
includes only its software applications, the com-
pany may consider the Internet data center’s
services external, even though they’re per-
formed by the same organization, because the
Internet data center isn’t a part of the company’s
DR project.

Personnel
Every organization has its replaceable personnel, as well as those who aren’t
so easily replaced. The point of a list of personnel (if, indeed, you even need
such a list) is to identify those people who are critical to the delivery of the
organization’s principle goods and services.
To avoid the nearly inevitable political posturing and other unnatural behavior
that occurs when personnel try to prove their worth, avoid coming up with 
a list of critical personnel at all. Instead, identify critical personnel (if and as
needed) within the most critical business processes and leave it at that.
You may decide to draw up a list of critical personnel — those people whose
unanticipated absence could make the business suffer most. You can use this
list to identify any critical paths that you can alleviate by cross-training or
redistributing duties. Remember, the purpose of DR planning is to ensure the
survival of the organization in a disaster. In serious disasters, key personnel
may be killed, injured, or unable to report to work because of transportation
disruptions.
Suppliers
Like processes, information systems, assets, and personnel (which you can
read about in the preceding sections), you probably have several key suppli-
ers, without which the organization’s output of goods and/or services would
grind to a halt.
Identify key suppliers within each business process. If the organization is
highly dependent on external suppliers (which may include other distant
parts of the organization that fall out of scope of the DR project, as the
“External or internal: It depends on scope” sidebar, in this chapter, states),
the BIA may include a separate list of those suppliers, just so you can see
them all in one place.
If you include a separate list of suppliers in the BIA, cross-reference each 
supplier back to the process(es) that it supports.
Statements of impact
In the preceding sections, I describe lists that you need to add to the BIA:
processes, information systems, assets, personnel (optionally), and suppliers.
Those lists contain a lot of details about each of the processes, information
systems, and so on, including dependencies between processes and suppliers.
62
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

You need to add something else to those lists — the impact of nonperfor-
mance, or the impact of unavailability. In other words, the impact upon the
organization as a whole if the particular process, supplier, or asset is dis-
rupted or unavailable for a period of time.
In your BIA report, add statements of impact — words or short phrases that
describe the impact if each process (or supplier or asset) is interrupted or
unavailable. Examples include inability to process customer deposits, inabil-
ity to transfer goods from inventory, and inability to access patient medical
history.
Each business process is somehow — directly or indirectly — related to the
organization’s production of goods and services. What if a disrupting event
knocks the process offline (literally or figuratively) for an extended period 
of time?
Your Business Impact Analysis can also show a cost figure associated with
each process. This figure represents the cost to the business per unit time,
such as dollars per hour, if the process is unavailable.
Calculating cost impact can be quite complicated, and you should do it only 
for those processes you rank as most critical. You probably need the expertise
of one or more financial people in your organization to help you make these
calculations. You can get the heady details in Activity Accounting: An Activity-
Based Costing Approach (Wiley), by James A. Brimson, and Activity-Based Cost
Management: An Executive’s Guide (Wiley), by Gary Cokins.
Criticality assessment
The BIA report contains, in addition to statements of impact (which you can
read about in the preceding section), criticality rankings for each process. You
probably also want to include criticality rankings in the other lists, such as
information systems and suppliers.
You can code criticality on a scale such as L, M, H, C (for low, medium, high,
or critical impact) or a numeric scale rated 1 through 4.
Although you can rate or rank each data point fairly simply, criticality has
tremendous impact on the results of the BIA. When you collect all the busi-
ness processes on a spreadsheet and sort them by criticality, you get a rank-
ordered list of the organization’s most critical processes — one of the primary
objectives of the Business Impact Analysis.
The criticality ranking is a well-informed estimate of overall impact on continu-
ing business operations if that process is interrupted.
63
Chapter 3: Developing and Using a Business Impact Analysis

Maximum Tolerable Downtime
For each process in the BIA, you need to determine its Maximum Tolerable
Downtime (MTD).
Maximum Tolerable Downtime is the time after which the process being
unavailable creates irreversible (and often fatal) consequences. Generally,
exceeding the MTD leads to severe damage to the viability of the business,
including the actual failure of the business. Depending on the process, you
can express the MTD in hours, days, or longer.
Arriving at a reasonable MTD for a process is anything but easy. You can’t 
ask yourself, “Last time this process became unavailable to the organization,
how long was it before the organization actually failed?” And such occurrences
happen so rarely, even among other organizations similar to yours, that you
have very little data to reference when you estimate an MTD. You really have 
to ask yourself, how long would it take for this organization to go fins-up if this
particular process was down for a long time?
Still, you have to put something in that spot. You may need to turn to the
expertise of more seasoned senior or executive management, and even 
then, you can come up with only a somewhat arbitrary figure. You really 
need to think out the figures for MTD because those figures contribute to 
the calculation of other figures discussed in the following sections.
Recovery Time Objective
After you determine MTDs for processes (see the preceding section), you can
begin setting targets for recovery. One important target is the Recovery Time
Objective (RTO).
The Recovery Time Objective is the period of time in which the organization
intends to have the interrupted process running again.
64
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 
MTD and governments
If the local city or county government can’t per-
form a critical process past its MTD, is it really
going to go out of business? You probably find it
hard to imagine a government actually ceasing
to function altogether, but a lot of people could
end up with really big problems if the critical
process that’s not available involves keeping the
water or electricity flowing to that government’s
citizens.
In businesses such as governments that rarely just
stop functioning entirely, the MTD might instead be
the point at which the customers (citizens) are
likely to revolt and force out the top officials.

For any given process, the RTO is less than the MTD. By definition, it has to
be. If you set a 14-day RTO for a process with a 7-day MTD, your business has
failed before you can get the critical process running again. And what’s the
point of that?
A process’s RTO forms the basis for any DR planning that you’ll do for that
process. For example, if a process has a 30-day RTO, you can get it running
again — purchase a new server, install software, and restore backup data —
at a leisurely pace. However, a process with a one-hour RTO requires a hot
site with a standby server and data replication in near-real time. The costs
for these two scenarios vary greatly.
Time is money. Lower RTOs require more investment in standby systems, 
as well as the possible need for data replication or other potentially costly
technologies.
Establishing RTOs and then determining the costs required to reach those
objectives can be a repetitive process. As you discover the costs of achieving
an ambitious RTO, you may need to compromise and develop a capability that
costs less but delivers a longer RTO.
Recovery Point Objective
The Recovery Point Objective (RPO), like the RTO (discussed in the preced-
ing section), is somewhat arbitrary and based on assumptions that people
near the top of the org chart (executives and senior managers) make.
65
Chapter 3: Developing and Using a Business Impact Analysis
Time critical versus mission critical
When you gather information about critical processes,
and when you’re estimating Maximum Tolerable
Downtime (MTD), Recovery Time Objectives (RTO), and
Recovery Point Objectives (RPO), you may notice that
 You have time-critical processes (those that
must be delivered in a timely fashion).
 You have mission-critical processes (those
that are vital to the organization’s viability).
Your time-critical processes and your mission-
critical process aren’t necessarily the same.
Your organization may have mission-critical
processes that aren’t time critical, and you may
have time-critical processes that aren’t mission
critical.
The difference between these two kinds of
processes becomes important as you begin using
the results of your Business Impact Analysis. As
you establish Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs)
for processes, you need to balance the cost of
attaining those RTOs against the value of the
processes that they support.

The Recovery Point Objective is the maximum amount of data that you can
lose if a process is interrupted and later recovered.
Say that an organization wants to establish a four-hour RPO for an order entry
system. In order to meet this figure, the organization has to implement a mecha-
nism to back up or replicate transaction data so that it loses no more than four
hours of transactions in a disaster scenario.
Similar to the RTO, setting the RPO determines what sorts of measures you
need to take to ensure that you don’t lose information related to any particular
business process.
Speed costs. Lower RPOs generally require greater investment in data 
replication or backup technology.
Introducing Threat Modeling 
and Risk Analysis
You need to carry out threat modeling and risk analysis for each critical
process that you identify in the BIA. Although they’re somewhat different
activities, threat modeling and risk analysis are similar enough that you can
think of them as a single integrated activity.
Threat modeling is the process of identifying a full range of potential threats,
the probability that they’ll occur, their impact, and mitigation steps.
Risk analysis is the process of identifying and assessing factors that may 
jeopardize the ongoing operation of a business process.
If you think that threat modeling and risk analysis are similar, you’re right.
You perform both processes as a single activity, in which you identify threats
and vulnerabilities in business processes and the steps that you can take to
mitigate the potential impact of those threats and vulnerabilities.
Mitigation is just a fancy word that means the steps or measures that you
need to perform to reduce your risk.
You may need to carry out these activities for each process in the BIA,
although in many cases, you can carry out threat modeling on groups of 
similar processes, rather than each process individually. I mean, a flood is 
a flood — listing it for every process might be going a little overboard (yes,
that pun was intended).
66
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

Disaster scenarios
Before you can get to the actual threat and risk analysis, you need to create 
a relatively complete list of the disasters that are reasonably likely to occur.
The following list isn’t meant to be complete — some disasters not listed
here might belong in your threat model. But this list should give you a good
starting point:
 Natural disasters: You know, acts of nature — events that occur without
any direct help from people. Here are some examples:
• Fires and explosions
• Earthquakes
• Volcanoes
• Storms (snow, ice, hail, wind, or prolonged rain)
• Floods
• Hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons
• Tornadoes
• Landslides, mudflows, and avalanches
• Tsunamis
• Pandemic
 Man-made disasters: Human-caused events. These disasters include
• War and terrorism
• Riots and other civil disturbances
• Work stoppages
• Cyber attacks
 Secondary effects: These effects can result from both man-made and
natural disasters. Secondary effects include
• Utility outages: Electric power, natural gas, water, and so on
• Communications outages: Telephone, cable, wireless, television,
radio, Internet
• Transportation outages: Roads, highways, airports, railroads,
shipping
Your region or locale may be subject to other events that can disrupt business
activities to such an extent that you can consider those events disasters.
67
Chapter 3: Developing and Using a Business Impact Analysis

Identifying potential disasters 
in your region
Disastrous events are, by their nature, uncommon in many parts of the world.
Where disasters occur frequently, usually everyone leaves, or they make
long-term investments in infrastructure to lessen the effects of natural events
so those events are no longer disastrous when they occur. Still, you should
have a good understanding of the types of disasters that can occur in your
region. To find information on the types of disaster you may have to face,
check out these sources:
 National and local weather bureaus
 Local civil defense authorities
 Local disaster relief agencies, such as the International Red Cross
 Local law enforcement
 Local newspaper archives
 Army Corps of Engineers (for flood plain data in the U.S. only)
 Peers and colleagues in local trade organizations
One or more of these sources may lead you to other local sources of useful
information about potential disasters.
Performing Threat Modeling 
and Risk Analysis
Threat modeling and risk analysis can consume a significant portion of the
total BIA effort. Entire books have been written on the topic, but because this
book has only so much space, I describe these activities only in procedural
form.
For each process or group of processes in your BIA, follow these steps:
1. Identify every potential natural disaster that could interrupt the
process you’re dealing with.
2. Determine the likelihood of each disaster occurring within a single
calendar year.
3. Identify every potential man-made disaster that could interrupt your
process.
68
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

4. Determine the likelihood of each man-made disaster occurring in a
single calendar year.
For both natural and man-made disasters, assign numeric values for low-
to-high likelihood something like this: Rare: 1; Infrequent: 10; Possible:
100; Likely: 1,000; Very Likely: 10,000.
5. For each threat that you identify in Step 1 and Step 3, rank the impact
of the event (if it actually occurs) on this scale: Lowest: 1; Medium:
100; Highest: 10,000.
6. Determine the risk of each threat.
For each threat, multiply the likelihood figure from Step 2 or Step 4 by
the threat figure from Step 5. For example, a threat with infrequent proba-
bility (value: 10) and a medium impact (value: 100) equals 1,000. Use this
equation for each threat.
7. Sort the threats by risk (the figure you establish in Step 6).
Pay the most attention to the threats at the top of the list. Chances are,
these events are most likely to occur in your region.
After following the preceding steps, you have a simple threat analysis. You
know which threats you need to pay the most attention to, and you have an
idea how likely those threats are to actually occur (well, at least as accurate
as your estimate based on the preceding list’s rather unsophisticated scale).
I made the threat analysis procedure in the preceding list intentionally 
simplistic. A real threat analysis should use a broader scale and more realis-
tic probabilities. But hopefully you get the idea of what threat analysis is 
all about. If you want all the details about threat analysis, you can pick up 
a copy of Emerging Threat Analysis: From Mischief to Malicious (Syngress), 
by Michael Gregg. You can also find a great free online resource about risk
analysis at the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology’s Web
site (www.nist.gov): Risk Management Guide for Information Technology
Systems, special publication 800-30.
You can perform threat modeling and risk analysis at the same time as the
information-gathering process. Because threat modeling and risk analysis are
so similar, you might consider doing them as a single task.
Identifying Critical Components
You’ve collected basic information from all of the important business
processes for your Business Impact Analysis. You’ve identified information
systems, personnel, assets, and suppliers that these processes depend on,
69
Chapter 3: Developing and Using a Business Impact Analysis

and you may have created separate lists of these if your business has a lot 
of them. For instance, you can create separate lists of suppliers by category.
You get to decide how you want to organize your information.
Processes and systems
In the list of critical processes that you create in the BIA, you have many
important fields that describe the processes, their owners, and so on. Here’s
a list of the fields you should include:
 Process name
 Process owner
 Description of the process
 Information systems that this process requires
 Assets that this process requires
 Any critical personnel without whom this process would fail
 Suppliers that this process requires
 Statement of impact if the process fails or is interrupted
 Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD)
 Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
 Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
 Cost of downtime
 Criticality ranking
Your list will probably have more fields than the preceding list does, but this
list gives you the basics.
I want to focus, for now, on the numeric items in the preceding list — the MTD,
RTO, RPO, cost of downtime, and criticality. With these fields, you can manipu-
late your list in various ways to get an eagle-eye view of which processes are
truly important in your organization. You can begin to see which process 
have the shortest MTDs, RTOs, and RPOs by sorting the list based on those
columns. While sorting based on these fields, you can keep your eye on the
criticality rankings to see if criticality is in line with those objectives. Do you
see any correlation between criticality and your RTOs and RPOs? Maybe you
do, and maybe you don’t.
70
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

If you have a lot of processes (more than can fit on a screen — at least, that’s
how I decide whether I have a lot of processes), you might group them into
High, Medium, and Low categories, based on ranking. For instance, you might
divide the entire rank-ordered list of processes into thirds. Depending on the
nature of your business (which includes a great many things, including regu-
latory, financial, and market conditions), your organization might invest in
DR capabilities for only the High and Medium processes, not the Low.
Suppliers
In a large BIA effort (say, more than 20 business processes), you may identify
several suppliers and other supply chain partners within your processes. You
might decide to pull these critical suppliers and make a separate worksheet
for them, in which you can capture additional information about them,
including
 Company name, address, phone number, Internet URL, and so on
 Business contact’s name, address, phone number, e-mail, and so on
 Name of business contact in your organization who has the business
relationship with the supplier’s business contact
 The processes that the supplier supports
 The goods and/or services that the supplier provides
You can use this critical supplier information as a jumping-off point when you
begin building your DR plans.
Personnel
As you manipulate, slice, and dice your critical processes list (described in
the preceding sections), you may begin to notice a few names of personnel
who appear frequently in the most critical processes. You may want to take 
a closer look at those people and consider whether they’re truly critical for
so many business processes.
Items in your DR plans that relate to critical personnel may include cross-
training or staff augmentation of some sort in order to reduce any possible
exposures related to too many processes depending on too few individuals.
71
Chapter 3: Developing and Using a Business Impact Analysis

Determining the Maximum 
Tolerable Downtime
I discuss Maximum Tolerable Downtime in the section “Maximum Tolerable
Downtime,” earlier in this chapter; now, I go into this topic a little deeper.
Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) is the maximum length of time a busi-
ness process can be interrupted or unavailable without causing the business
itself to fail. Here are some examples:
 An exclusively online retailer might go under if its online catalog is
unavailable for several days.
 An airline might go out of business if it can’t book flights for more than
48 hours.
 A delivery business might fail if it can’t get dispatch information to its
trucks within an hour of loading them.
You can have a really hard time arriving at reasonable MTD figures for your
business, or any business. Business failures that occur because of disasters
aren’t an everyday occurrence. To my knowledge, no sites on the Internet
have statistics on the connection between disasters and failed businesses.
With so little data to work with, your MTD figure is probably going to be no
better than an educated guess.
Calculating the Recovery Time Objective
The Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the time period in which the organiza-
tion should have the interrupted process running again, at or near the same
capacity and conditions as before the disaster.
To determine the RTO, you need an idea of your Maximum Tolerable Downtime
(MTD) value. Common sense should dictate that you need your RTO to be less
than your MTD. In other words, you want your critical process restored and
operating well before the point at which its downtime would threaten the very
viability of the business. Otherwise, it’s sort of like waiting three and a half 
minutes to begin administering CPR to a drowning victim.
For example, if the MTD for a critical process is seven days, you might set
your RTO to four days.
72
Part I: Getting Started with Disaster Recovery 

You need to be as realistic as possible about the RTOs you specify for
processes. A lower RTO does cost more than a higher RTO. You can’t have 
it both ways — you either have a fast recovery or a cheap recovery.
If you’ve been reading ahead, or if you’re just a quick study, you might be
thinking that you don’t want the cost of achieving a given RTO to exceed the
value derived from the business process. For example, it doesn’t make sense
to invest $100,000 in equipment to reduce an RTO from four hours to one
hour if the cost of downtime is only $1,000 per hour. Spending $100,000 to
save $4,000 doesn’t make good sense.
You figure out how much you can reasonably spend to improve the RTO and
RPO much in the same way you buy auto insurance: You need to figure out
how much the premiums cost, what the deductibles are, and what events the
insurance covers.
In your BIA and DR plan development, you estimate the cost required to
achieve an RTO. I go through this procedure in Chapter 6 through Chapter 8.
Calculating the Recovery Point Objective
A Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the amount of data that you can lose in a
disaster without being able to recover it.
For example, a company uses an online financial management application to
manage its finances. Every day, employees enter invoices, payment requests,
journal entries, and receipts. A disaster strikes the data center in which the
application’s servers reside. Backups were performed once per day, and an
entire day’s work was lost. This application’s RPO is one day — in other
words, the company can recover the application only to the point one day
prior to the disaster.
Thinking ahead, if the organization wanted to shorten the RPO, it could do so
by running backups more often or replicating transactions to another server
in another location.
Like the RTO (see the preceding section), shortening a process’s RPO genera-
lly carries a price. Later in the analysis, you can better determine the right 
balance between the cost of achieving an RPO and the value it provides the
organization. Chapter 6 through Chapter 8 can help you strike this balance as
you begin to formulate ways to make the various parts of your environment
recoverable.

his chapter should help business people better understand technology.
On the other hand, technology people can use this chapter to better
understand why business people don’t know more about technology.
Technology people, I have something to say to you: Disaster recovery 
planning isn’t about the technology. It’s about the business.
This chapter explains mapping business functions to the infrastructure and
vice versa. You should know the principles and procedures related to this
mapping because DR plans are business-process–centric. Align specific DR
plans to business processes. IT systems don’t make the business run — busi-
ness processes do! You need to fully understand which information systems
support which business processes. When you know which systems support
the most critical business processes, you can take the next step — develop-
ing specific DR plans for recovering the right IT infrastructure in the right
way, so that you can recover those business processes.
In order to develop DR plans for your IT systems, you need to know what
your IT systems currently consist of. Makes sense, right? But a large number
of organizations don’t have a good grip on what actually makes all their sys-
tems work. (If you’re in this category, you’re in the right place — and I won’t
tell anyone.)
To begin, you first need to find out what inventory information exists for all 
of your IT hardware and software, and what applications people use in various

departments. Hopefully, inventory information does exist in some form — 
otherwise, you have to start at the beginning. If you have to do this inventory
yourself, just think of it as a treasure hunt — you’re going to discover what you
have and how it’s all tied together!
Finding and Using Inventories
Inventories are just lists of the IT equipment and software that you have. You
don’t need to make them really complicated. Use the items in the following list
to discover what you have in your infrastructure, how your business uses it,
and what business applications it supports. If you already have one or more of
your applications completely mapped out and inventoried, you can skip those
applications and concentrate on what you don’t have yet:
 Hardware asset inventory: The parts and pieces of your infrastructure.
All of your servers, routers, firewalls, and other hard components. If you
know their status or condition, categorize each appropriately — for exam-
ple, as active or inactive, production or test. Also get the make, model,
serial number, and location (room, rack, whatever), as shown in Figure 4-1.
And don’t forget network components, cables, fibre, and so on.
 Software inventory: You need to know what programs are running
where. As you go through your servers, note what major components
are running on each. Indicate make, version, patch level, which server
it’s running on, and other data points that make sense to you (such as
major configuration options, media location, and so on). You can find a
sample software inventory in Figure 4-2.
 Business applications: Talk with department heads (or their delegates)
to find out what internal and external applications their departments use.
Ask how they access and log in to these applications. With this informa-
tion, you can begin to map business applications to hardware and soft-
ware assets. A sample application inventory appears in Figure 4-3.
Truthfully, I hope you have something better than a spreadsheet (such as a
small database or an application) for tracking your assets. However, many
people use spreadsheets, and they may work for you if you don’t have more
than several hundred hardware and software components.
If your IT department doesn’t have inventories such as those discussed in
the preceding bulleted list, your accounting department probably maintains
inventories of hardware and software purchases for depreciation purposes.
78

Larger organizations may have another readymade, reliable inventory avail-
able within a problem-management or helpdesk application, such as Remedy.

Chapter 4: Mapping Business Functions to Infrastructure

Using High-Level Architectures
One of the dirty little secrets in many organizations is the lack of high-level
architecture — those boxes-and-arrows diagrams that logically depict systems
and data in an organization or among multiple organizations. These diagrams,
which are often accompanied by lists of components and/or specifications,
show the relationship between components and layers of an application 
environment.
When you’re conducting DR planning, you need to have not only an inventory-
level view of your systems and applications, but also a high-level view of it.
You need at least these high-level diagrams of your systems environment:
 Data flow and storage
 Infrastructure
If you don’t have these views of your environment, it’s worth the time you
need to develop them. Often, these diagrams are the only way you can get a
complete end-to-end view of a single application or an entire environment.
Data flow and data storage diagrams
Data flow and data storage diagrams give you decidedly data-centric depic-
tions of information flow within applications and between applications. In
almost all cases, applications receive, store, send, and report information.
Gaining a data-centric view of an application can help you, the DR planner,
better understand how the application works and how it supports business
processes, as well as providing you with a data-centric starting point for the
development of recovery plans.
80
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 
Top-down and bottom-up thinking
Successful DR planners need to see both views
of the IT systems world: top-down and bottom-
up. A top-down view of applications gives the
DR planner an end-to-end view of the environ-
ment, or of a single process or application.
Comparing top-down views of applications side
by side can help the DR planner understand
how resources are shared — or can be shared.
A bottom-up view tells the DR planner the
details about each component that supports a
system or process. This view permits the DR
planning to determine precisely what changes
you need to make to
 Build a recovery plan.
 Enact any prevention measures.

You find or create these data flow and storage diagrams so you can identify
the systems that contain information and how the information moves between
systems. If you want to develop plans for recovering vital and critical busi-
ness processes, you have to know which systems support those processes
and how those systems and processes are interconnected. Without this knowl-
edge, you can’t develop DR plans that help recover systems that support
those processes — and if those processes aren’t supported, they remain idle,
putting business survival at risk.
Starting with the big picture often provides you with a path to identifying
details. In other words, after you see the big picture, you can select parts of
the big picture and explore the details about how specific applications work
and are supported.
First example: E-mail environment
This section talks about a simple example of data flow in the Outlook e-mail
application, which many businesses use.
Figure 4-4 shows the information flow through only principal components.
For example, e-mail that flows between the mail server and the Internet goes
through the firewall and spam filter that appear in the diagram, but you can
most likely find network devices in the path that don’t appear in the diagram,
including one or more routers, switches, and security appliances. But for the
purpose of e-mail, those other network devices are extraneous — they’re just
the plumbing.

81
Chapter 4: Mapping Business Functions to Infrastructure

Similarly, the flow of e-mail between the mail server and e-mail clients (in
other words, end-user workstations that run Outlook) also travels through
one or more devices — routers, switches, and so on (devices that don’t
appear in Figure 4-4).
The purpose of the data flow diagram isn’t to identify every component in the
application ecosystem, but rather to identify all of the active components in
the ecosystem — those components that play an actual role in the ecosystem.
In an e-mail environment, mail servers, spam filters, and clients count as active
components, but pass-through devices, such as routers and switches, don’t
count. You have ample time to go back and identify individual devices — I
cover that in the section “Infrastructure diagrams and schematics,” later in this
chapter.
Second example: Client/server application
This section discusses a somewhat more complex application, one that 
has more pieces and parts, to show how you can depict an application envi-
ronment’s components in a data flow diagram. Figure 4-5 shows a financial
management application that an organization runs in-house.
This example shows a more complex set of servers, storage, and data 
flows between the subject application and external applications. The diagram
includes a back-end database server, multiple application and Web servers, 
a reporting server, a data warehouse, an OLAP system (Online Analytical
Processing system — another type of data warehouse system), and (of course)

end users. The e-mail server also appears in the diagram because the applica-
tion generates alerts to the end users. The diagram also includes a check-
printing workstation — which is also an end-user workstation, but it’s a
special one because the check printer is directly attached to it.
The diagram also shows external feeds — data that flows from external
sources (manufacturing, stock options, payroll, and business subsidiaries, in
this example) into the financial system. Knowing about these connections to
or from the outside world is essential if you want to have complete knowledge
about not only the application, but all of the internal and external entities with
which the application must communicate on a regular basis in order to work
properly.
Don’t try to jam all of the components of a complex system onto one piece of
paper. Instead, rely on several illustrations that cover all the details, which
you can put together to see the big picture.
Third example: External application
Because of the lower operational costs, organizations are flocking to ASP
(Application Service Provider) models, now known as SaaS (Software as a
Service) application models, in droves. In this section’s example, an organi-
zation uses an application for internal business use, and the application is
hosted by a service provider. Examples of this type of service provider
include SalesForce.com, Intaact, and Winweb. Figure 4-6 shows such an envi-
ronment, including data flows between the organization, service providers,
and other internal and external objects.

83
Chapter 4: Mapping Business Functions to Infrastructure

In this example, three service providers — payroll management, an AR/AP
(accounts receivable/accounts payable) service, and a stock management ser-
vice — provide services to the organization, doing so through bi-directional
data feeds between the organization and each of the service providers.
Banks are shown as a network cloud, signifying that the organization (and the
AR/AP service) have established connections with several banks, presumably
for processing electronic payments and receipts.
These external services have data feeds (in batches or real time — at this level
of detail, it doesn’t matter which) that connect the organization’s financial and
payroll applications.
The diagram clearly shows which applications and functions are internal 
to the organization and which are external. You need to distinguish internal
versus external because this distinction influences the BIA (Business Impact
Analysis), risk assessments, and actual DR plans. Recovering an in-house
system is far different from recovering the ability to use an external service.
Both internal and external applications may share some infrastructure (the
network, for instance), but they require different recovery approaches.
The diagram’s connectors between users and many of the system components
also implies user interaction with each of the internal and external services.
The diagram needs to show where user interaction occurs because user inter-
action with applications and services is usually essential to the continued
operation of critical processes. The node labeled gateway (which connects the
external payroll and AR/AP services together) has no user interaction. This
lack of interaction, along with the fact that it’s called gateway, identifies it as a
back-end system that facilitates data transfers between services but otherwise
requires no interaction with users. User interaction with specific application
components is a subtle detail that matters in the long-run because recovery
procedures need to include steps for user connectivity to all critical systems.
Infrastructure diagrams and schematics
Infrastructure diagrams, often referred to as schematics, are bottom-up.
Infrastructure diagrams are the schematics (or diagrams) that show every
piece and part in an environment. If you’re a stickler for details, you’ll have
fun identifying what makes up your environment.
So how do you go about creating these drawings? You can take a number of
approaches. You need to do a bit of thinking to figure out what may work best
for you. Here are the activities that I discuss in the following sections:
 Interview subject matter experts.
 Get information from systems management tools.
84
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

 Go on walkabouts and have a look at equipment and systems for yourself.
 Look at inventory lists to get an idea of the systems and devices that exist
(although you still have to figure out the relationships and connectivity
between them).
Depending on the size of your environment, a single individual may be able 
to carry out all of these activities. But in a larger environment, you may need
a team of people to get it done.
Interviewing subject matter experts
You can begin putting the overall infrastructure schematic together by inter-
viewing network and systems engineers, and getting from each what informa-
tion you can in order to figure out how your environment was put together.
In all but the simplest environments, you’ll probably encounter one or two
anomalies, such as
 Conflicts: Ted says something is put together this way, but Bill says it’s
done that way. What really matters is the truth: How does it really work?
If you come across such a conflict, someone needs to help the experts
decide — or you need to find another expert!
 Gaps: You may find a part of the network or systems environment that
no one knows about. Perhaps the person who built it isn’t around any
longer, he or she didn’t write any documentation about it, and no one
else has bothered to figure it out.
Using network and systems management tools
Someone in the IT group may have tools, such as network discovery or 
mapping tools, that provide some network architecture information that you
can use as a starting point.
Here are some examples of the kinds of discover and mapping tools that can
give you some indication of the network architecture:
 High-end tools: High-priced and comprehensive tools that larger organiza-
tions use to perform a wide variety of network and device management
functions. Here are some examples:
• HP OpenView (www.openview.hp.com/products): Expensive
enterprise-level tool. If your organization already has it, one of the
people using it should be able to get you some network maps.
• IBM NetView (www.ibm.com/software/tivoli/products/
netview): A high-end full-function network management tool.
85
Chapter 4: Mapping Business Functions to Infrastructure

• Sun Solstice Enterprise Manager (www.sun.com/sem): A high-end
environment.
• LANsurveyor (www.neon.com/LSwin.shtml): A tool that maps
and diagrams a network in real time.
• netViz (www.netviz.com): A network visualization tool.
 Less expensive/free tools: These tools provide some basic functionality
for diagramming networks:
• Network Magic (www.networkmagic.com): A workstation-based
tool that includes diagramming and other functions. Comes in eval-
uation and fee-based versions.
• Cheops (www.sourceforge.net/projects/cheops-ng): Free
tool for mapping and monitoring a network. Figure 4-7 shows a
screen shot from this tool.
• FreeMap (www.qualys.com/products/trials): This free tool is
run from a central location, so your network needs to be reachable
through the Internet. This tool probably can’t map the portion of
your network that’s behind a firewall. (See Figure 4-8.)
Figure 4-7:
Cheops, a
network
mapping
tool.
86
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Even good network mapping tools can’t identify every device or system in
your network — omissions can occur for a variety of technical reasons,
including
 Non-managed and non-networked devices: A device on the network
that doesn’t have IP connectivity, such as a dial-in terminal server,
modem, CSU/DSU, DACS, and so on.
 Invisible devices: Mapping tools probably won’t see a non-managed hub
that doesn’t have an IP address.
 Bridging firewalls: Firewalls are like hubs, in that they don’t have IP
addresses. For that reason, they’re invisible. (A separate management
port, however, might be visible on the network.)
 Not powered on: Of course, mapping or management tools can’t see
devices that aren’t turned on. Those powered-down devices could still
be vital, if not critical — for example, cold standby servers and devices
that are swapped into service if online components fail.
Network management and mapping tools may not detect systems and
devices on the other side of a firewall, so you may need to use these tools
from different logical places on the network to discover everything.
Even if you have maps that appear to be complete, you still want to interview
subject matter experts to validate what the mapping tools have discovered.
(The preceding section discusses these interviews.)

87
Chapter 4: Mapping Business Functions to Infrastructure

Going on walkabouts
A picture paints a thousand words. Whoever creates, verifies, or updates
drawings and schematics should get out of his or her chair and have a look 
at the systems and networks in those drawings.
Bring a subject matter expert (SME) with you. Have him or her point out 
the servers and devices from your drawing. Be inquisitive: Look around, ask
questions, follow cables to see where they go. You might find something that
your SME forgot or didn’t even know about.
Looking at inventory lists
If you can find them, lists of equipment are another place to start. Granted,
inventory lists don’t give you much of a clue as to the relationships between
devices, but if such a list is all you have, it’s a starting point.
Inventory lists can also supplement other data gathering methods, such as
interviewing subject matter experts and creating diagrams and schematics.
Here are some potential advantages of inventory lists:
 Inventory lists contain devices and systems that you may otherwise miss.
 If you can find the person who created the inventory list, that person
may be able to help explain how everything works together.
 The creation of an inventory list may help you understand the flow or
functions of various networks or systems.
Some disadvantages include
 Inventory lists may not differentiate systems and devices that are in 
production use versus development, test, or lab use.
 Inventory lists might not indicate that systems and devices are no longer
in use. Just because the device is listed doesn’t mean it’s critical, powered
on, or even still present.
Even though inventory lists aren’t the best way to determine what components
are critical for the performance of an application, good inventory lists may add
value to the effort.
Even if you have network management systems and mapping tools, still com-
pare what those programs find against your inventory so you can validate the
completeness of those programs’ results.
Developing the schematics
Describing the steps for drawing a network schematic is a little bit like telling
someone how to paint a still-life painting. It’s part art and part science. Don’t
worry about right or wrong methods to depict application environments —
88
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

just create a schematic that can help the reader better understand how a
system or network is designed and how it works.
You can lay out a schematic in two primary ways:
 Location-based: The arrangement of components on a diagram roughly
corresponds to those components’ actual locations. For a large network,
you could base the diagram’s layout geographically. On a smaller scale,
you could correspond the diagram’s components to the real components’
locations on a corporate campus.
 Function-based: Arrange the layout of elements on a diagram according
to their function or application.
Figure 4-9 shows a schematic of a portion of a nationwide network. The draw-
ing identifies individual components. However, additional levels of detail can
show additional components, with high-level (perhaps national) diagrams
illustrating major components, and regional or local diagrams showing 
individual components in local networks.
The example schematic in Figure 4-9 shows a part of what appears to be a
regional or national network. Two ATM switches, FR17 and FR18, connect to
what appears to be a fiber ring, one part going towards Vancouver, BC and
the other going towards Portland, OR. Full-mesh connections go from these
two ATM switches to a pair of routers, SEART01 and SEART02. Behind those
routers are more routers and also some switches, each feeding to specific
locations and functions.

Chapter 4: Mapping Business Functions to Infrastructure

This network needs additional drawings, one for each of the functions shown:
R&D Lab, Field Lab, Production Data Center, Development Lab, Test Lab, and
End Users. This high-level diagram doesn’t show individual components for
those locations. You can usually show those details much more easily in indi-
vidual diagrams because the overall network is way too complicated to
include all the components in a single drawing.
The example in Figure 4-9 shows network components only, no servers or
other components. You need other logical or physical diagrams to depict
servers and other devices, including how or where they connect to networks.
Developing and maintaining schematics is a serious undertaking that requires
a long-term commitment. However, DR isn’t the only function that benefits
from such drawings: Network engineering, capacity planning, troubleshooting,
and future expansion can all use schematics.
Identifying Dependencies
Creating inventories is practically child’s play. Developing data flow diagrams
and schematics is a bit more challenging because you have to figure out 
how and where data comes and goes. But the identification of dependencies
between systems, devices, and yet-to-be-discovered components will really
bake your noodle. It’s the answer to the question, “If I unplug this, what will
stop working?”
I don’t recommend trying to answer that question by actually unplugging 
systems or devices. Instead, fall back on these proven methods of gathering
information:
 Interviews: Identify subject matter experts and talk with them about
systems, networks, and applications. Specifically, ask what internal (to
the system), internal (to the organization), and external dependencies
exist between devices, systems, and applications.
 Configurations: You or someone with administrative privileges needs to
examine system configurations, devices, and applications, and identify
external services, systems, devices, and so on.
 Management tools and applications: Perhaps your organization is
already using tools and applications to configure and manage systems
and devices. For instance, you might have a configuration management
database (CMDB) and companion application that you use to manage
devices, systems, and/or applications in your organization. If your organi-
zation does have a CMDB, you might be using standard server images
(standard versions and configurations), which probably means that most
or all of your servers are configured almost identically. This consistency
makes the task of identifying dependencies considerably simpler.
90
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Why identify dependencies? Your mission in this phase of the disaster recov-
ery project is to identify systems that are critical to the support of business
processes. The systems that support business processes aren’t just the sys-
tems with the applications, but also everything else that you need to keep
those systems running properly.
The following sections discuss dependencies in greater detail. If you’re a 
propeller-head, you can have a lot of fun in these sections!
Inter-system dependencies
Dependencies may exist within and between systems within your organization.
You need to know these dependencies if you want to create high-quality DR
plans.
You can find many layers of dependencies in application environments. Even
if I had a lot of time on my hands, I’m not sure that I could create a complete
list. In this book, I break the layers down by category. But your organization
may have more categories than I list in this section. The categories I use are
 System dependencies
 Communications dependencies
 Network service dependencies
 Management service dependencies
 Security dependencies
 Application dependencies
The nature of your business or your applications may necessitate additional
categories of dependencies. For instance, you might have dependencies
based on security level, organization department, customer, and so on.
System dependencies
System dependencies include features, tools, and other components on a
specific system that an application (or other component in the stack)
requires to function properly, such as
 Hardware configuration: The basics — how much memory, disk space,
other components, and also CMOS/BIOS and other hardware-level 
configurations each system contains.
 Boot options: Does each server need any non-default boot configurations
or options to work correctly? Does the server boot from an image on a
SAN (Storage Area Network) or other external disk storage?
91
Chapter 4: Mapping Business Functions to Infrastructure

 Clustering and failover: Organizations often set up clusters of servers
with failover or load-balancing capabilities for time-critical applications. 
I discuss failover and load balancing in detail in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8.
 Inter-Process Communications (IPC): Sockets, shared memory, messages,
and so on. How many do you have, how big are they, what are their
security settings, and so on.
 Service configuration: Does each server have any non-standard services
or configurations that it needs to operate properly? Examples include 
disabled services that are normally enabled (and vice versa), different 
service restart parameters, and so on.
 Storage configuration: Minimally, applications or services may depend
on disk and file system configuration settings. If the system has on-board
or attached RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks, which I explain
in Chapter 7) or other storage, that storage matters, too.
 User accounts: Do specific user accounts need to be on the system for
each system to function properly, or must certain accounts be configured
in particular ways?
 Software tools: The possibilities are practically endless. A few examples
include
• Disk management tools
• User authentication tools
• Management agents
• Security tools
 Network services on the system: Network features and tools on the
system itself, not elsewhere in the network. These dependencies include
incoming/outgoing e-mail (must a service or daemon be running on the
system for e-mail communications to work?), domain name service (DNS),
Network Time Protocol (NTP), remote console (incoming, outgoing, or
both), and potentially many more.
If you have system management tools, they manage most of the dependencies
in the preceding list, which makes servers and other devices a little easier for
you to manage.
Communications dependencies
Everything is networked (well, almost). Your application servers communicate
with users, services, and other applications. This category includes the 
following communications dependencies:
 Network configuration: Some of the settings that may matter include
the settings for the DHCP server, DNS servers, subnet mask, gateways,
routing table entries, and so on.
92
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

 Host-to-host communication: For example, is IPSec or GRE tunneling, 
or SSH, set up between hosts?
 Fibre Channel to SAN: The configuration of communications to a
Storage Area Network (SAN) may be critical on some systems.
Network service dependencies
This section deals with network services that exist somewhere within the
organization. Those services may or may not be hosted on whichever system
you’re analyzing at the time. Examples of these services include
 Identity management: Identity management matters if the system
authenticates users by using a network-based service. The system must
be configured to properly connect to the right service in the right way.
 Two-factor authentication: Although authentication is technically a part
of identity management, it’s worth mentioning in its own bullet because
you usually have a separate infrastructure involved.
 E-mail: What organization doesn’t have it? Critical applications often
depend on e-mail to communicate status to users and sometimes even
to transfer data between applications.
 Web services: Application interfaces based on SOAP (Simple Object
Access Protocol, and also Service-Oriented Architecture Protocol) and
other technologies.
 PBX (Telephone systems), VoIP: PBXs, whether the IP kind or older 
ones, are increasingly digital and networked. VoIP, or Voice over TCP/IP, is
totally networked. Although systems themselves may not depend on the
VoIP systems, some VoIP systems depend on communications servers or
gateways, especially in call centers and other environments in which
applications control phone usage to some extent.
 Fax: Usually human-operated at one or both ends, but often on the critical
path for business processes.
 Proxy servers and gateways: They come in all shapes and sizes; you
may think of only Web proxy servers, but you can find proxy servers and
gateways that fulfill many other functions, as well.
 Backup: Organizations generally perform a central back up, using a 
dedicated backup server.
 Data replication: May or may not be a part of a server or database 
cluster. But the data goes to another server or storage system in near-
real time.
 Network time: NTP (Network Time Protocol), the protocol used to syn-
chronize the time-of-day clocks on systems and network devices. System
clocks are notorious for drift (when clocks stray from the correct time;
with enough drift, the strangest malfunctions can occur), and NTP is the
standard solution.

Chapter 4: Mapping Business Functions to Infrastructure

Management service dependencies
Services that are specific to the management of systems, devices, applica-
tions, and so forth have their own dependencies. Some items you may need
include
 Agents for patch management: Agented patch management systems
require an agent on each system in order to properly detect the presence
of software patches.
 Agents for capacity management: When your system gets low on
memory or disk space, does it send alerts or traps (messages) to a man-
agement console?
 Agents for alert management: When the system experiences an error
(such as service failure or hardware failure), does it send traps to a 
management console?
Security dependencies
When I talk about security dependencies, I mean security mechanisms or set-
tings that the application or service needs to run, security that organization
policy may require, or security that’s just a good idea. Some possibilities
include
 Firewall: Critical in some environments, a great idea in others. Protects
applications from unwanted network traffic, including the kind of traffic
that can make an application (or service) malfunction or fail.
 Anti-virus: Maybe your application doesn’t require an anti-virus program,
but just try and convince others that it’s unnecessary.
 IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention System):
On-board IDS, which usually runs as some sort of a daemon or service, or
shim in the IP stack. It listens to network traffic and alerts on anomalies.
 Integrity management: Tools such as Tripwire may be present and crucial
for security and quality management.
 PKI (Public Key Infrastructure): Your application may depend on exter-
nally served encryption keys that may be on a key server or an appliance.
Application dependencies
Sometimes, one application depends on another for proper functioning.
Hopefully, these examples can help you identify specific dependencies in
your environment:
 Data feeds: One application may require a continuous (or batched) feed
of transactions from other applications in order to work properly (or to
just avoid null results).
 Interfaces: Applications often communicate with each other in real time
in order to work properly.
94
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Other dependencies
Heaven forbid, but businesses often have dependencies on end-user worksta-
tions. For instance, financial reporting may depend on someone’s spreadsheet
macros to crunch the numbers in ways that the financial management system
just can’t do. Having critical processes depend on specific end-user worksta-
tions is almost always a bad idea because workstations are nowhere near as
robust as servers. Also, because they’re in the hands of users, they’re subject
to changes that the IT department can’t control.
External dependencies
Applications and services may require services or functions external to the
enterprise in order to function properly, if at all. These services and functions
include
 E-mail: The ubiquitous messaging platform used to transport not just
messages but also data between entities.
 Voice communications: Oh yeah, people need to be able to communi-
cate with each other via voice. Not always tied directly to applications,
but often tied directly to processes.
 Fax: Like voice communications, fax communications can be essential 
or even critical to the recovery of business processes.
 Domain name service (DNS): Absolutely necessary for any network
communications. DNS translates domain names (such as www.avaya.
com) into the IP addresses that systems actually use to communicate
with each other.
 World Wide Web: Sometimes required by applications, frequently
required by people, and sometimes on the critical path of vital business
processes.
 Federated identity: Some environments use federated identity for user
identity management. You need to understand the data architecture and
data flows if your organization uses federated identity.
 PKI: Your applications or supporting infrastructure might depend on an
external key services provider for encryption, decryption, or verification
of data.
 Online language translators: Some organizations that have constituents
in many languages use external online language translators to understand
their inbound messages or to translate outbound ones.
 External service providers: The functions that applications use in exter-
nal service providers, such as Salesforce.com and Winweb, could be on
the critical path of internal applications and services.
95
Chapter 4: Mapping Business Functions to Infrastructure

Generally speaking, you may want to pay attention to the two types of external
dependencies:
 External dependencies for external functions: Functions that run on
external systems may depend on other external systems or services. For
example, in order to send an e-mail message from your business to some
external addressee, DNS connectivity to the outside world must function
so your mail server can get the IP address for the addressee’s mail
server.
 External dependencies for internal functions: Functions that take place
inside your network but depend on some external resource. For example,
a currency conversion tool runs internally, but it requires a daily refresh
of conversion rates which originates from someplace outside the organi-
zation. The currency conversion tool may work perfectly today, but if it
can’t get new rates tonight, it may not work accurately tomorrow.

Planning User Recovery
In This Chapter
 Making sure end-user workstations keep working
 Keeping end users communicating
P
eople are an essential part of all critical business processes. Even highly-
automated business processes would soon break down without human
involvement, guidance, and intervention.
Recovering users means recovering their workstations and their ability to
communicate with people inside and outside of their organization. You have
to analyze a lot of details to understand the role of end users’ workstations
and communications needs in critical business processes.
In this chapter, I discuss various aspects of recovering user workstations,
including
 Web terminals (primarily used just as a Web browser)
 Client-side applications and tools
 Access to centrally located information
In this chapter, I also discuss recovering users’ communication needs, including
 Voice communications
 E-mail
 Fax and instant messaging (IM)
Recovering these capabilities requires recovery plans that quickly restore
users’ ability to perform their tasks and support critical business processes.
This chapter focuses on identifying important issues. When you know these
issues, you can help develop the appropriate recovery activities.

In the event that the facilities where your employees work are also damaged
in a disaster, those facilities also require recovery efforts. You can read about
activities related to recovering facilities and work centers in Chapter 6.
Managing and Recovering
End-User Computing
People play a vital role in the operation of business processes. Increasingly, the
people portion of business processes involves the use of desktop or notebook
computers. End-user computing varies widely, depending on the tasks that
each employee performs during his or her workday. Some examples include
 Using e-mail to send and receive notifications from applications and
other users
 Accessing company Web-based applications
 Accessing external Web-based applications
 Accessing client/server applications
 Accessing and working with documents on file servers
 Accessing and working with documents on the workstation
For some of the functions in the preceding list, the user’s workstation is little
more than a terminal. For other functions, the workstation acts as a local pro-
cessing and/or data resource.
Most users use both the terminal aspects and the local processing aspects of
their workstations, but both functions aren’t necessarily critical for all
people, processes, or tasks.
One of the purposes of the Business Impact Analysis is the careful analysis of
business processes. That analysis helps you figure out what functions are
critical for any given process or task.
Because employees may use workstations in many different ways, managing
and recovering those workstations involves a wide variety of approaches.
The following sections discuss these different approaches for managing and
recovering workstations, as though they were separate environments:
 As terminals
 As a means to access centralized information
 As application clients
 As local computers
98
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Regardless of which of the functions in the preceding list are in play, you also
need to figure out how to manage and recover workstation operating systems.
I’m not pretending that employees use end-user workstations exclusively as
terminals, or application clients, or local computing resources. Most users
utilize their workstations for a combination of tasks. I look at each of these uses
separately in the following sections, effectively dissecting users’ work patterns.
Although employees frequently use end-user workstations in a variety of modes,
you need to consider only the uses that are key to specific business processes.
Workstations as Web terminals
From a disaster recovery point of view, the easiest function to recover on
end-user workstations is their use as terminals — especially if those terminal
functions use native components, such as Web browser software. But even in
this simple case, several factors require consideration:
 Plug-ins
 Mashups
 Web browser configurations
The following sections discuss these factors.
Application plug-ins
Just because you access one or more of your critical applications via Web
browsers doesn’t mean your DR planning efforts are going to be issue-free.
When you’re mapping out all the moving parts and pieces of an end-to-end
application environment, you need to identify all Web browser plug-ins that
your Web applications require to operate properly.
Some examples of Web applications include, but are certainly not limited to,
the following:
 Adobe Acrobat: To read PDF files
 Apple Quicktime: To play video and audio clips
 Adobe Flash: To display Web pages’ rich Flash content
 Shockwave: To display Web pages’ Shockwave content
 Windows Media Player and other media players: To play video and
audio clips
 Document viewers: To view documents, spreadsheets, presentations,
project plans, technical drawings, and so on
99
Chapter 5: Planning User Recovery

 Java Virtual Machine (JVM): To run Java applets
 Custom plug-ins: Developed by your organization or a third party
If your critical Web application(s) use plug-ins, take a closer look at those
plug-ins. Some of the issues related to plug-ins and other browser add-ons
that may need attention are
 Installation and update: Where do your required plug-ins come from —
are they hosted by your application server or a third party, or do they
come from external sources?
 Configuration: Do any of your plug-ins require configuration, and do
those configurations have default or non-default settings?
 Management: Do the plug-ins require central management via IT infra-
structure management tools or by the end users themselves?
 Access control: Do the plug-ins require access to other resources, such
as files on the end-user workstation or elsewhere in the environment?
You usually need to dissect your end-user workstations to answer the ques-
tions in the preceding list and identify other issues that may make the differ-
ence between easily recovered end-user workstations and those that just
won’t work despite a lot of troubleshooting.
Managing mashups
Some Web-based applications have code that brings in content and functions
from a lot of different applications at the same time. Mashups use APIs
(Application Programming Interfaces — ways of getting at information from
within another program) from various Web sites, blending code from these
different sources to create the result seen in the browser window. Here are
examples of some visually interesting mashups:
 HousingMaps.com: A mashup of Craigslist classified ads and Google
Maps. HousingMaps.com shows individual classified ads against a
Google Maps backdrop, allowing the user to choose items by their visual
location. Clicking a pin brings up an Ajax window with the address and
thumbnails. You can see HousingMaps.com in Figure 5-1.
 Chicagocrime.org: This mashup shows reported crimes of various types
against street maps of the city of Chicago.
In some critical environments, such as the sites in the preceding list, mashups
aren’t small potatoes — they’re necessary elements of an application.
Applications that don’t have well-documented specifications make you do
some sleuthing to discover mashups. You can start by talking with the appli-
cation’s Web developers. Then, you have to do some analysis to determine
whether any of the mashups you found are critical to the user experience or
are merely nice-to-have features.
100
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Mashup Web sites don’t necessarily increase application risks with regards to
disaster recovery. They do make applications more complex, however. You
definitely need to identify mashups in business applications so you can
develop proper DR plans for those applications.
The casual observer may not easily see mashup code in a Web-based business
application. You may need to conduct interviews with system designers to
identify any mashups in business applications.
Recovery notes for workstations as Web terminals
In this section, I discuss specific recovery efforts that an organization might
take in order to get workstations as Web terminals up and running as quickly
as possible during and after a disaster.
Many of the concepts in the following list are proactive in nature — they’re
things you need to do far in advance before a disaster occurs:
 Use standard configurations for Web terminal workstations. Developing
and sticking to standard configurations has many business benefits,
including recoverability. Ensure that standard configurations include all
necessary plug-ins, document viewers, network configurations, authenti-
cation settings, and other items necessary for the workstations’ proper
function.

and Google

101
Chapter 5: Planning User Recovery

 Use imaging technology for standard configurations. Using standard
images permits your IT department to quickly build (meaning install and
configure the operating system, applications, and tools for) replacement
workstations.
 Build workstation images for a variety of hardware configurations.
Having these images increases the likelihood that IT staff will be able to
build workstations by using not only the hardware that your organization
uses on a regular basis, but also other hardware that you use less often.
 Consider using a thin-client workstation model for production use, as
well as for recovery purposes. Thin-client technology, such as Citrix,
permits workstations to act as terminals, even when the workstation uses
programs such as Word and Excel, which are actually run on a central
server rather than locally on the workstation. A thin-client environment
greatly simplifies centralized management and configuration of client-side
software.
 Back up workstation imaging systems so that you can quickly rebuild
them in a disaster. These backups facilitate the rapid recovery of end-
user workstations.
Also consider the workstation operating system recovery issues discussed in
the section “Managing and recovering workstation operating systems,” later
in this chapter.
Workstation access to centralized
information
I would argue that a sensible organization promotes (if not requires) that doc-
uments, spreadsheets, and other files are stored centrally on servers, rather
than solely on user workstations.
Workstations that function as Web terminals, distributed application clients, and
standalone computing platforms also need access to centralized information,
often in similar ways and requiring some common features and services to do so.
The types of server access workstations require include to
 File and print servers
 Web servers
 Application servers
I explore these types of access in more detail in the following sections.
102
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Accessing file and print servers
File servers store information for workgroups, departments, and organizations,
often organizing the information into hierarchies of folders. IT departments
often set up one or more drive letter mappings, in which they map a PC-like
drive letter, such as M:, to a file server name, such as \\server2\depts\
legal. Linux and Mac systems use different mechanisms than Windows, but
the effect is the same.
Print servers operate similarly, except that they facilitate access to network-
or direct-attached printers, plotters, and other output devices.
Here are the primary issues related to file and print server access:
 Mapping: Whether through Windows drive mapping, shortcuts and
links, Samba, or NFS (Network File System), end-user workstations
require some configuration information so they can find the server.
 Authentication: Users need to authenticate to the network, or to servers
directly, in order to access files and printers.
 Access controls: File and print servers use access controls that determine
which users can access directories, files, and printers.
 Directory service: Applications need domain name service (DNS) or
Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) so user workstations can locate
systems on the corporate network, such as application servers, file servers,
and print servers, as well as systems on the Internet.
Accessing Web servers
Web servers facilitate access to both static content and information in
applications. Web-server access issues include
 Authentication: Users often need to be authenticated to networks
and/or applications in order to access content on Web servers.
 Access controls: Web servers use access controls to determine which
users and groups are permitted to access specific information in the
Web server.
 Directory service: Workstations need domain name service (DNS) so
they can locate Web servers on the network.
Accessing application servers
Application servers run software programs that are a part of a business applica-
tion. Client/server and distributed application environments also have separate
application components installed on end-user workstations. This client/side 
software needs to be able to communicate with application servers.
103
Chapter 5: Planning User Recovery

Issues related to application server access include
 Authentication: Applications need to know who’s requesting access.
Usually, the client-side component collects user credentials and passes
them to the application, which then must consult an internal database
or a network-based authentication service to validate the user.
 Directory service: Workstations need domain name service (DNS) so end-
user workstations can find servers and other resources on the network.
Recovery notes for workstation access to central information
When end-user workstations need to access various types of information on
the network, file servers, Web servers, and application servers manage this
access. Consider these tips for preparation and recovery:
 Properly configure DNS and/or WINS so end-user workstations can find
these servers on the network.
 Include a network authentication service so users can identify themselves
to servers and other resources.
 Make the entire set of access control permissions within servers easily
recoverable and transferable to replacement servers so the same access
controls protect information in a recovery environment.
 Regularly back up servers — or replicate data to off-site servers — so
you can recover data in the event of a disaster.
 Set up a replacement network that has different IP (Internet Protocol)
address numbering and different logical and physical architecture so
you can transfer the entire set of workstation-server interaction if you
need to.
 Consider bandwidth-intensive interactions between servers and worksta-
tions for optimization. In a recovery environment, servers and workstations
may be separated by considerable distance and/or slow networks.
Workstations as application clients
Client/server computing revolutionized computing in the early 1990s by free-
ing up valuable resources on central computers and moving UI (user inter-
face) logic out to end-user workstations that had relatively ample computing
power. Many organizations implemented client/server applications, and
many of those applications are still in use today.
One of the issues that was often overlooked in client/server computing was
the burden of managing client-side software and related configurations.
Network-based workstation management software was still in its infancy, but
even in today’s more advanced management platforms, managing client/side
104
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

software is still a major chore for IT shops. So, naturally, you need to make
the whole matter of client-side software management a part of your DR plans
if you have any client/server software.
Often, client/server software has multiple client-side components, including
 Base software: Software installed on application servers
 Client-side application business logic: Software installed on workstations
 Configuration data: Settings that determine how base software and
client-side software communicate with each other
 Patches: Fixes and updates made to the base software and client-side
software since initial installation
When I use the term client/server in this book, I mostly refer to distributed,
two-tier, three-tier, or multi-tier applications with some of the pieces running
on your end-user workstations.
The following sections delve into the management and recovery of these
components in greater detail.
Client/server base software
Some client/server environments use a standard client-side software package
installation, plus separate programs or scripts for each business application.
A number of questions and issues about client/server base software arise:
 Installation: Can you make the base software a part of the workstation
image? Can you automatically install it over the network? To install the
software, does a human need to enter a license code or configuration data?
 Availability: Is the version you’re using still generally available?
 Release/installation media: Do you have portable release or installation
media for the software?
 Compatibility with newer operating systems: Does the base software
work with newer versions of Windows and other operating systems?
The questions in the preceding list indicate that you’re dealing with old soft-
ware. Client/server environments aren’t in this season, and they haven’t been
for quite a while. The main question you need to ask about your client/server
software is, “Could I rebuild the client side of my client/server environment if
I had to rebuild it from scratch?” The preceding list should help you find the
answer.
105
Chapter 5: Planning User Recovery

Client-side business logic
Client/server applications have some of the application code running on the
server and some running on the client. On the client side, the software is
installed and updated in some manner. You can use some of the following
mechanisms to get client-side software onto the workstation:
 Written (and, optionally, compiled) by a developer and installed through
an updating mechanism within the client/server environment
 Written by a developer and installed through a separate updating
mechanism, such as Microsoft SMS (Systems Management Server)
 Written by a developer and installed manually by IT personnel, either in
person or through an Internet (or intranet) connection
The preceding list isn’t all-inclusive, but it can jog your memory about the
possible means by which client-side software in a client/server environment
finds its way to the clients — your end-user workstations. You can find infor-
mation in the manuals that came with the base software — hopefully, some-
one has saved those manuals!
Client-side configuration data
Depending on which client/server environment you’re using, your end-user
workstations may have another dimension to consider — configuration settings
in the workstation’s client/server software. Configuration settings may be
separate from the client-side code itself. Centralized management tools may
manage those settings, or you may have to make any adjustments manually
on each workstation.
Here are some of the possible configuration settings:
 Server name
 Port number to use when communicating with the server
 Authentication settings
 Behavior settings, such as initial views
 Usability settings, such as colors and fonts
Some of these settings are critical to the basic function of the application, but
others are more for the user’s convenience and preferences. All of the set-
tings in the preceding list, except for usability settings, may govern whether
the application functions.
Determine whether all the end-user workstations in a given client/server
environment require and have the same configuration settings, different
classes of workstations have their own settings, or configurations are more
chaotic with no rhyme or reason behind the variations in settings.
106
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Client-side patches
Your client/server environment may use patches to get software, application,
or configuration updates out to client systems. If your environment uses
patches, it may have its own patching mechanism, or it may use a centralized
mechanism, such as Microsoft SMS (Systems Management Server), or a third-
party tool, such as Blade Logic.
Consider the following client software patching issues:
 Does the client/server environment use patching at the application level?
 Can you use a management view to determine which clients have which
patches installed?
 Is the historical record of patching well documented?
The answers to the questions in the preceding list can tell you how to make
updates to client-side software, as well as determine what patches are on
your client workstations today. I discuss patching in more detail in the sec-
tion “Managing and recovering workstation operating systems,” later in this
chapter.
Recovery notes for workstations as application clients
The following list gives you some specific preparation and recovery actions
that you can take to get end-user workstations that have client/server soft-
ware back on the air:
 To the greatest extent reasonably possible, use standard configurations
for client/server workstations. Standard configurations also help
reduce support costs. Ensure that standard configurations include all
necessary components, from base software to application code and con-
figuration, and whatever OS settings are required to support the software.
 Use imaging technology and tools that can help you quickly build
replacement client/server workstations. Test your images in a variety
of workstation types: In a disaster scenario, you may have to build work-
stations on hardware platforms that you don’t routinely work with.
 Consider a thin-client environment, with client/server software
installed on servers, reducing workstations to smart terminals. 
Thin-client technology, such as Citrix, enables the organization to centralize
client-side software installation, configuration, and maintenance.
 Back up workstation imaging systems. If you can recover those imaging
systems in a disaster, you can use them to build new client/server work-
stations, as needed.
The section “Managing and recovering workstation operating systems,” later
in this chapter, explains how to recover the base operating system on end-
user workstations.
107
Chapter 5: Planning User Recovery

Is it any wonder that organizations are trending away from client/server com-
puting to Web-based applications? The responsibility of managing software
and configurations on hundreds or thousands of computers is more than
most IT departments can shoulder.
Workstations as local computers
Many workers in an organization use their workstations to compose and
manage documents, spreadsheets, presentations, technical drawings, and
project plans. Workstations may have additional software tools for applica-
tion development and testing, data analysis and modeling, graphical model-
ing, statistical analysis, and who knows what else.
Often, users store the data (the actual files or databases that they create and
use) locally on the workstation, especially when the workstation is a laptop.
You need to decide whether using these other programs is truly critical to
specific business processes or whether end-user workstations are more ancillary
to these processes. Are workstations, acting as local computers, really on the
critical path for a given process, or do they have a non-critical role?
The management and recovery of workstations as local computers have
three important aspects:
 Programs: The application programs that you use to create and manage
documents and data.
 Data: The data that users create and work with on their workstations.
 Procedure: Documents about the use of local programs, in terms of its
support of critical business processes.
The three classes of information in the preceding list differ greatly in terms of
management and recovery. When you determine that workstations fall in the
critical path of business processes, both programs and data are vital, but you
manage them in different ways.
Workstation software
A successful disaster recovery effort needs to manage the local software for
workstations on the critical path of business processes. Consider these factors
as you build your DR plans:
 Installation: What method do you use to install programs into the local
workstations? Are the programs part of a standard workstation image, or
do you install them by using an install image on a server? Did the end
108
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

user purchase the software directly? How do end users or the IT depart-
ment manage activation keys? What installation options are chosen?
(Now you know why IT departments are averse to a lot of non-standard
tools on workstations!)
 Configuration: Are configuration settings centrally managed, or does
each end user control them? If more than one end user performs similar
tasks, do they all use identical configurations?
 Versioning: Does IT control which versions of software tools get
installed and maintained on workstations? Do workstations have the
latest versions or some older versions? Can these older versions be
installed on newly-built workstations? Will the vendor provide license
keys for the older versions that you still use?
 Patches: Do the programs on end-user workstations have patches
installed? Are those patches configured to check for and install updates?
Do the end-user workstations need access to release media in order to
install patches? Do patches alter the behavior of the software, potentially
altering the business process (or other systems)? Do you maintain any
central management or recordkeeping related to patches?
 Configuration: Document settings associated with the correct operation
of the program, rather than the look-and-feel preferences (although
those preferences are important, too, because they help make end-user
procedures more consistently match the actual appearance that the
workstation software imparts).
The issues in the preceding list should get you thinking about your own envi-
ronment. You may have more issues to consider as you develop your DR plan.
Business data on workstations
When I encounter a situation in which an employee’s workstation is, in fact,
on the critical path for a critical business process, the first question I usually
ask is, “Why?”
Warnings go off in my head when I hear about an employee’s workstation in
any process’s critical path. Here are my main concerns:
 High integrity storage: IT can’t (and shouldn’t) guarantee the integrity
of storage on end-user workstations. Hard drives fail — it’s a fact of life.
You should store business information on systems with commercial-grade
storage — maybe RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks), mirroring,
or another option.
 Backups: Regularly back up business information, especially when that
information is associated with critical business processes. Typically, IT
backs up IT servers but rarely backs up end-user workstations.
 Management: IT servers are generally better managed than end-user
workstations. IT servers are more likely to have correct configuration
109
Chapter 5: Planning User Recovery

and protection, patches, and so on. IT has absolute control over its
servers, both in terms of physical access and everything about configu-
ration and use.
 Environment: End-user workstations are subjected to abuse: Users drop
them, subject them to extreme temperatures, and spill coffee on them.
IT servers, on the other hand, are housed in facilities with controlled
temperature and humidity, and they don’t get knocked around nearly as
much as a user’s laptop.
 Power: Cleaner power protects IT servers. An Uninterruptible Power
Supply (UPS), line conditioners, or generators can assure the servers’
power is never interrupted.
 Physical access: Businesses usually put IT servers in locked rooms with
controlled and limited access. End-user laptops, on the other hand, are
out in the open and frequently stolen.
 Availability: All of the factors in this list make data on IT systems far
more available to all users when they need it, when compared to data on
an employee’s laptop, wherever it might be at a given moment.
Keeping critical business information on end-user workstations involves a lot
more risk than centrally storing and managing that same information on IT
servers. Still, you may have situations in which end users must process data
locally, with very sound business reasons for doing so. Here are a few examples
of such practices:
 Field-based operations: Field workers in many industries (including, but
certainly not limited to, workers in insurance claims, building inspection,
law enforcement, and disaster relief) must collect information in the
field by using computer-based data entry. Even in situations in which
workstations are equipped to connect to the Internet, those workstations
often can’t get a strong enough signal, so the user has to work offline.
 Work in-transit: Many workers travel extensively, and they often have to
work on contracts, presentations, strategies, and so on while they travel.
A laptop computer on a trans-oceanic flight is a boon to productivity.
 Document management: Workers in most any business department are
responsible for creating policy documents, legal contracts, procedures,
and so on. If workers want to make changes to these kinds of files, they
should check out those documents from a server to their workstations,
make the appropriate changes, update the server. Editing documents —
especially large ones — over the network can be difficult because of the
slow response time you experience over a network versus accessing the
document stored on the local hard drive.

Businesses can have many legitimate activities that require workstations with
their own standalone software tools and business information storage. You
may or may not be the one to make judgment calls about the legitimacy of
this or that use of standalone workstations.
Using workstations as standalone computers, including using local tools and
locally stored business data, is more complicated in many ways than other
workstations uses. The issues related to managing business information
stored on user workstations include
 Availability: Whether users can access the data when they need it, not
only from the workstation it resides on, but from other workstations.
Because of availability issues, don’t store critical business information
on a lone workstation — instead, locate it on a centralized server so that
users can access it from anywhere.
 Capacity: Workstations are fickle beasts, and their users are unpredictable.
If a user fills up his or her workstation with other information, whether
business-related or not, how can he or she perform important tasks with
what little resources remain?
 Confidentiality: You need to protect business information from unautho-
rized disclosure. Control and log who accesses business data on the
workstation by using mechanisms such as file or whole-disk encryption,
access controls (user IDs and passwords, and possibly also a biometric,
smart-card, or other two-factor authentication), and access logging (in
which the computer tracks who accesses the data).
 Integrity: Put controls in place to ensure that business information on
the laptop isn’t changed by anything other than officially permitted
means. Permit only specific users and programs to access and make
changes to the data.
You can manage most of these issues more easily on IT servers, but if a work-
station is really on the critical path for business processes, you need to
address these issues to protect the integrity of the process.
Procedures for using workstations
When business processes include tasks that employees carry out on worksta-
tions, you need to establish written procedures for those tasks and for other
steps in the process that take place on other workstations and servers. Give
all tasks in a business process equal formality, regardless of whether they
take place on a formal IT server platform or a user’s workstation.
111
Chapter 5: Planning User Recovery

Recovery notes for workstations as local computers
Using workstations as local computing platforms has some operational risks.
Nonetheless, it’s advantageous and necessary in many circumstances.
Follow these preparation and recovery steps to successfully recover work
station-based functionality in the event of a disaster:
 Use formal change and configuration management capabilities while
managing software tool installations and configurations on critical work-
stations.
 Ensure that formal process, procedure, and task documentation for busi-
ness processes includes all of the steps that are performed on workstations.
Such documentation should cover not only procedural steps, but also
the workstation and software tool versions and configurations required
to support the tasks.
 Take steps to ensure that business information on workstations is easy
to recover.
You may need to regularly back up data, or you may need to know how
to recover lost data by repeating steps used to obtain information from
its external source(s). In fact, you may need to do both, depending on
the details surrounding the workstation procedures.
112

Gap in PC procedure causes corporate crisis
Some years back, while I was working as a con-
sultant, a colleague in another organization
came to me for help. In this international orga-
nization and U.S. public company, the finance
department couldn’t close its quarterly financial
books in time to meet an S.E.C. (U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission) filing deadline.
The finance department had missed the dead-
line by several days, and the matter had
become a corporate crisis that reached the CEO
and the boardroom.
The cause? An overseas subsidiary couldn’t
close its books. The reason? One of the steps
that the overseas subsidiary took to complete
its month and quarter-end financials was a pro-
cedure in which a financial report was down-
loaded to a PC’s spreadsheet program, where a
spreadsheet macro performed some calculations
that the subsidiary used in its financial results.
This time, the subsidiary ran into a problem: The
macro had become corrupted and wouldn’t run.
The contractor who created the macro was
nowhere to be found. No one in the finance
department knew what the macro did or how it
worked. That macro was an undocumented
step in this critical business process; the origi-
nal software was gone, and nothing about it
was documented.
Avoid this kind of a scenario in your organization
by formally documenting and controlling all
software that you use to process business
information.

 Make sure that you have sufficient controls in place on end-user work-
stations to prevent unauthorized access to business information on the
workstation and the tools used to create and/or manage that information.
Consider both preventive controls and detective controls, depending on
implementation details and associated risks. Talk with your internal or
external auditors if you’re unsure of the role of controls and risks in your
organization.
 Be sure that workstation operators understand the procedures associ-
ated with processing workstation-based information, as well as general
security procedures and precautions.
 Use imaging procedures or tools that can manage the entire workstation
footprint, as well as quickly build or rebuild workstations.
Imaging and workstation build procedures need to cover all aspects of
operating system and tool installations and configurations.
 Make sure that workstation imaging and provisioning procedures
include software licensing and activation steps.
Also, be sure that you can recover business information onto newly built
workstations in disaster scenarios.
 Consider recovering critical workstation functions in a Citrix-like envi-
ronment, in which you can house tools and data on IT-managed servers.
Also, consider the workstation operating system recovery issues discussed
in the following section.
Workstation operating systems
Operating systems power workstations. Whether Windows, Linux, Mac OS, or
something else, operating systems are at the heart of end-user workstations,
no matter whether they’re used as intelligent Web terminals, distributed
computing clients, local computing platforms, or all of the above. Rather than
repeat all the OS-centric issues in each of the sections in this chapter, I discuss
them in this section.
This list includes the major facets of workstation operating systems that
require attention for recovery purposes:
 Hardware platform
 Operating system version, configuration, and patch levels
 Network connectivity
113
Chapter 5: Planning User Recovery

 Authentication
 Authentication resets during a disaster
 Security
In the following sections, I discuss all the elements in the preceding list.
Hardware platforms for workstations
In the context of disaster recovery planning, knowing and tracking hardware
platforms for end-user workstations is a critical activity. You need worksta-
tions in some capacity during and after disasters so you can recover and
operate critical processes.
Each hardware platform has its own workstation image — the files, directo-
ries, and configurations that are installed on that workstation. Often, when a
workstation manufacturer updates the hardware, even within a specific
model line, the changes require that you update the image to accommodate
differences in the hardware. IT departments can end up managing dozens of
images at any one time, not to mention the archive of images they need to
retain for all of the older workstations still in use.
Recovery of end-user workstations can take on a life of its own in a disaster
scenario. In a situation in which business offices have suffered significant
destruction, recovery teams may need to build entirely new workstations
from the ground up so that essential personnel can get back to the business
of recovering and operating critical business processes. But what if you can’t
get your hands on the standard make and model of workstation hardware?
114
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 
Recovering mobile platforms
Mobile computing platforms, such as PDAs and
smart phones, are becoming more common-
place, and they may increasingly become criti-
cal platforms. In fact, during a disaster, they
might be the only way to get some things done.
The principles of planning for the recovery of
mobile platforms are the same as for end-user
workstations — but the technologies and the
dependencies are a little different.
In your DR planning, you might need to develop
recovery or alternative plans for mobile devices,
or mobile devices might be viable alternatives
to thicker platforms, such as laptops.
The security mechanisms for protecting infor-
mation on mobile devices is less mature than
what you find on laptops. You may need to con-
duct a risk analysis to understand the risks
associated with storing corporate information
on mobile platforms.

Time-critical processes demand that you build workstations, often the back-
bone of computing, on whatever hardware platform you can get — very
likely, you have to work with a different brand entirely. You may find your
inventory of ready-to-run images useless because those images probably
won’t work on the replacement workstations.
When you build workstations on unfamiliar hardware platforms — which is
what you may have to do to build replacement workstations in a disaster —
you need to use some creative thinking to figure out how to provide workstation
capabilities for end users. And you need to document workstation images very
well so you can build them from the ground up on new hardware platforms.
Operating system version, configuration, and patches for workstations
Managing operating systems (OSs) on a small number of servers is a lot of
work. But managing OSs on larger numbers of end-user workstations pre-
sents many special challenges that you must meet if you want the organiza-
tion’s DR strategy to succeed. End-user workstations are in the equation of
nearly every business process and business application — they’re the win-
dows (no pun intended) into applications and data. Without them, busi-
nesses are blind, deaf, and dumb.
Managing operating systems has its own set of issues, including these concerns:
 Supported versions: Knowing what OS versions are in common use, and
which user workstations they’re on at any one time, may be a key com-
ponent to your DR plan. The ability to recover end-user functions may
depend on which versions of operating systems you’re using so you can
get critical users up and running in a disaster scenario as soon as possible.
 Operating system patches and updates: Know what OS patches and
updates are supported and working on user workstations. Depending on
your environment, you may need to know which updates and patches
are supported, or you might need to go the extra step and actually figure
out which specific patches and updates are present on each critical
user’s workstation. Your application and tools requirements dictate how
much detail you need to know.
 Operating system configuration: Modern OSs have more knobs and dials
than the Space Shuttle, but you can use only a finite number of known,
supported combinations on those OSs. You need to know the configura-
tions for many scenarios, supporting every type of connectivity, every
tool and application, and every type of user.
 End-user capabilities: Knowing what each end user can do on a workstation
is an important element in DR planning. If your end users are local
administrators on your workstations, you’ll have a more difficult time
managing workstation configurations because end users can make many
changes on their own.
115
Chapter 5: Planning User Recovery

 Supporting business applications and functions: Know the required OS
version, patch level, and configurations for each tool and application
that runs on the workstation. You can either document those configurations
now or figure them out in a disaster scenario when you’re frantically
trying to get a workstation functioning correctly while the executives are
tapping their fingers nervously.
The devil’s in the details, and the OS is probably the biggest bucket of details
you have to consider and accommodate.
Network connectivity for workstation operating systems
You need to understand the methods of network connectivity in use in your
organization, regardless of a workstation’s function. Web browsers and appli-
cations must be able to communicate with systems inside the business and
possibly in the external world.
I discuss several connectivity scenarios in this section, and I may address
issues related to your specific environment. Understanding these cases can
help you better understand your own environment:
 Network access control: Do your target applications limit access to-
specific IP addresses or IP ranges? If so, you may need to reconfigure
them so your recovered workstations can still connect, even if they’re
connected to new, temporary networks.
 Remote Access/VPN (Virtual Private Network): Are your applications and
servers accessible via any existing remote access or VPN service? If not,
you may have extremely limited recovery options because you may need
to temporarily locate recovered users away from your server environment.
 Access to multiple servers: Do your applications require concurrent
access to multiple application servers? I discuss this concept in the
“Managing mashups” section, earlier in this chapter.
The connectivity issues in this section all relate to your applications. Your
business probably uses workstations as devices to access business applica-
tions, and some of those applications are at the heart of many business
processes. If you can’t get to the applications (or file servers or whatever
resources are critical to the support of business processes), do your work-
stations have any value?
Authentication for workstation operating systems
Users have to provide credentials to log on to enterprise resources — or do
they? Authentication occurs in several different ways, from the very simple
to complex and esoteric. You should explore some of these authentication
elements:
116
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

 User ID and password: Easy enough, in most cases.
 Biometric: Usually requires extra hardware, such as fingerprint scanners.
If employees log in to applications that require biometric authentication,
how will that work in a disaster scenario?
 Smart card: Similar to the biometric problem, smart-card authentication
requires hardware that most workstations don’t have.
 One-time password: Often, one-time passwords take the form of tokens
and similar devices. Although users may still have their tokens in a
disaster scenario, the token-authentication infrastructure may not 
still be operating.
 Single identity and single sign-on: Some Web-based applications
depend on centralized services to manage authentication. I cover this
authentication process fully in Chapter 8.
Your temporary workstations (those workstations that you must build during
and right after a disaster) need to be able to log in to your applications and
resources. If you implement any two-factor authentication, your replacement
or rebuilt workstations may need to support your authentication methods,
such as smart cards, biometrics, or whatever you use.
Authentication resets during a disaster
Users need an authentication reset if they forget their passwords, fat-finger
their logins and lock themselves out, or lose their smart cards and security
tokens. With this in mind, you might consider the following methods for
managing resets:
 Passwords via e-mail: Often, applications can e-mail the existing pass-
word, a new temporary password, or a new permanent password to a
user who has lost his or her password. For this password assistance to
work, the user has to have access to e-mail.
 Passwords via live support: In many cases, users can call a manned
support desk to get their passwords reset. Of course, you need to have a
manned helpdesk available in a disaster situation for this approach 
to work.
For additional information on authentication, check out Chapter 8.
Workstation operating system security
Security is the thread that’s woven into most IT fabrics these days. I mention
security in several places in this chapter, but these security issues deserve
their own list:
 Security configuration: Security configurations in every layer of the
workstation stack — from BIOS passwords (hardware passwords required
to boot the computer) to application authentication, and many places in
117
Chapter 5: Planning User Recovery

between — enable recovery if you properly configure them or stop
recovery dead in its tracks if you don’t.
 Encryption keys: You can use encryption in many places, including 
file encryption, e-mail message encryption, session (communications)
encryption, encryption of data such as credit cards and passwords, 
and encryption of entire workstation hard drives. When you work to
recover processing capabilities, you often need to recover the original
encryption keys to facilitate the continuation of processes. Often, you
can’t simply create new encryption keys because the new keys don’t
allow access to data that you encrypted with the old, pre-disaster keys.
 Digital certificates: You use certificates (which are closely akin to
encryption keys) for encryption, digital signatures, and authentication.
And like encryption keys, you often can’t simply create new certificates
to access data stored under old certificates.
Security is often an enabler when you design it from the beginning into an
application environment. This is evident in effectively designed authentica-
tion and data protection mechanisms, as I discuss in this section. But when
you omit key components of security from your DR plans, security can be the
thing that prevents recovery.
Recovery notes for workstation operating systems
You need to plan for workstation operating system (OS) recovery, regardless
of whether your business uses those workstations as Web terminals, clients
in distributed environments, or standalone computing platforms. Follow these
preparation and recovery steps to recover workstation operating systems:
1. Install an OS.
This broad category covers licensing, installation media, activation, and
imaging for workstations. If you have an older version of an OS, be sure
that you’ll still be able to activate it well into the future. A disaster isn’t
the time to discover that the OS vendor can no longer activate an OS
platform that you need to recover a critical business function!
2. Configure your OS.
Whether you have centralized workstation OS management or you con-
figure OS components manually, you need to identify and document all
the salient points of workstation configuration so you can configure
workstations to support critical business functions.
3. Patch and update your OS.
Know what versions of OS patches and updates workstations need to
support applications, network access, and other functions.
4. Set up authentication and access control.
Make sure you can support both local and network-based authentication
so users can access the resources they need to continue critical functions.
118
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

You may also need to include any configuration or hardware necessary
to support two-factor authentication.
5. Set up networking and remote access.
Recovered workstations must be able to access resources across net-
works, including new, temporary networks that you may need to set up
in a disaster. You may need to change server- or network-side configura-
tions to permit new methods of access.
6. Set up security.
You may need encryption keys, digital certificates, and other security
settings to facilitate access or proper processing.
The items in the preceding steps are broad, high-level preparation needs. You
may also need to identify and attend to a lot of details to make sure you have
the greatest level of preparedness when disaster strikes. Also, you may need
to follow additional steps for your specific organization and business needs.
Managing and Recovering End-User
Communications
Although end-user computing is definitely an important aspect of employee
support of business processes, communications are arguably even more
important. Even in peacetime (meaning when you don’t anticipate a disaster),
communications are a vital ingredient in everyday business. Employees
routinely rely on one or more of the following elements in support of business
processes:
 Voice communications or voice mail
 E-mail
 Fax
 Instant messaging
I discuss these elements in the following sections.
Voice communications
Organizations equip their workers with voice communications in a wide vari-
ety of ways, including but not limited to
119
Chapter 5: Planning User Recovery

 Simple direct-dial telephone service
 Telephone company-based PBXs (Private Branch eXchanges, formerly
known as Centrex — a fancy word for a telephone system), in which the
local telephone company manages direct-dial extensions for a business.
 Analog or digital PBXs connected to analog or digital office extensions
 IP-based PBXs connected to digital or IP-based phones, or connected to IP-
based softphones via wired or wireless networks
Your organization may have more advanced voice communications capabilities,
including
 Voice communications integrated into contact-center management systems
 Inbound 1-800 service, possibly with inbound load balancing and capacity
management services that route incoming calls to one or more contact
centers
 Managed or predictive outbound dialing systems integrated with 
contact-center management systems
 Integration with wireless carriers, either through extension trunking 
(a way of connecting branch offices to main offices, for instance) or 
on-premise wireless base stations
 Voice mail connected to e-mail gateways
The preceding lists should drive home the point that your voice telecommu-
nications capabilities, in and of themselves, may warrant extensive DR projects!
These projects can get especially complicated because you may have extensive
types and levels of integration between enterprise applications, telecommuni-
cations, and the telephone companies themselves. The complexity of these
systems requires detailed planning that’s beyond the scope of this book.
I could devote an entire book to DR for voice communications alone. Here are
preparation and recovery tips to ensure rapid recovery of voice
communications:
 Use formal management of voice capabilities, which includes change
management, procedure documentation, and configuration management.
 Back up all configuration information in PBX and other supporting
equipment so you can recover those systems.
 Identify all integration points between PBX, other supporting equipment,
and other internal networks, systems, and applications.
Formally document all such interfaces and integration points, both in
terms of configuration and operations procedures.
 Identify all integration points between PBX, other supporting equipment,
and external service providers, including telecommunications service
providers and other entities.
120
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Formally document all these interfaces and integration points.
 Identify integration points between voice communications and other
forms of communications, including but not limited to voice mail, e-mail,
and wireless.
 Identify business continuity planning efforts that support customer contact
centers and other business functions that rely heavily on inbound and
outbound voice communications.
Make sure that you have ample coordination between business continuity
and disaster recovery planning efforts because the two are symbiotic in
nature.
 Consider alternative carriers, service providers, and other contingencies
for emergency voice communications in the event of a disaster.
Remember that much of an organization’s voice communications capa-
bilities depend on external suppliers and service providers, whose dis-
aster response may or may not translate into rapid and timely
restoration of the services that your organization needs.
 Develop emergency contact lists for emergency operations personnel,
other responders, and parties who will be involved in disaster operations.
Include several means for contacting these individuals. A regional disaster
may result in the widespread failure of several forms of communications.
Because of the wide variety of complexity and integration with other systems,
your own needs may vary from the preceding list.
E-mail
Once considered a nice-to-have mode of communication, e-mail is now con-
sidered critical in most organizations. People use e-mail not only to communi-
cate routine messages, but also as a file transfer mechanism and a formal
alerting mechanism. Increasingly, applications send and receive e-mail as part
of their normal function. Take away e-mail, and nearly everything stops dead.
Aspects of e-mail that typical DR projects need to address include
 E-mail clients
 E-mail servers
 E-mail gateways to the outside world
 E-mail gateways and interfaces to internal applications
 E-mail security
You can look at these areas in more detail in the following sections.
121
Chapter 5: Planning User Recovery

E-mail clients
In most architectures, users who send and receive e-mail do so by using
client software that’s installed on their workstations. This software provides
the user interface with which users read, create, and send e-mail, and often
also locally store e-mail messages. Some issues to consider about e-mail
clients include
 Configuration: E-mail clients often have several configuration items that
deal with a user’s identity, the location of mail servers in the organization,
where local messages are stored on the workstation, and so on.
 Local e-mail storage: Many e-mail clients locally store e-mail messages,
enabling the user to read and compose e-mail messages while offline.
 Address lists: E-mail clients often allow the user to create local lists of
recipients, groups, and aliases within his or her own address list. In some
environments, these local lists may also be stored on the e-mail server.
 Filters and forwarding rules: Many e-mail clients include the ability to
store, delete, or forward messages based on criteria.
You’d be surprised at the number of organizations that depend on these user-
centric features on the critical path of important business processes.
E-mail servers
E-mail servers receive, store, and forward e-mail to and from other e-mail
servers and users. Larger organizations have several e-mail servers, with a
portion of the workforce assigned to each server. One of these e-mail servers
may also send and receive mail from external entities and the Internet, or
separate servers may be dedicated for this purpose.
You need to address several issues when considering e-mail and servers:
 E-mail storage: E-mail servers store e-mail messages in users’ mailboxes,
and often they permanently store all sent and received e-mail messages
for all users in the organization (except in cases in which a user can
archive or remove his or her messages).
 Recipient directories: E-mail users need to be able to locate other e-mail
recipients in online address books. These recipients consist of other
users in the organization, plus other entries, such as group addresses
and external recipients that e-mail administrators put into the directory.
 Groups, distribution lists, and aliases: E-mail servers often contain
other e-mail recipients, including groups, distribution lists, and aliases.
 Filtering and forwarding rules: E-mail servers often use rules for
forwarding, filing, and deleting incoming messages.
122
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

The preceding list gives you just the highlights; your servers may have more
features and functions that you need to identify, dissect, and incorporate into
your DR plans.
E-mail gateways and Internet connectivity
In addition to transmitting e-mail among users within an organization, users
can also send e-mail to recipients outside the organization. And e-mail from
outside sources arrives for delivery to local recipients. In some environ-
ments, the main mail servers perform all these duties, but in others, separate
systems handle these functions. You have plenty of issues to consider regarding
your e-mail servers:
 Configuration: The gateways and other systems that process e-mail
have configurations that permit them to do their work properly. These
configurations include information about neighboring mail servers and
ways to get e-mail messages to the outside world.
 Local storage: Often, these gateways store messages, usually but not
always temporarily, while those messages wait to be transmitted to their
final destinations.
E-mail gateway configurations are usually custom-built for an organization,
and sometimes, no one fully documents the details of these configurations. If
your organization doesn’t have this configuration documentation anywhere,
someone needs to create it now.
E-mail interfaces
Organizations increasingly use e-mail to send messages and data to and from
applications, not just people. Many systems and server applications can rou-
tinely send e-mail messages for a vast array of reasons, including
 Status: Some applications and tools send information about their status
to the people who maintain them.
 Reports: Some applications send the results of reports and queries via
e-mail to people who request or run them.
 Errors: Applications can send e-mail messages to specific personnel
when errors occur.
You can probably find a half dozen other examples of applications, tools, and
systems that originate e-mail messages intended for recipients (or other
applications, tools, and systems); the preceding list gives you just a few
examples.
E-mail security
It’s becoming common practice for IT departments to configure e-mail sys-
tems to apply protection of various kinds to e-mail messages. This protection
123
Chapter 5: Planning User Recovery

takes on various forms, and both servers and end users use it. The primary
means for protecting e-mail messages are
 Encryption: To scramble the contents of messages so that eavesdroppers
can’t read them while those messages are in transit, users and systems
apply encryption algorithms to the contents of e-mail messages.
 Digital signatures: E-mail systems can use digital signatures, often
known as hashing, to protect e-mail. Digital signatures don’t hide the
contents of e-mail messages like encryption does, but they do tell the
recipient whether the contents of the message were altered anywhere
along the way between the originator and the recipient. Digital signa-
tures also provide a way to verify the identity of a message’s originator.
 Anti-spam: E-mail systems often employ spam filters that block and
remove (or quarantine) incoming e-mail messages that the filters think
might be spam. Spam filters can block spam in four ways:
• Server-based: Spam-blocking programs can run on the same
system as the e-mail server.
• Appliance: A separate hardware appliance can block incoming
spam so the spam doesn’t enter the e-mail server.
• Client: Spam blocking software can run on the client workstations,
blocking spam messages after they arrive in a user’s inbox.
• Service provider: All e-mail coming into an organization is sent to
a spam-blocking provider’s server, which filters the spam and
sends the good e-mail to the organization’s mail server.
 Anti-virus: E-mail servers often have anti-virus software that removes
viruses and other malware from incoming e-mail messages before
they’re delivered to end users.
You can read more about blocking spam in Blocking Spam and Spyware For
Dummies (Wiley), which I wrote with Mike Simon. Also, get the scoop on
viruses in Computer Viruses For Dummies (Wiley), by yours truly.
Recovery notes for e-mail
E-mail is the message plumbing in organizations, with wider scope and appli-
cation than you probably know about. As you scrounge around in your e-mail
environment and begin building your prevention and recovery plans, keep
these tips in mind:
 Know how e-mail flows into, around, and out of the organization —
including servers, clients, gateways, and so on.
 Document all the facts about your organization’s Internet domain regis-
trations, which include MX Records that determine where incoming
e-mail from the Internet should be delivered. Making the changes your
business’s domain servers need to be prepared when a disaster strikes
can take considerable time.
124
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

 Trace all uses of e-mail through business processes to determine the
e-mail addresses, distribution lists, filtering rules, and other features
that those e-mail messages require to make it to their destinations.
 Ensure that any replacement spam- and virus-blocking mechanisms that
you introduce in temporary recovery scenarios don’t inadvertently
block critical messages.
 Make sure that e-mail servers have ample storage capacity during disas-
ter scenarios. In disasters, e-mail may accumulate more than usual,
resulting in far greater storage needs than on a typical sunny day.
 Consider an e-mail service provider that uses an external service to
receive and store all incoming e-mail during a disaster scenario. With
this kind of provider, users log in to read e-mail over the Web. Make sure
the provider can handle special-purpose messages, such as those that
are sent from (or to) applications.
 Consider pre-registering critical users (and non-human recipients) with
an alternate e-mail server, just in case.
 Archive all encryption keys and tools that your business uses to encrypt
e-mail so you can still encrypt and decrypt e-mail messages in a disaster
scenario.
 Back up e-mail folders and systems so you can recover them if you need
to. In a disaster scenario, you may need the ability to recover existing
messages, not just send and receive new ones.
As you survey and analyze your end-user e-mail environment and identify all
the critical-process touch points, you’ll probably uncover additional issues
critical to your recovery.
Fax machines
Many organizations still rely heavily on facsimile (or fax) to transmit business
documents, such as contracts, receipts, invoices, and so on. Although many
organizations are making the transition to digital imaging, fax machines are
nonetheless critical for many key business processes.
Here are some factors to consider for faxing in a business environment:
 Directories: People who need to send faxes need to know those destina-
tion phone numbers. Capture your business’s fax numbers in process
documentation, if those numbers aren’t already included.
 Incoming fax numbers: Some organizations use widely advertised or
publicized fax numbers. In a disaster scenario, the organization may
need to have incoming faxes routed to another fax machine or fax server.
You can coordinate this rerouting with a local telecommunications
service provider.
125
Chapter 5: Planning User Recovery

 Fax server configuration: Fax servers are systems that are connected to
phone lines or T-1 circuits, and fax servers can accept larger volumes of
incoming faxes than fax machines in an office environment can.
Fax server have rules for storing faxes, forwarding them to other faxes,
and forwarding them to e-mail recipients in the form of attached image
files. You need to know these rules for business processes that rely on
faxes for critical tasks so incoming and outgoing faxes can continue to
work properly in a disaster scenario.
An organization that relies on faxes for critical business processes needs to
consider these tips for disaster preparation and recovery:
 Record and document critical incoming and outgoing fax numbers in
business processes.
 Route critical incoming fax numbers to other locations in the event of a
disaster that damages a facility or cripples communications.
 Consider online fax for inbound or outbound fax needs. Several commercial
services, such as eFax (www.efax.com), offer fax-to-e-mail and e-mail-to-
fax services that are performed in remote, hardened data centers.
 Record and back up fax server configuration and processing rules so you
can recover critical faxes that use fax servers by whatever means you need.
 Consider using the scan-and-e-mail approach for processes that currently
use fax so you can reduce your business’s reliance on fax machines and
phone lines.
You need to collect all the fax facts in your organization in order to expedite
recovery.
Instant messaging
Instant messaging, or IM, is frequently considered an ad hoc, counterculture,
or underground communications tool in many organizations. Still, many
organizations use IM, and although it might not be on the critical path for
business processes, it’s still handy for casual communications, such as
 Hey, the conference call has started. Are you joining us or what?
 Where are you?
 My e-mail program just died. What’s the number for today’s online meeting?
These kinds of communications might be handy in a disaster scenario, when
too few people are doing too many things in an unfamiliar environment.
126
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Although IM might not be on your critical path, being able to use it during a
disaster may help hold teams together. Consider these tips for recovering
instant messaging:
 Publish emergency response team members’ IM addresses on emergency
contact lists.
 Don’t rely on a single IM provider, in case that provider is involved in the
same disaster you are.
 If your organization uses a centrally managed IM server, consider setting
up an external service as a backup.
 If your organization uses only outside IM services, consider internalizing
it and making it available in disaster scenarios.
Most IM providers don’t encrypt the messaging traffic between parties. A
notable exception is Skype. Skype not only encrypts traffic, but its encryption
scheme has stood up to expert scrutiny.

Planning Facilities Protection 
and Recovery
In This Chapter
 Keeping your processing facilities safe
 Choosing an alternate processing site
T
his chapter focuses on the recovery of facilities — information processing
facilities, mostly, but also work locations for critical personnel. You can’t
plan just where the computers will go: You must also plan where people will
work. Although this is an IT-centric book, you can’t take people completely
out of the equation. Even if others in the organization are doing the business-
and process-centric business continuity and disaster recovery planning that
includes alternate work locations for all categories of personnel, I still give ’em
an honorable mention here — this book primarily talks about recovering IT
systems, but we all know that people need to have a place to work, too.
Protecting facilities can help an organization reduce or eliminate the effects of
a disaster, improving the chances that an organization will survive a disaster —
the overarching objective of DR planning.
This chapter discusses various strategies for alternate processing sites —
places where you can get computers up and running after a disaster strikes
so critical business processes that rely on information systems can resume
functioning.
Protecting Processing Facilities
Information processing facilities are high concentrations of computers and
equipment that support critical business processes. Within a single room,
equipment supporting virtually all of an organization’s critical processes is
usually stacked on special equipment racks placed side by side, with masses
of power cables and network cables connecting this equipment to power sup-
plies and networks. A room of very modest size, say 20 feet by 20 feet, can be

as critical as 50,000 square feet of office space housing 250 workers who use
the information systems contained in that small room.
Not only is the equipment expensive, but the business value derived from the
use of the equipment is potentially very high. In many businesses, most opera-
tions cease to function if the supporting information systems become unavail-
able for any reason. Many of the reasons that operations stop have a lot to do
with the environmental features (power, cooling, and so on) present in the 
facility in which these information systems are housed.
The types of mechanisms for protecting IT equipment include
 Physical access control
 Electric power
 Fire detection and suppression
 Chemical hazards
 Water/flooding detection
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
The following sections discuss the features in the preceding list and how
those features protect information processing equipment.
Controlling physical access
The high value of information systems — and both the asset value of those
systems and their support of revenue-producing business processes — makes
today’s information processing facilities akin to Fort Knox. Data centers are
often an organization’s highest concentration of wealth-producing or wealth-
enabling assets. Consequently, access to these places needs to be tightly 
controlled, so only authorized personnel with a valid business reason for
being there are permitted to enter and leave.
Physical access controls prevent man-made disasters brought about by 
sabotage and other malicious or accidental damage.
Data centers often employ several physical access controls that work together
to both detect and prevent unwanted entry by unauthorized personnel. The
most common controls are
 Video surveillance
 Key-card entry controls
 Man traps
 Biometric entry controls
130
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

 Security guards
 Hardened facilities
 Locking cabinets
 Equipment cages
In the following sections, I describe these controls in more detail.
Even in a disaster situation, you must protect information from unacceptable
disclosure and corruption by using the same controls that you use on 
production systems.
Video surveillance
Surrounding a building, inside and out, with security guards, watching every
entrance and room, is prohibitively expensive. The common remedy for watch-
ing everything everywhere is an extensive video surveillance system that can
record the movements of people in a facility. Such a system consists of several
components:
 Fixed-focus cameras: These cameras are permanently pointed in one
direction and can’t be easily moved.
 Pan/tilt/zoom cameras: Personnel viewing this type of camera in real 
time can remotely control the camera by panning and tilting (changing the
direction in which the camera points) and zooming (making an object’s
apparent distance from the camera closer or further away). Figure 6-1
shows several pan/tilt/zoom cameras housed within protective domes 
on the exterior of a building.
 Viewing monitors: Many organizations have staff dedicated to real-time
viewing of surveillance camera views. Processing equipment can place
one or more images onto a single monitor, and businesses frequently use
many monitors so that staff can see many views of the interior and exte-
rior of a building at the same time. Figure 6-2 shows a surveillance center
that includes several viewing monitors, as well as equipment used to con-
trol pan/tilt/zoom surveillance cameras. You can also see in the figure that
several of the monitors show images from four cameras at the same time.
 Recording equipment: Video surveillance systems can record onto
video tape, optical disc, or computer hard drives. Three common
recording methods are in use:
• Motion activated: The system records a still photo or a short
video sequence when the scene in front of the camera changes,
such as when a person walks by.
• Regular still photos: A still image recorded every one to ten 
seconds.
• Continuous video: Images from each video camera are recorded
continuously.
131
Chapter 6: Planning Facilities Protection and Recovery

You should keep records for at least several weeks, and perhaps as long
as a year or more.
Video surveillance is considered a detective control. Although this kind of
surveillance has some deterrent potential, video cameras primarily detect
activities by recording them.

Key-card entry controls
Information processing facilities — and many regular working locations —
contain key-card entry systems that control who can enter work facilities.
Key-card systems can also restrict entry to elevators, specific rooms, or 
individual building floors.
Key-card controls use a variety of technologies, sometimes in combination, 
to control access. The common types of key-card controls are
 Magnetic stripe reader: A key card contains a magnetic stripe, or
magstripe, that’s similar to the technology used on credit cards. An
employee swipes the key card through the magnetic stripe reader, which
momentarily unlocks a door or opens a turnstile, permitting entry.
 Contact-less proximity card reader: A key card contains an RFID (Radio
Frequency Identification) or similar technology that permits the card’s
owner to hold it close to the reader, thereby unlocking the door or turn-
stile. Figure 6-3 shows a person using a contact-less proximity card reader.
 Smart card reader: A key card contains a smart card memory chip, and 
a smart card reader reads that card’s contents when the user inserts the
card into that reader. A smart card differs from magstripe and proximity
cards because it uses small metal contacts to complete an electrical 
circuit between the reader and the electronics contained within the card.
Newer smart card technology is contact-less and works in the same way
that contact-less proximity card readers (described in the preceding
bullet) do.

Chapter 6: Planning Facilities Protection and Recovery

 PIN pad: In order to provide additional security for sensitive locations,
businesses sometimes use both card readers and PIN pads. In this situa-
tion, the employee has to both use his or her key card and enter a PIN
(Personal Identification Number, generally a numeric code) to gain entry.
A combination of a proximity card reader and PIN pad is shown in 
Figure 6-4.
PIN-pad door locks
Doors can utilize a standalone PIN pad entry. Larger businesses often use PIN
pad entry on rooms with sensitive records or information processing equip-
ment, and smaller organizations that don’t need a centralized system can use
these locks for main building access. A typical standalone PIN-pad door lock
device is shown in Figure 6-5.
Biometric entry controls
Organizations that want security stronger than key cards and PIN pads turn to
biometric entry controls. Biometric controls measure a specific characteristic
of a person’s body to determine whether the person is authorized to enter.
(See Figure 6-6.)

Chapter 6: Planning Facilities Protection and Recovery

The most common types of biometric controls include
 Fingerprint: An optical reader reads a fingerprint and compares it to the
registered fingerprints on file. Figure 6-6 shows a typical fingerprint reader.
 Hand scan: An optical reader reads the geometry of a person’s entire
hand. A typical hand scan device that also includes a PIN pad is shown
in Figure 6-7.
 Retina scan: A subject’s retina is scanned by a special reader.
 Face scan: A camera scans a person’s face and compares it to the 
registered image.
Other types of biometric identity verification systems include keystroke, 
signature, and voice.

Man traps
Man traps are human entry mechanisms that utilize two doors, and only one
door may be open at a time. Man traps can be manually operated (by a guard)
or automatically operated, usually in conjunction with other access controls,
such as key-card readers or PIN pads.
Figure 6-7:
A biometric
hand reader
and PIN-
pad device.
136
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Here’s a typical sequence for passing through a man trap:
1. Person identifies him- or herself to a guard or electronic control.
2. First door opens. Person walks into the trap.
3. First door closes with the person inside the trap.
4. Second door opens. Person exits the trap.
5. Second door closes.
6. The man trap is now available for another person to enter or exit.
A typical man trap diagram is shown in Figure 6-8.
The primary rules that enforce passage through a man trap are
 An electronic or manual control governs when each door can be opened.
 Only one door can be open at a time.
 People can travel in only one direction at a time.
Because man traps can be expensive to purchase and operate, they’re usually
used to protect only highest-value areas, such as data centers and cash
vaults.
Security guards
Security guards are personnel who are trained and designated to perform 
several functions, including
 Checking identification of visitors
 Examining the personal effects of persons entering or leaving a facility
 Monitoring building entrances and exits

Chapter 6: Planning Facilities Protection and Recovery

 Inspecting visiting vehicles prior to their entry
 Apprehending persons of suspicious nature
 Registering building visitors
 Operating video surveillance systems
 Escorting visitors
 Registering information about equipment that personnel are taking out
of the building
 Receiving incoming shipments
Security guards fill a needed gap that varies from organization to organization,
depending on security requirements and perceptions. The primary strength of
security guards is that they possess the powers of judgment and intuition,
unmatched in electronic-based control systems.
Hardened facilities
This catch-all category includes facilities that house information-processing
equipment, particularly for highest-value organizations (large financial institu-
tions, for instance) that have a lot to lose if their systems are damaged.
Some examples of features in a hardened facility include
 No exterior windows: Nothing to throw heavy objects through and no
way to see from the street what’s going on inside.
 Bulletproof glass: If the facility does have a few windows, bullets won’t
pierce them.
 Fences: Eight-foot–high chain link — or even solid walls — with three or
more strands of barbed wire or razor wire on top. Walls make effective
pre-detonation screens (armored shields that can stop a projectile explo-
sive from detonating on the building itself) if you’re concerned that
someone may use heavy weapons against your facility.
 Equipment bracing: Equipment cabinets and racks, and the systems in
them, need to be securely fastened and braced, not only for personnel
safety, but also to mitigate seismic (earthquake) risks. You don’t want to
put a bunch of servers and other equipment up on racks only to have
those racks fall down or the equipment fall off the racks, damaging the
equipment and seriously injuring personnel.
 Electromagnetic shields: If you’re really concerned about the continuous
onslaught of electromagnetic radiation in the kilohertz, megahertz, and
gigahertz bands, consider putting in shielding that blocks all of that
incoming noise. These shields are sometimes called TEMPEST (Transient
Electromagnetic Pulse Emanation Standard) or Faraday cages. Cellphones
and pagers can’t receive signals in such environments.
138
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

 Window coating: In particular, the sort that prevents laser listening
devices from working.
 Bollards and crash gates: You don’t want angry or determined people 
to drive their vehicles into your building. Figure 6-9 shows an effective
retractable vehicle crash barrier in action. Bollards are those heavy, short
vertical posts that are used along roadways and in front of buildings to
prevent vehicles from driving into certain areas.

Locking storage cabinets
Information processing facilities have a lot of valuable items that you should
lock away out of sight. Some items that need to be locked away include
 System documentation
 Release media (CD-ROM and other media that contain purchased 
software)
 Backup media
 Spare parts
The quality of the locking storage cabinets should depend on the value of the
contents they’re protecting.
Equipment cabinets and cages
Usually found in multi-tenant commercial colocation data centers and compa-
nies with factions that don’t trust each other, equipment cabinets and cages
allow equipment to be cordoned off to prevent physical access by persons 
who otherwise do have a legitimate reason to be in the data center. Figure 6-10
shows locking equipment cabinets in a modern processing center.

139
Chapter 6: Planning Facilities Protection and Recovery

Cages and cabinets can range in size from a single 30-inch cabinet to caged
areas that cover hundreds of square feet. You typically lock them with metal
keys or an electronic access control system, such as a PIN pad or key-card
reader.
Getting charged up about electric power
Electricity is the critical ingredient for information systems and supporting
equipment. Servers and network equipment get cranky when any of the
common and not-so-common electrical anomalies occur, including sags,
surges, spikes, transients, brownouts, noise, and outright failures.
Dirty electricity, and also frequent brownouts and blackouts, not only cause
unscheduled downtime, but can also have a significant effect on the life
expectancy of equipment. IT equipment requires clean — really clean — power.
You need some of this equipment in your facility to protect your IT equipment
from power problems:
 Remote power controllers: These smart, network-attached plug strips let
you switch power off and on to each plug. They’re invaluable for remotely
controlled equipment in lights-out data centers (centers that are unstaffed
Figure 6-10:

you protect
equipment
in multi-
tenant and
colocation
data
centers.
140
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

most of the time). Beats having to get dressed just to power cycle a
server.
 Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS): Absolutely non-negotiable, in my
opinion. You might not need a large one, but you need one. They not
only store several minutes of electricity in batteries, they also (usually)
filter out all the dirty power that makes your systems sick.
 Line conditioners: A possible adjunct to UPS, line conditioners smooth
out the bumps and dips in incoming power.
 Power Distribution Unit (PDU): A PDU is a device that distributes elec-
tric power to individual circuits and plugs. Some PDUs also step down
voltage from 240 to 120 volts, and some have remote control capability.
 Electric generator: If your organization can’t tolerate occasional utility
outages, put an electric generator on your shopping list. Generators
work in conjunction with a UPS: In the event of a utility power failure,
the UPS immediately begins providing power from its batteries for the
seconds or minutes the generator requires to start and get up to speed.
Larger installations may require more than one generator, for both
capacity and redundancy reasons.
 Diverse power feeds: For really critical facilities, consider having the
public utility bring in two separate power feeds that enter the building
from opposite ends and that feed from different substations.
 Switching equipment: Large installations with multiple power feeds,
generators, and UPSs need switching equipment that can ensure the
continuous flow of electricity to your systems in any situation.
In addition to the equipment in the preceding list, another highly critical
aspect to power management is planning. Planning is especially important for
larger installations that are utilizing newer blade technology, which con-
sumes more power per square foot than older technologies.
Detecting and suppressing fire
Early fire detection is critical in information processing centers. If you can
identify a fire in its earliest stages, you can deal with it before serious damage
occurs.
When fire does erupt, you need to extinguish it as quickly as possible, with
minimum damage inflicted on otherwise-uninvolved equipment. Using water
to extinguish a fire in a data center isn’t such a great idea, unless you want to
replace all of your water-soaked equipment because some technician let his
soldering iron get too hot and smoky.
141
Chapter 6: Planning Facilities Protection and Recovery

Smoke and fire detection
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. The old saying isn’t far from the truth.
Effective fire detection starts with smoke detection. When fire is in its early
stages, it may emit smoke in very small amounts.
The options for smoke and fire detection are
 Photoelectric: Smoke scatters light in the air. Photoelectric smoke
detectors work by detecting this scattering.
 Ionization: In a small ionization chamber, smoke alters the process of
ionization and triggers the alarm.
 Air sampling: A network of air sampling pipes throughout the facility
draws air into a centralized, highly sensitive sampling chamber. By
design, this setup can detect fire earlier than other types of detectors
because it can get a higher quality air sampling by using only one really
good sampling device rather than many less expensive units.
 Temperature: When the fire becomes more active, it heats the air
around it. Temperature or rate-of-rise sensors detect the change in 
temperature.
 Manual stations: People in the facility can run to the nearest fire alarm
panel and manually turn on the alarm if they know that a fire has started.
Similarly, an observant surveillance operator can detect smoke or fire
through the video surveillance.
Many locations have laws that require a computing facility to include two or
more of these detection systems.
Fire alarms and evacuation
Because human life and safety are the primary concerns in any disaster situa-
tion, fire alarms need to be properly designed and maintained so that person-
nel know when a fire breaks out and how to quickly evacuate the premises. You
also need well-placed exit signs, of course, to help people find their way out of
a building when the alarms go off.
Fire alarms in commercial buildings are commonly connected to local fire
departments. This connection automatically notifies firefighters, speeding
their arrival and hopefully reducing damage.
Fire suppression
When a fire has started in an information processing facility, you need to
extinguish the fire as soon as possible, before it damages costly equipment.
You can use several means of controlling and extinguishing fire, including
142
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

 Fire extinguishers: These portable devices are usually located through-
out office buildings and data centers. Fire extinguishers come in several
types for fighting different kinds of fires. Here are the kinds available in
the United States:
• Class A: Ordinary combustibles, such as wood and paper
• Class B: Flammable liquids
• Class C: Energized (powered on and active) electrical equipment
• Class D: Combustible metals
• Class K: Cooking oils
Some fire extinguishers fall into a combination of the different types —
for instance, an extinguisher can be classified both Class A and Class B.
 Sprinkler systems: These systems send a steady spray of water onto large
areas, cooling the fire until it can no longer sustain itself. Water causes
severe damage to information processing equipment, so you don’t want
sprinklers fighting fires in data centers. However, building codes often
require sprinkler systems as a backup to other types of suppression.
You can find several types of sprinkler systems:
• Wet pipe: When sufficient heat reaches near a sprinkler head, a
fusible link melts, releasing water through the sprinkler head.
• Dry pipe: The pipes are dry until smoke or heat activates the
system, at which time water flows through the pipes and out of the
sprinkler heads. Water flows only from heads whose fusible links
have melted.
• Deluge: Used in locations where rapidly spreading fire is a con-
cern. All sprinklers are open (they have no fusible links that must
melt), and upon activation, all sprinkler heads discharge water
simultaneously.
• Pre-action: A hybrid of dry pipe and deluge. Typically, the system
requires a preceding event, such as smoke detection, which charges
the pipes with water, converting the system to a wet-pipe system.
When further smoke alarms, heat alarms, or heat at the sprinkler
heads occur, water flows.
• Foam and water: As you might guess, sprinklers discharge a 
mixture of low-expansion foam and water.
Figure 6-11 shows a close-up of a sprinkler head. This illustration clearly
shows the transparent fusible link capsule. This capsule melts in heat
caused by a fire, which activates the flow of water.
143
Chapter 6: Planning Facilities Protection and Recovery

 Gaseous fire suppression: Most often found in data centers, these 
systems flood the area with an inert gas, thereby depriving the fire of
oxygen. The system works by discharging the gas when someone pulls 
a fire alarm in the facility or when one or more smoke or heat detectors
are activated. The gas is stored in large tanks inside or immediately out-
side the protected area. Gases often used include FM-200, Argonite, and
Inergen. Organizations once commonly used Halon 1301, but it’s been
discontinued since the signing of the Montreal Protocol in 1989, which
outlawed the use of ozone-depleting substances.
The choices you have for fire detection and suppression really depend on
your locality’s fire codes.
Chemical hazards
Many organizations work with hazardous chemicals and materials as a part 
of their business. In the United States, the Occupational Health and Safety
Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have
strict guidelines concerning the acquisition, storage, and use of a vast number
of hazardous substances, as well as specific contingency plans for treating
spills and accidental releases of these substances.
Figure 6-11:
The link
capsule in a
sprinkler
head.
144
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

In many cases, these spills and releases may trigger disasters. Mandatory
evacuations alone are enough to trigger a business disaster: If everyone has
to leave a facility, how can the business continue operations?
Often, businesses are subject to not only U.S. federal laws, but also state and
local laws governing the same substances. I’m not going to attempt to untangle
this sticky web of regulation and substance-related contingency plans. If your
business deals in hazardous substances (as defined by OSHA and the EPA, or
other agencies that have jurisdiction where your business is located), you 
need to gain expertise in handling those substances, in addition to the more
generalized disaster recovery planning that this book covers.
Keeping your cool
Information processing equipment operates very happily within a fairly
narrow band of temperature and humidity. These environment restrictions
becomes a challenge when the equipment consumes a lot of electricity and
throws off so much heat! Getting rid of the heat at the same rate that it’s pro-
duced is no small task. And with the amount of heat that newer equipment
discharges per square foot of space, cooling equipment must deliver much
more punch than in the past.
The life expectancy of information processing equipment drops sharply
(sometimes by more than 90 percent) with just a single high temperature
spike. When systems catch a high fever, they’re not long for this world.
Because temperature control is so vital, an information processing center
must have redundancy in its HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning)
systems, so the failure (or planned maintenance) of one HVAC system doesn’t
put the data center at risk. Also, the control systems that manage the HVAC
systems must be robust themselves, so they don’t ever fail to direct the HVAC
systems to do the right thing.
Because HVAC is so vital, you need to protect it by having backup power (UPS
and generators) along with computing equipment. If HVAC stops operating for
more than a few minutes, you need to shut down computing equipment right
away to prevent overheating and damage.
Staying dry: Water/flooding 
detection and prevention
Information systems and water don’t mix very well at all. For this reason,
water-based fire suppression systems (as a first line of defense) have fallen out
of favor because water discharge can severely damage computing equipment.
145
Chapter 6: Planning Facilities Protection and Recovery

You can do a few things to make sure that water doesn’t become a problem.
You may not have to worry about some of these measures, depending on
your local conditions:
 Local flooding risk: Find a hydrologist who can provide a realistic assess-
ment of flooding potential for your facility. Take the results to an architect
who may recommend mitigating features for your site that can ensure any
flood waters are directed away from your facility.
 Building survey: Look for risks within your facility that may pose a water
hazard. Check that roof drains and other features are operating properly.
Here’s my personal flood-in-the-building story: Years ago, a hot water
heater on the fifth floor of a building exploded, sending water cascading
downstairs into the second floor data center, taking a national public data
network off the air for a few hours. Water was dripping out of servers.
Needless to say, it pays to carefully understand the risks posed by even
innocuous features in a building.
 Emergency procedures: If your building is prone to any sort of water
accumulation, you may need to have emergency procedures and supplies
on hand, such as sand bags, pumps, or other means for keeping water out
or removing water if it gets in.
Regularly test pumps or other complex apparatuses for readiness.
 Water detectors: Install electronic water detectors in the lowest places
in your information processing center and connect them to whatever
alarm management or network management system seems appropriate
for proper alert-and-action capabilities. With this water-detector setup in
place, if water somehow gets into your information processing center,
you can find out about it while you may still have time to deal with it
and avert a disaster.
 Equipment location within a building: For facilities in or near areas
prone to flooding, you should locate equipment in the building above
potential flood levels.
 Water-resistant storage: Get water-resistant safes and media vaults so
flooding, fire suppression, and other discharges of water don’t damage
valuable documents and storage media.
 Humidity control: Have equipment for removing excess humidity on
hand or readily available in the event a discharge of water occurs.
Often, preventing a disaster is far easier than dealing with one when it occurs.
Selecting Alternate Processing Sites
Despite every reasonable means available to prevent a disaster or minimize a
disaster’s impact, some events are so intense that you have no choice but to
146
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

temporarily or permanently abandon a data processing facility and resume
operations elsewhere. Extreme natural and man-made disasters do occur, and
in your locale, you know which types are more likely to trigger a real disaster
for your organization.
So the main question is: If you have a disaster, where you gonna go? The 
following sections are devoted to helping you answer that question for your
organization.
You have several alternatives for relocating your systems if your data center
ends up a smoking crater:
 Cold sites: Processing facilities with no computers installed
 Warm sites: Processing facilities with computers that require installation
and configuration
 Hot sites: Processing facilities with computers that are ready to perform
business processing
 Other business locations: Other facilities that the organization owns
 Mobile sites: Processing facilities in trailers
 Contracted facilities: Processing facilities owned by other organizations
 Reciprocal facilities: Mutual-aid arrangements
The following sections give you detailed explanations of the alternatives in
the preceding list.
Hot, cold, and warm sites
You have a few ways to consider alternate processing sites. You can consider
who owns an alternate site and the business relationship between your orga-
nization and the alternate site’s owner. You can also consider the alternate
site’s readiness to take on the burden of production information processing — 
I discuss this readiness consideration in this section.
In terms of readiness, alternate processing centers are categorized in three
levels: hot, cold, and warm. I describe these levels in the following sections.
The terms hot site, warm site, and cold site aren’t absolute. You use them in
the same way you identify a small car, medium-sized car, and large car. You
don’t have an absolute boundary between the terms: They’re simply general,
relative categories.
Hot sites
A hot site is a location that’s ready to assume production application process-
ing with little or no preparation. Systems, networks, and applications are all
147
Chapter 6: Planning Facilities Protection and Recovery

in place and up-to-date, and perhaps live data is already on the site or can be
loaded up fairly quickly. Generally speaking, a hot site can assume processing
with only a few minutes’ or hours’ notice.
Hot sites are the most expensive because keeping a hot site ready to assume
production duties requires continuous effort. But, for businesses with highly
time-sensitive applications, the expense of a hot site may be well worth 
the cost.
Cold sites
Cold sites are generally just empty processing centers with little or no network-
ing equipment, and few (if any) systems. Communications facilities may or may
not be in place. Think of a cold site as an empty room, with physical and 
environmental controls in place, but no information processing equipment.
The time required to get a cold site up to full battle readiness is at least several
days and possibly a week or longer.
Warm sites
Warm sites are, well, in the middle between ready-to-go hot sites and the empty
shells of cold sites. Warm sites may have servers and network equipment in
place, but no software or data loaded. A warm site might need from one to five
days to get up and running.
Table 6-1 compares hot, warm, and cold sites.

You perform the Business Impact Analysis (BIA) and determine the Maximum

Point Objectives (RPO) early in the disaster recovery project. The results and
content of these formal documents and processes determine the investment
required regarding the resumption of processing capability with hot, warm,
148

or cold sites. The cost of downtime and the long-term costs incurred by a
long outage determine the level of recovery capability. You’re probably not
going to invest more in your recovery capability than you derive from the
process you’re trying to protect. In other words, this is ultimately a cost-
benefit matter, taking the probability of a disaster into consideration.
Other business locations
Some businesses already have more than one processing site or have the
ability to implement a second processing site in one of its premises. The
capability to build your own alternative processing site may cost less than
going with outside service bureaus or colocation facilities.
Some points to consider when thinking about other business locations as
alternate processing sites include
 Siting risks: Is the site free from risks associated with airports, railroads,
hazardous materials, flooding, storms, landslides, and other factors?
 Environment support: Does the site have sufficient HVAC and power
capacity, or can you add it?
 Physical security: Does the other business location have sufficient 
physical security controls, such as fencing, video surveillance, key card
systems, and so on?
 Proximity to primary processing site: Is the site far enough away 
from the existing information processing facility to not be considered 
in the same risk zone? Such a minimum distance might range from 100 
to 500 miles, depending on the nature of the risks, such as earthquakes,
volcanoes, hurricanes, tsunamis, and so on. Consult with local experts
regarding the threats associated with nearby natural threats.
 Transportation: Is the alternate site sufficiently close to major transporta-
tion systems, such as airports, railroads, seaports, or freeways, to make
those systems accessible in an emergency?
 Supporting services: Are supporting services near enough to the alter-
nate site? Examples of supporting services that you may need to take
into consideration include shipping, police and fire, lodging and restau-
rants, public utilities, building construction and repair, and network 
connectivity.
 Laws and codes: Are the building codes and laws concerning security
and other matters for the alternate processing center suitable for your
needs?
You may identify other factors that you think are important for your particular
business activity and other needs.

Data center in a box: Mobile sites
Organizations such as APC, Sun Microsystems, and SunGard have developed
emergency mobile data centers that they can deliver to a business location.
These companies offer the following features:
 APC InfraStruXure Express: 2,500-square-foot mobile data center on a
semi-truck trailer platform that includes power, cooling, 12 equipment
racks, and satellite communications.
http://www.apc.com/products/infrastruxure/index.cfm
 Sun Microsystems Project Blackbox: Self-contained data center in a ship-
ping container that can be sent anywhere in the world by truck, ship, rail,
or air. Equipped with integrated power and cooling, and a configurable
selection of servers and network equipment.
www.sun.com/emrkt/blackbox
 SunGard: Mobile data center on a semi-truck trailer platform that
includes a generator, voice and data communications access, terminals
and printers, equipment racks, work areas, kitchen, restrooms, lighting,
and physical security. SunGard has several of these units available for
dispatch within 48 hours.
Go to www.availability.sungard.com and search for Mobile Data
Center.
An emergency mobile data center may be appropriate for your business if
you need a temporary data center up and running quickly in a location that
has no other facilities available.
Colocation facilities
Commercial data centers, also known as colocation facilities or just colos, are
big business in nearly every metropolitan area in the world. The big players,
such as AT&T, have dozens of facilities throughout the world; many regional
and local companies have carrier-grade data centers, as well.
Colocation facilities are multi-tenant data centers in which an organization
such as yours leases as much space as it needs — from as little as a portion of
a single rack to hundreds of square feet. The colo provides several features:
 Physical security: Security guards, key card entrances, video surveillance,
fences, and perhaps other measures, such as hardened buildings, guard
dogs, crash barriers, and so on.
 Network/Internet connectivity: Provides connectivity to the Internet —
just hook up your router, firewall, switches, and so on.
150
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

 Power, including emergency power: Some facilities have redundant
power feeds, generators, UPSs, and so on.
 HVAC: Redundant air-conditioning and humidity controls to get rid of 
all the heat that your servers throw off.
 System monitoring and management: Systems monitoring, management,
backups, and so on, manned 24/7 by colo staff members so you don’t
have to.
The cost advantage of a colocation facility is potentially significant. In partic-
ular, they’re expensive to build and maintain, and your organization needs to
pay only its share in the form of monthly fees. Colocation facilities do have a
downside: They’re expensive, although less so than building one of your own.
Reciprocal facilities
Before colocation facilities came into being, one of the few options available
for alternate processing sites was the reciprocal facility. A reciprocal facility is
a legal arrangement between two parties, in which each pledges to make a
portion of its facility available to the other party in the event that the other
party experiences a disaster that forces it to abandon its own data center.
In plain and simple English, the agreement is, “I let you use a portion of my
data center if you experience a disaster, and you let me use a portion of your
data center if I experience a disaster.”
In the era of mainframe computers, the reciprocal agreement applied not 
only to the physical space, but to the use of the organization’s mainframe com-
puter(s). So a reciprocal agreement was also a timesharing or service-bureau
type agreement because an organization would permit another organization to
run its programs on its mainframe.
The two organizations needed to have the same kind of mainframe computers
so that application programs on one would also run on the other. The organi-
zations needed to conduct an initial test to check the viability of a long-term
reciprocal agreement and perhaps regular testing to make sure that the 
systems were still compatible.
In today’s environment, a reciprocal agreement may or may not include the
use of the other organization’s systems — it may cover just the floor space
and power for your systems in the other organization’s data center. Still, a
reciprocal agreement can cost much less than the alternative, colocation
facilities.

A
lthough disaster recovery planning is all about recovering critical business
functions, data, and the associated applications, application recovery
can’t exist or operate without support from the systems they reside on and the
networks that enable communication to everything else in your application
ecosystem.
DR planning, in large part, is about prevention — not preventing disastrous
events, but preventing the crippling aftermath of a disaster. In the context of
systems and networks, this prevention involves building consistent, resilient
servers and networks that are flexible and can accommodate the processing
needs for the applications they support.
In this chapter, you can figure out what you need to build and maintain the
server and network infrastructure that your DR needs require. Every business
is different in so many ways; so, rather than just give you the answers (which
would make this book far too long), I give you everything you need to think
about so that you can establish the best possible recovery plan for your critical
applications and processes.

Managing and Recovering
Server Computing
If data and applications are the soul of an IT-supported business process,
systems are the body in which the soul resides. The system, like the body,
needs to be a suitable vessel that allows the application to run correctly 
and provides access to that application’s data.
Systems’ resilience is the key to recoverability in the face of disaster. When I
say systems’ resilience, I indeed mean to use the plural because the entire
community of systems that support an application before, during, and after a
disaster need this resilience. You may need to make sure the organization has
a collection of systems, in different locations, that are ready to assume opera-
tional duties when a disaster occurs.
I’m not saying that you must have a second set of servers ready to go in
another location. Many organizations can’t afford that kind of redundancy.
Rather, your organization should have systems ready only when you need
them, in the event that a disaster damages your primary servers or makes
them unavailable for use. This need-specific setup could mean
 Hot servers already sharing the current workload
 Hot standby servers ready to take over at short notice
 Warm standby servers ready to take over with some preparation
 Cold standby servers ready for installation of applications and data
 Order servers when the disaster strikes, and then install your application
and data on them when they arrive
Which option an organization chooses depends on the time sensitivity and
business value of the applications that servers support, as well as whether
the organization can invest in a given recovery capability. Whichever option
you choose, you have to identify and manage numerous technical issues. And,
generally speaking, the faster you want to recover your processing ability, the
more complicated and costly your solution needs to be. I discuss these
issues in the following sections.
Determining system readiness
A top-down DR plan defines the most critical business processes, and it
therefore identifies the applications and databases associated with those
processes as critical. These critical applications and databases, in turn, pin-
point critical servers and supporting infrastructure. When you determine
Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs — that is, how quickly replacement servers
154
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

must be up and running), you can figure out how much time you have to get
new servers ready to run those critical applications. The RTOs drive the
arguments for hot sites versus warm or cold sites. (I discuss determining
RTO and other key values fully in Chapter 5, and I talk about the distinction
between and issues about hot, cold, and warm sites in Chapter 6.)
RTOs and hot/warm/cold sites are all about timing: An RTO determines how
quickly you need to recover your systems in a disaster. If you measure your
RTOs in minutes, you have hot servers in a remote location that are probably
already doing production work in the form of load balancing. If you measure
your RTOs in hours or days, you still have a hot site, but one with a failover
capability, instead. If you measure your RTOs in days or weeks, your plan
probably calls for a warm or cold site. It’s just about the speed of recovery.
Speed doesn’t drive the argument, but consider speed to readiness as I dive
into the issues that really matter for system recovery and readiness.
Server architecture and configuration
In Chapter 4, I discuss the need for inventory information at every level. When
you inventory your systems, software, network devices, and other supporting
assets, you can begin to identify the components that support critical business
functions. After you identify these assets, you need to get the magnifying glass
out and look more closely at critical application servers. At this level of detail,
you have to identify every tiny detail and determine the following information
for every server:
 Hardware configuration: Find out everything about the hardware on a
server, including
• Make, model, serial number
• Firmware (BIOS/CMOS) versions
• Number and type of CPUs
• Amount and type of memory
• Number, type, and hardware configuration of network adaptors
• Number, type, and hardware configuration of storage interfaces
(for example, SCSI adaptors)
• Exactly how the hardware is assembled (order of adaptor cards,
memory sticks, and so on)
• Attached peripheral devices (type, model, version, and so on)
 Operating system: Figure out everything about the operating system
(OS) that’s running on the server, including but not limited to
• Version, release date, and patch level for the OS you’re using
155
Chapter 7: Planning System and Network Recovery

• Patches installed (and the versions of those patches and even the
order of installation, if you can find out)
• Components installed and their versions
• Boot configuration
• Recovery settings
You’re probably thinking, “This is a lot of detail!” But you need to know
these details to ensure that application software functions properly and
predictably.
 Resource configuration: Virtual memory, disk utilization settings,
memory utilization, and how the OS makes resources available to
applications and system processes. In the UNIX world, these are kernel
parameters; in Windows, these are mostly configured in the Registry 
and in some administrative user interface functions. Regardless of the
OS, system administrators usually manage these settings.
 Network and network services configuration: All the usual settings,
including subnet mask, gateway, DNS server, directory server, and time
server, as well as tuning settings, such as number of open connections
and buffer allocation.
 Security configuration: A lot of these settings deal with event logging,
system auditing, system-level access control configuration, patch down-
load and installation, and user account settings.
 System-level components: Additional components installed at the
system level, including
• Firewall
• Intrusion detection and prevention
• Anti-virus and other anti-malware
• System management agents
Be sure to get the versions and configurations for all of these components!
 Access management: The whole gamut of system-level access that includes
• User IDs, user ID and password configuration
• Configurations related to any centralized user management
resources, such as LDAP or Active Directory
• Shared resources, meaning directories and other resources that
users can access via the network
Inventorying all the information in the preceding list for a server could take
you a good long time. Multiply the effort by the number of servers you have. I
envision a very wide and deep spreadsheet in your immediate future.
156
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Those centralized system configuration management platforms are highly
valued, and also very expensive because of their complexity and the high
value they provide. The top tools in the configuration management space
make identifying and managing the entire configuration for each server a far
easier task. If you don’t have any such tools, you have to manage systems the
hard way (in other words, manually).
Why this level of detail is important
Critical applications and data reside and run on your servers. Your servers’
intricate configuration permits your applications to run in the more-or-less
predictable state that administrators and users are familiar with.
To ensure that a recovery server can support the correct and proper functioning
of a critical application, configure the recovery server to match the original
server as closely as possible. If you do otherwise, you introduce potential
instabilities or changes in functionality that you don’t want to introduce ever,
especially during a real-life disaster recovery operation. In such a situation,
you already have enough chaos and disruption to deal with; adding application
instability because of differences in server configuration could be the difference
between your business’s survival and demise.
Understanding the case for consistency
If you haven’t delved into the depths of server configuration detail before, you’re
probably gaining an appreciation for the complexity of modern operating
systems and the people who manage them. If you want consistency across
multiple servers in an environment, I applaud you for your wisdom. Simplicity
and consistency are far easier to manage than complexity and inconsistency.
Well, you can’t get rid of complexity in operating systems (because of the vast
number of configuration settings), but you can make the configuration of
systems more consistent, server to server. Configuration management tools
can help you achieve this consistency.
Configuration management can also give you other significant advantages:
 Reduction in administrative errors: System administrators can more easily
manage identically configured systems, so they make fewer mistakes.
 Reduction in unscheduled downtime: When system administrators are
making fewer mistakes on servers, those servers run more reliably.
Developing the ability to build new servers
You have to be able to make identical copies (well, as near to identical as is
practical) of critical application servers and use those copies to run your
applications when disaster strikes.
157
Chapter 7: Planning System and Network Recovery

So you need to figure out how to build new servers that are like existing ones.
This book isn’t about Windows (or UNIX, or whatever) system administration,
so I won’t go too deep into that subject. It should suffice to say that you need
to make new servers as similar as possible to existing ones so that applica-
tions can run on those new servers with as little fuss as possible. And this
smooth transition makes building recovery systems after a disaster easier.
Building nearly identical servers for recovery purposes is one thing, but
keeping those servers consistent is quite another. Server consistency
requires two separate but related disciplines:
 Change management: The business process concerned with the proper
development, analysis, and approval of changes made in a production
environment, at all layers. The goal of change management is to expose
potential risks and other issues that could jeopardize proposed changes
before they occur. Proper change management gives you higher system
availability and fewer unscheduled outages.
 Configuration management: The process of recording all changes made
to all components (at all layers) in an environment. The central repository
is known as the configuration management database (CMDB), which
stores every detail about the systems under its management.
Typically, change management and configuration management relate to each
other in this way: You use configuration management to document the changes
that the change management process has analyzed and approved.
How you keep your recovery server configurations consistent depends a lot
on your speed to recovery: If your DR plan calls for rapid failover to hot servers,
you need to make the means for updating those hot standby servers as close
to automated as possible. If you install patches or make other changes to the
primary server, make those same changes to the recovery servers as soon as
possible. Letting servers get too far out of sync could invite trouble during a
recovery operation.
If, on the other hand, your recovery servers are stored in a closet someplace,
you need to somehow queue up all of your changes and apply them only now
and then so those servers aren’t too far out of sync in case a disaster strikes.
Your DR plan may specify that you purchase servers when a disaster strikes
and then build them after they arrive. In a situation such as this, you might
invest in a set of tools that you can use to duplicate a server configuration
onto another server.
The bottom line is that you must keep your recovery servers’ configuration
consistent with your primary servers. How you maintain this consistency
depends on how quickly you need to begin using your recovery servers in a
disaster.
158
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Distributed server computing considerations
Many environments use a complex application architecture that includes
components that reside on many servers, and not all of those servers are
necessarily located in the same location. Distributed architectures (as these
types of architectures are called) increase the complexity of an environment
in steady-state and introduce additional issues that you must address in your
DR planning.
This complexity is further exacerbated in cases in which other organizations
own or operate one or more of the components in the application environment.
With Internet-connected enterprises and application integration that’s fueled
by business interoperability and made possible by newer technologies, such
as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), disaster recovery planning assumes
a much higher level of complexity. Organizations need to make additional
plans for recovering these increasingly complex environments if one of those
organizations is hit with a disastrous event.
Architecture issues
You may encounter these issues related to application architecture during
your DR analysis and planning effort:
 Interfaces: If you have custom interfaces between the components of
your distributed environment, it’ll take more effort (on the part of
system developers or integrators) to improve resilience in the overall
environment. Engage your application architecture personnel and urge
them to develop strategic plans that include moving to standard inter-
faces, such as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).
 Latency: In a highly distributed environment, systems that communicate
over great distances and/or over slow wide-area network (WAN) connec-
tions can experience latency (delays in the transmission of data from
system to system). The behavior of the application may change in
unexpected ways in a disaster scenario if the latency between components
increases (or decreases) by a significant amount. Parts of a distributed
environment may not be able to tolerate latency, and other parts that
include significant latency may behave differently if the latency
decreases.
 Network considerations: A distributed application environment that
encompasses WAN connectivity needs to take network design into account.
Distributed applications that were designed for, and implemented in, fast
local-area networks may suffer performance degradation in a wide-area
network. The cumulative effect of several lengthy hops across a WAN
can slow response time and even cause network timeouts.
159
Chapter 7: Planning System and Network Recovery

Operational issues
Keep these common operational issues for distributed applications in mind
when doing your system-level DR planning:
 Failure points: Distributed systems have more failure points (literally, the
number of hardware and software components required to support 
the environment) than centralized systems, and a disaster is more likely
to occur when those failure points are geographically diverse, rather
than in a single/central location.
 Distributed recovery: A disaster that occurs in one location of a distributed
environment may prompt a recovery operation that involves personnel in
many locations.
 Third-party components: If a third-party service provider that hosts a
vital element to your application experiences a disaster, that service
provider’s priority list may differ from yours.
 Priority: In a distributed environment, a disaster that disables one
component may have additional recovery complications. The failure 
of a component at a remote location may be your high priority, but a lower
priority than other components for the remote location’s organization.
For instance, a database server in a remote location is only a medium
priority for the organization in that location, but it’s critical to your
organization. If that database server fails, the organization that runs it
may not be in a particular hurry to fix it, which can lead to longer
downtime or a more difficult or time-consuming recovery for you.
Application architecture considerations
Because the bulk of DR planning is in preparation, an organization should
consider a number of application architecture issues while developing its 
DR plan. You can more easily recover a resilient application that relies on
standard components than you can an environment that relies more heavily
on custom components and non-standard features. Figure 7-1 shows a typical
application architecture.

Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Introduce these issues into the long-term application architecture effort:
 Centralized authentication: Application architects and integrators
should seriously consider a shift towards network-based authentication
services instead of relying on authentication within the application.
Sure, an application may still need to perform an authentication, but
authentication data should be centralized, which improves the integrity
of access controls across the organization in several ways:
• Standard logon credentials: Users have fewer (as few as one) user
IDs and passwords that they need to remember.
• Streamlined authentication management: You need fewer personnel
to manage the issuance and termination of access rights.
• Fewer forgotten passwords: Because workers have fewer passwords
that they need to remember (as few as one), they won’t forget their
passwords as often, so you can spend less time performing password
resets.
Examples of centralized authentication and identity services include
LDAP, Microsoft Active Directory, Oblix, and IBM Tivoli Identity Manager.
 Standardized interfaces: Application architects should put SOA
(Service-Oriented Architecture), Web Services, ETL (Extract, Transform,
Load), and XML (Extensible Markup Language) on their roadmaps as the
means for highly agile integration between applications, both within the
enterprise and with external applications.
The approaches in the preceding list permit application designers and DR
planners to think about the service components that support applications,
separate from the applications themselves. Developing standard and centralized
services permits an organization to streamline its application environment by
plugging application components into a service-oriented framework that
already provides basic services, such as authentication and data management.
Server consolidation: The 
double-edged sword
Server consolidation has been the talk of IT departments for several years
and represents a still-popular cost-cutting move. The concept is simple: Instead
of dedicating applications to individual servers, which can result in underuti-
lized servers, you install multiple applications onto servers to more efficiently
utilize server hardware, thereby reducing costs.
I’m all for saving money, electricity, natural resources, and so on. Consolidating
servers is a smart move to undertake, as long as you remember that server
consolidation is something to undertake during peacetime (normal operations),
not in a disaster scenario.
161
Chapter 7: Planning System and Network Recovery

Consider an environment that’s made up of dozens of underutilized servers
dedicated to applications. The DR planning team wants to consider a DR
strategy that consolidates these applications onto fewer servers to provide a
lower-cost recovery capability.
Well, this consolidation might work, but the DR planning team should test it
very thoroughly and carefully. Combining applications that previously had
servers all to themselves may lead to unexpected interactions that could be
difficult to troubleshoot and untangle.
If you want to undertake server consolidation, do it first in your production
environment, and then take that consolidated architecture and apply it to a
DR architecture. To make server consolidation successful in your DR plan,
first implement server consolidation in your production environment, where
your architects, designers, developers, and operations staff can become
familiar with it. You can far more easily implement something in a DR environ-
ment if you’re already familiar with it.
162
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 
Security laws and regulations 
apply during disasters
Organizations need to protect every type of sen-
sitive data, including
 Financial records and transactions
 Medical records
 Identity information, such as names, dates
of birth, social insurance numbers, and
passport numbers
 Intellectual property, including an organiza-
tion’s secrets
In the onset or aftermath of a disaster, you can’t
suspend security laws and regulations. On the
contrary, disaster recovery plans must take into
account all the security requirements that apply
during peacetime.
Many regulations exist to protect information
about citizens and corporate entities from com-
promise and theft. Organizations that are in the
midst of a disaster recovery operation aren’t
exempt from these regulations, so you need to
consider all applicable security regulations and
requirements when developing an organiza-
tion’s disaster recovery plan. Also consider that
a disaster declaration may result from a mali-
cious act, possibly a deliberate attempt to get
an organization to let its guard down and make
information easier to steal or sabotage.

Managing and Recovering
Network Infrastructure
Networks and network services are the plumbing that permits applications to
communicate with each other and with the people who use them. Although
networks are generally a lot less complicated than the applications they sup-
port, they’re a lot more complicated than the router-firewall-hub architectures
that businesses used in times past. Figure 7-2 shows a typical enterprise network
architecture.
Networks are a lot more than just devices that move network traffic about.
Networks perform often-invisible functions that enable communications
within and among enterprises.
Ninety percent of good DR planning is knowing what makes your environ-
ment run today, especially when you’re dealing with networks and those
invisible services.
To a great extent, the features in a network and the issues with network
recovery are one in the same. After you identify your assets and features, you
can incorporate that information into your DR planning effort.

Chapter 7: Planning System and Network Recovery

Consider your voice network capabilities (meaning your office telephones) as
part of your network, whether you use analog, digital, or IP-based phones in
your environment. Voice communications are as vital as data communications
in most organizations, and perhaps even more so.
Consider these voice network features and issues:
 External network dependencies: An organization’s connection to the
Internet depends on some configuration settings that external service
providers maintain, including
• Data circuits and trunks: Getting any sort of an Internet data cir-
cuit (a network circuit that connects your internal data network to
the Internet) or PBX trunk (a network connection between your
internal phone system and the public telephone network) installed
takes several weeks, even with expedited orders from local tele-
phone companies. Data circuits are also expensive, so organiza-
tions need to use some creative thinking to figure out how to set
up data circuits for DR purposes. Not only are circuits and trunks
expensive, but they take several weeks to install and set up.
• Domain name service (DNS): DNS is the glue that associates domain
names (such as www.company.com or http://mailserver.
company.com) with the IP addresses that systems use. Changing 
an IP address for a well-known service, such as a Web site, can take
hours or days before Internet users can visit the site on the new IP
address.
• Publicly routable network numbers: The network connection
established between an ISP (Internet Service Provider) and a business
includes some fixed (non-changeable) IP addresses that are associ-
ated with that particular network connection. You generally can’t
associate those IP addresses with another physical location.
• Office telephone service: Aside from trunks, you have a lot of
other considerations if you want to build or recover your voice
network in a DR setting. Partner with your voice service provider
to get a better idea of what issues you need to consider in order to
recover your voice network.
DNS, network addresses, and especially data and voice circuits are
long lead time items — functions that you must build well in
advance of a disaster, especially if an alternate processing site
depends on them. Even for a cold site, you need to pre-order these
items and put them in place, unless you don’t mind waiting six
weeks for connectivity at your DR site.
• Network Time Protocol (NTP): You use NTP to provide accurate
clock synchronization for servers and workstations. Usually, business
applications just work when starting up new servers in a new envi-
ronment. Still, include NTP on your system build checklist so you
can make sure that this important function continues working.
164
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

 Firewalls: They stop the bad stuff, such as worms and scanning attacks,
from getting in — that’s the easy part. Firewalls also contain a list of rules,
which permit specific communications between servers inside the
enterprise with servers or networks outside the environment. Often, network
administrators introduce these rules to permit specific applications to
communicate with systems in other organizations. If you need to move an
application to an alternate processing site, you need to know and correctly
apply all the original firewalls’ rules to the firewall(s) at the alternate site.
 Network security devices: In addition to firewalls, organizations frequently
use a variety of other means for protecting systems and networks:
• Intrusion detection and prevention
• Spam filters
• Web proxies and filters
• Load balancers
• Hardware encryption
• VLANs (virtual networks)
• DMZ (demilitarized zone) network segments
 Network equipment: Like servers, some network equipment — espe-
cially bigger routers and other non-commodity items — can take a while
to obtain. You either need to have this equipment on hand in your alter-
nate processing facility or have “first off the line” privileges with your
suppliers.
 Management processes: Specifically, change management and configura-
tion management. I describe these two disciplines in the section
“Developing the ability to build new servers,” earlier in this chapter.
Change and configuration management are vital for network equipment
and configuration, not just for servers.
 Network architecture, routing, and addressing: The internal details 
of a network facilitate communication within the network and with external
networks. Setting up network addressing (the IP addresses that are assigned
to systems and devices) and routing (the means through which systems
on different networks can communicate with each other) involves a lot
of detail that applications depend on.
 Network management: Medium-sized and larger organizations often use
a network management application to monitor and manage all the network
devices (and, often, servers) in the environment. Some organizations’
networks are so tightly coupled to their network management platforms
that the networks can’t run without the management systems.
The completion of the Business Impact Analysis (discussed in Chapter 3),
together with the establishment of Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs), largely
determines the speed at which you need to recover critical business applica-
tions. A rapid speed to recovery can cost quite a lot. The process of establishing
165
Chapter 7: Planning System and Network Recovery

RTOs and then determining their costs can get repetitive: A first pass could
well determine that the cost of recovering an application within an arbitrary
period of time would cost more than the business derives from the business
process that the application supports. DR planning is, for sure, a time of soul
searching and difficult decisions.
Implementing Standard Interfaces
You can often more easily extend and change an applications architecture that’s
based on open standards than one that’s built with custom interfaces. Open
standards are the programming and communications standards that applications
and systems are built on. Here are some examples of open standards:
 TCP/IP: The network protocol of the Internet. Dozens of open standards
fall within TCP/IP, including SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) that
makes e-mail work, DNS (domain name service) that’s used to translate
names into IP addresses, NTP (Network Time Protocol) that synchronizes
system clocks, HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) that Web browsers
use to request data from Web servers, and SNMP (Simple Network
Management Protocol) that’s used to manage network devices and systems.
 World Wide Web: Encompasses protocols and standards that support
the Web.
 GSM: The cellular telephone communication standard used in most of
the world.
To make applications and systems more resilient and recoverable, organizations
may have to add or change components that can facilitate recovery operations.
Here are some examples:
 Upgrading interfaces to SOA: Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA),
sometimes known as Web Services, is a newer method that you use to
integrate applications without having to build custom interfaces over
low-level protocols, such as CORBA (Common Object Request Broker
Architecture), DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model), or .Net.
 Implementing centralized identity management: Centralizing authenti-
cation within the environment permits applications to do what they do
best — provide access to business information. Technologies and products
that provide centralized identity management include LDAP (the open
standard Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), IBM Tivoli Identity
Manager, Microsoft Identity Integration Server, Novell Identity Manager,
Oracle Identity Management, and Sun Java System Identity Manager.
166
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Implementing Server Clustering
Applications that are critical to important business processes often require
higher availability, and you need to be able to quickly recover them in another
location. Organizations that need the ability to recover these applications
within minutes of a failure frequently use server clustering. Clustering is an
expensive proposition, but it’s the method of choice for applications that
require rapid recovery.
A server cluster is a tightly-coupled collection of two or more servers that are
configured to host one or more applications. In his book In Search of Clusters
(Prentice Hall), Gregory Pfister describes a cluster as “a parallel or distributed
system that consists of a collection of interconnected whole computers that
are utilized as a single, unified computing resource.” In other words, a cluster
is a collection of computers that appear as a single computer to end users.
The servers in a cluster coordinate with each other to ensure that at least one
of the servers is running the applications. They coordinate by communicating
with each other through a fast network, using clustering software that manages
a complex set of tasks. Figure 7-3 shows a server cluster architecture.

Chapter 7: Planning System and Network Recovery

Server clusters improve the availability of the applications they serve by
reducing the effects of
 Hardware failure: Failures in components such as CPU, RAM, bus, or boot
drive result in an immediate, unplanned outage for critical applications
running on the system.
 Software failure: A malfunction in software can result in a server lockup
or crash. You may be thinking, “If a software failure occurs on one server
in the cluster, wouldn’t it also occur in other servers in the cluster?” Yes,
possibly. This scenario is certainly worth thinking about while application
and system engineers try to figure out an ideal architecture for a clustered
application.
 Network failure: You couple a properly designed system cluster with a
network architecture that has similar redundancies. If you experience a
failure in the network, other network components and paths should still
be available, making at least some of the servers in the cluster still
reachable from client systems.
 Maintenance: With two or more systems in a cluster, you can much more
easily perform regular maintenance activities on individual servers. You
can take individual servers in a cluster offline, shut them down, and per-
form maintenance on them — all without affecting application availability.
 Performance issues: You can configure a cluster to permit more than one
server in the cluster to serve applications. I discuss cluster configuration
more in the following section, which talks about cluster modes.
Understanding cluster modes
Server clusters generally operate in one of two basic modes, which are based
on how the servers in the cluster are configured to operate day by day:
 Active/active: In this configuration, all the servers in the cluster run
applications. You use this mode for a load-sharing scenario in which 
an application runs on several servers at the same time.
 Active/passive: This configuration consists of servers that are hosting
applications (the active ones) and other servers that are in a standby
mode.
Whether an organization chooses to run its clusters in active/active or
active/passive mode depends on performance, availability, and disaster
recovery needs. You need specially designed applications if you want several
servers hosting those applications at the same time.
168
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Geographically distributed clusters
In the preceding sections of this chapter, I discuss server clusters that you
set up in a data center, in which all of the servers in the cluster are located
within a few feet of each other. When put into operation, the cluster provides
not only much higher availability for the application, but also greater capac-
ity if you configure the cluster as active/active.
This type of clustering does little for disaster recovery purposes, however.
The entire cluster can be incapacitated if any of several events occur:
 Fire, flood, earthquake, tornado, or hurricane: Any of these events can
directly destroy servers or render them incapable of operation.
 Widespread communications or other utility failure: A prolonged or
severe event can result in communications or power utilities being
unavailable for so long that short-term contingencies can’t compensate.
 Sabotage, vandalism, or terrorism: Somebody with determination can
render all of the systems in a processing center inoperative for hours,
days, or longer. Wire cutters, a sledge hammer, a bomb, or a degausser
can quickly destroy several servers’ ability to host critical applications.
Any of these events can easily render all of the servers in a cluster inopera-
tive or unreachable. Right? Not necessarily. You can make your server clus-
ters geographically diverse. In other words, instead of placing servers side by
side in a processing center, you can place them hundreds or thousands of
miles apart in separate processing centers. These clusters are called geo-
clusters or GD (geographically diverse) clusters.
The chief advantage of a geo-cluster is that you always have an application
available, even when a widespread regional disaster completely destroys a
processing center. Servers in the cluster that are located in surviving pro-
cessing centers keep running, with little or no interruption. Figure 7-4 shows
a typical geo-cluster configuration.

Chapter 7: Planning System and Network Recovery

Cluster and storage architecture
The architecture of clustered servers, storage systems, and the applications
themselves are tightly coupled. Applications hosted on a server cluster must
be designed to properly interface with the physical architecture of storage
systems and how cluster failovers work. The integrity of applications is vital
to the health of the application, especially when the servers and cluster
architecture can be changed in real time.
You can use several technologies to protect application data, including resilient
storage, mirroring, and replication. A server cluster needs one or more of
these technologies. In fact, you can develop many such possible cluster-storage
architectures. The following list breaks down cluster and storage architecture
into the simplest terms. Choose a technology from each of the following
groups to put together a complete clustered architecture:
 Cluster architecture: Pick one:
• Active/active
• Active/passive
You also need to figure out how many servers you want in your cluster
and whether you want them located in the same processing center or
hundreds of miles apart.
 Storage architecture: Pick one or more:
• SAN (Storage Area Network): Select whether you want storage
attached via SCSI, Fibre Arbitrated Loop, or a Fibre network.
• NAS (Network Attached Storage): You connect storage systems to
the network and access them with NFS (Network File System) or
SMB (Server Message Block) network protocols.
 Data replication: Pick one or more:
• Mirroring: The database, server OS, or storage system layers can
perform the mirroring, in which changes to data on a storage
system are copied to a remote storage system in real time.
• Replication: The copying of transactions from one system to
another.
 Network architecture: You have many choices available, including
• Load balancers: For arbitrating access among several active servers
• Round robin DNS: For load balancing across an active/active 
geo-cluster
• Dynamic routing changes: For failover at the network level so that
application clients are directed to active servers, wherever those
servers are
170
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

The technologies in the preceding list are just the high-level details. Within
every option, you have to make many more choices. And many intimate
details of the application, in terms of how transactions work, matter when
making choices, large and small. You can find entire books filled with informa-
tion on application, storage, and cluster architecture. I have only enough
room in this book to take you on a quick tour.

t’s all about the data.
That pretty much sums it up. But don’t close the book yet. I have a lot of
details to cover about how to protect that data.
I don’t blame you if you’re confused because I say that it’s all about the data.
Security products have, in the past, been largely network-centric: Firewalls and
intrusion detection systems are network-based tools, leading many IT profes-
sionals (myself included) to believe that their networks needed the protection.
But your network is only your private highway that leads to what really
matters — your data.
This chapter focuses on protecting your organization’s data so you don’t find
yourself in a jam when a disaster strikes — instead, you’re prepared to resume
processing at a later time in your same location or soon in a different location.
Protecting and Recovering
Application Data
If you know that your most valuable IT assets are your databases, protecting
them is just a matter of incorporating some backup or replication scheme to
make them more readily available if a disaster strikes. Right?
Not so fast.
In most organizations, although they store much of the data centrally in data-
bases, they also store some of the data elsewhere. And probably only a few
people are familiar with the details of the data that exists in the backwater
places in your network.

Locating all your data requires some sleuthing. You need a process-centric
view that uncovers all of the ins and outs of your data (where the data comes
from and where it goes) so you don’t miss any details.
Recovering critical business functions means more than just recovering the
databases. It also requires recovering the capabilities for moving the data
into and out of applications that support business functions.
Before we explore the various options for protecting data against loss (and
making it available soon after a disaster), you need to understand some basic
principles about DR-style data protection:
 Speed increases costs. In other words, the faster you want your data
available after a disaster, the more it’ll cost you.
 Distance increases costs. The further away you store the data that you’ll
need to recover quickly, the more it’ll cost you. Primarily, this cost
relates to private, high-speed WAN connections between two or more of
your facilities.
 Size increases costs. The more data that you want to make available
soon after a disaster, the more it’ll cost you. This cost relates to the
amount of storage you must purchase to achieve the storage redundancy
you require.
 Complexity increases costs. A data protection and recovery plan that
contains several different solutions for parts of the organization costs
more than a simple plan. For instance, a plan that has mirroring for part
of the data, replication for another part of the data, electronic vaulting
for yet another part of the data, and tape backup recovery (all discussed
later in this chapter) for the rest of the data costs quite a lot in terms of
all of these platforms that you must build and operate over time. A simpler
one- or two-tier plan is more cost effective than a complex plan with
many more components.
Here’s an example: During its Business Impact Analysis (BIA), an organization
identifies several critical databases that it must protect and recover in the
event of a disaster. While developing the Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs)
for various business applications, the DR project team identifies two classes
of recovery needs: a more rapid need to recover a subset of data and a less
rapid need to recover the remaining data.
The project team debates these possible strategies:
 Two-tier recovery: They can protect and recover the most time-critical
data by using a more expensive data replication mechanism and recover
the rest of the data, which is less time-sensitive, from backup tapes.
Members of the project team who are in favor of this strategy argue that
this approach is less expensive than using costly data replication for all
the organization’s data.
174
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

 One-tier recovery: They can use the pricey data replication to protect
and recover all the organization’s data. Although this approach has
more in upfront costs to protect all the data, the strategy is simpler and
easier to implement than two separate schemes. The team members in
favor of this approach argue that its simplicity outweighs the additional
costs. They’ll probably find this approach easier and more reliable
during a recovery.
The project team needs to do more analysis to determine whether the two-
tier or one-tier recovery strategy is appropriate for the organization. The
team needs to weigh not only the capital costs, but also the costs of operat-
ing the environment day to day and during disaster and recovery scenarios.
Keep the data protection principles in mind when you’re developing your
data protection and recovery plans. You need to weigh the costs and benefits
of developing either a single data recovery solution for your entire enterprise
or a multi-tier data recovery solution.
Choosing How and Where 
to Store Data for Recovery
The process of DR planning begins with the Business Impact Analysis (BIA),
which includes a risk assessment and the determination of Recovery Time
Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs). These steps help
you identify which business processes are the most important in an organiza-
tion and how quickly you need to recover them. Chapter 3 discusses BIA
development in detail.
Before you can develop a viable data recovery plan, you need to identify all the
data associated with each critical business process listed in the BIA. Analysis
often shows that you find some of the data where you expect to find it — in
application databases and other centrally managed locations. However, you
probably also find much data in other places, including end-user laptops, work-
stations, and inside the heads of several individuals. This data-location effort is
discussed in Chapter 4.
The Business Impact Analysis and data sleuthing efforts, when completed,
provide two important facts:
 Which data is important
 Where the important data is located now
Knowing these facts, you can now construct a strategy for protecting the data
and making the data recoverable in the event of a disaster.
175
Chapter 8: Planning Data Recovery

Because, in a disaster, the facility or the equipment that houses the data is
often destroyed, the business needs to recover the data (either in the same
or a different location) on alternative equipment so business operations can
resume.
The next important step in developing your DR plan (after completing the
BIA) is to determine where and how to store the data so that you can recover
it in the time required to support your RTOs and RPOs.
This chapter deals with the where and how of this data storage. The following
sections discuss several solutions for protecting data:
 Backups
 Resilient storage
 Replication and mirroring
 Electronic vaulting
Protecting data through backups
Tape backup has, for over five decades, been a runaway favorite for protect-
ing data against loss in the event of a disaster. People who need to back up
data have favored tape for its long-term storage stability and low unit cost.
The storage capacity of magnetic tape, or magtape, has steadily increased
over time, enabling tape backup to keep up with similar advances in hard-
disk capacity. Figure 8-1 shows the flow of data to and from backup media
when you back up and later restore that data.
Recently, backing up data onto removable hard drives, such as those that
easily plug in to RAID arrays (highly resilient disk storage systems), has become
popular. From a business function standpoint, backup media, such as tapes
and disks, are more or less the same: They’re media that you use to store and
retain copies of electronic data. Backup is defined more by the function —
making backup copies of information — than by the type of media used.

Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Backup fulfills several purposes:
 Long-term archiving: Regulations often require the long-term storage of
certain business records. Organizations back up such data to tape and
store those tapes for long periods of time so they can meet those retention
needs.
 Data recovery: Human error often occurs — a program bug can inadver-
tently corrupt data or someone can accidentally deletes files. Equipment
malfunctions, such as hard drive failures, are also common. In these and
similar scenarios, you can recover data from recently-created backup tapes.
 Disaster recovery: If a disastrous event strikes a data center in which your
organization stores important business information, you can easily recover
that data from backup tapes onto replacement or alternate systems.
Organizations that have no disaster recovery plan still often use tape backup
for data recovery purposes, either because they know that it makes good
business sense or they want to avoid repeating an incident in which an
equipment failure or human error resulted in a costly data loss. With some
changes in the way that the organization performs these backups, it can
adapt its tape backup operation to support disaster recovery needs.
You need to consider several important issues if you want to make tape
backup a part of your disaster recovery plan:
 Data retention policy: Before you can put a tape backup plan into place,
the organization must first decide how long it wants to retain electronic
data, including data in databases and in other locations. Factors that drive
a retention policy include statutory requirements, contractual require-
ments, service level agreements, and existing operations procedures.
 Backup media retention: The organization needs to decide how long it
plans to retain backup tapes. This timeframe should fulfill data RPOs in
both directions, meaning
• Most recent data recovery: This requirement supports the RPO —
recovering most recent data in order to avoid re-keying or re-
processing newest data.
• Least recent data recovery: This requirement supports a different
objective — recovering data from a particular point in time for
whatever business purpose requires that data. For example, to see
what a customer record looked like exactly six weeks and three days
ago, you might need to retain daily backups for seven weeks or more.
Developing a tape backup media retention and rotation plan can be
complex. Such a plan needs to accommodate both archival and disaster
recovery functions, and it must anticipate data growth, longevity of backup
media, and other business requirements.
177
Chapter 8: Planning Data Recovery

 Backup media recordkeeping: Because you use backup media for both
archival and recovery purposes, you need to establish a robust and reliable
recordkeeping system for backup media. The recordkeeping system
should support several functions:
• Quickly determine which backup tape contains any given data file.
• Quickly determine which backup tapes you need to completely
recover a given server.
• Quickly determine the physical location of any backup tape.
• Easily determine how many times any given backup tape has been
used.
 Backup media protection: Because they contain valuable business informa-
tion, you need to protect backup tapes from unauthorized access and use.
 Backup media location: To effectively guard against any disaster scenario,
you must locate backup media away from the data center in case that
data center is damaged or destroyed. Backup tapes wouldn’t be much
good if they were damaged or destroyed alongside the equipment that
stored the original data. I discuss where to store your backup media in
more detail in the section “Deciding where to keep your recovery data,”
later in this chapter.
 Backup media privacy: Government regulations, as well as requirements
through pervasive standards, such as PCI (the Payment Card Industry
data security standard intended to protect credit card data), often require
that data in backup media be encrypted, thus preventing exposure of
backup data to any unauthorized parties. You can implement the encryp-
tion of backup media in a variety of ways:
• Main storage encryption: If data that you want to back up is
already encrypted in its native location, the data may be automati-
cally encrypted when you copy it to backup media.
• Backup program encryption: The software that performs the
backup operation may be able to encrypt the data as it passes
from the source system to the tape backup equipment.
• Backup equipment encryption: The equipment that you use to
write data onto backup tapes may have the ability to encrypt the
data before it writes that data to tape.
Table 8-1 shows several pros and cons for tape and disk backup.

You often keep backup tapes that you create for data retention purposes sep-
arate from tapes that you create for data recovery and disaster recovery rea-
sons. You can keep tapes that contain data you want to retain for long
periods of time in a different location to reduce the chance that someone
accidentally overwrites such tapes.
Tape backup has been a popular choice for long-term archiving of electronic
records. However, organizations don’t often use tape backup in conjunction
with disaster recovery planning, primarily because of the time required to
restore data from tape. Backup to removable disk, replication, and mirroring
are becoming the methods of choice.
Protecting data through resilient storage
Hardware failures in storage systems account for enough unscheduled downtime
that these failures warrant attention and DR planning consideration. If you
make the storage systems themselves resilient, you reduce the likelihood
that a storage system failure will cripple a critical business function.
Here are some of the ways in which you can make a storage system more
resilient:
 RAID: Redundant Array of Independent Drives (or Disks), also known as
Redundant Array of Inexpensive Drives (or Disks). You can choose from
many RAID features and configurations. But all RAID-based storage
systems have the ability for the storage system to continue functioning,
even if one of the hard drives fails. RAID systems also permit you to replace
a failed drive without needing to power down the RAID system (called
hot swapping).
179
Chapter 8: Planning Data Recovery

 Redundant power supplies: Many storage systems have multiple power
supplies, which permit the continuous operation of the storage system,
even if one of the power supplies fails. These storage systems also permit
the hot replacement (or hot swap) of power supplies, assuring continuous
availability.
 Redundant server connections: Many storage systems have multiple
controllers and physical connections to servers, assuring continuous
operation, even if one of the connections fails.
 Virtualization: You can use large central storage systems to create virtual
disk volumes that meet whatever storage needs application servers have.
Storage virtualization lets you more efficiently use storage resources by
allowing the organization to carve up the storage system in whatever
ways meet its business needs.
Network Attached Storage (NAS) and Storage Area Network (SAN) technolo-
gies often include all of the features in the preceding list. I discuss NAS and
SAN in Chapter 7.
Resilient storage by itself doesn’t provide a disaster-proof storage capability
because a significant event can cause the failure (or unavailability) of the entire
storage system. However, resilience still supports both high availability and
disaster recovery objectives for lower severity events, such as equipment
failures.
Protecting data through
replication and mirroring
The terms replication and mirroring generally refer to the ability to write
newly introduced data to more than one storage system at the same time.
Replication and mirroring differ somewhat in the details.
The two chief advantages of replication and mirroring over tape (or disk)
backup are
 Data is copied to another storage system that a server can immediately
use, in near-real time.
 You can access data without the need for a magtape-style restore.
You can develop a variety of architectures to support replication and mirroring,
depending on the nature of the business objectives. The two primary architec-
tures involve replication or mirroring to
 A secondary storage system that a server accesses (as shown in Figure 8-2)
 A storage system at a remote location (refer to Figure 8-3)
180
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

The difference between replication and mirroring is as follows:
 Mirroring: A real-time or near real-time copying process, disk block by
disk block. Changes take place on a primary storage system and onto
one or more secondary storage systems. Here are some additional facts
about mirroring:
• Mirroring is usually handled directly by the storage subsystem.
• Servers often don’t know that any mirroring is taking place (at least,
when the storage hardware controls mirroring).
 Replication: A transaction-level process in which changes to databases
that occur on primary storage systems are carried out on secondary
storage systems. Additional facts about replication include
• Replication can occur in near-real time, but it can also be delayed
by several minutes or hours, depending on the configuration of the
replication software, the speed of the communications link between
storage systems, and the RTO and RPO figures.
• Database management systems or storage systems can manage
replication; hence, servers may or may not be aware of the details
of replication.
You need to know these other salient facts about replication and mirroring so
you can make sure your clustered servers operate properly:

Chapter 8: Planning Data Recovery

 Replication and mirroring are a part of a larger application resiliency
architecture that also may include a clustering or failover capability.
 You can’t do replication and mirroring without deep consideration for
other layers in the stack, including application, server, database, and
network. You must closely coordinate replication and mirroring with
server cluster configuration, which in turn requires you to carefully con-
figure the application and network devices.
Mirroring and replication are closely tied to server failover and clustering
technology, so the mirroring/replication and clustering work together
smoothly.
Protecting data through electronic vaulting
A popular option available for backing up data is known as electronic vault-
ing, sometimes known as remote backup or e-vaulting. Electronic vaulting is
the process of sending data electronically to an off-site location through a
network connection.
In the strict sense of the word, electronic vaulting can also mean sending
data to another one of your business locations. I prefer to use the term repli-
cation to mean sending your own data to yourself at a different location.
You can use electronic vaulting for a lot of things, depending on whom you
ask. Some of the possibilities include
 Using backup software on your systems to send backup data to computers
run by a backup service provider.
 Replicating database transactions that you send off-site.
 Copying data to a remotely located standby system that can assume
primary processing duties during a disaster.
Most people probably consider electronic vaulting a faster version of third-
party off-site media storage. Off-site backup media storage provides one or
more copies of data that you can use to recover systems in the event of a dis-
aster. Electronic vaulting achieves this same objective, and it’s generally
much faster because you can have recovery data electronically transmitted
to a recovery facility.
Deciding where to keep your recovery data
Whether your DR plan calls for backup tapes, replication, electronic vaulting,
or remote mirroring, you need to think about where your data is going and
182
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

how you’ll get it back when you need it. In most cases, you need to decide
where to store your recovery data.
Case in point: If you decide to recover your application data by using backup
tapes stored off-site, at what location do you want to store those backup tapes?
Some of the factors that you need to consider when evaluating off-site locations
include
 Proximity to business locations: Keep your recovery data close to your
primary (or alternate) processing site for rapid recovery times. However,
if the site is too close to your primary site, it could also be involved in a
regional disaster, such as an earthquake or hurricane.
 Physical security: Make the measures that protect media from harm and
unauthorized access at least as good as the physical security in your main
processing site — perhaps even far better than your own security.
 Proximity to transportation: If your DR plan calls for backup media to
be flown to another city, be sure that your media storage location is close
enough to major transportation centers (airports, freeways, and so on)
so your media can be quickly sent to a recovery center.
 Security while in transit: You take unnecessary risks if you have your
backup media transported on a scooter or in some hitchhiker’s backpack.
Seriously, though, transport backup media in vehicles with security
measures that ensure your media stays secure while en route to or from
the storage facility. A third-party service may include secure media transit,
or you may need to find a separate secure media transportation service
provider.
You may have additional criteria concerning off-site storage. After you know
some of the characteristics you want for the location storing your backup
media, you can begin evaluating the characteristics of possible locations.
You can find a few types of data storage facilities available:
 Commercial media storage centers: Organizations that store backup
media in highly secured facilities designed for that purpose.
 Alternate business locations: These locations could (and should) coincide
with your alternate processing sites so those processing sites can more
quickly resume support of critical business functions.
 Third-party service providers: Electronic vaulting and managed backup
services have their own facilities for storing customer data. Due diligence
is especially important — check them out for yourself.
183
Chapter 8: Planning Data Recovery

 Reciprocal processing site: If your organization has entered into a recip-
rocal processing site usage agreement with another organization, you
may want to have your recovery data sent to that location. Just make
sure you can get to your data when you need it.
Protecting data in transit
Although the business information that you store on your systems is important,
don’t lose sight of the data that you transmit over network connections to or
from other organizations. Not only does that data itself require protection,
but you probably also need to include the means for transporting it in your
DR plan, especially when transporting data into and out of your organization
is a part of critical business functions.
Your hardware and software inventories, as well as the development of your
infrastructure and data flow diagrams, have probably captured the facts about
how you transmit data into and out of your organization. You need to include
the transmission facilities that are essential to critical business processes in
your DR plan. If you don’t include those facilities, one or more critical business
functions may be unable to operate in a disaster.
Here are some tips about how to identify and protect data transmission-
capabilities:
 Inventory all data transfer points. Identify all the external systems that
transfer data to or from your organization. You can look in two places:
• At any scheduling tool used to initiate data transfer connections
with other organizations
• At user IDs and passwords that other organizations use to initiate
connections with your system
This task is especially tedious if your organization doesn’t have an existing
inventory of all of the data transfer partners.
 Inventory encryption keys and means. If your data transfer system(s)
uses encryption, you need to capture all the details about encryption with
every external entity. Decide whether to use the same encryption keys
at your alternate processing center or develop alternative encryption
keys for your alternate site.
 Identify associated firewall rules. If your firewall has rules about permitting
inbound or outbound data transfer sessions, you need to translate these
rules for use at your alternate site. Translating, in this context, means
mapping IP addresses between the main and recovery sites (although it
may not be this simple if the DR site’s architecture is different from the
main site’s architecture). Similarly, the entities with which you exchange
data need to make adjustments in their firewall rule sets so their fire-
walls permit your file transfer sessions to and from your alternate sites.
184
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

For disaster recovery planning purposes, you need to protect not only business
information while in transit, but also the ability to continue transmitting and
receiving information from third parties.
Protecting data while in DR mode
In the preceding sections, I discuss various ways to protect data during normal
operations — backups, replication, off-site storage, data transmission, and so on.
While in disaster recovery mode — during a disaster when critical business
applications are operating in alternate locations — you also need all of these
protections:
 Back up DR servers.
 Protect backup media, usually through off-site storage.
 Protect transmitted data.
 Store critical data on resilient storage systems.
In disaster mode, business information and processes are just as critical as
they are in times of normal operations. Consequently, the systems and
processes that you use during a disaster must provide the same level of
protection as the primary systems and processes.
Protecting and Recovering Applications
Applications enable employees, customers, and suppliers to manage the pro-
duction and delivery of whatever goods or services your organization pro-
vides. Without applications, your business data just sits there, unable to
move or be seen. Applications bring data to life and give it meaning.
From a purist’s point of view, applications (meaning the software itself) are
just another form of business data. Although this assertion is mostly true,
you need to consider many issues when recovering applications that you
don’t have to worry about for data. You must consider these application-
specific issues and factors when building a DR plan:
 Version
 Patches and fixes
 Configuration
 Users and roles
 Interfaces
185
Chapter 8: Planning Data Recovery

 Customizations
 Pairing with OS and database versions
 Client systems
 Network considerations
 Change management
 Configuration management
In terms of disaster recovery, applications are a good deal more complex
than data. If you think that recovering applications is a simple restore-and-go
process, I hate to be the bearer of bad news. You have to know and address
many details — otherwise, restoring an application becomes a gamble.
Application version
Each application has a notation of its version. Many organizations lag behind
the most recent version of an application, particularly in larger and more
complex environments, such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), CRM
(Customer Relationship Management), MRP II (Manufacturing Resource
Planning), and financials.
Determine the steps you need to take to recover the current version of each
critical application.
Application patches and fixes
Organizations that run in-house developed applications need to keep a highly
detailed history of problems, solutions, changes, patches, and fixes made to
each critical application. Your organization may make these changes for a wide
variety of reasons, from feature changes to stability to cosmetic adjustments.
You need to make the level of recordkeeping for application changes so good
that a recovery team can use that recordkeeping to properly recover the
application in a disaster scenario, rolling forward all the changes so the appli-
cation can operate in the same way in the recovered environment.
For more about patches and fixes, see the section “Applications and change
management,” later in this chapter.
Application configuration
Applications are becoming more configuration-centric, thereby increasing
flexibility and reducing the need for customizations. The overburdened IT
186
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

industry has seen this development as a boon because IT departments don’t
have the in-house resources to maintain every application at the application
code layer. Some applications can have so many configuration settings that
just keeping track of all those settings can become someone’s full-time job.
And many configuration changes have an effect on data and external systems.
Configuration changes can alter the layout of data feeds and even database
schema. They can change the way that users log in and how the application
uses resources on servers and other equipment.
You need to do more than just blindly clone all configuration changes from a
production system onto a recovery system. That might be a good start, but
the recovery system may require different configuration settings so the appli-
cation can operate as intended in recovery mode. You need to put a lot of
thought into the meaning of some configuration settings to ensure that you
can recover and operate the application in a recovery setting, in which business
conditions and the technical environment are probably different than in day-to-
day business.
I discuss application configuration more in the section “Applications and
change management,” later in this chapter.
Application users and roles
Users log in to applications in order to perform their specific duties, according
to their roles in the organization. But logging in to an application isn’t as easy
as it looks. Consider some of the ways in which authentication can take place:
 Local password database: The application itself authenticates the user.
One or more tables contain user IDs, and encrypted or hashed passwords.
The application has its own login functions that it uses to identify and
authenticate the user.
 External directory service: The application performs its own authenti-
cation, but it doesn’t store user ID information. Instead, the application
makes a call to an external directory service, such as Microsoft Active
Directory, LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), or Liberty. An
application that relies on an external service needs to know how to find
the external service and communicate with it in real time to authenticate
users.
 Single Sign On (SSO): The application participates in an enterprise-wide
service whereby users authenticate once, and their credentials are
passed around between applications and a central session management
service. SSO can use any of dozens of services, including SAML,
Kerberos, HMAC, or OpenID.
187
Chapter 8: Planning Data Recovery

Users may also use two-factor authentication in conjunction with any of the
authentication methods in the preceding list. Two-factor authentication can
add unnecessary (or necessary) complication to a recovery environment
because of the extra hardware and software that you need.
The DR planning team needs to make some strategic decisions on how users
will authenticate to applications in a recovery environment. You may use the
same method currently in the normal business environment, or you may go
with a different approach. If you use a different method, all users who plan to
use the application in a recovery situation need to know how they can log in
to that application. You need to understand security requirements and possi-
bly contractual obligations to understand how you should implement authen-
tication in a DR system.
If an application relies on external entities for authentication, plan so that
you can accommodate the application’s need to communicate with the exter-
nal authentication service. You may need to make changes to firewalls, VPNs
(Virtual Private Networks, for remote access), routing, and host- or network-
based access control.
Roles
In all but the most simple and mundane applications, users are assigned
functions and/or permitted to perform certain functions in an application. In
today’s vernacular, you say that a user is assigned to one or more roles. A role is
a name (such as Revenue Clerk 1) that has specific application functions
associated with it. The application also uses access control to determine
what database information a given role is permitted to view, modify, or remove.
Some application environments have highly granular roles — these roles
require a lot more attention and foresight on the part of DR planners if you
want the organization to continue operating its applications in a recovery sit-
uation. In some environments, such as financial applications, each user’s role
has a paper trail for requests and approvals. You must maintain even this
kind of functionality in a disaster scenario to maintain compliance with laws,
regulations, and standards.
The assignment of roles may be closely tied to the way in which users are
authenticated. The DR planning team needs to carefully sift through the
details in order to determine how you can recover and operate such an appli-
cation in a recovery situation, realizing that in many disaster situations, dif-
ferent people may need to use and operate the application than those who do
in daily business when the sun is shining.
External users
External users can include suppliers, partners, or members of the general
public.
188
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Users of any given online application are largely unaware of the actual location
of the systems they’re using. In today’s online world, a natural or man-made
disaster can occur in some region of the world, and users don’t necessarily
connect such a disaster to the availability of the online application they use.
They just want to start their application client program or Web browser and
access the application as always, and they usually do so without a thought
about the application infrastructure that’s located somewhere, doing their
bidding.
If external users are your bread and butter, you need to make the manner in
which they authenticate to your applications consistent — so much so that
they have little or no idea whether they’re logging in to and using a recovery
system or the original.
Application interfaces
No application is an island. Applications often rely on back-end data transfers
that occur in real time or in batches. These data transfers may take place
between applications in the business, and they often involve exchanging
information with external entities.
I discuss this topic in Chapter 4 as it relates to identifying all data inputs and
outputs for systems and the organization, as a whole. This section talks
about these interfaces from the application’s point of view.
The application itself may have configurations, scheduled jobs, staging
tables, or other moving parts associated with data that’s sent to or from the
application. For each type of interface (and perhaps for each external entity,
as well), you need to document and understand all the details so these inter-
faces (at least, the critical ones) can function in a recovery environment.
Some of the interfaces’ configuration or operations details may contain specific
information, such as IP addresses, user IDs, or passwords. You probably need
to change some of these settings now so these interfaces can operate in a
recovery environment. You must find and document these settings now if you
want the recovery team to successfully get these interfaces running in a disaster.
Application customizations
Many organizations aren’t quite satisfied with the off-the-shelf behaviors and
functionality of applications. Often, those organizations write custom code
and wedge it into the application to make that application work the way they
want it to.
189
Chapter 8: Planning Data Recovery

Customizations may have specific rewards, but they also have certain risks.
These risks include, but aren’t limited to, disaster recovery planning.
Creating customizations and integrating them into an application require
effort, and you usually need to re-implement the customizations when you
upgrade the application in order to keep those customizations working, even
in a disaster scenario.
Generally speaking, you should assume that an application won’t work prop-
erly unless you have all of its customizations in place. So, you must apply all
customizations to the recovery environment. Depending on how system
developers develop and implement customizations for a given application,
you may need to recover both the application itself and the development
environment so that you can recompile or reinstall customizations into pro-
duction systems.
Managing customizations can add considerable complexity to a recovery plan.
On an ongoing basis, an organization may be able to make some key changes
so it can more easily determine whether specific customizations are critical
in a recovery situation, as well as more simply install customizations.
Applications dependencies with databases,
operating systems, and more
Applications are at the top of the stack, but they don’t exist in a vacuum. Instead,
applications depend on a great many details further down in the stack, almost
to the bottom. Figure 8-4 contains a depiction of the application stack.

190
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

A properly operating application depends on many details in the other layers
in the stack:
 Operating system version, patches, and configuration: The version of
the application that you want to build in the recovery environment may
require a specific version of the operating system (OS). Also, you may
need (or need to avoid) certain OS patches. And the application may
depend on several OS configuration settings in order to work properly.
 Database management system version, patches, and configuration: An
application in a recovery environment may require specific versions of
the database management system (DBMS), including specific patches
and configurations.
 Database names and locations: The application may look in specific
locations for data or connect with specifically named databases.
 Web server version, patches, and configuration: Many Web-based
applications use a separate Web server that’s configured to run one or
more specific applications. You often need the version, patch levels, and
configuration of such a Web server for the application to work properly.
 Network: An application may have one or more external systems specifi-
cally named, either by DNS host name or by IP address. Other possible
network-based dependencies include configurations of Web servers,
authentication servers, and sources for external feeds.
A careful analysis of dependencies in the stack may uncover additional
dependencies. Be sure to capture these details so you can make your recovery
plans accurate and successful.
Applications and client systems
Applications require client systems in order to work properly. Clients allow
users to communicate with the application so the users can do whatever it is
they do with the application.
These clients may be
 Client software: Many applications use client software that’s installed
on end-user workstations. In order for this software to work properly,
you may need specific versions of these clients that have particular
configuration settings. In turn, the client software may impose specific
dependencies on the workstation OS, patch level, and configuration
settings. The topics in the preceding section may apply to client systems,
as well as many aspects of server architecture and configuration.
191
Chapter 8: Planning Data Recovery

 Web browsers: Web-based applications require only Web browsers — or
do they? Often, these applications also require a Java run-time program,
ActiveX controls, browser helper objects (BHOs), and other components.
And Web browsers have versions, patches, and configurations of their
own that often must be just right.
 Terminal emulators: PCs that run terminal emulation software, which is
just another application client, often access many mainframe applications.
Like with client software of other types, you have to get versioning,
patches, configuration, and perhaps other factors right so that the
software works properly.
Applications and networks
Applications communicate. They communicate over networks to other appli-
cations, client systems, and network-based services for a variety of reasons,
including authentication. Applications depend on networks just to function,
in most cases.
Some of the ways in which applications depend on networks include
 Domain name service (DNS): When applications need to establish
communications with other systems (or when they want to know the
name of the host that wants to communicate with them), they need to
make queries to DNS servers. Most of the time, the underlying OS (on
both servers and clients) contains information about server IP addresses
and domain names. A common problem occurs when an application wants
to communicate with a given hostname, but the application doesn’t
specify the fully qualified host name (FQDN), such as fileserver.acct.
company.com, but instead just specifies fileserver. In a recovery
environment, the network’s domain name may be different (for example,
recovery.company.com), and the desired host name may not exist in
the recovery domain. You need to use a consistent approach to server
naming so that applications can function correctly in a recovery environ-
ment and you can more easily maintain them in the primary environment.
 Hard-coded IP addresses: Some applications have hard-coded IP
addresses for network resources. When an application needs to commu-
nicate with another system, the application usually references the system
by name, but developers sometimes use IP addresses. You need to identify,
document, and remedy these hard-coded IP addresses if you want the
application to work properly in a recovery environment.
 Hard-coded network resource names: Instead of using a configuration
file to store resource names, applications might have hard-coded network
resources that include file servers, database servers, printers, and other
network based resources.
192
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

 Authentication service: Applications often don’t authenticate users
directly, but instead rely on an authentication service, such as LDAP,
Kerberos, or Active Directory.
 Network configurations: The network layers may contain configurations
that facilitate proper operation of (or access to) an application.
Examples include VPN connections to external entities, NAT settings,
custom routes, router ACLs, and holes in firewalls.
Applications and change management
Most organizations use a change management process to control the changes
that they make on production systems. The main benefit to a DR program
that includes a formal change management process is that the organization
has a formal record of all changes it makes to the production environment.
This record can help the recovery team with the task of building the recovery
environment. The team can more conveniently see the recent changes that
were made, as well as why they were made.
Here are some additional considerations about change management and DR
planning:
 Change management doesn’t always record all the changes made to a
production system. Routine, low-risk, and low-impact changes may be
exempt from the change management process.
 Systems or infrastructure that support specific applications may lie outside
the scope of change management.
 Secret changes that circumvent the change management process may
not be recorded. The team that builds the recovery system has to work
without knowledge of those changes, which could lead to unexpected
results.
Applications and configuration management
Many organizations use configuration management to track all changes they
make to their environments. You can use configuration management systems
to track all changes in all layers of the stack (possibly including hardware
changes), enabling an organization to know precisely what’s happening on
the systems that a configuration management system manages.
You can use some configuration management systems to rebuild application
servers in a bare-metal-restore recovery (in which you recover a server in a
single step — operating system, database, application, and data). Having such
a capability would be potentially powerful for building recovery servers in an
alternate processing center because it could simplify the server recovery
193
Chapter 8: Planning Data Recovery

procedure to just a few steps. In fact, with advance knowledge about a recov-
ery processing center, you may be able to configure the configuration man-
agement system so that it creates application servers that would properly
function at the alternate processing site. Your mileage may vary.
Off-Site Media and Records Storage
In the section “Deciding where to keep your recovery data,” earlier in this
chapter, I discuss off-site media storage in the context of backups. Backups
are only a portion of the entire set of data that you may want to protect from
loss by storing off-site. An organization should include all of the following
types of data in its off-site storage strategy:
 Backup media: Protects the organization against loss of vital online
information if a catastrophic event occurs in the primary processing
center.
 Backup records: Information about which tapes (or disks) you used to
back up which databases on which days. Vital for recovering applications
from backup media.
 Release media: The CDs and tapes that contain the software you purchase
to run on your servers. If you purchase the software by downloading it,
copy that software to CD or other suitable media, and then store a copy
off-site.
 Infrastructure diagrams and schematics: All the drawings and records
that show how the current environment is assembled, including data
flow, network addresses, and so on.
 Software release and operations documentation: All documentation that
comes with software, including installation, operations, programming,
release notes, and so on. If you have soft copies only (maybe you ordered
the software online and downloaded it), get copies stored off-site. If you
have hardcopies only, either scan or photocopy them and store those
copies off-site.
 Software licenses and activation codes: Information that you need to
activate software — for example, license codes.
 Encryption keys: Keys you use to encrypt and decrypt files, stored data,
and communications sessions.
 Passwords: User IDs and passwords that gain access to key accounts at
every layer in the stack so administrators can make an application fully
functional.
 Change management and configuration management records: The
information that contains changes made to applications and supporting
infrastructure. Vital when a recovery team attempts to recover and
restart a critical application.
194
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

 Inventory information: Lists of hardware, software, licenses, and what-
ever you use to track all the components in all the layers that support
vital applications.
 Disaster recovery plans: All the procedures, emergency contact lists,
and other information you need to recover vital applications during a
disaster.
 Catalog of information stored off-site: A master list of everything that
you store off-site: names, descriptions, creation dates, and so forth.
The preceding list gives you a lot of information to store at an off-site facility.
Remember, store all the information you need to recover vital applications in
a real disaster at this off-site facility. Assume the disaster will completely
destroy the current information processing facilities and you’ll need to
rebuild everything from only the knowledge and information stored at the off-
site data center.
By reading the preceding list of data that you should store off-site, you may
realize that you need to make the security of such a facility of paramount
importance. The last thing you want to have happen is a breach of security at
the off-site storage facility that could result in a disclosure of a great deal of
vital information about your organization!
Consider only an off-site storage provider whose primary line of business
includes this activity. An employee’s home or a bank safe deposit box isn’t an
acceptable solution for off-site storage! Here are some requirements to
include in your shopping list for off-site storage providers:
 Secure siting: An unmarked building in a low-traffic area away from natural
and man-made threats.
 Multiple layers of physical security: At least two or three layers of access
control (main entrance, inner storage area, clients’ individual storage areas)
with badges or biometric authentication, video surveillance, man traps,
and guards. Least-privilege access to all locations. Dual-custody access to
client assets. Audit trails on all accesses. Employees with clean background
checks.
 Secure delivery vehicles: Double-locked to protect client assets. Drivers
who have clean background checks. Effective and secure pickup and
delivery procedures.
 Secure procedures: Multiple approvals needed to retrieve assets from
the secure facility. Thorough recordkeeping for transfer and storage of
all assets.
 24/7/365 availability: Ability to retrieve assets any hour of the day, any
day of the year.
195
Chapter 8: Planning Data Recovery

 Location, location, location! Close enough to the primary business location
so you can return assets quickly, but not so close that the off-site storage
facility is involved in the same regional disaster as your primary processing
site. A lot of good all your off-site storage efforts would be if an earthquake
or hurricane damaged both facilities.
If your organization has several business locations — possibly including an
alternate processing site — you can consider one of your own business locations
as your off-site storage facility. Your alternate facility may not have all the
features in the preceding list; you need to identify which features are available
and perform a risk analysis to determine whether you need any additional
security features.

T
he job isn’t done until the paperwork’s done.
Nowhere is this pithy saying truer than in disaster recovery planning. The
paperwork in DR planning outlines how to jump-start the business when the
big one hits. Depending on where your business is located, the big one may
be an earthquake, labor strike, hurricane, flood, or a swarm of locusts.
The paperwork for DR planning simply covers the procedures and other 
documents that business personnel must refer to in order to get things going
again after a disaster. The DR planning procedures are especially important
because people who aren’t the foremost experts on the systems that support
critical business processes may have to read and follow those procedures.
Those people have to rebuild critical systems in a short period of time so those
systems can support critical processes. And the people performing those
processes probably aren’t subject matter experts at the business process level.
The business’s survival depends on the paperwork being right. You don’t get
any second chances.
In this chapter, I explain how to actually write down the DR plan.
You just love documentation, right? Thought so.

Determining Plan Contents
Before embarking on the task of actually writing the DR plan, the team needs
to agree what the DR plan is. You can describe it something like this:
The disaster recovery plan is the set of documents that describes post-
disaster emergency response, damage assessment, and system restart 
for designated critical business processes.
The devil, as they say, is in the details.
DR plans should contain several key elements that you can use to jumpstart
critical systems and processes after a disaster strikes. Most organizations
should include the following elements in their DR plan:
 A disaster-declaration procedure
 Emergency contact lists and trees
 Emergency leadership selection (the predetermined leadership team
and also the procedure to quickly assemble a team)
 Damage assessment procedures
 System recovery and restart procedures
 Procedures for the transition to normal operations
 Recovery team selection (the pre-selected recovery team, as well as the
process for finding others who can help when disaster actually strikes)
I cover these elements in greater detail in the following sections.
Disaster declaration procedure
Disaster recovery procedures commence when somebody says so. And when
does someone say so? When a disaster has occurred.
I’m sorry if this sounds silly. Many DR planners get too hung up on how to
declare a disaster. Here are a few ideas for how to declare a disaster, one of
which may work for you:
 Declaration by consensus: You designate a core team of decision makers,
probably middle or senior managers, as the DR leadership team. When a
disaster occurs, the core team members contact one another and perhaps
convene a conference call, if they can. When two or more of the core team
members agree that the organization should start the disaster recovery
plan, they make that decision. This decision triggers the execution of the
DR plan. A typical declaration might go something like this:
198
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

1. The event occurs.
2. Two or more DR plan core team members discuss the event by
telephone, if possible. They exchange information about what they
know of the event and the potential impact on the business.
3. Two or more core team members conclude that the event has 
sufficient impact on the business to affect business operations.
4. The core team members decide to declare a disaster, which trig-
gers disaster response and recovery actions, including performing
emergency communications and action plans that assess damage
and begin restoration of services.
You don’t need to make your disaster declaration procedure much more
complicated than the preceding steps.
Core team members may or may not be near the business facility when
they need to make a direct assessment of the event’s impact. They can
make a judgment call and decide based on what they know at the time, or
they can choose to gather more information before making a declaration.
 Declaration by criteria: Designate core team members as the DR 
leadership team. When an event occurs, one or more of them reads a
short checklist, which might be a series of Yes or No questions. If certain
answers, or a minimum number of answers, are Yes, the team declares a
disaster, which triggers the DR plan. Here’s how this process might play
out in a disaster:
1. A weather-related event occurs that has widespread impact on 
a city.
2. DR plan core team members begin to contact one another to share
information about the situation.
3. Available core team members answer basic questions on their disas-
ter declaration checklists. The core team members decide that the
results of the checklist warrant a disaster declaration. If they can’t
come to a consensus, either they have to gather more information
or just decide one way or the other.
4. The core team declares a disaster and begins to notify other core
team members, instructing them to begin working through their
DR plan procedures to assess, contain, and begin recovery from
the disaster.
Over the years, I’ve heard many people express the same concern: What if 
an organization declares a disaster unnecessarily? The short answer: Don’t
worry about it. If the core team declares a disaster, and they later decide that
the situation isn’t so bad, they can just call a halt to the disaster response. For
example, if a severe weather event results in widespread utility outages and
transportation problems, an organization might initially declare a disaster 
but later cancel the disaster response effort when it discovers that critical IT
systems are only lightly isolated and quickly recoverable, despite feet of snow,
inches of water, volcanic ash, or whatever prompted the disaster declaration.
199
Chapter 9: Writing the Disaster Recovery Plan

You can make disaster declaration as scientific or unscientific as you need it
to be. Don’t make it too complicated, or the core team members may hesitate
to declare a disaster if they can’t decide whether they should.
Emergency contact lists and trees
After you declare a disaster, the logical next step in a comprehensive plan is 
to begin notifying the personnel who are responsible for performing DR-plan-
related activities, such as communications, assessment, and recovery. The DR
plan core team members who participate in the disaster declaration obviously
know first when the organization declares a disaster, and the notifications
move out from there to additional disaster response personnel, management,
personnel who communicate with suppliers and customers, and so on.
Where will DR planning core team members be when a disaster occurs? The
decidedly unscientific method in this section is based on simple probabilities.
A seven-day period contains five workdays, which total 168 hours. Presuming
that a core team member has a life, Table 9-1 shows the probability breakdown
for employees’ possible activities, giving you an idea of where people may be
when the disaster strikes.

When a disaster strikes, employees will probably be at home, either sleeping,
working, or relaxing. The next most likely place they’ll be is at work itself, fol-
lowed by commuting, shopping, at worship, and doing something else entirely.
Table 9-1 doesn’t factor in weeks of vacation or business travel. If a core team
member spends a lot of recreation time away from home (boating, hiking, or
200
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

whatever), that core team member will more likely be away from home when 
a disaster strikes.
Given the high probability that a disaster will occur when core team members
are away from work, you need to make the information that core team mem-
bers need both portable and easy to use. You have a lot of choices when it
comes to storing emergency contact information, as well as performing other
disaster declaration and emergency communications activities. Table 9-2 
features these choices.

Many organizations put emergency contact lists on laminated wallet cards.
Wallet cards are very portable because they can fit into a wallet or billfold. And
staff are more likely to have their wallets or billfolds (and therefore their cards)
with them when a disaster event occurs, even if they’re on vacation or away
from home. People don’t need electricity or any other technology to read a
wallet card.
201
Chapter 9: Writing the Disaster Recovery Plan

Consider putting the following items on your emergency-contact wallet cards:
 Core team member names: But, of course!
 Mobile, home, and office phone numbers: Talking live by phone is the
next best thing to being there.
 Spouse mobile and office numbers: When you can’t find a core team
member, calling his or her spouse may help locate him or her.
 E-mail and instant messaging contacts: In a disaster, you never know
what infrastructures will be down and what will still be running.
 Conference bridge numbers: More than one, preferably, and from 
different services.
 Key business addresses: Just in case core team members need to know.
 Hints on disaster declaration procedures: Jog the core team members’
memories.
 URL that contains more disaster procedures: Disaster recovery proce-
dures stored online. Hopefully hosted far, far away from your business,
in case damage is widespread.
You might need more information than what appears in the preceding list, or
you might need less, depending on your disaster recovery and business needs.
Emergency leadership and role selection
When your organization declares a disaster, who’s going to lead the response
team?
Actually, I think the question should be, who’s not going to lead it? At the onset
of a disaster, core team members each have a number of distinct responsibili-
ties related to their respective departments. Each member will have enough to
keep him or her busy when a disaster unfolds. But during a disaster, several
decisions must be made, minute by minute and hour by hour.
Your first natural inclination might be to select, from among the core team
members, the person who should be the team’s leader before the recovery
effort even begins. But, depending on the nature of the disaster and when it
occurs, you don’t know which core team members will be active at the onset
of the disaster. You could rank-order possible leaders from among core team
members, or you could let them figure it out amongst themselves. In disaster
situations, one of the core team members will just step out and lead the rest. If
your core team comes from company management, several of your core team
members have leadership skills and talents. One of them will take the lead,
and the others will follow. You don’t need to get scientific about who will lead.
In fact, you can probably just let the team members figure it out on their own.
202
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

The nature of the disaster may call for around-the-clock response for a few
days, or even a long stretch of days or weeks. At least at the beginning of the
disaster, the core response team should assign one of its members a duty-
officer role, which involves leading the team for a period of several hours.
Leaders can trade off, giving members a chance to rest if your organization
need 24/7 coverage.
When a disaster response stretches into several days, the response team
should set up a more formal leadership and management schedule so all
team members know who’s in charge at what times and on what days. But,
like a few other matters in disaster response and recovery (such as leader-
ship selection), you probably don’t want to get too rigid in your DR plan.
Allow the leadership and response team to make those decisions on the fly.
After all, you need to consider many possible scenarios with varying damage
and recovery conditions, and you’ll have an unpredictable selection of 
personnel available to lead, manage, and recover the business.
In addition to the leadership and management roles, you also need a scribe.
Somebody needs to write down the discussions, duties, findings, and deci-
sions. Don’t count on remembering these decisions later because it may all be
a blur when the disaster response team can finally stand down after a lengthy
recovery effort. Instead, record these decisions and other matters on the spot.
At the beginning of the disaster, scribes should operate the old-fashioned
way — pen and paper. High tech solutions, such as notebook computers or
voice recorders, might very well be impractical, depending on the nature of
the disaster.
Damage assessment procedures
The disaster recovery plan needs to include procedures for assessing damage
to equipment and facilities. The objective of damage assessment is to identify
the state of the IT systems and supporting facilities that are involved in a disas-
ter and to decide whether the systems and supporting facilities are damaged
or disabled to the extent that you need IT systems in another location to 
continue supporting critical business functions.
Damage assessment is both an art and a science. In this section, I don’t tell
you how to determine whether a building is safe for occupancy — that’s a
role for professional civil and structural engineers. Similarly, I don’t delve
into whether a disaster warrants evacuation or if personnel can stay behind
to help with assessment and possible recovery or restarts. These matters are
important, to be sure, but they’re beyond the scope of this book.
203
Chapter 9: Writing the Disaster Recovery Plan

No business process is worth risking a person’s life. Personnel safety must
always be the top priority in any disaster recovery plan. If the hurricane, 
tornado, or rising floodwaters are coming — or if an earthquake or landslide
has damaged a building — don’t stay behind or enter buildings with unknown
dangers for the sake of the business.
Damage assessment procedures focus on determining what happened to criti-
cal IT systems and the related facilities — such as HVAC (Heating, Ventilation,
and Air Conditioning), network, utilities, and security perimeter — in a disaster.
You also need to figure out whether you can still access or restart IT systems,
or whether the business needs to implement its Plan B — the disaster 
recovery plan.
You don’t need to use complicated damage assessment procedures, but you
may find the procedures you do use a bit tedious. The tedium may lie in the
number of simple checks you need to perform in order to assess the overall
health and availability of systems. Here’s an example to help explain what 
I mean:
Acme Services (not a real company) is an organization that provides online
records management to corporate customers around the world. A natural
or man-made disaster has occurred (imagine a hurricane, civil unrest,
tsunami, earthquake, flood, or whatever other disaster you’re familiar with),
and Acme’s online systems have experienced a temporary interruption.
As specified in Acme’s disaster declaration procedure, the core team
members who were able to contact one another determined that the mag-
nitude of the disaster warranted the declaration of an official disaster and
the initiation of the disaster recovery plan.
After some delays related to the nature of the disaster (imagine a damaged
transportation infrastructure), some emergency response personnel arrived
at Acme’s office building. They hesitantly entered the building (which didn’t
appear damaged) to find that the building had no electricity or running
water. IT systems appeared undamaged. The UPS batteries had been
exhausted (it took personnel over an hour to reach the facility), and the
backup generator wasn’t running.
Because the Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) for Acme’s critical
online processes was set to eight hours, the damage assessment team
decides that they need to put the DR plan into full force. Even if they
started the generator right away, the health of the IT systems was in
question, and customers from around the world were anxious to access
Acme’s systems so that they could go about their business.
The preceding example is a little simplistic, but it contains an important judg-
ment call: No people were available to start the generator. If someone had been
able to start the generator, the team still would have needed time to assess the
health and reach-ability of the critical IT systems. Further, a generator typically
has only several hours of fuel, not enough to keep critical systems going until
204
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

power is restored, which could take several days in a widespread disaster. The
team’s decision to invoke the disaster recovery plan was sound.
Assessment procedures are basically just checklists. You need to examine
these potentially long lists of items and check either the Running or Not
Running box. One or more Not Running checkmarks might mean that you need
to use systems in alternate locations, unless you can quickly remedy the Not
Running items. Assessment is just that: an examination of what’s running and
what’s not. After you assess the items, you need to begin recovery and restart
procedures, both of which I cover in the following section.
The personnel who carry out damage assessment procedures might not be
subject matter experts. In a disaster, the preferred individuals who know 
the most about systems often aren’t available for assessment or recovery.
Hence, you need to make damage assessment procedures detailed enough 
so people other than the main subject matter experts can properly carry out
the procedures.
You can get templates for virtually all disaster recovery procedures from a
variety of sources. Chapter 14 and Chapter 15 contain sources for these and
other tools and capabilities.
System recovery and restart procedures
After you develop the disaster declaration and assessment procedures, you
need to create the instructions for recovering and restarting vital IT systems.
You use these procedures to recover and restart IT systems that support 
critical business processes as soon as possible.
You likely need to make your system recovery and restart procedures pretty
complex and lengthy. They need to include every tiny detail involved in getting
systems up and running from various states, including bare metal (servers with
no operating system or application software installed on them).
This list illustrates some disaster scenarios for cold sites, warm sites, and
hot sites:
 Cold site: In a cold-site restart scenario, you may or may not have com-
puters to start with (the typical cold site has no computers). They could
be boxed up, or maybe you have to go and buy them. A typical cold-site
procedure might resemble these steps:
1. Order systems and network devices from a supplier or manufacturer
to replace the systems and devices damaged by the disaster.
2. Retrieve the most recent backup media from wherever you store it.
3. Install network devices and build a server network. Verify connec-
tivity to customers, suppliers, and partners.
205
Chapter 9: Writing the Disaster Recovery Plan

4. Install operating systems and applications on new servers.
5. Restore data from backup media.
6. Start the applications and perform functionality tests.
7. Announce the availability of recovered applications to employees,
customers, and partners, as needed.
The preceding procedure probably takes place over a period of several
days to as long as two weeks.
 Warm site: With equipment and servers already on hand, a warm site
recovery takes less time and is generally a little less complicated than a
cold site recovery. Here’s a typical warm-site procedure:
1. Retrieve the most recent backup media from wherever you store it.
2. Configure network devices. Verify connectivity to customers, 
suppliers, and partners.
3. Install or update operating systems and applications on new
servers.
4. Restore data from backup media.
5. Start the applications and perform functionality tests.
6. Announce the availability of recovered applications to employees,
customers, and partners, as needed.
The preceding warm-site procedure is similar to the cold-site procedure,
but you have a head start with a warm site over a cold site because you
already have computers available.
 Hot site: Ready to assume production duties with already-prepared
servers within hours or even minutes. Here’s a typical hot-site procedure:
1. Confirm the state of the most recent mirroring or replication 
activities.
2. Make any required network configuration changes.
3. Switch the state of server cluster nodes and database servers to
active.
4. Perform application functionality tests.
5. Announce the availability of recovered applications to employees,
customers, and partners, as needed.
Systems at a hot site are very nearly ready to take over operational duties
with short notice. The exact procedures for a cutover to hot site servers
depends on the technologies you use to bring about the readiness —
whether transaction replication, mirroring, clustering, or a combination 
of these.
206
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

I deliberately omitted many details from the procedures in the preceding list.
You need to take many additional factors into account when you develop
your system recovery procedures:
 Communications: Throughout the recovery operation, recovery teams
need to be in constant communication with the DR core team, as well as
customers, suppliers, partners, and other entities.
 Work areas: Establish an area where critical IT workers can work during
and after the recovery operation. IT systems in a recovered state might
be somewhat more unstable than they were in their original production
environments, and they might require more observation, adjusting, and
tuning.
 Expertise: Make the recovery procedures general enough so that people
who are familiar with systems administration duties, but not necessarily
your systems, can recover your systems without having to make guesses
or assumptions. Step by step means step by step!
The people who write the system recovery procedures should assume that
whoever reads and follows those procedures in an actual disaster has no
familiarity with your particular system’s environment.
Templates that you can get from several sources have outlines for system
recovery procedures. I discuss these templates in Chapter 14 and Chapter 15.
Transition to normal operations
After the disaster occurs and you recover critical IT systems at an alternate
processing center, recovery activities have restored the original processing
and work facilities. When you recover the original processing center, you
need to reestablish IT systems there and shut down the alternate site.
The timing of the cutover back to the original processing center (or a perma-
nent replacement facility if the original facility was completely destroyed)
depends on many factors, including
 Application stability: If applications running in the recovery site are 
a little unstable, consult the personnel maintaining the applications to
determine the best time to transition back to the main processing site.
 Business workload: Transition back to the main processing site at a
time when workload is low so any users or related systems will better
tolerate the actual cutover.
 Available staff: Have sufficient staff at both the recovery site and the
main processing site to switch processing back to the main site.
207
Chapter 9: Writing the Disaster Recovery Plan

 Costs: Additional costs associated with operating the recovery site may
bring pressure to transition back to the main processing site as soon as
possible.
 Functional readiness: Operating and supporting critical IT applications at
the main processing site must meet some minimum criteria so the applica-
tions can function properly after you transition them back to the main
site. In other words, are you ready to get back to normal operations?
Write down the procedures for transitioning systems back to primary process-
ing sites. These procedures aren’t the same as the recovery procedures. The
state and configuration of systems in the alternate processing site probably
won’t be precisely the way you planned them. For whatever reasons, you 
may have had to make some changes during the recovery procedures that
resulted in the recovery systems not being configured or architected pre-
cisely as you intended. In other words, the starting point for transition back
to the main processing sites may not be exactly as the DR planners antici-
pated. So, the procedures for getting back to the main site won’t exactly fit,
either. Figure 9-1 illustrates the fact that transitioning back to the primary site
doesn’t necessarily mean transitioning back to the primary state.
You need to write procedures that explain how to transition from the tempo-
rary DR systems back to systems in the primary processing site. How can you
write a procedure to get to the desired end state when you don’t know exactly
what the initial state (the recovery systems) will be?
Testing can help with this conundrum. Full testing, including a failover test,
forces recovery team members to actually construct application recovery sys-
tems and infrastructure, and then transition them back. During those tests, you

should uncover most of the variables that may occur in an actual disaster, so
the transition-to-normal procedures should very closely resemble reality. I
describe the various types of tests in Chapter 10.
Finally, you can incorporate issues you uncover during testing into release
notes (a detailed description of systems and procedures) that recovery per-
sonnel can read to better understand any issues they may encounter during
recovery and transition-to-normal operations.
Recovery team
When the disaster strikes, who can the core team depend on to perform all of
the tasks associated with communications, assessment, system recovery, and
transition-to-normal operations? Anyone they can find. Remember, you can
choose your recovery team in advance, but a disaster can render some of
those team members unavailable for various reasons.
Seriously, depending on the type of disaster, many of the normal operational
staff many be unavailable for a variety of reasons, including
 Family and home come first: When a regional disaster occurs, workers
with families and homes attend to those needs before thinking of work.
When workers have things under control on the home front, then they
can turn their attention to the workplace and their work responsibilities.
 Transportation issues: Regional disasters can disrupt transportation
systems, making it difficult for workers to travel to work locations.
 Disrupted communications: Workers can often perform many recovery
tasks over the wire, through VPN (Virtual Private Network, for remote
access) connections from their residences to business networks. But 
a widespread disaster can disrupt communications, making such work
difficult or impossible to perform.
 Evacuations: Often, civil authorities order mass evacuations that pre-
vent workers from being able to travel to work locations. Sometimes,
evacuations work in reverse, preventing workers from leaving work to
travel home, which introduces a whole other set of challenges.
 Injury, illness, and death: Regional disasters are often, by their nature,
violent, which can lead to injuries, disease, and fatalities.
You can’t handpick your recovery team members. The disaster selects them
for you. For this reason, you need to make recovery procedures specific
enough that anyone with the basic relevant skills can carry them out 
confidently and correctly.
209
Chapter 9: Writing the Disaster Recovery Plan

Structuring the Plan
The preceding sections in this chapter discuss the contents of a disaster
recovery plan in the very pragmatic sense — the sections and words that you
put into the DR plan documents. In all but the smallest organizations, several
people write sections of the plan, and many more people are involved in doc-
ument review. In the following sections, I describe some of the approaches
and methods that you can use to assemble a disaster recovery plan.
You don’t have to write the plan from scratch. You can get templates from
several sources listed in Chapter 14 and Chapter 15.
Enterprise-level structure
This section looks at some ways that an organization can slice and dice its
DR plans. You might adopt one of these approaches or tailor one to fit your
business needs.
Multi-unit organizations doing large DR plans have to figure out how to write
these plans for critical processes and applications that span departments or
business units. Should DR plans align with applications, or should they align
with the business units? It’s difficult to say; your DR development team needs
to weigh the options and decide. Figure 9-2 shows an application versus 
business-unit point of view.
Figure 9-2:
DR plans

functions, or

210
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Here are some considerations that can help you understand how to approach
this big-picture issue:
 Geography: Disasters, for the most part, strike a geographic region,
regardless of the organizational or political structures of the organizations
located in those regions. Writing DR plans that take care of business in the
regions hit by disasters may make the most sense for your organization. In
a large company, DR plans need to reference business units and functions
that are located in other locations, particularly when those units and func-
tions are on the critical path for business processes affected by a disaster.
 Organization structure: Different segments of a large organization may
push forward on DR planning at different rates. One segment’s lack of
progress shouldn’t impede another segment. Think of this type of situa-
tion as a DR plan for each cog in the organizational wheel. If you do things
in your organization business unit by business unit, you may want to build
the DR plan in pieces, asynchronously.
 Business function: The point of disaster recovery planning is to recover
and restore critical business functions as quickly as possible, regardless
of the geographical or political makeup of the organization. With this
purpose in mind, DR plans should address whole business processes,
regardless of where specific functions are located.
The preceding list of considerations is somewhat idealistic. Although ideal-
ism doesn’t factor much into real-world business, consider these points of
view when you try to figure out how your organization needs to structure its
DR planning.
Document-level structure
Like any formal project in which important business information appears 
in documents, consider setting up some structure within individual disaster-
recovery documents. Yes, I’m talking document templates. Your templates
may include the following:
 Standard document and file naming: Make the names of different docu-
ments (what appears on the title page), as well as those documents’ file
names (the name of the document in a computer), consistent.
 Standard headers and footers: Include the document name at the top of
each page (header) and information such as Company Confidential, page
number, date, and version number at the bottom of each page (footer).
 Title page: Create a formal title page that includes all the document
metadata, including title (but, of course!), version, date, and so on.
211
Chapter 9: Writing the Disaster Recovery Plan

 Table of contents: A table of contents helps the reader quickly find 
sections in the document. Larger documents may also need an index, 
list of figures, and list of tables.
 Copyright and other legalese: Helps protect the organization’s intellec-
tual property.
 Modification history: Helps you keep track of the changes made from
one version to the next, as well as who made those changes and when.
 Document version: Call me picky, but it helps.
 Standard headings and paragraphs: A consistent appearance makes the
DR documents easier to read and work with. You might even consider
doing nested section numbering (such as Section 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, and so on)
if you have a really big DR plan.
Depending on the maturity of document management in your organization, the
template structure in the preceding list might be too heavy, too lightweight, or
just right — just like in the timeless story, “The Three Bears.”
Managing Plan Development
Unless you have just one person writing your organization’s DR plan, you
need to establish some process and procedure for this effort so the pieces of
the plan come together smoothly without getting tangled. You need formal
document management, including these kinds of activities and capabilities:
 Formal document templates: I discuss templates in detail in the 
preceding section.
 Version control: Keep track of document versions manually, perhaps 
by putting the version number of each document in that document’s
name. You can also use a formal document management product that
performs functions such as document check-out, check-in, and version
management. You can find several good document management products
available today, and maybe your organization has one already.
 Document review: Establish a formal document review procedure in
which a document’s author circulates each document to specific review-
ers who can make edits and comments. Some document management
products manage document review.
This book covers just the high-level basics of document management so you
can better organize the development of DR plan documents if you have several
people writing those documents and more people reviewing them.
212
Part II: Building Technology Recovery Plans 

Preserving the Plan
When you have completely written, reviewed, corrected, revised, and 
examined the plan, you need to protect that plan from harm and loss. In 
other words, you need to make the DR plan itself disaster-proof! What good 
is a good DR plan if it’s trapped inside inoperable systems that were damaged
or destroyed in a disaster?
You need to preserve your DR plan, along with a lot of supporting informa-
tion, against loss, just in case a significant disaster occurs. Think worst-case
scenario, whatever that might be in your part of the world. Here are some
methods you can use to preserve your DR plan, just in case the unthinkable
happens:
 Three-ring binders: Often, the low-tech way is best. Binders don’t need
power cords or power supplies. Make binders for each core team member,
as well as other key personnel. Make a set for work and another set for
home. One downside is the difficulty in keeping them all current. I didn’t
say DR planning was easy!
 CD-ROM or USB keys: These devices are compact and lightweight, 
and they have a lot of capacity. On the downside, you need a working
computer to access them.
 Internet-accessible servers: These servers are a good idea, as long as you
locate at least some of them far away from the main business centers so a
regional disaster won’t affect them. A possible downside is that you need
Internet connectivity to access these servers.
 Off-site storage: Chances are, most organizations use off-site media stor-
age for backup media safe-keeping. Often, these off-site storage firms also
store paper records in addition to electronic records, so why not have
them store your DR plans?
Taking the Next Steps
After you write your DR plan, are you done? Hardly. You have many tasks still
ahead.
You need to test your DR plans to be sure that they’ll actually work in a real
disaster. DR-plan testing is covered in Chapter 10.
After you finalize and bless your DR plan, are the underlying software and
data architecture, business processes, and supporting IT systems going to
stop changing? No way! Disaster recovery plans need to be kept up-to-date,
which I cover in Chapter 11.

tests to full-on cutover testing.
And, even after you finish testing, you aren’t done with the plan. But, as with

Testing the DR Plan
Disaster recovery plans aren’t much good if they don’t work. And if they
don’t work, you pretty much waste the time devoted to their development.
Decision makers in businesses, especially executives, like certainty. They
want to have confidence that things will go as planned. And although no one
plans a disaster, execs want to know that the recovery effort after a disaster
will work.

The survival of the business may depend on it.
To see if your DR plan will work, you can always take it to a fortune teller, 
but I wouldn’t put much stock in that. Why not just try it?
Why test a DR plan?
Disaster recovery plans contain lists of procedures and other information that
an emergency response team follows when a natural or man-made disaster
occurs. The purpose of the plan is to recover the IT systems and infrastructure
that support business processes critical to the organization’s survival. Because
disasters don’t occur very often, you seldom can clearly tell whether those DR
plans will actually work. And given the nature of disasters, if your DR plan fails,
the organization may not survive the disaster.
Testing is a natural part of the lifecycle for many technology development
efforts today: software, processes, and — yes — disaster recovery planning.
Figure 10-1 depicts the DR plan lifecycle.
When you test the DR plan, note any discrepancies, and then pass the 
plan back to the people who wrote each section so they can update it. This
process improves the quality and accuracy of the DR plan, which increases the 
likelihood that the organization will actually survive a disaster if one occurs.
Another great benefit of DR plans and their tests is the likelihood that, by
undertaking them, you can improve the organization’s everyday processes and
systems. When teams closely scrutinize processes and figure out how they can
protect and recover those processes, often the team members discover oppor-
tunities for improvement. Sometimes the question, “How can we recover this
system?” gives people the opportunity to answer the question, “How can we

improve the existing system?” Be open to those opportunities because they’ll
come, sometimes in droves.
The types of testing that I discuss in this chapter are
 Paper tests
 Walkthrough tests
 Simulations
 Parallel tests
 Cutover tests
These tests range from the simple review of DR procedure documents to simu-
lations to running through procedures as if you’re experiencing the real thing.
Developing a test strategy
DR testing in all its forms takes considerable effort and time. To make the
best possible use of staff and other resources, map out a test strategy well in
advance of any scheduled tests.
Structure DR testing in the same way you structure other complicated under-
takings, such as software development and associated testing. Just follow
these steps:
1. Determine how frequently you should perform each type of test.
2. Test individual components.
3. Perform wider tests of combined components.
4. Test the entire plan.
When you perform DR testing as outlined in the preceding list, you can iden-
tify many errors during individual tests and correct those errors before you
do more comprehensive tests. This process saves time by preventing little
errors from interrupting comprehensive tests that involve a lot of people.
Virtually every enterprise that builds actual products performs testing as
outlined in the preceding list. Businesses have found this test methodology
to be the most effective way to ensure success in a reasonable timeframe.
Figure 10-2 shows the flow of DR testing.
219
Chapter 10: Testing the Recovery Plan

Developing and following test procedures
You’re probably anxious to get to testing, but you should know some proce-
dures that are vital for every type of test. Follow these basic steps for every
DR test:
1. Determine what you want to test and the type of testing you need to do.
Create a detailed list that includes every step of the disaster response
procedure so you can be sure to test each step and record the results.
2. Define and document explicit goals and objectives for each test.
Also determine success criteria.
3. Determine who will perform the test.
4. Schedule the test.
Confirm that the assigned person(s) are available at that time.
5. Make sure the assigned person(s) perform the test and record the 
test results.

6. If any part of the test was unsuccessful, you must correct the DR 
procedures and reschedule the test.
The preceding steps give you the minimum that you must do. If your organi-
zation does less for its DR plan testing, you risk a recovery effort failing when
it matters most, which can jeopardize the future of the organization.
Conducting Paper Tests
A paper test is usually the first type of test that you perform for a recovery 
procedure. A paper test is a review of disaster recovery procedures and other
response documentation, such as contact lists. In a paper test, individual staff
members review these documents on their own. Ask them to make annotations
or comments so you can verify the accuracy of a DR procedure, prior to 
performing tests that are more labor-intensive and complex.
The procedure for performing a paper test is fairly simple. Just follow 
these steps:
1. Assign staff members to perform the test.
The staff members you choose should range from subject matter experts
to near-novices. You never know who might be carrying out the procedure
in a real disaster!
2. Have these assigned people carefully review the recovery procedure.
They should read the procedure with a critical eye to verifying the facts,
as well as making sure the documents are clearly written.
3. Have the assigned people note, step-by-step, which items are correct
and which ones need changing.
They need to note errors that are factual in nature (for instance, the mis-
spelling of a command) and procedural in nature (for example, a missing
step). Also, ask for suggestions on how you can improve the procedure.
The assignees may use any internal or external reference materials they
need to confirm the accuracy and appropriateness of the test procedure.
4. Get the test results in writing, including the details that the tester
notes in Step 3.
5. Collect these results from all test subjects.
6. Give the results to the project manager or the person who owns the
procedure (probably the same person who wrote that procedure) so
he or she can revise and retest the procedure.
221
Chapter 10: Testing the Recovery Plan

The people who perform these tests should do so alone and at their own
pace. You have opportunities in walkthrough tests (which I talk about in the
following section) to have groups of people review procedures together.
Good recordkeeping is essential in DR plan procedure testing. Creating 
a plan for coordinating testing, issuing test assignments, gathering results,
and passing results back to document/procedure owners helps assure the
success of the DR plan.
After all the reviewers complete paper testing, and you make all revisions 
and carry out retests, you can advance the procedure to further testing, 
such as
 Paper tests in which you combine the procedure with others: For
example, you can combine a procedure for restarting a server with 
other procedures related to starting all the servers associated with 
an application.
 Walkthrough testing: See the following section for details.
Conduct paper tests periodically to make sure that they remain accurate over
time. I discuss the long-term schedule for DR plan testing in the section
“Establishing Test Frequency,” later in this chapter.
Conducting Walkthrough Tests
A walkthrough test is similar to a paper test — it’s a review of a written 
recovery procedure document. But you perform the walkthrough test with 
a group of experts, rather than a single expert working alone.
A walkthrough test takes place after you complete paper testing. Paper testing
eliminates many of the errors in the procedure, so the group reviews a much
higher quality procedure in walkthrough testing. You make the walkthrough 
a more valuable activity if you remove most of the errors before it takes place. 
A recovery procedure that’s rife with errors makes a walkthrough test a waste
of everyone’s time, slowing down the group and making the test less effective.
In a walkthrough test, the test participants discuss each step in the procedure.
In this group setting, participants talk their way through each step and decide
whether that step is properly worded, and they consider what happens in each
step. The ensuing discussion provides opportunities to find errors, as well as
opportunities to make improvements.
222
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

Walkthrough test participants
Who should participate in the walkthrough test? You need several parties:
 Facilitator: Someone with established facilitation and people skills who
has no vested interest in the outcome of the walkthrough. The facilitator
needs, um, facilitation skills — keeping the participants on track, making
sure the pace of the discussion is appropriate, and so on.
 Scribe: This person needs to take good notes throughout the walk-
through. These notes include things that went well and things that didn’t
go so well throughout the walkthrough.
 Business process owners: The people in the company who perform the
business process that the walkthrough focuses on. They’re usually famil-
iar with the workings of supporting applications, but they have a point of
view that’s quite different from IT developers and operations.
 Recovery team members: Staff members whom you select to perform
actual recovery operations if and when a disaster occurs.
 Subject matter experts: Staff members or outsiders who have expertise
in the processes or technologies related to the test.
 Auditors: In a regulated or audited organization, auditors can provide
valuable insight. The security and audit requirements for a business
process and its supporting application(s) aren’t relaxed during a disaster!
 Senior management: They provide invaluable big-picture insight when
they observe and participate in the walkthrough. Often, they know
about business matters that others might miss during a walkthrough.
Walkthrough test procedure
Follow these steps to perform a walkthrough test:
1. Identify the people you want to participate in the walkthrough.
2. Identify potential locations for the walkthrough.
You need a large and comfortable meeting room that can easily accommo-
date all the participants, as well as space for setting up and eating any
meals the group requires.
3. Estimate the length of time required for the walkthrough.
You usually need an entire day.
223
Chapter 10: Testing the Recovery Plan

4. Assign a facilitator and a scribe for the walkthrough.
I can’t overstate the importance of a scribe; when comments, issues, and
proposed changes to the DR plan arise, the scribe writes these down so
the plan can be updated later. Other people in the room may be too caught
up in the discussion to write down all of the issues.
5. Schedule the walkthrough.
Be sure that you allocate enough time for the test — half a day or more.
Arrange to provide one or more meals so people don’t have to interrupt
the walkthrough by leaving to eat.
6. Distribute the procedure to the walkthrough participants in advance.
7. Conduct the walkthrough (or let the facilitator lead the walkthrough).
During the walkthrough, the most important task — which the scribe per-
forms — is to record the results of the test: What went well, what didn’t go
well, and what changes you need to make in the procedure to ensure its
success. You most importantly need to discover dependencies — meaning
when a step in a procedure depends on an external item — and record the
details and issues regarding those dependencies.
8. Prepare the written results and feedback, and pass them to the
owner/creator of the procedure.
The owner/creator of the procedure should make any needed revisions
to the procedure.
Scenarios
The test facilitator — and possibly other walkthrough test participants —
needs to select one or more scenarios as the subject of the walkthrough.
Choose the scenarios from among the types of disasters that can actually
occur in the organization’s region. Possible scenarios include
 Severe storm: A severe storm could be a tornado, hurricane, cyclone, ice
storm, windstorm, or other storm that causes widespread transportation
and utility outages.
 Earthquake, volcano, landslide, or avalanche: Consider any of these
scenarios if they’re likely to occur in your region.
 Flood or tsunami: If your business is located in an area where these
events may occur, you can use them as a walkthrough test scenario.
 Utility outage: Human error or a natural event can cause a power or
communication outage lasting several days.
 Pandemic: A widespread illness can result in high rates of absenteeism
and government-mandated quarantines.
224
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

 Man-caused event: Can include civil unrest, strikes, acts of terrorism, 
or war.
 Other disruptions: Consider including scenarios such as building 
evacuations, corruption of a critical database, failure of a critical server, 
a large-scale network outage, and so on. One or more participants may
have experienced one of these events, which can help make the 
walkthrough more realistic and expose more issues.
Describe the scenario you choose in detail at the beginning of the walk-
through. Whoever reveals the scenario should describe its location, as well
as what impact the event has on the region. Include a description of damage
to the facility and which staff members are or aren’t available to help.
Using a real-life scenario puts a face on the walkthrough and makes it more
real. It may be easier to imagine a more realistic and likely scenario that can
get the adrenalin flowing. The participants have a greater sense of urgency
and concern because their own imaginations help them see the impact of a
real disaster and how an organization has to make a best effort to recover
critical business processes with few available resources.
Walkthrough results
At the end of the walkthrough, the facilitator should lead a discussion. He or
she should solicit from the participants examples of what went well and what
didn’t. Of course, the scribe should have written down these items as they
occurred, but in recounting the event, the participants can think about how
well the walkthrough went and how they could improve it.
Even if the walkthrough exposes serious deficiencies in the DR plan, you can
consider it at least a partial success if the participants identify areas you can
improve in the DR plan.
You may or may not need to re-perform the walkthrough. If the first walk-
through didn’t go well (which could happen for a variety of reasons), perhaps
you need to repeat the walkthrough after you update the procedures and any
supporting materials. If the first walkthrough resulted in only minor revisions,
you may not need to repeat it.
Properly record the results and details of all walkthroughs so you know the
status of each walkthrough and can note and record any required changes.
Debriefing
The team may want to conduct a debriefing session that takes place one or
more days after the walkthrough. The purpose of a debriefing is to discuss the
225
Chapter 10: Testing the Recovery Plan

results of the walkthrough, after the participants have had some time to ana-
lyze the results and perform any needed post-walkthrough research or number
crunching. The debriefing should include the facilitator, scribe, management,
and any senior managers or executive sponsors.
Depending on the size and complexity of the walkthrough itself, a debrief-
ing may range from very informal to highly structured. The debriefing 
needs a clear purpose and may range from extended discussions about 
procedures, results, and problems you ran into during the test to strategizing/
brainstorming.
Next steps
After you perform walkthroughs for all procedures in the DR plan and correct
all errors and discrepancies, the DR plan team can consider doing parallel
testing, in which response teams actually perform the recovery procedures
to see how well they work. I cover parallel testing in the section “Conducting
Parallel Testing,” later in this chapter. Also, consider simulation testing,
which I talk about in the following section.
You need to conduct walkthrough tests now and again. I cover test frequency
in the section “Establishing Test Frequency,” later in this chapter.
Conducting Simulation Testing
A simulation is more than a walkthrough (which I discuss in the section
“Conducting Walkthrough Tests,” earlier in this chapter), but it shares many
characteristics with a walkthrough. A simulation is basically an on-location
walkthrough test with props. Here are some relevant facts about simulations:
 A simulation’s setting is a credible and likely disaster scenario.
 Simulation participants are recovery team members.
 The simulation takes place in a designated emergency operations center
or a location resembling one.
 A simulation usually takes an entire day — maybe even two or three days.
 A well-orchestrated simulation usually takes weeks or months to plan.
Probably the most important characteristic of a simulation is that it’s highly
choreographed. Script the disaster scenario to take place over a period of
several hours. For instance, in a simulation that begins at 8:30 a.m., the mod-
erator issues a number of verbal and written statements at predetermined
times, such as the following:
226
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

 8:30 a.m.: Announcement of a nearby earthquake (tsunami, tornado, ice
storm, and so on) with a description of the immediately known damage.
 8:35 a.m.: Announcement of early reports of damage to roads, the
regional airport, and broadcast facilities.
 8:45 a.m.: Announcement that a ruptured natural gas pipeline is burning,
forcing mass evacuations and disrupting businesses and transportation
systems.
 9:00 a.m.: Announcements of specific public utility outages, transporta-
tion disruptions, and telecommunications outages.
As the disaster response team hears these announcements, they spring into
action, declaring a disaster and mobilizing resources. Design further announce-
ments to constrain their abilities and give them the feeling that these events
are actually occurring.
A simulation test is primarily a test of personnel — how they’ll respond and
take charge during a real disaster. A simulation reveals the characteristics 
of leadership, communication, cooperation, and creative thinking among the
disaster response team. The information you get from a disaster scenario
simulation can provide tremendous insight into the ways in which members
of the response team will conduct themselves during a real disaster.
Similar to a walkthrough test, a simulation test should have a scribe and a
facilitator, and it should include a post-simulation debriefing in which partici-
pants and senior management can discuss the simulation and its results.
Conducting Parallel Testing
The disaster recovery plan paper and walkthrough testing that I discuss 
earlier in this chapter takes place in the minds of the participants. Team
members discuss many details, but they don’t actually do anything. Paper
and walkthrough testing exercise the imaginations of the subject matter
experts who play various roles in the organization and in the DR planning
teams.
With parallel testing, disaster response personnel actually perform the steps
in their response procedures. When the procedures say build a server, the
personnel build a server. When the procedures say start the applications, the
personnel start the applications.
In short, parallel testing finds out if the disaster recovery plans actually work.
Well, almost.
227
Chapter 10: Testing the Recovery Plan

In a parallel test, the personnel who are actually delivering services to cus-
tomers continue doing so. IT systems that support those services continue 
to run. Customers who do business with the organization don’t see any 
difference because you make no real changes to the systems that support 
the services they use, but the disaster response personnel perform DR 
procedures as though a disaster had actually occurred.
A parallel test involves the use of recovery systems in parallel with primary
systems (hence the name!). The primary systems continue to support the
business.
Parallel testing considerations
Parallel testing is quite different than paper testing and walkthroughs. In 
a parallel test, bits actually flow through recovery systems, so you can get a
more reliable idea whether the DR plan will work in an actual disaster. You
need to take a number of considerations into account before performing a
parallel test:
 Do no harm to infrastructure. Don’t interrupt or interfere with existing
networks, systems, databases, and applications in a parallel test. Existing
systems still perform actual business and support existing business
processes that must continue.
 Do no harm to staff. Similarly, a parallel test may involve additional
employees working in the presence of staff members who are carrying
out their regular duties. Recovery test personnel must not interfere with
the real staff members.
 Acquiring replacement equipment. In some DR plans, you use systems
that the organization already owns as recovery systems. In others, the
organization must purchase recovery systems. For purposes of parallel
testing, you may need to alter the plans somewhat so those purchases
don’t actually happen. A viable alternative would be to lease the sys-
tems that you need for the duration of the parallel test.
 Side-by-side transactions. Depending on the nature of the business
process and IT systems you’re parallel testing, you may be able to run
some, or all, of the actual business transactions through both the actual
systems and the parallel test systems. The DR project team needs to
decide what criteria to use when determining which transactions to run
on the DR systems.
 Actual load or simulated load. The nature of the business might require
that you perform only a small portion of transactions to validate the test.
But for the test to be valid, the recovery system may need to take a full
workload, even if you run only dummy data through it. Testing may also
228
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

require both types of tests (small numbers of real transactions, plus a full
workload test) to validate the correct operation of the systems.
 External interfaces. Make the parallel test as much like the real produc-
tion system it’s mimicking as you can. But you need to simulate some
parts of the test so you can avoid certain undesirable events. For exam-
ple, if an application sends transactions to a bank or payment processor
for payment, you might want to avoid having the test system also transmit
those transactions, or else your organization incurs twice the number and
amount of payments. You may also need to apply this principle to other
internal applications.
 Make the test as real as possible. Despite all of the limitations I mention
in this list, the point of the parallel test is to determine if your DR plan
will work during a disaster. Consequently, leave the DR test personnel
alone to figure out the hard stuff. The procedures won’t be perfect, and
you should constrain the test personnel somewhat — and somehow —
so they can’t cheat by overcoming obstacles more easily than they
would be able to during an actual disaster.
Even with seemingly adequate precautions, things can go wrong with parallel
testing, which can interfere with ongoing business processes. But you can get
considerable benefits from parallel testing: Real-world experience in building
and starting recovery systems and running them through their paces to see if
they can support critical processes in a real disaster.
Although parallel testing is considerably more valuable than walkthrough
testing for validating plans, parallel testing falls short of actually supporting
critical business processes. Another activity, however, can erase all doubt as
to whether recovery systems can do the job — cutover testing. I discuss
cutover testing in the section “Conducting Cutover Testing,” later in this
chapter.
Next steps
After you successfully complete a parallel test, you should have a very clear
idea of how your response team and IT systems will respond in a real disas-
ter. The parallel test should provide you with information that you can use to
further improve recovery procedures.
You may want to carry out one or more simulations (see the section
“Conducting Simulation Testing,” earlier in this chapter) so you can better
understand how personnel will respond in a real scenario. And if you’re 
ready to climb higher into the rarified air of cutover testing, proceed boldly
to but plan thoroughly for this most comprehensive and challenging form of
disaster recovery testing, which I cover in the following section.
229
Chapter 10: Testing the Recovery Plan

Conducting Cutover Testing
Parallel testing, which I talk about in the preceding sections, gives you 
an opportunity to actually build recovery systems to find out if they can 
perform the type of activities you need to support critical business functions.
But parallel testing stops short of actually supporting those processes. If you
absolutely must know whether your recovery systems can support actual
business workload, consider performing a cutover test.
In a cutover test, the recovery team builds and readies recovery systems that
can support critical business functions. A cutover test is the real thing. If the
recovery systems don’t work, the business processes they support will really
be interrupted. That could be a real disaster!
Cutover testing is deadly serious business. It is, without a doubt, the DR 
test with the highest amount of risk. A cutover test is kind of like a heart-
lung bypass during open-heart surgery — the consequences of failure are
tremendous! However, the rewards are equally great: The positive outcome 
of a cutover test gives the organization a high degree of confidence that the
DR plan can assure the continued operation of critical business processes if 
a real disaster strikes. Walkthrough and parallel tests can’t provide the same
level of assurance.
You can usually perform a cutover test more easily than a parallel test for 
a number of reasons:
 No more simulations: In a cutover test, you don’t need to take special
care to stop certain things from happening, such as double transactions
to external systems. Managing these possible missteps is a tricky issue
in parallel testing, but it’s practically a no-brainer in cutover tests.
 No more double work: In a parallel test, you need to perform some
operations on both primary and recovery systems to validate and recon-
cile the proper operation of the recovery system. In a cutover test, you
have only one system performing transactions.
 Less human interference: Some operations in a parallel test may require
certain staff to perform their procedures differently for the sake of the
parallel test. In a cutover test, staff procedures are probably more like
their day-to-day routine than what they do during a parallel test.
Performing a cutover test is like jumping out of an airplane and betting that
the parachute (or the reserve ’chute) will work perfectly. Jumping out of a
perfectly good airplane can be pretty unnerving, and it can make you ques-
tion whether you did the right thing. One thing is certain, however — after
you begin, you’re committed!
230
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

Cutover test procedure
In a cutover test, you turn off (or disconnect) production systems and start
up the recovery systems, right? Well, maybe. Although you do need to per-
form full end-to-end testing, you may want to give yourself some accommoda-
tions so your testing doesn’t actually interrupt running business processes.
Suppose that a DR plan establishes a two-hour RTO (Recovery Time
Objective), which means you need to have recovery systems up and running
in less than two hours. Parallel tests may show that you can get those sys-
tems up and running in 90 minutes. But do you really want to interrupt run-
ning business processes for that long? Remember, this is a parallel test, not a
real disaster. Even for the sake of end-to-end DR testing, you may not want to
incur that much actual downtime. What you do in your cutover test depends
on the type of business you’re in and how much downtime executive manage-
ment is willing to endure for the sake of a test.
You may actually want to tell your customers and suppliers that you’re running
a cutover test because this announcement can give them confidence in your
organization — that you’re taking steps to remain operational in a disaster.
Why keep it a secret?
231
Chapter 10: Testing the Recovery Plan
Don’t let testing create a disaster
Typical cutover testing involves disconnecting or
shutting down primary systems and transferring
operations to recovery systems. This task isn’t
risk-free, and a number of things can go wrong:
 Inability to start recovery systems: Despite
practice, the DR team might run into an
unexpected problem and be unable to get
recovery systems running. If you’ve already
shut down or disconnected primary systems,
you could experience an outage of greater-
than-expected duration.
 Inability to start applications on recovery
systems: If the DR team can’t get applications
running on recovery systems, more down-
time could result.
 Inability to retain transaction data on recov-
ery systems: Cleanly transferring transactions
from system to system can be very compli-
cated in large, complex, or distributed appli-
cations. You may find maintaining transaction
integrity, particularly during cutovers, really
tricky.
Any of these scenarios can result in unplanned
downtime. Depending on the nature of the orga-
nization, this unplanned downtime may be crip-
pling. Perform thorough paper, walkthrough, and
parallel testing — and examine the test results
deeply and carefully — before you begin any
cutover test.

Assuming you don’t want to take a full hit on downtime during a test, follow
these steps to perform a cutover test:
1. Develop the entire cutover test plan and circulate it for review to a
wide audience of stakeholders and experts.
Include validation criteria that you can use later to determine whether
each step of the test was successful.
2. Brief the entire test team prior to the test so you can address any
remaining concerns.
3. Begin the test. Notify the team members that the test has begun and that
you need them to begin building and/or preparing recovery systems.
You may or may not take main production applications offline, depending
on whether executive management is willing to tolerate an actual outage.
4. After the team has prepared and readied the recovery systems, con-
figure those systems to assume full production workload.
5. Carefully observe the recovery systems, now actually supporting criti-
cal business processes, to ensure that they’re performing all functions
properly.
Also observe interfaces to other systems (whether internal or external)
to make sure those interfaces are also operating properly.
6. Carry out any specific test scripts or plans that you developed for the
test.
7. After you carry out all desired functions and tests on the recovery
systems, revert production workload back to the primary systems.
Note: You must work out a plan for transferring transactions back to pri-
mary systems so you can do the switch back smoothly. Primary systems
need to have full knowledge of transactions that the recovery systems
perform, as though the primary systems had actually performed those
transactions.
8. After the primary systems resume all duties, carefully examine the
recovery systems to ensure that they were in fact performing their
functions correctly.
Personnel participating in the parallel test, as well as all staff members
affected by the test, must report any unexpected results to the testing
team immediately.
9. The test team and test organizers need to fully document the proce-
dure, issues, and results of the test.
Compare test results with the validation criteria you develop in Step 1 
to determine whether each step of the test was successful.
232
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

10. Circulate the test report to a wide audience of stakeholders and other
personnel.
11. Debrief the test team to provide them an opportunity to discuss the
test and its results.
Valuable insights, when you document and act on them, can further
improve the quality of the DR plan and increase its effectiveness.
Cutover testing considerations
You need to address several issues long before you conduct a cutover test.
Some of these issues include
 Practice first: Test virtually all the tasks associated with building and
recovering an application prior to the cutover test. Before the test
begins, personnel should become familiar with the procedures that
they’ll carry out.
 Workload: Recovery systems must be able to handle the entire workload.
Don’t necessarily expect recovery systems to perform at the same level
as primary systems, however. Depending on the nature of the systems
you’re testing, you may need to perform volume testing and/or stress
testing to be sure that the recovery systems (and all of the supporting
infrastructure) can support workloads as expected.
 Reach-ability: Customers, users, suppliers, and other parties must know
how to reach your systems during a cutover test. Ideally, they’d access
your recovery systems in the same way they normally do, but the nature
of the applications you’re testing may influence this access.
 Notification and communications: Certainly, some staff know that you’re
performing the cutover test. But do you tell everyone in the organization
that the test will occur or is occurring? I don’t have easy answers for 
this question — the DR planning team needs to talk it out with senior 
managers or executives present.
 Transaction integrity: The recovery system needs to cleanly record the
transactions — or whatever the applications perform. At the end of the
test, transfer those records back to the primary system. The method 
and timeframe for transferring work done on recovery systems back to
primary systems depends on the nature of the applications and the
processes they support.
 Transaction source: Your application should know on which systems 
it performed transactions. That way, if something goes awry later, after 
a cutover test, you can figure out which system (primary or recovery)
performed a certain transaction.
233
Chapter 10: Testing the Recovery Plan

 Controls, regulations, audits, and security: If your organization is bound
by any regulations or audits that impose requirements on your systems
and applications, the systems must conform to those requirements at all
times. You can’t relax or set aside controls during any DR test. Auditors
and regulators aren’t likely to be compassionate on account of some
omission during a DR test. Make all regulatory, audit, and security
requirements and controls a part of the DR plan from the very start.
If cutover testing is starting to sound scary, that’s good! This type of DR testing
is very serious and should invoke fear because the risks of failure are great.
The rewards for success are even greater, however, so you should figure out
how to turn your fear into positive energy and proceed with intention.
Cutover tests have risks associated with them, and you must perform those
tests carefully. Properly planned, a cutover test can provide valuable insight
into the viability of an organization’s disaster recovery procedures.
Planning Parallel and Cutover Tests
Performing a parallel or cutover test requires a great deal of planning and
also a planner or project manager. If you don’t believe me, have a knowledge-
able person begin to write down all the tasks that you must perform before
the actual test takes place, all the tasks associated with the test itself, and
finally all the tasks that you must perform after you complete the test.
You need a project plan for several reasons:
 You need to do many tasks. Unlike walkthroughs, you have to do a lot of
things to get ready for a parallel or cutover test.
 Many tasks depend on other tasks. You can’t load the data until you
install the database, and you can’t install the database until you install
the operating system, and you can’t install the operating system until
you have a computer to install it on. So, on and on it goes — many tasks
depend on many others.
 All tasks require people. You can very easily build a project plan until
you have to assign people to the tasks in that plan. Most project managers
find that they have too few people for the job, which makes the job take 
a lot longer than originally expected.
 People are busy with other things. Staff members also have other
responsibilities; the project planner can find out how much time each
task takes and when people will be available to carry those tasks out.
 The project plan is the schedule. A thoroughly developed project plan
serves as the de facto project schedule. The project plan contains a list
of tasks, when those tasks are supposed to occur, and who’s supposed
234
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

to perform them. After you identify all the tasks, dependencies, and
resources, the project plan begins to become real. When you plug in
start dates, the dates for important milestones begin to have credibility
with the planning team and executives.
 You need to identify and resolve conflicts. Some of the milestones 
are going to conflict with other events that occur in the organization. 
You need to identify and consider significant events, such as heavy busi-
ness periods (retailers before holidays, for example) and fiscal month-, 
quarter-, and year-ends, so the cutover or parallel test can avoid the 
significant events in the business’s overall calendar.
 You need a way to measure progress. After you complete the project
plan and start the project, marking the completion of important mile-
stones gives you a good measure of progress.
 The plan can help identify costs. Although plans are task-oriented,
analysis of each task can give you information about hard costs (actual
dollars spent) and soft costs (such as extra time needed to perform
tasks) associated with each task. Costs that you can easily figure out
include hardware and software purchases; more difficult ones include
consultants and contractors, facilities rental, and so on.
 A solid plan helps to shape expectations. Senior management will 
certainly ask basic questions about the test — how long, how much, 
and who will do it. A well-developed plan can help you answer those
questions with confidence.
Clustering and replication technologies
and cutover tests
Environments that use clustering and replication technologies to establish
recovery systems usually can more easily perform cutover tests than organi-
zations that have systems that use manual cutover procedures. In local and
geo-clusters, the recovery systems are already running and, if you manage
them properly, already have the current application software and system
configuration.
In such environments, you can perform a cutover test nearly as simply as
executing a command on the recovery system’s cluster program that says,
“Make me the active server in the cluster.” Execute that command and voilà,
the passive recovery system now becomes the active system in the cluster,
processing real transactions, or whatever the application does to pass 
the time.
But if only it were that easy. Clustering and replication work closely together,
and they must, so applications can properly perform and record all transac-
tions, particularly those transactions that start on one system and end on
235
Chapter 10: Testing the Recovery Plan

another. If this book focused on clustering, transaction processing, and replica-
tion, I’d have entire chapters on each of the topics that I mention in this para-
graph. Someone in your organization must fully understand clustering and
replication, together with the intimate workings of the applications that run on
these technologies, so all your applications can work properly when the active
server in a cluster ceases to function in a cutover test or in a real disaster.
Next steps
In disaster recovery planning, it’s not over, even after it’s over! After a 
successful cutover test, an organization knows that it has the right stuff to
weather a real disaster. Make sure that you document all the notes, results,
and reports of the cutover test, debrief participants and management, and
put the next cutover test on the calendar.
If you focus your DR testing on technology, you might want to try a simula-
tion (discussed in the section “Conducting Simulation Testing,” earlier in this
chapter) to help you understand the human dynamic that plays out during a
disaster and has such a powerful influence on the success (or failure) of a
response team.
Establishing Test Frequency
After you complete your testing, you can just send everyone back to their
regular jobs, right? Well, yes — but not forever. Remember this constant of
business processes and IT systems: They’re always changing! The test plans
that worked last month might not work next month. Changes in processes
and IT systems have a direct impact on recovery procedures. Does that mean
you need to perform DR testing monthly? Well, not necessarily, but in some
cases, maybe.
The following factors may increase or decrease how often you need to test:
 Cost: The more a test costs, the less often you probably want to perform
that test.
 Risk: The risk of recovery failure in an actual disaster increases test fre-
quency so you can be sure that recovery operations will actually succeed.
 Frequency of change: In a business environment in which processes
and/or systems change frequently, you need to perform testing more 
frequently to keep up with these changes.
 Training: More testing makes recovery personnel more familiar with
recovery procedures, making a smooth and successful recovery more
likely.
236
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

 Customer or partner demands: Customers or partners may want
(within the context of a contract or not) more frequent testing so they
can be sure that the organization will survive a disaster and not disrupt
other organizations, preventing “your disaster becoming my disaster.”
 Regulation: Regulation may define test frequency in some industries or
locations in which laws or regulations require certain types of tests at a
minimum frequency, regardless of cost.
For most organizations, the following testing schedule will suffice:
 Paper tests: As often as procedures change
 Walkthroughs: Quarterly
 Parallel tests: Annually
 Cutover tests: Annually or biennially
Paper test frequency
Keeping DR procedures current is a chore, there’s no doubt about it. But the
further that recovery procedures diverge from the systems and processes
they support, the higher the risk that recovery procedures won’t work.
Wait — this isn’t just a sales pitch about maintaining recovery plans: It’s also
a pitch about testing frequently.
You need to perform paper tests as frequently as the recovery procedures
change. But that statement’s not really true, nor is it sufficient. You need to
review paper tests regularly — at least quarterly and maybe more often. The
periodic review of a recovery procedure serves two purposes: First, it helps
operations staff remain familiar with recovery plans by keeping them aware
of recovery procedures on the systems or processes they work every day.
Second, review of a recovery procedure may uncover the need for a recovery
procedure update.
Here’s an example of a procedure review triggering an update of that proce-
dure: An IT operations staff member reads through a recovery procedure that
discusses restoring data from tape backup. The staff member recalls that the
backup program was upgraded last month and that some of the user interface
(UI) elements have changed. If someone who’s a little less familiar with the
backup system became responsible for recovering backup data in a real disas-
ter, he or she might find the change in the backup program’s UI confusing, lead-
ing to errors and delaying system recovery and restart. Not good. So, the staff
member’s review of the recovery procedure, and his realization that it needs a
change, triggers upgrades to that recovery procedure.
237
Chapter 10: Testing the Recovery Plan

You should not, however, routinely identify changes by using procedure
reviews. At the same time, make sure all personnel associated with DR plan-
ning, training, and operations are alert to these types of little discrepancies
that can require minor adjustments.
The correct way to update procedures, by the way, is to make reviewing and
changing recovery procedures a part of the normal procedure for making
changes to business processes and IT systems. I cover the task of keeping DR
plans current in Chapter 11.
To keep people fresh and thinking about DR, review procedures monthly. 
If, however, you have so very many procedures that reading a department’s
entire recovery procedure would be too time consuming, review a different
portion of the entire procedure each month. You can then test different parts
of the procedure library every month — so it might take two, three, or even
six months to get through the entire library.
Walkthrough test frequency
When you perform paper tests, you’re tying up one person at a time. With
walkthrough tests, you’re corralling a lot of people at the same time, or so
you hope.
As I describe in the section “Conducting Walkthrough Tests,” earlier in this
chapter, walkthrough tests are community events. Group discussions with
experts helps to uncover issues that paper tests may have missed.
Given the rate of change in business processes and IT systems, you should
perform walkthroughs quarterly. You don’t have to organize a full caucus with
all the stakeholders from up and down the protocol stack every three months.
If systems haven’t undergone significant changes since the last walkthrough,
you may need only a smaller group to participate in the walkthrough. On the
other hand, if you have many new hands on deck, you may need to hold a
larger event to at least get the new people familiarized with your DR plan, 
in general, and the recovery procedures associated with the processes and 
systems they work with every day, in particular.
If you need some specific ideas for organizing walkthroughs, start with the
following and adapt them to your specific needs:
 First walkthrough — the big event: After you first develop the DR plan
for a given process or application, you need a large audience of partici-
pants to talk through every step and nuance of the recovery procedure
so you can make sure that the procedure is complete and accurate.
 Next two or three quarters — smaller events: As long as you don’t make
any major changes in systems or processes, you may need only a small
core team of participants to determine whether the recovery procedure is
still sufficient and identify little changes that you may need to make.
238
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

 New staff members: All new staff members, regardless of their place in
the process or system ecosystem (whether they’re likely to be on a disas-
ter recovery team), need to participate in the next walkthrough. Senior
staff need to indoctrinate newer staff members on details and insights
that may fall between the lines in a disaster recovery procedure.
 Changes to processes or systems: If the organization has made significant
changes to systems or processes, more people need to participate in the
next quarterly walkthrough — all those who designed changes, imple-
mented changes, and perform processes or operate systems under the
new changes.
 Major upgrade or system replacement: If you’ve overhauled a process,
or upgraded or replaced an IT system, a full-on walkthrough is called for.
Depending on the impact and scope of the change, you may want to wait
for the next quarterly walkthrough, or perhaps you need to conduct a
walkthrough before you finish the upgrade or replacement (or shortly
after you do). The precise schedule for a walkthrough test in an environ-
ment with major changes depends on many factors, especially risk. In
other words, can the organization afford to put in a new system and then
wait to do its first DR walkthrough, or is DR important enough to do the
walkthrough before the new system or process goes live?
 Tuning the frequency: If your environment is nearly static and you have
few major changes and low staff turnover, you could stretch out your
walkthrough schedule, perhaps to twice per year. On the other hand, if
you work in a high-risk environment (for example, ICU patient telemetry
or a building fire control system), you should conduct walkthroughs
more frequently than my suggested quarterly schedule. Frequent system
or process changes, as well as higher staff turnover, also favor testing
more often.
Parallel test frequency
Although parallel tests aren’t quite the real thing, they do give you an oppor-
tunity to walk the walk and see if the recovery system has what it takes to do
real work. Parallel tests are tricky and require a lot of coordination, but if you
never do them, it’s difficult to know whether your recovery systems will even
work in a real disaster.
Difficult as it sounds, an organization has to step up and perform parallel tests,
even if it doesn’t perform them often. How often you conduct these parallel
tests depends on many factors:
 Level of effort: You may want to bring in a lot of employees for a parallel
test. After all, it’s probably a rare event, and you want as many people as
possible to partake in the activity so they can learn from it. But such
testing begins to add up when you figure what other activities your test
participants don’t get done because of their involvement in the test.
239
Chapter 10: Testing the Recovery Plan

 Cost: Performing a parallel test might require some hard dollars for recov-
ery systems (if your plans call for purchasing recovery systems), consul-
tants (for their expertise or their two hands), and other incidentals.
 Risk: You have to look at risk from two perspectives — the risk of doing
the test (and what could possibly go wrong) and the risk of not doing 
the test. You need an experienced risk analyst to figure out the risks. The
answer won’t be a clean “Yes” or “No.” Instead, your analyst should give
you an answer more like, “Here are the things that could go wrong, and
here’s what you can do to reduce the risk somewhat.”
 Regulation: Ever the trump card, regulations in some industries and
locales require real DR tests, regardless of cost, risk, and effort.
If you still aren’t sure how often to perform parallel tests (or whether you
should perform them at all), try doing your parallel test one or two times per
year. Adjust this frequency up or down, depending on factors that only people
in your organization can know.
Your first parallel test probably takes far more effort and causes far more
pain than subsequent tests. Things you figure out in the first test can help
you improve the outcome for future tests.
Cutover test frequency
Cutover tests aren’t wholly unlike parallel tests: They require the involvement
of many staff members and managers, can disrupt business, and have risks
associated with them. Cutover tests are decidedly riskier than parallel tests
because of their disruptive nature — recovery systems get in the middle of 
critical business processes and support those processes (or try, anyway).
Depending on your processes, your architecture, and the type of business
you’re in, you may need to do only parallel tests and never do cutover tests.
But, probably, you do need to do cutover tests to make yourself more confi-
dent in your DR plans.
The arguments for doing cutover tests more, or less, frequently are the 
same as for parallel tests (which I talk about in the preceding section). It all
depends on effort, cost, risk, and regulation. Say you can do a cutover test
every one to two years. Working with the results from that test, you can then
assess the risks associated with your applications and what you use them 
for. If your application keeps heart-lung machines and patient telemetry 
running, you might run parallel tests every month (or even more frequently
than that!). However, if the applications do something nowhere near life-
critical or even business-critical, a lower frequency of testing may suffice.

C
hange is a constant force in organizations of all shapes and sizes.
Updates in technology, modifications to business processes, and other
changes prompt you to revisit and revise your DR documents, including you
Business Impact Analysis (BIA) and disaster recovery procedures. This chap-
ter can help you understand the types of changes you need to make to your
disaster response procedures and plans when changes in the business occur.
Speaking of changes, personnel changes often happen. People come, people
go, and people move around on the org chart (who reports to whom). These
new people in new roles require training and retraining to keep teams and
departments ready if a disaster occurs.
Understanding the Impact 
of Changes on DR Plans
By their nature, businesses are undergoing continuous metamorphoses.
Businesses change their business models, org charts, product and feature
sets, and SLAs (Service Level Agreements) as frequently as you change your
underwear.

In the following sections, I discuss the types of changes that occur in busi-
nesses and the impact those changes have on disaster recovery plans. I group
these changes into five categories:
 Technology changes: Upgrades or changes in software, hardware, 
and other technologies.
 Business changes: Changes in processes, mergers and acquisitions, 
and relocation.
 Personnel changes: Changes to the org chart, attrition, changes in
department and individual responsibilities, and so on.
 Market changes: Over time, you change the way you make and price
products or services, and your consumers change how they consume
and think of those products or services.
 External changes: Other events that occur outside of the business itself
that change your business’s risks in some way.
If you don’t think the preceding list was detailed enough, the following sections
put each of these areas under a powerful electron microscope. Remember not
to squint too long, or your eyes will hurt.
Technology changes
Paper tape gives way to punch cards, which reel-to-reel magtape displaces,
which yields to tape cartridges, and then optical media . . . technology just
marches on and on. Every step of the way, technology upgrades require revi-
sions to disaster recovery procedures. The following sections give you some
examples of technology changes.
Upgrades to IT systems
Changes at every layer in the stack (application, database, operating system,
and network) can mean you need to change DR procedure documents. Some
examples of such changes include
 Network devices and software: New routers, firewalls, load balancers,
and even just software upgrades.
 Server, storage, and tape library hardware: With new hardware, the
buttons are always in new places and the labels look a little different.
Are your DR procedures still accurate?
 Operating system (OS) change-outs or upgrades: If you change from one
OS to another, you need to rewrite your DR procedures. But even
upgrades may require edits to procedures if command options or other
OS procedures have changed.
242
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

 Changes or upgrades in higher layers: Such as in the database manage-
ment system (DBMS) or application server. It seems like change is the
only constant, which means you need to make changes to your disaster
recovery procedures. Will it ever end?
 Media changes: Whenever backup media, archival media, or software
release media change, you may also need to change the procedures for
recovering systems.
Introduction of new IT technologies
New technologies are rolling in all the time — from USB tokens to optical
media to biometrics. Whenever you incorporate any of these new technolo-
gies into an application or infrastructure, you probably need to change your
recovery documents.
Business changes
Senior managers and executives in organizations sometimes make decisions
that have a moderate-to-profound impact on the entire business. These range
from changes in existing business processes to more significant changes such
as mergers and acquisitions, outsourcing and insourcing, and changing busi-
ness locations. All of these changes require you to review DR documents on
some level to make sure they’re still relevant and accurate.
Business process changes
Organizations change their processes with frightening regularity. The trouble
is, some businesses make these changes subconsciously — meaning the busi-
nesses don’t plan the changes, they happen spontaneously and aren’t well 
documented or communicated. On the other hand, many organizations have 
a process for changing processes, so hopefully the process-change process (the
process for changing processes) includes a step to review and edit disaster
recovery procedures.
Mergers and acquisitions
A merger (when two businesses become one) or an acquisition (when one busi-
ness purchases another) can upset the boat like few other changes can. When
a merger or acquisition occurs in an organization, priorities can suddenly
change or go sideways. The ramifications include
 Highly critical business processes may become less critical.
 Business processes previously considered not critical may suddenly
become critical.
 Processes may alter.
243
Chapter 11: Keeping DR Plans and Staff Current

 Processes often combine.
 Sometimes, your business scraps a process in favor of a similar process
in the acquiring (or acquired) business.
 A merger or acquisition wreaks havoc on org charts. (I discuss these
types of changes in detail in the section “Personnel changes,” later in
this chapter.)
 Business or personnel often relocate.
 IT applications face big changes — winning applications survive and
losers get scrapped.
 The new organization may place more value on disaster recovery, 
changing all the results in the Business Impact Analysis (BIA).
An organization that undergoes a merger or acquisition should consider
revisiting its BIA to reevaluate the MTD (Maximum Tolerable Downtime), RTO
(Recovery Time Objective), and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) figures relat-
ing to post-merger/acquisition processes. You may have different priorities
and thresholds in the new organization. Newly placed executive management
may also have new opinions on the importance of disaster recovery.
Changes in business locations
Businesses that change their business locations may have a few — or many —
changes that require a review of disaster recovery procedures. If a business 
is moving a short distance, make changes to the procedures just to reflect
changes in the physical environment. But if your business moves a significant
distance, you may need to change some of its suppliers (such as off-site media
storage), as well as some of its technical architecture. (Moving gives you a
good excuse to make changes to processes, which translates into changes in
recovery procedures.)
Outsourcing and insourcing
When a part of an organization transitions from insourced functions to out-
sourced functions (or vice versa), you must change any DR plans related to
the part of the organization that was insourced or outsourced. Here are some
examples of outsourcing changes that require consideration:
 Newly outsourced function: If you have a DR plan for this function, the
business needs to coordinate the development of recovery procedures
with the new service provider.
 Newly insourced function: If you need a DR plan for an insourced func-
tion, develop new recovery procedures and train staff in the organization
on those procedures.
244
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

 Changes in dependencies: Sometimes, a process’s big picture changes
in a way that alters dependencies on internal or external resources. For
instance, if the DR plan for a process depends on the services provided
by a department that’s now outsourced (or insourced), you need to
change the recovery plans to accommodate the changes introduced by
the outsourcing or insourcing.
I don’t have any magic formulas for how you need to change DR plans when
insourcing or outsourcing occurs. You need to carefully analyze all affected
business process and recovery plans, and make adjustments that permit the
DR plans to work, even after the business makes the insourcing or outsourcing
changes.
If your business switches an outsourcing partner, revisit any DR plans associ-
ated with the process(es) performed by that partner to make sure the services
provided by the new partner are still compatible with existing DR plans.
Personnel changes
Organizations fire, hire, and rearrange their workforces on an almost daily
basis. It’s no wonder that companies don’t publish their org charts as often as
they used to: By the time the chart’s printed, it requires another update. These
types of changes have a bearing on DR planning, as I discuss in the following
sections.
Organization chart changes
Even if no one leaves your organization and you don’t bring anyone in, just
changing the command and control structure may have some — perhaps 
a significant — impact on disaster recovery plans. Here are some examples 
(as told by a department manager):
 That’s not my department’s job any more. The experts who wrote dis-
aster recovery plans and manned the recovery teams may suddenly be
unavailable. You need to train new staff members, and you may have to
edit the DR procedures.
 They took my staff away. See the preceding bullet.
 That’s my function now. The opposite of the preceding bullets. A manager
is newly responsible for a function covered by the DR plan. Your staff may
need training, at least, and you may need to change your DR procedures
to accommodate the staffing changes and possible process changes that
result from the change in responsibility.
245
Chapter 11: Keeping DR Plans and Staff Current

 That dependent function is now out of my control. Processes always
have dependencies. A team that previously handled the DR plan for a
business process is now split up. Can the former team still function as 
a team? Management needs to discuss these changes and what you need
to change (if anything) in DR plans and procedures.
At the risk of sounding preachy, I want to say to managers at every level when
facing the challenges of the reorganization of the month: Be responsible and
figure it out. No one said it would be easy.
Relocation of key employees
Relocation involves an employee moving to a different town or city. To be
more specific, one or more key personnel whom you depend on in a disaster
situation now lives 20, 50, or 100 miles away. In a disaster, such personnel may
not be able to travel this distance to be on-hand as part of a recovery team.
In the best-case scenario, you simply need to train personnel who live closer
to business locations. In the worst case, you don’t have any suitable trainees
who live close enough to be there when a disaster strikes — a problem with-
out an easy solution. Maybe you need to offer that employee who moved
away more money to live closer, or perhaps you can hire another expert who
lives close by (and hope he or she doesn’t move away). Those pesky employ-
ees, always making life decisions that don’t put work ahead of other consider-
ations! (I’m kidding, of course — your employees are your most valuable
resources.)
Telework
Technology and changing business attitudes have led to people living further
and further away from their places of work, and many work permanently from
home. This shift especially applies to information workers who are technically
savvy and can use technology effectively from any location, whether in the
office or hundreds of miles away.
Having access to the wider community of gifted workers can make finding new
talent easier, and you can hire that talent without requiring that they live within
a short drive of your business location. But the telework equation can go awry
during a disaster. For many reasons, you may need those workers all on-site
when disaster strikes — but if half of them live out of town, fat chance of that!
This situation does have an up side: If a regional disaster strikes your business
location, many of your local employees may be wrapped up in the disaster,
caring for family members or just trying to keep their belongings safe. But 
your out-of-town teleworkers may be unaffected by the disaster (because 
they live far enough away, out of the disaster zone), so they don’t have any of
the disaster-related distractions keeping them from working. As long as your
246
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

business has enough infrastructure still working (such as VPN/remote access
and telecommunications), your teleworkers can keep on working over the wire.
They can carry out their usual duties, and perhaps they can even perform most
or all of the procedures in a disaster recovery plan.
Staff attrition
It’s a fact of life — people come and people go. You need to periodically train
new personnel on disaster recovery procedures. Attrition can cause real prob-
lems if you no longer have any subject matter experts who can perform critical
recovery functions. Smaller organizations that have only one expert in several
subject areas can really suffer from such an extended absence. For this reason
(and many other reasons), make your disaster recovery procedures highly
detailed so non-experts can carry them out without fear of making deadly
assumptions or mistakes.
Market changes
Whatever your business does, the market is always changing. Products and
services grow and change, and the dynamics of the production of your com-
pany’s goods and services never stand still. Sometimes, these changes are
profound enough that your BIA results change, which impacts MTDs, RTOs,
and RPOs, all of which can change your recovery procedures. The following
sections look at some of these factors.
New production or delivery methodologies
The ways in which businesses such as yours develop and deliver goods and
services change slowly over time, and sometimes bigger, more disruptive
changes radically influence how you do what you do. Here are some examples:
 Increased outsourcing: As a flanking move, one competitor outsources
a part of its operation to save costs, and other competitors follow suit to
retain competitive parity. Outsourcing critical functions has a profound
effect on DR plans and who carries them out.
 More efficient production or delivery: Innovation sometimes introduces
new methods that make the production or delivery of products and ser-
vices more efficient. Innovation changes the entire cost (and, often, pric-
ing) structure for an organization, which in turn affects all of the MTD,
RTO, and RPO formulas, affecting your overall BIA results.
These kinds of changes sometimes occur slowly, and at other times, quickly.
Sometimes, you don’t recognize them until well after the fact. Revisit the 
BIA every year or two, or more often in rapidly changing industries, just to
make sure that the numbers still support the level of DR planning and testing 
activities currently taking place.
247
Chapter 11: Keeping DR Plans and Staff Current

New competitors and changes in market share
Every time a competitor enters or leaves a market, or when any given organi-
zation has a significant change in market share, the economics of production
and delivery change. These changes can greatly influence MTD, RTO, RPO,
and BIA formulas and results.
Supply-chain changes
In complex business ecosystems, changes such as innovations, big price
swings, or sea changes among partners or suppliers can profoundly influence
your own business operations. For example, consider a big rise in energy
costs due to hurricanes disrupting oil production and the ripple effect that
those price increases have on many industries.
Sometimes, this influence is big enough to force you to revisit your BIA, 
MTD, RTO, and RPO figures. Sometimes, the changes increase the need for 
DR response capabilities, but at other times, those changes decrease the 
pressure to respond quickly to a disaster.
External changes
An entire class of changes can take place outside of the business. These kinds
of changes can influence risk (up or down) or impact recovery procedures. 
The following sections by no means give you a complete list; other events and
situations can also affect your DR plans and procedures.
Nearby construction
Major construction projects that take place near your business premises may
change your business’s risks in some way. For instance, if a factory is built
nearby that handles hazardous materials, the chances that you may need 
to evacuate your own premises increases somewhat. If a new freeway is con-
structed near your business, you may have better transportation options,
which may improve regional transportation capabilities during a disaster. 
If a facility that provides or promotes controversial services is built next
door, you have an increased chance of nearby protests or civil unrest. Or, 
if that gasoline pipeline that passes your business is aging, a gas pipeline 
rupture and fire may soon happen too close to your business. Changes in
nearby businesses may also affect crime rates.
Utilities changes
Changes in power grids, telecommunications, and natural gas delivery affect
your organization. Over time, electric power and telecommunications may
become less effective because of aging facilities, resulting in more frequent or
lengthier outages.

Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

Regulation
It may take just one significant event to motivate the government to pass a
new law. Sometimes, these regulations indirectly influence your DR plan by
changing the fundamental economics of businesses in a particular location or
sector. These changes can, in turn, influence your DR plans.
Political events
Changes in local, regional, and national government leadership sometimes
result in big changes in certain industries — some favorable and some not so
favorable. The fortunes of businesses large and small sometimes hinge on
elections and other political events. If I haven’t struck a chord with you, per-
haps your organization is immune to the political winds that blow. But will it
always be?
Disasters
Besides the obvious and immediate effects on a business, disasters some-
times have longer-term effects in a region. Often, local or regional govern-
ment invests in infrastructure that can better withstand future disasters.
Sometimes, the changes that take place affect building codes and may even
require your business to retrofit your safety systems.
Some of these changes can help a business by reducing the impact of future
disasters, but they can also raise costs directly or indirectly.
Changes — some final words
Some changes, such as technology changes, require only changes in disaster
recovery procedures. Other changes, such as mergers and acquisitions, are
so profound that you must redo the entire Business Impact Analysis (BIA) to
recalibrate business priorities.
I don’t have a magic way to classify changes as big or small. But if your orga-
nization has instituted a DR plan steering committee, that group should make
those judgments if and when needed. When the events discussed in this sec-
tion occur, whoever in the organization has overall management responsibil-
ity for DR planning needs to enact reviews of BIAs, RTOs, RPOs, MTDs, and
recovery procedures. These documents and figures probably won’t get up on
their own and begin updating themselves. Someone high up in the organiza-
tion’s management structure must have his or her finger on the pulse of the
entire organization so the events discussed here can precipitate proper
reviews in disaster planning and response.

Chapter 11: Keeping DR Plans and Staff Current

Incorporating DR into Business 
Lifecycle Processes
Organizations use processes as a part of introducing changes into their
processes. Yes, that was a recursive statement — using processes to change
processes. More mature organizations use a specific set of procedures when
making changes to its business processes.
But only some businesses consciously realize that they actually use a process
to modify their processes. Many organizations change their processes 
spontaneously and without a lot of planning or analysis.
Regardless of whether your organization effectively manages its processes,
consider the impact of every process change on your DR plan, and vice versa.
The following sections discuss three areas of lifecycle processes:
 Systems and services acquisition
 Systems development
 Business process engineering
When you make disaster recovery planning a part of these key processes,
you make the organization naturally more proactive by including disaster
recovery planning as a part of doing business, rather than as an add-on.
Systems and services acquisition
When an organization considers the acquisition of a new IT application or
service provider, you need to devote a lot of thought and planning to ensure
that the organization chooses the right application or service. Make sure the
application or service has the right features and configurations that can meet
your organization’s needs.
Keep this key point in mind, particularly during the decision-making process
for a new application or service: The application or service needs to support
the needs of the business process(es) that it supports, not the other way
around. Often, an organization makes a poor choice by selecting an applica-
tion or service that doesn’t meet the needs of the business; as a result, the
business has to change its processes — sometimes in significant ways — so 
it can use the application or service.
250
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

DR planning is, first and foremost, a business activity in which business deci-
sion makers identify the most important business processes and how quickly
the business must recover those processes if a disaster interrupts them. After
you identify these key items (primarily your Recovery Time Objectives, or
RTOs), the business needs to make all necessary changes to processes and IT
systems to support those objectives.
Similarly, when the organization considers purchasing an application or 
service that supports a critical process, make sure the application or service
meets established recovery needs. If you apply this principle to the systems
and services acquisition process, whenever you acquire a new application or
external service, you’re on the right path to ensure that you can achieve your
established DR objectives, particularly Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and
Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs).
Meet these objectives in the systems and services acquisition process by
incorporating your DR requirements into the complete set of requirements
that you submit to each potential vendor. Then, when the vendors respond 
to each requirement, you know which vendors are more likely to deliver what
you need. I discuss the development of requirements and standards in the
section “Establishing DR Requirements and Standards,” later in this chapter.
Systems development
Although the trend for software and systems development has leaned heavily
towards acquiring applications, many organizations still opt to build some
business applications themselves. Also, many organizations still use applica-
tions that they developed in the past (as long as a decade or more ago).
Organizations that purchase COTS (common off-the-shelf) applications still
need to develop custom software so these applications can communicate with
each other. Many organizations develop customizations for COTS applications
so they can get needed custom reports or analytical databases that the
applications themselves don’t provide.
Whenever your organization embarks on new software development —
whether for a complete application, or for customization or integration 
purposes — you need to make many decisions so the resulting software meets
the organization’s needs. Those needs include hardware and software stan-
dards, security and privacy, and disaster recovery.
Often, DR standards are manifested through standards for hardware, soft-
ware, database, and application. This helps to ensure that any new applica-
tions run on systems for which the organization has already developed
251
Chapter 11: Keeping DR Plans and Staff Current

resilient architectures and recovery processes. For instance, if an organiza-
tion has developed product standards such as Sun, Solaris, and Oracle for
applications that require DR capabilities, the organization can more easily
recover any additional applications, customizations, or integrations that also
run on Sun, Solaris, and Oracle by using existing DR plans and procedures.
I discuss the development of specific requirements and standards in the 
section “Establishing DR Requirements and Standards,” later in this chapter.
Business process engineering
Whether they use a formal lifecycle and methodology, or make spontaneous
changes, organizations exercise some level of discipline in their practices of
business process engineering (BPE). I’ve been in organizations at both ends
(and in the middle) of the discipline-and-formality spectrum. Generally speak-
ing, organizations that are newer or smaller tend to make process changes
more spontaneously, without fully considering the consequences of the
changes that they make. Probably the only advantage of living on the low end
of the process maturity spectrum is that you can make changes quickly — 
even instantly! But, oftentimes, those changes have unintended and unwanted
consequences that you discover later on.
Towards the formal and disciplined end of the spectrum, organizations 
spend more time analyzing, planning, and designing their business processes.
Organizations that spend more time planning tend to have processes that
better meet their needs. The downside to this level of discipline is that it takes
more time to make changes in business processes. Some organizations can
spend so much time analyzing changes that they never seem to actually make
any changes. I like to call this phenomenon analysis paralysis.
Business process engineering is similar to software development: Done right,
both have lifecycle processes that include concept, requirements, design,
testing, implementation, and maintenance.
I emphasize the requirements part of business process engineering in this sec-
tion. Simply put, when you develop requirements, you first need to write down
all the necessary characteristics of a business process before you design and
implement the process. Or, if you have an existing business process that needs
changes, you still apply the requirements, making sure that changes still 
support those requirements.
Any time you develop or modify business processes, you must carefully ana-
lyze the consequences of the new or changed process. Business processes
need to support business policies about security, privacy, and disaster recov-
ery. Establish new and existing processes in such a way that you can recover
and restart them during a disaster, possibly working with only inexperienced
252
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

personnel. Thoroughly document the processes themselves, as well as all the
procedures and tasks in them, and include recordkeeping tasks.
Establishing DR Requirements 
and Standards
Creating a library of formal requirements for IT development and procurement
projects can really drive consistency into an organization’s technical environ-
ments. Companies often develop such requirements in several categories,
including the following:
 Hardware: Using computing hardware from as few vendors as possible
reduces support costs.
 Operating system (OS): Basing everything on a common OS standard per-
mits an organization to support more systems with fewer IT support staff.
 Database: Common database standards permit an organization to manage
all of its corporate data as a more cohesive whole, not as separate, 
disconnected islands.
 Application services: Centrally managing functions such as authentica-
tion, messaging, and audit logging helps to streamline application 
management.
 Network protocols: Common routing, messaging, and management 
protocols simplify network architecture and management.
 Service layer: A distributed computing service layer, such as Service-
Oriented Architecture (SOA), facilitates integration between applications.
 Application components: Common environments based on Rich
Internet Application (RIA) technologies, such as AJAX, Adobe Flex, and
Silverlight, can improve the user experience by making the application
more visually appealing or easier to use.
And, starting in recent years, organizations are developing requirements and
standards in two new areas:
 Security: Common security protocols, programs, and devices make 
protection and security management simpler than if different parts of 
an enterprise use disparate features and products.
 Privacy: Common means and methodologies within applications, data-
bases, and operating systems for protecting employee and customer 
private information.
253
Chapter 11: Keeping DR Plans and Staff Current

Organizations that realize the need for consistency in their environments
for disaster recovery purposes can add a new category of requirements
and standards:
 Disaster recovery: DR requirements and standards should include the
selection of certain brands and technologies for new IT systems. The
organization can then easily incorporate these new environments into
existing DR plans without having to develop new procedure sets for
each related technology.
Requirements and standards should lower support costs by driving the 
organization toward a more consistent environment, in which IT systems and
applications use common standards, protocols, and technologies. This same-
ness provides a lower TCO (total cost of operations), making it easier for the
organization to bring DR capabilities to more applications.
Without common standards and requirements, an organization’s IT environ-
ment would resemble a computer museum that has one of everything. You’d
need complete and separate sets of skills, procedures, DR plans, and support
contracts for each system. I don’t know many organizations that have that
much money to spend on their systems.
A Multi-Tiered DR Standard Case Study
In this section, I describe a moderately complex DR standard that a hypothet-
ical organization, a relatively large enterprise that has a multitude of IT sys-
tems and a mature DR plan, develops. In honor of one of my favorite cartoon
characters, I call this organization Acme Enterprises — or Acme, for short.
Acme has many dozens of IT applications that support its various critical
business operations. Acme has performed many Business Impact Analyses
and has developed several DR architectures over the years.
Acme settled on three sets of technology standards that it aligns with its RTO
and RPO (Recovery Time Objective and Recovery Point Objective) groupings.
Acme establishes its standards as follows:
 Tier 1 DR standard: The highest resilience that provides the fastest
recovery time, almost immediate
 Tier 2 DR standard: Provides recovery time measured in hours
 Tier 3 DR standard: Provides recovery time measured in days
The three standards in the preceding list align with the three levels of recov-
ery requirements that support virtually all business functions that require DR
support.
254

Table 11-1 describes the three DR standards established by Acme in more
detail.

Business requirements drive Acme’s DR standards, specifically its RTO and

ting their technology and DR capabilities define business requirements).
255
Chapter 11: Keeping DR Plans and Staff Current

Systems that meet Tier 1 SR standards support Acme’s most critical business
processes. Acme has written a common set of DR procedures for Tier 1 sys-
tems; those procedures for recovering servers and data are virtually identical
for all Tier 1 applications.
Similarly, systems that meet either Tier 2 or Tier 3 standards support Acme’s
important (but not critical) business processes. And like Tier 1, the recovery
procedures for Tier 2 are practically identical to each other, as are the Tier 3
recovery procedures. In fact, the only variants in the recovery procedures
within any of the three tiers are those steps specific to individual applica-
tions. The recovery procedures within each tier at the hardware, operating
system, and database management layers are identical.
Acme developed a three-tier DR standard, instead of using just one standard
(the Tier 1 standard) and making all systems that need disaster recovery 
conform to it, mainly because of cost. Building Tier 1 systems costs more 
than Tier 2 or Tier 3 systems because Tier 1 systems include clustering and
mirroring components (which add costs). Systems that you can recover in
days rather than minutes don’t need to have the same expensive components
that Tier 1 systems need to produce their near-real-time recovery. Acme has 
a lot of applications that require varying levels of recoverability, and it made
sense to stratify DR needs into the three standards that they developed. This
standards structure made documentation and training far easier than if each
system had its own unique recovery procedures, RTOs, and RPOs.
Developing business-driven standards not only provides consistency that
lowers TCO (total cost of operations), the organization also gets disaster
recovery capabilities that actually meet business needs.
Maintaining DR Documentation
The consummation of disaster recovery planning is the completed disaster
recovery plan and recovery procedures. Those written documents are the
culmination of a great deal of effort that has a single purpose — the survival
of the organization in the face of a disaster.
In the following sections, I discuss many facets of DR documents, including
 How to manage documents
 How to update documents
 How to publish and distribute documents
Many people look at documentation as a necessary but altogether evil pastime.
Although it may be mundane at times, it’s the central fixture of disaster recov-
ery planning. You have to get it right because the survival of your organization
depends on it!
256
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

Managing DR documents
Document management is a lifecycle proposition. Given the document-centric
nature of disaster recovery planning, you need to keep those DR documents
locked up safe and allow only authorized and qualified individuals to touch
them. Seriously — treat high-value documents such as Business Impact
Analyses (BIAs) and DR procedures as reverently as software source code.
Protecting DR documents
Protect the official DR source documents so only authorized people can
access them. Ideally, you should keep them in a vault — a database that’s a
part of a document management system. Authorized people must identify
themselves by logging in before they can perform any operations on any DR
documents.
Managing official DR documents
You need to manage official DR documents, including Business Impact
Analyses, DR procedures, and many more, through manual or automated
means. The document management process should include these basic 
functions:
 Check out: When someone needs to make changes to a document, they
first have to check out the document from the doc management system.
After someone checks out a document, the doc management system
optionally blocks others from checking out the same document until the
person who first checked it out returns it. Whether you program the doc
management system to block others from checking out the document is
a policy decision that you make when you set up that system.
 Review: When a person makes changes to a document, he or she can
circulate it for review by others in the organization. A full-featured doc
management system may handle this review automatically, capturing
comments and perhaps even proposing changes.
 Check in: After the document author receives and incorporates com-
ments from others, he or she can finalize the document and check it back
in to the system. When a person tries to check in a document, most doc
management systems query that person for several pieces of information:
• Change reason: A few words describing the change, such as ERP
Upgrade or Migration to Hitachi SAN.
• Change description: A longer description of the change — a couple
of sentences.
• Author: Name of the person who made the change, usually the
person checking in the document.
257
Chapter 11: Keeping DR Plans and Staff Current

• Version number: Some document management systems create 
and increment version numbers automatically, others don’t.
• Approved by: The name of the person or group who approved 
the changes.
• Reviewed by: The name of the person(s) who reviewed the 
document.
 Update: Sometimes tied to check in, an update causes a newly checked-in
document to become the new official document. You can think of updating
as a make current function that identifies a version of a document as the
official version.
 Version history: A function that permits the user (not just anyone, but
someone authorized to access the document management system) to
view information about each prior version of a document.
 Retrieve older version: Doc management systems permit an authorized
user to retrieve an older version of a document.
Doc management systems have many other functions associated with the
management of documents under their control. The preceding list describes
only the common functions that these systems use.
If your organization doesn’t have a formal document management system,
you can perform these steps manually by storing versions of documents on 
a file server and using spreadsheets or other means for tracking document
activities such as check ins, check outs, and updates.
Document content
Any official documentation should have a consistent style and appearance, 
DR documentation included. Elements such as headers, footers, versions, and
modification history are all vital to the integrity of DR documents. I discuss
this topic fully in Chapter 9.
Updating DR documents
When you make the decision to update a DR document, you assign someone
to actually perform this task.
Updating a DR procedure involves more than just editing the changes into the
document. The document editor needs to perform some tasks, or read
system or process documentation, to understand exactly how to change the
content in the procedure. He or she might need to test the procedure on a
test system to make sure the document describes the procedure accurately.
He or she might need to include screen shots and other actions for clarity.
258
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

In terms of the actual document editing, the word processing program will
need to be configured to show the changes made to the document. In Microsoft
Word, this feature is called Track Changes; in FrameMaker, it’s called Track
Edited Text. This important feature permits reviewers (either other staff 
members or outsiders) to easily see precisely what changes have been made 
to a document. This is an example of a sentence that’s been added. This 
sentence has been removed.
Highlighting changes that are made to a document does have a disadvantage:
Reviewers might focus too much on the changes and lose sight of the entire
procedure. Document reviewers need to understand their responsibilities
and know that they’re checking not just for grammar, but for accuracy. And
who knows — they might even be the ones who perform the procedure in an
actual disaster!
When the document editor finishes making changes to the DR document, he or
she can perform whatever check-in and updating tasks your organization uses.
After changes have been made to a DR procedure, you may need to test that
procedure. Someone in the organization needs to track these updates and
make decisions about when you need to test the recovery procedure if signifi-
cant changes are made. A DR program doesn’t run itself — it needs some
management oversight so important activities don’t fall through the cracks.
Set up a document review calendar that includes some sort of reminders 
for staff members to review documents in the DR library. Here’s a suggested
calendar for review:
 Emergency contact lists — monthly: Attrition and organization changes
may happen frequently enough that you need to work hard to keep
these lists fresh. Sometimes, people simply change their office, mobile,
and home phone numbers, as well.
 Recovery procedures — quarterly: Little and big changes in applica-
tions and supporting environments may affect the accuracy of recovery
documents.
 Architecture documents — quarterly: Document changes in application
and infrastructure architecture so recovery personnel can become 
familiar with the architecture supporting each application’s native 
environment.
 Business Impact Analysis (BIA) — annually: Changes in business 
priorities and market conditions may influence recovery objectives,
such as your Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point
Objective (RPO).
259
Chapter 11: Keeping DR Plans and Staff Current

Publishing and distributing documents
After you update DR documents, particularly recovery procedure documents,
key personnel need to know about these changes.
For most ordinary documents, you simply update the document and make 
it available via your business’s customary means (a file server or portal, 
for instance). But DR documents, especially procedures, aren’t ordinary 
documents. You need to do more than simply publish them and let people
download them at their leisure. The following sections explain.
Registered users
Send all disaster recovery documents’ updates to all registered users via
e-mail or whatever means are right for your organization.
Disaster recovery procedure documents (as well as others that I mention in
the following list) are so important that members of recovery teams need to
have their own soft copies and maybe even hardcopies.
Someone needs to actively manage the list of recovery team members 
and others who need the newest versions of recovery procedures and other
documents. Tracking users is tedious and mundane, but the survival of the
organization may depend on it.
Here are the documents that you need to publish and send to registered users:
 All recovery procedure documents: ’Nuff said.
 Updated architecture documents: Descriptions and diagrams about how
individual applications, networks, systems, and the entire environment is
put together and how it works.
 Emergency contact lists: Essential for all recovery personnel, particularly
in disasters in which communications are affected.
 Communications procedures: If the DR team has developed procedures
for emergency communications, you need to keep this document fresh
and in everyone’s hands.
 Wallet cards: If you maintain wallet cards with essential contact info,
you must send new versions with updated names and contact info to
registered users whenever you update those cards.
 Indexes to more documents: The organization needs to maintain copies
of documentation that hardware and software vendors produce so recov-
ery teams can have easy access to product manufacturers’ documenta-
tion, even during a disaster when communications may not be so good.
260
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

Recordkeeping
Keep detailed records about all document updates, including the individual
names of people who send hardcopies (or CD-ROM, or whatever form) to
whom and when. These and other records that an organization’s DR program
produce are vital, and you must care for them well. Keeping accurate records
helps to ensure that DR documents are well managed and distributed to all
the right people. Ensure that these records are always up to date, accurate,
and available to everyone who’s authorized to access them by using good
document management practices, as well as security and backups.
Training Response Teams
You may have noticed that this section is short, and I have a good reason for
it. But I’m not going to give the secret away just yet. You need to understand
enough about DRP so you don’t have to come running back to this book every
time you need an answer (but I also don’t want this book to gather dust on
your shelf — that would be an equally tragic outcome).
Over in Chapter 10, I discuss testing DR plans. Done properly, performing
those tests can take care of the training issue, all by itself.
Types of training
Company staff have several levels of training available:
 Paper testing: Circulate recovery procedures to a fairly wide audience.
Include all the personnel who are likely perform the actual recovery
effort. By carefully reading and testing the recovery documents, they
mentally step through the recovery procedures.
 Walkthroughs: You can use these group events to indoctrinate new staff
members and refresh existing staff with disaster recovery procedures.
New faces can introduce new knowledge and wisdom, which benefits all
parties.
 Parallel tests: There’s nothing like hands-on testing to keep recovery
personnel familiar with recovery procedures. New staff members benefit
from parallel testing by observing more experienced staffers in action.
 Cutover tests: A cutover test is a kind of controlled crisis — or, at least,
a scheduled crisis in which the stakes are high. Personnel can benefit
from the intensity of the experience.
261
Chapter 11: Keeping DR Plans and Staff Current

Practice makes perfect. If you carefully and properly choose the participants
for each type of test, simply performing the test provides the participants
with the necessary training.
Indoctrinating new trainees
Train new employees in the organization, particularly those who are likely to
be on recovery teams, as soon as possible. I suggest the following scheme for
getting new staff members up to speed on recovery procedures:
 Procedure review — week one: Make one of the earliest assignments for
new staff members a review of all DR recovery procedure documents.
 Business Impact Analysis (BIA): Have new staff members read through
the BIA to help them see the big picture about the business’s critical
processes.
 Walkthroughs: Invite new staff members to walkthroughs, even if they’re
only observers. Observing a walkthrough exposes them to the thought
behind the BIA and the recovery plans and procedures.
 Simulations: See what kind of management and leadership skills your
new staff members may possess.
 Parallel and cutover tests: Involving new staff members in these tests
spreads the experience around. You never know who’ll be available to
help out in an actual disaster, so the more people who have hands-on
experience, the better.
 Formal goals and milestones: If you incorporate involvement in all
levels of testing as part of employee goals and milestones, you give new
employees additional incentive to get involved and up to speed. You
also send a message that the organization is serious about disaster
recovery planning.
 Formal and informal training: Introduce new employees to the culture
of disaster recovery planning in the organization by setting up formal
training classes and brown-bag lunch events.
The activities in the preceding list can help influence new employees early,
and many organizations make preparation for disaster a top priority.
You probably don’t need to develop an entire curriculum for training potential
recovery personnel. Just include them in all of the review, revision, and testing
activities that need to take place, and they can get their training through OJT
(on-the-job training).

Understanding the 
Role of Prevention
In This Chapter
 Reducing risk in your facilities
 Keeping your technology safe
 Preventing people from gumming up the works
 Beefing up your security
 Bringing prevention home for your employees
T
hroughout a disaster recovery planning project, and perpetually there-
after, the DR planning team needs to continually watch for opportunities
that can help prevent disasters or lessen their impact on the organization.
“An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” the old saying goes.
Although he was a prolific inventor, Benjamin Franklin couldn’t have envi-
sioned the Internet when he first penned that phrase. In disaster recovery
planning, prevention is key — but it’s often overlooked.
You have many places to look for prevention opportunities:
 Facilities
 Processes
 Technology
 Personnel
 Security
 Resilient architecture

The opportunities you find may not necessarily be huge, but smaller things
often reduce risk in some way.
This chapter focuses on reducing risk where you find it to minimize the effects
of disasters. In some cases, you can even prevent disasters. I’m talking about
the man-made kind of disasters, of course — I don’t want you to start thinking
that I have a formula for preventing hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes, or
floods. Perhaps a more accurate title for this chapter would be “Understanding
the Role of Risk Reduction,” but I still like the term prevention better because
this chapter talks about preventing the effects of disasters.
Here are some disaster prevention rules of thumb:
 You can’t prevent natural disasters, but you can take measures to
reduce their effects.
 You can prevent some man-made disasters, and you can also take mea-
sures to reduce their effects.
As long as you understand these principles, you’re on the right track.
This chapter gives you a different view of the same material you can find 
elsewhere in this book. Most of this book talks about analysis and response
because most people think in terms of actions during a disaster. However,
prevention is a worthwhile destination in disaster recovery planning, so I
dedicate this entire chapter to it.
Preventing Facilities-Related Disasters
Today’s most modern and secure Internet Data Centers (IDCs) are practically
fortresses in their own right. Internet Data Centers are commercial server host-
ing facilities that house customers’ Internet-reachable servers. The data center
operators have a good reason for the security they use: They’re reducing many
types of risks that, left unchecked, could precipitate man-made disasters. And
many of the features of these hardened data centers also help to reduce risks
associated with natural disasters, as well.
These facilities are expensive to build because both their construction 
methods and the special equipment they use aren’t cheap. You can often 
justify these costs by the very high availability and stability that these 
facilities provide.
Organizations don’t need to be Fortune 20 companies to be able to afford
such facilities. You don’t need to build one; instead, you can rent as much 
or as little space as you need. Indeed, hundreds of such facilities exist
264
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

throughout the world. You can rent as much as hundreds of square feet, or as
little as 1U of rack space (a unit, or U, of rack space is 1.75 inches in height).
Either way, applications running on equipment in such a facility have the
potential for extremely high availability because of the supporting facilities,
such as Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs), generators, and so on.
The facility-related areas in which you can reduce risk are
 Site selection
 Fire prevention
 HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) redundancy
 Power system redundancy
 Protection from civil unrest and war
 Avoidance of industrial hazards
I discuss all the areas in the preceding list and the secondary effects of 
facilities-related disasters in the following sections.
Site selection
A building’s destiny is heavily governed by its location. A building’s location,
relative to a number of natural hazards, plays a major role in whether the
building and its contents and occupants may be subjected to the effects of
natural events.
Here are some of the natural events that good site selection can mitigate:
 Hurricanes: To reduce the effects of hurricanes, locate sites away from
coastlines and on high ground in hurricane-prone areas. If your organiza-
tion fears the damaging and disrupting effects of hurricanes, don’t locate
data processing facilities near hurricane-prone areas. You may need to
locate such facilities hundreds of miles away from office locations. Figure
12-1 shows Atlantic hurricanes from the 2005 hurricane season, which
included Hurricane Katrina. Use maps covering several decades of hurri-
canes to assess hurricane risks if your organization is located in the
southeastern United States.
 Tornadoes: Although you can’t absolutely avoid tornadoes, organiza-
tions can choose to locate offices and data processing facilities away
from the highest-risk areas. You can at least figure out the risks of being
located in tornado-prone areas and how you can minimize damage and
loss of human life. Figure 12-2 shows those high-risk areas within the
continental United States.

 Floods: Usually associated with heavy rainfall and spring runoff, but also
connected to catastrophes such as levee and dam failures and natural
events such as hurricanes. Floods cause significant damage around the
world each year. In the U.S., you can get Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRMs) that show the statistical likelihood of flooding in specific areas.
The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) publishes these
maps, and the insurance industry uses them to set rates for flood insur-
ance. Figure 12-3 shows a FIRM for a small part of New Orleans, Louisiana.

 Earthquakes: Many regions of the world experience frequent earth-
quakes, usually spaced years or decades apart, and earthquakes are diffi-
cult to predict. Larger earthquakes cause significant damage to buildings,
infrastructure, and communications and can result in major loss of life.
Areas prone to earthquakes have strict building codes to reduce injuries
and potential damage to buildings. The Global Seismic Hazard Map,
which illustrates relative risk of damage from earthquakes, is shown in
Figure 12-4.
 Tsunamis: Great ocean waves that strike coastlines around the world,
tsunamis are usually caused by undersea earthquakes that involve a 
significant displacement of the ocean floor. You usually get only a few
hours’ warning (if you get any at all), which gives you too little time for
even emergency salvage. The December 26, 2004 tsunami in the Indian
Ocean that resulted in over an estimated 200,000 deaths and 1.6 million
displaced persons has resulted in a resurgence of interest, awareness,
the development of warning systems, and an effort to identify high risk
areas around the world.
 Volcanic eruptions: A volcanic eruption is often — but not always — 
preceded by some warning. An erupting volcano emits molten lava and
clouds of ash that damage property, claim lives, and can cause wide-
spread disruption over vast areas. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens
in the United States created an ash fall that plunged many cities, even
those located hundreds of miles away, into total darkness and paralyzed
transportation, public services, and emergency services for days. Figure
12-5 shows the Mount St. Helens volcanic eruption in 1980.

• Vesuvius: Naples, Italy
If your organization is located near any of these volcanoes, you need to
do additional risk analysis to ensure that your DR plans adequately
address the risks associated with the nearby volcano.
 Wildfires: In many locales, wildfires are a significant problem and result
in evacuations, road closures, airport closures, and (occasionally) prop-
erty damage.
 Landslides and avalanches: The sudden downhill movement of rock,
earth, snow, or ice can strike without warning, damaging buildings and
transportation systems, and claiming lives. Although you can’t really
prevent landslides and avalanches, an organization can take care to not
locate its premises in a potential landslide or avalanche path. However, a
landslide or avalanche that occurs even a great distance away from busi-
ness facilities can disrupt transportation and communications systems.
Each kind of natural hazard presents its own set of risks, as well as measures
that you can take to reduce the effects of the events if and when they occur.
Each type of hazard requires creative planning if you want to adequately miti-
gate the risk. To mitigate the risks associated with natural hazards that can
create extensive regional disruption, you need to locate alternate facilities far
enough away that they don’t become involved in the same natural event. For
instance, placing an alternate processing center 300 miles away but on the
same earthquake fault line just isn’t prudent risk mitigation!

Preventing fires
When fire suppression systems and fire fighting crews fail to extinguish a fire
in a business location (or simply take too long to extinguish the fire), a disas-
ter results if critical business functions are affected. Preventing fires gives
you perhaps the most notable means of actually preventing a disaster.
Fire damage
Fires destroy and damage buildings and their contents, and claim thousands
of lives each year throughout the world. Fires cause damage in several ways:
 Injuries and death: People who are trapped in burning buildings are
often injured or killed by flames, smoke, or the collapse of the building
itself.
 Direct destruction: Fire itself damages or destroys flammable materials,
including business records, furniture, and equipment.
 Smoke damage: The smoke from a fire can significantly damage the con-
tents of a building, even areas the fire doesn’t reach. Smoke inhalation is
a major cause of death in fires.
 Water damage: Water is the most common agent for extinguishing a fire
in business locations. Usually used in heavy volumes, the water used to
fight a fire is almost as damaging to business equipment and records as
a flood.
 Extinguishment operations: To reach a fire in a building, fire fighters
often have to cut through roofs, ceilings, walls, and floors.
Also, when a building experiences a fire, the local fire marshal or other local
official often closes the entire building until the fire marshal can complete a
damage assessment and forensic investigation. If you can’t enter a building,
not being able to access business assets can lead to a disaster!
Whenever an organization analyzes the potential detective and preventive
measures for fires, it must give human lives the highest priority over all 
business assets and other concerns.
Fire prevention
Many locales have building codes that require fire detection and suppression
equipment. Fire marshals and other inspectors regularly examine work loca-
tions to make sure you have these systems in place and working, and that
you’re not performing unsafe practices, such as blocking emergency exits and
exit corridors, or accumulating flammable materials (such as empty boxes).
Often, inspections include tests of fire detection and alarm systems to make
sure they’ll properly function if a fire occurs.
270
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

Many organizations purchase a fire insurance policy, which compensates the
organization if a fire damages its building and equipment. Often, the fire insur-
ance company conducts its own inspections to make sure your facility has a
reasonably low risk of fire. A fire insurance company also notes the distance
between the nearest fire station and the business location. Disaster recovery
planners should also make note of the closest fire station in their risk assess-
ments so they can know and mitigate fire-related risks appropriately.
In areas that commonly experience wildfires, fire marshals require residents
and businesses to clear flammable materials from around the outside of their
structures, to reduce the likelihood of property damage from wildfires.
Fire detection
Because fires can cause such heavy damage to a business and its assets, 
you can best reduce the effects of a fire by detecting it as early as possible.
Detecting a fire in its earliest stages can more effectively suppress it and dis-
rupt your business less, well before an actual fire erupts and escalates into a
more serious event.
Several types of smoke and fire detectors are available:
 Infrared smoke detectors
 Ionization smoke detectors
 Aspiration smoke detectors
 Heat detectors
I discuss fire detection apparatus more fully in Chapter 6.
Fire alarms
Alarm systems consist of loud bells, sirens, alarms, and annunciators that
alert personnel when a smoke or fire detector somewhere in the building
detects a fire. Because fire can spread quickly under certain conditions, the
primary purpose of fire alarms is to alert people that they need to evacuate
the building immediately. Fire alarms do little to protect business equipment
and property — but the most important things in the building are the people!
Fire alarms often connect electrically to local fire departments so rescue per-
sonnel are quickly alerted when your alarm system detects a fire. Although
this connection usually saves only a few minutes, those minutes can make a
huge difference in the amount of property damage your organization suffers,
as well as injuries to personnel.
Fire suppression
Many buildings have automatic fire suppression in the form of water sprinklers
in work areas. Rooms containing IT equipment often use more sophisticated
271
Chapter 12: Understanding the Role of Prevention

inert gas fire-suppression systems because water can easily damage comput-
ers. Often, these suppression systems connect directly to alarm systems, so
fire suppression can begin immediately and automatically.
Most businesses also have hand-held fire extinguishers that office workers
can use to fight small fires before fire crews arrive. Using these extinguishers
can prevent a small fire from growing and threatening an entire facility.
HVAC failures
Although heating and air conditioning primarily provide only human comfort 
in most parts of the world, air conditioning is a necessity for the survival and
health of IT equipment. In data processing facilities that house large collections
of IT equipment, the failure of a central air conditioning system can cause 
permanent damage to IT equipment in minutes.
When air conditioning (A/C) failure occurs in facilities that have no backup
A/C system, IT personnel have barely enough time to power everything down
before damage occurs. Often, personnel don’t have time for an orderly shut-
down of systems. If the systems support critical and time-sensitive business
processes, you need one or more backup A/C systems. Larger facilities 
that have vast numbers of IT systems usually rely on a larger number of
smaller (but still quite large) A/C systems, which provides more flexibility 
for scheduled maintenance.
You can prevent IT equipment failures related to too-high temperatures (which
can lead to a disaster) through good capacity planning and design. You always
want enough HVAC capacity to meet your cooling needs — no matter what.
Chapter 6 covers HVAC concerns in more detail.
Power-related failures
IT equipment is gluttonous when it comes to electric power. IT equipment
wants its power steady and clean, and that equipment is intolerant of bumps,
spikes, brownouts, and other mishaps that occur in power systems. Spikes,
surges, and other unwanted noise in incoming power often can damage IT
equipment. Fixing that damage can require costly and time-consuming repairs
and equipment replacement. Businesses that rely on IT systems to support
critical, time-sensitive business processes can’t tolerate these events.
You can almost entirely eliminate disasters caused by power-related anomalies
through proper prevention techniques. You can prevent these three types of
unwanted events:
272
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

 Noise (spikes, surges, and so on): You can prevent these potentially
damaging effects by using Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs), which
clean incoming electric power and feed very clean, noise-free power to
IT equipment.
 Short-term outages: You can prevent power failures that last only a few
minutes by using UPSs that usually contain banks of batteries. With this
battery backup, UPSs can generate electricity even when utility power has
failed. Usually, UPS systems can generate power for a portion of an hour;
but you can find some UPS systems equipped with larger numbers of 
batteries, which permit the UPS to generate power for up to several hours.
 Long-term outages: You need an electric generator for facilities that
need to continue processing even when utility power has been down for
more than an hour. The amount of fuel you store on-site, plus any deliv-
eries you can get, determine the amount of time that electric generators
can provide electricity. Most facilities store no more than seven days
worth of fuel. In most parts of the world, you very rarely experience an
outage of seven days or more.
UPS systems and electric generators work together to provide continuous
electric power to processing facilities. Neither can do the job alone:
 UPS systems: Generally can’t deliver power for more than a portion of
an hour. You need a generator to provide long-term electricity.
 Generator: Requires a few minutes for startup and stabilization before 
it can begin delivering electric power. You need a UPS to fill the gap.
I cover power supply protection more fully in Chapter 6.
Protection from civil unrest and war
Protests, strikes, and general mayhem sometimes get out of hand. Civil and
political events can incite large numbers of people to take to the streets and
damage everything in their path. Notable riots in recent history include
 1992 Los Angeles riots: Thousands of people protested the jury’s ver-
dict in a high-profile criminal case and went on a rampage that resulted
in 53 deaths, widespread looting, and the burning of dozens of busi-
nesses and cars over a period of four days.
 2005 civil unrest in France: The deaths of two teenagers sparked a three-
month period of civil unrest that resulted in the burning of many public
buildings and almost 10,000 cars. Over 2,900 suspects were arrested.
These two events, and dozens of others, have disrupted businesses, some 
to the point of failure. But, in addition to large-scale civil protest, small
groups and even individuals can wreak havoc in many ways, including by
273
Chapter 12: Understanding the Role of Prevention

using vehicles as weapons. You can take some measures to help reduce the
risks associated with mob violence:
 Put up barricades and fencing. Prevent unwanted people from
approaching buildings and personnel.
 Use shatter-proof windows or no windows at all. Well, this measure
won’t make for very attractive buildings, but it’s hard to throw a stone
or a brick through a solid wall.
 Locate away from large cities. Not that civil disturbances don’t happen
in smaller communities, but some organizations consider this measure
because it seems such violence occurs less often in smaller communities.
 Keep a low profile. Keeping a low profile means different things to differ-
ent companies. Maybe you don’t put up big signs or place advertisements
that could incite strong emotional outbursts. Maybe you locate yourself
away from other businesses.
All bets are off when it comes to war. In warfare, fighting factions have
weapons that can inflict damage from great distances, so measures such as
fencing and stronger windows don’t help you much. If your business is in a
war zone, try to locate it in an area that’s not on someone’s list of targets.
And keep your passports nearby and your other options open.
Avoiding industrial hazards
You can control a lot of things about your organization — where it’s located,
for instance. Some of the hazards that can turn into disasters have a lot to do
with where a business is located. In the section “Site selection,” earlier in this
chapter, I discuss floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, volcanoes, and other haz-
ards. In this section, I discuss man-made hazards:
 Nearby facilities with hazardous materials: If your organization is close
to a facility such as a chemical facility, oil refinery, munitions depot,
nuclear power plant, mine, or heavy manufacturing facility (this is by no
means a complete list!), you may need to evacuate your business if some-
thing goes amiss in a nearby facility.
 Hazardous materials in motion: Nearby railroads and petrochemical
pipelines may also have their mishaps, resulting in damage to and 
evacuation of your business location. Figure 12-6 shows a train 
derailment that included a fire and a chlorine gas leak.
I certainly don’t include a comprehensive set of examples in the preceding
list. But maybe the examples I do have can help you become more aware of
the risks associated with nearby industrial activities.

Preventing secondary effects 
of facilities disasters
I feel the need to slip in some recommendations about backup tapes:
 Don’t store backup tapes in even the most secure processing facility.
 Use the services of a secure off-site media storage provider.
Even the most secure processing facility is vulnerable to incidents that can
destroy both servers and backup media — fires, floods, accidental discharge
of fire retardant, hazardous material spills (think about that large UPS battery
room), earthquakes, and don’t forget malicious people who can do serious
damage with a degausser (a device used to erase backup tapes) or a big
hammer. As long as you store backup media close to the systems they back
up, you reduce your ability to recover applications in another location.
Preventing Technology-Related Disasters
As long as you have IT systems — and other electrical and mechanical appa-
ratus — that support business processes, you may have disasters caused by
their breakdown. You need to design, build, and maintain the systems that
support your processes to help keep those systems from failing.

Chapter 12: Understanding the Role of Prevention

These two principles can help you understand this concept:
 Failures happen, and you can’t absolutely prevent them.
 Don’t allow failures to cause a full-scale disaster.
Dealing with system failures
Anyone who’s been in IT for any length of time has seen many kinds of IT 
failures that cause applications to fail. Here are some examples:
 Hard drive failure: For one reason or another, hard drives just stop
working. Long ago, you had to worry about head crashes, but you don’t
hear about those kinds of failures any more. Hard drives still do fail
sometimes, however.
 Power supply failure: Power supplies generate a lot of heat, and this
heat can stress components to the breaking point.
 Circuit board failure: Motherboards, controllers, and network adaptors
all have a finite life span.
 Cabling failure: Although it happens less often than in decades past,
cabling still occasionally goes bad.
 Operating system and software bugs: These days, operating system,
database, server, and application software is unbelievably complex.
Sometimes, an organization has the bad luck to present a unique and
deadly combination of circumstances that the software didn’t anticipate,
causing that software to malfunction. The worst kind of failure occurs
when you don’t know of the failure right away and some form of damage
slowly spreads through your data.
 Data corruption: Sometimes, you simply can’t access or create data,
usually because of a failure elsewhere (in hardware or software).
Systems don’t run forever. The following sections discuss ways to keep the fail-
ures from the preceding list (and others) from turning into full-scale disasters.
Minimizing hardware 
and software failures
Software and hardware failures aren’t wholly preventable, but you should do
all that’s reasonable to prevent failures while still preparing for them. The fol-
lowing list contains many measures you can take to prepare for hardware and
software failures when they do happen:
276
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

 Perform regular data backups. Copying data from main hard drives to
other hard drives or backup tape is the best insurance in cases of hard
drive or related failure.
 Perform regular data restores. Just because you can perform data
backups doesn’t mean you can get that data back! Test your organiza-
tion’s ability to restore data at least once per month to make sure that
backups are working and that you can actually recover data from
backup tapes.
 Keep spare systems. In some cases, you might more easily recover an
application or database onto a different system than diagnose or repair
a problem on a primary server. You might be able to use development
servers, test servers, and servers for less-critical applications as spare
systems.
 Keep spare parts. Having spare disk drives, memory, motherboards, and
power supplies gives you more choices when you experience a hardware
failure.
 Have service manuals. You never know who may need to open up one
of your servers or storage systems. The usual experts may not be
around when you need them.
Pros and cons of a monoculture
In computer terms, a monoculture is an environment whose systems are all of
the same operating system and hardware type. Having a network and server
monoculture has certain advantages and disadvantages. Table 12-1 outlines
monoculture pros and cons.
Table 12-1
Pros and Cons of a Monoculture
Pros
Cons
Lower support costs
Dependent on a single supplier
Lower training costs
A software bug or malfunction affects 
all systems
Ability to cannibalize other 
Security vulnerability affects all systems
systems for spare parts
A monoculture isn’t altogether bad, and you don’t necessarily need to avoid
it. It has many obvious advantages. But monocultures do have certain risks
that you need to analyze and deal with.
277
Chapter 12: Understanding the Role of Prevention

Years ago, some New York-based investment banks that were concerned about
monocultures built interesting application architectures. One such organiza-
tion built an active/active cluster by using two different types of transaction
servers that recorded the purchase and sale of investment securities — these
servers handled tens or hundreds of thousands of transactions per day. The
cluster consisted of two sets of servers:
 IBM running the AIX OS with a DB2 database
 Sun running the Solaris OS with an Oracle database
The organization was so concerned about the risk of a software bug taking
down their entire cluster that they built their cluster with entirely different
hardware and software. Thus, the organization got peace of mind, knowing 
if a bug or malfunction occurred in one server’s hardware, software, or 
database, that bug or malfunction appearing in the other system would be
extremely unlikely.
Although you can’t prevent failures, you can prevent those failures from 
escalating into disasters.
Building a resilient architecture
The suggestions listed in the section “Minimizing hardware and software 
failures,” earlier in this chapter, may work for processes that have an RTO
(Recovery Time Objective) of a day or more. But many business processes
can’t be without their supporting IT systems for more than a few minutes. In
these cases, you need a resilient architecture — one that can continue support-
ing applications on almost a non-stop basis, one that’s impervious to failure,
even a disaster that renders an entire processing center unusable for hours 
or days at a time.
The methods for building a resilient architecture are
 Server clustering: By using special clustering software, you can apply
an active/active configuration to two servers in which both are perform-
ing the full application load in a sharing basis. Or you can apply an
active/passive configuration in which one server processes application
transactions and the other is ready to take over at a moment’s notice.
You can store servers in a cluster in the same room, the same city, or
thousands of miles apart.
 Data replication and mirroring: Copying transaction data from one
storage system to another. If one storage system fails, the other has an
up-to-date copy of all recent transactions.
Clustering and replication can work closely together to create an application
architecture that can continue running — despite the failure of a minor 
hardware component or the complete destruction of a processing center.
278
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

Chapter 7 explores clustering in a lot more detail. Chapter 8 takes up the 
subject of data replication and mirroring.
Preventing People-Related Disasters
An organization can have a brilliant application architecture, resilient 
business processes, and superbly engineered server clusters, and disaster
can still occur. If the people who operate the IT systems and perform busi-
ness processes aren’t familiar with what they’re doing, a simple mistake 
can trigger system failure, causing a disaster.
You can take several measures to prevent disasters caused by human error:
 Accurate documentation: Procedures for routine and not-so-routine
actions, at every layer in the stack, from the wiring plant to application
instructions. Periodically review such documentation to make sure it’s
up to date.
 Configuration standards: Also known as server build standards and data-
base configuration standards. Documented configuration settings that all
systems in an enterprise use. Consistency makes actions more routine
and outcomes more predictable.
 Training: General training in the skills associated with each job descrip-
tion, plus specific training on the architecture, development, and opera-
tions of your systems and applications.
 Pre-employment screening: Make sure that the workers you hire have
the skills required to competently perform their duties.
 Change management: This formal management process says that nothing
gets changed in the environment until each change has been formally
reviewed and approved.
 Configuration management: The tools and procedures that keep an
accurate record of the configuration for each system in the enterprise. 
In larger organizations, this level of recordkeeping can be very time con-
suming; you can find enterprise-level tools available to handle this task
automatically.
More than just innocent mistakes can cause a disaster. An employee’s ill
intent can also be disastrous. These measures can help to reduce those risks:
 Pre-employment background checks: Prior to hiring someone, an orga-
nization should verify that candidate’s employment history, education,
and credentials.
 Pre-employment criminal background: An organization should verify
that the candidate doesn’t have a criminal record that would disqualify
him or her from employment. Each organization needs to develop its
own criteria for filtering job candidates.
279
Chapter 12: Understanding the Role of Prevention

 Periodic background checks after hire: Check to make sure an
employee’s criminal record stays clean after you hire him or her. This
routine check is especially important for employees who have been
working in an organization for several years. Who knows — maybe 
that extended vacation was spent in jail!
 Formal employment agreements: An organization should have employ-
ment agreements, contracts that formally outline what the organization
expects of the employee, as well as the consequences for not meeting
those expectations. Such agreements can serve as useful deterrents,
making an employee think twice about carrying out some malicious
action that could harm the organization.
 Audit logging: When employees know that the organization monitors
their activities, they’re less likely to do something they wouldn’t want 
to be caught doing. But you should trust your employees — logging
exists to provide a history of events on systems that you can use as 
a troubleshooting aid.
None of the measures in the preceding list actually prevents an employee
from carrying out a malicious action, but these measures can help the organi-
zation do a better job of selecting candidates and observing them after hire.
Preventing Security Issues and Incidents
The absence or failure of a security control can lead to some man-made dis-
asters. Indeed, many security incidents can seriously harm an organization in
the same way a prolonged outage caused by a natural disaster can. The types
of security incidents that can become disasters include
 Computer break-ins: Hackers and other cyber-criminals can use some
means to gain access to a system so they can
• Steal data: Most often, cyber thieves go after the money — credit
card numbers, bank account numbers, and other personal informa-
tion that they can use to steal money from citizens or perpetrate
identity theft.
• Alter, damage, or corrupt data: Hackers also love to alter or cor-
rupt data — a far more serious action because the organization
may not immediately recognize it.
• Embarrass the organization: A hacker may want to embarrass an
organization by defacing its public Web site. Figure 12-7 shows an
example of such a defacement.
280
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

 Malware: This inclusive term means viruses, worms, Trojan horses, 
and so on. The specific purpose of malware is to disrupt, disable, or
destroy systems, including those running critical applications.
 Denial of Service: Both Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial 
of Service (DDoS) attacks have a specific purpose — to render a server
or group of servers unusable by the intended users. You can defend
against a DoS or DDoS, but it can cost you.
 Social engineering: A variety of activities in which outsiders — often
posing as employees, tech support, law enforcement, or Microsoft —
contact various employees in order to obtain company secrets. Social
engineers can use their new-found knowledge to commit further 
criminal acts, such as computer break-ins.
 Damage by former employees: Often, those who do the most harm 
to an organization are its former employees, now outsiders, who are
familiar with people, technology, architectures, and weaknesses. Now
and then, you see news stories about former employees who cause
damage to their former employers’ property, including computer 
systems and data.

Chapter 12: Understanding the Role of Prevention

You can use several measures to reduce security risks:
 Anti-virus software: Used to detect and block all sorts of malware, includ-
ing viruses, worms, and Trojan horses. Every server and workstation 
running any Windows operating system should have anti-virus software
that blocks malware in real-time, updates its signature files (a database 
of known viruses and other malware) daily, and performs a whole-disk 
scan weekly.
 Security patches: One of the chief ways that hackers break into systems
and networks is through well-known vulnerabilities. Most often, you 
can find security patches available for these vulnerabilities, but many
organizations don’t apply these patches quickly enough.
 Firewalls: These devices block access to an organization’s network
through the Internet and any directly connected partners. Firewalls are
configured by network administrators with rules that permit specific
types of connections to specific systems while blocking all other
attempts at communication.
 Application firewalls: These firewalls examine the contents of communi-
cation to application servers (including Web servers) and block any com-
munications identified as malicious in nature. Hackers who want to break
into an organization’s networks or servers often attack that organization’s
Web sites.

Hacking: Not just for kids anymore
The stereotypical hacker is a lonely teenage boy
who’s intelligent, curious, bored, and likes com-
puters. Without the responsibilities of adulthood,
teen hackers have way too much time on their
hands, and they use their computers, their
brains, and their spare time to figure out how to
manipulate computers, including how to break
into them.
The recreational teen hacker is giving way to a
new breed of hackers — professionals who hack
for pay. Organized crime discovered that the
Internet is a safer and easier place to prey on
people and businesses, and they’re highly suc-
cessful at it. In 2005, the U.S. Treasury Department
reported that proceeds from cyber-crime had
surpassed the proceeds from drug trafficking,
starting in 2004.
When a corporate profit motive spurs an activity
(even if the corporation is organized crime), the
people involved in the activity are going to be
more determined than before, now that cash is
involved. Hence, organizations that have highly
valued information and assets need to take added
precautions to protect those assets (and their
reputations).
So, although computer-savvy teenage boys still
like to break into computers, they now have a
career path that lets them earn a living doing
what they love.

 Vulnerability scanners: Security people in an organization use these
devices to identify vulnerabilities in its systems, applications, or network
devices that a hacker could use to break in. When the devices discover
vulnerabilities, security people notify operations personnel about the
problems.
 Intrusion detection system (IDS): Network- and server-based systems
that monitor network traffic and generate alerts that they send to opera-
tions personnel when an attempted break-in or intrusion appears to be in
progress.
 Intrusion prevention system (IPS): The newer and better IDSs also 
function as intrusion prevention systems by actually blocking suspected
malicious communications before they can cause harm.
 Video surveillance: You can use cameras and video recording equipment
to detect intruders and prove their presence in a court of law. And visible
video cameras provide a deterrent effect by discouraging illegal activity.
You can use many other means, beyond those in the preceding list, to improve
the security in an organization’s applications, servers, and networks so they
don’t fall prey to the wide variety of attacks that frequently occur.
Prevention Begins at Home
In a regional disaster, employees often aren’t available to help the disaster
recovery team because they’re attending to a more important concern —
their families. After that earthquake, hurricane, flood, or other occurrence,
most employees with families attend to those needs before even considering
showing up at work to be on the disaster recovery team. Until they can take
care of their families, employees aren’t coming to work, no matter how bad
things are there.
Prevention at home can help. If you inform employees about the measures
they can take to be better prepared for a disaster, you can help make sure
employees’ families are better taken care of in a disaster. If his or her family 
is secure, an employee is more likely to make him- or herself available to
assist in disaster recovery operations.
Employers have a key role in prevention. While they conduct their Business
Impact Analysis (BIA) and risk analyses, DR team members can probably get
disaster response and prevention information, such as preparation tips, from
local civil authorities. Such information can help business DR planning efforts,
and those same sources frequently have family disaster prevention informa-
tion. Obtain those family prevention flyers or booklets in large quantities and
make them available to employees to increase the likelihood that they’ll take
steps to make their families more prepared for disasters.
283
Chapter 12: Understanding the Role of Prevention

The DR project can go one step further and actually assist key recovery 
personnel with information and even supplies for their families. The better
prepared personnel are to take care of themselves and their families, the
more likely they are to be available to assist in recovery operations.

Planning for Various 
Disaster Scenarios
In This Chapter
 Getting your business ready for natural disasters
 Preparing for man-made disasters
N
atural or man-made disasters throw in wild cards that can make carry-
ing out recovery operations more difficult for your organization. In this
chapter, I discuss the primary and secondary effects from a variety of disas-
ter scenarios, and I explain how you can improve your recovery plans for the
best chances of success.
Planning for Natural Disasters
Nature can throw a lot of surprises that make planning, rescue, and recovery
operations difficult. Violent natural events can directly effect property and
equipment, and they can also have secondary effects on communications and
transportation systems, which hamper recovery efforts and may have greater
impact than the event itself.
Earthquakes
Earthquakes strike with little or no warning and cause widespread damage.
The violent side-to-side motion in an earthquake can cause considerable
damage to buildings, equipment, and IT systems. Earthquakes often damage
transportation infrastructure, particularly bridges and elevated roadways in
large cities, requiring extensive repairs that can take weeks or months to
complete.

Generally speaking, earthquakes occur in areas with a history of them. An
earthquake rarely strikes an area that doesn’t have prior earthquake history.
Transportation considerations
When a major earthquake strikes a city, people will be spending the next sev-
eral hours wherever they happen to be at the time. Transportation is usually
the hardest hit infrastructure, particularly bridges, tunnels, and elevated
roadways.
After human life, transportation systems are often the next most important
attention-getter in an earthquake. Emergency supplies in appreciable volumes
arrive by truck or rail. In severe situations, authorities and aid organizations
can airlift emergency supplies, but airlifts usually bring only the absolute
necessities — drinking water, food rations, and emergency medical supplies.
Red Cross helicopters don’t bring in Sun servers or Cisco routers — not by a
long shot!
Communication considerations
Communications networks tend to be highly congested after an earthquake,
both because of damage to facilities and high usage. Many people make a
quick phone call to say, “We just had an earthquake, and we’re okay.” Other
people use communications facilities for longer periods of time to convey
more detailed information.
The diversity in voice and data communications presents some opportunities
after an earthquake. Because carriers’ networks are often located in different
physical locations, one or two may suffer significant outages in an earthquake,
and others may fare a little better. Text messages may fare better than voice
communications over congested cellular networks.
Recovery considerations
You may want to incorporate some of these items into your DR plan if any of
your business locations are at risk for earthquakes:
 Emergency supplies: In the event that employees are at the workplace
when an earthquake occurs and can’t travel home for a few days. Also,
keep supplies that disaster response personnel need when they do
arrive at the business location. Emergency supplies should include food,
water, medical supplies, and blankets.
 Equipment protection: Even if building codes don’t require it, protect
equipment with extra bracing and other means so storage racks don’t
fall down in an earthquake and equipment doesn’t fall off racks and
shelves.
286
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

 Emergency power: If public utilities are damaged, but your processing
facility is otherwise workable, you may be able to use generator power
to keep the work location running. In a severe earthquake, however, fuel
trucks may have a difficult time working their way around damaged
roadways to deliver fuel for the generator.
 Supplemental communications: Landlines and cellular networks may be
congested or damaged. For really critical needs, consider satellite phones
from Iridium, Inmarsat, or Globalstar, and VSAT network connectivity. A
hand-crank or solar-powered radio can also help you receive news from
the outside world.
 Replacement IT systems: In the event that an earthquake damages some
IT systems. Include replacement user workstations because systems in
employee work areas aren’t usually braced, so they may fall during the
quake and be damaged.
Wildfires
Many factors contribute to the amount of warning you receive before a 
wildfire disaster strikes — from as little as several minutes to a few days.
Transportation infrastructure may be blocked if fires approach roadways.
Communications and electricity may be cut off if fires burn through areas
that contain wooden power poles.
Because of the threat to human life and property, local authorities may order
the evacuation of personnel if a wildfire threatens a facility. You usually have
only enough time to quickly gather personal belongings before leaving. Staff
don’t know how quickly they can return to the facility or whether public utili-
ties will be cut off during their absence. You might have time to quickly gather
backup tapes before leaving, but a DR plan can’t count on those tapes being
rescued because a wildfire can occur after hours. In that case, personnel may
not be able to reach the facility because roads may already be closed.
Transportation considerations
Although roads may be closed for several hours to a few days, they’re rarely
damaged. And in most situations, personnel don’t find themselves as stranded
as in an earthquake. More often, roads are closed due to poor visibility caused
by heavy smoke or to provide easier access for fire fighting crews. But road
closures may prevent personnel from leaving or entering the facility for a day
or more.
Communication considerations
When wildfires damage communication facilities, you may have to wait at
least a few days before communication is restored. So, although your facility
may escape direct damage, you might be forced to go without communica-
tions for as long as several days.
287
Chapter 13: Planning for Various Disaster Scenarios

A fire marshal may not allow you to occupy a building if communications 
are down.
Recovery considerations
Consider adding these measures to a DR plan for facilities in areas threatened
by wildfires:
 Emergency supplies: In the event that employees are at the workplace
when a wildfire strikes and can’t travel home for a few days. You may want
facemasks and/or air filters in case a lot of smoke blows toward the facil-
ity. Have disaster response personnel bring additional emergency supplies
in case you exhaust the supplies stocked in the facility before their arrival.
 Firefighting equipment: Employees stranded at a work facility with an
approaching fire can use saws, shovels, and other gear to remove flam-
mable materials from around the building.
 Supplemental communications: A wildfire may damage landlines and
cellular networks. For really critical needs, consider satellite phones 
and VSAT network connectivity. You can also use a hand-crank or solar-
powered radio to stay in touch with the outside world.
Volcanoes
In most cases, volcanoes provide warning before they erupt — but not always.
Volcanic eruptions can be violent and devastating when they do occur, so 
personnel at a work location should take every means and opportunity to
evacuate if ordered by civil emergency authorities or law enforcement. Just
get the heck out!
Volcanic eruptions are characterized by huge clouds of smoke and ash, lava
flows, pyroclastic flows (fast-moving currents of hot gas, ash, and rock), and
significant landslides and debris flows that can travel dozens of miles over
land and through river valleys.
If any office location or workers reside within one hundred miles of an active
volcano, gather information from local civil authorities regarding precautions,
preparations, and evacuation procedures. I live within twenty miles of one
active volcano and eighty miles from three others, so I made myself familiar
with this information for my location. But volcanoes in different parts of 
the world have vastly different behavior, so what’s good for me may not be
much help for you.
Transportation considerations
If you live or work near a volcano that may erupt with little notice, you need
to be able to evacuate quickly and take next to nothing with you. If an active
eruption is about to take place, staff may not be able to return to the work
288
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

facility for days or weeks, and worse yet, an eruption can damage or com-
pletely destroy homes and work locations.
Recovery considerations
If a volcano is located near a primary work location, the entire business may
have to start over in a different location if a serious eruption occurs. Discuss
the actual risks associated with a specific volcano with civil authorities and
insurance company officials.
Floods
Floods typically occur as a result of excessive rainfall in a short period of
time or unusually warm weather that causes a heavy springtime snowmelt.
Floods can threaten a business in several ways:
 Direct building damage from flood waters: If a work location is near a
stream or river, flood waters may threaten the actual structure, as well
as any assets and equipment located inside.
 Damage to transportation systems: Even if employees’ homes and the
work facilities are on high ground, major nearby transportation systems
might not be. Flood damage to nearby highways can force some workers
to stay home (or at work) and disrupt the shipment of supplies, materi-
als, and products.
 Damage to communications and public utilities: Flooding may damage
and cause widespread interruptions in communications and public util-
ity infrastructures. So, although a particular business may escape the
direct effects of flooding, a communications or electric power outage
may still render a business location inoperative for several days.
 Forced evacuations: Civil authorities or law enforcement may require
that you evacuate work locations and residences to prevent loss of life
during a flood.
Transportation considerations
Floods can cover or wash away roads and bridges, paralyzing transportation
for many days. People get stuck wherever they were when the flood waters
rose, whether at home, work, or elsewhere.
Communication considerations
In areas in which flooding occurs, communications may not be severely dis-
rupted, although outages may still occur. Even in rivers that do flood from
time to time, the characteristics of each individual flood may vary enough to
make damage and disruption less than predictable.
289
Chapter 13: Planning for Various Disaster Scenarios

Recovery considerations
You might incorporate some of these items into your DR plan if any of your
business locations are at risk for floods:
 Emergency supplies: In the event employees are at the workplace when
flooding occurs and can’t travel home for several days. Also, disaster
response personnel need supplies when they arrive at the business loca-
tion. Emergency supplies should include food, water, medical supplies,
and blankets.
 Supplemental communications: Landlines and cellular networks may be
congested or damaged. For really critical needs, consider satellite phones
from Iridium, Inmarsat, or Globalstar, and VSAT network connectivity.
 Emergency power: If floods have damaged power systems, but a pro-
cessing facility is otherwise workable, you may be able to use generator
power to keep the work location running. In a severe flood, however, fuel
trucks may not be able to deliver fuel for the generator.
 Replacement IT systems: In the event that flooding damages some IT
systems. Be sure to include replacement user workstations.
 Alternate work locations: You may not be able to use buildings damaged
in a flood for days or weeks. The organization may need to do business
elsewhere for quite a while, and you may not be able to enter the
premises to retrieve important equipment or records.
Wind and ice storms
Although they’re far different from each other, wind and ice storms inflict
similar damage to buildings and property. Although you usually get some
warning before a wind or ice storm, you don’t have enough time to do any-
thing but pack a few things and get to wherever you want to be stuck for a
while — work, home, or someplace else.
Probably the biggest effect of wind and ice storms is widespread power out-
ages caused by one of the following:
 Wind blowing over trees, which then damage power and phone lines
 Ice that causes trees to collapse onto power and phone lines
 Ice that directly damages power transmission systems and telephone
networks
Transportation considerations
In wind and ice storms, many trees fall over, often blocking roadways, making
travel slow and difficult. In ice storms, roads are also icy. Civil authorities or law
enforcement may close roads. Hence, people get stranded wherever they are.
290
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

In severe situations, delivery of supplies may be interrupted for days at a
time. Workers can’t get to work (or get home from work).
Communications considerations
Communications can be hard hit in wind and ice storms. Where the storm
doesn’t directly damage phone lines themselves, widespread power outages
can cause cell sites and remote nodes to exhaust their emergency battery
supplies. Locations that have emergency generators can work for a while
after emergency battery supplies run out, but even these generators fail
when they run out of fuel. In severe storms, communications can be out for
several days — even a week or more.
Recovery considerations
DR plans for businesses located in areas subject to wind and ice storms might
consider the following:
 Emergency supplies: You may need significant stocks of food, water,
medical supplies, and blankets in areas hit by these storms. Recovery
personnel who can make it through should bring additional supplies if
they can obtain them.
 Supplemental communications: Landlines and cellular networks may be
congested or damaged. For really critical needs, consider satellite phones
from Iridium, Inmarsat, or Globalstar, and VSAT network connectivity.
 Emergency power: Generator power may keep the work location run-
ning for a few days. But in a severe wind or ice storm, the power may be
out for so long that generators run out of fuel, and fuel trucks may not
be able to deliver fuel for the generator. In severe situations, damaged
transportation systems may hamper emergency services and delivery 
of all kinds of emergency supplies.
Hurricanes
Hurricanes are the perfect storm: They include rain, wind, and flooding, each
in potentially cataclysmic proportions. Big Category 4 and Category 5 storms
cause widespread, severe damage that can take years to recover from.
Hurricanes Camille (1969), Andrew (1992), and Katrina (2005) are prime
examples of the devastating power of hurricanes.
Transportation considerations
Historically, evacuations ahead of hurricanes are slow and take days because
everyone takes to the roadways. All staff members should evacuate when
ordered to by civil authorities so they don’t have to remain behind to ride out
the storm. Because of the colossal potential for damage and loss of life, busi-
nesses should emphasize the need to just leave when so ordered.
291
Chapter 13: Planning for Various Disaster Scenarios

Communication considerations
Communications after a hurricane can be out for several days, even a week
or more. Even if phone lines aren’t damaged, power outages cause cell sites
and remote nodes to exhaust their emergency battery supplies. Cell sites and
remote nodes that have emergency generators can work for a while after their
batteries run out, but eventually even the generators fail when they run out
of fuel.
Recovery considerations
Businesses that lie in the path of a hurricane should hope for the best but pre-
pare for a complete loss of all business assets. Businesses in hurricane-prone
areas may want to consider the following in their DR plans:
 Emergency supplies: For those unfortunates left behind to ride out a
hurricane, emergency supplies need to include food and water, medical
supplies, and rain gear — enough for several days, at least.
 Supplemental communications: Hurricanes can completely knock out
landline and mobile phone systems. For really critical needs, consider
satellite phones that completely bypass landline and cellular systems,
and VSAT network connectivity. A hand-crank or solar-powered radio
can help you receive news from the outside world.
 Emergency power: You may need only generator power to keep the work
location running for a few days. But in a hurricane, the power may be out
for so long that generators run out of fuel. Remember that fuel trucks may
have a difficult time delivering fuel for the generator.
 Alternate processing facility: Locate a recovery center far away from
areas threatened by hurricanes and have systems at this recovery
center assume duties. The best time to invest in an alternate facility is
after the hurricane season is over, when demand for such facilities
should be lower.
Tornadoes
Extreme winds are associated with tornado funnel clouds during severe thun-
derstorms in the U.S. Midwest and other parts of the world. Tornadoes strike
with little or no warning, and they can completely destroy a residence or
business location.
The area affected by an individual tornado is quite small — usually just a few
square miles. But portions of the U.S. and other parts of the world are struck
by tornadoes at a disturbing rate. Unless you moved there yesterday, if you’re
in tornado country, you probably already know it.
292
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

Transportation considerations
Because tornadoes strike and travel fairly quickly, wherever a person is when
he or she receives the tornado warning is where he or she will be when it
strikes. Many people get into their vehicles and attempt to out-run or out-
maneuver a tornado, but trying to change locations during a tornado can be
risky — and often fatal. Stay in the building you’re in when you receive the
tornado warning and head for a designated safe area where occupants should
gather during a tornado.
Communication considerations
Because tornadoes are so localized, any communications outages are usually
repaired quickly, within a day or two at the most. Most cell tower structures
and telephone company switching centers are built to withstand the heavy
winds of a tornado. However, damage can occur, causing localized outages
that can last hours to days.
Recovery considerations
Businesses located in tornado-prone areas should be prepared for the total
loss of business facilities. But because of the highly local nature of tornadoes,
you probably don’t need to locate your backup facility more than a few dozen
miles away (unlike earthquake and hurricane disasters, which strike much
larger regions). If your business is in an area prone to tornadoes, consider
putting the following preparations in place:
 Emergency supplies: Emergency supplies need to include food and water,
medical supplies, and rain gear — enough for at least two days.
 Supplemental communications: Tornadoes can completely knock out
landline and mobile phone systems. For really critical needs, consider
satellite phones that completely bypass landline and cellular systems,
and VSAT network connectivity. You may also want a hand-crank or
solar-powered radio to receive emergency communications.
 Emergency power: Generator power should keep the work location run-
ning for a few days, even if workers may be away from the facility.
 Alternate processing facility: You may want to set up a recovery center
several miles away from your main business site if your business uses
highly time-critical processes.
Tsunamis
Undersea earthquakes (and occasionally undersea volcanoes) cause tsunamis,
great ocean waves that strike coastlines. Many parts of the world have inade-
quate warning systems, or they don’t have any warning systems at all, which
293
Chapter 13: Planning for Various Disaster Scenarios

puts millions of lives and property at risk of destruction. The 2004 tsunami in
the Indian Ocean provides a vivid reminder that tsunamis are largely unpre-
dictable and can exact a huge toll on lives and property.
Transportation considerations
With little or no advance warning, transportation systems become clogged
beyond capacity before a tsunami. The tsunami itself may cause significant
damage to transportation systems, especially elevated highways and rail-
roads that are located at low elevations near coastlines. Repairs may take
weeks or months.
Communication considerations
A tsunami may partially or completely destroy communications facilities at
low elevations near coastlines, requiring a complete rebuild that may take
weeks to months. Mobile carriers can compensate by bringing COWS (Cell
sites On WheelS) into hard hit areas, permitting some mobile communica-
tions capabilities. Satellite phones are expensive, but you may be able to jus-
tify the cost.
Recovery considerations
You may want to incorporate some of these items into your DR plans if any of
your business locations are at risk from a tsunami:
294
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 
Katrina, the lesson in preparation
The great Katrina hurricane of 2005 was a
watershed natural disaster event in the U.S. The
most pronounced effect from Katrina was wide-
spread and persistent flooding when several
levees broke during a storm surge. After more
than two years, over 200,000 people were still
displaced, and few of those displaced persons
will probably ever return.
The scenario that took place was two-fold: First,
the widespread severe flooding damaged build-
ings, records, and equipment. Businesses had
little time to pack up assets ahead of the storm.
Nearly everything they left behind at street level
was destroyed. Second, public services were
down for many days — transportation, electric-
ity, and other utilities were down for many days;
the airport was closed for more than two
weeks; roads were closed for many days; and
authorities didn’t permit people to return to
some parts of New Orleans for weeks.
Businesses that relied heavily on an online
presence that was served only in New Orleans
had to relocate their online presence to other
locations; businesses that had offsite backup
tape storage (or could evacuate their backup
media ahead of the storm) rebuilt their online
presence with little or no advance planning.
Impaired communications was perhaps the
most critical impact of Katrina. Few New
Orleans businesses had satellite phones or
VSAT (Internet via satellite) terminals.

 Emergency supplies: Disaster response personnel may need supplies
when they arrive at the business location after the tsunami. Emergency
supplies should include food, water, medical supplies, blankets, and
hand-crank or solar-powered radios.
 Emergency power: If public utilities are damaged, but your processing
facility is otherwise workable, generator power may keep the work loca-
tion running. You need to determine whether fuel trucks can work their
way around damaged roadways to deliver fuel for the generator.
 Supplemental communications: Landlines and cellular networks may be
congested or damaged. For really critical needs, consider satellite phones
from Iridium, Inmarsat, or Globalstar, and VSAT network connectivity.
 Replacement IT systems: In the event that some IT systems (both
servers and workstations) are damaged.
Landslides and avalanches
Earthquakes, erosion, ocean waves, groundwater, or heavy rain can cause
landslides (the sudden movement of earth and rock). Several man-made
causes include vibrations from machinery, construction, blasting, logging,
overgrazing, and mining. Avalanches occur when an excessive buildup of
snow leads to that snow, along with trees, rocks, and earth, rapidly cascading
down steep slopes.
Damage from landslides and avalanches range from disrupted transportation
and communications to direct destruction of homes and buildings, as well as
loss of life. Recovery efforts to clear away material and debris can take hours,
days, or longer.
You can easily avoid the risks from landslides and avalanches by not locating
your business near the foot of a steep hillside. However, even if you locate your
business away from these places, landslides and avalanches can still disrupt
transportation and communication, which can have a devastating effect on
business operations. Figure 13-1 shows the effects of a landslide in a major city.
Transportation considerations
Landslides and avalanches can cause transportation byways to be blocked
for days, weeks, or longer. These blockages can make reaching affected areas
time-consuming and difficult, increasing shipping rates and economic losses.
295
Chapter 13: Planning for Various Disaster Scenarios

Communications considerations
Landslides and avalanches can damage communications facilities by destroy-
ing cable systems and buildings that contain communications equipment.
Landslides and avalanches can affect both landline and mobile communica-
tions because most mobile communications backhaul (the communications
from cell towers to switching centers) that occurs over copper or fiber optic
cables on overhead structures or buried in the ground may be damaged.
Satellite telephones continue to function, of course, but your business may
not be able to justify the cost.
Recovery considerations
You may want to incorporate some of these items into your DR plans if any 
of your business locations are at risk from landslides or avalanches:
 Emergency supplies: Emergency supplies need to include food, water,
and medical supplies — enough for several days, particularly in loca-
tions with only a single route in and out. Disaster response personnel
may need supplies when they arrive at the business location. Also con-
sider including blankets and hand-crank or solar-powered radios in your
emergency supplies.
 Emergency power: If public utilities are damaged, but a processing facil-
ity is otherwise usable, generator power may keep the work location
running. You need to determine whether fuel trucks can work their way
around damaged or blocked roadways to deliver generator fuel.

congested or damaged. For really critical needs, consider satellite phones
from Iridium, Inmarsat, or Globalstar, and VSAT network connectivity.
Pandemic
A global pandemic hasn’t occurred for so long that, until the early 2000s, many
people didn’t even know the meaning of the term. The Asian SARS (Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in 2002–2003 and the avian influenza
threat are forcing organizations to begin contingency planning for a possible
pandemic.
Pandemics in history
A pandemic is the outbreak of an infectious disease that spreads over a large
region, even worldwide. Well-known pandemics in history include
 Black Death in the 1300s: This outbreak of the bubonic plague killed over
25 million Europeans in six years, a quarter of the entire population. Up to
half of the population died in the worst-hit urban areas.
 Spanish flu, 1918–1919: This epidemic of influenza killed between 25
and 50 million people worldwide.
 Asian flu, 1957–1958: Responsible for about 70,000 deaths in the U.S.
 Hong Kong flu, 1968–1969: Influenza A caused about 34,000 deaths in
the U.S.
Health experts at the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control (CDC) report that pandemics occur regularly throughout
history and that we’re due for another. Possible candidates include the H5N1
avian influenza that has already claimed hundreds of lives, SARS (which may
re-emerge at any time), tuberculosis, Ebola, and others.
A different kind of disaster
A pandemic is a widespread disaster that seems to occur in slow motion,
compared to other disasters I discuss in this chapter. If and when the next
pandemic hits, it’ll probably play out over several months to a few years. 
A pandemic is a quiet disaster: Buildings aren’t destroyed nor communica-
tions systems compromised, but the effect is nonetheless profound. (See
Figure 13-2.) me of the characteristics of a pandemic include
 High rates of absenteeism: More than 25 percent of workers may be
absent for weeks at a time during a pandemic. Workers are either sick
themselves, caring for sick family members, caring for children whose
schools are closed, or fearful to venture out of their homes. This reduc-
tion in available workforce creates a general slowdown in the output of
businesses across entire regions.
297
Chapter 13: Planning for Various Disaster Scenarios

Unlike other types of disasters, you can’t rely on contract and other out-
side help to supplement absent employees. All businesses in a given
region have a simultaneous need, and even contracting firms experience
high absenteeism in a pandemic situation.
 Supplier shortages: The availability of virtually every type of goods
diminishes because the organizations producing those goods are also
experiencing high absenteeism. You may have to deal with shortages of
fuel, food, and other essentials for daily subsistence.
 Degraded services: Levels of service may dramatically decline when you
have fewer personnel available. Repairs of public utilities take longer;
fewer doctors, bus drivers, and policemen are available to assist you.
 Reduced demand for non-essential goods and services: Demand for
items that aren’t essential for subsistence decline, causing business
downturn in many sectors.
 Degraded medical care: Hospitals may have to turn away most cases of
illness, caring only for those who are the most ill but still have a chance
of survival. Gymnasiums, conference centers, and other gathering places
may be turned into gigantic hospital wards.
 Forced quarantines of entire communities: Hard-hit areas experience
quarantines, and government health authorities don’t permit workers 
to report to their workplaces for fear of spreading disease.
 Closures of schools and public assemblies: Schools and other public
assemblies provide opportunities for disease to spread; hence, schools
may be closed for days to weeks at a time.
 No outside help available: In a pandemic, large geographic regions have
needs that outsiders can’t meet because those outsiders are also affected
by a pandemic. Communities have to survive with the resources available
locally. The International Red Cross may have to spread itself extremely
thin, like a single pat of butter for a thousand loaves of bread.
Transportation considerations
Aside from forced quarantines and fuel shortages, transportation isn’t a
major issue in a pandemic. Indeed, with many people huddled in their homes
for fear of catching disease, roadways may actually be less congested.
Communication considerations
Organizations in a pandemic probably have healthy workers who are willing
to work but can’t report to the workplace because of quarantines, lack of
transportation, or sick family members at home. Businesses need to invest in
remote access and remote telecommunications capabilities long before a
pandemic strikes. During a pandemic wave, organizations probably experi-
ence high rates of remote workers accessing systems from their homes, not
unlike when severe storms and other phenomena keep workers away.

Preparation and recovery considerations
In a pandemic, no natural event inflicts damage on buildings, records, or sys-
tems. Instead, those assets suffer neglect because you don’t have enough
personnel available to care for them adequately. Businesses should develop
contingency plans that include the following:
 Lights-out (unmanned) processing centers: Probably a long-term propo-
sition that requires considerable investment, organizations need to figure
out how to keep their systems running with far fewer staff members than
normal.
 Increased capacity for remote data and voice access: With many work-
ers able to work, but unable or unwilling to report to the business
premises, organizations need to invest in additional remote data and
voice capabilities. To prepare additional remote access capabilities, 
you need a lot of time and resources.
 Reduced output: Businesses need to anticipate reductions in output and
also reductions in demand. But some businesses actually experience an
increase in demand, depending on the goods or services those busi-
nesses produce.
 Cross-training: With significant staff shortages, you need to cross-train
workers so available workers can carry out duties normally performed
by workers who are absent.

Chapter 13: Planning for Various Disaster Scenarios

 Multi-sourcing critical suppliers: Identify which of your business’s sup-
pliers are critical (without which business operations cease) and consider
acquiring additional suppliers to improve the chances that you can get
at least some reduced level of supplies during a pandemic outbreak.
 Educate workers: Some employees stay away from work simply out of
fear. Educating workers on the actual risks can give them an opportunity
to take appropriate precautions based on known facts.
Planning for Man-Made Disasters
Man-made disasters fall into two distinct categories: those that are deliber-
ate, and those that are the result of an error or oversight. Each type has its
special challenges and issues that planners and emergency response person-
nel need to keep in mind so they can avoid further damage and casualties.
Utility failures
Practically all businesses are ravenous for electricity. IT systems are espe-
cially sensitive — they don’t have a tolerance for even relatively minor
spikes, surges, and brownouts.
Some geopolitical locations have higher quality power generation and distrib-
ution systems than others. Quality and wealth aren’t necessarily in direct
proportion. In my career, I’ve seen consistently poor delivery of electric
power in affluent areas. But to be fair, some factors are out of the control of
the power system operators, such as weather and geologic conditions.
Organizations that experience more than an acceptable level of power outages
(for whatever reason) need to consider the following options to assure a con-
tinuous delivery of clean power to critical systems:
 Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS): Usually two systems in one. A UPS
has circuitry that cleans incoming power of spikes, surges, and other
noise so IT equipment receives the cleanest possible power. A UPS system
also has banks of batteries that can become the primary power source for
a short time — usually a fraction of an hour.
 Electric generator: For power outages that last more than several min-
utes, you need an electric generator, in addition to a UPS, to assure
power availability for as long as several days.
 Fuel storage: For organizations that may experience power outages that
last more than a few days (and if you can’t easily get fresh supplies of fuel),
consider building a fuel storage facility. With such a fuel storage facility,
you can have continuous electric power, even during prolonged outages.
300
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

UPS and generators work together — you need both to assure continuous
power. Generators take up to two minutes to come online, so you need a UPS
to fill the gap between the utility outage and when the generator can come
online. Similarly, a UPS can’t supply power for very long, which requires a
generator to provide power for up to several days.
I cover emergency power supplies more fully in Chapter 6 and Chapter 12.
Civil disturbances
Political and economic events can precipitate civil disturbances, including
protests, work stoppages, strikes, vandalism, looting, and general mayhem.
These disturbances can result in property damage, disruption to transporta-
tion, and temporary cessation of business operations. Law enforcement or
military may block transportation routes or enforce evacuations and curfews.
These events can make you want to be anywhere else.
Transportation considerations
During and after such periods of civil disruption, you may find transportation
to and from affected areas limited by damage, barricades, closures, curfews,
and fear. Workers at business locations may be stranded there for hours or
days until things calm down.
Communication considerations
In more serious events, communications may be hampered or cut off, so dis-
aster response personnel may have difficulty communicating with each other.
As a result, you may have trouble getting an accurate assessment of an event’s
effects on business operations. You may find having a variety of landline and
mobile carriers helpful; if one isn’t working, perhaps another is. Workers may
be able to use satellite phones if they can get to an out-of-doors location with
safety.
Recovery considerations
It’s difficult to say what kinds of effects a large civil disturbance might have
on business operations. Here are some measures you can take to mitigate the
effects of civil disturbances:
 Emergency supplies: Emergency supplies need to include food, water,
and medical supplies — enough for several days. Disaster response per-
sonnel may need supplies when they arrive at the business location.
Emergency supplies should also include blankets and hand-crank or
solar-powered radios.
301
Chapter 13: Planning for Various Disaster Scenarios

 Emergency power: If public utilities are damaged, but a processing facility
is otherwise usable, generator power may keep the work location running.
You need to figure out whether fuel trucks can (and will) work their way
around damaged or blocked roadways to deliver generator fuel.
Terrorism and war
The extent and ferocity of terrorism and war are largely unpredictable and
chaotic. All you want to do is get out of the way!
Anything can happen in a war, and you can’t really know what kind of a con-
tingency plan you’ll need. No wonder insurance companies don’t cover war
in their policies.
The September 11, 2001 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. (see
Figure 13-3) were unprecedented for many reasons. In the business continuity
and disaster recovery professions, the attacks brought to light two scenarios
that many BC and DR planners hadn’t considered:
 The complete collapse of an otherwise structurally sound building
 The loss of a large proportion of the workers in an organization

York City

during the
9/11/2001
attack.
302
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 

9/11 forced BC and DR planners back to the drawing board, updating their
contingency and emergency response plans with these new scenarios. Really,
it started a multi-year effort in which organizations took the time to rethink
the adequacy of their emergency plans. Personally, I think that this extra
planning brought about two results:
 Off-site media storage centers got a boost.
 Businesses thought more seriously about whether they wanted to locate
their processing centers in what is essentially a landmark. Many busi-
nesses instead opted for processing centers (and alternate processing
centers) in low-profile, unmarked buildings.
Security incidents
Break-ins, hacking incidents, Denial of Service attacks, and large malware out-
breaks are significant events and have the potential to shut down the IT sys-
tems that support critical business processes.
A security incident can reach disaster levels in a number of ways:
 Data corruption: If the incident causes data corruption, the organization
may be forced to take systems offline until you can recover or rebuild
the data. In large databases, this process can take several days, even on
the fastest available computers.
 Denial of Service (DoS): A concentrated attack, especially when it origi-
nates from large numbers of systems, can render a server or an entire
network of servers unreachable to customers and partners. Such attacks
can last for hours, days, or even weeks.
 Forensics: Your organization (or law enforcement) may need to carry
out forensic operations on affected systems to gather evidence for a
possible prosecution. Trained personnel usually conduct forensics on
quiescent systems (systems in which activity is halted) to provide stabil-
ity, ensuring the best possible evidence gathering.
To reduce the effects of a security incident, consider these measures:
 Alternate servers and storage systems: Place alternate systems and
storage systems into service while trained personnel perform forensics
on affected systems. Before you place affected systems into service,
however, the organization needs to be certain that they won’t be com-
promised, too.
 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) defense: Some Internet service
providers offer a DDoS defense service that may help to restore connec-
tivity to customers and partners. These solutions can cost you, but so
can being offline.
303
Chapter 13: Planning for Various Disaster Scenarios

 Alternate network locations: If an organization is experiencing a Denial
of Service or Distributed Denial of Service, you may be able to avoid dis-
ruption by relocating affected servers or networks to another logical
place on the Internet. Whether this move works has a lot to do with the
determination of the attackers and their ability to change their intended
target.
 Backup data: Replication and mirroring are great technologies that can
compensate for hardware failures. However, in the case of a deliberate
attack, replication or mirroring may propagate the corruption to other
storage systems. If this widespread corruption occurs, you may need to
recover data from a recent backup — but only if analysts can determine
that the attack hasn’t affected a recent data backup.
 Heterogeneous (similar) systems: If attackers attack through known vul-
nerabilities in software, using heterogeneous systems may prevent an
attack from reaching some systems. For instance, if an application uses
both a Sun system with Oracle databases and a Windows system with SQL
Server databases, an attack through the Windows system can’t succeed
on the Sun server. I discuss monocultures in more detail in Chapter 12.
 Forensics training and tools: This measure is an up-front investment of
dollars and training. With better forensics preparedness, your business
can respond more quickly when you need forensic activities, as well as
develop alternate strategies that can minimize impact on business 
operations.
304
Part III: Managing Recovery Plans 
9/11 and Cantor Fitzgerald
Cantor Fitzgerald was a major U.S. government
treasury trading firm in 2001, accounting for one
quarter of all Treasury bond transactions on the
open market. This multi-trillion dollar market is
of primary importance for investment trading in
the world economy.
Cantor Fitzgerald was located on the 101st
through 105th floors of One World Trade Center,
8 to 12 floors above the point at which the plane
hit the tower. Because they were located above
the impact zone, virtually none of the employees
in the building at the time of the attack survived.
Cantor lost 658 employees, or about two-thirds
of its workforce.
In 2001, Cantor was building an alternate pro-
cessing facility, but that facility wasn’t yet com-
plete. The significant loss of life made recovery
from this event especially difficult. Despite
seemingly insurmountable odds, Cantor was
back in operation out of its incomplete alternate
processing facility within one week.
Business continuity and disaster recovery plan-
ners no doubt never imagined a scenario in
which such a large portion of a company’s
workforce is killed in a single event. Prior to
9/11, no single company of any appreciable size
had ever experienced such an event.

time-honored institution in the For Dummies series
of books. I honor that tradition in this part and give you
four chapters that impart insight and wisdom that might
otherwise take many years and many mistakes to figure
out for yourself.
Chapter 14 describes tools that can ease the passage
through a disaster recovery project. In similar fashion,
Chapter 15 showcases ten Web sites that contain more 
DR information than I can possibly cram into this book.
Chapter 16 highlights essential DR project success fac-

BIA Professional
www.strohlsystems.com/software/biaprofessional
BIA Professional, a software product from Strohl Systems, guides you through
the process of developing a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) survey, organiz-
ing the survey data, and presenting the final results. It paints a detailed picture
of financial and operational vulnerabilities, disaster-related impacts, and 
possible recovery strategies.
A feature called BIA Professional Web Server allows your organization to post
online surveys in which selected subject matter experts in your organization
receive a link via e-mail that they can click to take the survey online. This
survey approach allows you to easily collect data about critical business
processes.
BIA Professional contains several features:
 Audit and approval of surveys: Support for company management review
and approval of BIA surveys prior to their release.
 Activity map: Guides you through the steps for creating a BIA survey.
 Question branching: Permits the survey designer to create a survey in
which users are asked only relevant questions.
 Reporting: Simplified report creation that includes a Report Wizard. You
can create reports in Microsoft Excel, Crystal Reports, or PDF formats.
COBRA Risk Analysis
www.securitypolicy.co.uk/riskanalysis
308
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Consultative, Objective and Bi-functional Risk Analysis (COBRA) is a set of risk
analysis and security review tools that C&A Systems Security developed.
The toolset consists of a default process:
 Questionnaire building: The COBRA tool has a large database of ques-
tions contained in question modules that you can select from a knowledge
base. Each module addresses a specific risk area, including access con-
trol, physical security, software development, and so on. You can also
build and add questions manually.
 Risk surveying: The risk surveyor tool manages the questionnaire com-
pletion process. Users can complete the questionnaire all at once, or
they can return to it later. The tool also supports question branching, in
which the program knows which questions to ask based on the answers
given to earlier questions.
 Reporting: The report generator produces results from completed 
questionnaires.
A risk analysis is a key part of a Business Impact Analysis.
BCP Generator
www.bcpgenerator.com
BCP Generator is a popular template-driven tool that you can use to create
business continuity plans. Yes, this book is about disaster recovery planning,
but BCP Generator makes plans that strongly resemble disaster recovery 
procedures.
You can use BCP Generator in one of two ways:
 Template fill-in: If you’re familiar with your processes and want to get
faster results, you can go straight to the templates and begin filling in
details.
 Interactive guide: BCP Generator can guide you, step by step, through
the entire process of creating a business continuity plan, from Business
Impact Analysis to plan maintenance and everything in between.
BCP Generator gives you a highly structured Microsoft Word document 
that contains the entire business continuity plan, including a detailed table 
of contents.

Disaster Recovery Plan Template
www.e-janco.com/drp.htm
If you want to get on a real fast track, the DR Plan Template is a full set of DR
planning template documents that you fill out. The content is broken up into
the following sections:
 Overview: DR plan mission, scope, authorization, responsibility, and key
assumptions
 Business Impact Analysis: Includes scope, objectives, critical time-
frames, and impact statements
310
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

 Backup strategy: Includes data center systems, file servers, data at out-
sourced sites, workstations, and PDAs
 Disaster recovery: Includes recovery team selection and responsibilities
for damage assessment, salvage, and recovery procedures
 Emergency procedures: Actual procedures for assessment, salvage, and
recovery
 DR plan administration: Lifecycle matters, including plan maintenance,
training, testing, and distribution
If you use a template-centric tool such as this one, I recommend that you still
create your plan by using this book and then make adjustments to that plan,
as needed. By relying solely on a template solution, you may overlook critical
risks and issues.
SLA Toolkit
www.service-level-agreement.net
You need Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to define service delivery in IT
organizations. Service Level Agreements are formal service agreements
between suppliers and customers that define the quantity and quality of 
services delivered to customers.
Disaster recovery operations are probably the most vital services that an
organization performs. If your organization has complex processes and inter-
dependencies, you may want to formally define recovery operations in the
context of Service Level Agreements.
The sections in the SLA Toolkit are
 Introduction
 Scope of Work
 Performance, Tracking, and Reporting
 Problem Management
 Compensation
 Customer Duties and Responsibilities
 Warranties and Remedies
 Security
 Intellectual Property Rights and Confidential Information
 Legal Compliance and Resolution of Disputes
311
Chapter 14: Ten Disaster Recovery Planning Tools

 Termination
 General
 Signatures
 Schedules
If your organization already uses SLAs extensively, you probably don’t need
this tool. But if you’re considering SLAs, this tool may help you to better
understand their structure and content.
LBL ContingencyPro Software
www.rothstein.com/data/dr743.htm
This Web-based browser software tool automates the entire business conti-
nuity plan development process and provides an effective method for main-
taining the plan. The software is a knowledge-based system that certified
business continuity planning experts developed.
The knowledge base in this software product contains best practices for busi-
ness continuity planning, as well as hundreds of electronic tools, guides, tem-
plates, and samples. These systems are fully integrated with the Microsoft
Office Suite, so you should be able to use them easily and intuitively. The
software is based on a proven methodology that has successfully helped
organizations recover from actual disaster events.

Ten Essentials for Disaster
Planning Success
In This Chapter
 Creating a successful DR plan
 Understanding why you’re never done with a DR project
 Trying your luck (or not)
You need to understand many factors that lead to a successful project
and disaster recovery plan before you begin a DR project. I start with
executive sponsorship, which is probably the most vital factor. Then I cover
other up-front formalities so your organization can understand the level 
of effort you need from the DR planning team to complete a successful 
DR project.
Executive Sponsorship
As go its leaders, so goes the organization.
An organization undertakes disaster recovery planning because company
shareholders want the organization to survive through difficult times, includ-
ing disasters that threaten its very existence. A DR project needs executive
sponsorship in two key areas:
 Prioritization of key subject matter experts: Disaster recovery planning
requires the best and brightest minds in the organization. You need the
employees who are the most familiar with business operations to per-
form the Business Impact Analysis and risk analysis, as well as develop
disaster recovery procedures. They also need to perform walkthroughs,
simulations, and parallel/cutover testing.
Without executive sponsorship, these individuals are pulled in too many
directions at the same time, which can threaten to stall the entire effort.

 Spending priorities: You need executive sponsorship to ensure that you
can improve IT systems to support established Recovery Time Objectives
(RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs). You may need significant
investments in IT systems, infrastructure, and software.
Well-Defined Scope
Before a DR project can get under way, you need to define the precise scope
of the project. Spell out exactly which business processes are in and which
are out.
You can best define the scope and other key points of your DR project in a
charter document. A charter is a formal document that defines the project 
as follows:
 Project definition: A statement, usually not exceeding a paragraph or
two, that describes the project at a high level. A generic definition for a
DR project might be something like, “Determine the priority of key busi-
ness processes, including their Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD),
Recovery Time Objective (RTO), and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).
Define and fund necessary capital improvements in IT systems, and
develop and test recovery procedures.”
 Executive sponsors: The names of the executives who are sponsoring
the project. These individuals are responsible for allocating resources
(staff and budget) to support the DR project. They commit to its comple-
tion according to the key milestones that the charter defines.
 Project objectives: The desired outcomes from the project.
 Project scope: Defines which parts of the business you include in the
project and which parts you don’t. When you complete this project suc-
cessfully, you can start new DR projects that include other parts of the
business.
 Key milestones: Dates by which you want to accomplish key milestones.
Here are some sample dates:
• Sept 30, 2009: Business Impact Analysis completed.
• March 30, 2010: Recovery procedures completed.
• June 30, 2010: Recovery procedures tested.
 Key responsibilities: Key individuals who have specific responsibilities
through the entire project.
 Sources of funding: There’s no such thing as a free lunch. Where do you
plan to get the money for this DR project?
324
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

 Signatures: The signatures of the executive sponsors, as well as other
key individuals named in the charter. Include the department heads
from all departments whose resources you need for the project.
Make the charter a public document within the organization. Announce the
DR project and make the charter available for reference.
Committed Resources
A DR project without people to work towards its objectives isn’t a DR project
at all, but only an idea. Ideas — even good ones — can’t save the business if
disaster strikes, and the organization can’t benefit if the DR project doesn’t
get any resources.
Management needs to make specific commitments of specific resources and
adjust certain named individuals’ time and priorities. For instance, manage-
ment may need to define a certain numbers of hours per week or percentage
of hours worked by DR team members so the project can make the desired
amount of forward progress. For instance, you could define the priorities for
a system engineer’s time like this:
 First priority: Critical system outages
 Second priority: Top-priority service requests
 Third priority: Disaster recovery procedure development
 Fourth priority: Medium-priority service requests
The preceding list may be a little simplistic, but these kinds of priorities — in
writing — help staff members make task decisions without constant manage-
ment guidance.
If staff members account for their time in weekly status reports, they should
include time spent on the DR project so you can track the actual effort
required to sustain the project.
The Right Experts
The ultimate success of your DR project rests in the accuracy and complete-
ness of all the disaster recovery procedures. Those staff members and man-
agers who are most familiar with critical business processes and the IT
systems that support them need to develop and test the DR procedures.
325
Chapter 16: Ten Essentials for Disaster Planning Success

If you place recovery procedure development in less capable hands, you end
up with lower quality recovery procedures that take more time to review and
improve. You’ll need more time to get the project to a point at which you
have adequate recovery plans.
Management needs to determine when to bring in consultants, primarily for
their expertise, but also for their ability to augment the DR plan development
effort.
Time to Develop the Project Plan
You need to plan any sizeable project in detail. By any measure, a DR project
is a sizeable project: It requires participation from many people in different
departments, and it needs to be successful.
You must identify every task required to complete the project, and identify
and quantify all necessary resources — who, how much time, and how much
funding you need, as well as dependencies between tasks. Only after you
manage these details can you track the DR project week by week and manage
it as a real project.
If you launch a DR project before you develop a plan, executive management
can’t put much faith in the stated milestones. Don’t put a stake in the ground
and declare that you’ll complete the project by a specific date before you
know whether that date is realistic. Your project’s outcome may be compro-
mised — it’s either of poor quality or late.
Remember this saying: Good, fast, or cheap — pick any two.
Support from All Stakeholders
A DR project requires support not only from IT, but also from line managers,
middle managers, and executive managers in the departments that operate
critical processes. Other departments that may play a part in DR planning
include
 Project Management Office (PMO), if such a department exists and man-
ages enterprise-wide projects
 Human Resources (HR)
 Facilities
 Finance or Accounting
 Legal
326
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

 Security
 External Affairs, or whoever’s responsible for communications to cus-
tomers or shareholders
Define support from every key department in writing and include those defin-
itions in the DR project charter described in the section “Well-Defined
Scope,” earlier in this chapter, and in Chapter 1. Require the department
heads from every department that manages resources the DR project to 
sign the charter, as well.
Testing, Testing, Testing
A disaster recovery plan that you haven’t tested is worth only the paper that
you write it on (or the hard drive that you store it on). Until you thoroughly
test all the recovery procedures, the organization shouldn’t expect those 
procedures to save it from ruin if a disaster strikes.
You need to perform five types of testing on all disaster recovery procedures:
 Paper: An individual reads through a recovery procedure and makes any
annotations or suggested corrections.
 Walkthrough: A recovery team reviews the recovery procedure, step by
step. Issues and discussions fill the day.
 Simulation: A recovery team walks through a scripted simulation, dis-
cussing assessment and recovery procedures so they can determine
whether a disaster recovery plan is reasonable.
 Parallel: A recovery team tests recovery procedures by actually building
or setting up recovery systems. The team also performs test transactions
on the systems to see how well the procedures work and whether team
members can actually build and operate the recovery systems.
 Cutover: A recovery team performs a full cutover, in which recovery sys-
tems that the recovery team build or prepare on short notice support
live business processes. This is the ultimate test of a DR plan.
I cover testing fully in Chapter 10.
Full Lifecycle Commitment
You aren’t finished with the DR project when you successfully complete the
last test. That’s only the end of the first trip around the lifecycle. You must
perpetually commit to the following DR plan activities:
327
Chapter 16: Ten Essentials for Disaster Planning Success

 Periodic testing: Test all DR procedures regularly, according to a sched-
ule that fits the risks associated with the individual business processes
being supported. For example, life-support processes probably deserve
weekly or monthly cutover testing, but you can test less critical processes
less often. This testing process includes not only repeated walkthroughs,
but also scheduled simulations, parallel tests, and cutover tests. You
should perform a parallel or cutover test at least once per year.
 Periodic review: Have subject matter experts review disaster recovery
procedures at least two to four times each year to ensure that those pro-
cedures are still relevant and accurate. Review emergency contact lists
monthly.
 Periodic revisions: Periodic testing and review indicate when you need
to update recovery plans and emergency contact lists.
 Business Impact Analysis and risk analysis review: Review the BIA and
risk analysis documents at least once per year to ensure that key objec-
tives, such as the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point
Objective (RPO), are still adequate.
 Integration into business processes: Business activities such as system
upgrades, mergers and acquisitions, and new product or service
launches should include routine reviews of BIA, risk analysis, and other
DR documents to ensure that they remain current and relevant.
Integration into Other Processes
Don’t make DR planning an island that you visit only now and again. If your
organization considers disaster recovery planning a one-off or overlay, it’s
short-changing itself and missing opportunities to improve its DR plans. DR
must become a way of life for many in the organization.
Several business processes should automatically include review of and possi-
ble revisions to the BIA (Business Impact Analysis), risk analysis, and disas-
ter recovery procedures:
 Major application upgrade or migration: Any time you upgrade an IT
application that supports a critical business process or migrate that
application to a new platform, you should, at the very least, review and
update disaster recovery procedures, as needed. During a migration to a
new IT application, you may also need to revise the BIA and risk analy-
sis. A major upgrade or migration project should include review and
revisions to DR documents; otherwise, the organization may wait far too
long to upgrade these documents. If a disaster occurs before you upgrade
your DR documents, you drastically reduce your ability to recover those
systems.
328
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

 Business relocation: If the business changes locations or adds more
office space in the same or a different city, you need to revisit recovery
plans to make sure they’re still valid.
 Merger or acquisition: If another organization acquires your organiza-
tion, or your organization acquires another organization or merges with
an organization, the fundamental mission and financial profile for the
organization changes considerably. You need to conduct a top-down
revision to the entire DR plan, starting with the BIA and risk analysis,
and continuing with revisions to all recovery procedures.
 Changing market conditions: Fundamental changes in the market, such
as the entry or exit of a major competitor or a change in the structure of
the market, call for a reassessment of the Business Impact Analysis and
risk assessment. You may also need to make revisions to recovery 
procedures.
 New service or product launch: In addition to requiring disaster recov-
ery capabilities, a new service or product launch may reposition other
business processes, making some more important and others less
important. You may have to deal with fundamental changes in your 
organization’s investment in recovery capabilities.
 Change in senior or executive management: Changes in upper manage-
ment sometimes lead to strategic changes in direction. Document any
such changes and analyze their impact on the existing BIA and risk
assessments.
Luck
Wiktionary defines luck as, “Something that happens to someone by chance,
a chance occurrence.”
The role of luck in disaster recovery planning deals with whether your orga-
nization experiences a disaster that threatens its survival. And your organiza-
tion is pretty lucky if no disaster occurs, at least until you complete your 
DR plan.
Seneca, the Roman dramatist, supposedly said, “Luck is what happens when
preparation meets opportunity.” The preparation involves your DR planning,
which gets you ready to face the opportunity of a disaster. And yes, I do mean
opportunity. Disasters and other difficulties give you opportunities for 
greatness.
This quote from Edna Mote in the Disney film The Incredibles says it all: “Luck
favors the prepared, darling.”

N
ASA’s work over the past forty years has supposedly led to the develop-
ment of everyday products and services that millions of people enjoy
today. Similarly, organizations that undertake disaster recovery planning
enjoy a number of spin-off benefits that help the organization, even if a 
disaster never occurs.
Improved Chances of Surviving 
“The Big One”
No organization is immune from the effects of natural and man-made disas-
ters. The only question is, does the organization invest in processes and 
systems that can assure its survival from any disaster?
Although I can’t guarantee that every organization with a solid DR plan can
survive any disaster, an organization with a DR plan is far more likely to sur-
vive than an organization that doesn’t have such a plan. Contingency Planning
and Management Magazine indicated that 40 percent of companies that had
to shut down for three days or more failed within 36 months. This statistic
should remind you that failure in your DR planning isn’t an option.

A Rung or Two Up the Maturity Ladder
Carnegie Mellon University measures the maturity of business processes by
using the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), developed by Carnegie Mellon’s
Software Engineering Institute (SEI).
The CMM has five levels. According to the SEI, “Predictability, effectiveness,
and control of an organization’s software processes are believed to improve
as the organization moves up these five levels. While not rigorous, the empiri-
cal evidence to date supports this belief.”
Here are the CMM’s five levels:
 Level 1 — Initial: Processes are usually ad hoc. You don’t even write
them down, or you document them in informal ways. The organization
abandons processes in times of stress. Success in the organization
depends on heroics, not processes.
 Level 2 — Repeatable: You more formally document processes and can
repeat those processes, even in times of stress. You manage projects by
using project plans.
 Level 3 — Defined: You establish and improve processes over time.
Processes drive consistency throughout the organization. Processes 
are only qualitatively predictable.
 Level 4 — Quantitatively managed: You establish, periodically improve,
and measure processes. You also establish objectives for process perfor-
mance. Process performance is quantitatively predictable.
 Level 5 — Optimizing: Incremental improvements and technology inno-
vation improve processes. You can set process improvement objectives.
You can address and measure causes of process variations, instead of
simply considering those variations aberrations.
For more information about the Capability Maturity Model, check out www.
sei.cmu.edu/cmmi.
Opportunities for Process Improvements
Disaster recovery planning puts the microscope to the processes and proce-
dures that support the most critical activities in an organization. Throughout
the process of analyzing and developing disaster recovery plans for a process,
you may experience one or more instances of, “Hey, we can be doing this
better!”
332
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

The activities in which you most likely find process improvements are
 Business Impact Analysis (BIA): Analysts take a close look at a business
process to determine its participants, critical assets and systems that
support the process, critical suppliers, and how you measure and
manage the process. Indeed, a business process may get its closest
scrutiny during a BIA. If the people performing the BIA are trained to
look for improvement opportunities, they’ll find them.
 Risk analysis: During the BIA, analysts seek and identify process risk
areas, and they look for ways to reduce the risks that they find. Analysts
probably identify the most significant improvements to processes and
architecture during this process.
 Recovery plan development: When you develop the actual recovery
procedures for a process, you need to take a very close look at that
process and how it’s performed in normal situations. If you’re paying
attention, you might find flaws or opportunities for improvement in the
process you’re working with.
 Recovery plan walkthroughs: Staff members who perform walkthroughs
may, as they ponder and discuss individual steps in recovery proce-
dures, discover opportunities for improving day-to-day processes 
and procedures. You might hear someone say, “If we do this in a recov-
ery procedure, we can do that during normal periods and save time (or
money, mistakes, and so on).”
 Simulations, parallel tests, and cutover tests: While performing actual
recovery procedures in testing exercises, staff members may make cru-
cial discoveries about the ways in which your organization performs
processes, thus finding ways to optimize processes and reduce mistakes.
One of the reasons that you need a scribe or record keeper during tests
is to capture these opportunities.
Opportunities for Technology
Improvements
One of the objectives of disaster recovery planning is to make systems more
resilient so you can reduce disasters related to flaws in systems and architec-
tures. When the DR planning team performs the Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
and establishes key metrics, including the Maximum Tolerable Downtime
(MTD), Recovery Time Objective (RTO), and Recovery Point Objective (RPO),
team members can make key decisions to improve the architecture of IT sys-
tems so your organization can meet these objectives.
333
Chapter 17: Ten Benefits of DR Planning

Higher Quality and Availability 
of Systems
One of the objectives of disaster recovery planning is to improve the resiliency
of the IT systems that support the organization’s most critical business
processes. When you establish key time-related objectives, such as the
Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO), the 
DR project team should make improvements in the IT systems and infrastruc-
ture that support those critical business processes. Here are the changes you
can make:
 Improve storage systems, including RAID, mirroring, replication, and
better backups.
 Improve servers, including greater server consistency.
 Improve hardware, including redundant power supplies.
 Establish or improve the change management process to better manage
changes that you make to servers and infrastructure.
 Establish or improve configuration management capabilities to better
track changes that you make to systems and other components.
 Establish or improve server cluster utilization.
 Establish or improve power management systems, including
Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs) and generators.
Reducing Disruptive Events
One of the objectives of disaster recovery planning is to improve the resiliency
of the IT systems that support critical business processes. This improved
resiliency leads to fewer disruptions of those business processes when these
events occur:
 Hard drive failure: No problem, you have one of these contingencies:
• You have RAID technology now and will replace the hard drive
during the next maintenance period.
• You have on-site spares.
• You can recover from backups.
• The other server in the cluster can take over operations.
334
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

 Power supply failure: No problem, either
• You have systems with redundant power supplies.
• The other server in the cluster can take over operations.
 Short power outage: No problem, the UPS takes over instantaneously
and can support critical systems and HVAC for up to 30 minutes.
 Extended power outage: No problem, the UPS takes over instanta-
neously, and the electric generator starts momentarily and can supply
power for up to two days. After that, you can get deliveries of fuel, if
needed.
 Fire in the data center: Quite a problem, but you have options:
• You can recover data in your alternate processing center tomorrow.
• Servers in the alternate processing center can take over 
momentarily.
Which option you choose depends on how quickly you need those
recovery servers to be on-line.
 Earthquake: Quite a problem, but you can set up one of two plans:
• You can recover data in your alternate processing center tomorrow.
• Servers in the alternate processing center can take over 
momentarily.
 Your disaster scenario: Your systems architecture provides a defined
level of resilience, and your recovery procedures can guide you to a pre-
dictable recovery well within established timelines.
When these disruptive events occur, your organization can survive them
because you developed response and recovery plans that get your critical
systems back online in whatever timelines you establish.
Reducing Insurance Premiums
If your organization has purchased one or more policies that insure the orga-
nization against the losses associated with disasters, the insurance company
that issues the premium probably offers discounts if you take certain mea-
sures to reduce the likelihood and impact of common disaster scenarios.
Having an insurance policy against disasters is an essential part of the overall
plan because your organization may need the infusion of cash such a policy
provides to get you through the events that unfold in a disaster. But you need
the preparation and resilience that you develop during the DR project just as
much.
335
Chapter 17: Ten Benefits of DR Planning

Finding Out Who Your Leaders Are
A vital part of the disaster recovery planning lifecycle involves testing disaster
response and recovery procedures. When you involve all the key personnel in
testing, you may find some of the results pleasantly surprising:
 Simulation testing: Sequester the recovery team for a day or longer, and
put them through their paces in a realistic disaster scenario. The partici-
pants perform the procedures, starting with disaster declaration and
continuing with emergency communications, disaster assessment, 
and commencement of recovery operations. Throughout this exercise,
you may witness the natural leadership abilities of one or more people
as they go through the paces.
 Parallel testing: In this challenging endeavor, the disaster response
team follows procedures to get recovery systems up and running. This
test isn’t easy: The team has to deal with problems and challenges that
no one anticipated during walkthrough testing. Often, the entire team
needs to cooperate to overcome these barriers. Stress and challenge
provide opportunities for leadership: Natural leaders step up and help
the entire team successfully complete its objectives.
 Cutover testing: This is the most stressful DR test because recovery sys-
tems actually support critical business processes. In this DR test, failure
or delay isn’t an option. If you have any born leaders on the team, you
may see their leadership in action as the team pushes through the barri-
ers together to get recovery systems running and supporting the 
business.
I cover DR testing in Chapter 10.
Complying with Standards 
and Regulations
Disaster recovery planning has historically been an optional endeavor for
organizations that develop the will to survive a disaster. Increasingly, disaster
recovery planning has progressed from being a good idea to being required
by standards and regulations.
These common standards require a measure of business continuity planning
and disaster recovery planning:
 PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): Version 1.1
of PCI states in section 12.9.1, “Create the incident response plan to 
be implemented in the event of system compromise. Ensure the plan
336
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

addresses, at a minimum, specific incident response procedures, busi-
ness recovery and continuity procedures, data backup processes, roles
and responsibilities, and communication and contact strategies (for
example, informing the Acquirers and credit card associations).” (The
emphasis is mine.)
 HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): HIPAA’s
Security Rule contains many requirements to protect electronic patient
health information (EPHI) from unauthorized access. HIPAA also requires
the availability of EPHI (to health care workers when needed), including
a disaster recovery plan to ensure its availability. Section 164.308(a)(7)(i)
includes the following language:
“Standard: Contingency plan. Establish (and implement as needed)
policies and procedures for responding to an emergency or other
occurrence (for example, fire, vandalism, system failure, and nat-
ural disaster) that damages systems that contain electronic pro-
tected health information.”
Section 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(B) specifies how you must carry out this
requirement:
“Implementation specifications:
(A) Data backup plan (Required). Establish and implement proce-
dures to create and maintain retrievable exact copies of electronic
protected health information.
(B) Disaster recovery plan (Required). Establish (and implement
as needed) procedures to restore any loss of data.
(C) Emergency mode operation plan (Required). Establish (and
implement as needed) procedures to enable continuation of criti-
cal business processes for protection of the security of electronic
protected health information while operating in emergency mode.
(D) Testing and revision procedures (Addressable). Implement pro-
cedures for periodic testing and revision of contingency plans.
(E) Applications and data criticality analysis (Addressable). Assess
the relative criticality of specific applications and data in support
of other contingency plan components.”
 ISO27001: Section A.14 of this internationally known standard for infor-
mation security management contains five distinct requirements for the
establishment and testing of business continuity and disaster recovery
plans.
Other regulations dealing with data privacy and protection imply the need for
disaster recovery planning as a means to protect information from corruption
and loss. Over time, I believe national, regional, and state/provincial laws in
many countries will include more requirements concerning disaster recovery
planning.

Competitive Advantage
Organizations are locked in an endless competitive struggle against their
peers in the marketplace. Because more organizations are going global and
adopting just-in-time processes that require continuous availability and ser-
vice levels, organizations need to always be available and functioning.
Even though businesses need to be more and more available, disasters con-
tinue to occur, many of which you have no control over. Organizations that
become more resilient do so through disaster recovery planning and busi-
ness continuity planning.
Organizations that have mature DR plans can truly say to their customers,
“We will be there for you, whenever you need us, even if a disaster strikes.
You can rely on us — no matter what.” Thus, disaster recovery can become
one more competitive differentiator. Organizations with strong DR plans can
say, “We are better than our competitors because we have DR plans that will
make us available in any circumstance.”
