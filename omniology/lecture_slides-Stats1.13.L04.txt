Example: Wine ratings 
•  Suppose that 100 wine experts rated the 
overall quality of different wines on a scale 
of 1 to 100  
– Higher scores indicate higher quality 
Example: Wine ratings 
•  Consider the red wines, which country had 
the highest average (mean) rating? 
Example: Wine ratings (Reds) 
Country 
Mean = M = (ΣX) / N  
 
Argentina 
66.73 
Australia 
81.76 
France 
70.97 
USA 
76.38 
Example: Wine ratings 
•  Now consider the white wines, which 
country had the highest average (mean) 
rating?

Example: Wine ratings 
•  The mean is a measure of central 
tendency 
Measures of central tendency 
•  Measure of central tendency: A measure 
that describes the middle or center point of 
a distribution 
  
– A good measure of central tendency is 
representative of the distribution 
Measures of central tendency 
•  Mean: the average, M = (ΣX) / N  
•  Median: the middle score (the score below 
which 50% of the distribution falls) 
•  Mode: the score that occurs most often

Measures of central tendency 
•  Mean (average) is the best measure of 
central tendency when the distribution is 
normal  
– Red wine ratings 
– Another example: Grade Point Average (GPA) 
Measures of central tendency 
•  Median (middle score) is preferred when 
there are extreme scores in the distribution 
– White wine ratings? 
– Another example: Household income in USA

Measures of central tendency 
•  Mode is the score that occurs most often 
– The peak of a histogram 
– The rating that occurred the most 
•  For example, the Argentina white, Mode = 70 – 72  
Measures of central tendency 
•  Mode can be used for nominal variables 
– For example, names 
•  Female, USA  
 
 Sophia 
•  Male, USA  
 
 
 
 James 
•  Female, France
  
 
 
 Emma 
•  Male, France

Measures of variability

Variability 
•  A measure that describes the range and 
diversity of scores in a distribution 
– Standard deviation (SD): the average 
deviation from the mean in a distribution 
– Variance = SD2 
Variability 
•  Variance = SD2 
SD2 = [Σ(X - M)2] / N	

Variance 
•  Variation is natural and observed in all 
species and that’s good: 
– On the Origin of Species (1859) 
– Variation Under Domestication (1868)

Summary statistics: Review 
•  Important concepts 
– Central tendency (mean, median, mode) 
– Variability (standard deviation and variance) 
Summary statistics: Review 
•  Summary statistics (formulae to know) 
– M = (ΣX) / N 
– SD2 = [Σ(X - M)2] / N 
•  Used for descriptive statistics 
– SD2 = [Σ(X - M)2] / (N – 1) 
•  Used for inferential statistics
