Evidence-based teaching – lessons you can 
learn from psychology for your teaching 
practice
Although it is quite difficult to define what teaching is and what it is not 
(Hanke 2012), the first chapters of this book have already drawn attention 
to a commonly held consensus, namely that teaching is supposed to help 
someone learn (Collins 2018). For this reason, teaching should always be 
based on considerations about learning (Bachmann 2003, Hanke 2008, 
Hanke & Winandy 2014): How is information stored in the brain? Which 
cognitive processes take place while learning? How is information pro-
cessed? How are information and new skills integrated in a sustainable 
manner into an individual’s knowledge and cognitive structure? And 
last but not the least, how are these skills and information recalled? The 
answers to these questions are the basis for a student-centred teaching 
strategy, i.e. to teach in such a way that it helps students learn.
MOMBI 2.0 is an attempt to create a teaching strategy systematically, us-
ing findings from the learning sciences and neuroscience. MOMBI is an 
acronym for Model Of Model-Based Instruction. MOMBI 2.0 is an updat-
ed version of MOMBI that Hanke developed in 2008. This chapter pre-
sents MOMBI 2.0 as a student-oriented teaching strategy that takes the 
shift from teaching to learning seriously (see Chapter 1).
In a first step, this chapter describes the fundamentals of MOMBI 2.0 ac-
cording to findings from cognitive psychology and learning sciences, to-
gether with relevant results from the neurosciences concerning the role 
of motivation and emotions. Then, the consequences of these consider-
ations are discussed and synthesised in MOMBI 2.0. In addition, specific 
teaching methods and tools will be explained in terms of their practical 
application, thereby enabling teachers to use MOMBI in their classes.

5.1	
Learning and its conditions
The idea of MOMBI 2.0 is to use knowledge about learning to come up 
with clear suggestions for teaching. The basic assumption of MOMBI 2.0 
is that learning is a process of constructing new knowledge and skills in 
a highly individual manner; this ideally occurs in a relaxed and positive 
environment. The process of learning can be described in more detail as 
six subprocesses. In order to implement a relaxed and positive learning 
environment, the need for autonomy, social relatedness and competence 
also have to be satisfied. For an overview, see Figure 1. This model will be 
elaborated in subsequent sections of this chapter.

Figure 1  Subprocesses of learning in a positive learning environment.
According to Piaget (1976), learning is provoked by a mental disequilibri-
um, i.e. situations that individuals encounter as puzzling or inexplicable 
(subprocess 1: provocation of mental disequilibrium). The provocation 
can be one or all of the following:
•	 questions that learners cannot answer and/or
•	 statements or information that they do not understand and/or
Inhalt_Competence_Oriented_Teaching_1A_18.indd   110
25.07.2018   12:06:43

111
•	 visual, auditory or even tactile perceptions that irritate them. 
Curiosity, therefore, causes people to learn, because curiosity is the natu-
ral and innate motor of learning (Kang et al. 2009, Jäncke 2013). 
A study by Kang et al. (2009) showed that asking students questions at 
the beginning of a lesson attracted their attention and supported learn-
ing new content in an effective way. Evidently, these questions stimulat-
ed their curiosity and, in order to satisfy that curiosity, they were willing 
to make the necessary effort to learn because they had a goal: they want-
ed to find out the answers.
Since human beings prefer to be in a state of equilibrium, a disequilibri-
um causes discomfort and leads to mental activation (Seel 1991, Wittrock 
1990); individuals begin to think about what they have perceived and 
what possible answers or reactions would be helpful in this situation. In 
this way, individuals activate – quasi automatically – their prior knowl-
edge to re-establish their mental equilibrium (subprocess 2: activation 
of prior knowledge). Re-establishing the equilibrium is the goal that 
drives them (subprocess 3: goal setting).
When they do not come up with a plausible answer or solution, human 
beings start searching for the missing information (Dreistadt 1969, Seel 
1991). They ask someone, they search for information on the internet or 
read a book, etc. (subprocess 4: search for information).
While searching, they try to integrate the new information into their ex-
isting cognitive structure and stop searching when this integration pro-
cess is successful (Seel 1991), i.e. when the state of equilibrium has been 
re-established. This is the moment when they have the impression that 
they have found the answer or solution or that they can explain the for-
merly irritating situation (subprocess 5: integration).
If individuals value the new information or if the new information touch-
es them emotionally, they will elaborate on it (Wellenreuther 2012, Hattie 
2013). This means that they will think or talk about it, they will do further 
exercises or memorise it, i.e. they will stay busy with the new informa-
Inhalt_Competence_Oriented_Teaching_1A_18.indd   111
25.07.2018   12:06:43

112
tion or skill (subprocess 6: elaboration). This is why emotionally en-
riched information is remembered more easily.
Summing up, the underlying assumptions of MOMBI 2.0 are:
•	 Learning is provoked by an irritating situation, which puts individuals 
in a state of mental disequilibrium. 
•	 In order to re-establish their mental equilibrium, individuals begin to 
activate their prior knowledge, because they have set a goal to re-estab-
lish their mental equilibrium. 
•	 If their existing knowledge is not sufficient, they begin to search for 
the missing information and carry on searching until they are able to 
integrate the new information into their existing structure. This is the 
moment of the purported click of comprehension. 
•	 If the new information seems important to the individuals, they begin 
to elaborate on it to retain it – and never forget or unlearn it. 
After individuals have successfully passed through all these subpro-
cesses, they have changed their cognitive structures. Learning has taken 
place. 
Learning processes in the manner described above are hampered in emo-
tionally negative contexts. There is evidence that learning is more suc-
cessful in emotionally positive learning environments. Negative feelings, 
such as anxiety or fear, inhibit learning (Shakman et al. 2006), because 
– innately – human reactions to fear are fight or flight. Although human 
beings have the capacity to react in various ways, fear puts them under 
stress; the first thing they do in a stressful situation is to find ways to 
reduce that stress. This search for stress reduction calls up all the cog-
nitive capacities, which means that there are hardly any capacities left 
for elaborating on academic content. Human beings in a state of fear 
automatically direct their attention to the source of the fear and not to 
the academic content that should be learned. Therefore, it is important 
to create learning situations that promote positive emotions. Students 
need learning environments in which they feel free to think and learn, in 
which they are confident that they are respected – even if they make mis-
Inhalt_Competence_Oriented_Teaching_1A_18.indd   112
25.07.2018   12:06:43

113
takes – and in which they can use all their cognitive capacities to engage 
in learning. Myths such as “learning takes best place under pressure” or 
“students are supposed to fear teachers – if they don’t, they won’t respect 
the teachers” are nonsense (for a deconstruction of this myth, see Ulrich 
2016).
However, what are the characteristics of positive learning environments? 
Pondering on this question, it is helpful to consider the self-determina-
tion theory of Deci and Ryan (1993). This theory assumes that – when 
primary and secondary needs, such as the need for food and shelter, 
are satisfied – individuals have three basic needs: the need for autono-
my, the need for social relatedness and the need for competence. When 
these three needs are satisfied, individuals feel good and motivated. For 
this reason, teachers should make sure to satisfy these needs of their stu-
dents during the entire teaching process. Self-directed learning, collabo-
rative learning arrangements and competence orientation are decisive in 
satisfying these needs.
Another important finding to consider for teaching is that individuals 
remember highly emotional content better than neutrally-presented in-
formation (Jäncke 2013, 2014), because the emotional aspects represent 
something with which the new information can be connected. The more 
connections a knowledge chunk has in the cognitive and neuronal struc-
ture, the easier it is to activate this structure or chunk later on (Beck 2015, 
Jäncke 2014). 
5.2	
Consequences for teaching
Considering the six steps of the learning process, six complementary 
teaching interventions are suggested (see MOMBI 2.0 in Figure 2). Each of 
these teaching interventions is supposed to provoke or support precisely 
one of the subprocesses of learning. In addition, MOMBI 2.0 integrates – 
as a basis for positive and motivating learning environments – the three 
environmental aspects associated with the three needs that have to be 
satisfied.

The next sections of this chapter present the six teaching interventions, 
together with methods and tools for their implementation. This is fol-
lowed by an explanation of the three environmental aspects, an elabora-
tion of various ideas associated with them and a description of how these 
environmental aspects can be met. 
5.2.1	
Teaching interventions 
In the following sections, the six teaching interventions of MOMBI 2.0 
are presented, and examples of tools and methods are explained. Figure 3 
summarises possible teaching methods for each intervention.
5.2.2	
Teaching intervention: emotionally enriched ­provocation
Since learning is provoked by a mental disequilibrium, MOMBI 2.0 sug-
gests (see Figure 2) that teaching should begin with such a provoked 
mental disequilibrium (teaching intervention 1: emotionally enriched 
provocation). This provocation attracts the learners’ attention.
This can be done by piquing the students’ curiosity regarding the learn-
ing content. In natural learning contexts, e.g. when very young children 
learn, it is their curiosity that drives them. Teachers should therefore use 
this opportunity and make their students curious about the learning con-
tent. This activates their relevant neuronal structures. 
Since human beings memorise better when learning content is present-
ed in an emotional way, using provocations that touch the students emo-
tionally can support learning. 
•	 Teachers can, for example, present facts from the learning content that 
the students find new and surprising or that irritate them and make 
them curious,
•	 They can use videos, headlines, pictures/graphics/comics, statements 
or questions,
Inhalt_Competence_Oriented_Teaching_1A_18.indd   115
25.07.2018   12:06:43

116
•	 They can also present problems or case studies or tell students a sto-
ry about themselves or another person with whom the students can 
somehow identify. 
In this way, teachers motivate the students to start working on authentic 
tasks, which is one of the dimensions of excellent teaching and learning 
in higher education (see Chapter 1, Figure 11). Teachers can use anything 
that attracts their students’ attention and touches them emotionally. 
However, teachers have to be careful not to trigger anxiety or fear in stu-
dents. Anxiety and fear also trigger a mental disequilibrium – but this 
disequilibrium provokes stress reduction activities and not the elabora-
tion of cognitive learning strategies.
5.2.3	
Teaching intervention: activation of prior knowledge
Since the activation of prior knowledge is important for learning, MOMBI 
2.0 recommends that the students are asked – as the second teaching in-
tervention – to activate their prior knowledge as regards the provocation 
(teaching intervention 2: activation of prior knowledge).
This teaching intervention can be implemented by asking the students to 
react and respond to the provocation with which they were confronted in 
the first teaching intervention. The teaching interventions “Provocation” 
and “Activation of prior knowledge” are therefore extremely interrelated. 
There is no need for a new question or anything else to that effect. Teach-
ers can use the fact/content of the provocation. 
But teachers can ask the students – in different ways – to react to the 
provocation. It is possible to
•	 ask the entire group and wait for answers,
•	 ask the students to discuss their reactions and answers in buzz 
groups for two to three minutes; this is much more stimulating and 
less-threatening for the majority of students than asking the entire 
group of students,
•	 ask the students to design a mind or concept map,
Inhalt_Competence_Oriented_Teaching_1A_18.indd   116
25.07.2018   12:06:43

117
•	 ask the students to brainstorm,
•	 ask the students to arrange small cards with concepts or questions in 
a reasonable way and to explain the concepts or answer the questions 
that are written on the cards (Macke et al 2016). This activity requires 
the teacher to prepare the cards in advance.
Taking the processes of learning into account, this activation of prior 
knowledge is important. However, it can be quite frustrating when the 
students believe that they do not have sufficient knowledge to re-estab-
lish mental equilibrium. For this reason, it is important that the teaching 
intervention “Activation of prior knowledge” is followed by the teaching 
intervention “Information about learning objectives and their relevance”.
5.2.4	
Teaching intervention: information about learning objec-
tives and their relevance
In order to avoid frustrations as a result of the triggered disequilibri-
um, it is important to present learning objectives to the students at this 
stage of the lesson. It is also important, to explain their relevance in or-
der to re-establish an equilibrium (teaching intervention 3: information 
about learning objectives and their relevance). When students under-
stand the relevance of the learning objectives, they have a reason to pay 
attention during the lesson (see also Chapter 1, Figure 11). 
There are not many possibilities for implementing this teaching inter-
vention, but in order to strengthen the students’ motivation, as well as 
constructive alignment, it is a very important teaching intervention. 
Students need to understand how the design of the lesson, the intended 
learning objectives and the assessment are interrelated. For this reason, 
teachers need to explain to their students (a) what they can learn in the 
lesson and (b) what the relevance of the content and the objectives is. In 
order to ensure that the students understand the relevance of the learn-
ing objectives, it is important to use their language when describing the 
objectives (Arn 2016). An overly technical description will not convince 
the students that the objectives are worth ­pursuing. 
Inhalt_Competence_Oriented_Teaching_1A_18.indd   117
25.07.2018   12:06:43

118
5.2.5	
Teaching intervention: example-based presentation
In order to help students find the information needed to re-establish 
mental equilibrium, the presentation of information is the fourth teach-
ing intervention (teaching intervention 4: example-based presenta-
tion). 
Other than using a traditional presentation to implement this teaching 
intervention, the teacher can present any form of media that contains the 
information the students need for re-establishing their mental equilibri-
um, for example:
•	 texts, 
•	 videos, 
•	 webpages, 
•	 other experts, etc.
Regardless of which media the teachers use, they need to ensure that 
they give the students sufficient examples and learning content that trig-
gers emotions, because emotionally enriched content is better remem-
bered than neutrally presented information (Jäncke 2013, 2014). 
5.2.6	
Teaching intervention: stimulus for reflection
In order to actually re-establish equilibrium, it is not sufficient that stu-
dents hear or read information. They also need to be supported in inte-
grating the new information into their existing cognitive/neuronal struc-
ture. For this reason, it is important to give them stimuli for reflection 
and ask them to actively grapple with the new information. At this stage 
in the teaching and learning process, teachers can ask their students to 
work on authentic tasks either individually or in groups (see also Chap-
ter 1, Figure 11, “initiate group activities”). Examples of activating teaching 
and learning methods include:
•	 asking the students to talk about the new information,
•	 asking them to write it down,
•	 asking them to apply it,
Inhalt_Competence_Oriented_Teaching_1A_18.indd   118
25.07.2018   12:06:44

119
•	 asking them to link it to their own experiences or to examples,
•	 asking them to work on new tasks, problems or cases.
Figure 3 contains more examples of specific teaching methods for this in-
tervention.
This teaching intervention (teaching intervention 4: stimulus for re-
flection) gives teachers an insight into what the students have learned 
and understood. As a type of assessment, this helps teachers to sup-
port their students in their individual learning processes (cf. Chapter 1, 
­Figure 11).
5.2.7	
Teaching intervention: practice
In order to ensure that the new information or skill will be available for 
a longer time, it is important to ask the students to practice (teaching 
intervention 6: practice). For example, teachers should encourage stu-
dents to go more into detail by giving them further exercises and tasks. 
In the daily practice of university teaching, the standard procedure is to 
ask the students to practice during self-study time. If, however, teachers 
have time for this teaching intervention during a lesson, they can use any 
teaching method to actively engage the students in reflecting about the 
subject in question. For this reason, adequate teaching methods for this 
teaching intervention are more or less similar to teaching intervention 5: 
stimulus for reflection.
Figure 3 lists specific teaching methods for the six teaching inter­
ventions.

5.2.8	
Considering emotions in teaching – environmental aspects
As already discussed, learning occurs best in non-fearful situations. 
Therefore, teachers have to create a positive learning environment in 
which students feel comfortable and are able to concentrate on learning. 
As already described, students experience learning environments in pos-
itive ways when their needs for autonomy, social relatedness and compe-
tence are satisfied.
5.2.9	
Various options
In order to ensure student autonomy, it is helpful when teachers of-
fer their students “various options”. This can be done by implementing 
teaching methods that allow students to choose and/or individualise the 
learning process. Methods that allow for choices are the following:
•	 Students select a topic for their presentation (e.g. from a predefined se-
lection by the teacher),
•	 Students choose their partners when they have to work in pairs or 
groups,
•	 Students decide if they want to work alone or in pairs,
•	 Students choose the topic they would like to work on,
•	 Students can determine their own learning pace as often as possible.
The “learning stations” method (Macke et al. 2016) is very effective at of-
fering students a variety of different possibilities to make their own de-
cisions. In order to implement this method, teachers prepare different 
“learning stations”. A learning station consists of information for the stu-
dents to work with, e.g. texts, videos, links etc., together with an accompa-
nying task to expand the information. Teachers can also use assignments 
that are similar to exam questions. This helps the students assess their 
own strengths and weaknesses, and the teachers can help them to “over-
come learning obstacles”, as mentioned in Figure 11 in Chapter 1. 
During the lesson, the students are asked to move from one station to 
the next, solving the tasks. The students are allowed to work at their own 
Inhalt_Competence_Oriented_Teaching_1A_18.indd   121

122
pace, which is a big advantage of this method. They can also choose the 
tasks that are most relevant to them in order to reach the learning objec-
tives. In this setting, the teacher can act as a coach and support students 
individually. 
The challenge of this teaching method is the task preparation. This is 
quite time consuming. However, as soon as the tasks are prepared, they 
can easily be reused in other teaching contexts.
In addition to the “learning stations” teaching method, any method 
that enables the students to work on their own gives them autonomy. 
Standard teacher presentations, however, limit the students’ autonomy 
­significantly.
5.2.10	 Respect and interaction
In order to satisfy the need for social relatedness, it is important to give 
students opportunities to interact with each other and their teachers. 
All types of group work help support interaction between the students 
(see Chapter 1, Figure 11 “stimulating group work”). Teachers need to en-
sure that students do not feel isolated – even in a very large class. Teach-
ers should always give students an opportunity to talk in class. Even if 
not every student appreciates this, it signals that the teachers are inter-
ested in what the students have to say.
For example, the teachers can ask the students to discuss the key mes­
sages of a specific lecture in pairs and write them down within a short 
period of time (e.g. between 2 and 10 minutes). The teachers can also 
ask their learners to define or structure the presented concepts in pairs. 
These exchanges, whereby students discuss questions or tasks in a short 
period of time with a partner, are called buzz groups.
When students have prepared texts or the teachers have just demonstrat-
ed a specific skill, the students can be asked to apply the insights they 
gained in problem-solving or group discussions.

123
These ways of stimulating students enable them to talk and communi-
cate so that they feel socially related.
Furthermore, when teachers show interest in their work while they 
are working in pairs or groups, and when teachers become involved in 
their discussions, the effect of feeling socially related will be even more 
­significant.
Another way in which teachers can satisfy the students’ need for social 
relatedness is to extend opportunities for interactions between the teach-
ers and the students, as well as between the students themselves. For 
­example,
•	 the teacher can enter the classroom a few minutes before the lesson 
begins. This shows the students that the teacher is prepared and that 
the teacher is really interested in teaching them. It is a sign of respect,
•	 the teacher can use the time before the lesson begins to engage in 
small talk with the students; the teacher can also give them an oppor-
tunity to talk to him/her,
•	 the teacher can also invite the students to ask questions not only dur-
ing class time but also before and after the lesson,
•	 the teacher can also explicitly communicate his/her office hours and 
contact information to the students. This is another indicator that 
makes the students feel the teacher is interested in them and also in 
their learning.
Another suggestion is to ask the students for honest feedback and to take 
their feedback seriously. This does not mean that teachers should imple-
ment everything that their students ask them; but when students give 
feedback, the teachers should justify why they cannot always comply 
with the students’ requests. Teachers should make a point of having good 
debates when students’ ideas are turned down. Studies show that reg-
ular feedback in both directions results in better learning (Schneider & 
­Preckel 2017).
Teachers could also use the “smiley face method” to generate students’ 
feedback. After about one third of the semester, teachers could ask their 
Inhalt_Competence_Oriented_Teaching_1A_18.indd   123
25.07.2018   12:06:44

124
students at the end of a class to draw a happy smiley face and a sad smi-
ley face on a piece of paper and to add comments – under the smiley fac-
es – about what they have liked and disliked about the classes up to now. 
The teachers then collect these papers and read their students’ com-
ments. In this way, teachers will sense how to proceed with their courses.
By asking for feedback and taking it seriously, the teachers show 
“­respect”. This is very important for creating a positive learning en­
vironment. 
5.2.11	 Adequate difficulty and structure
In order to satisfy the need for competence, it is important that the struc-
ture of the lesson is both adequately difficult and transparent. 
Regarding the entire design of the lesson, teachers must ensure that their 
students are challenged but able to cope. The students must be given 
tasks and exercises that are manageable but at the same time challeng-
ing. Such an approach promotes feelings of success. 
In order to create adequate tasks and exercises, it is very important to 
obtain as much information as possible about the background of the 
students. Teachers must make sure that they know what the students 
are supposed to know. The teachers must also know which skills the stu-
dents are supposed to have. In this way, the teachers can adapt their les-
son designs to the students’ needs and skills.
Furthermore, the students should be given individual tasks and receive 
individual feedback. Teachers should help them recognise their person-
al progress, their strengths and weaknesses and reflect with them about 
their individual professional development (see Chapter 1, Figure 11 “re-
flecting learning processes”).
Teachers can also satisfy the need for competence by orienting the stu-
dents about the semester programme and the individual classes. A writ-
ten plan of the class, to which the teacher refers from time to time, can be 
helpful because it “structures” the session. If teachers refer to this plan 
Inhalt_Competence_Oriented_Teaching_1A_18.indd   124
25.07.2018   12:06:44

125
after every major step in a class and show the students which aspects 
have already been dealt with, the students are able to see their progress 
more clearly.
Evidently, there are a variety of possibilities that help implement a pos-
itive learning environment. Although teachers will not be able to imple-
ment all of them at the same time, they should consider at least a few of 
them in every lesson.

Summary
All in all, when teachers consider the environmental aspects and im-
plement all six teaching interventions mentioned in this chapter, their 
students will learn more effectively and their success will last longer. 
MOMBI 2.0 can therefore be very helpful for focussing on those aspects 
in the learning environment that are important when designing learning 
arrangements that promote learning. Despite the function of MOMBI 2.0 
to structure the learning process, it is, nevertheless, a flexible strategy: 
teachers always have various choices as to how to implement the teach-
ing interventions and how to include the relevant environmental aspects. 
It is not rigid, and lessons can be conducted in very different ways. 
Since MOMBI 2.0 is based on research findings about learning, it meets all 
the dimensions of excellent teaching and learning in higher education, 
which Bachmann recommends in Chapter 1, Figure 11. Lessons that are 
created by taking MOMBI 2.0 into consideration are thereby student-cen-
tred and learning-oriented.
