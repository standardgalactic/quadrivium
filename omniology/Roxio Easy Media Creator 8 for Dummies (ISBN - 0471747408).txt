About the Author
Greg Harvey Ph.D. has authored tons of computer books, the most recent
being Excel 2003 For Dummies and Adobe Acrobat 6 PDF For Dummies. He
started out training business users on how to use IBM personal computers
and their attendant computer software in the rough and tumble days of DOS,
WordStar, and Lotus 1-2-3 in the mid-80s of the last century. After working for
a number of independent training firms, he went on to teach semester-long
courses in spreadsheet and database management software at Golden Gate
University in San Francisco.
His love of teaching has translated into an equal love of writing. For Dummies
books are, of course, his all-time favorites to write because they enable him
to write to his favorite audience, the beginner. They also enable him to use
humor (a key element to success in the training room) and, most delightful
of all, to express an opinion or two about the subject matter at hand.


Dedication
To Chris — my partner and helpmate in all aspects of my life and Shandy, the
newest addition to our family

Introduction
T
he good news is that programs included in Roxio Creator 8 are genuinely
easy to use. The bad news, if there is any, is that because of its nature as
a collection or suite of different applications and tools, you may initially find
it a bit confusing as to which part to turn to get a particular job done. This is
where Roxio Creator 8 For Dummies comes in. This book is designed to make
you familiar with Roxio Creator’s many capabilities and get you up and run-
ning and comfortable with its many features as quickly as possible.
If I had to choose just one word to characterize Roxio Creator 8, it would have
to be versatility because this baby can do almost anything you might want to
do Roxio Creator, you can go from capturing original digital media to editing it
and then using it in a wide array of different projects that you can then output
to disc in a very short time. Because the program’s emphasis is always on
making these processes as easy as can be, you don’t have to worry if you
don’t have any background in working with digital media and have limited 
or even no experience with multimedia editing and design.
I just hope that you find using Roxio Creator 8 to design, build, and burn your
own media projects half as much fun I found writing about them in this book.
I want to congratulate the Roxio/Sonic engineers for providing all of us with a
truly outstanding set of tools with which to transform the sounds and images
of the world around us into memories that we can share with friends and
family alike.
About This Book
Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 For Dummies is meant to be a simple reference to
the major components and features offered in the Roxio Creator 8 Deluxe
Suite (Creator 8 is also available in an Essentials and Standard version). If you
did not choose to invest in this deluxe version of this suite, do not worry as
you will still find you have access to all of the major applications and tools I
cover in the text (just some of the fancier and more advanced options that
are covered will be missing from your menus and dialog boxes).
I have, however, endeavored as much as possible to arrange this reference
material according to the task you want to get done rather than according to

the module that you use in performing it (as you sometimes use the same
module to accomplish multiple tasks). This means that although the chapters
in each part are laid in a logical order, each stands on its own, ready for you
to dig into the information at any point. 
Whenever I could, I have also tried to make the topics within each chapter
stand on their own as well. When there’s just no way around relying upon
some information that’s discussed elsewhere, I include a cross-reference that
gives you the chapter and verse (actually the chapter and section) for where
you can find that related information if you’re of a mind to. 
Use the Contents at a Glance along with the full Table of Contents and Index to
look up the topic of the hour and find out exactly where it is in this compila-
tion of Roxio Creator information. You’ll find that although most topics are
introduced in a conversational manner, I don’t waste much time cutting to the
chase by laying down the main principles at work (usually in bulleted form)
followed by the hard reality of how you do the deed (as numbered steps).
Foolish Assumptions
I’m going to make only one foolish assumption about you and that is that you
have the means to acquire some sort of digital media (be that audio, photos,
or video) and you now want to be able to something with that media (be that
burn the audio into CDs, use the photos in collages, or create video produc-
tions that you can view in your DVD player). I’m not assuming that you have
any experience in creating any of the kinds of projects you’d like to create
with your digital media, so you don’t have to be concerned about your level
of multimedia expertise (or the lack thereof).
As far as your computer hardware and software goes, I’m assuming only that
you have a computer that is robust enough to meet the rather stringent
memory and storage requirements for Roxio Creator 8 and that this machine
is running Windows 2000 or XP and is equipped with a CD-recordable or,
hopefully, a DVD-recordable drive. I am not, however, assuming that you have
access to the other peripherals such as a digital still camera, camcorder,
scanner, DVD recorder, and the like that I describe in the text. If you do have
all these goodies, so much the better, as this enables you to use all of Roxio
Creator’s wonderful features. If not, you can still use the parts of the program
that pertain to kind of system you have.
How This Book Is Organized
Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 For Dummies is divided into five parts. Each part
is organized around a central topic (getting to know Easy Media Creator and
2
Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 For Dummies 

digital media, making data backup discs, audio discs and photo projects, DVD
projects, and the like). All the chapters in each part are then related to some
aspect of performing the central task. In case you’re the least bit curious,
here’s the lowdown on each of the six parts and their chapters and what you
can expect to find there.
Part I: A Bit About Easy Media Creator 8
and Digital Media
This part provides you with an orientation to Easy Media Creator 8’s compo-
nents and capabilities, along with an introduction to the sometimes confusing
world of digital media. 
Chapter 1 is your place to go to find out just what exactly is included in the
Roxio Creator 8 suite. It also introduces you to the Roxio Creator 8 Home, the
central bridge from which you can access all the other applications and tools
in the suite.
Chapter 2 is not to be missed, even by those of you who do not consider
yourselves beginners by any stretch of the imagination. This chapter covers
the world of digital media, including the essential difference between analog
and digital media, the many different types of CD and DVD media and media
formats out there, as well as the different types of digital gear that Roxio
Creator supports. The chapter ends with my advice on the proper treatment
of CD and DVD discs.
Part II: Creating Data CDs
Part II focuses on the important tasks of backing up and organizing your
media files. Chapter 3 takes up the call on how to use the Creator Classic and
Drag-to-Disc modules to compile and burn data backup discs. This chapter
also includes information on how to use the Roxio Backup program to sched-
ule backups so that you’re never at risk for losing invaluable data due to
some computer malfunction.
Chapter 4 covers how to use the Media Manager module to organize, manage,
and backup all the different types of media files (audio, still images, and
video) that you use in your Roxio Creator media projects. It covers tagging
and annotating media files for quick retrieval later using Media Manager’s
Search capability as well.

Introduction

Part III: Creating Audio 
CDs and Photo Projects
This part takes an in-depth look at two of the most popular types of digital
media out there: digital audio and photos. Chapter 5 covers mixing audio
clips that you record and rip from the audio CDs and DVDs you own using
Roxio Creator’s now more powerful than ever Sound Editor.
Chapter 6 turns to the subject of digital photos and how you can use the
PhotoSuite module not only to fix, edit, and enhance them but also to use
them in all sorts of great photo projects including slideshows, photo collages,
calendars, and the like. It concludes by giving you the lowdown on printing
your digital photos as well as sharing them electronically with friends and
family.
Chapters 7 and 8 gives you the blow-by-blow for compiling and burning audio
CDs, MP3/WMA, and DVD Music Discs with the new Music Disc Creator and
then using the Label Creator program to design and print labels for the discs
and inserts for their jewel cases.
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs
Part IV is devoted to the subject of DVD projects. Chapter 9 concentrates on
how to use the Roxio Media Import to acquire all the types of digital media
(audio, photo, and video) that you need for your DVD projects. 
Chapter 10 then covers the use of Roxio Creator’s powerful VideoWave 8
application to design video productions to be used as titles for your DVD pro-
jects. Chapter 11 fills out the part by giving you the lowdown on using the
MyDVD program to construct the titles for your DVD project complete with
interactive menus and then burn the finished project to CD or DVD disc.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Part V contains two chapters that together make up the Part of Tens. Chapter
12 is the place to consult for a concise description of what each major appli-
cation and tool in the Roxio Creator 8 suite can do for you. This chapter also
gives cross references to the appropriate chapters in the book that give you
in-depth information on the use of a particular module.

Chapter 13 highlights what I consider to be the top ten coolest features in the
entire Roxio Creator 8 suite (and, of course, that’s saying a lot when you have
as many features to choose from as you do with this baby).
Icons Used in This Book
The following icons are strategically placed in the margins throughout all the
chapters in this book. Their purpose is to get your attention and each has its
own way of doing that.
This icon denotes some really cool information (in my humble opinion) that
if you pay particular attention to will pay off by making your work just a lot
more enjoyable or productive (or both).
This icon denotes a tidbit that you ought to pay extra attention to; otherwise,
you may end up taking a detour that wastes valuable time.
This icon denotes a tidbit that you ought to pay extra attention to; otherwise,
you’ll be sorry.
This icon denotes a tidbit that makes free use of (oh no!) technical jargon.
You may want to skip these sections (or, at least, read them when no one else
is around).
Where to Go from Here
The question of where to go from here couldn’t be simpler — why off to read
the great Rich Tennant cartoons at the beginning of each of the four parts, of
course. Which chapter you go to after that is a matter of personal interest
and need. Just go for the gold and don’t forget to have some fun while you’re
digging!

oxio Easy Media Creator 8, as you discover in this
part, is not one single program but a collection or
suite of several different application programs and tools
that you can use to create a wide variety of audio, photo,
and video projects. In Chapter 1 of this part, you get intro-
duced to each of the programs and tools you’ll be using
and what they can do for you. Chapter 2 then presents
essential information about the surplus of digital media
and media file formats that you come in contact with as
you create your various media projects. This chapter then
concludes by giving you a rundown of the various pieces
of cool digital gear you can use to play all the great pro-
jects you come up with in Roxio Creator 8, and guidelines
on the proper care of CDs and DVDs.

irst things first: Before you can use your newly installed Roxio Easy
Media Creator 8 suite to go off and create a copy of your favorite
Coldplay audio CD or to burn a DVD of the family’s most recent outing in the
Adirondacks, you’re going to need to know your way around the program. As
you’re about to discover, there’s very little that Roxio Easy Media Creator 8
can’t do when it comes to dealing with all the many types of digital media
that are apt to come your way. 
Better yet, not only is this baby versatile, but it’s as good as its name. The
Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 suite offers you consistently easy ways to com-
plete all of your media projects — from ripping, arranging, and burning your
own copies of your favorite CDs to finally organizing and tagging those gazil-
lions of digital photos you’ve dumped into nondescript folders all over your
computer’s hard disk.
The only catch (oh, there’s always a catch) is that in order for the Easy Media
Creator 8 to be as multitalented as it is, the good engineers at Sonic Solutions
had to carve the program up into dozens of different little specialized pro-
grams and utilities that taken in at once can be a bit overwhelming (to say
the least). This is where Chapter 1 comes in: Here you not only get a much
needed overview of the many individual and specialized components now at
your fingertips but a good feel for the Roxio Media Creator Home that ties
them all together. Once you get your bearings in this all important hub,
you’re ready to see what this program can really do by looking at each of the
individual components.

Welcome to the Roxio 
Media Creator Home
When you install the Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 suite on your computer’s
hard disk, the Windows Installer automatically puts a Roxio Roxio Media
Creator Home 8 shortcut on the Windows desktop. To open the Roxio Media
Creator Home, you simply locate this shortcut icon (shown in the left margin
of this paragraph) and double-click it.
Figure 1-1 shows the Welcome screen of the Roxio Media Creator Home
window (also known as Easy Media Creator Central) that appears after you
double-click this desktop shortcut. As you can see in this figure, the Welcome
screen of the Home window that forms the hub of the Roxio Easy Media
Creator 8 suite is divided into four distinct areas:
 Menu bar: Contains the four menus, File, Tools, View, and Help, which
you can use to launch and save new media projects, access any of the
Media Creator tools, change the size and appearance of the Home
window, and get help on using Home
 Project List: Lists the categories of projects available in the Easy Media
Creator 8 suite — to expand a category to display a list of all its particu-
lar projects, click the link attached to the category name or click the 
tab button to the right of the name (the one with downward-pointing 
triangle)

 Project Window: Displays a list of links for specific tasks or apps associ-
ated with the project you’ve selected in the Project List pane or, in some
cases, lists the steps necessary to complete a particular task (such as to
back up or copy a disc)
 Control Panel: This area is divided into three sections: the Media
Information Display, which shows a visual representation of the disc or
drive designated as the destination for your project; the Input Area,
which displays a drop-down menu for selecting the recorder to use for
your project, a display showing the recording progress of the project, or
audio and video playback controls; and the Action Area, which displays
an Options button for displaying a list of options associated with your
project, or controls that enable you to start or stop the project. 
Note that you can save space in the Roxio Media Creator Home by condens-
ing the Project List pane so that it displays only icons. To do this, click the
Hide Project Pane button or choose View➪Hide Project Pane on the Roxio
Media Creator Home Menu bar. To expand the Project List so that it again dis-
plays both icons and category labels, click the Show Project Pane button (or
choose View➪Show Project Pane).
Figure 1-2 shows the Easy Media Creator 8 Home window after condensing
the Project List pane and selecting the Audio CD project. Note that Project
Window now displays instructions on how to proceed in creating an audio 
CD for a typical CD player and that the Action Area now contains a Continue
button that you click after selecting the recorder to use in the Input Area,
inserting the blank CD disc, and adding the audio files to be burned onto the
new CD.
If you have a great need for open space on the Windows desktop (as you might
when dragging and dropping files from open folder windows that you want use
in your current project) you can reduce the entire Easy Media Creator window
to a bare bones minimum. To do this, click the Switch to Mini Mode button or
choose View➪Mini Mode on the window’s menu bar.
Figure 1-3 shows the Roxio Media Creator Home window shown in Figure 1-2
after clicking the Switch to Mini Mode button. Note that even when the Home
window is in mini mode, you can still go about the business of adding the
audio files for the new CD, while at the same time keeping free most of the
desktop for displaying the contents of other open windows.
To make it easy to open the Roxio Media Creator Home, you can add this
Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 shortcut to the Windows Quick Launch toolbar
by dragging its icon to this bar and dropping it at the place on this toolbar
that immediately follows the Start button on the Windows taskbar.

Chapter 1: Getting Acquainted with Easy Media Creator 8

If you’re like me and are apt to become a really serious user of Easy Media
Creator, you may also want to fix the Roxio Media Creator Home option on
the Windows Start menu (provided that you don’t run Windows in Classic
mode). To do this, you follow these steps:
1. Double-click the Roxio Media Creator Home8 shortcut on the desktop.
If you don’t have an Roxio Media Creator Home8 shortcut on your desktop,
you can click the Start button on the Windows taskbar, mouse over the All
Programs option on the Start menu, the Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 option
on the All Programs menu, and then click the Roxio Media Creator Home
option on the Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 submenu. 
The Welcome screen of the Roxio Easy Media Creator Home window
shown in Figure 1-1 then opens.
2. Click the Start buttton on the Windows taskbar to open the Start menu.
The Roxio Media Creator Home option sporting the famous Roxio logo
(a disc with what appears to be a shark fin coming out the top of it) now
appears on the left side of the Windows Start menu.
3. Right-click the Roxio Media Creator Home optioon to open its shortcut
menu and then click the Pin to Start Menu option on this menu.

As soon as you click the Pin to Start Menu option, Windows moves the Roxio
Media Creator Home option to the upper area of the left side of the Start
menu (under such Start menu stalwarts as the Internet Explorer and Outlook
Express). If you later decide that you don’t need this option to be a perma-
nent part of the Start menu, you can remove it by right-clicking the option
and then clicking the Unpin from Start Menu option on its shortcut menu.
Attending to the Tasks at Hand
The Most Frequent Tasks links on the right side of the Welcome screen in the
Roxio Media Creator Home window (refer to Figure 1-1) give you immediate
access to many of the most common tasks, such as creating audio CDs, copy-
ing and erasing discs, creating DVDs, and performing file backups. Clicking the
link associated with a particular task temporarily opens the appropriate appli-
cation in the Project Window of the Roxio Creator 8 Home window. The beauty
of the More Frequent Tasks section in the Welcome screen of the Home window
is that you don’t have to give a second thought as to which Easy Media Creator
application to use in order to get done the project you have in mind. 
The only problem is that the tasks listed in the Most Frequent Tasks section
represent only the most common disc-related things that you can do with

Chapter 1: Getting Acquainted with Easy Media Creator 8

Roxio Easy Media Creator 8. Although you can rely on this section for most of
your media backup and data disc projects, be aware that there’s much more
to the Easy Media Creator 8 suite than still pictures. Therefore, you will also
definitely want to become well-acquainted with the additional tasks and tools
offered on the other tabs in the Project List pane.
So Many Apps, So Little Time
As soon as you click the Applications link located immediately beneath
Welcome on the Home tab of the Project List pane in the Roxio Media 
Creator Home window, the Project Window name changes to Applications.
The Applications Project Window gives a full listing of all the standalone
applications included in the suite in a column on the left and a bunch of 
neat utilities in a column on the right (see Figure 1-4).
The following sections give you a brief introduction to each of the compo-
nents that you can load by clicking its Applications or Utilities link in the
Applications Project Window of the Roxio Media Creator Home. Use this
information to get a quick overview of the capabilities and functions of each
of Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 applications and utilities.
Would you please Backup MyPC
Backup MyPC is a super utility that enables you to make disc backups of 
all the files and folders on your computer. It also gives the ability to restore

these files and folders in case their data becomes corrupted so that you’re 
no longer able to open them. 
In addition to creating these kinds of complete or partial backups of your
data files, you can use Backup MyPC to create a set of disaster recovery discs
that you can use in case of a hard disk failure or crash.
Figure 1-5 shows the Backup MyPC window as it first appears when you
launch this program by clicking the Backup MyPC link in the Applications
Project Window of the Roxio Media Creator Home. 
Playing around with CinePlayer
CinePlayer is a full-fledged DVD player for your computer (one that you may
well end up preferring to the Windows Media Player). You can use this pro-
gram to play all the DVD movies that you create and burn to disc with the
MyDVD program in the Creator 8 suite as well as professionally produced
DVDs that you rent or purchase.
The heart of the CinePlayer is the Sonic CinePlayer Control Panel shown in
Figure 1-6. Note that this panel often disappears behind the CinePlayer window
where the DVD’s video appears as soon you pop the disc you want to play 
into your computer’s CD/DVD drive. To re-display CinePlayer Control Panel
when the CinePlayer window is less than full screen, click the Sonic CinePlayer
Control Panel button on the Windows taskbar. When the CinePlayer window is
full-screen, press Alt+Tab until the CinePlayer Control Panel appears on top of
the CinePlayer window.

Chapter 1: Getting Acquainted with Easy Media Creator 8

When the CinePlayer Control Panel first opens, the side panel containing the
cursor and numeric pad is not displayed. To display this side panel, which you
then can use to select DVD menu items, you need to click the Expand/Collapse
Panel button (the one on the right side with the double vertical bar). If you
don’t display this side panel, you can select items from the menu that is cur-
rently displayed in the CinePlayer window by clicking the item (something 
you certainly can’t do when viewing the DVD on a standalone player).
The playback controls on the CinePlayer Control Panel are standard with the
exception of the Jump To button, which when clicked displays a submenu
that enables you go to a particular place in the DVD either by selecting its
chapter (assuming that the DVD uses chapters) or its timecode.
To open a movie that you created with VideoWave (see Chapter 10) or a DVD
project that you created with MyDVD (see Chapter 11), click the Open Disc or
File button and then select either the Browse for File to find the movie file or
the DVD project file on your computer’s hard disk. To edit a DVD project that
you created with MyDVD and burned to disc after viewing it in CinePlayer,
you click the Edit OpenDVD disc (meaning one that to which you have full
editing rights).
If you’re viewing a commercially produced DVD that supports subtitles
(either in English or another language such as Spanish), you can display
them in the CinePlayer window. Click the Other DVD Options button, click 
the Choose Subpicture option on the pop-up menu, and then select the 
language, English (United States) or Spanish (Traditional Sort), on the
Subpicture submenu.
Keep in mind that you can capture key frames (the ones that are clear and
not part of a scene transition) in bitmap graphic files in CinePlayer. Simply
click the Play/Pause button to pause the video at the frame you want to cap-
ture as a still image before you click the Capture Video Frame button. As soon

16
Part I: A Bit About Easy Media Creator 8 and Digital Media 

as you click this button, CinePlayer captures the image in a bitmap file (indi-
cated by the rather loud click). The first time you save an image from a DVD,
a Browse for Folder dialog box appears, enabling you to designate the folder
and drive where all movie stills are to be saved. This is followed by a Media
Name dialog box in which you can enter a descriptive name (usually the
name of the film you’re watching). CinePlayer then creates the filename for
the bitmap images you capture by appending the descriptive name to the
frame’s timecode.
The comforts of Creator Classic
Creator Classic is the application you use primarily to assemble and burn
your audio and data CDs. The Creator Classic window is divided into four
major areas:
 Projects where you choose between creating a Data Disc (one consisting
only of data files), Multimedia Disc (one that combines data files and
other media such as music or graphics files), or Bootable Disc (one that
contains enough of the Windows operating system that you can use it to
boot from one of your computer’s drives)
 Other Tasks where you can launch programs to make other types of data
discs (CD Extra Disc Creator or Backup Projects), burn a CD or DVD from
an image of the disc stored on one of your computer’s drives (Burn From
Disc Image File), get information and check the status on your computer’s
recorder (Disc and Device Utility), or start the Express Labeler (Make a
Disc Label) to create a label for your CD or DVD
 Select Source where you locate and select the files you want to copy to
data or audio CD
 Data Disc Project which displays the name of your disc as well as all the
files you’ve added for burning onto the CD
Whereas you can use Disc Copier (discussed in the section immediately fol-
lowing) to make a copy of an existing audio or data CD or DVD, you use
Creator Classic to actually put together and burn your data CDs or DVDs. You
use Creator Classic when you want to make backups or archive data files on
your disk. See Chapters 3, 5, and 6 for specific information and examples on
using Creator Classic to assemble and burn audio and data CDs.
17
Chapter 1: Getting Acquainted with Easy Media Creator 8

Copying discs with Disc Copier
As the name says, Disc Copier is the application you use when you need to
make a copy of an unprotected CD or DVD. When you click the Disc Copier link
in the Applications Projects Window in the Roxio Media Creator Home, the pro-
gram opens the window shown in Figure 1-7. Or, I should say, this window
opens after you dismiss an alert dialog box reminding you that you should use
the Disc Copier component only to make copies of digital media for which you
have the clear legal right to make copies. Knowing that none of you would ever
do anything like that, you can click the Don’t Show Me This Again check box
before you click OK to close this alert dialog box (for once and all).
You can use Disc Copier to copy an audio or data CD or DVD (usually one
that you’ve created with Roxio’s MyDVD, since almost every single commer-
cial movie on DVD that you rent or purchase is copy-protected and can’t be
copied with Disc Copier). You can also use it to create a compilation of differ-
ent movies from different sources. As you can see in Figure 1-1, all you need
to do to copy one of these discs is to specify the source and destination
drive. The great thing is, if your situation is like mine and you have only one
CD or DVD drive on your computer system, you can still use Disc Copier to
copy your audio, data, or video discs (see Chapters 3 and 5 for steps with
concrete examples of how you use Disc Copier to copy audio and data CDs).
Lauding the Label Creator
You use the Label Creator link in the Applications Project Window of the
Roxio Media Creator Home to launch the Roxio Label Creator. This applica-
tion enables you to design and print labels for the CD and DVD discs that you
burn with the other Roxio Easy Media Creator applications. The Label
Creator makes quick work of designing both disc labels and the inserts for
their jewel cases. Figure 1-8 shows the Roxio Label Creator window as it first
opens. Note that you open this window not only from Applications Project
Window but also by clicking a Create Label button in the final dialog box
when burning CD and DVD discs (see Chapters 5 and 12 for details).

18
Part I: A Bit About Easy Media Creator 8 and Digital Media 

The Label Creator window is divided into three panes: 
 Add Object with the tools for adding or drawing images that you want to
include in your label project
 Edit Layout with tools for selecting one of the ready-made label styles
for your disc label or assigning it a new color or background image or to
automatically add album information in the case of labels for copies of
commercially produced audio CDs
 Layout pane for previewing the contents of your disc label or jewel case
insert (the front and back printed cards that go inside the clear plastic
case that holds the disc), while at the same time enabling you to edit
these contents
For detailed information on using the Roxio Label Creator to design and print
labels for any of your CD or DVD discs, see Chapter 9.
Media Manager at your service
You use the Media Manager to organize the many types of media files (video
clips, still images, audio, and video projects) that you use in the CD and DVD
projects you create. This handy-dandy little program enables you to keep
tabs on particular media files through the use of albums, special Easy Media

Creator files that associate selected media files together regardless of where
these files are actually physically located on your computer system. Because
albums reference to the media files you want to associate as a group, you
don’t have to go through all the trouble of copying or moving the files into a
single folder. You can also use the Media Manager to peruse your media files,
tag them with keywords for easy searching, as well as backing these files up
by burning them onto CD or DVD discs. 
Figure 1-9 shows the Media Manager window that appears when you launch
the program by clicking the Media Manager link on the Applications Project
Window or the Organize link on the Organize tab of the Project List in the
Roxio Media Creator Home.
Deceptively simple at first glance, this window is made up of only two panes.
On the left, you see a pane named My Media, My Albums, Folders, or My
MediaSpace (UpnP), depending on which type of media container you select.
This pane enables you to select any drive or folder on your system. On the
right, you find a pane with the name of the selected media type, album, drive
or folder that displays all the folders and files within that particular type of
container. You do the rest of the organizing magic with the buttons at both
the top of the Media Manager window and these panes (see Chapter 4 for
details).

Audio discs that are music to your ears
You use the new Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 Music Disc Creator to build and
burn audio CDs and DVDs. The music you include in your audio projects can
come from tracks of commercial audio CDs that you’ve purchased as well as
audio files that you’ve recorded yourself. Audio discs that you create with
this nifty application can be saved in any of the popular audio file formats
including the standard WMA and the ever popular MP3.
Figure 1-10 shows the Music Disc Creator program window that opens when
you click the Music Disc Creator link in the Applications Project Window of
the Roxio Media Creator Home window. The Music Disc Creator window is
divided into the following panes:
 Project Type where you choose between creating a standard audio CD,
MP3/WMA disc, and a DVD music disc
 Add to Project where you can add music files to your audio disc project,
including tracks from pre-recorded audio CDs or imported from other
audio CD or DVD discs, as well as record audio files for the project
 Audio CD – Untitled Project which shows the name of your audio pro-
ject along with the tracks in the order in which they will be burned on
the new CD or DVD disc

Easy multimedia projects 
thanks to MyDVD
MyDVD is the application that you use to assemble and burn multimedia pro-
jects on DVD discs. Multimedia projects are those that can combine more
than one type of media, including video clips, still photo images, text, and
audio tracks. You can use MyDVD to quickly and easily convert your digital
home movies into menu-driven productions that you can play on a computer
DVD drive or a standalone DVD player attached to your TV. You can also use
MyDVD to assemble your digital photo collections into slideshows that, when
burned onto a DVD disc, can be played in the selfsame computer DVD drives
or standalone DVD players.
Figure 1-11 shows the program window that first opens after you click the
MyDVD link in the Applications Project Window launch or click the Create
DVD link on the DVD & Video tab in the Project List pane of the Roxio Media
Creator Home window. The MyDVD 8 window, as you can see in Figure 1-13, is
divided into the following four panes:
 Menu Tasks where you add movies or slideshows you’ve already cre-
ated in the Easy Media Creator 8 suite as menu items or capture and
import video clips, music, or graphics for your DVD project 
 Edit where you can edit a movie or split it into individual chapters as
well as specify a visual theme for the project’s menu screens (including
layout and labeling of the menu buttons), select a photo or video to use
as the background of all menu screens, or add music or sound effects to
play whenever the project’s menu screens are displayed on the screen
 Project view which visually represents the hierarchy and layout of your
DVD project
 Preview which shows you the layout of the menu items and the back-
ground of the main menu of your DVD project and where you can edit
any of the menu titles
MyDVD is possibly the most versatile application in the entire Easy Media
Creator suite. Because you can combine all types of media (video, still
images, text, and audio) as you want, this is the place where you can be really
creative. In no time, you’ll be creating personalized and professional-looking
multimedia projects that you can share with all your friends and family who
have access to either a DVD drive in their computers or a standalone DVD
player. See Chapters 9, 10, and 11 for details on using the MyDVD to create
your own DVD projects.
22

Picture it in PhotoSuite
Photo Suite is the application that you use to organize, edit, and share the
digital photos that you take. You can use this component to enhance the
photos, organize them into albums, use them in creating projects like greet-
ing cards and calendars, as well as easily share them with friends and family.
Figure 1-12 shows you the PhotoSuite window after launching this program
by clicking the PhotoSuite link in the Applications Project Window or the Fix
& Enhance link on the Photo tab in the Project List of the Roxio Media
Creator Home and opening a photo to edit.
As you can see in this figure, the startup window for PhotoSuite is divided
into three panes: 
 A task pane along the left edge containing a Common tab and an All tab,
both of which are subdivided into Open/Create, Fix, Tools, and Enhance
panes that contain the common options for editing your digital photos
and starting new photo projects
 Canvas pane on the upper right where the photo you’re currently edit-
ing appears
 Open File(s) pane directly below it showing thumbnails of the all the
photos you have open. The Common and All tabs are both.

Chapter 1: Getting Acquainted with Easy Media Creator 8

Note that the Canvas pane on the right side of the PhotoSuite window gives
you general information about the digital photo you’re currently editing,
including its rotation, width, and height. It also contains controls for zooming
in and out on the photo, changing its orientation, saving, printing, and 
e-mailing the edited photo. See Chapter 8 for detailed information on using 
all the PhotoSuite options.
Getting Secure with Roxio Backup
Roxio Backup enables you to create CD and DVD data file projects that back
up certain folders and files on your computer system. This versatile little tool
not only enables you to make one-time backups of important files but also to
schedule regular backups for important files and to do incremental backups
that include only files modified since your last backup.
Figure 1-13 shows the Roxio Backup window that appears when you first
launch this applet either by clicking the Roxio Backup link in the Applications
Project Window or the File Backup link on the Backup tab in the Project List
pane of the Roxio Media Creator Home. The Roxio Backup window is divided
into three panes:
 Backup Tasks to create a new backup project, refresh the list of files to
be backed up, or to display a report showing the history of backups
made using the current backup project

 Other Tasks to open the Disc and Device Utility where you can select
the device to use in making the backup (usually your CD or DVD drive)
and to launch Express Labeler, a special quick version of the Label
Creator application
 Backup Projects that displays the name of the backup project as well as
the files you want copied as part of the backup
Saying hello to Sound Editor
You can use the Sound Editor tool to edit or enhance the audio recordings
you make with such tools as Easy Audio Capture and the LP and Tape
Assistant (covered later in this chapter) and convert them to any of the sup-
ported digital audio file formats, including MP3, WAV, OGG, and WMA (see
Chapter 2 to find out what in the world all these acronyms stand for).
Figure 1-14 shows you the Sound Editor window that appears when you
launch this utility by clicking the Sound Editor link in the Applications
Project Window of the Roxio Media Creator Home and after opening an MP3
audio file for editing. As you can see in this figure, the Sound Editor interface
represents the audio file graphically with a sort of waveform readout (remi-
niscent of a snapshot of an oscilloscope display). This waveform displays the
relative amplitude of the sound for the left and right channels (marked L and
R) of the audio file.

You can then use the controls at the bottom of the Sound Editor to play 
back all of or any part of the audio track. You can also use the zoom controls
located immediately above the waveform display to magnify portions of the
audio’s waveform display or zoom out on it so that more of the entire track 
is shown in the Sound Editor. See Chapter 5 for details on using the Sound
Editor to edit the audio files that you burn to CD or use in your DVD projects.
Riding the VideoWave
VideoWave is the application that you use to assemble and edit video pro-
jects (referred to in the Roxio documentation as productions) that can include
video clips, still images, and audio. After assembling and editing a production
in VideoWave, you can either add it to a DVD project that you’re making in
MyDVD or use MyDVD to burn it onto a DVD (see “Easy multimedia projects
thanks to MyDVD” that precedes this section).
Figure 1-15 shows you the VideoWave 8 window that appears after launching
the program by clicking the VideoWave link in the Applications Project
Window of the Roxio Media Creator Home and opening an existing slideshow
to edit (you must designate whether to create a new production or edit an

existing one as part of the program startup). When you open the VideoWave
8 window to create a new production or edit an existing one, it is divided into
the four major panes shown in this figure:
 Add Content where you add the photos or video clips you want
included in the production as well as select among the various effects
and transitions you want to use
 Tools which includes tools for selecting new media and to include in 
the production and effects to apply as well as to launch a CineMagic
Production or New Slideshow built with the Slideshow Assistant 
(see description in the bullet list immediately following this one)
 Preview where you can preview how the your production will play as
you create and edit it
 Production Editor: Storyline displaying a storyboard view of the video
production, showing all the individual video clips and stills with any in-
between transitions in the order in which they will play in the final pro-
duction (this pane can also display the production in a Timeline view
which shows the timing of each element in the production along with
any audio or narration track that you’ve added)

Personally, I find that VideoWave interface is one of the easiest and most
straightforward for editing video that I’ve run across. I’m sure that with 
just a little experience using this beauty, you’re going to love video editing. 
If, however, you’re a complete newbie to video editing and are the least bit
intimidated about producing your own videos, you’ll be glad to know that
VideoWave includes two new components designed to make video editing
nearly foolproof:
 CineMagic, which automatically edits your video production by trim-
ming your video clips and adjusting the tempo of the audio to fit the
flow and transitions you use (perfect for making MTV-type videos)
 Slideshow Assistant, which uses a Wizard-type interface, providing step-
by-step guidance through assembling the various elements in a new
slideshow production including transitions and background music
Starting your video-editing career with CineMagic and the Slideshow Assistant
is a perfect way to become familiar with the VideoWave interface and its capa-
bilities. From there, you can quickly move on to video editing on your own
right using the Storyline and Timeline views. See Chapter 11 for complete
details on using all aspects of VideoWave.
Although you normally launch VideoWave from the Roxio Media Creator
Home, you can also launch VideoWave directly from within the MyDVD appli-
cation when you need to do some advanced editing on a video production
created earlier with VideoWave that you’ve imported into the Video Project
you’re currently working on or to do similar editing to the contents of a new
title that you added to DVD project. Suffice it to say that knowing how to use
VideoWave goes a long way in mastering the video end of the Easy Media
Creator suite.
Utilities Perfect for Particular 
Media Needs
In addition to all the nifty programs listed in its Applications list, the
Applications Project Window of the Roxio Media Creator Home also inlcudes
a Utilities list that provides the following useful tools: 
 Create Panoramas to launch the Panorama Assistant that enables you
to stitch together a sequence of photos into a single panoramic picture
(see Chapter 6 for details)
28
Part I: A Bit About Easy Media Creator 8 and Digital Media 

 DVDInfo Pro to use Roxio DVDInfo Pro to get all sorts of information
about the capacities of your computer’s DVD drive as well as informa-
tion on those of a DVD disc that you want to use in the burning of your
Roxio media projects
 Disc Image Loader to create a virtual drive on your computer into
which you can load disc image files containing audio or video data
culled from different physical discs, thus enabling you to play or to back
up the data without having to do any disc swapping (see Chapter 3 for
details)
 Drag To Disc to copy data and media files onto the CD or DVD disc in
your computer’s CD/DVD drive by simply dragging them to the pro-
gram’s icon (see “Instant data copying thanks to Drag to Disc” in the sec-
tion that follows immediately for details)
 Easy Audio Capture for recording audio with your computer’s sound
card either externally using some sort of microphone or internally using
a program such as the Windows Media Player that plays audio on your
computer (see Chapter 7 for details)
 Media Import to launch Roxio Media Import which enables you to cap-
ture photo, video, and audio clips for your Roxio media projects (see
“The importance of Media Import” later in this chapter for details)
 Multi Phhoto Enhance for doing group editing on a bunch of digital
photos that all require the same types of fixes and enhancements (see
Chapter 6 for details)
 Retrieve for recovering data files from a multi-disc CD or DVD data pro-
ject where the data from some files can be split across more than one
disc (see Chapter 3 for details)
Instant data copying thanks 
to Drag to Disc
Drag to Disc is one of the neatest yet simplest applications in the Easy Media
Creator suite. You can use this nifty program to make CD or DVD backups or
archives of data files on your hard disk or network simply by dragging their
folder or file icons on the Windows desktop and dropping them on the Drag
to Disc icon (shown in Figure 1-16). The Drag-to-Disc application is great
because it automatically does any formatting for the data CD or DVD as
needed to accommodate the files that you add. 
29
Chapter 1: Getting Acquainted with Easy Media Creator 8

To display the Drag to Disc icon on your Windows desktop, click the Drag To
Disc link in the Utilities column of the Applications Project area in the Roxio
Media Creator Home window or click the Drag to Disc icon (shown in the left
margin of this paragraph) that appears in the Systems Tray on the right side
of the Windows taskbar immediately to the left of the clock. For details on
making quick data backups and archives with Drag to Disc, see Chapter 3. 
The importance of Media Import
As the name suggests, you use the Media Import to bring in media files from
various devices such as a digital photo camera, video camera, scanner, and
microphone that’s connected to your computer system. You can also use
Media Import to capture media files from CD or DVD discs (which aren’t copy
protected and to which you have the right to make copies) loaded into the
CD or DVD drive built into your computer.
Figure 1-17 shows the Roxio Media Import window as it appears when I
launch the program by clicking the Media Import link in the Utilities column
of the Applications Project Window in the Roxio Media Creator Home window
and then select the Video tab when my Sony digital video camera is con-
nected to my PC. Your Capture window will undoubtedly differ depending on
the actual devices you have connected to your computer. As you can see, this
window contains the controls for capturing a video clip directly from the con-
nected video camera on the left with a listing of the clips recently imported
on the right. See Chapter 10 for details on using Media Import to capture vari-
ous types of media files for your Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 projects.

Note that you can quickly open the Help Center from the Roxio Media Creator
Home window by clicking the Help button (the one with the question mark
immediately beneath Maximize button in the upper-right corner of the Home
window) or by simply pressing F1 when this window is active.
The easiest way to get to general help on the use of any of the suite’s mod-
ules is from the Contents tab. This tab contains a list of Using topics that
comprise all the suite’s modules from Using Roxio Home all the way to Using
Disc Image Loader (with all applications outlined earlier in this chapter in
between). In addition, when you expand the Using Roxio Home topic at the
top of the Contents tab (by clicking the plus-sign button to the immediate left
of its book icon), you find project-specific help subtopics with loads of good
information on making specific types of Audio, Copy, and Data projects.
Getting application-specific help
In addition to the help available in the Roxio Media Creator Home, each of the
indvidual apps included in the suite such as Creator Classic, PhotoSuite,
MyDVD, and the like offer their own application-specific help in two forms:
 Help for this Window (the first item on the particular program
window’s Help menu or opened by pressing F1) that acquaints you with
the particular module’s interface
 Help Center for the specific module you’re using (the second item on
the module’s Help menu) that contains help topics on how to use the
particular module’s features
Figure 1-19 shows you the Help For the Sound Editor window that opens
when you choose Help➪Help for this Window on the Sound Editor menu bar
or press F1 when the Sound Editor program window is active. As you can see,
this particular help window contains callouts for the Sound Editor window
that enable you to identify its major areas and controls.

The Ins and Outs of Digital 
Media and Gear
In This Chapter
 Getting familiar with the wide range of digital media file formats
 Converting analog media to digital
 Selecting your digital camera and camcorder
 Selecting your DVD and MP3 player
 The proper care and handling of your CD and DVD discs
T
he many tools the Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 suite puts at your disposal
certainly make it easy to create your own audio and video projects. This
ease of use, however, is not quite matched when it comes to making heads or
tails of the many and sundry media formats and equipment you can use in
recording and saving these projects.
To help dispel potential confusion over your choices of media formats for the
particular audio and video gear you’re using, this chapter begins by examin-
ing the relationship of media formats to digital recording and playback equip-
ment. It then goes on to introduce you to the essential difference between
analog and digital media, why you want to get on the digital bandwagon, and
some of the devices you can use to convert your analog media to digital for
use with the Easy Media Creator.
Finally, this chapter looks at some of your options in terms of digital record-
ing and playback paraphernalia, including digital still cameras, video cam-
eras, and audio recorders, not to mention CD and DVD drives, and CD, MP3,
and DVD players. It ends with a few important pointers on the care and feeding
(I mean, handling) of the CD and DVD discs you use for saving and recording
your Easy Media Creator projects.

Feeling at Home in the Digital 
Media Menagerie
Before I can clear up any perplexity that you may have about the different
types of media that are available to you as you start working with the Easy
Media Creator suite, you need to be clear about the relationship between the
digital media formats and the kinds of recorders and playback gear you have.
The standard media formats for both CD and DVD discs come in several fla-
vors (see the sidebar that follows for the essential difference between CD and
DVD discs). As you see in Table 2-1, by and large these formats differ accord-
ing to how much data they hold, their recording speed, and whether or not
they enable you to record data on them only once or erase and rerecord data
multiple times (referred to by the term rewritable).

When shopping for discs to use for your various Easy Media Creator projects,
you need to match the capacities of your recording and playback hardware
with the proper media. Be sure to check the boxes of media for the following
pieces of information:
 CD or DVD indicating whether the discs are formatted for recording and
playback of CDs or DVDs
 Maximum data capacity expressed in megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB)
 Recording speed, anywhere from 1x (times) up to about 8x for DVDs and
anywhere up 52x for CDs
 R or RW indicating whether the discs can be recorded once or are
rewritable
38
Part I: A Bit about Media Creator 8 and Digital Media 

You may be scratching your head wondering about what’s up with the DVD-R
and DVD+R and the DVD-RW and DVD+RW formats listed in Table 2-1. Basically,
the minus and plus indicate two slightly different single and multi-session DVD
recording formats. The -R and -RW formats were the first DVD recording for-
mats that were compatible with standalone DVD players (the ones you connect
to your TV). The +R and +RW formats are newer and boast some improvements
in recording (newer DVD-ROM computer drives tend to be DVD+RW compati-
ble drives).
DVD-R and DVD+R are the non-rewritable formats that are compatible with
almost all DVD players and DVD-ROM drives. DVD-RW and DVD+RW are the
rewritable formats and are compatible with about 75 percent of the DVD play-
ers and almost all DVD-ROM drives. 
Note that the DVD+RW format supports both a single-side 4.7 GB disc (known
as DVD-5) and a double-side 9.2 GB disc (known as DVD-10). The DVD-RAM
has the best recording features but it is not compatible with most DVD-ROM
drives and standalone DVD-video players (you need to check to make sure
that your recorder and player can deal with DVD-RAM discs).
In terms of selecting new hardware for your computer, keep in mind the fol-
lowing distinctions among drives:
 CD-ROM drives can only read CDs
 DVD-ROM drives can only read CDs and DVDs
 CD-RW/DVD combo drives can read and write CDs but only read DVDs
 DVD-R and DVD+R drives can read and write CDs but only read DVDs
 DVD-RW and DVD+RW drives can read and write both CDs and DVDs
If you’re in a position of selecting among the different types of drives for a new
computer system, go with a DVD+RW drive if you can possibly afford it. By
selecting a DVD+RW drive, you get the benefits of all the other three types of
drives as well as the ability to back up data and video on your own DVDs. This
means that you get to play your favorite music CDs and movies and videos on
your computer while at same time being able to take full advantage of the
Roxio Easy Media Creator software to create and burn your own CD and DVD
creations (including data and audio CDs and data and multimedia DVDs).
Let’s hear it for the Video and 
Super Video CD formats
In addition to the regular CD-R format used to record standard data and
audio CDs, you need to be aware of two other CD formats, both of which can
incorporate both audio and video like a DVD:
39
Chapter 2: The Ins and Outs of Digital Media and Gear

 Video CD (VCD), which can hold up to 74/80 minutes of video on a
650/700 MB CD and can be played in most of the new standalone DVD
players
 Super Video CD (SVCD) which can hold up to 35-60 minutes of video on
a 650/700 MB CD and can be played in many of the new standalone DVD
players
Note that SVCD format supports higher quality video than your regular VCD
but as you can see from the above descriptions is less compatible and holds
less video. When creating a new multimedia project with Roxio’s DVD Builder
application, you can choose to create in either the VCD or SVCD format
instead of the standard DVD format.
Ripping through those 
pesky audio formats
Audio file formats vary almost as much as CD and DVD formats. These for-
mats, however, only contain information about the shape and duration of the
audio’s waveform. In addition, the format will specify the sample rate (the res-
olution of the audio that determines the sound quality), bit-depth (the number
of bits, 0 and 1, used to describe the volume of the sample at any given point
in the audio stream), and may include the type of compression used (assum-
ing that the audio is compressed at all).
When an audio file uses an audio format without compression, it is naturally
a larger file that requires more computer memory to play than files using dif-
ferent compression schemes. As a general rule, a second of uncompressed
audio of the quality of your typical store-bought album on CD, which uses a
sample rate of 44.1 kHz (kilohertz), a bit-depth of 16-bit, and is stereo, takes
about 172 Kb to store on your computer (that’s about 10 Mb per minute and
604 Mb per hour).
On computers running Windows, uncompressed audio is almost always
stored in the so-called WAV audio format (pronounced wave). This format is
also known as PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) and carries a .WAV file exten-
sion. WAV files store are standard CD quality (44.1 kHz, 16-bit, stereo), mean-
ing that they are big files that hog up your disk space.
In terms of compressed audio, you’ll run into a number of different 
schemes — each of which is technically known as a codec (short for 
compress/decompress) — for compressing and later decompressing the
audio stream. 
40
Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator 8 and Digital Media 

The most popular audio codecs for computers running some flavor of
Microsoft Windows are the ever-present MP3 (MPEG 3) and WMA (Windows
Media Audio). The WMA format was developed by Microsoft for its Windows
Media Player. This codec does not compress audio files as much as the much
more popular, MP3 but it does tend to have slightly better sound quality. MP3
is, however, the most popular codec for storing and streaming music (thus
the plethora of so-called MP3 players — see “I want my MP3” later in this
chapter for details). 
MPEG actually stands for Motion Picture Experts Group, the name of a highly
prestigious committee that sets standards for the encoding of digital video
and sound. MPEG 3 actually uses the so-called MPEG 1, a video codec for
compressing video in digital cameras and camcorders and in the creation of
VCDs (Video CDs supported by DVD Builder) with what’s called the Audio
Layer 3 codec, thus the name MPEG 3 or, as it’s more commonly known, MP3.
In addition to MP3 and WMA compression, in the Roxio Easy Media Creator
components, you may also run across the OGG codec. OGG refers to Ogg
Vorbis, an open, patent-free codec for audio encoding and streaming that is
gaining some popularity. Ogg is not, as far as I can tell, an acronym like WMA
or MP3 (perhaps it refers to Ogg, the former gamekeeper before Hagrid takes
over the post at Hogwarts in book four of Harry Potter?). Where the name
Vorbis comes from is anyone’s guess.
41
Chapter 2: The Ins and Outs of Digital Media and Gear
What separates the CDs from the DVDs
CD stands for Compact Disc and comes in two
very familiar forms: audio CDs that play in all
standard CD players and CD-ROMs that play in
your computer’s CD or DVD drive. DVD stands
for Digital Versatile Disc (although some replace
the Versatile with Video) and is most familiar 
in the form of movies on DVD that you rent or
purchase. 
Both CDs and DVDs rely on laser technology to
decode their sequence of binary (0 and 1) data.
The big difference between CDs and DVDs is
their data capacity. Because DVDs use smaller
tracks than CDs (0.74 microns wide as opposed
to 1.6 microns), they can store much more digi-
tal data on the same size disc (both CD and DVD
are the same diameter and often the same
thickness), about two hours of video or about 4.7
GB (gigabytes or one billion bytes!) of digital
data compared to about 74 minutes of audio or
about 700MB (megabytes or one million bytes)
of digital data or less. Because DVDs use
smaller tracks to fit more data on the same-
size disc, they also require special computer
drives for recording and playing their discs.
Fortunately, DVD drives can also record and
play back CDs (although CD drives cannot
record and play back DVD discs).

If you’re a user of Apple’s iTunes, you run into another compression scheme
known popularly as AAC (Advanced Audio Coding). This scheme uses MPEG
4 compression codec, and Audio files saved in AAC are often smaller than
MP3 files with better sound quality (unfortunately, Roxio’s Easy Media
Creator 7 sound applications do not support this audio file format).
Don’t you hate those “lossy” codecs?
There’s one more consideration when it comes to compression schemes.
When considering a codec to select for your audio, you need to reflect on
whether or not the codec is lossy or lossless. A lossy codec is one that actu-
ally loses content that is considered to be duplicated or not essential in lis-
tening to the audio. A lossless codec is just the opposite: in compressing
audio, it does not remove any of the bits from the original audio file that it
cannot restore when the audio stream is decompressed for playback.
As you might guess, lossy codecs make for smaller compressed audio files
but with slightly lesser sound quality. Lossless codecs, on the other hand,
make for larger compressed files but usually with great fidelity to the original.
This is the reason that MP3 audio files are generally a little smaller than the
same WMA audio files and that WMA audio files are generally considered of
slightly higher quality than MP3 files because MP3 is the lossy codec of the
two and WMA the lossless one.
When applying lossy codecs such as MP3, JPEG (for digital images), and
MPEG1 (for digital camera and camcorder video) to your media files, the Easy
Media Creator applications and tools normally allow you to adjust the
amount of compression to apply by selecting the relative quality for the com-
pressed file. Select the best quality when larger file sizes aren’t an issue and
lesser quality when the relative size of the file is most important.
42
Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator 8 and Digital Media 
Codecs for more than just audio
Although this section deals solely with audio
compression, codecs are by no means
restricted to audio compression. Digital photos
and video both use their own codecs in order to
keep down the size of their visual media. The
most popular codec for digital photos is JPEG
(Joint Photographic Experts Group), which can
vary in terms of its size/quality ratio. For digital
video, the most popular codecs are MPEG 1,
used primarily for video from digital cameras
and camcorders, and MPEG 2, used primarily
for commercially produced movies on DVD and
in TiVo-type hard disk video recorders.

Ripping and burning those audio files
Before leaving behind the fascinating subject of audio file formats, you
should be aware of a couple more procedures, namely ripping and burning
audio files (terms, I admit, that suggest a degree of violence that is totally
absent in their actual processes). Ripping refers to the process of taking
audio tracks from one source in one audio format and saving them to another
in a second audio format. The most common example of ripping is when you
take tracks from a commercially produced CD and save them in another com-
pressed digital format on your hard disk such as MP3 or WMA with the
Creator Classic application.
Burning refers to the process of then taking the audio files that you’ve ripped
to a new audio format such as MP3 and WMA on your computer’s hard disk
and then transferring them to a blank CD disc for playback on other devices
(like a CD or MP3 player). Note that although you hear the term ripping
applied mostly to audio files, it can also be applied to video files saved on
DVDs as well (although this requires special software besides Roxio Easy
Media Creator, as most DVDs are highly copy-protected).
The term burning is, however, applied equally to the creation of both CDs
and DVDs so that you find Burn buttons in both the Creator Classic and DVD
Builder applications.
Make Mine Digital!
It’s true that nowadays digital is king (and as the immortal Mel Brooks is so
fond of telling us, “It’s good to be king!”). Nowhere is this rush to digital seen
more clearly than in the purchase of consumer electronics, which today are
almost entirely digital in nature, as in digital cameras, camcorders, DVD play-
ers, and digital audio players. It seems like the only electronics gear that is
still analog is tape recorders and even then you have the choice of going digi-
tal with DAT (Digital Audio Tape) recorders.
So what’s this all about, this analog versus digital business? Well, let me start
by giving you the textbook definition of each, followed by the classic example
that hopefully makes their rather dry explanations all clear.
By definition, analog devices are apparatuses in which the data is repre-
sented by continuously variable physical quantities (you say what?). Digital
devices, however, are machines in which the data is represented by discrete
units, namely the binary number system which consists of just two measly
numbers, 0 and 1.
43
Chapter 2: The Ins and Outs of Digital Media and Gear

Okay, now that that’s clear as mud, take a look at the classic example of an
apparatus that exists in both analog and digital forms, namely your wrist-
watch. If your watch happens to have a dial that shows the sequence of the
twelve hours and represents the current time on this time with the placement
of its hands (at least an hour and minute hand and perhaps even a hand to
keep track of the passing seconds), then you’re wearing an analog device.
And this device represents its data (that is, the passing hours, minutes, and
seconds on the twelve-hour dial) “by continuously variable physical quanti-
ties” (that’s the moving watch hands to you and me).
If, however, you’re wearing a wristwatch that has no hour dial and uses no
hands but actually tells you the current time in Arabic numerals, as in 6:15:33
or 22:05:09, you are the proud owner of a digital device, one that represents
its data (the same passing hours, minutes, and seconds) in discrete binary
units (which the clock manufacturer has skillfully disguised as a readout
showing the current time).
Now nice as the wristwatch example is, it doesn’t help too much in terms of the
kinds of devices you’ll be using with your Easy Media Creator software. For
examples closer to the work you’ll be doing, I prefer the examples of the long-
playing record versus the audio CD and the videocassette versus video on DVD.
Records are prime examples of analog audio media just as videocassettes are
great examples of analog video media. And you guessed it; audio CDs and video
DVDs are excellent examples of their digital audio and video counterparts.
One way to keep analog mechanisms straight from digital ones is to remem-
ber that the word “analog” is related to the term “analogous,” denoting some-
thing that is similar to something else so that most analog devices capture
their data by acting like the sense organs with which we collect data. So,
analog cameras have lenses that capture light in similar ways that the lens in
the human eye and analog audio recorders have microphones that vibrate
like the tympanic membrane in the ear. Even the classic analog clock with its
dial and moving hands in some ways mimics a sundial in the way that the
sun’s shadow moves across its disk.
Why digital rules
And now I can tell you the main reasons that digital has been crowned king.
The first reason is that devices that play back such analog media as LPs and
videocassettes can only access their data (sound and music, in this case)
sequentially. The ramification of this fact becomes abundantly clear in the
case of a videocassette when you go to try to find and replay a favorite scene
in a movie on tape. Instead of being able to jump right to the scene as you
can do with the controller for your DVD player (assuming that the movie is
also available on DVD, which nowadays is almost always true), you have to
fast forward or reverse until you recognize the place in the movie you want to
replay. The discrete rather than continuous nature of digital audio and video
media is what makes this kind of random access of the data possible.
44
Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator 8 and Digital Media 

The second reason that digital is riding so high and mighty comes from the
fact that copies of any type of digital media (including sound, photos, and
video) are every bit (pun intended) as good as the original, since both the
original and copy contain the exact same sequence of 0 and 1s. This is defi-
nitely not true of analog media. The quality of each copy of an analog master
is slightly degraded and copies made from copies are even worse (just as a
photocopy made from a photocopy of an original is fainter and lacks much of
the original detail).
So too, the quality of most media that store analog data (with film being the
most notorious) naturally degrades with time (you have only to thumb
through an album filled with your baby pictures to know what I’m talking
about). By and large, this is not true of most digital media (hard disks and
DVD discs stored properly should last you a really long time) and, of course,
in the cases where it is, you can always create a new master from any copy
that is still intact (thus the singular importance of making backups and the
beauty of the fact that a copy made from a copy of an original is equal in
quality to that copy and, indeed, the original itself).
Converting analog media to digital
The best way to protect your precious analog data (usually stored in photos,
home movies, audio tape recordings, videocassettes, and LPs) is to convert
the analog data to digital data. In fact, this may well be your primary motiva-
tion for learning how to use the applications and tools in the Roxio Easy
Media Creator suite and may turn out to be your primary use for the software. 
Like me, you may have shoeboxes of family pictures in the attic, a closet full
of Super 8 home movies, drawers full of videocassettes, and a basement full
of the most incredible collection of records, both LPs and 45s (now virtually
abandoned and utterly unplayed). Fortunately, you can take steps to pre-
serve this very precious data and all the wonderful memories it contains by
making digital copies of their media. The device you use to convert analog
data to digital depends on the type of analog media you’re converting. The
next two sections look at two of the most common and most reasonably
priced analog-to-digital conversion devices: the digital scanner that you can
use to digitize photos and, in some cases, slides and the analog-to-DV (digital
video) converters that enable you to convert video saved as home movies
and videocassettes.
“Scotty, scan me up . . .”
A digital scanner is one of the most useful and cost-effective analog-to-digital
conversion devices you can own. Scanners come in several flavors: film scan-
ners designed specifically for scanning photos from film (including negatives)
and 35mm slides and film, handheld scanners that you pass over the object
or page you want digitized, sheetfed scanners where you feed the photo or
45
Chapter 2: The Ins and Outs of Digital Media and Gear

page to scanned, and flatbed scanners designed for scanning any object that
you can fit on its flatbed (especially printed text and images and photos
developed from film).
For about a $100 or less, you can get a really decent flatbed scanner with
which you can digitize all your family photos, news clippings, and favorite
cards and letters and preserve them in digital form before they become too
faded and stained to enjoy. If you want to be able to scan photo negatives,
slides, and filmstrips as well, you’ll have to pay more but you can still find a
flatbed scanner that can scan these without having to resort to purchasing a
special film scanner (which doesn’t enable you to scan items like cards, let-
ters, and pages of a book).
Note that almost any scanner that you buy today can connect to your com-
puter through a USB (Universal Serial Bus) 2.0 cable (the type of cable con-
nector typically used to connect a mouse to newer computers. Higher end
(and more costly) scanners can also connect to your computer through the
so-called FireWire (officially known by its much more boring designation,
IEEE-1394) cable.) Although a FireWire connection between your scanner and
computer is not necessary, keep in mind that FireWire connectivity is com-
pletely necessary when it comes to transferring digital video from a digital
camera or camcorder to your computer (in such cases, USB 2.0 just isn’t fast
enough).
Analog-to-DV converters
Analog-to-DV converters are standalone devices that enable you to connect
analog devices such as an 8mm video camera or VHS format VCR to them via
Composite video or S-video and RCA audio cables. The converter then con-
verts the analog signal from the movie or tape to digital and sends the result-
ing 0 and 1 bits to your computer’s hard disk via a FireWire cable. And once
you’ve got the video data converted to digital and saved on your hard disk,
you can then use Easy Media Creator applications such as VideoWave and
DVD Builder to arrange and enhance the content (see Chapters 11 and 12 for
details).
The nice thing about analog-to-DV converters like the Pyro A/V Link is that
the conversion is not limited to analog to digital. After you arrange and
enhance your digital video data with the Easy Media Creator software, you
can then use the converter to convert it back to analog and transfer it out to
a connected analog device such as a VCR. That way, you can save your final
digital video project on VHS tape and then share the resulting videocassette
with those in your family who haven’t yet crossed over the digital divide.

Sorting Out Your Digital Recording Gear
While it’s great to be able to convert your analog data to digital for use in
your Easy Media Creator projects, it’s even better (and a heck of a lot easier)
to capture the data in digital form in the first place. To be able to capture digi-
tal media for use in your Easy Media Creator projects, at the very minimum
you’ll want to have access to a digital still camera (sometimes abbreviated to
digicam) and a digital video camera (commonly called a camcorder, a trunca-
tion of camera-recorder).
When selecting a digital camera or camcorder, the quality of the camera lens
is critical in determining the quality of your photos as with their analog coun-
terparts, but another unique factor comes into play, as well: the resolution of
a sensor called a CCD (Charge Coupled Device), whose pixels actually regis-
ter the photographed image on the camera’s disk. It is the resolution of the
camera’s CCD that most affects the sharpness of the photographed image. 
Both digital still and movie cameras are rated by the highest CCD resolution
they support (measured in megapixels that are a factor of the product of the
number of horizontal and vertical pixels used on the CCD sensor). With still
cameras, you can select a resolution beneath the camera’s highest megapixel
rating, enabling you to store a greater number of lesser resolution photos on
the camera’s storage disk. With camcorders, you can’t modify the CCD resolu-
tion so that your movies are always recorded at the camera’s highest setting.
In addition to the megapixel rating of the camera’s CCD sensor, when select-
ing a digital still camera, you’ll want to pay attention to the following factors:
 Whether or not the camera has a zoom lens (usually a mechanical zoom
lens is superior to the so-called digital zoom that doesn’t actually move
the lens forward and back)
 How much built-in memory the camera has and whether this memory is
expandable through some kind of flash memory disk or memory stick
(the amount of memory determines how many photos you can take
before you have to transfer them onto your computer’s hard disk)
 Whether or not the camera has an LCD screen which enables you to pre-
view the photo right after you take it
 The kind of computer interface the camera has (most support USB 2.0
connectivity, although the higher-end cameras also support FireWire
connectivity)
When selecting a digital camcorder, you apply many of the same criteria as
when choosing a digital still camera (megapixel rating, zoom lens, LCD
screen, and USB versus FireWire connectivity). Of course, the big difference
between a digital still camera and camcorder is how they record their images. 
47
Chapter 2: The Ins and Outs of Digital Media and Gear

Many camcorders still record their video on film, although a few of the small-
est ones use flash memory cards and a few of the very newest ones can
record their video directly on MiniDVD discs. Most camcorders, however,
continue to record their video on Mini DV cassettes (which support the DV
media format with CD quality sound). Mini DV cassettes are normally avail-
able in 30-, 60-, and 90-minute sizes.
Be aware that MiniDVD discs (3-inch diameter or about half the size of a stan-
dard DVD disc) do not play in all DVD players. Before you invest in a cam-
corder that uses MiniDVD discs, be sure that your DVD Player plays media
this size. Otherwise, you’ll end up always having to dump the video that you
take with the camera onto your hard disk and then use one of the Easy Media
Creator applications to burn it onto a standard-size DVD in order to play it in
your machine.
When It’s “Playback” Time
Getting your digital recording gear is truly only half the story, for what good
is a digital camcorder if you have no way to play the movies you make with it
outside of its tiny LCD screen or on your computer screen? The other half of
the story has got to be what you are going to use to play all those great audio
and video projects you create with the Roxio Easy Media Creator 8.
The next two sections give you an overview of the capabilities of today’s crop
of DVD and MP3 players. Both of these devices are surely among the hottest
digital electronics on the market and ones that you want to consider invest-
ing in given the capabilities of your Roxio Easy Media Creator software.
Delving into the world of DVD players
DVD players have eclipsed videocassette players much faster than most
people anticipated. This is probably not only due to their much superior
video and sound quality but also to the dramatic decrease in their pricing:
you can now get a decent player for anywhere between $100 and $200.
When choosing a DVD player, you have to consider what media formats (DVD
and otherwise) that the player supports (see “Feeling at Home in the Digital
Media Menagerie” earlier in this chapter for details). Some DVD players not
only support a number of DVD media formats but audio DVD, CD, and MP3 as
well. This feature enables you to play the audio DVD, CDs, and MP3 discs as
well as the DVD video discs that you assemble and burn with your Easy
Media Creator software.
48
Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator 8 and Digital Media 

If you still have a lot of videocassettes that you like to play (and you haven’t
yet bought into the idea of converting them all into digital DVD discs), you
might want to consider purchasing a DVD/VCR player that can play both DVD
video discs and your VHS cassettes.
If you’re into recording your favorite television programs as well as being
able to play your DVDs, you might consider investing in a DVD recorder
(often abbreviated DVR). These beauties enable you to record your favorite
programs onto DVD-R or DVD-RAM discs (remember that a DVD-RAM disc
holds a whopping 9.4 GB of data and can be rewritten over 100,000 times).
Some models are so fancy that they enable you to watch programs that have
been recorded on a DVD-R or DVD-RAM disc while the recorder is in the
process of recording another TV program on the same disc!
If you have a DVD recorder and you’re like me and want to be able to record
TV programs while you’re away from home or watching another program, the
TiVo service is the only to go. TiVo enables you to program your DVD recorder
to save your favorite programs on a daily or weekly basis, any time of the day.
In addition, TiVo offers a new Home Media Option that lets you program the
recording of a TV program remotely through a computer, record a program on
a DVR in one room of your house and then play it on another DVR in a differ-
ent room, as well as use your MP3 playlists to play MP3s on MP3 discs and
organize a slideshow for viewing digital photos saved on data CDs or DVDs.
I want my MP3!
Today’s DVD players enable you to play the audio CDs and MP3 discs that
you burn with the Roxio Easy Media Creator software with no problem. But
what about the times when you’re on the move (which is probably more
often than not) and you want to take your tunes with you? For that you’re
going to need a portable digital audio player more commonly referred to as
an MP3 player.
MP3 players, like those in Apple’s amazing iPod series, are now available in
an array of music capacities and price points. In general, they run the gamut
from $69 all the way to just over $500 (ouch!). The primary determinant of
the price of an MP3 is, by and large, the amount of built-in memory the device
has (which translates directly into how many MP3 music tracks it can store
and how many minutes/hours of audio listening you have available). For
example, at the low end, the $69 Rio has only 64MB of memory which gives
you about two hours of music. At the high end, the $470 Apple iPod has 40GB
of memory which enables it to hold up to a whopping 10,000 tracks for more
than 20 hours of back-to-back playback.
49
Chapter 2: The Ins and Outs of Digital Media and Gear

Technically speaking, the Apple iPod is not really just an MP3 player. It is, in
fact, an MP4 player in that it’s capable of not only playing MP3 audio but digi-
tal audio stored in the more advanced MPEG-4 audio codec with the so-called
AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) compression. This type of compression not
only makes for smaller files but ones that some people say are equal to their
digital masters in sound quality. The only thing that you need to be aware of
is that when you purchase an iPod, you’re tied pretty heavily to the iTunes
music store (which is great in its own right), while the Roxio Easy Media
Creator software that you’ll be using to rip and burn your MP3 tracks is tied
heavily to the Napster music store.
The Care and Handling 
of CD and DVD Discs
Earlier in this chapter when I was extolling the virtues of digital and telling
you why it’s king, I went so far as to claim that if stored properly digital data
should theoretically “last forever.” Well, when it comes to the most popular
forms of digital storage, CD and DVD discs, that statement is definitely an
exaggeration bordering on a blatant untruth.
Although disc manufacturers claim a life expectancy of up to 100 years for
their CD and DVD discs, you understand that this claim is not based on any
real experience (as CD and DVD disc media haven’t been around even half
that long). Some skeptics even worry that instead of a century of good use,
even CD and DVD discs stored under the most optimum conditions may not
have a life expectancy much beyond 5 to 10 years (a bit on the short side of
forever, I’d say).
With this lowball estimate comes a strong reminder to make multiple backup
copies of your CD and DVD discs, especially those that contain data vital to
your business. (And, of course, because Roxio’s Disc Copier application is
making this kind of disc backup so ridiculously easy that you now have no
excuse for not doing it.) Of course, regardless of how long the actual life
expectancy is for the CDs and DVDs that you create with the Easy Media
Creator, improper handling of these discs can drastically reduce it to nothing
at all (they’re only made of pretty thin plastic after all).
When it comes to the proper care and handling of your CD and DVD discs,
keep these important guidelines in mind:
 Always handle your discs by the outer edge or the center hole — avoid
touching the shiny surface of the disc where the laser reads the data at
all costs
 Keep dirt and dust and all other foreign material by storing your discs in
their jewel cases
50
Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator 8 and Digital Media 

 Always store your discs upright (like books on a shelf) in their cases
 Store your discs in a cool, dry, dark environment (they don’t take kindly
to extremes of temperature and humidity)
 Remove any dirt, fingerprints, smudges, and liquids from the shiny
bottom surface of your discs with a clean cotton cloth — always wipe in
a straight line from the center toward the outer edge and never with a
circular motion going around the disc
 Always use a non-solvent-based felt-tip permanent marker when marking
the label side of your discs (and, of course, never, ever write on the
shiny side which the laser reads)
 Remove stubborn dirt or gunk from the shiny, bottom surface of your
discs with CD/DVD-cleaning fluid or isopropyl alcohol if no commercial
cleaner is available
Most of you have the good sense to keep your hands off the shiny underside
of a CD or DVD disc, knowing full well that if you mess up this surface, your
disc is toast. Unfortunately, many of you don’t realize that you can destroy
your precious disc just as fast by messing with the topside of the disc where
you put the label. The truth is that this upper dye layer of a CD or DVD disc is
actually the most sensitive part of the disc so that if you inadvertently
scratch or damage this layer, your data is cooked as good as if you’d taken a
butcher knife to the shiny underside! For this reason, it is not recommended
that you ever apply an adhesive label to your CD or DVD discs, as the adhe-
sive disc labels degrade rather quickly and if the label starts to peel off, it
could take part of the dye layer with it.
Despite the potential danger, I still cover using the Easy Media Creator’s great
Label Creator tool for making professional-looking CD and DVD disc labels in
Chapter 9. Just be aware that you’re better off labeling a disc that contains
important data that you want to last as long as possible with a non-solvent
felt-tip marking pen rather than applying a printed adhesive label.

O
ne of the primary tasks that you’ll be doing in
the Roxio Creator 8 suite is backing up the vast
amounts of data and media files that you accumulate on
your computer system. Chapter 3 of this part presents all
the information you need to use Creator Classic to create
and burn these backup discs. Chapter 4 gives you the low-
down on using Easy Media Creator’s very handy Media
Manager tool to organize and manage these data files on
your computer. Taken together, Creator Classic and Media

T
hanks to the advent of CD and DVD discs and their great capacity for
holding data (about 700MB for CD and an impressive 4.7GB for your 
average DVD), gone are any excuses for making disc backups of all your
important data. The Roxio Easy Media Creator offers you two different appli-
cations for backing up the data you rely on all over your computer system.
You can use the quick-and-easy Drag to Disc utility to make data backup discs
on the fly or you can turn to Creator Classic when you want to create a data
disc project that you can save and reuse to make copies of important folders
and files. You can also use Roxio Backup to create backup disc projects that
make scheduled backup copies of such files on a regular basis.
This chapter gives you all the information you need to use either application
for backing up your data. It also gives you some recommendations for which
type of CD or DVD disc you should use in different kinds of backup situations
(refer to Chapter 2 if you need a refresher in the differences between CD-R,
CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, and so on).

Drag-and-Drop Magic
Drag to Disc is the program to use when you need to make a onetime backup
of certain files and folders on your computer system. For example, suppose
you’ve used Easy Media Creator Media Import to capture a whole bunch of
video clips for later use in a DVD project with MyDVD and want to back them
up on disc so that you can free up the hard disk space. As you’re not going to
be backing up the video files on a regular basis, Drag to Disc is the perfect way
to make the backup disc before deleting the video clips from your hard disk.
As good as its name, to make a data disc with Drag to Disc all you have to do
is follow these easy steps:
1. Insert a blank CD or DVD disc in your computer’s CD or DVD drive.
Remember that you can’t put a DVD disc into a CD drive but that you
can put a CD disc into a DVD drive (see Chapter 2 for the reason).
2. Double-click the My Documents, My Computer, or My Network Places
icons to open the corresponding folder on your Windows desktop;
then locate and select the folders or files in them that you want copied
onto the disc.
Remember that you can select multiple folders and files by holding the
Control key as you click their icons.
3. Drag the selected folders and files over to the Drag to Disc program
window (shown in Figure 3-1) and release the mouse button.
That’s all there is to it! If your CD or DVD disc needs formatting, the Drag to
Disc program alerts to this fact (and takes care of necessary formatting). If your
disc already has data on it (meaning you forgot to label it — shame on you),
Drag to Disc alerts you to this fact and gives you an opportunity to replace
it with a blank disc. If the disc is one of the rewritable types (see Chapter 2),
you can choose to add the selected folders and files (assuming that they will
all fit within the remaining free space) to the disc.
Note that if you drag a bunch of audio files rather than just plain old regular
data files to the Drag to Disc program icon, an alert dialog box appears inform-
ing you that the files you are about to copy can be made into an audio disc
by sending them to Music Disc Creator (so that they can be played back on
other devices such as a standalone CD player or MP3 player as well as on the
computer). To make a music CD using Music Disc Creator (see Chapter 7),
click OK in this dialog box. To go ahead and have Drag to Disc perform a
straight copy of the audio files (strictly for backup purposes and use on the
computer), click the Send the Files to Drag to Disc to Make a Data Disc option
on the Choose What You Want to Do With These Files drop-down list before
you click OK. To abort the copy operation entirely, click the Cancel button.
56
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

When the Drag to Disc application finishes copying the selected folders and
files to the target CD or DVD, the program automatically opens a window for
the disc showing you its new contents. If there’s additional space, you can
then add folders and files to the disc by dragging their icons either to this
open window or the Drag to Disc desktop icon. 
When you finish, be sure to eject the CD or DVD from its drive by clicking the
Eject button on the Drag to Disc desktop icon or by pressing Alt+J (for eJect)
after making the Drag to Disc desktop icon active rather than pressing the eject
button on your CD or DVD drive. That way, the Drag to Disc application has
the chance to prepare the disc for use in other computer drives. It also saves
you from having to reach around and physically press the drive’s eject button.
Launching Drag to Disc on startup
Most of the time, you’ll want keep the Drag to Disc program icon (shown in
Figure 3-1) on your desktop so that it’s ready and available to do its backup
magic anytime you’re ready to feed it some files. With the installation of the
Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 suite, the setting to routinely launch the Drag to
Disc application whenever Windows starts up is not automatically selected.

This means that you need to follow these steps if you want the Drag to Disc
program icon to appear on your Windows desktop each time you boot your
computer:
1. If Drag to Disc is not yet running, double-click the Roxio Easy Media
Creator 8 icon on the desktop to open the Roxio Media Creator Home,
and then click the Applications link on the Home tab in the Project
List pane on the left and click the Drag To Disc link in the Utilities
column of the Applications Project window to the right.
After the Drag to Disc program icon appears, you can reduce the Home
window to an icon on the Windows taskbar by clicking its Minimize button
or close the Roxio Media Creator Home by clicking its Close button.
2. If Drag to Disc is running but its program icon is currently hidden,
click the Show Desktop icon in the Quick Launch toolbar to minimize
all other open windows or click the Drag to Disc icon in the Systems
Tray to bring the Drag to Disc desktop icon to the top.
3. Click the Menu button (the one right below the Close button with the
menu icon) on the Drag to Disc program icon to open its pop-up menu
or right-click the program icon.
The Drag to Disc pop-up menu appears.
4. Click the Settings item on the Drag to Disc shortcut menu or press Alt+S.
The Drag to Disc Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 3-2, opens.

If you want to have the desktop icon always appear in the lower-right
corner of the Windows desktop, also put a check mark in the Move to
Lower Right Corner of Desktop check box.
6. Click OK to close the Drag to Disc Settings dialog box and put your
new settings into effect.
If you don’t want the Drag to Disc program icon on your desktop each time
you start your computer, you can launch the program when needed by fol-
lowing these four steps:
1. Click the Start button on the Windows taskbar.
2. Position the mouse pointer on the All Programs item on the Start
menu to highlight it and open the All Programs submenu.
3. Position the mouse pointer on the Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 item on
the All Programs menu to highlight it and open the Creator 8 submenu.
4. Position the mouse pointer on the Data item on the Creator 8 sub-
menu and then click the DragToDisc item on the Data submenu.
If the Roxio Media Creator Home window is already open, you can forgo 
these steps involving the Start menu altogether and start the Drag to Disc
application by clicking the Drag to Disc link in the Utilities column of the
Applications Project Window (opened by clicking the Applications link on the
Home tab of the Project List pane — see Chapter 1). So too, you can manually
start Drag to Disc by clicking the Roxio Drag-to-Disc icon (the one with the
blue disc) on the Systems Tray on the right side of the Windows taskbar.
By clicking the Roxio Drag-to-Disc icon in the Systems Tray on the Windows
taskbar when the Drag to Disc application is already running, you can display
the desktop icon on top of whatever window is currently obscuring your view
of it. Use this technique to redisplay the Drag to Disc desktop icon when it’s
hidden beneath a window holding the folders and files that you selected for
copying to the CD or DVD disc. That way, you can drag the selected folders
and files to the redisplayed Drag to Disc desktop icon without having to first
resize or close their window. If you want to ensure that Drag to Disc is always
on top of any other open windows, put a check mark in the Keep In Front of
Other Windows check box in the Drag to Disc Settings dialog box (Alt+S).
You have to admit that compared to the other program icons on your Windows
desktop, the Drag to Disc desktop icon (which is technically a program window
and not an icon at all) is pretty large. You can, however, reduce this window
to a more manageable size. To do this, click the Roxio Drag-to-Disc icon on
the System tray to display the Drag to Disc desktop icon or click its title bar
to make it active and then press Alt+I (as in Icon View). Note that you can also
reduce the icon by clicking the Drag-to-Disc Icon View button — the one with
59
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

the image of two windows, one in front of the other — on the title bar of the
Drag to Disc icon, but pressing Alt+I is so much quicker and easier. Figure 3-3
shows you the Drag to Disc after reducing it this smaller size with its buttons
displayed as a slide-out menu that appears to the button’s right.
After you reduce the size of the Drag to Disc desktop icon, you can still use
it to copy selected folders and files to a CD or DVD disc. Simply drag your
selected folders and files and then drop them onto this smaller version. If you
decide that it’s too much effort to drag stuff onto this smaller desktop icon,
you can enlarge it before doing your drag-and-drop operation by pressing
Alt+I a second time.
Ejecting a disc
After you finish copying your files to a CD or DVD disc with Drag to Disc, you
need to use the program’s Eject button to open the drive rather than manu-
ally ejecting the disc by pressing the CD or DVD recorder’s eject button. By
selecting the Drag to Disc Eject button, you give yourself the opportunity to
select ejection options you want applied to the new disc in the Drag-to-Disc
Eject Options dialog box that automatically appears as soon as you click it.
As you see in Figure 3-4, this options dialog box enables you to designate
whether the CD or DVD disc will only be used on a computer like the one that
created it that runs the Drag to Disc program (in which case, you select the
This Disc Will Be Used on This Computer Only option button) or will be used
on a computer or other disc-playing device that doesn’t have the Drag to Disc
program installed on it (in which case you leave the default option button,
This Disc Will Be Used on Other Computers or Devices, selected).

Part II: Creating Data Discs 

When using the default This Disc Will Be Used on Other Computers or
Devices option, you can also protect the disc so that no one can record
over its data by selecting the Protect Disc So That It Cannot Be Written to
Again check box.
After selecting the ejection options you want applied to the disc you’ve just
created, click the Eject button at the bottom of the Drag-to-Disc Eject Options
dialog box to close it and have Drag to Disc pop open the drive tray after apply-
ing your desired settings to the disc. A dialog box showing you the progress
in preparing the disc for ejection will appear until the time that the drive tray
actually opens (this usually takes a couple of minutes).
If you always intend to apply the This Disc Will Be Used on Other Computers
or Devices option to all the discs you make with Drag to Disc and don’t antici-
pate having to choose between write-protecting some discs and not others,
you can click the Always Show This Dialog When Ejecting a Disc check box to
remove its check mark before clicking its Eject button. After that, Drag to Disc
will always apply this setting to each new disc you create without bothering
you with the display of the Drag-to-Disc Eject Options dialog box.
When ejecting a CD-R or DVD-R or DVD+R disc (as opposed to a CD-RW or
DVD-RW or DVD+RW — see Chapter 2 to find out the difference) after select-
ing the This Disc Will Be Used on Other Computers or Devices option that is
not full, an alert dialog box appears warning you that if you close the disc
now, additional information will not be readable in standard CD- or DVD-ROM
drive. If you want to be able to add more data to the disc, click the No button
in this dialog box and then continue using Drag to Disc to copy more files to
it. If you have all the files you need on the disc, go ahead and click the Yes
button to have Drag to Disc to prepare the disc for ejection and open the
drive tray.

Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

Customizing other Drag to Disc settings
You may have noticed in Figure 3-2 that the Drag-to-Disc Settings dialog box
controls more than just when and where the Drag to Disc desktop icon is dis-
played on your Windows desktop. In addition, this dialog box contains a
bunch of Eject, File Type and Administrator settings that you can modify
along with a check box that turns on disc compression and a button that
resets all your “Don’t Show Me Again” alert dialog boxes that sometimes pop
up when using the Drag to Disc application.
Modifying the Eject Settings
Beneath the Display Settings in the Drag-to-Disc Settings dialog box, you find
the following Eject Settings, which are not only very to the ones found in the
Drag-to-Disc Eject Options dialog box (discussed in the section immediately
preceding this one) but which can be used to change a disc’s ejections options
when you have deselected its Always Show This Dialog When Ejecting a Disc
check box. 
These Eject Settings include:
 Use the Disc in this Computer Only: Choose this option button only
when you’re sure that the backup CD or DVD will be used only in this
computer’s drive or a computer that uses the very same version of the
Drag to Disc application.
 Use the Disc on Other Computers or Devices: Keep this option button
selected whenever there’s a chance that you’ll use the backup CD or
DVD in a computer using a different type of operating system (such as
UNIX or LINUX) or one where Drag to Disc isn’t installed.
 Show the Eject Dialog before Ejecting a Disc: Keep this check box selected
to have the program display the Eject Dialog box whenever you physi-
cally attempt to eject the backup CD or DVD that enables you to choose
between This Disc Will Be Used on This Computer Only option button
and the default This Disc Will Be Used on Other Computers or Devices
option button before physically ejecting the disc.
 Advanced Eject Settings: Choose this option to access the Advanced
Eject Settings dialog box where you can individually modify the settings
for non-rewritable and rewritable discs that determine which version of
UDF (Universal Disk Format) is used (a standard designed to make opti-
cal media as compatible in various systems as possible) and whether or
not ISO/Joliet setting is used (enabling Macintosh systems to recognize
the long filenames from a Windows’ disc — normally you won’t have to
fiddle around with these settings as the they’re already set to make your
discs as readable as possible by diverse computer systems).
62
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

Changing the File Type Handling Settings
In addition to the Display Settings and Eject Settings, the Drag-to-Disc Settings
dialog box also enables you to change the File Type Handling Settings and
the Administrator Settings. By default, all of the File Type Handling Settings
prompt you only with the options for a particular file type (such as audio
files saved as MP3, WAV, WMA, or OGG files or graphic images saved as BMP,
JPG, or TIF files, and the like) when you add that type of file to the disc. 
If you want to predetermine how Drag to Disc handles a particular type of file
when you add that type of file to the disc, click the File Type Handling button
in the Drag-to-Disc Settings dialog box. Drag to Disc then opens the Default File
Type Handling dialog box (shown in Figure 3-5). Then, click the drop-down
button for the particular type of file (Audio Files, MP3 Files, Photos or Images,
and so on) and click the appropriate option on its drop-down menu.
For example, if you click the drop-down button to the right of Audio Files, you
can choose between the following two handling options:
 Send the Files to Music Disc Creator to Make an Audio Disc
 Send the Files to Drag-to-Disc to Make a Data Disc
The handling options for the other file types listed in the Default File Type
Handling dialog box are similar except that they target the Easy Media
Creator 8 application designed to deal with that particular type of file in addi-
tion to sending the files to Drag to Disc to make a data disc (so that the Video
Clips option enables you to send the files to DVD Builder to make a video disc).

dialog box to

63
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

Changing the Administrator Settings (if you dare)
When you click the Administrator Settings button in the Drag-to-Disc Settings
dialog box, an Administrator Settings dialog box appears with the following
four check box options:
 Verify RW Media on Full Format (checked by default) to have Drag to Disc
double-check rewritable media (CD-RW, CD+RW, DVD-RW, and DVD+RW)
for errors when fully formatting the disc
 Verify Recording Using Read After Write to have Drag to Disc verify the
data it burns to disc by comparing it to the original data on your hard disc
(selecting this option slows down the recording process but ensures
greater data fidelity)
 Enable EasyWrite (MRW) Support (checked by default) to be able to
perform a quick format of a rewritable disc on an EasyWrite recorder
(also known as Mt.Rainier, this refers to types of CD and DVD recorders
that use a standard developed by Philips for recording CD-RW and
DVD+RW discs)
 Use UDF 2.0 Instead of 1.5 (For DVD Only) to burn the disc using an
older, less compatible version of UDF (Universal Disc Format) — select
this option only when you are using Drag to Disc to burn a DVD-R for
playback in a consumer DVD recorder
 Protect All Non-Rewritable Media So That They Cannot Be Written to
After Ejecting to prevent Classic Creator from attempting to reformat
and then write over new data on non-rewritable CDs and DVDs
For heaven’s sake, don’t go messing with these settings unless you know what
you’re doing or you’re told to make changes to them by someone who does
(or who you can blame if your data discs no longer work in the company’s
computers). Changing these settings may not only degrade the performance
of these discs to a crawl but make them incompatible with different computer
systems used in your organization!
Turning on disc compression
The last option on the Drag-to-Disc Settings dialog box (besides the Reset All
“Don’t Show Me Again” Check Boxes button that enables you to reactivate
the display of all those lovely alert dialog boxes) is the Turn On Compression
check box. When you click this check box option to put a check mark in it,
Drag to Disc automatically compresses all of the files that you drop on its
desktop icon as it burns them to disc. This is great in that it reduces the size
of each of the files you add, enabling you to add more files to a given disc. 
64
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

Using compression does, however, mean that Windows computers which
aren’t running the latest copy of Drag to Disc won’t be able to decompress
and read the files unless the computer has a copy of the UDF (Universal Disc
Format) reader installed on it. It also means that computers not running the
Windows operating system (such as Macs and computers running under
UNIX or LINUX) won’t be able to decompress and read the files. Keep these
limitations in mind when making discs for coworkers or clients who may not
be so fortunate as to have the Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 suite or the UDF
reader installed on their Windows systems or don’t run Windows at all.
Also keep in mind that you can use the compression option when making a
disc with an EasyWrite recorder.
Manually formatting a blank disc
Although Drag to Disc will automatically prompt you to format any blank disc
as soon as you attempt to add folders or files to it, you can also manually format
the disc before you start dragging-and-dropping your files. To do this, insert
the blank CD or DVD disc in the appropriate computer drive, launch Drag to
Disc if it is not already running, and then follow these steps:
1. If the Drag to Disc desktop icon is hidden beneath other windows on
the desktop, click the Roxio Drag-to-Disc icon on the taskbar’s System
Tray to display it.
2. Click the Menu button on the Drag to Disc program icon and then
click the Format Disc item or press Alt+F.
The Drag-to-Disc Format Options dialog box shown in Figure 3-6 appears.

65
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

3. Click the Volume Label text box and enter a descriptive volume label
for your new disc.
Volume labels appear at the bottom of the Drag to Disc desktop icon
after the drive letter. When entering a volume label, keep in mind that
they can be no longer than 11 characters total and can’t contain spaces
or any of the following characters: 
\(backslash
/ (forward slash)
: (colon
; (semicolon)
* (asterisk)
? (question mark)
“ (double quotes)
< (less than)
> (greater than)
| (vertical bar)
+ (plus sign)
= (equal sign)
. (period)
, (comma)
[ (open square brace)
] (close square brace)
4. Click the Enable Compression on This Disc check box if you want to
compress all the files you add to the formatted disc.
Keep in mind the limitations on using compression (listed under
the Remember icon in the preceding section) before you select
this option. 
5. If you’re formatting a rewritable disc, you will want to do a full rather
than a quick format on it, so make sure that the Full Format the Entire
Disc Before Using It option button is selected.
Selecting this option button automatically deselects the default Quick
Format Allows You to Begin Using the Disc Quickly option button.
6. Click the OK button to begin formatting your blank disc.
66
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

Instead of deleting the contents on a previously recorded disc that is rewritable
(such as CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, and DVD-RAM), you can completely get
rid of all its files by manually formatting it using these same steps for manu-
ally formatting a blank disc. Just be sure that you don’t want any of the files
on the rewritable disc before you manually reformat it, as there’s no way to
retrieve files after a disc has been reformatted.
You can use the Drag to Disc program’s Rename Disc command to change the
volume label for your CD or DVD disc. Make the program’s desktop icon active;
click the Menu button and then click the Rename Disc command on its pop-up
menu or press Alt+R. Then replace the existing volume label with a new name
(following the guidelines pointed out following Step 3 in the preceding steps)
in the Name for Disc text box in the Drag to Disc Rename Disc dialog box
before you click OK. 
Note that renaming a disc’s volume label in this manner does not change the
disc name that appears on the title bar of any window you open on the disc
with the Windows Explorer; the original volume label which gives rise to the
disc name continues to be associated with this disc according to Windows.
The new volume label does appear, however, in the Label text box if you open
a Properties dialog box for the disc.
Also, the new volume name that you give the disc does not appear at the
bottom of the Drag to Disc desktop icon until the next time you insert the
disc in the drive. This is because ejecting and re-inserting the disc in the
drive is the only way to force the Drag to Disc application to read the new
volume label and display it in the desktop icon (in other words, unlike your
Web browser, the application does not have a refresh button).
Editing a data disc
After you copy files to a CD or DVD disc using Drag to Disc, you can use those
files just as you would any files saved on your computer’s hard disk or disks
to which you have access on a network. The biggest question in editing a
backup CD or DVD created with Drag to Disc is whether the disc is of the
rewritable or nonrewritable type.
Although you can theoretically edit the contents of either type of disc, keep
in mind that only rewritable discs actually update the disc contents to reflect
your changes. Therefore, practically speaking, the editing of a rewritable can
include reformatting the disc so that you can entirely replace its contents
rather piecemeal editing of its folders and files.
67
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

Displaying the properties of a data disc
Before you start editing the contents of a data disc, especially before adding
new files to it, you’ll probably want to get the basic statistics on the disc,
including whether the disc is rewritable or nonrewritable or how much disc
space is used and how much is free. The easiest way to get this information is
to follow these steps:
1. Put the backup CD or DVD disc in the appropriate computer drive.
2. If the Drag to Disc desktop icon is hidden beneath other open windows
on the desktop, click the Roxio Drag-to-Disc icon on the taskbar’s
System Tray to display on top.
3. Click the Menu button on the Drag to Disc desktop icon and then click
Disc Properties on its pop-up menu or press Alt+O (for PrOperties).
Drag to Disc opens a Disc Properties dialog box similar to the one shown in
Figure 3-7. Note in this figure that in addition to getting basic stats on the disc
(including its type, total capacity, and used and free space), you can also
change its volume name in it Label text box.
Displaying the contents of a data disc
The easiest way to perform routine editing operations on a data disc (such as
adding, updating, or deleting files) is to open a window showing its contents and
then manipulate the file icons in this window. To display the contents of a CD
or DVD, make the Drag to Disc desktop icon active, click its Menu button, and
click the View Disc Contents item on its pop-up menu or press Alt+V (for View).
Figure 3-7:
Use the Disc
Properties
dialog box to

type of disc
(rewritable
or nonrewrit-
able) and the
amount of

68
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

Drag to Disc responds by opening a separate disc window showing all the
folders and files that you’ve copied on it. Because this is a standard Windows
Explorer window, you can manipulate its contents much as you would a window
showing the contents of your computer’s hard disk or any disk to which you
have access on your network.
You can click the Details button at the bottom of the left panel of a window
showing a data disc’s contents to display the total capacity and free space on
that disc instead of having to resort to using the Drag to Disc program’s Disc
Properties option to get this information.
Copying files from a data disc
After the folders and files on the data disc are displayed in its own window,
you can then perform standard file operations on them such as cutting and
copying their files to your computer’s hard disk or disks that are available to
you on your network. 
To copy folders or particular files from the CD or DVD data disc to another
disk on your computer system disk, open a window for its disk on your hard
disk and then simply select and drag the icons for the folders or files you
want to copy over to that window. To copy selected files into a particular
folder on the computer disk, drop their files on the particular folder into
which they’re to be copied.
To cut files from the CD or DVD data disc that you can then copy onto one
of your computer’s disks, open a window with the data disc’s files and then
select their folder and file icons before you press Ctrl+X (you can also do this
by selecting Edit➪Cut on the disc window’s menu bar). After cutting the files
from the data disc, you can insert one of your computer’s disks by making its
window active and then selecting Edit➪Paste on its menu or by pressing Ctrl+V.
If you cut folders or files from nonrewritable CD or DVD discs (see Chapter 2
for a list), their names are removed from the disc, but the space they take up
on the disc is not recovered. When, however, you cut folders or files from a
rewritable CD or DVD disc, the space they took up is recovered and you can
reuse by copying new files in their place. After all is said and done, this ability
to reuse the space from file you’ve cut or deleted from the disc is the essential
difference between rewritable and nonrewritable CDs and DVDs.
Deleting files from a data disc
The story on deleting disc files or replacing them with newer, updated ver-
sions is pretty much the same as when cutting files from the disc. To delete
files from a CD or DVD data disc, open its window, select the files’ icons, and
press the Delete key or choose Edit➪Delete on the disc window’s menu bar.
69
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

When you delete files from a rewritable disc, their filenames are not only
removed from the disc, but the file space they occupied is recovered on the
disc. When, however, you delete them from a nonrewritable disc, their file-
names are removed from the disc (rendering them impossible to access)
but their file space is not recovered for later reuse.
Files that you delete from a data CD or DVD are not placed in your computer’s
Recycle Bin. Therefore, when you press the Delete key or choose Delete on the
window’s Edit menu, the files are gone for good. This means that you need to
be really careful to not select files that you really don’t want to delete, espe-
cially if you don’t have copies of the files saved elsewhere.
You can use the Drag to Disc program’s Erase Disc option (Alt+E) to delete
all the files on a data disc. However, keep in mind that erasing all the files
does not actually remove their data from the disc. Instead, this option
removes only the list of folder and filenames on it. This means that it is 
possible for someone to reconstruct the list and have access to some or all
of the disc’s contents. If the disc contains extremely sensitive data, you’re
much safer physically destroying the disc so that it can never be read again
(you can do this most easily by peeling off the disc’s label, rendering it com-
pletely unreadable). 
If your goal is to reuse the disc for backing up files, you’re better off refor-
matting the disc (see “Manually formatting a blank disc” earlier in this 
chapter for details) and before copying new files, provided that you’re
using a rewritable disc.
Replacing files on a data disc
You can replace files on a backup CD or DVD by dragging file icons with the
same filenames and dropping them onto the Drag to Disc desktop icon or the
CD or DVD’s open window. When you do this, Microsoft Windows opens a
Confirm File Replace dialog box that gives you the opportunity not to go ahead
with overwriting a particular file with one of the same name by clicking the
No instead of the Yes button. If do click the Yes button, Windows replaces the
identically named disc file with the one you’ve dragged onto the Drag to Disc
desktop icon or into the CD or DVD disc window.
When you replace a file on a rewritable disc, the original file is deleted and only
the new replacement file takes its place. When dealing with a nonrewritable
disc, however, only the name of the original file is removed from the disc so
that both the data in the original and replacement file remains on the disc,
taking up twice the space.
70
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

Repairing discs with ScanDisc
ScanDisc is a great little utility that’s part of the Drag to Disc application. It
enables you often to repair CD or DVD data discs whose files have become
corrupted and somehow rendered unreadable. To start the ScanDisc utility to
scan a CD or DVD data disc for errors and then, possibly try to fix them, click
the Menu button on the Drag to Disc desktop program icon and then click
Launch ScanDisc on its pop-up menu.
When you select the Launch ScanDisc option at the bottom of the Drag to Disc
shortcut menu, the ScanDisc dialog box appears. Click the Scan button to have
the program check your CD or DVD data disc for errors. The ScanDisc dialog
box then changes to display its progress in checking the disc. When the util-
ity finishes checking the entire contents of the data disc, a new dialog box
showing files that have been pegged as damaged or lost (lost files are those
that don’t have filenames associated with them) may appear. 
If you should be so lucky as to have a disc with no problems, no further
dialog box appears (see Figure 3-8) and you can click the Done button to
close the ScanDisc program and go on your merry way.
If you do receive an indication of problems in the form of a File Recovery
dialog box listing the damaged or lost files that are considered recoverable,
you should take steps to copy these files to another destination on your hard
disk before taking the final step of having ScanDisc try to repair the disc.
That way, you’ll have the data files intact even if ScanDisc can’t repair the
damaged disc.

ning all the
files on a CD
or DVD,

71
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

To copy the recoverable or lost files (which are given sequential numerical
filenames when they’re copied that you can then later change), click the Yes
button in the dialog box and then select the drive and folder that will serve
as the place to which the damaged or lost files are copied in the Destination
Drive drop-down list box.
When selecting the destination drive, you can select any local drive on your
computer except for the one that contains the CD or DVD that you’re scan-
ning for errors. Also note that you’re computer is part of a network; you can’t
copy the recoverable or lost files to any drive or folder on the network unless
that drive or folder has previously been mapped as such, meaning that it’s
been assigned its own drive letter between A and Z (to do this, open the My
Documents Window and then choose Tools➪Map Network Drive and follow
the prompts in Map Network Drive dialog box).
After designating the destination drive, you then designate the folder on that
drive into which you want the recoverable files copied (do this by selecting
the folder in the Destination Folder list or by clicking the New Folder button
and creating a new folder). After indicating the drive and folder location, click
the Copy button in the File Recovery dialog box to begin copying the files.
When the copies are made, click the Done button.
After enabling you to copy and recover damaged and lost files to another loca-
tion on your computer system, the ScanDisc utility prompts you to attempt
to repair the damaged disc to make it usable again. Click the Yes button when
the program asks you if you want to repair the disc; then click the Done button
when the ScanDisc program finishes this operation (including checking the
integrity of the files).
ScanDisc is not able to repair all damaged discs. You may find that even after
attempting to repair a data disc, the disc is still unreadable in your computer’s
drive. You may also find that after repairing a disc, both Drag to Disc and
Windows can no longer access the files on it. For this reason, be sure that
your data disc is essentially a disc which backs up data that you also have
elsewhere and from which you can generate a new backup CD or DVD.
Turning to Creator Classic 
for Regular Backups
Creator Classic is the application you want to turn to when you need to make
CD or DVD data discs on a regular basis from particular sets of data files or
when you want to make a multimedia CD or DVD disc that mixes audio, graph-
ics (usually photos), and video files. To start Creator Classic from the Roxio
72
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

Media Creator Home, click the Creator Classic link in the Applications Project
Window or on the Data tab in the Project List pane.
The Creator Classic window similar to the one shown in Figure 3-9 then appears
on your screen. (Note for this particular figure, I have taken the extra steps of
adding some graphics files in the Data Disc Project pane to activate its but-
tons and of selecting an audio file in one my folders in the Select Source pane
so as to enable the Tag Editor and Edit buttons at the top of this pane as well
as playback controls at the bottom.)

Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

As you can see in this figure, the Creator Classic window is divided into
three areas: 
 Tasks pane on the left side (subdivided into Projects and Other Tasks)
where you indicate the type of project to create
 Select Source pane on the upper right where you locate the files you
want to backup
 Data Disc Project pane on the lower right, which shows you all the files
you add to the project (this pane changes name if you select a Multimedia
Disc or Bootable Disc project as described in the section immediately
following)
Opening a new disc project
When you first launch Creator Classic, the program is set to start a new data
disc project (that is, a disc that contains only data files). If this is the kind of
project that you need to make, all you need to do is start locating the files in
the Select Source pane and then add them to Data Project pane.
Data disc projects are not the only ones supported by Creator Classic.
In addition to the default Data Disc project, you can create the following
audio projects as well:
 Multimedia Disc that contains audio, video, or graphics files (or a mix-
ture of thereof) for which you want play lists to be created (see “Making
a multimedia disc” later in this chapter)
 Bootable Disc that contains enough of the Windows operating system
files to enable you to boot your computer from the CD or DVD disc
(see “Making a bootable data disc” later in this chapter)
Don’t get confused by all this talk about multimedia discs into thinking that
your Data Disc projects can only consist of standard data file types like those
that contain text, financial data, and the like. If your intention is to back up
the music and video clips on a CD or DVD disc (as opposed to playing them
in some sort of play list sequence on another device such as a standalone CD
or DVD player), you can add any of these file types as data files to your data
disc project (provided that the file type is not specifically excluded in the
data disc project settings — see “Changing the Data Disc Project Settings”
later in this chapter for details). Just keep in mind that the audio or video
files saved to the resulting CD or DVD disc that you burn from the Data Disc
project can only be accessed by computer programs such as the Windows
Media Player when the disc is placed in your CD-ROM drive.

Part II: Creating Data Discs 

Changing the Data Disc Project Settings
When you start a new Data Disc project, Creator Classic applies certain default
settings that you may want to review and possibly change before you start
adding files to the project. To review and change the Data Disc Project Settings,
click the View and Edit Your Project Settings button to the immediate left of the
Burn button (the one farthest to the right with the flames coming out of a disc)
at the top of the Project pane. The Project Properties dialog box shown in
Figure 3-10 then appears with its three tabs: General, Advanced, and Exclude
File Types.
In addition to displaying information about the type of disc and the number
of files and used space currently in the project, the General tab contains the
following options that you can modify:
 Volume Name to change the volume label or name of the disc
 File System to choose between three file systems: ISO9660 (for discs to be
used on diverse platforms including DOS, UNIX, Macs, OS/2, and Windows),
Joliet (to support the use of filenames up to 64 characters long — ISO
filenames are restricted to the DOS 8.3 naming system), and UDF 102
(for optical discs such as DVDs, especially when burning files larger
than 1GB)
Figure 3-10:

75
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

 Bridge to choose between ISO9660 Bridge (to support the UDF and Joliet
file system), Joliet Bridge (to support the Joliet, UDF, and ISO file system),
and No Bridge (to support no file system other than the one currently
selected)
 Validate Source Files Before Recording when you want Creator Classic
to verify that none of the source files have been moved, deleted, renamed,
or otherwise modified since you added them (if Creator Classic does find
such a file, it prompts you to remove the file from the Disc Project)
 Automatically Verify File System After Recording to have Creator Classic
compare the files burned to the CD with the original source files on your
computer system
 Do Not Split Files in Multi-Disc Projects to prevent Creator Classic from
splitting up files when more than one CD or DVD disc is required to accom-
modate all the data files you’ve specified to be copied to the data disc
 Enable Compression to compress the files in the data project as they
are copied to the blank CD or DVD
You can’t use the ISO9660 file system for any project that you intend to encrypt
(see “Encrypting the data disc” later in this chapter) for any project that
spans more than one disc (see “Burning a multi-disc data project” later in
this chapter).
Note that if you want the modifications you make to these settings on the
General tab to be new Data Disc default settings, click Set as Default button
at the bottom of the this tab.
The settings on the Advanced tab of the Project Properties dialog box enable
you to record various vital statistics about the disc’s content such as the name
of the disc’s publisher and the name of the text file that contains the copyright
information and to determine which date to use as the disc’s publishing date.
Click the Advanced tab to review and change any of these settings: 
 Publisher Name to enter the name of the publisher (up to 64 characters
long when using the Joliet file system and 128 when using the ISO9660
file system)
 Prepared By to enter the name of the person or company who prepared
the disc (up to 64 characters long when using the Joliet file system and
128 when using the ISO9660 file system)
 Use Original File Date option button to timestamp the disc with the date
that the disc project is started (this is the date shown in the combo box
to the immediate right of the date options)
 Use Date When Disc is Written option button to timestamp the disc
with the date when you burn the disc
76
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

 Use This Date option button to timestamp the disc with the date you
select (when you click this button, the date combo box to the right
becomes active and you can type in a new date or click the drop-down
button and select one on the pop-up calendar that appears)
The Exclude File Types tab on the Project Properties dialog box enables you
to indicate what types of data files should not be added to the disc project.
Any file types that you indicate on this settings tab are automatically not
copied to the Project pane even when you’ve inadvertently selected them for
adding in the Select Source pane. When you click the Exclude tab, the Project
Properties dialog box displays a list of all the individual file types you can
keep out in the Add Files area. To exclude a particular type of file, simply
click its check box to add a checkmark to it.
Below the Add Files area on the Exclude tab you find the following two check
boxes and button:
 Exclude All Hidden Files to automatically exclude all hidden files in any
group that you select in the Select Source pane
 Exclude All System Files to automatically exclude all system files in any
group that you select in the Select Source pane
 Select/Clear All button that you can click to select all the file types in
the Add Files area or, alternately, deselect them if they are currently all
selected
When you finish changing all the settings on the Project Properties dialog
box, click OK to close this dialog box and put your modifications into effect.
Titling the disc project
The first thing you may want to do after starting a new disc project is replace
the temporary title that Creator Classic automatically assigns your project
(that serial-number type volume label that appears in the Disc Name text box
at the top of the Data Disc Project pane) with a volume label of your own. To
do this, drag through the serial-number type name in the Disc Name text box
to select it and then type in your replacement volume label. When naming the
disc project, you need to follow the naming guidelines outlined in the steps
on manually formatting a disc for use with Drag to Disc (see “Manually for-
matting a blank disc” earlier in this chapter).
After you type in the new volume label name in the Disc Name, this new name
automatically appears to the right of the Data Project icon in the work area of
the Data Disc Project pane below.
77
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

Selecting the size of the disc to use
As you add files and folders to a new data disc project, Creator Classic keeps
track of the amount of free space by estimating the size of the current project
in relation to the total capacity of size of disc currently shown selected at the
bottom of the Creator Classic window. This relationship is displayed graphically
by the length of the bar to the right of the Disc Size field as well as stated in
MB or GB as Estimated Free Space immediately below this bar.
If you ultimately intend to burn your data disc project on a disc that is larger
or smaller than one currently shown as the Disc Size, you need to select the
correct disc size. To do this, click the currently shown disc size or the drop-
down button to the right of the Disc Size field and then click the correct size
in the pop-up menu. You can choose between any of the following disc sizes:
 21 min (185MB)
 24 min (210MB)
 74 min (650MB)
 80 min (703MB)
 DVD 4.7GB
 DVD 8.5GB
As soon as you choose a new disc size, Creator Classic adjusts the bar show-
ing the estimated amount of disc space needed for the number of files added
to the project. If more than one disc of the size selected is required in order
to accommodate the copying of all the files in the data project, this fact will
appear both on the bar and in the status area below.
Adding data files to a disc project
When adding files and folders to your disc project, you have a choice
between two similar methods:
 Using the drag-and-drop method to drag selected files from the Source
pane and drop them either on the Disc or Folder icon or directly in file
list in the Data Disc Project pane
 Select the files in the Source pane and then click the Add button and
have Creator Classic add them to the Data Disc Project pane for you
I use the first drag-and-drop method when I want to add entire folders (with all
of their subfolders and files) to a project. To add an entire folder to a project,
I click the Folders button in the Select Source pane and locate the folder in
78
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

the Folders hierarchy displayed in its own pane in the upper left and drag its
folder icon and drop it on top of the Disc icon (representing the entire data
disc project) in the Data Disc Project pane.
I happen to prefer the second method using the Add button when adding
groups of individual data files to a new project, regardless of whether these
files are located using the Smart Views, My Albums, Folders, or My MediaSpace
(UPnP) button at the top of the Select Source pane.
When you use the drag-and-drop method to add folders and files to a disc
project, you don’t have to be concerned about where you drop the folders
and files in the Data Disc Project pane. Creator Classic automatically adjusts
the list of folders and data files to display all them all in strict alphabetical
order.
As you add files to the Data Disc Project pane, Creator Classic not only dis-
plays a list of their filenames but also indicates the current estimated project
size and the number of discs required. It also displays the free space remaining
on the latest disc both in the form of the slider that appears to the immediate
right of the Disc Size drop-down list box and in MB or GB free in the Estimated
Project Size directly below (see Figure 3-11). Use these stats to determine how
many files you can get on a disc and how many discs you need when burning
the project.
Figure 3-11:
As you add
data files to
a project,
their file-
names
appear in
the Project
pane along
with the
estimated
project size.
79
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

If you try to add a file of a type that is on your excluded files list or that is a
normally hidden file or system file that is excluded from copying, Creator
Classic displays a Warning dialog box at the time you try to add it. To be able
to add the file, you need to click OK to get rid of the Warning dialog box, and
then click the View and Edit Your Project Settings button to open the Project
Settings dialog box. There, click the Exclude File Types tab and remove the
check mark from the type of file that was rejected or from the Exclude All
Hidden Files or Exclude All System Files (if the file was either hidden or a
system file) before you click OK. After changing the exclude file settings to
include the rejected file, you should now be able to add it to the data disc
project without any further incident.
Selecting the source of the files for your project
The Select Source pane (see Figure 3-9) contains four tabs: Smart Views,
My Albums, Folders, and My MediaSpace (UPnP). These tabs enable you
to quickly select a new source for the data files you add to a project:
 Smart Views shows you all the media files that Roxio Easy Media
Creator 8 has identified on your computer system organized by type
(photos, videos, music, and media projects)
 My Albums shows you all the media files that you have organized by
theme into albums (which can span different disks and folders)
 Folders shows you all the drives, folders, and files on your computer
system using the familiar Windows Explorer hierarchy of drives, folders,
subfolders, and files
 My MediaSpace (UPnP) shows you all the media on the computers on
your home network and other shared devices (such as a DVD recorder
or TiVo connected to the network) to which you have access
See Chapter 4 for more information on these different types of sources, includ-
ing how to use Media Manager to create and maintain Smart Views, your own
albums, and your own MediaSpace using the Universal Plug n’ Play standard
(which is what UPnP stands for).
Removing files from your project
If you find that you’ve added folders or files to your data disc project in error,
you can easily remove them from the project. Select their folder or filenames
in the Project pane and then click the Remove from Project button at the top
of the pane. Creator Classic then displays a Warning alert dialog box asking
you if you’re sure that you want to remove the selected file(s) from the pro-
ject. To go ahead and remove the files, click the Yes button. If you’re not sure
that you want to remove the files, click the No button instead. 
80
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

Keep in mind as well that deleting files from a data disc project only removes
them from the Project pane. It does not remove them from your hard disk, so
you have no worries should you delete a file from a data project in error. You
can always re-add it to the Project pane from its folder on the hard disk in the
Source pane.
Encrypting the data disc
If your data disc project contains sensitive data such as personnel records or
corporate financial data, you can encrypt and password-protect the CD or DVD
so that only those who have the password can decrypt the data and gain access
to its files. Just be careful when using this encryption and password-protection
feature as you must know the password exactly as you entered it in order to
be able to decrypt the disc files (don’t lose that password or the data is as
good as gone!). Also be aware that the only way to decrypt an encrypted disc
so that you can open the data files and have access to their data is by using
the Roxio Retrieve utility to retrieve the files to your computer’s hard disk
(see “Recovering Data with Roxio Retrieve” later in this chapter).
Technically speaking, you can encrypt the files on a data disc without pass-
word protecting the disc. In such a case, anyone to whom you distribute the
disc must still use Roxio Retrieve to be able to read the files, although they
could do so without having to worry about a password. In my view, if the files
on the data disc are sensitive enough to encrypt their data, the disc should
surely be password-protected as well.
To encrypt the files for the data disc project you’re building in Creator
Classic, you follow these steps:
1. Click the Set Encryption Settings for Your Project button on Project
pane’s toolbar (the one with the open lock that is two to the left of the
Burn button at the very end of the toolbar).
Creator Classic then opens the Encryption dialog box similar to the one
shown in Figure 3-12.
2. Click the Enable File Encryption (128 bit) check box.
This turns on the file encryption that requires the use of the Roxio
Retrieve utility to decrypt.
3. To password-protect the disc, click the Password text box, and then
enter a password of at least six characters.
In order to complete the password-protection of the disc, you must now
re-enter the password in the Re-enter Password text box exactly as you
originally entered it in the Password text box.
81
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

4. Press Tab or click the Re-enter Password text box and then retype
the password exactly as you originally entered it in the Password
text box.
If you want, you can hide the display of the filenames on the data disc as
well as prevent their use by any unauthorized parties by performing Step 5.
If you don’t perform Step 5, anyone can get a list of the filenames on the
disc using the Windows explorer (or some program like it) but they still
can’t open any of the files without being able to correctly reproduce the
password and then using Roxio Retrieve to copy the encrypted files to
their computer’s hard disk.
5. (Optional) Click the Hide File Names on Disc check box to block the
display of the filenames in any Windows directory listing.
6. Click the OK button to close the Encryption dialog box and put your
encryption settings into effect.
Making a multimedia data disc
Version 8 of Creator Classic offers a new Multimedia Disc option that enables
you to create multimedia discs containing any type of mix of audio, video, and
graphics files. Multimedia discs differ from regular data discs that contain these
same types of media files in that these discs can be played on devices other
than your computer.
In order to provide this kind of playback on devices outside the computer
such as standalone CD and DVD players, a multimedia data disc conforms
to one or both of the two current standard formats for music playlists and
video menus: HighMAT and/or MPV (which stands for MusicPhotoVideo).
Figure 3-12:

82
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

When you start a new multimedia disc project by clicking the Multimedia Disc
link in the Projects pane of the Roxio Creator Classic window, the program
automatically enables both these standards for the new project. To deselect
either or both of these formats, click the View and Edit Your Project Settings
and then select either the Enable MPV and/or the Enable HighMAT check boxes
on the General tab of the Project Settings dialog box before clicking OK.
Types of media files supported in multimedia data discs
When the HighMAT and MPV formats are selected for a multimedia disc pro-
ject, Creator Classic restricts the type of media files that you can add to your
project. The program does this by accepting only certains types of audio, video,
and graphics files as determined by the type of extension used in their filename
(see Table 3-1).
Table 3-1

.mp4, .m4a, .wav, .wma
If you try to add a file to the Multimedia Disc Project pane that does not use an
accepted filename extension as prescribed by the playlist and menu format(s)
you’ve selected (such as a Word file with a .doc filename extension or a text
file with a .txt extension), Creator Classic displays a Warning dialog box listing
the extensions for the allowable file formats in the HighMAT and MPV standards
and telling you that any file not sporting one of these filename extensions will
not be added to the project. Indeed, when you click OK to close this Warning
dialog box, you will find that the name of the unsupported file you tried to add
has not been added to the list of filenames in the Multimedia Disc Project pane.
Adding tracks from a commercial audio CD
In addition to adding audio, video, and graphics files to your multimedia disc
project (in exactly the same manner as for regular data disc projects described
earlier in this chapter) already stored on your computer system, you can also
add tracks from commercially-produced audio CDs (you know the ones that
you purchase). The only trick to doing this is that the tracks that you want to
add to the project must first be copied from the CD to one of the drives on
your computer and during copying are automatically converted to the MP3
audio file format.
83
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

The steps for adding tracks from an audio CD to the multimedia disc project
you’re creating are as follows:
1. Insert the audio CD containing the tracks you want to add in your
computer’s CD drive.
2. Click the Folders tab at the top of the Select Source pane and then
click the icon representing your computer’s CD drive.
When you do this, Creator Classic displays a list of the tracks on the
Track View tab on the right side of the Select Source pane. If your com-
puter has Internet access, the program will automatically connect to the
Gracenote Web site and add the track names to this list. If your computer
doesn’t have Internet access or the audio CD is not listed in the Gracenote
online database, the list on the Track View tab just shows the track num-
bers rather than their names.
3. Select the track or tracks that you want included in the multimedia
disc project on the Track View tab in the Select Source pane.
To select all the tracks, press Ctrl+A. To select a sequential group, click
the first track in the group and then hold down the Shift key as you click
the last one. To select nonsequential tracks, hold down the Ctrl key as
you click the tracks.
If you want to listen to a track before selecting it, click it on the Track
View tab and then click the Play button (the first one with the triangle
pointing to the right) in the playback controls that appear at the bottom
of the Track View tab. To stop the playback, click the Stop button (the
filled-in rectangle).
4. Click the Add button or drag the selected tracks to the Multimedia
Disc Project pane.
Note that you can add a single track by double-clicking it.
5. Click the OK button in the Warning dialog box that appears showing
you the allowable HighMAT and MPV file formats.
As soon as the Warning dialog box closes, the Copy Tracks from Audio
CD – Options dialog box opens (see Figure 3-13). Here, you select the
destination, the file type, and the compression settings to use.
By default, Creator Classic copies the selected tracks to the folder desig-
nated as My Music on your hard disk. To change this destination, click
the Browse button and select a new folder in the Select Directory dialog
box and then click OK.
By default, the program converts the selected tracks to MP3 files using
constant bit rate compression and the 128 kbps (11x compression), in
other words, the setting that is almost smack dab in between the smallest
size and the best quality. To select a different audio file format, click the
new audio type in the File Type drop-down list. 
84
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

To select compression settings for better quality (and subsequently
larger files), you drag the compression rate slider toward Best Quality.
To select compression settings for smaller size (and subsequently lesser
audio quality), you drag this slider towards Smaller Size.
6. Change any of the default settings that need changing in the Copy
Tracks from Audio CD – Options dialog box and then click its Start
Copy button.
As soon as you click Start Copy, as Copying Audio Files dialog box show-
ing the progress of the track copying to the destination folder.
7. When the track copying is complete, click Close button in the Copying
Audio Files dialog box.
As soon as the Copying Audio Files dialog box closes, the names of
the copied tracks now appear in the list of files in the Multimedia Disc
Project pane.
Making a bootable data disc
Creator Classic makes it possible to create a bootable CD-ROM. A bootable
disc in essence emulates a 1.44 floppy disk drive (the so-called A: floppy drive
that is so often missing from today’s computer’s, especially in laptops which
are normally configured with only a CD or DVD disc drive) and that contains
the Windows system files necessary to boot your computer. Such a disc enables
you to boot your computer from your computer’s CD or DVD drive in the event
that you experience some kind of glitch with your computer’s hard disk that
prevents it from using its own Windows system files.

85
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

Before you can use Creator Classic to create a bootable disc, you have to
ascertain that your computer system’s BIOS settings support this feature.
While most computers based on the Pentium-class computer chip support
this feature, you may still have to check your computer documentation to
learn how to access your system’s BIOS settings and whether or not you have
actually enabled a bootable CD-ROM option.
If your CD or DVD drive is connected to your computer via a SCSI host adapter,
it may have its own BIOS. You still need to check the drive’s documentation
to verify that the SCSI adapter supports the bootable CD-ROM feature and, if
so, how to activate it for your drive.
Assuming that your system supports the bootable CD-ROM feature and that
you have activated it for your computer, you can then create a bootable
CD-ROM using these steps:
1. Place a blank CD-ROM into your computer’s CD or DVD drive.
Make sure that this is a new CD-R disc and not one that you’ve burned
before and then later on erased.
2. Launch Creator Classic and then click the Bootable Disc link in the
Projects pane on the left side of the Roxio Creator Classic window.
The Choose Type of Bootable Disc dialog box shown in Figure 3-14 opens
where you select between generating the disc from an existing floppy disk
or from a boot image file that’s installed on your computer’s hard disk
when you install the Roxio Easy Media Creator 8.
3. If you have a bootable 1.44MB floppy disk that you want used in mak-
ing the bootable CD-ROM, make sure that the Floppy Disk Emulation
(1.44MB) option is selected in the Bootable Disc Type field. If your
Figure 3-14:

Part II: Creating Data Discs 

computer has a 2.88MB floppy, select Floppy Emulation (2.88MB) option
on the Bootable Disc Type drop-down list. If your computer has only
a CD or DVD disc drive, select Hard Disk Emulation option from this
drop-down list instead.
If you select either of the Floppy Disk Emulation options, you must insert
the disk in your computer’s floppy drive before you click OK in the Choose
Type of Bootable Disc dialog box. 
If you select the Hard Disk Emulation option but don’t want to use the
boot image file supplied by Roxio, click the Browse button to its imme-
diate right of the Using Existing Image radio button and then locate and
select the image file you want to use.
4. Click the OK button at the bottom of the Choose Type of Bootable Disc
dialog box to close it and have Creator Classic format your CD-ROM
and copy the bootable system files to it.
If you use one of the Floppy Disk Emulation options, an alert dialog box
appears prompting you to insert the disk in your computer’s A: drive.
Click OK to have Creator Classic continue with preparing the disc and 
copying the necessary files.
After preparing and copying the system files to your CD-ROM disc, Bootable
Disc Project – Untitled appears at the top of the Project pane and you can
then use Creator Classic to add any additional files that you want burned
onto the disc (for example, you might want to add hard disk utilities, applica-
tion installers, or other backup utilities to the disc in addition to the boot
image files).
If you want to access information on your computer from your bootable disc
(beyond just starting up the system), be sure to add these files to your Bootable
Disc Project. These include the following:
 mscdex.exe
 cdrom.sys
 Device drivers for your computer’s CD and/or DVD drives
After burning the files you add to your Bootable Disc Project (see “Saving the
disc project and burning the disc” that immediately follows for details, you
need to test out your bootable CD-ROM. To do this, restart your computer
while the CD-ROM is still in your CD or DVD drive (by clicking the Start
button on the Windows taskbar, the Turn Off Computer item on the Start
menu, and the Restart button in the Turn Off Computer dialog box). If your
computer starts from the CD-ROM rather than from your computer’s hard
disk, your bootable CD-ROM has all the information it needs to start your
system in case of any hard disk problems. Of course, this means that you
have now to remove the CD-ROM from your CD or DVD drive to resume
normal startup from the hard disk.
87
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

Saving the disc project
After you add all the files you want to your data, multimedia, or bootable disc
project, you can save it so that you can use it at a later time to burn additional
CD or DVD discs without having to go through all that creation rigmarole all
over again. To save the project you’re working on:
1. Choose File➪Save Project on the Creator Classic menu bar or press
Ctrl+S.
The Save As Project dialog box (looking very much like any other
Windows Save As dialog box) appears where you can select the drive
and folder in which to save the project and the filename under which
to save the project.
2. Indicate the drive and folder where you want to save the project with
the Save In combo box.
3. Replace Untitled in the File Name text box with the filename you want
to use (just don’t delete the .rcl filename extension).
4. Click the Save button to close the Save As dialog box and save your
project settings on your hard disk.
Note when you save the project, Creator Classic doesn’t actually save the files
in the project on your hard disk. This means that if you want to use the project
again a later time to burn a disc, the files in the project must be in the same
folders and disk locations as they were at the time you saved the project.
Burning the disc
To burn the CD or DVD by copying the files in your project, all you have to do
is to put a blank CD or DVD in your computer’s recording drive (depending
on which type of media is designated in the Disc Size drop-down list box),
and then click the Burn button on the right side of the Disc Project pane tool-
bar. When you click this button, the Roxio Creator Classic – Burn Setup dialog
box appears, showing you the device that will be used in burning your disc.
If this is not the device that contains the blank CD or DVD and that you want
used in burning your data disc project to disc, you need to click the drop-down
button to the left of the current device name and select the correct drive.
Click the Save Disc Image File button and then use the Browse button to select
the location and filename for the file on your computer’s hard disk that is to
contain a complete copy of the disc project. You can then burn this disc image
file to a blank CD or DVD disc a later time using Creator Classic (keep in mind
88
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

that the data files added to the project are not saved as part of this disc image
file and therefore must be in the same folder and disk locations on your hard
drive as they were when you created the project).
If, however, you want to change any of the default burn settings (such as the
write speed or the number of copies), click the plus sign button to the imme-
diate left of the Burn Options to expand the Burn Setup dialog box to include
both General Options and Advanced Options (to display the list of Advanced
Options, you must click the plus sign button in from of the Advanced Options
heading). Figure 3-15 shows the Burn Setup dialog box with all the General
and Advanced Options displayed.
As you can see in Figure 3-15, the General Options in this expanded version of
the Roxio Creator Classic – Burn Setup dialog box enable you to select a new
write speed (if your CD or DVD media support this) and increase the number
of disc copies to be made and make the disc read-only so that no more data
files can be added even when the disc is rewritable and has free space.

In addition, you can select, deselect, or modify any of the following Advanced
Options:

Part II: Creating Data Discs 

After adjusting all the necessary options in the Burn Setup dialog box, click the
OK button to close it and begin recording your files. The Roxio Creator Classic –
Progress Information dialog box (similar to the one shown in Figure 3-16) then
appears. This dialog box is updated to a Disc 1 of x (where x is the total number
of discs required to copy all the files in your disc project). The Progress
Information dialog box also shows you the progress of the data recording
both in terms of the tracks and overall disc progress. It also contains a Create a
Label Creator button that you can click to launch the Label Creator application
for creating a custom label for your CD or DVD disc(s) after the recording is
completed (see Chapter 9 for details).
If you don’t want to make a label for your disc after the files are burned
onto it, simply click the Close button to close the Roxio Creator Classic –
Progress Information dialog box and return to the Creator Classic window.
If you’ve added more files to your disc project than can be burned on a
single CD or DVD, Creator Classic indicates the number of discs required
along with the total size of the project at the bottom of the Project pane.
When you burn the project, Creator Classic prompts to insert a new disc
in the destination drive after it finishes copying as many files as fit on the 
current disc. This continues until all the files are copied. Because Creator
Classic can split data in a single file across more than one disc, you need to
use the Roxio Retrieve utility in order to access files burned on such a multi-
disc project (see “Recovering Data with Roxio Retrieve” later in this chapter
for details). Just be sure to label the discs in a multi-disc project sequentially
(1, 2, 3, and so on) so that you identify each disc when using this tool to
recover their files.

Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

Adding files to an existing CD or DVD disc
Provided that a rewritable CD or DVD disc you’ve burned still has space free
for additional files and was not recorded with the Read-Only Disc option (see
“Saving the disc project and burning the disc” earlier in this chapter for details),
you can append files to the disc by taking the following steps:
1. Launch Creator Classic by clicking the Creator Classic link in the
Applications Project Window of the Easy Media Creator Home
window.
2. Put CD-ROM disc to which you want append additional files in your
computer’s CD or DVD drive.
Remember that in order to add files to this CD-ROM, it must have sufficient
free space and it must not have been originally burned as a Read-only disc.
3. Choose File➪New Project➪Data Disc, Multimedia Project, or
Bootable Disc.
Creator Classic starts a new project of the type you select.
4. Click the Import Data from an Appendable CD button on the Project
pane’s toolbar (the one the third from left of the Burn button with an
arrow pointing downward).
Creator Classic responds by importing the list of files on the CD or DVD
disc in your computer’s drive to which you can now add additional files.
5. Add the other folders and files on your hard disk that you want
recorded on the disc as you normally would (refer to “Adding data
files to a disc project” earlier in this chapter for details).
If you think you might ever reuse this new project, name the project by
replacing the numeric name in the Disc Name text box and then choose
File➪Save Project (Ctrl+S) on the Creator Classic menu bar.
6. Click the Burn button at the right of the Project pane’s toolbar; then
select the appropriate burn options in the Roxio Creator Classic – Burn
Setup dialog box (see “Saving the disc project and burning the disc”
earlier in this chapter) and click its OK button.
Note that you don’t have to burn the new data disc project to the same disc.
If you want to burn it to a new CD or DVD disc, replace the one from which
you imported most of the data with a blank disc before you click the Burn
button on the Disc Project pane’s toolbar.
92
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

Getting the Lowdown on a Disc
You can use the Disc and Device Utility to get all kinds of information about
the discs that you burn with Creator Classic or Drag to Disc. You can also use
this utility to erase and reformat discs so that you can reuse their media for
burning other data disc projects.
To launch this handy utility from Creator Classic window, click the Disc and
Device Utility link in the Other Tasks pane on the left. If Creator Classic isn’t
running at the time you want to use the Disc and Device Utility, you can get
the same type of information from within the Easy Media Creator Home
window itself by clicking the Disc Information link on the Tools tab of the
Project List pane.
Figure 3-17 shows Disc and Device Utility window opened from Creator Classic.
When you first open this dialog box, it shows you only condensed information
about the disc in your CD or DVD drive and the drive itself. To get more infor-
mation on the disc, including as detailed Session and Disc properties, click the
Expand button (the one with the plus sign) in front of the disc’s description.
To get detailed information about the drive, click its Expand button instead.
To erase or reformat the disc, click media’s icon in the Disc and Device Utility
dialog box and then click the Erase/Format button (this button may be grayed
out and unavailable until you click the disc’s icon). The Disc Erase/Format
Confirmation alert dialog box then appears giving you the opportunity to
choose between the Quick Erase/Format (selected by default) and the Full
Erase/Format option button.
Figure 3-17:

93
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

If you want to ensure that all the data on the disc is erased before the disc
is formatted, click the Full Erase/Format option button before you click the
Start button. If you’re not worried about a full erase and want to be able to
use the disc quickly, leave the default Quick Erase/Format option button
selected when you click the Start button.
Recovering Data with Roxio Retrieve
You can use the Roxio Retrieve utility to recover files from the data disc pro-
jects you burn onto multiple discs or to recover files on discs that you have
encrypted (see “Encrypting the data disc” earlier in this chapter). 
Unlike the data disc projects burned onto a single CD or DVD where all the files
are on that disc (and which you can readily access in any standard window
opened with the Windows File Explorer), the data in some of files in a multi-
disc project can actually be split across more than one physical disc. Because
of this, you must use the Roxio Retrieve tool in order to copy such files to your
computer’s hard disk or some other network disk to which you have access.
Don’t try to use the Windows Explorer to access files that are split across
discs in a multi-disc project. Doing so can render the files on the discs in the
set unusable. Therefore, always use the Roxio Retrieve tool to restore any of
the files from a multi-disc project to your computer’s hard disk.
To recover files from a multi-disc project with Roxio Retrieve, follow these
steps:
1. Put whatever disc of the multi-disc set into your computer’s CD or
DVD drive you think contains the files you want to restore.
Whenever you put in a disc from a multi-disc set, Roxio Retrieve shows
you all the folders and files on the disc set along with the number of the
disc on which they’re stored.
2. Launch the Roxio Retrieve utility by clicking the Retrieve link under
the Utilities column in the Applications Project Window of the Roxio
Media Creator Home window.
A Roxio Retrieve window similar to the one shown in Figure 3-18 then
opens. This window shows the name of the disc with its navigation tree
in the pane on the left and the names of all the folders and files at the
current level along with its source disc number in the pane on the right.
If the disc is encrypted, you will be prompted to enter the disc’s pass-
word. If the disc is part of a backup disc project (see “Creating a Backup
project” earlier in this chapter for details), the Roxio Retrieve window
94
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

shows the backup history in the Backup History list. You can then
choose the backup history you want to use (usually the most recent
one, unless you’re looking for an earlier version of a file before certain
editing changes were made).
3. Scroll up and down the navigation tree in the left pane and through
the folder and file list in the right pane until you locate the files you
want to copy to your hard disk.
To open a folder and displays its contents, click its icon in the navigation
tree to the left. To return to the previous level in the tree and display its
folders and files, click the Up One Level button on Roxio Retrieve window’s
toolbar. Note that Roxio Retrieve indicates the location of all folders and
files in the set by displaying the number of its disc in the set in the Source
Disc column. When a file is split across two discs, its Source Disc infor-
mation shows the numbers of both discs as is 1-2, to tell you that part of
the information is on the disc 1 and part is on disc 2.

4. Click the check box before the names of all the folders or files that
you want copied to your hard disk so that each of its boxes contains
a checkmark.
To copy all the files on the disc, click the check box in front of the disc’s
name in the pane on the left. Once you finish marking all the folders and
files to copy, you’re ready to start the copy procedure and indicate where
the folders and files are to be copied.
5. Click the Click to Copy Selected Files and Folders button on the Roxio
Retrieve window’s toolbar (the one the farthest to the right).
The Choose Destination dialog box shown in Figure 3-19 appears. By
default, Roxio Retrieve selects the Alternate Destination option button
to save the selected files in the directory whose path is shown below.
You can accept this default directory, change it with the Browse button,
or have the files copied to their original directories by selecting the
Original Location(s) option button.
6. Indicate where you want the selected folders and files copied in the
Choose Destination dialog box and then click its Retrieve button.
As soon as you click the Retrieve button, Roxio Retrieve starts copying
the selected folders and files to your designated location on your com-
puter system. When copying a file that’s not on the disc currently in your
CD or DVD drive or one that’s split across discs, Roxio Retrieve auto-
matically ejects the current disc and prompts you to replace it with the
number of the disc that contains the files or part of the file in question.
When Roxio Retrieve finishes copying all of the files, the utility displays
a Roxio Retrieve alert dialog box indicating that the Retrieve process
has been successfully completed.

Use the
options in
this dialog
box to tell
Roxio

Part II: Creating Data Discs 

7. Click the OK button the Roxio Retrieve alert dialog box indicating the
completion of the copying operation to close it and then click the Close
button in the upper-right corner of the Roxio Retrieve window to close
this utility.
Note that you can re-sort the files displayed in the right pane of the Roxio
Retrieve window by clicking on their column heading. For example, to sort the
files by their Source Disc number in descending order (from highest to lowest),
click the Source Disc column heading once. To then re-sort the files by Source
Disc number in ascending order (lowest to highest), click the Source Disc
column heading a second time.
You can also use the Search for Files and Folders on the Disc Set button to
locate particular files on the disc set. Simply enter the complete name of the
file (including its filename extension) you want to find in the Named text box
and click the Search Now button in the Search for Files and Folders dialog box
that appears. Roxio Retrieve then expands the Search for Files and Folders
dialog box to show you the number of the disc that contains your file.
Creating a Backup Project
The Roxio Backup application enables you to create a special Data Disc pro-
ject called a Backup project. A Backup project differs from a regular Data Disc
project in that you get to specify not only what files are copied to disc but
how often. Backup projects are perfect for backing up files such as personnel
or financial data files that require routine and regular backups as you add to
and edit their contents during the course of business.
When creating a Backup project, you not only determine which files are backed
up, how they are backed up, and whether or not they are encrypted, but also
how often you should be prompted to use the Backup project to burn the
backup discs.
To start a new Backup project, you follow these steps:
1. In the Roxio Media Creator Home window, click the Applications link
on the Home tab of the Project List, and then click the Roxio Backup
link in the Applications Project Window.
The Roxio Backup window appears (see Figure 3-20). This window is
updated to show all the Backup projects you’ve created in the Backup
Projects pane on the right and listing the individual Backup Tasks at the
top of the Tasks pane on the left.
97
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

2. Click the Create New Project link at the top of the Backup Tasks pane.
The first Backup Options dialog box entitled What Files to Want To Back
Up opens (Figure 3-21) where you name the project and indicate what
folders or types of files to include in the backup. Note that indicating
which files to backup, you have a choice between selecting files by the
folders in which they reside or by the type of files.
3. Type a name for the new Backup project in the Project Name text box.
Note that you can’t later change the project name that you enter here.
4. To select individual folders to back up, leave the Select Folder(s) on
Your Computer option button selected. To select the files to back up
by their file type, click the Selected Files Based on File Types option
button instead.
When the Select Folder(s) on Your Folder option is selected, you select
the folders to back up by clicking the check box in front of their folder
names.
When the Selected Files Based on File Types option is selected, you
select the types of files to include in the backup by clicking the check
box in front of the category names (along with the filename extensions
included) listed in the File Categories list box. To add a category of your
own, click the Add button and then enter a new category name in the
Category Name text box and click the check boxes in front of the various
filename extensions and types in the Add Category list box before click-
ing the Save button.

5. Indicate what folders or file types to include in the Backup project.
After indicating what files to backup, you may want to designate which
files not to backup with the Exclude File Types button and display an
estimate of the size of the backup project using the files you’ve selected
by clicking the Check button.
6. Click the Next> button to display the second Backup Options dialog
box entitled Where Do You Want to Back Up the Files (Figure 3-22)
and indicate a disc or hard drive destination for the backup, whether
to do a full or incremental backup, and, when making the backup to
discs, whether or not to first erase a rewritable CD or DVD disc and to
allow files to be split across discs.
When selecting the options for where you back up the files, you have the
following choices:
• Click the Hard Drive option button under Destinations and then
click the Browse button and select the drive in the Select Backup
Directory dialog box and click OK to back up the files on a drive
rather than discs.

• To make monthly backups on a particular day of a monthly inter-
val (such as the second Saturday of every other month), select the
option button in front of the settings indicating the first Sunday of
every month as the interval and then adjust the ordinal of the day
(First, Second, Third, Fourth, or Last) in its drop-down list box,
the day of the week (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and so on) in its
drop-down list box, followed by the number of the monthly interval
(between 2 and 12) in its drop-down list box.
• To set a new backup start time, click the Start Backup At text box
and then enter a new start time by entering the number of the hour
and minutes, along the AM or PM designation or use the spinner
buttons to modify these values.
• To have Roxio Backup display a reminder sometime before the time
the backup is scheduled to begin (giving advance notice you can use
to save work you’re doing in another program, for example), select
the number of minutes (between 5 and 45) in the Show Reminder
drop-down list box.
8. (Optional) If you selected the Automatic Backup options button, make
any necessary changes to the settings for backup interval, backup
start time, and show reminder before backup starts.
9. Click the Next> button to open fourth Backup Options dialog box enti-
tled How Do You Want to Back Up the Files (see Figure 3-24) where
you indicate whether or not to compress and encrypt the files and to
have the program verify the source files before making the backup
and the destination after making it.
By default, Roxio Backup neither compresses nor encrypts the files.
To save disc space, click the Compression check box. To encrypt the
files, click the Enable File Encryption (128-bit) check box, and then
type a password in the Password text box and re-type it exactly in the
Re-enter Password text box.
Remember that if you encrypt the disc with a password, you must be able
to produce the password exactly as you assigned it or you have no access
to the disc and can just kiss the data goodbye.
Roxio Backup also automatically validates all the source files before
actually backing them up on disc (or to a new hard drive, if you’re using
that option). To forgo this step, click the Validate Source Files Before
Backing Up check box to remove its checkmark. If you want the program
to verify the files after making the backup, click the Verify Destination
After Backing Up check box.

Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

Creating a Data Disc Project
Instead of launching the Creator Classic application to make your disc backups,
you can create data discs right from within the Roxio Media Creator Home
using the new Data Disc project.
To create a data disc using this project, you follow these steps:
1. Click Data Disc on the Data tab of the Roxio Media Creator Home.
When you do this, a Data Disc Project Window similar to the one shown
in Figure 3-25 opens.
2. Insert a blank or appendable CD or DVD disc in your CD/DVD drive and
make sure that this drive is selected in the Destination Selection pane.
Remember that an appendable disc is one that is not write-protected and
one that, although it contains files, still has room for more. To display a
list of the files already copied onto an appendable disc, click the Load
Disc button to the immediate right of the Add Data button at the top of
the Data Disc Project window.
3. To change the name of the disc, click the Volume Label text in its drop
down list box and replace this with your own volume label.
Now you are ready to designate the data to include on the disc. You have
a choice between adding individual files and folders that you select, and
adding files of a particular type that Roxio selects:
• To select files, click the Add Data button and then click Add Files
on its pop-up menu to open the Add Files dialog box, and then
select the drive and folder containing the files you want to add in
the Look In drop down list box and select their filenames or icons
before clicking the Add Files button.
• To select folders, click the Add Data button and then click Add
Folders on its pop-up menu to open the Browse For Folder dialog
box where you select the name and icon of the folder to add in the
hierarchy showing all the components of your computer system.
• To have Roxio select files of a certain type, click the Quick Scan
button to open the Quick Scan pane (see Figure 3-25), and then
click the check box in front of all the types of data you want added.
To see what filename extensions are included in any of the various
categories, position the mouse pointer over the category name. 
• To change the source folder from My Documents, click the My
Documents drop-down button and then click Browse in the pop-up
menu. Roxio then opens a Browse For Folder dialog box where you
select the new folder to scan before clicking OK.
104
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

• To include only files that have changed since a certain date, click
the Changed Since check box and then click the drop-down arrow
that appears to the right of the text with the current date. Roxio
opens a mini calendar from which you can select the cut-off date
for the files of the type(s) you’ve selected.
After designating the file types, their source, and optionally their cut-off
dates, click the Scan button to have Roxio scanned the designated source
folder for all files meeting your criteria. These names of these files are
automatically added to Data Disc list.
4. Designate all the folders and files you want included in the Data Disc
project.
5. (Optional) To save the Data Disc project so that later on you can burn
other discs using its file list, click the Save button to open the Save As
dialog box and then select the folder and enter the filename for the
data disc project (just be sure not to delete the .roxio filename exten-
sion) before clicking the Save button.
6. Click red button marked Click Button to Continue in the Action panel
of the Control pane to begin burning your data disc.
As Roxio burns your new disc, Project Running with stats on the burning
appears in the Project Window and a progress bar appears in the Input
panel (which is now labeled Progress).
7. When the burn is completed and the last disc is ejected from your CD or
DVD drive, click the Label Disc button that now appears in the Project
Window to launch the Roxio Label Creator (see Chapter 8) or click the
Done button to return to the Data Disc Project Window.

Backing Up the Whole Kit and 
Kaboodle with Backup MyPC
Backup MyPC is a new utility in the Roxio Media Creator 8 suite that enables
you to backup your entire computer system either onto CD or DVD discs or
onto a removable drive you have connected to it. That way, should you ever
experience a hardware failure of your computer’s hard drive, you can easily
restore the programs and data files you had on it.
The Backup MyPC window (launched by clicking the Backup MyPC link in the
Applications Project Window in the Roxio Creator 8 Home window and shown
in Figure 3-26) contains the four options:
 Backup Wizard to backup all the files and folders on all the local drives
on your computer or just selected files, folders, and drives onto CD or
DVD discs or onto a removable drive
 Restore Wizard to restore files and folders on the local drives of your
computer from either from a set of CD or DVD discs or from a removable
drive
 Automatic Data Protection to set up a schedule for regular backups of
the files and folders on your computer
 Disaster Recovery Preparation to create a Disaster Recovery Set of
discs that you can use to restore your computer in the event of a crash
and hardware failure of your computer’s hard disk

Part II: Creating Data Discs 

If you’re using a laptop computer that you routinely take out into the field, I
highly recommend that you use the Disaster Recovery Preparation link in
Backup MyPC to create a Disaster Recovery Set for its hard disk. I know from
experience how easy it is for a laptop’s hard disk to fail and how long and
painful a process it is to re-install all of its software!
Disc Copies in a Jiffy
The Roxio Disc Copier enables you to make duplicates of any noncopy-
protected CD or DVD even if your computer system has only a single CD
or DVD drive. This nifty application is especially useful when you need to
make additional copies of CD or DVD discs that you burned either with
Drag to Disc or Creator Classic.
To make a disc copy with Disc Copier, you follow these easy steps:
1. Put the CD or DVD disc which you want copied in your computer’s CD
or DVD drive.
Now you’re ready to launch the Roxio Disc Copier application.
2. Click Applications on the Home tab of the Roxio Media Creator Home,
and then click the Disc Copier link in the Applications Project Window.
The Roxio Disc Copier alert dialog box then appears warning you that
unless you own the copyright or have the explicit permission of the
copyright holder to copy the disc, you may be violating the Copyright
law and be subject to legal penalties (such as fines and even perhaps
damages). As soon as you click the OK button to close this alert dialog
box, the Roxio Disc Copier window appears. This window is divided into
a Source pane on the left and a Destination pane on the right. 
3. Click the Advanced button to expand the Roxio Disc Copier window
to show information on the disc you want to copy and source and des-
tination drive.
An expanded version of Roxio Disc Copier window similar to the one
shown in Figure 3-27 then appears. This version shows the type of disc
to be copied as well as the recorder and write speed and enables you to
change these settings as well as to increase the number of copies to make.

CD-ROM and a DVD recorder), select the drive with the disc you want
to copy on the Drive drop-down list in the Source pane and the drive
that contains the blank disc to which the files are to be copied on the
Recorder drop-down list in the Destination pane.

5. Click Copy Now button to begin the disc copy operation.
The Roxio Disc Copier – Progress Information dialog box then appears,
keeping you apprised of the copy operation by displaying Finished and
Disc Progress sliders showing you the percentage completed and the
elapsed time.
If your computer has only one CD or DVD drive which acts both as the
source and destination, after copying all the disc files to a temporary
location on your hard disk, the Roxio Disc Copier automatically ejects the
disc you’re copying and displays a message that prompts you to replace
the ejected disc with a blank disc of the same media type. After you click
OK, Select Write Speed dialog box may appear, enabling you to select a
new write speed for the disc copy (to use the same write speed, simply
click the Continue Recording button in this dialog box). When Completed
appears under the progress bar that has now reached 100% in Roxio Disc
Copier – Progress Information dialog box, the program ejects the copied
disc and you can then either launch the Label Creator application to design
and print a label for the newly copied disc (see Chapter 9) or close the
Roxio Disc Copier application.

6. To create a label for the disc copy, click the Create a Label button.
To close the Roxio Disc Copier – Progress Information dialog box and
return to the Roxio Disc Copier window, click the Close button instead.
If you don’t choose to make a label for your new disc copy, you can then

the upper-right corner of the window.
Making and Burning Disc Image Files
The files that you add to the data disc projects you create in Roxio Creator
Classic or as Data Disc project in Roxio Media Creator Home can be converted
into a single file called a disc image. You can then use this single image file to
burn copies of all the data files on CDs or DVDs.
Roxio Easy Media Creator supports two types disc image file formats: the
Global-Image (with the file extension .gi) and the ISO Image (with the file
extension .iso) formats. Image files using the Global-Image format save the
contents of the data files along with additional information such as their folder
structure and their read and write properties. The ISO Image format, however,
is more universal than the Global-Image (despite the name) so that you would
want to use this format for your disc image file if you intend to create CD and
DVD discs from the file that will be used on computer systems that don’t run
the Roxio Easy Media Creator suite.
Using disc image files in 
Roxio Creator Classic
To create a disc image file from the data project that you’ve created in Creator
Classic, you click Save Disc Image File check box in the Roxio Creator Classic –
Burn Setup dialog box opened when you click the Burn the Project to Disc
button in the Data Disc Project pane. Doing this activates the Browse button,
which you may then click to specify the location, name, and type of disc image
file to create in the Save As dialog box before you click the Save button. Then,
when you return to the Roxio Creator Classic – Burn Setup dialog box, you
click the Cancel button to return to the Roxio Creator Classic window.
To burn a CD or DVD disc set from a disc image file in Roxio Creator Classic,
you click the Burn From Disc Image File link in the Other Tasks pane of its pro-
gram window. Then you select the disc image file in the Burn from Disc Image
File dialog box before clicking the Open button.
109
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

Using disc image files in Data Projects 
in Roxio Media Creator Home
To create a disc image file from a data project that you’ve created in the Roxio
Media Creator Home, you click the drop-down list button in the Input Panel
(with the heading, Destination Selection), and then click Browse on the drop-
down list to open the Select the Destination Drive or Folder dialog box. Here,
you specify the location, name, and type of disc image file to create before
you click the Save button.
When selecting the type of disc image file to create from the Save as Type
drop-down list box in the Select the Destination Drive or Folder dialog box,
be sure to select not only the desired format (Global-Image or ISO Image) but
also the type of disc (CD or DVD) that matches the kind of disc you intend to
use when you do burn the data project. Keep in mind that you cannot burn a
DVD disc from a CD image file just as you cannot burn a CD disc from a DVD
image file. Therefore, to create a disc image file using the Global-Image format
from which you intend to burn CDs, you select CD Global-Image (*.gi) on the
Save as Type drop-down list. To create an image file for CDs using the ISO Image
format, you select CD ISO Image (*.iso) instead. To create an image file using
the Global-Image format for burning on DVDs, you select DVD Global-Image
(*.gi). To create an image file for DVDs using the ISO Image format, you select
DVD ISO Image (*.iso) on the Save as Type drop-down list in its place.
To burn a CD or DVD disc set from a disc image file that you create in the
Roxio Media Creator Home window, click the Burn Image link on the Copy tab
of the Project List. Then click the Browse button that appears in the Burn to
Disc Project Window and select the image file in the Select Image dialog box
before you click the Add button. Finally, click the red button in the Action
panel of the Control pane entitled Click Button to Continue.
Using disc image files in Disc Copier
To create a disc image file from a CD or DVD in the Disc Copier application,
you select Disc Image in the Destination drop-down list box and then specify
the location, filename, and type of disc image file in the Save As dialog box
before clicking the Save button.
To burn copies of a CD or DVD disc set from a disc image file in Disc Copier,
you click the Source drop-down button and then click Browse for Disc Image/
DVD-Video Folder to open the Media Selector dialog box where you select the
disc image file to use before clicking OK.

Organizing Your Media Files
In This Chapter
 Finding your way around Media Manager
 Using Media Manager to browse for media files
 Creating albums for your media files
 Searching for media files on your computer system
 Sharing your media files online
 Backing up your media files by burning them to CDs or DVDs
M
edia Manager is the place to go when you need to organize or find 
the various types of media files used in the creation of the various 
projects you build with the Roxio Creator 8 Suite. These media files include
photos, video clips, audio files, music tracks as well as the actual Roxio pro-
ject files themselves.
This chapter gives you the lowdown on using Media Manager to keep tabs 
on the many types of files even when they’re saved on widely divergent loca-
tions on computer system. As you find out, you can use Media Manager both
to organize and quickly find and review all the different media files stored on
various drives and on media (including CDs and DVDs) throughout your com-
puter system.
This chapter also covers using Media Manager to make it possible to quickly
locate particular types of media files by enabling you to assign keywords to
them that you can then use in the searches you conduct for media files of a
particular kind (you can even create media file collections based on your
search results). Last but not least, you get vital information on using Media
Manager to make backup copies of all your media files by burning them to
CDs or DVDs (which then enables you to free up much needed space on 
your hard disk).

Making the Most of Media Manager
To launch Media Manager from the Roxio Creator 8 Home window, you click
the Organize link on the Organize tab of the Project List or you can click the
Media Manager link in the Applications Project Window after clicking the
Applications link on the Home tab.
Either way you go about it, when you launch Media Manager, a window very
similar to the one shown in Figure 4-1 opens. This window contains a Browse
area that is divided into two sections: a navigation pane on the left in which
you select a media view and a contents pane on the right in which all the
media files and folders for the currently selected view are displayed.
When you first open Media Manager, the All Photos view on the My Media tab
is selected, showing you all the graphics files that Media Manager has auto-
matically identified and classified according to their graphics file type and
any keywords that you’ve assigned.
To switch to any other of the other three views — My Albums, Folders, or 
My MediaSpace (UPnP) — you click their tab buttons at the top of the naviga-
tion pane.

Part II: Creating Data Discs 

Meandering through My Media
Roxio Creator 8 uses its new smart views feature to automatically catalog all
the media files on designated folders on your computer system into different
categories, including photos, videos, music, and Roxio Creator projects.
When you first select the My Media tab of the Media Manager navigation
pane, the All Photos category is selected. To display all the media files identi-
fied on your system, you click the All Media link at the top of the navigation
pane. This mega category includes every media file identified on your com-
puter system arranged alphabetically by name.
Most of the time, you will find it much easier to locate a particular media file
by selecting the appropriate media category by clicking its icon (All Photos,
All Videos, All Music, or All Projects) on the My Media tab than by perusing
the All Media category (which can contain literally thousands of entries).
In addition to these automatically maintained media categories, you can also
create your own smart views from the results from a media search that you
perform in Media Manager (see “Finding Wayward Media Files” later in this
chapter). These custom smart views are then added to the My Views cate-
gory near the bottom of the My Media navigation pane.
Each of the different categories listed on My Media enables you to filter their
files by selecting from a number of different criteria, such as the date they were
created, imported, last used, or backed up. In addition to date-related filtering
criteria, you can filter the files by ratings that have been assigned to the files
as well as media-specific criteria such as the genre, artist, and album in the
case of music files, video file types in the case of video files, and application-
specific projects in the case of media projects.
To filter the files in a media category, click the the expand button (the one
with a plus sign in front of its name) and then click the desired criteria. Some
criteria such as Date have their own expand button that, when clicked, display
their own filtering categories. Figure 4-2 shows the Media Manager window
after expanding the Date filter in the All Photos category and selecting the
Last Week filter. Also note in this figure that I have also expanded the 2005
filter to display the individual months that I added photos to my computer
system. So, for example, to display all the photos that I added in the merry,
merry month of May, all I have to do is click the May filter icon on the My
Media tab.
As soon as you select the type of media and filter the category as desired, the
contents pane of the Media Manager shows you thumbnails of all the media
files that meet your criteria. In the case of photos, the thumbnails show a
small version of the actual image. In the case of videos, the thumbnails show
either the first frame of the video. In the case of music and Roxio Media pro-
jects, the thumbnails show a generic audio and project file icon.
113
Chapter 4: Organizing Media Files with Media Manager

Drag the Thumbnail Slider (located on the Options bar at the top of the con-
tents pane) to the left to reduce the size of the media file thumbnails so that
as many files as possible can be displayed together in the Media Manager
window.
To get information on a particular media file that’s displayed in the contents
pane of the Media Manager window, position the mouse over its thumbnail or
file icon. A tooltip then appears at the mouse pointer giving you scads of
information about the selected media file.
If this info in this tooltip is not sufficient for you to identify a particular
photo, audio, or video file, you can preview it. Simply double-click its thumb-
nail or file icon in the contents pane or click the thumbnail or file icon and
then click the Preview Selected Item(s) button on the Option bar at the top.
When you preview a photo, Media Manager displays it in its own Preview
window (see Figure 4-3). This Preview window contains buttons that you can
use to do simple editing tasks such as cropping and rotating the image. If
these simple edits are not enough, you can open the photo in the PhotoSuite
8 application by clicking the Edit button.
When you preview an audio file, it opens in a Preview window that contains
standard playback controls along with an Edit button (just like the one identi-
fied in Figure 4-3). If you find that you need to edit the start or end points of
the audio file after playing it in this Preview window or that you need to add a
simple fade-in or fade-out effect to it, click the Edit button to open the audio
file in a Quick Sound Editor window.

If you try to edit an audio file for which you don’t have a license for editing
(usually because it’s a track that you didn’t purchase as a commercially pro-
duced CD or from an online music service), an error message dialog box
opens to inform you that you don’t have the editing rights for the music file
after clicking the Edit button. After you click the OK button to clear this
Message dialog box, the Quick Sound Editor window opens sans the song 
you wanted to edit.

When you preview a video file, the Media Manager plays the video in a sepa-
rate Preview window that contains a set of playback controls along with an
Extract Image, Set as Thumbnail, and Edit button. If you need to edit the con-
tents of the video file such as trimming the video by setting new start and
end points, you can open the video file up in a VideoWave 8 window by click-
ing this Edit button.
Ambling through My Albums
When you click the My Albums tab button (the one with the picture of tiny
blue album book with the Roxio icon on it) in the navigation pane of the
Media Manager window, the My Media pane changes to the My Albums (see
Figure 4-4). The My Albums pane enables you to browse the contents of all
the special media collections files (referred to as albums) on your computer
system (see “Creating Your Own Albums” later in this chapter for details on
creating collections), search for items within your collections and assign key-
words, comments, and sounds to media files in collection to make them
easier to search.

When you select the My Albums tab, the following buttons appear at the top:
 Create New Album to start a new album to which you can add media files
 Add to Album to add new media files to new and existing albums
 Rename Album to change the name of the album selected on the My
Albums tab
 Delete Selected Album to remove the album selected on the My Albums
tab (note that deleting an album does not affect the media files in any
way — they remain safe and sound in their respective folders after
removing any of the albums to which they have been assigned
Finding your way around your folders
The Folders navigation pane in the Media Manager window enables you to
explore your media files using the folders on your computer’s hard disk,
removable media in your computer’s CD and DVD drives, as well as the 
other drives on your network to which you have access. To display the media
contents of a particular drive or folder on your system, click the Expand
button (the one with the Plus sign) in front the Desktop, My Computer, My
Documents, or My Network Places system folder icons to display the drives
and folders they contain. Then, to display the contents of a drive or folder
contained within one of these system folders, click its drive or folder. Media
Manager responds by displaying all the folders and files on that drive or 
in that folder in the Contents pane on the right. You can continue in this
manner, expanding folders within folders to peruse their files and reacquaint
yourself with the folders on your drives and their hierarchical relationship.
Figure 4-5 shows you the Media Manager after I expanded the My Documents
system folder on my hard disk and then expanded the My Pictures folder and
selected the Crater Lake 6-05 folder. Media Manager responds by displaying
thumbnails of all the digital photos in this folder in the Contents pane. Note
that after you use the Folders navigation tree to descend several levels deep
within a particular drive or system folder, you can then ascend the tree,
jumping back one level at a time by clicking the Up One Level button until
you reach the very top of the tree (the Desktop in this case).
After you select a folder you want to explore in the navigation pane, you can
then use the following buttons at the top of Folders tab to manipulate the
folder as follows:
 Create a New Folder to create a new subfolder within the current folder
that you can name
 Rename Selected Folder to select the name of the currently selected
folder so that you can replace it with a new folder name
 Delete Selected Folder to delete the current folder and everything
within it (be careful with this button)
117
Chapter 4: Organizing Media Files with Media Manager

Keep in mind that you can use the options on the View As drop-down list to
change how media files are displayed in the contents pane 
Moseying through My MediaSpace
Media Manager enables you to view media files located other computers and
media devices connected to a home network provided that you have access
to these computers and that the devices support the recent Universal Plug
and Play technology (UPnP for short). To view these media files, you click the
MyMediaSpace (UPnP) tab at the top of the Media Manager’s navigation pane.
The first time you click the MyMediaSpace (UPnP) tab, the Enable My
MediaSpace (UPnP) Browsing dialog appears (although an alert dialog box
asking you if you want to unblock this program may come up first if your
system is on a network and protected by a firewall). In a nutshell, the rather
longwinded text of this dialog box is telling you that in order to browse digi-
tal content from other computers and devices on your home network, these
machines must have Universal Plug and Play technology enabled and, in the
case of computers, have authorized the sharing of this digital content.

In order to turn on UPnP sharing to share smart views or albums on your
computer with other computers on your network, you launch Media Manager
and then choose Tools➪Start Sharing with MediaSpace(UPnP) on the Media
Manager menu bar.
To manage the sharing, you choose Tool➪Manage My MediaSpace(UpnP) 
on the Media Manager menu bar. Doing this opens the Manage My Media-
Space(UPnP) dialog box that contains the following options for choosing the
devices with which you want to share your media files as well as the albums
you want to share:
 Start Sharing/Stop Sharing: Click this button to start or stop sharing
your media files with other devices on your home network.
 Disabled/Enabled: Click this button to turn on or off sharing with the
selected devices.
 All My Albums to All Enabled Devices: Click this button to share all
your albums with all enabled devices.
 Selected Collections to Selected Devices: Click this button to share only
certain albums with certain devices. When you click this button, you can
use the following buttons to manage which albums to share with what
devices:
• Add to add the Smart Views or albums to the list of Smart Views
and albums that are being shared
• Delete to remove a Smart View or album from the list of Smart
Views and albums that are being shared
• Devices with Access To to grant access to only the devices that
you select by clicking the check boxes in front of their names
After you select the albums to share in the Manage My MediaSpace(UPnP)
dialog box, you can then peruse their media by selecting their albums on My
MediaSpace(UPnP) tab just as you would select albums on your own com-
puter system on the My Albums tab. When you select an album on the My
MediaSpace(UPnP), Media Manager shows you thumbnails or file icons for 
all the digital media it contains in the contents pane on the right.
You’re being watched!
The first time you launch Media Manager, the program displays a dialog box
informing you that your default watched folders (My Documents and the
Desktop) are about to be scanned for the first and that this scanning proce-
dure may take a few minutes (see Figure 4-6). To have Media Manager pro-
ceed and scan the default folders for all of its media files, click the Close
button in this dialog box.
119
Chapter 4: Organizing Media Files with Media Manager

If you have other folders on your computer that contain media files that you
want to add to the watched folders list, follow these steps instead:
1. Click the Watched Folder Settings button in the Welcome to Media
Manager dialog box.
Media Manager opens the Watched Folder Settings dialog box (similar to
the one shown in Figure 4-7) where you specify which folders on your
computer system are to be watched. Note that you can also open this
dialog box anytime after this by choosing Tools➪Select Watched Folders
on the Media Manager menu bar.
In this dialog box, all Watched Folders (including all of its subfolders)
are indicated by green boxes that contain check marks. All folders
(including subfolders) that are not currently watched are indicated with
red boxes that contain Xs.
2. Click the red box in front of any drive or folder that you want added
to the Watch list.
As soon as you click the red box, it turns to green and the X becomes a
check mark, indicating that it is now added to the Watch list. Note that if
you add a drive to this list, all its folders and subfolders are automati-
cally added as well.
By default, the Show Folder Watching Icon in System check box is
selected meaning that a Folder Watching icon appears in the Systems
Tray on the right side of the Windows taskbar that you can click to 
open the Watched Folder Settings dialog box and change which folders
are watched.
3. (Optional) Click the Show Folder Watching Icon in System check box
to remove its check mark if you don’t want a Watched Folders icon
added to the System Tray on your taskbar.
By default, the Show Notifications check box is not selected. Select this
check box when you want notification message dialog boxes to appear

anytime you change the watched folder settings or some other change
that affects a watched folder takes place.
4. (Optional) Click the Show Notifications check box to be notified when
changes occur to folders on your Watched list.
By default, the Filter Small Files check box is selected so that all media
files added to the Smart Views in the folders on the Watched list are fil-
terable, regardless of how small they are. Click this dialog box if you
don’t want to include small files when filtering Smart Views by media.
5. (Optional) Click the Filter Small Files check box to remove it check
mark if you don’t want to have small files filtered.
6. Click the OK button to close the Watched Folder Settings dialog box
and return to the Media Manager.
When you click OK, Media Manager scans all the folders on your Watched list
for all the designated file types and adds them to the appropriate Smart View
on the My Media tab of the Media Manager.
Media files in folders on your Watched list will go missing if you rename,
delete, or move them to another folder using the Windows operating system
or some other Windows program. If you try to access a missing file in the
Media Manager, the Cannot Find Required Files dialog box appears. If the files
in question have been deleted, you must use the Skip button. If you have
moved them, you must use the Browse button and then locate their new fold-
ers. If you have renamed them, you must use the Locate File button and then
select the renamed file before you click Connect.

Instant movies, slideshows, and 
playlists thanks to QuickShow
You can use the QuickShow link on the Media Manager Task Bar to make a
selection of video clips into a quick-and-dirty movie, photo images into an
off-the-cuff slideshow, or audio files into a spur-of-the-moment track playlist.
All you have to do is open a Smart View, album, or folder that contains a
bunch of the same type of media files (video, graphic, or audio) and then
select their files in the contents pane in the order in which you want to them
to play in the impromptu show. Then click the QuickShow link on the Media
Manager Task Bar.
Media Manager then switches to full-screen mode and plays the media in the
selected files. This show screen contains toolbar with a simple playback con-
troller that initially appears in the center at the top of the screen and then
disappears (you can always make this toolbar visible simply by positioning
the mouse pointer somewhere in this area). You can click the Play/Pause
button in this toolbar (see Figure 4-8) to pause and then continue the show.
You can use the Next and Previous File buttons to advance to next or return
to the previous video, photo, or music track in the show.
When the slideshow is paused, you can click the QuickShow Settings button
to display a pop-up menu containing the following options:
 QuickShow Settings to open the QuickShow Setting dialog box where
you can change settings for photo slideshows including the slide dura-
tion, applying motion effects to the slides, and select background music
to play during the show
 Save As Slideshow Project to save your impromptu photo slideshow on
disk as a slideshow project that you can open and edit with the
VideoWave 8
 Edit in VideoWave to open the impromptu photo slideshow in
VideoWave 8 where you can further edit it by adding different transitions
and effects
 MyDVD Express to burn the impromptu photo slideshow to CD or DVD
disc using the MyDVD Express application
You can also change the settings for your impromptu photo slideshows
before you generate them by choosing Tools➪Options on the Media Manager
menu bar and then clicking the QuickShow tab in the Options dialog box.

Creating Your Own Albums
Media file collections known affectionately as albums are a key element in 
the struggle to organize and keep on top of the many media files of different
types that you use in the various projects you create with the Roxio Creator 8
suite. Albums enable you to associate different types of media that you might
want to use together in a particular project (such as a DVD movie as
described in Chapter 12).
The great thing about albums is that you don’t have to physically move or
copy all the media files you want to associate with one another into the same

folder. An album can keep track of all the different files regardless of where
they’re actually located on your computer system. This includes files saved
in folders on your hard disk, files saved in folders on a network drive to
which you have access, and files saved in folders on backup CD and DVD
discs (that you can actually initiate from Media Manager — see “Backing Up
Media Files on Disc” later in this chapter for details).
To create a new album, follow these steps:
1. Launch the Media Manager and then click the My Albums tab in the
navigation pane.
Media Manager displays the contents of the last selected album in the
contents pane of the Media Manager window.
2. Click the album icon in the album hierarchy under which you want
the new album to appear, then click the Create a New Album button at
the top of the My Albums tab.
Media Manager adds a New Album icon (which you need to rename) in
the album hierarchy in alphabetical order under the album that you orig-
inally selected, while at the same time displaying an empty album in the
contents pane on the right.
3. Replace New Album by typing your own album name and then press-
ing Enter.
4. Click the Add to Album button at the top of the My Albums tab.
The Add to Albums window opens where you open the folder that con-
tains the media files you want in the album collection and then select
them.
5. Select the folder in the folders’ hierarchy in the Folders pane of the
Add to Albums window that contains the media files you to add and
then select all the files to add from that folder in the contents pane
before you click the Add button.
When you click the Add button, Media Manager closes the Add to Album
window and then adds thumbnails and file icons for all the media files
you selected for adding.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until you have added all the media files you
want in the new album.
Figure 4-9 shows a new Halloween album that I added to the My Albums tab
in Media Manager. The photos for this album come from file folders saved on
networked rather local drives on my computer system.

Creating albums from searches
Although you can create new albums from scratch as outlined in the previous
section, you need to be aware that you can also create them by doing an
advanced search and then turning the search results into an album. All you
have to do is run an advanced search (see “Finding Wayward Media Files”
later in this chapter for details).
When the search is complete and you have the media files that you want in
the new album, you click the Save as New Album button at the top of the
Search Pane. Next, you enter a name for the new album in the Save As New
Album dialog box and select its location before clicking the Save button.
When the Save As New Album dialog box closes, the name of your new album
with all the searched for media files will appear on My Albums tab of the
Media Manager window.

Chapter 4: Organizing Media Files with Media Manager

Arranging the files in an album
Media Manager makes it easy to modify the order in which media files appear
in your albums. To re-sort the thumbnails in a selected album, click the Sort
By button near the end of the Option bar at the top of the My Albums tab,
then select among the options on its pop-up menu:
 Name to sort files alphabetically by filename
 Size to sort files by their file size
 Date Created to sort files by the date they were originally created
 Date Modified to sort files by the date they were last modified
 Type to sort files by their file type
 Rating to sort files by their ratings 
 Custom Sort to sort files using a custom order based on the other sort
settings you select
 Ascending to select an A to Z, smallest to largest, least recent to most
recent sort order
 Descending to select an Z to A, largest to smallest, most recent to least
recent sort order
 Show in Groups to group files by other selected sort categories such as
Type and Rating
Keep in mind that you can change the way individual media files are dis-
played in the contents pane of the Media Manager window as well as sort
them. To change the display from the default thumbnail view with filename
below, click the View As button (to the immediate right of the Sort By button)
and then select Thumbnails, Details, Information, or List on its pop-up menu.
Tag, You’re It!
The My Media and My Albums views of the Media Manager enable you to tag
their media files (see “Creating Your Own Albums” earlier in this chapter) so
that later you can more easily identify their contents or search for them. The
program supports three different types of tags:
 Keywords that enable you to find related groups of files when doing
searches in Media Manager (see “Finding Wayward Media Files” that
immediately follows)
126
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

 Comments that enable you to add text notes that describe the contents
of a media file (such as adding the location where a photo was taken and
the names of the people who are in it)
 Sounds that enable you to add audio notes that describe the contents of
a media file
To check a media file for tags, right-click its file icon and then click Properties
on its shortcut menu. Then click the Tags tab in the Properties dialog box.
This tab displays all the keywords, the text of any comments added to the
file, as well as the name of any sound file associated with the media file.
Adding keywords to your albums
To add keywords to the media files in an album in Media Manager, follow
these steps:
1. Click the My Albums button on the Media Manager toolbar.
The My Albums pane appears.
2. If necessary, expand My Albums in the navigation tree and then click
the name of the album with files you want to tag.
Now you need to select the media file to which you wish to assign the
same keyword.
3. Select the thumbnails and file icons for all the media files to which
you wish to assign the same keyword in the contents pane.
Media Manager opens the Assign and Manage Keywords portion of the
Collections pane with its own toolbar of three buttons (see Figure 4-8).
4. Click the Keywords button to open the Assign and Manage Keywords
options at the top of the contents pane.
Now you’re ready to select the keyword(s) to assign to the selected files.
5. Click the check boxes in front of all applicable keywords listed at the
top of the contents pane (see Figure 4-10).
If none of the currently listed keywords applies, you can create a new
keyword(s) to apply.
6. (Optional) Click the Add New Keyword button and then type in the
keyword in the blank box and press Enter.
If you add a new keyword in Step 6, then you still need to take the next
step to apply it to the selected files.
127
Chapter 4: Organizing Media Files with Media Manager

7. (Optional) Click the check box in front of the new keyword you just
added to apply it to the files selected in the contents pane.
8. When you finish assigning keywords to the media files in your various
albums, click the Keywords button again to hide the Assign and
Manage Keywords options at the top of the contents pane.
To remove a keyword that you’ve applied to a file, all you have to do is to
click the Keywords button to display the Assign and Manage Keyword
options and then click the keyword’s check box to remove its check mark.
Adding comments to your albums
In addition to or instead of keywords, you can add explanatory comments to
a media file that help you identify its contents. To add a comment to a media
file, make its album active in the My Albums navigation pane and then select
its thumbnail or file icon in the contents pane. Next, click the Comments
button on the Option bar at the top of the contents pane.

Part II: Creating Data Discs 

Doing this opens the View and Edit Comments portion at the top of the con-
tents pane. Click the list box area that contains the text “Type a comment for
the selected file” and then type the text of your comment.
To add a comment to another media file in the same album, click its thumb-
nail or file icon and repeat this process of replacing the “Type a comment for
the selected file” in the View and Edit Comments list box with your own text.
When you are finished adding comments to the media files in your album,
close the View and Edit Comments list box either by clicking it Close button
or by clicking the Comments button on the Options bar again.
Adding sound tags to your albums
In place of a written comment, you can add a sound tag to a particular media
file that explains something about the file’s contents or how the file should be
edited or used in any of the other projects you create with the Roxio Media
Creator 8 suite. The process for assigning a sound tag is very similar to that
for assigning a comment except that instead of clicking the Comments button
on the Options bar, you click the Sounds button to its immediate right.
When you click the Sounds button, the Associated Sounds controls appears
at the top of the contents pane. These controls include a Select a File to Play
or Associate a Sound drop-down list box (where you can select audio files
with sound notes that you’ve already recorded for other media files) along
with a Play, Select, and Record button. 
To select an audio file that is not already listed on the Select a File to Play or
Associate a Sound drop-down list, click the Select button and then select the
audio file in the Open File dialog box before you click the Open button.
To record a new sound note, click the Record button to open the Roxio Media
Import window where you can select audio recording device and then record
and save your audio message (see Chapter 10 for details on recording sound
with the MediaImport application). After you finish recording you’re audio
message you can listen to it by clicking the Play button attached to its sound
file icon.
When you are satisfied with the note, click the Done button at the bottom of
the Roxio Media Import window to return to Media Manager. Then click the
Select button and select the newly recorded audio file in the Open File dialog
box before you click the Open button. A speaker icon then appears in the
lower-right corner of the media file’s thumbnail or file icon, indicating that
you have attached an audio file to it.
129
Chapter 4: Organizing Media Files with Media Manager

To listen to the sound note that you’ve assigned to a media file, select the
thumbnail or file icon when the Associated Sounds controls are displayed
and then click the Play button. To close the Associated Sounds controls, click
the Sounds button on the Options bar at the top of the contents pane.
To remove a sound note from a selected media file, click the Select Sound
drop-down button when the Associated Sounds controls are displayed at the
top of the contents pane and then click the None item at the top of this box’s
pop-up menu.
Finding Wayward Media Files
Media Manager enables you to find just the media files you want to work with
by searching all the Smart Views or albums on your computer system. When
searching for media files, you can do the search on the name of the file as
well as on keywords that you’ve assigned to the files and even the text of
comments that you assigned to them (see “Tag, You’re It!” earlier in this chap-
ter for details on assigning keywords and comments to your media files).
Media Manager supports two kinds of media searches:
 Simple search in which you just enter search text and Media Manager
then searches for it in all media filenames, keywords, and comments in
all the media files scanned on your computer system (see “You’re being
watched!” earlier in this chapter)
 Advanced search in which you specify all types of search criteria
including where to search on your computer system, the types of media
files to search for, the dates when they were last modified, their file size,
keywords assigned to them, as well as special properties unique to par-
ticular types of media file
Doing a simple search
To conduct a simple search, you follow these simple steps:
1. Click the Search text box in the Options bar at the top of the contents
pane.
2. Type the text to search for in the names of your albums or filenames
they contain and in the keywords and comments you’ve assigned to
these files in the Search text box.
The search text that you enter can be just part of an album name (such
as vacation to find both the album called Europe vacation and Last
summer’s vacation) or media filename.
3. Click the Start Searching button or press Enter to initiate the search.
130
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

Media Manager then displays all the icons for the collections and thumbnails
for the media files that contain the search text either in their album name or
filename or in their keywords or comments. These matching albums, thumb-
nails, and file icons appear in the Search Pane under the Options bar.
Doing an advanced search
To perform an advanced search, you click the More button (to the immediate
right of the Search text box) on the Options bar at the top of the contents
pane when the My Media or My Albums are selected in the Media Manager.
Clicking the More button opens the Advanced Search dialog box shown in
Figure 4-11 where you can specify all the criteria to use in the search:
1. Enter the file or album name to search for in the Enter All or part of
the File or Album Name Text box.
You can then narrow the search by selecting which types of media files
to include in the search.
2. (Optional) Click the check boxes in front of the types of media files
that you do not want included in the search in the Search For section
to remove their check marks.
You can even further narrow the search by selecting what albums to
include in the search.
3. (Optional) Click the Look In drop-down button and click the name of
the album to include in the search on the Look In drop-down list box.
To search all the albums on your computer, click My Albums in Look In
drop-down list and be sure that the Search All Sub-Albums check box
remained checked. To search all media files in the Watched list that
Media Manager scans on your computer system, click All Media instead.
4. Specify any additional search criteria on the General, Keywords,
and/or Special Properties tabs.
The search options on the General tab enable you to search for files con-
taining specific comment text, search for files that have created or modi-
fied within a certain time period, or are of a certain file size.
The search options on the Keywords tab enable you to select the check
boxes for all the keywords you want included in the search.
The search options on the Special Properties tab enable you to search
criteria specific to particular types of media files, including Photos Files,
Audio Files, Video Files, PhotoSuite Projects, and MyDVD 8 Projects. To
specify media-specific criteria, click one of these file types to expand its
criteria options, and then select the check boxes for the type of criteria
to use and the associated drop-down list boxes to specify the range of
values to apply for that criterion.
131
Chapter 4: Organizing Media Files with Media Manager

5. Click the Search button to conduct the advanced search using all your
search criteria.
As with the Simple Search, Media Manager displays all the albums and media
files that match your search criteria in the Search Pane on the right side of
the Media Manager window.
If you want to make all the albums and media files displayed in the Search
Pane into its own album, click the Save as New Album button at the top of the
Search Pane, then give a new name for the album in the Save as New Album
dialog box and select its location in the album hierarchy before clicking the
Save button.
Printing Your Photos
The best thing about Smart Views and albums is that they enable you to
easily print all or some of your photos. To print the contents of a Smart View
or album containing photos, you have only to select its icon in the My Media
or My Albums tab, and then select the thumbnails of the photos you want
printed in the contents pane, before you click the Print button on the Media
Manager Task Bar.
When you click the Print button, the Print dialog box (similar to the one
shown in Figure 4-12) appears. There you select all the necessary print

settings including the printer to use, orientation of the photos, how many
photos to print on each page, which pages to print, and the number of copies
to print before sending the job to the printer by clicking the Print button.
Sharing Photos Online
The Media Manager gives you two ways to share your photos online with
friends and family. The first way is to simply e-mail them. To do this, select the
photos in their Smart Views and albums before you click the E-mail button on
the Media Manager Task Bar. Doing this opens the E-mail Assistant dialog box
where you select which e-mail client to use (Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo!, and so
forth), whether or not to convert the photo files to JPEG, and, if so, what size
to make them — Small (640), Medium (800), Large (1024), or Original Size.
After selecting the e-mail options and clicking OK, Media Manager opens the
e-mail program you selected with a new message with all the photos embed-
ded in the text area of the message. There, you use the e-mail client’s options
to specify the recipients of the message, along with its subject, and message
text you want to add to the photos before sending the message.
The second way to share photos online is with Roxio’s LiveShare feature.
This new feature enables you to share the photos saved in the Smart Views
and albums in the Media Manager by saving them in an ad hoc Web page
which the people you invite by e-mail can then visit anytime your computer
is running and connected to the Internet.

133
Chapter 4: Organizing Media Files with Media Manager

Once at this impromptu Web page, the visitors you’ve invited can print the
photos you save there as well as download them to their own computers.
To add photos to a new LiveShare Web page, first select their thumbnails in
the Media Manager window, next click the Sharing button on the Task Bar,
and finally click the Share Now Using LiveShare item on the Sharing pop-up
menu. Media Manager then opens a Create LiveShare dialog box where you
specify the name of the Web page in the LiveShare Name text box before you
click the Share Now button.
Media Manager then opens a new e-mail message. This message contains
stock text that invites your recipients to view your photos online. This mes-
sage text also contains a hyperlink that, when clicked, takes your e-mail mes-
sage recipients directly to the LiveShare page containing your photos. All you
have to do is specify the e-mail addresses of all the people who you’d like to
view your photos and specify a subject for the message before sending it as
you would any other message.
To manage a LiveShare page from within the Media Manager, you choose
Tools➪Manage My LiveShares on its menu bar. Doing this opens the Manage
My LiveShares dialog box. The controls in this dialog box enable you to add a
new album to a LiveShare Web page, remove some of its content, as well as to
rename, and ultimately to delete it.
Click the Preview button in this dialog box to open your LiveShare Web page
with your computer’s own Web browser so that you can see the photos that
are available online. You can also click the Invite button to open a new e-mail
message with links to the Web page so that you can invite more people to
come and see your photos.
Backing Up Media Files on Disc
The Media Manager makes it really easy to back up the media files in your
albums on CD or DVD disc. All you have to do is select the media files in that
album in the Media Manager window and then click the Burn button on the
window’s Task Bar.
The Media Manager then responds by launching the Creator Classic applica-
tion and opening a new data disc project in this program that contains all of
the media files in the selected album. Then all you have to do is name the
volume, select the type of disc to use, and click the Burn button in the Creator
Classic window to go ahead and burn all the media files to disc (see Chapter 3
for details on building data projects in Creator Classic and burn them to disc).

In this part . . .
U
ndoubtedly, the digital audio and digital photos that
Part III deals with represent some of the most fun
media to work with (who doesn’t love a good tune and the
memories that photos of our favorite activities engender?).
This part begins with Chapter 5, which covers the mixing
of digital audio clips, from live recordings as well as tracks
on audio CDs and DVDs you own in Sound Editor. Chapter 6
is the place to go for information on acquiring, editing, and
using your digital photos. Part III concludes with Chapter 7,
which gives you the ins and outs of compiling and burning
Audio CDs, MP3/WMA Discs, and DVD MusicDiscs, and
Chapter 8, which covers Roxio Label Creator that makes it
as easy as can be to design and print disc labels and case
inserts for all your CDs and DVDs.

Chapter 5
Editing Audio with Sound Editor
In This Chapter
 Getting familiar with Sound Editor’s interface
 Adding audio clips to your Sound Editor project
 Recording audio clips for your Sound Editor project
 Importing tracks from an audio CD or DVD for your Sound Editor project
 Applying special audio effects to an audio mix
 Exporting an audio clip or mix as a separate sound file
A
s you find out in this chapter, Sound Editor is the place to go when you
need to preview, edit, or enhance audio files (assuming that they’re non-
licensed files which are not copy-protected) that you want to use in various
projects you create with Roxio Creator 8. 
Sound Editor in the Roxio Creator 8 suite is essentially an audio mixer that
enables you to arrange audio clips from a variety of sources into your own
audio mix. This program then lets you save your mix in a variety of different
audio formats and compression settings. Because Sound Editor can open audio
files saved in any of these formats and then save them back out in any of these
formats, you can also use the Sound Editor to convert audio tracks that you
receive saved in one audio format into another more compressed or manage-
able format for use in your other Roxio projects. You can also use Sound Editor
to burn the edited audio clips in the final mix to standard audio CDs or MP3
discs or use them in audio projects you create with Audio CD, Jukebox Disc,
and DVD Music Disc, all available on the Audio tab of the Project List in Roxio
Creator 8 Home (see Chapter 7 for details).
Adding Clips to Your Audio Mix
You launch Sound Editor from the Roxio Creator 8 Home window by clicking
the Sound Editor link in the Applications Project Window (opened by clicking
the Applications link on the Home tab of the Project List).

An empty Sound Editor window then opens where you can record new audio file
clips, import tracks from a CD or DVD as clips, or add existing audio files already
saved to disk as clips for the new sound project. This window is divided into the
following panes: Add to Project, Export, Project View, Clip Editor, and Mix Editor.
To open existing audio files as clips for a new audio project, you click the Add
Audio File link in the Add to Project pane. Then locate the audio file to add to
the Sound Editor project in the Media Selector dialog box and click the OK
button.
When you add an audio clip to the sound project, Sound Editor represents its
sound visually as a waveform in the Clip Editor pane (as shown in Figure 5-1).
This waveform shows the relative amplitude of the sound (that’s volume to
you and me) with its different spikes, peaks, valleys, and dips over time.
These left- and right-channel dB scales measure the voltage gain of the ampli-
fier against the strength of its original signal (indicated by the baseline that
runs through the middle of each scale). When the audio file’s waveform rises
above this baseline, the scales measure how much stronger the audio signal
is than the original carrier signal. When the waveform dips below this baseline,
the scales measure how much weaker the audio signal is when compared to
the original carrier signal.

Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

In the lower-right corner of the Sound Editor window, peak meters appear for
both the left and right channels (marked L and R). These meters indicate how
close the recording level comes to the zero dB clipping point where the sound
literally goes off the chart (indicated by the gray squares on the right side of
the meters). Volumes in the safe zone are indicated by blue bars to the left of
these squares and sounds that actually approach this point where sounds are
clipped are indicated in yellow, with red bars indicating clipped sounds that
actually exceed these squares.
The Mix Editor pane immediately below the Clip Editor shows all the layers in
your sound project. When you start a new project in Sound Editor, it contains
only a single layer (identified as Layer 1) onto which all your audio clips go in
succession. If you need to, you can add up to eight additional layers (labeled
Layer 2 through Layer 8) in the Mix Editor onto which you can add audio
clips. You can then overlap sections of the individual layers for the final
audio mix.
At the very bottom of the Sound Editor window beneath the Project View and
Mix Editor panes, you find a mute button, volume control along with standard
playback controls.
Recording your own audio clips
You can record your own clips for your Sound Editor projects. You can make
these recordings using a microphone connected to your computer or some
other device such as cassette or record player that connects to the sound
input (microphone) port on your computer. You can also record audio clips
directly from your computer’s sound card, so that, for example, you could
record the music or sound effects that are playing with another computer
program such as the Windows Media Player.

Chapter 5: Recording and Editing Audio

To record audio clips from the Sound Editor, you follow these steps:
1. In the Sound Editor window, click the insertion point at the place in
the waveform in the Clip Editor pane where you want the clip you’re
about to record to be inserted. If you want to lay the new recording
down over an existing audio clip, click that clip’s waveform in the Mix
Editor pane to select its layer as well.
If the audio you’re about to record is the first clip in the sound project,
you can disregard Step 1. If your project contains clips and you want the
new recorded audio appended to the end of them, click the insertion
point at the end of the last clip’s waveform in the Clip Editor. 
If you want Sound Recorder to play back an existing audio clip as you
record your new audio (presumably using your computer’s microphone),
click the insertion point at the place in the clip where you want the
recording to start in the Clip Editor, and then click its waveform in the
Mix Editor before proceeding on to Step 2. Note that this technique is
useful when you want to record a narrative voiceover on top of a back-
ground track that you then add to a slideshow or video production.
2. Click the Record Audio link in the Add to Project pane of the Sound
Editor window.
The Sound Editor opens a Record Audio dialog box similar to the one
shown in Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3:
The Record
Audio dialog
box lets you

Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

3. If the name of your sound card does not appear in the Capture From
combo box, click its drop-down button and then click the name of
your sound card on the drop-down menu.
4. Click Input drop-down button and then click the name of your com-
puter’s recording source on the drop-down menu.
For example, if you’re recording through a microphone connected to
your computer’s sound input, click Microphone on this drop-down menu.
If you’re recording through your computer’s sound card, click Stereo Mix
on this menu. If you’re recording through a line connected to an analog
device such as a cassette recorder, click the option on this submenu
that mentions Line or Line In (the actual items on this submenu vary
according to the sound card your system uses).
5. Click the Capture Settings drop-down button and then select the audio
file format to use in making the recording on the drop-down menu and
then click the Edit button to open the Capture Settings dialog box where
you change any necessary settings before clicking OK.
By default, the Sound Editor selects the WAV audio file format for captur-
ing the new clip. While this format gives you top-notch audio quality, it
also takes a lot of disc space as it is not compressed. To save disk space,
select one of the other capture options on the drop-down list: MP3 (Good
Quality) at 192 Kbps, MP3 (Low Quality) at 96 Kbps, WMA (Good Quality)
at 128 Kbps, WMA (Low Quality) at 64 Kbps, or Custom to define your own
format, encoder, and bit rate settings on the File Format tab and track
detection settings on the Track Detection tab of the Capture Settings
dialog box.
If you want to change the folder in which the Sound Editor saves the
temporary audio file after you finish recording it, click the button to the
immediate right of the Save To text box on the General tab of the Capture
Settings dialog box and then select a new folder in the Select Folder dialog
box (by default, the program saves all recordings in a Recorded Tracks
folder inside your My Music folder). While you’re at it, you can edit the
default Audio filename prefix given to all the files you record (as in Audio1,
Audio2, and so on) by clicking the File Name Prefix text box and then
entering your own prefix before clicking OK.
If you want to set a limit on the recording time, click the Limit Recording
To check box on the General tab and then enter the number of minutes
to set as a limit in its text box to the immediate right.
If you want to enable the auto pause feature whereby the recording auto-
matically pauses if a silence is detected (very useful if you don’t intend
to monitor the recording at all times), click the Auto Pause check box on
the General tab and then designate the number of seconds for the pause
in the Length of Silence text box. If the noise made contain some noise (as
with an older LP), click the Silence May Contain Noise check box as well.
141
Chapter 5: Recording and Editing Audio

6. To set the recording level manually, drag the Recording Level slider
to the desired position. If you want Sound Editor to automatically
adjust the recording level to avoid clipping, click the Auto button.
When setting the recording level manually, it is a good idea to play some
of the music track you intend to record or speak a few words in the micro-
phone to see what effect this has on the peak meters.
If the peak meters reach or go past the squares indicating the clipping
points, reduce the recording level by dragging the triangle in its slider to
the left and then test the audio level again.
7. If you are recording an existing music track as opposed to recording
live with a microphone, cue up the LP record or cassette to the point
at which you want to start recording in Sound Editor.
If you’re recording tracks on an LP, place the needle near or at the end of
the track previous to the one you want to record and then when the record
player reaches the silence in between the tracks, proceed to Step 8. If
you’re recording a track on cassette, cue up to the silence in between
the two tracks and immediately after you follow Step 8, press the Play
button on the cassette player.
8. (Optional) To record the new clip while an existing one plays in the
background, click the Play Mix While Recording check box.
Note that this check box only appears in the Record Audio dialog box if
you clicked the waveform in the Mix Editor before opening the dialog
box as indicated in Step 1.
9. Click the red Record button to start recording.
As Sound Editor begins to record your audio, the Time Recorded indica-
tor shows you the recording time in minutes and seconds and the Time
Left on Drive indicator the amount of recording time left on the disk where
the temporary recording is saved in hours and minutes. In addition, the
Play button changes to Pause and the Stop and Add Track Separator but-
tons become active.
If you need to pause the recording to switch the tape or turn over the LP,
click the Pause button (which then becomes Play again). To begin record-
ing again, you click the Play button again.
10. (Optional) To insert a track separator at the end of the audio clip
you’re recording, click the Add Track Separator button.
Take this step when you intend to record additional tracks before clos-
ing the Record Audio dialog box.
11. (Optional) If you enabled the Limit Recording To option and then
need to extend the recording time, click the Plus button (+) to the
right of the Time Left to Record indicator for each additional minute
you want to add.
142
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

12. Click the Stop button when you finish recording your audio clip and
then click the OK button in the Audio alert box.
The Audio alert dialog box that appears lets you know the name of the
temporary audio file you just recorded and its locations via its path name.
Now, you can record another audio clip by repeating the previous steps
or, if you’re finished recording clips, proceed to Step 13.
13. Click the Done button when you’re finished recording all the audio
clips you need with Record Audio.
The Record Audio dialog box closes and you return to the Sound Editor
window where the waveform of the recording you just made appears. 
If you selected an existing clip in the Mix Editor pane before recording the
audio clip, its waveform will appear on its own layer in the Mix Editor pane
beneath the one that was selected before you started recording the new clip.
Importing your clips from CDs and DVDs
You can easily import tracks from audio CDs and DVDs to use as audio clips
in your audio mix in Sound Editor. To do this, you follow these steps:
1. In the Sound Editor window, click the insertion point at the place in
the waveform in the Clip Editor pane where you want the imported
track to be inserted. If you want to lay this track down over an exist-
ing audio clip, be sure to click that clip’s waveform in the Mix Editor
pane to select its layer as well.
2. Insert the audio CD or DVD into your computer’s drive.
3. Click the Import From CD/DVD link in the Add to Project pane in the
Sound Editor window.
The Media Selector dialog box opens.
4. Select the icon for the drive containing the audio CD or DVD in the
Folders pane of the Media Selector dialog box.
The audio tracks on the selected CD or DVD then appear on the Track
List tab in the Media Selector. If you have access to the Internet and
you’re importing from a commercially produced CD, Sound Editor will
automatically contact the Gracenote only database and replace the track
numbers with the track names.
5. Select the track or tracks to import into your audio mix and then
click OK.

Chapter 5: Recording and Editing Audio

To listen to a track before importing it, click its track number or name
and then click the Play button on the playback controls at the bottom of
the Track View tab. To select more than one track for importing, hold
down the Ctrl key as you click the track numbers or names.
When you click OK, the Media Selector dialog box is replaced by the
Save Audio Tracks to File dialog box where you select the output set-
tings and the folder in which to save the track(s).
6. Make any necessary changes to the Output Settings and Save To option
in the Save Audio Tracks to File dialog box before you click the Save
button.
By default, the Sound Editor selects the uncompressed WAV audio file
format for capturing the new clip. To select a compressed audio file
format, select one of the other capture options on the drop-down list:
MP3 (Good Quality) at 192 Kbps, MP3 (Low Quality) at 96 Kbps, WMA
(Good Quality) at 128 Kbps, WMA (Low Quality) at 64 Kbps, or Custom
to define your own format, encoder, bit rate, and compression settings
on the File Format tab of the Output Settings dialog box.
If you want to change the folder in which the Sound Editor saves the
track, click the Browse button to the immediate right of the Save To text
box and then select a new folder in the Select Folder dialog box (by default,
the program saves all recordings in a Recorded Tracks folder inside your
My Music folder).

Recording clips with analog equipment
You can use the Record Audio link in the Sound
Editor to record audio clips from analog sources
such as LP records and audio cassettes or you
can record your clip using the LP and Tape
Assistant (opened by clicking the Convert LP/
Tapes link on the Audio tab of the Project List
pane of the Roxio Creator 8 Home).
In either case, before you start the recording, you
must first connect your analog audio equipment
to your computer’s sound input with the appro-
priate cables. Most of the time, this cable will
be a y-shaped cable with one red and one white
stereo-jack connector on one end that come
together in a single earphone- or microphone-
type connector on the other. You then connect
the red and white stereo-jack connectors to the
left and right-channel line out connections on
your analog audio equipment (tape deck, stereo
receiver, and so on). On most personal comput-
ers that aren’t equipped with a special analog-
to-digital converter (see Chapter 2), you then
connect the other connector to the microphone
connection on your personal computer so that
this acts as the sound input when recording
your LPs or cassette tapes with Sound Editor.
Note that when record audio clips from a record
player, you must take the line out of a stereo
receiver or some other type of amplifier to
which the record player is connected (if you
were to cable the record player directly to your
computer’s sound input, the audio would be too
weak for Sound Editor to record it).

As soon as you click the Save button, the Media Selector dialog box is
replaced by the Copying Track dialog box that keeps you informed of the
progress of the copy. As soon as the track copying is completed this dialog
box is replaced by an Audio alert dialog that displays the file name and loca-
tion (by path name) of the copied track(s). Click OK to close the alert dialog
box (or boxes) and to have the imported tracks loaded as clips in the Sound
Editor window.
Editing Your Audio Mix
After you have all the audio clips that you want in your mix, you are ready to
begin editing. The Sound Editor provides you with a number of nifty enhance-
ments that you can apply to the project, including fade ins and fade outs, filters
to clean up a less-than-perfect audio clip, and a whole bunch sound effects
that run the gamut from converting a stereo recording to mono all the way to
giving the singer a Munchkin-type voice or make you think the recording was
made in Westminster Abbey.
Keep in mind when editing your audio mix in either the Clip Editor or the Mix
Editor that you can temporarily maximize the editor you’re working in by col-
lapsing the other editor’s pane. For example, if you’re editing a clip in the Clip
Editor, you can enlarge its waveform by clicking the Collapse Mix Editor button
to minimize this pane (simply click the same button a second time to restore
the Mix Editor pane to normal). So too, if you’re working with clips on differ-
ent layers in the Mix Editor, you can enlarge and display all its layers in this
pane by clicking the Collapse Clip Editor button.
Zoom, zoom, zoom. . .
When editing your audio mix, you will often need to apply your editing to some
portion of a particular clip. You can use the zoom controls at the top of the
Clip Editor and Mix Editor panes in the Sound Editor window to zoom in and
out to find the exact place you want to edit in their waveforms:
 Zoom to Selection (Shift+1) to zoom in just the portion of the audio
waveform that you’ve selected in the Clip Editor or Mix Editor pane
 Zoom Out Full (Ctrl+1) to zoom out on so that the waveforms of all the
clips in the sound project are visible in the Clip Editor or Mix Editor
 Zoom In (+) to zoom in on the waveform so that you can see more detail
of the waveform over less time in the Clip Editor or Mix Editor
 Zoom Out (-) to zoom out on the waveform so that you can see less
detail but over more time in the Clip Editor or Mix Editor
145
Chapter 5: Recording and Editing Audio

As you click the Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons, the scale on the time track
in between the left and right channel waveforms in the Clip Editor and
beneath single waveform in the Mix Editor change to show the how much
of the recording’s waveform is currently displayed in the respective pane of
the Sound Editor window (this timescale shows the number of minutes and
seconds that have elapsed from the start of 0:00.0).
When you zoom all the way out on the audio file, the recording’s entire wave-
form is displayed in the Clip Editor or Mix Editor pane of the Sound Editor
window and the Zoom Out button becomes grayed out (indicating that it’s
temporarily unavailable). As you zoom in on the recording and not all of its
waveform is displayed in the Sound Editor window, the scroll bar that appears
at the bottom of each pane no longer extends the entire width of the window.
You can then drag this scroll bar to the left and right to bring different parts
of the recording’s waveform into view.
To zoom in on just a particular portion of the waveform, click the mouse pointer
at the starting place in the waveform and then drag through the waveform
until you’ve selected through the entire of portion of the waveform you want
to examine up close. Then click the Zoom to Selection button or press Shift+1
(that’s the number 1 and not function key F1) to display just the selected sec-
tion of the waveform in the Sound Editor window. To return to the previous
view of the waveform, click the Zoom Out button once. To deselect the wave-
form selection, click the mouse pointer anywhere in the waveform (a position
cursor indicated by a thin vertical line replaces the waveform selection at the
place you click).
You can use the plus (+) and minus (–) keys on your keyboard to zoom in and
out on a recording’s waveform. In fact, by pressing the plus key you can actu-
ally zoom out on the waveform many times more than by clicking the Zoom
Out button until only fractions of a second of the recording is displayed in
the Clip Editor of the Sound Editor window and the left and right channels of
the waveform appear as very spaced-out waves extending above and below
the dB scale’s baseline.
Playing with the playback controls
As you make editing changes to the audio clips in your mix (especially after
applying special effects to them), you will want to play them back to deter-
mine whether or not you want to keep the changes you made to them.
You can use the playback controls at the bottom of the Sound Editor win-
dow in conjunction with the Clips selector in the Project View pane to play
146
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

any of the clips in the audio mix. Simply make sure that the Clip Editor
pane is active (by clicking the Clip Editor title bar) before you click the
Clip number in the Project View pane and then click the Play button in the
playback controls.
When you click the Play button, Sound Editor begins to play back the selected
clip form its beginning. If you want to begin playback later in the clip, click the
Position indicator (the thin, blue vertical line that moves across the wave-
form from left to right as you play back the audio) at the desired place in its
waveform in the Clip Editor before you click Play. Sound Editor will then play
the clip from the selected position 
As soon as you click the Play button to start the audio playback, this button
changes to a Pause button, which you can then click to pause the playback.
To the immediate right of the Stop button, you find a Previous Marker/Track
button that you can click to move the Position indicator to the beginning of
the current clip for replay. You can click the Next Marker/Track button to
advance to the beginning of the next track in the recording (or to the very
end of audio file if it has only a single track).
Drag the Volume slider to control the volume (drag left to reduce the volume
and right to increase it). If you need to temporarily mute the volume altogether,
click the Mute/Unmute button to the immediate right of the Volume slider. The
first time you click this button, Sound Editor mutes the playback. The second
time you click this button, the program removes the muting, returning to the
original playback volume. Table 5-1 gives you a list of the most common key-
stroke shortcuts that you can use to control the playback of a recording in
Sound Editor. You can use any of these keystrokes instead of having to click
the controls at the bottom of the Sound Editor window.

Chapter 5: Recording and Editing Audio

Removing silences from a recording
One of the first edits you may want to make (after saving your new audio pro-
ject to disk — File➪Save Project) is to remove any leading or trailing silences
that you may have recorded in the clips you added. You will get a leading
silence if you have a delay between the time you cue up the analog audio,
click the Record button in the Record Audio dialog box, and actually start
playing the LP or cassette tape that you want to record. You will get a trailing
silence if you have a delay between the time the LP or tape finishes playing
and the time you click the Sound Editor’s Stop button to stop the recording.
To get rid of a recording’s leading or trailing silence, take these steps:
1. Select the silent area in the waveform in the Clip Editor by clicking
and dragging from its start to end.
Use the zoom controls in the top right corner of the Clip Editor pane to
enlarge the waveform (silences appear flat in the waveform).
2. To play back the selection marked for deletion to ensure that it does-
n’t contain any audio you want to retain, click the Play button in the
playback controls at the bottom of the Sound Editor.
3. Press the Delete key or choose Edit➪Delete on the Sound Editor
menu bar.
If you delete a leading or trailing silence only to suddenly realize that you
need to retain that silence in this recording (perhaps to act as a track break
when combining this recording with another audio track in one of your Easy
Media Creator projects), press Ctrl+Z to Undo your deletion of the silence and
put it back in your file before you do any more editing. Then click the mouse
pointer anywhere in the recording’s waveform to remove the selection. 
Inserting silences into a recording
Should you find that you need a silence in a recording, you can insert it by
following these two steps:
1. Select the place in the waveform in the Clip Editor where you want
the silence to be inserted and then drag to the right to indicate how
long a silence to insert.
2. Right-click the selected portion of the waveform and then click the
Insert Silence option on its shortcut menu.
The Insert Silence option on the waveform’s shortcut menu can come in real
handy after you’ve used the Insert Recorded Audio option to record a new
clip or the Add Audio File or Import From CD/DVD links in the Add to Project
pane to insert another track or recording into your current audio mix and
need a gap between the two to mark and separate the individual tracks.
148
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

Adding and deleting markers
The Sound Editor enables you to add markers to the audio clip you’re editing
so that you can quickly and easily find places in the audio that need editing
or are of a special interest. 
You can use markers to denote places in the timecode of audio clip to which
you want to be able to return quickly. To identify the place for the marker,
press lowercase letter P on the keyboard to turn on the display of the current
timecode as a tooltip at the mouse pointer’s position (note that pressing low-
ercase P again turns this tooltip off).
Use this timecode tooltip to locate the exact place in the audio where you want
a marker. When you locate the timecode in the waveform, click the mouse
pointer to position the cursor there before you press lowercase letter M.
Sound Editor inserts a marker indicated by a downward pointing triangle at
the top of the waveform.
After inserting markers in an audio clip, you can click the Next Marker/Track
button (or press Ctrl+→) and the Previous Marker/Track button (or press
Ctrl+←) to jump the cursor right to them in the waveform in the Clip Editor.
To remove a marker in an audio clip, go to it in the waveform and then press
lowercase M to remove it.
Adding and deleting track separators
If the audio clip that you recorded with the Record Audio option in the Sound
Editor had more than one track and you didn’t remember to use the Add Track
Separators button to insert them, you can use easy add them to the clip in
the Clip Editor pane by following these steps:
1. Select the clip in the Project View pane into which you need to insert
a track separator and then click the Clip Editor pane to make it active.
2. Use the Play/Pause button at the bottom of the Sound Editor window
to play back the clip until you reach the place in the audio where a
new track begins.
3. Click the Add a New Track Separator to Define a New Track button (the
first one with the plus sign on the Clip Editor pane’s toolbar) to insert
a track separator at the position in the waveform containing cursor.
The end of the first track and the beginning of the new track is shown by a
track separator indicator (two opposing triangles back to back) above the
waveform. The Sound Editor also precedes that track designation with the
next available number as in 2 Audio_3, indicating the second track in the
third audio clip or 2 Speed of Sound Coldplay, indicating the second track in
the Coldplay’s “Speed of Sound” single.
149
Chapter 5: Recording and Editing Audio

Note that you can have Sound Editor automatically locate the tracks in a par-
ticular clip and add all the necessary track separators provided that the tracks
in the clip have silences in between them. To do this, choose Tools➪Track
Detection on the Sound Editor menu bar or press Shift+Ctrl+D. This opens the
Track Detection dialog box where you specify the minimum length in seconds of
each silence that signals a new track, the maximum number of tracks to create,
and whether or not the silences to be used in locating the tracks contains
noises before you click OK.
After inserting a track separator in an audio clip, you can click the Next
Marker/Track button (or press Ctrl+→) to jump the cursor right to it in the
waveform in the Clip Editor. You can also click the Previous Marker/Track
button (or press Ctrl+←) to jump to the start of the first track.
To remove a track separator, all you have to do is select the new track cre-
ated when you inserted the separator (in other words, the one that follows)
in the Clip Editor by clicking the area that contains its track designation and
then click the Remove the Currently Selected Track button (the one with the
minus sign on the Clip Editor pane’s toolbar).
Splitting a clip at its track separator
Sometimes in addition to adding a track separator to an audio clip, you need
to split the clip as well. By splitting a clip at a track separator, you can move
the track to a new layer in the audio mix (see “Working with different layers”
later in this chapter).
To split a clip, you click the Split Clip button on the Clip Editor pane’s toolbar
and then drag the split bar to the place in the waveform where you want the
split to occur. 
After splitting an audio clip, you can then select the new smaller clips for
editing with the Edit➪Select Next Track or the Edit➪Select Previous Track
commands on the Sound Editor menu bar. You can also reposition any of
the new clips on their current layer or move onto another layer as you need
(see “Working with different layers” later in this chapter).
Joining two clips into one
If, after splitting a larger audio clip, you find that you no longer want the split,
you can join them the smaller clips made from the larger one back together.
Simply select the clips to be joined in the Mix Editor pane by holding down
Ctrl as you click their waveforms and then click the Join Clips button on the
Mix Editor pane’s toolbar.
The Sound Editor then joins the selected clips, leaving only a marker at the
spot where the split once was. You can then remove this marker if you want by
moving the cursor to it in the Clip Editor and then pressing lowercase letter M.
150
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

Adjusting the volume and balance
You can easily adjust the volume of part or all of an audio clip in your sound
project. Not only can you adjust the overall volume but you can add fade-in
or fade-out effects at the beginning and end of a clip so that sound builds in
and out over time. Of course, if you are working with clips on different layers
in the Mix Editor, you can create a cross-fade effect by fading out the audio in
a clip on one layer at the same time as you fade in the audio for an overlapping
clip on another layer.
The Clip Editor pane of the Sound Editor window shows any changes that
you make to the volume of the current clip in the line diagram in the Volume
indicator box located directly beneath the waveform representing the audio’s
Right channel. The current volume of the clip is represented by the straight
blue line in the middle of the Volume indicator box. Changes you make to the
volume in portions of the audio clip are indicated by drawing nodes (that
appear as tiny square) that divide the otherwise straight line into diagonal
segments that can extend above (indicating increases in the volume) or below
(indicating decreases in volume) 
The same principle holds true for the display of any balance adjustments you
make to portions of the audio clip in the Balance indicator box located imme-
diately beneath the Volume box. However, in this case, the straight green line
in the middle of diagram represents equal balance between the left and right
channels at 100% of their volume. Here, any decrease to the volume of the right
channel is represented by segments of the green line above this straight line
just as any decrease to the left channel is represented by segments extending
below it.
Please adjust that volume!
To adjust the volume of an entire audio clip, select the clip in the Project View
pane, and then double-click its waveform in the Clip Editor pane to select its
entire waveform before you click the Fading & Volume button on the Clip Editor
pane’s toolbar and then select from among these options on its pop-up menu:
 Fade In and Out to fade the audio at the beginning and out at the end of
the clip the number of seconds you specify in the Seconds text box in the
Fade In and Out dialog box
 Maximize Volume to increase the overall volume as much as possible
for the entire clip
To apply just a fade-in effect to the first part of an audio clip, go to the beginning
of the clip and then drag through the first part of the waveform, representing
the amount of time over which the fade-in is to take place before clicking the
Fading & Volume button and the Fade In option on its pop-up menu.
151
Chapter 5: Recording and Editing Audio

To apply just a fade-out effect to the last part of an audio clip, go to the end
of the clip and then drag through the last part of the waveform, representing
the amount of time over which the fade-out is to take place before clicking
the Fading & Volume button and the Fade Out option on its pop-up menu.
If you want to slowly increase or decrease the volume over just a portion of
the audio clip, drag through that part of the waveform where this volume
adjustment is to take place and then click the Fading & Volume button fol-
lowed by the Adjust Volume option on its pop-up menu. The Sound Editor
opens the Volume Fading dialog box (shown in Figure 5-4) that contains two
slider controls:
 Fade From to set the percentage above or below normal (100%) from
which the sound increase or decrease is to begin
 Fade To to set the percentage above or below normal (100%) at which
the sound increase or decrease is to end
To create a volume increase over the time represented by the selected portion
of the audio clip, you must set the Fade To percentage in the Volume Fading
dialog box so that it is higher than the Fade From percentage. Conversely, to
decrease the volume over in the selected audio, you must set the Fade From
percentage higher than that of the Fade From percentage.
To create a wave in an audio clip whereby the volume increases from normal
before reaching a new high and then returning back to normal, you need to
create back to back volume adjustment effects: the first effect creates a volume
increase by raising only the Fade To percentage in the Volume Fading dialog
box and the second effect, abutting the first, creates a volume decrease by
setting only the Fade From percentage the same as the Fade To percentage in
the first effect. To create a wave whereby the volume decreases to a low and
then builds back to normal, you two back to back volume adjustments with
just the opposite settings (change only Fade To below 100% in the first and
change only Fade From to the same percentage below 100% as the first).
Figure 5-4:

Fade From
and Fade To
controls to

152
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

Normalizing the volume over several audio clips
Sometimes you create a mix from clips recorded at vastly different volumes
and need to set a common volume for the entire sound project. To do this,
join all the audio clips in a single layer of the sound project and then select
their combined waveform in the Mix Editor. Click the Fading & Volume button
on the Clip Editor pane’s toolbar and select Normalize on its pop-up menu.
Sound Editor opens the Normalize dialog box with a level slider that you can
use to set how many times the current volume to normalize the selected clips
(between 1 and 10x). 
After setting a new level with this slider, click the Play/Stop button in the
Normalize dialog box to play back the mix at the new volume level to make
sure that it’s not too loud. When the level is just right, click OK to have Sound
Editor normalize the volume (and add a Normalize band to the Effects area of
the Clip Editor).
To reset the volume level after applying the Normalize effect or to remove it
entirely, right-click somewhere in the Normalize band in the Effects area and
then on its shortcut menu select Effects Properties to re-open the Normalize
dialog box or Delete to remove the normalization.
When it’s a matter of balance
By default, all recordings you make yourself and sound files you import into
your mix are given a left and right channel in the Clip Editor, regardless of
whether or not the clip’s recording is really recorded as two-channel stereo.
For those audio clips that really are stereo and do have a different left and
right channel, you can adjust the balance between the two by clicking the
Fading & Volume button and then selecting Adjust Balance on its pop-up
menu. Sound Editor opens the Balance Fading dialog box, which just like
its Volume Fading counterpart contains a Fade From and a Fade To slider. 
Both the Fade From and Fade To sliders in the Volume Fading dialog box are
set smack dab in the middle, indicating that both the left and right channels
are set at an equal 100% level. To decrease the percentage of the volume in
the right channel, you drag the slider button upward in either the Fade From
or the Fade To slider. To decrease the percentage of the volume in the left
channel, you drag the slider button downward in either of these two sliders.
When you drag a slider button upward, Sound Editor shows you the percent-
age of decrease in the right channel volume at the top of slider. Likewise, when
you drag a slider button downward, the program shows you the percentage
of decrease in the left channel volume at the top of the slider. To adjust the
left/right balance for a section of an audio (most usually at the beginning of
the clip), drag through its waveform in the Clip Editor before opening the
Balance Fading dialog box and using its controls. 
153
Chapter 5: Recording and Editing Audio

For example, to create the effect wherein all the sound comes from the right
channel when the clips starts playing and then gradually during the first
minute of play comes up in the left channel as it finally normalizes in both,
you drag through the timecode at beginning of the clip’s waveform in the Clip
Editor up ‘til 1:00:00, the time at which this balance effect is to end. Then, in
the Volume Fading dialog box, you drag the button in the Fade From slider 
all the way down (so that the left channel is set at L0%, essentially muted it
and the Fade To remains at 100%) before you click OK. 
When you click the Play button in the Sound Editor to listen to the effect
(preferably through stereo headphones), watch the peak meters as well as
the Clip Editor: when the audio starts playing only the Right meter registers
any activity and gradually the Left meter comes alive as the cursor moves
across the timecode in the waveform.
After you make balance adjustments in the Balance Fading dialog box, Sound
Editor displays the results using segments and nodes in the green line diagram
in the Balance indicator box (between Volume and Effects) in the Clip Editor.
Figure 5-5 shows you the Balance diagram after applying the effect whereby
the left channel is muted at the start of play and the sound normalizes in the
left and right channels during its first minute.
As you can see in this figure, this balance effect requires only two nodes with
a single diagonal segment between them. To remove this effect using this dia-
gram, you would have only to drag the first node up to until the line is once
again straight. To further modify this effect so that the sound goes entirely
from the right to left and then normalizes in both channels, you could insert
another node by right-clicking in the middle of the diagonal segment and then
Figure 5-5:

154
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

selecting Insert Node on the shortcut menu, effectively bisecting the original
diagonal line segment. Then you would drag the new node up to the top of
the Balance area so the segment on its left goes from the very bottom of the
box (no left channel) to the very top (no right channel) and the segment on
the right goes back down to meet the straight line in the middle of the box
(both channels at a hundred percent).
Keep in mind that you can remove any adjustment that you’ve made to the
volume or balance for the currently selected audio clip anytime you decide
you don’t want it. Simply, click the Fading & Volume button and then select
Reset Volume Envelope to reset the volume or Reset Balance Envelope to
reset the balance between the left and right channel.
Working with different layers
The Sound Editor in the Roxio Creator 8 suite is a true audio mixer in its 
support of multiple layers in its Mix Editor (you have up to eight maximum).
You can use layers (also referred to as audio tracks) in your mix to overlay
audio clips to great effect. 
For example, you can overlay the end of one audio clip in one layer with the
beginning of another clip in the next layer and then apply a fade-out effect to
end of the clip in the first layer and a fade-in to the one in the next layer, creat-
ing a cross-fade effect whereby as the music of the first clip fades, the music
of the second comes up. You can also use layers to add background music to
a narration, an audio effect which really enhances a slideshow or video movie
project with the narration providing the information about the visuals while
the music sets the proper mood.
Adding new layers
Each new project you launch in Sound Editor has a single layer named Layer 1
and all the audio files you bring into the sound project are added to this layer
(the only exception to this is when you record open the Record Audio dialog
box immediately after selecting the Mix Editor pane — see “Recording your
own audio clips” earlier in this chapter).
The easiest way to add a new layer to your project is by clicking the Add Layer
Below button (the one with the plus sign) in the toolbar area of an existing layer.
Sound Editor then inserts a new layer beneath the one whose Add Layer Below
button you clicked.
To add or record an audio file for a new layer, you need to remember to click
that layer to make it active (indicated by highlighting its name and toolbar)
155
Chapter 5: Recording and Editing Audio

before you select the Add Audio File, Import from CD/DVD, or Record Audio
options in the Add to Project pane.
Don’t forget that you can maximize the Mix Editor pane to display all the
layers you’re working with by clicking the Collapse Clip Editor button
(with the upward-pointing triangle) in the upper-right corner of the Clip
Editor title bar.
Manipulating layers
In addition to the Add Layer Below button, each layer you add to a sound
project has the following toolbar controls that you can use to control the
layers:
 Delete Layer button to remove the layer including all its audio clips and
effects applied to them
 Mute On/Off button to temporarily mute all audio clips added to the
selected layer when you play the mix (click this button a second time
to turn mute off in the current layer)
 Solo On/Off (Mute All Other Layers) button to temporarily mute the
audio clips in all layers except for the one currently selected when you
play the mix (click this button a second time to turn mute off in all the
other layers)
 Adjust Layer Weight slider and text box to adjust the relative volume of
all audio clips in the currently selected layer (adjust upward toward 100
for a higher relative volume and downward toward zero for a lower rela-
tive volume)
Use the Adjust Layer Weight controls in your respective layers to make one set
of clips more prominent than another. In the example overlaying a narrative
track on top of background music, you could set the relative weight of the
layer with the narration audio clip up to something like 75 and the layer with
background music clip down to something like 25 to ensure that narration is
clearly in the forefront and the background music stays in the background
where it belongs.
After adding clips to a particular layer you can arrange them by dragging
them to new positions on that layer. You can also use drag-and-drop to move
a clip to a new layer in your project. Note that when you try drop a clip on
top of a clip already on the layer that has a blank space in front of it, Sound
Editor inserts the clip you moved in front of the existing clip by moving it to
the right on the layer. If, however, you try to drop the clip you’re moving on an
existing clip where there is no blank space in front of it (it either abuts another
clip or the beginning of the layer), Sound Editor inserts the clip you’re moving

after the existing clip (even if it has to move a clip that otherwise abutted its
end before the move).
Figure 5-6 shows the Sound Editor window after collapsing the Clip Editor pane
and adding clips to three different layers. In this particular example, the audio
in Clip 1 in Layer 1 contains a piece of background music that starts playing
immediately, Clip 4 in Layer 2 contains a narrative track that then comes up
after a few seconds, and Clip 2 in Layer 3 (the one currently selected in this
figure) contains another piece of background music that comes up towards
the end of the narration and conclusion of the first piece.
Enhancing audio in the mix
Sound Editor supplies you with a multitude of different kinds of audio effects
that you can apply to the clips in your mix. These audio effects are arranged
on two different menus: audio clean up effects on the Clean Up Audio pop-up
menu and special audio effects on the Sound Effects pop-up menu.
To apply an audio clean up effect to the portion of the clip selected in the
Clip Editor (remember you can press Ctrl+A to quickly select a clip’s entire
waveform), click the Clean Up Audio button on its toolbar and then select
among these menu options:

 Clean to open the Clean dialog box where you can use its Declicker,
Decrackler, Denoiser, and Noise sliders to adjust the intensity of clicks,
crackling sounds, and both the threshold and intensity of hiss and rum-
bles (noise) in the clip
 Enhancer to open the Enhancer dialog box where you can use its Bass
or Excite option buttons and its Level slider to enhance either the bass
or make the audio brighter
 Equalizer to open the Equalizer dialog box with a 10-band equalizer
that enables you to boost or cut the amplitude (volume) for ten bands
of sound frequencies by dragging their respective frequency sliders
(note that this equalizer contains a Master slider that you can use to
adjust overall volume for the selected audio)
To apply special effects to the portion of the clip you’ve selected, click the
Sound Effects button on the Clip Editor pane’s toolbar and then select among
these menu options:
 Alienizer to add metallic and alien synthesized effects to your audio by
dragging the Alien 1 and Alien 2 sliders in the Alienizer dialog box
 Devoicer to remove a voice from the selected clip by adjusting its inten-
sity in the Devoicer dialog box (this effect is only effective on music with
one, prominent singing voice)
 Digital Hall to add different types of reverberation audio effects on the
selected audio: Box, Room, Church, or Space to simulate these various
environments as reverberation chambers (note that for any of the four
options you choose, you can adjust the amount of reverberation and
echo by adjusting the Reverb Time and Echo Level sliders) — click the
Play button in this dialog box to hear the result on the selected audio
of your Box, Room, Church, or Space Option button selection and any
adjustments you make to the Reverb Time and/or Echo Level sliders
before clicking OK to apply them
 Maturizer to adjust the quality of the selected audio (especially LPs
recorded from older “vintage” equipment) in the Maturizer dialog box
by adjusting the Intensity slider for any or all of five different check box
options: Noise (for tapes that have a lot of noise), Hum, Crackle, and Click
(for 33 rpm or 78 rpm LPs)
 Mono to Stereo to adjust the Intensity slider to simulate stereo in a
mono recording in Mono to Stereo dialog box
 Parametric Equalizer to open the Parametric Equalizer dialog box 
containing a 4-band equalizer that enables you to boost or cut the gain
(amplitude) and bandwidth (Q) for four bands of sound frequencies by
selecting their channel and then dragging their nodes in the line graph
158
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

to adjust their frequency, quality, and gain (note that this equalizer con-
tains a Master slider that you can use to adjust the overall gain for the
selected audio)
 Pitch to adjust the pitch of the selected audio without affecting the speed
in the Pitch dialog box by adjusting its Pitch slider (0 being the original
pitch of the audio clip)
 RoboVoice to add metallic and robotic synthesized effects (similar to
the Alienizer) to your audio in the RoboVoice dialog box by dragging
the Harmonize and Metallize sliders (note that you can also click the
Spread check box to increase the perceived separation of the left and
right channels of a stereo recording)
 Stereo Enhancer to open the Stereo Enhancer dialog box where you can
adjust its Intensity slider to increase or decrease the perceived separa-
tion between the left and right channels of stereo audio
As you add various effects to the audio clip displayed in the Clip Editor, Sound
Editor adds a band identifying the effect in the Effects area. To modify an effect,
right-click its band and then select Effect Properties on its shortcut menu to
open its dialog box showing the current settings. To remove an effect, click
the Delete option at the top of this shortcut menu instead.
Keep in mind that Sound Editor’s audio effects are cumulative, that is, they
are layered on top of the other. This means that you need to test each effect
as you apply it by listening to the result before applying another effect. That
way, if you find that you goofed up and really don’t like the audio effect you
just applied, you can remove it by choosing Edit➪Undo on the Sound Editor
menu bar or pressing Ctrl+Z (remember that you can also reapply an effect
that you remove with the Undo command by immediately choosing the Edit➪
Redo command or pressing Ctrl+Y).
Exporting a Sound Editor Project
When you save the audio mixes you create with Sound Editor as a sound editor
project (File➪Save Project), the program saves the audio mix in a special DMSE
(Digital Media Sound Editor) file format. This format includes references to all
the audio files add to the mix, information about all the effects that you applied
to its clips as well as information about these clips are organized into tracks
and layers.
The DMSE file, however, is not suitable for sharing with others or for using
outside of the Sound Editor program itself. Sound Editor does, however,
include several export options that enable you to save particular clips in 
project or even the entire audio mix in commonly used audio file formats. 
159
Chapter 5: Recording and Editing Audio

To export an audio clip, you select it in the Mix Editor and then click the
Export Current Clip link in the Export pane. To export the entire audio mix
with all its clips, you simply click the Export Mix link instead.
When you click Export Current Clip, Sound Editor opens an Export Current Clip
dialog box (similar to the one shown in Figure 5-7) where you specify the name
of the new audio file, where to save, and what file formatting settings to use.
When you click Export Mix, the program opens an Export Mix dialog box that
uses the very same layout and options as the Export Current Clip dialog box.
When specifying the Output Settings in Export Current Clip or Export Mix
dialog box you have a choice of the following audio formats:
 Custom to save the clip in a format of your own definition, including audio
file type, encoder, bit rate, and compression settings on the File Format
tab of the Output Settings dialog box opened by clicking the Edit button
 Wav (Recommended) to save the clip or mix as an uncompressed
Windows Audio File
 MP3 (Good Quality) to save the clip or mix as an MP3 file with a com-
pression rate of 192 Kbps

160
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

 MP3 (Low Quality) to save the clip or mix as an MP3 file with a compres-
sion rate of 96 Kbps
 WMA (Good Quality) to save the clip or mix as a Windows Media Audio
file with a compression rate of 128 Kbps
 WMA (Low Quality) to save the clip or mix as a Windows Media Audio
file with a compression rate of 64 Kbps
If you’re dealing with an audio mix in which you have several clips or tracks
created from clips that you want to save as standalone audio files, click the
Export Tracks/Clips link in the Export pane and then select all the tracks or
clips you want to export in the Export Tracks/Clips dialog box.
In addition to exporting your clips or audio mix to readily-recognized audio
files that are saved on your computer’s hard disk, you can also export them
directly to an audio CD by clicking the Burn Audio CD link in the Export pane.
Selecting this option opens a Burn Audio CD dialog box where you can select
all the tracks or clips you want on the CD as well as select the audio CD and
burn settings (see Chapter 7 for details).
Last but not least, you can export the audio mix in your Sound Editor project
directly to a new Audio CD project in the Music Disc Creator application
simply by clicking the Add to Music Disc Creator link in the Export pane.
Once added to an Audio CD project in this program, you can then burn it
along with other files you add to the CD project in the Music Disc Creator
program (see Chapter 7 for details).

W
orking with digital photos has become one of the more important
functions of today’s computer software. In the PhotoSuite application
in the Roxio Creator 8 suite, you have one of the most powerful tools for
fixing and editing your digital photos. Coupled with the capacity of the suite’s
Media Manager tool for organizing your digital photos (see Chapter 4) and
the ability of its VideoWave application to arrange photos into a slideshow
(see Chapter 11), you have at hand all the software you need for maintaining
and arranging all your digital photo collections from now on.
In this chapter, you find out how to use the PhotoSuite application to fix,
edit, and enhance your digital photos. You also discover how easy it is to use
PhotoSuite to print your photos either individually, in groups on a single page,
or as a contact sheet. In addition, this chapter covers sharing your digital
photos with your friends and family. As you see in this chapter, with PhotoSuite
you not only can send your photos in the body of your e-mail message, but
you can also package a group of them into a slideshow that your recipients
can then play in sequence. Alternatively, you can upload them to an online
album on the Snapfish Photo Album Web site.

Launching PhotoSuite Your Way
If you have the Roxio Creator 8 Home window open, clicking the PhotoSuite
link in the Applications Project Window after clicking Applications on the
Home tab of the Project List is the easiest way to launch the program. It is,
however, not the only way to launch PhotoSuite from Roxio Creator Home.
You can also launch the program by clicking the Fix & Enhance link on the
Photo tab of the Project List.
If the Roxio Creator 8 Home window is not open and you have a photo to edit,
you can launch PhotoSuite and load the photo from Windows. Right-click the
photo’s file icon and then position the mouse pointer over the Open With option
to displays its submenu. The first time you display the Open With submenu,
PhotoSuite 8 will not be listed as a program for opening the selected photo file. 
To add PhotoSuite to the list of programs, follow these steps:
1. Click the Choose Program option at the bottom of the Open With 
submenu. 
Windows displays the Open With dialog box.
2. Click the Browse button.
Windows opens a second Open With dialog box where you locate the
PhotoSuite program file.
3. Click the My Computer button on the left side of the dialog box and
then double-click the Local Disk (C:) icon to open it.
4. In the Local Disk (C:) folder, double-click the Program Files icon to
open it.
5. In the Program Files folder, double-click the Roxio folder icon to open it.
6. In the Roxio folder, double-click the Easy Media Creator 8 folder icon
to open it. 
7. In the Easy Media Creator 8 folder, double-click the PhotoSuite folder
icon to open it.
8. In the PhotoSuite folder, click the PhotoSuite8.exe program icon and
then click the Open button.
Windows returns you to the original Open With dialog box where
PhotoSuite 8 is not only added to the list of programs but is already
selected.
9. Click the OK button to launch PhotoSuite with the selected photo
opened and ready for editing.
164
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

After adding PhotoSuite 8 to the program list by following these somewhat
elaborate steps, the next time you want to open a photo for editing in it, you
have only to right-click the photo file icon, mouse over Open With to open its
submenu, and then click PhotoSuite 8 on it.
Getting Familiar with PhotoSuite 8
When you launch PhotoSuite with a photo to edit (as outlined in the steps in
the preceding section), a PhotoSuite 8 window similar to the one shown in
Figure 6-1 appears. When first opened, this window displays three panes: the
Task pane with Common and Edit tabs on the left, Canvas pane at top right,
and Open File(s) pane right beneath Canvas.

Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

Note that you can control which panes are displayed in the PhotoSuite window
by selecting them on PhotoSuite’s View menu. When a pane is displayed, a
check mark appears in front of its name on this menu. To hide a currently dis-
played pane, click its name on the View menu.
The Common tab contains the following panes:
 Open/Create pane contains links that enable you to open photos for
editing as well as import photos directly from your digital camera into
PhotoSuite
 Fix pane contains links to the most commonly used editing options
including adjusting the exposure, color, and sharpness; cropping; 
removing red eye;, and straightening
 Tools pane includes links to a variety of brushes that you can use to
touch up a photo
 Enhance pane contains links to a wide range of special effects (including
black and white) and to those that enable you to add text to a photo
The All tab of the Task pane contains a full list of the editing options available
(not just the most commonly used ones) arranged in the same four categories. 
Note that each of the panes on the Common and All tabs contains its own col-
lapse button (a triangle pointing upward) on its right side that changes to an
expand button when clicked (a triangle pointing downward). You can click a
category’s collapse button to temporarily hide its options to make room in
the Task pane for the options in the categories you are using. To redisplay
the options in a collapsed category, just click that category’s Expand button.
PhotoSuite’s Supported File Formats
PhotoSuite makes it a snap to fix damaged digital photos, edit their contents,
and enhance their overall look with the program’s extensive editing features.
PhotoSuite can open and edit photos saved in any of the following graphics
file formats:
 BMP (Bitmap) with the .bmp, .rle, or .dib filename extension
 JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) with the .jpg, .jpe. or .jpeg file-
name extension
 PNG (Portable Network Graphics) with the .png filename extension
 TIFF (Tagged Information File Format) with the .tif or .tiff filename 
extension
166
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

BMP or Bitmap is the Microsoft Windows’ standard graphics file format.
Bitmap files come in 2, 16, 256, and 16.7 million (24-bit) color and most use
no compression. The so-called RLE or Run-Length Encoded variation of the
basic Bitmap does use some modest compression. RLE files use 16 or 256 colors
and are primarily used in saving graphics used as Windows desktop wallpaper
and background images.
The JPEG file format is one of the most popular graphics file formats for digital
photos (many digital cameras save their photos as JPEG files). This graphics
file format uses a lossy compression scheme that attempts to reduce the over-
all file size by reducing detail in certain areas. This often results (especially in
photos with lots of detail) in a slight degradation of the overall picture quality.
JPEG is an especially good format to use for photos that you intend to display
on Web pages.
The PNG file format was developed as an alternative to the GIF (Graphics
Information Format), the ever-popular file format for displaying Web page
graphics. PNG files come in 256-color, True Color, and 32-bit color varieties
and use a lossless compression scheme to cut down on the overall size.
The TIFF file format was developed as a portable format for bitmap images.
TIFF files come in monochrome, 16-color and grayscale, 256-color and gray-
scale, and 16.7 million-color (24-bit) varieties. This file format gives you the
highest quality in terms of bitmap images, but the files are notoriously large —
especially for high-resolution images.
Although PhotoSuite can open for editing and also save edited photos in the
Bitmap, JPEG, PNG, or TIFF file format, the program’s native graphics file format
is something known as DMSP (using the .dmsp filename extension). This file
format was developed for editing photos in PhotoSuite and developing photo
projects using the program’s templates (see “Playing with PhotoSuite Projects”
later in this chapter for details). This file format supports the use of a layer
scheme (somewhat akin to that used in Adobe Photoshop) that enables you
to undo changes made to specific graphics objects (even when you’ve com-
bined multiple photos and other objects together in a collage).
When editing photos originally saved in the other supported graphics file for-
mats with PhotoSuite, open the photo and use the File➪Save As command to
save the file in PhotoSuite’s DMSP format. You do this by selecting PhotoSuite
Format (*.dmsp) in the Files of Type drop-down list in the Save As dialog
box before clicking the Save button. Then, after you finish making all your
editing changes to the photo in PhotoSuite, you can save the final edited 
version in its original graphics file format (BMP, JPEG, PNG, or TIFF) for 
distribution to others. 
167
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

The process of saving the original file as a DMSP file for the editing process
and then saving it back out in its original file format when the editing’s done
is especially important when it comes to dealing with JPEG photos. That’s
because continually saving the editing changes made to a JPEG photo in
PhotoSuite contributes to the overall degradation of its quality (especially
when the photo has a lot of detail).
Photos saved in PhotoSuite’s native DMSP file format can only be opened
with PhotoSuite. For this reason, never send a DMSP photo to anyone you
aren’t completely certain has PhotoSuite installed on his or her computer.
Also, photos saved in PhotoSuite’s DMSP native file format can’t be opened
on the Internet (always save photos bound for the Web either in the JPEG or
PNG file formats).
Fixing, Editing, and Enhancing Photos
To edit a photo in PhotoSuite, click the Open Photo link at the top of the
Open/Create pane. The Open Files dialog box, similar to the one shown in
Figure 6-2, then opens. Here, you can select the Smart View, album (see
Chapter 4 for details), or folder that contains the photo you want to edit.
When you locate the photo you want to edit in the Open Files dialog box,
click its thumbnail and then click the Open button. The selected photo then
appears in the Canvas pane on the right side of the PhotoSuite window, along
with thumbnails of it in the Object(s) pane to the right (which contains all pro-
ject objects displayed in the Canvas, including photos, clip art, paint strokes,
and text used in editing) and the Open Files pane below.

Fix me up
The Fix pane on the Common tab contains but a fraction of the fix options
available to you in PhotoSuite 8. (To see a complete list, choose Photo➪Fix
on the menu bar and look at the list of options on its submenu. Or, you can
click the All tab button and then click the Fix pane’s expand button.)
The most commonly needed options on the Fix pane include
 AutoFix to have PhotoSuite figure out and then automatically fix any
exposure, saturation, and sharpness problems in the photo
 Crop to trim the photo to a desired size and shape
 Exposure to enable you to manually adjust the exposure of the photo
 Brightness and Contrast to enable you to adjust the brightness and con-
trast of the photo
 Red Eye to remove red eye from the subjects in your photo
 Straighten to enable you to select a horizontal or vertical line that is
less than true in the photo and have PhotoSuite use it in straightening
the image. (After straightening, you can use the Crop feature to trim the
photo to remove any of the white areas now included within the original
size and shape of the photo.)
AutoFix to the rescue
As all photographers know, you can’t always take your shot in the most opti-
mal lighting conditions. The worst lighting conditions, of course, are those
outdoor settings where it’s way too bright, as when shooting right into the
sun rather than having the sun at your back, and those indoor settings where
it’s way too gloomy, as when taking a shot in a dimly lit room and the flash
doesn’t go off. As a result, like it or not, the quality of many of the pictures
you shoot ends up being compromised by the presence of some really over-
exposed or underexposed areas. 
Fortunately, digital photo editing often enables you to compensate for most
extreme lighting conditions, making it possible to return a certain amount
of balance and detail to your favorite photo. This is especially true in the
case of grossly underexposed photos where the color and detail is washed
out throughout. It also works pretty well with photos that are generally 
overexposed. Where digital photo editing is not so successful is with digi-
tal photos that suffer from both extremely over- and underexposed areas.
In these cases, you usually have to split the difference and settle for a
certain amount of improvement in toning down the washed out effect in 
overexposed areas and in bringing back a little of the color and detail to
the underexposed ones.
169
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

To instantly improve the quality of a digital photo, you can turn to the AutoFix
feature. AutoFix automates the process of trying to find the correct exposure,
saturation, and sharpness settings for a photo that suffers from either some
underexposure or overexposure.
To have PhotoSuite diagnose and attempt to cure your photo’s ills, click the
AutoFix link in the Fix pane. This opens the AutoFix dialog box, where you
can click the AutoFix button. PhotoSuite attempts to diagnose problems in
the photo’s exposure, color saturation, and sharpness, and then proceeds to
reset them. After transforming the photo, the AutoFix dialog box indicates
what areas (Exposure, Saturation, and Sharpness) have been adjusted (see
Figure 6-3).
If you don’t like the results (and often, you won’t), click the Reset button in
the AutoFix dialog box. If you like what you see and want to retain the modi-
fied photo, click the Close button in the upper-right corner of the AutoFix
dialog box and save the changes to the file (Ctrl+S). Of course, if you take the
added precaution of working on a copy of the original digital photo, you can
always fall back to opening the original photo in PhotoSuite.
Exposure, color, and sharpness
If AutoFix isn’t able to cure what ails your photo, you can try using one or more
of the individual controls — Exposure, Brightness & Contrast, Saturation,
Sharpness, and Tint — to fix the problems. 
The Exposure, Saturation, and Sharpness dialog boxes (opened by clicking
their respective options on the All tab in the Task pane) each contain their
Figure 6-3:

170
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

own AutoFix button. You can click this button in the hope that PhotoSuite
will correctly diagnose and fix the respective problems with the photo’s
exposure, color saturation, and sharpness settings.
Don’t forget that the Common tab contains only the links to the Exposure and
Brightness & Contrast options. To access the Saturation, Sharpness, and Tint
options, you must click the All tab and then expand the Fix pane.
I often find that I get better results by fiddling with the Exposure, Saturation,
and Sharpness controls individually and in the order of their appearance on
the All tab, rather than by using the AutoFix option. After making corrections
in each of these areas, I very seldom, if ever, have to go on and fool with the
Brightness & Contrast control as well.
In addition to their AutoFix buttons, the Exposure, Saturation, and Sharpness
dialog boxes also have their own sliders that you can use instead to manually
achieve the amount of correction your photo needs:
 Exposure dialog box contains Dark Areas, Midtones, and Bright Areas
sliders that enable you to adjust the exposure in just the darker or
brighter areas of the photo or only in the mid ranges in between
 Saturation task pane contains a Saturation slider for adjusting the over-
all saturation of color in the photo and a Midtones slider for adjusting
color saturation in just the mid ranges of the photo
 Sharpness task pane contains an Amount slider for adjusting the amount
of contrast in the photo’s edge pixels, a Radius slider for adjusting the
number of pixels radiating from the edge pixels that you want to sharpen,
and a Threshold slider for adjusting how different pixels must be to be
considered as the edge pixels for sharpening
Just a tint of color
The controls in the Tint dialog box enable you to correct the overall hue and
balance of color in a photo. It’s useful when you’re dealing with an old photo
print that shows yellowing from age that carries over into the digital photo
during scanning. To change the tint of a photo, open the Tint dialog box and
with the eyedropper mouse pointer click the area of the photo that should be
white or gray. PhotoSuite automatically adjusts the tint of the photo.
In some cases, you’re not trying to get rid of yellowing by restoring the
whites and grays, but rather you want to “tint” the photo in a particular color
(often to add a mood to it). You can use the Tint Color slider to select the
color you want to tint the photo and the Tint Balance slider to increase or
decrease the amount of color tinting applied.
171
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

Making it bright and crisp
The Brightness & Contrast dialog box pane, as its name implies, enables you to
modify the amount of brightness and contrast in the photo by manipulating its
Brightness and/or Contrast sliders. This dialog box does not offer any control
for automatically selecting the optimal brightness and contrast settings. Here,
you have to manipulate the appropriate slider(s) to make any modifications.
The Exposure, Saturation, Sharpness, Tint, and Brightness & Contrast dialog
boxes all contain Show Preview check boxes that are all automatically checked
so that you immediately see the effects of all the modifications you make with
the various sliders. You can use this check box to compare the changes you’ve
made to the original photo. Simply click the Show Preview check box to remove
its check mark and display the original photo; then click this check box again
to reapply its checkmark and display the modifications you’ve just made.
Here we come a cropping
The Crop option in the Fix pane enables you to cut out whatever parts you
consider extraneous in the photo so that it concentrates on what you con-
sider to be the photo’s primary subject or subjects. Cropping is one of the
most used editing tools for photos. When you click the Crop link, a Crop
dialog box opens and crop marks (indicated by dashed lines with resizing
handles shown as circles at each corner) surround the perimeter of the
photo, as shown in Figure 6-4.
Figure 6-4:
Drag the
crop marks
surrounding

cut out all

portions of

172
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

The Crop dialog box enables you to select a crop shape (other than the
default rectangular shape matching the proportions of your original photo).
You can then drag the crop marks so that only the part of the photo you want
is within the dotted lines (referred to as “the area of interest”). PhotoSuite
also indicates which part of the photo will be cropped and which part is in
the area of interest (and will be retained). PhotoSuite shows you this when
you finish the cropping procedure (by clicking the Close button in the Crop
dialog box) by making the display of the cropped area fairly transparent
while continuing to display the area of interest as normal. 
This differentiation is important when using any non-rectangular crop shape
as the program continues to display the crop marks that you manipulate as a
rectangle that contains the crop shape you select. This means that when you
use a non-rectangular crop shape, you need to pay attention to which areas
are transparent and which are in the area of interest (which no longer corre-
spond to the crop marks) in order to tell what is going to be cropped and
what is going to be retained.
When defining the area of interest with the crop marks, keep these tech-
niques in mind:
 Drag anywhere on the vertical or horizontal dashed crop lines to move
them individually.
 Drag the resize handles at a corner to resize both the vertical and horizon-
tal lines extending from that corner, while at the same time maintaining
the current aspect ratio.
 Press and hold down the Shift key when dragging a resize handle when
you want to move the vertical and horizontal lines extending from it
without maintaining the current aspect ratio.
 Drag the entire area of interest within the photo by positioning the mouse
pointer somewhere within this area and then dragging the open hand
mouse pointer.
To select a new proportion for the crop marks, click the new proportion setting
from the Select a Dimension for the Crop Area drop-down list. The proportion
refers to the comparative relation of width to height (when the default Portrait
option button is selected) or height to width (when the Landscape option
button is selected).
To see how your photo will appear when the area indicated for cropping is cut
out (without actually going ahead with the cropping), click the Hide Cropped
Area check box to put a checkmark in it. PhotoSuite then temporarily removes
all but the indicated area of interest until you click the Hide Cropped Area
check box again to remove the checkmark. If you’re happy with the results
and want to go ahead with the cropping, click the Close button in the upper-
right corner of the Crop dialog box. If you decide you don’t like the way you’ve
cropped the image, restore the photo by pressing Ctrl+Z or clicking the Undo
button on the Canvas pane’s toolbar.
173
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

Get the red out!
Red eye is a prominent problem in portraits (often caused when the subject’s
eyes reflect light from a flash). To take care of red eye in the photo all you
have to do is click the Red Eye link in the Fix pane to open the Red Eye dialog
box (see Figure 6-5). You can then click the AutoFix button to try and have
PhotoSuite take care of the problem automatically.
If the AutoFix button doesn’t take care of the problem, you can still take the
red out of the eyes of particular subjects in the photo by following this
manual procedure:
1. Click the Zoom In button on the Canvas toolbar and then drag the ver-
tical and horizontal scroll bars to bring the subject whose red eye you
want to fix into view on the screen.
Repeat Step 1 until you’ve zoomed in on the subject’s eyes so that
they’re clearly visible on the screen and big enough to manipulate.
2. Position the mouse pointer (which assumes a circular shape with a
crosshair in the middle) over one of the subject’s red eyes.
The mouse pointer must be the same size as the eyes you’re going to
treat (see Figure 6-5) before you can go ahead and click the mouse
button to replace red eye with blue coloring.

3. Drag the brush Size slider in the Red Eye dialog box to the left (to
decrease the diameter of the mouse pointer) or to the right (to increase
the diameter of the mouse pointer) until the mouse pointer is the same
size or just slightly smaller than the subject’s eyes.
Now you’re ready to replace the red eye by clicking the mouse button.
4. Position the mouse pointer so that it covers one of the subject’s eyes
and then click the mouse button.
When you click the mouse button, PhotoSuite replaces the red in the eye
with blue pixels.
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 to remove the red from the subject’s other eye.
After you finish manually removing red eye from the subjects in the photo
you’re editing, click the Close button in the Red Eye dialog box.
Flip me over and set me right
The Rotate, Flip, Straighten, and Resize editing features enable you to quickly
put the photo into its correct orientation or modify its overall size. Of these
four, the Rotate options are probably the most important, given that when-
ever you turn the camera up to get a tall, vertical shot, this photo appears as
a picture in landscape mode (as though it were laying on its side) that needs
to be rotated either ninety degrees counterclockwise (to the left) or clockwise
(to the right).
When you open the Transform menu on the PhotoSuite 8 menu bar, you find
the following three rotate options you can use to quickly correct the orienta-
tion of most photos:
 Rotate Left to rotate the photo ninety degrees counterclockwise (the
same as clicking the Rotate Counter Clockwise button on the Canvas
toolbar)
 Rotate Right to rotate the photo ninety degrees clockwise (the same as
clicking the Rotate Clockwise button on the Canvas toolbar)
 Rotate 180 Degree to rotate the photo so that it’s completely turned
upside down
If you want to rotate the photo to any other angle, you can do this from the
Rotation combo box on the Canvas pane’s Option bar. After selecting the 
current rotation setting in this box, you can replace it by typing in the new
value (representing the number of degrees between 1 and 359 that the photo
should be rotated in a clockwise direction). You can also select the number of
degrees to rotate the photo by clicking the combo box’s Plus (+) or Minus (–)
button until the desired number of degrees is displayed in the combo box.
175
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

The Flip options on the Transform menu enable you to reverse the orienta-
tion of your photo. The Flip options include:
 Flip Vertical so that what appears at the top in the original photo
now appears on the bottom (this is equivalent to rotating the photo
180 degrees)
 Flip Horizontal so that what appears on the right in the original photo
now appears on the left
 Flip Both so that the photo is flipped both horizontally and vertically
Can you straighten this out?
The Straighten option enables you to straighten your photo (something I always
seem to need help with). To use this feature, click the Straighten link on the
Fix pane to open the Straighten dialog box and then follow these simple steps:
1. Click the mouse pointer at one end of some object in the photo that
should be perfectly horizontal or vertical.
You now need to draw a horizontal or vertical line that PhotoSuite can
use as a guideline when straightening the photo (see Figure 6-6).
Figure 6-6:
Using a
horizontal
line in a
photo to
straighten it.
176
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

2. Drag the mouse pointer along the object to draw the guideline to be
used in straightening the photo horizontally or vertically.
Now you’re ready to have PhotoSuite actually straighten the picture.
3. Click the Straighten button in the Straighten dialog box. If the straight-
ened photo requires cropping, proceed to Step 4. Otherwise, click the
Close button in the Straighten dialog box.
4. (Optional) Click the Switch to Crop button, then click the Yes button
in the dialog box asking you to flatten the object to open the Crop
dialog box.
5. Crop the photo as required (see Figure 6-7) and then click the Close
button in the Crop dialog box.
When it’s a matter of size
The Width and Height text boxes on the Canvas pane’s Option bar indicate
the current size of the photo in inches. (To change the units for these text
boxes, click the drop-down button to the right of in. and then select cm. for
centimeters or pixel on its drop-down list.) To resize a photo, all you have to
do is click in either the Width or Height box and then select the current value
and replace it by typing in a new value (in the currently selected units).

Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

When you press the Enter key or click the mouse pointer somewhere in the
image in the Canvas pane after entering a new value in the Width or Height
text box, PhotoSuite automatically adjusts the value in the other text box to
maintain the original proportions of the image.
If you want to resize a photo without maintaining these proportions, you
must do it from the Resize dialog box opened by clicking the Resize link in
the Fix pane on the All tab. Then, click its Maintain Proportions check box to
remove its check mark before you replace the values in both its Width and
Height text boxes.
When you resize a photo from the Resize dialog box, PhotoSuite puts sizing
handles all around the image in the Canvas pane. You can manually resize the
image by dragging one of these handles. You drag a corner handle to change
the width and height of the image at the same time while maintaining the
original proportions (providing that the Maintain Proportions check box is
still selected).
Unless you’re sure you know what you’re doing, don’t remove the check mark
from the Maintain Proportions check box in the Resize dialog box before you
start resizing the photo — either manually or by entering new values into the
Width or Height text boxes. By resizing a photo without regard to the aspect
ratio between the width and the height (that’s the proportions that are being
maintained), you can end up with a photo that’s really distorted.
Achieving that perfect photo effect
PhotoSuite is the best when it comes to easy-to-apply special effects. In addi-
tion to the ready-made special effects you have to choose from, you can also
lighten a photo by increasing its transparency setting or give the photo a real
old-fashioned look by using the Edge Fading control to dissolve its edges.
In addition to applying these filters, transparency, and edging effects, you can
also add text to your photos, paint and draw on them, and even add cutouts
that remove particular shapes from the photo (a really handy technique when
combined with non-rectangular crop shapes where you want to cut off the white
areas that fill in the original rectangle that are left behind after cropping the
photo to the new shape).
Dazzling special effects for every mood
PhotoSuite includes a wide array of special effects that can really change the
look of your photo. To have a gander at all the effects and experiment with
what they do (or don’t do for your photo), click the Special Effects link in the
Enhance pane on the Common or All tab of the Task pane.
178
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

PhotoSuite then opens the Special Effects dialog box. This dialog box con-
tains a drop-down list box at the top where you can select the category of
effects (Adjust Color through Warp) you want to work with. All Effects is
selected by default in this drop-down list box so that every special effect
available in PhotoSuite is listed in the list box area below. To apply a special
effect to the current photo displayed in the Canvas pane, you simply click the
effect’s thumbnail in this list box (see Figure 6-8).
When you click one of the special effect thumbnails, PhotoSuite immediately
applies that special effect to the photo in the Canvas pane. If you don’t like
the effect, you can just go ahead and choose another in the Special Effects
dialog box (PhotoSuite’s special effects are not cumulative so you don’t have
to cancel one effect before trying another).
Note that many of the special effects enable you to adjust their settings, usu-
ally in the form of sliders (for example, the Cool Color 1 effect shown in the
Special Effects dialog box in Figure 6-8). When you’ve got the special effect
that you want to stay with, click the Apply button at the bottom of the dialog
box before you click its Close button (if you click Close before you click Apply,
the previewed effect is not applied to the image and it returns to the state it
was in before you opened Special Effects).

Adding text to your photos
PhotoSuite makes it easy to annotate your pictures with text. You can use
this feature to add titles to your photos. To do this, click the Add or Edit Text
link in the Enhance pane on the Common or All tab. PhotoSuite then displays
the Add or Edit Text dialog box like the one shown in Figure 6-9 where you
can enter the title or whatever label you want to add and then select the text
color, font, font size, font attributes, and alignment for it.
To annotate your photo with text in the Add or Edit Text dialog box, follow
these steps:
1. Type the text you want to appear in the photo in the Select a Text
Object and Edit Its Text Below list box.
To add line breaks to the title or comments you’re typing, press the
Enter key.
Now you’re ready to adjust the text settings beginning with the text
color. By default, PhotoSuite selects black as the text color that only
works when placing the text on a very light background in the photo.
2. (Optional) Click the Color drop-down button and then click the text
color you want to use on the pop-up palette.
Figure 6-9:
You can add
titles to your

Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

If you want to use a color that appears in the photo, click the eyedrop-
per icon in the lower-right corner of the color palette and then click the
color you want to use in photo. If you want to mix a sample color, click
the More Colors button in the lower-left corner of the color palette and
then create a new color by entering the appropriate Red, Green, and Blue
values or by dragging the crosshairs in the Hues and Shades sample
boxes before clicking OK.
By default, PhotoSuite picks Tahoma as the font in which to display the
text. If you wish, you can select another font to use from a wide variety
of fonts that PhotoSuite makes available.
3. (Optional) Click the Font drop-down button and then click the name of
the font you want to use in the drop-down list.
If you want, you can select a larger or smaller font size to use for the text.
4. (Optional) Type a new point size in the Font Size combo box or use its
Plus (+) or Minus (–) buttons to select a new point size.
In addition to adjusting the font and font size, you can also change the
alignment of the text in its text box (which is left-justified horizontally
and top-justified vertically by default), add the bold, italics, or underlin-
ing attribute to the text, and even scrunch up or spread out the text in
the text box by modifying the Horizontal Scaling percentages (percent-
ages below 100% bring the text closer together and percentages above
100% spread it out).
5. (Optional) Make any necessary adjustments to the text alignment, text
attributes, or horizontal scaling.
PhotoSuite positions the new text box in the dead center of the photo.
Most of the time, you’ll want to move the text box to a more appropriate
location in the photograph.
6. Position the mouse pointer inside the text box and when the pointer
changes to an open hand, drag the text box to the desired position on
the photo.
In addition to repositioning the text box in the photo, you may also want
to re-orient the text by rotating the text box.
7. (Optional) Position the mouse pointer on the rotation handle (the larger
ball in the middle at the top of the box). When the mouse pointer turns
into a circular arrow, drag it until the text is oriented just as you want
it to appear in the final photo.
When you have the text positioned and oriented the way you want it,
you’re ready to set it.
8. Click the Close button to close the Add or Edit Text dialog box.Then
click somewhere in the white space outside the image in the Canvas
pane to remove the box’s outline as well as its sizing and rotation 
handles.
181
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

After adding text to a photo, a text object (indicated by an A on blank page)
appears in the Object(s) pane. If you need to edit the text, double-click this
text object and PhotoSuite will not only reselect the text box but the Option
bar will now display text controls — Color, Font, Bold, Italic, Underline, Size,
Horizontal Scaling, Align Left, Align Center, Align Right, Align Top, and Align
Middle. You can use these controls to change the attributes of the text (to edit
the text, you must click the Add or Edit Text link in the Enhance pane when
the text box is selected).
Touching up your photos with painting and drawing
You can use PhotoSuite’s painting and drawing tools to touch up your photos
or even add either freehand or predefined shapes to your photos. These tools
include a Paint Brush tool that you can use to add brushstrokes to your photo,
a Flood Fill tool that fills particular areas of the photo with color, and a Touchup
Brush tool that adds color to the photo by actually painting on it (when you
use the Paint Brush and Flood Fill tools, you create and add new graphic art
objects to the photo, which means that you can continue to edit it because
the object is on its own layer).
In addition to adding painting and drawing to your photo, you can also add
standard shapes such as circles, squares, triangles, and the like with the
Predefined Shapes tool as well as create custom shapes of your own design with
Custom Shapes. Note, however, that you will mostly want to reserve the adding
of shapes to photo projects where they can combine with the photos you’re
adding rather than literally overshadow them (see “Playing with PhotoSuite
Projects” later in this chapter for information on creating projects).
In the Paint Brush dialog box (opened by clicking the Paint Brush link in the
Tools pane on the Common or All tab), select the brush shape and paint color.
You can then use the two sliders to refine your brush settings:
 Thickness to increase or decrease the width of the brush
 Softness to set the amount of blurring at the edges of the stroke and how
much the stroke blends into the background
After you finish setting your brush settings, you can drag the mouse pointer
to paint strokes on the photo. All the strokes that you make with a particular
set of brush settings are adding to a single brush object in the Objects pane.
If you make a mistake and want to erase a particular stroke, click the Undo
button on the Canvas toolbar to remove it.
If, after painting on the image, you decide that a brush stroke needs modifi-
cation, click the Edit and Existing Paint Stroke button at the top of the Paint
Brush dialog box. PhotoSuite then selects the brush stroke (indicated by the
bounding box with sizing handles all around it and a rotation handle at the
182
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

top). You can then change the brush shape, color, thickness, and/or softness
settings in the Paint Brush dialog box and these changes will immediately
appear in the selected brush stroke object in the Canvas pane. 
Note that working with the Touchup Brush in the Tools pane is similar except
that you can select not only your brush shape, paint color, and brush size, but
also modify the Transparency and the Edge Fading setting (which works like the
Softness setting in the Paint Brush dialog box). In addition, you need to select
a particular style of the Touchup Brush that determines what kind of painting
you do. These brush style selections include a wide variety of effects which
the PhotoSuite attempts to illustrate through the use of butterfly thumbnails
displayed in the Select a Touchup Brush list box at the top of the dialog box.
Note that the function of most of the brush styles in this list is far from evi-
dent from their thumbnails. You should experiment with them to see just
what effects they produce, as some are quite surprising. For example, the
Lighten brush style actually lightens the colors of whatever object you paint
with it rather than putting down the paint color you’ve selected. So too, the
Transparency brush style actually removes all color, acting like an eraser
function found in other paint programs.
When you paint with the Touchup Brush using the settings you’ve chosen,
PhotoSuite does not put down each stroke as a separate brush object — 
indicated by the lack of a new brush object in the Object(s) pane. This does
not mean that you can’t delete a brushstroke made with the Touchup Brush
(you do this by clicking the Undo button on the Canvas toolbar), but it does
mean that you can’t do any more editing to the brushstroke, such as move or
rotate it after you’ve finish painting with this brush (something you can do
when using the regular paint brush).
Getting ready to use the Flood Fill tool in the Flood Fill dialog box (opened by
clicking Flood Fill in the Tools pane on the All tab) is very similar to getting
ready to use the Touchup Brush tool in that you must select a fill style in the
Select a Fill Style list box (using the exact same list of styles illustrated with
the very same butterfly thumbnails as in the Select a Touchup Brush list box),
as well as fill color, transparency, and edge fading.
Instead of setting the brush size as you do in the Touchup Brush dialog box,
in the Flood Fill dialog box, you indicate how the pixels in the photo are
selected for filling by using the Tolerance slider. If you set a low tolerance
with this slider, PhotoSuite fills the pixels area you click with the paint bucket
mouse pointer that are the same color or very close in hue. If you set a high
tolerance with this slider, PhotoSuite fills the pixels that are similar but not
exactly the same in the area you click.
183
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

After making your modifications to the Flood Fill settings, you can fill sections
of the photo by clicking the paint bucket mouse pointer on the area you want
filled. Which pixels are filled with the selected color, using the designated fill
style in the area you click, depends upon the tolerance you use. If you want
to fill more areas than the current tolerance allows, you can drag the paint
bucket mouse pointer around the area to be filled. If PhotoSuite ends up fill-
ing more of the photo that you wanted, click the Undo button on the Canvas
toolbar to remove it.
Bring on the clones
The Clone Brush dialog box opens by clicking the Clone Brush link in the
Tools pane on the Common or All tab, and contains the controls for sampling
an area of the photo and then painting another area with the same pixels.
This feature is great for repairing damaged or washed out areas of a photo
by taking a part of the nearby background and using it to fill in the missing
or damaged places.
To use the Clone Brush to repair an area of your photo, you follow these steps:
1. (Optional) Click the Zoom In button and drag the horizontal and verti-
cal scroll bars until both the damaged area and the area whose pixels
you want to clone are prominently displayed in the PhotoSuite window.
2. Position the mouse pointer (which assumes a circular shape with a
crosshair in the middle) over one edge of the undamaged area whose
pixels you want to paint with.
Next you may need to adjust the Size, Transparency, and Edge Fading
settings with their respective sliders. Use the Size slider to adjust the
size of the circular mouse pointer, keeping in mind that its diameter
becomes the size of both the source brush you use to sample the pixels
you want to clone and the destination brush you use to paint the damaged
area with the cloned pixels. Use the Transparency slider to determine the
intensity of cloned pixels: drag to the right for a lighter effect and to the
left for a more opaque effect. Use the Edge Fading slider to increase or
decrease the amount of fading around the edge of the destination brush
(that is, the one you paint the damaged area of the photo with).
2. (Optional) Manipulate the Size, Transparency, and Edge Fading sliders
until you’ve got the settings you think you want to use in cloning.
Now you’re ready to establish the starting point for the cloned pixels by
clicking the mouse pointer. This establishes the starting point for the
source brush that clones whatever pixels it passes over.
3. Click the mouse pointer to establish the starting point for the source
brush, which clones the pixels it passes over.
184
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

All that’s left to do now is paint with the mouse pointer over the dam-
aged or washed out portion of the photo using the pixels in the area
around the cloning start point. 
4. Drag the mouse pointer over the damaged or washed out area of the
photo, replacing its pixels with those passed over by the source brush.
When painting the damaged or washed out area, be aware of the strokes of
your destination brush that’s repairing the damaged area, and also keep your
eye on the strokes of your source brush picking up the pixels you’re painting
with. If the strokes of your source brush go outside of the area you want cloned
in the damaged area, you start painting with part of the image that you don’t
want copied to the damaged area. If this happens, click the Undo button on
the Canvas pane’s toolbar until the cloned pixels that don’t belong are removed
from the photo.
If you find that you keep painting with an unwanted part of the picture, try
resetting the start point of the source brush at a place where there are more
pixels you want to use. To do this, click the Reset Start Point button near the
top of the Clone dialog box and then click the mouse pointer at a new, safer
starting point for the source brush before dragging the mouse pointer to
paint with the destination brush.
When you’ve repaired all the damaged or washed out areas in the photo,
click the Close button in the Clone Brush dialog box.
Now, cut that out!
The Mask and Cutout feature enables you to separate an area of special inter-
est in a photo from its background by cutting that area out so that you can
manipulate it independently of the rest of the photo (such as apply a special
effect to that area alone or save it in it own graphics file). When defining the
object or area in a photo to cut out, you can either enclose the area in a wide
variety of predefined shapes or you can select the area by tracing it or having
PhotoSuite automatically attempt to trace the area by its edges or its color.
To create a cutout using a predefined shape, you follow these steps:
1. Open the Mask/Cutout by Shape dialog box by clicking the Mask/Cutout
by Shape link in the Tools pane on the All tab.
The Mask/Cutout by Shape dialog box is shown in Figure 6-10.
2. Click the shape that you want to use in defining the cutout in the list
box and then click the Add Selected Shape button.
When you click the Add Selected Shape button, PhotoSuite inserts that
shape in your photo surrounded by rotation and sizing handles.
185
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

3. Move, size, and rotate the shape as required so that it encloses the
area to be included in the cutout.
When enclosing the cutout area with preset shapes, you can use more
than one shape (Figure 6-10 shows an example of this where I combined
a triangle and rectangle to enclose the Transamerica Pyramid building
in downtown San Francisco). When the Combine with Current Selection
option button is selected (as it is by default), PhotoSuite adds each
new shape to the cutout. When you click the Subtract From Current
Selection option button, each new shape reduces the cutout area
(depending on how you make them overlap the original cutout shape,
you can end up with very interesting effects). PhotoSuite differentiates
between the shape enclosing the cutout and that outside of the cutout
by displaying the cutout area normally and  the area beyond the cutout
as transparent.
If you’re happy with the cutout selection and are ready to save it in a new
file or make it into a new graphics object, proceed to Step 6. If, however,
you want to cut out everything but what’s in the shape(s) you’ve set in
the photo, you need to follow Step 5 first.
4. (Optional) If you want to make the cutout everything in the photo
except what’s enclosed within the preset shapes, click the Invert
Selection button.
Figure 6-10:

186
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

Now you’re ready to proceed to area 4 where you follow the last steps in
the process.
5. Click the Create Cutout button to open the Create Cutout From Mask
dialog box.
This dialog box contains four options buttons from which you can choose:
• Cut It Out to replace the existing image in the Canvas pane with
the masked area (which you can then enhance and save as a new
file using File➪Save As)
• Create a New Object (the default) to create a new independent
object from the masked area that appears in the Objects pane with-
out disturbing the original photo (good when you want to create a
duplicate of an image in the photo)
• Cookie-cut It Out to create a new independent object from the
masked area that appears in the Objects pane by removing it from
the rest of the photo (so that when you move it around there’s a
gap in the rest of the image where the cutout once was)
• Save Masked Area to a File to save the masked area in its own
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file
6. Select the type of cutout you want to create by selecting the Cut It Out,
Create a New Object, Cookie-cut It Out, or Save Masked Area to a File
option button and then click OK to close the Mask/Cutout by Shape
dialog box.
As soon as the Mask/Cutout by Shape dialog box closes, PhotoSuite displays
the new cutout (except in the case of Save Masked Area to a File — the Save
to File dialog box opens where you assign the filename and location of the
new PNG file).
If you selected the Cut It Out option, only the image in the cutout remains dis-
played in the Canvas pane (be sure to save this image with a new filename using
File➪Save As) if you don’t intend to replace the original photo with its cutout.
If you selected the Create a New Object option, the cutout is selected in the
photo and you can then reposition it and enhance only its image as you see fit
(for example, you can change its transparency with the Transparency slider
on the Canvas pane’s Options bar). Figure 6-11 shows the photo originally
seen in Figure 6-10 after moving the cutout created with the default Create
New Object option to create a duplicate Transamerica Pyramid building. Note
that if I had created this cutout using the Cookie-cut It Out option, instead of
a duplicate Transamerica Pyramid building, you would see a big blank white
space in the middle of the photo where the building used to be.
187
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

Cutouts using predefined shapes are great for giving whimsical or meaningful
shapes to the parts of photos that you intend to put into a collage project
(see “Playing with PhotoSuite Projects” later in this chapter). For example,
you can cut out heart-shaped figures in photos intended for Valentine’s or
wedding collages and cards or starburst-shaped ones for graduation albums.
The procedure for creating a cutout by freehand tracing, picking colors, or
edge tracing is similar in every way except for the process of actually select-
ing the cutout area. In the Tools pane on the All tab under the Mask/Cutout
by Shape link, you have the following choices for creating a cutout:
 Freehand Mask/Cutout: choose this link to manually designate the
cutout area by clicking a starting point (which appears as a white circle)
and then tracing all around the area until you meet back with and con-
nect the selection by clicking on the starting point (as you trace, you
can click to establish intermediary points that enable you to turn cor-
ners and change direction)
 Mask/Cutout by Color: choose this link to select the cutout area simply
by clicking on its color in the photo with the magic wand mouse pointer
(you can use the Tolerance slider to determine how much the hues can
differ when making the selection)
 Mask/Cutout Edge Tracing: choose this link to manually designate the
cutout area by clicking a starting point (which appears as a white circle)
and then clicking all around the area until you close the selection by
clicking on the start point and then clicking the Create Cutout button
in the Mask/Cutout Edge Tracing dialog box
Figure 6-11:

188
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

After selecting the cutout area using any of these three methods, the rest of
the steps outlined for creating cutouts from predefined shapes apply (that
is, from Step 4 on in the step-by-step procedure that appears earlier in this
section).
Mask that effect!
The Mask/Cutout features enable you to apply a special effect to just a particu-
lar area in your photo by masking out and thereby protecting all the other areas
in the picture. The procedure for actually creating the mask (which, remem-
ber, defines the area that you can then apply special effects to) is identical to
that for creating cutouts: you can either create a mask using any of the preset
shapes or by freehand tracing, picking colors, or edge tracing, (see the section,
“Now, cut that out!” for details).
After you define the mask, you are ready to use it when applying special effects
in the Special Effects dialog box (opened by clicking Special Effects in the
Enhance pane on the Common and All tabs — see “Dazzling special effects
for every mood” earlier in this chapter for details).
Figure 6-12 illustrates how this masking concept works. For this photo, I cre-
ated a mask that included only the blue sky above the buildings on Columbus
Street in San Francisco. I then applied the Magenta special effect to the photo.
Because of the mask, only the sky is given this wild color, leaving the build-
ings their original colors (a fact that you surely can’t appreciate seeing the
photo only in black-and-white).

Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

Adding More Images and 
Clip Art to a Photo
PhotoSuite’s Insert Photos & Cutouts link in the Open/Create pane on the
Common and All tabs makes it easy to combine photos by superimposing one
on top of the other. This feature makes it easy to put together a photo mon-
tage that combines different images into one. In addition, the Clip Art link in
the Enhance pane on the Common and All tabs also lets you add stock images
along the line of Windows clipart (but a great deal classier) to your photos.
To superimpose a photo on top of the photo you’re currently editing, you
follow these steps:
1. Click the Add Photos & Cutouts link in the Open/Create pane of the
Common or All tab to open the Add dialog box.
The Add dialog box (which works just like the Open dialog box) is where
you select the Smart View, album, or folder containing the photo or the
cutouts (see “Now, cut that out!” earlier in this chapter) you want to add
and then click the photo’s filename before clicking the Add button.
2. Open the Smart View, album, or file folder that contains the file with
the photo or cutout you want to add, then click the graphic file’s icon
before you click the Add button.
When the Add dialog box closes, the added photo or cutout appears
selected (indicated by its sizing and rotation handles) in the center of
the photo you’re currently editing. Next, you can reposition and, if nec-
essary, resize and rotate the added photo.
3. Resize and rotate the added image and then drag it to its final position
on the background photo.
You can also edit this added photo with any of the features available on
the Common and All tabs of the Task pane.
4. (Optional) Make any needed editing changes to the added photo,
including improving its overall quality, removing red eye and dust,
adding special effects, changing the transparency, or adding a shadow.
Now you’re ready to save your changes either in the original graphics
file, or, more likely in a new graphics file.
5. Choose File➪Save on the PhotoSuite menu bar to save your combined
photos in the original photo’s file or choose File➪Save As and modify the
folder location and/or filename before you click the Save button in the
Save As dialog box to save your photo montage in a new graphics file.

When you add one photo to another, a thumbnail of the newly added photo
appears in the Objects pane along with that of the original photo. You can
use this pane to easily select the photo you want to edit: simply double-click
its thumbnail in the Objects pane. PhotoSuite shows you that the photo you
click is now selected in the work area by enclosing the photo in dashed lines
and adding sizing and rotation handles to it.
As I mention at the beginning of this section, instead of superimposing just
photos on top of the photo you’re editing, you can also add Clip Art.
To superimpose a piece of PhotoSuite Clip Art to the photo you’re currently
editing, you follow these steps:
1. Click the Clip Art link in the Enhance pane on the Common or All tab
of the Task pane to open the Clip Art dialog box.
The Clip Art dialog box arranges the different types of Clip Art images
that it offers into albums whose icons appear in its list box.
2. Click the drop-down button in the Clip Art dialog box and then click the
icon of the album with the type of images you want to use or double-
click its icon in the list box.
Note that if you open the All album at the very top of the drop-down list,
PhotoSuite displays thumbnails of all its Clip Art in the list box.
3. Double-click the thumbnail of the Clip Art you want to add or drag it
over to the photo in the work area and drop it anywhere.
PhotoSuite superimposes a copy of the Clip Art prop in the exact center
of the background photo. Now you’re ready to resize it and put the prop
in its proper position (I dare you to say that twenty times really fast).
4. If needed, resize the Clip Art and rotate it before you drag it to the
desired position in relation to the background photo.
To see how your Clip Art image fits in with the background, you may
want to select it (especially if you reduced its size) to remove all the
selection hash marks and sizing and rotation handles. You can do this by
clicking the background photo anywhere outside of the Clip Art or by
double-clicking the thumbnail image of the background photo in the
Objects pane.
5. Click the Close button in the Clip Art dialog box and then save the
changes to the file in the All Edit Features task pane with File➪Save
or in a new file with File➪Save As.

Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

Bring on the Borders
PhotoSuite’s Borders feature enables you to give your photos a finished look
by surrounding them with some sort of decorative border. In the Enhance pane
on the All tab of the Task pane you can choose between these three links:
 Frame to surround the photo in any of a wide variety of frame-type
graphics
 Mat to mat the photo either with a solid color or colored texture
 Edge to select a type of edging that you then combine with a mat color
or pattern
When you select the Frame link, PhotoSuite opens the Frame dialog box con-
taining a number of albums (All, Beveled Wood, Classic Black, and Metal) and
then lets you choose a particular frame style. After you find the frame to add
in the album of your choice, double-click its frame icon to add it to the photo
in the Canvas pane. 
PhotoSuite then lets you move and, if necessary, resize the photo in the frame.
To help you in moving and resizing the photo in its frame, PhotoSuite indicates
the edges of the image by showing its perimeter as a dotted line with round
sizing handles at the corners and midpoints. Most often these edges of the
image extend beyond the cutout portion of the frame. Moving and/or resizing
the photo in the frame therefore displays different parts of the image in the
cutout region (the frame actually ends up cropping parts of the image). Be
careful when manipulating the image in the frame that you don’t expose the
white background behind the photo or crop a part of the image that you want
displayed.
When you select the Mat link in the Enhance pane, PhotoSuite opens the Mat
dialog box (similar to the one shown in Figure 6-13). This dialog box contains
three albums (All, Colors, and Textures) that you can use to select the proper
mat with the proper color and texture. If none of these mats will do, you can
click the Use My Own Photo button to select a photo to use as a textured mat.
After applying the colored or textured mat to your photo (by double-clicking
its mat icon), you then can adjust the width of the mat as well as control
whether or not to display beveling on the mat’s edges and include v-groove
(and adjust its offset from the inside of the mat) by using its sliders.
When you select the Edge link in the Enhance pane, PhotoSuite opens the
Edge dialog box that enables you to select an edging style to use with the
matting. The Edge dialog box (shown in Figure 6-14) contains a Select an Edge
list box containing albums with different types of edging patterns (All, Brush,
Digital, and Torn). Below this you find a Select a Mat Category list box that
contains the same albums as the Mat dialog box (All, Colors, and Textures).

Select an edge style in one of the albums in the Select an Edge list box and
then apply it to your photo by double-clicking its icon. Then, apply the color
or text that you want to use with that style by double-clicking its icon after
opening the Colors or Textures album in the Select a Mat Category list box.
After selecting the edge style and mat color or texture, you can then adjust
the width of the edging if you want by using its size slider before clicking the
Close button in the Edge dialog box.
Playing with PhotoSuite Projects
Roxio Creator 8 contains a Photo Project Assistant that makes it really easy
to use your digital photos to create fun and interesting photo projects. This
Assistant supports a wide variety of project types that run the gamut from
the ever-popular photo collage to posters. All are based on adding your own
digital photos to project templates that give you ready-made background
and, in many cases, stock text that you can adapt to your own needs. 
To launch the Photo Project Assistant, you can either click the Photo Projects
link in the Open/Create pane on the Common or All tab within PhotoSuite, or
you can click the More Projects link on the Photo tab of the Project List in the
Roxio Creator 8 Home window. 
When the Photo Project Assistant window first opens (as shown in Figure 6-15),
you can choose from the following project types:
 Albums to put your photos into the pages of photo albums using 
pre-designed pages dedicated to subjects such as the new baby,
your wedding, the latest vacation, and the like
 Calendars to make calendars with your own photos using any of a wide
variety of different calendar designs
 Cards to make greeting cards with your own photos for almost all the
major holidays and occasions (including birthdays, anniversaries, grad-
uation, and so on)
 Collage to make a collage with your photos using either a blank collage
background or any of a number of pre-designed backgrounds including
those for the new baby, birthdays, Christmas, weddings, and so on
 Gift Tags to make gift tags carrying your photos for decorating anniver-
sary, birthday, and Christmas presents
 Posters to make a poster using your own photos for events such as a
book club, concert, birthday, and so on
194
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

For all the project types, PhotoSuite makes it as easy as possible to create
your new photo project by walking you through the steps. In most cases, all
you have to do is select the project template you want to use, choose the
photos you want to add to that template, and then make a few changes to
modify the arrangement of the photos and customize the stock text.
Stitching It All Together
PhotoSuite’s Panorama Assistant makes it possible to create a single photo
with a sweeping panorama from sequential and overlapping individual photos
that you take of the same view. This feature is great provided that you’ve done
your homework and the photos that you’re trying to stitch together match up
and overlap correctly. Accordingly, Roxio has set up some important guidelines
for you to follow before attempting to stitch together your favorite photos of
the Grand Canyon:
 Use a tripod when taking the photos to stitch together (if you don’t have
a tripod, try to keep the camera level and in the same position when taking
the pictures by rotating your body around the camera rather than rotat-
ing the camera around your body)
Figure 6-15:
When you
first open
the Photo
Projects
Assistant,
you can
choose from
among sev-
eral types of
projects.
195
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

 Overlap each photo that you take in the sequence (Roxio recommends
between 20% to 40% overlap on each shot)
 Don’t change any of the settings on your camera between the shots
you take
 Use only optical zoom when taking the picture: if your camera has a digi-
tal zoom, don’t use it in shooting the photo sequence
 Take your photos in sequence from left to right or if you’re scanning in
developed photos, scan them in left-to-right order to ensure that their
filenames appear in order
 Do not edit your photos in PhotoSuite before you stitch them together:
instead, edit the final panorama produced by Photo Stitch
 Rotate your camera 90 degrees to take portrait shots of the panorama:
doing this requires more shots but results in a much taller panorama
with more detail
In addition to following these guidelines when taking the shots you would later
like to stitch together, you must have one more piece of information at your
fingertips when using Photo Stitch and that is the focal length used in taking
the photos. Focal length, as any photographer will tell you, is the distance
between the film (or CCD in a digital camera) and the optical center of the
lens when the lens is set on infinity (this distance is usually given in millime-
ters and marked on the side of the fixed lenses on a standard 35mm camera).
Trying to determine the focal length for digital cameras, even real fancy ones
like my Sony that are equipped with an optical zoom lens, can be difficult.
Determining this information is complicated by the fact that the actual focal
length for digital cameras is much less than for a standard 35mm camera
because their CCDs are much smaller than 35mm film. 
If your digital camera has an optical zoom lens, check and see if the camera
records the focal length at the time you take your photos. If your camera
doesn’t record this information (I know that mine doesn’t), check your
camera manual. If you can’t find that or it doesn’t give you a clue as to the
focal length of your lens when set at infinity, you’ll just have to guess when
it comes time to give Photo Stitch that information.
The procedure for stitching two or more sequential photos together to create
a single panoramic photo is as follows:
1. After clicking Applications on the Home tab to launch the Panorama
Assistant, click the Create Panoramas link under Utilities in the
Applications Project window of the Roxio Creator 8 Home window.
The first Panorama Assistant window, Add Photos, is the place where
you select the photos to be used in the panorama. Here, you must select
196
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

a minimum of two photos, although most panoramas (especially those
taken in portrait mode) require more.
2. Click the Add Photos button to open the Add Photos dialog box and
then select all the photos you want to stitch together before you click
the Add Photos button.
You now need to make any adjustments to the rotation or order of the
photos you added to the work area of the first Create Panorama window.
If they’re not in order, you need to drag them into order (don’t forget to
select the Fit to Page setting at the very bottom of the Select Zoom Level
drop-down list box to display all the photos together in the work area).
3. Make any necessary adjustments to the orientation or order of the
photos so that they’re all in portrait or landscape mode and are in
left-to-right order for stitching and then click the Next> button.
The second Panorama Assistant window, Adjust, appears and attempts
to automatically determine the focal length of your photos. If it can’t
determine this value (which is true for most of the digital photos you
take), you need to select this value by dragging the Focal Length slider
until the correct number (in millimeters) appears immediately above the
right end of the Focal Length slider.
4. (Optional) If Photo Stitch can’t automatically determine the focal
length for your photos, select the correct length (or your best guess)
with the Focal Length slider.
Now you’re ready to have Photo Stitch do its magic.
5. Click the Auto Align button.
The Panorama Assistant stitches together your photos, showing you a
preview of the new panorama in the work area. If you notice some prob-
lems, try clicking the Fine Tuning button to see if the Assistant can detect
and fix the problem. If this doesn’t do it, click and manually drag the
photos into final position (remember that you can use the arrow keys to
nudge the selected photo into place).
6. If necessary, fine-tune the positioning of the photos and then click the
Next> button.
The Panorama Assistant shows you the final product ready for you to
save or print. Be sure to save your photo after you click the Done button
in the Create Panorama dialog box asking you if you want to save the
panorama.
7. Click Done in the Panorama Assistant and then click Yes in the Create
Panorama dialog box. Then, replace the temporary filename, Stitch.jpg,
with the filename of your choosing before you click the Save As button
in the Save As dialog box.
197
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

After saving your panorama, you can edit its JPEG graphics file in PhotoSuite
as you would any other digital photo that you had at your disposal. That is
the place to improve any exposure or color balance problems.
Group Editing
The Multi Photo Enhance feature enables you to do group editing to a bunch
of photos that all need the same kind of modifications or enhancements. It’s a
real timesaver when you have a lot of photos that all need the same kind of
changes made to them. You open this application by clicking the Multi Photo
Enhance link under Utilities in the Applications Project window of the Roxio
Creator 8 window after you click Applications on the Home tab of the Project
List pane.
The Photos to Enhance dialog box that opens when you click Multi Photo
Enhance contains an Add Files button that you use to select all the photos
that require the same kind of editing. The modifications and enhancements
that you can perform at one time on a group of photos that you’ve selected
include:
 Fix to take care of any of the exposure, color saturation, sharpness, or
red eye problems in the group (you can even use AutoFix on them)
 Transform to rotate, flip, or resize all the photos in the group in the
same way
 Special Effects to apply the Black and White, Invert, or Sepia special
effects to all the photos in the group
 Convert/Rename to use Rename to give new filenames made up of a
keyword and a sequential number (such as Newbaby00, Newbaby01,
Newbaby02, and so on), or Convert to convert the group from one
type of graphics file to another (such as DMSP to JPEG for use on the
Internet)
Among the most important and unique modifications that you can perform
with the Multi Photo Enhance feature are surely the Rename and Convert
options. The Rename option enables you to name of group of related photo
files so that they all show up together in a preset order in any file listing
you do. The Convert option enables you to move a batch of photos from
one file format to another in a fraction of the time it would take to convert
them individually.

Printing Your Photos
Printing your photos with PhotoSuite is a straightforward process. Simply
click the Print button on the Canvas pane’s toolbar to open the Print window
(similar to the one shown in Figure 6-16). The Print dialog box contains con-
trols at the top that enable you to select the printer to use and the size of the
paper. The Layout section of the Print window gives you the following printing
options:
 One Photo per Page to print each of the selected photos on a separate
sheet of paper
 Multiple Photos per Page to choose between a wide variety of layouts
using different readily-available paper, card, and label stock for printing
more than one photo per page
 As a Contact Sheet to print all the selected photos sequentially as
thumbnails along with their filenames for easy identification
Figure 6-16:

PhotoSuite.
199
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

After you select one of these three basic Layout options, the Layout section
of the Print window gives you different sizing options based on the type
of layout you’ve chosen. When you select the One Photo per Page Layout
printing option, PhotoSuite gives you a choice among three different sizing
options:
 Resize to Fit (the default) to reduce photos to the size required for them
to print within the margins for the specified paper size
 Crop to Fill to crop the photos as required for them to fill the page and
still print within the margins for the specified paper size
 Stretch to Fit to stretch the photos as required for them to fill the page
and still print within the margins for the specified paper size
When specifying the photo layout for the Multiple Photos per Page printing
option, PhotoSuite lets you decide between printing the same photo as many
times on the same page as your selected photo size allows (with the default
Fill Each Page with Same Photo option button) and printing each of the selected
photos only once per page with the Repeat Each Photo option button. Note
that when you select the Repeat Each Photo option button, the Times text
box (with 1 as the default value) becomes available. If you want to have each
of the multiple photos that you’ve selected printed a set number of times
(using as many pages as the photo size and layout require), you enter that
number in this text box.
When specifying the photo layout for the As a Contact Sheet printing option,
PhotoSuite lets you specify the number of columns and rows (with 4 columns
in 5 rows being the default) and the spacing between them. You can also choose
not to print the filenames beneath each thumbnail by clicking the Print Titles
check box to remove its checkmark.
After specifying your print settings, be sure that you’ve loaded your printer
with the right type of paper and that the printer is ready to go before you click
the Print button at the bottom of the Print window to begin. During the brief
moments that PhotoSuite takes to send your photo(s) to the printer, you can
click the OK button in the Cancel dialog box if you decide to stop the printing.
After PhotoSuite finishes printing your photo(s), click the Close button in the
Print window to return to the PhotoSuite 8 window.
The Print dialog box opened from within PhotoSuite allows you to print only
one photo at a time so that even if you select the Multiple Photos Per Page or
As a Contact Sheet Layout option, you only get multiple printouts of the same
photo on each page. If you want to print more than one photo on a single
200
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

page or a bunch of different photos as a contact sheet, you need to open a
slightly different version of the Print dialog box by clicking the Print Photos
link on the Photo tab of the Project List pane in the Roxio Creator 8 Home
window.
To add all the photos you want, click the Add Photos button (the one with an
album icon at the top of the pane on the right that says No Photos Selected)
and select them in the Add Photos dialog box. After adding your photos, click
the Multiple Photos Per Page button and the Repeat Each Photo option button
once you’ve selected the proper paper size and orientation. To print the photos
you’ve added as a contact sheet, simply click the As a Contact Sheet option
button instead.
E-mailing Your Photos
PhotoSuite also makes it easy to e-mail your edited photos to friends and
family. All you have to do is follow these steps:
1. Click the E-mail button (the one with envelope) on the Canvas pane’s
toolbar.
PhotoSuite opens the E-mail Assistant window (shown in Figure 6-17)
containing the photo currently open in PhotoSuite’s Canvas pane. If you
want, you can select additional photos to send.

201
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

2. (Optional) Click the Add Files button and then select all the additional
photos to send in the Add Files dialog box before clicking OK.
By default, the E-mail Assistant uses your normal e-mail program (usually
Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express) and formats your photos as HTML
in the new message. 
3. (Optional) Click the Other (e.g. Yahoo!, webmail) option button if you
don’t want the E-mail Assistant to use your default e-mail program.
Note that if you select the Other (e.g. Yahoo!, webmail) option button,
the Just Send the Files with No Conversion Options button becomes
available. Click this button if you don’t want your photos to be com-
pressed using one of the JPEG compression options listed under the
Convert Photos to JPEG option.
By default, the E-mail Assistant converts your photos to JPEG graphics
files using the Medium (800) pixel compression setting. If you want you
can modify the amount of compression or select no compression.
4. (Optional) Select a new compression setting, Small (640) or Large
(1024) or, if you don’t want the photo(s) compressed at all, click the
Original Size option button.
Instead of sending your photos as individual images embedded in a new
e-mail message, you can have PhotoSuite package them into a slideshow
complete with music that is sent as a file attachment in an e-mail message.
When recipients receive the message, they can then play this slideshow
with the Windows Media Player on their computers.
5. (Optional) Click the Make a Slideshow option button to have the E-mail
Assistant group your selected photos into a WMV slideshow file that is
attached to a new e-mail message in your e-mail program.
When you finish selecting the photos and the various e-mail options, you
are ready to open a new message in your e-mail program.
6. Click OK in the E-mail Assistant window.
The Assistant then opens a new message in your e-mail program. If you
selected the Make Slideshow option, the slideshow file appears as an
attachment to the new message. If you did not select this option, all the
photos selected in the E-mail Assistant appear in the body of the new
e-mail message.
7. Indicate the recipient(s) for the message, the subject of the message,
and any explanatory text to its body before you click the Send button
in your e-mail program to send the attached slideshow file or the
embedded photos.
After your e-mail program closes, you are automatically returned to the
PhotoSuite 8 window where you can continue working.

Chapter 7
Burning Audio CDs, MP3, and 
DVD Music Discs
In This Chapter
 Creating and burning a new Audio CD project
 Creating a MP3/WMA Disc project
 Creating a DVD Music Disc project
 Creating an Enhanced CD with audio and data
 Creating a Mixed-Mode CD with audio and data
T
he Music Disc Creator application makes it easy for you to compile your
favorite tunes and burn them onto CDs for playing on standalone audio CD
players (such as the one in your car and the Walkman-variety you listen to at
the gym) as well as on the CD-ROM drive in your computer. The audio CDs that
you burn can be composed of music tracks that you’ve downloaded and pur-
chased from online music stores such as Napster or Rhapsody, recorded from
analog recordings (such as LPs and audio cassettes) with the Sound Editor
(see Chapter 5), or ones that you rip from audio CDs that you already own.
As you find out in this chapter, with the Music Disc Creator you can create
not only standard audio CDs but MP3/WMA discs, DVD Music Discs, Enhanced
CDs, and Mixed-mode CDs as well. MP3/WMA discs are audio CDs whose
tracks are saved in the MP3 (MPEG3) or WMA (Windows Media Audio) com-
pressed file formats. These file format enables you to fit many more tracks on
the CD than is possible on a standard CD-R disc (hundreds of tracks in MP3
versus about 20 maximum in the CD-R’s normal WAVE format, which aren’t
compressed at all). Besides being able to play the MP3/WMA discs that you
burn in the Music Disc Creator application of the Roxio Creator 8 suite on
your computer’s CD-ROM drive, however, you can only play MP3/WMA discs
on standalone players that support either the MP3 or WMA file format.
Fortunately, many of today’s audio CD players, including the ever-popular
Walkman-type, support the MP3 file format and newer players support WMA
as well so that this limitation may be no problem at all.

DVD Music Discs are audio DVDs that contain 4.7 or 8.5 gigabits worth of
tunes (and that’s a lot of tracks!) that you can then play on standalone DVD
players or with the DVD player in your computer. Because of the enormous
size of DVD discs, you can use DVD music discs to quickly back up your
entire CD collection (no matter how many CDs you happen to own).
Enhanced and Mixed-mode CDs are CDs that mix computer data and audio
files together. Enhanced CDs are multi-session CDs with the first session con-
taining the audio tracks that can be played by any standard audio CD player
and CD-ROM drive and the second session containing the data files that can
be played only on the computer’s CD-ROM drive. Mixed-mode CDs are also
CDs that mix computer data and audio files. However, unlike the Enhanced
CD which separates music tracks from data files in separate sessions, the
Mixed-mode CD contains only one session with both the data and music (the
data is laid down in the first track of the CD and all the audio tracks follow).
This means that a Mixed-mode CD can only be played by your computer’s
CD-ROM drive (regular audio CD players like the one in your car can’t play
this kind of CD at all).
Creating an Audio CD Project
Music Disc Creator is the Roxio Creator 8 suite application that you use for
compiling and burning all your audio CDs. To launch Music Disc Creator from
the Roxio Creator 8 Home window, click the Music Disc Creator link in the
Applications Project Window after clicking Applications on the Home tab of
the Project List.
When you first launch the program, the Music Disc Creator window with a
new untitled Audio Project shown in Figure 7-1 appears. This window con-
tains three panes: Project Type and Add to Project in the Task pane on the
left and the Audio CD pane that shows the project name along with the discs
and tracks added to it.
Adding audio tracks to your project
After starting a new Audio CD project, you are ready to start adding tracks to
it. These tracks can those saved on your computer’s hard disk or ones on
audio CDs that you own. When adding your tracks to the Audio CD project,
you follow these simple steps:
1. To add audio files saved somewhere on your computer, click the Add
Audio Tracks link in the Add to Project pane. To rip tracks from an
audio CD or DVD and add them to the project, click the Import from
CD/DVD link instead. To record your own audio files and add them to
the project, click the Record Audio link.
208
Part I: A Bit about Media Creator 8 and Digital Media 

If you click the Add Audio Tracks link, the Media Selector dialog box
shown in Figure 7-2 appears. Here, you select the media containing the
audio files you want to add to the project:
• If you’ve already copied the tracks you want to add to your com-
puter’s hard disk, these tracks are probably located in the My
Music folder on your computer.
• If the audio files are stored in Smart Views or albums (see Chapter
4) on your computer, select the view or album after clicking the
Smart Views or My Albums button.
• If you’re copying tracks from an audio CD in your computer’s
CD-ROM drive, select that drive’s letter to display the tracks.
If you select tracks on a commercially produced CD in your computer’s
CD-ROM drive in the Media Selector after clicking the Import from
CD/DVD link, Music Disc Creator attempts to obtain the track names and
other album information of the CD it contains from the online Gracenote
CD database. When this information is found, the track numbers and the
names of the individual tracks appear in the list box on the right side of
the Media Selector.
If you click the Record Audio link, the Record Audio dialog box appears
where you can record your new audio file (see Chapter 5 for details).

2. Select the names of the audio files and track(s) you want to add in the
Media Selector and then click the Add button.
The Adding to Project dialog box appears. If you are ripping tracks from
a CD, the Save Audio Tracks to File dialog box appears where you need
to select the type of audio file format to use in Output Settings drop-
down list box and use the Browse button to select the location in which
to save the tracks in the Save To list box. After designating these set-
tings and clicking the Save button in the Save Audio Tracks to File dialog
box, the Copying Track dialog box appears displaying the progress of
the ripping process plus an Audio alert dialog box for each track you rip
indicating the filename of the track and its location by means of its path
name. 
After the new recording or track ripping is complete or you click the 
Add button in the Media Selector after selecting all the audio files saved
on your computer you wanted added, the Adding to Project dialog box
replaces the Copying Track dialog box. This dialog box displays the over-
all progress of adding each of ripped or selected tracks to the new Audio

CD project, and it too displays an Audio alert dialog box for each track
with its file and path name. When the tracks have all been added to your
Audio CD project, you are returned to the Media Selector dialog box.
If you try to add a track that you’ve downloaded to your computer’s hard
disk for playback but for which you don’t have permission to copy by burn-
ing to disc, the Error alert dialog box appears. If this Error dialog box appears
for a track that you’ve downloaded from an online music store without actu-
ally purchasing, you can rectify this situation by going back to the store and
buying the track. When you purchase a music track from most online music
centers such as Napster or Rhapsody, you obtain both the play and burn
rights to the song (although the burn rights may not enable you to make
unlimited copies — you need to check this with the particular store).
3. After you finish adding tracks to your new Audio CD project, click the
Close button in the Media Selector dialog box.
Music Disc Creator adds an icon for each disc needed to accommodate
the number of tracks you added to the project. These icon(s) have generic
numbered names (Disc 1, Disc 2, and so on) which you can change. To the
right of the disc icon(s) you see the names of all the selected tracks that
will be burned onto it. Their names appear in the Title column in this part
of the Audio CD Project pane along with their total estimated playing time
in the Duration column. To the right of the Duration column, you find a
Fade and to the right of that a Transition column where you can assign a
fade-in and fade-out effect as well as designate a gap or overlap transition.
At the bottom of the Music Disc Creator window appears the relative track
size and the estimated amount of total free playing time still left on the
disc selected in the project.
If you find that you’ve added a track that you don’t really want to
include on the final CD, click the track and then press the Delete key or
click the Remove button on the Audio CD Project pane’s toolbar.
If you want, you can add descriptive names to the Discs listed in your
Audio Project.
4. (Optional) Click the icon for the disc you want to rename and then
press F2 (or right-click it and then select Rename on its shortcut
menu).
You can adjust how a particular track fades in and/or fades out. To add a
fade-in effect, click the Fade In button (the one with the upper-left
corner bracket) in the Fade column of that track and then click one of
the options on its pop-up palette as identified in Figure 7-3.
211
Chapter 7: Burning Audio CDs, MP3, and DVD Music Discs

To add a fade-out effect, click the Fade Out button (the one with the
upper-right corner bracket) in the Fade column of that track and then
click one of the options on the pop-up palette as identified in Figure 7-4.
5. (Optional) In the Fade column of the Track list, select the fade-in
and/or fade-out effect you want to assign on the option pop-up menu
opened by clicking its Fade In or Fade Out button. To assign the same
fade-in or fade-out effect to several tracks, select the tracks prior to
clicking these buttons.
You can add a transition between tracks, choosing a gap transition that
creates a silence between two tracks or an overlapping transition that
starts playing the first part of the next track before the current track is
finished playing. You can then set the duration for either of these types
of transition effects. 
By default, the Music Disc Creator selects a gap of 0.0 seconds (in 
other words, one track leads directly to another). To set a gap between
tracks, you enter the number of seconds for that gap in the Transition
(In Seconds) column to the immediate right of the Transition icon. To set
an overlap, you click the Transition button and then click the Overlap
button on the pop-up menu (the second one at the bottom of the pop-up
menu that shows one tracking extending into another) before you set its
duration.

6. (Optional) Select the track beneath the one you want to set a transi-
tion for and then replace 0.0 with the number of seconds in the
Transition (In Seconds) column to the right of the Transition icon. If
you want the tracks to overlap rather than a silence, click the
Transition button and then click the Overlap button on its pop-up
menu before setting its duration.
You can also edit a track after adding it to your Audio CD project in the
Quick Sound Editor. This is a mini-version of the Sound Editor applica-
tion (see Chapter 5) that enables you to trim the length of the audio, add
fade-in and fade-out effects to it, and to enhance it with some of the
more commonly used special effects.
7. (Optional) To edit a track by trimming or assigning different effects to
its audio in the Quick Sound Editor, click the track to select it and
then click the Edit Audio button on the toolbar above the track list.
When you finish editing the track, click the Done button to return to
the Music Disc Creator.
Now it’s time to save the Audio CD project before you burn it to disc.
8. Choose File➪Save Project on the Music Disc Creator menu bar and
then enter the filename and select the location for the .dmsa file
(Music Disc Creator Project File) before you click the Save button.
Tagging the tracks in the project
If the disc information including the album title, artist’s name, and track titles
for a particular audio CD doesn’t show up in the Track list of the Music Disc
Creator window after adding the tracks, you can try to have this information
located and downloaded from the online Gracenote CDDB (CD Database).
The Gracenote CDDB is the world’s largest online database of music informa-
tion (listing about two and a half million CDs with just a little over 55 million
songs!).
To get the vital statistics on the tracks, follow these steps:
1. Select all the tracks you want information on in the Track list and
then click the Edit Audio Tags button on the toolbar at the top of the
list.
Music Disc Creator opens an Edit Audio Tags dialog box album similar to
the one shown in Figure 7-5.
2. Click the Music ID button near the bottom of Audio Tags pane in the
Edit Audio Tags dialog box.
Music Disc Creator then connects you to the Internet and the Gracenote
CDDB to look for the CD’s ISRC (International Standard Code) number in
this humongous database. When it finds a match to a track’s IRSC number
in the Gracenote CDDB, it then downloads the information and replaces
213
Chapter 7: Burning Audio CDs, MP3, and DVD Music Discs

the To Be Done indicators in the MusicID Status column of the Select
One or More Tracks pane on the left side of the Edit Audio Tags 
dialog box.
Sometimes, multiple matches are found for a track in which case, you
need to click the Multiple Matches link and then select the information
you want to use.
3. Click the Use MusicID Tags check box to use the information returned
from the database in your project.
In addition to using the information in your audio project, you can also
have save the track information with the audio file, if the particular
audio file format used by the track supports this option.
4. (Optional) Click the Embed or Replace Tags Inside the Audio Files 
(If Supported by the Audio Format).
5. Click the Done button to close the Edit Audio Tags dialog box and
return to the Music Disc Creator window.
A music track’s ISRC number serves as the recording’s international identifier
for the purposes of rights management. In other words, an ISRC number indi-
cates who’s entitled to the royalty payments for the distribution of that record-
ing. If you’re making a CD of your own music for distribution to various record
companies and radio stations, you will definitely want to obtain ISRC numbers
from an approved ISRC Agency and encode the tracks of the CD you’re burning
with Creator Classic for any type of distribution with those numbers.

Rearranging tracks
When you add individual tracks from various sources that you copied on
your computer’s hard disk to your Audio CD Project (as opposed to a block
of audio tracks from a single source such as a CD in your CD or DVD drive),
Music Disc Creator automatically lists these tracks alphabetically by track
title in the Project pane. You will not, however, always want to burn your
audio CD with its tracks in this type of alphabetical order. More often than
not, you’ll end up arranging the tracks in the order in which you think you’d
most prefer to listen to them (regardless of what havoc that inflicts on the
alphabetical track name order).
To modify the track order prior to burning the final audio CD, you need to
drag the tracks in the Audio CD project to their desired positions. To do this,
click the track that you want to move to select it and then drag up or down 
to reposition it. As you drag, a dashed line appears right above the mouse
pointer indicating where the track you’re moving will be inserted when you
release mouse button. Once you’ve positioned this dashed line in between
the tracks in the Project pane where you want it to appear, release the mouse
button to move the selected track to that new position in the list. As soon as
you release the mouse button, Music Disc Creator renumbers all the tracks to
suit the new track order. 
Although it is a little tedious to have to reposition each track in this manner,
it is the only method that Music Disc Creator supports for rearranging the
tracks you add so that they don’t appear in alphabetical order by track name
on the new CD.
Renaming tracks
Music Disc Creator enables you to rename the tracks that you add to your
audio CD project. You might need to do this when Gracenote can’t return the
correct track name or when you’re dealing with tracks that aren’t registered
with this database (as in the case of original music).
To rename one of the tracks, click its name in the Track list in the Audio CD
Project pane and press F2 (you can also do this by right-clicking the track
name and then clicking the Rename item on the track’s shortcut menu).
Music Disc Creator then selects the track name within a text box waiting for
you to make your changes to the name. To replace the name entirely, just
start typing the new track name.
215
Chapter 7: Burning Audio CDs, MP3, and DVD Music Discs

To edit the track name by inserting text, you can just click the Insertion point
at the place in the track name where you need to start inserting characters.
To delete just some of the characters in the name, drag through them with
the arrowhead mouse pointer to select them and then press the Delete key.
When you finish editing or replacing the track name, press the Enter key or
click the mouse anywhere outside of the of the track name’s text box.
Inserting a disc break
Music Disc Creator automatically adds a new disc to the audio project when
the combined size of the tracks you’ve added exceeds the total capacity of
the CD disc media currently selected in the Disc Size drop-down list at the
bottom of the Music Disc Creator window.
You can, if you want, ensure that certain tracks in the project are burned to
the same disc by inserting a custom disc break. To do this, select the track in
the Track list above which the disc break is to occur and then choose
Edit➪Insert/Remove Custom Disc Break on the Music Disc Creator menu bar.
Music Disc Creator then inserts a new numbered disc icon in the Project
pane along with a disc break that is clearly marked as a custom disc break in
the Track list. You can then rename the new disc by clicking its icon and then
pressing F2.
To move a custom disc break, drag its indicator in the Track list up or down
as required. To remove a custom disc break, right-click it in the Track list and
then press the Delete key or click Remove Custom Disc Break from its short-
cut menu.
Changing the Project Settings
Prior to burning the tracks that you’ve added to the Track List in the Audio
CD Project pane, you can check and, if necessary, change the properties for
the CD project. To do this, you open the Project Properties dialog box shown
in Figure 7-6 by clicking the Project Settings button on the Audio CD Project
pane’s toolbar, or by pressing Crl+R. A Project Properties dialog box appears.
The Audio CD Properties dialog box contains a Disc Name and Artist Name
text box where you can modify the name of the Disc currently selected in the
audio project. It also contains an Add CD-Text check box (selected by default).
When this box is checked, Music Disc Creator saves the artist, album name,
and track names on your hard disk after burning the CD so that the next time
you put the disc into your computer’s CD or DVD drive to play it, these vital
statistics will be available to the program you use to play the disc (such as the
Windows Media Player or iTunes).
216
Part I: A Bit about Media Creator 8 and Digital Media 

Below the Add CD-Text box, you find a Maximize Volume of Each Track (Will
Require Extra Time to Output) check box (which is not automatically selected).
Click this check box when you’ve added audio tracks from different sources
and want to have Music Disc Creator maximize their volume at the time that
the tracks are burned onto the CD.
Beneath these two check boxes, a UPC text box appears where you can enter
the CD’s 12-digit Universal Product Code if you’ve obtained one for your CD
or are copying a CD and happen to know it.
Burning the CD
After you’ve added all the tracks you want to your audio CD project and
made any necessary adjustments to the tracks, including merging, audio tran-
sitions, track ISRC information, project settings, and the like, you’re ready to
burn the CD. Prior to starting the burn process, you should make sure that
you’ve saved all your changes in the .dmsa project file (Ctrl+S or choose
File➪Save Project).
To burn the audio project to CD, you then click the Burn button on the far
right side of the Audio CD Project pane’s toolbar or choose File➪Burn on the
Music Disc Creator menu bar. Music Disc Creator then opens the Audio CD –
Burn Setup dialog box. To expand the dialog box so that it displays all of your
options for burning the CD, you need to click the expand button (+) in front
of Burn Options at the bottom of the dialog box. The expanded form of the
Burn Setup dialog box contains two sections: General Options (already fully
displayed) and Advanced Options which you can display by clicking its
expand button (see Chapter 3 for details on using these options).
After making changes to any of these options in the Burn Setup dialog box,
click the OK button to open the Audio CD – Progress Information dialog box.
This dialog box shows its progress in writing the tracks to the new audio CD. 
Figure 7-6:

217
Chapter 7: Burning Audio CDs, MP3, and DVD Music Discs

After Music Disc Creator finishes writing the tracks to the last CD disc
required for all the tracks in the project, the program automatically ejects the
disc. To have the Audio CD – Progress Information dialog box automatically
close when this process is complete, click the Close This Dialog Box When
Finished Successfully check box. To launch the Label Creator application for
creating a custom label for your new audio CD after its recording is com-
pleted, click the Create a Label (see Chapter 9 for details).
If you don’t want to make a label for your new audio CD after all the tracks
are burned onto it and Music Disc Creator ejects the disc, simply click the
Close button to close the Audio CD – Progress Information dialog box and
return to the Music Disc Creator window.
Creating an MP3/WMA Disc Project
If you have a standalone or portable CD or DVD player capable of playing
audio files saved in the MP3 (MPEG3) or WMA (Windows Media Audio),
instead of using Music Disc Creator to start an audio CD Project for burning
standard audio CDs, you can start an MP3/WMA Disc project and burn an MP3
audio disc. The benefit of creating an MP3 audio disc instead of a standard CD
is clear: because MP3/WMA discs are composed only of audio files saved in
the MP3 or WMA compressed file formats, you can fit many, many more song
tracks on your average MP3 or WMA disc than you ever can on a standard
audio CD composed of tracks saved in the uncompressed WAVE file formats.
To start a new MP3/WMA Disc Project from the Music Disc Creator window,
click the MP3/WMA Disc link in the Project Type pane. Music Disc Creator
then starts a new untitled MP3/WMA Disc Project that contains a default
disc/MP3 player icon called Untitled (see Figure 7-7).
After starting a new MP3/WMA Disc Project, you can edit the name of the
disc/MP3 player icon. Either click the icon in the Folder Navigation Tree in
the MP3/WMA Disc Project pane and then press F2 before you replace
Untitled and press Enter or click the Project Settings button on the toolbar
and then enter a new name in the Disc Name text box before you click OK.
218
Part I: A Bit about Media Creator 8 and Digital Media 
What’s up with WMA?
The WMA (Windows Media Audio) file format is
Microsoft’s response to the MP3 file format. Like
MP3s, WMA files are compressed and are per-
fect for streaming audio from the Internet. In
addition, Microsoft’s audio format restricts the
copying of copyright-protected songs for which
you do not possess the proper digital rights. This
may be one of the reasons that WMA has found
favor over MP3 with many professional music-
and movie-producing companies.

Adding audio files to a new MP3/WMA Disc Project is essentially the same
process as adding tracks to an Audio CD Project: Click the Add Audio Tracks
link in the Add to Project pane when you want to add audio files saved on
your computer, click the Import from CD/DVD link when you want to rip
tracks from other audio CD or DVD discs, and click the Record Audio link
when you want to record new audio for the disc.
The big difference is that instead of just adding individual songs as you do
with an Audio CD Project, you can add entire folders of audio files to the disc.
To add a folder along with all its files, simply click the Folder tab in the Media
Selector dialog box and then click the icon of the folder that you want to add
before clicking the Add button.
Keep in mind that MP3/WMA Disc projects will accept any type of audio file
that you care to add to the project. This is because, by default, the Project
Settings for any new MP3/WMA Disc project are set to automatically convert all
audio formats using the MP3 (Good Quality) setting. If you want to convert the
files in your MP3/WMA Disc project using another setting, open the MP3/WMA
Disc Project Settings dialog box by clicking the Project Settings button on the
toolbar and then selecting the format and quality you want used in the Convert
All To drop-down list box before clicking OK. To convert the audio files to WMA
to play in a standalone player that reads this file format, you need to select
either the WMA (Good Quality) or WMA (Low Quality) settings on this drop-
down list.

219
Chapter 7: Burning Audio CDs, MP3, and DVD Music Discs

Note that when adding individual audio files to the MP3/WMA Disc Project
pane, you can create a new folder in which to add them. To create a new
folder in the MP3/WMA Disc Project pane, click the disc/MP3 player icon or
folder icon in the Navigation Tree in which you want the new folder and then
click the New Folder button above it on the toolbar. Music Disc Creator adds
a new folder named Untitled which you can then rename by typing in the new
name and then pressing Enter. You can then add audio files to the new folder
by clicking its icon in the Navigation Tree before you click one of the Add to
Project links. To move audio files that you’ve already added to the MP3/WMA
Disc project, drag them from the Track list and then drop them on top of the
new folder icon in the Navigation tree.
Keep in mind that many simple MP3 disc players can’t play tracks that you
put into folders. When in doubt, keep all the tracks in the MP3 project in the
root directory under Untitled and don’t add them to folders beneath this root
level.
As you add MP3 files to your MP3 disc project, Music Disc Creator displays
their order in Track list. Before burning the MP3/WMA disc, you can change
the order of its folders or of the tracks with the folders. To move a folder 
up or down on the disc, drag its folder icon to the desired position in the
Navigation tree. To move a track up or down in its folder, drag its track to the
new position.
You can use the controls in the Playlist Editor to arrange the order in which
the MP3 normally plays in the final MP3 disc you burn. If you want a truly
random order for the songs, simply click the Random button. If you want to
manually determine where a particular song appears in the playlist, you can
either drag its filename up or down the list or click the song filename and
then click the Promote button (the one with triangle pointing upward) or
Demote button (the one with the triangle pointing downward) to move the
song up or down to the desired position.
After adding all the audio files that you want (or can fit) onto a new CD and
arranging them in the order in which you want them to normally play, you’re
ready to burn the CD. To do this, you click the Burn button on the right side
of the MP3/WMA Disc Project pane’s toolbar (see “Burning the CD” earlier in
this chapter for details on the process of burning a new CD).
Creating a DVD Music Disc
A DVD Music Disc is special kind of DVD that contains tons of audio files that
are arranged in menus or tracklists. You can play DVD Music Discs on a DVD
set-top player or on your computer using a software program such as Windows
Media Player.
220
Part I: A Bit about Media Creator 8 and Digital Media 

The main difference between DVD Music Discs and other types of audio discs
you create with Music Disc Creator is not only that they accommodate so many
more tracks — remember we’re talking about 4.7GB or 8.5GB (with the new
DVD discs) of space as opposed to 740MB) — but also that you can create
menus or playlists that enable you to quickly and easily select the music you
want to listen to on the disc. In addition, because DVDs are also visual players,
you can display track screens while a track is playing: this track screen can be
an image you want displayed or album information.
DVD Music Discs support three types of menus:
 Top menu that is displayed when you play the DVD disc. The top menu
can include the following buttons:
• Play All to play all the tracks in order starting with the first track
in the Track list
• Track Lists with a link to Track List menus (see below) that arrange
the tracks in groups of 10 (according to the order in which the
tracks are added to the project) as well as alphabetically from 
A to Z
• Smart Menus with a list of all the Smart Menus used in the disc
(see the upcoming bullet on Smart Menus)
 Track List menus that contain a list of all the tracks or links to other
track lists are created as you add tracks or that you set up yourself
 Smart Menus that are created automatically as you add tracks to your
DVD Music Disc project using the audio tag information associated with
each track
Music Disc Creator imposes a limit of 99 menus total in the project. If you
exceed this limit, you will not be able to burn the DVD Music Disc. Should
this ever happen, you will have to remove Track List menus or deselect some
of the Smart Menus criteria until you are within this limit.
Creating a new Music DVD Disc project
To create a new DVD Music Disc project, click the DVD Music Disc link in the
Project Type pane of the Music Disc Creator window. Music Disc Creator then
opens a new untitled DVD Music Disc in the project pane on the right, while
at the same time adding a DVD Music Disc pane below the regular Project
Type and Add to Project panes on the left. Immediately below the DVD Music
Disc pane, you see a thumbnail of the main or top menu of the disc (see
Figure 7-8).
221
Chapter 7: Burning Audio CDs, MP3, and DVD Music Discs

You can display a larger (and somewhat more legible) version of the main
menu screen at the bottom of the DVD Music Disc project pane immediately
beneath the Track List by clicking the faint button centered immediately
above the playback controls with a triangle pointing upward at the bottom of
this pane. When you click this button, the main menu screen preview disap-
pears from the Task pane and appears instead at least twice as large in the
lower half of the project pane. To hide this larger preview of the main menu
screen and restore the Track List, click the button centered at the top of this
main menu screen image with a downward pointing triangle.
The Navigation pane of a Music DVD Disc project contains an icon at the top
representing the disc (and given the temporary name, Untitled) followed by a
section with the Track Lists and below that, Smart Menus.
The process for adding music tracks to a DVD Music Disc is the same as when
creating Audio CD or MP3/WMA Disc projects. Click the Add Audio Tracks link
in the Add to Project pane to add audio files already saved on your computer
system. Click the Import from CD/DVD to rip tracks from discs you put on your
computer’s CD/DVD drive. Click the Record Audio link to record new audio for
the project (see “Adding audio tracks to your project” earlier in the chapter for
details).
To name the Untitled DVD disc, click the Project Settings button on the Project
pane toolbar and then enter a new name in the Disc Name before you click OK.
Note that you can click the Auto-play (Starts Playing the First Track When Disc

Is Inserted) check box to put a check mark in it in this dialog box to have the
first tune automatically play as soon as the standalone DVD player starts read-
ing the disc (and before anyone can make a menu selection).
You can also select a new background style for the main or top menu of your
Music DVD Disc project. Click the Styles link in the DVD Music Disc pane and
then click the thumbnail of the style you want to use. If you want all the sub-
menus and track screens on the disc to match the style you selected for the
main menu screen, click the Apply to Menus and Track Screens Below check
box before you click OK in the Styles dialog box.
Working with track lists
When you first start a new DVD Music Disc project, the Music Disc Creator
adds a single Untitled track list (which is automatically selected). This Untitled
track list displays all the tracks in order as you added them to the project,
although you can modify this order easily by clicking the column heading at
the top of the list to sort the list alphabetically or numerically (in the case of
the Order and Duration columns). The first time you click the column heading,
Music Disc Creator sorts the tracks in ascending order (A to Z and smaller to
larger). The second time you click the column heading, the program sorts the
tracks in descending order (Z to A and larger to smaller).
To name this original track list, press F2 while it’s still selected in the Navigation
pane (indicated by the highlighting of its name) and then replace Untitled with
a name of your own before pressing Enter.
If you want to add your own track lists under the original Untitled (parent)
track list automatically created by Music Disc Creator, click the New Track
List button on the toolbar at the top of the DVD Music Disc project pane. The
program then adds another numbered Untitled track list (as in Untitled 2,
Untitled 3, and so on) as a subordinate list (indicated by its indentation in the
Navigation tree).
You rename these new untitled track lists by typing your own descriptive
names and pressing Enter. To add tracks that you want to appear in them,
click the main track list icon (the original Untitled track list) to display all
your tracks, and then sort them if necessary to put like tracks together (by
Title or Artist). Select all the tracks you want to appear in the new track list
you created and then drag them to the track list in the Navigation tree (as
shown in Figure 7-9). 
You can end up completely emptying the parent track list if you create subor-
dinate track lists for all the different kinds of music tracks and then add the
related tracks to these lists.
223
Chapter 7: Burning Audio CDs, MP3, and DVD Music Discs

After adding all your tracks to the subordinate track lists you want on the
Music DVD Disc, you can arrange the tracks within their respective lists. To
do this, click the track list icon in the Navigation pane to display all its tracks
in the Track List. You can then sort the tracks in ascending or descending on
a column (Order, Title, Artist, or Duration) by clicking its headings at the top
of the Track List (once for ascending and twice for descending).
You can also have Music Disc Creator automatically arrange the tracks in a
particular track list into subordinate lists using the smart tag information
associated with them. To do this, right-click the name of the track list and
then position the mouse over Arrange By on the shortcut menu before you
click one of the following options on the Arrange By submenu:
 All Tracks to create subordinate track lists with groups of 10 tracks
(0-10, 11-20, 21-30, and so on)
 Tracks (A-Z) to create subordinate tracks lists for each letter of the
alphabet (A, B, C, D, and so forth)
 Artist to create subordinate tracks lists with the names of all the identi-
fied artists in alphabetical order
 Album to create subordinate tracks lists with the names of all the identi-
fied albums in alphabetical order
 Genre to create subordinate tracks lists with the names of all the identi-
fied music genres in alphabetical order
 Years to create subordinate tracks lists with the years of all the identi-
fied release years in numerical order

Working with Smart Menus
Smart Menus use the information in the audio tags identified for each track
(see “Tagging the tracks in the project” earlier in this chapter for details) to
group the music tracks that you add to the DVD Music Disc project into sub-
menus that you can access from the main or top menu screen.
When you start a new DVD Music Disc project, Music Disc Creator adds two
Smart Menus, Tracks (A-Z) and Artist (indicated by the check marks in front of
their respective icons). This means that in addition to a Track Lists link (that
takes you to a screen with links to all the track lists you add to the project as
described in the preceding section), the main menu screen contains a Tracks
(A-Z) link (that takes you to a screen with alphabetical links, A through Z, that
lead to screens whose titles begin with that letter) and an Artist link (that
takes you screens with links to the various artists on the DVD arranged in
alphabetical order).
If you want to add other Smart Menus to the project, simply click the check
box in front of their name:
 All Tracks to create menus and associated screen for groups of ten
tracks on the DVD
 Album to create menus and associated screens for each album identi-
fied in the tracks on the DVD
 Genre to create menus and associated screens for each music genre
identified in the tracks on the DVD
 Years to create menus and associated screens for each release year
identified in the tracks on the DVD
When using Smart Menus, you can easily modify how the tracks are grouped
on the various submenus and associated screens. Right-click the name of 
the Smart Menu whose grouping you want to change and then click Smart
Menu Options on the shortcut menu. Doing this opens the associated 
Smart Menu Options dialog box where you can modify the track order 
by selecting new options in the three Order By drop-down list boxes in 
conjunction with the related Ascending or Descending option buttons.
For example, you could use this dialog box to customize the Years Smart
Menu by ordering it first by Year released in Descending order (from most
recent to least recent), then by Album Name, and then by Artist, both in
Ascending order.
To remove a Smart Menu from the project (thereby removing all links and
associated screens), simply click the check box in front of a selected Smart
Menu name to remove its check mark.
225
Chapter 7: Burning Audio CDs, MP3, and DVD Music Discs

Customizing the menus and track screens
Smart Menu options are not the only things you can customize in your Music
DVD Disc project. You can also customize its menu and track screens. To cus-
tomize the screens for a Smart Menu or track list add to your project, you
need to right-click its icon in the Navigation pane and then Smart Objects at
the bottom of its shortcut menu.
Music Disc Creator opens a Smart Objects dialog box similar to the one in
Figure 7-10. You then can select from the drop-down list whether to apply the
changes to the Smart Objects options to just the currently selected menu or
track screen only (This Menu), to the menus and track screens below it as
well (This Menu and Below or Track Screens Below), or to all the menus or
track screens in the project (All Menus, All Track Screens, or All Menus and
Track Screens).
After designating which menu(s) and track screens to customize, you can
then select a new background color and/or background image. When you
click the Color button, a color palette appears where you can click a prede-
fined color or define custom colors of your own. When you click the Image
button, a Media Selector dialog box appears where you can select the photo
or graphics file to use (be sure that the image you select is not so dark as to
obscure the text on its menu or screen).
When you select an image, Music Disc Creator automatically selects the Fit to
Screen (Stretch Image) setting so that the graphic image fills the entire screen.
If you find that the image is distorted, select the Fit to Screen (Keep Aspect
Figure 7-10:

Ratio) option in the drop-down list box underneath the Image button. If your
image is smaller than the screen, you can select among these other sizing
options on the drop-down list:
 Center (100% Scale) to center the image in the center of the screen at
actual size
 Fill Screen (Keep Aspect Ratio) to enlarge the image so it fills the screen
while retaining the original aspect ratio to keep it from being distorted
 Tile to fill the screen by replicating the image as required
Note that if you select the Center (100% Scale) and assign a background
color, this color will appear in the areas of the screen not filled by the image.
In addition to customizing the background color and image, you can also
remove the options listed in the Navigation area of the Smart Objects dialog
box to remove certain items from the designated menus and/or track lists
(the particular options listed in this area vary depending upon what areas
you’ve selected for customization in the drop-down list box at the top of the
dialog box). To remove the display of a particular screen item, click its check
box in the list to remove its check mark.
Previewing and burning a Music DVD Disc
As you build your Music Disc Creator project, you can use Preview Disc
button on the DVD Music Disc pane’s toolbar to test out the menus and pre-
view the display of its various screens. When you click this button, a Preview
DVD Music Disc window opens with simulated DVD controls on the left side
and the preview of the currently selected menu or track screen displayed on
the right (see Figure 7-11).
Figure 7-11:

Chapter 7: Burning Audio CDs, MP3, and DVD Music Discs

To display the main menu screen, click the Top Menu button in the DVD
Controls area. Then click the up and down buttons (the ones with the trian-
gles pointing upward and downward) on the virtual controller to simulate
selecting the various menu items and buttons on each screen (the text of the
selected menu item or onscreen button appears in red). To follow a selected
menu link, click the OK button in the center of the simulated DVD controls.
To play a track listed on one of the track list or Smart Menus, select it by click-
ing the up and down buttons on the virtual controller and then click OK. The
track screen appears in the preview area for the music track you selected. To
simulate returning to the top menu after exploring the projects various menu
and track screens, use the virtual controller to select the Menu option at the
bottom of the screen and then click OK.
Click the Fullscreen button below the virtual controller and playback controls
make the preview area full screen as it would be when playing the disc on a
standalone DVD player. Just keep in mind that when previewing the project
full screen, you no longer have access to the virtual DVD controller. To select
and activate menu items and buttons in full-screen mode, you must click them
with the mouse. When you finish previewing the project in full-screen mode,
press the Esc button to redisplay the regular Preview DVD Music Disc window.
When you are finished previewing the DVD Music Disc, click the Close button
in the Preview DVD Music Disc window to close it and return to the Music
Disc Creator window. When you are satisfied that your project has all the
tracks on the DVD arranged as you want them, save the project by choosing
File➪Save Project on the Music Disc Creator menu bar and then insert a
blank DVD in your DVD burner drive and click the Burn button at the very
end of the toolbar to burn your new DVD disc (see “Burning the CD” earlier in
this chapter for details on the burning process).
Creating an Enhanced CD
An Enhanced CD is a type of multi-session CD that combines data and audio
together. The first session on the CD contains audio tracks (such as you add
to a standard Audio CD Project — see “Creating an Audio CD Project” earlier
in this chapter for details). The second session contains the data file such as
you might add to a standard Data Disc Project in Creator Classic — see
Chapter 3 for details.
When you play an Enhanced CD disc in a standalone CD player (such as the
one in your car or a Walkman-type portable unit), the player plays the music
session so that you can listen to its music tracks as you would any other
audio CD. When, however, you play an Enhanced CD disc in your computer’s
CD-ROM or DVD drive, you cannot only play its music tracks with a software
program such as the Windows Media Player, but you also have access to its
data portion with the appropriate software program.
228
Part I: A Bit about Media Creator 8 and Digital Media 

Enhanced CDs are a perfect solution when you’ve created an MTV-type music
video that you want to package along with a bunch of music tracks. You can
then add the music tracks to the first audio session and the music video file
to the second data session of the Enhanced CD Project and then burn them
together on a CD disc for distribution to friends, family, and, yes, that MTV
producer who’s about to discover you.
To start a new Enhanced CD Project, open the Roxio CD Extra Disc Creator 
by clicking the CD Extra Disc Creator link in the Roxio Creator Application
window (opened by clicking the Creator Classic link on the Data tab of the
Project List pane in the in the Roxio Creator 8 Home window) Then, when the
Roxio CD Extra Disc Creator window opens, click the Enhanced CD link at the
top of the Projects pane.
CD Extra Disc Creator opens a new untitled Enhanced CD Project in the pro-
ject pane area. The Navigation tree in Enhanced CD Project pane contains
two icons: an Audio Project icon and a Data Disc icon (indicated by the
numeric volume name) appear immediately below the Enhanced CD icon in
the Navigation Tree. You add your audio tracks to the Audio Project portion
of this tree (see “Adding audio tracks to your project” earlier in this chapter)
and you then add your folders and data files to the Data Disc portion of the
tree below (see Chapter 3).
After you finish adding your music tracks and data files to your Enhanced CD
Project, you can save the project with the File➪Save command and then burn
the CD by clicking the Burn button on the Enhanced CD Project pane’s tool-
bar (see “Burning the CD” earlier in this chapter for details on the burn
process).
Creating a Mixed-Mode CD
Like an Enhanced CD, a Mixed-mode CD also combines data files and music
tracks on the same CD disc. Unlike the Enhanced CD, however, the Mixed-
mode CD records both the computer data and music tracks in a single ses-
sion and therefore can only be played back in your computer’s CD or DVD
drive using the appropriate software such as the Windows Media Player.
Mixed-mode CDs are typically used to create multimedia projects for learn-
ing or entertainment (game) purposes that you can enjoy exclusively on the
computer.
To start a new Mixed-Mode CD Project, launch Roxio CD Extra Disc Creator,
as described in the preceding section; then click the click the Mixed-Mode CD
link in the Advanced Projects area. The program then opens a new untitled
Mixed-Mode CD Project in the project pane. The Navigation tree in the Mixed-
Mode CD Project pane contains two icons: a Data Disc icon (indicated by the
numeric volume name) and an Audio Project icon appear immediately below
the Mixed-Mode CD icon in the Navigation Tree. You add your folders and
229
Chapter 7: Burning Audio CDs, MP3, and DVD Music Discs

data files to the Data Disc portion of the tree (see Chapter 3) and then add
your audio tracks to the Audio Project portion below (see “Adding audio
tracks to your project” earlier in this chapter).
After you finish adding your data files and your music tracks to your Mixed-
Mode CD Project, you can save the project with the File➪Save command and
then burn the CD by clicking the Burn button on the Mixed-Mode CD Project
pane’s toolbar (see “Burning the CD” earlier in this chapter for details on the
burn process).

Creating Disc Labels 
and Case Inserts
In This Chapter
 Getting comfortable with the Roxio Label Creator window
 Using Express Labeler to quickly and easily create your disc label and inserts
 Editing the image, graphic, and text objects in your label project
 Printing disc labels and case inserts
 Applying adhesive labels properly so you don’t ruin your discs
T
he Roxio Label Creator program in the Roxio Creator 8 Suite makes it a
snap to create professional-looking disc labels, covers, booklet inserts,
and jewel case inserts for the audio CDs, MP3/WMA discs, and DVD discs that
you burn with various Roxio Creator programs including Drag-to-Disc, Disc
Copier, Creator Classic, Music Disc Creator, and MyDVD. And for you serious
CD/DVD producers, it also works with LightScribe recorders that burn labels
directly onto discs.
As you find out in this chapter, Roxio Label Creator makes the job of creating
disc labels so easy through the combination of its predefined layouts and
styles, Smart Objects, and Auto-Fill features that automate the filling in of vital
information on the contents of your disc. This contents information can come
either directly from the Gracenote CDDB in the case of audio CDs or from the
Creator Classic, Music Disc Creator, and MyDVD projects (see Chapters 3, 7, 8,
and 12), which you use in burning the discs in the case of both audio CDs and
Music DVDs and video CDs and DVD discs.
This chapter also covers how Roxio Label Creator can make short work of
designing CD and DVD case covers, booklet inserts, and jewel case inserts.
When designing these types of case inserts, you can make use the Smart
Objects and Auto-Fill features you use to fill in disc label content as well as
apply the same or new graphic themes. Finally, you find out how to print the
labels and case inserts you create with Roxio Label Creator and how to prop-
erly apply the labels you print to the CD and DVD discs you burn.

Getting Familiar with the Roxio Label
Creator Window
You can launch the Roxio Label Creator tool from Roxio Creator 8 Home
window by clicking the Label Creator link in the Applications Projects
Window after selecting Applications on the Home tab of the Project List.
Figure 8-1 shows the Roxio Label Creator window that then opens. As you can
see in this figure, this window is made up of the follow areas:
 The Add Object pane contains tools for adding existing images, prede-
fined shapes, drawing lines, adding text, and scanning new images for
the layout you’re editing.
 The Edit Layout pane contains options for applying a style for all the
layouts in your label project, selecting new Smart Objects to include in
the project, adding track list and other disc information from an existing
disc, and selecting a new background for the project.

Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

 The Layout pane contains a toolbar with a print button along with vari-
ous zoom and alignment buttons and a preview of the label or insert cur-
rently selected for editing.
 The Layout Navigator pane (on the right side immediately below the
Layout pane) shows which one of the layouts (label and insert) in your
label project is selected (with a rectangle around its thumbnail) and con-
tains a Select More Styles button that opens the Show/Hide Objects
dialog box where you can select which layouts to include in the project.
The Add Object pane
The Add Object pane (shown in Figure 8-1) contains the seven tools that you
can use when you need to add images to or draw specific shapes in the disc
labels or case inserts in the label you’re creating. Roxio Label Creator recog-
nizes three different types of objects that you can add to and manipulate in
the labels and case inserts you’re designing:
 Image objects, which are graphics or photo images stored in separate
files that you can bring into the label project
 Graphic objects, which are rectangular or oval shapes or straight lines
that you can size and place in the label project
 Text objects, which are blocks of text inside text boxes that you can size
and position on the label project
The Add Object pane contains the following links for adding image, graphic,
or text objects to your label project:
 Add an Image to open the Add dialog box where you can select the
Smart View, album, folder, or MediaSpace containing the graphic or
photo image you want to add to the layout you’re editing
 Add Picture Index to open the Picture Index Properties dialog box
where you can assemble a grid of tiny thumbnails of pictures that is so
many rows wide by so many columns long as a graphic object for use in
the layout you’re editing
 Add Rectangle to add a new rectangular graphic object to the layout
you’re editing
 Add Circle to add a new circular graphic object to the layout you’re
editing
 Add Line to add a straight line as a new graphic object to the layout
you’re editing 
233

 Add Text to add a text object to the layout you’re editing where you can
enter text that you want to appear on the label or insert
 Scan Image link to launch the Roxio Media Import application (see
Chapter 9), where you can use your scanner to scan in a new image 
for the layout you’re editing (if you get an error message when you 
click the Scan Image link, choose File➪Select Scanner on the Roxio 
Label Creator menu bar and make sure that your scanner is selected 
in the Select Source dialog box before you click this link again)
The Edit Layout pane
As you can see in Figure 8-1, the Edit Layout pane consists of the following
links that you can click to perform common tasks for designing your disc
labels and case inserts:
 Select Style to open the Select Style dialog box where you can select the
type of layout including background, object placement, and typestyle to
use the label project you’re creating
 Show/Hide Smart Objects to display and hide the Select/Edit Content
dialog box where you can select the type of label project (Audio, Data,
or Video) as well as select what type of information (such as Title, Track
List, Disc Type, and so on) to include on the disc label on case inserts in
the label project
 Auto-Fill from Disc to add the name of the album, artist, and track list
for the CD that you’re burning or you have inserted into your com-
puter’s CD-ROM or DVD drive
 Edit Background to open the Background Properties dialog box where
you can select an image or a color to use for the background of the label
or case inserts you’re currently designing in Roxio Label Creator
The Layout toolbar
The Layout toolbar at the top of the Layout pane contains a whole cartload of
useful stacking and alignment tools (see Figure 8-2) that you can use to con-
trol which image, graphic, or text objects are front and which are behind the
others as well as how selected objects are aligned on the disc label or case
insert layout you’re editing. The controls on this toolbar include:
 Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons to zoom in or out on the displayed
layout by selecting one of the predefined zoom percentages (50%, 75%,
100%, 150%, or 200%)

placement of the information on the label and inserts, and font to use.
 Edit Content: Click the Edit Content button to open the Smart Object
Editor dialog box where you select what smart object information to
include on the label and inserts in the label project and edit the actual
contents of the selected smart objects by clicking them.
 Auto-Fill from Disc: Click the Auto-Fill from Disc button to have Express
Labeler fill in the title, artist, and track list information (provided that
their smart objects are selected) on the label and inserts from the audio
CD or DVD that you have inserted into your computer’s CD/DVD drive.
If the layout you’re using for the disc label contains a disc type icon, you can
select the proper icon in the Smart Object Editor dialog box by clicking the
Disc Type Icon Smart Object in the list on the left side. Doing this displays a
list box on the right side of the dialog box with every conceivable disc type
(from cDVD Video to VCD Video RW).
If you selected more than one layout check box in the initial Express Labeler
window, you can select any of those layouts in the Layout Navigation pane at
the bottom of the Customize Express Labeler window. You can then modify
the style for that particular layout or edit a particular Smart Object that the
layout uses.

When you finish editing the elements for the different layouts in your label
project in the second, Customize, window of Express Labeler, click the Next>
button to proceed to the third and final, Complete the Project window (see
Figure 8-7). Here, you have a choice between three actions before finishing
the project and closing the Express Labeler:
 Print to open the Print dialog box where you select the printer, paper,
and other settings before sending the project to be printed
 Save to open the Save As Project dialog box where you can save the pro-
ject as a .jwl project file so that you can reuse it if you later make more
copies of the same CD or DVD disc 
 Edit in Label Creator to close the Express Labeler and open the project
up in Roxio Label Creator for further refinement and editing
After saving and/or printing the label project, click the Finish button to close
the Express Labeler (this happens automatically if you click the Edit in Label
Creator button).
Editing Elements of the Label Project
Many times even after editing the contents of the layouts you select in the
second, Customize, window of the Express Labeler, you will still want to make
some modifications to the layouts of the disc label and case inserts in Roxio

Label Creator. To open the project for further editing in Roxio Label Creator,
you click the Edit in Label Creator button in the third, Complete the Project
window in Express Labeler. 
When the label project is loaded into Roxio Label Creator, you can select the
layout to edit in the Navigation pane (clicking its thumbnail) and then use the
buttons that appear on the toolbars at the top of the Layout pane to make
changes to particular objects.
Editing the text objects in your layouts
When you click a text object box in one of your layouts, the text-related but-
tons appear on the Object Properties toolbar (see Figure 8-4). Most of its
tools are the standard ones you’re probably familiar with from using them in
your word processing program. For example, you use the Font drop-down list
box to select a new font for the selected text objects and the Font Size drop-
down list box to select a new font size. So too, you click the Bold Text button
to add or remove the boldface enhancement in the selected text objects, the
Italicize Text button to add or remove italics, the Underline Text to add or
remove underlining, and the Shadow Text to add or remove the shadow text
enhancement (note that you can only apply the shadow enhancement to cer-
tain fonts).
The Change Text Color button enables you to select a new color for the text
in the text objects you’ve selected by clicking its color square in the Select
Color dialog box that appears when you click the button (you can also create
new colors for the text by clicking its Create Colors button and then using the
Eyedropper tool, the Hue and/or Shades mixing boxes, or by entering new
Red, Green, and Blue values or new Hue, Saturation, and Value percentages).
You can use the Left Align Text, Center Text, and Right Align Text buttons to
modify the text alignment within the text boxes of the selected text objects.
Note that Center Text option is the default for all new text objects and that
Roxio Label Creator automatically adjusts the text using whatever alignment
option you select when you modify the size and shape of text object’s text
box.
The only two buttons that are definitely not standard in word processing pro-
grams are the Straighten Text and Curve Text buttons. These buttons are
great, however, when editing the layout for your disc labels. Because of the
round nature of disc labels, it often makes sense to put text like the album
and artist’s name on a curve rather than on a straight line. 
To curve a particular text object in the Disc Label Layout, click the text
object or objects (Ctrl+Click to select more than one) and then click the
Curve Text button. After curving the text box of a particular text object, you
can then rotate that text box around the disc label (Label Creator will modify
242
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

the text to suit the new orientation on the disc). If you decide that a particu-
lar text object doesn’t look so hot on the curve, you can convert it back to a
standard text box with straight text by clicking the Straighten Text button.
When it comes to the text objects that contain track lists (automatically gen-
erated by clicking the Auto-Fill from Disc button in the Express Labeler or by
choosing Tools➪Auto-Fill Smart Objects from Disc on the Roxio Label Creator
menu bar), Label Creator automatically left-aligns their text in their text
boxes. Further, in the layout of the disc label the program also automatically
indents the list to fit the curve of the label (both the curve of the inside hole
and that of the outer diameter) when you position this list on the left or right
side of the disc label.
Figure 8-8 shows my edited disc label after making modifications to all of its
text objects. In this example, I used the Curve Text button to put both the
album and artist name on the bias at the top of the label (I also used the Bold
button to boldface their text and the Font drop-down list box to change the
font from Neuropol to Arial). For the text object containing the track list, I
manually resized its text box after clicking the Flow Text button and selecting
Arial Narrow in the Font drop-down list and reducing the font from 9 to 7
points by selecting 7 in the Font Size drop-down list. Then I dragged this text
object to its final position on the right side of the label, making sure that all of
the track list information was now displayed.

Chapter 8: Creating Disc Labels and Case Inserts

Remember that instead of having to manually resize each text box to suit a
font or font size change, you can have Roxio Label Creator automatically do
this for you by clicking the Size to Text button on the Layout toolbar (see
Figure 8-2).
Editing the image and graphic 
objects in your layouts
When editing the layouts for the disc label and case inserts in your label pro-
ject, you may well have to edit their image and graphic objects. Remember
that image objects contain any graphics files that you add to the layouts,
whereas graphic objects are composed of the rectangles, circular shapes, and
straight lines that you insert with the Add Rectangle, Add Circle, and Add
Line links on the Add Object pane.
When you click an image or graphic object in the layout, Roxio Label Creator
indicates that it is selected by placing sizing handles around the perimeter of
the object. You can then drag these sizing handles to make the selected
image or graphic object larger or smaller.
To reposition the image or graphic object that you’ve selected, position the
mouse pointer in the middle of the selected image or graphic and then use
the hand pointer to drag the object to the desired position in the current
layout.
The sizing and moving of line graphic objects present a little different story
from all the rest. To select a line graphic for resizing, click one of its two ends
to add a gray resizing handle. Then position the arrowhead mouse pointer
over that sizing handle and drag the mouse (the pointer then becomes a
hand) until the line is longer or shorter (you can also rotate the line around
the opposite, unselected end which remains stationary).
To reposition a line graphic, drag the mouse to draw a bounding box around
the line to select both ends. One end of the line then displays a gray sizing
handle, while the other end displays a white repositioning handle. You posi-
tion the arrowhead mouse pointer over the white repositioning handle and
then drag the mouse (the pointer then becomes a hand) to move the entire
line graphic object to the desired position in the current layout.
You can also delete and cut or copy a selected image or graphic object to the
Windows Clipboard. To delete the object, press the Delete key. To cut the
image (for later pasting in other layout), press Ctrl+X. To copy the object
instead, press Ctrl+C. To paste the object you’ve cut or copied to the
244
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

Clipboard in a new part of the layout (or another layout that you’ve selected
by clicking its tab button on the top row of the Roxio Label Creator window,
press Ctrl+V.
Keep in mind when editing the images and graphics in a particular layout that
you can also select a new background image or color to use in that layout by
clicking the Edit Background link in the Edit Layout pane. Label Creator then
opens the Background Properties dialog box with the current background
object selected (any color or image you select in this dialog box overrides
any background graphic supplied to the current layout by the style you’ve
applied to the entire label project). 
To add a new background color, click the color in the color palette or click the
More Colors button and create a custom color in the Select Color dialog box.
To add a new background image instead, make sure that Use the Following
Image as Background Image check box is selected and then click the Browse
or Scan button. When you click Browse, Label Creator opens the Add dialog
box where you can select the graphics file with the image you want displayed
as the background of the layout you’re editing. When you click Scan, Roxio
Label Creator launches the Roxio Media Import application (see Chapter 9)
where you can scan the image to be used.
Figure 8-9 shows you my sleeve for audio CD label in the Label Creator’s
Layout pane after resizing the scanned album cover image and repositioning
the album title and artist information.

Chapter 8: Creating Disc Labels and Case Inserts

If you decide that you want to replace a particular image object in the layout,
double-click the object. Doing this causes Label Creator to open the appropri-
ate dialog box for selecting a replacement graphic.
Printing Disc Labels and Case Inserts
After you have all the layouts in your label project edited the way you want
them, you’re ready to print the project (after you saved your changes with
Ctrl+S, of course).
Because you want to use special paper in printing the different layouts in a
typical label project (high-gloss adhesive label paper for labels and matte
finish perforated paper for case inserts), you often need to change the page
settings before printing each layout in the project separately, each time
putting the right paper into your printer as well as making sure that you’ve
put the paper in the right way (some printers want the glossy side of the
label paper facing down, while others want it facing up).
Open the Page Setup dialog box by choosing File➪Page Setup on the Roxio
Label Creator menu bar (shown in Figure 8-10) where you can select the
Media to use in printing. By default, Standard Paper is selected as the media
to use. To select a different paper type besides the default Letter (8.5 x 11
inches), click the Paper Type drop-down list button and then select the type
and size of paper you’ll be using.
If you are printing on special label paper, you need to select Commercial
Paper in the Media drop-down list and then select the appropriate brand and
size in the Paper Type drop-down list box. If you are printing direct to disc
with a LightScribe recorder, you need to select Print to Disc in the Media
drop-down list box and then make sure that your brand of LightScribe is
selected in the Paper Type drop-down list box.
If you want Label Creator to print any image or text that extends into the
center of the disc label, click the Printer Center/Core Label check box before
closing the Page Setup dialog box.
Figure 8-10:

246
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

After you finish selecting the media and paper type for your label project,
you’re ready to print it. To do this, close the Page Setup dialog box by click-
ing OK and then click the Print button on the Layout toolbar or choose
File➪Print or press Ctrl+P to open the Print dialog box like the one shown in
Figure 8-11.
To check the layouts in the Print dialog box, click the thumbnail of the layout
in the Layout Navigator at the bottom and then inspect the image shown in
the Print Preview section on the right side of this dialog box.
If you find some details that need changing, modify the necessary print
options before actually sending the print job to the printer by clicking the OK
button:
 Printer drop-down list box to select a different printer installed on your
computer system to use in printing the label project
 Properties button to open the Properties dialog box for the type of
printer currently selected where you can change certain advanced set-
tings (which are entirely printer dependent) such as the paper orienta-
tion (Portrait or Landscape), the page order in printing, the paper
source, and the printer quality, among other things
 Status displays the current printing status of the printer selected in the
Printer drop-down list box

 Print Quality displays the quality (Best, Normal, or Draft) for the printer
selected in the Printer drop-down list box (to change this setting, click
the Properties button)
 Number of Copies text box to indicate the number of copies to print of
the selected layout
 Media drop-down list box to change the media (Standard Paper,
Commercial Paper, or Print to Disc) to use
 Paper Type drop-down list box to select the appropriate page size,
brand name or Light
 Print Disc Outline check box to print the outline of the disc label (when
Disc layout is selected in the Layout Navigator)
 Printer Center/Core Label check box to print any information or image
that bleeds into the center of the disc label (when Disc layout is selected
in the Layout Navigator)
 Preferences button to open the Print Preference dialog box where you
can manually adjust where the printer starts printing by changing the
OverPrint/Bleeding and Fine Tuning settings
 Calibrate button to open the Printer Calibration dialog box where you
can have Label Creator calibrate the print alignment for your printer
using test pages
 Print Test Page button to obtain a quick and dirty printout just showing
part of the outline of the disc label or case insert you’re printing; you
can then use this test page to compare with the outlines of the labels on
the actual label paper or perforations of the case inserts on the actual
insert paper to see if you need to make any adjustments to where the
printing starts before actually returning to the Print dialog box and
printing the real disc labels and case inserts
After you finish modifying the necessary print settings in the Print dialog box,
you can start the printing by clicking the OK button to send the print job to
the printer. If your printer requires manual feeding of the type of paper you
selected for printing one or more of the selected layouts, you will be
prompted to insert the paper before the printing actually begins.
Applying Labels to Discs
Applying the disc label to the actual CD or DVD disc is, perhaps, one of the
most daunting tasks that a body can perform because if you mess up and get
248
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

any wrinkles or bubbles in the label, you might as well toss the CD or DVD
disc in the trash, ‘cause it’ll never play properly (if at all).
So too, you must never, never, ever try to remove and reapply a disc label
that you’ve only got partially applied to a disc, as the adhesive in the label
will undoubtedly rip off part of the coating on the top of the disc (the one
that’s not read by the laser) and as a result the disc is dead meat and will
never play again.
In other words, the application of disc labels to your CD or DVD discs is a
one-shot deal during which you cannot afford any flub-ups (enough to make
you sweat bullets). In fact, because it’s such a delicate practice that I’ve
screwed up plenty in my time, I won’t even attempt to apply a disc label with-
out the aid of one of the those applicators which consists of a spindle for cen-
tering the disc and label and a base for holding the label (adhesive side up
and printed side down) with a spring-loaded plunger-type spindle in the
middle, with the button in the middle for pushing down the disc (with the
top, coated side facing down and the shiny, data side that you never touch
facing up) to meet and bond with the adhesive on the label. (The particular
model I favor is a sweet Italian number by Neato that has a felt pad on the
bottom of the base so it won’t slide during the crucial punch-down phase
where the top, coated side of the CD or DVD disc meets the adhesive of the
disc label.) You can also find other models by manufacturers such as DYMO
and USDM that you can use to do the same thing.

In this part . . .
I
t seems to me that the heart of the Roxio Creator 8 suite
lies in its two major applications for video productions:
VideoWave 8, which provides you with an easy-to-use but
robust video editor; and MyDVD 8, which provides you
with both an easy-to-use DVD project builder and Roxio’s
great burn engine for burning both your video and DVD
projects to disc. Part IV not only covers the complete use
of these two applications but also covers, Roxio Media
Import, a program that you’ll come to rely on heavily for
acquiring the various types of digital media you use in
your projects destined for DVD.

B
efore you can get down to making your own videos and movies with
either the Roxio Creator’s VideoWave program or MyDVD, you have to
acquire the digital media files that you need in putting together your final
multimedia productions. These media files can include video clips taken from
your digital camcorder, still images from your digital camera and scanner,
audio files recorded with your computer’s microphone or taken through a
line into your computer from an analog device like an LP record player or
audio cassette as well as audio tracks from an audio CD and, if all that’s not
enough for you, DVD movie titles that you’ve saved on your computer’s hard
disk as well.
This chapter gives you the lowdown on how to use Roxio Media Import to
acquire all these different types of digital media for your video and DVD
movie productions. You can import the media to folders on your hard disk
that you can then organize into media albums (see Chapter 4) for use when
you go on to make your multimedia productions with VideoWave (see
Chapter 11) and the MyDVD (see Chapter 12).
Using Roxio Media Import
In acquiring media for your video and DVD movie productions, you will 
come to rely heavily on the Roxio Media Import application. To launch Roxio
Media Import from the Roxio Creator 8 Home window, click the Media Import
link in Utilities column in the Applications Project Window after selecting
Applications on the Home tab. 

Roxio Media Import is also supposed to automatically launch whenever you
use Windows XP’s plug-and-play feature to an external digital device such as
a scanner, digital camera, or digital camcorder to your computer using the
cable and port appropriate to that device. Note, however, that this feature
may not work if you’ve installed another graphics or video editing program
after installing the Roxio Creator 8 suite on your computer. In such a case,
you have to manually launch Media Import after connecting the device.
The Welcome to Roxio Media Import window appears. This window contains
a Photo, Video, and Audio button that enables you to select the type of media
you’re importing. When you click one of these buttons, a Device drop-down
list box (initially called Select Device or Source to Import From) appears. This
is where you can select the actual device or disc that contains the media you
want to use (note that specific items listed on these drop-down lists vary
according to the type of media selected and the devices actually connected
to your computer).
Figure 9-1 shows the Device drop-down list box for my computer system in
the Roxio Media Import window after clicking the Photo button to import dig-
ital photos.

Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

Connecting digital devices 
to use in Media Import
Before an external device such as your scanner, digital camera, or camcorder
will appear in the Device drop-down list pane of the Media Import window,
you must have it properly installed and connected to your computer. Note
that most digital devices such as digital cameras and scanners connect to
your computer through an available USB (Universal Serial Bus) port using a
special USB cable. Others devices such as digital video cameras (also known
as camcorders) usually connect to your computer via the faster, IEEE1394
FireWire connection necessary to handle streaming video (note, however,
that some of the newer digital cameras that take video as well as still pictures
also support FireWire).
When dealing with external digital devices such as scanners and digital still
cameras, there are two standards (both of which are supported by Media
Import) for acquiring still images and streaming video: the so-called TWAIN
(as in Kipling’s “Never the twain shall meet . . .”) standard and Microsoft’s
WIA (Windows Image Acquisition) standard developed for Windows XP. In
order for Media Import to recognize your TWAIN or WIA device, you must
have installed the TWAIN or WIA device drivers on your computer (these dri-
vers are supplied on the CDs that come with your devices — if you don’t
have the CD readily available, check the manufacturer’s Web site for them).
To install the drivers for a new digital device, you may need to open the
Scanners and Cameras control panel dialog box (do this by clicking the
Control Panel item on the Windows Start menu, the Printers and Other
Hardware link in the Pick a Category area of the Control Panel dialog box, 
and then clicking Scanners and Cameras link in the Or Pick a Control Panel
Icon area of the Printers and Other Hardware dialog box). In the Scanners
and Cameras dialog box, click the Add an Imaging Device link in Imaging
Tasks pane on the left and then follow the steps in the Scanner and Camera
Installation Wizard that appears. When prompted for the name of the scanner
or camera you want to install, either select the name of the manufacturer 
and model in the Manufacturer and Model list boxes or click the Have Disk
button and then select the letter of your computer’s CD drive in the Copy
Manufacturer’s Files From drop-down list box before you click the OK button.
After Windows finishes copying the device drivers from the manufacturer’s
CD, an icon with the name of the new digital scanner or camera appears in the
Scanners and Cameras dialog box. If you close this dialog box and then launch
Media Import, the name of the scanner or camera you just installed with the
Windows Scanner and Camera Installation Wizard appears in the Device drop-
down list when you select the Photo as the type of media to import. This hap-
pens as soon as you connect the scanner or camera to your computer with
the proper USB or IEEE1394 FireWire cable and turn the device on (the name
of the device appears behind a WIA or TWAIN icon depending upon which
type of driver it uses). You can then start acquiring images from these digital
devices in Media Import after selecting them in the Device drop-down list.
255
Chapter 9: Acquiring Digital Media

Customizing the Media Import options
Before you start working with Media Import to acquire your favorite media
files, you may want to modify the default locations where the program auto-
matically saves different types of media files in the Options dialog box. To do
this, choose Tools➪Options to open the Options dialog box similar to the one
shown in Figure 9-2. As you can see in this figure, this dialog box contains two
tabs: File Locations where you can change where Media Import automatically
saves a particular media type and TWAIN Options where you can change
what method Media Import uses to transfer data from TWAIN devices.
To change any of these default folder locations on the File Locations tab,
click the type of media and its pathname in this list box and then click the
Modify button (that becomes active only after you click one of the media
types in the Temporary Working Folders list box). The Browse Location
dialog box then appears with a list box containing a Navigation Tree that
shows the selected media type’s current default folder location. Use the
Navigation Tree in this list box to select a new folder location (you can also
use the Create Folder button at the bottom of the Browse Location dialog 
box to create a new folder to use) and then click the OK button.
The TWAIN Options tab contains three option buttons, File (Recommended),
Memory, and Native, which determine how devices using the TWAIN-type dri-
vers transfer their files. The File (Recommended) option button is the default
and the Roxio people highly advocate leaving this option selected. Should
you connect a TWAIN device that can’t use the File transfer option, Media
Import is programmed to talk to the device and automatically select either

dialog box.
256
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

the Memory or Native transfer option. You would manually change to one of
these two other options only if Media Import proved unable to automatically
detect which of these two other transfer methods to use.
Acquiring Digital Photos
Most of the time, you will acquire the digital photos that you use in your 
various photo and DVD productions either from your scanner or directly
from your digital camera. You use the scanner to acquire and simultaneously
convert developed photos into digital media. Photos taken with a digital
camera, of course, require no analog-to-digital conversion and don’t have to
be acquired through Media Import (you may prefer to acquire digital photos
from your camera and save them on your computer using the software that
came with the camera or using Windows Scanner and Camera Wizard).
The next two sections cover how to use Media Import to acquire digital photos
from these two types of devices. First, you find out how to acquire photos that
you scan via Media Import and then you find out how to acquire photos when
your digital camera is connected to your computer using either a TWAIN or
WIA device driver.
Scanning images into Media Import
To scan a photo into Media Import, you follow these steps:
1. Launch Media Import and then connect the scanner to your computer
and turn it on if you haven’t already done so.
Place the photo that you want to acquire in Media Import in the proper
position on the scanner’s glass plate. If you’re using a scanner in which
you feed the sheet, get the paper ready to feed. If you’re using a hand-
held scanner, position the scanner at the top of the sheet.
2. Click the Photo button in the Welcome to Roxio Media Import
window.
3. Select the name of your scanner in the Device drop-down list box.
Media Import opens a Media Import window that contains two panes.
On the left, you find a Preview pane with the name the scanner, a pre-
view area, the capture settings, and save to location. On the right, you
see the Import Bin within the Recently Imported pane that shows all the
media you’ve imported during the current work session (this will be
empty, if this is the first time you’ve imported digital media).
257
Chapter 9: Acquiring Digital Media

4. Click the Preview Scan button to have the scanner preview the photo
you’re scanning.
After the scanner finishes previewing the image you’re scanning, its 
preview appears in the left pane. You can then adjust the scan rectangle
so that it surrounds only the photo or the part of the photo you want
scanned. To adjust the scanning area, you drag the sizing handles on 
the scan rectangle until it encloses just the area you want included (see
Figure 9-3).
5. Drag the sizing handles in the scan preview until this rectangle
encloses the area of the photo you want scanned.
You can adjust the scan quality by selecting among the Good (100 dpi),
Better (150 dpi), Best (300 dpi), and Custom options on the Capture
Settings drop-down list. When you select Custom, you can also choose
between 600 x 600 dpi (dots per inch) and 1200 x 1200 dpi, assuming
that your scanner supports these very high resolution settings. To do
this, click the Options button and select it in the Resolution drop-down
list box of the Scanner Options dialog box. Of course, the higher the
scan resolution, the more detail you get and the larger the resulting
graphics file.
Note that you can also select save the scanned image either the PNG or
BMG instead of the default JPEG graphics format. To do this, click the
Options button and then select PNG (*.png) or BMP (*.bmp, *.rle, *.dib)
from the Final File Format drop-down list in the Scanner Options dialog
box.
6. (Optional) Select the desired scan quality option in the Capture
Settings drop-down list box.
Media Import saves the scanned image in the default location desig-
nated for photos.
7. (Optional) To save the photo in a folder other than default folder for
Photo media, click the Browse Folders button (the one with the three
dots) and then select the desired destination folder using the
Navigation Tree in the Browse Location dialog box.
By default, Media Import names file that holds the scanned image by
appending a sequential number to the text, Scanned Photos, shown in
the Prefix text box as in Scanned Photos 00000.jpg, Scanned Photos
00001.jpg, and so on. If you wish, you can change this prefix text or elimi-
nate it altogether.
8. (Optional) Click Scanned Photos in the Prefix text box and replace it
with a more appropriate descriptive name or delete it altogether
before pressing Enter.
After you’ve made all your desired changes to the settings in the Media
Import window, you’re ready to have Media Import actually scan the
photo and save it on your hard drive.
258
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

9. Click the Import Now button at the bottom of the Media Import
window to scan the photo.
After Media Import finishes scanning your photo, a thumbnail of the
image appears in the Import Bin on the right side of the Roxio Media
Import dialog box (see Figure 9-3).
10. Click the Close button in the upper-right corner of the Media Import
dialog box to close it.
Copying photos directly from your camera
The procedure for capturing photos directly from a digital camera that
you’ve connected to your computer is very similar to that for capturing
scanned images. The big difference between the two procedures is the
amount of photos that you capture: normally, when you use Media Import to
copy photos from your digital camera, you import a whole bunch of photos
at one time rather than copying just a single image as when capturing from
your scanner.

Chapter 9: Acquiring Digital Media

The general steps for copying the photos on your digital camera onto your
hard disk are as follows:
1. Launch Media Import and then connect the digital camera to your
computer and turn it on if you haven’t already done so.
Note that connecting your camera may cause the Windows XP Photo
Wizard or some other photo editing software that came with your
camera to automatically start up. If that happens, click the program’s
close box to return to the Media Import program.
2. Click the Photo button in the Welcome to Roxio Media Import
window.
3. Select the name of your camera in the Device drop-down list box.
Media Import opens a window which contains two panes: a pane with a
list of the photos currently on your camera’s memory card on the left
and an empty Import Bin within the Recently Captured pane on the
right.
Depending on the make of your camera, the left pane may contain more
than one folder from which you can import files (this is especially true
in the case of digital cameras that take video as well as still images). By
default, all the thumbnails in this folder are selected for importing.
4. Select the folder in the pane on the left that contains the images you
want to import. If you don’t want all the images in a folder, click
somewhere outside the thumbnails and then Ctrl+click the thumbnails
of the images you do want to copy.
By default, Media Import saves all the selected files to default location
for Photo media on your computer’s hard disk. You can change this loca-
tion if need be.
5. (Optional) To save the photos in a folder other than the default folder
for Photo media, click the Browse Location button (the one with the
three dots) and then select the desired destination folder using the
Navigation Tree in the Browse Location dialog box.
By default, Media Import renames all the photos your camera (which them-
selves use non-descriptive sequentially numbered temporary names)
by prefacing the numeric part of the filename with the text, Imported
Photos, shown in the Prefix text box. You can modify this prefix text
used in renaming the imported photo files or eliminate it altogether.
6. (Optional) Click Imported Photos in the Prefix text box and replace it
with another modifier to use in renaming the photos or delete it
entirely before pressing Enter.
You may burn the photos you’re importing to a new CD or DVD disc as
well (or instead of) copying them to your computer’s hard disk.
260
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

7. (Optional) Click the Burn to Disc check box to have Media Import
burn the photos you’re importing to a CD or DVD disc at the same
time it copies them to your hard disk. If you want Media Import to
only burn the photos on a CD or DVD, click the Hard Drive check box
to remove its check mark.
You may want to have Media Import remove the selected photos from
the camera after copying them to your hard disk.
8. (Optional) Click the Delete Photos from Device After Transfer check
box if you want Media Import to remove the selected photos from the
camera’s storage after it copies them onto your hard disk.
Now you’re ready to have Media Import import the selected photos to
the destination folder that you’ve specified.
9. Click the Import Now button at the bottom of the Roxio Media Import
dialog box to import the selected photos.
As Media Import transfers the selected photos from your camera,
thumbnails of their images appear in the Import Bin on the right side of
the Roxio Media Import dialog box (see Figure 9-4).
10. Click the Close button in the upper-right corner of the Media Import
dialog box to close it.

Chapter 9: Acquiring Digital Media

Acquiring Digital Video
Media Import is perhaps most useful when you use it to capture digital video
that you’ve taken with your DV (digital video) camera (also known affection-
ately as a camcorder). Note that although you will mostly use capture to
import video clips from footage that you’ve already taken, you can also use
Media Import to capture live video taken with your camcorder (which, of
course, must remain connected to your computer throughout the shoot) or
with a Web camera.
When importing previously recorded video clips from your DV camera, you
can choose between importing the video in Normal or SmartScan mode.
When you capture clips in Normal mode (the only one available when you’re
capturing live footage with your DV or Web camera), you decide which video
to capture by manually operating a Capture Now and Stop button. When you
capture clips with SmartScan Media Import, Media Import scans the entire
video tape, using the time-code information stored on the tape to automati-
cally divide it into discrete scenes which you can then import.
Figure 9-5 shows the type of Media Import window that appears after you
connect your camera to you computer, turn the camera on in Video mode
(sometimes abbreviated VTR) and then click the Video button and select
your DV Camera in the Device drop-down list. This DV Media Import window
contains a Capture preview pane where you can see the video footage that
you’re capturing on the left side. On the right, you see the Import Bin within
the Recently Imported pane that shows all the media you’ve imported during
the current work session (this will be empty, if this is the first time you’ve
imported digital media).
Modifying the capture settings
Beneath the name of your camcorder in the Preview Pane, you see the follow-
ing controls that enable you to select the Media Import settings that you now
want to use in capturing your video:
 Normal drop-down list box that enables you to choose between manu-
ally capturing the video in Normal mode with the Capture and Stop but-
tons and SmartScan to have the Media Import program scan the video
tape and divide it up into scenes that you can then import
 Quality drop-down list box that enables you to choose between the
default DV mode, which captures full-size video in the AVI uncom-
pressed file format that eats up hard disk space like nobody’s business,
and MPEG-2 mode, which captures full-size video using the MPEG-2 com-
pressed file format (which still gives you good quality video along with
smaller files sizes)
262
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

 Save Files To text box to change the location where the video clips are
saved (to change this location, click the Browse button and then select
the drive and folder in the Browse Location dialog box)
 Rename Files Prefix text box to change what text, if any, precedes the
numeric part of the filename automatically assigned to the clips gener-
ated during the capture session (Media Import automatically uses
Captured Videos as in Captured Videos 00000, Captured Videos 00001,
and so on)
 Capture Now button to start capturing video from the current frame 
in the preview area until you click the Stop button (which replaces
Capture Now)
 Capture Entire Tape button to have Media Import capture all the
footage on your current DV tape (provided that the drive designated in
the Save Files To text box has sufficient available space)
Capturing recorded video 
in SmartScan mode
When you select SmartScan on the drop-down list box immediately below the
one showing the name of your DV camera and then click the Start Scan
button that appears immediately above the Capture preview window, Media
Import scans your entire tape for scenes.
Figure 9-5:

263
Chapter 9: Acquiring Digital Media

As Media Import fast forwards through the video, scanning its time code, the
program displays thumbnails of all the scenes it locates in the SmartScan to
the immediate right of the Capture preview window (see Figure 9-6). Note
that these scene thumbnails display the first frame in the scene and are
sequentially numbered (Scene 1, Scene 2, and so on) with the timecode of the
frame (as in 0 – 00:00:00, 1 – 00:00:25, 2 – 00:00:45 and so forth).
After the scanning is complete, you need to select the scenes you want to
capture by clicking their thumbnails (hold down Ctrl as you click to select
several or press Ctrl+A to select all the scenes). 
After you’ve selected the scenes to capture and specified the capture settings
you want to use (see “Modifying the capture settings” in the section immedi-
ately preceding), you’re ready to have Media Import capture them. All you
have to do is click the Capture Now button and then sit back and wait for the
program to finishing capturing and saving the clips.
Capturing recorded video in Normal mode
Instead of having Media Import decide where the scenes are in your video
tape, you can identify the scenes yourself and determine what video you
want to import using the Normal mode. To manually capture video, make
sure that Normal mode is selected in the drop-down list box right below the
one showing the name of your video device.
Figure 9-6:
Selecting
the scenes

264
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

To capture a video clip, select all the necessary capture settings (quality,
location to save files, and filename preface as outlined in earlier in the sec-
tion, “Modifying the capture settings”) and then use the standard playback
controls beneath the Capture preview window to locate the place in the tape
where you want to begin recording the clip. Next, click the Capture Now
button to begin recording a new scene. 
When you reach the place in the tape where you want to stop the recording,
click the Stop button (which replaces the Capture Now button the moment
you click it). Note that Media Import may automatically divide your video
clip into sequentially numbered scenes starting with Scene_000000 depend-
ing on the Limit Media Import setting in effect for your video camera before
you actually click the Stop Capturing button.
If you want to record all the video on the tape, simply click the Media Import
Capture Entire Tape button. Media Import then rewinds the tape and records
all its video from beginning to end.
As soon as you click the Stop button, Media Import saves your new clip in the
selected location, giving it the automatic filename that incorporates the stock
text and the next available sequential number (such as Captured Videos
00026) and the thumbnail of the new clip appears in the Import Bin on the
right side of the Roxio Media Import window.
To playback the new clip in the Import Bin inside the Recently Imported
pane, click the Play button at the bottom of its thumbnail. To pause the video
clip playback, click the Pause button (which replaces Play). To open thumb-
nails for all the individual scenes within the clip, click the button with the
bent arrow point down point down ninety degrees to the right. Then, to
return to the clip thumbnail, click the Up One Level button on the toolbar at
the top of the Recently Imported pane.
Recording live video with 
Manual Media Import
Instead of importing video clips from the video you’ve already recorded on
tape, you can use Media Import’s Normal import mode to import live video as
you’re actually recording it. To record live video in Media Import, you have to
make sure that you switch your DV camera to Camera or Record mode rather
than Video mode before you select the DV camera in the Device drop-down
list box on the Video tab.
The Media Import Capture preview window now shows you what your video
camera’s lens is actually seeing at the time rather than a key frame recorded
on the tape. To start capturing what the camera is seeing (even if the video
265
Chapter 9: Acquiring Digital Media

camera is in standby mode), click the Capture Now button in the Media
Import window. Media Import then records what the camera sees in real time.
To get the shot you want, you can then pan the camera and use its zoom lens
to zoom in and out on objects around you. When you’re finished recording a
clip in real time, click the Stop button (which replaces the Capture Now
button as soon as you click it). 
Acquiring Audio Files
Media Import enables you not only to import images (both still and video) for
use in other Roxio Creator 8 projects but your audio as well. When using
Media Import to import audio, you have a choice between recording the
audio live, that is, capturing it in real time as the audio is playing or copying
audio tracks from a pre-recorded audio CD or DVD.
To acquire live audio, you can use your computer’s built-in microphone or
some analog audio device such as an amplifier with a record player playing
an LP or audio cassette that you connect to your computer’s line-in connec-
tion (see Chapter 5 for details).
To acquire audio tracks from a CD or DVD, you insert the disc in your com-
puter’s CD/DVD drive and then select that drive in the Device drop-down list
box on the Audio tab of the Roxio Media Import window. This audio CD can
be one that you’ve purchased or one that you’ve burned with the Music Disc
Creator program. The DVD can be a Music DVD Disc that you’ve burned with
it (see Chapter 8 for details).
Capturing live audio
To record an audio file with Media Import, connect the external analog audio
device to your computer (usually through its external microphone jack).
Turn on the analog audio device and cue up the LP record or audio cassette
you want to record. Then launch Media Import, click the Audio button, and
then select the name of your computer’s sound card on the Device drop-
down list.
Media Import then opens a Media Import window similar to the one shown 
in Figure 9-7. This window is divided into two panes: one on the left that is
almost identical to the Record Audio dialog box (see Chapter 5) where you
select the audio capture settings and start and stop the recording and an
empty Import Bin inside the Recently Imported pane on the right where 
icons for the files you record appear.
266
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

The top section of the left pane contains controls that enable you to select
the recording level, input device along with peak meters that let you monitor
the decibel levels during recording. 
In the section below you find the Capture Settings dialog box, which enables
you to select the audio file format and compression you want to use in
recording. By default, WAV (Recommended) is selected to save the new audio
file in the uncompressed WAV audio file format. You can also select these set-
tings on the Capture Settings drop-down list:
 Custom, which enables you to select the file format and compression
settings on the File Format tab of the Advanced Options dialog box
opened by clicking the Edit button
 MP3 (Good Quality) for MPEG3 at 192 Kbps
 MP3 (Low Quality) for MPEG3 at 96 Kbps
 WMA (Good Quality) for Windows Media Audio at 128 Kbps
 WMA (Low Quality) for Windows Media Audio at 64 Kbps
By default, Media Import selects the folder designated for Audio as the place
to save the audio files you record. If you want to record the files in a different
folder, click the Browse button to open the Media Selector where you select
the folder to use.
Figure 9-7:

267
Chapter 9: Acquiring Digital Media

Media Import also automatically prefixes the names of the audio files you
record with Audio followed the next available sequential number (as in
Audio_1, Audio_2, and so on). You can change this prefix by clicking the File
Name Prefix text box, editing the current name, and then pressing Enter.
After selecting the desired recording settings in the Media Import window,
you’re ready to record the live audio by following these steps:
1. If the source of the audio is an analog playback device, cue up the
track on that device.
For example, if you’re about to record a track on the audio cassette, you
need to find the silence right before the track on the tape. If you’re
recording live audio with a microphone connected to your computer,
you need to make sure that the mike is on and positioned correctly for
recording the sound.
2. Click the Record button at the bottom of the left pane in the Media
Import window.
Right after you click the Record button, you need to start the playback
of the analog recording that you’re saving. If you’re recording live audio
through a microphone, you don’t perform Step 2 until the live audio you
want to record starts playing.
3. If the source of the audio is an analog playback device, start playing
the recording that you want to capture with that device.
As soon as Media Import starts recording the live audio, the Play button
changes to Pause and the peak meters monitor the left and right decibel
levels and the Recorded Length indicator keeps you informed of how
long the you’ve been recording.
To temporarily pause the recording, click the Pause button (whose name
then becomes Continue). To resume recording, click the Continue
button (which then changes back to Pause).
To insert a track separator at the end of the recording, click the Add
Track Separator button.
4. When the audio source stops playing or you finish recording, click the
Stop button.
As soon as you click the Stop button, Media Import adds the thumbnail for
the recorded audio file using the prefix and the next available sequential
number to the Import Bin on the right. To playback this recording, clicks its
Play button.
268
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

Remember that you can edit the audio files that you record in Media Import
with Roxio Creator’s Sound Editor tool where you can use its many features
to enhance the raw audio that you’ve captured (see Chapter 5 for details).
Copying tracks from an audio CD
To copy tracks from an audio CD or Music DVD disc, insert the disc in your
computer’s CD/DVD drive and then click the Audio button in Roxio Media
Import window before you select the drive on the Device drop-down list.
Media Import then opens a Media Import window similar to the one shown in
Figure 9-8. This window is divided into two panes. On the left, you find a list
box with the disc name and the tracks on the disc above the Capture Settings
and Save To drop-down list boxes. On the right, you see the Import Bin within
the Recently Imported pane that shows all the media you’ve imported during
the current work session (this will be empty, if this is the first time you’ve
imported digital media).
After you specify the capture settings (see “Capturing live audio” immediately
preceding this section) and the location where you want the copied track(s) to
be saved, you are ready to select them in the Select Tracks list box.
Figure 9-8:

269
Chapter 9: Acquiring Digital Media

If you’re copying tracks from a CD or DVD that contains commercially-produced
music tracks but which are not currently named, you can have Media Import try
to replace the track numbers with the appropriate track names by clicking the
Lookup Disc Info button to the immediate right of the Disc Name at the top of
the Select Tracks list box. Media Import then connects to the Gracenote CDDB
Web site from which it attempts to obtain the track information. If the program
finds this information online, Media Import then replaces the track numbers in
the Select Tracks list box with their corresponding names and playing time.
If you want to listen to a particular track on the disc before selecting it for
copying in the Select Tracks list box, click its track number or name in this
list box. Then, click the Play button in the playback controls that appear at
the bottom of the Select Tracks list box (these controls only appear when
one track is selected in this list box). When you finish listening to the track,
click the square Stop button in the playback controls (which replaces the
Play button as soon as you click it).
To select only certain tracks from the list in the Select Tracks list box, hold
down the Ctrl key as you click it. To select all the tracks in the list, click the
first one at the top of the box; then drag the scroll button down and hold
down the Shift key as you click the final track.
Once you’ve selected the tracks that you want Media Import to copy to your
hard disk in the Select Tracks list box, click the Import Now button at the
bottom of the Media Import window. Media Import displays the Copying
Audio Tracks dialog box that shows you the progress of the track copying.
When Media Import finishes copying the selected tracks, this dialog box dis-
appears and thumbnails of the copied track(s) appear in the Import Bin on
the right side of the Media Import window.
Importing Movies from DVDs
If you’ve created DVD discs with the Roxio Creator’s VideoWave or MyDVD
applications, you can use Media Import to copy particular movie titles from
the disc to your computer’s hard disk (note that you can’t use Media Import
to copy movie titles from professionally recorded DVDs that you rent or pur-
chase, as these discs are copy protected).
To copy movie titles from a DVD disc that you’ve prepared, you follow these
steps:
1. Place the DVD disc that contains the movie titles you want to copy to
your hard disk in your computer’s DVD drive.
Now you’re ready to launch the Media Import tool.
270
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

2. Launch Media Import and then click the Video button before selecting
the DVD drive in the Device drop-down list.
A Media Import window appears showing a list of the movies on the DVD
disc along with Capture Settings, Save To, and Prefix controls on the left
(see Figure 9-9). On the right, you see the Import Bin within the Recently
Imported pane that shows all the media you’ve imported during the cur-
rent work session (this will be empty, if this is the first time you’ve
imported digital media).
3. Click the movies you want to copy in the list.
If a movie has chapters and you only want to copy some of its chapters,
click the Chapters expand button (the one with the downward pointing
triangle) and then Ctrl+click the chapters to use. 
If you want to play a movie from the disc, click its name in the list box
and then click the button named Play to the right of the disc name at the
top of the list box.
By default, Media Import saves the copied movies using the Standard
DivX (DivX) video file format. You can if you wish select between the
MPEG compressed video and the standard Windows Movie Video file
format.
4. (Optional) Click the Captured Settings drop-down list box and then
select a new video file format, MPEG (MPEG) or Standard WMV
(WMV), for the copied movies.
By default, Media Import saves the copied movie files in the Video folder
specified on the File Locations tab of the Options dialog box and pre-
fixes the filenames with DVDBUILDER followed by Movie and the next
available sequential number (starting with 00000).
To save your copied movie files in another location or using another file-
name prefix, follow Step 5.
5. (Optional) Make any necessary changes to the destination folder in
the Save To drop-down list box using the Browse button and edit the
filename prefix in the Prefix text box.
Now you’re ready to have Media Import copy the selected movie titles to
your hard disk.
6. Click the Import Now button at the bottom of the Media Import
window to begin copying the selected movies and chapters.
Media Imports displays the Progress Information dialog box that keeps you
informed of the progress in copying the selected movie titles. When Media
Import finishes making the copies, the dialog box closes and thumbnails of
the copied movie files appear in the Import Bin. To play a movie, click its Play
button below its thumbnail.

ideoWave is a powerful video editing program that enables you to quickly
assemble your digital video clips, audio tracks, and photo images (which
you can capture with the Roxio Media Import as described in Chapter 9) into
professional-looking finished video productions. You can then output the fin-
ished VideoWave video productions into a variety of file formats or burn the
video onto a DVD for distribution to your friends and family. You can also use
your VideoWave video productions as movie titles in the next DVD project
that you create with Roxio Creator’s MyDVD application (see Chapter 11).
This chapter covers all the major aspects of using VideoWave to create a
wide variety of video productions. It begins by familiarizing you with the fea-
tures and components of the VideoWave window, and then goes on to intro-
duce you the use of the program’s new CineMagic component, a nifty little
feature for turning your favorite video clips into instant music videos using
music of your own choice. Next, the chapter covers the use of the SlideShow
Assistant, a Wizard-like utility that enables you to whip up slideshows using
your favorite digital photos, background music, and transitions with almost
no effort at all.
If CineMagic and SlideShow Assistant aren’t enough for your video needs, 
the chapter then introduces you to the use of VideoWave’s full-featured
Production Editor. Here, you discover how to edit your videos in both the
standard storyline and the more advanced timeline view. As part of this

process, you also find out how to add audio to your video and apply any of a
variety of scene transitions and special video effects. 
The chapter concludes with information on your options for outputting your
final video productions into a variety of different formats. These include for-
mats for playback on your computer with programs like Windows Media
Player or playback on your TV or camcorder, as well as for uploading to the
Web or e-mailing to your friends and family. You also find out how to burn
your final video productions to DVD disc for playback on your computer’s
DVD drive and standalone DVD players.
Getting Cozy with VideoWave
You can launch VideoWave from the Roxio Creator 8 Home window by click-
ing the VideoWave link in the Applications Project window opened by clicking
Application on the Home tab of the Project List pane. You can also launch the
program by clicking the Edit Video link on the DVD & Video tab of the Project
List pane.
When you first launch VideoWave, a Welcome to VideoWave dialog box opens
where you can choose between starting a new video production and editing
an existing one. When you click OK in this dialog box with the Create a New
Production option button selected, a window called VideoWave 8 – Production
1 appears (see Figure 10-1). This window is divided into three panes:
 The Tasks pane in the upper left divided into Add Content and Tools
areas with the links you can use to add content and formatting to your
video production
 The Preview pane in the upper right where you can preview the video
clips, transitions, and special effects you add to your video production
 The Production Editor pane in Storyline view in the lower third of the
VideoWave 8 window where you can add and edit video clips, back-
ground audio or narration, scene transitions, and special effects for your
video production
The Preview pane
The Production Preview pane enables you to review your video at any stage
as you build and edit its content. Figures 10-2 and 10-3 show you the Preview
pane at two different times in the production: Figure 10-2 shows the pane
with the very first slide selected at the very beginning of the production
(time code 00:00:00). Figure 10-3 shows the pane when the very first video
clip is selected five seconds into the production (time code 00:05:00).

The Production Editor pane
The Production Editor pane (shown in Figures 10-4 and 10-5) is the area
where all the VideoWave designing action takes place. This is the spot where
you add and sequence the video clips, audio track, still photos and other
graphics that you want played in your finished movie production. When
designing and sequencing a movie in the Production Editor pane, you can
work in one of two modes:
 Storyline mode (the default), which presents the movie in storyboard
fashion by showing the sequence of video clips and still images that you
add to the movie in the order in which they play, along with all the scene
transitions you add to take you from one video or still image to another
(see “Working in Storyline mode” later in this chapter for details)
 Timeline mode, which presents the movie as individual video, audio,
effects, text, and overlay tracks along a time line that indicates when
particular elements on each track play in the movie (see “Working in
Timeline mode” later in this chapter for details)
Most of the time, you want to construct the basic elements for your new
movie in Storyline mode, including the video clips, still images, and the tran-
sitions you want between them. Then, if you add background audio or narra-
tion, or any text, overlays, and special effects to your production, you will
want to switch over to Timeline mode so that you can check up and adjust
their timing in relation to the movie’s video.

Instant Music Videos with CineMagic
CineMagic is a nifty feature of VideoWave 8 for creating videos that have no
other sound than the music track that you choose to play (the wizard auto-
matically suppresses the audio track recorded by your camcorder). CineMagic
automatically edits your video productions, adding transitions and trimming
your stills or video clips to suit the background music you select.
The best way to understand how easy it is to create a new music video with
CineMagic is to follow along with the steps for creating one. For this example,
I’m creating a music video using vacation video of my recent trip to India
with background music provided by Budhaditya Mukherijee’s Raga
Deshmalhar (Gat in Ektal) from his album, Magic Moments.
To begin the new CineMagic music video production, I begin by launching the
Roxio Creator 8 Home window and then clicking its Auto Edit Video with
CineMagic link on the DVD & Video tab in the Project List pane (you can also
launch it from within VideoWave by clicking New CineMagic Production link
in the Tools area of the Tasks pane). The initial, Add Content, CineMagic
Assistant window opens similar to the one shown in Figure 10-6.
To use the CineMagic Assistant to create a new video production, you then
follow these steps:
1. Click the Add Video/Photos link to open the Add Video/Photo dialog
box where you select all the video and graphics files you want in the
production before clicking the Add Video/Photo button.
When creating a video production with CineMagic, you have a choice
between having your media played in the order they appear in the Add
Content list box or randomly. If you intend to have the media played
sequentially, you may want to rearrange the video clips and photos in
this list.

Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

To rearrange media, you drag their video clip or photo thumbnails and
drop them in the desired position in the Add Content list box, keeping in
mind that the media is played from left to right across each row and as
you move down the rows. To display more thumbnails in the list box,
drag the Zoom slider to the left.
2. (Optional) If your video production is to be played sequentially, use
drag-and-drop to rearrange the media icons in the Add Content list
box so that they appear in the order (left to right and down the rows)
you want followed in the final production.
Now you’re ready to add the background music for the video produc-
tion. In doing this, you can add as many tracks (provided that you have
the digital rights to use them) as fit in the duration of the video clips and
still images.
If the audio file you select as the background music is too short for the
duration of the video portion, you can have CineMagic loop the music
until the production ends by clicking the Loop Soundtrack If Too Short
check box. 
If you add multiple tracks for the background music, you can have
CineMagic apply a crossfade effect (whereby the volume of the current
track fades as the volume of the next track comes up) with an overlap of
your choice. To do this, click the Crossfade Tracks check box and then
enter the number of seconds for the effect in the Sec. Overlap text box.

.
3. Click the Add Background Audio button, and then click the Add
Audio Track button in the Background Audio dialog box and select
the track(s) to use in the Add Audio dialog box. After you click the
Add Audio button, select the Loop Soundtrack If Too Short or the
Crossfade Tracks check boxes if applicable before you click OK.
By default, the CineMagic Assistant selects the Normal 4:3 screen aspect
ratio. If you plan to play your final video production on a really large TV
or monitor and are dealing with really panoramic images and video, you
may select the Widescreen (16:9) for your video production.
4. (Optional) Click the Normal (4:3) drop-down list box and then click
the Widescreen (16:9) option in the drop-down list to modify the
aspect ratio for the production.
5. When you finish adding and arranging the video clips and still images
for your production and assigning the background music, click the
Next> button to advance to the second, Customize, CineMagic
Assistant window.
The Customize CineMagic window (shown in Figure 10-7) is where you
select a style for your new music video. Each style uses slightly different
cuts, transitions, and backgrounds. In deciding which style to select,
click the name in the Style list box and then read the description of that
style beneath the list box. For my India video, I naturally selected the
Travel style described as being “suitable for movies which emphasize
outdoor scenes and wide open spaces.”

6. Click the name of the style of video production you want to create in
the Styles list box.
If your video production uses slides, you can set how long they remain
on screen by selecting a new value in the Set Duration of Photos in
Production text box (five seconds is the default). If you wish, you can set
the duration of the entire production by entering the number of total
seconds in the Set the Production Duration text box. If you want the pro-
duction to be timed to the running time of the background music, click
the Fit to Audio check box.
7. Set your slide and production duration values or click the Fit to Audio
check box to make the production last only as long as the background
music.
By default, the CineMagic Assistant displays the video clips and slides
you add to the production in the order they appear in the Add Content
list box. To have CineMagic randomize the order in which the media
play in the production, follow Step 8.
8. (Optional) Click the Random Order option button to randomize the
order of the media in the production.
9. Click the Next> button to advance to the third and final, Output,
CineMagic Assistant window.
The Output CineMagic Assistant window (shown in Figure 10-8) contains
options for saving the video project, burning it to CD or DVD disc, creat-
ing a movie file for playback on your computer, digital video camera, TV
or VCR, or to e-mail, or editing it further in VideoWave 8.

Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

Before you select one of the output options, you may want preview your
production.
10. (Optional) Click the Preview button to have CineMagic Assistant play
back your video and music with all its transitions and cuts in a pre-
view window.
If you click the Save This Project link, CineMagic opens a Save Slideshow
dialog box where you designate the filename and location for the DMSM
file before clicking the Save button (DMSM is the file format created and
recognized by VideoWave so that you can do further editing on it in the
VideoWave application).
If you click Burn to Disc link, the MyDVD Express program opens and
automatically adds your movie to the main menu level (see Chapter 11).
You can then modify the menu settings and burn the DVD production to
a DVD disc before returning to the CineMagic Assistant.
If you click the Create Video File link, CineMagic opens the Make Movie
dialog box where you indicate the ultimate destination of the movie as
well as its video quality before rendering it and saving it on your hard
disk. After the movie is rendered and saved, click the Done button to
return to the CineMagic Assistant.
If you click the Edit in VideoWave link, you bypass entirely Step 11 for
the CineMagic Assistant automatically closes as your video production
opens up in the VideoWave application. Once in VideoWave, you can
make any editing changes you want to the project (including enhancing
it with text, video, and overlay effects) as well as saving it as a DMSM
file, outputting it into a commonly used video format, and burning it
onto DVD disc.
11. Select the appropriate output link (Save This Project, Burn to Disc,
and/or Create a Video File) and then when you return to the
CineMagic Assistant, click the Finish button or click the Edit in
VideoWave link to open the production in this program.
Instant Slideshows with 
SlideShow Assistant
Slideshow Assistant is the fastest and easiest way to put together slideshows
from the digital images you take and edit in the Roxio PhotoSuite application
(see Chapter 6). Using the Slideshow Assistant to create your slideshow is
very much like using the CineMagic Assistant (described in detail in the pre-
ceding section). In fact, the only significant difference (other than the fact
you’re restricted to selecting photos in the first, Add Content, Slideshow
Assistant window) occurs in the second, Customize Your Slideshow,
Slideshow Assistant window where you select a transition style and whether
or not to apply a pan-and-zoom effect to your slides (see Figure 10-9).
282
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

When selecting the type of transitions to use when going from one slide to
the next in your show in the Transition Style list box, be aware that some
transitions do not support the use of the apply pan-and-zoom effect (in which
case, the Apply Pan & Zoom to All check box is grayed out). Also, some tran-
sition styles such as Vintage Album and Black & White actually change the
appearance of the photos by applying filters to them (a sepia toned filter in
the case of Vintage and black-and-white in the case of Black & White).
Your best bet when selecting a transition style with which you are unfamiliar
is to click the Preview button at the bottom of the Customize Your Slideshow
Slideshow Assistant window to see how the style affects the appearance of
your photos and the overall flow of the slideshow.
After you have the transition style, duration, and pan and zoom options
selected in the Customize Your Slideshow Slideshow Assistant window, click
the Next> button to advance to the third and final, Output, Slideshow
Assistant window. This window contains the very same Save This Project,
Burn to Disc, Create Video File, and Edit in VideoWave options as the third
and last, Output, CineMagic Assistant window (see Steps 10 and 11 in the
steps in the preceding section). 
The only difference is that when you click the Save This Project link, a Save
Slideshow dialog box appears where you can save your slideshow project in
a DMSS file format (which is one that VideoWave also knows and supports).

Video Editing in the Production Editor
As great as CineMagic and Slideshow Assistant are for quickly putting
together finished video and slideshow productions, by their very automation
of common video tasks they can put a damper on your own creativity. If you
want to be free to make your own decisions when it comes to what goes into
a particular scene, how long a scene lasts, or what transition to use when
going on to the next scene, you need to be familiar and comfortable using
VideoWave’s Production Editor.
Fortunately, Roxio has made using the Production Editor to design your own
video movies as easy as pie. Both its Storyline and Timeline modes are intu-
itive and take very little getting used to make you feel like you’re ready for
video editing with the “big boys.”
Working in Storyline mode
In the Production Editor pane in the VideoWave window, individual scenes
are represented by panels that are sequentially numbered and arranged in
rows as a kind of digital storyboarding (see Figure 10-4). Each scene panel
can contain a particular photo, video clip, or color panel that you add.
In between each scene panel, you find a transition panel that you can use to
add a particular scene transition, determining how one scene leads into the
next. VideoWave gives you a choice among hundreds of different transitions,
the most widely used one being the Dissolve transition whereby the last
frames of the current scene literally dissolve into the first frames of the next
scene (the duration of the Dissolve transition being the determining factor in
how much information from the current scene remains visible as the begin-
ning of the next scene takes over).
Note that you don’t have to add any transition between scene panels in your
video production, but keep in mind that if you don’t use add transitions, your
finished movie will have a jumpy feel to it if it contains multiple video clips
and still images. This is because the moment one scene ends, the next one
abruptly starts up. Depending on how different the visual information at the
end of one clip is from that of the beginning of the next, the effect can be jar-
ring to the eye and disrupting to the flow of your story. Therefore, I highly
recommend the use of transitions to smooth the changeover from one scene
to the next, while at the same time, I caution against using a whole bunch of
different transitions in the same movie. Be careful with your transition selec-
tions because using a variety of different transitions to make scene changes
can be almost as distracting as using none.
284
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

The Storyline Playback Head keeps your place in the Production Editor as 
you preview the video production using the playback controls at the bottom
of the Production Preview pane. As you review your video production, the
Storyline Playback Head moves through the scene and transition panels in the
Production Editor pane, keeping track of your present position in the current
video clip, still image, or transition as its images appear in the Production
Preview pane above. Note that you can’t move the Storyline Playback Head
directly in the Production Editor: to move it to a new place in this pane, you
need to use the playback controls in the Production Preview pane. For exam-
ple, to find the place in the movie where you want to start playing back the
production, you drag the Scrubber button or the Jog Wheel to advance to
frame in the video production where you want the playback to begin and then
click the Play button to start the playback from that position.
The different kinds of files you can add to your movie
Most of the movies that you’ll make with VideoWave will consist of video
clips that you’ve acquired with the Roxio Media Import application (see
Chapter 9 for details). Some of the movies you make may also include digital
still photos that you’ve acquired with the Media Import program and then
edited with the PhotoSuite application (as described in Chapter 7). 
In addition to standard video clips and still photos, you may also want to add
color panels to the first and last scenes of the movie. These color panels, usu-
ally in black, enable you to transition from a black matte screen into the first
frames of the initial video clip and then from last frames of the final video clip
to another black matt (when you use the Dissolve transition between the final
video clip and the final black matt, in Hollywood lingo, your movie is said to
fade to black).
Note that you can also add finished movies created with VideoWave and
output to the MPG file format to scene panels in a new VideoWave video pro-
duction. When you add a finished movie to a panel, VideoWave then plays
that movie (with all of its scenes, transitions, audio, and so on) as soon as the
Storyline Playback Head reaches it during playback.
Don’t forget that you can use VideoWave to make a really effective slideshow
out of your digital photos. All you have to do is add your digital photos to the
sequential scene panels in the Production Editor pane in the order you want
them to appear in the slideshow, add the type of transition you want between
each photo, and then add any background audio or narration that you want
your audience to hear. 
Table 10-1 shows a list of all the files types that you can add to your video
production. Note that the graphic file formats supported include the BMP,
JPEG, and PNG graphics file formats. Bitmap graphics are most often used for
285
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

storing simple images such as Clip Art. The JPEG graphics format is most
often used for storing digital still photos as well as more complex graphic
images. The PNG graphics file format is mostly used for Web graphics where
it’s attempting to replace the older, GIF (Graphics Information File) format.
The video and audio file formats supported by VideoWave include all the
major formats that you’re likely to run into. In terms of the video file formats,
the Easy Media Creator applications are only able to save its video produc-
tions in the MPEG2 and WMV compressed video formats. The Windows AVI
and MOV video files that you use in your VideoWave productions must be
produced in programs not part of the Easy Media Creator suite and then
imported into VideoWave.

PhotoSuite application and saved in its native file format to a new video pro-
duction. These project files carry the .dmsp filename extension. Note, how-
ever, that you cannot add VideoWave project files (that carry the .dmsm
filename extension) directly to a new VideoWave video production. Before
you can add movies that you create with VideoWave to new VideoWave video
productions, you must first output them and save them as MPG files (see
“Outputting the Video Production” later in this chapter for details).

Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

Adding color panels and text to your movie
As stated earlier, you can add black color panels to the beginning and end of
your movies and then with the help of the Dissolve transition start the video
production by fading in from black and then end it by fading to black. Because
you can add text to your color panels, you can also use them to introduce new
scenes in the movie, to create general introductions to the movie as well as to
provide the credits for production (with you, of course, as the director).
You follow these two steps to create a new color panel in your video 
production:
1. Right-click the scene panel in the Production Editor pane where the
color panel is to appear and then click Insert Color Panel on the
shortcut menu.
The More Colors dialog box appears where you select the color for the
new panel. If none of the pre-defined colors will do, click the Create
Colors >> button to expand the dialog box. Here, you can create a new
color by dragging through the Hues and Shades boxes, clicking the
Eyedropper mouse pointer on some color in the Production Preview
pane, or entering new values in the Hue, Saturation, and Values or the
Red, Green, and Blue text boxes.
2. Select the color for the new color panel in the More Colors dialog box
and then click the OK button.
VideoWave inserts a panel in the color you selected in the More Colors
dialog box in the scene panel you right-clicked. If the panel already con-
tained a video clip or still image, its media is shifted one panel to the
right to make room for the new color panel.
After inserting a color panel in your video production, you can, if you want,
add text to the panel that explains the upcoming scene in the vein of those
old silent movies or gives your audience some important information about
the video clip that they’re about to witness. To add text to a color panel you
added, you follow these steps:
1. Click the scene panel in the Production Editor pane that contains the
color panel to which you want to add your text.
VideoWave shows that this color panel is selected by surrounding its
rectangle with a non-moving marquee.
2. Click the Add Text Effect link in the Add Content pane.
VideoWave opens the Add Text Effect dialog box that displays the first of
many text samples. To narrow the samples to a particular category, click
the drop-down button on the right of the drop-down list box at the top of
dialog box and then click the category.
287
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

3. Click the text sample in the Add Text Effect dialog box that you want
to use with your own text and then click OK.
VideoWave opens an Add Text Effect dialog box. By default, the Add to
Production option button is selected, meaning that your text effect will
add to all the video and still images in the entire video production (very
useful when you need something like a copyright to appear on every
frame of the movie). However, if you only want the text effect to appear
for as long as the black matt panel is displayed, you must follow Step 4.
4. Click the Insert on Internal Text Track or Selected Panel option
button before you click OK.
After the Add Text Effect dialog box closes, you will notice that only the
color panel is selected in the video production (indicated by the fact
that all the other panels in the Production Editor are now grayed out).
Also, you will notice that the Object buttons to the right of the Playback
controls are now active and the Formatting toolbar appears in the
second row at the top of the Preview pane (see Figure 10-10).
The next step is to replace the stock text (often, Type your text here) in
the effect’s text box with the text you want to actually appear on the
color panel.
5. Click the Text Editor button on the Formatting toolbar and then edit
the stock text in the Text Editor window by replacing it with the text
you want to appear on the color panel before you click OK.
After replacing the stock text, you can use the other buttons on the
Formatting toolbar to enhance the text, including changing the font, font
size, and color as well as the bold, italic, and alignment attributes of the
text. In addition, you can assign a motion effect or change the one you
assigned by clicking the Motion button and then selecting the motion
effect from its pop-up menu.
6. (Optional) Use the buttons on the Formatting toolbar at the top of the
Preview panel to change the formatting and style of the text.
After entering and formatting the text, you can preview it by clicking the
Play button on the playback controls in the Preview pane (this is espe-
cially important when your text uses a motion effect). If you are satisfied
with text effect, move on to the last step.
7. Click the Edit Internal Tracks or Entire Production button on the
Preview pane toolbar and then save the project (Ctrl+S).
After adding a text effect to color panel, a small abc icon appears in the
lower-left corner of the color panel in the Production Editor, indicating that
the panel now has text assigned to it. You can click this icon to open the
Settings dialog box where you edit any of the text attributes, formatting, or
other settings.
288
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

You can quickly add text to any panel in the video production by selecting 
it in the Production Editor and then clicking the Add Text button on the
Preview pane’s toolbar (to the immediate right of the Edit Internal Tracks 
or Entire Production button).
If you decide that you want to get rid of the text that you’ve added to a par-
ticular photo or color panel, you can remove the text without removing the
image or color panel by right-clicking its scene panel in the Production Editor
pane and then clicking Remove➪Text Effects on its shortcut menu.

Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

If you decide that you want to delete the color panel from the video produc-
tion (along with any text that you’ve added to it), you can just click its scene
panel in the Production Editor pane to select it and then press the Delete key.
VideoWave immediately displays a VideoWave 8 alert dialog box asking you if
you want to delete the transition that follows the panel. If you click Yes in this
dialog box, VideoWave deletes the selected panel as well as the transition fol-
lowing it, pulling all the remaining panels in the production one to the left. If
you click No, the program deletes the color panel and its text replacing it
with an empty panel while at the same time leaving the transition that follows
untouched.
If you get a case of “Deleter’s angst,” you must immediately press Ctrl+Z or
choose Edit➪Undo on the VideoWave menu bar to bring the still image back.
Adding video clips and still images to your movie
The basic technique for adding video clips or still images such as scanned
graphics or photos that you’ve captured to your VideoWave video produc-
tions couldn’t be simpler: 
1. Click the panel in the Production Editor where the new panel is to be
inserted.
2. Click the Add Content link in the Add Content pane.
VideoWave opens the Insert Photos/Video dialog box.
3. Open the Smart View, album, or folder that contains the clips or
photos and then select them in the Insert Photos/Video dialog box
before you click the Open button.
VideoWave then displays the Insert Photo/Video dialog box containing
the following option buttons:
• Insert After Current Panel (default) to insert the media you
selected in the Insert Photos/Video dialog box in a new panel fol-
lowing the one that’s selected
• Insert Before Current Panel to insert the media you selected in
the Insert Photos/Video dialog box in a new panel in front of the
one that’s selected
• Insert as Overlay to overlay the media you selected in the Insert
Photos/Video dialog box on top of the media in the selected panel
(note that the overlayed media then remains visible in all the rest
of the panels in the production)
• Replace Panel to replace the media in the selected panel with the
media you selected in the Insert Photos/Video dialog box
• Insert on Internal Overlay Track of Selected Panel to overlay the
media you selected in the Insert Photos/Video dialog box on top of
the media in the selected panel only
290
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

4. Indicate where and how you want the new media inserted by select-
ing the appropriate option button in the Insert Photo/Video dialog
box and then click OK.
You can also insert a new video clip or photo into a production with the
Show Media Selector link in the Tools pane. Click this link and then select the
Smart View, album, or folder that contains the video clip or image you want
to add. After you have it open in the Media Selector, drag its icon from this
dialog box and then just drop it onto the panel in the Production Editor
where you want it inserted.
You can also play musical scene panels by rearranging the still images and
video clips that you’ve added to the Production Editor pane. Just click the
panel with the image or clip that you want to move and then drag it to and
then drop it on the panel where it should go. VideoWave will then insert the
image or clip you moved in the panel where you dropped it and adjust the
panel position of all the remaining images and clips in the production as
needed.
To duplicate an image or clip that you’ve added to the production, right-click
its panel in the Production Editor pane and then click Copy on the panel’s
shortcut menu. Then, to insert the copied image or clip, right-click the panel
in the Production Editor pane in front of which the duplicate image or clip is
to go and then click Paste on that panel’s shortcut menu. VideoWave then
inserts the copied image or clip into a new panel at the place in the produc-
tion, moving the panel you originally right-clicked and all the panels that
come after it down one.
If you want to remove an image or clip from the video production, click its
panel in the Production Editor pane and then press the Delete key or you can
right-click the panel and click the Delete item on its shortcut menu.
VideoWave deletes your photos and video clips without asking for your con-
firmation. The only way to bring them back to the production if you made a
boo-boo is to press Ctrl+Z or choose Edit➪Undo on the VideoWave menu bar
right away.
Use the Tools➪Find Panel command on the VideoWave to quickly locate and
select a particular clip or still image that you’ve added to your production.
When you select this command, VideoWave opens a Find Panel dialog box
that sequentially lists the names of all the scene and transition panels in your
production along with a short description and the scene or transition’s start-
ing and ending time. To go directly to a particular panel or transition in the
Production Editor pane, click in the Find Panel dialog box and then click the
OK button. VideoWave then closes the Find Panel dialog box and then goes to
the selected panel or transition in the Production Editor pane. VideoWave
also positions the Storyline Playback Head right in front of the panel so that
you can review the scene or transition in the Production Preview pane simply
by clicking that pane’s Play button.
291
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

Trimming your video clips
Some of the video clips that you add to a production may require some trim-
ming to make them just the right length and to ensure that clip starts and
ends on just the frames that you want included. To trim a video clip that
you’ve added to your video production, click its panel in the Production
Editor and then click the Adjust Duration button (the one with the alarm
clock) at the beginning of the toolbar on the second row of the Preview pane.
VideoWave then opens a Video Trimmer dialog box similar to the one shown
in Figure 10-11. Here, you can reset either the starting or the ending frame of
the video clip or reset both the starting and ending frames. To reset the start-
ing frame, use the playback controls under the center preview area to display
the frame where you want to clip to begin playing and then click the Mark
button under the thumbnail of the Start frame on the left side of the trimmer.
To reset the ending frame, use the playback controls to display the frame
where you want to clip to stop playing and then click the Mark button under
the thumbnail of the End frame on the right side of the Video.
To preview the trimmed clip from start to end, click the Go to Start button in
the playback controls and then click its Play button. If you’re happy with how
the clip now plays, click the OK button to close the Video Trimmer dialog box
Figure 10-11:
You can trim
the start
and/or
ending of

and return to the VideoWave window. If you’re not happy with where the clip
now starts or ends, drag the starting point (the green triangle pointing right)
or the end point (the red triangle pointing left) in the slider under the clip
preview to make any necessary adjustments. To reset the clip to its original
starting point or ending point, click the Reset button under the Start or End
thumbnail.
Keep in mind that you can adjust how long a still image remains on screen in
your production by clicking its panel and then adjusting the value (represent-
ing seconds) in the Duration text box on the toolbar on the second row of the
Preview pane.
Adjusting the quality of your video clips and still images
Not all the video clips and still images that you add to your video production
will be of the highest quality. If you need to, you can tweak the overall bright-
ness, contrast, and color balance and tint of any video clip or still image in
the Production Editor pane.
To make any of these adjustments to the video clip in your production, select
its panel in the Production Editor and then click the More Settings button to
open a Settings dialog box containing Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, Red,
Green, and Blue sliders that you can adjust before clicking its Close button.
As you adjust the values with these sliders, you can immediately see the
effect on the first frame of the selected clip in the Preview pane (VideoWave
also adjusts the values in the Brightness, Contrast, and Saturation text boxes
shown at the top of the Preview pane if you make changes to these sliders in
the Settings dialog box).
To adjust the brightness, contrast, or color saturation for a photo, click its
panel in the Production Editor and then click the Edit Photo button (the one
second from the right on the toolbar on the third row in the Preview pane).
VideoWave then opens a Preview window that contains Brightness & Contrast
and Saturation buttons (among others including AutoFix, Cropping, and Red
Eye). To display the Brightness and Contrast sliders to adjust these values,
click the Brightness & Contrast button. To display the Saturation slider to
adjust the color richness of the color, you click the Saturation button.
If your photo does not fill the entire panel, black bars will appear around the
perimeter or just on the top and bottom or left and right sides. To eliminate
these bars, click the button to display the drop-down list to the right of the
box that contains text Bars on the toolbar on the third row of the Preview
pane. Select Fill from the list. VideoWave 8 then resizes the photo so that it
fills the entire panel in the Preview pane as well as final movie (note the bars
will remain visible in the panel in the Production Editor pane even after you
select the Fill option).

Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

Automatically panning and zooming your still images
VideoWave has this really cool Auto Motion feature that you can apply to the
still images such as scanned graphics and digital photos that you add to a
new video production. When you apply the Auto Motion feature to a photo,
VideoWave gives the illusion of animating it by panning and/or zooming in or
out on the image.
To apply this feature to a still image that you’ve added to the Production Editor
pane, right-click its panel and then click the Auto Motion option on its shortcut
menu. VideoWave then applies the feature to the image and immediately posi-
tions the Storyline Playback Head immediately in front of the still image in the
video production. You can then preview actual panning and zooming applied to
your still image by then clicking the Play button in Production Preview pane. If
you don’t happen to like the Auto Motion effect that VideoWave has applied,
press Ctrl+Z or choose Edit➪Undo on the VideoWave menu bar immediately to
remove it and return it to its original completely static image.
Adding panning and zooming to still images and video clips
If you like to remain in control of any pan-and-zoom effects that you add to
your still images or would like to control the camera motion in a video clip
that you’ve added to video production, you can use VideoWave’s Pan & Zoom
Editor to do this. Click the panel with the image or video clip you want to pan
and zoom and then click Edit➪Pan & Zoom Editor on its shortcut menu (you
can also open this editor for photos by clicking the Pan & Zoom Editor
button on the third row of the toolbar in the Preview pane).
VideoWave opens the Pan & Zoom Editor window similar to the one shown in
Figure 10-12. In the upper-left corner of this window, you find option buttons
that enable you to create pan and zoom effects in three modes:
 Preset, which enables you to select a predefined pan and zoom effect
(Zoom & Pan, Zoom In, Zoom Out, Pan Only, Horizontal Pan, or Vertical
Pan) on the associated drop-down list box to its right
 Manual, which enables you to define the amount of zoom and the direc-
tion of the pan in the image or video clip by manually adjusting the size
and position of a red bounding box at the Start and/or the Finish of the
pan-and-zoom effect
 Advanced, which enables you to define the amount of zoom and the
direction of the pan in a video clip by creating keyframes by manually
adjusting the size and position of a red bounding box at keyframes you
add to the clip as well as at the Start and/or the Finish of the pan-and-
zoom effect
The trick to creating your pan-and-zoom effect in Manual or Advanced mode
is the red bounding box. To zoom in on part of an image or frame, drag the
slider below its thumbnail to the left. To start a pan from a particular part of
an image or frame, drag the bounding box so that it encloses that part.
294
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

If you are using Advanced mode to create a pan-and-zoom effect for a video
clip, use the Play/Pause or drag the Scrubber until you see a frame where the
zoom or pan should change, and then click the Add button to insert a num-
bered KeyFrame (using the next available number) in the Key Frame list box
before you adjust the size and position of the bounding box.
When you finish selecting a Preset effect or adjusting the zoom and pan for
an effect you create in Manual or Advanced mode, preview the effect in the
Preview window on the right side of the Pan & Zoom Editor window by drag-
ging the Scrubber to the beginning of the effect and then click the Play
button. When you have the effect you want, click the OK button to close the
Pan & Zoom Editor window.
Adding transitions to the scenes in your movie
VideoWave offers you a wide choice in transitions that can smooth the
changeover from one scene to the next in your movie. To add a transition
between the scene panels in the Production Editor pane, you follow these
steps in the VideoWave window:
1. Click the panel immediately following the transition (in other words,
the panel you transition to) in the Production Editor pane.
2. Click the Add Transition link in the Add Content pane.
VideoWave opens the Add Transition dialog box that displays thumb-
nails for the first few rows of its transitions as shown in Figure 10-13. To
reduce the display to only the transitions in a particular category, click
the drop-down list button to the right of All and click the desired cate-
gory (Reveals, Pushes & Slides, Page Turns, 3-D, Particles, Distort, or
Custom) in the drop-down list box.
Figure 10-12:

and-zoom

295
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

To get an idea of how the transition works, click the tiny Play button in
the lower-right corner of its thumbnail. The thumbnail demonstrates the
transition from A (in dark blue) to B (in gold) with A representing the
current scene in the panel to the immediate left of the transition panel in
the Production Editor pane where you set this transition and B repre-
senting the very next scene in the panel to the immediate right.
3. Click the thumbnail of the transition you want to use and then click
OK to close the Add Transition dialog box.
The Add Transition dialog box opens with three option buttons:
• Add/Replace Transition Before Current Panel so that the current
panel is the one transitioned to with the selected transition 
• Add/Replace Transition After Current Panel so the current panel
is the one transitioned from with the selected transition effect
• Add/Replace Transition Between All Panels in the Production to
make the selected transition effect the one used between all panels
throughout the entire video production
Because you have selected the panel that is to be transitioned to with
the new transition effect, you can just click OK to accept the
Add/Replace Transition Before Current Panel default. 
4. Click OK to close the Add Transition dialog box and insert the new
transition effect in front of the selected panel.
Figure 10-13:
To add a

296
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

VideoWave inserts the effect before the selected panel and automatically
moves the Playback head so that is positioned immediately in front of
the new transition in the Production Editor. To see how the effect works
with your media, simply click the Play button in the Preview pane.
Sometimes the transition will play so quickly that your audience doesn’t
get the full visual effect when the movie goes from one scene to the next.
If this is the case, you can lengthen the duration of the transition to slow
it down.
5. (Optional) To adjust the length of the new transition, right-click it in
its transition panel, click the Set Transition Duration option on its
shortcut menu, and then enter or select a new length (in seconds) in
the Duration text box before clicking the Set Transition Duration
dialog box’s OK button.
Instead of repeating the previous steps to individually add the same transi-
tion over and over again to the rest of the transition panels in your video pro-
duction, you can apply the first transition that you add manually to all the
other transition panels. Right-click the transition panel containing the first
transition that you added by hand and then click the Apply Transition to All
option that appears on its shortcut menu. VideoWave then displays an alert
dialog box asking you to confirm the replacement of all transitions in your
production. As soon as you click the Yes button in this dialog box, the pro-
gram adds the first transition to the all the rest of the transition panels that
occur between occupied scene panels.
If you don’t really want to use the exact same transition between every 
scene in the video production, instead of selecting the Apply Transition 
to All option on the transition panel’s shortcut menu, try using the Apply
Transition Theme option instead. When you click this option, VideoWave
opens the Apply Transition Theme dialog box where you can select among a
whole bunch of different transition themes (Dissolves, Fast Dissolves, and
Slow Dissolves just to name a few).
When you click one of these transition themes and then click the OK button
(and click the Yes button in the alert dialog box asking you to confirm the
replacement of all existing transitions in your production), the program applies
a progression of related transitions (that is, those in a similar style) to all the
rest of the transition panels between occupied scenes in the production.
Adding special effects and overlays to your movie
VideoWave offers a wide variety of special effects (that consist mostly of fil-
ters with some cutouts) and overlays (that consist mostly of cutouts and
frames) that you can apply to the video clips and still images that you’ve
added to the scene panels of your production in the Production Editor pane.
297
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

To choose a particular filtering or cutout effect for your video production,
click the Add Video Effect link in the Add Content pane. Videowave opens the
Add Video Effect dialog box displaying the thumbnails for the first few rows
of all the special effects you can choose from. To narrow the display to partic-
ular sub-categories of effects, click the drop-down button to the right of the
drop-down list box that currently contains All and then click the subcategory
to display (Colorize, Distort, Pixelate, 3-D, or Custom) on this list.
To choose a particular cutout or frame for your video production, click the
Add Overlay link in the Add Content pane. VideoWave opens the Add Overlay
dialog box displaying the thumbnails for the first few rows of all the overlays
you can choose from. To narrow the display to certain subcategories of over-
lays, click the drop-down button to the right of the drop-down list box that
currently contains All and then click the subcategory to display (Banners,
Edges, Frames, Textures, All – Widescreen, Edges – Widescreen, Frames –
Widescreen, Textures – Widescreen, or Custom) on this list.
You can add a particular effect or overlay to an individual scene panel or to
all the panels in the entire production. To add an effect or overlay to an indi-
vidual scene panel, click the panel in the Production Editor before you click
the Add Video Effect or Add Overlay link. Then after selecting the thumbnail
of the effect or overlay you want to apply to that panel in the Add Video
Effect or Add Overlay dialog box, click the Insert on Internal Effect Track of
Selected Panel or the Insert on Internal Overlay Track of Selected Panel
option button in the respective dialog boxes that follow. Of course, to apply
the selected video effect or overlay to all the panels in the entire production,
you would leave the Add to Production option button selected in these dialog
boxes before clicking OK.
You can sometimes effectively combine an effect with an overlay to lend a
definite mood to your production. For example, to give your movie a really
old feel, try combining the Sepia Low or Sepia Medium special effect with the
Vintage Photo overlay. Together, your movie seems more like something pro-
duced around the turn of the last century (that is, the early 1900s) than
something produced with twenty-first century computer software.
Removing special effects and overlays
Sometimes after reviewing the footage with a special effect or overlay that
you’ve added to a scene in the Production Preview pane, you’ll decide that
you definitely don’t want to keep it. To remove an effect from a scene panel,
right-click the panel and then click Remove➪Video Effects on the shortcut
menu. To remove an overlay, you follow the same procedure except that you
click Remove➪Overlays on the panel’s shortcut menu.
If you’ve added an effect or overlay to an entire video production and then
decide that you need to lose it fast, you need to right-click somewhere in the
Production Editor Background (that is, in the space in between the scene 
and transition panels) and then click the Remove➪Effects or the Remove➪
Overlays options on the shortcut menu.

Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

Adding audio clips to your video production
VideoWave makes it easy to add background audio to your video produc-
tions. When adding audio, you have a choice between adding a prerecorded
audio file and recording your own narration sound track for your video pro-
duction. You can even add both types of audio tracks to the same video pro-
duction if you so desire (although you have to be careful that the different
audio tracks don’t start competing with each other for the poor audience’s
limited listening attention span).
Keep in mind when adding either or both types of audio tracks to your video
production that this audio plays in the background of the movie without in
anyway canceling the audio that’s been recorded as part of the video clips
added to the production. In some cases, this will mean that your background
audio tracks will compete with the sound recorded as part of each individual
video clip. As a result, you may end up having either to turn down the volume
on the background audio tracks or on the audio that’s part of each video clip
(I give you instructions on how to adjust the volume of each kind of audio
clip later in this chapter).
Often, a prerecorded audio file can serve as a background track that sets the
mood of your movie. To add a prerecorded audio file to your entire video pro-
duction, follow these steps:
1. Click somewhere in the Production Editor window (but not on a
panel) to activate it and then click the Add Background Audio to
Production button (the one with the eighth note and the plus sign) in
the middle of Production Editor pane’s toolbar.
VideoWave opens the Select Background Audio dialog box where you
locate and select the audio file that you want played as the background
music or narration for your movie.
Note that you can only add audio files in the Select Background Audio
dialog box for which you have the Digital Management Rights. If you try
to add a file whose thumbnail has a small padlock in the lower-right
corner, when you click the Open button, VideoWave displays an alert
dialog box indicating that you don’t have the rights to the audio you
selected and fails to add the selected track to your video production.
2. Select the audio file in the folder that you want to add as the back-
ground audio in the Select Background Audio list box and then click
the Open button.
VideoWave closes the Select Background Audio dialog box and a bar repre-
senting the length of the audio clip in relation to the total running time of the
video appears immediately above the playback controls in the Preview pane
and a Speaker icon appears on the tab in the lower-left corner of the
Production Editor.
299
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

If the audio clip you add to your production is not long enough to accompany
all the video and still image, you can add more audio clips by repeating these
steps. Just be sure to click the No button in the VideoWave 8 alert box that
appears after reopening the Select Background Audio dialog box asking if you
want to replace the existing background audio (VideoWave then automati-
cally appends the new clip to the end of the first).
After adding an audio clip to your production, you can use options on the 
pop-up menu attached to the Volume button (the one with the Speaker with
sound waves coming out of it) on the second row of the toolbar in the Preview
window to add a fade-in or fade-out effect, temporarily mute, or to adjust the
volume by entering a new decibel level in the Volume (dB) text box. If your
audio clip is not long enough for the entire production and you don’t want 
to add other audio clips, click the Loop check box (to the immediate right of
Volume button in the Preview pane) to have VideoWave repeat the audio file
as needed to cover the entire production.
Recording a narration for your video production
To record narration for your video production, click the Add Narration (the
one with the old-fashioned microphone) on the Production Editor pane’s tool-
bar after activating this window. VideoWave then opens a Narration window
containing its own Preview window (like the one shown in Figure 10-14).
The great thing about recording the narration track for your video is that you
get to watch the video footage in the Production Preview pane as you actually
record the accompanying narration. This enables you to describe in words
what the audience is seeing as you watch the video footage (which is helpful
even if you’re reading from a prepared script, which is always recommended).
Figure 10-14:
Recording a

track for

creating.
300
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

Before you begin recording your narration, you may need to make the follow-
ing adjustments:
 Select the device (sound card) and input (which is most often the micro-
phone that’s built into your computer or that you’ve connected to your
computer) as well as the directory on your hard disk in which the narra-
tion audio files are saved. To do this, click the Audio Settings button and
then select the proper Device, Input, and Directory settings in the Select
Audio Device dialog box before you click OK.
 Adjust the recording volume by dragging the Level slider in the Narration
dialog box (which usually should be somewhere in the center).
 Use the Go to Start, Scrubber button, or Jog Wheel in the playback con-
trols at the bottom of the Preview pane to cue up the frame at which you
want the narration to start.
To begin recording, click the Record button and begin speaking directly into
the microphone (in a normal tone). As you speak, VideoWave will automati-
cally begin playing the movie from the current frame in the Preview pane. 
You can then tailor your comments to the actual footage that’s being shown
(I often remember details when watching the footage that I’m able to capture
as part of the narration). 
As soon as you finish making your narrative comments, click the Stop button
(which becomes active the moment you click Record). As soon as you click
the Stop button, VideoWave saves your recorded audio as a WAV file with the
filename Take  followed by the next available sequential number as in Take
00000.wav for the first narration track that you’ve saved. 
Note that you can record several individual narrations for different scenes in
the movie as part of the Narration track. Just cue up the starting frame for the
next narration, click the Record button, record your comments for the next
segment in the video, and then click the Stop button when you’re finished.
To preview your movie with its new narration track, click the name of the nar-
ration in the Recorded Narrations list box and then click the Preview button.
To remove a narration, click its filename in the Recorded Narrations list box
and then click the Delete button.
If you’re satisfied with what you now see and hear, click the Done button at
the bottom of the Narration dialog box to return to the normal VideoWave
window where the Production Editor is in its default Storyline mode.
If you don’t like what you hear and would like to edit one or more of your nar-
rations, click the Speaker icon on the tab in the lower-left of the Production
Editor. If your production contains background audio as well as narration
301
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

tracks, you need to click Nar (for Narration) in the pop-up menu that appears
below this icon. If you have recorded more than one narration track for the
production, you must select the track’s filename in the Object Selector dialog
box and then click OK. The Audio Editor window then opens with the wave-
form of your narration track. You can then use this window’s controls (which
are very similar to those in the Sound Editor covered in Chapter 5) to make
edits, including trimming the audio, adding fade-in and fade-out effects, and
adjusting the overall volume.
Adding audio clips to individual panels in the video production
Instead of, or in addition to, a background audio file that plays through the
entire video, you can add audio files to the individual items (color panels,
video clips, and still images). These audio clips play only as long these partic-
ular panels play in the video production. These audio clips can contain pre-
recorded sound effects, narration, or music that you want should just play as
part of the panel.
To add an audio clip to a particular panel, click the Show Media Selector link
in the Tools pane and then select the audio file to add in the Media Selector
dialog box. Drag the thumbnail of this audio file to the Production Editor
pane and then drop it on the particular scene panel to which it is to be asso-
ciated. VideoWave lets you know that you’ve added an audio file to that panel
by displaying a Speaker icon in the lower-left corner of the panel (which you
can use to open the file in the Audio Editor window).
The program automatically trims any clip that runs longer than the duration
of the panel to which it is affixed (if the audio clip is shorter than the panel’s
duration, you can loop it so that it repeats until the panel finishes playing —
see “Editing audio clips in Timeline mode” later in this chapter for details).
After adding an audio file to a particular pane, you must be sure to remember
to click the Edit Internal Tracks or Entire Production button, the second button
to the left on the top row of the toolbar in the Preview pane, to re-activate all
the panes in the production.
Working in Timeline mode
As the name implies, Timeline mode represents the various elements used 
in your video production as in different tracks plotted along a timeline. 
Figure 10-15 shows the VideoWave window after switching from Storyline 
to Timeline mode by clicking the Timeline button near the beginning of
Production Editor pane’s toolbar. The Production Editor pane in this figure
shows the information that I’ve added to the entire video production in the
Video, Music (background audio), Nar (narration), Fx1 (Effects, in this case,
Sepia Medium), and there’s also an Ovl (Overlay) and abc (Text) track that
isn’t visible in this figure).
302
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

When you switch to Timeline mode, the Production Editor pane presents all
the information in your current video production in individual tracks rather
than by sequential panels.
Hide and seek Track style
If you haven’t added an effect, text, or overlay to the video production and
aren’t likely to, you can make more room for yourself in the Production Editor
pane by hiding the Fx (Effects), Ovl (Overlay), and Text tracks. If you want to
be able to edit the audio that’s recorded as part of the video clips added to
the Video track (referred to as Native), you can display the Native audio
track.
Also, if you want to add an audio clip to the video production as a sound
effect or have already done so, you need to display the Sfx (Sound Effects)
track in order to add the audio clip to it (by dragging its audio file from the
Media Selector dialog box and dropping it onto this track in Production
Editor pane) and to later be able to edit the audio clip.
To hide certain tracks that you don’t need in the Production Editor pane or to
display tracks that are now temporarily hidden, right-click in anyone of the
tracks in the Production Editor and then click Tracks on the shortcut menu.
VideoWave then opens the Show/Hide Tracks dialog box that has check
Figure 10-15:

Timeline
mode.
303
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

boxes in front of the names of all the video/effect tracks and audio tracks you
can view in the Production Editor – Timeline pane (Fx 1, Ovl 1, Text 1 for the
Video/Effect tracks and Native, Music, Nar, and Sfx as the Audio tracks). To
display a particular track in the Show/Hide Tracks dialog box, click the
track’s check box until it contains a check mark. To hide a particular track,
click its check box until the check mark is cleared.
If you need to insert additional text, overlay, effect tracks to the Timeline
view of the Production Editor onto which to add supplementary Text tracks,
Overlay tracks, and Effect tracks which can then overlap those in original
Text 1, Ovl 1, and Fx 1, click the Add Text, Add Overlay, or Add Effect button
in the Show/Hide Tracks dialog box. Each time you click any of these three
buttons, VideoWave adds an additional Text, Overlay, or Effect track with the
next available number (as in Text 2, Ovl 3, and Fx 4).
Marking time with the Timeline ruler
At the top of the tracks in the Production Editor: Timeline pane, you find the
Timeline ruler. This ruler enables you to estimate the relative length of the
individual items in the tracks below. You can zoom in and expand the level of
detail in the tracks at the place in the Timeline ruler that you click with the
Hand mouse pointer and then drag to the right. So too, you can return to
your previous level of detail by dragging the ruler to the left.
Keep in mind that the zooming in and out that you do by dragging the
Timeline ruler (one of the coolest features of VideoWave in my humble opin-
ion) is more generalized than zooming in and out by clicking the Zoom In and
Zoom Out buttons or dragging the Zoom slider in the Timeline toolbar. Use
these buttons to zoom in and out on the particular part of the Video track
displayed in the Production Editor pane after using the ruler-dragging
method to bring that part into view in Production Editor.
The benefits of editing your video production in Timeline mode
At first blush, the benefits of editing your video production in Timeline mode
may not be apparent. Actually, there are two main benefits to editing your
video production in Timeline mode:
 In the tracks in Timeline mode, you can add multiple items, including
audio clips, narration, text, special effects and overlays to the entire
video production or to a single still image or video clips the production
contains.
 By comparing information in different tracks In Timeline mode, you can
see clearly how the different elements of the video production overlap
and relate to one another.
304
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

The first benefit point is by far the most important. If you try, for example, to
add two different audio files that you want to play one after the other as the
background audio for your video production in Storyline mode, VideoWave
will ask you if you want to replace the first audio file as soon as you try to
add the second one. If, however, you switch to Timeline, you add the second
audio file right after the first one in the Background Audio track simply by
dragging it into position on this track.
When editing in Timeline mode, you need to be aware that there are two
views that you can switch between:
 Production (the default) in which the tracks in the Production Editor:
Timeline pane show only the elements applied to the entire video 
production
 Internal tracks in which the tracks in the Production Editor: Timeline
pane show only the elements applied to the particular still image or
video clip in the production that you have selected
To switch from the Production view to the Internal tracks view, you simply
locate the still image or video clip in the Video track whose internal tracks
you want displayed and then double-click somewhere within that image or
clip. The Production Editor: Internal Tracks pane then appears at the bottom
of the VideoWave window. This pane contains the tracks for just the still
image or video you double-clicked. You can then edit the audio, text, effects,
and overlays applied only to this element in the appropriate tracks in this
view. When you’re finished editing in the localized Internal Tracks view, you
can return to the more general Production view by clicking the Edit Internal
Tracks or Entire Production button (the one with the filmstrip icon) on
Preview pane toolbar.
When editing elements in the tracks of the Production Editor (either in the
Production or the Internal tracks view), you can drag the bars representing
the different types of media items (audio, effects, text, overlays, and whatnot)
to resize or reposition them on its particular track. To resize an item, such as
an effect or an overlay, position the mouse pointer at the end of the item in
its track and then when the mouse pointer turns into a double-pointed arrow,
drag its blue bar to the left (to make it shorter) or to the right (to make it
longer).
When editing certain items such audio clips, effects, text, and overlays at the
Production view, you can split the items in two at the position of Timeline
playback head in the Production Editor by clicking its track and then clicking
the Split the Selected Item button on the Timeline toolbar. After splitting an
item, you can then resize and drag its now separate parts to different posi-
tions on the timeline so that they each affect only a certain part of the video
production.
305
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

Editing audio clips in Timeline mode
Although you can edit the length and the position (how long and where they
play) of the audio clips in your video production by directly manipulating
their bars in their respective tracks (Native, Music, Nar, and Sfx) in the
Timeline view in the Production Editor, if you want to the trim the audio or
modulate its volume or adjusting some other aspect of its sound, you need to
open the clip in the Audio Editor.
To do this, locate the audio clip in its track in the Production Editor: Timeline
pane and then right-click and then click the Edit option on its shortcut menu.
VideoWave then generates a preview of the selected audio clip and opens it
in the Audio Editor window similar to the one shown in Figure 10-16.
In the Audio Editor, you can make any of the following edits to the selected
audio clip:
 Adjust the overall volume of the audio clip by dragging the Overall
Volume (dB) slider to the right (to increase the volume) or the left (to
diminish the volume)
 Adjust the volume throughout the audio clip by clicking different
places in the waveform envelope to add edit points that you can then
drag up above the centerline to increase the volume or down below the
centerline to diminish the volume
Figure 10-16:
You can edit
the sound
quality and
volume of

window.
306
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

 Fade the volume in at the start and out at the end of the audio clip by
clicking the Fade In and Fade Out check boxes and then enter the fade-in
and fade-out times in the associated text boxes (in seconds) or select
them by clicking the Plus (+) or Minus (–) buttons.
 Equalize the sound in the audio clip by dragging the Bass, Midrange,
and/or Treble sliders in the Equalizer area to the right (to modulate the
sound using a 10-band equalizer, click the Advanced option button at the
top of Equalizer area; to select a predefined equalization, click the Open
button and click its name in the Media Selector; to save your customized
settings, click the Save button and enter a name for the audio settings in
the Save dialog box).
 Trim the audio clip by clicking the Trim Audio button to open the Audio
Trimmer. There, you drag the Current Position marker (the yellow verti-
cal bar) to the new start position and click the Mark Start Point button
before you drag the Current Position marker to the new end position
and click the Mark End Point. You then complete the trimming sequence
by clicking OK.
When you finish making some or all of these editing changes to your audio
clip, you can preview the modifications by clicking the Play button in the
playback controls at the bottom-left of the Audio Editor window. When you’re
satisfied with the tweaks and edits you’ve made to your sound clip, click the
OK button to close the Audio Editor and put the new audio settings into
effect in the VideoWave window.
To remove the audio portion that’s been recorded as part of a video clip,
right-click its clip in the Native audio track and click Edit on the shortcut
menu. Then in the Audio Editor window, drag the Overall Volume (dB) slider
all the way to the left so that in the future the video clip plays completely
silently in the movie as though it no longer had any audio associated with it.
Outputting the Video Production
When you finish having fun with the hundreds of VideoWave editing features
and finally have your video production just the way you want it and all the
last-minute changes are saved with the File➪Save command (in the native
VideoWave 8 DMSM file format), you’re ready to output your finished produc-
tion as a movie that you can share it with the rest of the world (Sundance
look out!).
VideoWave attempts to make outputting your finished production as easy as
possible. All you have to decide during this process is where you want the fin-
ished movie shown (on what device) and in what quality (which determines
how much compression is used in the final video file and how large the file is).
307
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

To output your finished and saved video production, click the Output As
button near the end of the Preview pane’s toolbar or choose File➪Output As
on the VideoWave menu bar. VideoWave displays the Make Movie dialog box
shown in Figure 10-17.
Here, you must select the tab for any of the following destinations for your
movie:
 Video File (selected by default) to make a movie that you can play on
your computer using a program such as Windows Media Player
 DV Camera to make a movie that you can output to digital tape on your
DV camcorder
 TV/VCR to make a movie that you can output to a video cassette tape
and then show on TV
 E-mail to make a movie that you can send as an attachment to an e-mail
message

308
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

As soon as you click the appropriate tab in the Make Movie dialog box, you
are presented with the options for determining the quality of the video. The
exact options that this window contains depend on which destination you
tab you click. In general, you need to specify the quality of the movie that
you’re making. In selecting the quality of the final video file, you are necessar-
ily selecting the amount of compression to be used and how large the result-
ing file will be (the higher the quality, the less the compression and the
bigger the final video file).
Note that when you select Video File as the destination, you must also select
the purpose of the video file in the Purpose drop-down list box (you select
the Playback on Another PC option on the drop-down list when your inten-
tion is just to play the movie with Windows Media Player). After selecting the
purpose of the video, you can specify the amount of compression to use by
selecting an option on the Video File Quality drop-down list (such as Generic
MPEG-1, Small Size or Generic MPEG-1, or Normal Quality).
Keep in mind when selecting a video format, physical movie size, and frames
per second from the Purpose drop-down list that each aspect affects the
overall size of the resulting movie file. The larger the physical movie size and
the higher the frames per second, the larger the resulting movie file. Large
movie file sizes are not only more difficult to share on the Internet but
require more processing power for playback on a personal computer.
After specifying the quality of the finished movie, you need to specify the
name of the new video file and its location in the File Name and Location 
text boxes. To select a new location and filename for the video file, click 
the Browse button to open the Save File As dialog box where you select the
folder and enter the filename before clicking the Save button.
After specifying the video settings and filename, click the Create Video File
button to open the Render dialog box where VideoWave creates the finished
movie file by rendering it frame-by-frame in the video file format you speci-
fied. After the program finishes rendering the video file, the Render dialog
box closes and you can then click the Preview button in the Make Movie
dialog box to preview the finished product. After you finish previewing the
movie, click the Done button in the Make Movie dialog box to close the it and
return to the VideoWave 8 window.
Burning the Video Production to Disc
Instead of outputting your finished video production to video file, you can
burn it to a DVD. To burn your finished and saved video production to a DVD,
click the Burn with MyDVD Express button (the one sporting the DVD icon)
at the very end of the Preview pane’s toolbar or choose File➪Burn with
MyDVD Express on the VideoWave menu bar.
309
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

As soon as you choose this command, the VideoWave application closes, the
MyDVD Express application launches with the video you created in VideoWave
already added to the main menu of a new DVD project (see Chapter 11 for
details on completing this project in MyDVD and burning it to disc).

In This Chapter
 Getting comfortable with the MyDVD 8 window
 Selecting and customizing the menu style of your DVD project
 Adding movies to your DVD project
 Creating submenus for your DVD project
 Burning your DVD project to disc
M
yDVD is the place to go to when you want to build and burn your DVD
projects. With MyDVD 8, you can construct projects that play on
standalone DVD players (including the latest machines using the newer VCD
and SVCD formats) as well as your computer’s DVD drive. As with all the
other applications in the Roxio Creator 8 suite, MyDVD makes it as easy as
possible to build and burn sophisticated DVD discs.
This chapter acquaints you with all the aspects of using MyDVD to create your
DVD projects and burn them to disc. It starts by familiarizing you with the dif-
ferent DVD projects supported by MyDVD. The chapter then goes on to intro-
duce you to the MyDVD window and its features (which will be very familiar to
those of you who have used the information in Chapter 10 to design and build
video productions in the VideoWave application). As part of this introduction,
you find out how to use and customize MyDVD’s built-in themes, add new DVD
titles to your project, as well as how to create a menu system for selecting
titles you add to your DVD.
The chapter ends by giving you pointers on how to preview and test out your
DVD project before burning it to disc and then giving you the ins and outs of
burning your finished project to disc.

Getting Cozy with the MyDVD Window
You can launch MyDVD from the Roxio Creator 8 Home window by clicking
the MyDVD link in the Applications Project window opened by clicking
Applications on the Home tab of the Project List pane. You can also open this
application by clicking the Create DVD link on the DVD & Video tab of the
Project List pane or its younger brother, MyDVD Express, by clicking its
Quick DVD link.
When you first launch MyDVD, a new, untitled DVD project opens in the
MyDVD 8 window (see Figure 11-1). This window contains four panes:
 Menu Tasks pane with links for adding movies and submenus to your
DVD project
 Edit pane with links for editing movies or chapters within movies
 Project View pane that depicts the layout of the menu system in your
DVD project
 Preview pane that shows you the current menu or submenu in your
DVD project

Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

Building Your DVD Project
As soon as you launch MyDVD to start a new DVD project, you notice that 
the program has already created a main menu for you called My Menu. This
menu uses a simple menu style whereby thumbnails for the movies and 
submenus you add are arranged in simple rows beneath the My Menu banner.
The background of to the main menu is a movie of rushing water that plays
whenever you play the DVD.
Modifying the menu style
The first thing you may want to do in a new DVD project is modify the menu
style. MyDVD offers a whole bunch of prefab styles that include the graphics
for the menu background, the look of the menu, chapter, and navigation but-
tons, the fonts used in displaying the main menu and chapter menu names
and the button labels, and even the background music that plays whenever
the main menu screen is displayed.
To select a menu style for your new DVD project, click the Change Menu Style
link in the Edit pane or choose DVD Menu➪Change Menu Style on the MyDVD
menu bar. MyDVD opens the Select Menu Style dialog box containing thumb-
nails of the various styles available. To preview the type of background
graphic, menu, chapter, and navigation buttons, and the font that a particular
predefined menu style uses, click its thumbnail in the list on the left side.
If you want the menu style to apply only to the main menu, leave the Current
Menu Only option button selected. If you want to apply the new menu style
to all the menus in the DVD project, click the Entire Project option button
before clicking OK.
Click the More Styles button to go online to the Roxio Web site and download
additional menu styles to use in the projects you create with MyDVD 8.
MyDVD enables you to modify the following aspects of any style that you
choose for your DVD project:
 Menu background by clicking the Change Menu Background link in the
Edit pane and then selecting the image, video, or slideshow to use in the
Select Media File dialog box
 Menu audio by clicking the Change Menu Audio link in the Edit pane and
then selecting the audio file to play in the Select Audio File dialog box
313
Chapter 11: Building and Burning DVDs

 Menu title fonts by clicking the title, selecting its text, and then using
the buttons on the Preview toolbar to change the font, font size, color,
attribute, and/or alignment
 Menu item layout by clicking the Rows drop-down list box and then
selecting another layout (such as Columns) on its list
To get an idea of how your changes to the menu background will appear in
the final DVD, choose DVD Menu➪Animate Preview on the MyDVD menu bar.
MyDVD will then animate any background that uses video or a slideshow as
well as play the background music assigned as part of the style.
Modifying the main menu title
After you select the theme you want to use in your new DVD project, you
probably want to change the generic title of the main menu from the com-
pletely uninspiring My Menu to something more descriptive such as The
French Riviera, Wedding Bells, and Baby’s First Year.
To modify the menu title, click the mouse pointer somewhere in the title text
to display its bounding box and marquee, and then drag through the text to
select it for editing. To change the font, font size, color or other attributes of
the text, use the Font, Size, Color, Style, Bold, and Italic buttons on the
second row of the toolbar in the Preview pane.
To reposition the menu title on the main menu screen, position the mouse
pointer on one of the borders and then when the pointer changes to a four-
headed arrow drag the title to its new place on the screen. To reflow the title
text, change the size and shape of its bounding box by positioning the mouse
pointer on either of its sizing handles (the tiny squares) and then dragging
the double-headed arrow pointer.
Keep in mind that the main menu name is not restricted to a single line
(simply press Enter to add a second line). If the text of any of your menu
titles extends beyond the edges of the screen, you will have to reposition
them or reduce the font size of their text until it all fits on the screen. Keep in
mind as well that any text that extends beyond the safe areas on the left or
right side of the main menu screen may be cut off when the DVD project is
played on some televisions. Click the Show/Hide TV Safe Zone button on the
first row of the Preview pane’s toolbar to display the safe area and check if
any text is in danger of being cut off (indicated by characters in the unsafe,
checkerboard area).
314
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

Adding movies to your DVD project
After you have the menu style and the menu title the way you want them,
you’re ready to start adding the movies with the content you want to play 
to your DVD project. Most of the time, these movies will be in the form of
video productions that you’ve created ahead of time in the Roxio Creator’s
VideoWave application (see Chapter 10 for details). They can also consist 
of slideshows that you put together in VideoWave or using the SlideShow
Assistant. If you haven’t yet created the slideshow you want to include in 
a DVD project, you can launch the SlideShow Assistant by choosing Movie➪
Add New Slideshow on the MyDVD menu bar (see Chapter 10 for help on
using the Slideshow Assistant).
To add a new movie from an existing VideoWave production, click the Add
New Movie link at the top of the Menu Tasks pane and then click the name of
the DMSM file (the filename extension given to Roxio Media Production files)
in the Select Media File dialog box before you click the Open button.
MyDVD then adds a thumbnail with the first frame of the movie as a menu
button with the name of the video production’s filename on the main menu
screen (see Figure 11-2).
Figure 11-2:

Chapter 11: Building and Burning DVDs

Editing movies in MyDVD
You can edit a movie that you add to your DVD project right within MyDVD.
Simply click the movie’s button to select it and then click the Edit Movie
button (the one third from the end on the second row) on the Preview tool-
bar. MyDVD then redraws its window to include playback controls at the
bottom of the Preview pane and a Production Editor pane in Storyline mode
at the bottom of the window (see Figure 11-3).
You can then use the Production Editor controls (both in Storyline and
Timeline modes) to make all necessary changes to your video. When you are
finished editing the movie, click the Back to Menu button in the middle of the
Preview pane toolbar to return to the normal MyDVD window.
Renaming, repositioning, and resizing menu buttons
Many times after adding a number of different movies to a menu screen, you
find that you need to rename, reposition, and even resize their menu buttons.
To rename a menu button, click its title to select it and then drag through its
text and edit the name as you would any other text. When you finish editing
the menu button’s name, click the mouse button somewhere on the screen
background outside of its text box.
To reposition a menu button on its menu screen, click the button’s thumbnail
and then position the mouse pointer somewhere within the thumbnail image.
When the pointer changes into a four-headed arrow, drag the button to its
desired position.
Figure 11-3:
Editing a

window.
316
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

To reposition more than one button at a time, Ctrl+click the buttons and then
drag their images to the desired position. If you want MyDVD to automati-
cally align the selected buttons for you, click the Align button on the Preview
toolbar.
Many times the menu buttons that you add to a menu screen are larger than
you want them to be. To avoid overcrowding on the menu screen and over-
lapping the text of the button labels, you may want to make the buttons
smaller (MyDVD automatically reduces the size of a button’s label when you
make its button image smaller).
To resize a menu button, click its thumbnail to select it (indicated by the red
border around the image with teeny-tiny sizing handles in each corner). Then
position the mouse pointer in one of the corners on a sizing handle. When
the mouse pointer changes into a double-headed arrow, drag the pointer
toward the center of the image to make the button smaller or away from the
center to make the button larger.
Assigning a new thumbnail image to a menu button
Many times you will find that you need to change the thumbnail image for a
movie that you add to your DVD project (by default, MyDVD uses the first
frame in the video or the initial photo in a slideshow as the button’s thumb-
nail). To assign a new image to a button, click the button to select it and then
click the More Settings button on the second row of the Preview pane’s tool-
bar (this is the very last button on the right).
MyDVD opens a Settings dialog box containing three tabs: Main, Position, 
and Style. Click the Style tab and then click the Custom option button in 
the Thumbnail section (doing this automatically de-selects the Use Link
Menu/Movie option button as well as activates the Browse button). Click 
the Browse button to open the Movie dialog box and then select the image
to use as the button’s thumbnail.
The Movie dialog box is initially set up to find only video files in the Smart
Objects, albums, and folders you select in the Movie dialog box. In order to
select a still image as the button thumbnail, you must remember to take the
extra step of changing the Files of Type setting to one of the accepted graph-
ics file formats (BMP, MPG, GIF, PNG, or TIFF).
Adding a submenu to the DVD project
Many of your DVD projects, especially those of the DVD project type that you
burn to DVD discs, will include too many movies for just the one main menu
screen. To add a new submenu to your DVD project, click the Add Submenu
link in the Menu Tasks pane after selecting the level to which to add this sub-
menu in the hierarchy on the Menus tab of the Project View pane. MyDVD
then adds a new submenu screen using the same background graphic and
generic menu name as the main menu screen.
317
Chapter 11: Building and Burning DVDs

The program also adds Home and Previous navigation buttons (in the style 
of the theme you selected for the project) that the user can click to either
return to the main menu screen or the previous menu level (which is not 
the same as the main menu when your DVD project contains more than 
two menu levels).
You can then rename this submenu screen and add new movies to it just as
you did in the main menu screen. To jump between the menu screens as you
continue to build and modify your DVD project, click the name of the menu in
the Project List pane.
You can add as many title menu screens as you need to accommodate all 
the titles you want to add to your DVD project. Just watch the Estimated 
Size indicator at the bottom of the MyDVD window as you add your movies 
to see how close you’re coming to filling up the DVD disc.
Adding an Intro Movie to your DVD project
An Intro Movie is one that automatically plays at the beginning of your DVD
disc when the user puts the disc into his or her DVD player. When the Intro
Movie finishes playing, the main menu screen appears and stays onscreen,
from which you can choose the next movie that you want to watch by select-
ing that movie’s menu button.
To add an Intro Movie to your DVD project, click the Add Intro Movie link in
the Menu Tasks pane or choose Movie➪Add Intro Movie on the MyDVD menu
bar. MyDVD then opens the Select Media File dialog box where you can select
the video production, video clip, or still image that you want to use as the
Intro Movie for your DVD project. 
After adding an Intro Movie, you then need to click the Intro Movie link on
the Menus tab of the Project View pane in order to display it in MyDVD’s
Preview pane.
For your Intro Movie, you may want to add a color panel or still photo on
which you place some introductory text with an overview of the disc’s con-
tents or the credits for your production, including yourself, of course, as the
director, best boy, key grip, and who knows what else!
Dividing a movie into chapters
Sometimes, you’ll want to break up a long video sequence in a movie or pro-
vide certain jump points in a title composed of a long sequence of photo-
graphic images. You do this by adding chapters to the movie. When you add
chapters to a movie, your users can jump back and forth to these jump points
by clicking the Previous (|<) and Next (>|) buttons on their DVD player’s
remote control. When creating chapters for a movie, you also have the option
of creating chapter menus whose buttons your users can click to jump back
and forth between the movie’s chapters.
318
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

To mark the chapters in one of the movies in your DVD project, follow these
steps:
1. On the Menus tab of the Project View pane, select the menu that con-
tains the movie you want to divide into chapters and then click its
button to select it.
2. Click the Edit Chapters link in the Edit pane or choose Movie➪Edit
Chapters on the MyDVD menu bar.
MyDVD opens the Edit Chapters dialog box similar to the one shown in
Figure 11-4. Here, you can add, change, or delete chapter markers in the
current title. When adding chapter markers, you can have MyDVD auto-
matically detect chapters by looking for changes in brightness and color
between successive frames and the pauses in the title and add chapter
markers at each pause. Or you can add them manually by scanning the
frames or photos in the title. 
To use MyDVD’s automatic scene detection feature to detect the changes
or pauses and add the chapter markers for you, click the Go button. To
increase the program’s sensitivity in differentiating chapters by changes
in the brightness and color of frames, you drag the Sensitivity slider to
the right or click the Plus (+) button. To control how long a pause must
be before the detection feature will insert a new chapter marker, enter
the number of seconds in the Every Seconds text box.
To add the chapter markers manually, you use Scubber, Jog Wheel or 
the playback controls (Play, Next Frame, and Fast Forward) found under
the title’s preview on the left side of the dialog box to find the frame or
photo where you want to start a new chapter. When you come upon this
frame or photo, you then click the Add Chapter Here button to add a
new chapter marker (whose thumbnail with its time code then appears
in the list box on the right side of the dialog box).
3. To have MyDVD detect and add the chapter markers for you, click the
Go button. To add the markers yourself, use the playback controls to
display the frame (or photo in a slideshow title) where the marker is
to occur and then click the Add Chapter Here button.
Sometimes MyDVD’s Auto Detect feature adds chapter markers that you
decide you really don’t need to retain. In that case, you can follow Step 4
to remove any unwanted chapter markers.
4. (Optional) To remove any chapter marker that you don’t want to use,
click its thumbnail in the list box on the right and then click the
Remove button (the one with the red X).
When you have indicated which chapter markers you want in your title,
you’re ready to have MyDVD create them.
5. Click the OK button to close the Edit Chapters dialog box and add the
chapter markers to your project.
319
Chapter 11: Building and Burning DVDs

If you added chapter menus to your title, you can check them out when you
preview the finished DVD project as described in the next section.
Previewing the finished DVD project
After you’ve got all the media you need in your DVD project, it’s time to pre-
view the final production before you burn it to DVD or CD disc. To preview
the DVD project you’re working on, you simply click the Preview Project
button on the top row of the Preview pane’s toolbar.
As soon as you click the Preview button, a preview window similar to the one
shown in Figure 11-5 appears. This window contains two panes: the DVD
Controls pane on the left, which contains a virtual DVD remote control, and
the Preview pane on the right, which contains a preview of your project’s
main menu screen.

Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

If your project contains an Intro Movie (see “Adding an Intro Movie to your
DVD project” earlier in the chapter for details), the Intro button at the top of
the DVD Controls will be available (otherwise it’s grayed out) in addition to
the Menu button. To preview the Intro Movie in your DVD project, click the
Intro button on the virtual DVD remote (remember that the Intro Movie plays
automatically on the disc you create from this project as soon as the user
puts the disc in the player).
To preview the other movies on the Main menu, click the Left, Right, Up, 
and Down controls on the virtual remote until the title you want to view is
selected (indicated by a highlighted outline around its thumbnail) and then
click the OK button on the virtual remote. When the title begins playing, you
can then use the other playback controls such as Pause and Fast Forward to

preview its contents. If you added chapter markers to your title, you can use
the Next Chapter and Previous Chapter buttons to jump to and from different
chapters in the title.
When you finish previewing a certain movie, you can return to the main menu
screen by clicking the Stop button. If your DVD project contains more than one
menu screen, you can advance to the next menu screen by highlighting the
Next button (an arrow in the project’s selected theme pointing to the right)
near the bottom of the main menu screen and then clicking the OK button on
the virtual remote. You can then return to the main menu screen by highlight-
ing this new menu screen’s Back button (an arrow in the style of the selected
theme pointing up or to the left) and clicking the virtual remote’s OK button.
When you finish previewing the movies on your DVD project, click the Close
button in the upper-right corner of the window to return to the original
MyDVD window. From there, you can make any necessary changes that you
noted when previewing the titles in the project, or, if everything looks good,
you can burn the DVD project to disc.
Burning DVD Projects to Disc
After you preview your DVD project and make any necessary last minute
changes to it, you’re ready to burn it to disc. The procedure for burning your
DVD projects to DVD disc with MyDVD is very much like burning a data disc
project (see Chapter 3) or Audio CD or MP3/WMA project (see Chapter 8)
with Music Disc Creator. 
After saving the finalized DVD project in the program’s native DMSD file
format by choosing File➪Save or File➪Save As and putting a blank DVD-R
disc in your computer’s CD/DVD drive, you begin the process by clicking the
Burn button at the far right on the Preview pane’s toolbar.
MyDVD then opens the Burn Project dialog box shown in Figure 11-6 where
all you have to do is click the Burn button.
Regardless of whether you play a newly burned DVD disc in your computer’s
DVD drive using software such as Windows Media Player, you will definitely
want to try playing the new DVD disc in your standalone DVD player using its
remote control to test out and select the various titles on the disc’s menus.
Note that you can also prepare an adhesive label for your DVD disc and
inserts for its jewel case using Roxio’s Label Creator (as described in Chapter
9). If you don’t want to take the risk of applying an adhesive label to the disc
(see the end of Chapter 2 for my warning on using adhesive labels on discs),
identify the disc by writing its name with a non-solvent based marker on the
label (what is commonly called the top) side of the disc. 
322
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

Of course, you never, never write on the bottom, shiny side of the disc
because that’s the side the laser reads.
Plug & Burn: From tape to disc in one step
MyDVD’s Plug & Burn feature enables you to burn your raw, unedited digital
video directly from your camcorder or your TV or VCR connected to your
computer directly to a DVD disc in your computer’s DVD drive. This is a great
feature for transferring video such as lectures or live entertainment events
(when video recording is not prohibited) where editing is not really required
for the DVD disc.
To use the Plug & Burn feature, connect your camera, TV, or VCR to the com-
puter using the appropriate cable and then insert a blank DVD disc in your
computer’s DVD drive. Then launch the Roxio Creator 8 Home and follow
these steps:
1. Click the Plug & Burn link on the DVD & Video tab of the Project List
pane in the Roxio Creator 8 Home window.
MyDVD opens the initial, Set Production Options, Plug & Burn window
shown in Figure 11-7. This dialog box contains options for selecting the
menu style, the drive containing the DVD disc, and the disc type (4.7 or
8.5 GB DVD disc).
Figure 11-6:

2. (Optional) To select a new menu style, click the Style button and then
click the thumbnail of the Style to use in the Select Menu Style dialog
box before you click OK. To create a disc without any menus, click the
NoMenu option button instead.
3. Click the Next button to open the second  Plug & Burn window —
Capture Video.
The Capture Video Plug & Play window (shown in Figure 11-8) is where
you select your capture settings (Device, Quality, and Create Chapters)
before you actually begin capturing the video.
By default, Plug & Burn captures your video using the HQ (High Quality)
setting that saves the video at 720 x 480 pixels using the Dolby Digital
AC-3 compressed audio file format. To modify these settings or the audio
recording level or balance, select another Quality option button or click
the Custom option button, followed by Settings, and then select the 
settings you want used in the Capture Quality dialog box before you
click OK.
By default, the program does not add any chapters to your video. To
have Plug & Burn create chapters from scene breaks in the video, click
the From Scene Breaks option button. To have the program create chap-
ters at set intervals, click the Every check box and then enter the
number of seconds in the Seconds text box.
4. (Optional) Make any necessary changes in the Quality and/or Create
Chapters settings.
Next you need to enter a new name for your movies in the Movie Name
text box.

5. Click the Insertion point in the Movie Name text box and highlight the
temporary disc name before you begin typing to replace this text with
the name you want to assign to the movie you’re about to capture.
Plug & Burn gives you a choice between manually recording the video
and capturing the entire tape. If you want to capture the video manually,
you have to cue up the tape using the playback controls under the pre-
view pane.
6. If recording a video or cassette tape, find the frame in the tape where
you want to start recording (this is the first frame if you want to
record the whole tape) and then click the Capture Now or Capture
Entire Tape button. If recording from your TV tuner, select the right
channel and then click the Capture Now button.
As soon as you click the Capture Now button, it becomes a Stop button.
If you want to pause the video capture (either to miss a commercial
break or find a new place in the tape), click the Stop button. Then, when
you want to restart the recording (after the break or when you’ve cued
the tape), click the Capture Now button again (which replaces the Stop
button as soon as you click it). Note that each time you click Start after
stopping it, MyDVD creates a new movie for the disc.
7. As soon as you finish recording your video, click the Finish button at
the bottom of the Plug & Burn dialog box.
As soon as you click the Finish button to close the Plug & Burn dialog box,
MyDVD displays the Burn Project dialog box, which keeps you informed of
the program’s progress as it begins burning your captured video to the DVD
disc. When the burn process is complete, click the OK button to close the
Burn Project dialog box and return to the Roxio Creator 8 Home window.

s you soon discover when you start using Roxio Creator 8, it’s more like
a combo of different mini-programs than a single software program.
This chapter looks at each of the top ten modules in the Roxio Creator 8
suite, with an eye toward its basic functions and features. Use this list to get
the lowdown on each of the major applications and tools that you use to col-
lect, organize, and create cool projects using all the different forms of digital
media: audio, still image, and video.
Disc Copier
Disc Copier is the application to use when you need to duplicate the CD and
DVDs that you create and burn with the other Roxio Creator components
including Creator Classic and MyDVD. In addition, you can use this nifty pro-
gram to make backup copies of non-protected commercially produced CDs
and DVDs.

The greatest thing about this program is that you don’t need to have two CD
or DVD drives on your computer in order to make your copies: Disc Copier
can make backups using one CD or DVD drive by temporarily copying the
disc files from the original CD or DVD disc to your hard disk and then copying
these files from the hard disk onto a new CD or DVD disc that you put in the
same drive.
You can access this program from the Roxio Creator 8 Home by clicking any
of the following links:
 Disc Copier in the Applications Project window opened by clicking
Applications on the Home tab of the Project List pane
 Copy Disc on the Copy tab or the Data tab of the Project List pane
See Chapters 3 for details on using Disc Copier to make backup copies of
your discs.
Backup for All Types of Data
Creator Classic is the place to go when you need to back up the media or
data files on your computer. You do this by compiling diverse data or media
files into a single project that you then burn to CD or DVD discs. You can
even create a Bootable Disc that contains enough of the Windows operating
system to boot your computer from your CD/DVD drive rather than your
hard disk.
Creator Classic also supports the creation of a Multimedia Disc that not only
contains the various types of media files (graphics, audio, and video) but also
contains play lists and menus for accessing the media following either the
HighMAT or MPV standards.
When you need to back up your data on CD or DVD disc on a regular basis,
you can turn to the Roxio Backup program. This application not only enables
you to specify the data files to be backed up but also to schedule the times
for the backups and have Roxio Creator give you reminders. You can then use
Roxio Retrieve to restore data files from data and backup discs created with
these applications.
In addition, you can use the CD Extra Disc Creator to create two different
kinds of special projects that mix data and audio. You can burn Enhanced
CDs that combine data and audio in separate sessions that can be played in
any CD player or CD-ROM drive (CD players play only the music tracks in the
later sessions, while CD-ROM can read both the data in the first session and
330
Part V: The Part of Tens 

the audio files in the later sessions) from Enhanced CD Projects. You can also
burn Mixed-Mode CDs that combine data and audio in a single session that
can only be played in your computer’s CD-ROM or DVD drive with software
programs like Windows Media Player from Mixed Mode CD Projects.
From the Roxio Creator 8 Home, you can launch Creator Classic, Roxio
Backup, or CD Extra Disc Creator by using the following links:
 Creator Classic in the Applications Project window opened by selecting
Applications on the Home tab or on the Data tab of the Project List pane
 Roxio Backup in the Applications Project window opened by selecting
Applications on the Home tab of the Project List pane or File Backup on
the Backup tab to open the Roxio Backup application
 CD Extra Disc Creator in the Applications Project window opened by
selecting Applications on the Home tab to launch Roxio CD Extra Disc
Creator
 Retrieve in the Utilities column of the Applications Project window
opened by selecting Applications on the Home tab to launch Roxio
Retrieve
See Chapter 3 for specific information on using Creator Classic, Roxio Backup,
and Roxio Retrieve to create and burn data discs and backup projects as well
as to restore data from their discs. See Chapter 7 for information on using CD
Extra Disc Creator to create Enhanced CD and Mixed-Mode CD projects.
Acquiring Digital Media 
with Roxio Media Import
Roxio Media Import program enables you to acquire digital media files from
both digital and analog sources connected to your computer. You can use
Media Import to acquire still images from scanners and digital cameras con-
nected to your computer. You can also use Media Import to acquire digital
video directly from your digital camcorder or from an analog device such as
your VCR connected to your computer. And if that’s not enough for you, you
can use Media Import to acquire audio files from audio CDs in your com-
puter’s CD-ROM or DVD drive, as live audio using a microphone, or from
some other analog playback device such as a record player or audio cassette
player connected to your computer. And finally, you can use Media Import to
acquire individual movie titles from unencrypted DVD discs (usually the ones
you create with MyDVD) that you put in your computer’s DVD drive.
331
Chapter 12: Top Ten (or So) Components of the Roxio Creator 8 Suite

To launch Roxio Media Import from the Roxio Creator 8 Home, you can click
either of the following links:
 Media Import in the Applications Project window opened by selecting
Applications on the Home tab of the Project List pane
 Capture Video on the DVD & Video tab of the Projects pane
To get detailed information on using Roxio Media Import to acquire any of
the previously mentioned types of digital media, see Chapter 9.
Audio Recording and Editing
Roxio Creator 8 enables you to record new audio files from a sound card
using its Easy Audio Capture as well as to rip tracks from your favorite audio
CDs and organize them into your own audio mixes.
In addition, its Sound Editor program enables you to create an audio mix
from recorded audio from various digital and analog audio devices connected
to your computer and to edit audio files that you’ve already acquired. In addi-
tion, you can use Sound Editor to convert one type of audio file into another
(for example, if you have an audio file saved in the uncompressed WAV audio
file format that you want to add to an MP3 Disc Project that you’re preparing
with Creator Classic). You can open it in Sound Editor and then convert it to
a compressed MP3 file (after selecting the audio quality and the amount of
compression).
When it comes to editing audio files, Sound Editor not only enables you to
trim the audio file, add fade-in and fade-out effects at the beginning and end,
and adjust the overall volume, but it also enables you to insert or remove
silences in a recording, add track breaks, as well as enhance the audio using
any of a number of useful and some not so useful but zany and fun special
effects.
To launch Easy Audio Capture, Music Disc Creator, or Sound Editor from the
Roxio Creator 8 Home, you click the following links:
 Easy Audio Capture under the Utilities column of the Applications
Project window opened by selecting Applications on the Home tab or
the Audio tab of the Project List pane
 Music Disc Creator in the Applications Project window opened by
selecting Applications on the Home tab or Advanced Projects on the
Audio tab of the Project List pane
 Sound Editor in the Applications Project window opened by selecting
Applications on the Home tab of the Projects List pane
332
Part V: The Part of Tens 

For information on creating Audio CDs and DVD Music Discs with Music Disc
Creator, see Chapter 7. For information about recording audio with Easy
Audio Capture and mixing the audio tracks with Sound Editor, see Chapter 5.
Disc Labeling with Label Creator
Label Creator is a really fun and surprisingly efficient utility for designing and
printing labels and jewel case inserts for the CD and DVD discs you create
with its Creator Classic, Music Disc Creator, and MyDVD applications. Label
Creator makes short work of the design end of the process by offering you a
wide variety of disc label and jewel case inserts to choose from. In addition,
its Auto-Fill feature enables you to automatically obtain the track, artist, and
album information for audio CDs and volume information for data discs.
After designing your disc labels and jewel case inserts, you can use Label
Creator to print out labels either on plain paper, specially prepared adhesive
disc label, or even directly on your disc, as well as on perforated case insert
paper. The utility also makes it easy to make any necessary printing adjust-
ments to get the label and case inserts to print just where you want them on
the page.
To launch Label Creator from the Roxio Creator 8 Home, click the Label Creator
link in the Applications Project window opened by clicking Applications on the
Home tab of the Project List pane. You can also launch this utility from the
Progress Information dialog box when burning a CD or DVD disc with Creator
Classic by clicking the Create Label button. For complete information on using
the Label Creator, see Chapter 8.
Organizing Digital Media 
with Media Manager
Media Manager is a godsend when it comes to managing all the different files
of different media types that you end up using with the projects you create
with the various Roxio Creator applications. Among the most useful of its fea-
tures are its Smart Views and media albums. Smart Views automatically cata-
logs media files by type that you put into special watched folders on your
computer system.
Albums are special files that gather together whatever media files you add to
them without requiring you to physically locate the files together in the same
file folder on your hard disk. Because albums don’t require you to physically
relocate the media files they contain, you can make the same media file (such
333
Chapter 12: Top Ten (or So) Components of the Roxio Creator 8 Suite

as a company logo or often-used audio track) a part of as many different col-
lections as you want. Whenever you open a particular album in the Media
Manager window, all of its files are available to you without your having to
pay any attention to where in the world they’re actually located on the com-
puter system.
In addition to organizing your media files into Smart Views and albums,
Media Manager also makes it easy to find specific media files by tagging them
with keywords, textual comments, and sound tags. You can then later use
Media Manager’s Search feature to quickly and easily find media files that
contain the same keyword or commentary text.
You can launch Media Manager from the Roxio Creator 8 Home by clicking
either of the following links:
 Media Manager in the Applications Project window opened by clicking
Applications on the Home tab
 Organize on the Organize tab of the Project List pane
To get detailed information on using Media Manager’s cool features for orga-
nizing your media files, see Chapter 4.
Enhancing and Managing Digital Photos
PhotoSuite 8 provides multipurpose editing for your digital photos. In addi-
tion to being able to make enhancements that fix flaws such as redeye, over-
and under-exposure, and blurriness, you can also do standard editing such as
rotating, cropping, and resizing images. PhotoSuite also has tools that enable
you to annotate your photos by adding text and to retouch them by painting
and drawing on them.
Beyond these very useful but very typical photo-editing features in
PhotoSuite itself, Roxio Creator 8 offers some really exciting and unusual
ones as well:
 Multi Photo Enhance to fix and enhance a batch of digital photos that
all need the same type of editing in one operation
 Photo Projects Assistant to use your photos in projects such as photo
collages, greeting cards, gift tags, postcards, and calendars
 Panorama Assistant to create sweeping panoramas from multiple indi-
vidual photos that pan a landscape and overlap one another
334
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Print Photos to make short work of printing more than one photo in
groups using different printing templates or even as thumbnails orga-
nized into contact sheets
 E-mail Assistant to quickly and easily e-mail groups of photos to friends
and family
To launch PhotoSuite or any of these other photo-related utilities from the
Roxio Creator 8 Home, you click the following links:
 PhotoSuite in the Applications Project window opened by clicking
Applications on the Home tab or Fix & Enhance Photos on the Photo
tab of the Project List pane to launch PhotoSuite 8
 Multi Photo Enhance in the Utilities column of the Applications Project
window opened by clicking Applications on the Home tab of the Project
List pane to open the Photos to Enhance dialog box where you can edit
multiple photos
 More Projects on the Photo tab of the Project List pane to launch the
Photo Projects Assistant
 Create Panoramas in the Utilities column of the Applications Project
window opened by clicking Applications on the Home tab of the Project
List pane to launch the Panorama Assistant
 Print Photos on the Photo tab of the Project List pane to launch the
Print dialog box where you can print multiple photos
 E-mail Photos on the Photo tab of the Project List pane to launch the
E-mail Assistant
For complete information on using PhotoSuite 8 and these other photo-
related utilties, see Chapter 6.
Easy Video Editing with VideoWave
VideoWave 8 is one of the most amazing digital editing programs available for
personal computers. It combines an easy-to-use interface and a couple of
step-by-step assistants with sophisticated video editing features and the
option between editing the production in its default Storyline or Timeline
mode.
The CineMagic Assistant enables you to quickly and easily assemble video
productions using your favorite digital video or photos that you can output
to popular movie formats, CD or DVD disc, or to VideoWave 8 for further edit-
ing. The SlideShow Assistant enables you to put together slideshows from
preferred groups of photos that you can then output in exactly the same way.
335
Chapter 12: Top Ten (or So) Components of the Roxio Creator 8 Suite

VideoWave 8 itself enables you to add background audio or actually narrate
your production in real time. The program also offers you a choice among a
wide variety of scene transitions along with a good assortment of text, over-
lay, and filter effects. In addition, VideoWave contains a powerful Pan and
Zoom Editor that enables you to pan and zoom around still images (giving
them the illusion of motion) and video clips (enabling you to focus on the
action within the frames).
When you complete the editing of your video production, VideoWave 8 makes
it easy to output your finished movie to whatever format suits your needs, be
that showing the movie on your computer with the Windows Media Player,
uploading it to the Internet for viewing on the Web, sending it to an external
device such as your VCR or digital video camera, or even sending it as an
e-mail attachment.
To launch VideoWave 8, CineMagic, or SlideShow Assistant from the Roxio
Creator 8 Home, you can click any of the following links:
 VideoWave in the Applications Project window opened by clicking
Applications on the Home tab or Edit Video on the DVD & Video tab of
the Project List pane to launch VideoWave 8
 Auto-edit Video with CineMagic on the DVD & Video tab of the Project
List pane to launch the CineMagic Assistant
 Create Slideshow on the Photo tab of the Project List pane to launch
SlideShow Assistant
For details on using VideoWave 8, CineMagic Assistant, and SlideShow
Assistant, refer to Chapter 10.
Creating and Burning DVD 
Projects with MyDVD
The MyDVD application enables you to assemble your digital video and still
images into DVD projects that you can then burn to CD or DVD disc complete
with menus for viewing in standalone DVD players or in your computer’s DVD
drive. MyDVD makes it easy to assemble your media in finished productions
using readymade themes that you can easily customize. 
When you’re finished assembling, editing, and previewing your DVD project,
you can then use the program to burn the finished production to DVD disc. In
addition to its powerful tools for assembling DVD projects, MyDVD also
336
Part V: The Part of Tens 

includes its Plug & Burn feature, which enables you to burn your video
directly from camcorder or video cassette player to DVD disc.
To launch MyDVD or the Plug and Burn utility from the Roxio Creator 8
Home, you can click the following links:
 MyDVD in the Applications Project window opened by clicking
Applications on the Home tab or Create New DVD on the DVD & Video
tab of the Project List pane to launch MyDVD 8
 Plug & Burn (DV to DVD) on the DVD &Video tab of the Project List
pane to launch the Plug & Burn utility
For complete details on using MyDVD and Plug & Burn, see Chapter 11.
Copying files on the fly 
with Drag-to-Disc
Last but certainly not least is Drag- to-Disc, the program that makes it a snap
to backup media files of any type on disc. All you have to do to start a backup
is put a CD or DVD disc in your computer’s CD-ROM or DVD drive, drag the
icons for the folder or file to backup from Windows Explorer, and then drop
them on the Drag-to-Disc program icon, which you keep on your Windows
desktop at all times when using the computer. The Drag-to-Disc program for-
mats the CD or DVD disc if the disc requires it and then proceeds to copy the
files. You can continue to copy files to the disc if there’s still additional space.
In addition to copying media files to disc on the fly, Drag- to-Disc offers a nifty
little ScanDisc utility that can check your disc for errors and attempt to
repair discs whose files have become unreadable or otherwise corrupted.
To launch Drag-to-Disc (when its program icon doesn’t automatically appear
when you start up Windows) from the Roxio Creator 8 Home, click the Drag
To Disc link in the Applications Project window opened by clicking
Applications on the Home tab of the Project List pane. To get more informa-
tion on using Drag-to-Disc to back up files, see Chapter 3.

oxio Creator 8 sports some very remarkable and definitely cool features
for working with all types of media. This chapter highlights the ten
coolest of the cool with an eye toward how they can help you get your work
done in crack time or, at the very least, have yourself a rocking good time! As
I note, some of these features are brand spanking new to version 8 of this
suite, but whether new or old, they are all just plain great to use.
Home Is Where Access to Every 
Roxio Creator Component Is
In Roxio Creator 8, the Home module is the be-all and end-all of the various
applications, tools, and utilities. This new module gives you instant access to
all these Roxio Creator components with its single-click hyperlinks arranged
on category tabs (Audio, Backup, Copy, Data, DVD & Video, Organize, Photo,

and Tools) in the Project List pane or in the Applications and Utilities
columns of the Applications Project window (opened by clicking 
Applications on the Home tab of the Project List pane). 
I guess the best thing about Home is the way that it interconnects Roxio
Creator’s diverse components. By launching different applications and tools
using its links, you’re assured that you’ll return Home the moment you exit
the program or utility that you launched. This gives you the opportunity to
then launch the next module that you may need in the editing process. In any
case, launching and then returning to the Roxio Creator 8 Home gives you a
much better sense of how all its diverse components come together to make
almost any type of media editing possible. See Chapter 1 for more on using
the Roxio Creator 8 Home module.
Keeping Up with Your Media 
via Smart Views
Smart Views is the brand new feature in the Roxio Creator 8 suite that auto-
matically keeps tabs on all the different media files on your computer system.
The best part about this feature is that you don’t have to do anything to
make use of it. The program automatically watches the My Documents folder
and Desktop for the addition of any media files (graphic, audio, or video) —
and you can add to this list.
Roxio then adds the files it identifies as media files to the Smart Views tab 
in the Media Manager program or the Media Selector dialog box available 
in programs such as VideoWave and My DVD. Thumbnail images of these
media files are then automatically categorized and placed in the All Photos,
All Music, or All Videos area of the Smart Views tab, making it super-easy to
find and use them in your audio and video productions.
Videos, Slideshows, and Play 
lists to Go with QuickShow
One of my most favorite features in Roxio Creator 8 is quietly tucked away 
in the Media Manager module. This is the QuickShow feature that enables
you to instantly turn a group of video clips, photos, or audio tracks into
impromptu movies, slideshows, or play lists, respectively. All you do to put
on any of these instant shows is open the Smart View, album, or folder that
contains the media you want to use. Then select the thumbnails of all the
340
Part V: The Part of Tens 

same media type (video, still image, or audio files) in the Contents area of the
Media Manager window and click the QuickShow link on its toolbar.
Media Manager then arranges the selected media files into a show that
Windows displays full screen on your computer. This screen contains a
simple playback controller that you can then use to pause the show, advance
to its next element, or even close to return to the Media Manager window.
QuickShow is not only fun to use but is a great way to put together quick-and-
dirty video sequences to create a kind of instant storyboarding. See the side-
bar in Chapter 4 for more on this cool feature.
Simple-to-Create Videos and Slideshows
The CineMagic Assistant and SlideShow Assistant are two fun and easy ways
to convert your digital video and photos into finished productions in no time
at all. With the CineMagic Assistant you can turn the digital photos or video
clips of your favorite vacation into a music video set to a music track of your
own choice. All you have to do is select the media files and the background
music to use in your production and CineMagic does the rest (making all the
editing decisions for you).
With the SlideShow Assistant you can quickly turn the digital photos into a
slideshow that you can output to a favorite movie format or edit further with
VideoWave 8. Like the CineMagic Assistant, the SlideShow Assistant makes all
the editing decisions, including what background music to use. See Chapter
10 for details on creating your own video productions with the CineMagic and
SlideShow Assistant.
More Complex Video Editing 
in Timeline Mode
VideoWave 8 supports an editing mode known as Timeline in addition to its
more familiar Storyline editing mode. When editing your video productions in
Timeline mode, you have more control over your production, including the
ability to add multiple elements (such as background audio, narration, text,
special effects, and overlays) to either the entire video production or just one
of its elements such as a particular video clip or still image that you’ve added
to one of its panels.
341
Chapter 13: Ten (or So) Coolest Features in the Roxio Creator 8 Suite

In addition, editing in Timeline mode gives you a view of each of the elements
in your video production as they relate to the Timeline ruler. This ruler gives
you the time code for any point in the production and can be instantly
expanded from the current position by simply dragging one of its indicators
with the mouse.
Combined with the intuitive Storyline mode, editing in Timeline mode gives
you much finer control over video productions where you want to time and
overlay different elements with great precision. See Chapter 10 for details on
editing your video production in Timeline mode.
Scene Stealing in SmartScan Mode
SmartScan mode in the Media Import program is a dream come true when it
comes to capturing digital video from your camcorder. Instead of forcing you
to manually scan and then capture each and every scene on your videotape,
in SmartScan mode you can have VideoWave do all the work. SmartScan
mode will scan your entire videotape for scene breaks. It then presents each
scene with its own thumbnail and time code, enabling you to pick and choose
the scenes that you actually want captured as video clips on your hard drive. 
After selecting the scenes to capture, SmartScan will then automatically
locate these scenes in the videotape and copy them to your hard disk 
without your having to click another button. For more on this timesaving 
feature, see Chapter 9.
Direct From Tape to Disc 
with Plug & Burn
The Plug & Burn utility is another one of those wonderful features that you
didn’t know you missed until you got it and then you wondered how you ever
did without it. This little wonder enables you to go directly from videotape to
DVD disc without having to bother with the intermediate step of using a DVD
editor such as DVD Builder. This is perfect for transferring finished video cas-
settes to the more durable disc media or for immediately creating DVD discs
from digital videotape that doesn’t need any type of editing such as record-
ings of live events (for which you have the right to copy, of course!).
All you need to do to use Plug & Burn to convert videotape into DVD disc is
connect the videotape player or camcorder to your computer, put the DVD
342
Part V: The Part of Tens 

disc in your computer’s DVD drive, and then cue up the place in the tape
where you want to start the recording. If you want to record the entire tape to
disc, all you have to do is click the Capture Entire Tape button in the Plug &
Burn dialog box. For more on using this nifty feature to go from tape to disc
in one step, see Chapter 11.
Easy DVD Disc Copies
In addition to making copies of your audio CDs, you can use Roxio Disc Copier
to make copies of any unencrypted DVD disc (which, of course, includes all
the DVD projects that you burn to DVD disc with DVD Builder). Because Disc
Copier visually displays the video and audio contents of your DVD disc, you
can easily remove any unwanted content from the copy. If you want to make a
duplicate disc, all you have to do to make the copy is switch the original and
blank DVD disc when Disc Copier prompts you to do so. Duplicate discs make
it possible to keep one set on the business site and another off-site just in case
anything goes wrong at the office. 
Multi Photo Editing, Printing, 
and E-mailing
Last but not least among the coolest Roxio Creator 8 features are the utili-
ties — Multi Photo Enhance, Print Photos, and E-mail Photos, respectively —
that give you the ability to make editing changes, print, and even e-mail
groups of digital photos at one time. (Multi Photo Enhance is available from 
a link in the Utilities column of the Applications Project window and Print
Photos and E-mail Photos from links on the Photo tab of the Project List
pane).
Multi Photo Enhance enables you to select a group of photos and then apply
the same type of fixes (including exposure, color saturation, sharpness, and
red eye), transformations (including rotating, flipping, and resizing), special
effects, conversion to another graphics file format, and renaming to them.
Print Photos enables you to print multiple photos on a single sheet using vari-
ous standard paper sizes and print layouts as well as to print out thumbnails
of your photos on contact sheets. E-mail Photos gives you the ability to gather
together a group of your favorite photos and then have them resized and
added to a blank e-mail message in your e-mail program ready for sending.
