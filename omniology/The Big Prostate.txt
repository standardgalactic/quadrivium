Preface
With increasing life expectancy throughout populations globally, men have a greater 
chance of developing significant benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) than ever 
before. These men can present to urological services in a number of ways, some 
being referred by their primary care practitioners to secondary care with lower uri-
nary tract symptoms, and others, presenting as an emergency directly to hospital 
services. Increasingly, those with larger prostates are being referred from secondary 
to tertiary care centres where specific technology may be available for the manage-
ment of this problem.
There are a number of well-established medical, interventional and surgical 
management options available, but men with a particularly large prostate, over 
100 cc, pose a particular challenge to clinicians. The big prostate is difficult to 
manage from the point of view of the complexity of presentation, pharmacologi-
cal treatments, bleeding, catheterization, surgery and subsequent complica-
tions. This interesting group of men is one that all urologists involved in general 
urology will have encountered. However, there is a lack of guidance and resources 
dedicated specifically to the management of men with these huge prostates 
greater than 100 cc, which differs from the routine management of BPH in smaller 
glands.
This book will be of particular use to healthcare practitioners who manage 
men with BPH in the outpatient or emergency setting and in the operating the-
atre who want further tips on how to deal with the big prostate greater than 
100 cc. It covers the anatomy and physiology of the big prostate, how it presents 
to medical services and the diagnostic challenges of raised prostate specific anti-
gen testing in the big prostate. Medical treatment, which is commonly first line in 
benign prostatic hyperplasia, may not be as effective in the particularly large 
prostate and a chapter is dedicated to the evidence behind medical manage-
ment in the big prostate.
The specific techniques, advantages and disadvantages of different surgical 
approaches specifically for the bigger prostates will be discussed. Prominent 
experts in the field will divulge intraoperative tips on surgical techniques from 
their years of experience for dealing with the huge gland. Prostate artery 

vi
­embolization, enucleation of the prostate, green light laser, transurethral resec-
tion of the prostate, simple robotic prostatectomy and open surgery are covered in 
dedicated chapters. There is a discussion on the management of the comorbid 
patient, which we are increasingly faced with, as well as advice on carrying out 
other non-BPH-related urological procedures in men who have a particularly diffi-
cult operation due to an obstructing big prostate. The book will be rounded off by a 
discussion on what the future holds for the management of huge BPH.
In summary, huge BPH is a growing problem which may become an increasingly 
common presentation in future years. We believe that all urologists, trainees, emer-
gency medicine doctors, primary care doctors and medical students interested in 
men’s health will greatly benefit from the information, advice and techniques cov-
ered in this first book dedicated to the Big Prostate.

1.1  Anatomy of the Large Prostate
The male prostate is a derivative of the primitive endoderm, developing during 
embryogenesis from the cloaca. The connected vas deferens and seminal vesicles 
develop from the mesonephric ducts, which secrete fluid which comprise semen. 
The prostate is a fibromuscular gland, pyramidal in shape and surrounding the male 
urethra. It is surrounded by peri-prostatic fascia. A thin layer of connective tissue 
forms the true capsule. Superficial to the true capsule is the pseudocapsule, formed 
by three layers of fascia on the anterior, posterior and lateral aspect of the prostate. 
Superiorly, the gland is continuous with the bladder neck. The urethra enters the 
base of the prostate from the anterior border. Inferiorly, the apex of the gland lies on 
the external sphincter of the bladder (Fig. 1.1).

Anterior to the prostate is the pubic symphysis, separated from it by the extra-­
peritoneal fat of the retro-pubic space (Cave of Retzius). Within this space lies the 
peri-prostatic plexus of veins. The puboprostatic ligaments connect the apex of the 
prostate to the pubis. The fascia of Denovilliers lies posterior to the prostate separat-
ing it from the rectum, whilst laterally is the levator ani muscle which fuses with the 
lateral fasia of the prostate [1].
The vas deferens and the seminal vesicles join to form the ejaculatory ducts at 
the supero-posterior part of the gland and open into the prostatic urethra on either 
side of the verumontanum.
1.1.1  Vascular Supply
The arterial blood supply is generally from the inferior vesical artery, a branch of 
the internal iliac artery, which enters the prostate from either side of the gland. 
Additional arterial supply can come from the middle rectal and pudendal arteries. 
The venous system forms a prostatic plexus, which receives the dorsal vein of the 
penis and drains into the internal iliac vein on each side of the gland (Fig. 1.2).
1.1.2  Neurological Innervation
The nerve supply of the prostate is from both the autonomic and somatic nervous 
systems. The autonomic, para-sympathetic (PS) innervation arises from sacral lev-
els S2-S4. The PS nerves end at the acini cells of the prostate and lead to prostatic 
secretions. The sympathetic nerves supply originates from the thoraco-­lumbar lev-
els T12-L2 and produce contraction of the smooth muscle of the prosatic capsule

and stroma. The main somatic innervation is from the pudendal nerve which inner-
vates the striated sphincter and levator ani controlling the internal sphicter.
1.1.3  Lymphatic Drainage
The lymphatic drainage of the prostate is to the obturator and the internal iliac lym-
phatic nodes. There is also lymphatic communication to the external iliac, presacral, 
and the para-aortic lymph nodes.

1.1.4  Zones of the Prostate
In adults up to the age 50 the average prostate gland is approximately the size of a 
chestnut, 15–30 cc, enlarging by hypertrophy. However, a growing cohort of male 
patients are presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in the context of 
a clinically large prostate greater than 100 cc. This provides a new clinical challenge 
in the management of their symptoms.
The prostate gland can be divided further into three zones: Transition zone (TZ), 
Central zone (CZ), and Peripheral zone (PZ) [2, 3]. The prostate consists of 70% 
glandular tissue and 30% fibromuscular stroma. The TZ accounts for 10% of the 
glandular tissue and 20% of adenocarcinomas (Fig. 1.3).
The TZ is where benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) occurs and can lead to blad-
der outflow obstruction (BOO) if the adenoma grows large enough to narrow or 
compress the prostatic urethra. The TZ is often described as having two lateral lobes 
and a median lobe that can lead to the symptoms of the lower urinary tract symp-
toms (LUTS).
A urethral crest runs along the posterior midline and disappears at the membra-
nous urethra. On both sides of the urethral crest, there is a grove where the prostatic 
sinuses exist and drain all of the glandular elements. The urethral crest widens and 
protrudes from the posterior wall as the seminal colliculus (verumontanum). A 
small midline pit, the prostatic utricle, is found at the apex of the ­seminal colliculus. 
On either side of the utricular orifice, the small slit like openings to the ejaculatory 
duct can be found.

The CZ is the area surrounding the ejaculatory ducts. This zone consists of 25% 
of the glandular tissue. Very few adenocarcinomas are found in this region and can 
represent as little as 1–5% of tumours in the prostate.
The PZ of the prostate constitutes 70% of the glandular tissue. This zone covers 
the posterior and lateral aspects of the prostate. The peripheral zone is the area that 
is palpated on digital rectal examination (DRE) and represents the area where 70% 
of adenocarcinomas are found. This area is also the location most commonly 
affected by chronic prostatitis [4].
1.2  Physiology of the Large Prostate
The principal function of the prostate is to provide the proteins and electrolytes that 
form the bulk of the seminal fluid. Furthermore, the prostate has a role in maintain-
ing continence through autonomic control of the internal urethral sphincter. In men 
with BPH, the enlarged prostate presses against the urethra. The bladder wall 
becomes thickened form hyperplasia of the muscle fibres of the bladder wall and 
eventually the bladder may weaken and lose the ability to empty, leaving some urine 
in the bladder. The combination of narrowing of the urethra and incomplete empty-
ing of the bladder can lead to urinary incontinence through secondary detrusor 
overactivity.
The adult human prostate is a tubuloalveolar gland composed of ducts lined with 
pseudo-stratified columnar epithelium. The cells lining the ducts are columnar and 
secretory, with basal nuclei. An almost continuous layer of basal epithelial cells 
forms the basement membrane. The prostatic epithelium is, in turn, surrounded by 
a dense fibromuscular stroma.
The embrylogical development of the prostate begins with the growth of pros-
tatic buds from the urogenital sinus at about 10  weeks of fetal development in 
humans. Androgen receptors (AR) in the urogenital sinus are stimulated by testicu-
lar androgens to induce epithelial budding, proliferation and differentiation, to form 
the ductal structures.
In the mature prostate androgens are believed to act upon the prostatic smooth 
muscle (which expresses AR) to maintain a fully differentiated, growth-­quiescent 
epithelium. This occurs via stromal–epithelial cell interactions under the control of 
regulatory growth factors.
BPH is characterised by an increase in both epithelial and stromal cell numbers 
of the prostate. During embryological development there is formation of new pros-
tatic glands. However, the development of new glands in the adult prostate has given 
rise to the hypothesis of “re-awakening” of proliferating cells. This increase in cell 
number could be due to proliferation of stromal and epithelial cells, as well as 
impairment of programmed cell death [5].

1.2.1  Testosterone
It has long been recognised that testosterone leads to prostate growth and with 
increasing age in men, BPH, which is linked, to BOO and LUTS. Cell proliferation 
within the prostate is controlled by testosterone. Testosterone can bind directly 
to the androgen receptor (AR), or may be converted to its more potent form, 
dihydrotestoterone (DHT) by the hormone 5α-reductase (5AR) [6].
Testosterone diffuses into both epithelial and prostatic stromal cells. In epithelial 
cells it binds directly to the AR. In prostate stromal cells the majority of testosterone 
binds directly to the 5AR hormone and is converted to DHT, which then binds with 
more affinity and thus more potency to the AR than in the stromal cells.
The hormone-receptor complex then interacts with cell DNA at specific binding 
sites inducing transcription of 5AR mRNA and subsequent protein synthesis [7].
There are two isoforms of 5AR: Type-I 5AR, which is found in the liver, skin and 
prostate and Type-II 5AR, found predominantly in the prostate stromal cells but 
not within the prostatic epithelial cells.
This has clinical and pharmacological significance as Finasteride is selective for 
type-I 5AR whereas Dutasteride inhibits both type-I and type-II 5AR [8].
Studies demonstrate that 5AR Type-I and Type-II mRNA are present in all pros-
tate zones, including the PZ, TZ and CZ, in tissue samples from individuals with a 
normal prostate, patients with BPH and patients with prostate cancer.
Patients with large prostates have an increased risk of concomitant BPH and 
prostate cancer (PCa). Large glands with BPH have been shown to have an 
increased expression of 5-AR Types I and II mRNA. In PCa, Type-I 5AR mRNA is 
overexpressed but Type-II is not [9].
1.2.2  Androgen Hypothesis
Historically it was believed that PCa was related to testosterone levels. Thus the 
‘Androgen Hypothesis” was used to explain relationship that high levels of testos-
terone predispose patients to PCa and low levels of testosterone were protective. 
However, the androgen hypothesis has been seriously challenged, as overwhelming 
evidence contradicts its basic principles [6]. Evidence shows that men with high 
serum testosterone are not at an increased risk of developing PCa and that low 
serum testosterone provides no protection against the development of PCa. 
Furthermore some men with untreated PCa can receive testosterone therapy without 
subsequent risk of PCa progression [7].
The androgen hypothesis has therefore been replaced by the ‘Saturation Model’, 
whereby the prostate tissue is shown to be sensitive to changes of testosterone at low 
levels but indifferent above a set threshold. This threshold effect occurs when 
O. Nehikhare et al.

increasing androgen levels reach a limit beyond which there is no further ability to 
induce androgen driven changes to prostate tissue [10].
1.2.3  Growth Factors
As well as androgens, other soluble modulators have an effect on the prostate tissue. 
Stromal and epithelial cell interactions are mediated by soluble growth factors, 
which stimulate or inhibit cell division and differentiation.
Growth stimulating factors include basic fibroblastic growth factor, epidermal 
growth factor, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), and insulin-like growth factor 
(IGF). Transforming growth factors (TGFB) normally inhibit epithelial cell prolif-
eration and it is possible that TGFB is down-regulated in BPH [11].
1.3  Pathology of the Large Prostate
BPH begins in the sub-mucosal layer of the TZ around the proximal urethra. There 
is proliferation of epithelial cells of the acini, ductules, smooth muscle and stro-
mal fibroblasts. These changes, especially in larger prostates, cause distortion 
and compression of the urethra which results in LUTS (Table 1.1). Other compli-
cations of BPH occur less frequently than LUTs but may include acute urinary 
retention (AUR), renal failure, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI’s), haematuria 
and bladder stones.
The central prostate is also affected by benign prostatic enlargement, causing 
compression of the PZ and fibrosis, resulting in a surgical capsule. Increased ­urethral 
resistance results in compensatory changes in bladder function. Higher detrusor pres-
sures are required to maintain urinary flow. Evidence suggests that men with larger 
prostates are at much higher risk of LUTS and their complications and benefit from 
early intervention from treatment to reduce the risk of long term complications [12].
Squamous metaplasia of the ductal epithelium at the PZ is common, especially 
in larger prostates, with 10–20% of patients having incidental foci of adenocarci-
noma. 70% of prostate cancers develop in the PZ. The non-invasive proliferation of

epithelial cells within the ducts is termed prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia (PIN). 
High grade PIN is generally considered to be a precursor of cancer though its clini-
cal significance is more widely debated. 95% of prostate cancers are adenocarcino-
mas, with the remainder being ductal, squamous, transitional cell tumours and 
rarely carcinosarcomas [13].
1.3.1  Histology
Most prostatic adenocarcinomas are acinar in origin and feature small to medium-
sized glands that lack organization and infiltrate the stroma. Progressive loss of 
differentiation of the prostatic adenocarcinoma is characterized by increasing vari-
ability in gland size and cell organization, as well as occurrence of papillary and 
cribiform patterns.
1.3.2  Cytology
On microscopic examination, prostate cancer cells show pleomorphic and hyper-
chromatic nuclei. Their cytoplasm is stained to become eosinophillic and there are 
have highly visible nuclei on a background of chromatin near the nuclear 
membrane.
1.3.3  Grading
Core biopsies are routinely taken for patients with abnormal DRE or raised prostate 
specific antigen (PSA). The histological aggressiveness of the disease is quantified 
using the modified Gleason grading system, in which the dominant and secondary 
histological patterns are scored from 3 (well differentiated) to 5 (undifferentiated), 
and summed up to a total score of 6–10 for each tumour [14, 15].
The best-differentiated tumours have a Gleason score of 6 (3 + 3), with well 
circumscribed glands but variation in shape and size, whereas undifferentiated can-
cers have a score of 10 (5 + 5) and show no glandular differentiation and ­central 
necrosis. When combined with the tumour stage, the Gleason grading system has a 
prognostic value, with lower scores correlating with a better prognosis [16]. There 
has been a recent proposal to change this into Gleason Grade Groups 1–5 which 
authors suggest are a simplified more accurate way of assigning risk of disease 
(Table 1.2). This new grading system was accepted by the World Health Organization 
(WHO) for the 2016 edition of Pathology and Genetics: Tumours of the Urinary 
System and Male Genital Organs [14].
O. Nehikhare et al.

1.3.4  Invasion and Metastasis
The high frequency of invasion of the prostatic capsule by adenocarcinoma relates 
to the subcapsular location of tumours in the PZ. Perineural tumour invasion is com-
mon but presents a poor prognotic indicator. Peripheral nerves are devoid of lym-
phatics so contiguous spread of the tumour along tissue planes is the process of 
disease progression. Seminal vesicles can be involved, with bladder invasion occur-
ring in advanced disease.
Prostate metastasis occurs early on in the disease, with dissemination to the iliac 
and para-aortic lymph nodes. Lymph node dissection (LND) during Robot Assisted 
Radical Prostatectomy (RARP) allows for accurate staging of PCa. The internal 
iliac, obturator, and lateral hypogastric lymph nodes commonly resected in high risk 
patients may decrease disease progression and potentially increase survival [17].
Lung metastasis reflects further lymphatic spread through the thoracic duct and dis-
semination from the prostatic venous plexus to the inferior vena-cava. As a consequence 
of haematological and lymphatic spread, bone metastases often occur, particularly to the 
skull vault, vertebral column, ribs, pelvic bones and the upper ends of the humerus and 
femur. These sites correspond to the distribution of the highly vascular red bone marrow.
1.4  Conclusion
With an increasing population of men possessing larger prostate glands there is a 
growing risk of more men suffering from LUTS and their complications. It is 
becoming more important for the clinical urologist to understand the affect of the 
large prostate and the relationship between the anatomy of the gland and the patho-
physiology of both benign and malignant disease to improve the clinical manage-
ment of patients.

2.1  Introduction
The development of the very large prostate (>100 cc) is increasingly a recent phe-
nomenon. In the previous decades prior to the introduction of medical therapy 
(mostly alpha blockers) for the symptoms of benign enlargement of the prostate and 
bladder outflow obstruction, the standard treatment was transurethral resection of 
the prostate. Therefore, most patients with an enlarged prostate who had symptoms 
were treated with an operation before their prostate reached large volumes. In the 
contemporary clinical practice, almost all patients are offered alpha blockers when 
they develop voiding symptoms. In the UK general practitioners can start treatment 
months or even years before the patient is referred to urologist [1].
Although androgens play an essential role in prostate development and growth in 
early adulthood [2, 3], there is however conflicting evidence of the effect of andro-
gens on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is suggested that the change in the 
testosterone/oestrogen ratio may play a role in the development of BPH [4]. The 
incidence of very large BPH remains very rare and most studies reporting the large 
prostate are case reports [5, 6]. The largest reported enlarged prostate is of the size 
of almost 4000cc [7]. This was measured on MRI and the report suggested it was 
treated conservatively. There is no consensus to what constitutes a very large pros-
tate, some authors arbitrarily defined giant prostate hyperplasia for any gland mea-
sured above 200 g [8]. Most authors reporting the outcome on Holmium Enucleation

of the Prostate (HoLEP) or simple prostatectomy as a surgical treatment for very 
large BPH use 80 cc as a cut off size [9, 10].
Obesity has been shown to be associated with BPH. In a study of more than 1600 
patients, Bhindi et al found a direct correlation between increased body mass index 
and prostate size. For every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI, the authors found a 2.1 mL 
increase in prostate size [11]. In a mouse model, obesity was found to cause voiding 
dysfunction [12]. Metabolic syndrome is implicated in lower urinary tract symp-
toms and prostate enlargement [13, 14].
Very large BPH may cause variety of symptoms or none at all. Patients are usu-
ally not aware of how large their prostate is and can present to the urology clinic 
with symptoms of bladder outflow obstruction, however there are peculiarities 
specific to the very large prostate.
We will explore the different types of presentation in this chapter.
2.2  Emergency Presentations
Patients who have very large BPH often may not realise how large their gland is and 
are completely unaware of the implications of this. They may develop the typical 
symptoms of bladder outflow obstruction with voiding symptoms and are usually 
started on alpha blockers for some time before their presentation. Occasionally 
patients can present acutely with one of the following.
2.2.1  Haematuria
The enlarged prostate is usually extremely vascular. Around 2.5% of men with BPH 
will present with haematuria [15]. The incidence is expected to be higher in very 
large BPH. the patient may develop microscopic or macroscopic haematuria. The 
patient is usually alarmed after one episode of visible blood; however non-visible 
haematuria may require multiple visits to the general practitioner before it is inves-
tigated. This would eventually lead to referral to urological service where the typi-
cal investigation would conclude that the patient has bladder outflow obstruction 
and an enlarged prostate. Occasionally patients develop recurrent haematuria 
requiring multiple admissions. However, a careful assessment would reveal the 
cause of the bladder outflow obstruction to be an enlarged prostate. Without the aid 
of adequate imaging or due to the patients body habitus, the assessing urologist may 
underestimate the size of the prostate at physical examination [16] and there is 
hence a risk of only realising how large the prostate is on endoscopy just before the 
start of transurethral resection. Recurrent haematuria can be treated with a 5 alpha-
reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride but if a significant problem 
then a procedure may be required. The options in the setting of huge BPH are

13
prostate artery embolisation (see Chap. 6) or if surgery is required then HoLEP, 
Greenlight PVP, TURP and open simple prostatectomy are also options.
2.2.2  Clot Retention
Patients with very large BPH often develop more significant and dangerous haema-
turia compared to other patients with smaller prostates. Not all patients who present 
with haematuria will require admission or a catheter insertion. Admission is recom-
mended if a visible haematuria is associated with difficulty in voiding and if there is 
drop in Hb level, and in most patients with anticoagulants other than aspirin (warfa-
rin, clopidogrel, heparin). Patients will require a three-way catheter insertion if the 
haematuria is severe with clots, and the patient is experiencing difficulty in voiding. 
three-way catheter is a specific type catheter with three channels; one for inflating 
the balloon, one channel for the inflow of the irrigating fluid and once channel for 
the outflow. Insertion of this catheter is no different to the insertion of all other cath-
eters; however, it is recommended that a larger gauge catheter is inserted, at least 
size 20 ch. The typical practice is to insert 22ch three-way catheter in a patient with 
haematuria who requires irrigation. The irrigation system consists of bag of irriga-
tion fluid (Saline), tubing system to connect it to the inflow opening of the three-
way catheter. The outflow opening of the catheter is attached to a catheter draining 
bag. The fluid is infused slowly in the bladder and drained continually in the drain-
ing bag. The aim is to avoid accumulation of clots in the bladder which can cause 
further bleeding and severe patient distress and discomfort. Patients who develop 
clot retention at presentation will require three-way catheter insertion and a manual 
bladder washout should be performed. Some patients will require evacuation of 
clots under rigid cystoscopy and an anaesthetic. This can be a challenging procedure 
fraught with difficulty as the size of the prostate may limit the access to the bladder. 
An extra long resectoscope may be required and a series of Ellick evacuators and 
bladder syringes will be required to remove the bladder clots. Following this emer-
gency procedure it is wise to consent the patient for urgent elective treatment such 
as HoLEP, open simple prostatectomy or PAE (see subsequent Chaps. 6–11) to 
prevent a recurrence.
2.2.3  Difficult Catheterisation
Not infrequently patients may require catheterisation for urine output or tissue per-
fusion monitoring purposes or perioperatively following non-urological major oper-
ations and patients who have large BPH may present a challenge for catheterisation 
to the non-expert. Often urologists are called to help with catheterising a patient 
who otherwise didn’t previously have symptoms only to find insertion of the

catheter is difficult beyond the prostatic fossa due to the enlarged prostate (Fig. 2.1). 
In these cases, a curved tip catheter (16Fr, Tiemann or coudé tip) in case of bleeding 
can help negotiate the high bladder neck and middle lobe (Fig. 2.2). It is unwise to 
use a rigid introducer in these situations as a stricture or the prostate will lead to the 
formation of a false passage. One option is to pass a flexible guidewire down the 
urethra in the hope that it will gradually “find its way” into the bladder and then 
subsequently pass an open ended catheter over it. The safest and more secure way 
to catheterise in this situation is to use a flexible cystoscopy and directly pass a 
floppy guidewire under direct vision. Once the cystoscope is removed an open 
ended catheter is passed into the bladder.
2.2.4  Acute Urinary Retention
In a similar scenario to bladder outflow obstruction in enlarged prostate the very 
large prostate can cause bladder outflow obstruction and acute painful urinary reten-
tion. The patient would develop lower abdominal pain and inability to pass urine. 
the symptoms are usually identical to BPH except and in some cases, catheter inser-
tion may prove to be difficult. Insertion of suprapubic catheter in these cases is 
fraught with danger as the part of the prostate may lie in the path of the suprapubic 
trocar and an unwitting insertion of such catheter my result in piercing of the pros-
tate and subsequent catastrophic bleeding (Fig. 2.3). A radiologically guided inser-
tion of suprapubic catheter in these cases is warranted. The likelihood of passing a 
trial of voiding is much less with a huge gland and therefore there should be a low

inserting this type of catheter as the concavity of the curve should face anteriorly otherwise a great 
deal of damage and false passage can be inflicted. Only a person who is familiar with this type of 
catheters and with the prostate anatomy should attempt at using it
threshold for moving onto bladder outflow surgery in these men. In addition to 
immediate failure to void following catheter removal, a subsequent episode of acute 
retention may lead to a difficult catheterisation and haematuria or the need to place-
ment of a supra-pubic catheter thus pushing the urologist to operate sooner rather 
than later on these cases.

2.2.5  Acute Renal Insufficiency
Occasionally some patients may present with signs of renal failure with high pressure 
urinary retention. These patients need urgent catheter insertion and acute manage-
ment of their renal failure. Concurrent renal impairment can result from decreased 
GRF and can lead to abnormal creatinine. A scan of the urinary tract will usually 
reveal hydronephrosis. An urgent admission to the urology ward is required. This 
serves two purposes, first is to monitor and correct any diuresis which might ensue

challenge. (a) The prostate can be large enough and become an intra-abdominal organ. (b) A stan-
dard suprapubic catheter in this case is dangerous as it runs the risk of spearing the prostate which 
may result in catastrophic bleeding. To avoid the prostate, the surgeon may have to place the supra-
pubic catheter more proximally on the abdominal wall; this in turn run the risk of bowel injury. A 
more cautious approach would be to insert the suprapubic catheter in the interventional radiology 
suite under imaging guidance

following catheterisation. Post catheterisation diuresis develop almost immediately 
following catheter insertion. A high urine output without adequate compensation in 
fluid intake would rapidly lead to dehydration and hypovolaemia, a dangerous state 
if the patient is at home. Therefore, all patient with suspected diuresis are kept in the 
hospital. Their vital signs and urine output should be monitored hourly in the first few 
hours of diuresis. However fluid replacement strategy should be based on average 
output over several hours rather than very short period. The typical replacement is 
normal oral fluid if the urine output is less than 200 ml/hr. The patient is usually able 
to drink one cup of fluid an hour. If the urine output is higher than 200 mL/h, an iv 
fluid replacement might be necessary with saline. Daily patient weight should be 
measured and recorded in a special log, this will give an indication if the fluid replace-
ment is adequate. Blood electrolyte should be monitored daily till diuresis resolves.
The second purpose of admission is to monitor renal function. Blood creatinine 
level can initially rise sharply. The renal function typically improves to almost pre-
retention level especially if the acute episode was treated promptly with catheterisa-
tion. Patients can present with acute on chronic urinary retention and the renal 
function in such cases may not recover fully. In all cases of urinary retention and renal 
insufficiency the patient is discharged home with indwelling catheter and any attempt 
at removing the catheter without definitive treatment risk further deterioration of 
renal function. A definitive bladder outflow surgery will be required if the patient is 
fit for anaesthetic. The alternative would be prostate artery embolization in selected 
patients, especially the elderly and frail. In some cases the interventional radiology 
specialist will be able to insert a suprapubic catheter at the same sitting of prostate 
artery embolization. The patients who undergo prostate artery embolistation will be 
expected to keep their indwelling catheter for several weeks after the procedure.
2.2.6  Urine Tract Infections
Many patients may present with recurrent lower urine tract infections. This may be 
associated with lower urinary tracts symptoms or not and occasionally patients may 
require hospitalisation for infection treatment in severe cases. Urine infection can 
be caused by stagnation from a high residual volume of urine that is not cleared after 
each void because of bladder outflow obstruction. Patients who require catheterisa-
tion because of retention may develop urinary infection as well. Another cause of 
urine infection can be the presence of bladder stones.
2.2.7  Bladder Stones
The formation of bladder stones is typically uncommon in the modern age however 
patients with a very large prostate are an exception and may develop primary blad-
der stones. Urinary stasis and high residual in addition to recurrent urine tract

infection are predisposing factors. The symptoms can range from storage lower uri-
nary tract symptoms especially dysuria and occasionally recurrent urine tract infec-
tions. Bladder stones occasionally can be asymptomatic if they are small. It is 
important to assess the size and the number of bladder stones as this will have impli-
cation on treatment planning. If bladder calculi are present at the time of bladder 
outflow surgery these can often be managed simultaneously under a single anaes-
thetic. If using a Greenlight PVP system or TURP then a stone punch can be utilised 
to crush the calculi before removal with the Ellick. If performing HoLEP then the 
calculi can be elegantly dusted into small fragments using the same Holmium laser. 
With open or robotic simple prostatectomy then the calculi can be simply lifted out. 
Whichever way the stones are removed it is important to minimise mucosal bleeding 
from sharp stone fragments which can complicate the prostate part of the surgery.
2.3  Elective Presentations
2.3.1  Elevated PSA in the Large Gland
Prostate specific antigen (PSA) level has been shown to correlate with the size of the 
prostate [17]. Roehrborn et al analysed more than 4600 patients from BPH trials and 
found PSA level and the size of the prostate are strongly inter-related. This relation-
ship was independent of prostate cancer but was dependent on age. Older patient 
with larger prostates had higher PSA levels. The largest prostate volume in the trials 
recorded was at 70 g. This has led to the concept of PSA density which is the serum 
total PSA level divided by prostate volume. A value of 0.15 is generally used as the 
threshold level for increased suspicion of prostate cancer. Therefore, very large 
BPH is expected be associated with elevated PSA and in prostates over 100 cc in 
size it is not unusual to find a PSA level of around 10–15 ng/mL or greater, which 
may in fact be normal for a prostate of that size. Patients who are otherwise asymp-
tomatic may therefore present to urologists with an elevated PSA.  This usually 
causes one of the most difficult dilemmas in managing patients with very large 
BPH. In majority of the cases the moderately elevated PSA is a factor of the benign 
enlargement of the gland (Fig. 2.4). However, an elevation of PSA above the normal 
level would traditionally trigger a diagnostic process that would end with a prostate 
biopsy. Patients with very large prostates may be at higher risk for under-sampling 
of the anterior and apical regions and the prostate in general, and thus record false 
negative biopsy results. There is also an increased risk of significant haematuria, 
worsening lower urinary tract symptoms and increased rates of urinary retention 
post biopsies in very large glands. This dilemma is not easily solved as both large 
BPH and prostate cancer are common and can often co-exist. And the management 
should be tailored to each patient. A careful discussion should be undertaken and 
any decision to proceed with prostate biopsies should only be undertaken after full 
counselling ensuring the patient is aware of these specifically increased risks.

A multi- parametric MRI (1.5 or preferably 3 Tesla) with an experienced uro-­
radiologist can play a very helpful role in selecting which patients should go for-
ward to prostate biopsies. As well as showing potential areas of prostate cancer, the 
prostate size and shape, it can also identify signs of bladder outflow obstruction such 
as bladder thickening, calculi, diverticula, hydronephrosis, and prostatic middle 
lobes. Many patients with a reassuring PSA density (<0.15 ng/mL/cc) and no obvi-
ous signs of cancer may be able to avoid biopsy. Indeed a mildly elevated PSA with 
a non-suspicious MRI (PIRADS score 1 or 2) can be safely followed up with regular 
PSA and occasional MRI without the need for prostate biopsies.
2.3.2  Incidental Imaging
Patients who are incidentally found to have a very large prostate can be referred to 
urology services for full lower urinary tract symptoms assessment which may 
include digital rectal examination, serum creatinine, urine analysis, flow rate and 
bladder residual in addition to urinary tract ultrasound scan. Should the patient be 
found not to have any bothersome symptoms with no evidence of bladder outflow 
obstruction then they can be safely followed up with renal function, IPSS score and 
regular flow rate at the primary care level.
Occasionally a bladder ultrasound scan can report a large bladder tumour 
­erroneously which eventually is revealed to be a large middle lobe of the prostate [18].
2.3.3  Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms
Most patients with a very large prostate will experience some lower urinary tract 
symptoms and may present with these issues. Although many men will having primar-
ily voiding symptoms, a high percentage of these patients will have mixed storage and 
voiding symptoms due to excessive voiding pressures causing secondary detrusor 
over-activity. In these patient often the offending element is the very large middle lobe 
that is intruding into the bladder. This intrusion contributes to the storage symptoms 
and medical therapy is usually less effective. The anatomy of the middle lobe is differ-
ent from the lateral lobes of the prostate. The lateral lobes surround the prostatic ure-
thra at the bladder neck where the effect of alpha blockers and 5-alpha reductase 
inhibitors would be maximal. If the clinical assessment reveals a very large prostate 
>100 cc then there should be a low threshold for medical or eventually surgical inter-
vention. Although the usual pathway is to start an alpha-blocker in isolation, these men 
are more likely to benefit from combination therapy with a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor 
initiated at an early stage. This will be more likely to prevent the need for bladder 
outflow surgery and urinary retention. If symptoms fail to respond to medical therapy 
it is often due to a large middle lobe indenting into the trigone, acting like a ball-­valve, 
and cause voiding symptoms. These patients do not usually benefit from medical ther-
apy and are best treated with bladder outflow surgery earlier rather than later.
O. Elhage and B. Challacombe

21
2.3.4  Mass Effect
This is a relatively unusual presentation. Patients can feel a continuous fullness in 
their rectum (tensemus) and complain of difficulty in defecation. This is due to 
the very large prostate filling most of the space in the pelvis in addition to the 
increased voiding pressures at the time of micturition. Some relief will be pro-
vided by medical therapies but there should be a low threshold for bladder out-
flow surgery.
2.3.5  Asymptomatic
Some patients with very large prostate may remain very well without any symp-
toms. In a case reported by Dominguez [7], a patient with a prostate measured at 
almost 4000  mL has remained asymptomatic without any signs of bladder out-
flow obstruction and avoided surgery. However, the patient remained under uro-
logical follow up.
2.4  Summary
•	 Patients with very large prostate can be asymptomatic
•	 Very large prostate can be mistaken for bladder cancer on imaging
•	 Large prostate may require special curved catheters in case of retention
•	 Large prostate can cause problematic recurrent haematuria which can be difficult 
to manage
•	 Blind suprapubic catheterisation is not recommended in men with very large 
prostates
•	 PSA can be elevated in very large prostate; mp-MRI and PSA density can help 
identify patients at risk of prostate cancer

3.1  Introduction
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in European men 
(382,000 new cases annually: 22% of all male cancer cases).
Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), combining anatomic 
and functional imaging techniques for evaluating the prostate is increasingly 
being used in the diagnosis and management of PCa. With the use of mpMRI, the 
accuracy for the diagnosis of PCa has significantly increased in recent years, and 
this has already led to changes in the diagnostic pathway [1–4]. In addition, the 
implementation of a standardized classification system (PI-RADS) has led to more 
consistent reporting and aided the dissemination of mpMRI [5, 6]. A wide spec-
trum of anatomic and pathologic processes within the prostate may masquerade 
as PCa, complicating the interpretation of MRI [7]. These entities include the 
anterior fibromuscular stroma (AFMS), the central zone (CZ), benign prostatic 
hyperplasia (BPH), atrophy, necrosis, calcification, hemorrhage and prostatitis [7]. 
Understanding of the prostate zonal anatomy and pathophysiology is helpful to dis-
tinguish benign entities from PCa. The AFMS and CZ are characteristic anatomic 
features of the prostate associated with a low T2 signal intensity due to dense fibro-
muscular or complex crowded glandular tissue [7–9]. BPH, atrophy, necrosis, calci-
fication, and hemorrhage all have characteristic features with one or more specific 
mpMRI modalities [7, 8]. It is important for both radiologists and urologists to be

familiar with specific benign imaging findings when interpreting not only prostate 
MR images, but also ultrasound (US). In this chapter, we focus not only on these 
imaging findings, but also on the correlation of MRI findings with the International 
Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and on the role of MRI in the follow-up of medical 
or interventional treatment of BPH.

Prostate volume estimates are becoming more important because the choice of 
treatment is increasingly based on such estimates [10]. Digital-rectal examina-
tion (DRE) is the simplest way to assess prostate volume, but the correlation to 
prostate volume is poor [10, 11]. Quality-control procedures for DRE have been 
described [12]. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) is more accurate in determining 
prostate volume than DRE. Underestimation of prostate volume by DRE increases 
with increasing TRUS volume, particularly where the volume is >30 mL [13]. In 
routine clinical practice, methods that can accurately estimate the degree of 
prostatic enlargement in individuals (in contrast to the exact volume) are suffi-
cient if one wants to avoid overtreating or undertreating a significant percentage 
of men [14]. However, even TRUS misses accurate exact volume estimation [15]. 
Imaging very enlarged prostates up to 100 mL seems challenging on TRUS and the 
diagnostic workflow in urology practice is unclear [16] (Fig. 3.1).

Often an enlarged prostate is firstly diagnosed adjacently on computed tomography 
[17]. Because of its inferior soft tissue contrast, compared to MRI or TRUS is not con-
sidered the primary imaging method when examining the prostate [17].
Whereas Roehrborn et al. analysed that the accuracy and reproducibility of TRUS in 
enlarged prostates is not inferior in smaller ones, Stravodimos et al. demonstrated that 
the accuracy of TRUS is higher in prostates below 80 mL compared to larger ones [16, 
18]. To our knowledge, only this study analyzed median prostate volumes above 100 mL 
[16]. They demonstrated a miscategorization rate (below or above 80 cc, derived from the 
EAU guideline recommendation on open or endourologic treatment for benign prostate 
hyperplasia) of 13% [16, 19]. However, compared to transabdominal US, the correlation 
of TRUS-measured volume to histopathology specimen volume was significantly higher 
[16]. In conclusion, TRUS could probably be considered as a standard means of evalu-
ation for a BPH patient population [16]. One study compared MRI and TRUS in enlarged 
prostates, however, the median volume did not reach 100 mL (39 mL) [20]. They found a 
higher correlation for MRI and histopathology volume compared to TRUS [20] (Fig. 3.2).

In addition, MRI slightly overestimated the exact volume by 1.4  mL, while 
TRUS underestimated it by 3.4 mL [20]. The presence of a median lobe is a signifi-
cant predictor of accurate prostate volume measurement for both MRI and TRUS 
and may lead to volume overestimation when using the prolate ellipsoid formula 
[20].
Besides the volume measurement of MRI alone, the diagnostic accuracy of dif-
ferent modalities varies for enlarged versus smaller prostates.
Regarding PCa detection, both sensitivity and specificity of systematic TRUS 
guided biopsy decreased as the prostate enlarged, especially for prostates greater 
than 40 mL [21, 22]. Several groups reported a PCa detection rate less than 30% for 
prostates greater than 40 mL compared to a higher detection rate for smaller glands 
[22–24].
Multiparametric MRI is increasingly recognized as a method of detecting PCa, 
especially in men with an enlarged gland [25–27].
Publications on differences of functional imaging for BPH, especially transition 
zone (TZ) or CZ changes, between different prostate volumes are lacking.
However, for urologists it is important to know strengths and limitations of func-
tional ultrasound and MR imaging and to choose the right imaging modality for 
their specific question. The following sections elucidate functional imaging of both 
ultrasound (mainly TRUS) and MRI for enlarged prostates. It is important to 
acknowledge that these suggestions on different modalities in specific situations are 
not hierarchical. TRUS has been the most common and initially applied imaging 
modality for prostate diseases, being available in most private practices and hospi-
tals. Recently, new concepts are posed to improve its diagnostic efficacy even in 
specific functional questions. Based on an accurate size estimation using TRUS, 
urologists should be able to choose an appropriate imaging modality to answer their 
clinical question (B-plane or color-doppler US and native or functional MRI with or 
without contrast agent) (Fig. 3.3).

3.3  Resistive Index Measurement by Doppler
Some authors emphasized on the relationship between transitional zone index (tran-
sitional zone volume/total prostatic volume) and obstructive symptoms, mechanical 
bladder outlet obstruction, or acute urinary retention [28, 29]. Doppler TRUS pro-
vides information about prostate blood flow [30]. The prostate blood supply comes 
from urethral and capsular arteries. Enlarged transitional zone compresses the surgi-
cal capsule, so the vascular resistance in capsular artery will rise. This can be mea-
sured by Power Doppler.
Shinbo et al. studied a relationship between resistance index [(peak systolic velocity−
end diastolic velocity)/peak systolic velocity], with BOO and risk of acute urinary 
retention in patients with BPH [29, 31]. They pointed out that resistance index with 
cut-off value of more than 0.75 is a more reliable predictor of BOO than international 
prostate symptom score (IPSS), post-void residual and transitional zone index [29, 31].
3.4  Presumed Circle Area Ratio and Capsule Elasticity
As prostate enlarges, the pressure transfers to the surgical capsule and finally at one 
point the capsule cannot stretch more, then prostate begins to transform to a circular 
shape [30]. The diversity in the elastic characteristic of surgical capsule affects this 
process and the final outcome will vary in different patients [30].
Presumed circle area ratio (PCAR) is calculated where the horizontal section of 
prostate in TRUS shows the biggest surface [30]. Then the ratio of this surface to 
the presumed circle with the same circumference will be calculated [30]. St 
Sauver et al. designed a cross-sectional study of 328 Caucasian men residing in 
Olmsted County, Minnesota [32]. They measured IPSS, post-void residual, peak 
flow rate, and PCAR. A PCAR greater than 0.9 correlates with symptom score after 
adjusting for age and prostate volume, but it might not provide more useful pre-
dictive information than the transitional zone volume [32].
3.5  Intraprostatic Protrusion
Intraprostatic protrusion (IPP) is mentioned as a predictive factor of obstruction in 
several studies. It can be performed either transabdominally or transrectally. Lee 
et al. investigated 256 patients with LUTS and BPH by abdominal ultrasound [33]. 
They measured IPP and categorized them into three subgroups: Grade 1, less than 
5 mm; grade 2, 5–10 mm; and grade 3, more than 10 mm [33]. The patients received 
watchful waiting, alpha-blocker, or 5ARI. The authors found a relationship between 
a higher IPP grade and a higher risk of clinical progression regardless of the treat-
ment types [33].

3.6  Imaging of Benign Hyperplasia: Anatomy  
of the Central Zone
The CZ is a layer of tissue that surrounds the ejaculatory ducts from the level of the 
prostatic base down to the verumontanum [10]. It is most prominent at the prostatic 
base and has a conical shape, with its apex at the verumontanum [10, 11]. 
Embryologically, the CZ originates from the Wolffian duct, whereas the TZ is a deriv-
ative of the urogenital sinus [10]. Because of its high epithelial-to-stroma ratio, the 
CZ accounts for 25% of the total prostate volume but almost 40% of the epithelium 
[34]. The CZ volume starts to decrease gradually after the age of 35 years due to 
reduced mean glandular activity, reduction of acinar size, and epithelial atrophy [35].
Compared to the peripheral zone, the glands of the CZ are larger and more com-
plex, with tall columnar cells and papillary folding [35]. CZ PCa are rare, account-
ing for approximately 1–2% of all PCa and 3–8% of index tumors [36]. Beside their 
rarity, CZ PCa are usually associated with a high incidence of seminal vesicle inva-
sion, extracapsular extension, high Gleason grade, and early biochemical failure 
after radical prostatectomy [36, 37] (Fig. 3.4).
On MR imaging, the normal CZ appears homogeneously hypointense on 
T2-weighted imaging with low ADC values on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) 
in patients between 42 and 84 years of age [7, 39, 40]. As PCa carries as similar 
signature, correct anatomical identification of the CZ is necessary to avoid misdi-

agnosis. Features that allow distinction of the CZ are the symmetric appearance and 
its typical shape and location [40]. It is important to notice that in 20% of cases the 
CZ may be asymmetric, increasing difficulty of assessment [40]. An enlarged TZ 
can lead to compression of the CZ. At DCE imaging, the CZ has been shown to be 
associated with type 1 (progressive) and type 2 (early enhancement and plateau 
phase) rather than type 3 (early enhancement and washout) enhancement curve 
types [7] (Fig. 3.5).
BPH is defined as enlargement of the TZ and characterized by hyperplasia of 
both prostatic stromal and epithelial cells, resulting in formation of large discrete 
nodules [35]. Histologically, BPH nodules appear as stromal or glandular 
­proliferation or dilatation and fibromuscular proliferation of the stroma [35]. This 
composition results in a typical heterogeneous appearance of BPH on T2-weighted 
images [41].
On MRI, BPH nodules may occur as hypo-, iso-, or hyperintense on T2-weighted 
imaging, depending on the ratio of glandular to stromal tissue [7, 42]. Kitzing et al. 
stated that high signal intensity is due to hyperplastic glandular elements, which are 
filled with secretions, and the presence of cystic ductal ectasia [7]. Cystic/glandular 
BPH nodules are very often present on imaging and can be straightforwardly dif-
ferentiated from PCa due to their typical imaging appearance. Stromal BPH may 
mimic PCa due to its low and sometimes irregular T2 signal and the presence of 
unsharp lesion margins without well-defined capsule (Fig. 3.6).

3.7  Imaging Benign Prostate Hyperplasia and  
Correlation of MRI and International Prostate  
Symptom Score (IPSS)
Traditionally, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) has been used when imaging evalua-
tion of BPH is required. The increased use of MRI is mainly geared toward its abil-
ity to detect, localize and grade PCa [43]. BPH is imaged on MRI most commonly 
as an incidental finding in patients with a clinical suspicion of PCa, a common 
occurrence as the BPH is the most common contributor to PSA increases apart from 
PCa. BPH is therefore a frequent confounder of MRI interpretation for PCa and 
excellent understanding of the MR imaging appearance is required for high-quality 
prostate MRI reporting. The study of BPH therefore furthers both, the diagnostic 
ability of MRI for the detection of PCa and the understanding of BPH itself. As 
such, MRI has been recently used to refine BPH classification. According to 
Wasserman et al. BPH types on MRI are defined as follows: Type 0, an equal to or 
less than 25 cm3 prostate showing little or no zonal enlargement, Type 1: bilateral 
TZ enlargement (35%), Type 2: retrourethral enlargement (10%), Type 3: bilateral 
TZ and retrourethral enlargement (46%), Type 4: solitary or multiple pedunculated 
enlargement, Type 5: pedunculated with bilateral TZ and/or retrourethral enlarge-
ment; Type 6: subtrigonal or ectopic enlargement and Type 7: other combinations of 
enlargements [44, 45] (Fig. 3.7).
MR imaging is not only able to depict BPH in a structured manner, but results 
derived from MRI can be correlated with the IPSS: Guneyli et  al. analyzed the 
­correlation of total prostate volume (TPV), TZ volume (TZV), IPP, prostatic urethra 
angle, bladder wall thickness, urethral changes and BPH with total IPSS in 61

patients. They found that TPV, TZV, IPP, AFMS changes and BPH type derived from 
MRI correlated significantly with IPSS [46]. In multiple linear regression analysis, 
TZV was the only predictor for total IPSS the scores for the IPSS questions 1 and 4 
[46]. Thus, one can consider MRI findings when making treatment decisions in BPH.
3.8  Benign Pathologies That Mimic Prostate Cancer: 
Differentiating Benign from Malignant Lesions 
(Table 3.1)
Adenosis and HG-PIN are known to mimic PCa on histological evaluation [8, 34, 
47]. However, these mimickers also appear to show similar characteristics on 
mpMRI, together with severe inflammation and with well differentiated PCa [8].
Within a mpMRI examination of the prostate high-resolution T2-WI and at least 
two functional MRI techniques are provided: To characterise the prostatic vascular 
pharmacokinetic features DCE-MRI is used. It consists of a series of axial T1-WI 
gradient echo sequences during and after i.v. bolus injection of gadolinium based 
contrast medium. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) with different b-values reflect-
ing the strength and timing of the gradient used to generate the images measures the 
motion of water molecules within a voxel of tissue which then can be quantified in 
apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps.
Adenosis, HG-PIN, severe inflammation and well differentiated PCa may all occur 
as homogenous isointense or hypointense lesions on T2-WI, usually multifocal, with 
moderate to low ADC values and moderate SI on high-b-value images [8]. In addi-
tion, all may show contrast enhancement with a plateau shape of the DCE curve (Type 
II curve) and with peak enhancement higher than that of normal glands [8].

De Visschere et al. published that high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia 
(PIN) HG-PIN was found in some cases histologically [8]. However, these high-­
grade PINs were usually pinpoint-sized and nearly impossible to recognize on 
mpMRI, unless they were contrasted by surrounding structures with remarkably dif-
ferent signal intensities (SI) [8, 48]. On DWI, a considerable overlap in ADC values 
between inflammation and PCa has been reported, although ADC values are gener-
ally lower in case of PCa. The restricted diffusion in (peri)glandular inflammation 
may be explained by the high density of inflammatory cells [8, 49]. In the mpMRI 
PI-RADS scoring system such lesions are assigned a Likert score of 3, indicating that 
the presence of a clinically significant PCa is indeterminate [6, 50]. Poorly differenti-
ated cancers are usually easier to discriminate from benign lesions, in particular if 
they present as compact and dense lesions located in the peripheral zone [47, 51]. 
AFMS and fibromuscular hyperplasia show similar very low SI and may act as con-
founders of poorly differentiated PCa on T2-weighted imaging [52, 53]. The AFMS 
is characterised as a crescent or spindle-shaped structure covering the prostate ante-
riorly [54]. Fibromuscular hyperplasia as part of BPH may occur in the TZ on 
T2-weighted imaging as a markedly hypointense round nodule, sharply demarcated 
with bulging towards the surrounding tissue [8]. Thus, DWI may be helpful in doubt-
ful cases [8]. On DWI, poorly differentiated PCa, fibromuscular stroma and fibro-
muscular hyperplasia all occur with low ADC values, but on high-b-value imaging 
fibromuscular stroma and hyperplasia show moderate SI, whereas poorly differenti-
ated PCa shows high SI, allowing differentiation of these lesions in many cases [8].

Overall, in areas with indistinct low SI on T2-weighted imaging, slightly 
decreased ADC value, contrast enhancement and slightly decreased citrate peaks it 
is virtually impossible to discriminate a benign lesion from well-­differentiated can-
cer, but poorly differentiated cancers can be usually detected even in an enlarged 
prostate [49] (Fig. 3.8).

3.9  5-Alpha Reductase Blockade, Alpha-1 Antagonists 
and Prostatic Artery Embolization: Monitoring  
Using MRI
MRI is not only a reliable tool for the diagnosis of BPH and its distinction from 
PCa, it may also be used to evaluate the efficacy of BPH treatment, such as 5-alpha 
reductase blockade and prostatic artery embolization (PAE).
In a canine model, Jia et al. demonstrated that DCE, and in particular the phar-
macokinetic maximum enhancement ratio (MER) correlated with decreased paren-
chyma after finasteride treatment [55]. In their study, the therapy-induced prostate 
volume changes under finasteride treatment were assessed [55]. The changes in 
prostate volume at the end of the trial exhibited a significant linear correlation to the 
initial parenchymal MER (p = 0.02) in the finasteride group [55]. The authors con-
clude that the parenchymal MER in DCE-MRI exhibits a significant linear relation-
ship to the change in prostate volume and that these findings show great promise in 
using the pharmacokinetic parameter as a predictor of subject response to 5a-reduc-
tase inhibitors [55]. In contrast to the previous results, Isen et al. analyzed if clinical 
outcome after terazosin treatment can be measured using MRI and found no statisti-
cally significant relationship between the clinical outcome of terazosin and the MRI 
findings [56].
PAE is a minimally invasive therapy that has been shown to be safe and effective 
for relief from LUTS associated with BPH [57, 58].
Several publications analyzed the utility of MRI in the follow-up and monitoring 
after PAE. Frenk et al. analyzed a cohort of 17 men following PAE for a follow-­up 
period of 18 months [59]. They stated that prostatic infarcts were seen in 71% of 
patients, exclusively in the central gland, and that these were almost always charac-
terized by hyperintensity on T1-weighted images and predominant hypointensity on 
T2-weighted images. Volume reduction of the prostate on MRI after PAE was sig-
nificant (average 32% after 12–18 months; p < 0.001) only in patients with infarcts 
[59]. MRI was not only used in the intermediate- and long-­term follow-up, but also 
to analyze PAE outcome in the early post-treatment phase. Kisilevzky et al. ana-
lyzed a cohort of 24 men after PAE [60]. Prostate volume decreased 24% in success-
fully treated patients versus 16% (p = 0.03) in the unsuccessful cases [60]. The 
presence of ischemia on postoperative MRI and the MRI-measured volume were 
significant predictors of a successful PAE on multivariate analysis [60].
To summarize, parenchymal MER in DCE-MRI might be a valuable predictor of 
patient response to 5a-reductase inhibitors but so far no other MRI parameters 
have been found predicting or monitoring patients clinical outcome according to 
IPSS after BPH treatment with 5a-reductase inhibitors or PAE.

3.10  MRI, TRUS and MRI/TRUS-Fusion Biopsies 
in Enlarged Prostates: Are There Any Differences 
Compared to Smaller Organs?
Initial studies to investigate differences in diagnostic accuracy between regular and 
enlarged prostates were performed with prostate volume as primary endpoint [18, 
61]. Both publications analyzed the correlation coefficients for inter-­reader repro-
ducibility of TRUS-measured prostate volumes [18, 61]. The correlation coeffi-
cients ranged from 0.61 to 0.72 for three examiners [18]. Total prostate volume 
reproducibility was higher for prostate volume greater than 40 mL compared to 
smaller prostates [61]. Regarding PCa detection, both sensitivity and specificity of 
systematic TRUS guided biopsy decreased as the prostate enlarged, especially for 
prostates greater than 40 mL [21, 22]. Several groups reported a PCa detection rate 
less than 30% for prostates greater than 40 mL compared to a higher detection rate 
for smaller glands [22–24]. Most authors hypothesize that this is related to sam-
pling error since core biopsies are obtained randomly in the prostate gland and 
lesions are often small, heterogeneous and not uniformly distributed [27, 62]. In 
addition it is proposed that the increased amount of glandular tissue in larger pros-
tates increases the potential of harboring more PCa [27]. When a standardized num-
ber of biopsy cores is taken, larger prostates may possibly predispose to 
undersampling [27]. Thus, in men with BPH PCa may remain undiagnosed for 
longer periods of time [27]. These patients commonly undergo multiple biopsy 
attempts, extended or even saturation biopsies with the resultant increased risk of 
procedure related complications [62]. Multiparametric MRI is increasingly recog-
nized as a method of detecting PCa, especially in men with an enlarged gland [25, 
26, 63, 64].
The detection rate of TRUS guided biopsy for prostate glands greater than 40 mL 
is considerably lower than for glands smaller than 40 mL [27]. A detection rate 
ranging from 40% in glands less than 34 mL to 24% in glands greater than 64 mL 
was reported by Ung et al. in a cohort of 750 consecutive patients with a median 
prostate volume of 45 mL [22]. Yoon et al. similarly noted a yield ranging from 30% 
in glands less than 40 mL to 27% for a prostate volume of 40 mL or greater in a 
cohort of 474 patients [24]. Even when performing 20-core TRUS guided biopsy, 
Werahera et al. reported a 26% PCa detection rate in men with a prostate of greater 
than 50 mL [23]. However, when using MRI/TRUS-fusion biopsies, Walton-Diaz 
et al. demonstrated a higher PCa detection rate of 48% for glands of 40 mL or 
greater compared to the previous TRUS controls using MRI/TRUS-fusion biopsies 
[27]. They added that the detection rate of high-risk PCa using MR/TRUS-fusion 
did not decrease with enlarged prostate volume [27]. In addition, the authors dem-
3  Imaging of the Large Prostate

36
onstrated that MRI/TRUS-fusion biopsies showed superior PCa detection compared 
to extended sextant TRUS guided biopsy [27]. Also, de Gorski et al. analyzed the 
utility of MRI/TRUS-fusion biopsies compared to 12-core standard TRUS biopsies 
for the detection of PCa in enlarged prostates (greater 40 mL) in a cohort of 232 
men [65]. They found that differences in ­prostate cancer detection rates between the 
standard and targeted protocols were not significant for patients with a prostate 
volume of 40 mL or less (p = 0.8) [65]. Conversely 12 patients with a prostate vol-
ume greater than 40 mL had clinically significant PCa using the targeted but not the 
standard protocol and in 3 PCa was detected by the standard but not the targeted 
protocol (p = 0.04) [65]. They conclude that in prostates greater than 40 mL, it may 
be necessary to systematically perform MRI/TRUS-fusion biopsies rather than sys-
tematic biopsies as a first line approach to ensure accurate diagnosis [65].
Particularly in the enlarged prostate, MRI/TRUS-fusion biopsies may offer many 
advantages when compared to conventional TRUS guided biopsy, but the ideal pro-
tocol is still yet to be established.
3.11  Conclusion
When patients with enlarged prostates present, the initial imaging modality might 
be transabdominal US or TRUS. TRUS accurately examines the prostate volume. 
Furthermore, it can provide information on the blood flow, measured by resistive 
index, which can be, in case of an increased resistive index, a surrogate of an 
enlarged TZ. Also the PCAR can be derived from TRUS and correlates well with the 
IPSS. Lastly, IPP, measured by US, correlates well with the clinical progression risk 
of BPH. In the evaluation of patients with clinical symptoms or unclear PSA eleva-
tion, TRUS provides important and accurate information about prostate volume, 
allowing to put clinical and PSA findings into context and calculate PSA density.
For further detail or to distinguish between benign and malignant findings and 
for treatment follow-up, MRI is a useful modality. On MR imaging the normal CZ 
appears homogeneously hypointense on T2-weighted imaging and with low ADC 
values on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and should be distinguished from PCa 
by its typical location and morphology. BPH often demonstrates typical hypo-, iso-, 
or hyperintense nodules on T2-weighted imaging, however irregular margins and 
low T2 signal may represent diagnostic challenges especially for stromal 
BPH. Furthermore, adenosis and HG-PIN are known PCa mimickers on MRI and 
their accurate differentiation from PCa is not always possible due to an overlap in 
MR imaging characteristics. After treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia, MRI 
can be used as a reliable tool for follow-up, demonstrating typical imaging findings 
such as prostatic infarcts. Quantitative color-imaged morphometric analysis on MRI 
has shown ability to predict positive IPSS outcome after 5-alpha reductase 
blockade.
In case of remaining PCa suspicion, the very large prostate in particular should 
be investigated using mpMRI, with the option for further targeted biopsies to

Management of an Elevated PSA and Biopsy 
Strategies in the Large Prostate

4.1  Large Prostates and Elevated PSA
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a glycoproteic enzyme produced almost 
­exclusively by the prostate. PSA is secreted into prostatic gland ducts and is respon-
sible for hydrolysing the seminal clot, enabling sperm motility. In physiological 
conditions, only a small amount of PSA reaches intravascular circulation [1]. 
However, serum PSA levels can increase due to a rise in PSA production, an increase 
in vascular permeability, or due to disruption of tissue architecture. Thus, both 
benign and malignant prostatic diseases, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia 
(BPH), prostatitis, and prostate cancer, can be associated with increased PSA serum 
levels [1–3].
In a large proportion of men, aging is associated with hyperplasia of the stromal 
and glandular components of the transition zone leading to prostatic enlargement, 
also known as BPH [4–6]. Men with BPH not only have a higher baseline serum 
PSA before 50 years old, but are also more likely to see it increase over time [2, 
7–9]. Additionally, BPH and higher prostate volumes correlate with the presence of 
prostate inflammation [10], a factor known to also lead to increased serum PSA 
readings [3].
A high serum PSA (e.g. above 3 ng/mL) is still the most frequent trigger for men 
to enter a suspected prostate cancer diagnostic pathway. Thus, if BPH is associated 
with increased PSA levels, a significant proportion of men with large prostates will 
be lead to have additional diagnostic tests, such as a prostate multiparametric MRI 
(mpMRI) and/or prostate biopsy. This represents a source of anxiety for those men 
as well as a burden for health care systems. However, to complicate things further,

relying solely on prostate volume to deny further diagnostic testing may be unwise 
as BPH and prostate cancer can co-exist and large-scale epidemiologic studies have 
shown that men with BPH may even be more likely to have prostate cancer [11]. 
Consequently, to achieve a balance between appropriate testing to identify clinically 
significant cancer and unnecessary testing which can lead directly and indirectly to 
harm, PSA readings need to be put into context and prostate volume is one of the 
factors to take into account.
Aiming to correctly distinguish between BPH and prostate cancer in men with 
elevated serum PSA, urologists and researchers have studied a number of PSA 
derivatives that incorporate prostate volume, such as PSA density or PSA transi-
tion zone density, have analysed PSA trends over time (PSA kinetics), have looked 
at different PSA isoforms, such as free PSA, and have incorporated a multitude of 
clinical factors, including prostate volume, into risk stratification tools. A closer 
look at all of these variables is warranted to assess how they can benefit clinical 
decision making in men with large prostates.
4.1.1  PSA Density and PSA Transition Zone Density  
in Large Prostates
Early studies suggest that BPH is associated with lower levels of serum PSA per 
volume unit of prostate than cancer (0.3 ng/mL/cc versus 3.5 ng/mL/cc) [12]. While 
increased serum PSA in BPH is associated with prostatic growth and higher PSA 
production, in prostate cancer this is thought to primarily relate to disruption of tis-
sue architecture (namely the basal cell layer) rather than to changes in PSA produc-
tion [1]. Thus, it was hypothesised that the quotient between total serum PSA and 
prostate volume, known as PSA density, and the quotient between total serum PSA 
and prostatic transition zone volume, known as PSA transition zone density, could 
be useful tools to discriminate men with high PSA readings who need further inves-
tigations for suspected prostate cancer from those who could avoid it.
In the early 1990s, studies based on transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) prostate vol-
ume assessment set a threshold of PSA density above 0.15 to advise men with serum 
PSA between 4 and 20 ng/mL to have a prostate biopsy [13, 14]. Likewise, it has 
been suggested that in men with raised PSA (up to 10 ng/mL), even if it is above the 
age-adjusted cut-off levels, a PSA density below 0.15 can lead to avoidance of 
unnecessary prostate biopsies [15]. However, the utility of PSA density has been 
undermined by further reports stating that this threshold is inadequate [16] or may 
only be valid for men with prostate volumes below 35 cc [17], that PSA density 
increases with age [2], and that in men with prostatic inflammation, a feature very 
commonly associated with BPH [10], PSA density may also be higher [3, 18]. 
Similarly, while some studies have proposed that PSA transition zone density has a 
better predictive value than PSA density alone [19–22], others have not confirmed 
this [23–25].
J.B. Neves et al.

43
To date, neither PSA density nor PSA transition zone density have translated into 
routine clinical practice or clinical guidelines to definitively distinguish men with 
BPH from men with prostate cancer. However, they can be useful to make manage-
ment decisions when considered alongside a full clinical picture.
Many studies looking at PSA density and PSA transition zone density have 
excluded men with PSA levels above 10 ng/mL. As men with very large prostates 
(>100  cc) are more likely to have serum PSA values well above the 3  ng/mL 
threshold and often at or above 10 ng/mL, the ability to draw conclusions on the 
role of these derivatives in the very large prostate is limited.
Nevertheless, with the increasing use of prostate mpMRI, the two biomarkers 
may see a resurgence since PSA levels interpreted adjusting for MRI volume infor-
mation appear to improve the diagnosis of high grade prostate cancer [26] and PSA 
density seems to increase the diagnostic accuracy of MRI when images are equivo-
cal [27]. An example would be a man with a raised PSA (e.g. 4 ng/mL) who has a 
multi-parametric MRI that reveals no suspicious areas in a 120 cc ­prostate. In the 
context of the negative MRI carried out at an expert centre, knowledge that the PSA 
density is very low (0.03  ng/mL/cc) may influence the clinician to counsel the 
patient to avoid a prostate biopsy. Thus, mpMRI of the prostate can play a very 
important role in managing an elevated PSA in men with large prostates >100 cc.
4.1.1.1  PSA Kinetics in Large Prostates
In both BPH and prostate cancer, serial measurement of serum PSA can show 
increased readings over time, a phenomenon known as increased PSA velocity [28]. 
While PSA velocity tends to be higher in men with prostate cancer [28, 29], a trend 
towards a similar pattern may also be seen in men with benign prostates over 60 cc 
in volume [30]. Additionally, inflammation can lead to both dramatic PSA rises, and 
thus to very high PSA velocities [31], and to PSA fluctuation, whereby consecutive 
PSA readings oscillate between a range of values over time (for example, between 
3 and 5). PSA fluctuation, possibly due to the connection between BPH and sub-
clinical inflammation, is a feature frequently seen in men with BPH [28] and pros-
tate volumes over 100 cc [32]. Therefore, PSA velocity may be a misleading marker 
in BPH, particularly in the very large prostate over 100 cc, and longitudinal assess-
ment of PSA readings is essential to distinguish between increased PSA velocity 
and PSA fluctuation.
Many different formulas have been used to calculate PSA velocity [33, 34] and 
attempts have been made to simplify the concept by using alternative definitions, 
such as PSA doubling time (i.e. the time interval it takes for PSA to reach double its 
initial value) [28]. PSA sampling frequency and overall time period of observation 
have an effect on PSA velocity assessment [35], and a definitive cut off is yet to be 
defined. Similarly, controversy regarding the clinical value of using PSA kinetics 
has built up. While a systematic review concluded that PSA velocity is outperformed 
by elevated PSA as a trigger to decide whether a men should enter a prostate cancer

indicated that men have an increased risk of harbouring prostate cancer if they have 
two consecutive PSA velocity calculations above 0.4 ng/mL/year [29]. Despite the 
difference in opinions, experts seem to agree that longitudinal monitoring of PSA 
can aid clinical decision making and that, while PSA velocity should not be consid-
ered as a standalone marker, it can be a useful tool to tailor PSA surveillance in men 
without prostate cancer (i.e. men with higher PSA velocities should have a closer 
PSA follow up) [29, 34].
4.1.2  Free PSA in Large Prostates
PSA is produced as a proenzyme, proPSA. Thus, the molecule needs to be cleaved 
to become active. As PSA enters blood vessels, proteins bind to it in an effort to 
reduce its proteolytic activity (complexed PSA). ProPSA and inactive forms of PSA 
can circulate unbound (free PSA) [36]. Both complexed and free PSA can be 
accounted for when measuring total serum PSA but free PSA can also be read on its 
own. A low ratio between free and total PSA (free/total PSA) has been associated 
with prostate cancer due to mechanisms still to be thoroughly explained. A free/total 
ratio of less than 0.12 was initially defined as being associated with a higher risk of 
cancer [37, 38] but subsequent studies have proposed cut-offs of less than 0.25 
[39–41]. At present, free/total PSA should only be used as a complement to total 
PSA [42], as different cut offs for the first may be needed in view of the magnitude 
of the second [43]. Similarly, free PSA fluctuates over time [42], so repeat readings 
may be necessary for accurate assessment of the ratio. Finally, free PSA may be 
increased in the presence of prostatic inflammation [3] (a phenomenon not uncom-
monly associated with BPH) and, in men with prostates over 40 cc in volume, free/
total PSA may not help differentiate between BPH alone and prostate cancer [38], 
limiting the utility of this tool in men with large prostates and elevated PSA.
4.1.3  Prostate Cancer Screening Risk Stratification Tools  
That Incorporate Prostate Volume
A multitude of risk stratification tools have been developed with the aim of improv-
ing prostate cancer screening. A recent meta-analysis reviewed the most commonly 
studied and validated models [44]. Age, PSA and digital rectal examination (DRE) 
findings were factored into almost all tools and prostate volume (assessed using 
TRUS) was also taken into consideration in three of them: Prostata Class, the Finne 
model, and the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer 
(ERSPC) risk calculator (RC) 3 [44]. In ProstataClass [45], the Finne model [46], 
and the ERSPC RC 3 [47, 48], a higher prostate volume contributes to a lower likeli-
hood of having prostate cancer. Conducting prostate volume assessments with TRUS

45
may be burdensome, especially in primary care, but an additional analysis on the 
ERSPC model showed that estimating volume using DRE still increased predictive 
accuracy when compared to using only a combination of the other variables [48].
In this meta-analysis, ProstataClass and ERSPC RC 3 were the best performing 
models and their use showed improved accuracy in predicting the presence of can-
cer compared to using PSA values, DRE or prostate volume alone [44]. Despite this 
fact, screening risk stratification tools are still not systematically used in clinical 
practice and elevated serum PSA remains the main indication for prostate biopsy 
[49]. Given that these risk stratification tools were developed using cohorts with a 
median prostate volume between 30 and 50  cc [45, 46, 48], further analysis is 
needed to assess if there is benefit of using them in men with large prostates (over 
100 cc in volume). Other PSA derivatives that have shown promise and may be use-
ful adjuncts in guiding management decisions for biopsy in the large prostate 
include the prostate health index (PHI), which is a formula that combines total PSA, 
free PSA and [-2] proPSA, which has shown good performance in identifying high 
grade prostate cancer [50]. Additionally, Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 (PCA3), a urine 
based biomarker, may be particularly useful for guiding prostate biopsy decisions in 
the large prostate, as unlike PSA, its value is not thought to be associated with pros-
tate volume [51].
4.1.4  Summary
Evidence is either insufficient or contradictory regarding the benefit of using PSA 
density, PSA transition zone density, PSA kinetics, free PSA, and risk stratification 
tools to help differentiate between BPH and cancer-bearing prostates in men 
with elevated serum PSA. To complicate things further, very limited data is avail-
able specifically for men with large prostates (over 100 cc). Today, clinical deci-
sion cannot be based solely on these factors, but in men with large prostates and 
elevated PSA levels the following seem to point to a lower likelihood of harbouring 
prostate cancer: presence of acute or chronic inflammation in previous biopsy [10, 
52], low PSA density, low PSA transition zone density, null or low PSA velocity, 
long PSA doubling time, and high free/total PSA. Prostate mpMRI is one of the 
most promising modalities for men with a large prostate greater than 100 cc. Its use 
in conjunction with PSA may lead to improved discrimination of men that are likely 
to have prostate cancer and should proceed to prostate biopsy.
4.2  Biopsy Strategies in Men with Large Prostates
Men with large prostates are more likely to have increased serum PSA readings and 
thus, according to current guidelines, more prone to be offered a prostate biopsy to 
exclude prostate cancer [53]. This is particularly the case with prostates over the 
4  Management of an Elevated PSA and Biopsy Strategies in the Large Prostate

46
100 cc volume threshold. Likewise, men with large prostates are more likely to have 
repeat prostate biopsies after a first negative result [54]. Evidence for the optimal 
biopsy strategy in men with big prostates is limited as they are often excluded from 
diagnostic trials.
Traditionally, prostate biopsies involved sextant transrectal prostate sampling 
under TRUS guidance. Since 1995, multiple publications reported that this biopsy 
scheme lead to prostate undersampling and consequently underdiagnosis of prostate 
cancer in large prostates (from 40 to over 80 cc in volume) [55–58]. Despite some 
authors advocating that sampling density had no effect on diagnosis [53], in 2006 it 
was established that 10–12 core TRUS guided biopsies should be advised due to 
higher malignancy detection rates compared to sextant biopsies [49, 59].
In large prostates, the matter of sampling density is even more controversial. 
Some studies imply that 10–12 transrectal biopsy cores may not be enough for large 
prostates [60] and that more intensive biopsy protocols should be used as first or 
second-line prostate biopsy options—either using saturation techniques [61] or 
biopsy schemes adjusted to prostate volume [62, 63]. Nevertheless, opposing evi-
dence supports the concept that increasing the number of biopsy cores in large pros-
tates may only contribute to higher diagnosis of clinically insignificant low volume 
Gleason 6 [54, 64] while carrying a higher adverse event rate [65]. Biopsy of large 
volume prostates is associated with more frequent haematuria, haematospermia, uri-
nary retention, and pain [65], and these risks could potentially increase with more 
sampling intensive procedures.
An alternative way of increasing sampling density of larger prostates is to carry 
out transperineal template prostate biopsies (TTPB) using a brachytherapy grid [66]. 
This approach allows for a more systematic sampling of the prostate, with improved 
access to anterior and midline areas. Notwithstanding, it is resource intensive, 
requiring general or spinal anaesthetic [66], and, due to the increasing sampling, it 
is more prone to causing unwanted side effects [65]. Additionally, this strategy does 
not negate the problem of overdiagnosing insignificant cancer, but may maximise 
the identification of clinically significant cancer [67], which can be of value when 
clinical doubt exists.
Using the transrectal approach, due to limitations in needle length, it is often dif-
ficult to sample the anterior zone of large prostates. While the transperineal route 
can aid in sampling this area, sometimes the large prostate over 100 cc extends so 
much anteriorly that the biopsy needle hits the pubis as it is advanced through the 
biopsy template brachytherapy grid and through the perineum. The surgeon can 
perform certain maneuvers to help overcome this difficulty, such as flexing the hips 
by pushing the stirrups cranially, which helps raise the pubis giving more access for 
the biopsy needle to enter. In addition, the biopsy needle can be inserted freehand at 
an angle into the perineum by removing the brachytherapy grid, facilitating access 
to the anterior prostate.
Another way of balancing out adequate diagnosis and adverse events in larger 
prostates would be to use mpMRI-targeted biopsies. In these biopsies, the informa-
tion obtained using mpMRI is used to influence conduct and placement of the nee-
dles. Recent evidence supports the use of mpMRI prior to biopsy [68] and this is 
becoming increasingly common practice as a means to identify suspicious areas that 
J.B. Neves et al.

47
can then be biopsied. In the very large prostate a strategy of sampling only suspi-
cious areas could be particularly advantageous. Even when using the trans-rectal 
route, pre-biopsy knowledge of the existence of a possible anterior tumour can aid 
in the sampling of the anterior prostate [69].
Overall, mpMRI-targeted biopsies appear to have better detection rates of 
clinically significant cancer than 12 core TRUS biopsy, with reduced diagnosis 
of clinically insignificant cancer [70]. Similarly, a prospective study in men who 
had targeted biopsy cores in addition to 12 core TRUS biopsies indicated that 
prostate cancer may be more likely to be diagnosed using targeted cores than 
systematic 12 core sampling in prostates with a volume from 40 up to 160 cc 
[71]. Compared to TTPB, mpMRI-targeted biopsies may have similar clinically 
significant cancer detection rates and lower clinically insignificant cancer detec-
tion rates [66]. They are also associated with fewer side effects [65].
Whilst early results would support the value of mpMRI-targeted biopsies over 
systematic biopsies in large prostates greater than 100  cc, further research is 
needed to elucidate its exact role. Variations in targeted biopsy practice exist, for 
example the method of registration used to carry out the biopsies can vary. A clear 
difference in detection rates between cognitive and software fusion targeted biop-
sies hasn’t been found [72]. In experienced hands, cognitive targeted biopsy has 
shown good detection rates of cancer [66] whilst saving the expense of a software 
fusion system. However, the big prostate can be particularly challenging to per-
form targeted biopsy in and it is not known whether software assisted fusion may 
offer particular advantages over cognitive targeted biopsy in this group of men.
4.3  Conclusions
Currently, the prostate cancer diagnostic pathway still puts more value on total PSA 
than on multifactorial individual risk stratification. Research on PSA derived mark-
ers and risk stratification tools has failed to translate into clinical practice. As a 
result, many men with large prostates and elevated serum PSA but without prostate 
cancer are still being offered first and repeat prostate biopsies. This is a particular 
problem in men with very large prostates (greater than 100 cc), who are likely to 
have higher PSA levels independent of whether or not they harbor clinically signifi-
cant prostate cancer.
A more conservative approach that is sensitive enough not to miss clinically 
significant cancer is needed. The use of mpMRI alone or in combination with 
previously studied markers may impart that change and serve as a useful tool in 
the assessment of the very large prostate. mpMRI has the potential to screen out 
men, leading to fewer prostate biopsies, and to guide a more accurate and less 
intense sampling by means of targeted biopsies. This may decrease the healthcare 
burden of suspected prostate cancer diagnostic pathways not only in terms of 
direct biopsy costs but also in terms of indirect costs that result from reducing 
both biopsy complications and intensive surveillance regimes due to fear of 
misdiagnosis.

Medical Treatment of the Large Prostate

5.1  Introduction
Men with large prostates are at increased risk of developing both voiding and 
­storage lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) as well as acute and chronic urinary 
retention [1]. The precise risk of men with prostates over 100 mL in volume devel-
oping these conditions are not known but the Veterans Affairs (VA) cohort showed 
men with prostates over 30 mL in volume were three times more likely to develop 
acute urinary retention (AUR) [2], inferring that much larger glands are likely to be 
at a even greater risk. The Olmsted county study showed that men with prostates 
over 50 mL in volume were 3.5 times more likely to report moderate to severe 
LUTS than men with smaller prostates [3]. The probability of experiencing moder-
ate to severe LUTS was also shown to be strongly correlated with age and a maxi-
mum urinary flow rate (Qmax) of less than 10 mL/s. The existing prospective studies 
including the VA cohort and Olmsted county included men with mean prostate vol-
umes ranging from 36 to 55 mL [1–6]. Some of the studies also excluded men with 
PSA > 10 ng/mL which will have inevitably excluded many men with very large 
prostates. However, the PLESS study did look at a sub-group of men with mean 
prostate volumes of 82 mL [5].
Medical treatment for men with very large prostates aims to improve lower uri-
nary tract symptoms (LUTS), and to prevent clinical progression, either in the form 
of deterioration of LUTS, the development of AUR or the need for surgery. 
Medications used in pursuit of this goal include 5α-reductase inhibitors, 
α-blockers, anti-muscarinics, β3-agonists, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors.

5.2  5α-Reductase Inhibitors (Table 5.1)
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is likely to arise via a complex interaction 
between hormonal activation, growth factors and ageing [7]. Dihydrotestosterone is 
the hormone responsible for virilisation of the structures of the urogenital sinus. It 
has greater affinity for the androgen receptor than testosterone and is about twice as 
potent as testosterone. It is produced via reduction of testosterone by the lipophilic 
enzyme, 5α-reductase, which has two isoenzymes [8]: Type one is the dominant 
isoenzyme within sebaceous glands and found in the liver and skin as well as within 
the prostate where it is less abundant. Type two is the dominant isoenzyme within 
the prostate. The prostates of men with 5α-reductase deficiency are small and com-
posed purely of stromal tissue unlike in unaffected males where there is also abun-
dant epithelial tissue even though there is a greater proportion of stromal tissue 
compared to glandular tissue in men with BPH. It would appear that dihydrotestos-
terone has its principle effects in the stromal tissue and that glandular or epithelial 
hyperplasia occurs via paracrine rather than autocrine activation.
Dutasteride and Finasteride are both 4-aza steroid competitive inhibitors of 
5α-reductase. Dutasteride inhibits both type one and type two 5α-reductase isoen-
zymes whereas Finasteride only inhibits the type two isoenzyme [9]. Nevertheless, 
Finasteride manages to reduce serum dihydrotestosterone by 70% and prostate 
dihydrotestosterone levels by up to 90% [8].
Finasteride was the first hormonal agent for treatment of BPH to be used in a 
placebo controlled randomised trial [10]. The results published in the New England 
Journal of Medicine in 1992 showed Finasteride was effective at reducing prostate 
volume, as well as improving LUTS and maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) when 
compared to placebo. The VA cohort later demonstrated that Finasteride reduced 
prostate volume measured on trans-rectal ultrasound by 17% at 6 months which was 
maintained thereafter [11]. The subsequent MTOPS trial showed that Finasteride 
reduced the volume of prostates over 40 mL in volume by 19% compared to those 
in the Doxazosin and placebo arms, where the prostate volume increased by 24% 
over the same time period [1]. A later subset analysis of men with prostate volumes 
over 50 mL within the VA cohort showed that Finasteride decreased AUA symptom 
score by 3.6 points (1.1 more points than placebo) after 12 months of treatment. The 
PLESS study, an RCT of Finasteride versus placebo, was the first to follow men up 
for more than 1 year and lasted 4 years [4]. Patients had a mean prostate volume of 
55 mL. The AUA (now IPSS) symptom scores were assessed every 4 months up to 
4 years. The symptom scores of both the placebo and the Finasteride group decreased 
in a similar ­fashion over the first eight months. However, after 8 months, the symp-
tom scores of the Finasteride group continued to decrease right up to the end of the 
study but the scores of the placebo group gradually increased from 8 months. Hence 
it would appear that Finasteride is marginally effective at improving LUTS in men 
with prostates over 50  mL in volume but the benefit is probably only evident 
after 8 months of treatment when compared to placebo. Whether there is an 
additional advantage in men with even larger prostates is not known.

5  Medical Treatment of the Large Prostate

58
The main role of a 5α-reductase inhibitors in men with large prostates is prevent-
ing AUR and the need for BPH surgery. The PLESS was the first study to assess 
AUR and BPH surgery as study endpoints [4, 5]. The patients in the PLESS study 
had large prostates with a mean volume of 55 mL. A later sub-set analysis by pros-
tate size showed that 22% of men within the highest tertile, with a mean volume of 
82 mL and a range between 58 and 150 mL, developed AUR or required BPH sur-
gery compared to 8.9% in the lowest prostate volume tertile. Overall, 7% of men on 
placebo developed AUR compared to 4% of those on Finasteride; 10% of those on 
placebo required surgery compared to 5% of those on Finasteride. The greatest risk 
reduction in BPH surgery or AUR was seen in the highest prostate volume group. It 
therefore seems that men with the largest prostates have the most to benefit by early 
commencement of medical treatment with a 5AR.
The MTOPS study randomly assigned men with lower urinary tract symptoms to 
placebo, Doxazosin, Finasteride or combination therapy. Their primary endpoint 
was overall ‘clinical progression’ defined as an increase in four our more AUA 
symptom score points, acute urinary retention, urinary incontinence, renal insuffi-
ciency or recurrent urinary tract infection [1]. This was assessed at the time it was 
first observed within the 4.5 year follow up. Their secondary endpoints included 
invasive therapy for BPH. Finasteride was less effective than Doxazosin at reducing 
symptoms but more effective than placebo. Combination therapy was the most 
effective at reducing symptoms, preventing urinary retention and preventing sur-
gery. Finasteride reduced the cumulative rate of urinary retention by 68% compared 
to placebo. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one BPH surgery was 29 
for Finasteride and 26 for combination therapy. However, the NNT was reduced to 
23.1 and 15.9 by combination therapy for the subsets of men with PSA > 4.0 ng/mL 
and prostate volumes over 40 mL respectively. A post hoc analysis later showed that 
men with prostate volumes over 25  mL benefitted from Finasteride in terms of 
reducing clinical progression, urinary retention and the need for surgery [12].
The Combination of Avodart and Tamsulosin (CombAT) trial was the first to use 
Dutasteride (Avodart) rather than Finasteride. They excluded men with prostates 
less than 30 mL in volume hence their mean prostate volume of 55.0 mL was larger 
than most of the other studies except PLESS. There was no placebo arm. The inci-
dence of AUR and BPH surgery was lower for all men treated with Dutasteride or 
combination compared to Tamsulosin independent of prostate volume, PSA, age, 
IPSS, Qmax, body mass index (BMI) and race. When the men were divided into 
tertiles, combination therapy was better than Tamsulosin monotherapy for reducing 
AUR and the need for BPH surgery in those with prostates between 42.0 and 
57.8 mL and those with prostates over 57.8 mL. Although numerically superior, 
combined therapy was not statistically superior to Dutasteride monotherapy.
Men started on Finasteride and Dutasteride may be warned about erectile dys-
function, decreased libido and gynaecomastia. During the PREDICT trial, 5.8% of 
men on Finasteride and 3.3% of men on placebo reported erectile dysfunction. A 
large cohort with nested case control study in 2016 did not show significant erectile 
dysfunction attributable to 5α-reductase inhibitors [13]. Gynaecomastastia would 
appear to have an annual incidence of 0.1–0.5% [4, 14].
N.F. Walker and J. Rees

59
Overall it is clear from these studies that both Finasteride and Dutasteride can 
prevent AUR and BPH surgery in prostates over 25–40 mL. It is not clear whether 
there are additional advantages to men with prostates over this size but it seems 
likely from some of the sub-analyses of these larger prostate cohorts. However, 
men with larger prostates are at significantly higher risk of developing AUR and 
requiring surgery and so a 5α-reductase inhibitor would be an important first 
line treatment. There is no prospective evidence to show that there is any superi-
ority of Finasteride over Dutasteride and retrospective studies do not warrant rec-
ommendation for one of these 5α-reductase inhibitors over the other [15].
5α-Reductase inhibitors are also used as treatment for haematuria arising from 
the prostate and to reduce bleeding during subsequent prostate surgery [16, 17]. In 
BPH, the microvascular density has been shown to be increased which may be the 
reason why BPH puts a patient at risk of prostatic bleeding [18]. Finasteride and 
Dutasteride reduce the microvascular density with the prostate [17]. A prospective 
study showed that recurrence of haematuria in men treated with Finasteride was 
reduced by 49% and none of the 17 men treated with Finasteride required surgery 
for haematuria compared to 7 (26%) of controls [16]. A randomised trial of a four 
weeks of Dutasteride, Finasteride or placebo before TURP showed that both 
5α-reductase inhibitors reduced blood loss and the need for blood transfusions com-
pared to placebo but there was no significant differences between Finasteride and 
Dutasteride [17]. Although 5α-reductase inhibitors have been shown to be beneficial 
in preventing bleeding during TURP, they have anecdotally been reported as making 
the prostate firmer and more difficult to morcellate during during holmium laser 
enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP).
Men with very large prostates often have raised PSA and hence may be under 
PSA surveillance owing to concerns over prostate cancer. As 5α-reductase inhibi-
tors reduce prostate size, they also reduce PSA levels. A rise in PSA for a man on 
a 5α-reductase inhibitor can hence be more clinically concerning than in a man not 
on a 5α-reductase inhibitor. The degree of PSA rise has been shown to be linked 
to the likelihood of developing higher grade prostate cancer [19]. For the sake of 
monitoring, it is recommended that a man on a 5α-reductase inhibitor should have 
his PSA value doubled for comparison although any rise should trigger some 
concerns [20].
5.3  α-Blockers (Table 5.2)
Smooth muscle fibres make up approximately half the stroma of the prostate gland 
including the capsule. In BPH, the stromal and glandular tissue make up approxi-
mately 80 and 20% of the hyperplastic gland [7]. Unlike in female bladders, male 
bladder fibres become circular in orientation towards the bladder neck. This ring of 
muscle (the pre-prostatic sphincter) prevents retrograde ejaculation, by alpha-
adrenergic modulated increased tone during erection and ejaculation. Despite its 
location, it does not appear to have any role in continence but BPH can lead to

bladder outflow obstruction and LUTS [22]. Approximately 90% of the smooth 
muscle receptors are the α-1 subtype which mediate the contraction of smooth mus-
cle within the prostate [23].
Phenoxybenzamine was the first α-blocker to be shown to improve LUTS in an 
RCT in 1978 though the only outcome measured used were day time and night time 
frequency and Qmax, which all improved. Phenoxybenzamine is a non-­selective 
α-blocker and significant adverse effects including fatigue, dizziness, nasal conges-
tion, hypotension and ejaculatory problems were reported in this trial.
The first selective α-1 blocker to be subjected to a randomised, placebo con-
trolled trial was Terazosin (two, five or 10 mg) published by Lepor and colleagues 
in 1992 [24]. The mean prostate volume was 36.9 mL but outcomes of subsets of 
men with larger prostates were not assessed. The greatest benefit was seen in 
the 10 mg group with a 22.4% reduction in symptom score and a 24.4% increase 
in Qmax. The VA cohort study was the first to compare an α-blocker (Terazosin 
10 mg) with a 5α-reductase inhibitor (Finasteride) and combination [2]. Terazosin 
was more effective at reducing symptoms scores and improving Qmax than 
Finasteride monotherapy, which was no more effective than placebo. The improve-
ment in Qmax peaked at four weeks after starting Terazosin and the benefits were 
independent of prostate volume.
The PrEDiCT trial showed that Doxazosin (another α-1 blocker) was more effec-
tive than placebo and Finasteride at improving LUTS and that combination therapy 
was no more effective than Doxazosin monotherapy [25]. No patients on combina-
tion therapy developed AUR or required TURP compared to 7 in the placebo group, 
5 in the Finasteride group and 1 in the Doxazosin group at 1 year. In the MTOPS 
trial, fewer patients on Doxazosin required BPH surgery or developed AUR at the 
end of the first year, but by 4.5 years follow up, Doxazosin was not found to prevent 
AUR or BPH surgery when compared to placebo [1].
Tamsulosin was the first sub-selective α-1a blocker to be trialled [26]. Although 
more selective for α-1a than α-1b, it had similar selectivity for α-1a and α-1d recep-
tors [26]. A randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial of Tamsulosin at 400 and 
800 μg showed that the 400 μg dose was effective at improving symptom scores and 
Qmax [27]. The onset of symptomatic improvement compared to placebo was 
observed after one week and improvement in Qmax was observed after the very first 
dose. The highest discontinuation rate was in the 800 μg arm (13%). The most com-
monly reported adverse events were rhinitis (12% vs. 6% on placebo) and abnormal 
ejaculation (6% on 400 μg, 18% on 800 μg and 0% for placebo). Although all 
patients showed a small drop in blood pressure, only 1% showed clinically signifi-
cant orthostatic hypotension. The equivalent rates for postural hypotension for 
Doxazosin in other studies would appear to be between 4.0 and 5.8% [1, 25].
Tamsulosin 400 μg once daily was the first α-blocker that was effective at improv-
ing LUTS that did not require titration, which may partly explain its popularity [26]. 
A double blinded randomised study in 16–36  year old healthy volunteers given 
Alfuzosin, the latest α-1 blocker to enter the market, Tamsulosin 800 μg once daily 
or placebo showed Tamsulosin was associated with a 2.4 mL reduction in ejaculate 
5  Medical Treatment of the Large Prostate

volume compared to Alfuzosin and placebo [28]. The study reported that 35.4% of 
those of Tamsulosin who completed the study suffered from anejaculation rather than 
retrograde ejaculation. There was no significant difference in post ejaculation urinary 
sperm concentration between the groups suggesting the reduction in ejaculate did not 
arise from retrograde ejaculation. It was suggested that Tamsulosin impairs ejacula-
tion as, unlike other α-blockers, it also inhibits 5HT1A and D3 receptors and can cross 
the blood-brain barrier and inhibit the central control of ejaculation. A randomised, 
placebo controlled trial of 15 and 10  mg doses of Alfuzosin showed Alfuzosin 
improved IPSS scores and Qmax without compromising blood pressure or ejacula-
tory function [29]. There does not appear to be an advantage of a 15 mg dose and so 
like Tamsulosin 400 μg once daily, titration is not required. There is no evidence 
specifically looking at the effectiveness of α-blockers in prostates of over 100 mL in 
volume. However, it would appear α-blockers are effective at improving Qmax from 
the very first dose, with maximum effect at 4 weeks. They also improve LUTS after 
a week of therapy with maximum effect at approximately four weeks for all prostate 
sizes. Alfuzosin 10 mg once daily avoids the need for dose titration like Tamsulosin 
400 μg, but does not adversely affect ejaculation as frequently as Tamsulosin.
Men with large median lobes which indent the bladder are less likely to benefit 
from an alpha blocker [30, 31]. Protrusion of the prostate into the bladder is more 
common in men with larger prostates and the ‘ball-valve’ effect that results may be 
part of the reason for a lack of response to medical therapy [31]. Hence, a flexible 
cystoscopy is useful in patients who fail to respond to medical therapy as they may 
require BPH surgery.
There is some debate as to when to cease α-blockers for symptom control when 
they are used in combination with 5α-reductase inhibitors. The SMART-1 trial 
showed that most men’s symptoms do not deteriorate if the α-blocker is stopped at 
6 months of combination therapy [32]. A minority of patients in this study with 
severe symptoms (IPSS > 20), may have benefitted from longer term therapy. A 
sensible approach would be to follow up a patient after α-blocker withdrawal and 
simply re-start if the patient becomes symptomatic.
Although α-blockers may only defer a first episode of AUR rather than prevent 
it, they can increase the likelihood of spontaneous voiding following catheterization 
for AUR [33]. Following AUR, men given Alfuzosin for three days were 14% more 
likely to pass their trial without catheter compared to those on placebo. After 3 
months of therapy, they were 8% less likely to require surgery. While the prevention 
of surgery in this short-term study is only minimal, an α-blocker is clearly a useful 
adjunct in helping a man become catheter free after developing AUR. It may also be 
prudent to give those men with larger prostates who are undergoing any form of 
surgery requiring catheterisation, a period of peri-­operative alpha blockers to pre-
vent the risk of retention.

5.4  Anti-muscarinics
LUTS in men may arise from bladder pathology as well as BPH [34]. The EPIC 
study showed that men and women suffered equally from overactive bladder (OAB) 
symptoms and the overall prevalence in the over 18’s was 11.8% and the prevalence 
increased significantly with age in men [35]. Men with LUTS often find the storage 
symptoms such as frequency and urgency more bothersome than the voiding LUTS 
such as hesitancy and poor flow. The OAB symptoms can arise from the reduction 
in functional capacity from chronic urinary retention as a result of bladder outflow 
obstruction (BOO). However, the likelihood of men developing non-neurogenic 
detrusor overactivity on urodynamic studies also correlates well with age and degree 
of BOO [36]. The reason for this relationship is likely multi-factorial but it would 
appear that BOO leads to an increase in detrusor wall thickness with associated 
hypertrophy of neurons and changes in the bladder’s electrophysiology [36].
The human bladder is innervated via parasympathetic fibres from the S2–4 nerve 
roots, which use acetylcholine for neurotransmission. Anti-muscarinic competitive 
acetylcholine antagonist medications are currently first line medical treatment for 
OAB symptoms (urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency 
and nocturia) [37]. They aim to inhibit involuntary detrusor contractions during the 
bladder’s storage phase that are believed to be at least partly responsible for these 
unpleasant symptoms. There is also evidence from animal studies that anti-musca-
rinic mediations may have some of their effects via reducing activity in unmyelin-
ated c and Aδ fibres [38]. The key concern in using anti-muscarinics in men with 
very large prostates is that inhibition of detrusor contraction during voiding could 
lead to acute urinary retention or an increase in post void residual volumes, with 
worsening symptoms or even renal failure in the most extreme cases. Retrospective 
analyses have suggested there is an eight fold increased risk of AUR in the first 
4 weeks of anti-muscarininic therapy with a two fold risk thereafter [39]. However, 
in a randomised, placebo controlled trial of Tamsulosin, Tolterodine or combination 
in men over 40 with BPH and OAB, the post void volume increased from a mean 
baseline of 53 by 5.3 mL for Tolterodine, 6.42 mL for combination and decreased by 
3.6 mL for placebo after 12 weeks [40]. The differences were not statistically signifi-
cant. AUR was reported in 0.4% of men on combination, 0.5% on Tolterodine and 
0% for those on Tamsulosin monotherapy or placebo. This was a relatively short-
term study and men with post void residual volumes of over 200 mL were excluded.
Anti-muscarinics should be used to help men with storage LUTS and BPH 
should certainly not automatically preclude men from their use. However, there is 
not enough reliable prospective, long-term data in men with very large prostates to 
conclude they will not contribute to poor emptying or even AUR. It is probably safe 
to use anti-muscarinics in this group of patients but a follow up post void volume at 
5  Medical Treatment of the Large Prostate

66
12 weeks would be prudent until better evidence becomes available. Vesomni is a 
single daily tablet which contains combined Tamsulosin 400 μg and Solifenacin 
6 mg. It can be a very useful medication for men with BOO and OAB symptoms.
5.5  β3-Agonists (Table 5.3)
Activation of the β3-adrenoreceptor via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate path-
way by the neurotransmitter, noradrenaline, leads to dose dependent relaxation of 
the bladder during the storage phase in animal studies [41, 42]. In rodent models, 
activation of the β3 adrenoreceptor increases the period between voids and bladder 
compliance and does not compromise voiding function. The effects of β3 agonists 
may also result from inhibition of the pressure sensitive Aδ fibres and release of 
nitric oxide within the bladder epithelium leading to detrusor relaxation [43, 44]. 
Mirabegron was the first of these drugs to come to market and is helpful for patients 
who cannot tolerate the significant side effect profile of anti-muscarinics, such as 
dry mouth or who have conditions such as closed angle glaucoma, a history of 
recurrent falls or memory impairment which preclude anti-muscarinic therapy. 
Although their desired action is in the storage phase, it is conceivable that a β3 ago-
nist could cause AUR or worsen voiding symptoms in men with very large pros-
tates. The initial proof of concept study, the BLOSSOM trial, demonstrated that 
Mirabegron reduced urinary frequency, incontinence episodes, nocturia and 
improved quality of life outcome measures [45]. Improvements in symptoms were 
evident after 2 weeks and there was no significant change in post void volumes at 
the end of the 12 week study. The 38 men who were randomised were unlikely to be 
representative of men with very large prostates as men with clinically significant 
bladder outflow obstruction and post void volumes over 200 mL were excluded. 
Pooled data from the subsequent SCORPIO, ARIES and CAPRICORN trials with 
similar patient demographics showed that urinary retention occurred in no patients 
on Mirabegron 25 mg and 100 mg, 0.1% of patients on Mirabegron 50 mg com-
pared to 0.4% on placebo and 0.6% on Tolterodine [46]. The PVR of all groups was 
non-significantly less at the end of the 12 week study than at baseline aside from 
Tolterodine where the mean PVR increased by 0.1 mL. The Symphony trial demon-
strated Mirabegron’s improvement of mean voided volume, frequency and urgency 
when used in combination with Solifenacin compared to Mirabegron monotherapy 
[47]. After 12 weeks, Mirabegron increased the mean PVR by 0.2 mL when used as 
monotherapy and by 10.7 mL when used in combination. There was concern that a 
β-agonist mediation could cause a tachycardia but the mean heart rate increased by 
1.0 beats per minute after 12 weeks.
β3 Agonists may be useful in conjunction with or as a substitute for anticholiner-
gics. They do not appear to significantly impede voiding but it is not clear if this is 
the case for men with high post void residuals. Until more reliable data is available 
for men with bladder outflow obstruction and β3 agonists, a review of a patient at 
risk of developing retention with a follow up PVR measurement at 12 weeks would 
appear prudent.

5.6  Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors
Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5-I) are best known in urology for treating 
erectile dysfunction by increasing blood flow into the corpora cavernosa. 
Following neural stimulation, nitric oxide (NO) activates guanylate cyclase which 
converts GTP into cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) which in turn activates 
cGMP dependent kinase phosphorylating several proteins leading to trabecular and 
arterial smooth muscle relaxation [48]. This leads to arterial dilatation, venous con-
striction and improved turgidity of erections.
PDE5 is found in the arterial smooth muscle of the lungs and PDE5-I were first 
brought to market for treatment of hypertension and angina and are now used as 
treatment for pulmonary hypertension [49]. PDE5-I have been shown in several tri-
als to improve LUTS (both storage and voiding) and to marginally improve Qmax. 
The aetiology of its beneficial effects on LUTS are complex and likely multi-facto-
rial [50] but thought to be related to increased pelvic blood flow. Relaxation of the 
PDE5-dependent smooth muscle found within the bladder neck, detrusor muscle, 
prostate and urethra may be responsible for the improved voiding and storage symp-
toms reported in several trials [51, 52]. There is also abundant PDE5 within the 
inferior vesicular artery and its branches to the prostate and urethra [50]. It is pos-
sible that PDE5-I improve blood flow to these organs. LUTS have been linked to the 
metabolic syndrome and hypertension resulting in poor oxygenation of these organs 
leading to fibrosis, contractile changes and increases in urethral resistance. However, 
it would seem unlikely that all the improvements in LUTS are from counteraction 
of these chronic processes as the improvements in LUTS with PDE5-I are observed 
within one week [52]. Moreover it is likely that PDE5-I have an effect on the affer-
ent pathways as well [50]. In rat models, cGMP and PDE5-I led to an increase in the 
intervals between bladder contractions and an increase in the micturition pressure 
threshold suggesting inhibition of the afferent pathways [53].
Only one RCT has compared a PDE5-I (Tadalafil 5  mg) with an α-blocker 
(Tamsulosin 400μg) and placebo [52]. This showed improvements for both 
Tamsulosin and Tadalafil compared to placebo in Qmax and voiding symptoms. 
There was numerical improvement in storage symptoms at 12 weeks (p = 0.055). 
There was no statistically significant difference between Tamsulosin and Tadalafil 
for these outcomes. The PVR for patients on placebo, Tadalafil and Tamsulosin fell 
by 1.2, 4.6 and 10.2 mL at the end of the study. These changes were not statistically 
significant but it is unlikely they would lead to acute or chronic urinary retention.
PDE5-I are now recommended and licensed for the treatment of male LUTS 
though there is no longer term data to confirm their safety or their ability to ­prevent 
progression [54]. Tadalafil 5 mg appears an effective treatment for male LUTS and 
would be particularly appropriate for men who also suffer from erectile dysfunc-
tion. There is a strong correlation between the severity of LUTS and erectile dys-
function in the ageing male and so men with very large prostates may well be 
seeking concomitant treatment for LUTS and ED [55]. Hopefully, future studies 
will compare its effectiveness and safety by means of a RCT against placebo, 
α-blockers, 5α-reductase inhibitors alone and in combination.

5.7  Indications for Surgery
When LUTS are still bothersome despite medical therapy and there are signs of 
bladder outflow obstruction, patients should be offered surgery depending on their 
co-morbidities. Similarly, patients who have had an episode of urinary retention and 
have not managed to void without a catheter should also be offered surgery. Particular 
attention should be given to those with significant median lobes and prostatic inden-
tation of the bladder, as they are unlikely to respond to α-blockers and surgery would 
offer a better chance of symptomatic improvement and it is not known how effective 
5α-reductase inhibitors are for this subset of patients [30].
Men may prefer a definitive surgical procedure rather than up to three daily med-
ications to treat their symptoms or their concern that they may develop 
AUR. Depending on the likely length of medical treatment, surgical intervention 
may also offer long term cost savings.
Strong indications for BPH surgery rather than medical therapy in large prostates 
include chronic urinary retention with renal insufficiency (high pressure chronic 
urinary retention), the presence of bladder stones, recurrent acute urinary retention 
with evidence of bladder outflow obstruction and haematuria arising from the pros-
tate refractory to 5α reductase inhibitor therapy [54]. Ultimately, medical therapies 
have an important role in the initial management of men with LUTS and a very 
enlarged prostate but this group of men will often require bladder outflow surgery if 
they progress.
5.8  Conclusion
Men with very large prostates are at a high risk of experiencing severe storage and void-
ing LUTS, developing acute and chronic urinary retention and requiring surgery. 
Symptoms are likely to be helped quickly by α-blockers such as Alfuzosin and 
Tamsulosin unless there is significant indentation of the bladder by a very large prostate. 
These α-blockers are probably as effective as a daily PDE5-I which would also help 
treat concomitant ED. 5α-reductase inhibitors will help improve symptoms after several 
months of treatment but their main role is to prevent acute urinary retention and the 
requirement for surgery which is particularly relevant to men with very large prostates.

6.1  Rationale of PAE for BPH
The main goal when treating patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is to 
relieve lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to bladder outlet obstruction 
(BOO). LUTS are believed to be due to two main components: (1) Static due to 
urethral obstruction by an enlarged prostate (thus, many clinicians prefer to use the 
terms BPO—benign prostatic obstruction or BPE—benign prostatic enlargement) 
and (2) Dynamic due to increased prostatic smooth muscle tone. It is important, 
however, to note that LUTS are multifactorial, and may be due to non-prostatic 
diseases as bladder dysfunction, urethral strictures or cardiac disease. Thus, it is 
essential to rule out non-prostatic causes of LUTS, that even though less frequent, 
may mimic BPH-related LUTS.
Prostate artery embolization (PAE) leads to prostate tissue necrosis and intends 
to target the two components of BPH-related LUTS: (1) static—through the destruc-
tion of peri-urethral prostate tissue relieving the urethral obstruction with an overall 
reduction in prostate size; (2) dynamic—through the destruction of α1-adrenergic 
receptors in the prostatic stroma leading to decreased prostatic smooth muscle tone. 
Also, the PAE-induced local ischemia may lead to an immediate activation of nitric 
oxide (NO) synthase and subsequent overproduction of NO in the prostate, thus 
lowering smooth muscle tone and BOO-related LUTS [1].

The prostate tissue is also responsible for the conversion of testosterone into 
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and transportation of DHT into the gland. DHT is the 
chief hormone leading to prostate growth with age. Thus, with prostate tissue 
destruction the ability to convert testosterone into DHT becomes compromised 
leading to slower prostate tissue growth with time. Both components are 
believed to relieve BOO and related LUTS (Fig. 6.1).
The static component of LUTS has traditionally been treated with 5α-reductase 
inhibitors and/or surgery to reduce prostate volume, prostate-induced urethral 
obstruction and BOO-related LUTS.  Six months after starting treatment with 
5α-reductase inhibitors there is a mean prostate volume reduction of 20–30% 
with a mean prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) reduction of 40–50% [2]. These 
­figures are similar to those obtained 6 months after PAE, reinforcing the potential 
role of PAE as an effective tool to block the functional androgen-signalling axis 
[1]. The dynamic component of BPH-related LUTS has traditionally been treated 
with α-blockers that improve LUTS 30–40% with an increase in peak urinary flow 
rate (Qmax) of 15–30% [2]. More recently, the dynamic component of BPH-­
related LUTS has also been treated with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors 
(PDE5-Is) that lead to lower smooth muscle tone inside the prostate through the 
activation of the NO-pathway. Treatment with PDE5-Is has shown to lead to LUTS 
relief of six points, with no significant effect on Qmax [2]. These figures are some-
what inferior to PAE, probably because PAE leads to LUTS-BOO relief through 
both static and dynamic components involving all these potential pathways.

6.2  Technical Steps
PAE planning starts with adequate patient selection through strict inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. Patients over 40 years with prostate volume above 30 cm3, with 
LUTS refractory to medical therapy for at least 6 months are selected for PAE, as 
are those patients who do not want to undergo medical or other more invasive surgi-
cal prostate therapies [3]. Patients under acute urinary retention due to BPO refrac-
tory to conservative management are also candidates for PAE.  Patients without 
significant LUTS, with prostate cancer, with large (>5 cm) bladder diverticula or 
stone, bladder dysfunction, urinary tract infection or chronic renal failure are 
excluded. Patients should have evidence of BOO through, at least, non-invasive uro-
flowmetry to measure Qmax and post-void residual urine volume (PVR). In doubt-
ful cases or for research purposes, invasive urodynamic studies should be performed 
before and after PAE, bearing in mind that these are examinations that induce sig-
nificant patient discomfort. They can induce urinary tract infections or acute urinary 
retention in severely symptomatic patients.
PAE technique starts with pre-procedural planning [4]. We have performed 1150 
PAE procedures from 2009–2016 and believe that pre-procedural CT angiography 
(CTA) of the pelvis is very important to define the arterial anatomy of pelvic and 
prostatic arteries (PAs) [5, 6]. Many centres are nowadays also performing PAE and 
prefer the use of intra-procedural cone-beam CT [7]. The use or not of pre-proce-
dural CTA largely depends on physician/institutional preference. The use of pre-
procedural MRI can also be of added value to exclude significant cancer and define 
prostate zonal anatomy. Either with pre-procedural CTA or intra-­procedural cone-
beam CT it is essential to define the PA anatomy relevant for embolization. In our 
experience, pre-procedural CTA helps to decide which femoral artery or if both 
should be punctured, saving a lot of time during PAE in search of the 1–2 mm in size 
PAs amongst all internal iliac branches. We also exclude up to 2% of patients 
because PAE would be very difficult based on pre-­procedural CTA. PAs can arise 
from aberrant obturator arteries outside the pelvis in up to 2% of patients [8], which 
is a variant that can lead to a huge amount of time and radiation wasted in search of 
PAs amongst the internal iliac branches if CTA is not performed before 
embolization.
PAE is performed on an outpatient basis, usually with a single femoral artery 
puncture under local anaesthesia [4]. We use a 5F Roberts uterine catheter (RUC, 
Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) or a 5F Berenstein catheter to navigate both 
internal iliac arteries through a single femoral approach. The RUC catheter is a 
reversed catheter with a preformed Waltman loop. With the Berenstein catheter 
we use steam to bend the catheter 15–20 cm proximal to the tip to help reform 
the Waltman loop over the aortic bifurcation. When inside the internal iliac arter-
ies, the steep ipsilateral anterior oblique projection (35–35°) with little caudal-­
cranial tilt (−10°) helps to separate and identify all the major branches, including 
the PAs. A standard digital subtraction angiography (DSA) or cone beam CT 
should be performed with the catheter tip in the proximal part of the anterior

division of the internal iliac artery with the oblique projection. For DSA we use 
6 mL at 3 mL/s, for cone beam-CT we use 10 mL at 1 mL/s with 1.5 s of delay. After 
this acquisition, the PAs are identified and selectively catheterized with 2.0–2.4F 
coaxial microcatheters. Our preferred microcatheter in recent times has been the 
Maestro (Merit Medical Systems Inc., South Jordan, UT, USA) that can be pre-­
shaped. We have used the Swan-neck shaped 2.4F Maestro even without a guide-
wire (just the support from the 5F catheter) or with an 0.016″ guidewire for 
difficult catheterizations (GT, Terumo Interventional Systems, Tokyo, Japan or 
Tenor, Merit Medical Systems, Inc.).
The prostate has a dual arterial supply: feeding arteries for the central/cranial 
gland and for the peripheral/caudal gland. These two PAs may arise from a com-
mon trunk (one PA per pelvic side—60%) or have independent origins (two PAs 
per pelvic side—40%). In our experience most frequent PA origins are: (1) inter-
nal pudendal artery (35%); (2) superior vesical artery (20%); (3) directly from the 
anterior division of the internal iliac artery (15%); (4) obturator artery (10%) [5]. 
The remainder 20% are rare origins: prostato-rectal trunk, inferior or superior glu-
teal arteries and accessory pudendal arteries.
After identification and selective catheterization of the PAs cone-beam CT can 
be used to reassure correct target-embolization and identify possible anastomo-
ses that may lead to non-target embolization of the bladder, rectum or penis 
(Fig. 6.2). Embolization of the PAs has been reported with the use of 50–350 μm 
PVA particles (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA; Boston Scientific Corp, 
Marlborough, Mass, USA), 300–500 μm spherical PVA (Beadblock, Biocompatibles 
International plc, Farnham, UK) and 100–300 and 300–500 μm tris-acryl gelatin 
microspheres (Embospheres, Merit Medical Systems, Inc.) to complete stasis, 
occlusion of all prostate branches and reflux to the main PA trunk.
6.3  Tips and Tricks
Starting with the access route, CTA can help to choose the best side to puncture the 
femoral artery and to decide between a short or long (more supportive) sheath in 
order to avoid tortuosity of iliac arteries and to ease the navigation of the equipment 
especially along the stiff and noncompliant ageing vessels. PAE has been reported 
to be successful from a transradial approach [9] and we have performed approxi-
mately 20 PAE procedures through a radial access. Even though being feasible, PAE 
can be even more challenging if adopting a radial access because of tortuosity of the 
aortic arch, common in patients older than 70 years, and lower support from the 5F 
catheter inside the pelvis. Existing catheters for radial access are 125  cm long, 
which allow reaching the internal iliac artery, but frequently fail to reach the PA 
ostium. The steep oblique projections used for PAE are also cumbersome for the 
operator when going through radial access as the X-ray C-arm can come very close 
to the operator. It is often useful to have the 5F catheter near the PA origin in order 
T. Bilhim et al.

79
to help guide the microcatheter into the PA. From our experience, when using radial 
access, we always use 0.016″ guidewires to help guide the microcatheter into the 
PAs, while with the femoral approach we only need 0.016″ guidewires in approxi-
mately a third of procedures. However, in our experience, patient satisfaction is 
quite higher with radial access when compared to femoral, especially in those 
patients who frequently have to get out of bed to urinate after PAE.
More than 80% of PAs arise from the anterior division of the internal iliac artery. 
The superior vesical artery is one of the most common origins and is the first branch 
of the anterior division. Thus, when inside the internal iliac artery, the 5F catheter 
tip should be placed in the proximal part of the anterior division for a proper DSA

run with the oblique views described above. This way, PAs can be identified and 
reached. We usually leave the 5F catheter tip near the PA origin and use its torque 
capability to help guide the microcatheter inside the PAs. We first try to use the 
swan-neck 2.4F Maestro without a guidewire, which we use only if we are not able 
to get into the PA. The superior vesical artery origin is usually the most difficult to 
selective catheterize. When possible, placing the 5F catheter tip in the superior vesi-
cal origin to guide the microcatheter down into the PA can be useful. Another option 
is to use 0.016″ guidewires to help direct the microcatheter down, distally to the 
vesical branches into the PA.  If all that fails, coil embolization of the vesical 
branches can also be performed to help redirect flow of the embolics through reflux 
into the PA [4–6].
If two independent PAs are present, we embolize the central/cranial gland PA 
and leave the peripheral/caudal gland PA because BPH arises from the central 
gland. This way it is possible to induce selective central gland embolization and 
leave the peripheral prostate gland unembolized. If it is not possible to enter the 
central gland PA, we embolize the peripheral gland PA because there are fre-
quent anastomoses between ipsilateral central/peripheral gland PAs that allow 
embolic migration from the peripheral to the central gland of the prostate. 
Peripheral gland PAs have variable amounts of anastomoses to the rectum, while 
central gland PAs have anastomoses to the bladder and penis.
After reaching the PA, a DSA or cone-beam CT should be performed prior to 
embolization to identify anastomoses that may lead to non-target embolization 
of the bladder, rectum or penis that may be present in up to 60% of PAs. Most of 
the times, these are small-sized distal branches that can be avoided with a careful 
and slow injection of the embolics. However, these anastomoses can have con-
siderable sizes with higher risk of untargeted embolization. In these situations, 
coil block of these anastomoses should be performed prior to embolization to 
avoid embolic migration into prostate-surrounding organs. One specific type of 
these large anastomoses is the accessory pudendal artery that may provide 
arteries to both prostate and penis [4, 10–12].
6.4  PAE for Prostates Larger Than 100 cm3
The procedure is not necessarily easier in large prostates. Larger prostates do not 
correlate with larger PAs [5]. If a patient with a large prostate has duplicate PAs on 
both pelvic sides and is older and with atherosclerotic changes, he will have PAs 
smaller than those of a younger patient, with a 60 cm3 prostate but only one PA 
on each pelvic side. The number of PAs (and not prostate volume) correlates with 
PA trunk diameter [5]. However, the capsular and intra-prostatic branches of the 
PAs are larger in large prostates, making the typical corkscrew pattern of BPH 
nodule arteries easier to identify [5] (Fig. 6.2). PA origin, tortuosity and athero-
sclerosis are the most important predictors of technical success. Prostate volume 
was not different in patients with a successful bilateral PAE when compared with 
T. Bilhim et al.

81
those with only unilateral PAE [13], thus prostate volume failed to correlate with 
technical success.
Regarding the potential role of prostate volume as predictor of clinical outcome 
after PAE there is conflicting evidence. We have shown that larger prostates had the 
same outcome as smaller ones and that prostate volume did not predict treatment 
outcome [14]. These findings were supported by others [15]; however, there is one 
study concluding that larger prostate volumes were associated with better outcomes 
after PAE [16]. We have also shown that MR-detected prostate infarction after PAE 
correlates with treatment outcome (Fig. 6.3), with larger areas of prostate ischemia 
associated with better clinical outcomes [14]. Prostate infarction had a stronger cor-
relation with clinical outcome than prostate volume reduction after PAE [14]. 
However, prostate infarction correlated with prostate volume reduction and both

with treatment outcome [14, 17]. PAE can induce significant prostate volume reduc-
tion (19.1%) in the various prostate gland anatomical zones with median lobe reduc-
tions of 26.2%, central gland of 18.8% and peripheral gland of 16.4% [17]. As PAE 
acts through central gland prostate-tissue destruction addressing the dynamic and 
static peri-urethral components of LUTS, it leads to fewer changes in the overall 
prostate gland size, similar to removing the content of an orange with an intact skin, 
leaving it devoid of content but with an intact outer surface. This may explain why 
some patients have significant clinical improvement after PAE and no prostate vol-
ume reduction, whereas others have significant prostate volume reductions without 
clinical improvement.
In prostates larger than 100 cm3, PAE may be used as a preparatory step before 
prostate surgery for BPH patients. One to 3 months after PAE there is a substantial 
decrease in prostate volume that is sustained over time. This may allow a TURP 
procedure in some patients that would have to be treated with open surgery [18]. 
There are several published cohorts of BPH patients with large ­prostates treated by 
PAE [15, 16, 19–24], showing it to be safe and effective (Table 6.1). In these cohorts, 
mean prostate volume decreased from 110–140 to 71–91 cm3 (31%–58%). Mean 
PSA reduction ranged from 5%–70%; mean IPSS reduction ranged from 13–20 
points (49%–85%); mean QoL reduction ranged from 1.8–3.5 points (40%–73%) 
and mean Qmax increase ranged from 4–9.6 mL/s (40%–132%). The long-term 
results of PAE in 630 patients treated in our centre prove that PAE is a safe and 
effective technique with durable results [25]. We were able to collect data from 232 
patients at 3 years and 103 patients at 4 years after PAE with a clinical success rate 
of 81%. At the time of writing there is only one randomized controlled trial from 
China comparing 57 patients who underwent TURP with 57 patients who under-
went PAE [26]. At 24 months post-procedure, there were no significant differences 
in IPSS/QoL improvements or Qmax increase between the two groups. Clinical 
success rates were not significantly different between the two groups. However, 
prostate volume and PSA reductions were significantly larger in the TURP group. A 
retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database using propensity score 
matching to compare 80 patients who underwent PAE to 80 patients who underwent 
open prostatectomy at 12 months follow-up, showed that surgery induced a signifi-
cantly greater decrease in LUTS severity [27]. PSA reduction and Qmax increase 
were significantly better after surgery. PAE was associated with a significantly 
increased likelihood of persistent symptoms and persistent low Qmax but lower rate 
of adverse events with shorter hospitalization days and catheterization days. A 
recent meta-analysis of PAE [28] has shown that 12 months after PAE there is a 
mean prostate volume reduction of 31.31 cm3 (P < 0.001), a mean PVR reduction of 
85.54  mL (P  <  0.001), a mean IPSS and QoL improvements of 20.39 points 
(P < 0.001) and 2.49 points (P < 0.001) with a mean Qmax increase of 5.39 mL/s 
(P  <  0.001). PSA and IIEF remained unchanged. There were 32.93% of minor 
adverse events, the most common being rectalgia/dysuria (9.0%) and acute urinary 
retention (7.8%). There was no adverse effect on erectile function.
In conclusion, PAE is becoming established as a therapeutic alternative to sur-
gery with similar success in the improvement of LUTS and much fewer ­complications

Surgical Treatment: Enucleation 
of the Prostate
Rick Catterwell, Rick Popert, and Ben Challacombe
7.1  Introduction
Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) is a trans-urethral technique for 
bladder outflow obstruction with a history and evidence base spanning over two 
decades. During this time enucleation has benefited from continued advances in 
energy technologies, improved availability of these energy sources and evolution of 
the surgical technique. The method has been standardised with retrograde enucle-
ation of the prostate adenoma following its division into two or three anatomical 
lobes followed by mechanical morcellation of enucleated tissue. In the management 
of the large obstructive prostate, enucleation provides the benefits of endoscopic 
approaches while maintaining the anatomical considerations of open surgery.
The expanding transition zone adenoma in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) 
results in a defined tissue plane between the adenoma and peripheral zone [2]. With 
laser incision and manipulation by the beak of the resectoscope the adenoma is dis-
sected away from the peripheral zone. The enucleated tissue is dissected free into 
the bladder and then removed piecemeal from the bladder with a morcellation 
device. The utilization of the anatomical plane results in the removal of adenoma 
volume comparable to open/Millin’s prostatectomy and facilitates favorable haemo-
stasis. As laser enucleation is undertaken with saline irrigation and avoids dissection 
into prostatic venous channels the risk of post-­resection absorption syndrome is 
negligible and there is thus no limit to the size of prostate than can be approached 
and HoLEP is a therefore an excellent option for surgical management of prostates 
greater than 100 cc [3, 4].

Based on all available evidence, HoLEP offers patients a safe, more efficient, and 
at least equally efficacious, if not more efficacious, treatment for BPH related LUTS 
when compared to other standard surgical therapies. These benefits have been con-
sistently demonstrated in randomized controlled trials comparing HoLEP to TURP 
(see Table 7.1) and open prostatectomy [4–7]. Limited studies have been favourable 
for HoLEP compared to alternative laser treatments for BPH in regards to feasibility 
and durability with equivocal efficacy [8]. The result has been the emergence of 
laser enucleation of the prostate as the potential new gold standard for treating the 
symptomatic large prostate [9].
7.2  Patient Selection
The wide scope of patients appropriate for treatment with enucleation is an advan-
tage of this technique. Patients with symptomatic bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) 
due to BPH are appropriate regardless of prostate size [10]. Larger sized glands 
have a tendency for a more defined plane between adenoma and peripheral zone 
aiding enucleation. From an anaesthetic standpoint HoLEP generally requires a 
general anaesthetic and can last up to three hours in men with the largest glands. 
Thus suitable men will need to be able to be anaesthetized for this length of time. 
Postoperative incontinence has previously been a worry in the adoption of HoLEP 
and requires specific mentoring to optimize enucleation techniques at the apex. In 
addition the cohort of men undergoing HoLEP are often those with the largest 
glands whose external sphincters may have been inactive for a long time and will 
thus require focused post-operative pelvic floor muscle training to optimize 
outcomes.
In contrast to embolization or vaporization techniques the anatomical configura-
tion of the prostate is irrelevant and glands up to 500 cc in size have been success-
fully treated. Holmium laser enucleation is particularly suitable for the enlarged, 
intra-vesical median lobe where enucleation is effective and precise with minimal 
risk of injury to the trigone and ureteric orifices [2].

With the advantages of reduced fluid absorption, enhanced haemostasis, the use 
of saline irrigation and subsequent lack of post resection hyponatraemia syndrome 
there is reduced peri-operative cardio-vascular stress [3]. Although preference is for 
cessation of anti-coagulants prior to surgery the improved haemostatic properties of 
HoLEP have widened the scope in relation to patients where ceasing anti-coagulants 
is contra-indicated. HoLEP has been performed in patients on continued warfarin, 
clopidogrel or new generation anti-coagulant therapy (DOAC) [11, 12].
The presence of chronic urinary retention with confirmed detrusor under-­activity 
is particularly suitable for enucleation. Likely due to the larger prostatic channel 
formation HoLEP has been demonstrated to have favorable spontaneous voiding 
rates and reduced post void residual volumes in independent trials and in compari-
son with photoselective vaporization of the prostate [13].
Pre-operative assessment should include urine microscopy and culture with sur-
gery delayed for treatment of any active infection [14]. Symptomatology (IPSS) 
scores, voiding studies and PSA measurement allow pre- and post treatment evalu-
ation. Estimation of prostate size with MRI or ultrasound is essential to advise 
patients, anaesthetists and for operating scheduling. Flexible cystoscopy is indi-
cated if symptomatology or voiding flow studies suggest urethral stricture. Treatment 
of any urethral stricture disease and an observed period of stabilization of at least 6 
months is recommended prior to enucleation.
7.3  Equipment
Enucleation of the prostate and subsequent extraction of the enucleated tissue from 
the bladder requires several specific equipment considerations. A 26F continuous 
flow sheath is combined with a laser resectoscope either with a dedicated laser 
channel facilitating thumb controlled advancement of the laser fibre (Fig. 7.1b) or a 
laser inner sheath with a stabilizing guide. If the latter is used the fibre is passed 
through a ureteric catheter and interlink port (Fig. 7.1a) which is passed through the 
stabilizing circular ring with in the inner lumen of the inner sheath.
7.3.1  Laser
The Holmium:YAG laser is a pulsed solid state laser, with a wavelength of 2140 nm 
that acts through a predominately photothermal mechanism. On soft tissue this 
laser has an absorption depth of only 0.4 mm with tissue ablated faster than heat 
is conducted into surrounding tissue. As a result the holmium laser is ideal for 
cleanly ablating without charring or overheating adjacent tissue. In contrast to 
the KTP ‘Greenlight” laser, the Holmium wavelength is highly absorbed by saline

or water. With separation from fibre to tissue of 4 mm, less than 1% of energy 
reaches the tissue, greatly reducing risk of unintended vaporization of distant tissue 
such as the posterior bladder wall or trigone.
In the historical development of laser surgery for BPH early techniques com-
bined the use of Holmium:YAG (Yttrium-Aluminium-Garnet) and neodymium 
(Nd:YAG) lasers. The combination endoscopic laser ablation of the prostate 
(CELAP) utilized the cutting properties of the Ho:YAG laser and the coagulation 
properties of the Nd:YAG laser. This technique was complicated by significant 
indwelling catheter times post operatively, ranging from 4.1 to 7.1 days. In ­addition 
many patients had significant irritative voiding symptoms and subsequent episodes 
of urinary retention.
With advances in technique and technology it became evident at sufficient power 
the Holmium laser had adequate haemostatic effects. By the late 1990s Kabalin had 
demonstrated in canine and human studies that haemostatic vaporization of prostate 
tissue was achieved with the Holmium laser alone using high power ranges of 
50–80 W. Its localized coagulation effect ‘seals’ the tissue and provides hemostasis 
superior to electrocautery instruments without producing deeper thermal injury 
associated with Nd:YAG laser.
As a tissue vaporizing instrument the Holmium laser is not efficient. Initial appli-
cation of this laser for a purely vaporizing technique resulted in the holmium laser 
ablation of the prostate, termed HoLAP. This resulted in less necrosis of adjacent 
tissue and irritative symptoms compared with the combination procedures using the 
Nd:YAG laser. Although irritative symptoms and sloughing were reduced operative 
times were prolonged and the technique therefore restricted to small prostates or as 
part of a HoLEP learning process.

Gilling et al. in 1996 were the first to describe a holmium laser resection of the 
prostate. This technique was the first to utilize the cutting properties of the holmium 
laser to detach large sections of adenoma tissue. The absence of post-­operative dilu-
tional hyponatraemia and transfusion requirements were reproduced in numerous 
published series over multiple centers.
Over the subsequent two decades the application of high powered holmium 
lasers as a cutting and coagulating tool have been further advanced with the 
ability to adjust the laser pulse width. The same energy output delivered in 
shorter pulse duration enhances the lasers’ cutting properties. As a result tissue 
planes are more easily demonstrated with minimal charring of adjacent tissue. 
Conversely with the energy delivered over wide pulse duration an increase in 
penetration and width of effect results in an enlarged heat affected zone and 
increased heat conduction time. This has a clinical effect of improving the coagu-
lation ability of the holmium laser. Although not essential for the procedure, dual 
setting, high energy, holmium laser units up to 120  W have become increasing 
popular for enucleation.
Various authors advocate different laser settings. Expert opinion varies with a 
frequency between 30–50 Hz and energy of 1.8–2.0 J [2, 14]. There is a paucity of 
published literature advocating wide pulse width settings on dual setting units 
with manufacturers’ recommendations suggesting reduced energy (1.2–1.6  J) 
with similar frequency (30–40 Hz).
7.3.2  Morcellation
Initial descriptions of Holmium resection of the prostate by Gilling and Fraundorfer 
involved the resection of tailored fragments of prostate that could be removed with 
the aid of either a modified resectoscope loop or Ellik evacuator [15]. The addition 
of mechanical morcellation of resected prostatic tissue, originally via a supra-pubic 
tract and later trans-urethrally, facilitated complete enucleation of the prostate. 
Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate was thus truly conceived by Gilling and 
Fraundorfer with the addition of mechanical morcellation [16].
The mechanical morcellator consists of a hand-piece with 5-mm reciprocating 
blades (Fig. 7.3). Control is via a multiple staged foot control, which engages pro-
gressively from zero suction, suction, suction with low speed blade reciprocation 
and suction with high-speed blade reciprocation. This is passed down a long neph-
roscope which is connected to the 26F outer sheath by a specific adapter. Double 
inflow irrigation is recommended to ensure bladder distention during morcellation 
thus reducing the risk of bladder injury.

92
7.4  Technique
Enucleation can be performed with general or spinal anaesthesia although many 
units prefer a general anaesthetic to reduce the chance of excessive movement, 
particularly during the morcellation phase of the procedure. Haemostasis can be 
challenging if adequate systolic blood pressure control is not achieved.
The patient is positioned in lithotomy with adequate hip flexion and abduction to 
facilitate the range of scope manipulation required. Single dose broad-­spectrum 
prophylactic antibiotics and mechanical DVT prevention are recommended.
7.4.1  Enucleation
A routine cystoscopy is performed to exclude any concomitant pathology such as 
urethral stricture, bladder calculi or bladder lesion. In the presence of urethral stric-
ture enucleation should be aborted until the stricture is treated and sufficiently fol-
lowed up without recurrence. Bladder calculi are easily managed with the holmium 
laser prior to commencing the enucleation. Dilatation of the anterior urethral to 30F 
with serial sounds is then performed to allow easy passage of the 26F continuous 
flow resectoscope.
Bilateral bladder neck incisions are then made, extending from bladder neck to 
verumontanum. These incisions are extended to the level of the surgical capsule, a 
clearly identified smooth fibrous layer (Fig. 7.2). If no median lobe is present, a 
single incision can be made at the 6 o’clock position. With each encountered bleed-

93
ing vessel haemostasis is achieved via either defocusing the laser by retracting it 
from the tissue slightly or utilizing the broad pulse width setting with a dual setting 
laser unit.
The bladder neck incisions are sculpted medial along their course from the blad-
der neck to the verumontanum leaving a midline strip of tissue attaching the median 
lobe to the surgical capsule (Fig. 7.3). Commencing from just proximal to the veru-
montanum the bladder neck incisions are connected. The beak of the resectoscope

is used to elevate the median lobe to facilitate demonstration of the remaining fibres 
connecting the median lobe to the capsule which are divided (Fig. 7.4). By working 
from side to side, from each medialized bladder neck incision, the strip of remaining 
tissue is divided and the median lobe is enucleated. The location of the ureteric 
orifices should be closely monitored during the final manipulation of the enucle-
ation at the bladder neck to avoid injury.
Enucleation of the lateral lobes begins with identification of the surgical plane at 
the level of the verumontanum. The surgical plane is expanded using a combination 
of scope manipulation and laser energy laterally to define the apex. The plane is also 
advanced proximally (Fig. 7.5).
Once the apex has been defined to the 2 o’clock position attention moves to the 
anterior prostate. A midline incision anteriorly is made from bladder neck back to 
the level of the verumontanum. The bladder neck mucosa is sculpted laterally from 
this incision and the incision is deepened and extended laterally and distally expos-
ing the surgical plane from above (Fig. 7.6).
The upper and lower incisions are connected at the apex by laser incision of the 
joining mucosal bridge and the lateral lobe is enucleated in the capsular plane, 
working from the upper to lower incisions in a manner analogous to the median lobe 
enucleation (Fig. 7.7).
Meticulous consideration of haemostasis should be undertaken prior to morcel-
lation as optimal vision is needed before commencing morcellation and it is ineffi-
cient to go back to using the laser after this point.

7.4.2  Morcellation
To facilitate morcellation the continuous flow inner sheath is replaced with a long, 
‘off-set’ nephroscope and adaptor. Avoiding bladder decompression during this 
change of instruments can aid vision. The bladder is fully distended and the 5 mm 
bladed morcellator is introduced down the nephroscope working channel. Suction is 
activated by the foot pedal, allowing prostate fragments to be engaged and posi-
tioned at the bladder neck with the morcellator jaws directed upwards and away 
from the trigone (Fig. 7.8). Small fragments, resistant to morcellation, are removed 
with either a grasping loop or Ellik evacuator.

During early series morcellation was associated with a high incidence of bladder 
mucosal injury. Maintenance of irrigating fluid during morcellation should be fas-
tidious. A simple modification of technique making use of double irrigation has vir-
tually eliminated this complication [17]. Irrigation flows through both the ‘normal 
inflow’ via the nephroscope and also via the ‘normal out flow’ from the outer 26F 
sheath. Actual outflow is from the morcellator hand piece only. This double inflow 
maintains bladder distention, keeping the mucosa away from the morcellator blades.
7.5  Comparison
Over the past two decades HoLEP has had a massive impact on the management of 
men with obstructive large prostates [9]. Previously men with adenomas too large 
for endoscopic resection (>100 cc) were directed towards open prostatectomy (OP). 
Favorable results have been consistently demonstrated for HoLEP compared to OP 
in relation to transfusion rates, length of hospitalization and catheterization [6, 7, 
18]. More recently alternative surgical techniques to HoLEP have been suggested 
although evidence in larger prostates is sparse with concerns regarding feasibility 
and durability in large glands [8, 19].
There is robust evidence demonstrating HoLEP has favorable outcomes regard-
less of prostate size. Kuntz, et al. [10] detail a prospective series of 389 patients 
stratified by prostate size (<40, 40–79 and >80 g). 121 (31.5%) of the cohort had 
prostates greater than 80 g (range 80–260 g). They found no differences in periop-
erative morbidity and postoperative micturition improvement across the cohorts. 
No patients required blood transfusion. There was no significant difference in

duration of catheterization or admission. Similarly, Lingeman et al. [20] retrospec-
tively reviewed 507 patients stratified into three groups based on preoperative vol-
ume measurements. They found no significant difference in hospital stay, 
catheterization time, post-operative AUA-SS, and post-operative Q max among the 
three groups.
7.5.1  HoLEP vs. OP
Several randomized control trials (RCTs) have directly compared HoLEP and OP 
outcomes. Montorsi et al. [6] performed a randomized prospective trial comparing 
HoLEP and OP in 80 patients with obstructive symptoms and estimated prostate 
volumes >70  g. They demonstrated significantly lower transfusion rate (4% vs. 
17.9%), quicker time to removal of catheter (1.5 vs. 4.1 days) and shorter length of 
hospitalization (2.7 vs. 5.4 days) in favor of HoLEP. Functional results for HoLEP 
were similar to OP over the 2-year follow-up period. Moody and Lingeman, et al. 
[15] retrospectively compared HoLEP to OP in prostates >100 g and found that 
patients who underwent HoLEP benefitted from a minimal change in postoperative 
hemoglobin (1.3 vs. 2.9 g/dL) and shorter length of stay (2.1 vs. 6.1 days) despite a 
greater amount of adenoma resected (151 vs. 106 g). Symptom score improvement 
was equivalent between groups.
7.5.2  HoLEP vs. PVP
Greenlight photo vaporization of the prostate (PVP) is the most well established 
laser alternative to TURP and HoLEP. It utilizes the coupling of a Nd:YAG laser with 
a potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) crystal resulting in a halving of the laser 
wavelength to 532  nm. This visible laser has substantially different laser-tissue 
interaction properties than the uncoupled Nd:YAG laser. The KTP laser beam is 
highly absorbed by hemoglobin inside prostatic tissue resulting in rapid photother-
mal vaporization of heated intracellular water and efficient vaporization of prostatic 
adenoma. The coagulation zone thickness (1-2 mm) is relatively shallow compared 
to the Nd:YAG laser (7 mm) reducing coagulation necrosis associated post-opera-
tive dysuria and sloughing [21]. Less favorably the laser beam is fully transmitted 
through irrigation fluid with risk of distant site injury to the bladder wall especially 
during median lobe vaporization.
Technological advances in the power output from KTP lasers have improved the 
rate of vaporization and facilitated treatment of larger adenomas [19, 21]. 
Improvement from the initially underpowered 80  W KTP laser to the high-­
powered 120 W and now 180 W models has undoubtedly improved outcomes. As a 
result comparison is complicated and long term follow up regarding the durability 
of PVP treatment in large glands is sparse.
7  Surgical Treatment: Enucleation of the Prostate

100
Few RCTs comparing HoLEP and PVP have been performed. Elmansy et al. [8] 
reported the first randomized controlled clinical trial comparing HoLEP to PVP 
using a 120 W KTP laser and included cohorts with large prostates of comparable 
volumes (91.3 g vs. 89.3 g). There was no significant difference in IPSS, quality of 
life, or sexual function at one year. The HoLEP cohort had a significantly higher 
maximal flow rate and lower post void residual. Intra-operatively 22% of PVP 
patients required conversion to either HoLEP or TURP due bleeding that was 
uncontrollable with the PVP laser. In the converted cases, a mean of 46 g of fur-
ther prostate tissue was removed by HoLEP or TURP.
An initial multicenter RCT comparing HoLEP and PVP with a 180 W KTP laser 
outcomes has demonstrated no difference in morbidity rates, re-intervention 
rates or length of hospital stay. Despite prostate size reduction being greater in 
the HoLEP cohort there was no significant difference in symptoms scores between 
the two groups to the study end point of 12 months [19].
7.5.3  Durability
The durability of HoLEP results has been extensively studied and is a major strength 
of the technique. Several studies have followed HoLEP patients for between 5 and 
10 years, with a re-operation rate of less than 1%. Gilling et al. [22] reported in a 
RCT of HoLEP vs. TURP a reoperation rate of zero vs. 18% at 7 years in the 
HoLEP and TURP cohorts respectively. Kuntz [18] et al. also reported a reoperation 
rate of zero at 5 years for men with prostates >100 g who underwent HoLEP.
7.6  Limitations of HoLEP and Learning Curve
Despite its many potential advantages there is little doubt that the HoLEP procedure 
has a significant learning curve and that one is certainly better and more efficient 
after 200 procedures than one was after 50. The learning curve is therefore not steep 
but shallow as it takes many cases to become truly proficient. In terms of the learn-
ing curve for safety and enucleation efficiency (enucleated weight/enucleation time) 
and morcellation efficiency this seems to be around 40–60 cases for larger prostates 
[23] but may be only 25 cases in smaller glands [24].
Initial concerns about damage to the external sphincter and morcellation injury 
to the bladder during the learning period have reduced as the surgical technique has 
been standardised and modern dedicated equipment has evolved. It has been shown 
that older men with larger prostates are more vulnerable to post operative inconti-
nence and also that mentored surgeons caused less incontinence than those learning 
in isolation [25]. There are now good educational videos available on line with dedi-
cated courses at most major urological meetings. However, without an experienced 
mentor and a dedicated team approach those attempting HoLEP are not always uni-

versally successful in making the procedure part of their standard repertoire [26]. 
Learning should therefore be carefully planned with a gradual increase in case com-
plexity/prostate size as experience increases [27].
7.7  HoLEP and Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance 
in the Large Prostate
Rising prostate specific antigen in men with lower urinary tract symptoms can be a 
cause of concern, especially for patients on active surveillance for low-risk prostate 
cancer. PSA often reflects transition zone hyperplasia in large prostates even with 
co-existing low risk prostate cancer. Many men have already undergone a prostatic 
biopsy and are concerned about prostate cancer risk. Popert et al. in retrospective 
study of 30 patients undergoing HoLEP on a background of low risk prostate cancer 
on active surveillance demonstrated a median reduction in PSA of 85% with a 
median resection of 94 g [28]. The reduction in PSA has been demonstrated to 
highly correlate to the amount of prostatic tissue removed [20] and provide huge 
reassurance to this cohort of men.
Removal of the transition zone via HoLEP significantly reduces PSA resulting in 
PSA becoming more cancer specific. Most post HoLEP PSA levels are in the 
1–2 μg/L range and thus any significant rise above this new baseline or failure of 
the PSA to drop post HoLEP is likely to signify significant prostate cancer. These 
men need education on their new post HoLEP PSA levels as do their primary care 
providers in order to react to any future rise. With prostate cancer progression 
requiring active treatment, reduction in gland size with HoLEP may facilitate 
prostate cancer treatment options normally precluded by gland volume such as 
brachytherapy or external beam radiation [28].
7.8  Conclusion
There have been many procedures proposed as alternatives to TURP for the surgical 
treatment of BOO secondary to BPH. With advancing life expectancy the incidence 
of prostatic enlargement beyond what was traditionally feasible for endoscopic 
resection is increasing.
The ideal procedure to manage both the large obstructing prostate is minimally 
invasive, effective, durable and associated with low morbidity and complication 
rates. Ideally it would be a technique that is applicable to all prostate sizes and ana-
tomical configurations. The evidence base in support of HoLEP is more extensive 
than that for any other alternative. HoLEP is at least as effective as other surgical 
therapies, including TURP, OP and other laser modalities, with fewer complica-
tions, shorter hospital stays, and decreased catheter time. In the larger gland, includ-
ing those greater than 100 cc, HoLEP stands alone as the gold standard. Morbidity,

102
complication and reoperation rates appear lower than alternatives with durability 
confirmed over 10 years of follow up.
The HoLEP procedure has now passed the tests of safety, efficacy, and durability. 
It is a strong contender for the new gold standard for endoscopic BPH surgery in 
prostates of all sizes especially for larger glands. The challenge for HoLEP is con-
tinued expansion of its clinical application, to shed perceptions of difficulties in 
adopting the technique via improved mentoring and teaching during structured uro-
logical training.

8.1  Introduction
Transurethral photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) has evolved as an 
electrosurgical adaptation of the classical transurethral resection of the prostate 
(TURP) in the management of bladder outflow obstruction (BOO). Improvements 
in Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (laser) technology have 
shown potential for excellent haemostasis, a reduction in morbidity and good func-
tional outcomes. The increasing role of PVP as a true ‘day case’ procedure has 
made it an attractive focus for clinicians and hospital managers in the age of health-
care economics.
The application of lasers in urology has been recognised and incorporated into 
the EAU and AUA guidelines in selected patients with BOO. TURP remains the 
transurethral standard for comparison, but in larger prostates, a prolonged resection 
time is invariably required. Historically, many surgeons would choose an open pros-
tatectomy (OP) in this patient group to avoid the morbidity relating to bleeding and/
or possible development of TUR syndrome.
This chapter will address the emerging utility, safety and efficacy profile of PVP 
as a valid alternative treatment of BOO in men with large prostates, including those 
over 100 mL, and the challenges that this modality presents.

8.2  Mechanism of Action
Potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser prostatectomy was first described by 
Kuntzman and colleagues in a comparative functional study against a 
Neodymium:Yttrium-Aluminum-Garnet (Nd:YAG) laser in canines in 1996 [1]. 
KTP vaporization was found to be significantly superior, with instantaneous reduc-
tion in prostate volume and spontaneous post-operative voiding. This was unlike the 
coagulative necrosis triggered by the Nd:YAG laser: which took weeks for the pros-
tatic tissue to slough off and was often associated with storage symptoms.
GreenLight laser vaporisation differs in technique to laser enucleation of the 
prostate. Prostatic tissue is entirely vaporised, rather than enucleated and mechani-
cally morcellated. The 532  nm wavelength generated by the KTP crystal falls 
within the visible green zone of the electromagnetic spectrum; hence ‘GreenLight’ 
laser. This accounts for its near exclusive absorption by haemoglobin, and not 
water; thus its enhanced ability to secure haemostasis within highly vascularised 
prostatic tissue [2].
The feasibility of the 80 W KTP PVP was subsequently trialled in humans (pros-
tate volumes of 24–76 mL) with BPH by Malek et al. in 1998 [3]. This was replaced 
by the high-performance system (HPS) GreenLight 120 W (532 nm) laser which 
was introduced in 2006. GreenLight HPS used a Lithium Triborate (LBO) crystal in 
the place of KTP [4]. It has been further superseded by the 180 W GreenLight 
Xcelerated Performance System (XPS) in 2010 (American Medical Systems, 
Minnetonka, MI). Unlike earlier generations, the MoXy fibre within the XPS is a 
750 nm side-firing laser with a 70° forward deflection. It also includes a steel-tipped 
cap and fibre cooling to prevent overheating and optimise fibre durability (i.e. one 
fibre per case). Compared to the HPS, the beam surface area is augmented from 0.28 
to 0.44 mm2 [5]. The laser is fired in a quasi-continuous wave laser rapid pulse to 
elicit vaporisation through a 23–26F cystoscope with normal saline irrigation fluid 
on continuous flow [6]. Compared to GreenLight HPS in prostate volumes of 
>80 mL, similar amounts of energy are used in significantly less time (P = 0.001) 
[7]. The ease at which an operative working channel can be created, reduces the risk 
of excess fluid absorption and dilutional hyponatraemia in these patients.
8.3  Operative Technique
GreenLight PVP can be performed under light general or regional anaesthesia; as 
there is no risk of TUR syndrome, even in massive prostates [8]; most experts avoid 
spinal anaesthesia. Unlike TURP, there is not always tissue for histopathological 
examination at the end of the procedure (transperineal biopsy is simple however if 
clinically indicated). The technique is non-contact (optimum fibre tissue dis-
tance = 1–2 mm). The pilot beam is used to guide the dissemination of energy 
evenly by a systematic “three-dimensional, sagittal, rotating and lateral motion of

the fibre” [6]. An appropriate sweep speed is required to prevent carbonisation and 
ineffective ablation. Failure to do so may result in overheating and damage of the 
fibre and/or scope from heat reflection. The vaporisation results in vapour bubbles, 
which are carried away by the continuous flow setup with gravity inflow and 
outflow.
There is an increasing availability of validated computer simulation programmes 
to promote a sustained and standardised level of procedural excellence in GreenLight 
laser prostatectomies. Training and assessment of operative technique can be under-
taken safely for small, medium and large glands (Figs. 8.1 and 8.2). The learning 
curve of proficiency for GreenLight prostatectomy builds upon fundamental prin-
ciples of safe transurethral electrosurgical techniques and is comparably less techni-
cally challenging than HoLEP [9].
8.4  Adverse Events and Sexual Function
The search for alternative surgical modalities for BPH relates to the ongoing rate of 
morbidity associated with TURP. Teng et al. undertook a comparative systematic 
review and meta-analysis of RCTs and non-RCTs (n = 9) evaluating TURP and 
GreenLight laser PVP outcome data. Overall, the rates of bleeding (requiring

transfusion RR =5.88, 95% CI:1.92–18.3, P  =  0.002) capsular perforation 
(RR = 9.28, 95%CI: 2.79–30.88, P = 0.001) and TUR syndrome (RR =5.31, 95% 
CI:1.18–23.94, P = 0.003) were shown to be considerably lower in the PVP groups 
than for those undergoing TURP [10].
Another recent meta-analysis identified six RCTs evaluating PVP with 
GreenLight HPS 120 W device against monopolar TURP (697 patients). Statistical 
significance was demonstrated with reduced peri-procedural transfusion rate (OR: 
0.10; P < 0.00001) and reduced duration of post-operative catheterisation following 
PVP (mean difference: 32.36 h; P < 0.00001). Accordingly, the length of stay was 
shorter relative to the TURP patients (mean difference: 32.36 hours; P < 0.00001). 
Post-procedural re-catheterisation and urinary tract infection rates were comparable 
in the two groups [11]. Long-term comparative outcome data were not available 
between the two groups beyond 12 months in these series. Very few prospective 
studies have addressed this in large prostates over 100 mL.
A prospective multicentre non-randomised study of GreenLIght XPS showed 
excellent outcomes and safety in a group of over 200 patients of whom the majority 
were on some form of ongoing anticoagulation and over a quarter had prostate vol-
umes greater than 80 mL [12].
Skolarikos et al. report outcomes of GreenLight laser prostatectomy (n = 65) 
compared against a control arm of OP (n = 60) for patients with prostate volumes 
greater than 80 mL in their prospective RCT. 7.7% of the GreenLight laser group

required additional intraoperative conversion to TURP for haemostasis. Overall 
18-month follow-up results corroborated with earlier data showing a statistically 
significant shorter period of hospitalisation and catheterisation post-procedure, with 
non-inferior functional outcomes for GreenLight laser [13].
One concern is the perceived need for ‘retreatment’ of patients undergoing 
GreenLight laser prostatectomy. An RCT by Al-Ansari et al. cited re-operation rates 
of as high as 11% over 36 months; all were in prostate volumes greater than 80 mL 
[14]. However the energy used in this study was not reported. Interestingly, 3-year 
outcome data from an American multicentre evaluation of the technique demon-
strated a re-intervention rate for Greenlight HPS of 4.3%, however there was no 
sub-group analysis of the effect of prostate volume on this rate [15].
The meta-analysis by Teng et al. confirmed a higher re-intervention rate than 
those in the TURP groups studied (RR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.10–0.59, P = 0.002) [10]. 
It should be noted however, that although bigger glands may display a correlation 
with a higher rate of retreatment in initial series, the question for future trials 
(assessing XPS) should address whether adequate energy per mL of prostate tissue 
was delivered.
The topic of sexual dysfunction in relation to GreenLight laser prostatectomy in 
large glands over 100 mL is poorly characterised in the literature. As with all surgi-
cal modalities for BOO, this is in part related to the co-existence of LUTS and 
erectile dysfunction. Theoretically, efficacious bladder outflow obstruction surgery 
relieves LUTS and thus the need to take 5-ARI and/or alpha blockers, which are 
associated independently with libido reduction and retrograde/anejaculation respec-
tively. The randomised prospective trial by Horasanli et al. (n = 81) demonstrated 
similar rates of retrograde ejaculation rates in TURP (56.7%) and GreenLight laser 
groups (49.9% p = 0.21) at 36-months follow-up [16]. In comparison with HoLEP, 
the rate of retrograde ejaculation in previously sexually active patients within a 
prospective RCT was significantly lower in GreenLight PVP (28.5% vs. 88%) [17]. 
The authors felt this reflected the extent of tissue removal in the two groups.
It has been postulated that laser ablation of prostatic tissue, which requires 
augmented laser energy per unit of prostate, may have a detrimental effect on 
adjacent cavernous nerves and thus influence sexual function. This is thought to 
be due to increased transmitted heat which may extend beyond the penetration 
depth of the laser [18]. Capsular perforation is known to be an independent risk 
factor for erectile dysfunction in prostatic resection; the extent of penile nerve 
damage has been established in previous studies evaluating TURP with neuro-
physiological testing [19].
Elshal et al., in a longitudinal study, propose that post-operative erectile dysfunc-
tion is perceived to be more significant in patients with previously normal function 
prior to GreenLight Laser prostatectomy [18]. This effect has not been confirmed in 
other multicentre studies which have stringently assessed sexual function. 
Contemporary erectile dysfunction rates are reported as less than 1% with 
GreenLight PVP [12, 20] a rate which is reflected in our own clinical practice. We 
do however support the role of pre-operative sexual function assessment and coun-
selling for all patients.

8.5  Photoselective Vaporization of the Prostate in the Very 
Large Prostate
There remains distinct heterogeneity in the literature regarding the exact definition 
of a ‘large’ prostate. Big glands are associated with a rapid rate of adenomatous 
enlargement [21, 22]. There is no consensus on exactly how prostate volume should 
determine surgical approach.
Data specifically examining the use of PVP in the larger prostate is limited. 
Rajbabu et al. published a contemporary prospective series of 54 patients with BOO 
whose prostates were greater than 100  mL in size (mean: 135  mL, range 
100–300 mL). Their results confirmed that the 80 W KTP laser PVP led to sustained 
improvements in flow rate. The mean (SD) improvement in Qmax was 8.0 (3.1) to 
18.2 (8.1), 18.5 (9.2), 17.9 (7.8) and 19.3 (9.8) mL/s at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months 
respectively. The IPSS and Quality of life scores demonstrated a similarly favour-
able trend post-procedure [23]. Despite using only the 80 W laser and despite many 
of these patients having significant co-morbidities, excellent safety and medium-­
term results were demonstrated.
At the time of writing, the GOLIATH study is the only published multicentre, 
multinational RCT to evaluate the XPS 180 W PVP. This was found to be non-­
inferior to TURP in relation to functional outcomes of IPSS, Qmax and complica-
tion rates at 6  months [24]. Subsequent 2-year follow up data [20] confirmed 
consistent durable effectiveness and safety compared to TURP, irrespective of pros-
tate size. It should be noted however, that men with prostates larger than 100 mL 
were excluded from this study on the basis of TURP being potentially unsafe for 
them. GLXPS (n = 136): mean prostate volume: 48.6 mL ± 19.2 mL (SD) versus 
TURP (n = 133) mean volume: 46.2 ± 19.1 mL (SD). Nonetheless, bleeding related 
complications and recovery were significantly better in the GreenLight laser group.
Early results from a small (n = 35), single centre series using 180 W GreenLight 
PVP in prostates greater than 100 mL (median: 132, Range: 118-157 mL) retrospec-
tively reported promising equivalent outcomes to previous trials comparing PVP 
with the other modalities of TURP and OP at 3 and 6 months. Of note, 31% of this 
cohort were taking anticoagulants (which were not withheld). There were no blood 
transfusions required in this series [25].
Araki et al. undertook a prospective evaluation of GreenLight laser in patients on 
medical therapy for BPH. It has previously been suggested that the downregulation 
of prostatic angiogenesis in patients on long term 5-alpha reductase inhibitors may 
affect the efficiency of GreenLight laser usage. This study demonstrated no signifi-
cant difference in laser time/total energy usage and comparable outcomes in the 
presence and absence of 5-ARI supplementation [26].
The effectiveness of GreenLight in patients on anticoagulation has generated 
interest amongst researchers. Sandu et al. undertook a retrospective cohort analysis 
of 24 men with a mean prostate volume of 82 cc (range 34–164 cc). Each was in 
receipt of anticoagulation and underwent GreenLight laser PVP. Warfarin was held 
for 2 days pre-operatively, aspirin and clopidogrel were not stopped in the remain-

ing patients. None of these high-risk cardiac patients had clinically significant hae-
maturia, clot retention or thromboembolic events post-operatively. All patients were 
discharged within 23 h and 92% of men had successful trial without catheter prior 
to discharge [27].
More recently, the outcome data from GreenLight laser PVP in specific patient 
groups was published from a larger multi-centre prospective study (n = 305) by Woo 
et al.; it included anticoagulated patients (n = 62) and those with prostate volumes 
of >80 mL (n = 52); (mean = 118.4 mL, SD = 34.9 mL). There was a 233.3% 
improvement in Qmax for patients with prostate volumes greater than 80 mL (mean: 
5.8 mL/s SD: 3.4) at baseline compared to follow up at mean follow up of 4.2 months 
(mean: 19.7 mL/s SD: 9.1). 185% improvement was reported in those with a pros-
tate volume of less than 80 mL at baseline (mean: 7.6 mL/s SD 4.4) and at follow 
up (mean: 21.7 mL/s SD: 10.3).
Clavien-Dindo complications (>2) were comparable in prevalence in both small 
and larger prostates. There was no statistical difference in functional outcome 
between those taking versus not taking anticoagulation. There was a 50.8% reduc-
tion in prostate volume for those on anticoagulation (mean 72.7 mL SD 36.8 at 
baseline and 35.8 SD16.2 at follow up), and a 44.2% reduction for those not on 
anticoagulation (mean: 58.2 SD 33.1 and 32.5 SD 17.4 at baseline and follow up 
respectively). There was no significant difference in length of stay and period of 
catheterisation post-procedure between prostate volume groups [28].
Although this study was limited by its mean follow-up time of 4.2 months, it was 
concluded that unlike TURP, anticoagulation is not a contraindication for 
GreenLight laser prostatectomy and should be considered routinely in high risk 
cardiac patients.
In our experience, increasing prostate size correlates with an increase in opera-
tive duration and energy utilisation with GreenLight Laser PVP. This has signifi-
cantly improved with the introduction of the 180 W XPS laser fibre and will continue 
to do so with ongoing modifications. We believe that the key technical consideration 
in managing prostates >100 cc is the creation of the working channel to optimise 
irrigation flow and thus vision (Fig.  8.3). This can be achieved following early 
vaporisation of occlusive lateral lobes. If a significant middle lobe is evident, avoid 
undue pivotal movements at the bladder neck as this can precipitate bleeding and 
impair the visual field. Sometimes, visualisation of the ureteric orifices must be 
deferred until the middle lobe has been reduced.
We believe that any surgeon proficient in TURP would find it straightforward to 
adapt to the GreenLight laser technique, following demonstration of competency in 
the simulation setting. It is important that the surgeon is patient when commencing 
GreenLight laser, as the sweep speed required is slower and working distance 
increased compared to that associated with a loop resectoscope. The mechanics of 
the technique involve co-ordination of the dominant and non-dominant hands to 
control the scope and fibre respectively. We recommend from experience that larger 
glands should not be tackled until fully confident operating on smaller prostates.
The EAU guidelines support GreenLight laser as a “safe method for volume 
reduction in large sized prostate glands” and “safe and effective for patients receiv-

ing anticoagulation medication or patients in retention” [29]. In 2016, The National 
Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued a resource impact report 
in which GreenLight XPS was compared with TURP. Cost-modelling analysis esti-
mated a cost-reduction potential of £60 per GreenLight patient. Extrapolating their 
data on the basis of proportional day case procedures in low-risk patients for both 
modalities, they predicted an annual saving with PVP of £2.3 million in NHS 
England [30]. Table 8.1 describes the advantages and disadvantages of GreenLight 
PVP compared to conventional TURP.

8.6  Discussion
The ‘big prostate’ remains a significant benign urological pathology, commonly 
requiring surgical intervention. The number of patients referred for operative man-
agement is likely to increase with an ageing population. Within an elderly popula-
tion, the proportion of men with significant comorbidities who need surgery is likely 
to increase. It is not uncommon that patients referred for surgery are on long-term 
anticoagulation. A modality such as GreenLight Laser, which affords a reduced risk 
of bleeding that negates the need for bridging therapy and demonstrates comparable 
functional outcomes in a day case setting is an exciting prospect.
In an ideal world, emerging prospective, well-designed RCTs would directly 
compare GreenLight laser prostatectomy against all operative modalities for large 
volume BPH. Funding and cohort heterogeneity make recruitment difficult. Current 
outcome data available support the efficacious, non-inferiority of laser ablative ther-
apy in the management of large prostates in the long-term. Table 8.2 describes some 
of the main studies comparing Greenlight PVP with other treatment modalities for 
the large prostate.
As with the adoption of any new surgical technique, the use of simulation in the 
context of a formal, certified training programme with synchronous mentorship, is 
recommended to improve the procedure-specific aptitude, safety profile and confi-
dence of the surgeon undertaking GreenLight laser prostatectomy in large prostates.
It could be argued that patients with very large prostates should only be managed 
in centres where a number of the modern management techniques for large prostates 
are offered. We believe that a bespoke approach respecting each patient’s status and 
aspirations will allow the best outcomes in this difficult group of patients.
8.7  Conclusion
GreenLight laser is a very safe option even for men with significant co-morbidities 
and can be offered to almost any man with LUTS or retention regardless of prostate 
size or general health status. In both of our centres it is routine to manage high risk 
and anticoagulated patients with prostates over 100  mL as outpatient day case

procedures, often sending even these patients home without a catheter. Risks of 
bleeding, perforation and incontinence are very small. The early benefits need to be 
set against what will likely be a longer-term re-operation rate that is higher than for 
full laser enucleation. However for those more elderly men the rates of reoperation 
at 10–20 years may not be as important.

Surgical Treatment: Transurethral Resection 
of the Prostate
Maria Vedanayagam and Ian Dickinson
9.1  Introduction
Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) was introduced in the early twentieth 
century and has since evolved with various adaptations to the technique.
TURP is currently the standard recommended surgical procedure for men with 
bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) with prostate sizes between 30 
and 80 mL [1]. For prostates larger than 80 mL, retropubic or suprapubic prosta-
tectomy has traditionally been regarded the surgical standard, especially in 
developing countries [1].
The European Association of Urology (EAU) also recommends Holmium Laser 
Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP) and bipolar enucleation as the current standard 
for prostates >80 mL. TURP still has a role in this group of patients, although it is 
not recommended as a first choice by the EAU [1]. This choice is ultimately a result 
of a discussion between the surgeon and the patient and ­availability or lack of other 
treatment modalities. The maximum size of prostate that can be treated by TURP is 
not defined in the literature. In UK current practice, a TURP can be performed for 
prostates >100 mL, depending on surgeon experience. The final decision must be 
made by the operating surgeon at the time of surgery.
The aim of this chapter is to discuss the option of performing a TURP in patients 
with a large prostate >100 mL, to review the current evidence behind the equipment 
used, the clinical efficacy and safety of the procedure, and to describe our own 
approach of using TURP in such cases.
For the purposes of this chapter we have assumed that millilitre (mL), cubic 
centimeter (cc) and grams (g) are interchangeable.

9.2  Choice of TURP Over Other Treatments for the Very 
Large Prostate Greater Than 100 cc
Open prostatectomy (OP) was traditionally performed for the management of the 
large prostate causing benign prostatic obstruction. In the advent of minimally inva-
sive surgery, HoLEP is now recommended [1]. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) 
of HoLEP versus OP in >100 g prostates demonstrated that HoLEP was a suitable 
minimally invasive alternative [2]. Comparatively, HoLEP had shorter hospital 
stays, shorter catheterization time and similar postoperative outcomes to OP, but a 
significantly longer operating time [3–5].
When comparing open prostatectomy and TURP, in experienced hands, a sur-
geon may have a personal preference for a TURP from an operative point of view 
but also may favour this option because of a shorter hospital stay and reduced 
costs associated with TURP. Patients will also usually prefer a minimally invasive 
option associated with a shorter recovery period and hospital stay [6, 7]. An 
increase in morbidity and mortality has been shown with a resection weight of 
>60 g following a TURP [8].
A study comparing the post-operative outcomes of bipolar TURP (B-TURP) and 
suprapubic open prostatectomy (SP) on prostates over 100 g in patients >65 years 
showed that mean catheter time and hospital stay was significant less in the B-TURP 
group, however operative time was significantly more (102.8 min versus 73.5 min) 
[7]. Clinical efficacy assessed by IPSS, quality of life (QoL), peak-­flow rate, post-
void residual (PVR), and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) scores at 
12  months showed no statistically significant difference, supporting the use of 
B-TURP for 100 g prostates [7]. In certain cases, the surgeon may be unable to 
complete the procedure in one sitting either due to poor visibility or prolonged 
resection time. Prolonged resection times increases the risk of fluid absorption, sub-
sequent dilutional hyponatraemia and particularly in the case of monopolar TURP 
(M-TURP) using glycine, increases the risk of TUR(P) syndrome which is a uro-
logical emergency, Patients should therefore be counselled about the possibility of a 
two stage procedure should the surgeon encounter such difficulties [9].
One of the major advantages of TURP is that access to the equipment and avail-
ability of training in the technique is greater than some of the other endoscopic 
techniques used to manage the big prostate. From a health-service delivery point of 
view, it is one of the more feasible options available for management the big pros-
tate. Despite this there are some limitations of the technique. In large prostates, a 
RCT demonstrated that HoLEP removed greater volumes of tissue (40 g vs. 24.7 g), 
had shorter catheterisation times and hospital stay in comparison to TURP. The 
operative time however was longer and no significant difference was observed in 
improvement of the maximum flow rate (Qmax) and International Prostate Symptom 
Score (IPSS) [10]. Unlike with TURP, a large case series showed that the outcomes 
of HoLEP were independent of size [11]. An additional benefit of HoLEP to con-
sider in the large prostate, is that it can be performed in patients on anti-coagulation 
or antiplatelet medication [12]. According to the NICE guidelines, HoLEP can be

offered to patients in a centre that specialises in the technique or in one with a men-
torship programme in place [13]. This limits its availability.
Photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) using the GreenLight® system 
can also be used to surgically manage the >100 mL prostate. A small study assess-
ing the efficacy of PVP on large prostates (mean 135 g) showed an improvement in 
IPSS and QoL with a 7% rate of post-operative clot retention [14]. A systematic 
review, irrespective of prostate size, showed that PVP had similar efficacy to TURP 
with reduced rates of blood transfusion, catheterisation time and hospital stay [15]. 
A small study comparing TURP and PVP in large prostates between 70–100 mL 
favoured PVP in terms of a shorter catheterisation time and hospital stay. An 8% 
transfusion rate was seen in the TURP group compared to 0% in the PVP group. In 
terms of efficacy, a significant improvement in IPSS and Qmax, favouring TURP was 
demonstrated, however this study was limited by a short follow-up period of 
6 months [16]. Equal clinical efficacy was demonstrated in a longer follow up study 
of 24 months [17]. PVP can be used safely in patients on anti-coagulation, unlike 
for TURP, and in those with a large prostate >80 cc [18].
In summary, of the techniques discussed, we recommend choosing the surgical 
procedure the surgeon is most comfortable performing when tackling the >100 mL 
prostate. Surgeons should take into consideration the availability of equipment, cost 
of the procedure, length of patient stay, ease of training and patient wishes. For 
patients on anticoagulation that cannot be stopped, PVP or HoLEP can be consid-
ered. In grossly enlarged glands, estimated at >150 cc, we recommend HoLEP or 
open prostatectomy as an alternative. We prefer to use TURP over PVP as we feel 
better haemostatic control with large glands has been observed. In centres where 
HoLEP is not available, or the patient has multiple co-­morbidities where prolonged 
surgical time is a concern, a less invasive TURP or hemi-TURP may prove the best 
option.
For a summary of trials comparing the outcomes of TURP for large prostates 
compared to other treatment modalities please see Table 9.1.

9.3  Evaluating Prostate Size
The prostate size is initially evaluated by digital rectal examination (DRE), however 
as the prostate enlarges, particularly >30 cc, DRE alone can underestimate the true 
size [19]. Prior to planning surgical treatment, the EAU recommends imaging by 
transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) or transabdominal ultrasound to estimate prostate 
size. A study showed that transabdominal ultrasound overestimated the prostate size 
by 55.7% while TRUS slightly underestimated the weight by 4.4% [20]. This has 
also been reflected in the experience of the author where prostate sizes estimated at 
>100 cc on transabdominal ultrasound have been smaller on cystoscopic inspection. 
In such cases where the prostate size has been estimated as very large, a TRUS, or 
if available, a multi parametric MRI, may be a better option to accurately plan for 
surgery.
9.4  Equipment
Using a continuous flow resectoscope, monopolar TURP (M-TURP) relies on elec-
trical current flowing in one direction to cut the tissue with a wire loop. A grounding 
pad must be attached to the patient (the return electrode) and a clear, non-conduct-
ing inert fluid; commonly 1.5% glycine is used. Glycine however is hypo-osmolar 
and can cause dilutional hyponatraemia and TUR syndrome if there is systemic 
absorption of the irrigant, especially seen with capsular perforation. Surgical

resection time is usually limited to 60 min to reduce the risk of such complications. 
This may thus reduce the amount that can be resected therefore limiting the size of 
prostate that can be treated by M-TURP.
Bipolar TURP (B-TURP) uses isotonic saline for irrigation and subsequently is 
associated with a lower risk of TUR syndrome. It is also thought to have better hae-
mostatic abilities as some studies have suggested that a deeper coagulative effect is 
achieved with bipolar energy [21]. This may allow a more prolonged resection time 
and hence augment the ability to resect larger prostates >100 mL.
There are different systems available, all of which rely on the active electrode on 
the cutting loop wire which transmits energy to the sodium ions of the irrigating fluid 
to form a plasma corona vaporisation field which cleaves the tissue to allow resec-
tion [22, 23]. The point at which they differ is the location of the return electrode; In 
the Plasma Kinetic (PK) system (Gyrus ACMI) this is on the loop itself, and there-
fore a lower voltage is required to generate a current. In the TURis system (Olympus), 
the return electrode is on the inner sheath of the resectoscope itself. The diameter of 
the cutting wire loop in B-TURP sets is smaller than that used for M-TURP.
There have been several studies comparing the safety and efficacy of M-TURP 
versus B-TURP. A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing 
B-TURP with M-TURP showed no significant difference in the clinical effective-
ness seen in post-operative IPSS and Qmax [24]. M-TURP had increased adverse 
events of TURP syndrome, none were reported in the B-TURP group. A higher 
frequency of clot retention was also reported in the M-TURP group, a finding 
reflected in previous systematic reviews [24, 25].
In 2012, an international multicentre double-blind randomized controlled trial 
considering the safety and efficacy of  B-TURP versus M-TURP showed no clinical 
advantage of B-TURP.  In terms of adverse events, a decrease in post-­operative 
sodium levels was seen following M-TURP. This may suggest that especially in 
training cases, B-TURP may be safer in inexperienced/training hands as it theoreti-
cally allows an increased time for resection and subsequently would be preferable 
when tackling the 100 mL prostate when is it is difficult to restrict surgical time to 
60 min [26, 27]. A Post Hoc analysis of this study for patients with large prostates, 
showed that for a mean prostate volume of approximately 108 mL, the rates for 
safety and clinical efficacy remained comparable in M-TURP and B-TURP. The 
drop in post-operative sodium seen with M-TURP remained a significant difference 
but was not clinically translated into a significant difference in TUR syndrome [28].
The issue of post-operative urethral strictures remains debatable. Komura et al. 
showed that patients with a large prostate (>70 mL in this study), sustained a signifi-
cantly higher rate of urethral stricture with B-TURP (TURis in this study) compared 
to monopolar TURP, this was not seen in the <70  mL prostate sub-­group. 
Interestingly, the strictures that did occur post M-TURP were at the bladder neck in 
comparison to the anterior urethra seen with B-TURP [29]. Despite concerns of 
urethral stricture, clear conclusion cannot be drawn from this study, however it must 
be acknowledged that unlike the PK system by GYRUS, the TURis is not a true

on the wire loop [29]. It has been postulated that perhaps the anterior urethral stric-
tures may be associated with current leak as it travels through the inner sheath [23, 
29]. These results were in contrast to the study by Mamoulakis et al. which demon-
strated no significant difference between the rates of urethral strictures and bladder 
neck contractures using the AUTOCON® II 400 ESU system (Karl Storz system), 
equipped for both bipolar and monopolar output [26, 27].
9.5  Taking on the 100 mL Prostate
When faced with the resection of a 100 cc prostate, preparation is key. The patient 
should be positioned in the trendelenberg position, level with the edge of the 
table. We prefer the use of B-TURP with normal saline delivered through an in-­line 
fluid warmer to maintain constant temperature of fluid circulating through the resec-
tosope. This maintains a constant core temperature of the patient and optimises 
performance of the B-TURP. The fluid height should be kept as low as possible to 
reduce fluid absorption and preferably no higher than 60 cm above the level of the 
pubic symphysis. This is more important when using M-TURP with hypo-osmolar 
irrigating fluid. Surgeon comfort should be optimised with preferably a foot oper-
ated pneumatic mobile stool and the screen centred over the patient’s head.
Pre-operative imaging with ultrasound or MRI is advised to plan surgery. Prior to 
surgery, start with digital rectal examination to gauge the size of the prostate. A 
diagnostic cystoscopy should be performed to assess urethral calibre, location of the 
verumontanum, a pivotal landmark for the procedure, size and vascularity of the 
prostate, taking care not to cause bleeding before starting the procedure. In the case 
of the very large prostate, the apical lobes may extend below the level of the veru-
montanum and it is important here to identify the distal limit of resection as the 
cystoscope is advanced. On entry into the bladder, look out for a large middle lobe 
or intravesical extension of the prostate which may obscure the vision of the ureteric 
orifices. The bladder walls should also be visualised to rule out other pathology.
A 26Ch resectoscope using a visual obturator should be inserted. Care is taken to 
distend the bladder away from any large intravesical prostatic lobes prior to resec-
tion. Different techniques have been described which mainly differ in the order in 
which the adenomatous tissue is resected. When attempting such large prostates, the 
surgeon should always choose a technique they are familiar with, that is sequential. 
We describe our preferred method for the purposes of this chapter.
Start with the middle lobe working from one side of the lobe to the other in the 
same line until the ring of muscle fibres at the bladder neck is clearly defined—this 
is the proximal limit. Once this is achieved, all resections should be distal to this. 
Resection beyond this may undermine the trigone or result in resection of the ure-
teric orifices. It is imperative in cases of a prominent middle lobe to re-evaluate the 
location of the ureteric orifices intermittently.
We recommend working across one side of the middle lobe to the other, each 
time progressing distally towards the apex until the verumontanum is reached—this 
9  Surgical Treatment: Transurethral Resection of the Prostate

124
is the distal limit. This technique leaves the operator with a smooth floor without 
prominent irregularities of adenomatous tissue (Fig. 9.1) and improves flow through 
the resectoscope thus improving vision.
Once the floor of the prostate has been resected, move on to the left lateral lobe. 
This should be divided into lower half and upper half. Starting at 5 o’clock, moving 
anticlockwise towards the 3 o’clock position and then back down to the starting 
point until the same level as the floor (resected middle lobe) is reached (Fig. 9.2). 
This is repeated, moving distally until the apex is reached. Sometimes, the lateral 
lobes are seen to protrude below the level of the verumontanum and can distort the 
sphincter. Having resected the upper half of the lobe, proceed to the lower half start-
ing at 3 o’clock and resecting round to 6 o’clock resect back to the level of the 
verumontanum.
During each resection, try to achieve canoe-shaped chips as described by Blandy 
[30]. That is, chips as wide as they are deep and their length determined by the 
length travelled by the loop. This can be increased by carefully moving the resecto-
scope back in large prostates ensuring the surgeon is always aware of the location of 
the external urethral sphincter [30]. Note that the chips produced by B-TURP are 
smaller due to vaporisation and a smaller sized loop.
Throughout the procedure, keep track of time, if you find, that it has taken 
over 45 min to resect one lobe, a hemi-resection may be in the best interest of 
the patient. The role of hemi-TURP has been described as resection of one lat-
eral lobe and median lobe, if present. This creates a clear channel and can be 
used as a means of reducing operative time and bleeding in the high risk patient 
[23]. This systematic approach yields better outcomes if the surgeon has to ter-
minate the operation early due to poor vision from increased bleeding, or fluid 
absorption if they are only able to completely resect one lobe. Focus on remov-
ing the bulk of the obstructing tissue and avoid the temptation of random resec-

tion of other parts of the prostate. A single centre, prospective, randomized study 
comparing outcomes of TURP and open surgery for prostate volumes over 
80 mL showed that in 42% of cases, TURP procedure had to be completed in 
two sessions, even in experienced hands secondary to poor vision or prolonged 
resection time [9].
Hemi-resection performed in prostates >120 g achieved patient satisfaction in 
terms of lower urinary tract symptom improvement but was associated with a higher 
UTI and re-admission rate [31]. Resection of <30% of prostatic tissue versus >50% 
still achieved a significant improvement in IPSS and QoL [32]. In the high-risk 
patient troubled by LUTS, who does not want or is not suitable for a long-term 
catheter, a hemi-TURP can be planned to improve IPSS or achieve catheter free 
voiding, in those who a prolonged or second anaesthetic is unfavourable. In cases 
where a hemi-resection was performed due to prolonged surgical time or poor 
vision, a completion TURP should be performed at the surgeons and anaesthetist’s 
discretion.
Once the left lateral lobe is completed, use the same technique for the right lateral 
lobe moving clockwise and anticlockwise migrating distally from the bladder neck 
to the apex to reach the same level of resection. To complete the resection, move the 
scope to just below the level of the verumontanum and look up to the bladder, any 
remaining obstructing tissue should be removed and can be achieved by holding the 
resectoscope stationary at this point to avoid injury to the sphincter (Fig. 9.3).
When the resected prostatic chips fall into the prostatic fossa obscuring view, an 
Ellik evacuator should be used to remove the chips. This interruption to the rhythm

needed when resecting large prostates should be kept to a minimum. The author 
prefers the use of a disposable Ellik with a flap valve, which prevents evacuated tis-
sue from re-entering the bladder.
Meticulous haemostasis in the case of the 100  mL prostate is paramount. 
Communicate with the anaesthetist to ensure the blood pressure (BP) is not sig-
nificantly lower than the pre-operative BP. Reducing the in-flow fluid allows one 
to identify any remaining bleeding vessels. This can be achieved with the loop, 
button or roller-ball depending on surgeon preference and availability.
The procedure should be complete with the insertion of an indwelling 22 Fr 
3-way catheter with 50 mL in the balloon to prevent its migration into the prostatic 
cavity and continuous irrigation with 0.9% saline should be used. All patients should 
have a post-operative blood test to include full blood count and serum electrolytes.
Careful instructions should be given to the recovery nurse and highlighted on the 
operative notes regarding the need for continuous irrigation to be maintained, if 
necessary, overnight. If there are concerns of bleeding, initially catheter traction and 
manual bladder washouts may be necessary.
9.6  Conclusion
The choice of surgical management of the >100 mL prostate ultimately lies with 
surgeon experience and must be made after a careful assessment of the patient’s 
co-morbidities, estimated prostate size and patient concerns and wishes. In 
experienced hands a TURP can be performed safely and effectively. In grossly 
enlarged glands >150 mL, we recommend open prostatectomy or HoLEP.

Surgical Treatment: Robotic Simple 
Prostatectomy
Paulo Afonso de Carvalho and Rafael Ferreira Coelho
10.1  Introduction
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common cause of lower urinary 
tract symptoms (LUTS) and bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) in men. The global 
incidence and prevalence of this pathology has increased in the past two 
decades. In the United States, at least 6.5 million men suffer from BPH and it has 
been estimated that about 1.1 billion men will be affected by 2018 around the 
world [1–4].
Despite recent advances in the endourological management of BPH, the treat-
ment of LUTS caused by large prostatic adenoma (>100 g) remains a challenge. 
Currently, open simple prostatectomy (OSP) remains the standard treatment in this 
particular situation [5–6], providing not only long-term improvement of LUTS, uri-
nary flow, quality of life (QOL), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), but 
also decreasing post-void residual (PVR) bladder volumes and offering lower reop-
eration rates when compared with endoscopic treatments. Surgical techniques com-
monly used are the Freyer [7] (transvesical approach) or Millin procedures [8] 
(transcapsular approach), both with acceptable results. However, OSP has also been 
associated with high rates of urosepsis, reoperation, perioperative transfusion and 
prolonged length of hospital stay [9–11].
In 2002, Mariano et al. [12] described the laparoscopic simple prostatectomy 
(LSP) technique, combining the benefits of OSP with the potential advantages of 
a minimally invasive approach, such as decreased blood loss, shorter hospital 
stay, reduced postoperative pain and a shorter recovery time.
Years later in 2008, Sotelo et al. [13] published the first series of robotic-­assisted 
simple prostatectomy (RASP), describing seven patients undergoing suprapubic 
transperitoneal transvesical approach with reasonable outcomes. Although attrac-
tive, the RASP was classified as an experimental procedure in 2010 by the American 
Urological Association (AUA) [5], considering that there were insufficient data on 
which to base treatment recommendations [5, 14]. Since then, additional series of

RASP have been described in the literature and the procedure is being more com-
monly performed in men suffering from significant LUTS associated with large 
prostates.
10.2  Objective
This chapter aims to describe robotic-assisted simple prostatectomy, the periopera-
tive outcomes and its role in the treatment of BPH.
10.3  Indications
The current indications of RASP are similar to traditional indications of open sim-
ple prostatectomy [15]:
•	 Large prostate (over 100 g);
•	 Acute urinary retention;
•	 Bladder outlet obstruction refractory to medical therapy;
•	 Bladder outlet obstruction with diverticulum;
•	 Recurrent hematuria due to BPH;
•	 Upper tract changes secondary to BOO;
•	 Bladder calculi.
10.4  Surgical Technique
The use of robotic technology for prostate surgery is well established in radical 
prostatectomy. It offers the additional advantages of magnified binocular three-­
dimensional visualization, motion scaling with tremor filtration, improved surgi-
cal ergonomics and miniature wristed articulating instruments with seven 
degrees of freedom. Those benefits can be also extrapolated to RASP.
Below we describe the main steps of transperitoneal RASP; tips and tricks based 
on our personal experience are highlighted.
10.5  Patient Position and Port Placement
After induction of general anesthesia, the patient is placed in lithotomy position at 
a steep Trendelenburg angle with padding of pressure points, identical to a RARP 
procedure. We use a bean bag for adequate patient positioning and fixation to the 
surgical table (Fig. 10.1).

A 18 Fr Foley catheter is inserted into the bladder and 6 ports are placed across 
the lower abdomen: typically a camera port just above the umbilical scar, three 
8-mm arm ports, a 12-mm assistant port in the right flank and a 5 mm for the suction 
in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 10.2).
10.6  Dissection of the Retzius Space and Apical Dissection
The anterior peritoneum is incised; the dissection progress laterally to the level of 
the vas deferens bilaterally. After this, the fat over the prostate and prostate-­vesical 
junction is dissected to expose the bladder neck. The endopelvic fascia is then

opened immediately lateral to the reflection of the puboprostatic ligaments bilater-
ally. The Dorsal Venous Complex (DVC) is ligated using a 12-in monofilament 
polyglytone suture on a CT-1 needle [15, 16]. These last two steps are not essential 
and the surgery may be performed safely without them [17]. However, in our per-
sonal experience DVC ligation appears to decrease bleeding during the anterior 
dissection of the adenoma without compromising functional outcomes.
10.7  Prostate Adenoma Access
The prostate adenoma may be accessed in different ways. We prefer to perform a 
1–2.5 cm transverse incision in the anterior vesicoprostatic junction [17, 18], simi-
lar to the anterior bladder neck dissection performed in a RARP; this approach 
allows easy identification of the plane between the adenoma and the surgical cap-
sule of the prostate without injuring the urethral sphincter and the neurovascular 
bundle (Fig. 10.3). Another approach is the transvesical technique which can be 
performed through a proximal horizontal cystostomy [13, 18]. A vertical cystos-
tomy at the dome of the bladder [19] or a midline incision across the prostatic cap-
sule and bladder neck can also be performed [12]. In all the described situations, a 
good exposure of the adenoma is obtained and there is no evidence that one tech-
nique is superior to the other. The decision on what approach to use is mainly based 
on the surgeon’s personal experience (Fig. 10.4).
10.8  Dissection of Prostate Adenoma
We usually perform a horizontal incision at the level of the anterior bladder neck. 
The plane between the adenoma and the prostatic capsule is then identified and 
incised over the posterior bladder neck; the adenoma is dissected using a

the adenoma

combination of cautery and blunt dissection. This dissection should start posteri-
orly, preventing blood spillage from the anterior dissection into the posterior plane. 
The adenoma is then mobilized from the capsule anteriorly and laterally (Fig. 10.5). 
A 0-Vicryl stay suture can be used for counter traction of the prostate adenoma dur-
ing the dissection. Finally, the prostatic urethra is carefully transected, avoiding 
injury to the urinary sphincter, and the adenoma finally is removed (Fig. 10.6). Two 
2-0 monocryl sutures are placed at 5 and 7 o’clock positions in the vesicoprostatic 
junction for additional hemostasis. Hemostasis is revised and bleeding vessels are 
cauterized or ligated with absorbable sutures.

10.9  Reconstruction: Advancement of the Bladder Neck 
Mucosa/Vesico-urethral Anastomosis
In the classical “trigonization” technique the mucosa of the posterior bladder neck 
is then advanced to the distal urethral mucosa using two figure-of eight 2-0 Vicryl 
sutures or using a continuous 3-0 monocryl suture [20]. The idea is to reapproxi-
mate the mucosa in order to reconstruct the anatomy of the prostatic fossa and pro-
mote hemostasis. We have recently described a modified reconstruction technique 
[16] which includes three surgical steps: plication of the posterior prostatic capsule, 
modified van Velthoven continuous vesico-urethral anastomosis and suture of the 
anterior prostatic capsule to the anterior bladder wall. In this approach, after the 
resection of the adenoma, the posterior capsule is plicated using two 12.5 cm 3-0 
monocryl sutures (on RB 1 needles) tied together. The proximal edge of the capsule 
is approximated to the distal capsule using one arm of the continuous suture. The 
posterior bladder neck is then sutured to the posterior urethra using the other arm of 
the suture. A continuous modified van Velthoven vesico-urethral anastomosis is 
then performed. Two 20-cm 3-0 monocryl sutures of different colours (on RB 1 
needles) are tied together with ten knots to provide a bolster for the anastomosis. 
The posterior part of the vesico-­urethral anastomosis is performed with one arm of 
the suture, in a clockwise direction, from the 5 to 9 o’clock positions. This step is 
followed by completion of the anterior anastomosis with the second arm of the 
suture, in counterclockwise fashion (Fig. 10.7). This modified technique of RASP 
has potential advantages in our experience: reduced blood loss, lower blood transfu-
sion rates, shorter length of hospital stay and no need for postoperative continuous 
bladder irrigation.

10.10  Closure
A 18F two-way Foley catheter is placed into the bladder and the balloon is inflated 
with 20 cc of water. Alternatively, a 3 way Foley catheter can be used and the bal-
loon can be insufflated in the prostatic fossa in order to further promote hemostasis; 
however, with our technique the prostatic fossa is totally plicated and reconstructed 
precluding the need of this maneuver and the use of three way catheters. A Jackson-
Pratt drain is placed into the rectovesical pouch. The midline camera port incision is 
extended and the specimen (Fig. 10.8) is extracted using an endobag. The aponeu-
rosis is closed using a 0-Vicryl suture, and the skin is closed using a 4-0 Monocryl 
subcuticular suture. We do not use routinely continuous bladder irrigation as the 
prostatic fossa is “bypassed” by the anastomosis and the patients do not usually 
present any grade of hematuria in the early postoperative period.

10.11.1  Perioperative Outcomes

Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP) or other endoscopic procedures are also lack-
ing. The main evidence comes from two meta-analyses and multiple small case-
series. Below we present data from these analyses in terms of operative time, 
estimated blood loss and transfusion, length of hospital stay, complications, func-
tional outcomes, duration of catheterization and cost comparison.
10.11.2  Operative Time
In a meta-analysis [21] comparing minimally invasive simple prostatectomy (MISP) 
with OSP, from 27 observational studies published between 2004 and 2014, includ-
ing 119 RASP cases, the mean operative time was 141 min, about 40 min longer 
than OSP. This was probably a consequence of different learning curves between 
both methods [22], as well as potential bias of including the LSP cases. In the larg-
est exclusive RASP series to date, Pokorny [23] obtained a shorter operative time of 
97 min (comparable to OSP) with a median preoperative prostate volume of 129 mL 
(104–180). In our initial series the mean operative time was 90  ±  17.6  min

137
(75-120 min) with a median preoperative prostate volume of 157 mL (90–300) [16], 
reaffirming the importance of being familiar with the robotic technique.
10.12  Estimated Blood Loss and Transfusion
Although OSP is a generally safe procedure, it is often associated with relatively 
high rates of perioperative transfusion. Early RASP case series also reported high 
estimated blood loss (EBL), with a mean of 558 mL (150–1125 mL) in one of the 
early publications [24]. However, results have improved over time and RASP case 
series after 2008 report a mean operative blood loss of 183 mL and low transfusion 
rates ranging from 0 to 5% [25]; these transfusion rates are significantly lower than 
the 17% transfusion rates observed in OSP cases from the recent US Nationwide 
Inpatient Sample (NIS) [26]. This same study, using an adjusted transfusion preva-
lence, revealed a 50% lower transfusion rate for MISP but this difference did not 
quite reach statistical significance (odds ratio 0.47; 95% CI, 0.18–1.26). In another 
recent meta-analysis, Banapour et al. [18], reporting 109 RASP cases from eight 
non-comparative case series, showed a mean operative blood loss of 197 mL with a 
transfusion rate of 0%, adding further supportive data that RASP is associated with 
less blood loss and perioperative transfusion when compared to OSP.
In our series [16], the modified vesico-urethral anastomosis technique in RASP 
assures low EBL and low transfusion rates, with the mean EBL of 208 ± 66 (100–
300) mL with a transfusion rate of 0%, in a reproducible and safe method.
Although RCTs are lacking at this time, data suggests that robotic assisted sur-
gery leads to less bleeding and less perioperative transfusion rates.
10.13  Length of Hospital of Stay
In the NIS series, studying 6027 OSP cases and 182 MISP cases, the median stay 
for MISP was 2 days shorter than for OSP (2 vs. 4 days). However, this was not 
statistically significant (p = 0.19) probably because the analysis was underpowered 
[26]. In consistent RASP series, Pokorny [23] and Autorino [27] respectively 
showed a median length of stay of 4 days (3–5 days) and 2 days (1–4 days). In a 
meta-analysis [21], evaluating some case series, the length of hospital stay was 
significantly shorter in MISP group with 1.6 days, (95% CI: 0.2–2.9, p = 0.02) com-
pared with OSP group with 7.6 days.
As described above, our technique can reduce the length of hospital stay by elim-
inating the need for postoperative bladder irrigation, with a median stay of 1 day, we 
have demonstrated that shorter hospital stay is possible with RASP [16].

10.13.1  Complications
Due to the variability in the methods of reporting and classifying complications, the 
comparison of complication rates between different series and techniques is a dif-
ficult [25], since not all papers comply with all the Martin criteria [28] for the 
description of postoperative complications.
In the systematic review about the issue, Lucca [21] summarizes the current data 
on perioperative complications (n = 114). Overall, there were no significant differ-
ences between OSP and MISP groups (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.4–1.03, p = 0.066), as 
well as for each individual complication: blood transfusion (OR 0.54, 95% CI: 
0.13–2.10, p = 0.386), urinary retention (OR 0.93, 95% CI: 0.39–2.15, p = 0.867), 
urinary tract infection (OR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.07–5.66, p = 0.066) and Re-operation 
(OR 1.82, 95% CI: 0.48–6.20, p = 0.382); note that this analysis is not exclusively 
with RASP cases as it includes also LSP.
Autorino et al. [27], evaluating 1330 MISP cases, report a low postoperative 
complication rate and that most of the complications in 90 days were low grade 
Clavien 1–2 (8.8%), which translates into minimal clinical impact on the regular 
postoperative course. This data supports lower complication rates than those typi-
cally seen with OSP.
In unpublished data [33], comparing HoLEP (45 cases) versus RASP (81 cases) 
similar complication rates with no Clavien >3 grade were found in both groups 
(p = 0.7).
Overall, there is a need for prospective well-designed studies to adequately 
assess for true differences in complication rates between different modalities.
10.14  Duration of Catheterization
Some evidence indicates that there is no difference in catheterization time between 
RASP and OSP [13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 23, 24]. On the other hand, a meta-­analysis 
comparing MISP and OSP noted decreased catheter duration for MISP (weighted 
mean difference −1.3 days, 95% CI: 2.5 to −0.06, p = 0.04) [21]; however, the cri-
teria for removing the catheter were not clearly stated and most likely not uniform 
across the different series and surgical approaches.
When RASP is compared with HoLEP the catheterization time was shorter for 
HoLEP group (2 vs. 4 days; p = 0.0001), however, the two groups were not statisti-
cally similar to each other [33].
In our experience, the modified technique of robotic–assisted simple prostatec-
tomy allows a safe withdrawal of catheter at an average of 4.8 days. A cystogram is 
performed in all patients on postoperative day 4–6. Up to 200 mL contrast medium 
is instilled into the bladder under gravity. In the early publication of our modified 
technique, no leakage was observed [16].
P.A. de Carvalho and R.F. Coelho

139
To the date no substantial difference between catheter durations has been dem-
onstrated in published RASP and OSP studies [25].
10.15  Functional Outcomes
Perioperative and short-term functional data seem similar in RASP and OSP. A ret-
rospective study presented data about 67 RASP cases and demonstrated improve-
ment in functional outcomes (p < 0.001) at a follow-up of 6 months [2–12], with a 
postoperative Qmax of 23 mL/s [16–35], IPSS of 3 points (0–8) and post-void resid-
ual volume of 0 mL (0–36) [23]. A meta-analysis [21] comparing MISP (including 
RASP cases) with OSP reported an average aggregate improvement in the maxi-
mum urinary flow rate (Qmax) of 14.3 mL/s and IPSS improvement of 17.2 points 
for MISP (n = 163 patients), similar to data obtained by OSP (n = 252), but the small 
study size, publications bias and short follow-up are limitations.
Assessing RASP versus HoLEP, both groups showed respectively an improve-
ment of maximum flow rate (+15 vs. +11 mL/s, p = 0.7), a reduction of post-void 
residual (73 vs. 100 mL, p = 0.4) and improvement in IPSS (−20 vs. −18, p = 0.8) 
with median follow-up of 12  months in the RASP group and 5  months in the 
HoLEP group [33].
Using a modified technique of robotic simple prostatectomy, we obtained a sig-
nificant improvement from baseline in IPSS (average preoperative vs. postopera-
tive, 19.8 ± 9.6 vs. 5.5 ± 2.5, p = 0.01), a mean maximum urine flow (average 
preoperative vs. postoperative 7.75 ± 3.3 vs. 19 ± 4.5 mL/s, p = 0.019) at 2 months 
after RASP and all patients were continent (defined as the use of no pads) at 
2 months after RASP [16]. It is important to note that no other available study 
reported the continence rate in its postoperative period.
Overall, these three approaches showed no differences in perioperative compli-
cation rates and consistent improvement in functional outcomes in the short to 
medium term [18, 26, 33], but long-term results are needed.
10.15.1  Learning Curve
Currently no papers evaluating the RASP learning curve have been published. 
Existing data tends to be reported by experienced surgeons. RASP using a modi-
fied technique of vesico-urethral anastomosis certainly requires a certain mas-
tery of robotic technology, however for those surgeons who are accustomed to 
performing RARP, this learning is simple and safe. Therefore, we envisage that for 
surgeons with existing expertise in RARP, few cases in RASP are necessary to 
achieve reproducible and adequate results.

10.15.2  Cost Comparison
Costs related to minimally invasive technologies, especially robotic technology, 
remain a highly debated issue [34]. A formal cost analysis is difficult given the fact 
that hospital costs and reimbursement issues vary significantly between coun-
tries and healthcare systems. Certainly the high upfront and maintenance costs 
of a robot mean that this technology is not easily accessible to many Urological 
centres. However if the robot is already in place for other types of surgery then 
the relative costs are much reduced.
Matei [35] reported a cost of €3840 per RASP versus more than €5000 for OSP 
with the higher costs of OSP being due to higher hospitalization costs. They also 
showed that cost of bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate in the very 
large prostate was similar to that of RASP. TURP in the very large prostate may of 
course require more than one procedure and inpatient stay which may explain 
these findings. However, Sutherland [17] reported that the cost of RASP was 
higher than OSP, adding an average of $2797 to the operating charges. In this 
context future research should adjust the time-horizon for cost-effectiveness 
analyses to account for costs associated with complications, transfusion rates 
and hospital length of stay. Certainly the arrival of cheaper robotic systems is 
eagerly anticipated and may tip the cost-effectiveness ratio in favour of RASP for 
the very large prostate.
10.15.3  Conclusions
RASP appears to be an effective and safe treatment option for men with symptom-
atic BPH and large prostates (>100 g). Although prospective randomized trials 
comparing RASP to other treatment modalities are lacking, existing comparative 
series would suggest that improvements in Qmax and IPSS are similar to those of 
OSP. RASP may also offer lower rates of perioperative transfusion and shorter 
hospital admissions than OSP. Certainly, in institutions with access to the robot 
and where appropriate expertise in robotic pelvic surgery is available, RASP 
should be considered as an important treatment option for the symptomatic large 
prostate.

Chapter 11
Open Simple Prostatectomy
Manmeet Saluja, Jonathan Masters, and Simon Van Rij
11.1  Introduction
A book on the management of the large prostate would not be complete without a 
chapter on the operation that started it all; the open simple prostatectomy. Some 
may say that this is a procedure destined for the history books, yet still today it is 
commonly performed in many countries around the world.
First popularised by Freyer over 100 years ago, this operation developed into the 
gold standard for the surgical treatment of men with symptomatic Benign Prostatic 
Hyperplasia (BPH) [1]. Two key approaches have been described for this procedure: 
the transvesical (Freyer’s) approach or the retropubic (Millin’s) [2] approach. Each 
technique has both advantages and disadvantages which will be discussed in detail. 
Open Prostatectomy remains a recommended surgical technique for men with large 
prostates requiring surgery in all the major urological guidelines [3]. It is often used 
as the benchmark to compare any new technique for surgical outcomes. Therefore, 
surgeons dealing with BPH still need to be aware of the technique and when it may 
be required.
There is marked variation worldwide in the percentage of BPH surgery still 
undertaken via the open technique. In a recent survey [4], 78% of Urologists were 
still performing Open Prostatectomy in their practice. This was independent of 
surgeon age and year of residency completion. However, open prostatectomy 
accounted for only 0.1% of all BPH surgery in USA [5] with a notable decreasing 
trend over the last 10 years [6] (see Fig. 11.1). This is likely due to the diffusion of 
endoscopic techniques; particularly those involving enucleation principles. In 
Europe, the prevalence of open prostatectomy as surgical treatment for BPH is as 
high as 14% in France, 32% in Italy and 40% in Israel [7]. Rates of 15–40% [8] have 
been reported from the developing countries; however this may an under-­
estimate due to less published research from the developing world.
This chapter will present the place of open prostatectomy in the modern day 
urology practice.

11.2  Indications
Open simple prostatectomy has been typically described for benign prostatic hyper-
plasia measuring greater than 80–100 ggm. Other indications include patients with 
large bladder calculi or symptomatic bladder diverticulae, which could be removed 
at the same time as the enucleation. Some patients may not be a candidate for endo-
scopic surgery (for example: if they are at high risk of recurrent urethral strictures 
or their large prostate or body size prohibits the entry of the scope into the bladder). 
Similarly, patients who are unable to be placed in a dorsal lithotomy position may 
benefit from an open approach [12]. Contraindications include patients with known 
prostate cancer, presence of a small gland and previous pelvic surgery or radiation.
11.3  Pre-op Evaluation
Patients need a comprehensive history and examination with assessment of their 
PSA and renal function. TRUS or MRI can be used to establish prostate size [33]. If 
the patient has recurrent UTI, haematuria or deranged renal function, the upper 
tracts need to be evaluated with either a CT or Ultrasound.

11.4  Operative Techniques
The retropubic approach offers direct visualization of the prostate with minimal 
trauma to the bladder [2]. However, it may make excision of a diverticulum, removal 
of calculi or excision of large median lobes difficult. In contrast, the suprapubic 
approach may compromise hemostasis as direct visualization of the prostatic fossa 
is reduced. Perineal prostatectomy is rarely used and lacks robust data but may be 
useful in morbidly obese patients [21].
11.5  Retropubic Prostatectomy
Under a general or a spinal anesthetic, patients are positioned supine in a modern 
Trendelenburg position with ASIS positioned over the kidney rest. A large urethral 
catheter is placed and the balloon is inflated with 30 mL. Either a low midline or a 
Pfannsteil incision is performed and dissection is performed to enter the space of 
Retzius. A Bookwalter® retractor with a middle blade is used. The pre-­prostatic fat 
is swept away in an up and down direction [22] and the superficial branch of DVC 
diathermied.
Pre-emptive hemostasis is a key aspect of the operation and has been described 
in many different methods. One measure is to control the DVC after incising the 
endopelvic fascia in a similar way to a radical prostatectomy [12].
Another approach is to initially place a suture as far laterally on each side of the 
prostate (Fig. 11.2). Transverse tramline sutures with a 5 mm gap between are then 
applied on each side of the incision line on the prostate (Fig. 11.2). Each stitch 
interlocks with the neighbouring suture and the row of sutures finish at the previ-
ously placed lateral sutures. These sutures reduce bleeding as they control the cap-
sular veins and stop the capsule from tearing during enucleation. A transverse

incision is then performed between the tramline sutures (1 cm caudal to the bladder 
neck) to the lateral limits of capsular incision.
The prostate adenoma is then enucleated. The plane between the adenoma and 
the prostatic capsule is opened up by spreading scissors underneath the capsule. A 
finger is then swept side to side and posteriorly. Scissors are used to incise the ante-
rior commissure from bladder neck to the apex [12]. Any adhesions between the 
adenoma and the capsule are then dissected sharply. A pinch action is used to 
remove the adenoma off the urethral mucosa and the bladder neck trigonalised. The 
median lobe is teased out and any bladder stones can be removed at this point with 
finger or sponge holder (Fig. 11.3).
Once complete enucelation is performed, the lateral sutures are used to close the 
incision. If ongoing bleeding, sutures can be placed at the bladder neck at the 5 and 
7 o’clock position [12] ensuring to avoid the ureteric orifi bilaterally. The indwell-
ing urethral catheter is then place on irrigation as soon as the capsule closed. A ret-
ropubic drain is inserted and placed on low suction (Fig. 11.4).

11.6  Suprapubic Prostatectomy
A urethral catheter is placed and the bladder filled with 300 mL normal saline. Once 
exposure is gained into the retropubic space, a transverse cystotomy is performed 
between two stay sutures. Bilateral ureteric orifi are identified. Any calculi are 
removed at this stage. Retractors are placed and a malleable blade is used to retract 
the bladder superiorly and expose the trigone.
Preventive hemostatic measures include controlling the DVC or temporary hypo-
gastric artery ligation [23]. A circular incision is performed through the bladder 
mucosa around the prostate avoiding the trigone. A finger is inserted into the pros-
tatic fossa cracking the anterior commissure. The plane between the prostatic ade-
noma and pseudo-capsule is then developed circumferentially. A pinch action is 
used at the apex to avoid excess traction so as not to avulse the urethra and injure the 
sphincter. Any adhesions can be cut or diathermied, however if there is unusual 
adherence then cancer should be suspected [24].
Hemostasis is achieved by placing a gauze pack into the prostatic fossa. Figure 
of eight sutures are placed at the 5 and 7 o’clock position at the bladder neck. 
Prostatic fossa bleeders can be over sewed specifically if needed. For ongoing 
bleeding, Malament [25] has described placing a 1-0 nylon purse string suture 
around the vesical neck and bring it out through the abdominal skin and tying it 
down firmly. These sutures can be cut day 2–3 post operatively. O’Connor [26] has 
described attaining hemostasis by creating capsular tamponade by the use of capsu-
lar plication on each side of the fossa. Other methods include placing oxidized cel-
lulose (Surgicel©) in the fossa [27]. An IDC is inserted and irrigation initiated once 
the bladder mucosa is sutured. A suprapubic catheter may also be inserted but is 
usually not necessary. The second layer of bladder closure is then performed. 
Hematuria can usually be managed by temporary catheter traction.

11.7  Post-operative Management
Continuous bladder irrigation is titrated post-operatively. If the catheter is placed on 
traction, this needs to be released within 12 h [24]. Patient is ambulated, analgesia 
given and thrombo-prophylaxis addressed cautiously. Drain is removed when drain-
age amount reduces and the catheter can be removed on day 3–5 with or without a 
cystogram prior.
11.8  Outcomes and Complications
Current evidence regarding outcomes from Open Prostatectomy mainly stems from 
historical data or from trials where Open Prostatectomy was used as the control arm 
for the evaluation of newer techniques. Repeatedly, it has been proven to provide a 
maximal and sustainable benefit to patient’s symptoms. Mean flow rates are 
increased by up to 20 mL/s and mean IPPS scores decreased by up to 19 points [38] 
(Table 11.1). Furthermore, most studies fail to report the rates of freedom from

catheterization for those men who were catheter dependent prior to surgery [8]. 
Anecdotally within our own institution, men with extremely large prostates who are 
catheter dependent are often the strongest indicator for open surgery due to the high 
success rate of ending up without a long term catheter.
Open prostatectomy has been classically associated with a transfusion rate of 
3–10% [8, 28] (Table 11.1). However with improved surgical technique and better 
postoperative management, these rates are improved nowadays [29]. Post-­operative 
UTI has been reported in 3–17% of cases [29] and wound infection in 2–4% [30]. 
Reported rates of early and late urinary incontinence were 3.7% and 1.2%, respec-
tively [31]. In the longer term, patients may experience erectile dysfunction in 3–5% 
of cases and nearly all have retrograde ejaculation. Bladder neck contracture can 
present in 2–5% of cases [28, 32]. Ostetitis pubis is rare but usually presents 
4–6  weeks post operatively with pubic pain and low-grade fever and usually 
improves with anti-inflammatory drugs. These low rates of complication are very 
comparable to other surgical techniques.
11.9  Open Prostatectomy Compared to Other Techniques
There are numerous modern trials comparing different surgical techniques with 
Open Prostatectomy. Referenced in this section are the important trials along with 
pertinent outcomes when compared to open prostatectomy.
11.9.1  vs. Monopolar TURP
Compared to TURP, open prostatectomy offers a lower re-treatment rate (1.8–
4.5% vs. 12–15% respectively) [9–12], larger volume of prostate removal and 
avoids the risk of TURP syndrome in large glands. However there is increased 
length of stay, postoperative pain and increased risk of hemorrhage with open 
surgery [8, 11].
11.9.2  vs. Bipolar TURP
Multiple prospective RCT’s have shown Bipolar TURP with Normal Saline irriga-
tion has advantage over monopolar TURP’s as it reduces bleeding and risk of TURP 
syndrome [38]. However, there are limited head to head trials comparing it to open 
prostatectomy for large glands. One randomized trial reported Bipolar TURP to 
have similar functional surgical outcomes and improvement in flow rates and PVR’s 
[36]. However bleeding, lengths of stay and retreatment rates were better in the 
Bipolar group [39].
11  Open Simple Prostatectomy

150
11.9.3  vs. Bipolar Electrosurgical Enucleation
A metanalysis of 4 RCT’s comparing Bipolar enucleation to Open Prostatectomy 
was recently performed [35]. Bipolar enucleation offers a reduced haemoglobin 
decrease (by 1.22 g/dL), shorter catheterisation time (by 3.78 days) and hospital 
stay (by 4.43 days). Qmax, IPSS, QOL, PVR and IIE-5 scores were similar after at 
least a year of follow up [19, 20]. Bipolar enucleation yields a smaller measured 
prostatic resection (by 8gm) but this may be due to effect of vaporisation and is 
unlikely to be clinically significant [35].
11.9.4  vs. HOLEP
There have been three RCT’s published comparing Open Prostatectomy vs. HOLEP 
[15, 16, 34]. A meta-analysis of these showed HOLEP resulted in less blood loss (by 
0.95 g/dL) and a shorter hospital stay (by 5.84 days) but was associated with a lon-
ger operative time (by 32 min) [ 35]. Resection weight, peak flow rates, residual 
volumes, IPSS scores and overall complication rate were similar between both 
groups even after five years of follow up [16]. Despite this a prolonged learning 
curve has limited its uptake around the world [35].
11.9.5  vs. Photoselective Vaporization of the Prostate (PVP)
There is an increasing use of PVP for large size prostate glands; however data com-
paring with Open Prostatectomy are limited. Non randomised studies suggest the 
Greenlight PVP may be safe in patients with prostate sizes >80 g and equally effica-
cious compared to smaller glands [17, 18]. However, one study showed a higher 
conversion rate to a TURP (8.4%) due to bleeding [37]. Further prospective trials 
are therefore needed to establish its role in the management of large prostates.
11.9.6  vs. Laparoscopic and Robotic Surgery
Laparoscopic/Robotic surgery can provide better hemostasis, transfusion rates and 
shorter hospital stay, however is associated with a difficult learning curve, signifi-
cantly increased cost and longer operative time [13, 14].
M. Saluja et al.

151
11.10  Conclusion
Open prostatectomy still has a relevant role in management of BPH, particularly for 
very large prostates over 100 g. It is efficacious and has durable outcomes; however 
its use is limited due to associated morbidity and advent of newer procedures. 
Newer data is required to reflect the current day outcomes especially from develop-
ing countries, where the procedure is still widely used. For selected patients, this 
procedure may remain the most appropriate choice for many years to come.

Robotic Radical Prostatectomy in the

12.1  Introduction
Over the years global life expectancy has increased. With increasing age prostate 
size also increases, leaving more and more men at risk of developing prostate 
cancer in these larger glands. This poses specific problems for cancer treatment, 
not only for external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy where very large 
prostates are often contra-indications, but also for radical surgical treatment. 
These surgical challenges have been described for the open, laparoscopic (LRP) 
and robot-assisted technique (RARP) and their different approaches, such as the 
extraperitoneal or the transperitoneal approach and the anterior or posterior 
approach. Unfortunately, in the literature, studies with longer follow-up that 
evaluate the effect of prostate size on operative time, intraoperative complica-
tions, oncological and functional outcome, tend to include a mix of all these 
techniques and approaches. However, these different surgical approaches might 
have different effects on these outcomes. Furthermore, information about the 
specific challenges faced with very large prostates exceeding 100 g is scarce.
This chapter will focus on the challenges of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical 
prostatectomy in these extremely large prostates and hopes to provide some advice 
on how to overcome them. But first, the possible impact of prostate size on onco-
logical and functional outcome will be discussed.

12.2  Operative Time, Intra-operative Blood Loss and Length 
of Hospital Stay
It is thought that large prostates decrease maneuverability, cause impaired visualisa-
tion of the surgical field and less appreciation of surgical planes. This could increase 
operative time, blood loss and ultimately length of hospital stay [1, 2]. In patients 
undergoing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy it has been shown that operative 
time is significantly longer with increasing gland volumes [3, 4]. This is also true for 
robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Not only do surgeons in their learn-
ing curve require significantly more time to complete a RARP in larger glands, 
especially in prostates >100 g, mostly attributed to bladder neck reconstruction and 
anastomosis, but this has also been shown for experienced surgeons with mean 
operative time reported to be 20 min longer in glands >100 g compared to glands 
<50 g [5, 6, 7–10]. This increase in operative time can also be explained by the 
higher incidence of median lobes in larger glands, which in their own right can 
lengthen operative time and challenge surgical skills and technique [5, 8]. 
Furthermore, there seems to be an increase in intra-operative blood loss in these 
larger glands, ranging from an additional 40–145 mL blood loss, with 1.5% needing 
transfusion, as well as a small increase in other intraoperative complications such as 
bowel injuries (<1%) with a slightly longer hospital stay as a consequence [6, 7–9]. 
On the other hand, some authors report no significant increase in operative time, 
intra-operative blood loss or length of hospital stay in larger prostates, although 
small study sample size might offer an explanation [1, 11].
12.3  Oncological Outcomes (Table 12.1)
Despite the surgical challenge, increased prostate size seems to have a more favour-
able outcome after radical prostatectomy compared to smaller glands. An increase 
in gland size has been reported to correlate with a decreased incidence of high grade 
prostate cancer at prostatectomy and a lower likelihood of upgrading [6, 7, 12–14]. 
Men with larger glands are found to be at a lower risk for progression after robot-
assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, because they were about 6% less likely 
to have extracapsular extension (T3 disease) and 3–19% less likely to have positive 
surgical margins, which was expecially true for men with prostate sizes >100 g [1, 
7, 9, 12, 13].
Again, some authors did not find a significant difference in surgical margins or 
biochemical recurrence related to prostate size [8, 10, 11]. When more positive 
margins were found in larger prostates this seemed to be due to stage T3 disease 
[11].
It seems that increased prostate size does not have an adverse effect, but rather 
seems to be advantageous in terms of oncological outcome.

12.4  Functional Outcomes (Table 12.2)
12.4.1  Incontinence
In theory, many factors can influence continence after radical prostatectomy. First, 
preservation of urethral length is shown to improve continence, therefore resection 
of a larger part of the urethra during radical prostatectomy due to increased prostate 
size could influence continence unfavourably in these patients [15]. The access to 
and intra-operative views of the apex of the prostate are much more difficult in these 
larger glands.
Also, sparing the bladder neck may better preserve the internal sphincter respon-
sible for passive continence, so the need for a bladder neck reconstruction in large 
glands may delay or decrease restoration of continence [15, 16].
Another possible impediment on post-prostatectomy continence in men with 
increased prostate volumes could be the higher incidence of pre-existing LUTS as 
well as the fact that these men tend to be of older age, making them more likely to 
exhibit pre-existent bladder and sphincteric dysfunction [9, 15, 16].
Despite the theoretical disadvantages described, the literature is contradictory in 
the effect of prostate size on regaining continence after radical prostatectomy, 
whether by laparoscopic approach or by RARP. Some authors describe a prolonged 
time to restoration of continence for larger glands with 6-month continence rates of 
63% in prostates >100 g, but with comparable outcomes to smaller prostates after 
1–2 years, while others do not find any significant difference [1 , 7–11, 17].
12.4.2  Erectile Function
One can hypothesise that due to the technical difficulties of operating on a larger 
prostate, nerve-sparing may also be more of a challenge. However, in some cases 
men with larger glands have the neurovascular bundles placed very posteriorly in a 
longitudinal strip making nerve sparing relatively simple once the correct plane is 
found. The effect of gland size on erectile function is not extensively described in 
the literature. However, it is described that men with larger prostates have worse 
baseline sexual function to start with, which could be explained by increasing age 
[9, 10]. Most studies show that there is no significant difference in regaining base-
line erectile function between larger or smaller glands, but recovery in larger pros-
tates does seem to be slower compared to smaller glands, with an 11% lower potency 
rate at 1 year in larger glands which is recovered with greater time [1, 7, 9, 10].

Four studies described postprostatectomy incontinence 
related to prostate size.
One study showed that the 6-month post-RP continence 
rate was significantly lower for men with prostate size 
>75 cm3.
Another reported that patients with prostate size >50 cm3 
had lower rates of continence at 6 and 12 months after RP, 
but continence rates equalized at 24-months follow-up.
However, two other studies revealed that prostate size did 
not predict post-RP continence outcome, with one study 
describing that prostate size did not appear to have any 
effect on functional outcomes.

The 12-month urinary incontinence rates ranged from 4% 
to 31%, with a mean value of 16% using a no pad 
definition. Considering a no pad or safety pad definition, 
the incidence ranged from 8% to 11%, with a mean value 
of 9%. Age, body mass index, comorbidity index, lower 
urinary tract symptoms, and prostate volume were the 
most relevant preoperative predictors of urinary 
incontinence after RARP.
Although different values were used in the literature to 
define a large prostate, a cut-off value between 70 and 
80 cm3 could be correlated with a significant risk of 
urinary incontinence after RARP.

12.5  Other Predictors for a More Challenging RARP
Though increasing prostate size may increase the technical difficulty of a RARP, the 
role that pelvic cavity dimensions play must also be considered. This remains debat-
able according to the literature. Hong et al. described that pelvic bone dimensions 
had no influence on operative time, intra-operative blood loss, surgical margins, 
recovery of continence or erectile function, and concluded that only gland size had 
an effect. However, Mason et al. did show that RARP in men with larger prostates 
and a deep narrow pelvis were more difficult [18, 19]. From our personal experi-
ence, we feel that this combination of a deep narrow pelvis and a very large prostate 
often poses the biggest challenge.
There are different approaches for LRP or RARP, such as the extraperitoneal or 
the transperitoneal approach and the anterior or posterior approach. There is no one 
specific superior technique in the literature and all face the same challenges when 
confronted with large prostates [2, 17]. The transperitoneal approach might provide 
the surgeon with a little more working space than the extra-­peritoneal approach, but 
the experience and skill of the surgeon will inevitably dictate the outcome.
12.6  Tips and Tricks for RARP in Very Large Prostates 
(Table 12.3)
When confronted with a big prostate of more than 100 g it is essential to plan your 
surgery carefully. It is advisable not to attempt huge glands in your first few cases.
•	 Always perform an MRI prior to surgery to get a sense of the anatomy and to 
identify the extremely large prostate.
•	 There is no evidence to support adjusting the surgical approach to prostate size. 
Rather, adhere to the approach that one is most accustomed to in order to achieve 
the best oncological and functional outcome possible.
•	 Plan trocar placement carefully. Try to optimize the distance between the pros-
tate and the insertion site of the trocars as well as the distance between the indi-
vidual trocars, in order to improve maneuverability and working space.
•	 Have good degree of Trendelenberg angulation to improve the pelvic view.
•	 Clear the working field by fully dropping the bladder, releasing sigmoid and 
small bowel adhesions, fully dividing the endopelvic fascia to improve the view 
and surgical exposure.
•	 Try to preserve as much of the bladder neck as possible to improve continence. 
A suture through the middle lobe can be used to pull it up towards the abdominal 
wall in order to improve access to the dorsal part of the bladder neck. If bladder 
neck preservation is not possible, try to reconstruct it. Take care in tumors at the 
base of the prostate.
S. van der Meer et al.

163
•	 Consider a bladder suture on the anterior bladder and clipped through the medial 
assistant port to give additional exposure of the posterior planes.
•	 Try to preserve as much of the urethral length as possible. Cold cutting the 
Santorini complex may provide a better view of the apex, allowing a better dif-
ferentiation between urethral fibers and the prostatic tissue, though this is not 
suitable for apical tumors.
•	 A Rocco stitch may help overcome a large defect after a large-volume prostatec-
tomy by aligning the bladder with the urethra, and can ease tension on the 
anastomosis.
•	 Throw the sutures of the complete dorsal anastomosis before tightening. Then 
carefully pull the sutures to close the dorsal anatomosis, ask the assistant to gen-
tly push the bladder towards the anastomosis and then tighten individual throws 
to secure without tension on the anastomosis.
12.7  Summary
The literature on oncological and functional outcomes after RARP in patients with 
a prostate size exceeding 100 g is relatively scarce. However, with increasing lon-
gevity, the incidence of these extremely large prostates is increasing and it is impor-
tant to understand how to optimise treatment in these patients.
We know that increased prostate size seems to be advantageous in terms of onco-
logical outcome and that RARP is feasible in these extremely large prostates, but 
that it poses some challenges.
Our advice is to always perform an MRI when planning surgery, to get a sense of 
the anatomy and to identify extremely large prostates.

The transperitoneal approach might provide a little more working space than the 
extra-peritoneal approach, but the experience and skill of the surgeon will dictate 
the outcome.
During surgery, take care to properly position the patient, optimize trocar place-
ment and clear your surgical field by fully dropping the bladder, releasing sigmoid 
and small bowel adhesions and fully dividing the endopelvic fascia to improve sur-
gical exposure.
Operative time is described to be slightly longer with large prostates, and blood 
loss can be slightly more, but although this is statistically significant in some stud-
ies, it seems not to be clinically relevant.
For optimal functional outcomes, spare the bladder neck as much as possible or 
take the time to reconstruct it. A suture through the middle lobe can improve access 
to the dorsal part of the bladder neck and consider a bladder suture on the anterior 
bladder to provide additional exposure of the posterior planes. Spare as much of the 
urethral length as oncologically possible by cold cutting the dorsal venous complex 
to allow a better view of the apex of the prostate. Consider a Rocco stich for a ten-
sion-free anastomosis and throw the sutures of the complete dorsal anastomosis 
before tightening.
Men with larger prostates seem to have worse baseline sexual function to start 
with, and recovery after nerve-sparing surgery can be slower, but this seems not to 
be significantly different. In larger glands nerve sparing can sometimes be easier 
than in smaller glands because the neurovascular bundles tend to be placed more 
posteriorly in a longitudinal strip.

13.1  Endoscopic Management of Concomitant Urological 
Pathology in Men with >100 cc Prostate
The enlarged prostate (>100 cc) can cause challenges for the most experienced of 
endourologists. Bleeding from an enlarged gland before the procedure has begun 
can mean abandoning the procedure, diathermy to stop bleeding and inserting a 
three-way catheter with continuous bladder irrigation. The ureteric orifices can be 
very tricky to locate especially if the enlarged gland has middle lobe and/or in blad-
ders with significant trabeculation and diverticula. They can be tucked behind the 
middle lobe making cannulation with a guide wire problematic and lengthening the 
operative time. Issues regarding to the surgery can be anticipated by looking at the 
CT scan pre operatively to assess prostate size.
13.1.1  Rigid and Flexible Ureteroscopy
Most endourologists can usually overcome the challenges of the larger prostate. 
However, on occasion the very enlarged prostate, particularly with a significant 
middle lobe, can distort the bladder anatomy making the ureteric orifices diffi-
cult or almost impossible to locate. We propose a few tips and tricks for ureteros-
copy in the presence of a very large prostate from our personal experience

•	 Don’t make the prostate bleed before you’ve seen the ureteric orifice. A bleeding 
prostate provides additional challenges to the endourologist. This will have to be 
dealt with before proceeding. In rare circumstances a limited resection of the 
obstructing middle or lateral lobes of the prostate and diathermy has to be per-
formed. This is likely to need prior consent if one is aware of the potential issue 
or further consent at a re-operation. On some occasions, if clear vision is 
impaired, the procedure will have to be abandoned and an irrigating catheter 
inserted.
•	 Preload a hydrophilic tipped wire in a ureteric catheter with the cystoscope. The 
first view will be the best view. Have the right wire ready to insert into the ure-
teric orifice once it comes into view. Having to change wires could lose the view 
and can be a struggle to find it again especially if there is then contact bleeding 
on the prostate. As always, ensure the bladder is empty before ureteroscopy once 
the guidewire is successfully placed in the renal pelvis.
•	 Look for the contralateral ureteric orifice. If the ipsilateral ureteric orifice cannot 
be identified, check for the contralateral one. The intra-ureteric bar is often a 
good reference point and you may find the orifice is more lateral than you 
realised. Following the bar laterally should get you to the ureteric orifice on 
either side.
•	 Use an angled hydrophilic guide wire. The “fish-hook” configuration of the dis-
tal ureter in huge prostates can be difficult to cannulate. The “fish-hook” shape 
of the distal ureter can be an indirect sign of prostate obstruction and might 
be caused by a prostate median lobe elevating the trigone. This can displace 
the ureteral orifices, and deform the distal ureter [3].
•	 Safety wires and stronger wires. Safety wires should always be used to reduce 
the risk of loss of the working wire (some would say this is true for all ureteros-
copy). Sometimes we have found it helpful to exchange the wire for a stronger 
wire (e.g. Super Stiff™) to maintain access and help scope passage.
•	 Percutaneous antegrade ureteroscopy. The European Urology Association 
(EAU), suggests percutaneous antegrade removal of ureteral stones is a con-
sideration in selected cases or when the ureter is not amenable to retrograde

manipulation [1]. This is certainly an option where endoscopic access through 
the bladder isn’t possible.
•	
Planning is key. If known pre-operatively that the prostate is potentially large and 
difficult, ensure that the patient is appropriately counselled about the options of 
antregrade approach or prostatic resection if deemed appropriate under the same 
anaesthetic. An alternative is arranging for an antegrade stent insertion prior to 
the surgery. This will help identify the ureteric orifice and also dilate the ureter 
making manipulation within the ureter easier.
•	 Ureteric access sheath. Due to the angle over the prostate to the ureteric orifice 
an access sheath may be required to allow passage of a flexible ureterosope (as it 
buckles away when trying to pass it over the prostate otherwise). The use of the 
ureteric access sheath will facilitate the use of the flexible ­ureteroscope when 
multiple passes are anticipated, thus reducing contact bleeding from the 
prostate.
•	 Post-operative stenting. It is very likely you will want to leave a stent given dif-
ficulty of placing one later if needed. Always consider how long this is required 
for. The stent is likely to make pre-existing lower urinary tract symptoms 
worse. It may also be challenging to remove under local anaesthesia. A tether 
left on the stent will avoid this problem if only needed for a short period of 
time. The use of a Polaris™ Loop Ureteral Stent (Boston Scientific) may reduce 
bladder irritation and contact bleeding.
•	 Post-operative catheter. The patient undergoing an endoscopic procedure with a 
huge 100 cc prostate will be at high risk of post-operative retention and a catheter 
should be placed at the end of the operation. It is useful to know whether a stan-
dard catheter can be passed without the use of a guidewire or introducer in case 
of future need for catheterisation. In the pre-operative consent process the poten-
tial for urinary retention and the need for a bladder outflow procedure should be 
highlighted.
13.1.2  Transurethral Resection of a Bladder Tumour 
(TURBT)
A transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT) is one of the most common 
operations in urology [2]. Problems can be encountered before the resection of the 
bladder tumour has begun in men with a huge prostate. At the start of the operation 
a large prostate can cause prostatic bleeding obscuring the view of the bladder 
tumour. This can limit identification of the primary tumour or other smaller lesions 
including the red patch associated with carcinoma in situ particularly if the tumour 
is hidden behind an obstructing middle lobe. A transurethral resection of the pros-
tate (TURP) may have to be performed before the TURBT (with appropriate con-
sent). If the prostate gland is causing bleeding that is obstructing the view of the 
bladder limiting safe bladder resection it would be appropriate to resect and 
13  Special Conditions: Management of Concomitant Urological Pathology

170
diathermy the prostate. Creation of a channel in the prostate is the most appropriate 
if there is no history of LUTS and the main goal is not improving flow. If there is a 
middle lobe of the prostate gland limiting visualisation of the bladder tumour resec-
tion of the middle lobe is appropriate to gain better views of the tumour. Use of extra 
long resectoscopes can be used if no bleeding is present but the enlarged prostate 
makes it difficult to get the bladder mass to resect. Benign prostatic enlargement 
(BPE) is most commonly encountered in elderly men, with the incidence rising with 
the ageing population [3]. It is not unusual to encounter the clinical scenario of a 
male patient undergoing endoscopic treatment for bladder tumour with a TURBT 
that may also require concurrent TURP. It was previously unclear whether it was 
safe to combine the two procedures since there was a theoretical risk of circulating 
cancer cells that may implant into the raw prostatic fossa and thereby enhance the 
risk of subsequent recurrences in the prostatic fossa [4]. This is now thought to be 
safe to do [5] following a meta-analysis of six eligible clinical trials looking at 483 
patients treated with simultaneous prostate resection and TURBT vs. 500 with 
TURBT alone. Within the follow-up periods there was no difference in tumour 
recurrence between the groups including recurrence in the prostatic fossa. Overall 
the combined analysis actually indicated lower recurrence rates in the simultaneous 
resection group in the overall (combined OR = 0.67; 95% CI 0.52–0.88, P = 0.003). 
A catheter will be required post-operatively and it is useful to decide whether the 
patient can be catheterised normally, especially as the patient may require future 
catheterisation for intravesical mitomycin or BCG. This is also relevant as if the 
prostate bleeds easily with catheterisation then proceeding with the intravesical 
instillation may be contraindicated.
In the presence of multiple bladder tumours starting resections anteriorly/at the 
dome of the bladder may be preferable, leaving tumours which are located in a 
region that requires manipulation of an enlarged prostate lobe until later, to reduce 
contact bleeding. This will ensure the view is adequate for resection around the 
bladder dome.
Anaesthetic considerations in TURBT of tumours in the vicinity of the obturator 
nerve. It is essential that muscle relaxation is given. In a large bladder tumour in 
addition to a large obstructive prostate this may cause increased bleeding and 
increase the difficulty of the procedure by poor visualisation of the bladder.
13.1.3  Cystolitholapaxy (Bladder Stone Removal)
Surgical treatment is usually required when patients have bladder stones [6] as the 
chance of recurrence is high if bladder outflow surgery isn’t performed simultane-
ously. When performing transurethral cystolitholapaxy a good view is critical to 
prevent inadvertent bladder injury with the sharp jaws of the Mauermayer punch. 
The large prostate may well prevent access to the stone over the bladder neck. It is 
likely that most men presenting with bladder stones will need dis-­obstruction with 
either separate or concomitant bladder outflow surgery.
J. Makanjuola and M. Bultitude

171
If planning on preforming a cystolitholapaxy but cannot quite sufficiently get 
hold of the stone due to a large prostate, one strategy would be to preform a TURP 
to gain a channel in the prostate and then finish with cystolitholapaxy. Alternatively 
it might be the case that a TURP and cystolitholapaxy is planned in a man with 
known bladder stones. The TURP should be preformed first to ensure there is less 
risk of bleeding from the enlarged prostate. Poor visualisation during cystolithola-
paxy due to bleeding from the enlarge prostate increasing the chances of intraopera-
tive complication such as iatrogenic bladder injury.
In men who have a large prostate gland, holmium laser cystolitholapaxy can be 
safely combined with holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) [7]. This 
avoids use of the stone punch and may thus reduce the incidence of bladder mucosal 
injury. Sometimes larger burden bladder stones (>2 cm diameter) may require a 
percutaneous or an open procedure. These approaches may not be feasible in certain 
patients who are at increased risk of operative complications and bleeding.
13.1.4  Upper Urinary Tract Procedures
Men requiring a partial nephrectomy, pyeloplasty, percutaneous nephrolithotomy, 
or open stone surgery who have concomitant significant bladder outflow obstruction 
are at risk of complications due to the large prostate causing increased upper tract 
pressures. In the case of laparoscopic procedures a urinary leak at the anastomosis 
or rennorraphy site is possible whilst in PCLN or open kidney surgery a urinary 
fistula to the skin can develop with subqeuent sequelae of infection and delayed 
discharge likely. To avoid this the lower urinary tract should be fully disobstructed 
first, prior to the upper tract procedure.
13.2  Management of Co-morbid, Frail or Elderly Men 
with Prostates >100 cc
13.2.1  Patient Selection
Older people undergoing elective surgery have increased risk of significant post-­
operative problems prolonging hospitalisation, increasing morbidity and mortal-
ity [8]. Ageing is associated with independent risk factors for adverse postoperative 
and post-oncological outcomes [9]. These risk factors can be categorised as (1) 
physiological decline with a consequent reduction in functional reserve, (2) co-
morbidities and (3) geriatric syndromes, such as frailty. To reduce the impact of 
these risk factors on postoperative morbidity and mortality, it is essential that this 
high-risk population undergo individualised assessment, optimisation and medi-
cal management [10]. Recent data indicate that frailty is a more powerful 
13  Special Conditions: Management of Concomitant Urological Pathology

172
predictor of increased perioperative mortality and morbidity than predictions 
based on age or comorbidity alone [11, 12]. Frail surgical patients are less likely 
to be discharged to home [13], more likely to be readmitted to the hospital within 
30  days [14] and more likely to have increased rates of postoperative 
­complications [14].
When considering surgical options for elderly men with big prostates, assess-
ment of prostate volume is even more important than usual for the selection of 
appropriate interventional treatment in men with lower urinary tract symptoms 
(LUTS) [15]. Accurate calculation of prostate volume also predicts symptom pro-
gression, risk of retention, and the risk of complications in older man undergoing 
bladder outflow surgery [15]. Uroflowmetry and International Prostate Symptom 
Score (IPSS) questionnaires [16] should be used in combination to determine 
men who need bladder outflow surgery.
Uroflowmetry might not be easy to obtain in older patients, as voiding on demand 
can be problematic and they commonly void small volumes and may have associ-
ated urgency or urgency incontinence [16]. Preoperative urodynamic tests are 
advised for accurate clinical diagnosis in the older co-morbid man with LUTS when 
there is difficulty in establishing the underlying diagnosis (e.g. elderly men with 
Parkinson’s disease or other neurological diseases) [17]. In men with voiding 
LUTS, benign prostate enlargement (BPE) with ageing causes benign prostatic 
obstruction (BPO) [18]. For such patients, prostate surgery, has a good chance of 
improving LUTS [18]. Voiding LUTS can also be caused by bladder dysfunction 
this is often referred to as ‘the underactive bladder’ [19]. In such men, it is hard to 
justify prostate surgery if BPO is not present, especially in view of potential adverse 
effects associated with surgery, such as blood transfusion requirement, problems of 
sexual function, anaesthetic problems or incontinence [18].
13.2.2  Medical Optimisation
There are emerging new models of care for older surgical patients such as Proactive 
care for Older Patients undergoing Surgery (POPS) [8]. Indicators like the Charlson 
comorbidity index, Frailty Screening [20, 21] or Cardio Pulmonary Exercise Testing 
(CPET) [22] predict postoperative morbidity and mortality. The POPS service is 
designed to predict postoperative morbidity and mortality for patients who may 
have a range of co-morbidities. Preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment 
can identify elderly patients at greater risk for mortality, post-discharge institution-
alisation, adverse in-hospital events, and prolonged length of hospital stay [23]. We 
recommend all frail elderly patients are seen pre-­operatively by care of the elderly 
physicians and anaesthetists as part of the preoperative assessment. Cardiovascular 
status needs to be determined with electrocardiogram (ECG) and often left ventricu-
lar function via echocardiography (echo). Post operative risk assessment of delirium 
by medication review and identifying strategies to minimise the effects. At this time 
J. Makanjuola and M. Bultitude

a haematology consult can ensure a pre and post operative plan can be documented 
regarding anti- coagulation stop and start dates.
This is in addition to assessment, optimisation and management of complex 
older surgical patients is required. At times medications can have a role in pre-
treatment in men with LUTS to improve the surgical outcomes in men with big 
prostates. Pre-treatment with 5 alpha reductase inhibitors has been shown in a 
number of studies to reduce perioperative blood loss related to TURP for BPH 
patients [24]. This effect is probably due to decreased vascularity in the prostate 
rather than a smaller prostate volume or shorter operative time [24].
13.2.3  Choice of Anaesthesia
Once the patient has been pre-assessed and medically optimised there are still intra 
operative challenges that face the anaesthetist in the elderly, frail and co-­morbid 
patients. The choice of anaesthesia can have an impact on morbidity. Elderly patients 
are at risk for postoperative delirium. Drugs used in anaesthesia (such as benzodiaz-
epines and anticholinergic drugs) are known to precipitate or exacerbate postopera-
tive delirium in older patients [25]. Selective spinal anaesthesia is an alternative to 
general anaesthesia and provides appropriate sensory block for TURP in elderly 
patients [26]. The major problem with the spinal technique is risk of hypotension. 
As a result of the spinal induced sympathetic blockade, there is vasodilatation lead-
ing to diminished venous return, which is the main contributory factor for hypoten-
sion [27]. In elderly patients with cardiac disease systemic vascular resistance may 
decrease. This hypotension is usually corrected by either administration of intrave-
nous (i.v.) fluids or vasopressor. Liberal use of i.v. fluid administration is dangerous 
particularly elderly patients with compromised cardiopulmonary function [28]. The 
elderly are more sensitive to anaesthetics, meaning that desired sedative and analge-
sic effects are reached at lower doses compared with younger patients, and the hae-
modynamic depressing side effects of anaesthetics are often more pronounced [28].
13.2.4  Post-operative Management
Post-operatively it has been show by studies that elderly patients have better out-
comes if the care-of-the-elderly physicians are proactively reviewing the patients 
daily and working with the surgical teams [29–31]. Medical and social care within 
a multidisciplinary team (MDT) structure for preoperative optimisation, and post-
operative management by highlighting geriatric issues on the ward, showed 
improved rates for discharge directly home in elective and emergency surgical 
patients [30]. Delirium is an important complication in the elderly because it results 
in functional decline, longer hospitalisation, and institutionalisation [31]. Delirium-
specific complications include falls, pulled lines/tubes, aspiration pneumonia, and 
13  Special Conditions: Management of Concomitant Urological Pathology

174
increased use of bladder catheters [32]. Patients who develop delirium during their 
hospitalisation have a higher 6-month mortality in comparison with patients who do 
not develop delirium [33–37].
13.3  Conclusion
The enlarged prostate (>100 cc) can cause challenges for the most experienced of 
endourologists. Problems arising from the big prostate in common endourological 
procedures can be overcome with correct planning and operative maneuverers. This 
chapter highlights the importance of patient selection, identification of high-risk 
groups and how medical optimisation pre-operatively can improve outcomes in 
elderly men with large prostates undergoing endourological procedures. Patient fac-
tors have been shown to be stronger predictors of mortality than the type of surgery 
undertaken. Multidisciplinary co-ordination with care of the elderly physicians, sur-
geons and anaesthetists pre operatively can optimise the elderly and comorbid man 
with the big prostate.

The Future of Management of Benign 
Prostatic Hyperplasia
Gideon Adam Blecher, Rick Leslie Catterwell, and Ben Challacombe
14.1  Introduction
Before we can predict what the future holds for treatment of benign prostate hyper-
plasia (BPH), we must understand its past. John Hunter described prostatic enlarge-
ment and the development of an obstructing middle lobe with bladder trabeculation 
in the 1786 and even elucidated the relationship between the testes and prostatic 
growth. In 1830, Englishman George Gurthrie described insertion of a blade to 
incise an obstruction. Forty-four years later, Italian Enrico Bottini introduced elec-
trical current, although this instrument was blind until American Maximilian Stern 
performed a transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) in 1926 with a visual resec-
toscope. These steps were clearly a major advancement, enabling minimally inva-
sive treatment. Despite utilisation of glycine at this stage, further improvements in 
technology and technique, anaesthetic and surgical risks have developed. A variety 
of surgical energy sources and approaches have flourished, including holmium laser 
enucleation. Again, these are not complication free.
Emerging medical treatments via the introduction of alpha-blockers was likely 
the next major step in BPH management. Since then, further medical therapies 
have arrived including selective alpha blockers (ABs), five-alpha-reductase inhib-
itors (5ARIs) and phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitor (PDE5Is). More recently the com-
bination of these drugs have become commonplace. Although these medications

improve the situation with regards to symptoms, ‘perfect flow rates’ or unani-
mous International Prostate Symptom Scores of zero, are rarely achieved. Adverse 
effects including postural hypotension, retrograde ejaculation, erectile dysfunc-
tion and reduced libido are just some of the problems patients experience whilst 
on such treatments. The long-term patient/community cost of such medicines is also 
significant.
Prostatic artery embolization (PAE) is an emerging minimally invasive option. It 
is likely to have a role in the niche after medications but prior to surgery, however, 
more long-term data would be desirable.
Not only has BPH specific technology in this area changed, but the future patient 
will not necessarily be the same as today. World-wide life expectancies are increas-
ing [1], as such, BPH patients will be older, frailer and more medically comorbid. 
As the range of various treatment options expand, patients will utilise multiple lines 
of treatment, such that the men who fail first line medical treatments, may have 
larger glands by the time it comes to second, third, fourth or later lines of manage-
ment. Previously a prostate over 100 cc in size was a rarity but with increasing 
numbers of men undergoing long term medical treatments for BPH, prostates over 
250 cc in size are now not uncommon.
So what are we aiming for in terms of the optimal potential treatment? Ideally, in 
the future, we will have access to a magic bullet; a treatment which can manage all 
varieties of prostate size, have minimal risks and minimal adverse effects. It should 
be readily accessible and deliverable to all corners of the world, whilst being effi-
cient and inexpensive. A lack of, or minimal learning curve and long-­term durability 
are similarly desirable. There are clearly many roadblocks to such a treatment, but 
as new technologies arise, these are the qualities we should be demanding.
14.2  Medical Treatments
Utilisation rates for alpha-blockers have increased over the past few decades. From 
1993 until 2010, US rates of alpha-blocker prescriptions for BPH/LUTS rose from 
14 to 40% [2]. Similar patterns have been demonstrated in Italy and Iceland [3, 4]. 
It is predicted that a medical treatment may ultimately fulfill many of the criteria of 
the ideal treatment and there are multiple experimental drugs that will be briefly 
discussed.
Alpha-blockers have varying degrees of alpha-1 receptor selectivity, which alters 
their side effect profile. There may exist other determinants of their adverse effects. 
Although there is a paucity of head to head trials, it is likely that they exhibit similar 
effectiveness [5]. There exist several subtypes of alpha-1 receptor (α1a-AR, α1b-AR, 
α1d-AR): undoubtedly these will be further explored. It is suggested that genetic 
background variation in patients with BPH, will enable more personalized utiliza-
tion of such subtypes, whilst genetic profiling studies may enable an additional 
method of assessing response [6].
G.A. Blecher et al.

179
Not only will newer agents with a more personalized genetic based approach be 
developed, but new combinations of drugs will demonstrate cumulative effects. 
Landmark studies such as MTOPS [7] and ComBAT [8] provide evidence support-
ing guideline recommendations of combination 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor plus 
alpha-blocker for the treatment of moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms 
(LUTS). Combination PDE5I and AB or 5ARI, or antimuscurinics plus AB are 
further examples. It is likely that pharmaceutical research will unveil new combina-
tion treatments, which demonstrate higher efficacy and better tolerability than cur-
rent options. Despite the advantage of such combinations, it should be considered 
that polypharmacy, particularly in a likely older and more comorbid population, 
may have its disadvantages.
14.3  Experimental Medical Treatments
A variety of experimental drugs are noted in the literature, however robust long term 
controlled trial data is not yet available.
NX-1207 is an experimental compound with selective pro-apoptotic properties, 
which is administered via intraprostatic injection. Animal studies show a reduction 
in prostate volume of 40–47% over twelve months. Human trials demonstrate a 
90-day reduction in AUA Symptom Score of 9.7 compared to 4.7 with finasteride 
[9]. Preclinical animal and phase III human trials have not demonstrated any signifi-
cant toxicity or safety concerns.
PRX302 is an inactive modified form of bacterial cytolytic protein, which is also 
directly injected into the adenoma. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is involved in its 
activation [10]. In a phase II trial, 61% of patients at one year demonstrated a 
>3 mL/s improvement in flow rate. No change in flow was noted in the phase I trial. 
Prostate volume was decreased by >20% in 87% of patients at 90 days, and by 27% 
at 1 year [11].
Elocalcitol is a Vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) analogue, which aims to inhibit cell 
reproduction and also induces prostatic cellular apoptosis [12] via interleukin-8 
dependent pathways [13]. A randomized human trial in human BPH patients 
demonstrated a −7.22% difference (95% confidence interval −9.27 to −5.18, 
p < 0.0001) in prostate volume change at 12 weeks compared to placebo, and though 
there were not any significant effect on flow rates [14], the prostate size reduction 
showed good promise for future work.
Exploiting BPHs reliance on androgens, there have been several studies looking 
into the role of gonadotrophin-releasing-hormone antagonists. Teverelix has shown 
a reduction in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) of 6.3 at 16 weeks, as 
well as 11.5% prostate volume. There was improvement in maximum flow rate of 
3.26 mL/s [13]. Other medications under review include cetrorelix, with some stud-
ies showing improvement in IPSS, or improvement in IPSS for larger prostates, 
whilst other studies showed no effect compared with placebo [14, 15]. Adverse 
effects included hot flushes, pain at the injection site, naso-pharyngeal inflammation 
14  The Future of Management of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

180
and headaches [16]. Ozarelix seemed to improve the IPSS and peak urine flow rate, 
without impairing International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) [17]. However, 
impaired libido and erectile dysfunction in short term, as well as a long term risk of 
reduced bone mineral density and potential ischaemic cardiac events, are important 
adverse effects to be borne in mind.
Hormonal agents have been directed at oestrogens as well—benzopyrans are 
potent, selective estrogen receptor b agonists, which induce prostatic cellular 
apoptosis [18]. However, no clinical outcome data is yet available.
There also exist several investigational agents, which aim to manage the second-
ary bladder hyperactivity component of LUTS. These include AF-353, a P2X3/
P2X2/3 antagonist [19], hydroxyfasudil, a Rho-kinase inhibitor [20], WO-03028719, 
an oral ECE inhibitor [21] amongst others.
14.4  Laser Treatments
Several laser types and methods exist currently, aimed at reducing BPH adenoma vol-
ume.  It is likely that new types of lasers, as well as new surgical techniques will be 
developed; with their manufacturers boasting higher efficiency with improved safety. 
Ideally, an affordable, simple and safe procedure will become accessible, with a simple 
and easy learning curve. Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) was first 
described over 20 years ago [22], demonstrating good outflow reduction with less elec-
trolyte disturbance compared with traditional TURP [23]. However, disadvantages 
include a prolonged learning curve [24] for optimal continence results and there remain 
risks of bleeding, sepsis and morcellation related complications such as bladder injury. 
Thulium lasers have also been used effectively as an enucleation technique [25].
Photosensitive vaporization of the prostate (PVP), fails to deliver tissue for his-
tological examination. However, better perioperative outcomes can be obtained 
when compared with traditional monopolar TURP [26]. Will it be possible for a 
vaporisation technique to somehow indicate benign versus malignant prostatic 
pathology? It is perhaps more likely than an enucleation technique will become 
somewhat 
more 
automated 
–decreasing 
the 
surgeon’s 
learning 
curve. 
Furthermore, a laser may have inherent properties which autodefine the correct 
plane for resection. It is probable that morcellation, or extraction devices will 
improve in their safety and efficiency levels as well (Fig. 14.1).
14.5  Ablative Treatments
Aquablation utilising the AquaBeam® (Procept Biorobotics, CA, USA) is a promis-
ing experimental modality which combines a high pressure water jet to dissect BPH 
tissues, with trans-rectal ultrasound guidance and a robotic hand piece (Fig. 14.2). 
This is a heat-free system with real time imaging using a high velocity saline jet. 
G.A. Blecher et al.

181
Initial safety studies have shown equivalent symptom and urodynamic outcomes 
with acceptable adverse effects [27] on moderate prostate sizes up to 85 cc includ-
ing many with significant middle lobes. A surgical map is manually placed to define 
the resection area. The ablation time itself is low (5–12 min) in this early series, 
with overall operative times (40–56 min). It is imaginable that over the next few 
decades, such integration of robotics with intra-operative imaging will achieve the 
aims of safer, more efficient techniques for treating BPH.
The Rezum system (NxThera, Maple Grove, MN, USA) utilizes steam convec-
tive energy to ablate BPH. Again short procedural times are of benefit (2–23 min), 
with improvements in mean IPSS (23–10) and reduction in prostate volume 26% at 
3 months, based on MRI [28]. A subsequent randomized trial confirms improve-
ment of symptoms scores with mild to moderate adverse outcomes [29]. This has 
been performed in an office-based setting [30] and it is predicted that more of such 
technologies will be developed, able to be performed without general anaesthetic or 
hospital in-patient stay.

Histotripsy utilises high intensity focused ultrasound to create non thermal cavi-
tations, resulting in a liquefied emulsion of acellular material [31]. Because the 
destroyed BPH is liquefied, it can drain via the urethra, as described in canine stud-
ies [32]—human trials were abandoned due to poor recruitment.
G.A. Blecher et al.

183
This differs from High-Intensity-Focussed Ultrasound (HiFU) in that the acous-
tic sound waves are converted to thermal energy, causing coagulative necrosis [33]. 
Several platforms are available currently, including Ablatherm® (EDAP TMS, 
Vaulx-en Velin, France) and the Sonoblate® (Sonacare Medical, LLC, Charlotte, 
NC, USA). There is some evidence to suggest improvement in symptoms scores, 
flow rates, albeit with possible adverse events including urinary retention, haematu-
ria, perineal pain, sepsis [34]. However, long term follow up suggests that failure 
rate at 4 years is high at 44% [35].
14.6  Stents
A variety of urethral prostatic stents have been developed, trialled and abandoned 
over time. Although excellent in concept, they have been plagued by practical 
inconveniences including stent migration, storage/irritative symptoms, encrustation 
and need for early removal. The self expanding Urolume Wallstent® (American 
Medical Systems, Minnetonka, MN, USA) showed early promise however long 
term evaluations show only 18% of 62 patients had their stents in-situ after 12 years 
[36]. Furthermore, if removal was required later, resection of the overgrown urethral 
mucosa needs to occur, under general anaesthetic. Temporary stents avoid this—the 
Memotherm® metallic stent (Bard, Covington, KT, USA) has a ‘memory’ such that 
when warm water is flushed around it, the nickel–titanium alloy spiral stent becomes 
floppy and is easily retrieved.
To overcome some of these issues biodegradable materials are now being employed 
as a short-term treatment option. One example is braided polylactic-­co-­glycolic acid, 
which has been used in combination with medical treatment for men with acute uri-
nary retention. At 1 month, 5 of 10 patients were able to void with post void residual 
volumes <150 mL [37]. Combinations of such treatments in the future is likely, par-
ticularly with improvements in various materials and designs of urethral stents.
14.7  Prostatic Urethral Lift
The UroLift® device (Neo Tract Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA) relies on endoscopic 
placement of non-absorbable sutures attached to nitinol anchors, which retract the 
urethra laterally towards the prostatic capsule. Improvement in sexual health out-
comes, specifically continued anterograde ejaculation, is an attractive benefit com-
pared with other treatments for BPH, likely as the bladder neck and ejaculatory 
ducts are not inferred with. The procedure can be performed under local anesthetic 
and repeated if necessary. A meta-analysis concluded that functional and symptom 
outcomes were improved at 12 months, however prostate volume <80 cc was an 
inclusion criteria and a lack of a middle lobe recommended. An additional benefit 
of the Urolift is the relative preservation of ejaculatory function, presumably due to 
14  The Future of Management of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

184
the preservation of native prostatic tissue. The more common early (within 3 months) 
complications included dysuria (25–53%), haematuria (16–75%), pelvic pain (3.7–
19.3%), urgency (7.8–10%), transient incontinence (1.9–16%) as well as urinary 
tract infection (3.2–10%) [38]. Long-term data is pending but it is possible with 
proven results that the current maximum prostate size will be increased to above 
100 cc widening patient access and improving uptake. The ability to perform a sec-
ondary procedure on men who have undergone Urolift is also a potential difficulty 
which requires evaluation (Fig. 14.3).
14.8  Nanorobotics
The future surgical tool will likely become much smaller, nano to be precise. 
Nanorobotics refers to microscopic machines or robots. These devices would enable 
non-invasive treatments to be directed at specific organs, or even at specific cells. A 
cloud-like theory has been suggested [39] whereby, due to the tiny nature of each 
individual nanorobot, many would be required to act in tandem to perform a specific 
function. No clinical application yet exists, but it is certainly a concept for the future 
that could act at a cellular level to reduce BPH. Being non-invasive, surgical com-
plications would be reduced or even eliminated. The cost of such technology, like 
all innovations, would in time likely become cheaper as well.
14.9  Conclusion
Many treatments exist to treat significant BPH, however, they are all imperfect. We 
have and will continue to develop and improve our options—the holy grail being an 
effective, safe and economical treatment. It is highly possible, that resectoscopes, 
lasers, stents and even medications may ultimately be placed upon the shelf of

surgical museums, once a non-invasive, complication free, effective treatment 
arises. Whether this will be the nano-robot, or the magic-­bullet pharma-innovation, 
or perhaps, something else entirely only the future will tell.
