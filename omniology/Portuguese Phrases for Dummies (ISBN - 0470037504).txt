Introduction
T
he world is shrinking. Communication technology
is getting faster and faster, making it easier to
contact people in what used to be exotic, faraway
lands. Air travel has gotten a lot cheaper, too, so visit-
ing these places has never been simpler. Experiencing
um pouco (oong poh-koo; a little) of a new language is
a great way to familiarize yourself with a region of the
world or specific country. Not only does it allow you
to communicate verbally, but knowing new words
opens the door to understanding the specific culture
itself.
If you’re curious about language and want to know
how to ask someone’s name, ask for directions in a
city, or talk about what your interests are, you’ve
come to the right place. I’m not promising fluency
here, but this book provides a great start.
This book tells you about the language spoken in
Brazil. Thanks to Brazil’s huge population — around
170 million or so — Portuguese is the fifth-most-
spoken language in the world. (Flip ahead to Chap-
ter 1 to read about which other countries in the world
speak Portuguese.)
Brazilian Portuguese is specific because the accent
and some basic words are unique to Brazil. And the
country itself is a pretty popular destination these
days, with its earned reputation as a land of fun-
loving, generous people.
A bonus to knowing Brazilian Portuguese is that it can
help you to understand a little French, Spanish, and
Italian, too. They’re all Romance languages, which
means many words among these languages sound
similar.

Brazilian Portuguese is very lyrical. The sounds can
be difficult to make for nonnative speakers, but speak-
ing Portuguese is fun after you get into it. I advise you
to treat yourself while you’re reading the book: Buy
some Brazilian music. You’ll fall in love with the
sounds, and the background music adds great 
ambience.
About This Book
Here’s the good news: This book isn’t a class you
have to drag yourself to. It’s a reference book, so use
it at your leisure. You’re the boss. You may choose to
just leaf through, glancing only at chapters and pages
that grab your attention. Or you can read the whole
thing from start to finish. (From finish to start is okay,
too — no one’s looking.)
The first few chapters may be helpful to read first,
though, because they explain some basic information
about pronunciation and explain words that appear
throughout the book.
Conventions Used in This Book
To make the book easy to read and understand, I’ve
set up a few stylistic rules:
 Web addresses appear in monofont.
 Portuguese terms are set in boldface to make
them stand out.
 Pronunciations and definitions, which are
shown in parentheses, follow the terms the first
time they appear in a section.
 Within the pronunciation, the part of the word
that’s stressed is shown in italics.
 Knowing key words and phrases is important in
the quest to speak a new language. I collect
important words and put them in a special
blackboard-shaped “Words to Know” box.

Introduction

 Verb conjugations (lists that show you the
forms of a verb) are given in tables in this order:
the I form, the you form, the he/she form, the we
form, and the they form. Pronunciations follow
in a second column.
Here’s an example of a conjugation chart for the word
ser (seh; to be). Because the subjects always come in
the same order, you can see that words in this chart
mean I am, you are, he/she is, we are, and they are.
Conjugation
Pronunciation
eu sou
eh-ooh soh
você é
voh-seh eh
ele/ela
eh-lee/eh-la eh
nós somos
nohz soh-mooz
eles/elas são
eh-leez/eh-lahz sah-ooh
Foolish Assumptions
To write this book, I had to imagine who my readers
would be. Yes, you! I think if you’ve picked up this
book, you’re probably a pretty open-minded person
who enjoys learning. That’s excellent. Because the
first step to absorbing new information is wanting to
absorb it.
Here are some other things I’m imagining about you:
 You don’t want to memorize long lists of vocab-
ulary to know Portuguese.
 You want to get your feet wet in Portuguese
while having fun at the same time.
 You’re interested in learning about Brazilian cul-
ture as well as its language.
 You’re not looking for a book to make you fluent
in Portuguese but one that instead gives you
bite-size information that provides a solid base
to understanding the language.

Icons Used in This Book
Drawings and symbols always liven things up a bit,
don’t they? Here are some icons that point you to
important information:
This icon shows you where you can find
some fascinating tidbits that highlight either
a linguistic aspect or give travel tips. Tips
can save you time and frustration.
This handy icon pops up whenever you run
across a bit of information that you really
should remember after you close the book,
whether it’s about the Portuguese language
or Brazil in general.
Languages are full of quirks that may trip you
up if you’re not prepared for them. This icon
points to discussions of these weird gram-
mar rules.
The “Cultural Wisdom” snippets help give
insight into Brazilian culture.
Where to Go from Here
When you have a spare moment, pop open the book.
All you need is a curious mind and the openness to
learn about Brazil. Above all, don’t think of reading
the book as a chore. It’s meant to be relaxing and
enjoyable.
Feel free to complement this book with other activi-
ties that enhance your knowledge of Portuguese, like
entering a Portuguese-language chat room on the
Internet or having Brazilian music on in the back-
ground so you can hear the sounds of the language.
Oh, and boa sorte (boh-ah soh-chee; good luck)!

Chapter 1
Say It How? Speaking
Portuguese
In This Chapter
 Recognizing what English and Portuguese have 
in common
 Spell it out: Saying the alphabet
 Looking at vowels and consonants: Basic
Portuguese sounds
B
elieve it or not, the Portuguese language comes
in different versions. Pronunciation of Brazilian
Portuguese and Portuguese from Portugal, say, is
totally different. Some Brazilian tourists in Portugal
report that they don’t understand a word! I think it’s a
little more of a stretch than the differences between
American and British English, just to give you an idea.
But if a group of people from Texas, South Africa, and
Scotland got together, they’d probably scratch their
heads when trying to understand each other, too!
Written Portuguese, on the other hand, is very stan-
dard, especially when it’s in a newspaper or some
formal publication that doesn’t use slang. A Brazilian
can understand a Portuguese newspaper or read the
works of Portugal’s Nobel Prize–winning author José
Saramago, no problem.

In this book, I focus on Brazilian Portuguese, as
opposed to the Portuguese spoken in Portugal and
countries in Africa — Cape Verde (islands off north-
western Africa), Mozambique (on the coast of south-
east Africa), Guinea-Bissau (in western Africa), Angola
(in southwestern Africa), and São Tomé and Príncipe
(islands off western Africa).
Exploring the Roots 
of Portuguese
The beautiful Portuguese language belongs to a lin-
guistic family known as the Romance languages. Back
when the Roman Empire was around, Rome was in the
center of a wide swath of Europe, northern Africa, 
and parts of Asia. With Rome’s influence came its 
language — Latin.
And the closer a place was to Rome, the more likely it
was to absorb Latin into its language. This was the
case with Portugal — where the Portuguese language
originates — as well as with places like France, Spain,
and even Romania.
So how did Portuguese get all the way to Brazil? 
A Portuguese conquistador named Pedro Álvares
Cabral landed in modern-day Brazil on April 22, 1500,
and is the person credited for having “discovered”
Brazil. Many indigenous people were already living in
the area, of course, many of whom spoke a language
that’s part of a language family today called Tupi-
Guarani (too-pee gwah-dah-nee).
Brazilian Portuguese uses some Tupi-Guarani words.
Mostly the words appear as names of towns in 
Brazil — for example, Ubatuba (ooh-bah-too-bah) is a
pretty beach town in São Paulo state (it’s nicknamed
Uba-Chuva because chuva [shoo-vah] means rain and
it rains there a lot!). Tupi-Guarani words also name
native plants and animals. “Armadillo,” for example, is
tatu (tah-too). After you get used to speaking
Portuguese, telling whether a word is Latin-based or
Tupi-Guarani–based is pretty easy.

Chapter 1: Say It How? Speaking Portuguese
7
Still other words in Brazilian Portuguese are based on
African languages, from the vast influence that African
slaves had on creating modern-day Brazil and its 
culture.
What you may not realize is that the English language
has a lot of Latin influence. Linguists consider English
to be a Germanic language, and it technically is. But
due to the on-and-off French occupations of the
British Isles, some of those French (Latin-based)
words rubbed off on English. Some people say as
much as 40 percent of English is Latin-based.
That’s great news for you. It means many Portuguese
words have the same root as English words. The root
of a word is usually the middle of the word — those
few sounds that really define what the word means.
Some examples of Portuguese words that resemble
English include experimento (eh-speh-dee-men-toh;
experiment), presidente (pdeh-zee-dang-chee; presi-
dent), economia (eh-koh-noh-mee-ah; economy),
decisão (ah deh-see-zah-ooh; decision), computador
(kom-poo-tah-doh; computer), liberdade (lee-beh-dah-
jee; liberty), and banana (bah-nah-nah). And that’s
only to name a few!
Another benefit: O português (ooh poh-too-gehz;
Portuguese), like all Latin languages, uses the English
alphabet. Some funny accent marks appear on some
of the vowels, but they just add to the mystique of
Portuguese. Learning Portuguese isn’t the same as
learning Japanese or Arabic, which use totally differ-
ent alphabets.
Finally, due to the influence the United States has had
on the world recently — in some ways greater than
Rome’s ancient influence — many English words are
used commonly in Portuguese, with no adaptation in
the way they’re written. These words include modern-
technology words like e-mail (ee-may-oh) and also
basic words like shopping (shoh-ping) or show (shoh;
show/performance).

Reciting Your ABCs
Brazilian Portuguese sounds very strange at first. I
myself thought it sounded Russian, back when I didn’t
understand a palavra (pah-lahv-dah; word)! A few of
the sounds are a little hard to imitate, because people
don’t use them in English. But Brazilians often under-
stand you even if you don’t say words perfectly. Many
think a foreign sotaque (soh-tah-kee; accent) is charm-
ing, so don’t worry about it.
But the way the sounds correspond to the written let-
ters is very systematic in Brazilian Portuguese —
more so than in English. After you get used to the way
a letter or combination of letters sounds, you get the
hang of pronunciations pretty quickly. There are few
surprises in a pronúncia (ah pdoh-noon-see-ah; pro-
nunciation) after you get the basics down.
At the beginning of this chapter, did you notice how
the pronunciation is shown in parentheses after the
Portuguese word? That’s how this book shows the
pronunciation of all new words. The italicized part is
where you put the emphasis on the word. In “Words
to Know” lists, the part you emphasize is underlined
rather than italicized.
Are you ready to learn the basics of português? You
can start with the alphabet. Practice spelling out your
name:
 a (ah)
 b (beh)
 c (seh)
 d (deh)
 e (eh)
 f (eh-fee)
 g (zheh)
 h (ah-gah)
 i (ee)

Chapter 1: Say It How? Speaking Portuguese

 j (zhoh-tah)
 k (kah)
 l (eh-lee)
 m (eh-mee)
 n (eh-nee)
 o (awe)
 p (peh)
 q (keh)
 r (eh-hee)
 s (eh-see)
 t (teh)
 u (ooh)
 v (veh)
 w (dah-blee-ooh)
 x (sheez)
 y (eep-see-long)
 z (zeh)
When the book uses the sound zh as part of the pho-
netic transcription (the pronunciation guide in paren-
theses), think of the sound in Hungarian actress
Zsa-Zsa Gabor’s name. That’s the zh sound I’m talking
about.
Conquering Consonants
Getting through this book will be a cinch after you go
through the basic pronunciation guide in this section.
Skipping the guide is okay, too — you can get the gist
by reading aloud the pronunciations of words in other
chapters. But if you want to get a general idea of how
to pronounce words that don’t show up in this book,
this is a great place to begin. I start with the conso-
nants first — you know, all those letters in the alpha-
bet that aren’t vowels.

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies

The most hilarious aspect of Brazilian Portuguese
pronunciation occurs when a word ends in a conso-
nant. In most cases, these are foreign (and mostly
English) words that Brazilians have adopted. They
add an ee sound to the end of the word when there
isn’t one. Here are some examples: club (kloo-bee);
laptop (lahp-ee-top-ee); hip-hop (heep-ee-hoh-pee);
rap (hah-pee); and rock (hoh-kee).
Most consonants in Brazilian Portuguese have the
same sound as in English. In the following sections, 
I go over the exceptions.
The letter C
A c that begins a word sounds usually like a k.
 casa (kah-zah; house)
 café (kah-feh; coffee)
If the c has a hook-shaped mark under it, like 
this — ç — it makes an s sound.
 serviço (seh-vee-soo; service)
 França (fdahn-sah; France)
The most common appearance of what Brazilians call
the c-cedilha (seh seh-deel-yah; ç/cedilla) is at the end
of a word, followed by -ão. It’s the Brazilian equivalent
of the English –tion ending.
 promoção (pdoh-moh-sah-ooh;
sale/discount/sales promotion)
 evolução (eh-voh-loo-sah-ooh; evolution)
The letter D
If the word begins with a d, the sound is usually a
hard d, like in English.
 dançar (dahn-sah; to dance)
 data (dah-tah; date)

Chapter 1: Say It How? Speaking Portuguese
11
The word de (jee), which means of, is an exception.
If the d comes in the middle of a word, before a vowel,
it can have either a hard d sound or a j sound — like
in the English word jelly.
 modelo (moh-deh-loh; model)
 estado (eh-stah-doh; state)
 advogado (ahj-voh-gah-doh; lawyer)
 pedir (peh-jee; to ask for)
 liberdade (lee-beh-dah-jee; freedom)
The letter G
The g in Portuguese usually is a hard g, like in the
English word go.
 gato (gah-toh; cat)
 governo (goh-veh-noh; government)
 segundo (seh-goon-doh; second)
But it takes a zh sound, as in the famous Zsa-Zsa
Gabor, when followed by an e or an i.
 gente (zhang-chee; people)
 biologia (bee-oh-loh-zhee-ah; biology)
The letter H
The Brazilian Portuguese h is one of the most versa-
tile consonants around. If the word begins with an h,
the letter is silent.
 honesto (oh-neh-stoh; honest)
 hora (oh-dah; hour)
If the h follows an l (lh) or an n (nh), the h sounds 
like a y.

 maravilhoso (mah-dah-veel-yoh-zoo; marvellous/

 palhaço (pahl-yah-soh; clown)
 companhia (kohm-pahn-yee-ah; company)
 Espanha (eh-spahn-yah; Spain)
The letter J
The j in Portuguese sounds like the zh in Zsa-Zsa.
 julho (zhool-yoh; July)
 Jorge (zhoh-zhee; George)
 loja (loh-zhah; store)
 joelho (zhoh-el-yoh; knee)
The letter L
The l in Portuguese normally sounds like the l in
English.
 líder (lee-deh; leader)
 gelo (zheh-loo; ice)
But if it comes at the end of a word, the l sounds like
ooh.
 mil (mee-ooh; one thousand)
 Natal (nah-tah-ooh; Christmas)
The letters M and N
The m and n in Portuguese generally sound like m and
n in English.
 mel (meh-ooh; honey)
 medo (meh-doo; fear)
 janela (zhah-neh-lah; window)
 não (nah-ooh; no)

But at the end of a word, an m or n takes on an ng
sound.
 homem (oh-mang; man)
 cem (sang; one hundred)
The letter Q
The q in Portuguese has a k sound.
 quilo (kee-loo; kilo)
 quilômetro (kee-loh-meh-tdoh; kilometer)
The letter R
If the word begins or ends with an r, the r sounds like
an h.
 Roberto (hoh-beh-too; Robert)
 rosa (hoh-zah; pink)
If the r comes in the middle of a word, on the
accented syllable, it sounds like an even stronger h. In
the words porta and carta that follow, push air out of
your mouth as you say the h. It’s a breathy h, not a
guttural sound like you’d hear in Hebrew or German.
 porta (poh-tah; door)
 carta (kah-tah; letter)
If the r comes in the middle of a word, on an unac-
cented syllable, it sounds like a soft d. Feel what your
mouth does when you read the pronunciation for
Brasil. The way you say the d in bdah is how you
should say it in the dah of koh-dah-sah-ooh, too. It’s
not a hard d like in English.
 Brasil (bdah-zeeh-ooh; Brazil)
 coração (koh-dah-sah-ooh; heart)
If a word has two rs (rr), they make an h sound, as in
burro (boo-hoh; dumb).

If the r comes at the end of a word, it’s silent.
 caminhar (kah-ming-yah; to walk)
 gostar (goh-stah; to like)
The letter S
The s is the same as the English s, except it becomes
a z sound at the end of a word.
 olhos (ohl-yooz; eyes)
 dedos (deh-dooz; fingers)
The letter T
The t in Portuguese has a soft t sound in general. In
English, you don’t use the soft t sound very often. Say
ta, ta, ta in a quiet voice, as if you’re marking a
rhythm. That’s the soft t of Portuguese.
 motocicleta (moh-too-see-kleh-tah; motorcycle)
 atuar (ah-too-ah; to act)
 Tailândia (tah-ee-lahn-jee-ah; Thailand)
But t sounds like ch when followed by an e or an i.
 passaporte (pah-sah-poh-chee; passport)
 forte (foh-chee; strong)
 notícia (noh-chee-see-ah; news)
 time (chee-mee; team)
The letter W
The w doesn’t naturally occur in Portuguese, but
when it does, it sounds like a v. The only places you
really see a w is in someone’s name.
 Wanderlei (vahn-deh-lay)
 Wanessa (vah-neh-sah)

The letter X
The x generally has a sh sound in Portuguese.
 axé (ah-sheh; a popular Brazilian type of dance)
 lixo (lee-shoo; garbage)
 taxa (tah-shah; rate)
 bruxa (bdoo-shah; witch)
But it can also have a ks sound, like in English: tóxico
(tohk-see-koh; toxic).
Exercising Your Jowls 
with Vowels
In this section, I go over all five vowels in Portuguese,
including the ones with the weird accents on top of
them.
The letters A and Ã
The a normally has an ah sound.
 amigo (ah-mee-goo; friend)
 ajuda (ah-zhoo-dah; help)
 Tatiana (tah-chee-ah-nah)
If the a has a squiggly mark, or til (chee-ooh; ~/tilde),
on top of it (ã), the letter makes a nasal sound. Instead
of opening your mouth to say a, as in the English word
at, try closing your mouth almost completely while you
make the same sound. Do you hear that? It becomes
more of an uh than an ah. Then try to open your mouth
(making the same sound) without bringing your lips
farther apart. And voilá! You have the ã sound!
The ã is a very common sound in Brazilian Portuguese.
But to be honest, I took more than a year to be able to
say it like a Brazilian. Don’t sweat it — most Brazilians
will probably understand you either way.

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
16
The ã occasionally comes at the end of a word.
 maçã (mah-sah; apple)
 Maracanã (mah-dah-kah-nah; a soccer stadium
in Rio)
However, ã is usually followed by an o (ão). Together,
these letters make an ah-ooh sound. But say it fast,
and you say Ow! like you’ve hurt yourself. Brazilians
say the ã like the English ow, only with the nasal
sound you just practiced.
 não (nah-ooh; no)
 informação (een-foh-mah-sah-ooh; information)
The letters E and Ê
In general, the e sounds like eh, as in egg or ten.
 elefante (eh-leh-fahn-chee; elephant)
 dedo (deh-doo; finger)
If it comes at the end of a word, though, e usually has
an ee sound.
 dificuldade (jee-fee-kool-dah-jee; difficulty)
 boate (boh-ah-chee; nightclub)
If the e has a hat on it (ê), don’t worry. It has the
same eh sound as normal.
 três (tdehz; three)
The letter I
The i has an ee sound, pretty much without 
exception.
 inglês (eeng-glehz; English)
 livro (leev-doh; book)

17
The letters O and Ô
The o by itself has an easy-to-make oh sound.
 ontem (ohn-tang; yesterday)
 onda (ohn-dah; wave)
At the end of a word, though, it usually sounds like
ooh.
 tudo (too-doo; everything/all)
 Gramado (gdah-mah-doo; a city in Rio Grande
do Sul, famous for its film festival)
The o also comes with a hat on it (ô). Don’t fear the
weirdness — it takes an oh sound, like normal.
 ônibus (oh-nee-boos; bus)
The letter U
The u has an ooh sound.
 urso (ooh-soo; bear)
 útil (ooh-chee-ooh; useful)
 ou (oh; or)

Constructing Simple Sentences
A simple sentence construction (in French or in
English) consists of a noun, an adjective, a verb, and,
possibly, an adverb.

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
20
Nouns
As in English, nouns are one of the main parts of
Portuguese speech — the most important pieces of
the puzzle. They’re used to name people, places, and
things, like casa (kah-zah; house), amigo (ah-mee-goo;
friend), Maria (mah-dee-ah; the name of a woman),
caneta (kah-neh-tah; pen), and Brasil (bdah-zee-ooh;
Brazil).
Portuguese nouns come in two types: masculine and
feminine. Masculine nouns usually end in –o, and fem-
inine nouns usually end in –a.
Adjectives
Keeping the gender of the thing you’re talking about
in mind is important because every time you describe
the noun with an adjective — like bonita (boo-nee-
tah; pretty), simpático (seem-pah-chee-koo; nice), or
grande (gdahn-jee; big) — you change the end of the
adjective to match the gender of the noun. Like
nouns, masculine adjectives normally end in –o, and
feminine adjectives end in –a.
In Portuguese, the adjective normally comes
after the noun.
Here’s how the nouns and adjectives get paired off:
 homem lindo (oh-mang leen-doo; good-looking/
handsome man)
 mulher linda (mool-yeh leen-dah; good-looking/
beautiful woman)
 quarto limpo (kwah-too leem-poo; clean room)
 casa suja (kah-zah soo-zhah; dirty house)
 comida gostosa (koh-mee-dah goh-stoh-zah; 
delicious food)
Some adjectives are neutral and stay the same for
both masculine and feminine nouns. These adjectives
often end in –e rather than –o or –a. Adjectives in this

Chapter 2: Grammar on a Diet: Just the Basics
21
group include inteligente (een-teh-lee-zhang-chee;
intelligent) and grande (gdahn-jee; big).
Notice how the word inteligente stays the same,
whether the noun is male or female:
 Ela é muito inteligente. (eh-lah eh moh-ee-toh
een-teh-lee-zhang-chee; She is very intelligent.)
 Ele é muito inteligente. (eh-lee eh moh-ee-toh
een-teh-lee-zhang-chee; He is very intelligent.)
If the noun is plural, just add an s to the end of the
adjective: cachorros pequenos (kah-shoh-hooz peh-
keh-nooz; small dogs).
Articles
Just as with Portuguese nouns and adjectives, 
the gender game is also at play when it comes to 
articles — words like the, a, an, and some.
Now’s the time to ooh and ah over grammar — o
(ooh) means “the” for masculine nouns, and a (ah)
means “the” for feminine nouns:
 o homem lindo (ooh oh-mang leen-doo; the
handsome man)
 a mulher linda (ah mool-yeh leen-dah; the beau-
tiful woman)
 o quarto limpo (ooh kwah-too leem-poo; the
clean room)
 a casa suja (ah kah-zah soo-zhah; the dirty
house)
If a noun is plural, use os (ooz) if the noun’s mascu-
line and as (ahz) if it’s feminine:
 os barcos grandes (ooz bah-kooz gdahn-jeez;
the big boats)
 as flores amarelas (ahz floh-deez ah-mah-deh-
lahz; the yellow flowers)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
22
Brazilians use the word the in front of nouns much
more often than people do in English. When you’d
say, “Books are fun,” they’d say Os livros são diver-
tidos (oohz leev-dooz sah-ooh jee-veh-chee-dooz;
Literally: The books are fun). “Brazil is big” would be
O Brasil é grande (ooh bdah-zee-ooh eh gdahn-jee;
Literally: The Brazil is big).
To say “a,” as in “a hat” or “a table,” say um (oong) for
masculine nouns and uma (ooh-mah) for feminine
nouns:
 um banheiro (oong bahn-yay-doh; a bathroom)
 uma pessoa (ooh-mah peh-soh-ah; a person)
 um livro (oong leev-doh; a book)
 uma mesa (ooh-mah meh-zah; a table)
To say “some,” use uns (oonz) if the noun is mascu-
line or umas (ooh-mahz) if it’s feminine:
 uns sapatos (oonz sah-pah-tooz; some shoes)
 umas garotas (ooh-mahz gah-doh-tahz; some
girls)
 umas praias (ooh-mahz pdah-ee-ahz; some
beaches)
When you make the plural of a word ending
in –m, such as um, the m always changes to
an n: Um homem (oong oh-mang; a man)
becomes uns homens (oonz oh-mangz; 
the men).
Pronouns
You use pronouns to refer to people when you don’t
say their names. Here’s the way Brazilians do it:
 eu (eh-ooh; I)
 você (voh-seh; you)
 ele (eh-lee; he/him)
 ela (eh-lah; she/her)

Chapter 2: Grammar on a Diet: Just the Basics
23
 nós (nohz; we/us)
 eles (eh-leez; they/them — all males or males
and females)
 elas (eh-lahz; they/them — all females)
Brazilians don’t have an equivalent of the
English word it. Because “things” are either
masculine or feminine in Portuguese,
Brazilians refer to the thing or things as
ele/ela/eles/elas when the thing isn’t named.
If you’re talking to a person who’s a lot older
than you (especially the elderly) or to an
important person like a boss or a politician,
instead of using você, use o senhor (ooh
seen-yoh; Literally: the gentleman) or a sen-
hora (ah seen-yoh-dah; Literally: the lady) to
show respect.
Verbs
To really make a sentence come alive, you need verbs.
Along with nouns, verbs make up the main parts of a
sentence. Verbs can link a describing word to what it
describes. The most basic linking-verb words in
Portuguese are é (eh; is) and são (sah-ooh; are). The
following sentences simply use nouns, verbs, and
adjectives in the same order you’d use them in
English:
 A casa é bonita. (ah kah-zah eh boo-nee-tah;
The house is pretty.)
 O amigo é simpático. (ooh ah-mee-goo eh seem-
pah-chee-koo; The friend is nice.)
 As rosas são vermelhas. (ahz hoh-zahz sah-ooh
veh-mel-yahz; The roses are red.)
Of course, all you need to create a sentence is a noun
followed by a verb. When the person, place, or thing
is doing something, a verb signals the action. Action
verbs include estuda (eh-stoo-dah; studies), vai (vah-
ee; goes), and canta (kahn-tah; sings). Here are some
complete sentences:

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
24
 Os amigos falam. (oohz ah-mee-gooz fah-lah-
ooh; The friends talk.)
 O gato dorme. (ooh gah-too doh-mee; The cat
sleeps.)
 A mãe cozinha. (ah mah-ee koh-zing-yah; The
mom cooks.)
When you want to ask a question, you don’t have to
change the order of the words. Just say the same
thing, but raise the pitch of your voice at the end of
the sentence. Use the voice you use to ask questions
in English; it’s that easy.
 A casa é bonita? (ah kah-zah eh boo-nee-tah; Is
the house pretty?)
 As rosas são vermelhas? (ahz hoh-zahz sah-ooh
veh-mel-yahz; Are the roses red?)
The verb can change a bit depending on who’s doing
the action. The next section tells you how to know
which verb form to use.
The Simple Tenses: Present, 
Past, and Future
Tense simply means “time.” So if you want to express
an action or a state of being taking place in the pre-
sent, you use the present tense. If it hasn’t happened
yet, you use the future tense. And if it took place in
the past, you use the past tense.
For each tense, you have to conjugate the verb.
Conjugation is basically a matter of matching a verb to
a subject. Portuguese verbs come in three varieties:
those that end in –ar, –er, and –ir. The –ar ending is
your best friend; with a few exceptions, –ar verbs
tend to be conjugated the same way, all the time. The
–ir and –er verbs can be a little trickier. There are 

Chapter 2: Grammar on a Diet: Just the Basics
25
general rules for their conjugation, but not all verbs
ending in –ir or –er follow the rules.
To conjugate a verb, you snip off the ending (–ar, –er,
–ir) and add a new one, depending on who’s doing the
action. The following sections explain which endings
to use.
In this book, I separate você (you) and
ele/ela (him/her) into different lines even
though they use the same conjugation. I also
don’t show in the conjugation charts the
formal version of you: o senhor/a senhora
(ooh seen-yoh/ah seen-yoh-dah). This form of
address uses the same conjugation as você
and ele/ela. So whenever you want to say
you — whether you’re being formal or not —
you can always use the same form of the
verb.
If the noun is not a person but rather a thing
or place, first check out whether it’s singular
or plural. If it’s singular, use the ele/ela 
conjugation; if it’s plural, use the eles/elas
conjugation.
Sometimes, you don’t have to conjugate the verb at
all. This often happens when you’d use an -ing ending
in English: Dançar é divertido (dahn-sah eh jee-veh-
chee-doo; Dancing is fun). Falar português não é difí-
cil (fah-lah poh-too-gez nah-ooh eh jee-fee-see-ooh;
Speaking Portuguese is not hard).
Present tense
To use a verb that ends in –ar, replace the –ar with
one of the new verb endings: –o, –a, –a, –amos, and
–am; which ending you choose depends on the sub-
ject of the sentence. Table 2-1 shows you how the
endings match up with the pronouns.

Conjugating regular –er and –ir verbs isn’t difficult.
For most –er and –ir verbs, just replace the –er or –ir
with –o, –e, –e, –emos/–imos, or –em. Table 2-2 shows
you which endings to use.

Many –er and –ir verbs have special endings. With
verbs that end in –zer, for example, like fazer (fah-zeh;
to do) and trazer (tdah-zeh; to bring), you remove
–zer to get the stem; the verbs then take the following
endings: –ço, –z, –z, –zemos, and –zem. The last two

Chapter 2: Grammar on a Diet: Just the Basics
27
endings are similar to the –er verb endings (for we
and they), but the first few endings (for I and
you/he/she) are indeed bizarre. Here are some exam-
ples, using the I and you forms:
 Eu faço muitas coisas. (eh-ooh fah-soo moh-ee-
tahz koy-zahz; I do many things.)
 Você traz um presente. (voh-seh tdah-eez oong
pdeh-zang-chee; You bring a present.)
Past tense
Not everything happens in the aqui (ah-kee; here)
and agora (ah-goh-dah; now). To say stuff that hap-
pened in the passado (pah-sah-doh; past), you need
to change the verb conjugation.
For –ar verbs, the past-tense conjugations go like this.
Take off the –ar from the verb, and add on the endings
shown in Table 2-3.

Future tense
To talk about events in the future, all you have to do
is conjugate ir (eeh; to go/to be going), add another
verb, and voilá: You’re going to. . . , He’s going to. . . ,
We’re going to. . . . For example, Nós vamos dançar
(nohz vah-mohz dahn-sah) means “We’re going to
dance.”
First take a look at the present tense (the here and
now) conjugations for ir:

Brazilians like to say who’s going to do some-
thing except when they’re talking about nós
(nohz; we) and eu (eh-ooh; I). They often
leave out the nós or the eu and just start the
sentence with the verb, vamos or vou.

Making Contractions: 
It’s a Cinch!
When you make contractions in English — in words
like can’t and don’t — you use an apostrophe to show
that a letter is missing. Brazilians likewise combine
words so they’re shorter or easier to pronounce, but
Portuguese doesn’t use apostrophes.
Take a look at what happens in Portuguese when you
combine em and o. Em (ang) means “in/on,” and o
(oh) means “the.” But em o (in the) doesn’t exist in
Portuguese, because Brazilians use the contraction
no (noo):
 no banheiro (noo bahn-yay-doh; in the bath-
room)
 no quarto (noo kwah-too; in the room)
 no teto (noo teh-too; on the roof)
The previous examples are for singular, masculine
nouns. Take a look at what happens with feminine and
plural nouns. Instead of no, you now have na (femi-
nine and singular), nos (masculine and plural), and
nas (feminine and plural):
 na mesa (nah meh-zah; on the table)
 na cozinha (nah koh-zing-yah; in the kitchen)
 na rua (nah hoo-ah; on the street)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
34
 nos livros (nooz leev-dooz; in books)
 nas praias (nahz pdah-ee-ahz; on beaches)
Contractions with o also happen with de (deh; of) and
por (poh; through/on/around). For example, when
you want to say “of the,” you combine de and o to
form do/da/dos/das. To say “through/on/around the,”
use pelo/pela/pelos/pelas. (If you’re confused about
which form to use, just remember that o goes with
masculine nouns, a goes with feminine, and s makes
words plural.)
Here are some examples:
 do computador (doo kom-poo-tah-doh; of the
computer)
 das professoras (dahz pdoh-feh-soh-dahz; of the
teachers)
 pelo telefone (peh-loo teh-leh-foh-nee; on the
phone)
 pelas ruas (peh-lahz hooh-ahz; through the
streets)
 dos pais (dooz pah-eez; of the parents)
To Me, to You: Indirect Objects
One of my favorite aspects of Portuguese grammar is
the way they talk about me and you being on the
receiving end. In grammar books, these words are
called indirect objects; the words me and you are in the
sentence, but they’re not the ones doing the action.
Te (teh) means “you,” and me (meh) means “me”
(that one’s easy to remember). Put these indirect
objects right before the verb. Take a look at some
examples:
 Eu te dou dinheiro. (eh-ooh chee doh jing-yay-
doh; I give you money.)
 Me diga o seu nome. (mee jee-gah ooh seh-ooh
noh-mee; Tell me your name.)

Chapter 2: Grammar on a Diet: Just the Basics

In the first sentence, eu is the subject. In the second
sentence, the subject isn’t even stated. You can tell
that the verb diga is in the você/ele/ela form.
Commanding an Audience
Just as in English, you can drop the you at the begin-
ning of a sentence when you’re telling someone to do
something. Brazilians love to use the formula Me plus
a verb:
 Me faz um recibo, por favor? (mee fah-eez oong
heh-see-boo poh fah-voh; Can you write a
receipt for me, please?)
 Me traz uma água, por favor. (mee tdah-eez
ooh-mah ah-gwah, poh fah-voh; Bring me a
water, please.)
 Me explica o que aconteceu. (mee eh-splee-kah
ooh kee ah-kohn-teh-seh-ooh; Explain to me
what happened.)
 Me leva até a rodoviária? (mee leh-vah ah-teh
ah hoh-doh-vee-ah-dee-ah; Can you take me to
the bus station?)
 Me dá o seu passaporte, por favor. (mee dah
ooh seh-ooh pah-sah-poh-chee poh fah-voh; Give
me your passport, please.)
Getting Possessive
If you want to express “It’s mine,” say É meu (eh meh-
ooh) while you’re pointing to something. To say “It’s
yours,” use the phrase É seu (eh seh-ooh). To say “It’s
ours,” use the phrase É nosso (eh noh-soo). If you
want to specify what exactly is yours, change the
meu, seu, or nosso to match the thing that you’re
talking about. Just ask yourself: Is the name of that
thing a masculine or feminine word? Is it singular or
plural? Check out Table 2-13 for the possibilities of
combinations for talking about “my” things, “your”
things, and “our” things.

 o seu cartão de crédito (ooh seh-ooh kah-tah-

 as nossas bagagens (ahz noh-sahz bah-gah-
zhangz; our baggage)
 os nossos planos (ooz noh-sooz plah-nohz; 
our plans)
When you want to talk about “his,” “her,” or “their”
things, you have to switch the word order. Instead of
putting the possessive word in front of the thing (o
meu quarto [ooh meh-ooh kwah-too; my room]), first
say what the thing is, and then say de (deh; of) plus
the owner. The de gets attached to the ele, ela, or
eles/elas (the “him,” “her,” or “them”), and the e
between the words is dropped.

Chapter 2: Grammar on a Diet: Just the Basics
37
 dele (deh-lee; his. Literally: of him)
 dela (deh-lah; her. Literally: of her)
 deles (deh-leez; their — for all males or males
and females. Literally: of them)
 delas (deh-lahz; their — for all females. Literally:
of them)
Technically, when you say o quarto dele (ooh kwah-
toh deh-lee; his room), you’re saying “the room of him.”
Name the thing first, and then say whose it is.
 o dinheiro dela (ooh jing-yay-doh deh-lah; her
money)
 a comida deles (ah koh-mee-dah deh-leez; their
food — for all males or males and females)
 as roupas delas (ahz hoh-pahz deh-lahz; their
clothes — for all females)
Using a specific name is the easiest situation. Just say
the name of the thing plus de and the specific name.
Also note that people’s names always take an o or an
a before them (depending on whether the person is
male or female); when combined with de, these words
become do or da. When you want to say “Lucia’s
house,” you can say a casa da Lucia (ah kah-zah dah
loo-see-ah), which literally means “the house of
Lucia.” Check out some other examples:
 o carro do Mario (ooh kah-hoh doo mah-dee-
oh; Mario’s car)
 o cabelo da Ana Cristina (ooh kah-beh-loh dah
ah-nah kdee-schee-nah; Ana Cristina’s hair)
 as empresas da Petrobrás (ahz ehm-pdeh-zahz
dah peh-tdoh-bdah-eez; Petrobras’s companies —
Petrobrás is Brazil’s largest oil company)
 as praias do Pará (ahz pdah-ee-ahz doo pah-
dah; Para state’s beaches)

In This Chapter

ood news! Numerals are the same in Portuguese
as in English, so inside a Brazilian store, you can
understand the price of something — even if you
don’t remember a word of Portuguese. This may
sound obvious, but the point is that a little familiarity
in new surroundings can give you the reassurance
and courage to have a little chat with the store clerk.
This chapter also shows you how to tell time and nav-
igate the calendar.
Numbers to Know: When
Everything Counts
Whether you’re telling the time, asking about street
numbers, or discussing prices, you need to know how
to say numbers. Here are numbers one through ten:
 um (oong; one)
 dois (doh-eez; two)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
40
 três (tdehz; three)
 quatro (kwah-tdoo; four)
 cinco (sing-koo; five)
 seis (say-eez; six)
 sete (seh-chee; seven)
 oito (oh-ee-toh; eight)
 nove (noh-vee; nine)
 dez (dez; ten)
Now check out how to say 11 through 19:
 onze (ohn-zee; 11)
 doze (doh-zee; 12)
 treze (tdeh-zee; 13)
 quatorze (kah-toh-zee; 14)
 quinze (keen-zee; 15)
 dezeseis (dez-eh-say-eez; 16)
 dezesete (dez-eh-seh-chee; 17)
 dezoito (dez-oh-ee-toh; 18)
 dezenove (dez-eh-noh-vee; 19)
And these are numbers 20 to 100, counting by tens:
 vinte (ving-chee; 20)
 trinta (tdeen-tah; 30)
 quarenta (kwah-dang-tah; 40)
 cinqüenta (sing-kwen-tah; 50)
 sessenta (seh-sen-tah; 60)
 setenta (seh-ten-tah; 70)
 oitenta (oh-ee-ten-tah; 80)
 noventa (noh-ven-tah; 90)
 cem (sang; 100)

Chapter 3: Numerical Gumbo: Counting of All Kinds 
41
To say a double-digit number that doesn’t end in zero,
you just put the word e (ee; and) in between your
tens and ones digits. If you want to say 34, for exam-
ple, say trinta e quatro (tdeen-tah ee kwah-tdoh;
Literally: 30 and 4).
To say 101 through 199, use cento e (sehn-too ee) plus
the rest of number: Cento e trinta e quatro (sehn-too
ee tdeen-tah ee kwah-tdoh) is 134, and cento e oitenta
e sete (sehn-too ee oh-ee-ten-tah ee seh-chee) is 187.
For 201 through 999, replace the cento with the fol-
lowing hundreds terms:
 duzentos (doo-zen-tooz; 200)
 trezentos (tdeh-zen-tooz; 300)
 quatrocentos (kwah-tdoo-sen-tooz; 400)
 quinhentos (keen-yen-tooz; 500)
 seiscentos (say-sen-tooz; 600)
 setecentos (seh-chee-sen-tooz; 700)
 oitocentos (oh-ee-too-sen-tooz; 800)
 novecentos (noh-vee-sen-tooz; 900)
One thousand is mil (mee-ooh), and one million is um
milhão (oong meel-yah-ooh). For numbers in those
ranges, just add an e and then the rest of the number.
The Big Countdown: 
Ordinal Numbers
When people give directions, they often use ordinal
numbers. Someone may tell you to take the primeira
(pdee-may-dah; first) left and then the terceira (teh-
say-dah; third) right. Or someone may say to take the
elevator to the sétimo (seh-chee-moh; seventh) floor.
Here’s a handy list for all that:
 primeiro (pdee-may-doh; first)
 segundo (seh-goon-doh; second)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
42
 terceiro (teh-say-doh; third)
 quarto (kwah-toh; fourth)
 quinto (keen-toh; fifth)
 sexto (sehs-toh; sixth)
 sétimo (seh-chee-moh; seventh)
 oitavo (oh-ee-tah-voh; eighth)
 nono (noh-noh; ninth)
Try to remember to change the ending to –a instead
of –o if the following word is feminine.
Here are some example sentences using the ordinal
numbers:
 Pega a primeira direita. (peh-gah ah pdee-may-
dah jee-day-tah; Take the first right.)
 Moro no quarto andar. (moh-doo noh kwah-toh
ahn-dah; I live on the fourth floor.)
 É a segunda porta. (eh ah seh-goon-dah poh-tah;
It’s the second door.)
Telling Time
Saying the time of dia (jee-ah; day) is easy in
Portuguese. With a little practice, you can have it
memorized in no time. Just say São . . . (the number
of hours) e . . . (the number of minutes) horas: São
cinco e quinze (sah-ooh sing-koh ee keen-zee; It’s
5:15).
Most of the time, people don’t even say the word
horas. Using the word horas is similar to saying
o’clock, which is optional: São sete (sah-ooh ahz seh-
chee; It’s seven) and São sete horas (sah-ooh ahz seh-
chee oh-dahz; It’s seven o’clock) both mean the same
thing. If it’s half past the hour, say e meia (ee may-ah;
and a half). Here are some examples:

Chapter 3: Numerical Gumbo: Counting of All Kinds 
43
 São duas horas. (sah-ooh doo-ahz oh-dahz; It’s
two o’clock.)
 São duas e meia. (sah-ooh doo-ahz ee may-ah;
It’s 2:30.)
 São quinze para as três. (sah-ooh keen-zee pah-
dah ahz tdehz; It’s 15 to 3:00 [2:45].)
 São onze e quinze. (sah-ooh ohn-zee ee keen-
zee; It’s 11:15.)
 São oito e dez. (sah-ooh oh-ee-toh ee dez; It’s
8:10.)
In English, people sometimes give the time as
“quarter after” or “five till” a certain hour.
Brazilians sometimes use similar phrases
and constructions. For times 15 minutes
after the hour, you have the option of saying
e quinze (ee keen-zee; and 15) or e um
quarto (ee oong kwah-too; and a quarter)
when you give the minutes. For times ending
in 45, you can say either quinze para (keen-
zee pah-dah; 15 to) before you give the hour
or e quarenta e cinco (ee kwah-den-tah ee
sing-koh; and 45) after you give the hour.
Midnight is meia-noite (may-ah noh-ee-chee), and
noon is meio-dia (may-oh jee-ah; midday). In these
cases — and when you say “it’s one o’clock” — use É
instead of São, because the number one and the
words midnight and noon are singular:
 É meia-noite. (eh may-ah noh-ee-chee; It’s mid-
night.)
 É meio-dia. (eh may-oh jee-ah; It’s noon.)
 É uma. (eh ooh-mah; It’s one.)
 É uma e vinte. (eh ooh-mah ee veen-chee; It’s
1:20.)
Brazilians often use military time, especially
in formal situations, like checking transporta-
tion schedules.

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies

Here are some other words and phrases that indicate
time:
 hoje à noite (oh-zhee ah noh-ee-chee; tonight)
 noite (noh-ee-chee; night)
 cedo (seh-doo; early)
 tarde (tah-jee; late)
If you’re meeting up with someone, you may want to
ask A que horas? (ah kee oh-dahz; At what time?)
you’ll be meeting. If you’re responding to the ques-
tion, you can leave out the são and just give the time:
Às nove e meia (noh-vee ee may-ah; at 9:30).
When you’ve got talking about time down, here are
some helpful phrases about timeliness;
 O ônibus está atrasado? (eh-stah ah-tdah-zah-
doo ooh oh-nee-boos; Is the bus late?)
 É sempre melhor chegar cedo. (eh sem-pdee
mel-yoh sheh-gah seh-doo; It’s always better to
arrive early.)
 Acha que vamos poder chegar a tempo? (ah-
shah kee vah-mooz poh-deh sheh-gah ah tem-poh;
Do you think we’ll be able to arrive on time?)
 O metrô de São Paulo é muito pontual. (ooh
meh-tdoh jee sah-ooh pah-ooh-loh eh moh-ee-toh
pon-too-ah-ooh; The São Paulo subway system
is very punctual.)
 O atraso vai ser de uma hora. (ooh ah-tdah-zoo
vah-ee seh jee ooh-mah oh-dah; The delay will
be an hour.)
 Quase não chegamos a tempo. (kwah-zee nah-
ooh sheh-gah-mohz ah tem-poh; We almost
didn’t arrive in time.)
Monday, Tuesday: Weekdays
Dias da semana (jee-ahz dah seh-mah-nah; days of
the week) in Portuguese seem bizarre at first.

Chapter 3: Numerical Gumbo: Counting of All Kinds 
45
According to legend, the Portuguese were obsessed
with feiras (fay-dahz; outdoor food markets), and
they sold different goods on each day of the semana.
Feiras were so important to the Portuguese that they
talked about the weekdays in reference to which feira
was happening that day. Here are the days of the
week:
 domingo (doh-ming-goo; Sunday)
 segunda-feira (seh-goon-dah-fay-dah; Monday)
 terça-feira (teh-sah-fay-dah; Tuesday)
 quarta-feira (kwah-tah-fay-dah; Wednesday)
 quinta-feira (keen-tah-fay-dah; Thursday)
 sexta-feira (seh-stah-fay-dah; Friday)
 sábado (sah-bah-doh; Saturday)
Brazilians also sometimes refer to the weekdays by
their name without the word feira. Segunda is techni-
cally segunda-feira (Literally: second market —
Monday is the second day of the week and a market
or business day). But people often just say segunda
or quarta or sexta — instead of segunda-feira,
quarta-feira, and sexta-feira.
To say on a certain day of week, like on Sunday, say
no (noh) or na (nah) before the day of the week — no
if the day is a masculine word, na if it’s feminine:
 no domingo (noh doh-meeng-goh; on Sunday)
 na segunda (nah seh-goon-dah; on Monday)
 na terça (nah teh-sah; on Tuesday)
 na quarta (nah kwah-tah; on Wednesday)
 na quinta (nah keen-tah; on Thursday)
 na sexta (nah seh-stah; on Friday)
 no sábado (noh sah-bah-doh; on Saturday)
Here are some examples:
 Tem um show na quarta. (tang oong shoh nah
kwah-tah; There’s a show on Wednesday.)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies

 Na segunda, eu preciso trabalhar. (nah seh-
goon-dah eh-ooh pdeh-see-zoo tdah-bal-yah; On
Monday, I need to work.)
 Vamos sair na sexta? (vah-mooz sah-eeh nah
seh-stah; Should we go out on Friday?)
The following phrases are related to days:
 hoje (oh-zhee; today)
 amanhã (ah-mahn-yah; tomorrow)
 na semana que vem (nah seh-mah-nah kee
vang; next week)
 no fim de semana (noh feeng jee seh-mah-nah;
on the weekend)
 no mês que vem (noh mehz kee vang; next
month)
Tracking the Calendar: 
Months and Dates
Whether you’re planning dinner next week or a big
appointment for work, you need to know how to talk
your way around a calendar.
Naming the months
Note that, in Portuguese, the first letter of the name of
each month isn’t capitalized like it is in English:
 janeiro (zhah-nay-doh; January)
 fevereiro (feh-veh-day-doh; February)
 março (mah-soo; March)
 abril (ah-bdee-ooh; April)
 maio (my-oh; May)
 junho (zhoon-yoh; June)
 julho (zhool-yoh; July)

Chapter 3: Numerical Gumbo: Counting of All Kinds 
47
 agosto (ah-goh-stoh; August)
 setembro (seh-tehm-bdoh; September)
 outubro (oh-too-bdoh; October)
 novembro (noh-vem-bdoh; November)
 dezembro (deh-zem-bdoh; December)
To say in a certain month, use em (ang) plus the name
of the month. Here are some example sentences:
 Vou para o Brasil em maio. (voh pah-dah ooh
bdah-zee-ooh ang my-oh; I’m going to Brazil in
May.)
 Ela retornou do Canadá em novembro. (eh-lah
heh-toh-noh doo kah-nah-dah ang noh-vehm-
bdoh; She returned from Canada in November.)
Picking a date
You may want to talk about days of the month and
time of day for your odyssey.
To say on a certain day, use no (noh) plus
the date. Use no dia . . . (date) de . . .
(month) (noo jee-ah . . . jee . . .) to say on
such-and-such day of such-and-such month. For
example, no dia quinze de setembro (noo
jee-ah keen-zee jee seh-tehm-bdoh) is
September 15.
Check out some phrases that give you dates and
times:
 no dia três de outubro, às oito e vinte e cinco
da manhã (noo jee-ah tdehz jee oh-too-bdoh ahz
oh-ee-toh ee veen-chee ee sing-koh dah mahn-
yah; on October 3, at 8:25 a.m.)
 no dia vinte e dois de agosto, às vinte horas
(noo jee-ah veen-chee ee doh-eez jee ah-goh-stoh
ahz veen-chee oh-dahz; on August 22, at 8
o’clock p.m. [2000 hours])

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies

 no dia dezessete de dezembro, às vinte e uma
horas e cinquenta minutos (noo jee-ah dehz-eh-
seh-chee jee deh-zem-bdoh ahz veen-chee ee
ooh-mah oh-dahz ee sing-kwen-tah mee-noo-

 no dia quatorze de maio, às dez e quinze da
manhã (noo jee-ah kah-toh-zee jee my-oh ahz
dez ee keen-zee dah mahn-yah; on May 14, at
10:15 a.m.)
If you’re referring to something in the past or far out in
the future, your date requires an ano (ah-noh; year).
Most years people refer to start with either 19 or 20. If
the year is in the 1900s, say mil novecentos e . . .
(mee-ooh noh-vee sehn-tohz ee; Nineteen . . .) If the
year is in the current século (seh-koo-loh; century),
say dois mil e . . . (doh-eez mee-ooh ee; Two-
thousand . . .). Here are some examples of different
years:
 mil novecentos e cinquenta e dois (mee-ooh
noh-vee-sehn-tohz ee sing-kwehn-tah ee doh-eez;
1952)
 mil novecentos e oitenta e três (mee-ooh noh-
vee-sehn-tohz ee oh-ee-tehn-tah ee tdehz; 1983)
 mil novecentos e setenta e quatro (mee-ooh
noh-vee-sehn-tohz ee seh-tehn-tah ee kwah-tdoh;
1974)
 dois mil e um (doh-eez mee-ooh ee oong; 2001)
 dois mil e seis (doh-eez mee-ooh ee say-eez;
2006)
Money, Money, Money
O dinheiro (o jing-yay-doh; money) is the universal
language. Or is that o amor (o ah-moh; love)?

Chapter 3: Numerical Gumbo: Counting of All Kinds 
49
Currency and prices
The moeda (moh-eh-dah; currency) in Brazil is called
o real (oh heh-ah-ooh), and the plural is reais (heh-
eyez). The taxa de câmbio (tah-shah jee kahm-bee-oh;
exchange rate) is about um real (oong heh-ah-ooh;
one real) to $0.45 (2.22 reais per US$1), and things are
generally more than duas vezes (doo-ahz veh-zeez;
two times) mais barato (mah-eez bah-dah-toh;
cheaper) than they are in the United States. Rejoice!
Brazilian slang for dinheiro is grana (gdah-
nah). Estou sem grana (eh-stoh sang gdah-
nah) means “I don’t have any dough”
(Literally: I’m without dough).
Brazilian reais come in several bills, each with its own
color and an animal found in Brazil on the back. The
bills are as follows: R$1 (green/hummingbird), R$2
(blue/tortoise), R$5 (purple and blue/heron), R$10
(red/parrot), R$20 (yellow/golden-faced lion monkey),
R$50 (brown/jaguar), and R$100 (blue/grouper fish).
Coins come in R$1, R$0.50, R$0.25, R$0.10, R$0.05 and
R$0.01. The um centavo (oong sen-tah-voh; one-cent)
coin is tiny and is hardly worth anything. Stores more
often than not let you get away with paying to within
R$0.05 of the price, to avoid having the one-cent
pieces around. Remember: They’re worth 1⁄100 of one
real, or about 1⁄3 of a U.S. penny.
To say a preço (pdeh-soo; the price), use the follow-
ing formula: the number of reais, plus e (ee; and),
plus the number of centavos (sehn-tah-vohz; cents):
 R$12,30: doze reais e trinta centavos (doh-zee
heh-eyez ee tdeen-tah sehn-tah-vohz; 12 reais
and 30 cents)
 R$4,60: quatro reais e sessenta centavos
(kwah-tdoh heh-eyez ee seh-sehn-tah sehn-tah-
vohz; 4 reais and 60 cents)
 R$2,85: dois reais e oitenta e cinco centavos
(doh-eez heh-eyez ee oh-ee-tehn-tah ee sing-koh
sehn-tah-vohz; 2 reais and 85 cents)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
50
Did you notice that instead of decimal
points, Brazilians use commas? The decimal
point is reserved in Portuguese for numbers
beginning with a thousand — which looks
like 1.000. So R$2.440 would be two thousand,
four hundred and forty reais.
Getting money from banks and ATMs
When you need to get or exchange money, the follow-
ing words are very important:
 agência de viagens (ah-zhang-see-ah jee vee-ah-
zhangz; travel agency)
 banco (bahn-koh; bank)
 caixa automático (kah-ee-shah ah-ooh-toh-mah-
chee-koh; ATM)
 cartão de banco (kah-tah-ooh jee bahn-koh;
ATM card)
 cartão de crédito (kah-tah-ooh jee kdeh-jee-toh;
credit card)
 cartões internacionais (kah-toh-eez een-teh-nah-
see-ooh-nah-eez; international cards)
 cheques de viagem (sheh-keez jee vee-ah-zhang;
traveler’s checks)
 taxa de câmbio (tah-shah jee kahm-bee-oh;
exchange rate)
 retirar (heh-chee-dah; to withdraw)
 trocar (tdoh-kah; to change money)
To ask where the nearest banco or caixa automático
is, say:
 Por favor, sabe onde tem um caixa automático?
(poh fah-voh, sah-bee ohn-jee tang oohng kah-ee-
shah ah-ooh-toh-mah-chee-koh; Excuse me, do
you know where there’s an ATM?)
 Por favor, tem um banco perto daqui? (poh
fah-voh, tang oong bahn-koh peh-toh dah-kee;
Excuse me, is there a bank near here?)

Chapter 3: Numerical Gumbo: Counting of All Kinds 
51
Following up by asking whether the area the bank or
ATM is located is reasonably seguro (seh-goo-doh;
safe) is a good idea. Say O local é seguro? (ooh loh-
kah-ooh eh seh-goo-doh; Is the area safe?). If you avoid
withdrawing money at night, you should be fine.
Ask these questions when you want to change money:
 Trocam dólares por reais? (tdoh-kah-ooh doh-
lah-deez poh hay-eyez; Do you change dollars
for reais?)
 A quanto está o dólar? (ah kwahn-toh eh-stah
ooh doh-lah; What’s the rate for the dollar?)
 Cobram taxa de comissão? (koh-bdah-ooh tah-
shah jee koh-mee-sah-ooh; Do you charge a com-
mission fee?)
Brazilian vendors always seem to be out of
trocado (tdoh-kah-doh; change). Getting
large bills changed at the banco, right after
you get it out of the caixa automático, is
best. Vendors often ask Tem trocado? (tang
tdoh-kah-doh; Do you have change?) when
you pay, meaning “Do you have exact
change? That would help me out.”
Here’s a sample conversation about changing money:
Silvio: Por favor, trocam dólares por reais
aqui? (poh fah-voh, tdoh-kah-ooh doh-lah-deez
poh heh-eyez ah-kee? Excuse me please, do you
change dollars for reais here?)
Worker: Trocamos. (tdoh-kah-mooz; Yes, we do.
[Literally: We change.])
Silvio: Cobram taxa de comissão? (koh-bdah-
ooh tah-shah deh koh-mee-sah-ooh? Do you
charge a fee?)
Worker: Sim, é de dois por cento. Quanto quer
trocar? (sing, eh jee doh-eez poh-sehn-toh.
kwahn-toh keh tdoh-kah? Yes, it’s 2 percent. How
much do you want to change?)

Silvio: Tá bom. Me dá em notas de dez? (tah

Measuring Distances and 
Other Stuff
Measuring things like volume and weight is just as
universal. But if you happen to be an American, you’ll
find that the way Brazilians measure stuff is different:
They use the metric system.
Check out Table 3-1 for the names of metric measure-
ments and some U.S. equivalents.

Making New Friends and
Enjoying Small Talk
In This Chapter
 Saying hello
 Introducing yourself and friends
 Expressing who you are and how you are
 Talking about talking
 Taking in the weather
 Presenting family
S
aying “hello” and “goodbye” is the nuts and bolts
of any língua (ling-gwah; language). The próximo
passo (pdoh-see-moh pah-soh; next step) is introduc-
ing yourself to people and introducing the people
you’re with. You’ll want to tell people your nome
(noh-mee; name), maybe even your apelido (ah-peh-
lee-doh; nickname). Then comes the small talk about
the weather, friends, work, or family.
When you’re just learning a language, talking to
people — even about the most basic things — can be
a little stressful. But if you think about it, the first few
minutes of talking to anybody new usually involves
the same old questions. This chapter covers the ques-
tions that people who speak Portuguese are most
likely to ask you, as well as the questions you’ll prob-
ably want to ask them!

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
56
If you get a little lost in a conversation, these phrases
will help you out:
 Não entendi. (nah-ooh ehn-ten-jee; I didn’t
understand.)
 Oi? (oh-ee; What did you say? [informal])
 Poderia repetir, por favor? (poh-deh-dee-ah
heh-peh-chee poh fah-voh; Could you repeat
that, please?)
A Few Ways to Say 
Hello and Goodbye
Saying “hello” is the bare necessity whether you’re at
home or in Brazil. Here are the most common ways of
saying “hello” in Brazil:
 Oi. (oh-ee; Hi.)
 Olá. (oh-lah; Hello.)
If you’re walking into a shop, restaurant, or hotel, 
it’s more common to use “Good morning” or “Good
afternoon” — just like in English:
 Bom dia. (boh-oong jee-ah; Good morning.)
 Boa tarde. (boh-ah tah-jee; Good
afternoon/Good evening.)
 Boa noite. (boh-ah noh-ee-chee; Good evening/
Good night.)
In Brazil, a tarde (ah tah-jee; the afternoon)
starts and ends a little bit later than you may
be used to. The afternoon começa (koh-meh-
sah; starts) around 2 p.m. and ends at about
8 p.m. Noon to 2 p.m. is meio-dia (may-oh-
jee-ah; midday). But ninguém (ning-gang; no
one) ever says Bom meio-dia! Go figure.
They usually just say Boa tarde.

Chapter 4: Making New Friends 
57
Another way of saying hello in Brazil is by asking
directly, “How are you?” There are two ways of 
saying it:
 Tudo bem? (too-doh bang; How are you?
Literally: Everything well?)
 Tudo bom? (too-doh boh-oong; How are you?
Literally: Everything good?)
Here’s how you answer:
 Tudo bem. (too-doh bang; I’m good. Literally:
Everything well.)
 Tudo bom. (too-doh boh-oong; I’m good.
Literally: Everything good.)
So what’s the difference between Tudo bem
and Tudo bom, you ask? Here’s the big
answer: There is none! They mean the same
thing. But here’s a great trick: If someone
asks you Tudo bem? say Tudo bom. If it’s
Tudo bom? answer back Tudo bem. Just use
the expression opposite the one that the
other person used. People commonly com-
bine some of these phrases, like Olá, tudo
bom? (oh-lah, too-doh bong; Hello, how are
you?) or Oi, tudo bem? (oh-ee, too-doh bong;
Hi, how are you?).
The quick way to say goobye is simply to say Tchau!
(chow; Ciao!). Todo mundo (toh-doo moon-doh;
everyone. Literally: all world) in Brazil uses Tchau, in
almost all situations. It’s not like in English, where
Ciao! can sound a little snobby sometimes. In Brazil,
Tchau is used by everyone from the guy selling aba-
caxi (ah-bah-kah-shee; pineapple) on the street to the
dono (doh-noo; owner) of the restaurant where you’re
eating.
It’s also very common in Brazil to say Até (ah-teh;
until) plus another word when you think you’ll see
the person de novo (jee noh-voh; again). If you only
memorizar (meh-moh-dee-zah; memorize) one of the
following phrases, pick Até logo. It never fails.

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
58
 Até logo. (ah-teh loh-goo; See you later.)
 Até mais. (ah-teh mah-eez; See you.)
 Até amanhã. (ah-teh ah-mahn-yah; See you
tomorrow.)
 Até a semana que vem. (ah-teh ah seh-mah-nah
kee vang; See you next week.)
Some people like to say religious phrases, too:
 Fique com Deus. (fee-kee kohng deh-ooz; Take
care. Literally: Be with God.)
 Adeus. (ah-deh-oohz; Goodbye. Literally: To
God.)
A gente se vê (ah zhang-chee see veh; See you around)
is a common slang-sounding of way of saying “bye” in
a casual situation.
Introducing Yourself
Introducing yourself is easy as torta de morango (toh-
tah jee moh-dahng-goh; strawberry pie). Here are a
couple different ways to do it:
 O meu nome é . . . (ooh meh-ooh noh-mee eh;
My name is . . .)
 Eu sou o/a . . . (eh-ooh soh ooh/ah; I’m . . .)
Use the o in front of your name if you’re male and the
a if you’re female. Because o is the masculine way of
saying “the” and a is the feminine “the,” saying Eu sou
a Karen is like saying, “I’m the Karen.” It sounds
estranho (eh-stdahn-yoh; weird) in English.
To ask someone his or her name, say Qual é seu
nome? (kwah-ooh eh seh-ooh noh-mee; What’s your
name?). After someone asks you for your name, you
can say E o seu? (ee ooh seh-ooh; And yours?).
If you want to apresentar (ah-pdeh-zen-tah; intro-
duce) friends or family members after you introduce
yourself, say:

Chapter 4: Making New Friends 
59
Este é . . . (es-chee eh; This is . . . [name of man])
Esta é . . . (eh-stah eh; This is . . . [name of
woman])
Estes são . . . (es-jeez sah-ooh; These are . . .
[names of multiple people])
Estas são . . . (eh-stahz sah-ooh; These are . . .
[names of women])
Here are some common introductions:
 Este é o meu amigo. (es-chee eh ooh meh-ooh
ah-mee-goo; This is my friend. [male])
 Esta é a minha amiga. (eh-stah eh ah ming-yah
ah-mee-gah; This is my friend. [female])
 Estes são os meus amigos. (es-cheez sah-ooh
ooz meh-ooz ah-mee-gooz; These are my friends.
[group of all men or men and women])
 Estas são as minhas amigas. (eh-stahz sah-ooh
ahz ming-yahz ah-mee-gahz; These are my
friends. [group of all women])
First Names, Last Names, 
and Nicknames
So when someone says Qual é seu nome? she’s after
your first name. If she says Qual é seu nome com-
pleto? (kwah-ooh eh seh-ooh nah-mee kohm-pleh-too;
What’s your full name? Literally: What’s your com-
plete name?), then she’s after both your primeiro
nome (pdee-may-doh nah-mee; name) and
sobrenome (soh-bdee nah-mee; surname. Literally:
over-names).
Brazilians always use o or a before a person’s name: 
A Mônica (ah moh-nee-kah), a Cláudia (ah klah-ooh-
jee-ah), o Nicolas (ooh nee-koh-lahs), o Roberto
(ooh hoh-beh-too). It’s like saying “the Steve” or “the
Diane.”

Os brasileiros (oohz bdah-zee-lay-dohz; Brazilians)
are pretty informal (een-foh-mah-ooh; informal). They
call their president just Lula. No one — not even on
news shows — calls him Senhor da Silva. If people
want to be formal, they’d say o Presidente Lula (ooh
pdeh-zee-dang-chee loo-lah) — that’s like saying
“President George” for George Bush.
Brazilians prefer to stick to primeiros nomes (first
names) in general, but when the situation is more
formal, they use the terms Senhor (seen-yoh; Mr.) and
Senhora (seen-yoh-dah; Mrs.) pretty much just like
you use “Mr.” and “Mrs.” in English. When you’re talk-
ing to your elderly vizinho (vee-zeen-yoh; neighbor),
he’s Senhor so-and-so. When a casal (kah-zah-ooh;
couple) walks in to a real estate agency, they’re called
Senhor e Senhora (seen-yoh ee seen-yoh-dah; Mr. and
Mrs.) so-and-so.
Brazilians always use o/a (the) before saying “Mr.” or
“Mrs.” It’s like saying “the Mr. Oliveira.” Weird, right?
Well, here goes:
 o Senhor Oliveira (ooh seen-yoh oh-lee-vay-dah;
Mr. Oliveira)
 o Senhor da Silva (ooh seen-yoh dah see-ooh-
vah; Mr. da Silva)
 a Senhora Tavares (ah seen-yoh-dah tah-vah-
deez; Mrs. Tavares)
 a Senhora Gimenes (ah seen-yoh-dah zhee-men-
ez; Mrs. Gimenes)
Another difference is that in Brazil, it’s common to
use Senhor and Senhora for young people — even
teenagers. There’s no term like Miss for younger
women. And it’s also normal for people to say Senhor
David or Senhora Luciana — using the first name
instead of the last name.
Imagine you’re talking to the concierge of your hotel.
He treats you with respect because it’s his job to
serve you. He asks you the following questions if
you’re a man:

Chapter 4: Making New Friends 
61
 O senhor mora aqui? (ooh seen-yoh moh-dah
ah-kee; Do you live here?)
 O senhor está cansado? (ooh seen-yoh eh-stah
kahn-sah-doo; Are you tired?)
 O senhor gosta do restaurante? (ooh seen-yoh
goh-stah doo heh-stah-oo-dahn-chee; Do you like
the restaurant?)
And he asks you these questions if you’re a woman:
 A senhora gosta de dançar? (ah seen-yoh-dah
goh-stah jee dahn-sah; Do you like to dance?)
 A senhora é americana? (ah seen-yoh-dah eh
ah-meh-dee-kah-nah; Are you American?)
 A senhora vai para a praia? (ah seen-yoh-dah
vah-ee pah-dah ah pdah-ee-ah; Are you going to
the beach?)
Now imagine that the speaker who asked you all
these questions is just another fellow traveler — a
Brazilian one. All the o senhor’s and the a senhora’s
become você (voh-seh; you [informal]). Você is what
you call people when you don’t need to be formal.
Knowing Who, What, and Where
Key to any conversation are the basic question words
onde (ohn-jee; where), quando (kwahn-doh; when),
and quanto (kwahn-toh; how much). If you want to
ask someone what something means, say O que quer
dizer . . . ? (ooh keh keh jee-zeh). It literally means
“What does . . . mean to say?”
Here are some other basic words to help you find
information:
 o quê? (ooh keh; what?)
 quem? (kang; who?)
 por quê? (poh-keh; why?)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
62
 como? (koh-moo; how?)
 qual? (kwah-ooh; which?)
The following are examples of how to use these
words:
 O que é isso? (ooh keh eh ee-soh; What is that?)
 Onde fica a praia? (ohn-jee fee-kah ah pdah-ee-
ah; Where is the beach?)
 Quando é o concerto? (kwahn-doh eh ooh
kohn-seh-toh; When is the concert?)
 Quem é ele? (kang eh eh-lee; Who is he?)
 Por que é assim? (poh keh eh ah-sing; Why is it
like that?)
 Como ela é? (koh-moo eh eh-lah; What is she
like?)
 Quanto é? (kwahn-toh eh; How much does it
cost?)
 Qual carro é seu? (kwah-ooh kah-hoh eh seh-
ooh; Which car is yours?)
“Where Are You From?”
The first question you’re likely to be asked in Brazil is
De onde você é? (jee ohng-jee voh-seh eh; Where are
you from?). Brazilians are very proud that people
from all over the mundo (moon-doh; world) come to
visit their country. They’re always curious to imagine
how longe (lohn-zhee; far) you came. They may also
ask De que país você é? (jee kee pah-eez voh-seh eh;
Which country are you from?).
Here’s how you can answer:
 Eu sou inglês (eh-ooh soh eeng-glehz; I’m
English.)
 Eu sou da Inglaterra (eh-ooh soh dah eeng-glah-
teh-hah; I’m from England.)

Here are some countries and nationalities that you
may find useful:
 Estados Unidos (ehs-tah-dooz ooh-nee-dooz;
United States)
 americano/a (ah-meh-dee-kahn-oh/ah; American)
 Canadá (kah-nah-dah; Canada)
 canadense (kah-nah-dehn-see; Canadian)
 Inglaterra (eeng-glah-teh-hah; England)
 inglês/inglesa (eeng-glehz/gleh-sah; English)
 Austrália (ah-oo-stdah-lee-ah; Australia)
 australiano/a (ah-oo-stdah-lee-ah-noh/nah;
Australian)
 Alemanha (ah-leh-mahn-yah; Germany)
 alemão/ã (ah-leh-mah-ooh/mah; German)
 França (fdahn-sah; France)
 francês/francesa (fdahn-sehz/fdahn-seh-zah;
French)
 China (shee-nah; China)
 chinês/chinesa (shee-nehz/shee-neh-zah;
Chinese)
 Japão (zhah-pah-ooh; Japan)
 japonês/japonesa (zhah-poh-nez/zhah-poh-nes-
ah; Japanese)
Don’t be surprised if a Brazilian from a
touristy place like Rio responds Eu já sabia
(eh-ooh jah sah-bee-ah; I knew it) when you
say which country you’re from. With so
many tourists around, Brazilians get plenty
of practice at pinpointing nationalities.
And a tip while I’m talking about Americans: A few
Brazilians get offended by the term americano. They
say, “We’re Americans, too!” These folks prefer the
term norte-americano (noh-chee-ah-meh-dee-kah-noh;
North American).

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies

Brazilians often tell you where they’re from by using
the nickname for people from their city or state. Here
are the most common ones:
 gaúcho/a (gah-ooh-shoh/ah; someone from Rio
Grande do Sul state)
 paulistano/a (pow-lee-stahn-oh/ah; someone
from the city of São Paulo)
 paulista (pow-lee-stah; someone from São Paulo
state)
 carioca (kah-dee-oh-kah; someone from the city
of Rio)
 baiano/a (bah-ee-ah-noh/ah; someone from
Bahia state)
 mineiro/a (mee-nay-doh/ah; someone from
Minas Gerais state)
Gente boa is a very common phrase in
Brazil. It’s used to describe people who are
laid-back and down-to-earth. It literally
means “good people,” but you can use it to
describe one person or a group of people.
Here are a couple phrases you can use to win
Brazilian friends:
 Você é gente boa. (voh-seh eh zhang-chee boh-
ah; You’re a really cool person.)
 Os seus amigos são muito gente boa. (oohz say-
oohz ah-mee-gohz sah-ooh moo-ee-toh zhang-

Describing the World around You
Brazilians use ser (seh; to be) to describe the perma-
nent qualities of someone or something: “New York is
an island.” “New York is big.” “New York is pretty.”
“She is married.” “He is from New York.” “He is rich
and nice.” The verb estar (eh-stah; to be) is used in
situations where the quality being described is tem-
porary, like being tired. Say you’re talking about your
friend Ana, who has a rich husband. Don’t worry
yourself over questions like “What if Ana’s husband
goes bankrupt tomorrow?” or “What if Ana gets
divorced tomorrow?” Just remember the decade rule:
If the quality you’re talking about seems like it will
last another ten years, use ser.
Describing permanent qualities: Ser
The verb ser (seh) is the one most often used in
Portuguese. It’s an irregular verb (look at Chapter 2
for a quickie lesson on verbs). But it’s the easiest
irregular verb there is in Portuguese. Check it out:

 Ela é (eh-lah eh; She is)
 alta (ah-ooh-tah; tall)
 bonita (boo-nee-tah; pretty)
 loira (loy-dah; blonde)

 rica (hee-kah; rich)
 uma modelo (ooh-mah moh-deh-loh; a model)
 do Rio Grande do Sul (doo hee-ooh gdahn-jee

Now that you know the verb ser, you can say a ton of
things:
 Eu sou homem. (eh-ooh so oh-mang; I am a man.)
 Eu sou da Califórnia. (eh-ooh so dah kah-lee-
foh-nee-ah; I am from California.)
 Ele é muito alto. (eh-lee eh moo-ee-toh ah-ooh-

 Nós somos amigos. (nohz soh-mooz ah-mee-

 Elas são simpáticas. (eh-lahz sah-ooh seem-pah-

 Ela é jovem. (eh-lah eh zhoh-vang; She is young.)
 Nós somos da Austrália. (nohz soh-mooz dah

 Eles são inteligentes. (eh-leez sah-ooh een-teh-

As you can see, ser goes perfectly with descriptions
of things and people. Now glance at some basic

If you want to sound a little more like a native
speaker, use né at the end of a sentence to
mean “Right?” (particularly in informal situa-
tions). Né is the contraction of não é (nah-
ooh eh; Literally: is not), which can be used to
mean the same thing as well. And use É at the
beginning of a sentence to affirm a question
someone just asked you. These words aren’t
necessary for you to learn, but they’re fun,
and Brazilians use them all the time!
Describing temporary qualities: Estar
The verb estar (eh-stah) is used most often to describe
mood or physical state or physical location. Use estar
to say you’re nervoso (neh-voh-zoo; nervous) about
something, that you’re doente (doh-en-chee; sick), or
that you’re at the banco (bahn-koh; bank). Tomorrow,
you may be “happy,” “well,” and “at work”!
To find out the different forms of estar, take a look:

Speaking about Speaking
Now onto a really easy, fun verb: falar (fah-lah; to
speak/to talk). Talking is, after all, how to really learn
a language!
One of the most important phrases using falar is
Como se fala . . . ? (koh-moo see fah-lah; How do you
say . . . ?). This great phrase got me out of many lin-
guistic jams.
You also use falar to refer to languages:
Eu falo inglês. (eh-ooh fah-loh eeng-glehz;
I speak English.)

Some Brazilians prefer to say they speak brasileiro
(bdah-zee-lay-doh; Brazilian) instead of português or
português do Brasil.
Here are some easy ways to use falar:
 Eu gostaria de falar chinês. (eh-ooh goh-stah-
dee-ah jee fah-lah shee-nehz; I would like to
speak Chinese.)

you speak?)
The Good, the Bad, and the
Humid: Weather
Though the clima (klee-mah; weather) in some parts
of Brazil is nearly the same year-round, you’ll find
that Brazilians talk about the weather just as much as
people from countries with more dramatic weather.
In southern Brazil, and as far north as São Paulo, the
inverno (een-veh-noo; winter) can get very frio (fdee-
ooh; chilly). It even neva (neh-vah; snows) some
years in Rio Grande do Sul state, the southernmost
part of the country. In northern and northeastern
Brazil, the concept of having quatro estações (kwah-
tdoh eh-stah-soh-eez; four seasons) seems very for-
eign to locals. For them, there are just two seasons:
temporada de chuva (temp-oh-dah-dah jee shoo-vah;
rainy season) and temporada seca (temp-oh-dah-dah
seh-kah; dry season). At many schools across Brazil,
instructors teach children only about verão (veh-dah-
ooh; summer) and inverno.

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
74
Here are a few more seasonal terms:
 outono (oh ooh-toh-noo; autumn)
 primavera (pdee-mah-veh-dah; spring)
 estação (ehs-tah-sah-ooh; season)
Here’s a conversation people might have about the
weather in Brazil:
Vinicius: Que calor! Estava esperando chuva.
(kee kah-loh! ehs-dah-vah ehs-peh-dahn-doh
shoo-vah; It’s so hot! I was expecting rain.)
Worker: Não e só chuva aqui como todo mundo
pensa. (nah-ooh eh soh shoo-vah ah-kee koh-
moh toh-doo moon-doh pen-sah; It’s not all rain
here like everyone thinks.)
Vinicius: Porque estamos em temporada de
chuva, né? (poh-keh ehs-tahm-ohz ang tem-poh-
dah-dah jee shoo-vah, neh? Because we’re in the
rainy season, right?)
Worker: Estamos. Na verdade, não é típico ter
sol em julho. (ehs-tah-mohz. nah veh-dah-jee
nah-ooh eh chee-pee-koh teh soh-ooh ang joo-lee-
oh. We are. Actually, it’s not normal to have sun
in July.)
Vinicius: Tenho sorte, então. (tang-yoh soh-chee,
en-tah-ooh; I’m lucky, then.)
Worker: Sim, mas quem sabe — pela tarde pode
precisar de um guarda-chuva. (sing, mah-eez
kang sah-bee — peh-lah tah-jee poh-jee pdeh-see-
zah jee oong goo-ah-dah shoo-vah; Yeah, but who
knows — in the afternoon you may need an
umbrella.)
Vinicius: Obrigado pela dica. Vou levar um.
(ohb-dee-gah-doh peh-lah jee-kah. voh leh-vah
oong; Thanks for the tip. I’ll bring one along.)

Figuring Out Family Connections
Brazilian families are very tight-knit; they tend to live
in the same cities as their pais (pah-eez; parents) and
irmãos (ee-mah-oohz; siblings/brothers and sisters)
and to see each other at least once a week.
Take a look at Table 4-3 for more words to express
family relações (heh-lah-soh-eez; relationships).

In Brazil, street kids often call any adult tia
(chee-ah; aunt) or tio (chee-ooh; uncle) —
especially when they’re asking for money or
for help. If you find yourself in this situation,
it’s okay to give the child a small amount of
money. Otherwise, just say, Não posso (nah-
ooh poh-soo; I can’t).
Giving Out Your Contact
Information
After your first conversation with new friends, you
may decide you’d like to keep in contact with them.
Or they may ask you Qual o seu número de telefone?

Chapter 4: Making New Friends 
77
(kwah-oo ooh seh-oo noo-meh-doh jee teh-leh-fohn-ee;
What’s your phone number?) You respond O meu
número de telefone é . . . (ooh meh-oo noo-meh-doh
jee teh-leh-foh-nee eh; My phone number is . . .).
Here are some other questions you can ask them.
Notice the use of seu (your) and meu (my), which I
talk about earlier in this chapter:
 Qual é o seu sobrenome? (kwah-ooh eh ooh
seh-oo soh-bdee-noh-mee; What’s your last
name?)
 Onde mora? (ohn-jee moh-dah; Where do you
live?)
 Qual é o seu e-mail? (kwah-ooh eh ooh seh-oo
ee-may-oh; What’s your e-mail?)
And here’s how you can respond if you’re asked these
questions:
 O meu sobrenome é . . . (ooh meh-oo soh-bdee-
noh-mee eh; My last name is . . .)
 Eu moro . . . (eh-ooh moh-doo; I live . . .)
 O meu e-mail é . . . (ooh meh-oo ee-may-oh eh;
My e-mail is . . .)

acquainted with Brazilian cuisine and how to order it,
talk about it, and enhance your enjoyment of it.
Bom Apetite! Enjoy Your Meal!
Mastering the dining basics is essential. But before
you take a seat at the mesa (meh-zah; table), check
out some of these place-setting terms:
 garfo (gah-foh; fork)
 faca (fah-kah; knife)
 colher (kool-yeh; spoon)
 prato (pdah-toh; plate)
 prato fundo (pdah-toh foon-doh; bowl)

 almoço (ah-ooh-moh-soo; lunch)
 jantar (zhahn-tah; dinner)

 Bom apetite! (boh-oong ah-peh-tee-chee; Bon

Brazilians often just say Quer? (keh; Do you
want?) to ask whether you want something.
They may offer you a bite of their food by
pointing to it and saying Quer?
At the Restaurant: 
Trying Local Foods
The classic Brazilian comida (koh-mee-dah; meal/
food) is simples (seem-pleez; basic). It’s a piece of
carne (kah-nee; beef) served with feijão (fay-zhow;
beans), arroz (ah-hohz; rice), and salada (sah-lah-
dah; salad). In this section, I explore the restaurant
experience and the food you can find there.

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
82
You can get a refeição (heh-fay-sah-ooh; meal) at five
basic places in Brazil:
 boteco (boo-teh-koo; cheap restaurant where
people also go to drink beer or take shots of
liquor)
 padaria (pah-dah-dee-ah; bakery [at Brazilian
padarias, you can also sit down for a meal])
 lanchonete (lahn-shoh-neh-chee; restaurant that
specializes in hamburgers, sandwiches, and fruit
juices)
 restaurante por quilo (heh-stah-ooh-dahn-chee
poh kee-loh; self-serve buffet, pay per kilo
[these are delicious, healthy, and cheap in
Brazil])
 restaurante (heh-stah-ooh-dahn-chee; restaurant)
The first four options are for quick meals. They gener-
ally offer sanduíches (sahn-dwee-sheez; sandwiches),
hambúrgueres (ahm-booh-geh- dez; hamburgers), 
salgados (sah-ooh-gah-dohz; savory pastries), and
pratos feitos (pdah-tohz fay-tohz; a combo plate, 
usually rice, beans, meat, and salad).
If you need to go to the bathroom in a restau-
rante, you can just say O banheiro? (ooh
bahn-yay-doh; The bathroom?). To be fancier,
you can say Por favor, onde fica o banheiro?
(poh fah-voh ohn-jee fee-kah ooh bahn-yay-
doh; Where is the bathroom, please?)
Ordering at a restaurant
When you arrive at a restaurante (heh-stah-ooh-dahn-
chee; restaurant), the garçom (gah-sohng; waiter) or
garçonete (gah-soh-neh-chee; waitress) leads you 
to a mesa (meh-zah; table). He or she may ask you
whether you want to sentar (sehn-tah; sit) fora (foh-
dah; outside) or dentro (dehn-tdoh; inside).
Then the waiter or waitress gives you the cardápio
(kah-dah-pee-oh; menu). You may see these sections:

Chapter 5: Enjoying a Drink and a Snack (or Meal!)
83
 entradas (ehn-tdah-dahz; starters)
 pratos principais (pdah-tohz pdeen-see-pah-eez;
main dishes)
 bebidas (beh-bee-dahz; drinks)
 sobremesas (soh-bdee-meh-zahz; desserts)
 especialidades da casa (eh-speh-see-ah-lee-dah-
jeez dah kah-zah; house specialties)
When you’re pronto (pdohn-toh; ready) to pedir (peh-
jeeh; order. Literally: to ask for), you can just say
either
 Quero . . . por favor (keh-doo . . . poh-fah-voh;
I want . . . please)
 Vou querer. . . . (voh keh-deh; I will have. . . .
Literally: I will want. . . .)
If you don’t know what you want, you can ask the
garçom O que recomenda? (ooh keh heh-koh-mehn-
dah; What do you recommend?). If you want to go
with what is recommended, say OK, tá bom (oh-kay
tah boh-oong; Okay, I’ll go with that. Literally: That’s
good.).
If you want to ask for something specific, say Tem . . . ?
(tang; Do you have . . . ?). You can fill in the blank with
one of the following words or phrases:
 sopa (soh-pah; soup)
 salada (sah-lah-dah; salad)
 sanduíches (sahn-doo-ee-sheez; sandwiches)
 algo para crianças (ah-ooh-goh pah-dah kdee-
ahn-sahz; something for kids)
 pratos vegetarianos (pdah-tohz veh-zheh-teh-
dee-ah-nohz; vegetarian dishes)
You can also use Tem . . . ? to ask whether a prato
(pdah-toh; dish) contains a specific ingrediente
(eeng-gdeh-jee-ehn-chee; ingredient) that you may or
may not want:

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
84
 Tem carne? (tang kah-nee; Does it have meat 
in it?)
 Tem frutos do mar? (tang fdoo-tohz doo mah;
Does it have any seafood in it?)
 Tem azeite de dendê? (tang ah-zay-chee jee
dehn-deh; Does it have palm oil?)
If you know a prato has a specific ingrediente that
you want retirado (heh-chee-dah-doh; taken out), say
sem . . . (sang; without . . .). You can fill in the blank
with one of the following words:
 queijo (kay-zhoh; cheese)
 manteiga (mahn-tay-gah; butter)
 maionese (mah-ee-oh-neh-zee; mayonnaise)
 leite (lay-chee; milk)
 açúcar (ah-soo-kah; sugar)
 cebola (seh-boh-lah; onion)
 molho (mohl-yoh; sauce)
 óleo (oh-lay-oh; vegetable oil)
 alho (ahl-yoh; garlic)
If you like your carne (kah-nee; meat) a certain way,
you can ask for it to be
 grelhada (gdeh-ooh-yah-dah; grilled)
 cozida (koh-zee-dah; boiled)
 frito (fdee-toh; fried)
 assado (ah-sah-doh; sautéed)
Brazilian food is not picante (pee-kahn-chee; spicy).
But you can ask for pimenta (pee-mehn-tah; hot
chilies soaked in oil) or molho de pimenta (mohl-yoh
jee pee-mehn-tah; hot sauce).

Chapter 5: Enjoying a Drink and a Snack (or Meal!)

Ordering a drink
To help you wash down all the wonderful Brazilian
food, you may want one of the following bebidas
(beh-bee-dahz; drinks):
 água sem gás (ah-gwah sang gahz; still mineral
water)
 água com gás (ah-gwah koh-oong gahz;
sparkling mineral water)
 Guaraná Antarctica (gwah-dah-nah ahn-tah-chee-
kah; Brazil’s most popular brand-name soda,
made from the Amazonian berry guaraná —
Antarctica is the brand name)
 Guaraná diet (gwah-dah-nah dah-ee-chee; diet
Guaraná)
 Coca-Cola (koh-kah koh-lah; Coke)
 Coca light (koh-kah lah-ee-chee; Diet Coke)
 cerveja (seh-veh-zhah; can of beer)
 chope (shoh-pee; light draft beer)
 vinho (ving-yoo; wine)
 café (kah-feh; coffee)
 chá (shah; tea)
 leite (lay-chee; milk)
If you go to a bar in Brazil, you may notice people
saying Mais um (mah-eez oong) or Mais uma (mah-
eez ooh-mah) a lot. The phrases mean “I’ll have
another” (Literally: More one).
The national drink of Brazil is the caipirinha (kah-ee-
pee-deen-yah). It’s made with cachaça (kah-shah-sah;
sugarcane liquor), gelo (zheh-loh; ice), limão (lee-
mah-ooh; lime) and açúcar (ah-soo-kah; sugar). You
can also order a caipifruta (kah-ee-pee-fdoo-tah) — a
caipirinha made from a fruit of your choice, instead of
lime.

Brazilians love their juice and the average restaurante
(heh-stah-ooh-dahn-chee; restaurant) has between 10
and 20 types of sucos (soo-kohz; fruit juices) to choose
from. If you want to ask for the fruit in suco form, say
suco de . . . (soo-koh jee; juice of . . .). Just plug one of
these fruits into the blank:
 laranja (lah-dahn-zhah; orange)
 abacaxi (ah-bah-kah-shee; pineapple)
 mamão (mah-mah-ooh; papaya)
 melancia (meh-lahn-see-ah; watermelon)
 goiaba (goy-ah-bah; guava)
 maracujá (mah-dah-koo-zhah; passion fruit)
 manga (mahn-gah; mango)
My favorite suco is cupuaçu (koo-poo-ah-soo; milky
white Amazonian fruit with a tangy taste).
Here are some helpful phrases that use the two drink-
ing verbs beber and tomar:
 É preciso beber muita água todos os dias. (eh
pdeh-see-zoh beh-beh moh-ee-tah ah-gwah toh-
dooz ooz jee-ahz; It’s necessary to drink a lot of
water every day.)
 Ele bebe muito. (eh-lee beh-bee moh-ee-toh; He
drinks a lot [of alcohol].)
 O que quer para beber? (ooh kee keh pah-dah
beh-beh; What do you want to drink?)
 Gostaria de tomar uma Coca-Cola? (gohs-tah-
dee-ah jee toh-mah ooh-mah koh-kah koh-lah;
Would you like to have a Coke?)
 Vamos tomar um drinque. (vah-mohz toh-mah
oong dreeng-kee; Let’s have a drink/cocktail.)
First foods up: Salads and condiments
Saladas (sah-lah-dahz; salads) in Brazil are very basic
if they come with your meal. But the salad bars, on
the other hand, are stocked full of interesting items.

Chapter 5: Enjoying a Drink and a Snack (or Meal!)
87
Brazilians tend not to mix salad ingredients like
people do in the United States. Instead, they usually
put the items side by side and then drizzle olive oil
and red wine vinegar on top.
Here are some typical Brazilian items that you can
expect to see at the salad bar:
 alface (ah-ooh-fah-see; lettuce)
 rúcula (hoo-koo-lah; arugula)
 tomate (toh-mah-chee; tomato)
 tomate seco (toh-mah-chee seh-koh; sun-dried
tomato)
 milho (meew-yoh; corn)
 palmito (pah-ooh-mee-toh; heart of palm)
 cenoura (seh-noh-dah; carrots)
 cebola (seh-boh-lah; onion)
 beterraba (beh-teh-hah-bah; beets)
 abobrinha (ah-boh-bdeeng-yah; zucchini)
 mozarela de búfala (moh-tzah-deh-lah jee boo-
fah-lah; fresh mozzarella)
 queijo (kay-zhoh; cheese)
 azeite de oliva (ah-zay-chee jee oh-lee-vah; 
olive oil)
 vinagre (vee-nah-gdee; red wine vinegar)
 vinagrete (vee-nah-gdeh-chee; chopped tomato,
onion, and green bell pepper, with vinegar.
Literally: vinaigrette [Brazilians put vinagrete on
barbecued meat])
A note about alface: Brazilians call iceberg
lettuce alface americano (ah-ooh-fah-see ah-
meh-dee-kah-noh; American lettuce)! That’s
because iceberg lettuce is more popular in
the United States than it is in Brazil.

On to the main course
The most famous Brazilian dish is called feijoada (fay-
zhoh-ah-dah; bean/pig-parts stew). It has orelha de
porco (oh-dehl-yah jee poh-koo; pig’s ears) and even
joelho de porco (zhoh-ehl-yoh jee poh-koo; pig’s
knees), in addition to the more nobre (noh-bdee;
good quality. Literally: noble) parts of the pig.
Here’s an index of classic Brazilian food items and
dishes — besides churrasco (choo-hah-skoo;
Brazilian barbeque), which I cover in the “Basking 
in Brazilian barbeque” section, and feijoada:
 limão (lee-mah-ooh; lime): Brazilians squeeze
lime on just about anything, especially the clas-
sic meal combo of rice, beans, and skirt beef
steak. It’s also used in juices and desserts. Don’t
try to ask for a lemon in Brazil — they don’t
have any.
 coco (koh-koh; coconut): Brazilians love
coconut. They drink coconut juice out of a
whole green coconut, through a straw. Men
chop off a top slice of the coconut with a
machete and then sell it for 1 real (about 30¢)
on the beach and on the street. Coco is also
used in lots of main dishes from Bahia state.
 pão de queijo (pah-ooh jee kay-zhoh; cheese
bread): Sold either as little balls or in pieces the
size of a biscuit, it’s unbelievably delicious.
 moqueca (moh-keh-kah; thick fish stew from
Bahia state): This stew is made with azeite de
dendê (ah-zay-chee jee dehn-deh; palm oil),
which is hard on some stomachs, and leite de
coco (lay-chee jee koh-koo; coconut milk).
 acarajé (ah-kah-dah-zheh; deep-fried black-eyed
pea cakes, filled with tiny unpeeled shrimp, raw
onions, tomato, green pepper, and peanut
sauce): This popular dish from Bahia state is
sold on beaches and on the street. It’s also
made with azeite de dendê.

Chapter 5: Enjoying a Drink and a Snack (or Meal!)

 coxinha (koh-sheeng-yah; mashed potatoes,
fried, shaped into a teardrop, with shredded
chicken inside): You can find these at most
corner botecos (boo-teh-kooz; cheap restau-
rants) or bakeries in Brazil.
 açaí na tigela com granola (ah-sah-ee nah tee-
zheh-lah koh-oong gdah-noh-lah; Amazonian
fruit sorbet in a large bowl, topped with granola
and sometimes honey): This is the favored
beach food of Brazilian surfers. Açaí is a small
eggplant-colored berry.
 farofa (fah-doh-fah; toasted manioc flour mixed
in with bits of fried pork and scrambled eggs):
This is served with feijoada or on the side with
your steak. Mmmm. A not-to-miss!
 mandioca frita (mahn-jee-ah-kah fdee-tah; fried
yucca): This is my favorite Brazilian food item.
It’s way better than French fries!
 X-salada (sheez sah-lah-dah; cheeseburger with
lettuce and tomato. Literally: cheese with salad):
The letter x is pronounced sheez in Portuguese,
which sounds like the English word cheese, so
they just write the letter x. Brazilians always
have a sense of humor.
Basking in Brazilian barbeque
You can’t talk about Brazilian food without mention-
ing the beloved churrascaria (choo-hah-skeh-dee-ahz;
Brazilian-style barbeque joint). It’s a comer à vontade
(koh-meh ah vohn-tah-jee; all-you-can-eat) affair.
Waiters come by your mesa (meh-zah; table) with
about ten different cortes (koh-cheez; cuts) of meat
every five minutes or so. Sometimes they give you a
round card that’s verde (veh-jee; green) on one side
and vermelho (veh-mehl-yoh; red) on the other. When
you want to comer mais (koh-meh mah-eez; eat more),
place the card with the verde side up. And when
you’re satisfeito (sah-tees-fay-toh; full), be sure to
have the vermelho side showing. Otherwise, it’ll be
hard to fend off the garçons (gah-soh-oongz; waiters)!

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
90
Here are the typical cortes the garçons may bring by
your mesa:
 picanha (pee-kahn-yah; rumpsteak)
 alcatra (ow-kah-tdah; top sirloin)
 fraldinha (fdah-ooh-jeen-yah; flank steak)
 lingüiça (ling-gwee-sah; Brazilian chorizo-style
sausage)
 lombo (lohm-boh; pork loin)
 coxa de frango (koh-shah jee fdahn-goh; chicken
thighs)
 peito de frango (pay-toh jee fdahn-goh; chicken
breast)
 coração de frango (koh-dah-sah-ooh jee fdahn-
goh; chicken hearts)
 cordeiro (koh-day-doh; lamb)
Farinha (fah-ding-yah; manioc flour) is simply
esquisito (ehs-kee-zee-toh; bizarre) the first time you
encounter it. Flour you dip your meat into? I personally
didn’t like farinha for about a year. But now when I eat
a steak in the United States, I miss it. It’s an acquired
taste. And when you’ve acquired the taste, it’s impossi-
ble to viver sem (vee-veh sang; live without).
Vegetarianos (veh-zheh-teh-dee-ah-nohz;
vegetarians), never fear: Churrascarias
always have a wonderful salad buffet.
Doing dessert
End the meal with some sobremesa (soh-bdee-meh-
zah; dessert). Here are some of my favorites:
 bolo de laranja (boh-loo jee lah-dahn-zhah;
orange-flavored pound cake)
 bolo de limão (boh-loo jee lee-mah-ooh; lime-
flavored pound cake)
 flan (fluhn; flan custard)

Chapter 5: Enjoying a Drink and a Snack (or Meal!)
91
 mousse de maracujá (mooz jee mah-dah-koo-
jah; passion-fruit mousse)
 mousse de chocolate (mooz jee sho-koh-lah-
chee; chocolate mousse)
 sorvete (soh-veh-chee; ice cream)
 iogurte (ee-oh-goo-chee; yogurt)
 Romeu e Julieta (hoh-mee-ooh ee zhoo-lee-eh-
tah; guava paste with a piece of hard cheese.
Literally: Romeo and Juliet)
 pizza doce (pee-tzah doh-see; sweet pizza)
In Brazil it’s common for pizza joints to offer several
dessert pizzas. Chocolate e morango (sho-koh-lah-
chee ee; chocolate and strawberry) is an experience
not to be missed.
You may want a cafezinho (kah-feh-zeen-yoh; shot of
Brazilian coffee, served in a tiny cup or glass and
sweetened with a lot of sugar) to go with your
sobremesa. In good restaurants, you can ask for your
coffee to be sem açúcar (sang ah-soo-kah; unsweet-
ened). And if you’re really in a decadent mood, you
can ask for chantily (shan-chee-lee; whipped cream)
with your coffee.
Paying the bill
Paying the bill isn’t the most fun part of eating out,
but this dialogue can help you practice what to say
when the time comes.
Alberto: (To the waiter) A conta, por favor. (ah
kohn-tah, poh fah-voh. The check, please.)
Waiter: Vou trazê-la agora. (voh tdah-zeh-lah ah-
goh-dah. I’ll bring it now.)
Alberto: Aceita cartão? (ah-say-tah kah-tah-ooh?
Do you accept credit cards?)
Waiter: Aceitamos. (ah-say-tah-mohz; Yes, we do.
Literally: We accept.)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies

Alberto: (After he sees the bill) Que caro.
Noventa e sete reais? (kee kah-doh. noh-vehn-
tah ee seh-chee hay-eyes? How expensive.
Ninety-seven reais [about $30]?)
Marina: O serviço está incluído? (ooh seh-vee-
soh eh-stah eeng-kloo-ee-doo? Is the tip included?)
Alberto: Ah — foi por isso. É taxa de quinze por
cento. (ah — foh-ee poh ees-soh. eh tah-shah 
jee keen-zee poh sehn-toh; Ah — that’s why. It’s
15 percent.)
Marina: (To the waiter, after the credit-card
receipt comes back) Tem caneta? (tang kah-neh-
tah? Do you have a pen?)
Brazilians generally don’t leave a gorjeta
(goh-zheh-tah; American-type tip) at restau-
rants. If service is exceptional, you can leave a
gorjeta of 10 percent. Sometimes a 10 percent
or 15 percent tip is required and included in
the conta (kohn-tah; bill). You can tell because
it says serviço incluído (seh-vee-soh een-
kloo-ee-doh; tip included). Sales tax on a
conta shows up as I.V.A. (ee-vah).

I
n Brazil or anywhere, you can shop for prazer
(pdah-zeh; pleasure) or out of necessidade (neh-
seh-see-dah-jee; necessity). This chapter takes you
out shopping on the town, with all the vocab you
need to know.
Finding Places to Shop
You can fazer compras (fah-zeh kohm-pdahz; shop) in
these main ways: 
 uma loja na rua (ooh-mah loh-zhah nah hoo-ah;
a store on the street)
 uma feira (ooh-mah fay-dah; an outdoor market)
 supermercados (soo-peh-meh-kah-dooz; 
supermarkets)
 um shopping (oong shoh-ping; a shopping mall)
Brazil’s shoppings (shoh-pings; shopping malls) are
very similar to the malls you’ve been to wherever
you’re from. They have

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
96
 lojas de roupas (loh-zhahz jee hoh-pahz; cloth-
ing stores)
 livrarias (lee-vdah-dee-ahz; bookstores)
 farmácias (fah-mah-see-ahz; drugstores)
 lojas de CDs (loh-zhahz jee seh-dehz; CD stores)
 salas de cinema (sah-lahz jee see-neh-mah;
movie theaters)
 praças de alimentação (pdah-sahz jee ah-lee-
mehn-tah-sah-ooh; food courts)
In Brazil, shoppings are more associated
with the middle and upper classes. Those
people with less dinheiro (jeen-yay-doh;
money) prefer lojas na rua or feiras —
where coisas (koy-zahz; things) are mais
barato (mah-eez bah-dah-toh; cheaper).
Out for the Perfect Outfit
When you enter a Brazilian loja (loh-zhah; store) look-
ing for roupas (hoh-pahz; clothes), expect to hear
Posso ajudar? (poh-soo ah-zhoo-dah; Can I help you?).
After Posso ajudar? the atendente (ah-tehn-dehn-
chee; salesperson) may say
 Está procurando algo em específico? (eh-stah
pdoh-koo-dahn-doh ah-ooh-goh ang eh-speh-
see-fee-koh; Are you looking for something in
particular?)
 Já conhece a nossa loja? (zhah kohn-yeh-see ah
noh-sah loh-zhah; Are you already familiar with
our store?)
 Temos uma promoção. (teh-mohz ooh-mah
pdoh-moh-sah-ooh; We’re having a sale.)
And here are some things you can say to the atendente:
 Estou só olhando. (eh-stoh soh ohl-yahn-doh;
I’m just looking.)

Chapter 6: Shop ’Til You Drop
97
 Estou procurando . . . (eh-stoh pdoh-koo-dahn-
doh; I’m looking for . . .)
 Tem . . . ? (tang; Do you have . . . ?)
Skirts and shirts: Which to choose 
Now for the goods. De que precisa? (jee keh pdeh-see-
zah; What do you need?). You can tell the salesperson
Estou procurando (eh-stoh pdoh-koo-dahn-doh; I’m
looking for) one of the following items:
 calças (cow-sahz; pants)
 calça jeans (cow-sah jeenz; jeans)
 blusa (bloo-zah; woman’s shirt)
 camisa (kah-mee-zah; man’s shirt)
 camiseta (kah-mee-zeh-tah; T-shirt)
 saia (sah-ee-ah; skirt)
 vestido (ves-chee-doo; dress)
 cinto (seen-too; belt)
 meias (may-ahz; socks)
 sapatos (sah-pah-tohz; shoes)
 relógio (heh-law-zhee-oh; watch)
 chapéu (shah-peh-ooh; hat)
You may want to specify a tamanho (tah-mahn-yoh;
size). In Brazil, os tamanhos are either European
(when they’re in numbers — both clothing and shoes)
or generic, from small to extra large:
 pequeno (P) (peh-keh-noh; small)
 médio (M) (meh-jee-oh; medium)
 grande (G) (gdahn-jee; large)
 extra grande (GG) (ehz-tdah gdahn-jee; extra
large)
 tamanho único (tah-mahn-yoh oo-nee-koh; one
size fits all)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
98
Brazilian sizes are smaller than in North
America and in some European countries.
The same size shirt will be a medium, say, in
the United States but a large in Brazil. I’m a
semi-tall gal who tries to exercise regularly,
and sadly, I most often had to buy the
grande or extra grande sizes. So don’t feel
like you suddenly have to go on a regime
(heh-zhee-mee; diet) after you hit the
Brazilian stores!
You can also request a certain cor (koh; color):
 branco (bdahn-koh; white)
 preto (pdeh-toh; black)
 vermelho (veh-meh-ooh-yoh; red)
 verde (veh-jee; green)
 amarelo (ah-mah-deh-loo; yellow)
 azul (ah-zoo; blue)
 marrom (mah-hoh-oong; brown)
 rosa (hoh-zah; pink)
 roxo (hoh-shoo; purple)
 laranja (lah-dahn-zhah; orange)
If you want a different shade, just add claro (klah-doh;
light) or escuro (eh-skoo-doh; dark) after the name of
the color:
 azul claro (ah-zoo klah-doh; light blue)
 vermelho escuro (veh-meh-ooh-yoh eh-skoo-
doh; dark red)
So what happens if your cinto or camiseta is too
small? Or too big? You could say:
 É pequeno demais. (eh peh-keh-noh jee-my-eez;
It’s too small.)
 É grande demais. (eh gdahn-jee jee-my-eez; It’s
too big.)

Chapter 6: Shop ’Til You Drop
99
Putting the word demais after a word is like adding
the word too or really in front of an English word.
Check it out:
 É caro demais. (eh kah-doh jee-my-eez; It’s too
expensive.)
 É bonito demais. (eh boo-nee-too jee-my-eez; It’s
really beautiful.)
É bom demais! (eh boh-oong jee-my-eez; It’s fantastic!)
is a common phrase that literally means “It’s too good!”
Trying it on
The verb for trying on clothes is experimentar (eh-
speh-dee-mehn-tah). It’s easy to remember — what
does the word look like? Tá certo (tah seh-toh; That’s
right) — experiment. In Portuguese, you “experiment”
with new cores (koh-deez; colors) and new looks by
experimentando (eh-speh-dee-mehn-tahn-doh; trying
on) artigos de roupa (ah-chee-gohz jee hoh-pah; arti-
cles of clothing). Here are some common phrases
using experimentar:
 Quer experimentar . . . ? (keh eh-speh-dee-
mehn-tah; Would you like to try/try on . . . ?)
 Gostaria de experimentá-lo? (goh-stah-dee-ah
jee eh-speh-dee-mehn-tah-loh; Would you like to
try it on?)
 Posso experimentar . . . ? (poh-soo eh-speh-dee-
mehn-tah; Can I try/try on . . . ?)
 Posso experimentar essa blusa? (pah-soo eh-
speh-dee-mehn-tah eh-sah bloo-zah; Can I try on
this [women’s] shirt?)
 Tem que experimentar . . . (tang kee eh-speh-
dee-mehn-tah; You’ve got to try/try on . . .)
 É só experimentar. (eh soh eh-speh-dee-mehn-
tah; It won’t hurt just to try it/try it on. Literally:
It’s just trying.)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
100
After you leave the provador (pdoh-vah-doh; dressing
room), the salesperson may ask you Quer levar? (keh
leh-vah; Would you like to get it?). Here are some
answers:
 Vou levar. (voh leh-vah; I’ll take it.)
 Não, não vou levar, mas obrigado/a. (nah-ooh,
nah-ooh voh leh-vah, mah-eez oh-bdee-gah-doh/
ah; No, I’m not going to get it, but thanks.)
Here’s a conversation you might have with a 
salesperson:
Dudu: Gosto muito desses. (goh-stoo moh-ee-too
deh-seez; I really like these.)
Salesperson: São bonitos. Quer experimentar?
(sah-ooh boo-nee-tooz. keh eh-speh-dee-mehn-
tah; They’re nice. Do you want to try them on?)
Dudu: Posso? (poh-soo; Can I?)
Salesperson: Claro. (klah-doo; Of course.)
Dudu: Obrigado. São muito legais. (oh-bdee-gah-
doh. sah-ooh moh-ee-toh lay-gah-eez. Thanks.
They’re really cool.)
Salesperson: Estou vendendo muito desse
modelo. (eh-stoh vehn-dehn-doh moh-ee-too
deh-see moh-deh-loo; I’m selling a lot of that
type.)
Dudu: Quanto custam? (kwahn-toh koo-stah-ooh;
How much do they cost?)
Salesperson: São oito reais. Quer levar? (sah-
ooh oh-ee-toh heh-eyes. keh leh-vah; Eight reais.
You wanna take them?)
Dudu: Vou, sim. Tem troco para dez reais? (voh
sing. tang tdoh-koo pah-dah dehz heh-eyes; Yeah.
Do you have change for ten reais?)

The verb gostar (goh-stah; to like) is always
followed by de (jee), which means “of.” But
in English, saying something like “I like of
these” just sounds weird, so when you trans-
late Gostar desses (I like these) to English,
just leave out the of.
Exploring Brazilian Treasures
Brazilian mercados (meh-kah-dooz; markets) have
plenty of artesanato (ah-teh-zah-nah-toh; handicrafts)
that you may want as lembranças (lehm-bdahn-sahz;
souvenirs), such as redes (heh-jeez; hammocks) and
berimbaus (beh-deem-bah-ooz; musical instruments
from the state of Bahia).
Also in Bahia are the famous colorful fitas de
Bonfim (fee-tahz jee boh-oong-feeng; ribbons
of Bonfim). These ribbons, which have reli-
gious sayings on them, come from a church
called Bonfim in the city of Salvador. When
you buy a fita, the seller ties it around your
wrist and tells you to make a wish. The vendor

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
102
then warns you nunca (noon-kah; never) to
take it off; otherwise, you’ll be cursed with má
sorte (mah soh-chee; bad luck). On the upside,
if you let it disintegrate naturally, they say the
wish you made will come true!
Check out some other classic Brazilian souvenirs:
 uma pintura (ooh-mah peen-too-dah; a painting)
 um biquíni (oohng bee-kee-nee; a bikini)
 bijuteria (bee-zhoo-teh-dee-ah; jewelry)
 anéis (ah-nay-eez; rings)
 brincos (bdeeng-kohz; earrings)
 colares (koh-lah-deez; necklaces)
 uma canga com a bandeira brasileira (ooh-mah
kahn-gah kohng ah bahn-day-dah bdah-zee-lay-

printed with the Brazilian flag)
 música brasileira (moo-zee-kah bdah-zee-lay-

tribes)
 pó de guaraná (poh jee gwah-dah-nah; guarana

energy drink)
 uma camiseta de um time de futebol (ooh-mah

In Brazil, you may find tons of knickknacks made from
 barro (bah-hoh; clay)
 madeira (mah-day-dah; wood)
 pedra (peh-drah; stone)
 palha (pahl-yah; straw)
 cerâmica (seh-dah-mee-kah; ceramics)

Chapter 6: Shop ’Til You Drop 103
 vidro (vee-droh; glass)
 semente (seh-mehn-chee; seeds)
 renda (hehn-dah; crocheted yarn)
If you want to know whether the item is handmade,
ask whether it’s feito à mão (fay-toh ah mah-ooh). If
it’s food, the term for homemade is caseiro (kah-zay-
doh) — which comes from the word casa (kah-zah;
house).
Shopping for Food and
Necessities at the Market
Brazilians shop at supermercados (soo-peh-meh-kah-
dooz; supermarkets), but they also love to buy frutas
(fdoo-tahz; fruits) and legumes e verduras (leh-goo-
meez ee veh-doo-dahz; vegetables) at feirinhas (fay-
deen-yahz; outdoor markets), where the food is
usually mais barato (may-eez bah-dah-toh; cheaper)
and melhor (mehl-yoh; better).
Getting some practical items
Here are some items you can buy at a supermercado
(soo-peh-meh-kah-doo; supermarket), besides comida
(koh-mee-dah; food):

toilet paper)
 produtos de limpeza (pdoh-doo-tohz jee leem-
peh-zah; cleaning products)
 latas de legumes (lah-tahz jee leh-goo-meez;

Shopping at the outdoor market
Now check out the feirinha (fay-deen-yah; outdoor
market). Here are some typical verduras (veh-dooh-
dahz; leafy veggies) and legumes (leh-goo-meez; veg-
gies that grow underground) you can find:
 batatas (bah-tah-tahz; potatoes)
 couve (koh-ooh-vee; bitter greens — necessary
to make feijoada [fay-zhoh-ah-dah; bean/pig-
parts stew]; the couve is fried with garlic and
eaten on the side)
 coentro (koh-ehn-tdoh; cilantro)
 salsinha (sah-ooh-seen-yah; parsley)
 feijão (fay-zhow; beans)

 espinafre (ehs-pee-nah-fdee; spinach)
 repolho (heh-pol-yoh; cabbage)
 berinjela (beh-dang-zheh-lah; eggplant)
 abóbora (ah-boh-boh-dah; pumpkin)

Chapter 6: Shop ’Til You Drop 105
Here are some types of fish and meat:
 peixe (pay-shee; fish)
 frutos do mar (fdoo-tohz doo mah; shellfish.
Literally: fruits of the sea)
 atum (ah-toong; tuna)
 salmão (sah-ooh-mah-ooh; salmon)
 camarões (kah-mah-doh-eez; shrimp)
 caranguejo (kahn-gdeh-zhoh; crab)
 lula (loo-lah; squid)
 polvo (pohl-voh; octopus)
 cortes de carne (koh-cheez jee kah-nee; cuts of

 carne moída (kah-nee moh-ee-dah; ground beef)
 aves (ah-veez; poultry)
 frango sem osso (fdahn-goh sang oh-soo; 
boneless chicken)
 frango com osso (fdahn-goh koh-oong oh-soo;
boned chicken)
Sometimes the butcher asks whether you want your
meat de primeira ou de segunda (jee pdee-may-dah
ooh jee seh-goon-dah; Grade A or Grade B).
Making Comparisons and
Expressing Opinions
If you’re shopping with an amigo (ah-mee-goh; friend),
you may want to share your opinião (oh-pee-nee-ah-
ooh; opinion) about the things in the loja (loh-zhah;
shop).
If you think something is so-so, you can say:
 Gosto. (gohs-too; I like it.)
 Está bem. (eh-stah bang; It’s okay.)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
106
 Nao está mau. (nah-ooh eh-stah mah-ooh; It’s
not bad.)
Then if you see something that you like even more,
you can say:
 Este é melhor. (ehs-chee eh meh-ooh-yoh; This
one’s better.)
 Este eu gosto mais. (ehs-chee ee-ooh goh-stoo
mah-eez; I like this one more.)
 É bem bonito este. (eh bang boo-nee-too ehs-
chee; This one’s really nice.)
When you see the best one, you can say:
 Este é o melhor. (ehs-chee eh ooh meh-ooh-yoh;
This one’s the best.)
 É perfeito este. (eh peh-fay-toh esh-chee; This
one’s perfect.)
Better is melhor (meh-ooh-yoh), and the best
is o melhor (ooh meh-ooh-yoh).
Now comes the fun part. In Portuguese, adding the
ending -ísimo/a or -érrimo/a to the end of some adjec-
tives exaggerates whatever’s being said. Something
that’s nice but not really caro (kah-doh; expensive) is
suddenly chiquérrimo (shee-keh-hee-moh; really
glamorous). Here are some common expressions you
can use while shopping:
 Chiquérrimo! (shee-keh-hee-moh! Really 
glamorous/expensive-looking! — from the word
chique)
 Caríssimo! (kah-dee-see-moh; So expensive! —
from the word caro)
Paying for Your Purchases
Here are three of the more common ways of asking
how much something is:

Chapter 6: Shop ’Til You Drop 107
 Quanto vale? (kwahn-toh vah-lee; How much
does it cost? Literally: How much is it worth?)
 Quanto custa? (kwahn-toh koo-stah; How much
does it cost?)
 Quanto é? (kwahn-toh eh; How much is it?)
Here’s how the vendor usually answers:
 Vale . . . reais. (vah-lee . . . heh-eyez; It costs . . .
[number] reais.)
 Custa . . . reais. (koos-tah . . . heh-eyez; It 
costs . . . [number] reais.)
 São . . . reais. (sah-ooh . . . heh-eyez; It costs . . .
[number] reais.)
Luckily, when you pagar (pah-gah; pay), visible
números (noo-meh-dohz) are often involved. At a nice
shop or supermarket, you’ll be seeing the number
pop up on a cash register. That makes communication
a little easier. If you’re having problems communicat-
ing at an informal, outdoor market (where you often
won’t find even a calculator), you can always pull out
a pen and paper to clear things up.
Here are some other helpful uses of pagar:
 Quer pagar agora ou depois? (keh pah-gah ah-
goh-dah ooh deh-poh-eez; Do you want to pay
now or later?)
 Já pagou? (zhah pah-goh; Did you pay already?)
 Paguei vinte reais. (pah-gay veen-chee heh-
eyez; I paid 20 reais.)
 Vão pagar a conta. (vah-ooh pah-gah ah kohn-
tah; They will pay the bill.)
These phrases may come in handy when you’re at the
caixa (kah-ee-shah; register):
 Tem desconto para estudantes? (tang dehs-
kohn-toh pah-dah eh-stoo-dahn-cheez; Do you
have a student discount?)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
108
 Tem caneta? (tang kah-neh-tah; Do you have a
pen?)
 Me dá um recibo, por favor? (mee dah oong
heh-see-boh poh fah-voh; Can you give me a
receipt, please?)
The vendor may ask you:
 Tem algum documento? Um passaporte? (tang
ah-ooh-goong doh-koo-mehn-toh oong pah-sah-
poh-chee; Do you have some I.D.? A passport?)
 Qual é a validade do cartão? (kwah-ooh eh ah
vah-lee-dah-jee doo kah-tah-ooh; What’s the
expiration on the card?)
As a rule of thumb, you can bargain in Brazil in out-
door mercados (meh-kah-dooz; markets) but not
inside lojas (loh-zhahz; stores). At feirinhas (fay-deen-
yahz; outdoor food markets), most locals don’t bar-
gain, though you can always try — it won’t be
considered offensive.
Start out by asking how much something costs, and
then offer a lower price or tell the vendor you have
only a certain amount of money:
 Quanto custa? (kwahn-toh koo-stah; How much
does it cost?)
 Quanto é? (kwahn-toh eh; How much is it?)
 Posso pagar . . . reais? (pah-sooh pah-gah . . .
heh-eyez; Can I pay . . . [number] reais?)
 Só tenho vinte reais. (soh tang-yoh veen-chee
heh-eyez; I have only twenty reais.)
You can then accept the price the vendor gives you or
make a final offer.
Of course, if you tell the vendor you only
have 15 reais, you probably don’t want to
pay with a 20-real bill. Separate the bills you
want to use to pay for the item before
approaching the stall.

razil is probably most famous for its praias
(pdah-ee-ahz; beaches) and Carnaval (kah-nah-
vah-ooh). But that’s not all that Brazilian culture is.
The country has fabulous museus (moo-zay-ooz;
museums), a vibrant arts scene, and música ao vivo
(moo-zee-kah ah-ooh vee-voo; live music).
This chapter tells you what you need to know to
explore and appreciate the art and culture of Brazil
and to enjoy yourself as much as any Brazilian.

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
110
Talking about Going Out
Tem vontade de sair? (tang vohn-tah-jee jee sah-eeh;
Are you in the mood to go out?).
Whether you’re itching for música ao vivo (moo-zee-
kah ah-ooh vee-voo; live music) or something else,
you can use the following phrase to ask locals what
you can do around town: O que recomenda para
fazer hoje à noite? (ooh keh heh-koh-mehn-dah pah-
dah fah-zeh oh-zhee ah noh-ee-chee; What do you rec-
ommend doing tonight?).
The locals will probably then ask you De/do que você
gosta? (jee/dooh keh voh-seh goh-stah; What do you
like?). You can respond Gosto de . . . (goh-stoh jee;
I like . . .)
 bares (bah-deez; bars)
 boates (boh-ah-cheez; nightclubs)
 espetáculos (eh-speh-tah-koo-lohz; shows)
 eventos culturais (eh-vehn-tohz kool-too-dah-
eez; cultural events)
 cinema (see-neh-mah; cinema)
 teatro (chee-ah-tdoh; theater)
 festas (fehs-tahz; parties)
If you’re new in town and just want to ask
how to get to the centro (sehn-tdoh; down-
town), say Onde fica o centro? (ohn-jee fee-
kah ooh sehn-tdoh; Where’s the downtown
area?).
Inviting someone and being invited
If you want to invite someone out on the town with
you, you can say one of the following:
 Quer ir comigo? (keh ee koh-mee-goh; Do you
want to go with me?)

Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 111
 Quer vir conosco? (keh vee koh-noh-skoh; 
Do you want to come with us?)
 Quero te convidar. (keh-doo chee kohn-vee-dah;
I want to invite you.)
 Estou te convidando! (eh-stoh chee kohn-vee-
dahn-doh; I’m inviting you!)
 Vem conosco! (vang koh-noh-skoh; Come 
with us!)
 Vem comigo! (vang koh-mee-goh; Come 
with me!)
Here are some more-specific examples of common
expressions using convidar (kohn-vee-dah; to invite):
 Quero convidar a todos para a minha casa.
(keh-doo kohn-vee-dah ah toh-dooz pah-dah ah
meen-yah kah-zah; I want to invite everyone to
my house.)
 Estão convidando a gente para ir à praia. (eh-
stah-ooh kohn-vee-dahn-doh ah zhang-chee pah-
dah eeh ah pdah-ee-ah; They’re inviting us to go
to the beach.)
Brazilians often say a gente (ah zhang-chee)
rather than nós (nohz) to mean “we” or “us.”
A gente literally means “the people.” Strange
but true, and fun to say.
Asking what the place or event is like
To get more details about an evento (eh-vehn-toh;
event) or lugar (loo-gah; place), you may want to ask
for mais detalhes (mah-eez deh-tahl-yeez; more
details). Here are the what, when, how, where, and
why questions:
 Como é o lugar? (koh-moh eh ooh loo-gah;
What’s the place like?)
 Quando começa? (kwahn-doh koh-meh-sah;
When does it start?)
 Onde fica? (ohn-jee fee-kah; Where is it?)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
112
 Tem algum motivo? (tang ah-ooh-goong moh-
chee-voh; Why is it being put on?)
 O que é, exatamente? (ooh kee eh, eh-zah-tah-
mehn-chee; What is it, exactly?)
And check out some additional phrases that can give
you even more clues about what to do:
 Custa caro? (koo-stah kah-doh; Is it expensive?)
 Vai ter muitas pessoas? (vah-ee teh moh-ee-tahz
peh-soh-ahz; Will there be a lot of people?)
 Que tipo de música vai ter? (kee chee-poh jee
moo-zee-kah vah-ee teh; What type of music will
there be?)
 Que tipo de gente? (kee chee-poh jee zhang-
chee; What type of people?)
 É informal ou formal? (eh een-foh-mah-ooh ooh
foh-mah-ooh; Is it informal or formal?)
 Vale a pena ir? (vah-lee ah peh-nah ee; Is it
worth going to?)
Here are some answers you’re likely to get about an
event:
 Não custa caro. (nah-ooh koo-stah kah-doh; It’s
not expensive.)
 Vai ser muito bom. (vah-ee seh moh-ee-toh boh-
oong; It’s going to be really good.)
 Vale a pena. (vah-lee ah peh-nah; It’s worth
going to.)
 Deve ter bastante gente. (deh-vee teh bah-stahn-
chee zhang-chee; There should be a lot of
people.)
 O lugar é pequeno. (ooh loo-gah eh peh-keh-
noh; The place is small.)
 É muito jovem. (eh moh-ee-toh zhoh-vang; It’s
really young.)

Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 113
 É para todas as idades. (eh pah-dah toh-dahz
ahz ee-dah-jeez; It’s for all ages.)
 É um bar gay. (eh oong bah gay; It’s a gay bar.)
You will also hear a “gay” place described as GLS (zeh
eh-lee eh-see), or gay, lésbicas e simpatizantes (gay,
lehz-bee-kahs ee seem-pah-chee-zahn-cheez; gay, les-
bian, and those sympathetic). Brazilians say both
“gay” and “GLS.”
Two other important questions to ask in
Brazil about bars or events is whether
there’s an entrada (ehn-tdah-dah; cover
charge) and whether the place has a con-
sumação mínima (kohn-soo-mah-sah-ooh
mee-nee-mah; dollar-amount minimum),
meaning you’d perhaps have to consume at
least $10, say, in drinks or food. Ask Tem
entrada? (tang ehn-tdah-dah; Does it have a
cover charge?) or Tem consumação mínima?
(tang kohn-soo-mah-sah-ooh mee-nee-mah; Is
there a minimum?).
Asking People What 
They Like to Do
As you make friends, you want to know what hobbies
or interests you have in common. Just say Você gosta
de . . . ? (voh-seh goh-stah jee; Do you like . . . ?) and
then add in the activity, like this:
 Você gosta de surfar? (voh-seh goh-stah jee soo-
fah; Do you like to surf?)
 Você gosta de ir à academia? (voh-seh goh-stah
jee ee ah ah-kah-deh-mee-ah; Do you like to go
to the gym?)
 Você gosta de correr? (voh-seh goh-stah jee
koh-heh; Do you like to go running?)
 Você gosta de jogar futebol? (voh-seh goh-stah
jee zhoh-gah foo-chee-bah-ooh; Do you like to
play soccer?)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
114
If someone asks you one of these questions, you can
answer Sim, gosto (sing goh-stoo; Yeah, I like it) or
Não, não gosto (nah-ooh, nah-ooh goh-stoo; No, I
don’t like it).
You can use the você gosta de . . . formula for a ton of
fun activities, like these:
 Você gosta de viajar? (voh-seh goh-stah jee vee-
ah-zhah; Do you like to travel?) 
 Você gosta de ir ao cinema? (voh-seh goh-stah
jee ee ah-ooh see-neh-mah; Do you like to go to
the movies?)
 Você gosta de praticar o seu inglês? (voh-seh
goh-stah jee pdah-chee-kah ooh seh-ooh eeng-
glehz; Do you like practicing your English?)
 Você gosta de cozinhar? (voh-seh goh-stah jee
koh-zeeng-yah; Do you like to cook?)
Expressing your most passionate feelings in
another language is always difficult. But here
are a couple of easy tricks: To say you love
doing something, use Eu adoro . . . (eh-ooh
ah-doh-doo; I love . . .). If you hate it, say Eu
detesto . . . (eh-ooh deh-tehs-toh; I hate . . .).
Taking in Brazil’s 
Musical Culture
The one thing you shouldn’t miss doing in Brazil de
noite (jee noh-ee-chee; at night) is listening to música
ao vivo (moo-zee-kah ah-ooh vee-voh; live music). Or
pick up an instrument and play yourself!
Playing an instrument
Você toca algum instrumento? (voh-seh toh-kah ah-
ooh-goong een-stdoo-mehn-toh; Do you play an instru-
ment?). In Brazil, the violão (vee-ooh-lah-ooh; guitar)
is by far the most common instrument played. But
Brazilians appreciate all kinds of music, and anything

Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 115
having to do with music is a great conversation
starter.
Take a glance at some names of instruments in
Portuguese:
 o violão (ooh vee-ooh-lah-ooh; acoustic guitar)
 a guitarra (ah gee-tah-hah; electric guitar)
 a bateria (ah bah-teh-dee-ah; drums)
 o baixo (ooh bah-ee-shoh; bass guitar)
 a flauta (ah flah-ooh-tah; flute)
 o piano (ooh pee-ah-noh; piano)
 o violino (ooh vee-oh-lee-noh; violin)
Now for the Brazilian instruments. Perhaps hundreds
of instruments are specific to Brazil and Brazilian
music. Music is Brazilians’ artistic specialty, after all.
Here are some of the most famous ones:
 a cuíca (ah kwee-kah; a stick that’s rubbed
through what looks like a small drum — it
makes a donkey hee-haw or whine, depending
on how it’s moved)
 o berimbau (ooh beh-deem-bah-ooh; a large
bow that’s played with a wooden stick — it’s
used to accompany the Brazilian martial arts
form capoeira [kay-poh-ay-dah])
 o paxixi (ooh pah-shee-shee; a woven rattle)
 o cavaquinho (ooh kah-vah-keen-yoh; an instru-
ment similar to a ukulele — it’s used in bands
that play forró music, which originates in the
northeast and sounds similar to country)
 o pandeiro (ooh pahn-day-doh; a tambourine)
 a sanfona (ah sahn-foh-nah; an accordion —
used for forró music)
And here are some phrases about playing these
instruments:

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
116
 Eu toco piano. (eh-ooh toh-koo pee-ah-noh; I
play the piano.)
 Ela toco bateria. (eh-lah toh-kah bah-teh-dee-ah;
She plays the drums.)
 Eles tocam violão. (eh-leez toh-kah-ooh vee-oh-
lah-ooh; They play the guitar.)
Brazilians use the guitar as the model of the
ideal woman’s body. English-speakers say
“hourglass figure”; Brazilians say corpo de
violão (koh-poo jee vee-ooh-lah-ooh; guitar-
shaped body).
Dancing around and singing out loud
Especially if you’re solteiro (sohl-tay-doh; a single
person), you’ll probably want to learn how to ask
someone to dançar (dahn-sah; dance) and how you’ll
be asked to dançar.
Couple-dancing is very common in Brazil. The most
popular form is probably forró (foh-hah), a fast-paced
country-sounding music and accompanying dance
form that originates in the northeast. Samba (sahm-
bah), the best-known music and dance from Brazil, is
generally not for casais (kah-zah-eez; couples), at
least during festivals. You dance sozinho (soh-zeen-
yoh; alone).
Here are some common expressions that use dançar:
 Vamos dançar? (vah-mohz dahn-sah; Shall we
dance?)
 Quer dançar comigo? (keh dahn-sah koh-mee-
goh; Do you want to dance with me?)
 Não sei dançar. (nah-ooh say dahn-sah; I don’t
know how to dance.)
Você gosta de cantar? (voh-seh goh-stah jee kahn-tah;
Do you like to sing?). Here are some ways you can use
cantar:

Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 117
 Ela canta super bem. (eh-lah kahn-tah soo-peh
bang; She sings really well.)
 Eu não canto muito bem. (eh-ooh nah-ooh
kahn-toh moh-ee-toh bang; I don’t sing very
well.)
 Você canta? Não sabia. (voh-seh kahn-tah nah-
ooh sah-bee-ah; You sing? I didn’t know.)
 Nós cantamos no chuveiro. (nohz kahn-tah-
mohz noh shoo-vay-doh; We sing in the shower.)
Exploring Carnaval in Brazil
Brazil is world-famous for its Carnaval (kah-nah-vah-
ooh; Carnival). The festivities take place usually in
fevereiro (feh-veh-day-doh; February) or março (mah-
soo; March), when the weather is hot in Brazil, for the
four days preceding Quarta-feira de Cinzas (kwah-
tah-fay-dah jee seen-zahz; Ash Wednesday).
Every Brazilian has a different opinion on which
Carnaval is best. Here are some questions you can ask
a Brazilian to help you decide which Carnaval is right
for you:
 Qual Carnaval no Brasil você acha melhor?
(kwah-ooh kah-nah-vah-ooh noh bdah-zee-ooh
ah-shah mel-yoh; Which Carnaval in Brazil do
you think is best?)
 Qual é o mais divertido? (kwah-ooh eh ooh
mah-eez jee-veh-chee-doo; Which one is the
most fun?)
 Qual tem o melhor show? (kwah-ooh tang ah
mel-yoh shoh; Which one has the best show?)
 Qual tem o melhor carnaval de rua? (kwah-
ooh tang oh mel-yoh kah-nah-vah-ooh jee hoo-ah;
Which one has the best street carnival?)
 Já esteve no Carnaval de . . . ? (zhah eh-steh-
vee noo kah-nah-vah-ooh jee; Have you been to
the Carnaval in . . . ?)

Exploring Art Galleries 
and Museums
Brazil has plenty of galerias de arte (gah-leh-dee-ahz
jee ah-chee; art galleries), centros culturais (sehn-
tdohz kool-too-dah-eez; cultural centers), and museus
(moo-zeh-oohz; museums). The biggest and most
famous ones are in some of the country’s largest
cities: São Paulo, Brasilia, and Rio.
Here are some things you’ll find in a gallery or
museum:
 exibições temporárias (eggs-ee-bee-soy-eez
temp-oh-dah-dee-ahz; temporary exhibitions)
 quadros (kwah-drohz; paintings)
 esculturas (eh-skool-too-dahz; sculptures)
 fotografias (foh-toh-gdah-fee-ahz; photographs)
 objetos históricos (ohb-zheh-tohz ee-stoh-dee-
kohz; historic objects)
Check out some phrases that deal with a arte (ah ah-
chee; art):
 Você gosta de arte? (voh-seh goh-stah jee ah-
chee; Do you like art?)
 Tem uma exibição muito boa no Itaú Cultural.
(tang ooh-mah eggs-ee-bee-sah-ooh moh-ee-toh
boh-ah noh ee-tah-ooh kool-too-dah-ooh; There’s
a really good exhibition at Itaú Cultural Center.)
 Tem uns quadros famosos do Picasso naquele

There are some famous Picasso paintings in that
museum.)
 Eu adoro as vernissages. (ee-ooh ah-doh-doo
ahz veh-nee-sah-zhehz; I love art exhibition
opening nights.)

Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 119
Going to the Movies
What type of filmes (fee-ooh-meez; movies) do you
like? Have you ever seen um filme brasileiro (oong
fee-ooh-mee bdah-zee-lay-doh; a Brazilian movie)? You
may be surprised to find out that the Brazilian indús-
tria de filmes (een-doo-stee-ah jee fee-ooh-meez; film
industry) is very large and of high quality.
At most salas de cinema (sah-lahz jee see-neh-mah;
movie theaters) in Brazil, about half of the filmes
playing are Brazilian — several filmes novos (fee-ooh-
meez noh-vooz; new films) come out every month.
You may want to ask whether the movie is legendado
(leh-zhang-dah-doo; subtitled) or dublado (doo-blah-
doo; dubbed over). Subtitled films are also sometimes
referred to as versão original (veh-sah-ooh oh-dee-
zhee-nah-ooh; original version).
Here are some handy phrases you can use to talk
about filmes:
 Vamos ao cinema? (vah-mohz ah-ooh see-neh-
mah; Do you want to go to the movies?)
 Quer assistir um filme? (keh ah-sees-chee oong
fee-ooh-mee; Do you want to see a movie?)
 De que tipo de filmes gosta? (Jee kee chee-poh

 Estou com vontade de assistir uma comédia.
(eh-stoh koh-oong vohn-tah-jee jee ah-sees-chee
ooh-mah koh-meh-jah; I feel like seeing a
comedy.)
 Você espera na fila, e eu compro a pipoca.
(voh-seh eh-speh-dah nah fee-lah, ee eh-ooh

and I’ll buy the popcorn.)

Names of non-Brazilian filmes, like American
or European ones, are often translated
slightly differently into Portuguese — and
often with a funny result. My favorite is the
movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000),
which was translated as E Aí, Irmão, Cadê
Você? (ee ah-ee eeh-mah-ooh kah-deh voh-
seh; Hey, Dude, Where Are You?).
Hanging Out at the Beach
Most of Brazil’s population is concentrated near its
litoral (lee-toh-dah-oo; coastline), making praias
(pdah-ee-ahz; beaches) a focus of daily life for many
locals.

Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 121
It’s an opportunity to sip água de coco (ah-gwah jee
koh-koh; coconut water, sipped through a straw, out
of a green coconut) or drink a cerveja (seh-veh-zhah;
beer) with old friends and a chance to make new
acquaintances, too. At urban beaches, you may see
many people fazendo cooper (fah-zen-doh koo-peh;
jogging) on the beachfront avenue and some surfistas
(soo-fee-stahs; surfers).
What to take to the beach
It’s a myth that all Brazilian mulheres (moo-yeh-deez;
women) wear itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny, thong bikini
bottoms. In Portuguese, thong bikini bottoms are
called fio dental (fee-oh dang-tah-ooh; dental floss) —
Brazilians always have a sense of humor. It is true,
however, that the average top and bottom parts of
a Brazilian biquíni (bee-kee-nee; bikini) are menor
(meh-noh; smaller) than the average American or
European bikini.
Here are some items that you’re sure to see people
wearing on a beach:
 sungas (soong-gahz; Speedo-style swim trunks)
 bermudas (beh-moo-dahz; longer, American-
style swimming shorts — Bermuda shorts)
 chinelos (shee-neh-looz; flip-flops)
 toalha (toe-ahl-yah; towel)
 canga (kang-gah; sarong to sit down on)
 óculos de sol (oh-koo-lohz jee soh-oo; sun-
glasses)
 protetor solar (pdoh-teh-toh soh-lah; sunblock)
Check out what else you will find on a beach:
 barraca (bah-hah-kah; beach shack that serves
food/drinks)
 areia (ah-day-ah; sand)
 frescobol (fdeh-skoo-bah-ooh; beach ping-pong)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
122
 crianças (kdee-ahn-sahz; kids)
 livros (leev-dohz; books)
 pescadores (pehs-kah-doh-deez; fishermen)
 futebol (foo-chee-bah-ooh; soccer)
 vôlei (voh-lay; volleyball)
 cadeira de praia (kah-deh-dah jee pdah-ee-ah;
beach chair)
 sombrinha (sohm-bdeen-yah; beach umbrella.
Literally: little shade)
 prancha de surf (pdahn-shah jee sooh-fee; 
surfboard)
You can also buy snacks, which generally cost um
real (oong heh-ah-ooh; one Brazilian real, or about 
35 cents). People walk by, shouting Um real! Um real!
with the name of the food they’re selling. Typical
beach snack food includes
 queijo coalho (kay-zhoh koh-ahl-yoh; barbe-
qued cheese cubes)
 um espeto de carne (oong eh-speh-toh jee kah-
nee; a beef shish kabob)
 amendoim (ah-mang-doh-eeng; peanuts)
 picolé (pee-koh-leh; fruity popsicles)
Here’s a conversation you might have when getting
ready for the beach:
Paula: Temos protetor solar? (teh-mohz pdoh-
teh-toh soh-lah? Do we have sunblock?)
Rogério: Sim, mas só fator oito. Tá bom para ti
(ok)? (sing, maz soh fah-toh oh-ee-toh. tah boh-

that okay for you?)
Paula: Sim, tá bom. Eu estou com uma canga,

(oh-chee-moh. ah-goh-dah soh keh-doo ooh-mah

Talking about beach safety
Beaches are for relaxing. But before settling into your
chair and making grooves into the sand, it’s always
best to ask some basic perguntas (peh-goon-tahz;
questions) that concern your segurança (seh-goo-
dahn-sah; safety). Check out some useful phrases
about beach safety:

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
124
 Tem ladrão aqui? (tang lah-drah-ooh ah-kee; Are
there pickpockets around here?)
 É perigosa a ressaca aqui? (eh peh-dee-goh-zoo
ah heh-sah-kah ah-kee; Is the undercurrent
strong here?)
 Tem salva-vida aqui? (tang sah-oo-vah vee-dah

 Tem tubarão aqui? (tang too-bah-dah-ooh ah-

 A praia tem pedras? (ah pdah-ee-ah tang peh-
drahz; Is the beach rocky?)
And here are some responses you may get:
 Sim, é perigoso. (sing eh peh-dee-goh-zoo; Yes,
it’s dangerous.)
 Sim, cuidado. (sing, kwee-dah-doh; Yes, be 
careful/watch out.)
 Não se preocupe. (nah-ooh see pdeh-oh-koo-

 Não, é tranqüilo. (nah-ooh eh tdahn-kwee-loo;

Yell Socorro! (soh-koh-hoo; Help!) if you’re in
immediate danger.
On urban beaches, flags stuck in the sand often say
Perigoso (peh-dee-goh-zoo; Dangerous) to alert you
that entering the water is unsafe.
Expressing beauty: “It’s so beautiful!”
All beaches have a unique beauty, of course. Check
out some phrases you can use to talk about how
pretty a beach is:
 Que bonita! (kee boh-nee-tah; How pretty!)
 É maravilhosa! (eh mah-dah-vee-lee-oh-zah; It’s
amazing!)

Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 125
 Incrível! (eeng-kdee-veh-ooh; Unbelievable!)
 Nossa senhora! (noh-sah seen-yoh-dah; Wow!)
 Que legal! (kee leh-gah-ooh; How cool!)
 Meu Deus! (meh-oo deh-ooz; Oh my God!)
 Não acredito! (nah-ooh ah-kdeh-jee-toh; I can’t
believe it!)
Nossa senhora! literally means “Our lady”
and would be the English equivalent of
saying, “Holy Mary, mother of God!” It’s very
common in Brazil, and people often just say
Nossa!
Getting Out for a Walk 
(or a Hike)
Taking uma caminhada (ooh-mah kah-meen-yah-dah;
a walk) along the beira-mar (bay-dah-mah; seashore)
is one of life’s simple pleasures. In Brazil, you’ll see
many people walking along the beach — in order to
se divertir (see jee-veh-chee; enjoy themselves), to
observar as pessoas (ohb-seh-vah ahz peh-soh-az;
people-watch), and for exercício (eh-seh-see-see-ooh;
exercise).
On praias urbanas (pdah-ee-ahz ooh-bahn-az; urban
beaches), people especially like to walk on the
calçadão (cow-sah-dah-ooh; broad beachfront side-
walk). In Rio, the sidewalks have a famous black-and-
white pattern that look like ondas (ohn-dahz; waves).
In Brazil’s rain forests and mata atlântica (mah-tah
aht-lahn-chee-kah; jungle regions near the coast, in
southeast Brazil) people like fazer trilha (fah-zeh
tdeel-yah; to hike).
These phrases can help you talk about walking:

Playing Soccer — Brazil’s
National Pastime
Futebol (foo-chee-bah-ooh; soccer) is a very impor-
tant topic in Brazil — probably even more important
than religião (heh-lee-zhee-ah-ooh; religion). The
fastest way to make an amigo (ah-mee-goo; friend) —
whether it be a Brazilian man or a woman — is to
share the same favorite Brazilian soccer team.
Most of Brazil’s famous soccer teams are in Rio or São
Paulo. Here’s a quick rundown of the teams and
which cities they’re based in:
 Flamengo (flah-mang-goh): city of Rio
 Botafogo (boh-tah-foh-goh): city of Rio
 São Paulo (sah-ooh pah-oo-loh): city of São
Paulo
 Corinthians (koh-deen-chee-ahnz): city of São
Paulo
 Santos (sahn-tohz): beach city in São Paulo 
state — claim to fame is being Pelé’s first profes-
sional team
Besides soccer, there are a few other sports that
Brazilians like as well:
 basquete (bahs-keh-chee; basketball)
 tênis (teh-neez; tennis)
 vôlei (voh-lay; volleyball)
 surfe (sooh-fee; surfing)
 natação (nah-tah-sah-oong; swimming)
 cooper (koo-peh; jogging)
Check out some words that relate to all forms of exer-
cise and recreation. All lead to boa saúde (boh-ah sah-
ooh-jee; good health):

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
128
 academia (ah-kah-deh-mee-ah; gym)
 levantar pesos (leh-vahn-tah peh-zohz; to lift
weights)
 buggy (boo-gee; sand-dune buggy — common in
northeastern Brazil)
 jangada (zhahng-gah-dah; tiny sailboat —
common in northeastern Brazil)
 ir de barco (ee jee bah-koh; to take a boat ride)
 fazer snorkeling (fah-zeh snoh-keh-ooh-leeng; to
snorkel)
 fazer mergulho (fah-zeh meh-gool-yoh; to scuba
dive)
 escalada em rocha (ehs-kah-lah-dah ang hoh-
shah; rock climbing)
 ir de bicicleta (eed jee bee-see-kleh-tah; to go
bicycling)
There are a number of places to do esportes
radicais (eh-spoh-cheez hah-jee-kah-eez;
extreme sports) in Brazil. You can voar de
asa delta (voh-ah jee ah-zah deh-ooh-tah; go
hang gliding) in Rio, over Ipanema beach.
Falling in Love — in Portuguese
Brazilian Portuguese is an extremely romantic
language — not only are the sounds beautiful and
melodic, but Brazilians themselves are very românti-
cos (hoh-mahn-chee-kooz; romantic). And you can’t
separate the língua (ling-gwah; language) from its cul-
tura (kool-too-dah; culture). The language está cheia
de poesia (eh-stah shay-ah jee poh-eh-zee-ah; is full of
poetry).
Brazilians even have a specific verb to describe the
act of smooching about town with your honey:
namorar (nah-moh-dah). The root of the verb is amor.
What did Jaqueline (zhah-keh-lee-nee) do Saturday?

Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 129
Ela foi namorar (eh-lah foh-ee nah-moh-dah; She hung
out with her boyfriend).
Girlfriend, by the way, is namorada (nah-moh-dah-
dah), and boyfriend is namorado (nah-moh-dah-doo).
After things move along and the happy couple has a
casamento (kah-zah-men-toh; wedding), they become
husband and wife — marido e mulher (mah-dee-doo
ee mool-yeh).
Check out some classic romantic phrases in
Portuguese:
 Eu te amo. (eh-ooh chee ah-moo; I love you.)
 Voce se casaria comigo? (voh-seh see kah-zah-
dee-ah koh-mee-goo; Will you marry me?)
 Eu estou apaixonado/a. (eh-ooh eh-stoh ah-pah-
ee-shee-ooh-nah-doo/dah; I’m in love.)
 Estou com muita saudade de você. (eh-stoh
kohng moh-ee-tah sah-ooh-dah-jee jee voh-seh;
I miss you very much.)
 Me dá um beijo. (mee dah oong bay-zhoh; Give
me a kiss.)
 Eu vou te amar por toda a minha vida. (eh-ooh
voh chee ah-mah poh toh-dah ah ming-yah vee-
dah; I’m going to love you for the rest of my
life.)
And here’s how Brazilians say sweet nothings:
 o meu amor (ooh meh-ooh ah-moh; my love)
 o meu querido/a minha querida (ooh meh-ooh
keh-dee-doo/ah ming-yah keh-dee-dah; my
honey. Literally: my loved one)
 o meu fofinho/a minha fofinha (ooh meh-ooh
foh-fing-yoh/ah ming-yah foh-fing-yah; my
sweetie. Literally: my soft, fluffy one)
Here are some classic romantic phrases that
Brazilians use to paquerar (pah-keh-dah; flirt):

 Você tem olhos muito bonitos. (voh-seh tang
ohl-yooz moh-ee-toh boo-nee-tooz; You have
very pretty eyes.)
 Gosto muito de você. (goh-stoo moh-ee-toh jee

Here are some practical phrases, too, for when you
meet someone you’re interested in:
 Me dá o seu número de telefone? (mee dah ooh
seh-ooh noo-meh-doh jee teh-leh-foh-nee; Will
you give me your phone number?)
 O que vai fazer amanhã? (ooh kee vah-ee 
fah-zeh ah-mahn-yah; What are you doing 
tomorrow?)
 Quer ir para o cinema comigo? (keh ee pah-dah
ooh see-neh-mah koh-mee-goo; Do you want to
go to the movies with me?)
Of course, these are all things you say after the very
first question: Qual é seu nome? (kwah-ooh eh seh-
ooh noh-mee; What’s your name?) or Quer dançar?
(keh dahn-sah; Do you want to dance?)

D
ealing with the phone, making appointments,
talking about your profession, and sending 
e-mails are all parts of a day’s work. This chapter
helps you get through that day in Portuguese.
Picking Up the Phone
In Brazil, most phone numbers have a two-digit prefix
for the cidade (see-dah-jee; city) or a código regional
(koh-jee-goo heh-jee-oh-nah-ooh; regional code),
which often has a zero in front. The phone number of
a famous hotel in Rio called Copacabana Palace, for
example, looks like this: (021) 2548-7070. Basic phone
numbers have either seven or eight digits. The código
internacional (koh-jee-goh een-teh-nah-see-oh-nah-
ooh; international calling code) for Brazil is 55.
Here are a few useful phrases Brazilians use when
they’re dealing with phones:
 número de telefone (noo-meh-doh jee teh-leh-
foh-nee; phone number)
 está errado (ehs-tah eh-hah-doh; it’s wrong)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
132
 está correto (ehs-tah koh-heh-toh; it’s right)
 fazer um telefonema (fah-zeh ooh-m teh-leh-
foh-neh-mah; to make a phone call)
 ligar para alguém (lee-gah pah-dah ah-ooh-gang;
to call someone)
 receber chamadas (heh-seh-beh shah-mah-
dahz; receive calls)
 atender o telefone (ah-tehn-deh ooh teh-leh-foh-
nee; to answer the phone)
 deixar um recado (day-shah oong heh-kah-doh;
to leave a voicemail message)
 telefones celulares (teh-leh-foh-neez sel-loo-lah-
deez; cell phones)
 uma cabina telefônica (ooh-mah kah-bee-nah
teh-leh-foh-nee-kah; public phone booth) or
orelhão
You can find plenty of telefones públicos
(teh-leh-foh-nee poo-blee-koh; public phones)
on Brazilian ruas. Locals, always with a
sense of humor, call public phones orelhões
(oh-deh-ooh-yoh-eez. Literally: big ears)
because the phones are housed in a semi-
open booth that resembles a three-foot tall
orelha (oh-deh-ooh-yah; ear). All you have to
do is comprar (kohm-pdah; buy) a cartão
telefônico (kah-tah-ooh teh-leh-foh-nee-koh;
phone card) from any banca de jornal (bahn-
kah jee zhoh-nah-ooh; news kiosk) on the rua
(hoo-ah; street).
Saying hello and goodbye
Your phone is ringing. Não se preocupe (nah-ooh see
pdeh-oh-koo-pee; Don’t sweat it). I’ll start with the
greeting and goodbye words — they’re a cinch.
Perhaps the hotel receptionist is calling you, telling
you there’s alguém (ah-ooh-gang; someone) to see

Chapter 8: When You Gotta Work 133
you in the lobby. Or talvez (tah-ooh- vehz; maybe) it’s
your agente de viagens (ah-zhang-shee jee vee-ah-
zhangs; travel agent), ready to book your vôo (voh-
ooh; flight) to the Amazon. Either way, answering the
call is fácil (fah-see-ooh; easy).
Here’s what you say:
 Alô? (ah-loh; Hello? [formal])
 Sim? (sing; Yes?)
 Oi. (oy-ee; Hi. [informal])
Here’s what you can say before you hang up the
phone:
 Tchau. (chow; Bye. Literally: Ciao, like in Italian.)
 Até logo. (ah-teh loh-goo; Bye. Literally: Until
soon.)
 Até mais. (ah-teh mah-eez; Bye. Literally: Until
more.)
 Até amanhã. (ah-teh ah-mahn-yah; Talk to/See
you tomorrow. Literally: Until tomorrow.)
Brazilians are very carinhosos (kah-deen-
yoh-zooz; affectionate). When a chamada
(shah-mah-dah; phone call) ends between
two female friends, a male and a female
friend, or two family members, Brazilians
often say Um beijo (oong bay-zhoh; A kiss)
or Um abraço (oong ah-bdah-soo; A hug).
Making a call
Making phone calls in a different language can be kind
of intimidating, but você está com sorte! (voh-seh eh-
stah kohng soh-chee; you’re in luck!). First, Brazilians
typically talk reasonably devagar (deh-vah-gah;
slowly), and they tend to clearly enunciate their sylla-
bles. So go native: Relax. Fique tranqüilo (fee-kee
tdahn-kwee-loh; Don’t worry).

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
134
Here are some example sentences about making a
call:
 Ligo para os Estados Unidos todos os dias. (lee-
goh pah-dah ooz eh-stah-dooz ooh-nee-dohz toh-
dooz ooz jee-ahz; I call the United States every
day.)
 Ela liga para o namorado dela cinco vezes por
dia. (eh-lah lee-gah pah-dah ooh nah-moh-dah-
doh deh-lah seen-koh veh-zeez poh jee-ah; She
calls her boyfriend five times a day.)
 Você liga para a sua mãe muito? (voh-seh lee-
gah pah-dah ah soo-ah mah-ee moh-ee-toh; Do
you call your mom often?)
The verb ligar (lee-gah; to call) is almost
always packaged with para — as in ligar
para (lee-gah pah-dah; to call) someone or
someplace. To use this expression, use ligar
para plus the name of the person or place.
Here’s a sample conversation of a short phone call:
Operator: Bom dia. Hotel do Sol Ipanema. (boh-
oong jee-ah. oh-teh-ooh doo soh-ooh eeh-pah-
neh-mah; Good morning. Sun Hotel, Ipanema.)
Patricia: Bom dia. Poderia me comunicar com a
Roberta Fernandes, quarto número setecentos
e oitenta e três, por gentileza? (boh-oong jee-
ah. poh-deh-dee-ah mee koh-moo-nee-kah koh-
oong ah hoh-beh-tah feh-nahn-jeez, kwah-toh
noo-meh-doh seh-chee oh-ee-toh tdehz, poh
zhehn-chee-leh-zah; Good morning. Could you
connect me with Roberta Fernandes, room
number 783, please?)
Operator: Quem fala? (kang fah-lah? Who’s 
calling?)
Patricia: Sou a Patricia Assunção. (soh ah pah-
tdee-see-ah ah-soong-sah-ooh; This is Patricia
Assunção.)
Operator: Só um momento, por favor. (soh oong
moh-mehn-toh, poh-fah-voh; Just a moment,
please.)

The expression ligar para (to call) someone
has a slang meaning. It can also mean “to have
a crush on” someone or “to pay attention to”
someone or something. Ele liga muito para
ela (eh-lee lee-gah moh-ee-toh pah-dah eh-lah)
means “He has a crush on her.”
Dealing with verbal mush
The first phone conversa (kohn-veh-sah; conversa-
tion) in any new language is tough. You can’t see the
person’s face as she’s talking, or see her body lan-
guage. You feel nervoso (neh-voh-zoo; nervous) that
you’re taking up her valuable time. The connection
may be bad. Her palavras (pah-lahv-dahz; words)
come out sounding like mush.
The Brazilian sotaque (soh-tah-kee; accent) is particu-
larly strange-sounding in the beginning, especially the
abundance of nasal vowels throws off even people
with a good knowledge of Portuguese words and
grammar.

Se não entende (see nah-ooh ehn-tehn-jee; If
you don’t understand) what the person call-

Here’s a conversation between coworkers that turns
to mush:
Flavia: Olá, o Carlos está? (oh-lah, ooh kah-lohz

Flavia: Poderia falar um pouco mais devagar,

mah-eez deh-vah-gah, poh-fah-voh? Could you
speak a little more slowly, please?)
Voice on other side: Sod snod manjekof.

Flavia: Não estou te escutando. Está ruim a
linha. (nah-ooh ehs-toh chee ehs-koo-tahn-doh.
ehs-tah hoo-eeng ah leen-yah. I can’t hear you.
The connection is bad.)
Voice on other side: No momento, não se encon-
tra. (noh moh-mehn-toh, nah-ooh see ehn-kohn-
tdah. He’s not here right now.)
Flavia: Ligo mais tarde, obrigada. (lee-goh mah-

thanks.)

If you want to say “right now” and you’re not
talking on the phone, you can say agora
mesmo (ah-goh-dah mehs-moh. Literally: right
now). No momento is frequently used on the
phone with strangers because it sounds
more formal.
Talking in the past
Sometimes you need to talk about things in the past
tense when you’re on the phone. Here are some rele-
vant phrases (check out Chapter 2 to see how to con-
jugate verbs in the past tense):
 Ligaram para você ontem. (lee-gah-dah-ooh pah-
dah voh-seh ohn-tang; They called you yesterday.)
 Já liguei para ele. (zhah lee-gay pah-dah eh-lee;
I already called him.) Don’t worry that the eu (I)
form uses the stem ligu– while the others use
the simple lig– stem. This means the verb ligar
is irregular for the eu form. But spoken out loud,
you can’t hear the u. So don’t sweat it.
 Você não me ligou. (voh-seh nah-ooh mee lee-
goh; You didn’t call me.)
Deixou recado? (day-shoh heh-kah-doh; Did you
leave a message?)
Achamos que ele estava doente. (ah-shah-mohz

he was sick.)
 Nós fomos para a praia no domingo. (nohz foh-

went to the beach on Sunday.)

Talking about Work
Brazilians generally don’t ask you what you do within
the first few minutes of meeting you. Some locals con-
sider the question rude. But aside from the Brazilian
etiquette about not immediately asking someone about
his or her occupation, conversations about work and
professions don’t vary much from those in other coun-
tries. In fact, you may notice that many Portuguese
words about work are similar to those in English.

Chapter 8: When You Gotta Work 139
Here are some questions you can ask your new
friends when the time’s right:
 Estuda ou trabalha? (ehs-too-dah ooh tdah-bahl-
yah; Do you study or work?)
 Qual a sua profissão? (kwah-ooh ah soo-ah
pdoh-fee-sah-ooh; What’s your profession?)
 Gosta do seu trabalho? (goh-stah doo seh-ooh
tdah-bahl-yoh; Do you like your work?)
 Há quanto tempo trabalha nisso? (ah kwan-toh
tang-poh tdah-bahl-yah nee-soh; How long have
you been in this line of work?)
You can answer these questions in several ways.
Some jobs are best expressed by eu faço . . . (eh-ooh
fah-soh; I do . . .) plus the name of the profession. For
example, Eu faço . . .
 marketing (mah-keh-cheeng; marketing)
 desenho (dee-zehn-yoh; design)
 advertising (ahj-veh-ty-zeeng; advertising)
 relações públicas (heh-lah-soy-eez poob-lee-
kahz; public relations)
 análise de contas (ah-nah-lah-zee jee kohn-tahz;
account-analysis)
 produção de filmes (pdoh-doo-sah-ooh jee fee-
ooh-meez; film production)
Another common way to express someone’s occupa-
tion is by saying trabalha de plus the name of the job.
Someone may ask Ele/ela faz o quê? (eh-lee/eh-lah fah-
eez ooh keh; What does he/she do?). You can respond:
 Ela trabalha de faxineira. (eh-lah tdah-bahl-yah
jee fah-shee-nay-dah; She works as a cleaning
lady.)
 Ele trabalha de cozinheiro. (eh-lee tdah-bahl-
yah jee koh-zing-yay-doh; He works as a cook.)
 Ele trabalha de condutor de ônibus. (eh-lee
tdah-bahl-yah jee kohn-doo-toh jee oh-nee-boos;
He works as a bus driver.)

Here are some other ways to respond to questions
about profession:

yoh nah ah-dee-ah jee; I work in the field of . . .)
 Eu estudo . . . (eh-ooh ehs-too-doh; I study . . .)
 Eu sou . . . (eh-ooh soh; I’m . . . [profession])

 Choosing transportation
 Getting directions
B
razil is a vast country, just about the same size
as the United States, and the best way to viajar
(vee-ah-zhah; go. Literally: to voyage) from place to
faraway place is by ônibus (oh-nee-boos; bus) or
avião (ah-vee-ah-ooh; plane). Trens (tdangz; trains)
are seldom used. You can also alugar um carro (ah-
loo-gah oong kah-hoh; rent a car).
This chapter tells you what you need to get around,
from accessing taxi services to discussing whether
buses are on schedule to asking for directions. Here

you get there?)
 Quanto tempo demora para chegar? (kwahn-

agencies) all over the place in major cities, so finding
one shouldn’t be hard. This is where you fazer uma
reserva (fah-zeh ooh-mah heh-zeh-vah; make a reser-

Taking buses
In Brazil, you can take an ônibus (oh-nee-boos; bus)
to travel long distances between cities or the ônibus
urbano (oh-nee-boos ooh-bah-noh; city bus) to get
around town. Here are some words to get you started:
 passagem de ônibus (pah-sah-zhang jee oh-nee-
boos; bus ticket)
 rodoviária (hoh-doh-vee-ah-dee-ah; central bus
station)
 poltrona (pohl-tdoh-nah; seat)
 origem (oh-dee-zhang; name of city you’re 
traveling from/origin)
 destino (dehs-chee-noo; destination)
 data (dah-tah; date)
Keep in mind that Brazilians use military time for bus
tickets. Eight o’clock at night becomes às vinte horas
(ahz veen-chee oh-dahz; at 8 p.m./at 20:00 hours).
(See Chapter 3 for more on telling time.)
Check out some phrases you can use either with the
motorista (moh-toh-dee-stah; driver) or another pas-
sageiro (pah-sah-zhay-doo; passenger):
 O ônibus está atrasado? (ooh oh-nee-boos eh-
stah ah-tdah-zah-doo; Is the bus late?)

 Quanto é? (kwahn-toh kee eh; How much?)
Hailing táxis
Táxis (talk-seez; taxis) are plentiful and cheap in
Brazil. You can flag one down in the street, just as you

Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 151
would in big cities anywhere else in the world. If
you’re having trouble finding one, ask someone
whether a ponto de táxi (pohn-toh jee talk-see; place
where taxis line up to wait for passengers) is nearby.
The ponto de táxi consists of a bunch of taxi drivers
sitting on a bench, sometimes watching a novela
(noh-veh-lah; soap opera) or jogo de futebol (zhoh-
goo jee foo-chee-bah-ooh; soccer match) on an over-
head TV.
Here’s some taxi talk:
 Para . . . por favor. (pah-dah . . . poh fah-voh; To
. . . [location], please.)
 Sabe como chegar em . . . ? (sah-bee koh-moo
sheh-gah ang; Do you know how to get to . . . ?)

dee-ah pah-dah ee ah; How much would it be to
go to . . . ?)
 É perto? (eh peh-too; Is it close?)
 É longe? (eh lohn-zhee; Is it far?)
Before you agree to ride, ask the taxista
(tahk-sees-tah; taxi driver) whether he knows
where your destination is. Here’s a conversa-
tion demonstrating taxi talk:
Ricardo: Olá, é longe o Maracanã? (oh-lah, eh
lohn-zhee ooh mah-dah-kah-nah; Hi. Is Maracanã
Stadium far?)
Taxi driver: Não, e pertinho. (nah-ooh, eh peh-

Taxi driver: Uns dez reais. (oonz dez heh-eyes;

Taxi driver: É a sua primeira vez no Rio de
Janeiro? (eh ah soo-ah pdee-may-dah vez noh hee-

Renting a car
If you’re the adventurous type, you may decide to
alugar um carro (ah-loo-gah oong kah-hoh; rent a
car) from a locadora de carros (loh-kah-doh-dah jee
kah-hohz; car-rental agency) in Brazil. You’re proba-
bly already familiar with several international rental
agencies in Brazil, like Hertz and Avis. Here are some
questions to ask at a locadora:
 Tem um carro disponível para hoje? (tang oong
kah-hoh jee-spoh-nee-veh-ooh pah-dah oh-zhee;
Do you have a car available for today?)

Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 153
 Qual é a tarifa diária para esse modelo? (kwah-
ooh eh ah tah-dee-fah jee-ah-dee-ah pah-dah eh-
see moh-deh-loo; What’s the day rate for this
[car] make?)
 Tem assistência vinte-quatro horas? (tang ah-

Do you have 24-hour roadside assistance?)
 Tem alguma promoção? (tang ah-ooh-goo-mah

motions going on?)
 Oferece um plano de seguro? (oh-feh-deh-see
oong plah-noh jee seh-goo-doh; Do you offer an
insurance plan?)
You may also want to get familiar with the names of
the parts of a car in Portuguese — here are the
basics:
 volante (voh-lahn-chee; steering wheel)
 freios (fday-oohz; brakes)
 rodas (hoh-dahz; wheels)
 pára-brisa (pah-dah-bdee-sah; windshield)
 motor (moh-toh; engine)
Here are another couple of questions you may need
to ask about driving in general:
 As estradas em . . . são boas ou ruins? (ahz eh-
stdah-dahz ang . . . sah-ooh boh-ahz oh hoo-eenz;
Are the roads in . . . [location] good or bad?)
 Tem um mecânico por aqui? (tang oong meh-
kah-nee-koh poh ah-kee; Is there a mechanic
around here?)
The shapes and colors of the placas (plah-kahz; road
signs) in Brazil are pretty much the same as in English-
speaking countries.
You may scratch your head when you first visit a posto
de gasolina (poh-stoo jee gah-zoo-lee-nah; gas station):
In addition to gasolina, you sometimes have the option
of choosing álcool (ah-ooh-koh-ooh; alcohol), a fuel

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
154
made from cana de açúcar (kah-nah jee ah-soo-kah;
sugarcane) that’s cheaper than gasolina. The price
difference is about US$2.30 per gallon of alcohol, com-
pared with about US$4 per gallon of gasoline. Many
cars made in Brazil use technology that converts the
alcohol to car fuel. Ask your rental-shop employees
which you can use with your car.

Onde? Where? The Question 
for Going Places
The word onde (ohn-jee; where) can be your best
friend as you navigate any new place in Brazil. Where
is . . . is expressed in three ways: Onde é (ohn-jee eh),
Onde fica (ohn-jee fee-kah), and Onde está (ohn-jee
eh-stah).

Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 155
Onde é is used more for people and general
locations, whereas Onde fica and Onde está
are used to ask for the precise location of
something. Onde é Macau? (ohn-jee ee mah-
kah-ooh; Where is Macau?) someone asks.
They expect to hear an answer like “in Asia,”
not the precise latitude and longitude of
Macau. But by asking Onde fica aquela loja?
(ohn-jee fee-kah ah-keh-lah loh-zhah; Where
is that store?), you expect someone to
explain the street, the cross street, and
maybe the exact address so that you have no
problems finding it. Generally speaking, onde
fica is more commonly used than onde está.
Check out some common variations of phrases that
use onde:
 Para onde . . . ? (pah-dah ohn-jee; To where . . . ?)
 Onde é . . . ? (ohn-jee eh; Where is . . . ?)
 Sabe onde fica . . . ? (sah-bee ohn-jee fee-kah;
Do you know where . . . is located?)
 Sabe onde tem . . . ? (sah-bee ohn-jee tang;
Do you know where there’s a . . . ?)
 De onde . . . ? (jee ohn-jee; From where . . . ?)
Here are some sentences that use onde phrases:
 Para onde vai esse ônibus? (pah-dah ohn-jee
vah-ee eh-see oh-nee-boos; Where does this bus
go to?)
 Onde é a Rua Pedralbes? (ohn-jee eh ah hoo-ah
peh-drah-ooh-beez; Where is Pedralbes Street?)
 Sabe onde fica o Citibank? (sah-bee ohn-jee fee-
kah ooh see-chee-bahn-kee; Do you know where
the Citibank is located?)
 Sabe onde tem um supermercado? (sah-bee
ohn-jee tang oong soo-peh-meh-kah-doh; Do you
know where there’s a supermarket?)
 De onde é o cantor? (jee ohn-jee eh ooh kahn-
toh; Where is the singer from?)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
156
Another useful phrase is Estou procurando . . . (eh-
stoh pdoh-koo-dahn-doh; I’m looking for . . .). The
phrase uses the verb procurar (pdoh-koo-dah; to look/
search for). The verb is related to the old-fashioned
word procure in English.
Here’s a conversation using various where phrases:
Silvio: Por favor, sabe onde passa o ônibus
número sessenta e dois? (poh fah-voh, sah-bee
ohn-jee pah-sah ooh oh-nee-boos noo-meh-doh

while asking for directions in a city, trying to encon-
trar (ehn-kohn-tdah; find) something in someone’s
casa (kah-zah; house), or even while taking an axé
(ah-sheh; Brazilian-style aerobics) class.

 beira-mar (bay-dah-mah; shoreline/seafront)
 morro (moh-hoo; hill)
 igreja (ee-gdeh-zhah; church)
 ponte (pohn-chee; bridge)
Here are some words you can use to give directions:
 vá (vah; go)
 cruza (kdoo-zah; cross)
 olha (ohl-yah; look)
 pega (peh-gah; take)
 segue (seh-gee; follow)
 sobe (soh-bee; go up)
 desce (deh-see; go down)
To give directions, use the command or
imperative verb form. In Portuguese, you can
give commands to someone by using the
você form of the verb. Simply use the a
ending for –ar verbs or the e ending for
–er/–ir verbs. The verb ir (ee; to go), how-
ever, is irregular; it takes the form vá (vah)
for commands. Just like in English, the sub-
ject of the sentence (you/você) is implied, so
you can start the sentence with the verb:
Cruza a ponte (kdoo-zah ah pohn-chee;
Cross the bridge).
Getting directions straight is hard enough in 
English — let alone in Portuguese! So here are sample
sentences that put together some of the terms that
have to do with location:

Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 161
 Está atrás da igreja. (eh-stah ah-tdah-eez dah ee-
gdeh-zhah; It’s behind the church.)
 Fica na beira-mar. (fee-kah nah bay-dah mah;
It’s on the seafront.)
 Olha para lá. (ohl-yah pah-dah lah; Look over
there.)
 Pega a segunda à direita. (peh-gah ah seh-goon-
dah ah jee-day-tah; Take the second right.)
 Segue essa rua direto. (seh-gee eh-sah hoo-ah
jee-deh-toh; Follow this road all the way.)
You may want to use some of these handy connector
words, which help tell you when to do something:
 quando (kwahn-doh; when)
 antes (ahn-cheez; before)
 depois (deh-poh-eez; after)
 logo (loh-goo; as soon as)
 até (ah-teh; until)
Just for fun, here are some more-complicated sen-
tences that show you how you can use those connec-
tor words:
 Vá até a praça, e depois pega a Rua Almirantes.
(vah ah-teh ah pdah-sah ee deh-poh-eez peh-gah
ah hoo-ah ah-ooh-mee-dahn-cheez; Go until you
reach the plaza, and then take Almirantes Street.)
 Sobe a Faria Lima, e depois pega a
Bandeirantes quando chegar no posto de
gasolina. (soh-bee ah fah-dee-ah lee-mah ee deh-
poh-eez peh-gah ooh bahn-day-dahn-cheez
kwahn-doh sheh-gah noo poh-stoo jee gah-zoh-
lee-nah; Go up Faria Lima, and then take
Bandeirantes when you get to the gas station.)

Over Here, Over There
Take a look at how you can say here, there, and over
there. You can use these words in so many settings —
when you’re asking for directions, browsing in a shop,
or pointing out a person on the street. These terms
help you distinguish the physical position of the item
or person in relation to your location.
 aqui (ah-kee; here)
 ali (ah-lee; there)
 lá (lah; over there)
In general, lá is reserved for places that are a few min-
utes’ walk away or more. If you’re talking about an
object upstairs, use ali. If you’re talking about your
car parked on the other side of town, use lá. Also use
lá to talk about stuff happening really far away, like in
other countries. Here are some examples:
 Estamos aqui. (eh-stah-mohz ah-kee; We’re
here.)
 Está ali, na mesa. (eh-stah ah-lee nah meh-zah;
It’s there, on the table.)
 Lá nos Estados Unidos, se come muita fast
food. (lah nohz eh-stah-dohz ooh-nee-dooz, see
koh-mee moh-ee-tah fast food; Over there in the
United States, they eat a lot of fast food.) (Note:
Brazilians say fast food in English.)
 Vá lá. (vah lah; Go over there.)
Say you’re in a taxi. You’ve told the driver the street
where you’re going, but now you’re on that street and
want to say, “Let me off right here.” Say aqui-o! (ah-
kee-ah; Right here!) to sound like a native Brazilian.
The one time you won’t use aqui when you mean here
is with the expression Come here, where cá replaces
aqui: Vem cá! (vang kah; Come here!), a mother says
to her child.

Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 163
How Far? Perto ou longe?
One question you may want to ask before hearing a
complicated set of directions is Fica longe? (fee-kah
lohn-zhee; Is it far?). Here are some handy words you
can use for estimating distances:
 longe (lohn-zhee; far)
 perto (peh-too; close)
 muito longe (moh-ee-toh lohn-zhee; really far)
 muito perto (moh-ee-toh peh-too; really close)
 pertinho (peh-cheen-yoh; really close)
Practice near and far with the following conversation:
Taís: Por favor, qual fica mais perto, o shop-
ping ou a praia? (poh fah-voh, kwah-ooh fee-kah
mah-eez peh-too, ooh shoh-ping ooh ah pdah-ee-
ah; Excuse me, which is closer, the shopping
mall or the beach?)
Concierge: A praia é bem mais perto. Fica aqui
do lado. (ah pdah-ee-ah eh bang mah-eez peh-
too. fee-kah ah-kee doo lah-doo; The beach is
much closer. It’s just on the other side of here.)
Taís: E o shopping? Como se chega? (ee ooh
shoh-ping? koh-moh see sheh-gah?; And the mall?
How do you get there?)
Concierge: Olha, tem que pegar dois ônibus, ou
pode ir de táxi. (ohl-yah, tang kee peh-gah doh-
eez oh-nee-boos, oh poh-jee eeh jee tahk-see;
Well, you have to take two buses, or you can
take a taxi.)
Taís: Tudo bem. O shopping para ir hoje parece
longe demais. (too-doh bang. ooh shoh-ping pah-
dah eeh oh-zhee pah-deh-see lohn-zhee jee-mah-
eez; All right. The mall seems too far away to go
to today.)
Concierge: Melhor ficar tranqüila na praia.
(mel-yoh fee-kah tdahn-kwee-lah nah pdah-ee-ah;
It’s better to relax on the beach.)

Finding a Place to Lay
Your Weary Head
In This Chapter
 Finding a home
 Scoping out a hotel
 Talking about sleep
W
hether you’ve been working at the office or
out shopping and seeing the sights, you need
a place to lay your head. This chapter gives you the
phrases you need to find a house or a hotel.
Finding a Place to Live
Most Brazilians in cities live in apartments, and most
Brazilians in rural areas live in houses — like most
people in the world. If you’re staying in Brazil for a
while and need to rent a place to stay, you may find
that renting an apartment in Brazil is a little different
from renting an apartment in the United States.
Here are some questions you may want to ask the
landlord of an apartment you’re interested in:
 Fica em qual andar? (fee-kah ang kwah-ooh
ahn-dah; What floor is it on?)
 Que tipo de vista tem? (kee chee-poh jee vee-
stah tang; What type of a view does it have?)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
166
 Quanto é o aluguel? (kwahn-toh eh ooh ah-loo-
geh-ooh; How much is the rent?)
 Tem ar condicionado? (tang ah kohn-dee-see-
ooh-nah-doo; Does it have air-conditioning?)
 Quantos metros quadrados? (kwahn-tohs meht-
dohs kwah-drah-dohs; How many square
meters?)
 Vem incluída a luz? (vang een-kloo-ee-dah ah
looz; Is electricity included?)
 Tem estacionamento? (tang eh-stah-see-oh-nah-
mehn-toh; Does it have a parking spot?)
Take a look at Table 10-1 for some basic words that
you may want to use when you discuss accommoda-
tions or start to furnish your apartment:

Brazilians call the first floor of a building the
térreo (teh-hee-oh; ground), and what people
call in English the second floor, they call the
primeiro andar (pdee-may-doh ahn-dah; first
floor). A tad confusing at first, but fairly easy
to get used to!
Checking Out the 
Hotel or Pousada
In Brazil, there are two main types of hospedagem
(oh-speh-dah-zhang; lodging). Hotéis (oh-tay-eez;
hotels) are very large and and may have lots of ameni-
ties, and pousadas (poh-zah-dahz; guesthouses) are
small and friendly.
Deciding where to stay
Before you decide where to stay, you want to revisar
(heh-vee-zah; check out) the quartos (kwah-tooz;
rooms) and the place in general, dentro (dehn-tdoh;
inside) and fora (foh-dah; outside). You’ll want to ask
some perguntas (peh-goon-tahz; questions), too.

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
168
Hotels are a great place to use the expression 
Tem . . . ? (tang; Does it have/Do you have . . . ?). 
Here are some perguntas you can use to ask about 
o quarto:
 Tem água quente? (tang ah-gwah kang-chee;
Does it have hot water?)
 Tem banheira? (tang bahn-yay-dah; Does it have
a bathtub?)
 Tem ar condicionado? (tang ah kohn-dee-see-
ooh-nah-doo; Does it have air-conditioning?)
 Tem ventilador? (tang vehn-chee-lah-doh; Does
it have a fan?)
 Tem cofre? (tang koh-fdee; Does it have a safe
deposit box?)
 Tem vista? (tang vee-stah; Does it have a view?)
 Tem acesso à Internet? (tang ahk-seh-soo ah
een-teh-neh-chee; Does it have Internet access?)
 Tem TV a cabo? (tang teh-veh ah kah-boh; Does
it have cable TV?)
 Tem Jacuzzi? (tang zhah-koo-zee; Does it have a
Jacuzzi?)
And here’s what you can ask about the hotel (oh-tay-
ooh; hotel) or pousada (poh-zah-dah; guesthouse) in
general:
 Tem café incluído? (vang een-kloo-ee-doh ooh
kah-feh; Is breakfast included?)
 Tem piscina? (tang pee-see-nah; Do you have a
pool?)
 Tem quarto para não fumantes? (tang kwah-toh
pah-dah nah-ooh foo-mahn-cheez; Do you have
nonsmoking rooms?)
 Tem academia? (tang ah-kah-deh-mee-ah; Do
you have a gym?)
This phrase doesn’t use tem, but you can use it to ask
about one of the hotel services: Oferecem transporte

Chapter 10: A Place to Lay Your Weary Head 169
do aeroporto? (oh-feh-deh-sehn tdahn-spoh-chee doo
ah-eh-doh-poh-too; Do you offer a pickup service from
the airport?).
Making reservations
You can use the preceding questions and phrases
about hospedagem (oh-speh-dah-zhang; accommoda-
tions) either on the phone, when you’re making a
reserva (heh-seh-vah; reservation), or in person, at
the reçepção do hotel (heh-sep-sah-ooh doo oh-teh-
ooh; hotel reception desk). (For more on talking on
the phone, see Chapter 8.)
If you can do so, trying to fazer uma reserva (fah-zeh
ooh-mah heh-seh-vah; make a reservation) before you
chegar (sheh-gah; arrive) is always a good idea. The
most important question, of course, is whether the
place has a vaga (vah-gah; vacancy). Here are some
helpful phrases:
 Tem vaga para hoje à noite? (tang vah-gah pah-
dah oh-zhee ah noh-ee-chee; Do you have a
vacancy for tonight?)
 Tem vaga para o fim de semana? (tang vah-gah
pah-dah ooh fing jee seh-mah-nah; Do you have
a vacancy for the weekend?)
 Tem vaga para o mês que vem? (tang vah-gah
pah-dah ooh mehz kee vang; Do you have a
vacancy for next month?)
 Eu quero fazer uma reserva. (eh-ooh kee-dee-
ah fah-zeh ooh-mah heh-seh-vah; I want to make
a reservation.)
 É para duas pessoas. (eh pah-dah doo-ahz peh-
soh-ahz; It’s for two people.)
 Só para uma pessoa. (soh pah-dah ooh-mah peh-
soh-ah; Just for one person.)
The hotel clerk may ask or tell you:
 Quantas pessoas? (kwahn-tahz peh-soh-ahz;
How many people?)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
170
 Por quantas noites? (poh kwahn-tahz noh-ee-
cheez; For how many nights?)
 Cama de casal, ou duas camas de solteiro?
(kah-mah jee kah-zah-ooh, ooh doo-ahz kah-
mahz jee soh-ooh-tay-doh; A double bed, or two
twin beds?)
Checking in and checking out:
Registration procedures
Funnily enough, most Brazilians refer to the check-in
process as o check-in (ooh sheh-king). Fazer o check-
in (fah-zeh ooh sheh-king) means “to check in.”
Checking into a hotel (oh-tay-ooh; hotel) or pousada
(poh-zah-dah; guesthouse) in Brazil is the same
process as you’d see in most places around the
world. First, you give the desk clerk your nome (noh-
mee; name). If you have a reserva (heh-seh-vah; reser-
vation), the clerk will probably check the detalhes
(deh-tah-leez; details) on file for you and then give
you the chaves (shah-veez; keys) to the room. On the
way to your quarto (kwah-too; room), a hotel worker
will probably point out important places in the prédio
(pdehj-ee-yoo; building), like where you’ll be eating
café da manhã (kah-feh dah mahn-yah; breakfast) and
where the academia (ah-kah-deh-mee-ah; gym) and
piscina (pee-see-nah; pool) are, if it’s a large hotel.
By federal law, every hotel and pousada has to give
every hóspede (oh-speh-jee; guest) a ficha (fee-shah;
form) to fill out, which asks you to write down basic
I.D. information, as well as which places you’ve vis-
ited in Brazil so far and which places you’re headed
to. This ficha helps Embratur (em-bdah-too; the fed-
eral tourism board) understand the activity of its
tourists. The ficha uses the following terms:
 nome (noh-mee; first name)
 sobrenome (soh-bdee noh-mee; last name/
surname)
 país de origem (pah-eez jee oh-dee-zhang; 
country of origin)

Chapter 10: A Place to Lay Your Weary Head 171
 data (dah-tah; date)
 próximo destino (pdoh-see-moh dehs-chee-noo;
next destination)
 número de passaporte (noo-meh-doh jee pah-
sah-poh-chee; passport number)
The following are some phrases that the hotel clerk
may use:
 Aqui tem duas chaves. (ah-kee tang doo-ahz
shah-veez; Here are two keys.)
 Preencha essa ficha, por favor. (pdehn-sha eh-
sah fee-shah poh fah-voh; Fill out this form,
please.)
Talking about Sleep
Whether you’re going home after a long day at work
or after sightseeing ’til you’re ready to drop, the fol-
lowing phrases show you how to say how tired you
are or to talk about sleep in general:
 Dormiu bem? (doh-mee-ooh bang; Did you sleep
well?)
 Dormi muito mal. (doh-mee moh-ee-toh mah-
ooh; I slept really poorly.)
 Dormi como uma pedra. (doh-mee koh-moo
ooh-mah ped-rah; I slept like a rock — Brazilian
for I slept like a log.)
 Dormimos só quatro horas. (doo-mee-mooz soh
kwah-tdoh oh-dahz; We slept only four hours.)
 Eu preciso dormir oito horas. (eh-ooh pdeh-
see-zoo doo-mee oh-ee-toh oh-dahz; I need to
sleep eight hours.)
 Os gatos dormem no meu quarto. (ooz gah-
tohz doo-mang noh meh-ooh kwah-too; The cats
sleep in my room.)
 Adoro dormir na praia. (ah-doh-doo doh-mee
nah pdah-ee-ah; I love sleeping on the beach.)

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
172
 Vou dormir. Boa noite. (voh doo-mee. boh-ah
noh-ee-chee; I’m going to bed. Good night.)
 Você deveria ir dormir cedo hoje. (voh-seh deh-
veh-dee-ah ee doo-mee seh-doo oh-zhee; You
should go to sleep early today.)
 Não funciono se durmo menos de cinco horas.
(nah-ooh foon-see-oh-noo see doo-moh meh-
nohz jee seen-koh oh-dahz; I can’t function if I
sleep less than five hours.)
A useful sleep-related phrase is estar com sono (eh-
stah kohng soh-noo; to be sleepy):
 Está com sono? (eh-stah kohng soh-noo; Are you
sleepy?)
 Estou com sono. (eh-stoh kohng soh-noo; I’m
sleepy.)
Hopefully, you’ll never have pesadelos (peh-zah-deh-
looz; nightmares) — only sonhos doces (sohn-yooz
doh-seez; sweet dreams)!
Acorda! (ah-koh-dah; Wake up!) is what a Brazilian
may say if you haven’t set your despertador (deh-
speh-tah-doh; alarm clock) properly. Here are some
other phrases related to waking up:
 Acordei cedo. (ah-koh-day seh-doh; I woke up
early.)
 Acordei tarde. (ah-koh-day tah-jee; I woke up
late.)
 Poderia me acordar às oito horas? (poh-deh-
dee-ah mee ah-koh-dah ahz oh-ee-toh oh-dahz;
Could you wake me up at 8 o’clock?)
 A que horas tem que acordar amanhã? (ah kee
oh-dahz tang kee ah-koh-dah ah-mahn-yah?;
What time do you have to wake up tomorrow?)

 Shouting for help after a robbery or other
incident
 Preventing illness and getting medical help
 Talking about legal problems
E
mergencies can happen anywhere, and you
can handle them best if you’re prepared. This
chapter tells you how to deal with life’s unexpected
adventures.
Here are some basic emergency terms to start 
you out:
 Cuidado! (kwee-dah-doh; Watch out!)
 Rápido! (hah-pee-doh; Quick!)
 Vamos! (vah-mooz; Let’s go!)
 Me ajuda! (mee ah-zhoo-dah; Help me!)
 Fogo! (foh-goo; Fire!)

Stick ’em Up: What to Say 
If You’re Robbed
So what should you do if you’re being robbed? The
local refrain is Não reaja (nah-ooh hee-ah-zhah; 
Don’t react). That means: Don’t shout, don’t try to get
away, don’t punch the ladrão (lah-drah-ooh; robber/
pickpocket).
Saying nothing during a robbery is generally best, but
here are some classic phrases you may want to know:
 Não tenho dinheiro. (nah-ooh tang-yoh jing-yay-
doh; I don’t have any money.)
 Não tenho nada. (nah-ooh tang-yoh nah-dah; 
I don’t have anything.)
 Socorro! (soh-koh-hoo; Help!)
 É ladrão! (eh lah-drah-ooh; He’s a robber/pick-
pocket!)
Of course, you want to try to avoid having any prob-
lems in Brazil. Besides taking the same safety precau-
tions you’d take back at home, it’s always a good idea
to ask locals whether a certain area is safe:
 Esta região é segura? (eh-stah heh-zhee-ah-ooh
eh seh-goo-dah; Is this area safe?)
 Quais os bairros que são perigosos? (kwah-eez
oohz bah-ee-hooz kee sah-ooh peh-dee-goh-zooz;
Which neighborhoods are dangerous?)
Asking for and receiving help
Say you’ve just been robbed. You had only a little
money on you, and the robber didn’t get anything
else. You now need to get back home or to your hotel.
For this situation, or any other time you need help for
something that’s not a major emergency, you can use
these phrases:

Chapter 11: Dealing with Emergencies 177
 Por favor, poderia me ajudar? (poh fah-voh
poh-deh-dee-ah mee ah-zhoo-dah; Excuse me,
could you help me?)
 Eu preciso de ajuda, por favor. (eh-ooh pdeh-
see-zoo jee ah-zhoo-dah, poh fah-voh; I need
help, please.)
 Por favor, posso usar o seu telefone? (poh fah-
voh, poh-soh ooh-zah ooh seh-ooh teh-leh-foh-
nee?; Excuse me, could I use your phone?)
 Preciso ligar para o consulado. (pdeh-see-zoo
lee-gah pah-dah ooh kohn-soo-lah-doo; I need to
call the consulate.)
 Tem o número da polícia local? (tang ooh noo-
meh-doh dah poh-lee-see-ah loh-kah-ooh?; Do
you have the number for the local police?)
Conversely, what can you say if Brazilians offer you
ajuda (ah-zhoo-dah; help)? Try these responses:
 Obrigado/a, sim, eu preciso de ajuda. (oh-
bdee-gah-doh/dah sing eh-ooh pdeh-see-zoo jee
ah-zhoo-dah; Thanks, yes, I need help.)
 Estou bem, obrigado/a. (eh-stoh bang, oh-bdee-
gah-doh/dah; I’m fine, thanks.)
 Não preciso de ajuda. (nah-ooh pdeh-see-zoo
jee ah-zhoo-dah; I don’t need any help.)
 Eu prefiro ficar sozinho/a. (eh-ooh pdeh-fee-
doo fee-kah soh-zeen-yoh/yah; I prefer to be
alone.)

Reporting a problem to the police
Most Brazilians will tell you they fear a polícia (ah
poh-lee-see-ah; the police) more than they trust them.
Police officers are generally fine with tourists, though,
and they’re good for filing insurance forms if you get
robbed — especially in Rio, a city economically tied
to its tourism trade.
Here’s what you can tell the polícia if you want to
report a robbery:
 Fui roubado/a. (fwee hoh-bah-doh/dah; I’ve
been robbed.)
 Eu preciso fazer um boletim de ocorrência.
(eh-ooh pdeh-see-zoo fah-zeh oong boh-leh-
ching jee oh-koh-hen-see-ah; I need to report a
robbery.)

Chapter 11: Dealing with Emergencies 179
 É para a minha companhia de seguros. (eh
pah-dah ah ming-yah kom-pahn-yee-ah jee seh-
goo-dohz; It’s for my insurance company.)
The polícia may ask you some of the following 
questions:
 Quando aconteceu? (kwahn-doh ah-kohn-teh-
seh-ooh; When did it happen?)
 Onde aconteceu? (ah-ohn-jee ah-kohn-teh-seh-
ooh; Where did it happen?)
 O que que foi roubado? (ooh kee kee foh-ee
hoh-bah-doh; What was stolen?)
 Viu o assaltante? (vee-ooh ooh ah-sah-ooh-tahn-
chee; Did you see the assailant?)
 Usou uma arma? (ooh-zoh ooh-mah ah-mah; Did
he use a weapon?)
Of course, the polícia will probably ask you the regu-
lar questions outlined in earlier chapters, like Qual é
seu nome? (kwah-ooh eh seh-ooh noh-mee; What’s
your name?) and Você é de que país? (voh-seh eh jee
kee pah-eez; What country are you from?). (See
Chapter 4.)
Although Socorro! (soh-koh-hoo) means
“Help!” Brazilians don’t use the verb socor-
rer much. You can also shout Ajuda! if you’re
in trouble, though Socorro! is the classic
plea for help.
Handling Health Emergencies
Having to get medical treatment in another country
can be scary, and it’s never fun. Knowing a few
phrases that can help you communicate is bound to
calm you down a bit!

Getting sick
Here are some helpful phrases to use, whether you’re
at the médico (meh-jee-koo; doctor) or the farmácia
(fah-mah-see-ah; drugstore):
 Estou com dor de cabeça. (eh-stoh koh-oong
doh jee kah-beh-sah; I have a headache.)
 Estou com muita dor. (eh-stoh koh-oong moh-
ee-tah doh; I’m in a lot of pain.)

Handling broken bones and 
other injuries
Whether you have a stomach virus or a broken leg,
knowing what certain parts of the body are called in
Portuguese is useful so you can more easily communi-
cate with doctors in Brazil. I start with a cabeça (ah
kah-beh-sah; the head) and work my way down o

 olho (ohl-yoh; eye)
 boca (boh-kah; mouth)
 língua (ling-gwah; tongue)
 orelha (oh-deh-ooh-yah; ear)
 nariz (nah-deez; nose)

Discussing Legal Problems
Misunderstandings with the police can occur. If the
situation is at all sério (seh-dee-ooh; serious), the first
thing to do is contact the nearest consulate for your
country. You may also need to contact an advogado
(ahj-voh-gah-doo; lawyer). In that case, ask for one
who speaks English:
 Tem um advogado que fala inglês? (tang oong
ahj-voh-gah-doh kee fah-lah een-glehz; Is there a
lawyer who speaks English?)
 Tem um consulado americano aqui? (tang oong
kohn-soo-lah-doh ah-meh-dee-kah-noh ah-kee; Is
there an American consulate here?)
With any luck, you won’t ever have to say or hear
these phrases:
 Quero fazer uma queixa. (keh-doo fah-zeh ooh-
mah kay-shah; I want to register a complaint.)
 Vamos ter que dar uma multa. (vah-mohz teh
kee dah ooh-mah mool-tah; We’re going to have
to give you a ticket.)

(vah-mohz chee leh-vah pah-dah ah deh-leh-gah-

You want to evitar (eh-vee-tah; avoid) a visit to a
cadeia (ah kah-day-ah; jail) at all costs — jails in
Brazil are notoriously overcrowded, scary places.

Ten Favorite Brazilian
Portuguese Expressions
B
razilian Portuguese is a fun language. It’s
humorous and full of spice and emotion. Think
of these phrases as clues to Brazilian culture. They
start to paint a picture of a nation full of lively,
friendly, and laid-back people.
Que saudade!
The word saudade (sah-ooh-dah-jee) has no direct
translation in English, and it’s a major source of lin-
guistic pride for Brazilians. Use Que saudade! (kee
sah-ooh-dah-jee) when you miss something so desper-
ately, you have a heartache over it. People say Que
saudade! when they remember their best friend
who’s now living far away, or their childhood beach.
Fala sério!
Say Fala sério (fah-lah seh-dee-oh) to mean “You’re
kidding!” or “You’re joking!” or “No way!” Brazilians
also say Não acredito! (nah-ooh ah-kdeh-jee-toh; 
I can’t believe it!) in the same situations. But Fala
sério has a funnier tone to it. It literally means, “Talk 
seriously.”

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
188
. . . pra caramba!
Here’s a great way to emphasize how off-the-charts
something is. Pra caramba (pdah kah-dahm-bah) is
most often used at the end of a sentence to exagger-
ate something. Use this phrase instead of putting
muito (moh-ee-toh; very) or bem (bang; very) in front
of these same words.
Take the classic phrase É boa pra caramba (eh boh-
ah pdah kah-dahm-bah). Boa by itself means “good.”
When pra caramba comes after good, it transforms
It’s good to It’s amazing.
Engraçado means “funny.” Engraçado pra caramba
(ang-gdah-sah-doo pdah kah-dahm-bah) means “hilari-
ous.” Muito frio means “very cold.” So how cold was
it? Frio pra caramba! (fdee-oh pdah kah-dahm-bah;
Really, really cold!).
Lindo maravilhoso!
Lindo maravilhoso! (leen-doh mah-dah-veel-yoh-zoo)
is a very Brazilian saying that literally translates to
“Beautiful, marvelous!” Brazilians like to gush about
beauty and how amazing things are.
The weather can be lindo maravilhoso! — Hoje
estava um dia lindo maravilhoso! (oh-zhee eh-stah-
vah oong jee-ah leen-doh mah-dah-veel-yoh-zoo;
Today the weather was fantastic!). A place can be
lindo maravilhoso! — O local é lindo maravilhoso!
(ooh loh-kah-ooh eh leen-doh mah-dah-veel-yoh-zoo;
The place is amazing!). If you admire someone’s work,
that can be lindo maravilhoso!, too.
And try to remember to use an a at the end of each
word instead of the o if the word you’re talking about

Chapter 12: Ten Favorite Portuguese Expressions 189
is feminine. A gorgeous woman is linda maravilhosa!
And a handsome man is lindo maravilhoso!
É mesmo?
É mesmo? (eh mehz-moh) means “Really?” It’s usually
used to react to some interesting new fact.
You tell someone: Did you know that Portuguese is
the fifth most-spoken language in the world? She
answers back: É mesmo?
You tell someone that you’re learning Portuguese.
What does she answer back? Sometimes it’s an enthu-
siastic É mesmo! (Really!).
Um beijo! or Um abraço!
Brazilians are very affectionate people. They often
end a conversation with a friend or acquaintance they
feel friendly toward by saying Um beijo! (oong bay-
zhoh; a kiss) or Um abraço! (oong ah-bdah-soh; a
hug). In general, women use Um beijo! to male and
female friends, and men use Um beijo! to women and
Um abraço! to male friends. These expressions are
also common ways to end e-mails.
Imagina!
Brazilians are also very hospitable. After telling you
“thank you” — obrigado (oh-bdee-gah-doh) if you’re
male and obrigada (oh-bdee-gah-dah) if you’re 
female — a Brazilian often says Imagina! (mah-zhee-
nah; Literally: Imagine!) to mean “It’s no trouble at all!”
The initial i is chopped off in spoken language. It
sounds like Magina!

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
190
Pois não?
Here’s a common phrase you may hear when you
enter a shop or call a service-oriented company over
the phone, like a restaurant. Pois não? (poh-eez nah-
ooh) means “Can I help you?” It’s a funny phrase,
because it literally means “Because no?” It’s pretty
nonsensical, and Brazilians have a hard time saying
where the phrase originated.
Com certeza!
This is another fun, common phrase. Com certeza!
(koh-oong seh-teh-zah; Literally: With certainty!) trans-
lates to “Of course!” or “Definitely!”
If someone asks you Vai para a festa? (vah-ee pah-dah
ah fehs-tah; Are you going to the party?), you can
answer Com certeza!
Fique tranqüilo
If Brazilians value any single trait, it’s optimism, being
able to solve problems. And if the problem can’t be
fixed, just relax and forget about it. At the first signs
of someone’s stress, a Brazilian often says Fique tran-
qüilo (fee-kee kdang-kwee-loh; Don’t worry). It has a
very calming effect.
If the bus takes off just as you arrive at the bus stop,
fique tranqüilo: There’ll be another one in ten min-
utes. And you can make friends while you wait.

Chapter 13
Ten Phrases That Make
You Sound Like a Local
P
eople often say that Brazilian Portuguese is lyri-
cal. Following are some of the nuts and bolts of
the language that help to give it its sound. Using these
little words can make you sound really fluent in
Portuguese!
Né?
Brazilians probably say né (neh) more often than any
other word or term. It means “Right?” They stick it at
the end of sentences all the time: Você vai para o
aeroporto amanhã, né? (voh-seh vah-ee pah-dah ooh
ah-eh-doh-poh-too ah-mahn-yah, neh; You’re going to
the airport tomorrow, right?)
And you may also hear né in the middle of sentences,
where it doesn’t really have any use or meaning: Eu vi
o meu amigo, né, e depois não lembro de mais nada
(eh-ooh vee ooh meh-ooh ah-mee-goh neh ee deh-poh-
eez nah-ooh lehm-bdoh jee mah-eez nah-dah; I saw my
friend, right, and then I don’t remember anything
else).
Né is the short way of saying não é? (nah-ooh eh;
Literally: is it not?).

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
192
Tá
You know when you’re listening to someone talking on
the phone, and you hear them say, “Oh . . . Yeah . . .
Right . . . Uh-huh . . .”? Tá (tah) is the Brazilian equiva-
lent of these words. If someone’s giving you directions
on how to get somewhere, for example, you can
repeat Tá . . . Tá . . . Tá . . . and it’ll sound like you’re
understanding and recording into memory everything
he’s saying.
Tá is the short way of saying Está (eh-stah).
Ah é?
Ah é (ah eh) is one of a few ways to say “Really?” It’s
also another of those phone conversation fillers. You
can use it either to say “Really?” with real interest in
what the person’s saying or as a way to show the
speaker you haven’t fallen asleep.
Então
Então (eh-tah-ooh; so/then) is a major conversation
filler in Brazil. People often say então to change the
subject to something more interesting when there’s a
lull in a conversation. It also can be used to simply
say “so” or “then.”
Sabe?
Here’s a case where the translation and use of the
word is exactly the same as in English. A Brazilian’s
saying Sabe? (sah-bee) is the equivalent of an
American speaker’s weaving the phrase You know?
constantly throughout.
Imagine two people talking on the phone. Person A is
telling a story to Person B. Person A says Sabe? about

Chapter 13: Ten Local Phrases 193
every 20 seconds as he talks. What does Person B
say? (See previous entries for clues): Tá . . . Ah é? . . .
Tá. . . .
Meio
Meio (may-o; sort of) is an easy term for you to prac-
tice and wow native speakers with. Just remember —
the pronunciation sounds like mayo in English (yes,
the short way of saying mayonnaise).
Use meio when you’d say “sort of”:
 Ele é meio alto. (eh-lee eh may-oh ah-ooh-toh-
ooh; He’s sort of tall.)
 O vestido parece meio asiático. (ooh vehs-chee-
doo pah-deh-see may-oh ah-zee-ah-chee-koh;
The dress looks sort of Asian.)
Ou seja/E tal
These two phrases are pure fillers. Ou seja (ooh seh-
zhah) means “in other words” but is often used by
speakers just to gather their thoughts for a few sec-
onds. And e tal (ee tah-ooh) means “et cetera” or “and
stuff like that” or “and everything.”
Here is a real example of e tal I found on Google in
Brazilian Portuguese (www.google.com.br): O livro
é sobre dragões e tal (ooh leev-doh eh sob-dee drah-
goh-eez ee tah-ooh; The book is about dragons and
stuff like that).
Cê Instead of Você
Here’s an important one. People very often shorten
você (voh-seh; you) to cê when they speak. Instead of
Você entendeu?, Você vai agora?, or Você é de
onde? they say

Portuguese Phrases For Dummies 
194
 Cê entendeu? (seh en-ten-deh-ooh; Did you
understand?)
 Cê vai agora? (seh vah-ee ah-goh-dah; Are you
leaving now?)
 Cê é de onde? (seh eh jee ohn-jee; Where are
you from?)
Pra Instead of Para a
Para (pah-dah) means “for” or “in order to.”
Sometimes Brazilians pronounce para as pra (pdah).
 Vai pra praia? (vah-ee pdah pdah-eeh-ah; Are
you going to the beach?)
 Pra fazer o quê? (pdah fah-zeh ooh keh; To do
what?)
Tô instead of Estou
Estou (eh-stoh; I am) is often shortened to tô, both in
spoken speech and in e-mails.
 Tô com fome. (toh koh-oong foh-mee; I’m
hungry.)
 Hoje tô feliz. (oh-zhee toh feh-leez; Today I’m
happy.)
