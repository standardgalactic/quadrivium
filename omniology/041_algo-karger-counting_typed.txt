The	  Number	  of	  Minimum	  Cuts	  
NOTE: A graph can have multiple min cuts. 
[e.g., a tree  with n vertices has (n-1) minimum cuts] 
QUESTION: What’s the largest number of min cuts that 
a graph with n vertices can have? 
ANSWER: 

Tim	  Roughgarden	  
The	  Lower	  Bound	  
Consider the n-cycle. 
NOTE: Each pair of the n edges defines  
a distinct minimum cut  
(with two crossing edges). 
  has            min cuts 
(n = 8) 

Tim	  Roughgarden	  
The	  Upper	  Bound	  
Let (A1, B1) , (A2, B2) , …, (At, Bt) be the min cuts of a graph with n 
vertices. 
By the Contraction Algorithm analysis (without repeated trials): 
Si 
Note: Si’s are disjoint events (i.e., only one can happen) 
  their probabilities sum to at most 1 
Thus:
