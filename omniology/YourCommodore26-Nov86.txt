Integrity Solutions have decided to try

problem of static effects on computers.
Surveys have indicated that up to 70%
of computer service calls are due to
static electricity.
Integrity solutions has come up
with the Static Buster to combat this
problem. It diverts electricity from the
screen, keyboard and operator. The
Static Buster consists o f  a tiny unit
with two leads, each with a pick up
head which attaches t o  a  screen a
keyboard. A  third lead attaches to an
earth point with the unit acting like a
static sponge and soaking up charges.

C64 REVIEW
Trailblazer
Ever fancied yourself as a football travelling along an interstellar bypass?
You Have? Gremlin's latest masterpiece can
help you realise your strange ambition.
By Stuart Cooke
i
city such as London in the rush hour is a little hair-raising
then the latest release from Gremlin Graphics will have you
thinking again.
It's not so much the fact that there are thousands of cars
trying to reach the same destination (in fact there are only
you and one opponent), it's the fact that the quality of the
road is so poor. You could say it is fairly reminiscent of a
Sunday drive around the M25.
Before I pass any further comments on the game I think
a little scene setting is in order.
Imagine this. You are a football, yes I know that is hard
to imagine but do try, travelling down an interstellar bypass.
OK, so it is a little hard to imagine but I'm sure the bypass is
interstellar since there seems to be no ground beneath it and
all around are millions of stars.
The C64's screen is split into two sections. The top half of
the screen being one player's view of his_ball and the track
ahead of it, the bottom half being the second player's view.
As the game starts you soon realise that the road, bypass,
course, call it what you will, is not all that it seems. As you
watch the other player disappear off into the distance and
you phut-phut along more like a Morris-Minor than a
football i n outer space, certain things about the track
become apparent. It is made up of multi-coloured squares.
So what do the squares do? Firstly watched with horror
as my poor little football disappeared into the void through a
black hole. Thankfully it did return after a few moments,
though a  number o f  valuable seconds were wasted.
Secondly, my ball, which was by now travelling at umpteen
million miles per hour, was ﬂung backward at an alarming
rate of knots as it hit a purple square.
This is when I  decided to ﬁnd out what each of the
squares do. I have already gone over the effects of the black
and purple squares. The blue ones simply cause your ball to
bounce, useful when your road suddenly disappears ahead
of you. Red ones slow you down and green ones speed you
up. If you are lucky (?) enough to hit a white square then
your ball shoots off down the track with a turbo boost, well
at least until you fall down a hole which is bound to happen
sooner or later. As for the pretty cyan ones, well I'll leave
that for you to ﬁnd out, though I must say they are extremely
confusing.
Numerous playing options are included in the game. You
can have a one or two player arcade game, where you must
complete the course in a limited time. You are also only

given seven jumps which makes it even trickier. A one or tw
player trial game allows you to get used to the handleing of
your ball down a series of practice tracks and the ﬁnal option
allows you to race against a robot, which is not that easy to
beat.
Controlling the game is extremely easy. Forward and
Back to speed up and slow down. Left and Right to move
across the track and ﬁre to force your ball to jump. Getting
your ball to land where you want is the major problem.
The graphics and sound are limited though adequate
for the game. The scrolling playing area is detailed enough to
let you see the obstacles in front of you as you career down
the track, though I must admit, at top speed, by the time you
realise a hole is coming up, you have generally fallen through
it.
On second thoughts a Sunday drive around the M25 is a
picnic compared to this game. Full speed ahead to your local
computer shop and buy a copy. Mind you watch your TV
screen, after a few hours playing this game you'll be just
about ready to put your joystick through it. ' ( T I D

A
may seem like a strange concept when
there's already one in there and the C-
16 must surely be too small. Why then
is Parasoft trying to  market the
Script/Phis cartridge?
The short answer i s that this
package has to be seen to be believed.
In one small cartridge is packed the
very popular Easyscript wordpro with
whistles and bells attached. It beats the
on-board software in the Plus/4 hands
down and turns the C-16 into a very
useful writing implement.
All th e  major functions o f  a
wordpro are here. Block move and
erase, text search and replace, variable
margins, ﬁnal printout preview and
disk/cassette options are just some of
the standard options. Added to this is
the ability to  use mail merge tech-
niques t o  create individualised
standard letters, a simple calculator
and non-C ommodore  p r i n t e r
commands.
Once the cartridge is plugged in, it
is called up by pressing the F2 key and
RETURN. A f t e r  choosing y o u r
options for save/load devices, screen
display size and printer type, the screen
changes to show a reversed command
line at the top with 24 lines for text. As
the text is entered the screen scrolls to
the right i f  your selected width is
greater than 40 and upwards as you ﬁll
all of the lines available in memory. On
the Plus/4 you have 501 lines of text in
40 column mode or 83 lines in 240
mode. On the C-16 this reduces to 91
lines o r  IS  lines respectively. Ob-
viously the restriction on the C-16
limits its uses to letter writing unless
you use several linked ﬁles to build up
a more substantial document.
Formatting commands are em-
bedded into the text and are denoted
by a reversed asterisk. A very useful
addition to  the normal margin and
page length settings is the ability to
place ﬁxed headers and footers on each
page automatically. A s  the names

could vastly improve your wordpro powers.
suggest headers are at the top of each
page and footers at the bottom. At
their simplest these might be auto-
matically increased page numbers
placed at the left, centre or right of the
line. Where a more professional ﬁnish
is required i t is possible to  have a
document name, chapter heading and
page number displayed at the top of
xxx
page number displayed at the top or
bottom (or both) of each page as it is
printed out.
To select a special option such as
load, save or search and replace, the
ESCape key is used to switch from text
mode to command mode and then a
letter key will place you in the correct
mode with a suitable phrase displayed
on the command line to conﬁrm your
choice. The key to be pressed is usually
the ﬁrst letter o f  th e  required
command. T o  save you having to
search the house fo r your manual
every time you need to access a little
used special function, the F7 key will
bring up a series o f HELP screens
which summerise all of the commands.
All of the function keys have pre-
deﬁned functions which can save a lot
of messing about when you want to
access commonly used commands
such as load, save or to display the text
on the screen in the way it will appear
on the printer. Unfortunately the keys
cannot be redeﬁned to suit your own
requirements.
Disk users can revel in a superb
disk support system. All of the usual
functions such as scratch and rename
are accessible but use the old DOS for-
mats which are detailed in the substan-
tial manual which accompanies the
cartridge. As well as the disk command
which allows you t o  call u p  the
directory at any time, a variant of this
is included which lists all o f  the
Script/Plus ﬁles on a disk and then
allows you to select the one which you
want to load.
Incidentally, the C-16 Script/Plus

ﬁle would have reached capacity
during the last paragraph.
By far the most powerful facility is
the ability to create a series of linked
ﬁles. Often a document will not ﬁt into
the available memory, especially on
the C-I6. When this occurs i t  is
possible to set a command at the end of
the ﬁrst section to say that there is
going to be a second ﬁle, The ﬁrst ﬁle is
saved and the memory cleared for the
entry of the second part of the docu-
ment. This may be repeated from ﬁle
to ﬁle until full document is on disk in
as many parts as necessary. When
printing out you tell the computer to
expect a string of linked ﬁles and each
will be loaded and printed in turn.
Another beneﬁt is when you dis-
cover that a word needs changing in a
completed document. This word may
occur in several of the linked ﬁles but
presents no prdblem to the program.
Using the search and replace function,
the computer will start at the ﬁrst ﬁle
and work its way through all of the
linked ﬁl e s changing th e  w o rd
according to your needs.
In the space of a review I can only
nibble away at this tasty model. The
manual contains over 150 pages
detailing all of the functions available.
If you frequently use the word-
processor in your Plus/4 or if you own
a C-I6 and need a wordprocess then
save up your pennies for this package.
Script/Plus i s  n o t only the most
powerful wordprocessor for the C-
16/Plus/4 but also ranks highly in
comparison to wordprocessors on any
other computer.
As a guide to the space available in
the Plus/4, I've reached the end of the
document and my command line tells
me I've used just under ISO lines of my
allotted 501.

A
mine came round to borrow my type-
writer. She wanted to produce a page
of quotes f r o m  h e r  recent 'r av e
reviews' to send to prospective em-
ployers. Several screwed-up sheet s of
A4 later, I went out for an emergency
supply of correction ﬂuid.
This still didn't make the going less
heavy, s o I  volunteered t o  'word-
process' it on my 64. She (my actress
friend that is; my 64 has yet to deserve
that particular pronoun), wanted the
reviews presented i n  a  newspaper
format, with different sized columns
and blocks all over the place. Trying to
do this to 70 columns width on a 40
column screen w a s  r ather  m o r e
complicated than I  had anticipated,
the text rapidly forming a literacy-
defying tangle of bits of different sen-
tences. I n  the end we gave up. My
actress has not been to see me since.
"Oh, for  an 80 column display
mode!" I  thought. "Perhaps I  can
write a  sub-routine that will create
one."
I started with a simple routine for
plotting user-deﬁned characters on to
the hi-res screen. It was then necessary
to reproduce all the cursor routines of
the n o r m a l  t e x t  s c r e e n ,  b u t
manipulating eight times  as  muc h
date. This was further complicated by
C64
Into the
Eighties
Are you fed up of enduring your C64's 40 column
screen? This program should bring you into the Eighties

By S.J. Chance
the structure of the screen itself. The
hi-res screen consists o f  'character
positions' of eight bytes, forming forty
8 X  8  grids across the screen. T o
achieve 80 character positions, each 8
x 8  grid would have to contain two
_characters. T h i s  demanded m u c h
ANDing„ ° R i n g ,  RO L_ing a n d
RORing.
Once you have successfully RUN
the loader program, the subroutine
can be initialised by SYS 49789. You
should now ﬁnd yourself looking at
the 80 column screen, blank except for
the ' R E A D Y '  pr ompt, wr itten i n
teeny-weeny-letters in the top left hand
corner.
If you now type 'LIST', the ﬁrst
thing you will notice is that the word
does not appear on the 80 column
screen. However, when RETURN is
pressed, the program lists in the usual
way. This is where you will discover
the limitations of the resolution of the
TAT. or monitor you are using. Having
only a  humble blac k  a n d  w hit e
portable, I ﬁnd the text quite readable,
if you ae using a colour television, it
may help if  you de-tune the channel
you are using to black and white.
The F8 key will toggle back to the
normal text screen, where you may like
to enter these lines of Basic:
10 GET AS: IF A$="" GOTO 10
Y O U R  C O M M O D O R E  n o v e mb e r 1 9 8 6 : 1 4
20 PRINT Aﬁ1 :GOTO 10
If you RUN this, any characters
you enter will now be output to both
the 40 and 80 column screens. This
includes changes in colour, but with
the limitation that each nybble of fore-
ground colour has to serve two charac-
ters. F or  this reason, INSERT and
DELETE d o  not scroll the colour
memory as they do on the normal text
screen.
The character-set was  originally
more curvatious, but I  found that
squaring-up the corners and avoiding
diagonal lines produced a far bolder
image. A s  8 0 0 0 L  is  intended f o r
word-processing, m o s t  gr aphic s
characters would be redundant; thus
when they are encountered, the default
character of a reverse-space is printed.
If you wish t o experiment with the
character-set, t h e  relevant D A T A
begins with the four double-zero's in
line 575.
The program occupies memory
from SC271) t o  SCBF F . C o lo u r
memory starts at SCCOO, and the hi-res
screen uses t h e  R A M  behind t he
KERNAL RO M at SE000. The sub-
routine is wedged into the operating
system v ia the CHRO UT  vector at
$0326.
Perhaps nex t time one o f  your
friends needs a  favour, y ou'll fare
rather better than I did!

A
or another will have tried to LOAD a
program from disk only to ﬁnd that
the computer/disk drive arrangement
is not happy at all and simply doesn't
want to look at the ﬁle. This sort of
problem i s  generally due t o  the
program becoming corrupted on the
disk. This and many other problems
can be overcome with Super Diskdoe
from Precision Software.
One excellent feature o f  this
program is that it will work with just
about any Commodore computer. It
recognises the machine you are using
and adjusts itself upon loading to suit
the environment i n which you are
working. For example, if you are using
a C128 in 80 column mode the display
presented to you will be in 80 columns.
If you are using a Plus/4 then the
display i s presented i n  40 column
format.
The actual display consists o f a
number of menu and status lines at the
top o f  the screen together with a
display o f the data that is currently
held in the buffer. Data is displayed in
both ASCII and hexadecimal formats.
If you have ever come across
Precision's superb Superscript 64 then
you will be used to the type of menus
presented. Fo r the uninitiated, the
menus consist of a number of words at
the top o f the screen. Choosing the
required option is simply a matter of
highlighting the correct option and
selecting i t. I f  this command has
further options stored 'beneath' i t,
then these are shown and you can
choose from these as required. This
makes the program extremely user
friendly, a s  y o u  never have t o
remember any o f  the commands
yourself, simply follow through the
menus until the command you are
REVIEW
Super
Diskdoc
Whatever your machine or disk drive, this utility from
Precision will certainly help sort out any disk problems.
By Stuart Cooke
looking for appears. One very handy
feature i s  th e  help message that
explains brieﬂy what each command
does that appears on the line below the
menu whenever you select an option.
Documentation
The documentation supplied with the
program is best described as sparse but
adequate. A  small tutorial takes you
through simple operations such as
examining a ﬁle that is stored on disk
and how to alter a disk directory. I
can't help thinking that a  more
detailed description o n  th e  exact
format of the data stored on a disk and
what it all means would have been very
helpful, to  beginners especially but
also to hardened programmers as a
sort of reference guide. To be fair the
'tutorials' do give a little bit o f the
information required and should be
enough to get most people started.
The manual goes into quite a lot of
detail about how to recover damaged
tiles on your disk, cutting out any
corrupted data. Having had to resort
to this drastic action on numerous
occasions, this facility is a life saver.
An explanation is also given on how to
overcome a Data Checksum error, or
the dreaded error 23. This means that
the data has been read from disk but
upon its second reading the two bits of
data don't match. With Super Diskdoe
you can now recover even this data.
Menu Options
The best way to explain the capabilities
of such a program is to actually work
through the main menu command by
command.
The ﬁrst command available is
'DISK'. This is the menu for disk utili-
ties. Upon selecting this a sub menu
appears offering you the options of:

Drive - which allows you to change the
drive you are working on.I
Unit -  this lets you change the device
that you are working on (8,9 etc.).
Report -  this checks a whole disk for
errors, output is to either screen or
printer.
Change - to tell Diskdoc that you are
removing the disk.
LOG - displays a directory of the disk
giving the size of the ﬁle, the track and
sector of the ﬁrst block of the ﬁle. If the
ﬁle is a PRG ﬁle then the start address
is given. In fact all of the information
that you would ever require.
Hunt - searches the disk for the occur-
rence of a string of characters.
Memory - allows you to examine and
change data held in the disk drives
internal memory.
Sort - allows you to alter the order of
the ﬁles on a disk,
GO - reads into the buffer either the
ﬁrst sector of the disk directory, the
BAM or the header.
Ink - allows you to select whether the
disk i s  initialised before the ﬁrst
operation.
Name - allows you to change the disk
name.
Validate tidies up your disk directory
as the normal disk 'V' command.
One command has been omitted
from the above list. This is the BAM
command. Upon selection o f this a
further menu is selected that allows
you to  Display and Print the disk
HAM. Allocate and free blocks and to
check speciﬁc blocks. In case you are
new to the term BAM the letters simply
stand for Block Availability Map. It is
from this area in the disk that the drive
is able to discover which areas on the
disk have been used. Setting blocks
yourself means that you prevent the
disk form using the speciﬁed area of
the disk.
As you can see the range of disk
related c o m m a n d s  i s  q u i t e
formidable, and we've only taken a
look at the ﬁrst menu option.
Next o n  o u r  l i st i s  th e  ﬁle
command. Selecting this command
brings up a menu of commands that
allow you to carry out operations on
speciﬁc ﬁles on the disk. Again a list of
functions is the best way to illustrate
this,
Find -  reads the ﬁrst sector o f the
speciﬁed disk ﬁle into memory.
Chain - this command lists all sectors
belonging to a speciﬁc ﬁle. A program
is stored in more than one place on a
disk and this is your way of ﬁnding
where.

Start -  moves back to the start of the
ﬁle found with the Find option above.
Hunt - allows you to search through a
speciﬁed ﬁle for all occurrences of a
speciﬁed string of data.
Lock -  Commodore disk drives allow
you to write protect a program on a
disk so that you can't scratch i t,
rename it etc. Unfortunately protec-
ting a  ﬁle is quite difﬁcult. This
command makes it childs play.
Unlock -  the opposite to the above.
Erase -  deletes any unwanted ﬁles
from disk.
Recover - we have all deleted ﬁles from
a disk accidentally. This option tries to
recover any erased ﬁle from the disk.
Interpret -  this allows you to display
disk d a ta  a s  Te xt. Basic, 6502
assembler code o r  as screen code.
Extremely useful if you are trying to
disassemble programs from disk.
Verify -  checks that every ﬁle in the
disk directory has the same number of
blocks as shown in the directory, the
readability of the ﬁle is also checked.
Display -  allows you to look at the
contents of any record stored in a REL
ﬁle.
Going back to the main menu we
have the commands Track and Sector
which allow you to specify which track
and sector you wish to look at. Read
simply reads the selected sector into
the buffer while 'write' writes the
buffer to the speciﬁed area on disk -
carefully with this one as you can cause
all sorts of damage if you don't know
what you are doing.
I have already mentioned that it is
possible to change the contents of the
buffer. The Edit function allows you to
do this. Data is entered by entering
either ASC II characters o r  hexa-
decimal values. A l l  operations are
carried out in a large editing area with
the cursor keys to  help you move
around. Once you have made changes
(Or not) you can get a  permanent

record o f the sector on your printer
with the print command.
Easy movement around the disk is
catered fo r by the 'next' and 'last'
commands. 'next' simply looks at the
sector you are working on to ﬁnd out
where the next sector linked with it is
stored and moves you to it. Super
Diskdoc stores a lowest of the last 256
sectors that you have looked at. 'last'
simply looks up the last sector from the
list and moves you there.
The ﬁnal option is similar to the ﬁle
interpret command. T h e  o n l y
difference being that this time the
program does n o t follow the ﬁle
through.
Verdict
Super Diskdoc contains within it the
widest range o f  disk orientated
commands that I have come across in
one place. Sure, there are programs
around that do similar things but the
sheer complexity and range given by
this program i s  unsurpassed. The
program is superbly presented and the
menu system makes it extremely easy
to use.
You probably have a  stock o f
elastoplast in your home just in case
you happen to cut your ﬁnger. If you
are serious about the use of your disk
drive and the data you store, it's
probably a good idea to buy a copy of
this program now, just in case you
corrupt your disk. You may not need it
now, but wouldn't it be nice to know
it's always there?

of built in instructions. However they
did make it quite difﬁcult to use them.
This utility, given away FREE, with
this issue o f Your Commodore will
make accessing yo u r disk drive
extremely easy.
Not o n l y  a r e  th e  standard
commands made easier to access, but a
plethora o f  new a n d  extremely
powerful utilities have been added.
For example you can now ﬁnd the start
address of any program or check a disk
for errors.
The whole program is menu driven
and extremely easy to  use. Simply
LOAD the program from cassette and
it will automatically start. I f  you
should want to SAVE it onto your own.

RUN/STOP and RESTORE to return
to Basic, then simply SAVE it to tape
or disk a s you would a  normal
program.
When the program starts you will
be asked i f you want to change the
colours of the screen. Once you have
done this you will go to the main menu.
Figure I  shows all o f the available
functions, we will deal with each one in
turn.
As you are no doubt aware when you
store a ﬁle to disk its load address is
saved with the ﬁle. This function
allows you to change this address so
that it will LOAD at any address that
you wish.
When dealing with disk programs,
especially machine code, i t is quite
often necessary to  change numbers
from one base t o  another. This

function will allow you to perform any
of the following number conversions:
Hex to Decimal
Decimal to Hex
Binary to Decimal
Decimal to Binary
C) MiC  Data Maker
This function will allow you to turn
any machine code ﬁle that is on disk
into a Basic Loader. Each byte of the
speciﬁed ﬁle is read from disk and
added to a basic data statement. Once
the program has been converted a
loader is added to the start of the Data
and the progrm is saved to disk.
This option brings up a second menu
in which there are a  number o f
extremely useful commands f o r
handling y o u r  d i sk directories.
Options available are:
S L i s t  directory to screen.
Y OUR COMMODORE  november 1986:20
This prints o u t a  l i st o f  all
programs on a disk onto the screen.
L L i s t  directory to the printer
This does the same as the above,
however, the list is sent to the Printer.
A commodore printer is assumed.
N Wr i te  invisible directory to disk
This command alters your disk
directory in such a way that you can no
longer read the directory. All of the
programs can still be LOADed. This is
an excellent way t o  protect your
programs from prying eyes.
D )  D i r e c t o r y  C o m m a n d s  E
 - Write no directory load to disk.
This command has a similar result
to the above. However, instead o f
making an invisible directory it will
prevent anyone from LOADing the
directory into the computer.
p - Protect ﬁles against scratching.
* )  D I S K  COMMANDS AND APPEND F I L E S

With the Commodore disk drive it
is possible to  protect ﬁles against
erasure. Any non-detetable ﬁles can be
seen in the directory with a ' < • beside
the ﬁl e  t y p e .  U n fo rtu n a te l y
commodore made no provision for
you to  use this facility easily, this
option corrects that ommission.
I — read and change disk header or ID
This command is extremely useful
as it allows you to change the name of
any disk and its ID. You are probably
aware that all o f your disks should
have a different ID. If you accidentally
formatted one with an ID that you had
already used you can change it with
this command. This saves copying al of
the ﬁles and re-formatting the disk.
The ﬁnal option on this menu is 'Q'
which will take you back to the main
menu.
E) Error checker
If you should have a disk that you
suspect an error may be on then you
can use this command to ﬁnd out if any
speciﬁed track has an error on it. The
type of error, if found, will be reported
then you can try to ﬁx it with a disk
monitor etc.
F) Disk Checker
This option is similar to the above-
except that it checks the whole disk
rather than asking for speciﬁc tracks.
G) File catalog
You may think that this command is
similar t o  th e  o n e  i n  directory
FREE SOFTWARE
commands. It does however give you
more information.
When you perform this operation
on a disk all ﬁles on the disk will be
listed together with their start and end
addresses.
H) I.D.Checker
No doubt at some time you will have
come across ﬁles on a disk that simply
refuse to LOAD. Quite often the cause
for this is that the ID on the track has
somehow become different from that
in the ID of the DISK. This command
allows you to  check the I D  in all
sectors of a speciﬁed track. Once you
have found your error you can correct
it with a disk editor.
I) Load Address
This function will print out the load
address of a speciﬁed program. This is
extremely useful when used i n
conjunction with menu option A  as
you can ﬁnd out where a program
LOADs, change it and then check it to
see i f  the change has been made
correctly.
J) File Scratch
Option J allows you to delete speciﬁed
ﬁles from disk. I t  is similar to the
standard disk 'S' command but is
much easier to use.
K) F.Unscratch
This is the File Unscratch command.
When you erase a ﬁle from disk the
actual ﬁle is not deleted i t is only
Y OUR COMMODORE  november 1986:21
marked a s  being so . Wi th  th i s
command it is possible to re-juvinate
any ﬁle that has been accidentally
deleted. NOTE this command will
probably not work if you have SAVEd
something to the disk since the scratch.
L) W/P Disk
This command will make any disk
write protect. This command will only
work with the 1541 disk drive. The
write protect is done through software
and a write protect tab isn't needed.
However please note that you cannot
change this disk back into one that you
can write to after this command.
*) Disk Commands
This function allows you to use any of
the standard disk commands (a,s,n
etc). I f  you don't know how to use
them then we suggest that you refer to
your disk drive manual.

Warning
As you can see this set of utilities is
extremly powerful. If you use any of
the commands without thinking then
you could possibly damage the disk
that you are operating on and be
unable t o  recover th e  data. W e
therefore strongly suggest that you
back up any disk that you intend to use
this program on just in case you use the
wrong command.

plating or already making the move
from Basic to  machine code. This
move can be both fun and rewarding
however a lot hinges on your choice of
assembler. The idea behind this article
is to describe in some detail the serious
assemblers around and help you in
your search.
What is an Assembler?
Before launching forth, i t is worth-
while considering what an assembler is
and what it does.
Because we stupid humans ﬁnd it-
difﬁcult to write machine code directly
in th e  fo rm  understood b y  th e
machine, we use mnemonics to allow
the creation o f an intelligible source
code. We then use an assembler to
convert the source code into object
code directly usable by the machine. In
order to maximise the ease of creating
the source code, good quality
assemblers allow you to use labels to
identify variables, addresses, data
tables and the destination of loops and
jumps. Those o f  you w h o  write
complex programs will appreciate the
importance of a structured approach
to allow ease o f understanding the
workings of the program. It is parti-
cularly vital if you want to make the
code intelligible to  other program-
mers. Languages such as PASCAL
allow such a sensible approach. When
using machine code, the use of labels
and remarks are even more important.
Program 1 i s a simple example o f
source code showing the features
offered by most decent assemblers:
Hopefully y o u  w i l l  ﬁn d  th i s

probably mystiﬁed by the wide choice. Look no further
to see the light.

decent assemblers allow the use o f
linked source ﬁles (more on that later),
you can be as liberal with labels and
remarks as you like. This is a powerful
aid since it encourages a systematic
modular approach to machine code.
Since the task of translating these
labels requires some w ork, such
assemblers use two or more "passes"
to perform th e  translation. Such
facilities are a must for any decent
assembler.
Before I  describe th e  better
assemblers about, I want to discuss the
features that you should check when
deciding which package to go for.
Essential features
1
code. No I'm not a machine code snob,
but if you want to assemble a decent
sized piece of code, a Basic assembler
will be much too slow.
2) Must offer full labels of at least six
characters in length. As indicated in
the example above, it's desirable to be
YOUR COMMODORE november 1986:22
able to  use meaningful labels. Six
characters is, i n  m y  opinion, the
minimum acceptable.
3) Should support linked source ﬁles to
allow the assembly o f  very large
programs. Source codes are generally
memory hungry with about 30K o f
source code needed for 4K of object
code. I f  you're writing a 50K mega
game, the combined source code will
be pretty large. Any decent assembler
will allow you to split the source code
into several linked sections a n d
assemble it in this form.
4) Should provide a symbol table or
cross referencing option. Th i s i s
extremely handy when debugging
since you may want to  locate the
address of a loop or routine.
5) Should provide output to printer,
preferably w ith formatting options.
Again, a  hard copy i s  a  great
debugging aid.
6) Should provide 'toolkit" commands
to allow renumbering etc. of the source
code. One important area to check is
the editor used for the creation of the
source code. Many assemblers use the
64's editor. This is OK but not much
use on its own. Other assemblers have
their o w n  operating system a n d
editor. These tend to be more versatile.
The commands t o  look fo r  as a
minimum are FIND, RENUMBER,
DELETE, AUTO (line numbering).
7) Should offer disassembly and some
form of debugging system. You should
ensure that there is a monitor in the
system. This is vital fo r the mani-
pulation of code. Single step execution
is a useful debugging aid. The ability to
disassemble the code is valuable as a
check of the object code.
8) Should provide pseudo op-codes to
allow the creation o f  data tables.

Nearly all code will need data tables.
This may comprise of straight numeric
data or text. The assembler should
provide pseudo op-codes for single
data bytes, double data words and
text as ASCI codes or Commodore
screen codes.

Optional features
I) macros - handy if you want to set up
a library of routines but otherwise, in
my view, of limited value.
2) Conditional assembly - sounds fun
but seems to be more of a case of a
solution searching for a problem.
So what is there on the market? I've
looked at a wide range of assemblers
and have compared them in Table
Notes for Table 1
D=disk, C=cartridge, Cs=cassette.
2) I could not ascertain the maximum
label length for MIKRO but I do know
that i t  w i l l  accept a t  least si x
characters.
3) Some categories have stars showing
the extent o f facilities roughly they
mean:
• = minimum acceptable
** = good enough
*** = couldn't ask for more.
Assembler Monitor 64tom
As is the case with mot o f  First
Publishing's products, this package is
of German origin. Th e  package
comprises of both the assembler and a
reasonable monitor. The assembler is
quite complex w i th  Macros a n d
conditional assembly supported. The
editor i s  rather short o n  toolkit
instructions which is rather a pain in
the neck.
Overall, a good quality assembler
which performs well with n o  real
problems. One of my favourites.
REVIEWS
Mikro Assembler
Those of you who have used the good
old PET may recall this old favourite.
Whilst being simple without frills, this
assembler has a good pedigree and
performs extremely well. One seious
omission is the lack of a machine code
monitor. Supersoft does offer the
excellent ZOOM monitor but it's a bit
of a pain to have to buy it separately.
Compared to the opposition, this
product i s  a  little pricey but it's
reliable.
Laser Genius
This product from Ocean is one of the
new b re e d  a n d  i s  t h e  m o s t
comprehensive I've seen. It originally
appeared as Machine Lightning from
Oasis. I t  has been tidied u p  and
74e c o
supplemented by a debugging system
of signiﬁcant power.
The assembler uses i t s  o w n
operating system and i t has a wide
range of features. The debugger is the
best I've seen and allows the creation
of user deﬁned break deﬁnition. At the
price, this is unbeatable value.
Machine-Code
Assembler/
Disassembler
This is a bit of a departure for McGraw
Hill, th e  b o o k publishers. Th e
Y OUR COMMODORE  november 1986:23
assembler is a little reminiscent of that
on the BBC micro. The 64's editor is
used to  write the source code with
multiple statements o n  each line
allowed. The assembler is told where
the source code is by use of square
brackets.
Both programs are unique in their
use of colours to indicate the different
types o f  instruction. I n  order t o
maximise the R A M  available, the
codes are tucked behind the Basic
ROM.
Not a had package and worth a
look.
Arrow +
This and th e  next assembler are
included simply f o r  completeness.
Both were originally marketed by the
now defunct STACK Computers.
Arrow + is essentially a tape turbo
package. It has an assembler added as
a bonus feature. The assembler is quite
standard and offers no surprises. The
nice addition is a disassembler which
will convert object code into a fully
labelled source co d e . Th i s  i s
potentially a very handy tool.
Note a bad product, and you may
be able to pick i t up cheap from a
bankrupt stock dealer.
Super Help
This cartridge i s  a  combination
toolkitiassembler. T h e  range o f
commands is good and the assembler
quite adequate. There is a monitor but
it's utterly diabolical. Again, you
might be able to get it cheap.
ZEUS 64
Bearing in mind the trouble I  had
trying to reach Crystal, I suspect that
they may also be defunct. Having said
that, I've seen this assembler in a
number of shops.
The package is an assembler/dis-!'
assembler combination and is quite
comprehensive albeit rather unusual in
it's format. I found it a little tough to
get into and the instruction booklet
isn't the most lucid. Although it's disk
based, i t doesn't appear to support
linked ﬁles.
Finally
In summary, the 64 i s quite well
suported with assemblers to suit all
tastes. All of the assemblers! tested did
the job well enough. If, however, I was
to recommend three, they would be
MIKRO, Laser Genius and Assembler

A
which enables you to store any sound
in memory. Once stored in memory
the sound c an b e  manipulated i n
various ways. Possibilities include,
speed variation, reversing the sound,
altering the pitch of the sound etc. You
could sequence the sound like a drum
machine o r  P a u l  H ar dc as tle's
N N N Nineteen, or just use the com-
puter keyboard as an organ, each key
playing the sound at a different pitch.
This program, written for the CI6
and Plus/4, allows a sample of up to
two seconds to be stored in memory.
This takes up a staggering 10K of the
computer's memory , s o  y o u  c a n

Sampler
Now your C/a can really
sound like a trombone with
this excellent program.
program into the C16.
Two seconds? I hear you say.
This is actually quite a lot when
you think about it. Just count it to
yourself. Not many sounds take longer
than this, And don't forget once you
have sounds i n  memory  y ou c an
sample them to create much longer
sounds.
Sampling is quite easy to do since
the Commodore Datassette does quite
a lot of the work for you - it converts
the analogue voltages which make up
the sound on a cassette into digital
ones and zeros. These one's and zero's
are then transferred to the computer's
memory, just lik e a program when
loading.

YOUR COMMODORE  november 1986:25
How It Works
In order to ﬁll the computer's memory
with the necessary ones and zeros the
cassette port is read (memory location
0). A process called °Ring is then used
with each byte read in to read just one
bit from the number read in. By ro-
tating the number read and repeating
the process eight times, eight ones or
zeros are loaded in. This gives one byte
of sample. This is repeated until the
10K o f  memory is ﬁlled. You could
look at it like a cog wheel with eight
teeth 'feeling' 10 holes in a long strip of
paper. Each full turn of the wheel cor-
responding to one byte being loaded.
Playing the SampleBack
This is much the same process as read-
ing from the cassette port, but this time
it is applied to the computer memory
where the sample has been stored.
When a one is read an audible sound is
emitted from the speaker; when a one
is read, an inaudible sound (too high is
made). This process produces a click.
Do this a thousand times in a frction of
a second, and your sound is built up.
In order to get the speed necessary
for this program the screen has to be
turned o f f  dur ing playback. T his
makes the computer work at almost
twice normal speed.
Playing with a Sound
The organ/piano facility is probably
the best facility, this reproduces the

stored s ound a t  differing pitches.
depending on the key pressed. Only
keys one to eight are used, but you can
have great fun.
Sequencing play s  a  s tr ing o f
samples in  an ordered sequence t o
produce effects such as echo or a drum
machine. It is possible to have up to 63
steps which can last up to two minutes,
depending on the size of each sample.
Reversal allows you to play your
sample backwards.
The test option allows you to play
the sound from your cassette recorder
through your computer, rather like a
hi-ﬁ. This doesn't affect memory and
is a useful way of getting your record-
ing where you want it.
Don't be misled about the quality
of the sound -  it isn't exactly studio
quality. Nevertheless, you are sure to
ﬁnd the quality such that you can still
have a lot of fun with the program.
Typing it in
You should have no problems typing
in the three programs as they are all in
Basic and have a checksum on each
line.
When RUN. Program I will create a
ﬁle on disk. This program is accessed
by Program 2. Once this program is
created on disk you will only need to
use Program 2.
Sample Session
In order to make the program easier to
understand we have included a sample
session that should make things a little
easier.
Sample Session
Insert a pre-recorded cassette into the
datasette.
Move the cursor to the speed option.
Press RETURN and type 4 (normal
speed). Now move the cursor to the
RECO RD p o s i t i o n  a n d  pr es s
RETURN. The window at the bottom
should n o w  say "PRESS P L A Y "
(unless of course you have the PLAY
down already!).
The computer should now blank
the screen for a couple of seconds. then
beep and unblank the screen. You
have now just sampled two seconds of
whatever was on the tape.
C16 & PLU S/4 U T I L I T Y " '
To play a sound
Move the cursor to PLAY and press
RETURN. This will now blank the
screen and play your sample -  please
note tht the more tracks on the sample
the poorer the sound. I f  you are still
not happy with the sound as it  is,
change the speed.
To use the sample like an organ,
move the cursor down to ORGAN.
Now use keys one to nine to play a
tune. Key six is about the same pitch as
the original sample (depending on the
actual speed)
Key zero brings you back to the
menu.
Playing about with the
sound
if you want to tidy up your sample,
play any part of it, move the cursor to
the O PTIO NS func tion and press
RETURN.
At the bottom window, it should
now say SOUND. This is asking you
for which sample you want to use you
can reply any number from zero to
seven. Press zero for sound zero. The
computer should now say S13.. This
stands for starting block (zero to 39)
but it is best to use zero to 35 because
Tour blocks isn't a lot of sample. Then
the computer will ask you the ending
block (EB) this can be any number
between the starting block number
(the number you have just typed in) to
number 39. Go to the ORGAN and try
t
the OPTIONS function and try again!
You c a n  a ls o  h a v e  multiple
samples in memory at the same time in
different blocks of memory using the
OPTIONS function. Before recording
a sample, go to the OPTIONS function
and determine which part of memory
you wish to use.
Sequencing sounds
Whatever s ounds  y o u  h a v e  i n
memory. you can put them into an
orderly sequence and produce some
interesting effects.
Say sound one was a bass drum
and sound two was a hand clap, you
can make these sounds play a rhythm.
Try this: G o to SEQUENCE mode,
and the window at the bottom will ask
you if you want to play the sequence or
edit it.
Y O U R  C O M M O D O R E  n o v e mb e r  1986: 26
Type E  for  edit and then press
RETU RN.
Now type:
1212219
What this  does  is  t o  get t h e
numbers from left to right and to play
that sound number. Sound one was a
bass drum so the number one will play
a base drum, sound two was a hand
clap so the number two will play a
hand clap and so on.
The number nine simply ends the
sequence.
The number  eight ( not i n  the
sequence) loops the sequence (goes
back to the beginning) and plays all
over again. Pressing any key will exit
the option.
Producing an echo
Say y ou have a sample which says
"hello" from blocks 00 to 15. You can
produce an echo by doing this: (going
to options mode each time):
SOUND 0 SB 00 EB 06
SOUND 1 SB 03 ER 09
SOUND 2 SB 06 EB 12
SOUND 3 SB 09 EB 15
Now go to sequence mode and type
E for edit and press RETURN.
Type: 01239000 then N  after  the
prompt " C O N T I N U E ? "  a t  t h e
bottom window.
Voilla! You have an echo!
Please note that you cannot use the
INST/DEL key in this mode, or any
other mode. Also you have to type in
seven numbers  when editing t h e
sequence simply because of  memory
limitations.
Erasing Sounds
To erase a  c urrent s ound f r o m
memory, go to WIPE and press return.
Warning: You have no A R E  YO U
SURE?" prompt so you only have one
chance.
Reversal
This just plays the current sound back-
wards. Y o u  c a n n o t  u s e  i t  i n
SEQUENCE or ORGAN mode.
To play your sound backwards, go to
BACKWARDS and press RETURN

Playing all sounds in
memory
Doing this saves quite a lot of time.
What it does is play the sounds zero
through t o  seven in  order, without
going to the OPTIONS function eight
times!
Test
You can use this function to get a
sample ready or play the tape just to
listen to it.
To get to this, go to the TEST func-
tion and press RETURN
Loading and saving sounds
Keep note o f  the starting blocks
and the ending blocks of the sounds
that you want to save.
If you have a datasette it's  not
really w o r t h  s av ing y o u r  sample
(unless you think its brilliant!) its just
like loading a commercial program!
You cannot save or load a sample
in the program so you'll have to exit to
TEDMON.
To get to TEDMON, you have to

C64 is very limiting. No instructions
are provided to help you with such
things as getting a directory from your
disk drive, merging two programs to-
gether o r  even renumbering your
program.
The extended Basic given away free
with this month's issue of Your Com-
modore changes all that. A total of 27
new commands have been added that
you will no doubt ﬁnd invaluable in
your day to day programming.
To use the program simply position
the cassette in your cassette recorder
and type LOAD "EXBAS" and press
RETURN. Once the program has
ﬁnished loading it will announce itself
and it will be ready for use.
General Toolkit Commands
Toolkit or program development com-
mands are probably th e  greatest
missed form of instruction on the CM.
How many times have you written a
Basic program that the line numbers
went in the order 10.12.13,17,20, etc.
Wouldn't a RENUMBER command
make life a lot easier, well now you've
got one as well as many more of this
type of command.
Should you want to renumber your
programs then you can now use the
RENUM command th i s has th e
following format:
RENUMx,y,z
Where x is the line number where
the renumber should start. If x is 0 then
the whole program is renumbered. y is
the new increment for the lines. If y
was 10 then the lines would step up in
tens, if it was 15 then the line numbers
would be 15 apart.
z is the new start line. This is the

Paul Eves presents a Basic extension that adds 27 useful
commands to the C64's extremely limited Basic.
line number that the ﬁrst line to be re-
numbered should be replaced with.
For example: RENUM0,3,5 will
renumber the whole of the program
with an increment of 3 and a start line
number of 5.
The AUTO command will auto-
matically generate line numbers for
you. Enter the command AUTO 10,10
and you will be prompted with the line
number 10. Finish typing in that line
press RETURN and line 20 pops up as
if by magic. If you would rather have
your program starting at line 100 and
going up in steps of 20 then you would
simply enter the command AU TO
100,20. When you want to quit this
command simply press RETURN on a
line with just the number and no text
on it.
Once you have ﬁnished writing you
latest Basic masterpiece there are
bound to be program lines that are no
longer needed. That's an easy one you
say, simply type the number of the line
that you want to delete and it will be
erased. That's OK, but what i f you
wanted to delete 20, 30 or even 100
lines? This _would obviously take quite
a while if you were to enter each of the
numbers individually. Well the DEL
command comes to your rescue. This
command allows a block of program
to be deleted. The command 'DEL
number, would delete all lines from
'number' onwards. For example, 'DEL
1000, would delete all lines from 1000
onwards. I f  you wanted to  erase a
block o f code in the middle o f the
program you would use the command
in the form 'DEL number I ,number 2'.
This will delete all lines from line
number 'number l '  to line number
'number 2'.
When you come t o  testing a
program it is often useful to see exactly
what variables have been set up and
what their values are. This is extremely
Y OUR COMMODORE  november 1986:32
useful i f  your program has crashed
with an error and you are trying to ﬁnd
out why. The command DUMP will
print out the name and value of all
variables that have been set up by the
program. NOTE: the program must
have been RUN ﬁrst or the variables
will not have been set up.
The function keys on the C64 have
always been a little bit of a mysterious
beast. Unlike those on the BBC and
other computers you can't actually
program them. Well now you can with
the KEY command. This command is
extremely powerful as it allows you to
store, in each of the function keys, a text
string. For example you may want the
key Fl to cause your program to be re-
numbered. Well you can now store the
Extended Basic word 'RENUM' in this
key. The command can take two
forms:
KEY by itself will print out a list of
all of the function keys and the text
that is stored with them.
KEY number, "text" will assign a
given string to the numbered key.
If you wish to use a space in your
text you must enter it as a shifted
space, i.e. pres shift and the spacebar.
RETURNS can be entered by placing
the back arrow at the end of your tekt.
For example let's assume that you
wanted to put the keyword list on key 4
and you wanted a RETURN at the end
so that the command was executed,
you w o u l d  u se  t h e  fo l l o w i n g
command:
KEY4, " L I S T
NOTE: any of the above commands
will enable the function keys if you have
turned them off.
Should you wish to turn off the
function keys then you should simply
enter the command OFF.
When typing in your program it is
always useful to  know how much

memory you have left. M E M  will
display the amount of Basic memory
available at any time.
After spending much time at the
keyboard there i s  nothing more
frustrating to ﬁnd that you typed the
NEW command and wiped out your
program without SAVEing i t ﬁrst.
Don't worry the program is still in
memory and the OLD command will
bring it back for you.
When you come to checking your
programs there are two commands
that are invaluable. The ﬁrst of these is
the LIST command. Yes there is one
on the C64, but have you tried to read a
listing as i t zips o ff the top o f the
screen? Well LIST can be modiﬁed so
that pressing the SHIFT key will pause
the list. NOTE pressing down SHIFT
LOCK will pause the listing until it is
released. To initiate this modiﬁcation
you simply enter th e  PAU SEA
command.
The second useful command is the
TRACE function. Th i s command
allows you to slowly step through a
program one line at a time, the line
number being operated on being dis-
played on the screen. The TRACE
command takes the following format:
TRACE
You must press the space bar to
activate the next line, while in trace
model. Hitting a numeric key will alter
the speed of the trace.
When you have ﬁnished with your
trace you must turn i t off with the
TROFF command.
Using a Drive
If you own a Commodore disk drive
you will no doubt ﬁnd it extremely
annoying that you can't look at a
directory of a disk without LOADING
it into memory and overwriting the
program that is there. Well now you
can use the DIR command which will
display the directory of the disk on the
screen without destroying the pro-
gram. The syntax for this command is:
DIRx
where x is either 0 or I. The 0 and I
represent th e  drive numbers. A
number must always be present, if you
have a single drive then you must use
DIRO.
If you should ever have a disk drive
error you can read the error channel
FREE SOFTWARE
with the DERR command. This will
display on screen the current disk drive
status.
Sending commands to  the disk
drive has also been made a lot easier
with th e  D I S K  command. Th i s
command takes the form:
DISK "command:string, string,etc"
where command is one o f the disk
commands and the strings are as
associated with the command. Fo r
example: DISK "S:PROG1,PROG2"
will delete the two programs from the
disk.
DISK "V " will perform a validate
command.
Playing With Numbers
When developing a program it is quite
useful to be able to transfer numbers
from one base to another. This Basic
provides commands for Binary and
Hexedecimal conversion.
B-D number
This command converts an eight bit
binary number i n to  tw o  decimal
numbers, shown as low byte/high
byte. Any number of conversions can
be catered for, providing that each set
of digits are separated by a comma.
For example the command:
B-D 11001 100,10101010
would give the following results:
204/52224, 170/43520
NOTE: the syntax is the same for all
conversions.
D-B number
Conversion between decimal a n d
binary is possible with this command.
The decimal number must be in the
range 0 to 65535. The binary equiva-
lent is printed as a  16 bit binary
number. For example:
D-B 32768
prints the result:
10000000 00000000
D-H Number
Conversion from decimal to  hex is
possible with this command. The
decimal number must be in the same
range as the above command.
YOUR CO MMO DO RE  november 1986:33
The H - D  command h a s th e
opposite effect to the above command
and w i l l  change a  hexadecimcal
number to decimal. NOTE do not use
a before the hexadecimal number.
Program Manipulation
If you do a lot of programming it is
very handy to have a large number of
commonly used subroutines stored on
disk or cassette. For example you may
have a  collection o f  special input
routines, routines to read the joystick
port, etc. On a standard C64 the onlv
way to get these programs on to the end
of a program was to type them in
again. Two new commands will save
you from this trouble, these are APP
and MERGE.
Let's say that you have a program
on disk that has the form
15 PRINT "THERE
25 PRINT "THERE"
and you had a program in memory
that looked like this:
10 PRINT "HELLO"
20 PRINT "HELLO"
You can stick the program that is on
disk on to  the end o f the one in
memory w i th  th e  A P P  (append)
command. Th e  fo rma t f o r  th i s
command is quite simply:
APP "progname",device.
If your program on disk was called
"test" then you would enter the
command:
APP "test",8
this would leave the program i n
memory looking like this:
10 PRINT "HELLO"
20 PRINT "HELLO"
15 PRINT "THERE"
25 PRINT "TI IERE"
•
As you can see it will be necessary
to use the renumber command to get
the program lines i n  th e  correct
numerical order.
The APP command simply adds
one program on to the end of the other.
The MERGE command is a little more
powerful as it will stick together the
two programs in such a way as the new
program lines are added to the old
program i n  their correct position.
NOTE: i f the two programs have the

same line numbers then the new
program lines will overwrite the old.
If we look at our previous example
and give the command:
MERGE "test",8
then you will get the following result
10 PRINT "HELLO"
15 PRINT "THERE"
20 PRINT "HELLO"
25 PRINT "THERE"
no doubt you can see the difference.
Playing With Memory
Quite often when writing programs it
is necessary to save a block of memory
to tape o r  disk. The C64 has no
commands available to do this so you
must result to POKEing memory. This
gets a little Messy and confusing. The
MLOAD,MSAVE a n d  MVER IFY
commands will rectify this.
MLOAD takes th e  following
format:
MLOAD "program",dev,I,sa
and allows you to LOAD a program
into any area of memory. 'dev' is the
number of the device that you want to
FREE SOFTWARE
LOAD from and 'sa' is the address
where you want the LOAD to start
from
MSAVE allows you to SAVE a
section o f memory to  the speciﬁed
device it has the form:
MSAVE "name", dev,I,sa,fa+ I
where 'so i s the start address for the
SAVE and 'fa' is the end address.
DON'T forget to add one on to this.
If you should ever use machine
code then it is quite useful to be able to
set where in memory you want your
Basic program to start. It is also useful
to be able to set the top limit for your
program as well. These functions can
both b e  performed b y  POKEs,
however the H I and L O commands
make this much easier.
HI address
will set the Top of memory to 'address'
and
LO address
will set the bottom o f memory to
'address'.

Program Readability
Commodore programs are not exactly
well known for their legibility, as you
are no doubt aware they have lots of
graphics symbols in them for things
like clearing the screen etc. The CODE
command w i l l  tu rn  a n y graphics
symbols i n t o  mnemonics t h a t
represent the code that is being used.
For example a graphic hart which is
found by pressing shift S would be
represented by [G >S] which means
graphic (G) shift ( >) and S.
To use the command you must
have the program to be changed in
memory and then enter the command
CODE.
NOTE: once this command has been
issued you will not be able to use the
program again, except for listings, etc,
so make sure that you have saved a
copy o f  the program onto disk or
cassette.
Leaving Extended Basic
Provision has been made in case you
should ever want to quit from the Basic
and return to  standard C64 Basic.
Simply type the word QUIT and every-
thing will be back to normal.

1 ou may  have noticed that our
listings are free of those horrible little
black blobs which send you searching
around the keyboard for  a suitable
graphic symbol. You may also have
noticed the funny numbers by the side
of each line of the listing. Fret no more,
it's all part of our easy entry aid.
Instead of those nasty graphics and
rows o f  countless spaces in PRINT
statements and strings we use a special
coding s y s tem. T h e  c o d e ,  o r
mnemonic, is  always contained i n
square brackets and you'll soon learn
to decipher their meanings.
For example, [ SA I would mean
type in a Shifted A, or an ace of spades
in layman's terms, and [SA 10] would
mean a row of ten of these symbols.
[S-I-2] means hold down the shift
key and press the plus key twice. I t
doesn't take a great leap of logic to
realise that [C+2] means exactly the
same thing except that the Commo-
dore key (bottom left of the keyboard)
is held down instead of the shift key.
If more than two spaces appear in a
statement then this will be printed as
[SPC4] o r ,  exceptionally, [SSPC4].
Translated into English this  means
press the spacebar four times or in the
latter case hold the shift key down
while you do it.
A string of special characters could
appear as:
[CTRL N ,  DOWN2,LEFT5,BLUE,
F3,C3]
This would be achieved by holding

for the C64.
down the CTRL key as you press N,
press the cursor key down twice, the
cursor left key ﬁve times, press the key
marked BLUE while holdingdown the
CTRL key, press the F 3 key and.
ﬁnally hold the Commodore key down
while pressing the number two key (C2
would of course make the computer
print in brown).
Always remember that you should
only have a row of graphics characters
on your screen with no square brackets
and no commas, unless something like
this appears:
[SS1,(01
In this case the two characters should
have a comma between them.
On rare occasions [REV 1 ]  will
appear in  a  listing. This is a delete
symbol and is created by entering the
line up to this mnemonic. Then type a
closing quotation mark (SHIFT & 2)
and delete it. This gets the computer
out of quotes mode. Hold down CTRL
and press t h e  number  nine k e y
(RVSON), type the relevant number of
reversed T 's  and then hold down
CTRL and press zero (RVSOFF).
Next type another quotation mark and
delete it again. Now ﬁnish the line and
press RETURN.
A list of these special cases is given
in the table but remember that only
one o f  these mnemonics will appear
outside of a PRINT string: the symbol
for pi. This may appear when its value
is needed in a calculation so this may
look something like:
Y OUR COMMODORE  november 1986:38
:CC=2*[P1]•R:
Ignore the square brackets and Just
type i n  a  shifted upward pointing
arrow (ie, the pi symbol).

Checksum Program
The hexadecimal numbers appearing
in a column to the left of the listing
should n o t be typed i n  with the
program. These are merely checksum
values and are there to help you get
each line right. Don't worry i f you
don't understand the hexadecimal
system, as long as you can compare
two characters on the screen with the
corresponding two characters in the
magazine yo u  can use o u r  line
checking program.
Type in the Checksum Program,
make sure that you've not made any
mistakes and save it to tape or disk

At the start of each programming
session, load Checksum and run it.
The screen will turn brown with yellow
characters and each time you type in a
line and press the RETURN key a
number will appear on the screen in
white. This should be the same as the
corresponding value in the magazine.
If the two values don't relate to one
another, you have not copied the line
exactly as printed so go back and check
each character carefully. When you
ﬁnd the error simply correct i t and

press RETURN again.
If you want to turn off the checker
simply type SYS49152 and the screen
will return to the familiar blue colours.
You can then do whatever it was you
wanted to do and if this doesn't use the
area where Checksum lies you can go
back t o  i t  w i th  th e  same SYS
command.
No system is foolproof but the
chances of two errors cancelling one
another out are so remote that we
believe our listings are more reliable
than any other magazine in the world.
So get typing!

computer keyboard just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one of the superb programs from Your Commodore.
Your ﬁngers reach for the keyboard and press the letters R,
U and N . You press RETURN, sit back and nothing
happens.
Everyone has probably faced this problem. When it does
happen it's a matter of spending hours searching through
the program for any typing mistakes. No matter how lo ng
you look or how many people help you, you can usually
guarantee that at least one little bug slips through unnoticed.
The Your Commodore Software Service makes available
all of the programs from each issue on both cassette and disk
at a price of £6.00 for disk and f4.00 for cpssette. None of the
documentation fo r the programs i s supplied with the
software since it is all available in the relevant magazine.
Should you not have the magazine then back issues are
available from the following address:
INFONET LTD, Times House, 179 The Marlowes, Hemel
Hempstead, Herts. HP1 !BB_
TEL: (0442) 48435
please contact this address for prices and availability.
The Cassette
All programs on the cassette are saved using a turbo
program. If you have ever purchased software from us on
cassette before it is worth pointing Out that as of this issue
cassette the turbo used has been altered. On all cassettes for
previous issues the programs are unprotected and appear in
the same format as they do in the magazine i.e. in the form of
Basic loaders. The new turbo being used from this issue
onwards allows us to produce fully working versions of the
program on cassette. This means that you will simply have to
LOAD the programs in and they will automatically start.
Should we put any programs for the Cl28 on the cassette
they will be stored as C64 programs. LOAD these programs
into the computer in C64 format and resave them to cassette
or disk. To use the program turn your computer into Cl28
mode and LOAD and RUN as normal.
READERS SERVICE
The Disk
Please Note
UTILITY SPECIAL
YOUR COMMODORE november 1986:40
Programs on the disk will also be supplied as totally working
versions, i.e. when possible we will not use Basic Loaders
thus making use of the programs much easier. Unfortunately
at the moment we cannot duplicate C I6  and Plus/4
cassettes. However programs for these machines will be
available on the disk.
What programs are available?
At the top of each article you will ﬁnd a strap containing
the article type, C64 Program etc. So that you can see which
programs are available on which format you will also ﬁnd a
couple of symbols after this strap. The symbols have the
following meaning:
OLD
This symbol means that the program is available on cassette.
These programs are available on disk.
Since the programs supplied on cassette are total working
versions of the program, we do not put disk only programs
on tape. There is no sense in placing a program that expects
to be reading from disk on to tape.
This contains a few of our most popular utilities from earlier
issues of the magazine. The programs are:
MACH 2 our disk based assembler from Nov *85 to Feb '86.
STOP THIEF — add protection to your programs with this
utility from our Feb '86 issue.
IN CHARACTER —  an excellent character editor from
November 1985.
MOB MAKER — to complement the character editor, a
sprite editor from the March 1985 issue.
DISK EDITOR — an extremely powerful utility for disk
drive owners allowing you to directly access and alter every
segment of your disk.

REVIEW
Videobasic 64
F
forerunner o f  t he c urrent release
Videobasie 64. The former has been
around for  quite some time -  three
years in fact -  and. to quote Keith
Bowden in The Companion to the Com-
modore 64: "it is the best software lib-
rary available f o r  the Commodore
64".
As a consistent user of Uhrabasic,
heartily endorse his comments. Hi-res
graphics. circling, blocking, ﬁlling etc.
are well covered in this software, plus
easily handled sprites. sound and,
most important of all, the very versa-
tile Turtle Graphics which work via
direct command at an exceedingly fast
rate. All this is fully compatible with
Basic, printer output etc.
The new release Videobasic 64 is an
extremely powerful software package
for graphics and sound, Very few of
the Ultrabasic commands have been
altered, but so much more has been
added. Any programs which you may
already have written in Ultrabaste can
readily b e  incorporated i n t o  t h e
Videobasic package for alteration and
extension.
Graphics
The VB screen corresponds to normal
graphic conventions with the X  axis
going from left to right and the Y axis
from bottom to top. You may work in
HIRES o r  M U L T I  modes and the
commands include draw, dot, box ,
block, circle, char (for type) and ﬁll,
When the circling command is used the
x or  y  factors may be modiﬁed t o
squeeze the circle in either direction to
give ellipses. Text to screen is available
in four different sizes,
The ﬁll command can he used in
normal standard colour or in an ext-
ended for mat t o  produce pattern
lilling - you design your own pattern in
a very simple manner, add the data to
the ﬁll command and get results in a
ﬂash. Most commendable, Should vou
make a mistake in the ﬁlling location.
the stop key will do just that.
Evelyn Mills has been testing out a new product from
Adams oft.
To facilitate copying portions of a
graphic screen, a region command is
included. copying areas of' the screen
from one area to another: among other
features o f  this  command reverse
copying is possible.
Sprites
No problem here; sprites may  b e
handled in Data form; Hex or  bit-
mapped o n  screen. Fifteen possible
sprites may be used with 15 different
slots. U s in g  standard commands.
sprites may  b e placed and mov ed
around at will, expanded, rotated and
turned on or off. Once deﬁned, they
can be recalled easily from memory.
Turtle Graphics
V B's turtle graphics are very powerful
and respond to direct command such
as move, turn, turn to etc. Using the
'bye' c ommand mak es  t h e  tur tle
disappear and graphics run at a very
fast rate. Bracketing commandsallows
repetition of moves and there is a lot in
this section alone. All commands may
be interlinked to the graphics mode, so
there is even more scope here. •
Music
This is  fully  documented and music
may be entered in Iwo ways to allow
simple 'sounds' (explosions, sirens
etc.) o r ,  mor e commendable, very
pleasant single voice music o f  high
quality. This can be used as a Raster
interrupt t o  play  along with y our
programs.
All this is fully interlinked to Basic

Facilities to tape or disk, restoration of

Commodore, Eps on.  G e m in i o r
Okidata printers in either small size or
full size screen.
Advanced Features
One outstanding feature of VB is to set
up t w o  graphics screens a t  once.
Y O U R  C O M M O D O R E  n o v e mb e r  1986: 46
Blocks o f  memory ar e transferred
from one screen to another with two
'XFER' commands which are simple
to handle: reverse swapping is included
and the effects are quite spectacular. A
little care must be taken here to avoid
crashing the program. Just follow the
instructions!
Sprites, graphics, copy handling,
pattern designing and ﬁlling are all
possible with the screen swaps and
'ﬂashing effects' can be produced. I I I
went into this fully. I'd ﬁll the whole
magazine. Sufﬁce t o  s ay  that a l l
commands are adequately documen-
ted.
The Manual and Tutorials
The manual is well presented and fully
documented. Included on the disk are
a Demo and three tutorials. For those
of you who already have Ultrabasic,
the d e m o  i s  disappointing: this ,
however, is  adequately compensated
for i n  the tutorials which may  be
printed out in the normal 'list' manner.
These are really comprehensive, part-
icularly with reference t o the more
advanced feature of VB,
Well, if you feel like a change from
icon-joystick-lightpen graphics, have a
go at VB. You won't be disappointed
(although if you are really attached to
your peripherals you may use joystick
and lightpen programs in VB, while
collision between sprites and between
a sprite and background pattern can be
detected).
In y o u r  distribution, 'run-time'
version o f  VB (royalty free -  stand
alone), the user cannot LIST, SAVE or
MODIFY your program.
This is an excellent, well designed
program. It may seem expensive, but
you get a lot for your money, parti-
cularly a s  Ab a c u s  Softw ar e i s
American and the current exchange
rate is hardly designed for the British
consumer. Have a go!

can be like a stroll through a well laid-
out garden. You are enticed from place
to place by the ever-changing vistas!
However, for a user in a hurry, for
example on a quest for a speciﬁc piece
of information, the tree-like structure
can become tangle o f  brambles
constantly catching y o u  u p  i n
irrelevant frames o r ,  even more

well-trodden paths and displaying

tempted to look for it in the directory
labelled "S OFTWA R E " o n  th e
opening list of ICPUG frames.
This is well worth an examination
incidentally, but you won't ﬁnd the
ISOLATOR program there. To ﬁnd it
by trial and error, you would have to
look at the following directories in
turn:

of hitting that particular sequence is
about the same as the proverbial

There is, however, an easier way.
Editors of sections such as ICPUG and

information accessible. Both these

these indexes is the "HIGHLIGHTS
INDEX": an II page summary of the
main topics covered on Compunet,
with the frame number or word you
need to type after selecting GOTO on
the duckshoot menu. You'll probably
be referring to this index so frequently,
that a printed copy is a must.
One potential trap with these very
helpful lists is due to the rapidity with
which things change on Compunet. Be
prepared for occasional "RECORD
DOES NOT EXIST" messages. These
frames may have expired, o r  the
number may have been changed to a
more easily remembered word. A
recent news item about Alphabetic
GOT0s, as these are called, suggested
that you type in a few guesses: having
tried this new form o f  combined
cryptic crossword and mind-reading
exercise I warn you it is not easy!
An excellent source of information
about recently uploaded material will
be found in the GOTOS directory.
Select GOTO on the duckshoot the
type "GOTOS". People who actually
want their uploads read are taking
advantage o f  this innovation b y
uploading a  short notice i n  th e
GOTOS directory telling users that
their offering is available.
Another way to  ﬁnd out about
recent additions to Compunet is to
read the excellent "newsletters" that
give a review of what is available. "The
Jungle Now" or "Wino's Jungle" will
YOUR CO MMO DO RE  november 1986:53

provide, i n  a  fe w  pages, enough
suggestions to  set you o ff happily
exploring. Wino (GE81) seems to
spend a lot o f time looking out for
esoteric uploads in the Jungle and his
recommendations are always worth
checking, GOTO NEWS will ﬁnd you
these "newsletter" frames. GOTO
COMMS and read the Comms news
pages. These get updated about once a
week by GE81 and are a similar source
of interesting recent uploads.
With a little perseverance the initial
hassles o f ﬁnding your way around
fade: but remember often it is exciting
just to  explore the huge amount o f
information a t random. When you
ﬁnd something particularly good or
bad, remember that the uploader has
put a delicate ego on the chopping
block hoping to have it stroked: a vote
of 9 can work wonders! But even a
swift ki ck i s  preferable t o  being
ignored!!
CRJT85 has come up with a very
novel use for the interactive side of
Compunet. Under the "News Update"
directory in the YOURI28 area you'll
ﬁnd some Opinion Polls (172255). You
show your opinion on a  range o f
proposals b y  voting: Compunet's
version is popular democracy at work.
The idea has me t with a  mixed
reception: o n e  'netter mailboxed
CRJT82 saying "Club 128 is about
computers n o t politics, there's n o
place for politics here"... looks like
we'll just have to  stick to  sex and
religion. The opinion poll questions
for rating computer magazines seem to
have drawn more votes, and less
disapproval: relax M r  Editor, Your
Commodore had straight nines the last
time I looked!
While on the topic of Computer

did by the time I'd fathomed out all of the controls for it. Of
course if you've a quicker mind than I have you won't have
too many problems. It isn't that there are lots of buttons or
keys to remember as you use a joystick, however each
position performs a different action and further options are
added by combining the ﬁre button with a direction.
Anyway, before I put you off trying the game, I'd better
tell you what it is about.
The main character is a little teddy bear, at least he looks
like one on the cassette sleeve, called Zen. Zen's aim is to
change the colour of a sequence of sticks from grey to blue
and then set up a chain reaction to collapse them all. Of
course, during his task he doesn't go unhindered. On each
screen he is approached by objects, which look like multi
coloured pumpkins and hovering hedgehogs. which eat up
his time if he comes into contact with them.
Each screen presents a different pattern of sticks. Bridges
help Zen climb around the screen so that he can reach all of
the sticks. The bridges at ﬁrst glance do seem a little few and
far between. Fortunately Zen is not an ordinary, wimpish
Teddy as portrayed by Paddington, or for the more mature
readers, Teddy Robinson, because he can turn himself into a
magic bear. yawn! Once Zen has his magic turned on he can
start to build his own bridges where he needs them. To do
this you have to press the tire button, turning him from an
ordinary to a magic bear, then press the button again and
move the stick in the direction that you want to lay, or

remove, a bridge. Now Zen can climb on it to reach more
sticks.
To make the game still more complicated, Zen can't
change the colour of the sticks while he is in his magic mode.
Turning back to normal is simply a matter of pushing the
stick forward and then carrying on as before.
It is possible to detain the aliens for a while, giving you a
little more freedom as you wander around the screen. To do
this you must turn Zen into his magic mode, pull back on the
joystick and watch the magic dust appear. If the aliens run
into this they will be trapped for a moment or two gaining
you extra points.
Once all sticks are blue, or before if you feel like it, you
can start to collapse the structure. This is done by carrying
out the procedure for building a bridge, only this time
moving the stick in the direction of a stick. This starts a
domino effect causing the sticks to tumble down. Bonus
points are awarded if you can collapse all the screen in one
go.
I don't think you'll get bored with this game for quite a
while as there are no fewer than 96 screens to tackle. The fact
that the controls are a little complicated, the few examples I
have given shows this, may put a few people off, though I
must admit you do pick them up fairly quickly.
If you can stand the strain this game is extremely good
value at £1.99. If you start pulling your hair out you can
always give it to the kids to shut them up for a few hours.

none too pleased at being ordered to break into Odin's
Liverpool headquarters. H e  much preferred killing to
hunting down secrets.
And the mission had soon gone sour on him too.
Dodging into a small cubicle in order to avoid a security

guard, he heard the door slam shut behind him. No amount
of brute force or any number of bullets had any effect on the
door. The only objects of interest in the cubicle were three
buttons. A quick prod of them produced a sensation some-
what akin to being in a lift and time machine simultaneously.
Finally, the machine stopped and another button opened a
door into a room which seemed suspiciously like a library.
Pausing only to  obliterate a passing robot with an
apparently hostile intention, agent I Y started to look at the
books when a voice informed him that he had precisely 16
minutes to ﬁnd and destroy ﬁve creatures. A picture of them
appeared on the small screen and although they looked like
men, I Y knew that they may well be humanoids.
Unfortunately, they looked nothing like the droid that he
had just blasted and already, his time was beginning to tick
away. It wasn't quite the mission that he had in mind but it
did involve lots of violence and there didn't appear to be
much of an alternative.
The screen shows two levels of the area that you are in
and you can see various droids, robots and humanoids
running around and ﬁring. Lifts move you between levels
and the ﬁrst thing to note is that although you can only see
two levels on screen, an area may consist of several so that
although you are on top of the screen, you may still be able to
take a lift upwards. Teleport systems allow you to move to
different areas and there is an elementary radar system
showing the approximate location of your targets. The only
hint that you have is not to blast anything that doesn't try to
blast to you.
Your man is nicely animated as he runs round the library,
cathedral and parks and the music helps maintain the atmo-
sphere. Mission A.D. is a nice blend between shoot-em-up
and arcade adventure and there is deﬁnitely a feel of "I'll just
have one more go."

the castle Arcana. Deep within the castle is the Dark
Clavicle, the most powerful book on Black Magic ever
written. Naturally, Valarequil would love to know what
secrets are inside the book but there are problems. The clasp
of the book is sealed and the special incantation that is
needed to unlock i t is only revealed when the light o f
Shedding Moon falls upon it. As that is tonight, the elves of
Estarion have sent you to ﬁnd and destroy the book and you
arrive at the castle with only two and a half hours to go
before the moon rises.
When you are as evil as this king, you don't leave any-
thing to chance and so the book is heavily defended. The main
line of defence is the small matter of seven demons. Fortu-
nately, there also happens to be seven amulets which will
protect you if you can ﬁnd them. The second line of defence
are the king's many minions who are hell-bent on sapping
your energy. You can counter these by ﬁring bolts of magical
energy supplied to you by the elves.
The castle itself needs to be explored thoroughly. Most of
it is a series of maze like corridors but there are also some 30
special rooms spread over the four levels. These may include
useful items or help you if you are carrying a speciﬁc item.
Therefore, i f nothing happens when you ﬁrst enter,. the
chances are that you will need to return later. Moving round
the castle is straightforward. Some doors are open, some
locked and some just stuck so that they open when you blast
them. There are stairs leading to different levels and an
ancient transport mechanism to be found and used.
Although it bears a passing resemblance to Ultimate's
arcade adventures, I found that Arcana had a better game-
play and was much more addictive. Deﬁnitely worth a look
if you enjoy this type of game.

you are the only one remaining and have been charged with
destroying the Boopalgrop (1 kid you not) from Krellis IX.
Your ﬁrst task on arriving on the planet is to pick up and
deliver the seven Daggers of Power to the portal opening.
There are no problems in actually locating the daggers as a
large arrow gives you the all important clue. You can only
carry one dagger at a time and you must avoid or blast
assorted nasties as you travel through the hallways. The onl.
problem here is that if an alien happens to be hiding behind a
pillar when you pass behind it, you lose a life without know-
ing or seeing what hit you.
If you manage to complete the return journey seven times
without dying, you get the chance to try and pick up pieces of
garlic and crosses. It is just as well that you are told what you
are looking for as the necessary items just happen to bc
invisible, No subtle hints here! Should you succeed in break-
ing the curse, you get a crack at the Alien Presence. He, it
would appear, is not exactly over endowed with grey matter.
for whilst he has carefully made his guardians impervious to
the blasts from your gun, he will expire under a hail of bullets
and not surprisingly, it is his destruction that concerns you
most.
Hoodoo Voodoo is a below average shoot-em-up and
even at its budget price does not represent particularly good
value for money.

its detectors. This could just prove to be a triﬂe embarrassing
as the planet Venus is only 24 hours away. Because of this,
you, as an agent of ILEA (Interglactic Law Enforcement
Agency) have been briefed to shut down Arachnid whatever
the cost.
By means o f a sophisticated teleport system that the
computer is incapable of overriding, you have been beamed
aboard the ship and must attempt to close down each of the
decks in turn. In order to do this, you must ﬁrst clear the
deck of all droids and then access a terminal and attempt to
discover the correct ﬁve port code. You can then move to the
next deck by means of an internal teleport system.
The droids must be shot several times before they are des-

troyed and have an annoying tendency to ﬁre back whilst
you are attempting this manoeuvre, depeting some of your
energy if you hit. You must also avoid bodily contact with
them as their defence mechanisms interact with yours
causing a similar energy loss. This is somewhat annoying as
when you move off the edge of one screen, you have no way
of knowing the location of the droid on the next one. If you
happen to walk right on top of him, it tends to be game over
time (you only have one life).
Having destroyed the droids on a particular deck, you
can try and close it down by accessing a terminal. Here you
go into a mini-mastermind game. The code is a series of live
bytes which can be either set or not. You have ﬁve goes to
ﬁnd the correct sequence. After each input, you are told how
many bits have been set correctly. The terminals can also be
accessed for other reasons. You can get a map of your sur-
roundings (side and top views) and also attempt to gain some
extra energy. This is not very well implemented and spoilsen
otherwise enjoyable game. The idea is that the energy packs
must be dropped into gaps in a series of sliding blocks. If y ou
succeed in getting the energy from top to bottom, it supple-
ments your total. If you mistime a drop, the energy pod is
lost. There are six pods on each deck. The problem is some
horrible ﬂickering scrolling which I found most off-putting.
These grumbles apart. Droids is a nice mixture of action
and strategy. It would be ideal for someone who found Im-
possible Mission a bit toe) hard.

of their Central Intelligence Units and are attempting to
blackmail the American Government. Unless the White
House gives in to the demands, the CIU will be blown sky
high. Fortunately, an agent discovered that the bomb was
hidden on the 62nd ﬂoor of a hotel and also learned the
special code necessary to stop the bomb from being deto-
nated. Unfortunately, he was then discovered but he did
manage to leave several clues dotted round the hotel waiting
for some brave agent to break in.
The hotel is split into units of eight ﬂoors and before you
can move to the next unit, you (for it was you that was fool-
hardy enough to volunteer) must discover the location of the
key to the emergency exit. This is owned by the porter who
will quite willingly give it up if you can ﬁnd him. This is no
easy task though as ﬁrst, you must search the furniture for a
pass key that will let you open all the doors of the hotel and
discover their contents. The hotel is also infested with enemy
agents who will shoot on sight if you don't eliminate them
ﬁrst. You can also leap and duck out of the way of stray
bullets as well as ﬁring from a normal and low position.
The hotel is full of features to be examined and explored.
You need to ﬁnd the various bits of password that will help
defuse the bomb. There is money to be found which can be
spent at the bar or gambled away in a game of dice. Clues are
also hidden in furniture although you should be careful
exactly what you examine. An electric socket gives a nasty
shock if you insist on looking at it too closely and you can
also have fun with the ﬁre extinguishers. Movement through
the hotel is by a series of lifts hence the title of the game.
Although it sounds fairly simple to play, believe me it's
not and you will ﬁnd yourself getting wasted fairly
frequently. The graphics are colourful and quite well ani-
mated, especially the enemy agents. k  nice original arcade
adventure that -even though it is very difﬁcult to ﬁnish, is
very simple to play and always demands 'just one more go'.

inside an ancient tomb where there are statues and weird
creatures and of course, the inevitable mummies?
There is another in that genre and it lacks a lot of origi-
nality and is really quite tedious.
Once you've worked out how to play the game and how
the controls work you're halfway there.
The character which you control (looking absolutely
nothing like Indiana Jones!) can walk left and right and
jump. You'll need to get the hang of jumping as SOOn as pos-
sible because there are some very wide gaps to negotiate. If
you fall down the stair gaps it doesn't matter but if you fall in
a sandpit then you dissolve very quickly and lose a life.
You can also walk behind the stairs if you jump as you
are approaching them so there aren't as many dead ends as
First impressions create. If you stand behind the stairs then
you're safe from the monsters too. This is quite handy as you
can wait till there are less of them around to kill you before
you cautiously emerge.
Other traps include bars which come down on you jus4 as
you walk beneath them and giant saws which do likewise.
I lowever, these can be slowed down considerably by nutting
buttons in the ceiling of the tunnel. There arc plenty of these
around all operating different traps so the best thing to do is
hit them whenever you see them.
You may ﬁnd that this game appeals to you, but on the
whole I think it's far too tedious. Even with the limited
memory available I think that more imagination could have
gone into it.

SPEED KING
The smell of petrol, the sound of powerful engines revving,
the odour of leather and sweat and the pumping of your
heart as you await the starter's signal. The crowd is tense, the
engines roar and the man-machine team moves as one at
unthinkable speeds.
Motorbike racing has had a lot o f coverage in the
computer games market but there is always room for a better
version of an old formula and Speed King has a lot going for
it in terms of excitement and addictiveness.
The lay out of the game is simple. You can choose from
four courses: Hockenheim, Monza, Silverstone or Paul
[beard. They all look similar though the sky and track are in
different colours and some are slightly longer. Not being
familiar with these famous circuits 1 cannot tell whether they
are authentically reproduced here.
Once you have chosen your course you appear at the
starting line and off you go.
At the top of the screen is all the information you need to
check up on your progress. You are told your speed, gear,
time, which lap you are currently on and your position in
relation to the other 19 riders.
To get your speed up you have to work your way to top
gear. Maximum speed is 240mph. Once you have the hang of
the steering and you have perfected your overtaking
technique then there should be no stopping you. Having said
that. I haven't yet completed a race without coming off.
When you do crash you disappear in a ball of ﬂame and then
miraculously reappear unharmed to take up the challenge
where you left off.
One quite major criticism of this game is the ease in
which you can hold the lead. This may sound pretty but once
you have the knack of controlling your bike it is a fairly
simple matter to put yourself ahead of the ﬁeld and stay
there. As long as you keep your speed above 200mph then
there's no way any of the other bikes can catch up. In once
race I actually took the lead in the ﬁrst lap and held it for the
complete ﬁve lap race. I never saw another rider! This means
that the circuit gets a little tedious especially as you don't
even seem to be able to lap anyone.
Having said all this the game was a big hit in the ofﬁce.
It's possible to set up some quite good tournaments by
attempting to beat the lap record. I've played it a lot and I'd
play it again since setting new objectives - not crashing at all,
beating the course record, or your friends best time -.gives it

from Gremlin, is back in this game for the C16.
Having seen the 64 version some time ago, I was looking
forward to this and it wasn't a disappointment.
The graphics are quite colourful and effective and the
little character, although looking more like a short, squat
teddy bear than any mole I've ever seen, is quite agile and can
take any number o f  falls seemingly without physical
damage.
As a platform game, it is, of course, full of all the usual
hazards. There are numerous ﬂoating alien type beings who
must be avoided. In fact it is advisable to give them a very
wide berth since some of them seem to have a force ﬁeld
around them which is as deadly as the beasties themselves.
Others can be approached without much danger except
when you actually touch them. When you die there is a
ghastly crunching sound that makes you feel as if all your
bones are being ground to pulp. Not very nice.
One danger worth watching for is the pistons which
shoot down at irregular intervals and squash you to pieces.
On one screen it is impossible to avoid this untimely death if
you walk on at the wrong place. I managed to die in exactly
the same place three times before I sorted this out.
Despite the fact that this game is not really original
(think of a platform game and all the classic qualities are
here), it has an addictiveness which is difﬁcult to explain. If
you've got a CI6 and a bit of spare cash then I thoroughly
recommend this game. Treat yourself.

BEYOND THE FORBIDDEN FOREST
Connoisseurs of C64 games may remember the excellent
Forbidden Forest of a couple of years ago. Well, you guessed
it, this is the sequel. For those of you not lucky enough to see
the original the game went something like this. You armed
with your trusty bow and arrow must run through the
forbidden forest avoiding and killing the monsters that are
out to get you. The nasties appeared in waves and such
creatures as giant frogs and skeletons were after you.
When this program ﬁrst appeared a bit of an outcry
developed in some of the magazines since the graphics in the
game were extremely gruesom, especially the spurting blood
when you killed or were killed. Well you'll no doubt be
pleased to know that Beyond the Forbidden Forest offers
the same amount of horror but with an even better game.
According t o  th e  instruction sheet, Beyond th e
Forbidden Forest is a game written in four dimensions. The
four dimensions are described as the-following. Left and
right movement as you would expect and the passage octime
as with the original game, but now you can also move into
and out o f the background. This means that instead of
simply running left and right in front of all the objects it is
now possible to run behind them to hide from a monster or
simply charge into the background to attack a particularly
ugly looking monster. This added dimension certainly adds
something to the game and makes it all the more difﬁcult to
play. One extremely nice touch is the way that both'You and
the monsters get smaller as you move 'into' the picture, the
fact that you get smaller the farther away you are is
something that many games overlook.
As previously mentioned you are armed with a bow and
arrow. Controlling this at ﬁrst is a little bit of a problem but
you soon become used to it. The reason that it is a little trick
is that on a press of the ﬁre button your aim is taken
alternately higher and lower, whatever position you release
the ﬁre button in is the height that your arrow is ﬁred at.
Once you are used to this then control is excellent though at
the start of the game you will no doubt ﬁnd your precious
arrows ﬂying off nowhere near the monster.
As for the monsters, well you couldn't hope to meet a
more disgusting bunch. Firstly you'll have to face the worms
which pop out of the ground with a frequency that tells you
that they certainly don't like you. Get too close to one of
these and you're sure to be pulled under ground for dinner.
Watch the screen and you'll soon see the worm re-appear

and regurgitate what is left of you back into the playing area,
told you the game was blood thirsty.
Once you have dispatched the worms it's on to the
dragonﬂy. Again take careful aim before this enormous
sized ﬂy carries you off for its dinner, accompanied by the
usual gory effects of course. Following its on to face the
chimera.
As you kill a monster then some mysterious power gives
you a golden arrow, to use later in the game. Should you
loose a life then arrows are taken away and you are re-
incarnated to ﬁght once more.
Once evening arrives, and if you have enough arrows,
then its off to ﬁght the monsters in the underground caverns.
Firstly you have to face the bats swooping at you from all
directions. Next comes the hydra, a four headed monster
breathing ﬁre at you from each mouth, not a pretty sight.
Should you ever defeat this then it's on to face the ultimate
monster 'The Demonorgon', ﬁring bolts of ﬁre at you from
each eye this is a monster that must be despatched very
quickly, if not then it will certainly despatch you.
Playing Beyond the forbidden forest is rather like playing
the part o f the hero in some epic horror movie. The
animation of the monsters is excellent and the atmospheric
music certainly helps set the scene.
If you aren't squeamish then I suggest that this is one
game that is a must in your collection. However, don't play it
too late at night. you never know what might happen.

W.A.R.
Scrolling space battle games certainly received a boost in
popularity when Uridium appeared. W.A.R. is certainly a
variant on this theme complete with gigantic scrolling
spaceship, enemy craft hot on your tail and of course lots of
things to shoot.
At ﬁrst glance W.A.R. does seem to offer a great deal of
excitement with an excellent scrolling background and lots

of enemy lighters, its only after playing it for a short while
that the tedium sets in.
The actual scenario for the game is a chain of cylinders,
the inside of which is a complete city. Your job is to destroy
each of 20 cylinders each of which has a speciﬁc purpose.
When your ship enters a cylinder a self destruct timer is
initiated. After this timer has run down an escape portal
opens for the enemy to escape through, you must get to this
and follow them through before the ship cylinder blows up.
Actually making it to the portal is, on the ﬁrst level
anyway, a  piece o f  cake. The enemy ﬁghters aren't
particularly nasty and aren't that quick. However once you
reach the portal things are a little different. Before you can
go through the portal you must de-code the colour lock. Not
an easy task. To decode the lock you must shoot all of the
coloured squares that re the same colour as the top line of the
screen. Oh, and the blocks are moving. After many hours of
playing I  must admit that getting through the lock is
extremely difﬁcult i t not nearly impossible. I  can't help
thinking that the programmers simply added this stage of the
game to make life a little more interesting, after all the ﬁrst
level is extremely easy. It is extremely irritating to ﬁnd that
you survived a level only to loose your ship because you can't
get past the lock. I rarely lost a life while battling it out on the
cylinder.
In my view W.A.R. is a game that had a lot of potential
which failed to come through. Summing up best done by
quoting someone who played the game by saying 'it's a 2nd
class Uridium'.

MIAMI VICE
Programs based around TV or ﬁlm titles are bound to sell on
their titles alone. This is obviously a good thing for the
software houses, but I can't help wondering how the buyers
will feel if the game doesn't live up to their expectations.
Miami Vice, as its name suggests, is based upon that
extremely popular TV series of the same name. Crocket and
Tubbs have heard that a shipment of contraband is due in
town. Your job is to get out on the streets and ﬁnd the
contraband.
You are supplied with a set of possible meeting places for
the gangsters involved with this caper, together with the
times that the gangsters may be there.
Now appears the ﬁrst problem. You have a drive around
town and try to reach a meting place where the gangsters
may be, at the correct time of course. Having worked for
quite a while in this town you would have thought that our
heroes would know their way around. Not so, ﬁnding the
correct bar is a feat in itself, nevermind getting there at the
correct time. My advice is to spend your ﬁrst few hours
playing the game making a map. I say hours, as the playing
area is extremely large and it is very difﬁcult to drive around.
Ocean has obviously realised this, since, a few days after
the game arrived, they sent me a map of the city with all of
the bars etc. marked upon it. This was a godsend as I must
admit without it I would have tired of the game extremely
R EVIEWS
Y OUR CO MMO DO RE  november 1986:61
quickly and probably never have got as far as meeting a
criminal.
Driving around the town presents quite a big problem as
there seems to be something fundamentally wrong with the
design of the car. If you were driving down the road with a
car of your left and you wanted to turn right, you would
think that there would be no problems. Wrong, turn your car
to the right and your back end will swing out clonking the
other car and sending you back to the start. If you should
drive close to the edge of the road and try to turn away from
it the same happens. This makes it impossible to turn in
certain circumstances, the only option open to you is to
crash. Now I don't know about you but I've never been in a
car that suffered from this problem.
Once you actually reach your destination, if you ever do,
you have to be very careful of the time. If you arrive too early
the crooks will spot your car and drive off. If you enter a
meeting just as it starts then the crooks will have ﬂed leaving
the evidence behind. If you enter four to eight minutes after a
meeting has started then you may ﬁnd a crook carrying
evidence. If you enter eight to 12 minutes after a meeting has
started then the location will be deserted, though if you leave
quicky enough you may spot the crooks in their getaway car
and give chase through the streets ﬁring at them out of your
window.
Overall control of the game is quite simple, even if the
actual game play is complicated, though a large number of
options are available from the joystick (shoot, leave car etc.).
The graphics, though not brilliant, in the road scenes are
adequate with a superb smooth scrolling city background
seen from above. The meeting places, bars, are quite well
detailed and searching through the rooms looking for the
crooks and evidence is quite atmospheric.
Fans of the TV series will no doubt turn up their TV's
volume as the familiar TV theme and rock music is played by
the computer, played at a  high volume this does add
something to chasing around town looking for crooks.
I can't help thinking that due to the fact that the game
lacks a little in playability it will hold your interest for little
time. Miami Vice suffers from a severe case of 'nice idea,
shame about the game'.

POWERPLAY
There have been many attempts to bring question and
answer quizzes to computer screens but most have tried to
copy Trivial Pursuit too closely. Powerplav forsakes the pie
slice board game to provide a new and exciting recipe.
The screen display is taken up by a chessboard matrix in
a classical setting like Ancient Greece. At the corners of the
board stand two pieces and the idea of the game is to conquer
your challengers by superior general knowledge and fast
reﬂexes.
The questions appear beneath the board and the four
optional answers appear. Whichever option you think is
correct can be selected by keyboard or joystick and the
answer affects the boardgame.
A correct answer allows you to move one of your pieces
one square on the board or to increase its power. When two
opposing pieces are on adjacent squares a challenge can be
issued. The combatants must prepare to spot the correct
answer to randomly selected questions and the one who wins
diminishes the power of the opponents piece. If the pieces are
both very strong, the speed battle must be repeated on
successive moves until one of the players decides that it is
time to run for cover before his character is destroyed.
Flashing squares around the board act as a teleport
device which allows fast movement around the board to
another ﬂashing square. This is especially useful for a ﬂeeing
piece, as long as it doesn't take it to a square near an even
more powerful foe.
The questions are varied and taxing with three sets
available with the game. Also included is a question base
compiler which allows you to construct your own quiz. This
is especially useful for families where children would ﬁnd the
questions far too difﬁcult. A quiz centred around nursery
rhymes or even school work would turn the drudgery of
learning into a pleasure.
When we played the game in the ofﬁce the interest was
high with everyone trying to get in on the action. This is the
supreme accolade which few games seem to achieve and even
fewer manage to sustain. Perhaps its addictive qualities
derive from the ability to clobber your opponent with
superior knowledge, or even by successful guesswork, but it
certainly has pulling power.
The graphics are quite cute with the pieces evolving from
a lower warrior towards a top ranking minotaur. Once the
higher eschelon has been reached further correct _answers
merely add to its strength and very powerful battles can be

joined at the climax of the game.
Although the game is well devised and professionally
executed I still don't feel that the ultimate game of this type
has been achieved. Powerplay goes a long way along the
road towards the deﬁnitive work and as it stands is on a par
with US Gold's Mind Pursuit. Together these games are
streets ahead of their rivals but the road is long.

PARALLAX
Y
scientists have landed on an artiﬁcial world. Everything was
going well until you discovered some secret information that
showed that the inhabitants of this world were planning a
surprise attack on Earth. The once friendly natives immedi-
ately turn hostile and it is up to you to ﬁnd your fellow
scientists and an Intergalactic Teleport in order to make
good your escape.
The planet is divided into ﬁve main zones, alpha, beta,
gamma, delta and epsilon and there is one of your friends in
each zone. There are many other scientists in each zone and
you must capture or kill them in order to learn about the
password that will admit you to the next zone. These are to
be found in hangars which also contain computer banks,
shops and intelligence units. These can only be entered on
foot and so it is necessary to leave the relative safety of your
ship and wander round, making sure that you possess
enough oxygen and ammunition for your journey.
As you eliminate the scientists, so you can pick up their
data cards which serves you two useful purposes. Firstly, it
allows you access to part of the code, but it can then be
exchanged at the bank for a number of credits with which
you can then stock up on your requirements. You need to
capture one of the scientists but he will refuse to help you
unless you have acquired some drugs and use them on him.
Having explored your immediate surroundings on foot,
you will want to move elsewhere so it's back to your ship and
ready for take off. Your craft is highly manoeuvrable and
can ﬂy under as well as over certain parts of the superstruc-
ture. This is just as well as you are under constant attack
from the enemy forces. You can gain extra speed by ﬂying
through a black hole and can teleport to another part of the
zone again by ﬂying over the appropriate unit. You *yin
certainly need to activate your shields and remember to put
your landing gear down before you land again.
Parallax is a fast action packed shoot-em-up that will
certainly appeal to fans of the genre although I felt that the
different elements o f the game didn't quite ﬁt together
properly. The graphics are certainly very slick apart from an
appalling opening sequence which seems designed to induce
ﬁts of epilepsy with its stroboscopic effects.

occasions when the workman may be
bad because of his tools. Choosing a
joystick is far more than just stringing
along with the latest trend. Ponder on
the ergonomic complexities and you'll
soon appreciate the art of the joystick
maker.
Firstly there is the problem o f
which hand to use. Left-handedness is
no longer considered to be a sinister
defect so the perfect stick should be
symmetrical. I n  simple terms this
means that i f the ﬁre button is not
centrally positioned then there should
be two of them.
The second consideration is a little
more tricky because it depends on your
style o f play. Most people seem to
prefer holding the base in their weaker
hand while waggling the stick with the
other. Problem number one is how
large is the human hand? Obviously
there is no ﬁxed rule, all hands are
different and so this area is open to
much speculation.
As a student I worked on a Kit-Kat
production line where I learned that
the thickness of the chocolate bar is a
tenth of the span of the average adult
hand. As a  packer I  knew that a
handful of Kit-Kats woulds slot nicely
into a box, designed to hold 10, which
made the job extremely easy. What if
my hands were n o t  within th e
parameters of averageness? The result
would be cramp and aching muscles.
HARDWARE R EVIEWS
Pick of the
Sticks
I f  all that zapping has .
state of collapse then read on to ﬁnd out the best buys
for games players.
By Eric Doyle
So i t is with joysticks. Choose the
wrong size and your gameplay will
suffer.
Finally, w e  must consider the
sensitivity and robustness of the sticks
manufacture. Robustness is essential,
after a hard session of alien bashing. it
is very irritating to  ﬁnd that the
ultimate high score has been missed
because the stick has become detached
• from the base or because one of the
switches has failed, Some people really
give the control unit a lot of stick while
others prefer delicate movements. For
the former a  highly robust b u t
insensitive stick would sufﬁce but for
the latter a more subtle unit with less
'throw' would be best.
Unfortunately, most players are
joystick bashers but the Commodore
joysticks have all proved to lack the
Y OUR CO MMO DO RE  november 1986:65
necessary sturdiness. This has left the
ﬁeld wide open f o r  independent
companies to provide a range of sticks
to suit all tastes.
The Pro-Ace Competition Joystick
is probably one of the most physically
robust sticks on the market. I f  you
come from north of the Border you'll
appreciate that using this beast is akin
to stirring good thick porridge. In
other respects the stick is beautifully
designed. The base is small enough to
ﬁt comfortably in the hand and is
stable enough to stand on a desk top.
The ﬁr e  button i s  a  centrally
positioned bar which can easily be
operated by the side of the thumb. This
gives a better grip for the supporting
hand which is essential because the
stick takes some pushing and pulling
to make it work.
If you're not into bench presses and
weight lifting, the Micro-Ace is a better
bet. This is the same design as the Pro
except for one crucial difference. The
internal switches are not the crude leaf
switches of the cheaper unit and the
Micro label refers t o  the use o f
microswitches internally. These not
only ease the amount o f  pressure
required but are also less likely to fail.
Often differences between joysticks
only become obvious when you delve
inside. Ta ke  th e  Euromax a n d
Micropro. O n  the face o f  i t the
only difference is the shape of the twin
ﬁre buttons. Rather novel square
buttons on one and oversize round

ones on the other. Plug them in and
give them a  whirl and one thing
becomes very clear, the Micropro stick
is sluggish and the buttons less reliable.
Added to this the Euromax has a
continuous ﬁre button switch on the
back f o r  those games where
ammunition is not at a premium.
Both sticks use microswitches but a
look inside reveals that the Euromax
has a longer central spindle. This gives
better leverage on the switches and
means that less effort needs to be
applied in pushing the switch contacts
around, Compared to the Pro-Ace
either stick is easier to operate but the
bases are much larger and small ﬁngers
may' ﬁnd it easier to rest the stick on a
ﬁrm surface.
When is a stick not a stick? This
may sound like a nursery riddle but
just look at the Wiz Card and the Joy
Ball.
The Wiz Card is small, inexpensive
and innovative. Instead of the usual
macho stick protruding manfully from
its base, there is a small pad about the
size of a 10 pence piece. This can be
operated by the pressure of your ﬁnger
but is not as sensitive as a traditional
stick. Part of the problem is the way
the pad is positioned at the front of the
card. lithe ﬁre buttons and the pad
were transposed, the quality of the
card would increase. To test the theory
I turned my monitor upside down and
reversed the  card i n  m y  hand.
Immediately the  card felt more
comfortable a n d ,  despite t h e
eccentricity of the inverted screen, my
success rate increased.
As a serious game controller the
Wiz Card is not a general purpose unit.
Fast action leaves it behind but its neat
appearance does lend it to business
software o r  graphics a nd music
utilities. I n  these areas I  found I
HARDWARE R EVIEWS
actually preferred it to a joystick or a
mouse. Flat on the table it's as easy to
use as a doorbell, leaving one hand free
to scratch your head or hold your
coffee.
Hand-held is not a term applicable
to the Joy Ball. The size of the unit
makes it desirable to ﬁnd a nice ﬁat
surface. I've grown quite attached to
this monster. At ﬁrst I thought it was
all gimmick and no action hut a few
minutes practice soon proved me
wrong.
The Ball should not be confused
with the rotating joyballs used on
arcade machines. These are just mice
lying on their backs. The Joy Ball is
just an obese joystick and operates by
rocking it in the desired direction.
Because you don't have to grip it the
strain is less than with a conventional
stick and this makes it ideal for anyone
with manual disabilities.
I'm afraid that left handers will
ﬁnd the button positions awkward to
use but the ease with which the ball
rocks does mean that a weak right
hand could cope with this.
The array o f  buttons look
formidable a t  ﬁrst but they are
probably the best selection available.
The right hand pair are just normal
Y O UR C 
O

buttons but the left pair are rapid ﬁre
units. O n  shoot-em-ups the rapid
buttons are superb allowing speedy
salvos to be ﬁred, the other buttons are
available for more subtle applications.
To attempt t o  recommend a
joystick from this selection would be a
pointless task. It all depends on your
needs a n d  physical make u p .
Personally I prefer the Euromax and
the Joy Ball but I would recommend
that you search out a good retailer who
will let you try out a range of sticks.
The main criteria relate t o  the
sensitivity o f  the unit a nd how
comfortable you feel when using it.
Always make sure that the aliens are
going to come off worst at the end of
the day.

look out for new programs, hints and
tips. articles and even regular series. In
fact i f you have something that you
think could be of use to other Commo-
dore owners we want to hear about it.
So if you have got something which
you think we may be interested in.
How do you go about submitting it to
us?
Below you will ﬁnd a list of guide-
lines that will help us to deal with any
item that you send in to us, We don't
expect everybody t o  b e  the next
William Shakespeare but i f you do
follow these simple rules then it will
make our job a lot easier.
I) If possible all material sent to the
magazine should be typed or printed
out on a computer printer.
2) All text should be double spaced i.e.
there should be a blank line between
each line of text. You should also leave
a margin o f  about 1 0  characters
around the text.
3) On the very ﬁrst page you should
put the following:
Name of the article
Machine that it is for
Any extras required - disk, printer
etc.
Your name
Your address
Your telephone number
4) The top of every page should have
the following information on it:
Abbreviation of the article title
Your name
The page number
READERS SU BMISSIO N S
Contributions
So you own a Commodore? So you've
written some programs? So why haven't you
sent them to us?
For example, suppose y o u  h a d
submitted an article on C64 interrupts.
You should put something like the
following at the head of the page:
Interrupts/ISmith/1
5) Please make sure that you do not
make any additional marks on your
text especially underlining.
6) Try and write i n  clear concise
English, it does not have to be a work
of literature but it must be comprehen-
sible.
7) On the bottom of each page you
should put the word MORE i f there
are more pages to the article or ENDS
if it is the last page.
8) I f  possible, enclose a listing of all
programs.
9) Under •- no circumstances use a
staple to hold the pages together. Use a
paperclip instead.
10) Programs should be included on
either disk or tape. Make sure that you
SAVE two copies of every program so
that we have a better chance of loading
them if problems occur.
II) Programs under 10 lines can be
included in the text. If your program is
longer than this you must enclose a
disk or cassette,
12) I f  your article needs any artwork
then supply clear examples of what is
needed. We don't expect you to be an
artist but we do need to see what is
required.
YOUR COMMODORE  november 1986:67
13) Photographs, i f necessary, must
be either black and white prints or
colour slides. We can take shots our-
selves so don't worry about this too
much.
14) Submissions o f  any length are
welcome. If you have a ﬁve line routine
that you think may be o f  use to
someone else we welcome i t just as
much as a full blown six part series.
15) Payment varies quite a lot and de-
pends on quite a number of factors,
such a s  complexity o f  program,
presentation o f program, number of
magazine pages it takes up etc. Pay-
ment is generally between £10.00 and
1:800.00.
16) Al l  payments are made in the
month that the magazine containing
your article has appeared in print.
17) If we do ﬁnd your submission
suitable for inclusion in the magazine
we will write to you giving the terms of
publication, the rate of payment and
an agreement form. Prompt return of
this form will allow us to use your
program as soon as possible.
18) I f  you want the program return-
ing to you, should we ﬁnd it unsuitable
for publication, then yo u  should
enclose a  stamped self addressed
envelope.
19) The last and most important point
to make is 'get writing', we are waiting
for your articles.

Your comments on Your Commodore and everything else about computers.
I have recently obtained a C64 and
games are so dean l that I switched to
buying Mastertronic Software.
I have many titles (Finders Keepers.
Spooks, Zzzz, Kikstart„tfaster o f
Magic, Ice Palace, to name but a few)
and the quality of them is superb. great
instructions, brilliantly designed inlay
cards, not forgetting the game quality
itself. You get all this for the budget
price of £1.99.
I think that Mastertronic deserve a
medal for the games they produce.
Darren Kimber, Portsmouth
Praise indeed, Darren. Ever thought ofa
lob in PR? Anyone else got a bee in their
bonnet about a software house?
CP/Mystery
I have a C128 but at the moment the
CP/M mode is used very little, as I ﬁnd
it hard to see any programs for it.
When will the software houses bring
out databases, wordprocessors and
spreadsheets for it. If they have please
tell me who they are.
Could you run a monthly page for
the C P /M , please, t o  h e l p  u s
understand it better? I'm glad to see
that more 128 programs are now in
Your Commodore, excellent!
Lastly, What does CP/M stand
for?
David M. Thornton, Dundee
CP/M stands for Control Program for
Microprocessors. Not very helpful is it?
h's basically a system to make ﬁle
handling on disk a lot simpler. There are
several thousand C P /M  programs
available (it's been going since 1975).
Try Softworld, .5-7 For/ease Road,

Your regular reports on the latest from
Compunet a n d  M i c r o n e t  i n
Communications C o r n e r  h a s
sufﬁciently whetted my appetite to
become involved i n  the world o f
communications.
I have a C64 and I wish to buy a
modem to use with it. Please could you
tell me i f a Commodore modem can
access Micronet as well as Compunet?
Also, are there any other modems
available, apart from Commodore's
which a r e  capable o f  accessing
Compunet?
Before I go, 1 would just like to say
thank you for producing such a brilliant
mag - it's the only one on the market
which has interesting and informative
articles and reviews, and it's well worth
the money.
N J Adams, Dorchester
The Commodore modem is the only one
which till give you access to Compunet
and Micronet. Before you dash out and
buy one, cast an eye over our Club 128
special offer (it's for C64 users as well,
You know). Thanks for the kind words
and keep pounding the magazine!
Sweet C16?
I bought a new Commodore 16 but I
now ﬁnd that I can't get magazines for
it. Tell me why one can't get magazines
for the C16?
1 have looked from shop to shop,
also from town to town. I feel that I
should have been advised when I ﬁrst
bought the Commodore Starter Pack.
Rhydwyn Jones, Rhyll
Please could you inform me if Argus
has a  computer magazine fo r the
C16? I  feel th e  overpriced Your
Commodore really is a waste of time
for m y  requirements with only a
handful of pages in each edition. My
Y OUR COMMODORE  november 1986:69
view saying overpriced only means
that nearly all the mag is useless for me
and probably all other CI6 users.
I h a v e  p u r c h a s e d  Y o u r
Commodore for ﬁve months and have
found it far superior to ANY other
computer mag (e.g. Commodore
User). If a separate magazine could be
introduced for C16 owners it would ﬁll
a large hole i n  the Commodore
market.
Please tell my story to your readers
and see what other C16 owners feel...
INTRODUCE Y OU R  C OM M O-
DORE C16.
Kevin McBride, Lostock Hall
The problem with producing a  C16
magazine is principally one of ﬁnance.
The user base is not large enough to
support a dedicated magazine. I  know
many readers feel that the C stands for
Cinderella but we are doing our best to
ensure that you get the support you need
but we also have a growing family of
ugly sisters to support.
Build-a-Tape
In Your Commodore, March 86 issue,
you started th e  software service.
Would it be possible to publish 'Build
A Better Basic' on cassette tape since it
is an extremely long utility to type iti?
Graham Blissett, Kempshott
Sorry, Graham, w e don't have the
Rights to allow us to do this. You'll have
to risk the blisters and hack i t  in

SYS Ease
At present I  own a  Vi c 20+16K
switchable RAM pack, but I will be
getting a C128 soon. My question is
how can I get a small character to run
across the bottom o f the screen by
telling a part of the programme to SYS
this.

I kn o w  h o w  t o  d o  a  small
programme in Basic to do this but I
just don't know how to use the SYS
command and I  don't understand
machine code. So please could you
help m e  w i t h o u t  b e i n g  t o o
complicated.
Could you also give me some
advise o n  a  good machine code
teaching book, or aid, which is easy to
understand and doesn't cost an arm or
a leg.
C P McGowan, Kennington
Sorry CP, i f  you don't understand
machine code the SYS command is of no
great use to you. All it does is act like a
GOSUB but it's a  GOSUB into a
machine code program. To help you you
might like to try the DR Watson C64
Assembly Language Course fro m
Honeyfold, Bath Place, Barnet, London.
They ask me to point out that they don't
accept severed limbs as legal tender.
You could also give our Welcome to the

While writing f o r  yo u r 'U ti l i ty
Cassette', I thought a small note was in
order.
I am very impressed with your
magazine and the only reason I haven't
subscribed i s  t h e  tr e n d  o th e r
magazines have taken - game reviews!
Page after page of them. Please let the
other 'magazines' deal with these.
The best layout for me would be
documentary and original assembly/
Basic listing for large programs with a
monthly cassette and smaller type-in
programs to amuse o f  course this is a
personal view.
Otherwise, your choice of topics
are interesting and varied and at the
moment Your Commodore is the only
magazine worth buying. Please don't
slip.
K C Humphrey, Mime
It's nice to feel wanted. We have noted
the trend towards the lowest common
denominator in the micro world and, as
Y OUR COMMODORE  november 1986:70
you can see, it is not a path $ve wish to
tread. We do have games reviews but
these are part of our philosophy that all
work and no play...
Since your ideal describes our
magazine so accurately and we promise
not to slip. we look forward to receiving
your subscription in the near _Attire.

Y
adventure game in Basic. You have
been typing for over an hour and
decide that at the end of the next line,
you will save outyour work. Suddenly.
a quick power surge resets your 64 and
you are left with nothing. (Unless of
course you happen to have an OLD
program sat somewhere in memory —
and howmany of ushother to do that.)
That's just one of the hazards of
Basic programming. Hopefully, this
little program will come t o  your
rescue.
Before you start typing your Basic
program in, load up my AUTOSAVE
program ﬁrst. Typ e  N E W  then
activate with SYS52480. Now you
don't have to worry about continually
stopping to save out your work. Every
ﬁve minutes your work will be saved
out automatically, under the name of
PROGRAM. Once the program has
been saved control is returned back to
you. as if nothing had happened. Just
prior to the SAVE, you will hear a
warning tone, this is so that you can
stop typing whatever you're typing
and wait tbr the SAVE. So how does
the program work?
As you know, over sixtieth o f a
C64 PROGRAM
C64
Autosave
One of the most enduring problems which programmers
face is the loss of hours of work through human or
computer error. With this program you'll be able to save
time and a lot of frustration.
By Paul Eves
second the CPU stops whatever it's
doing and scans the keyboard and
STOP key. Luckily for us, the vector
that points to the interrupt routine lies
in RAM. This means, of course, that
we can change the vector address to
our own address. Therefore, every
sixtieth of a second the machine will do
what we want it to do before executing
its own interrupt routine.
And how do we do that?
The ﬁrst thing we must do is disable
the normal interrupts so that we can
change the vector address. I f  we
neglected to  d o  this, the machine
would cause an interrupt within an
interrupt and just lock up. After
changing the vector to point our own
routine, w e  th e n  re-enable th e
interrupts. The machine will now stop
over sixtieth of a second, perform our
amended interrupt, then continue with
the normal interrupt.
So, what i s  o u r new routine?
Firstly, we count down within a loop
for ﬁve minutes. (I could quite easily
have used the system clock under inter-
rupt for this, but this way is shorter
and neater.) I f  it's less than ﬁve
minutes then the routine breaks out to
Y OUR COMMODORE  november 198672
the normal keyboard scan interrupt
routine at SEAM.
Once the countdown has reached
the ﬁve minute mark the routine jumps
to the warning tone routine. Here our
friend SID performs three short beeps
before jumping to the save routine.
The screen is then cleared and the
KERNAL routines SETLFS, SET-
NAM and SAVE are called one by one.
To make the program ﬂow easier to
follow. I  have incorporated a name
save for both TAPE and DISK. (Obvi-
ously, tapes don't need a  name in
reality). After the save, the interrupts
are set back to our routine once again
and away the program goes.
Naturally the program could be
expanded to incorporate a number of
things. For example, you could have a
LIST or a LOAD command put on to
the F keys as well as the forced save.
Obviously the more things that your
interrupt has to perform, the slower
the program becomes. (And it's not
really good practice to rely too heavily
on interrupts.)
I must say that I've found this
program very helpful indeed. I just
hope you'll get as much use out of it as
I have.

U
assembler entering machine code data
is a real problem. Since machine code
is simply a series of numbers, entering
them into your computer leads to all
sorts o f  errors, resulting in your
program's total inability to functions.
Your Commodore uses Basic
loaders t o  help people t o  enter
machine code programs from the
magazines. These Basic loaders hold
the numbers that make up the machine
code program in a line of data, the last
number being a checksu in. The Loader
program when RUN, reads the DATA
into memory, adding each number
together, then the total of each line is
compared with its checksum, if they
are not the same then you have done
something wrong.
In the March 1986 issue of Your
Commodore we  printed a  Basic
program for the 64 (Datamaker) that
would read a machine code ﬁle from
disk and generate a  machine code
program. This worked ﬁne except for a
couple of small problems. Firstly the
program was very slow. Secondly, you
had to have a disk drive to use it.
With this article we are printing
two new machine code t o  data
statement conversion programs. One
of them is for the C64 but this time the
program is written in machine code
and will now take machine code from
memory as well as from disk. The
second program is for the Cl28, this
program isn't quite as fast as the one
for the C64 but it does have the
advantage that it generates its own
SAVE routine at the end of the data so
that, when RUN, the program will
SAVE the machine code on to disk.
C64 Data Maker
As I mentioned earlier, this version of
the data maker program is better than
the old one. A further facility that has
been added is an extra check in the
C64 AND C 1281
CI
Datamaker
Turn your machine code into Data with these two
programs from M. Catley and K. °non.
loader program. If, in the old version
of the program, you omitted a number
from a line of DATA, the computer
would read the checksum and try to
POKE i t  into memory. Since the
checksum is usually greater than 255
this resulted in an illegal quantity error
in the line that held the POKE
statement.
This new version of the program
has a check that stops the program if
the number to be POKEd into memory
is greater than 255, giving the line from
which the DATA was read, not the line
of the POK E statement. As you can see
this makes ﬁnding typing errors even
easier.
The CM Datamaker is presented
here in the form of a Basic loader. In
fact the program was used to make this
loader.
As already mentioned this is a
machine code ﬁle that should be
WADed and RUN at memory location
49152 ($C000 hex).
To start the program you enter the
following commands:
NEW
SYS 49152
As soon as you press RETURN the
screen will clear and a promt 'INSERT
READER PROGRAM Y / N '  will
appear. I f  yes is selected the simple
loader program shown in Figure I will
be entered into memory.
Data maker will work out the last

memory, add 10 to it and start its own
numbering from there. This allows
DATA statements to be added on to
an existing program.
Once the reader has been entered
or if no (N) was selected a second
prompt • S E LE C T D I S K  O R
MEMORY' will be displayed.
If MEMORY is selected further
prompts for start and end addresses
will be displayed. These numbers may
be entered in decimal or in hex by
preﬁxing the number with a  dollar
sign.
If DISK is selected a ﬁlename will
be requested.
Once the end has been reached
Data Maker will insert the number of
blocks, line number and memory start
address into the reader part (only if the
reader was entered of course.) It will
then return to Basic with the READY
prompt.
Data Maker 128
Data Maker 128 is a utility program
for the C128 computer with a disk
drive. The program will take any ﬁle,
the SOURCE program, from the disk,
convert it into DATA statements and
write it back to the disk under a
supplied ﬁlename, the TA R GET
program. You will also be requested to
supply a START LINE NUMBER and
an increment value for the DATA
STATEMENTS. Twenty individual

DATA VALUES will be saved on each
line, followed b y  a  computer
checksum. All values are in HEX.
On completion of the conversion of
the program the Data Maker will save
a LOADER on to  the end o f  the
TARGET program so  that when
LOADed it is ready to RUN.
Whilst the program is running, it
will display th e  D I S K  ERROR
CHANNEL, the ADDRESS being
read, and the BYTE value o f  the
contents of that address. This tends to
slow down the program slightly, but
was considered necessary as it can be a
lengthy process to  convert a  long
machine code program i n to  data
statements, and one could think the
program had crashed. For the same
reason, the loader put on to the end of
the target program will display both
the ADDRESS being processed and
the BYTE being POKEd into that
address. After RUNning the TARGET
program, a ﬁlename will be requested.
This is the name under which the
loader w i l l  save th e  assembled
program to disk.
The new program, TARGET, is
now ready for use. Simply LOAD it
into a  C I  28 and type RUN. The
machine code then be POKED into
memory and SAVEd on to disk as a
machine code ﬁle, i.e. the same as the
original SOURCE program.
Hints and Tips
For some time we have been using
Basic loaders for most of our machine
code programs in Your Commodore.
Inevitably we have o f course come
across some problems and below you
will ﬁnd some little tricks that we use
to overcome these difﬁculties.
Quite often the program that we
wish to convert from machine code to
DATA statements is too big to ﬁt in
the computer's memory a t  once.
Obviously this is more likely to be a
problem for CM owners than those
using a C128 since more memory is
available on the Cl28.

Obviously this is more likely to be a
problem for CM owners than those
using a Cl28 since more memory is
available on the C128.
When the program is too big you
will have to split it into segments. To
do this you will require access to a
machine code monitor, C128 owners
C64 AND C128111
CEO
have one built in, C64 owners will have
to LOAD One or use one from many
of the cartridges that are available.
Before you can split the program
you will of course have to know the
START AD D R ESS a n d  E N D
ADDRESS o f  the machine code
program.
Use the S command in the monitor
to SAVE your program into a number
of equal parts. Then use the Data
Maker programs to change each part
into separate Basic loaders.
When you want to use the machine
code program generated by the DATA
statements you will have to LOAD
each o f the Basic loaders into your
computer one at a time and RUN
them. If you want to get a little clever
you can put an auto load at the end of
each of the programs. Figure 2 gives an
example of the type of loader that we
Y O U R  C O M M O D O R E  n o v e mb e r  1986: 77
use in Your Commodore. The program
breaks down as follows.
Line 5000 prints the keyword 'NEW'
and the command LOAD FILE,8,1 on
to the screen.
Line 5010 prints the keyword 'RUN*,
four lines further down the screen.
Line 5020 POKES three carriage
returns into the keyboard buffer which
starts at location 631. The number of
characters in the keyboard buffer is
then POK Ed into memory location
198, This location is the counter for the
number of characters in the keyboard
buffer. The cursor is then moved to the
top o f  the screen and the program
ends.
Because there is a RETURN in the
keyboard buffer the computer thinks
that you have typed the keyword NEW
and erases the program. The next
RETURN i n the buffer makes the

computer think that you have typed
LOAD FILE,8,1 so it will go off to the
disk drive and L OAD  the program
called ﬁle. There is one carriage return
left in the keyboard buffer. The cursor
is now over the keyword RUN and
when the RETURN is executed the
computer thinks you have typed RUN.
Simple isn't it?
If you are confused read the
explanation again and play around
with the program in FIGURE 2.
Quite often you will come across a
program which when the loader for it
is RUN, proceeds to POKE itself into
the same memory locations as the
loader program. This of course will not
work. I n  order t o  overcome this
problem you have to move the start of
Basic so that the Loader program and
the machine code will be a t tw o
different memory locations. Memory
locations 43 and 44 (45 and 46 on the
CI 28) hold the start of Basic. Location
43 holds the low byte off the address
and location 44 holds the high byte.
The following formulae can be used to
work out the numbers to be POKED
into the relevant memory locations:
LOW BYTE = ADDRESS - 256* INT
(ADDRESS/256)
HIGH BYTE =  IN T (ADDRESS/
256)
Where address is the memory location
where you want Basic to start
One further point worth raising is
that the memory location before the
start of Basic should always contain a
zero. For example if you had moved
Basic t o  memor y  loc ation 2000,
location 1999 should be POK Ed with a
zero.
Commodore 128 owners have an
advantage over C64 owners when it
comes to SAVEing a prograrn, they
have a machine code SAVE instruc-
tion in Basic 7.0 as well as the one in
the monitor. C64 owners have to resort
to POKEing into memory yet again.
We have already said that locations
43 and 44 hold the start o f Bask.
Memory locations 45 and 46(47 and 48
on the CI 28) hold the memory address
of' the end of Basic. Whenever a SAVE
is performed the computer looks at
these memory loca-tions to see what
area of  memory it  should SAVE to
whatever device you are using. If you
POKE these memory locations with
the start address and end address of
your machine code program you will
be able t o  SAVE y our  code. T he
C64 AND C12811
memory locations should be POKEd
with the following values:
43 low byte of start address
44 high byte of start address
45 low byte of end address
46 high byte of end address
The formulae already given can be
used to work out the numbers to be
POKE&
Of course, since you have moved
Basic, you will not be able to list any
programs in Basic memory until you
reset the memory locations to their
original values.
One more problem that you may
come across i s  the fact that the
machine code program to be turned
into DATA statements sits at the same
memory location as the Data Maker

page at the sight o f an acronym or
unless you've been holidaying on Mars
for the last three years, you must have
heard of MIDI. If you have bravely
tackled articles about MID I and are
still feeling left out in the cold you may
be forgiven f o r  thinking th a t a
conspiracy is afoot to keep MIDI and
its secrets out o f the hands o f the
computer-owning public.
The fact is, there has really been no
down-to-earth source of information
about MID! and rather than spend (or
waste?) a couple of pages explaining
what i t  i s, most magazines have
plunged straight i n  w i th  M I D I
equipment reviews leaving many
readers stranded at the start. Let's try
to put that right. Explanations Initl;
the reviews will follow in Part Two.
What is MIDI?
MIDI i s an acronym fo r Musical
Instrument Digital Interface. It was
designed and developed b y  major
musical instrument manufacturers
such a s  Sequential. Roland a n d
Yamaha to overcome the problem of
linking together instruments produced
by d i ffe re n t companies. Ea ch
manufacturer has its own individual
instrument design and prior to MIDI
the chances o f  mix-and-matching
without expensive interface equipment
were remote. MIDI laid down rules by
which musical information could be
standardised i n  digital fo rm a n d
transmitted and received thorugh DIN
sockets. Instruments have at least two
such sockets: M ID I IN  and M ID I
OUT. Many also have a MIDI THRU
socket which passes on information
received via MID I IN. This enables
you to  daisy chain together several
pieces of equipment.
MU SIC
Midi Music
and You
Ian Waugh brings you MID I without tears and explains
how Commodore owners are the luckiest people in the
musical world.
In its simplest form MIDI works
like this: if you connect the MIDI OUT
of keyboard one to the MIDI IN of
keyboard two, the ﬁrst keyboard will
transmit musical data down the cable
and you will be able to  splay' the
second keyboard from the ﬁrst.
The ﬁrst keyboard is known as the
Master and you could connect other
keyboards to  the system b y using
MIDI THRU sockets. M ID I really
comes into its own, though. when
under computer control. As the signals
are digital, what better way to control
them than with a computer.
Signals
The nature of MIDI signals sometimes
causes confusion. It is important to
realise that they are not audio signals
but digitals signals, the zeros and ones
of computer language. They control
the pitch and alter the instrument's
performance controls such as pitch-
bend, modulation ( f o r  vibrato),
sustain, volume, velocity, sensitivity
(the hard:r you hit a key, the louder
the note) after touch (pressing a key
down further after playing i t  t o
produce wow or delayed vibrato, etc.)
and patch changes.
Not all MIDI instruments have all
these facilities and it's important to
realise that you can't produce after
touch fo r  example on a  keyboard
which does not have it built-in. Many
drum machines and effects units such
as echo and reverb now have MID! so
you can put these under computer
control, too.
It wouldn't be terribly useful if you
coud only control one instrument at a
time - a sequencer could do that - so
the MIDI speciﬁcation permits up to
16 different messages to be sent at
once. Each message, carrying its own
Y OUR COMMODORE  november 1986:81
pitch and modulation information
etc., is sent on a different channel, and
the receiving instruments can be 'tuned
in' to the channel you want them to
respond to. Actually. MID I data is
transmitted serially s o  although
information on all channels is not
technically sent together i t's fast
enough to seem like it.
When information is transmitted, a
code is sent to identify which channel
the message i s  meant fo r. Mo st
instruments allow you t o  set the
channel they w i l l  broadcast a n d
receive on and they will ignore data
intended fo r other channels. Under
computer control you will normally
allocate a different channel to each
musical part e.g. channel one for the
bass, channel two for strings, channel
three for lead synth. etc. The software
will then send the parts to the right
instruments.
In Use
It is not essential to know how MIDI
works in order to use it and although
the principles are quite simple the
implementation ca n  appear  quite
daunting. For example, it is necessary
to literally spell o u t every single
operation you want an instrument to
perform - much as you must spell out
everthing to  a computer. There's a
MIDI code for turning a note on and
one for turning it off, Some operations
such a s after touch require large
amounts o f information which can
quickly u s e  u p  th e  computer's
memory. Some software gives you the
option o f  ignoring such memory-
hungry features.
Normally the software will take
care of all these functions,for you but
some programs, especially editing
packages, let you get right down to

such nitty gritty. It can be useful and it
certainly has its place but many MIDI
uses make music quite happily without
delving so deep.
The Lingo
Like other aspects o f  music and
computers, MIDI has its own jargon.
It is important to distinguish between
channels, as previously referred to,
and tracks. Tracks works in a similar
way to the tracks on a multi-track tape
recorder - only you can do more with a
MIDI track in a computer than you
can with an audio track on tape.
Software packages will generally allow
you to record on four, six, eight or 16
tracks and each track can be assigned
to play on a different channel.
Like audio tracks, MIDI tracks can
be merged (or bounced in the case Of
tape) but unlike audio tracks, they can
also be transposed with no alteration
in tempo and the tempo can be
changed with no alteration in pitch.
You can do lots of other things with
MIDI data, too, even play a piece
backwards, and each software package
often has its own specialities.
MID I modes
There's one more aspect o f  MID I
control which causes n o  end o f
confusion and that is MID I modes.
These affect the way an instrument
responds to the channel selection. The
two main modes are the ones you are
most likely to use. The ﬁrst is OMNI
OFF/POLY mode. In this mode the
instrument will receive polyphonic
music (i.e. many notes at once) only on
its set MIDI channel (one to 16). I f
OMNI was ON the instrument would
pick up data on all channels which
could sound like chaos.
The other main mode is OMNI
OFF/MONO. This is usually only of
use with multi-timbral instruments.
Not many of us have 16 instruments to
plug into our computer but some
keyboards are able to sound more than
one voice at once -  under computer
control -  and these are known as
multi-timbral. The most well-known
and among the cheapest are Casio's
CZ range which includes the CZ101
(around 000) and CZ1000 (around
E400). Sequential also produce multi-
timbral instruments as do JVC and
with luck more will continue t o
appear.
Mono means only one note will
sound at a time and in MONO mode,
Plugging In
Software
M
the instrument will play a number of
different lines, each with a different
voice. Each voice will be receiveing on
a different MID I channel and will
play, o f course, only one noite at a
time. Multi-timbral instruments were
made for MIDI and are a fairly cheap
way to get started. Typically. as in the
channel example, you could program
one voice to play a bass line, another to
play a guitar lead line, the third could
play a string line and the fourth could
play arpeggios on a ﬂute.
When we talk o f instruments being
plugged into the computer, they are
not plugged i n  d i re ctl y. T h e
connection i s  made vi a  a  M I D I
interface, one end of which plugs into
the computer, normally the cartridge
port on the C64. Depending upon its
complexity and sophistication. the
interface will contain a  number o f
sockets. The main ones, which all
interfaces have, are M ID I I N  and
MIDI OU T which connect to  the
MIDI IN and MIDI OUT sockets on
an instrument. Many interfaces also
have a MIDI THRU which performs
the same function as the MIDI THRU
on an instrument as described earlier.
Some interfaces have a Sync to
Tape socket which allows an audio
pulse from a multi-track tape recorder
to control the speed of the music so
several overdubs can be made on to
tape in time with each other. A Clock
In enables an external source such as a
drum machine to control the speed of
the music. These and other controls
can often be bought as separate units if
your particular interface does not
possess them as standard.
There are two main types o f MIDI
software. The ﬁrst and most common
type allows yoiu to record and play
back music. The second kind helps you
program the voices on digital synths.
Most modern digital synthesisers are
not as easy to program as analogue
machines. Th e i r parameters a re
usually displayed as numbers and
often you can only alter one parameter
at a time. The problem is really only
fully appreciated when yo u  start
creating sounds yourself.
Y OUR CO MMO DO RE  november 1986:82
Voicing Programs give a n  o n
screen graphic representation o f
parameters and often let you alter
more than one control at a time. You
can usually save the voice to disk; a
good way o f building up a sound
library. You can save a fortune on a
plug in RAM packs, often enough to
pay for the software. The Yamaha DX
range and Casio's C Z synths have
beneﬁted most from such packages
which are really worth considering if
you have one of these synths.
The music-making packages fall
into two groups: real-time and step-
time. Real time is when you enter notes
by playing the keyboard - in real-time,
obviously. Step-time is when you enter
notes one at a time either from the
synth keyboard or from the computer.
Real time is faster but you get
everything you play, warts and all.
However, you don't need to  be a
Paderewski or a Rick Wakeman to use
real-time software. Thanks to MIDI
you can record a piece slowly and
speed it up to its correct tempo. You
can even play 'impossible' pieces this
way and impress your friends no end.
If you can't quite get your left hand
and right hand to work together, you
can record th e m separately o n
different tracks and merge them when
they are note-perfect. Using similar
methods you can record a  piece
requiring four - or mre - hands to play.
Step-time i s  obviously mo re
accurate but you need a little patience
to put i n  all the notes. Different
software packages take different
approaches to step-time input. If you
are a musician, you may prefer to enter
the notes in traditional notation on a
stave. If you are entering music from a
written score yo u  ma y ﬁnd this
advantageous, too.
Other programs adopt a  more
computer-orientated approach a n d
display note information as a note plus
octave number with a value for its
duration and a value for its 'on' time,
i.e. how long the 'key' is held down.
You will also need to enter data such as
patch changes a n d  modulation
information, something which real-
time input normally does as you play.
This can take a little getting used to
and the non-musician probably has an
advantage over the musician here. n

data can be input into your code by
means of the ROM routines.
The trivial method of inputing data
is to POKE values into the relevant
locations used b y  the code. This
method is good enough and may be
mandatory i f  you're using a Basic
driver program and you want to use a
compiler. Those o f  you with more
reﬁned taste will want something
better.
One of the most important routines
in the Basic ROM starts at $AD9F•
This evaluates input expressions and
checks the syntax. There are a large
number of entry points to this routine
which can be used for our beneﬁt.

Getting into M/C
There are tw o  commands fo r the
accessing of machine code from Basic.
First we have the USR command. It's
fuill syntax is:
Variable — USR(expression)
The expression within the brackets is
evaluated a n d  stored i n  FA C /1
(ﬂoating point accumulator no I). This
value is then used in your code. The
entry point of your code must ﬁ
stored in the vector in locations $0310
to $0312. On leaving the routine, the
value in FAC/1 is transferred to the
variable in the calling instruction. Since
you can only pass one parameter, this
instruction is of limited value.
The m o r e  frequentl y u se d
command is SYS. This simply calls the
machine code starting at the speciﬁed
MACHINE CODE
Welcome to
the Machine
ROM routines revealed. Read on to ﬁnd out how to
input data into your machine code
By Allen Webb
address. Since SYS doesn't support
parameters, we must use some coding
to add them. The most usual syntax
adopted is of the form:
SYS address, parameter 1, parameter
2,.. „etc
After your code is entered, the
Basic text pointer is pointing at the
character after the SYS. We can check
this character using four routines:
YOUR COMM(MORE november 1986:85
$AEF7 — check that character is a right
bracket
SAEFA — check that character is a left
bracket
SAU D  — check that character is a
comma
$AEFF check that character is that
held in the accumulator
These routines give a SYNTAX
ERROR i f the character is not that
sought. If the character is correct, the
I L ISTIN G 2
1

next pointer simply moves on to the
next character.

Parameters
Having sorted out the separators, we
want to evaluate the parameters. This is
readily achieved by calling SAD8A.
This evaluates the expression which is
being pointed at by the text pointer
and stores the result in FAC/1.
Consider the Listing L
JSR SAEFD
20 JSR M I N A
This will extract a single parameter
after checking for a comma and leave
the result in FAC/1. In other words, it
checks the syntax:
SYS address, parameter
This sytem is in fact quite tolerant.
Spaces are ignored allowing freedom
of syntax. The parameter can be any
valid expression or a numeric value.
Listing 2  i s more complex. I t
checks for a rather bizarre syntax ie.
SYS address,(parameter 1),parameter
2
You will note that I've used the
routine a t  $1371
parametes in FAC/1 to integers.
You may, alternatively, wish to
transfer non-numeric data in strings.
Again, there are routines fo r  this
purpose. First, we call SAD9E to
evaluate the expression. This time. the
routine will detect that we have a string
and will exit with the length o f the
string in the accumulator and the start
address of the string in S64 and $65. A
call to $B6A6 erases any previous cop
of the string by moving the string
pointers. On leaving this routine, the
start address of the string is in $22/$23.
Listing 3 handles the syntax:
SYS address, string
MACHINE CODE
This routine will accept text or
strings. e.g.
SYS address,AS
SYS a d d re ss„
The date given by Listing 3 can be
easily manipulated. Listing 4 takes this
data and moves it to a buffer.
I L ISTIN G 4
10 L D Y # 0
20 LOOP L D A STRINGADD ,
So what happens i f you want to
input numeric information during the
operation of the program? Well we can
use some of the techniques described
earlier in this series. Consider listing 5.
I L ISTIN G 3

I
Y OUR CO MMO DO RE  november 1986:86
The block of lines from 70 to 130
perform the input step and simply get
each character and put it into a buffer.
You may remember that we've used
this before. L i n e  9 0  detects th e
RETURN key and terminates entry
When it's pressed. I haven't put a limit
on the acceptable length of the input,
but it's easily done. The input i s
terminated with a zero byte.
The buffer used is special in that it's
the buffer used by Basic to handle text.
Having input our text, we must tell
Basic about i t and where to ﬁnd it.
First, we put the start address ($0200)
of the text into the text pointer used by
the CHARGET routine. This is done
by lines 160 to 190. We then call the
CHARGOT routine in line 200. This
puts the ﬁrst character in your text into
the accumulator. We can now call the
routine at SAD8A to evaluate the text
pointed to by the text pointer. This
converts the text to a ﬂoating point
number i n  FA C /I. The last tw o
instructions print out the FAC/1 to
show that the routine works.
I've just mentioned a beast called
the C H AR GET routine, l e t  u s
consider w h a t  i t  does. Wh e n
processing, the Basic has to keep track
of the text. This is achieved by a short
but useful routine which sits in zero
page R AM . Listing 6  shows this
routine.
When the 64 is powered up, this
routine is copied down from ROM.
The reason is because the text pointer,
which is held in addresses $79 and 57A
is incremented by lines 10 to 30 of the

routine. This is why the address in line
40 is not speciﬁed. Lines 70 and 80
check for spaces and ignore them. The
rest of the routine checks to see if the
character is numeric. If the character is
numeric, the routine exits with the
carry cleared, else i t  i s  set. T h e
accumulator holds the character.
There are two main entry points:
I) CHARGET — this extracts the next
character in the text.
2) CH ARGOT t h is  gets the character
currently pointed t o  b y  t h e  tex t
pointer.
By use of this routine, it is possible
to examine text and thereby use more
complex commands. Consider t h e

part of the CHARG ET routine were
altered so that the routine jumped to
your own routine, it would be possible
to detec t non-standard character
sequences a n d  p e r f o r m  ac tions
accordingly. L is t in g  7  giv es  a n
illustrative example.
Lines 40 to 100 insert three bytes
into t h e  s tart o f  the C H AR G ET
routine. These bytes correspond t o
.IMP WEDGE. This means that every
time that C H AR G ET  is  called, i t
immediately jumps to WEDGE. The
ﬁrst thing that WED G E does is to
incrememt TXTPTR. This is necessary
since the inserted JMP has prevented
CHARGET from doing this. Line 150
gets the next character and we check to
see if it was •  If not, line 190 returns
control to BASIC via CH ARGOT. If
@ was  detected, line 200 onwards
change the border colour and return
control to BASIC. Lines 220 to 240
increment TXTPTR again. This takes
the pointer beyond @ s o that Basic
doesn't notice it  and give a syntax
error. T o  use the routine you must
remain unt il t he machine is  reset.
Because we are wedging in a J MP
instruction, this  s ort o f  routine is
called a wedge.
This routine w ill wor k  both i n
direct mode (try typing followed by
RETURN) and in a program. You can
use any  command name y ou lik e
provided you write the code to check
it. The only prime need is to use a ﬁrst
character which is not used by BASIC.
Obvious examples are @ ,1, >,< etc.
The characters after it can be what you
like. Y o u  c ould, f o r  example. use
@PR I N T ,  1 L O A D ,  >  S E L F -

There are two shortcomings with
Charget wedges:
I) T h e y  a r e  n o t  tok enis ed s o
commands will use more memory than

usual. Most software using this system
have short commands as a result.
2) Since your code will be called each
time C H A R G E T  i s  c alled, t h e
execution speed of Basic will be slower.
Notwithstanding these faults, the
wedge is  a n easily installed device
which is very popular.
realise that I only have time for a
brief description of the functioning of
ROM routines. I f  you want to learn
more, you must read some of the better
books around. The two I mentioned
last time (by  Nic k  Hampshire) are
better than most. The news letters
issued b y  I C P U G  (Independent
Commodore Products Users Group)
are also a useful source of information.

Homework
Last month I  set you quite a meaty
task. In fact, although the task seems
quite large, it's quite simple if you split
it into sections. Consider this answer I.
In order to handle the text, a buffer
starting at 830 is used. Lines 1090 to
1130 ﬁll the ﬁrst ten chancaters with
spaces. Lines 1150 to 1270 prompt for
an input and put the input into the
buffer. Since we're interested in the
ﬁrst four characters of the input and
the input could be less than this length,
lines 1280 t o 1330 pad it  out with
spaces until four characters are there.
Lines 1340 to 1350 terminate the input
with a zero byte. This allows use to use
the routine at $AB1E to print the word
later. Line 1400 t o  1580 search the
word table for the input and according
to the result, a message is output. I'll
leave y o u  t o  s ort o u t  t he search
algorithm. The multiplication in line
1550 and 1560 bump the text pointer
by four characters for each entry in the
word table.
I'm s etting t w o  problems this
month but you need not answer both
unless you're really keen.
I want to pursue this idea for the
ﬁrst homework question this month.
Imagine that you have a piece of text in
a b u f f e r  s t a r t in g  a t  l o c a t i o n
TEXTSTART and terminating with a
zero. The length of this text (excluding
the z e r o )  i s  h e l d  i n  lo c a t io n
TEXTLEN.
Write a routine which will scan the
text and locate words according to
these rules:
I) Words are separated by spaces,
all other characters are assumed to be
part of words.
2) I f  only one word is found, it is a
verb. eg TAKE, EAT

Homework - answer I
3) If two words are found, the ﬁrst is a
verb and the second a noun e.g. TAKE
SWORD, EAT SK AK E.
Extract the verb and move it to a
buffer starting at VERB and put it's
length into VERBLEN.
Similarly move the noun to a buffer
starting at NOUN and its length into
NOUN LEN.
Consider this simple method o f
text compression. I f  you use just 32
characters, you only need live bits to
save each character. This being the
case, you can save three characters in
two bytes giving 33% saving in RAM.
Consider this example:
Character I —  %000IIIII
Character 2 — %00010101
Character 3 — %%0001 lol l
'I his compresses to:
Byte  
I
I
111101 a n d  By t e 2 :
%0I110110
As you can see, character I  now
Y O U R  C O M M O D O R E  novem ber  1986:88
occupies the top ﬁve bits of  byte
Character two occupies the bottom
three bits of byte I and the top two bits
of byte 2. Character three occupies bits
I to bit 5 inclusive of byte 2. Bit 0 to
byte 2 is set to zero.
Your task is to:
I) Dev elop a n  algor ithm w hic h
performs the compression.
2) Write a routine to do this job using
so far as possible logical shifts and rolls
and boolean instructions such as OR
and AND.

N
bound to see something graphic that
was produced by a computer. Com-
puter Graphics are now used in TV,
ﬁlms, advertising, etc. There have even
been exhibitions where artists have
shown their latest piece of computer
art to the public.
Contrary to  popular belief you
don't need a fantastic, thousands of
pounds, computer. In  fact you can
'paint' some very interesting and
colourful pictures on your humble
home micro, whatever it may be. •
An artist using standard paints,
brushes and canvas must have the
correct tools. There's n o  point i n
trying to paint a thin line with a brush
that is more suitable for poking the
ﬁre. The computer artist must also
have the correct tools of the trade. A
graphics package that he feels com-
fortable with is a must. All o f the
options that he should ever require
should be present. It must also allow
him to use the controller that he feels
most happy with, such as a joystick or
mouse.
Three new packages have appeared
on the market over the last few
months, each offering slightly different
facilities to the others and different
Levels of complexity. Below you will
ﬁnd a description of each of the pack-
ages and its facilities. Only you can
decide what you will require from the
package.
The OCP Art Studio
This package is probably the most
friendly and well presented package

tht I have ever come across. All com-
mands are accessed from a series of
pull down menus, rather like those that
were made known by the Macintosh
computer. For those who have never
used pull down menus, you use them
like this: The input device is used to move
your pointer around the screen. If you
move it into the area of the menus at
the top of the screen, and press the ﬁre
button (or whatever) then the menu
that you are pointing at will appear on
the screen. You can now move your
pointer up and down this menu and
choose the option tht you require.
With the Art Studio you have a
choice of four different input devices.
You can use the keyboard, a joystick, a
mouse o f a Koala Pad to move the
Y OUR COMMODORE  november 1986:90
pointer around the screen. A  nice
touch is the fact that the progrgm
always displays the device that you are
using at the top right of the screen. The
reason for this is that you may some-
times have to revert to the keyboard
for entering text, etc. This icon stops
you from making any mistakes.
Probably the best way to discuss
the operation of the program is to deal
with each of the menus as they appear
across the screen.
Print
The ability to get a hard copy is most
important, after all there's no point
just having your picture on the screen.
This menu allows you to dump your
picture t o  a  printer. A  separate

program allows you to  set up the
correct printer. Options inlcude
Commodore and Epson compatible
printers. Five sizes o f printout are
available from I*1 to 5*5. However
certain printers can only print certain
sizes.
Since your pictures will no doubt
be in colour, the option of printing
your pictures in grey scale is present.
This simply replaces each o f the 16
available colours with a shade of grey,
this is equivalent to  a  3*3 dump.
Options are also available to  print
your picture sideways, at the left of the
page, right hand edge or in the middle.
File
This option simply lets you select
whether you are using cassette or disk
and then allows you to keep your latest
masterpiece for future reference.
A facility is present for merging a
picture that has been saved with one
that is already in memory, though I
must admit I've not found a use for this
yet.
If you are using disk then a fair
range o f commands are available to
you. It is possible to have up to four
different drives connected to the com-
puter, changing from one to the other

simply select the LOAD option from
the menu and the list of ﬁles available
will appear in another window. Now
move the pointer to the picture that
you require press the button and wait
until it has loaded.
Attributes
Obviously colour plays a great part in
the actual look of your picture. This
option allows you to  select the ink
(foreground) colour, paper (back-
ground) colour and the border colour.
Once you have chosen an ink you can
set it to transparent, this means that
you cannot change it when anything is
drawn over it. Options also exist to
allow you to overwrite existing colours
or simply inverse them with the new
colour.
Paint
REVIEWS
Now we start to get to the fun part.
This option allows you to select the
Y OUR CO MMO DO RE  november 1986:91
type of painting tool that you want to
use. Options available are, Pen, Spray
can and brush. There are 16 different
pens available, each one of a different
thickness o r angle. Once you have
selected the correct pen you can start
to draw with it in the drawing area.
Eight spray cans are available. Each
one having a different density of spray
dots, this is great for texturing areas of
the screen.
Eight different brushes are avail-
able ranging from a dot to a smiling
face. One o f the brushes is totally
blank. This allows you to colour in
areas of the screen very easily once you
have ﬁnished designing a picture in
black and white.
If you require a  special sort o f
brush then you can design one with the
'Brush edit' function. This simply
allows you to design a brush in what-
ever shape you require it.
Miscellaneous
This menu offers some extremely
useful commands. For a start, since the
menus occupy the top two lines of the
screen you can only see 22 lines out of
24 at any one time. It is possible to
move the screen up and down so that
you can get the extra lines. The View
Screen option gets around this by re-
moving the menu from the top so that
you can see the whole screen at once.
Clear Screen speaks fo r itself and
should be used with care since you
don't want to lose hours of work. The
change colour option i s extremely
powerful since it allows you to change
one ink colour on the screen, or part of
it, i n to  another speciﬁed colour.
Useful i f you think the sea in your
latest seascape is too dark.

Undo
If like me you're a bit of a klutz when it
comes to art then this option will be a
life saver. Quite simply UNDO will
remove the last operation from the
screen. This also comes in handy when
trying something out since you can
always go back to the last picture if you
don't like the effect.
Windows
This is probably the most complex
menu of all. A window is basically a
box that is deﬁned on the screen which
can then be manipulated in some way.
Options available allow you to clear a
window. You can cut the window out
of your picture and move it somewhere
else. You can make copies of a window
elsewhere on the screen. It is even pos-
sible to increase or decrease the size of
a window, making that area of the pic-
ture larger or smaller. I f  this wasn't
enough yo u  can even rotate th e
window around as well as ﬂip the
section of picture that is in it.
Fill
This option allows you to ﬁll or colour
in an area of your picture. The solid ﬁll
option allows you to ﬁll an area with a
solid colour. If you select textured ﬁll
you can ﬁll the area with one of 32 dif-
ferent patterns. This could be used to
give walls a brick texture, etc. You can
also paint with a texture colouring
areas of the screen as you pass the tex-
ture over it. Just in case you require a
special texture and it doesn't appear to
be available you can use the edit tex-
ture option to design your own.
Magnify
When you draw your picture there will
no doubt be areas of the screen that
require special attention. The easiest
way to make small changes to an area
is to magnify it. This means that it is
easier to see just what you are doing
and where you arc placing your colour.
The magnify option allows you to
blow up an area of the screen by X2,X4
and even X8. There is also an option
for having a grid behind the picture so
that you can have even greater control
over where you place the colour.
Text
Quite often it will be necessary to place
some text within your picture. The text

option offers various facilities. You
can print text from left to right or

double or treble height. You can even
have double or treble width. I f  you
don't particularly like the font that the
characters are in then the Font Editor
allows you to design your own.
Shapes
REVIEWS
• The ﬁnal menu option allows you to
choose from a  variety o f  different
shapes/lines for drawing. You can for
example simply plot points on the
screen. You can draw continuous lines,
rectangles, triangles, rays and even
circles. An interesting point is that the
circles can be drawn in two different
ways, you can either specify the radius
and then the circumference or vice-
versa, the only problem with this is
that you tend to forget which option
you are using. Again the UNDO
option comes in handy if you do make
a slip.
The OCP Art Studios is probably
the easiest to use graphics package that
I have ever used on a Commodore
computer. What is unusual is the fact
that ease of use doesn't mean that it
isn't a powerful program. In fact the
Art Studio is also one o f the most
powerful graphics packages I  have
used. Rainbird, who market the pro-
gram, say that an Advanced A r t
Studio is being worked on. My only
question is what on earth are they
going to put in it?
Y OUR CO MMO DO RE  november 1986:92
Picasso's Revenge
Originally an American and imported
into the UK by Precision Software, this
package has one major difference over
the others. Its controller is included
with the price.
Rather than being controlled by a
joystick, etc, this program comes com-
plete with a light pen. If you have never
seen one of these before, a light pen is
rather like a biro. One end of it plugs
into the joystick parts of your com-
puter, you then 'draw' on the screen
with the other end. It is worth pointing
Out that you don't actually draw on the
screen, the computer 'looks' to see
where your pen is and places a dot on
the screen at the relevant point.
Picasso's Revenge has all o f  the
normal facilities that you would expect
from a graphics package, though there
aren't too many 'fancy' ones.
When loading the program, tile
ﬁrst menu allows you to either load a
printer program o r  th e  graphics
package.
The printer program is especially
useful as it allows you to load in pic-
tures that have been saved with other
programs, fo r example Doodle and
Koala Paint. In some cases you can
even make ﬁnal alterations with the
light pen before you do any print out.
When in the drawing package the
menu options appear at both the top
and bottom of the screen. These can be
removed with the F3 key. Pressing it
again •ill bring them back so that you
can change commands.

Going from left to right across the
bottom o f  the screen the following
options are available:
Disk Mode
This option allows you to SAVE and
LOAD your picture ﬁles from or to
disk.
Fill Mode
This will ﬁll any enclosed area with
either a texture or solid colour. After
selecting this option you simply point
your pen at the area that you want to
ﬁll and away it goes. I f  the area that
you choose for the ﬁll isn't totally en-
closed then the ﬁll will not take place.
This is extremely useful as on some
packages t h e  ﬁl l  w o u ld  continue
through the slightest gap, obliterating
the rest of the picture.
Print
This option is  used t o  dump the
current graphic s  screen t o  y o u r
printer. As  with the Ar t Studio the
printout uses shades of grey to repre-
sent the colours.
Zoom
Magniﬁcation of an area of the screen
is available with this command. Once
the screen is magniﬁed you can scroll
around the picture making changes
when necessary.
M i r r o r
This command is  great for  making
pretty patterns. Quite simply every-
thing you draw will be mirrored in
both a horizontal and vertical direc-
tion. rather like a kaleidoscope.
Focus
In use the actual accuracy of the light
pen varies quite a lot, this allows you to
alter just how sensitive the light pen is.
However, there is  a  trade off, the
higher the sensitivity the slower the
actual drawing, etc_
Draw
Brush
Colour 2
Textures
REVIEWS
This is the option that allows you to
produce your 'scribble' on the screen.
Simply move the light pen around and
the ink will follow your pen leaving a
trail.
The width of the brush that is used in
the draw option is selected with this
command, t o  the right o f  this is a
window that shows you the width of
the brush that is currently in use.
As with The Art Studio you have the
option of using textures to ﬁll in areas
of the screen. This option creates a
secondary c olour f o r  the textures.
Careful use of this command can lead
to some extremely interesting shades
being displayed on the screen.
Changing the actual texture that yo
draw or ﬁll with is simply a matter of
pointing at this box until the texture
Y OUR CO MMO DO RE  november 1986:93
tht you require appears in the window.
Unfortunately if you want to redesign
any of the textures you must do this be-
fore entering the graphics screen. This
can be a problem when you are in the
middle of producing a piece of artwork
and y ou suddenly decide that y ou
could use a certain texture in it. Your
only option is to save your picture and
start the program again.
Shape Menu
Selecting this option brings up another
menu on the screen. This menu allows
you to select lines, triangles, rectangles,
circles. etc. You can even write text on
the screen.
Also within this menu arc com-
mands that will let you move areas of
t
of the screen.
Picasso's Revenge is not the most
complex graphics package I have used.
However, it is great fun to play with. I
can't help thinking that the program is
probably more suitable for  children
rather than an experienced artist. The
fact that the light pen isn't quite as
accurate as other types of  controller
may also put some people off.
Artist 64
This program from Wigmore is the
most complex a n d  mos t versatile
graphics package that I have seen for
the C64. It isn't as easy to use as some
of the other packages available as there
are some extremely powerful com-
mands However, time spent trying to
ﬁnd your way around the package will
be well worth it.
As with the Rainbird package this
program c an b e  controlled b y  a
number of  different devices. Options
available include a mouse (the NEOS
or MS.2000) or a joystick. My personal
preference is to use a mouse, though
you do need quite a lot of clear desk
space if you wish to use this option.
Artist 64 is menu driven, however,
unlike the previous two packages the
menus are not present on the drawing
screen. y ou have t o  swap between
screens using the ﬁre button, or mouse.
This is actually better since you can see
the whole of the drawing area at one
time. Three menus are available; these
are the I / O  Menu which controls
actions involving disks, cassettes or
even printers.
The Main Menu is obviously the
one that you will be using the most
often. This is where you will ﬁnd the

actual drawing commands that y ou
will use to design your pictures.
The ﬁnal Menu is the SPE-A Menu
(special effects) this screen gives you
the options o f  designing y our own
brushes, patterns and even c olour
cycles. But more of this later.
As y ou would expect all o f  the
normal drawing commands are avail-
able together w ith a  few that ar e
unusual, yet useful. Options are in-
cluded for drawing freehand, drawing
circles, ellips es  rectangles.
triangles and even polygons. At ﬁrst
you may think that some of the usual
commands such as Rays, etc, are miss-
ing. however, you'd be wrong.
One extremely powerful command
is the RCP option. This remembers the
cursor position. When you next draw a
line or  a shape then you will auto-
matically b e g in  d r a w in g  a t  t h e
previous start position, no doubt you
can now see where you get rays from.
Using the use last command will cause
geometric shapes to keep their dimen-
sions. You can then place the shape
wherever you want it on the screen.
Useful for details such as windows in
houses, etc. Taking this a step I urther,
you can turn on the continuous com-
mand. Once this is On you can leave a
trail of the shape behind as you move
around the screen.
And there's still more. I f  you turn
on the CYCLE option the colour that
is being used t o  draw with at  the
moment will change. the actual cycle
of colours being speciﬁed by you in the
SPFX menu. Now you can leave a trail
of multicoloured shapes behind you.
Should you want the shape to be ﬁlled
in y o u  would simply tur n o n  the
SOLID option, As  you can see the
options a r e  ma n y  a n d  extremely
varied. Don't forget that many of them
can be used with different commands
such as circles, polygons. etc.
One extremely useful option is the

ability to deﬁne an arca of the screen as
a sprite. Once you have done this you
can place your sprite wherever you
want on the screen, you can rotate it,
place it in  front o f  or behind other
colours, you can even use it as a brush
to paint in areas of the screen.
Within the SPFX menu it is pos-
sible to 'protect' any colour from being
overwritten by an other. This is great
when y ou come to adding detail to
your pictures. For  example, say you
had a picture of a castle and wanted to
add green grass around it. Simply pro-
tect the colours that are used in the
castle f r o m being overwritten and
whatever you do with your green pen
or brush the castle will not be in danger
of being 'scribbled' on.
One extremely interesting feature.
and one that I have never come across
before is the ability to RECORD your
drawing actions. You could, therefore,
draw y our masterpiece with record
switched on and watch yourself draw it
again at a later date. I'm sure that a
facility lik e this could be useful for
demonstrations. You could draw say a
picture of a car engine etc. and then
label the necessary parts, even make
changes when required. Then at a later
date you could replay this t o  your
audience. I can't help thinking that this
option is quite what would be needed
to do this as your audience would have
to sit and watch you actually draw the
picture and then swap between menus
as you label your shape etc.
It would have been better if  you
could have stored pictures at different
stages and then replayed the cycle
rather like a set o f  slides. Obviously
this is possible if you keep going to the
I/O Menu and saving your picture and
at a later date load each one in turn.
but I'm sure the record option could
have done something like this.
Not every package is perfect, and
this one is no exception. One major
Y OUR CO MMO DO RE  november 1986:94
gripe is  the fact that any text entry
must be done by  pointing at a key-
board that appears on screen. You
can't type on the keyboard. The reason
for this is that the mouse continually
sends information t o  the computer.
much of this seems like a keypress to
the c omputer whic h w o u ld  quite
happily think you had typed it.
would make your text total jibberish.
The on screen keyboard does seem to
be the only way out. but it is a bit of a
pain.
The text option is extremely power-
ful and allows many different sizes.
The smallest that the text can appear is
5X5 dots. I f  you really want you can
take this right up to a maximum of
160x200 dots, which is very big. You
can even pr int y our text down the
screen or in italics.
I have only touched on the possibi-
lities that are available with this pack-
age. In fact there ae many instructions
that I haven't even looked at. If you are
serious about your computer art then I
suggest that this is one package that
you shouldn't be without, it may be
complex and take some getting used to
but it is the most powerful.
On Your Own
I have only had a look at three of the
more recent packages, there are many
more available in the shops. If you do
want to get into computer art then
suggest that you take a close look at
the manual of any package before you
buy it to make sure that all the options
that you require are there.
Out o f  the three packages that I
have looked at here, Picasso's Revenge
is by far the simplest to use and as a
recent wet afternoon proved, great fun
for the kids. The OCP Art Studio is
extremely well presented, easy to use
and v er y  powerful. I f  y ou d o n ' t
already own a graphics package then
this may be the one for you. On The
other hand if you intend producing a
lot of graphics pictures with your C64,
Artist 64 can't be beaten.
