Preface
Preface
In many cases continuous dynamical processes which occur in nature and in engineering
sciences can successfully be described by mathematical models that involve diﬀerential
equations or systems of diﬀerential equations. The solution of the initial-value problem or
the boundary-value problem described by a diﬀerential equation with some limited infor-
mation about its solutions, can provide the full details and description of the dynamical
process. For example, Newton’s Second Law of Motion is in the form of a second-order
ordinary diﬀerential equation that relates the second time-derivative of the position of a
mass and the total forces that act on the mass as it moves under these forces. Solving this
second-order diﬀerential equation provides information on the velocity and the position
of the mass in terms of time. In fact, most physical theories are based on some funda-
mental diﬀerential equation and are usually named after the scientist who ﬁrst derived
the equation: in quantum mechanics it is Schr¨odinger’s equation, in ﬂuid dynamics it is
the Navier-Stokes equation, in electrodynamics it is Maxwell’s equations, in general rela-
tivity theory it is Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, in relativistic quantum mechanics it is Dirac’s
equations, etc. The mentioned equations are all very interesting diﬀerential equations and
their solutions model many important natural processes. We should however point out
that the mentioned equations are mostly partial diﬀerential equations or systems (meaning
that their dependent variables depend on several independent variables) and are moreover
often nonlinear and, therefore, are much more advanced than the diﬀerential equations
that we study in the current set of lecture notes. In order to provide an introduction to
the general theory of diﬀerential equations, we need to start with the simplest type of
equations, which are the linear ordinary diﬀerential equations. Hereafter, referred
to simply as linear diﬀerential equations.
The lecture notes presented here are intended for engineering and science students as
a ﬁrst course on diﬀerential equations. It is assumed that the students have already read
a course on linear algebra, that included a discussion of general vector spaces, as well as a
course on integral calculus for functions that depend on one variable. However, no previous
knowledge of diﬀerential equations is required to read and understand this material. Many
examples have been included in these notes and the proof of most statements are done in
full details. The aim of the notes is to provide the student with a thorough understanding
of the methods to obtain solutions of certain classes of diﬀerential equations, rather than
the qualitative understanding of solutions and their existence. With the exception of some
nonlinear ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations, we concentrate on linear diﬀerential equations
and the derivation of their solutions.

Preface
In Chapter 1 we provide the theoretical basis of the solution structure for linear dif-
ferential equations. This is an important part of the notes, as this chapter introduces the
concept of a linearly independent set of functions (or solutions) as well as the concept
of linear superposition. The Wronskian is introduced here to establish the linear inde-
pendence. In fact, the Wronskian plays a central role in the study of linear diﬀerential
equations and it appears in many solution formulas throughout these lecture notes. The
solution methods described in Chapters 2 to 4 mostly involve Ans¨atze for the solutions
of the diﬀerential equations and, in some cases, we also need to introduce a change of
the variables in order to derive the solutions. In Appendix A we introduce an alternative
method to solve linear diﬀerential equations based on ﬁrst-order linear operators and their
integral operators. This method is free from any Ansatz and can be viewed as an alter-
native to the solution methods proposed in Chapters 2 to 4. Appendix B sums up the
diﬀerent techniques of integration, whereas Appendix C gives some references to books on
diﬀerential equations. In Appendix D we give the full solutions of a selection of exercises
and in Appendix E we list the answers of all the exercises.
The four chapters included in this material can be taught in 15 lectures, which corre-
sponds to about 50% of a quarter-semester (8 weeks) course in Engineering Mathematics.

Linearity and solutions
Chapter 1
Linear diﬀerential equations and
linearly independent solutions
In this chapter we deﬁne the diﬀerent types of solutions that we will encounter in our
studies of diﬀerential equations. We do not describe or propose in this chapter any methods
to solve diﬀerential equations, as this is the main subject of the remaining chapters in these
notes. However, we prove here several fundamental results regarding the solution structure
of linear diﬀerential equations and we also introduce the very important Wronskian of a
set of diﬀerentiable functions, which makes it easy to establish the linear independence of
sets of solutions. This paves the way for several solution-methods for linear diﬀerential
equation, studied in detail in chapters 2 to 4.
1.1
Solutions of diﬀerential equations
An ordinary diﬀerential equation of order n, where n is a natural number, is an equation
of the general form
F

x, y(x), y′(x), y′′(x), y(3)(x), . . . , y(n)(x)

= 0,
(1.1.1)
where y′ = dy/dx, y′′ = d2y/dx2, . . . , y(n) = dny/dxn and F is a given function of the
arguments as shown.
Deﬁnition 1.1.1. A solution of (1.1.1) is a function φ(x) such that y(x) = φ(x)
satisﬁes (1.1.1). Here φ is a function that is n times diﬀerentiable on D ⊆R and
therefore belongs to the vector space Cn(D). That is, the solution φ(x) is such that
F

x, φ(x), φ′(x), φ′′(x), φ(3)(x), . . . , φ(n)(x)

= 0.
The interval D is known as the solution domain of φ for (1.1.1) and the domain of all
the solutions of (1.1.1) is called the solution domain of the diﬀerential equation.
In this course we will deal with diﬀerent types of solutions, namely general solutions, special
solutions and singular solutions.
There also exist several methods to solve diﬀerential

equations numerically (or to approximate solutions numerically). This subject is, however,
outside the scope of this course and these notes.
Deﬁnition 1.1.2.
a) A general solution of (1.1.1) on some domain D
⊆R, is a function,
φ(x; c1, c2, . . . , cn) ∈Cn(D), which satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation for every
x ∈D and which contains n arbitrary and independent constants c1, c2, . . . , cn,
called constants of integration.
b) Those solutions of (1.1.1) on the interval D which follow from a given general so-
lution φ(x; c1, c2, . . . , cn) by choosing ﬁxed values for the constants of integration
c1, c2, . . . , cn, are called special solutions of (1.1.1).
c) Those solutions of (1.1.1) that cannot be obtained by choosing ﬁxed val-
ues for the constants of integration c1, c2, . . . , cn in a given general solution
φ(x; c1, c2, . . . , cn), are called singular solutions of (1.1.1) with respect to
that general solution.
d) Equation (1.1.1) may admit solutions in the form Ψ(x, y(x)) = 0, where y cannot
be solved explicitly in terms of x for a given function Ψ.
Such solutions are
called implicit solutions of (1.1.1). If the implicit solution contains n arbitrary
constants, then this relation gives a general implicit solution of (1.1.1).

Linearity and solutions
Graphically solutions of diﬀerential equations may be depicted as curves in the XY -
plane on some interval D ⊆R of the X-axis. For a ﬁrst-order equation, a general solution,
y(x) = φ(x; c1), contains one arbitrary constant (or parameter) c1. These solutions are
then one-parameter family of curves in the XY -plane. That is, for every ﬁxed choice of
c1 we obtain an explicit solution curve. This family of one-parameter solution curves are
also known as level curves. For second-order diﬀerential equations a general solution,
y(x) = φ(x; c1, c2), contains two arbitrary constants, c1 and c2, so that this results in a
two-parameter family of curves in the XY -plane. The same holds for nth-order diﬀerential
equations. Special solutions of a diﬀerential equation are then the explicit solution curves
that result when choosing ﬁxed values for the constants of integration c1, c2, . . . , cn in
the given general solution. A singular solution of a diﬀerential equation is a curve in the
XY -plane that does not belong to the family of curves as given by a general solution of
that equation. The singular solution curve may be an asymptote to the family of solution
curves given by a general solution.
Example 1.1.1.
——————————————
a) Consider the ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation
y′ = y2.
(1.1.2)
It can easily be veriﬁed that a general solution of this equation is
y(x) =
1
c −x,
(1.1.3)
for all c ∈R. However, this solution does not contain the solution y = 0, which is
clearly also a solution for (1.1.2). Thus the solution y = 0 is a singular solution for
(1.1.2).
b) As a second example of a singular solution, we consider the equation
y′ + y2 =

2x + 1
x

y −x2,
x > 0.
(1.1.4)
A general solution of (1.1.4) is
y(x) = x(x2 + 2 + c)
x2 + c
(1.1.5)
for all c ∈R. However, we can verify that y(x) = x is also a solution of (1.1.4)
and that this solution is not contained in the general solution (1.1.5). For example,
there is no value for c such that y(2) = 2. The solution y(x) = x is thus a singular
solution for (1.1.4). In fact, there exists no value for c such that y(a) = a for every
a > 0, since
y(a) = a(a2 + 2 + c)
a2 + c
= a leads to the contradiction that 2 = 0.

Figure 1.1 depicts some solution curves of the general solution (1.1.5) for the values
c = 0.1 (blue), c = 0.2 (green), c = 0.3 (red) and c = 0 (brown). The singular
solution y = x is indicated in black.
Equation (1.1.4) is an example of the so-called Riccati equation, which we introduce
in Section 3.2, where we also show that this type of singular solutions always exist
for the Riccati equation.
d) We can verify that the second-order diﬀerential equation
y′′ + 4y = 4x cos x
(1.1.6)
admits the solutions
y(x) = c1 sin(2x) + c2 cos(2x) + 8
9 sin x + 4
3x cos x
(1.1.7)
for all x ∈R, where c1 and c2 are two arbitrary constants. Some solution curves for
the values {c1 = 1, c2 = 1} (blue), {c1 = 2, c2 = 3} (green), and {c1 = 3, c2 = 4}
(red) are shown in Figure 1.2.

——————————————
Consider now a special form of (1.1.1), namely the so-called linear homogeneous
ordinary diﬀerential equation of order n, which has the following general form:
pn(x)y(n) + pn−1(x)y(n−1) + · · · + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = 0
(1.1.9)
Here pj(x) (j = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n) are real-valued continuous functions given on some common
domain D ⊆R, n ≥1 and pn(x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈D.
Let

and φj ∈Cn(D).
Proposition 1.1.1. (Linear Superposition Principle):
Any linear combination of the set of solutions (1.1.10) for (1.1.9) on D, i.e.
c1φ1(x) + c2φ2(x) + · · · + csφs(x),
(1.1.12)
are solutions for (1.1.9) on D for any cj ∈R (j = 1, 2, . . . , s).
Proof: We assume that the set of functions (1.1.10) are solutions of (1.1.9) and show that
y(x) = c1φ1(x) + c2φ2(x) + · · · + csφs(x)
(1.1.13)
satisﬁes (1.1.9). Diﬀerentiating (1.1.13) n times, respectively, we obtain
y′(x) = c1φ′

set of solutions will then describe the general solution of the equation. This is stated
in Proposition 1.1.5 below. To establish this, we start with the deﬁnition of a linearly
independent set of functions in the vector space C(D).
Deﬁnition 1.1.3. Consider the set S of n continuous functions on some domain D ⊆
R:
{φ1(x), φ2(x), . . . , φn(x)}.
(1.1.14)
That is, φj(x) (j = 1, 2, . . . , n) belong to the vector space of continuous functions, C(D).
The set S is a linearly dependent set in the vector space C(D) if there exist constants
c1, c2, . . . , cn, not all zero, such that
c1φ1(x) + c2φ2(x) + · · · + cnφn(x) = 0
for all x ∈D.
(1.1.15)
The set (1.1.14) is linearly independent in C(D) if equation (1.1.15) can only be
satisﬁed on D when all constants c1, c2, . . . , cn are zero.

Linearity and solutions
Example 1.1.2.
——————————————
a) Consider the set S = {1, ex} ∈C(R). Then it is clear that the equation
c1 1 + c2 ex = 0
can only be satisﬁed for all x ∈R, if c1 = 0 and c2 = 0. Therefore we conclude that
S is a linearly independent set.
b) Consider the set S = {cos2 x, sin2 x, 1} ∈C(R). Then the equation
c1 cos2 x + c2 sin2 x + c3 1 = 0
is satisﬁed for all x ∈R if, for example, c1 = c2 = 1 and c3 = −1. Therefore we
conclude that S is a linearly dependent set in C(R).
——————————————
To determine whether a set of functions are linearly dependent on some interval D ⊆R
in the vector space Cn(D), it is useful to introduce the so-called Wronskian.

(1.1.17)

——————————————
To determine whether a set of functions is linearly independent, we can use the following
Proposition 1.1.2. Let S = {φ1(x), φ2(x), . . . , φn(x)} be a set of n nonzero functions
in C(n)(D). If the set S is linearly dependent on the interval D, then the Wronskian
W[φ1, . . . , φn](x) = 0 for all x ∈D. Therefore, if W[φ1, . . . , φn](x0) ̸= 0 at some point
x0 ∈D, then S is a linearly independent set on D.
Proof: Consider the set S = {φ1(x), φ2(x), . . . , φn(x)} in C(n)(D) and the equation
λ1φ1(x) + λ2φ2(x) + · · · + λnφn(x) = 0,
(1.1.19)
where λj, j = 1, 2, . . . , n, are unspeciﬁed constants. Diﬀerentiating relation (1.1.19)
(n −1)-times, respectively, we obtain

(1.1.21)
We denote the n × n coeﬃcient matrix of (1.1.21) as matrix A.
Now, if the set S is
linearly dependent for all x ∈D, then there exist nonzero solutions for at least two of the
constants λj that satisfy equation (1.1.19), so that A is singular (A−1 does not exist) and
det A = 0 for all x ∈D. On the other hand, if det A ̸= 0 at some point x0 ∈D, then A
is not singular in that point, so that the only solution for any λj that satisﬁes equation
(1.1.19) for all x ∈D is the trivial solution, λ1 = 0, λ2 = 0, . . . , λn = 0. We note that
det A = W[φ1, φ2, . . . , φn](x). Therefore we conclude that, if W[φ1, φ2, . . . , φn](x0) ̸= 0 at
some x0 ∈D, then S is a linearly independent set on the interval D.

Example 1.1.4.
——————————————
a) In Example 1.2b we have shown that the set S = {φ1 = cos2 x, φ2 = sin2 x, φ3 = 1}
is linearly dependent for all x ∈R. Then
W[φ1, φ2, φ3](x) =

= 0 for all x ∈R
as stated by Proposition 1.1.2
b) Consider the two exponential functions, namely
φ1(x) = eα1x,
φ2(x) = eα2x,
where α1 and α2 are any real numbers. To show that φ1 and φ2 are linearly inde-
pendent on R we evaluate the Wronskian of φ1 and φ2 in the point x = 0:
W[φ1, φ2](0) =

eα1x
eα2x
α1eα1x
α2eα2x

x=0
= α2 −α1.
Since W[φ1, φ2](x) ̸= 0 in the point x = 0 for α1 ̸= α2, it follows by Proposition
1.1.2 that φ1 and φ2 are linearly independent on R for α1 ̸= α2.
c) Consider the complex function
f(x) = e(α+iβ)x,
α ∈R, β ∈R,
i2 := −1.
Since
e(α+iβ)x = eαx (cos βx + i sin βx)
we have
φ1(x) := Re [f(x)] = eαx cos βx,
φ2(x) := Im [f(x)] = eαx sin βx.
Calculating W[φ1, φ2](0), we obtain
W[φ1, φ2](0) =

eαx cos(βx)
eαx sin(βx)
αeαx cos(βx) −βeαx sin(βx)

Hence, it follows by Proposition 1.1.2 that the set {φ1(x), φ2(x)} is linearly inde-

Proposition 1.1.3. Let {φ1(x), φ2(x), . . . , φn(x)} be a set of n nonzero solutions of
pn(x)y(n) + pn−1(x)y(n−1) + · · · + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = 0
on some interval D ⊆R. Then either
W[φ1, φ2, . . . , φn](x) = 0
for every x ∈D, or
W[φ1, φ2, . . . , φn](x) ̸= 0
for every x ∈D.
Proof: We give the proof for the case n = 2. The general case is proved in the Appendix
to Chapter 1. For n = 2, equation (1.1.9) is
p2(x)y′′ + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = 0,
(1.1.22)
where p2(x) ̸= 0 for every x ∈D. Let φ1(x) and φ2(x) be two solutions for (1.1.22) on the
interval D. Then
p2(x)φ′′
1 + p1(x)φ′
1 + p0(x)φ1 = 0
(1.1.23a)
p2(x)φ′′
2 + p1(x)φ′
2 + p0(x)φ2 = 0.
(1.1.23b)
Multiplying (1.1.23a) by −φ2 and (1.1.23b) by φ1 and then adding the resulting equations
(1.1.23a) and (1.1.23b), we obtain
p2(x)(φ1φ′′
2 −φ2φ′′

(1.1.25)
Therefore equation (1.1.24) can be written in the form
p2(x)W ′ + p1(x)W = 0
or, since p2(x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈D, we can write
W ′ + p1(x)
p2(x)W = 0.

Now, either W = 0 for all x ∈D, or W ̸= 0 for all x ∈D, as we will now show by

for every x ∈D
and c ̸= 0, it follows that W[φ1, φ2](x) ̸= 0 for every x ∈D (except for the singular
solution W = 0). Thus the statement is established for the case n = 2.

Linearity and solutions
It is important to remark that Proposition 1.1.3 is essential in the methods to construct
solutions of linear diﬀerential equations, as we will see in the chapters that follow.
One may want to construct a diﬀerential equation from a given set of solution-functions.
This can be done by the use of the Wronskian: Let S be the given set of linearly indepen-
dent solutions for
pn(x)y(n) + pn−1(x)y(n−1) + · · · + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = 0,
for all x ∈D. Then, by the linear superposition principle, any linear combination of these
solutions is also a solution of this equation, i.e.,
y(x) = c1φ1(x) + c2φ2(x) + · · · + cnφn(x),
(1.1.28)
where c1, c2, . . . .cn are arbitrary constants. However, the set
Q = {φ1(x), φ2(x), . . . , φn(x), y},
is clearly linearly dependent in Cn(D). Diﬀerentiating now (1.1.28) n times, respectively,
we obtain
c1φ1 + c2φ2 + · · · + cnφn −y = 0

Since the set Q is linearly dependent, the (n + 1) × (n + 1) matrix on the left side of the
above relation must be a singular matrix for all x ∈D. Hence its determinant must be
zero for all x ∈D and this determinant is the Wronskian for Q. This leads to the following

Proposition
1.1.4. Consider a set of n linearly independent solutions, S

(1.1.29)
where D ⊆R. Then this diﬀerential equation can equivalently be written in the form
W[φ1, φ2, . . . , φn, y](x) = 0
(1.1.30)
for all x ∈D, where W is the Wronskian of the set of functions {φ1, φ2, . . . , φn, y},

(1.1.31)
Proof: Consider n = 1 with p1(x) ̸= 0. Then the general linear ﬁrst-order homogeneous
equation is
p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = 0.
(1.1.32)
Assume now that φ(x) ∈C1(D) is a solution of (1.1.32), i.e.
p1(x)φ′ + p0(x)φ = 0
or
φ′ = −

Consider now n = 2. Then the general linear second-order homogeneous equation is
p2(x)y′′ + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = 0.
(1.1.35)
Assume now that φ1(x) ∈C1(D) and φ2(x) ∈C1(D) are two linearly independent solutions
of (1.1.35), i.e.
p2(x)φ′′

Since the set {φ1(x), φ2(x)} is a linearly independent set of solutions for (1.1.35), we have
that W[φ1, φ2](x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈D. Hence (1.1.38) reduces to (1.1.36).
The same method of proof can be used for all natural numbers n (see Exercises 1.1.1).

Example 1.1.5.
——————————————
Consider the set of functions S = {φ1(x), φ2(x)}, where
φ1(x) = ex2,
φ2(x) = e−x2,
so that
W[φ1, φ2](x) = −4x.
Applying Proposition 1.1.4 we can construct a second-order linear homogeneous diﬀerential
equation with solutions S for all x ∈R\{0}. It follows that
W[φ1, φ2, y](x) = −4xy′′ + 4y′ + 16x3y.
Hence the diﬀerential equation with the given solution set S has the form
xy′′ −y′ −4x3y = 0.
——————————————
Finally we have
Proposition 1.1.5. Let S = {φ1(x), φ2(x), . . . , φn(x)} ∈C(n)(D) be a linearly inde-
pendent set of n solutions for equation
pn(x)y(n) + pn−1(x)y(n−1) + · · · + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = 0,
where pj(x) are continuous functions on the interval D. Then the linear combination
y(x) = c1φ1(x) + c2φ2(x) + . . . + cnφn(x),
is the general solution of this equation on D, where c1, . . . , cn are n arbitrary real
constants.

Linearity and solutions
In order to give a rigorous proof of Proposition 1.1.5 we need the following theorem
on the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of (1.1.9) (the subject of existence and
uniqueness is outside the scope of these lecture notes and we will therefore not provide
the proof)
Proposition 1.1.6. (Existence and uniqueness theorem)
Consider the nth order homogeneous equation
pn(x)y(n) + pn−1(x)y(n−1) + · · · + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = 0,
where pj(x) are continuous and bounded on an interval D. For a given x0 ∈D and
given numbers b1, b2, . . . , bn, there exists a unique solution y(x) on D such that
y(x0) = b1,
y′(x0) = b2,
. . . ,
y(n−1)(x0) = bn.
(1.1.39)
Note that Proposition (1.1.6) is also true for linear equations of the form
pn(x)y(n) + pn−1(x)y(n−1) + · · · + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = f(x),
where pj(x) and f(x) are continuous and bounded on D.

One may verify that

Since W[φ1, φ2](1) ̸= 0, it follows by Proposition 1.1.2 that φ1 and φ2 are linearly inde-

y(x) = c1x−2 cos(3 ln x) + c2x−2 sin(3 ln x)
for all x ∈D, where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.

The solution space of linear homogeneous diﬀerential
equations
We consider the linear homogeneous diﬀerential equation (1.1.9)
pn(x)y(n) + pn−1(x)y(n−1) + · · · + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = 0,
(1.2.1)
where pj(x) (j = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n) are given continuous functions on some common domain
D ⊆R and pn(x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈D. For convenience we write (1.2.1) in the following
form:
L y(x) = 0
(1.2.2)
Here L denotes the following linear diﬀerential operator of order n:
L := pn(x) dn
dxn + pn−1(x) dn−1
dxn−1 + · · · + p1(x) d
dx + p0(x).
(1.2.3)
Acting L on y(x) ∈Cn(D), we have
L y(x) = pn(x)y(n) + pn−1(x)y(n−1) + · · · + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y.

Linearity and solutions
Consider now the transformation T, such that
T : Cn(D) →C(D),
(1.2.5)
where D ⊆R. Recall that Cn(D) is the vector space of n-times diﬀerentiable functions
on the interval D and C is the vector space of continuous functions on the interval D. In
particular, we deﬁne T as follows:
T : y(x) →L y(x).
(1.2.6)
We now prove
Proposition 1.2.1. The transformation T, namely T : y(x) →L y(x) with L deﬁned
by (1.2.3), is a linear transformation.
Proof: Let y1(x) and y2(x) be any two functions in Cn(D). Then
T(y1(x) + y2(x)) = L (y1(x) + y2(x))
=

pn(x) dn

2
+ · · · + p0(x)y1(x) + p0(x)y2(x)
= L y1(x) + L y2(x) = T(y1(x)) + T(y2(x)).
Moreover, for any real constant c we have
T(cy1(x)) = L (cy1(x))
=

pn(x) dn
dxn + pn−1(x) dn−1
dxn−1 + · · · + p1(x) d

1
+ cpn−1(x)y(n−1)
1
+ · · · + cp0(x)y1(x)
= cL y1(x) = cT(y1(x)).
We conclude that T is a linear transformation.
2
We recall that the kernel of T consists of all those functions y(x) for which
T : y(x) →0.
(1.2.7)
That is, for the linear transformation (1.2.6), the kernel of T contains all solutions of the
equation L y(x) = 0. See Figure 1.3.

Figure 1.3: The solution space of L y(x) = 0
Proposition 1.2.2. Let T : y(x) →L y(x) with L deﬁned by (1.2.3). Then the kernel
of T is an n-dimensional subspace of Cn(D) with basis
B = {φ1(x), φ2(x), . . . , φn(x)},
(1.2.8)
where φ1(x), φ2(x), . . . , φn(x) are linearly independent solutions of L y(x) = 0.
Proof: Let y1(x) and y2(x) be any two functions in the kernel of T. Since T is a linear
transformation, it follows that
T(y1(x) + y2(x)) = T(y1(x)) + T(y2(x)) = 0
and
T(cy1(x)) = c T(y1(x)) = c 0 = 0
for all c ∈R
so that the kernel of T is a subspace of Cn(D). By Proposition 1.1.5 a general solution of
(1.2.2) is of the form
y(x) = c1φ1(x) + c2φ2(x) + · · · + cnφn(x)
for all cj ∈R (j = 1, 2, . . . , n),
(1.2.9)
where every φj(x) is a solution of (1.2.2) and the set {φ1(x), φ2(x), · · · , φn(x)} is linearly
independent in Cn(D). Since (1.2.2) includes all the solutions of (1.2.2), the set
{φ1(x), φ2(x), · · · , φn(x)}
(1.2.10)
spans the kernel of T and the ﬁnite set (1.2.10) is thus a basis for this n-dimensional
subspace of Cn(D).
2
This leads to
Deﬁnition 1.2.1. The kernel of T, where T : y(x) →L y(x) with L deﬁned by (1.2.3),
is called the solution space of the homogeneous linear diﬀerential equation L y(x) =
0.

Linearity and solutions
Remark: If the linear homogeneous diﬀerential equation (1.2.2) contains only constant
coeﬃcients pj (rather than functions pj(x)) in the diﬀerential operator L, then the solu-
tions φj(x) of the equation are all (depending on the values of the constant coeﬃcients) of
the form
xserx
or
xserx cos(qx)
or
xserx sin(qx),
where s is a natural number, whereas q and r are real numbers.
These solutions are
functions that can be diﬀerentiated indeﬁnitely many times for all values of x ∈R, so that
the n-dimensional solution space of (1.2.2) is in fact a subspace of C∞(R), rather than
just Cn(D).

Appendix to Chapter 1
We prove Proposition 1.1.3 for all natural numbers n:
Proposition 1.1.3 Let {φ1(x), φ2(x), . . . , φn(x)} be a set of n nonzero solutions of
pn(x)y(n) + pn−1(x)y(n−1) + · · · + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = 0
in some interval D ⊆R. Then either
W[φ1, φ2, . . . , φn](x) = 0
for every x ∈D, or
W[φ1, φ2, . . . , φn](x) ̸= 0
for every x ∈D.
Proof for all natural numbers n: (the proof of the case n = 2 is given in section 1.1)
In order to prove the statement for all n, we take a second look at the derivation of
equation (1.1.26) as given in the proof in section 1.1: Consider (1.1.25), i.e.
W ′[φ1, φ2](x) =

First-order diﬀerential equations
2.1
Introduction: the initial-value problem
A ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation is of the following general form:
F(x, y(x), y′(x)) = 0.
(2.1.1)
In this section we introduce the so-called initial-value problem for ﬁrst-order equations and
then consider two types of ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations, namely the so-called separable
ﬁrst-order equations and the linear ﬁrst-order equation. We also include some cases of
ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations which can be written in the form of a separable diﬀeren-
tial equation or a ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerential equation by introducing a new dependent
variable.

First-order dierential equations
The initial-value problem for ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations:
Let
y = φ(x; c)
(2.1.2)
be a general solution of (2.1.1) on some interval D ⊆R, where φ contains an arbitrary
real constant c. The initial-value problem states the problem to ﬁnd the solution curve of
(2.1.1) which contains the point
y(x0) = b,
(2.1.3)
where x0 is a given point in the solution domain of the diﬀerential equation and b is a given
real number. The relation (2.1.3) is known as the initial data and x0 is the initial value
for the solutions of the diﬀerential equation. If the point x0 is in the solution domain of
the given general solution φ(x; c) and the general solution satisﬁes the initial data, then
the solution of the initial-value problem is obtained by solving the constant c from the
algebraic relation
φ(x0, c) = b.
(2.1.4)
The solution of this initial-value problem is then given by the general solution of (2.1.1)
where c is the explicit (unique) number that has been solved from the relation (2.1.4). If
the given initial data cannot be satisﬁed by the given general solution y = φ(x; c1), that
is, if
φ(x0, c) ̸= b
for all c ∈R,
(2.1.5)
then the initial data may be in the domain of a singular solution for (2.1.1), say
y(x) = ψ(x),
(2.1.6)
for which ψ(x0) = b. In this case the solution to the initial-value problem is given by
the singular solution y(x) = ψ(x). If neither the general solution, nor any of the singular
solutions for (2.1.1), satisfy the initial data y(x0) = b, then we say that this initial data
is inconsistent with the diﬀerential equation, which means that the diﬀerential equation
does not contain the point y(x0) = b for any of its solutions.
Several examples to illustrate the initial-value problem for ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equa-
tions are given in the sections that follow.

The method to integrate (2.2.1) is as follows:
Divide (2.2.1) by h(y), i.e.
1
h(y)
dy
dx = g(x) and integrate then with respect to x:
  1
h(y)
dy

dx =

g(x) dx + c,
(2.2.2)
where c is a constant of integration. We let y(x) = p(x), so that dy
dx = p′(x) (or dy = p′(x)dx,
i.e. dy
dx dx = dy) and (2.2.2) takes the form

1
h(y) dy =

g(x) dx + c .
(2.2.3)
Relation (2.2.3) is an integral-solution formula for (2.2.1). Since this formula contains
one arbitrary constant it represents a general solution of (2.2.1).
Example 2.2.1.
——————————————
Solve the initial-value problem for the equation
(1 + ex)y′ = exey,
(2.2.4)
with initial data y(0) = 1. Using the integral-solution formula (2.2.3) we have

ey dy =

ex
1 + ex dx + c
and a general solution becomes
y(x) = ln [ln(1 + ex) + c]
for all c ∈R.
(2.2.5)
Use now the given initial data to solve c:
y(0) = ln

ln(1 + e0) + c

x ∈R\{0}
(2.2.8)
where f is a continuous function of the argument y/x, reduces to the separable equation
v′ = 1

(2.2.9)
by the substitution
y(x) = x v(x)
(2.2.10)
Proof: Diﬀerentiating (2.2.10) with respect to x we have
y′(x) = v(x) + xv′(x)
so that (2.2.8) becomes v(x) + xv′(x) = f(v(x)), i.e., the equation in v is of the form
(2.2.9) and is therefore separable in the variables x and v(x).

Example 2.2.2.
——————————————
We ﬁnd a general solution of

for all x ∈R\{0} and then solve the initial-value problem y(1/2) = 0.
The equation can equivalently be written in the form
y′ = x
y −1 + y

By the substitution (2.2.10), i.e. y = xv(x), this equation reduces to
v′ = 1

or

A general solution of the given equation is now in the following implicit form:
y

1 −y

where c is the constant of integration. Applying the initial data y(1/2) = 0, we have

so that c = 2. The solution of the initial-value problem is thus

For the case v = 1, we obtain the singular solution y = x.

Linear ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations
The linear ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation is of the form
y′ + g(x)y = h(x)
(2.3.1)
where g and h are continuous functions on an interval D ⊆R. A general solution can then
be given in terms of an integral-solution formula:
Proposition 2.3.1. A general solution of (2.3.1), i.e. equation
y′ + g(x)y = h(x),
is
y(x) = e−G(x)

h(x)eG(x)dx + c

,
(2.3.2)
where c is an arbitrary constant and G(x) is an anti-derivative of g(x), i.e.
G(x) =

g(x)dx.
(2.3.3)
Proof: We now prove this proposition in two ways, which provides two methods to solve
the linear equation (2.3.1).
The method of integrating factors:
Multiplying
y′ + g(x)y = h(x)
by the expression eG(x), where G(x) =

g(x) dx, we obtain
y′eG(x) + g(x)yeG(x) = h(x)eG(x)
or equivalently
d
dx

yeG(x)
= h(x)eG(x).
The factor eG(x) is known as an integrating factor (see Deﬁnition 2.3.1 below). Integrating
the previous relation over x, we obtain
yeG(x) =

h(x)eG(x) dx + c,
where c is a constant of integration. Since eG(x) ̸= 0 for any x ∈R, we can divide by this
term to obtain the integral formula (2.3.2).

The method of variation of constants:
To ﬁnd a general solution for
y′ + g(x)y = h(x)
we ﬁrst consider the homogeneous equation
y′ + g(x)y = 0,
(2.3.4)
which is a separable ﬁrst-order equation. We can now integrate (2.3.4) for y ̸= 0, to obtain
 dy
y = −

g(x) dx + ln |k|
so that
y(x) = k e−

g(x) dx,
(2.3.5)
where k is an arbitrary nonzero constant. Consider now the variation of the constant k,
namely we consider k as a function of x, i.e.
k = k(x).
We then insert
y(x) = k(x) e−

g(x) dx
(2.3.6)
and its derivative,
y′(x) = k′(x) e−

g(x) dx −k(x)g(x) e−

g(x) dx,
in the full ﬁrst-order linear equation
y′ + g(x)y = h(x)
and obtain
k′(x) e−

g(x) dx = h(x).
Integrating the above expression over x, we get
k(x) =

e

g(x) dxh(x) dx + c,
(2.3.7)
where c is a constant of integration. Inserting k(x) given by (2.3.7) into (2.3.6), we obtain
the integral formula (2.3.2), namely
y(x) = e−G(x)

h(x)eG(x)dx + c

,
where G(x) =

g(x) dx.

First-order dierential equations
Deﬁnition 2.3.1. The factor eG(x), where
G(x) =

g(x)dx,
which results in the integration of the linear equation (2.3.1), is known as the inte-
grating factor of the linear equation (2.3.1).
Remark: A remark regarding Integrating Factors is in order: By the general theory of
ordinary diﬀerential equations it is known that for any diﬀerential equation that can be
integrated in closed form at least once (i.e. a diﬀerential equation of order n for which the
order can be reduced by integration), there exists some integrating factor that brings the
equation to such an integrable form. To ﬁnd an integrating factor for a given diﬀerential
equation is in general a diﬃcult problem (depending strongly on the type of diﬀerential
equation). In the case of ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerential equations, the integrating factor,
exp[

g(x) dx], reduces the ﬁrst-order equation to a zero-order diﬀerential equation, i.e.
we obtain a relation between y(x) and x and an arbitrary constant c from the integration;
hence we obtain a general solution of the ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation. It is a diﬃcult
problem to ﬁnd integrating factors for nonlinear ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations, since the
problem is in general under-determined (in this sense ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations are
more complex than higher-order diﬀerential equations, which is due to the geometry or
symmetry properties of these diﬀerential equations).

Consider the linear ﬁrst-order equation
xy′ = −(2x + 1)y + xe−2x,

Dividing the given equation by x, it takes the following form:

The integrating factor for (2.3.8) is eG(x), where

dx = 2x + ln x.
Thus
eG(x) = xe2x

(2.4.2)

(2.4.4)
so that (2.4.1) takes the form (2.4.2) in terms of the new dependent variable v(x). A

by the relation (2.4.3).

By comparing (2.4.9) with (2.4.1) we note that (2.4.7) is linearizable in terms of the new

The Bernoulli equation is named after Jacob Bernoulli (1654 – 1705), who described this

mathematicians in the Bernoulli family. He is known for his numerous contributions to
calculus and along with his brother Johann, was one of the founders of the calculus of
variations.

We ﬁnd a general solution for the following ﬁrst-order equation:

(2.4.12)
We recognize that (2.4.12) is a Bernoulli equation of the form (2.4.7) with n = 3, f(x) = −1
and g(x) = x. We therefore introduce a new dependent variable v(x) as v(x) = y−2(x).
Now
v′ = −2y−3y′
and the equation in v(x) takes the linear form
v′ −2v = −2x.
Solving this linear equation we obtain
v(x) = x + 1

The Riccati equation
The Riccati equation is of the form

(2.4.13)
where f, g and h are any given continuous functions on some domain D ⊆R. One of the
remarkable properties of the Riccati equation is that it can be linearized in a ﬁrst-order
diﬀerential equation if any solution of (2.4.13) is known. In particular, we assume that
φ(x) is a solution of (2.4.13) and introduce a new dependent variable z(x) as follows:
y(x) = φ(x) + z(x)

Since φ(x) is assumed to be a solution of (2.4.13), i.e.

(2.4.15)
we obtain, with (2.4.14), the following equation in the dependent variable z:

by the following change of dependent variable
y(x) = φ(x) +

where φ is any solution of the Riccati equation and v satisﬁes the linear equation
(2.4.19).
Regarding singular solutions of the Riccati equation, we have the following
Proposition 2.4.4. Consider the Riccati equation (2.4.13), i.e.
dy
dx = f(x)y2 + g(x)y + h(x)
with general solution of the form
y(x; c) = φ(x) +

v(x; c),
where v(x; c) is a general solution of the linear equation
dv
dx + [2φ(x)f(x) + g(x)] v = −f(x)
and φ(x) is a special solution of the Riccati equation. Then the special solution
y(x) = φ(x)
is a singular solution with respect to the initial data y(x0) = φ(x0) for every x0 in the
solution domain of the Riccati equation. The solution of this initial-value problem is
then given by the singular solution, y(x) = φ(x).

problems: i) we use the initial data y(1) = 2 and ii) the initial data y(1) = 1.
As stated in Proposition 2.4.3, we make a change of the dependent variable
y(x) = x +
1
v(x).
(2.4.21)
That is y′ = 1 −v−2v′, so that (2.4.20) takes the linear form
v′ + v
x = 1,
which admits the general solution
v(x) = 1
2 x + c
x,
where c is a constant of integration. Inserting the obtained expression for v(x) into the
relation (2.4.21) we obtain a general solution for (2.4.20) in the form
y(x) = x(x2 + 2c + 2)
x2 + 2c
for all x ∈R\{0}.

i) Using the initial data y(1) = 2 we obtain, from the above general solution,
y(1) = 1(12 + 2c + 2)
12 + 2c
= 2
or c = 1
2.
The solution for this initial-value problem is therefore
y(x) = x(x2 + 3)
x2 + 1 .
ii) It is clear that the singular solution y(x) = x passes through the point of the initial
data, y(1) = 1. Therefore, y(x) = x is the solution for this initial-value problem in this
case. Note that, if we use the general solution (2.4.22) for this initial data we obtain a
contradiction:
y(1) = 3 + 2c
1 + 2c = 1
or 3 = 1
as stated in Proposition 2.4.4.

Second-order linear dierential equations
Chapter 3
Second-order linear diﬀerential
equations
3.1
Introduction: the initial- and boundary-value problem
A second-order diﬀerential equation is of the general form
F(x, y(x), y′(x), y′′(x)) = 0
(3.1.1)
and its general solution is a function φ ∈C2(D) which contains two arbitrary constants,
c1 and c2, and satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation. We write
y(x) = φ(x; c1, c2).
(3.1.2)
The initial value problem requires the following initial data in a point x0 in the solution
domain of the equation:
y(x0) = b0,
y′(x0) = b1,
(3.1.3)
where b0 and b1 are given real numbers. This data is then used to ﬁx the constants c1 and
c2 in the general solution (if the initial data is within the domain of the general solution
and this data can be satisﬁed by the general solution) by solving the (nonlinear) algebraic
system of equations
y(x0) = φ(x0; c1, c2) = b0,
y′(x0) = dφ(x; c1, c2)
dx

x=x0
= b1.
(3.1.4)
If the diﬀerential equation (3.1.1) is linear, then the algebraic system (3.1.4) is a system
of two linear algebraic equations in c1 and c2. This is clear since the constants c1 and c2
appear as weights in the linear combination of linearly independent solutions.
For the so-called boundary-value problem we require boundary data in two points,
x1 and x2, in the equations’ solution domain, namely
y(x1) = b1,
y(x2) = b2,

Second-order linear dierential equations
where b1 and b2 are given real numbers. If this boundary data lies within the domain of
the general solution and can be satisﬁed by the general solution, then the constants c1
and c2 can be ﬁxed by solving the (nonlinear) algebraic system
y(x1) = φ(x1; c1, c2) = b1,
y(x2) = φ(x2; c1, c2) = b2.
(3.1.5)
If the diﬀerential equation is linear, then the algebraic system (3.1.5) is also a linear system
in c1 and c2.
Example of initial-value problems and boundary-value problems are given int the sec-
tions that follow.
3.2
Second-order linear homogeneous equations with con-
stant coeﬃcients
Consider the equation
y′′ + py′ + qy = 0
(3.2.1)
where p and q are real constants. To ﬁnd the general solution of (3.2.1) we make use of
the Ansatz
y(x) = eλx
(3.2.2)
where λ is in general a complex number that needs to be determined such that (3.2.2)
satisﬁes equation (3.2.1). Inserting the Ansatz (3.2.2) and its derivatives
y′ = λeλx,
y′′ = λ2eλx
in (3.2.1), we obtain

λ2 + pλ + q

eλx = 0.
Since eλx ̸= 0 for all complex λ and all real x, we remain with the condition
λ2 + pλ + q = 0
(3.2.3)
which is called the characteristic equation (or auxiliary equation) of (3.2.1). The form
of the solution of (3.2.1) depends on the algebraic solution of (3.2.3) and hence on the
values of p and q. The cases are given in the following

Second-order linear dierential equations
Proposition 3.2.1. Consider equation (3.2.1), i.e.
y′′ + py′ + qy = 0,
where p and q are real constants. Let λ1 and λ2 denote the roots of the characteristic
equation (3.2.3), i.e. λ2 + pλ + q = 0.
a) If λ1 and λ2 are real and distinct roots of (3.2.3), which is the case when p2 > 4q ,
then the general solution of (3.2.1) is given by
y(x) = c1eλ1x + c2eλ2x
for all x ∈R
(3.2.4)
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants and

b) If λ1 and λ2 are real and equal roots of (3.2.3), which is the case when p2 = 4q ,
then the general solution of (3.2.1) is given by
y(x) = (c1 + c2x) eλ1x
for all x ∈R
(3.2.5)
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants and λ1 = λ2 = −p
2 ∈R.
c) If λ1 and λ2 are complex roots of (3.2.3), which is the case when p2 < 4q , then
the general solution of (3.2.1) is given by
y(x) = c1eαx cos(βx) + c2eαx sin(βx) ≡c1 Re

4q −p2 ∈R.
Here the complex roots of (3.2.3) are λ1 = α + iβ, λ2 = α −iβ.
Proof: We consider the three diﬀerent cases, which is a result of the three diﬀerent types
of solutions of the characteristic equation (3.2.3), i.e., λ2 + pλ + q = 0.
Case a: Let p2 > 4q. Then the characteristic equation (3.2.3) has two distinct real roots,
namely

Thus, by the Ansatz y(x) = eλx, the two solutions for (3.2.1) are
φ1(x) = eλ1x,
φ2(x) = eλ2x.
The Wronskian for these two solutions in the point x = 0 is W[φ1, φ2](0) = λ2 −λ1 ̸= 0,
so that {φ1(x), φ2(x)} is a linearly independent set in the vector space C∞(R). Thus the
general solution of (3.2.1) is a linear combination of these two solutions:
y(x) = c1 eλ1x + c2eλ2x
for all x ∈R.

Second-order linear dierential equations
Case b: Let p2 = 4q. Then the characteristic equation (3.2.3) has one real solution (or
twice the same real solution), namely
λ1 = λ2 = −p
2.
This leads to only one real solution for (3.2.1)
φ(x) = e−(p/2)x.
We now ﬁnd the general solution for (3.2.1) by the Ansatz
y(x) = w(x)e−(p/2)x,
(3.2.8)
where w(x) is a twice diﬀerentiable function that needs to be determined such that the
Ansatz satisﬁes (3.2.1). Diﬀerentiating the Ansatz (3.2.8) twice, we obtain

= 0.
Since e−(p/2)x ̸= 0 for all x ∈R and p2 = 4q, the previous expression reduces to
w′′(x) = 0.
(3.2.10)
Integrating (3.2.10) twice over x, we obtain
w(x) = c1x + c2,
(3.2.11)
where c1 and c2 are constants of integration. Thus the Ansatz (3.2.8) leads to the following
solution for (3.2.1):
y(x) = (c1x + c2)e−(p/2)x.
(3.2.12)
The set {ψ1(x) = x e−(p/2)x, ψ2(x) = e−(p/2)x} is linearly independent on D, since
W[ψ1(x), ψ2(x)](0) = −1 in C∞(R). Therefore (3.2.12) is the general solution of (3.2.1).
Case c: Let p2 < 4q. Then the characteristic equation (3.2.3) has two distinct complex

4q −p2,
so that the two solutions λ1 and λ2 take the form
λ1 = α + iβ,
λ2 = α −iβ.
(3.2.13)
Using λ1 we obtain the complex solution φc(x) for (3.2.3), namely
φc(x) = e(α+iβ)x = eαxeiβx = eαx [cos(βx) + i sin(βx)] .
(3.2.14)
We note that the solution φc(x) is a linear combination of two functions,
ψ1(x) = eαx cos(βx) and ψ2(x) = eαx sin(βx).
By the linear superposition principle, it follows that ψ1(x) and ψ2(x) must also be solutions
of (3.2.3). This can also be veriﬁed directly for the equation (3.2.3) by showing that ψ1(x)
and ψ(x) satisfy (3.2.3). Moreover,

λ1 = 2 + 3i,

By (3.2.6) the general solution of (3.2.15) is then
y(x) = e2x (c1 cos(3x) + c2 sin(3x))
(3.2.18)
To solve the stated initial-valued problem we diﬀerentiate (3.2.18) and utilize the
given initial data (3.2.16): We have
4 = y(0) = e2x (c1 cos(3x) + c2 sin(3x))

so that
c1 = 4,
c2 = −3
and the solution of the initial-value problem (3.2.15) – (3.2.16) is
y(x) = e2x (4 cos(3x) −3 sin(3x)) .
For the boundary data (3.2.17) we obtain
1 = y(0) = e2x (c1 cos(3x) + c2 sin(3x))

2 = y(π/6) = e2x (c1 cos(3x) + c2 sin(3x))

3.3
Particular solutions of nonhomogeneous linear second-
order diﬀerential equations
We consider the linear second-order equation
y′′ + g(x)y′ + h(x)y = f(x)
(3.3.1)
where g(x), h(x) and f(x) are given continuous functions on some interval D ⊆R. When
f(x) is not the zero function, then equation (3.3.1) is known as a nonhomogeneous
second-order linear diﬀerential equation and a homogeneous second-order linear
diﬀerential equation when f(x) is the zero function.
Deﬁnition 3.3.1. Any function yp(x) which satisﬁes the nonhomogeneous equation
(3.3.1) on an interval D and which does not contain two arbitrary constants, is known
as a particular solution for (3.3.1) on D.
The following proposition follows directly from the linear superposition principle:
Proposition 3.3.1.
a) A general solution of (3.3.1), i.e. equation
y′′ + g(x)y′ + h(x)y = f(x),
is of the form
y(x; c1, c2) = φH(x; c1, c2) + yp(x),
(3.3.2)
where φH is the general solution of the associated homogeneous equation y′′ +
g(x)y′+h(x)y = 0 and yp is a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation
(3.3.1).
b) A particular solution yp(x) for the nonhomogeneous equation
y′′ + g(x)y′ + h(x)y = f1(x) + f2(x),
(3.3.3)
where g(x), h(x), f1(x) and f2(x) are given continuous functions on D, is given
by the sum
yp(x) = y1(x) + y2(x),
(3.3.4)
where y1(x) is a particular solution for y′′ + g(x)y′ + h(x)y = f1(x) and y2(x) is
a particular solution for y′′ + g(x)y′ + h(x)y = f2(x).
The proof is left as an exercise (see Exercises 3.3.2).

Second-order linear dierential equations
There exist several methods for ﬁnding particular solutions of (3.3.1) and we study
here two of those methods, namely the method of variation of parameters as well as the
method of undetermined coeﬃcients. The former method can be applied for any continuous
functions g(x), h(x) and f(x), whereas the latter method is useful only if the coeﬃcient
functions g(x) and h(x) are constants and the function f(x) is of special type.
The
advantage for the method of undetermined coeﬃcients is that it does not involve any
integration as all steps are purely algebraic.
3.3.1
Particular solutions: the method of variation of parameters
In this section we present a general method to ﬁnd particular solutions and derive an
integral-solution formula for particular solutions for the linear equation
y′′ + g(x)y′ + h(x)y = f(x),
(3.3.5)
where g, h and f are continuous functions on some domain D ⊆R.
The following method to construct particular solutions, as described in the proof of Propo-
sition 3.3.2 below, is known as the method of variation of parameters.

Second-order linear dierential equations
Proposition 3.3.2. Assume that two linearly independent solutions of the homoge-
neous equation
y′′ + g(x)y′ + h(x)y = 0
(3.3.6)
are given by φ1(x) and φ2(x) on the interval D ⊆R. Then a particular solution yp(x)
of
y′′ + g(x)y′ + h(x)y = f(x)
is
yp(x) = w1(x)φ1(x) + w2(x)φ2(x),
(3.3.7)
where w1(x) and w2(x) have the following form:
w1(x) = −

f(x)φ2(x)
W[φ1, φ2](x) dx,
w2(x) =

f(x)φ1(x)
W[φ1, φ2](x) dx.
Here W[φ1, φ2](x) is the Wronskian.
Proof: Consider two linearly independent solutions, φ1(x) and φ2(x), of the homogeneous
equation (3.3.6) and use the Ansatz
yp(x) = w1(x)φ1(x) + w2(x)φ2(x),
(3.3.8)
to seek for a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation (3.3.5). Diﬀerentiating
(3.3.8), we obtain
y′
p = w′
1φ1 + w1φ′
1 + w′
2φ2 + w2φ′
2.
Let now
w′
1φ1 + w′
2φ2 = 0,
(3.3.9)
so that y′
p takes the form
y′
p = w1φ′
1 + w2φ′
2.
(3.3.10)
Diﬀerentiating y′
p one more time, we obtain
y′′
p = w′
1φ′
1 + w1φ′′
1 + w′
2φ′
2 + w2φ′′
2.
(3.3.11)
Inserting (3.3.8) for yp, (3.3.10) for y′
p, and (3.3.11) for y′′
p into (3.3.5), we obtain
w1

(3.3.12)
Since φ1 and φ2 satisﬁes the homogeneous equation (3.3.6), the above expression reduces
to
w′

2 = f(x).

We conclude that the Ansatz (3.3.8) is a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous
equation (3.3.6) if and only if the two conditions on w1 and w2, namely (3.3.9) and (3.3.13)
are satisﬁed, i.e.
 w′

2φ2 = 0

(3.3.14)
We note that the determinant of the coeﬃcient matrix of the above system is the Wronskian
of the functions φ1 and φ2, namely
W[φ1, φ2](x) =

φ1
φ2
φ′

φ′

 = φ1φ′
2 −φ2φ′
1.
By Proposition 1.1.3 we know that W[φ1, φ2](x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈D, as φ1 and φ2 are
solutions and are linearly independent functions on D by assumption.
Therefore the
coeﬃcient matrix of (3.3.14) is nonzero and Cramer’s rule for the unique algebraic
solution of w′
1 and w′
2 from system (3.3.14) applies. We obtain

Historical Note: (source: Wikipedia)
Gabriel Cramer (1704 – 1752) was a Swiss mathematician, born in Geneva.
Cramer
showed promise in mathematics from an early age. At 18 he received his doctorate and
at 20 he was co-chair of mathematics.
Cramer’s Rule for linear algebraic systems is
named after Gabriel Cramer, as he published the rule for an arbitrary number of unknowns
in 1750, although Colin Maclaurin also published special cases of the rule in 1748 (and
possibly knew of it as early as 1729). Cramer published his best-known work in his forties
in his treatise on algebraic curves (1750).

Gabriel Cramer (1704 – 1752)
Following Proposition 3.3.2 we use the Ansatz
yp(x) = w1(x)φ1(x) + w2(x)φ2(x),
where the two linearly independent solutions for the associated homogeneous equation are
φ1(x) = ex,
φ2(x) = xex.
The Wronskian for φ1 and φ2 is
W[φ1, φ2](x) =

Thus, by the integral formulas given in Proposition 3.3.2, we obtain

e2x
dx = −

dx = −x
w2(x) =

dx = ln |x|.
A particular solution is thus
yp(x) = −x ex + x ln |x| ex.

Proposition
3.3.3. Assume
that
three
distinct

solutions,
namely
y1(x), y2(x) and y2(x), are given for the nonhomogeneous equation
y′′ + g(x)y′ + h(x)y = f(x)
on the interval D ⊆R. Consider
φ1(x) = y2(x) −y1(x)
and
φ2(x) = y2(x) −y3(x).
(3.3.15)
If W[φ1, φ2](x0) ̸= 0 in any point x0 ∈D, then φ1(x) and φ2(x) are two linearly
independent solutions of the associated homogeneous equation
y′′ + g(x)y′ + h(x)y = 0
(3.3.16)
on D. A general solution for
y′′ + g(x)y′ + h(x)y = f(x)
is then
y(x) = c1φ1(x) + c2φ2(x) + yj(x)
for all x ∈D, where yj is any particular solution of this equation for all x ∈D and c1
and c2 are two arbitrary constant.

Second-order linear dierential equations
Proof: Consider φ1(x) = y2(x) −y1(x), and assume that y1(x) and y2(x) are particular
solutions on an interval D for the nonhomogeneous equation
y′′ + g(x)y′ + h(x)y = f(x).
Then φ′
1 = y′
2 −y′
1 and φ′′
1 = y′′
2 −y′′

φ′′

2 + h(x)y2 −

y′′
1 + g(x)y′
1 + h(x)y1

= f(x) −f(x) = 0,
so that we can conclude that φ1(x) is a solution of the homogeneous equation
y′′ + g(x)y′ + h(x)y = 0.
The same is true for φ2(x) = y2(x) −y3(x), where y3(x) is also a particular solution of the
nonhomogeneous equation. If W[φ2, φ2[(x0) ̸= 0 for some x0 ∈D, then {φ1(x), φ2(x)} is
a linearly independent set. The general solution φH(x; c1, c2) of the homogeneous equation
y′′ + g(x)y′ + h(x)y = 0
is φH(x; c2, c2) = c1φ1(x)+c2φ2(x) for all x ∈D and the general solution of the nonhomo-
geneous equation is φH(x; c1, c2)) + yj for any particular solution of the nonhomogeneous
equation.

Remark: From Proposition 3.3.3 we can conclude that a second-order nonhomogeneous
diﬀerential equation on the domain D that admits three distinct particular solutions,
{y1(x), y2(x), y3(x)} for all x ∈D, can identically be constructed for all x ∈D under the
conditions sated in Proposition 3.3.3
Example 3.3.2.
——————————————
Consider the nonhomogeneous equation
y′′ −4y′ + 4y = x ex.
(3.3.17)
It is easy to verify that the equation admits the following three particular solutions:
y1(x) = ex(x + 2),
y2(x) = e2x + ex(x + 2),
y3(x) = x e2x + ex(x + 2)
for all x ∈R. Let now
φ1(x) = y2(x) −y1(x) = e2x,
φ2(x) = y2(x) −y3(x) = e2x(x + 2).
Calculating the Wronskian in the point x = 0, we obtain
W[φ1, φ2](0) = −1,

Second-order linear dierential equations
so that the set {φ1(x), φ2(x)} is linearly independent in C∞(R). The general solution
φH(x) of the homogeneous equation
y′′ −4y′ + 4y = 0
is therefore
φH(x) = a1e2x + a2e2x(1 −x) = (a1 + a2)e2x −a2xe2x,
or we can rename the constant a1, a2 as follows: c1 = a1 + a2, c2 = −a2, to obtain the
general solution in the form
φH(x) = c1e2x + c2xe2x.
To get a general solution for the given nonhomogeneous equation (3.3.17) we can add any
particular solution, say y1, so that the general solution is y(x) = φH(x) + y1(x). If we use
any other particular solution, yj(x), in the sum φH(x) + yj(x), then the general solution
will remain the same (up to a change of the constants), since the constants c1 and c2 are
arbitrary and can always be re-deﬁned in terms of some other arbitrary constants.

3.3. PARTICULAR SOLUTIONS

Case Ia: Let q ̸= 0 . The Ansatz for a particular solution of (3.3.19) is then
yp(x) = Amxm + Am−1xm−1 + · · · + A1x + A0 := Qm(x),
(3.3.21)
where the real constants, Aj, (j = 0, 1, . . . , m), are to be determined such that the Ansatz
(3.3.21) satisﬁes (3.3.19).
Case Ib: Let q = 0 and p ̸= 0 . The Ansatz for a particular solution of (3.3.19) is then
yp(x) = x Qm(x),
(3.3.22)
where Qm(x) is given by (3.3.21).
Case Ic: Let q = 0 and p = 0 . The Ansatz for a particular solution of (3.3.19) is then
yp(x) = x2Qm(x),
(3.3.23)
where Qm(x) is given by (3.3.21).
Example 3.3.3.
——————————————
We ﬁnd a general solution for
y′′ + 4y = 8x2.
(3.3.24)
First we ﬁnd the general solution φH of the associated homogeneous equation
y′′ + 4y = 0.
(3.3.25)
Using the Ansatz y(x) = eλx, we obtain
φH(x) = c1 cos(2x) + c2 sin(2x).
(3.3.26)
For a particular solution we need to use the Ansatz proposed in Case I a) due to the
presence of the term 4y. The Ansatz is thus
yp(x) = A2x2 + A1x + A0,
(3.3.27)
so that
y′
p(x) = 2A2x + A1,
y′′
p(x) = 2A2.
Inserting the above into (3.3.24), we obtain

Second-order linear dierential equations
Equating coeﬃcients of x2, x and 1 in the above relation leads to the following set of
linear algebraic equations for A2, A1 and A0:
x2 :
4A2 = 8
x1 :
4A1 = 0
1 :
2A2 + 4A0 = 0.
Solving this algebraic system, we obtain A0 = −1, A1 = 0, A2 = 2. Hence, a particular
solution for (3.3.24) is
yp(x) = 2x2 −1.
(3.3.29)
A general solution of (3.3.24) is therefore
y(x) = c1 cos(2x) + c2 sin(2x) + 2x2 −1.

Pm(x) = amxm + am−1xm−1 + · · · + a1x + a0
(3.3.32)
with aj, (j = 0, 1, . . . , m) real coeﬃcients. Here α is a complex number, such that
α = α1 + iα2, with α1, α2 real.
Every diﬀerentiable complex function yc(x) can be written in the form
yc(x) = u(x) + iv(x),
(3.3.33)
where u and v are real diﬀerentiable functions on some domain D ⊆R and
y′
c(x) = u′(x) + iv′(x)
y′′
c (x) = u′′(x) + iv′′(x).
Using the Ansatz (3.3.33) and and its derivatives for reduces (3.3.31) to the form
u′′ + iv′′ + p(u′ + iv′) + q(u + iv)
= eα1x cos(α2x) Pm(x) + ieα1x sin(α2x) Pm(x),

Second-order linear dierential equations
Proposition 3.3.4. A convenient Ansatz for a complex particular solution ycp(x) of
y′′
c + py′
c + qyc = eαxPm(x),
α := α1 + iα2,
α1 ∈R, α2 ∈R
is
ycp(x) = eαxwc(x),
(3.3.38)
where wc(x) is any complex solution of the equation
w′′
c + (2α + p)w′
c + (α2 + αp + q)wc = Pm(x).
(3.3.39)
A real particular solution up(x) of
u′′ + pu′ + qu = eα1x cos(α2x) Pm(x)
is then given by the real part of ycp, i.e.
up(x) = Re [ycp],
(3.3.40)
whereas a real particular solution vp(x) of
v′′ + pv′ + qv = eα1x sin(α2x) Pm(x)
is give by the imaginary part of ycp(x), i.e.
vp(x) = Im [ycp].
(3.3.41)
Proof: Diﬀerentiating the Ansatz (3.3.38) we obtain
y′
cp(x) = αeαxwc(x) + eαxw′
c(x)
y′′
cp(x) = α2eαxwc(x) + 2αeαxw′
c(x) + eαxw′′
c (x).
Inserting (3.3.38) and the above derivatives, y′
cp and y′′
cp, in
y′′
c + py′
c + qyc = eαxPm(x),
α := α1 + iα2,
α1 ∈R, α2 ∈R
leads to condition (3.3.39).

To ﬁnd a solution wc(x) of (3.3.39), i.e. equation
w′′
c + (2α + p)w′
c + (α2 + αp + q)wc = Pm(x),
we use the same Ans¨atze as listed in Case I since the nonhomogeneous part of (3.3.39)
is a polynomial, albeit we now need to evaluate complex coeﬃcients in the polynomial
Ansatz Qm(x). The following three cases may appear:

Second-order linear dierential equations
Case IIa: Let α2 + αp + q ̸= 0 . An Ansatz for a solution wc of (3.3.39) is then
wc(x) = Bmxm + Bm−1xm−1 + · · · + B1x + B0 := Sm(x),
(3.3.42)
where Bj (j = 0, 1, . . . , m) are complex constants which need to be determined for the
Ansatz.
Case IIb: Let α2 + αp + q = 0 and 2α + p ̸= 0 . An Ansatz for a solution wc of (3.3.39)
is then
wc(x) = xSm(x),
(3.3.43)
where Sm(x) is given by (3.3.42).
Case IIc: Let α2 + αp + q = 0 and 2α + p = 0 . An Ansatz for a solution, wc, of (3.3.39)
is then
wc(x) = x2Sm(x),
(3.3.44)
where Sm(x) is given by (3.3.42).
Example 3.3.4.
——————————————
We ﬁnd a particular solution for the diﬀerential equation
y′′ −y = sin x.
(3.3.45)
Since Im

eix
= sin x, we need to consider the complex diﬀerential equation
y′′
c −yc = e−ix,
(3.3.46)
where the complex function yc(x) is
yc(x) = u(x) + iy(x)
and
Im[yc(x)] = y(x).
We now seek a particular solution ycp(x) for the complex equation (3.3.46) by the Ansatz
ycp(x) = eix wc(x).
(3.3.47)
A particular solution yp(x) for the real equation (3.3.45) is then
yp(x) = Im [ycp(x)] .
Diﬀerentiating the Ansatz (3.3.47) twice, we obtain

cp = eix 
iwc + w′

Inserting the Ansatz (3.3.47) and (3.3.48) in the complex equation (3.3.46), we obtain

w′′
c + 2iw′
c −2wc

= eix
or, since eix ̸= 0 for all x ∈R, we have
w′′
c + 2iw′
c −2wc = 1.
(3.3.49)
An Ansatz for wc of (3.3.49) is given by Case II a, namely
wc(x) = B0
(3.3.50)
where B0 is a constant (in general B0 is complex, but in this case it is clearly real).
Inserting the Ansatz (3.3.50) into (3.3.49) we obtain −2B0 = 1 so that wc(x) = −1
2. Thus
we have obtained a complex particular solution for (3.3.46), namely
ycp(x) = −1

so that a real particular solution yp(x) for the real equation (3.3.45) is
yp(x) = Im

For a second example of Case II, we consider a slightly more complicated equation:
Example 3.3.5.
——————————————
We ﬁnd a particular solution for the diﬀerential equation
y′′ + 4y = (10x −1)ex cos x.
(3.3.51)
Since
Re

(10x −1)e(1+i)x
= (10x −1)ex cos x
(3.3.52)
we need to consider the complex equation
y′′
c + 4yc = (10x −1)e(1+i)x
(3.3.53)
and construct a complex particular solution ycp(x) by the Anstaz
ycp = e(1+i)xwc(x).
(3.3.54)
A real particular solution yp(x) of (3.3.51) then follows by
yp(x) = Re [ycp].
(3.3.55)
Diﬀerentiating the Ansatz (3.3.55) we obtain
y′
cp = (1 + i)e(1+i)xwc + e(1+i)xw′
c
y′′
cp = (1 + i)2e(1+i)xwc + 2(1 + i)e(1+i)xw′
c + e(1+i)xw′′
c
and the condition on wc becomes
w′′
c + 2(1 + i)w′
c + (4 + 2i)wc = 10x −1.
(3.3.56)
An appropriate Ansatz for (3.3.56) is provided by Case IIa, i.e.
wc(x) = B1x + B0,
B0 ∈C, B1 ∈C.
(3.3.57)
Equation (3.3.56) then takes the form
2(1 + i)B1 + (4 + 2i)(B1x + B0) = 10x −1
(3.3.58)
and equating coeﬃcients of x and 1 leads to
(4 + 2i)B1 = 10,
2(1 + i)B1 + (4 + 2i)B0 = −1.
We ﬁnd
B0 = −8
5 + 3
10i,
B1 = 2 −i.

Second-order linear dierential equations
Case III f(x) = eαxPm(x),
α ∈R
We consider the equation
y′′ + py′ + qy = eαxPm(x),
α ∈R
(3.3.62)
where Pm is an m-th-degree polynomial with real coeﬃcients. We note that this is in fact
a special case of (3.3.31), with α ∈R. Here y(x) is a real function and the same Ansatz,
(3.3.38), for a particular solution yp(x) of (3.3.62) is valid, namely
yp(x) = eαx w(x)
(3.3.63)
with the same condition on w as given by (3.3.39), namely
w′′ + (2α + p)w′ + (α2 + αp + q)w = Pm(x)
(3.3.64)
To ﬁnd a solution w(x) of (3.3.64) we distinguish between three cases:
Case IIIa: Let α2 + αp + q ̸= 0 . An Ansatz for a solution w(x) of (3.3.64) is then
w(x) = Amxm + Am−1xm−1 + · · · + A1x + A0 := Qm(x),
(3.3.65)
where Aj (j = 0, 1, . . . , n) are real constants which need to be determined for the Ansatz.
Case IIIb: Let α2 + αp + q = 0 and 2α + p ̸= 0 .
An Ansatz for a solution w(x) of
(3.3.64) is then
w(x) = xQm(x),
(3.3.66)
where Qm(x) is given by (3.3.65).
Case IIIc: Let
α2 + αp + q = 0 and 2α + p = 0 .
An Ansatz for a solution w(x) of
(3.3.64) is then
w(x) = x2Qm(x),
(3.3.67)
where Qm(x) is given by (3.3.65).
Example 3.3.6.
——————————————
We ﬁnd a particular solution for
y′′ −9y = 8x3ex.
(3.3.68)
The Ansatz (3.3.63) for yp(x) is
yp(x) = ex w(x)

and the derivatives are

p = ex 
w + 2w′ + w′′
Inserting this Ansatz into the given equation, we obtain
ex 
w′′ + 2w′ + w −9w

= 8x3ex.
Since ex ̸= 0 for all R, we have
w′′ + 2w′ −8w = 8x3.
(3.3.69)
An Ansatz for w(x) is given by Case IIIa, namely
w(x) = A0 + A1x + A2x2 + A3x3
with
w′ = 3A −3x2 + 2A −2x + A1,
w′′ = 6A3x + 2A2.
Inserting the above Ansatz into (3.3.69), we obtain
6A3x + 2A2 + 2

3A3x2 + 2A2x + A1

−8

A3x3 + A2x2 + A1x + A0

= 8x3.
Equating the coeﬃcients x3, x2, x and x0 we obtain
x3 :
−8A3 = 8
x2 :
6A3 −8A2 = 0
x :
6A3 + 4A2 −8A1 = 0
x0 :
2A2 + 2A1 −8A0 = 0.
This algebraic system has the unique solution
A0 = −15
32,
A1 = −9
8,
A2 = −3

A3 = −1.
Thus the particular solution for (3.3.68) takes the form

The second-order Cauchy-Euler equation
The general Cauchy-Euler equation of second order is of the form
x2y′′ + pxy′ + qy = f(x)
(3.4.1)
where p and q are given real numbers and f(x) is a given continuous function on some in-
terval D ⊆R. To solve this equation we can introduce a new independent variable, z,
and transform the Cauchy-Euler equation into a linear second-order nonhomogeneous dif-
ferential equation with constant coeﬃcients in terms of this new independent variable.

Proposition 3.4.1.
a) For x > 0, the Cauchy-Euler equation

dx + qy(x) = f(x)
can be written in the form
dy2
dz2 + (p −1)dy
dz + qy(z) = f(ez),
(3.4.2)
where the new independent variable z is given by the relation
 x = ez ⇔z = ln(x)
y(x) = y(z).
(3.4.3)
b) For x < 0, the Cauchy-Euler equation
x2 d2y
dx2 + pxdy
dx + qy(x) = f(x)
can be written in the form
dy2
dz2 + (1 −p)dy
dz + qy(z) = f(−ez)
(3.4.4)
where the new independent variable z is given by the relation
 x = −ez ⇔z = ln(−x)
y(x) = y(z).

Proof: Consider x > 0. Find now dy

Baron Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789 – 1857) was a French mathematician who was an
early pioneer of analysis. He started the project of formulating and proving the theorems
of inﬁnitesimal calculus in a rigorous manner. He deﬁned continuity in terms of inﬁnites-
imals and gave several important theorems in complex analysis and initiated the study of
permutation groups in abstract algebra. He wrote approximately eight hundred research
articles

Historical Note: (source: Wikipedia)
Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) was a pioneering Swiss mathematician and physicist. He
made important discoveries in ﬁelds as diverse as inﬁnitesimal calculus and graph theory.
He also introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation, partic-
ularly for mathematical analysis such as the notion of a mathematical function. He is
also renowned for his work in mechanics, ﬂuid dynamics, optics, and astronomy. Euler
is considered to be the pre-eminent mathematician of the 18th century and one of the
greatest mathematicians ever.
He is also one of the most proliﬁc mathematicians; his
collected works ﬁll 80 volumes. He spent most of his adult life in St. Petersburg, Russia,
and in Berlin, Prussia. A statement attributed to Pierre-Simon Laplace expresses Euler’s
inﬂuence on mathematics: ”Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all.”

We consider the equation

where g and h are given continuous functions on some domain D ⊆R.
We show that this equation can be reduced to a ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerential equation

Proposition 3.5.1.
Suppose that φ1(x) is a nonconstant special solution of
y′′ + g(x)y′ + h(x)y = 0,
(3.5.1)
for every x on some interval D ⊆R. Then the following statements hold:
a) The Ansatz y(x) = φ2(x), where
φ2(x) = v(x)φ1(x),
(3.5.2)
and v is nonconstant function on D, reduces (3.5.1) on D to a ﬁrst-order homo-
geneous linear equation in w(x), namely
φ1w′ + w(2φ′
1 + g(x)φ1) = 0,
(3.5.3)
where w(x) = v′(x).
b) A second solution φ2(x) of (3.5.1) on D is given by
φ2(x) = φ1(x)

φ−2
1 (x) eξ(x) dx,
(3.5.4)
where ξ(x) = −

g(x) dx.
c) The solutions φ1(x) and φ2(x) given by (3.5.4) are linearly independent on D.
d) A general solution y(x) of (3.5.1) is given by the linear combination of the given
solution φ1(x) and the derived solution (3.5.4), i.e.
y(x) = c1φ1(x) + c2φ2(x)
(3.5.5)
for all x ∈D.
Proof: Insert the Ansatz (3.5.2) for a second solution φ2(x) into (3.5.1). This leads to
φ1v′′ + v′(2φ′
1 + gφ1) = 0.
(3.5.6)
With the substitution v′(x) = w(x) we obtain (3.5.3). Equation (3.5.3) is a separable
equation and, since w(x) ̸= 0, we can integrate this equation as follows:

we obtain

(3.5.7)
Recall that v′(x) = w(x). Integrating (3.5.7) one more time over x, we obtain
v(x) =

where
ξ(x) = −

and the second solution, (3.5.4), then follows from the (3.5.2). To prove the linear inde-

φ1
vφ1

v′φ1 + vφ′

 (x) = v(x)′φ2

Thus W[φ1, vφ1](x) ̸= 0, since v(x) is not constant and φ1 ̸= 0. Hence φ1(x) and φ2(x) =
v(x)φ1(x) given by (3.5.4) are linearly independent on D. The general solution of (3.5.1)
then follows from the superposition principle.

Chapter 4
Higher-order linear diﬀerential
equations
4.1
Introduction: the initial-value problem
In this chapter we consider the nth order (n ≥2) linear homogeneous ordinary dif-
ferential equation
pn(x)y(n) + pn−1(x)y(n−1) + · · · + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = 0
(4.1.1)
and the linear nonhomogeneous ordinary diﬀerential equation
pn(x)y(n) + pn−1(x)y(n−1) + · · · + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = f(x)
(4.1.2)
Here pj(x) (j = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n) and f(x) are real-valued continuous functions given on some
common domain D ⊆R, n ≥1 and pn(x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈D.
We know from Proposition 1.1.5 in Chapter 1, that the general solution of the ho-
mogeneous equation (4.1.1) is given by the linear combination of n linearly independent
solutions
S = {φ1(x), φ2(x), . . . , φn(x)}
(4.1.3)
in Cn(D). That is, the general solution of (4.1.1) is
y(x) = c1φ1(x) + c2φ2(x) + . . . + cnφn(x),
(4.1.4)
where c1, . . . , cn are n arbitrary real constants. Moreover, we know from Proposition 3.3.1
in Chapter 3, that the general solution of the second-order nonhomogeneous equation of
the form (4.1.2) (with n = 2) is given by the general solution of its homogeneous part plus
any particular solution yp(x) of the nonhomogeneous diﬀerential equations. This is also
true for the n-th order nonhomogeneous equation (4.1.2), so that the general solution of
(4.1.2) is of the form
y(x) = c1φ1(x) + c2φ2(x) + . . . + cnφn(x) + yp(x)

Higher-order linear dierential equations
where all functions are in Cn(D) (see Section 4.3 below).
In our study of equations (4.1.1) and (4.1.2), we shall mainly restrict ourselves to equa-
tions with constant coeﬃcients and concentrate on generalizing the methods described for
linear second-order equations in Chapter 3 to n-th order linear equations. In a sense this
generalization is straight forward, although there are of course complications. For exam-
ple, for n-th order linear homogeneous diﬀerential equations the characteristic equation
resulting from the Ansatz y(x) = eλx, becomes an n-th degree polynomial, and to ﬁnd
all roots of such a polynomial is in general not possible even though we know that those
exist.
The initial-value problem for (4.1.2) requires the following initial data at a point
x0 in the solution domain of the equation:
y(x0) = b1, y′(x0) = b2, y′′(x0) = b3, . . . , y(n−1)(x0) = bn,
(4.1.6)
where b1, b2, . . . , bn are given real numbers. This data is then used to ﬁx the constants
of integration c1, c2, . . . , cn in the general solution (4.1.5) by solving the linear algebraic
system of equations
y(x0) = c1φ1(x0) + c2φ2(x0) + . . . + cnφn(x0) + yp(x0) = b1

Higher-order linear dierential equations
We note that det A = W[φ1, φ2, . . . , φn](x0), where W is the Wronskian of the set S given
by (4.1.3). Since S is by assumption a linearly independent set for all x in (4.1.2) solution
domain D, we have that
W[φ1, φ2, . . . , φn](x) ̸= 0
for all x ∈D.
Hence A is an invertible matrix in D so that the algebraic system (4.1.7) has a unique
solution. We recall, Proposition 1.1.6, given in Chapter 1, for the existence and uniqueness
of the solutions of linear diﬀerential equations.
In the sections that follow we give several examples of initial-value problems, although
we mainly consider linear constant coeﬃcient equations.

4.2
Linear homogeneous constant coeﬃcients equations
In this section we discuss the problem to ﬁnd the general solution for the n-th order linear
homogeneous ordinary diﬀerential equation with constant coeﬃcients, that is
pny(n) + pn−1y(n−1) + · · · + p1y′ + p0y = 0
(4.2.1)
where pj (j = 0, 1, . . . , n) are given real constants and pn ̸= 0.
To ﬁnd the general solution of (4.2.1) we make use of the following
Proposition 4.2.1.
a) The Ansatz
y(x) = eλx,
λ ∈C
(4.2.2)
is a (possibly complex) solution of
pny(n) + pn−1y(n−1) + · · · + p1y′ + p0y = 0
for all x ∈R, for every (possibly complex) solution λ of the algebraic equation
Pn(λ) := pnλn + pn−1λn−1 + · · · + p1λ + p0 = 0.
(4.2.3)
Equation (4.2.3) is known as the characteristic equation of the diﬀerential
equation (4.2.1) regarding the Ansatz (4.2.2). The n-th degree polynomial Pn(λ)
is known as the characteristic polynomial and the solutions of (4.2.3) are the
roots of Pn(λ).
b) If λ is a complex solution of the characteristic equation (4.2.3), i.e,
λ = α + iβ (α ∈R, β ∈R)
then the associated complex solution
φc(x) = ψ1(x) + iψ2(x)
of (4.2.1) results in two real solution for (4.2.1), namely
ψ1(x) = Re[φc(x)] = eαx cos(βx),
ψ2(x) = Im[φc(x)] = eαx sin(βx).
Proof:
a) Diﬀerentiating the Ansatz
y(x) = eλx,

n times, we obtain
y′(x) = λeλx,
y′′(x) = λ2eλx, . . . , y(n)(x) = λneλx,
(4.2.4)
so that (4.2.1) leads to
eλx 
pnλn + pn−1λn−1 + · · · + p1λ + p0

= 0.
Since eλx ̸= 0 for all x ∈R, we conclude that λ must be a root of the n-th degree
characteristic polynomial Pn(λ) (4.2.3) in order for y(x) = eλx to satisfy the n-th
order diﬀerential equation (4.2.1).

where λ is a root of Pn(λ). It follows that
ψ1(x) = Re[φc(x)] = eαx cos(βx),
ψ2(x) = Im[φc(x)] = eαx sin(βx),
as stated.

Consider the third-order equation

Applying the Ansatz (4.2.2), we obtain the characteristic equation
P3(λ) := λ3 −λ2 + λ −1 = 0
which obviously admits the root λ = 1. Dividing P3(λ) by λ −1, we obtain λ2 + 1. Hence
P3(λ) factorizes in the form
P3(λ) = (λ −1)(λ2 + 1) = 0
and the three roots (one real- and two complex roots) are
λ1 = 1,
λ2 = i,
λ3 = −i ≡¯λ2 (bar denotes the complex conjugate).
This leads to three solutions for (4.2.5), namely
φ1(x) = ex,
φc1(x) = eix,
φc2(x) = e−ix.
Since e±ix = cos x ± i sin x, the two complex solutions take the form
φc2(x) = cos x + i sin x,
φc3(x) = cos x −i sin x,
The real- and imaginary parts of both φ2c and φ3c are solutions of (4.2.5), i.e. we obtain
four real solutions for (4.2.5) from φ2c and φ3c, but obviously only two of those are linearly
independent, namely
φ2(x) = cos x = Re[φ2c] ≡Re[φ3c],
φ3(x) = sin x = Im[φ2c] ≡Im[−φ3c]
We now have a set of three real solutions, S = {φ1(x) = ex, φ2(x) = cos x, φ2(x) =
sin x}, for (4.2.5). It is easy to check that S is a linearly independent set in C∞(R), e.g.
W[φ1, φ2, φ3](0) = 2. Thus the general solution of (4.2.5) is
y(x) = c1ex + c2 cos x + c3 sin x
for all x ∈R with c1, c2, c3 arbitrary constants. We now solve the initial-value problem
for the given initial data. Diﬀerentiating the general solution twice, we obtain
y′(x) = c1ex −c2 sin x + c3 cos x
y′′(x) = c1ex −c2 cos x −c3 sin x.
For the given initial data we now have the following linear algebraic system:
y(0) = c1 + c2 = 1
y′(0) = c1 + c3 = 2
y′′(0) = c1 −c2 = 3,
which has the unique solution
c1 = 2,
c2 = −1,
c3 = 0.

Hence the solution of the initial-value problem is
y(x) = 2ex −cos x
for all x ∈R.
——————————————
We note that the root λ3 = −i was not needed for the general solution, since this is the
complex conjugate of the root λ2 and it gives the same (up to sign) real solutions for its
real- and imaginary parts. This is a general property:
If λk is a complex root of the characteristic equation, then the complex conjugate of this
root is also a root of the characteristic polynomial (see Proposition 4.2.2), but this com-
plex conjugate root does not lead to new linearly independent solutions for the diﬀerential
equation.

What are the diﬃculties?
One should point out that the diﬃculty of the task to ﬁnd the general solution of an n-th
order homogeneous equation with constant coeﬃcients is due to the following questions:
1. How can we ﬁnd all the roots of the n-th degree characteristic polynomial equation
Pn(λ) := pnλn + pn−1λn−1 + · · · + p1λ + p0 = 0?
Although we know that n roots always exists, it is in general not possible to ﬁnd
them. However, there are some properties of n-degree polynomials that can be useful
to ﬁnd the roots (see Proposition 4.2.2 below).
2. How can we select n linearly independent solutions from the list of all solutions
obtained by the Ansatz
y(x) = eλx,
for the roots λj of the corresponding characteristic equation?
This is in fact not a diﬃcult problem and the answer is provided by Propositions
4.2.3.
3. How should we construct a suﬃcient number of linearly independent solutions for the
case when the characteristic polynomial Pn(λ) admits roots with multiplicity k > 1,
i.e. when the same root appears k times (k ∈N)?
We provide a statement for this construction in Proposition 4.2.4.
We now address the above questions and provide general statements that will help
overcome the mentioned diﬃculties.

Proposition 4.2.2. Properties of n-degree polynomials with real coeﬃcients:
A polynomial of degree n,
Pn(λ) = pnλn + pn−1λn−1 + · · · + p1λ + p0.
(4.2.6)
where pj are all real numbers, has the following properties:
a) Pn(λ) has exactly n roots (including multiplicity, i.e., roots with the same values),
λ1, λ2, . . . , λn (real and/or complex) and the resulting factorization
Pn(λ) = pn(λ −λ1)(λ −λ2) · · · (λ −λn).
b) If λk is a complex root of Pn(λ), then the complex conjugate of λk, denoted by
¯λk, is also a root of Pn(λ).
c) Pn(λ) can be factorized in terms of ﬁrst-degree polynomial factors that have only
real coeﬃcients and/or second-degree polynomial factors that have only real coef-
ﬁcients.
d) The n-th degree polynomial Pn(λ) = λn −a0 admits the following n distinct roots:

where k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n −1 and θ = π for a0 < 0 or θ = 0 for a0 > 0.
e) Vi´eta’s Theorem: Pn(λ) admits the following relationship between its roots

coeﬃcients pj ∈C, whereas properties b) and c) only hold when all coeﬃcients pj of Pn(λ)
are real. Property d) holds also for a0 complex, but then θ is the argument of the complex
number a0.
A well known application of the last relation in Vi´eta’s Theorem, namely the statement
λ1λ2 . . . λn = (−1)n p0
pn
, is the following.
Vi´eta’s statement for integer roots: Consider Pn(λ) which contain only real coeﬃ-
cients. Assume that all roots λj of Pn(λ) belong to the set of integers Z. If q = p0
pn
∈Z,
then q
λj
∈Z for every root of Pn(λ).
This means that in the case where q = p0
pn
∈Z for a given Pn(λ), we can search for roots
αj by checking all the divisors αj ∈Z of q, i.e. all αj such that q
αj
∈Z.

Higher-order linear dierential equations
Example 4.2.2.
——————————————
Consider the 4th degree polynomial
P4(λ) = λ4 −6λ3 + 3λ2 + 26λ −24.
In this case q = p0
p4
= −24. Hence q is divisible by the following set of numbers:
S = {±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±12, ±24}.
Inserting each number in the above set S into P4(λ) we ﬁnd four roots, since
P4(1) = 0, P4(−2) = 0, P4(3) = 0, P4(4) = 0.
Hence, the four roots of P4(λ) are
λ1 = 1, λ2 = −2, λ3 = 3, λ4 = 4.
——————————————
Historical Note: (source: Wikipedia)
Francois Vi´ete (1540 – 1603) was a French mathematician whose work on new algebra
was an important step towards modern algebra, due to its innovative use of letters as
parameters in equations. Vi´eta’s formulas are formulas that relate the coeﬃcients of a
polynomial to sums and products of its roots.
We now address the problem to select the set of linearly independent real solutions for
pny(n) + pn−1y(n−1) + · · · + p1y′ + p0y = 0
(4.2.7)
(where pj are real constants) provided by the Ans¨atze
y(x) = eλx
and y(x) = w(x)eλx
(4.2.8)
for every root of the characteristic equation λ of Pn(λ).
The following proposition states the linear independence of several sets of functions in
C∞(R). These include all the functions that may appear as solution of (4.2.7) from the
Ans¨atze (4.2.8). To prove this we can use the Wronskian and show that the Wronskian is
non-zero in any point x0 ∈R, say the point x0 = 0. The proof is left as an exercise.

Proposition 4.2.3. Let λ1, λ2, . . . , λk be distinct real numbers (k ∈N). Then the
following sets are linearly independent in the vector space C∞(R):
1. S1 =

eλ1x, eλ2x, . . . , eλkx
2. S2 =

eλjx, x eλjx, x2 eλjx, . . . , xm eλjx

,
m ∈N.
Clearly S1 and S2 are subsets of S3.
Let αj be distinct nonzero real numbers for j = 1, 2, . . . and let βj be distinct nonzero
real numbers for j = 1, 2, . . .. Then the following sets are linearly independent in the
vector space C∞(R):
4. Q =

cos(βjx), sin(βjx), x cos(βjx), x sin(βjx), x2 cos(βjx), x2 sin(βjx), . . . ,
xm cos(βjx), xm sin(βjx), eαjx cos(βjx), eαjx sin(βjx), x eαjx cos(βjx),
x eαjx sin(βjx), x2 eαjx cos(βjx), x2 eαjx sin(βjx), . . . , xn eαjx cos(βjx),
xn eαjx sin(βjx)},
for all j ∈N, m = 0, 1, 2, . . . and n = 0, 1, 2, . . ..
The set {Q, S3} is also linearly independent, as is any subset of this.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

We ﬁnd the general solution for the 6-th order equation

λ5, respectively. However, complex conjugate roots lead to the same real solutions (up
to sign) as for λ0, λ1, and λ2 and do therefore not make a contribution to the linearly

Roots with multiplicity of degree k > 1:
The characteristic polynomial Pn(λ) may admit roots, say λ0, with multiplicity of degree
k ∈N, where k ≤n. This means that Pn(λ) admits the same root k times and that Pn(λ)
factorizes in the form
Pn(λ) = (λ −λ0)kQn−k(λ),
where Qn−k is a polynomial of degree n −k. If λ0 ∈R, then the Ansatz y(x) = eλ0x
provides only one distinct real solution for the equation
pny(n) + pn−1y(n−1) + · · · + p1y′ + p0y = 0,
pj ∈R
and, if λ0 ∈C it provides two real linearly independent solutions. More solutions can then
be obtained for the diﬀerential equation by the Ansatz
y(x) = eλ0xw(x),
where w(x) is a function in C∞(R) that needs to be determined for this Ansatz. This
results in the following

Proposition 4.2.4.
a) Suppose that the characteristic equation Pn(λ) = 0 of the homogeneous equation
pny(n) + pn−1y(n−1) + · · · + p1y′ + p0y = 0,
pj ∈R
(4.2.10)
admits the real root λ = λ0 ∈R with multiplicity of degree k ∈N, with k ≤n.
Then the Ansatz
y(x) = eλ0xw(x),
w(x) ∈C∞(R),
leads to the following set of linearly independent solutions for (4.2.10):

eλ0x, xeλ0x, x2eλ0x, . . . , xk−1eλ0x
.
(4.2.11)
b) Suppose that the characteristic equation Pn(λ) = 0 of the homogeneous equation
(4.2.10) admits the complex root λ0 = α + iβ (α ∈R, β ∈R) with multiplicity of
degree k ∈N, with k ≤n. Then the Ansatz
y(x) = eλ0xw(x),
w(x) ∈C∞(R),
leads to the following set of linearly independent solutions for (4.2.10):

eαx cos(βx), eαx sin(βx), x eαx cos(βx), x eαx sin(βx),
(4.2.12)
x2 eαx cos(βx), x2 eαx sin(βx), . . . , xk−1 eαx cos(βx), xk−1 eαx sin(βx)

.
The proof is left as an exercise. See Exercises 4.2.1 numbers 4 and 5 for two special cases
of the general third- and fourth-order equations.
Example 4.2.5.
——————————————
a) We ﬁnd the general solution of the third-order equation
y(3) −6y′′ + 12y′ −8y = 0.
(4.2.13)
For the Ansatz y(x) = eλx, the characteristic equation takes the form
P3(λ) = λ3 −6λ2 + 12λ −8 = (λ −2)3 = 0.
Hence this third degree characteristic polynomial P3(λ) admits only one root, namely
the real root λ = 2 and this root has multiplicity of degree 3. By Proposition 4.2.4

Higher-order linear dierential equations
the root λ = 2 leads to a set of three linearly independent solutions for the equation
(4.2.13), namely

e2x, xe2x, x2e2x
,
so that the general solution of (4.2.13) is of the form
y(x) = c1e2x + c2xe2x + c3x2e2x
for all x ∈R.
b) We ﬁnd the general solution of the ﬁfth-order equation
y(5) −2y(4) + 2y(3) −4y′′ + y′ −2y = 0.
(4.2.14)
For the Ansatz y(x) = eλx, the characteristic equation takes the form
P5(λ) = λ5 −2λ4 + 2λ3 −4λ2 + λ −2 = (λ −2)(λ2 + 1)2 = 0.
Hence P5(λ) admits the following roots:
λ1 = 2, λ2 = i, λ3 = i, λ4 = −i, λ5 = −i.
Note that the complex root i has a multiplicity of degree two and so does the complex
root −i. These roots give the following solutions of (4.2.14):
λ1 = 2 :
φ1(x) = e2x
λ2 = i :
complex solution: φ1c(x) = eix; real solutions: ψ1(x) = cos x, ψ2(x) = sin x
λ3 = i :
real solutions due to 2nd-degree multiplicity: ψ3(x) = x cos x, ψ4(x) = x sin x.
The ﬁve solutions {φ1(x), ψ1(x), ψ2(x), ψ3(x), ψ4(x)} form a linearly independent
set in C∞(R), so that the general solution of (4.2.14) is
y(x) = c1e2x + c2 cos x + c3 sin x + c4x cos x + c5x sin x
for all x ∈R.
c) We ﬁnd the general solution of the fourth-order equation
y(4) + 4y(3) + 8y′′ + 8y′ + 4y = 0.
(4.2.15)
For the Ansatz y(x) = eλx, the characteristic equation takes the form
P4(λ) = λ4 + 4λ3 + 8λ2 + 8λ + 4 = (λ2 + 2λ + 2)2
= (λ + 1 + i)2(λ + 1 −i)2 = 0.

The root −1 −i gives the complex solution
φ1c(x) = e−x(cos x −i sin x)
and hence two real solutions
ψ1(x) = e−x cos x,
ψ2(x) = e−x sin x.
Since the root −1 −i has the multiplicity of degree two, two more real solutions are
ψ3(x) = xe−x cos x,
ψ4(x) = xe−x sin x.
The root λ3 = λ4 is the complex conjugates of the root λ1 = λ2 so that it does
not contribute to more linearly independent solutions for (4.2.15).
The set S =
{ψ1(x), ψ2(x), ψ3(x), ψ4(x)} is linearly independent, so that the general solution
of (4.2.15) is
y(x) = c1e−x cos x + c2e−x sin x + c3xe−x cos x + c4xe−x sin x
for all x ∈R.

Higher-order linear dierential equations
The statement below follows directly from the linear superposition principle:
Proposition 4.3.1.
a) The general solution of (4.3.1), i.e.
pn(x)y(n) + pn−1(x)y(n−1) + · · · + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = f(x)
is of the form
y(x) = φH(x; c1, c2, . . . , cn) + yp(x),
(4.3.2)
where φH is the general solution of the associated homogeneous equation,
pn(x)y(n) + pn−1(x)y(n−1) + · · · + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = 0
and yp is a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation (4.3.1).
b) A particular solution yp(x) for the nonhomogeneous equation
pn(x)y(n) + pn−1(x)y(n−1) + · · · + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = f1(x) + f2(x), (4.3.3)
where pj(x), f1(x) and f2(x) are given continuous functions on D, is given by the
sum of a particular solution for f1(x) and a particular solution for f2(x), i.e.
yp(x) = y1(x) + y2(x),
(4.3.4)
where y1(x) is a particular solution for
pn(x)y(n) + pn−1(x)y(n−1) + · · · + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = f1(x)
and y2(x) is a particular solution for
pn(x)y(n) + pn−1(x)y(n−1) + · · · + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = f2(x).
The proof is left as an exercise (see Exercises 4.3.2).
We’ll now describe two methods to construct particular solutions for nonhomogeneous
equations, namely the method of undetermined coeﬃcients and the method of
variation of parameters.
These methods have already been described in detail for
second-order equations, so here we’ll just need to generalize these methods to higher-order
equations.
4.3.1
Particular solutions: the method of undetermined coeﬃcients
Consider the n-th order linear nonhomogeneous equation with constant coeﬃcients
pny(n) + pn−1y(n−1) + · · · + p1y′ + p0y = f(x)

Higher-order linear dierential equations
where pj ∈R, pn ̸= 0 and f(x) is a continuous function on some domain D ⊆R. As in the
case of second-order equations, we consider special forms of the function f(x) and propose
Ans¨atze for particular solutions yp(x) in each case.
Case I: f(x) = Pm(x):
Consider
pny(n) + pn−1y(n−1) + · · · + p1y′ + p0y = Pm(x)
(4.3.6)
where Pm is an mth-degree polynomial, i.e.,
Pm(x) = amxm + am−1xm−1 + · · · + a1x + a0.
(4.3.7)
Here aj (j = 0, 1, . . . , m) are given real coeﬃcients. We can now propose Ans¨atze to ﬁnd
particular solutions of (4.3.6) and we need to distinguish between n+1 diﬀerent subcases:
Case I (1): Let p0 ̸= 0 . The Ansatz for a particular solution of (4.3.6) is then
yp(x) = Amxm + Am−1xm−1 + · · · + A1x + A0 := Qm(x),
(4.3.8)
where the real constants, Aj, j = 0, 1, . . . , m, are to be determined for the Ansatz (4.3.8).
Case I (2): Let p0 = 0 and p1 ̸= 0 . The Ansatz for a particular solution of (4.3.6) is
then
yp(x) = xQm(x),
(4.3.9)
where Qm(x) is given by (4.3.8).
Case I (3): Let p0 = 0 and p1 = 0 and p2 ̸= 0 . The Ansatz for a particular solution of
(4.3.6) is then
yp(x) = x2Qm(x),
(4.3.10)
where Qm(x) is given by (4.3.8).
...
Case I (n+1): Let pn ̸= 0 and pk = 0 for k = 0, 1, 2 . . . , n −1 . The Ansatz for a par-
ticular solution of (4.3.6) is then
yp(x) = xnQm(x),
(4.3.11)
where Qm(x) is given by (4.3.8).

Case II: f(x) = eα1x cos(α2x) Pm(x) or f(x) = eα1x sin(α2x) Pm(x), α1, α2 ∈R
We consider the following linear complex diﬀerential equation with dependent complex
variable yc(x):
pny(n)
c
+ pn−1y(n−1)
c
+ · · · + p1y′
c + p0yc = eαxPm(x), α := α1 + iα2
(4.3.12)
where α1 ∈R, α2 ∈R and Pm is an mth-degree polynomial, i.e.,
Pm(x) = amxm + am−1xm−1 + · · · + a1x + a0
(4.3.13)
with aj, j = 0, 1, . . . , m real coeﬃcients. Here α is a complex number, such that α =
α1 + iα2, with α1, α2 real. Every diﬀerentiable complex function yc(x) can be written in
the form
yc(x) = u(x) + iv(x),
(4.3.14)
where u and v are real diﬀerentiable functions on some domain D ⊆R and
y(k)
c (x) = u(k)(x) + iv(k)(x),
k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
(4.3.15)
Using (4.3.14) and (4.3.15), equation (4.3.12) takes the form
pn

u(n) + iv(n)
+ pn−1

u(n−1) + iv(n−1)
+ · · · + p0(u + iv)
= eα1x cos(α2x) Pm(x) + ieα1x sin(α2x) Pm(x),
(4.3.16)
where we have used the relation
e(α1+iα2)x = eα1x (cos(α2x) + i sin(α2x)) .
(4.3.17)
Comparing the real- and imaginary parts of (4.3.1), respectively, we obtain the following
two real nonhomogeneous diﬀerential equations in u and v:
pnu(n) + pn−1u(n−1) + · · · + p1u′ + p0u = eα1x cos(α2x) Pm(x)
(4.3.18)
and

Higher-order linear dierential equations
Example 4.3.1.
——————————————
We ﬁnd the general solution of the third-order equation
y(3) + y = e2x sin(3x).
(4.3.21)
Using the Ansatz y(x) = eλx for the homogeneous equation, the characteristic equation is
λ3 + 1 = 0
and the three roots are λ1 = −1, λ2 = 1
2 + i
√

2
and λ3 = ¯λ2. This leads to the following
general solution φH(x; c1, c2, c3) of the homogeneous equation:
φH(x; c1, c2, c3) = c1e−x + c2ex/2 cos(
√
3x/2) + c3ex/2 sin(
√
3x/2).
To ﬁnd a particular solution for (4.3.21) we consider the complex diﬀerential equation
y(3)
c
+ yc = e(2+3i)x,
(4.3.22)
where
yc(x) = u(x) + iy(x),
so that the imaginary part of the complex equation (4.3.22) is the given real equation
(4.3.22). Therefore, an Ansatz for the complex particular solution ycp(x) of (4.3.22) is
given by Proposition 4.3.2, i.e.
ycp(x) = e(2+3i)xwc(x).
(4.3.23)
A real particular solution yp(x) for (4.3.22) is then
yp(x) = Im [ycp(x)] .
Inserting Ansatz (4.3.23) into the complex equation (4.3.22) we obtain the following con-
dition on wc(x):

(4.3.24)
Following Case I we should make an Ansatz for wc(x) of a zero-degree polynomial with
a complex coeﬃcient, i.e.
wc(x) = B0,
(4.3.25)
where B0 is a complex constant that needs to be determined such that (4.3.25) satisﬁes
(4.3.24). Inserting this Ansatz into (4.3.24), we obtain

Case III f(x) = eαxPm(x),
α ∈R
We consider the equation
pny(n) + pn−1y(n−1) + · · · + p1y′ + p0y = eαxPm(x),
α ∈R,
(4.3.26)
where Pm is an m-th-degree polynomial with real coeﬃcients. We note that this is in fact
a special case of (4.3.12), with yc(x) a real function y(x) and α ∈R. The same Ansatz
(4.3.20) is valid, albeit for a real particular solution yp(x) of (4.3.26), namely
yp(x) = eαx w(x)
(4.3.27)
where the condition on w is a linear nonhomogeneous equation with nonhomogeneous part
Pm(x). To ﬁnd a solution w(x) of this equation we use the same Ans¨atze as those listed
in Case I.
Example 4.3.2.
——————————————
We ﬁnd the general solution of the third-order equation
y(3) −y′′ + y′ −y = xex.
(4.3.28)
First we use the Ansatz y(x) = eλx to ﬁnd the general solution of the homogeneous
equation
y(3) −y′′ + y′ −y = 0.

The characteristic equation is
λ3 −λ2 + λ −1 = 0
or (λ −1)(λ2 + 1) = 0.
The root λ1 = 1 gives the real solution ex, whereas the complex root λ2 = i gives two real
solutions {cos x, sin x}, so that the general homogeneous solution φH(x; c1, c2, c3) is
φH(x; c1, c2, c3) = c1ex + c2 cos x + c3 sin x
for all x ∈R and arbitrary constants c1, c2 and c3. For a particular solution of (4.3.28) we
make use of the Ansatz proposed in Case III above, namely yp(x) = exw(x). This leads
to the condition
w(3) + 2w′′ + 2w′ = x
and by Case I we use the Ansatz w(x) = x (A1x + A0) . This results in the condition
4A1 + 4A1x + 2A0 = x, so that 4A1 = 1 and 4A1 +2A0 = 0. Hence A1 = 1

4.3.3
Particular solutions: the method of variation of parameters
We now describe the method of variation of parameters by generalizing Proposition
3.3.2 of Chapter 3, where we have studied this method for second-order equations. We
should recall that the method of variation of parameters is more general than the method
of undetermined coeﬃcients, as it is applicable to equations which have continuous func-
tions as coeﬃcients and it does not require a special form of the functions f(x) of the
nonhomogeneous part of the equation, neither does it require lots of diﬀerent Ans¨atze.
However, the derivation of particular solutions with this method does require the calcula-
tion of integrals, which can be diﬃcult and tedious at times.
In order to state the next proposition it is convenient to introduce a new notation: Consider
a linearly independent set of functions S = {φ1(x), φ2(x), . . . , φn(x)} in Cn(D) and a
continuous function f(x) on the interval D. We now deﬁne
Wj[φ1, . . . , φj−1, (f), φj+1, . . . , φn](x)

Higher-order linear dierential equations
Proposition 4.3.3. Consider the n-th order nonhomogeneous linear diﬀerential equa-
tion
pn(x)y(n) + pn−1(x)y(n−1) + · · · + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = f(x),
(4.3.30)
where pj(x) (j = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n) and f(x) are continuous functions given on some com-
mon domain D ⊆R, n ≥1 and pn(x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈D. Assume that n linearly
independent solutions of the homogeneous equation
pn(x)y(n) + pn−1(x)y(n−1) + · · · + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = 0
(4.3.31)
are given by the set of Cn(D) functions S = {φ1(x), φ2(x), . . . , φn(x)} on the interval
D ⊆R. Then a particular solution yp(x) of (4.3.30) is
yp(x) = w1(x)φ1(x) + w2(x)φ2(x) + · · · + wn(x)φn(x),
(4.3.32)
where wj(x) (j = 1, 2, . . . , n) have the following form:
w1(x) =
 W1[(f), φ2, φ3, . . . , φn](x)
W[φ1, φ2, . . . , φn](x)

w2(x) =

dx
...
wn(x) =
 Wn[φ1, φ2, . . . , φn−1, (f)](x)
W[φ1, φ2, . . . , φn](x)
dx
Here
W[φ1, φ2, . . . , φn](x)
is
the
Wronskian
of
the
set
S
and
the
notation
Wj[φ1, . . . , φj−1, (f), φj+1, . . . , φn](x) is deﬁned by (4.3.29).
Proof: We consider ﬁrst the case n = 3, that is the nonhomogeneous equation
p3(x)y(3) + p2(x)y′′ + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = f(x).
(4.3.33)
Assume that three linearly independent solutions, namely
{φ1(x), φ2(x), φ3(x)},
are given for the homogeneous equation
p3(x)y(3) + p2(x)y′′ + p1(x)y′ + p0(x)y = 0.
(4.3.34)
We now use the following Ansatz for a particular solution of (4.3.33):
yp(x) = w1φ1(x) + w2(x)φ2(x) + w3(x)φ3(x).
(4.3.35)
The ﬁrst derivative y′
p(x) is

(4.3.42)
Inserting the Ansatz (4.3.35) and its derivatives, (4.3.38), (4.3.41), and (4.3.42) into the
third-order equation (4.3.33), we obtain

(4.3.43)

Note that the determinant of the coeﬃcient matrix on the left side is the Wronskian
W[φ1, φ2, φ3](x), which is nonzero by the assumption that the set {φ1(x), φ2(x), φ3(x)}
is linearly independent.
Thus the algebraic system (4.3.44) has a unique solution for

Integrating the above expressions with respect to x establishes the Proposition for the
case n = 3. In the same way we can show that the formulas hold for n ≥4, but this is
straightforward so we leave it as an exercise (See Exercises 4.3.4).

Higher-order linear dierential equations
Example 4.3.3.
——————————————
We ﬁnd the general solution for the equation
y(3) −3y′′ + 3y′ −y = 3√x ex
(4.3.45)
For the homogeneous equation
y(3) −3y′′ + 3y′ −y = 0,
we use the Ansatz y(x) = eλx to obtain the characteristic equation
(λ −1)3 = 0.
The three linearly independent solutions are then
{φ1(x) = ex, φ2(x) = xex, φ3(x) = x2ex}
so that the general solution φH of the homogeneous equation becomes
φH(x; c1, c2, c3) = c1ex + c2xex + c3x2ex.
For a particular solution yp(x) we apply the method of variation of parameters. Following
Proposition 4.3.3 we use the Ansatz
yp(x) = w1(x)ex + w2(x)xex + w3(x)x2ex
(4.3.46)
where
w′
1(x) = W1[(3√x ex), φ2, φ3](x)

and hence the general solution of (4.3.45) is

for all x > 0.

The higher-order Cauchy-Euler equation
The n-th order linear equation

(4.4.1)
where p0, p1, . . . , pn are constants, pn ̸= 0, and the function f(x) is continuous on some
interval D ⊆R, is called the Cauchy-Euler equation of order n.
Similar to the second-order Cauchy-Euler equation discussed in Chapter 3, equation
(4.4.1) also can be transformed into a linear nonhomogeneous equation with constant
coeﬃcients of its homogeneous part. For x > 0 the change of variables is

Equation (4.4.9) then transforms into
d3y
dz3 −9d2y
dz2 + 26dy
dz −24y(z) = 4e4z.
(4.4.10)
For the homogeneous part of this equation, i.e.
d3y
dz3 −9d2y
dz2 + 26dy
dz −24y(z) = 0
we make the Ansatz
y(z) = eλz
and obtain the characteristic equation
λ3 −9λ2 + 26λ −24 = 0
with the roots λ1 = 2, λ2 = 3, λ3 = 4.
Hence the general homogeneous solution
φH(z; c1, c2, c3) is
φH(z; c1, c2, c3) = c1e2z + c2e3z + c3e4z.
For a particular solution of (4.4.10) we make the Ansatz (see Case II in Section 4.3.1 of
the method of undetermined coeﬃcients)
yp(z) = w(z)e4z
which leads to
d3w
dz3 + 3d2w
dz2 + 2dw
dz = 4.

Higher-order linear dierential equations
To ﬁnd a solution for w(z) that satisﬁes this condition we use the Ansatz (see Case I in
Section 4.3.1 of the method of undetermined coeﬃcients)
w(z) = zA0
(A0 is a constant) and obtain A0 = 2, so that w(z) = 2z and a particular solution for
(4.4.10) is
yp(z) = 2ze4z.
The general solution of (4.4.10) is then
y(z) = c1e2z + c2e3z + c3e4z + 2ze4z
and back-substituting z = ln x we obtain the general solution of (4.4.9), namely
y(x) = c1x2 + c2x3 + c3x4 + 2x4 ln x.

Appendix A
Integral operators: an alternative
approach for solving linear
diﬀerential equations
In this appendix we make use of linear operators to derive formulae for the general solution
of linear diﬀerential equations of order n. This provides an alternative method, to those
proposed in the previous chapter, to ﬁnd the (general) solutions of these equations without
the need of any Ans¨atze.. The key lies in the factorization of the linear diﬀerential opera-
tors that determine the diﬀerential equation in terms of ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators.
For linear equations with nonconstant coeﬃcients, the condition for the factorization of
the operators is in the form of Riccati equations. This method also provides an alterna-
tive method to the method of variation of parameters and the method of undetermined
coeﬃcients for the calculation of particular solutions of linear nonhomogeneous equations,
which we studied in Chapters 3 and 4.
A.1
The deﬁnition of ˆL
In this section we introduce linear operators and introduce an integral operator that cor-
responds to a general ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerential operator. This integral operator is the
key to the integration of the linear equations.
We remind that C(D) denotes the vector space of all continuous functions on some do-
main D ⊆R and Cn(D) the subspace of C(D) consisting of all n-continuously diﬀerentiable
functions on D.
Deﬁnition A.1.1. We deﬁne the linear transformation
L : Cn(D) →C(D)
for all f(x) ∈Cn(D) on the interval D ⊆R as
L : f(x) →Lf(x),

Example A.1.1.
——————————————
Consider the second-order linear operator
L = cos xD2
x + exDx + x2.
As an example, let us act L on both e2x and on u(x) e−x:

Deﬁnition A.1.2.
a) Consider two linear diﬀerential operators of the form (A.1.2), namely L1 of order
m and L2 of order n, and consider a function f(x) ∈Cm+n(D) with D ⊆R. The
composite operator L1 ◦L2 is deﬁned by
L1 ◦L2 f(x) := L1 (L2f(x))

where L1 ◦L2 is a linear diﬀerential operator of order m + n.

where L4 := xD3
x + (x3 + 1)D2

Deﬁnition A.1.3. Let a and b be continuous functions on some interval D ⊆R, such

A.2
Higher-order linear constant-coeﬃcient diﬀerential equa-
tions
In order to apply the method of linear operators and their corresponding integral operators
to solve higher-order linear diﬀerential equations, we need to factorize the higher-order
linear operators that determine the diﬀerential equations in terms of ﬁrst-order operators.
This is in principle always possible, but in practise there are some obstacles.
The linear operators for the constant-coeﬃcient homogeneous equation factorizes in
terms of ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators in the same manner as the characteristic equation
in λ for the Ansatz y(x) = eλx does. Take, for example, the second-order equation
y′′ + py′ + qy = f(x),
p ∈R, q ∈R,
(A.2.1)
with characteristic equation
λ2 + pλ + q = 0

λ2 = 1

(A.2.3)
Equation (A.2.1) can then be presented in the form
L y(x) = f(x),
(A.2.4)
where
L = D2
x + pDx + q.
(A.2.5)
It is now easy to show that the second-order operator (A.2.5) factorizes as
L = (Dx −λ1) ◦(Dx −λ2) ≡L1 ◦L2,
(A.2.6)
since
L1 ◦L2 y(x) = (Dx −λ1)(y′ −λ2y)
= y′′ −(λ1 + λ2)y′ + λ1λ2y = 0
and, by (A.2.3), λ1 + λ2 = −p and λ1λ2 = q. Thus
L u(x) = L1 ◦L2 y(x)
= y′′ + py′ + qy = f(x).
This directly extends to linear constant-coeﬃcient equations of any order n:
Proposition A.2.1. Consider a constant coeﬃcient nth-order nonhomogeneous dif-
ferential equation of the form
L y(x) = f(x),
(A.2.7)
where
L = anDn
x + an−1Dn−1

aj ∈R, j = 0, 1, . . . , n.

degree polynomial
Pn(λ) = anλn + an−1λn−1 + · · · + a1λ + a0 = 0
(A.2.9)
which admits n roots, {λ1, λ2, . . . , λn}, (λ ∈R or C) so that (A.2.9) can be factorized
as

Proposition A.2.2. Consider the 2nd-order equation
y′′ + py′ + qy = f(x),
p, q ∈R
(A.2.12)
with characteristic equation
P2(λ) = λ2 + pλ + q = 0.
(A.2.13)
a) If the two roots, λ1 and λ2 of (A.2.13) are real and distinct numbers, then the
general solution of (A.2.12) is
y(x) = c1eλ1x + c2eλ2x + yp(x),
(A.2.14)

and c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
b) If the two roots, λ1 and λ2 of (A.2.13) are complex numbers, then λ2 = ¯λ1 (λ2 is
the complex conjugate of λ1) and the general solution of (A.2.12) is
y(x) = c1 Re

and c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants. Note that although λ1 and ¯λ1 are complex
numbers, the solution y(x) is always a real-valued function.
c) If the two roots for (A.2.13) are equal, i.e. λ1 = λ2 ∈R, then the general solution
of (A.2.12) is
y(x) = c1eλ1x + c2 x eλ1x + yp(x)
(A.2.18)

respectively. Acting ˆL1 on (A.2.20), i.e. ˆL1 ◦L1 ◦L2 y(x) = ˆL1f(x), we obtain

or
L2y(x) = eλ1x

f(x)e−λ1x dx + k3eλ1x,
(A.2.22)
where k3 ≡k2 −k1 is a constant of integration. Applying now ˆL2 on (A.2.22) leads to

(A.2.24)
If λ1 ̸= λ2, then (A.2.23) reduces (after integration by parts) to (A.2.14) for λ1 ∈R and
λ2 ∈R and to (A.2.16) for complex roots λ1 and λ2 = ¯λ1, or to (A.2.18) for equal roots
λ1 = λ2 ∈R.

Example A.2.1.
——————————————
We ﬁnd the general solution of
y′′ + 4y = 8x2.
(A.2.25)
The characteristic equation and its roots are λ2 +4 = 0 and λ1 = 2i, λ2 = −2i so (A.2.25)
can be presented in factorized form
L1 ◦L2 y(x) = 8x2,
where
L1 = Dx −2i,
L2 = Dx + 2i.
Following Proposition A.2.2, the general solution, φH(x), of the homogeneous part of
(A.2.25) is
φH(x; c1, c2) = c1 cos(2x) + c2 sin(2x).
(A.2.26)
For a particular solution yp(x) we use formula (A.2.17) and calculate the integrals:

The general solution of (A.2.25) is thus

where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.

For an nth-order linear constant-coeﬃcient equations we then have

To prove Proposition A.2.3 we apply the corresponding integral operators on (A.2.29) and
identify the patterns. The details are left as an exercise.
Remark: For complex roots, {λ1, λ2, . . . , λn}, the expression for φH(x; c1, c2, . . . , cn),
(A.2.31), will be a complex-valued solution for (A.2.27) for which the real- and the imagi-
nary parts are real-valued solutions of (A.2.27). One therefore needs to combine the real-
and imaginary parts of φH such that one remains with n linear independent real-valued so-
lutions. We remark further that (A.2.32) is always a real particular solution for (A.2.27),
even for the case where {λ1, λ2, . . . , λn} are complex roots of the characteristic equation.

We ﬁnd the general solution of
y(3) −y′′ + y′ −y = e2x cos x.
(A.2.33)
The characteristic equation is λ3 −λ2 + λ −1 = 0, with roots λ1 = 1, λ2 = i, λ3 = −i.
Thus (A.2.33) can be presented in the factorized form
L1 ◦L2 ◦L3 y(x) = e2x cos x,
where
L1 = Dx −1,
L2 = Dx −i,
L3 = Dx + i.

A.3
Higher-order linear nonconstant coeﬃcient diﬀerential
equations
First we consider second-order linear nonhomogeneous equations of the form
y′′ + g(x)y′ + h(x)y = f(x),
(A.3.1)
where f, g and h are diﬀerentiable functions on some common interval D ⊆R. Assume
a factorization in terms of two linear ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators,
L1 = Dx + q1(x),
L2 = Dx + q2(x),
(A.3.2)
such that (A.3.1) is equivalent to
L1 ◦L2 y(x) = f(x).
(A.3.3)
Now (A.3.3) takes the form
y′′ + (q1 + q2)y′ + (q1q2 + q′
2)y = f(x)
(A.3.4)
and, comparing (A.3.4) to (A.3.1) leads to the condition
q1 + q2 = g(x),
q′
2 + q1q2 = h(x),
or, equivalently,
q′
2 = q2
2 −g(x)q2 + h(x),
q1(x) = g(x) −q2(x).
We note that the condition on q2(x) is a Riccati equation. To ﬁnd the general solution
of (A.3.3), we apply the corresponding integral operators ˆL1 and ˆL2, successively. This
leads to
Proposition A.3.1. The 2nd-order linear equation
y′′ + g(x)y′ + h(x)y = f(x)
(A.3.5)
can be written in the factorized form
L1 ◦L2 y(x) = f(x),
(A.3.6)
where L1 = Dx + q1(x) and L2 = Dx + q2(x), if and only if q2(x) satisﬁes the Riccati
equation

2 = q2

Then q1(x) = g(x) −q2(x). Applying the corresponding integral operators, ˆL1 and ˆL2
successively on (A.3.6), leads to the general solution of (A.3.5), namely
y(x) = c1e−ξ2(x) + c2e−ξ2(x)

eξ2(x)e−ξ1(x)dx + yp(x),
(A.3.8)
where yp(x) is a particular solution of (A.3.5) given by

We consider the second-order Cauchy-Euler equation

x ̸= 0,
(A.3.10)

As an explicit example we consider a = 1, b = −1 and c = 1. This corresponds to the
equation

A solution for (A.3.13) is then α = −1, so that
q2(x) = −1

Appendix A: Integral operators: an alternative approach
We give another example of a second-order nonconstant-coeﬃcient equation:
Example A.3.2.
——————————————
Consider the equation
y′′ + 2xy′ + (x2 + 1)y = e−x2/2.
(A.3.15)
Comparing (A.3.15) and (A.3.5) we identify
g(x) = 2x,
h(x) = x2 + 1,
so that, by Proposition A.3.1, equation (A.3.15) can be factorized in the form (A.3.6),
where q2 satisﬁes the following Riccati equation:
q′
2 = q2
2 −2xq2 + x2 + 1.
(A.3.16)
A special solution for (A.3.16) is
q2(x) = x
so that
q1(x) = x.
Hence (A.3.15) takes the factorized form
(Dx + x)(Dx + x) y(x) = e−x2/2.
By the solution formula (A.3.8), the general solution of (A.3.15) becomes
y(x) = c1e−x2/2 + c2xe−x2/2 + 1
2x2e−x2/2,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
——————————————
An extension to higher-order nonconstant-coeﬃcient linear equations is possible, al-
though the general condition for the factorization into ﬁrst-order linear operators becomes
rather complicated. To demonstrate this, we consider the third-order case:
y(3) + k(x)y′′ + g(x)y′ + h(x)y = f(x),
(A.3.17)
or, equivalently
L y(x) = f(x),
(A.3.18)
where L = D3
x + k(x)D2
x + g(x)Dx + h(x). Assume now a factorization in the form
(Dx + q1(x)) ◦(Dx + q2(x)) ◦(Dx + q3(x)) y(x) = f(x),
which leads to
y(3) + (q1 + q2 + q3)y′′ +

Appendix A: Integral operators: an alternative approach
Hence, we have the following relations between the coeﬃcients in (A.3.17) and (A.3.19):
k(x) = q1 + q2 + q3
(A.3.20a)
g(x) = q′
2 + 2q′
3 + q1q2 + q2q3 + q1q3
(A.3.20b)
h(x) = q′′
3 + q′
2q3 + q′
3q1 + q′
3q2 + q1q2q3
(A.3.20c)
We now consider the special case q3 = 1. The relations (A.3.20a) – (A.3.20c) lead to the
condition
h(x) + k(x) −g(x) −1 = 0.
Thus we can state that the equation
y(3) + k(x)y′′ + g(x)y′ + (1 + g(x) −k(x))y = f(x)
factorizes in the form
(Dx + q1(x)) ◦(Dx + q2(x)) ◦(Dx + 1) y(x) = f(x)
if and only if q2 satisﬁes the Riccati equation
q′
2 = q2
2 + (1 −k(x))q2 + 1 + g(x) −k(x)
Then q1(x) is given by the relation
q1(x) = k(x) −q2(x) −1.

Appendix B
Methods of integration
We sum up some of the important methods and substitutions which can be applied to
integrate certain continuous functions of one variable.
B.1
The method of substitution
Indeﬁnite Integrals:

f(g(x)) g′(x)dx =

f(u)du,
where
u = g(x);
du
dx = g′(x).
Deﬁnite Integrals:

a
f(g(x)) g′(x)dx =
g(b)

g(a)
f(u)du,
where
u = g(x);
du
dx = g′(x).
Examples for the method of substitution:
1. We calculate

x2(x3 + 2)2/3dx
Make the substitution u = x3 + 2. Then du
dx = 3x2, so that du = 3x2dx. Thus, in terms
of u, the integral becomes

Substitutions by completing the square
In some cases, where the integrand, f(x), in

f(x) dx
contains a second-degree polynomial,
ax2 + bx + c,
(a, b, c :
some given real constants)
we can ﬁnd a suitable substitution by completing the square. That is

x2 + b
ax + c

x + b

2

.
A suitable substitution could then be
u = x + b
2a.
An example: completing the square, substitution and inverse substitution:
We calculate

1
(x2 + 2x + 3)3/2 dx
First we complete the square for the term x2 + 2x + 3, i.e.
x2 + 2x + 3 = (x + 1)2 + 2.
We make the substitution u = x + 1. Then the integral becomes

1
(u2 + 2)3/2 du.
Now we use the inverse substitution u =
√
2 tan θ, so that
du
dθ =
√
2
cos2 θ
and
u2 + 2 = 2 + 2 tan2 θ = 2 + 2 sin2 θ
cos2 θ =
2
cos2 θ.

where c is a constant of integration.

Substitutions for n root expressions
In some cases, where the integrand, f(x), in

f(x) dx
contains an n-root expressions, e.g.
(ax + b)m/n ,
(a, b :
real constants, m ̸= n : integers Z\{−1, 0, 1},
a suitable substitution could be
ax + b = un/m.

Integration by parts
Consider two diﬀerentiable functions, f(x) and g(x), with continuous derivatives. Then
d
dx [f(x) g(x)] = f′(x)g(x) + f(x)g′(x).
Integrating the above, we obtain
f(x)g(x) =

f(x)g′(x) dx

By long division, divide Q into P. This will result in an expression of the form

where S and R are also polynomials, with Deg (R) < Deg (Q) and Deg (S) = Deg (P)−

Appendix B: Methods of integration
Case I: Let Q(x) be a product of k distinct linear factors. That is
Q(x) = (a1x + b1)(a2x + b2) · · · (akx + bk).
Then Q(x) can be written as the following sum of partial fractions:
P(x)
Q(x) =
A1
a1x + b1
+
A2
a2x + b2
+ · · · +
Ak
akx + bk
.
The constants, Aj, must then be determined such that the above relation is satisﬁed.
This is done by multiplying the above expression by Q and then comparing coeﬃcients
of diﬀerent powers of x. This will result in a linear system of algebraic equations which
determines A1, A2, . . . , Ak.
We then have
 P(x)
Q(x) dx =

A1
a1x + b1
dx +

A2
a2x + b2
dx + · · · +

Ak
akx + bk
dx.
Case II: Let Q(x) be a product of k linear factors, where some are repeated r ≤k times.
For example, say Q is of degree 4 which factorizes as follows:
Q(x) = (a1x + b1)2(a2x + b2)(a3x + c3)
Then the sum of partial fractions would be of the form
P(x)
Q(x) =
A1
a1x + b1
+
A2
(a1x + b1)2 +
A3
a2x + b2
+
A4
a3x + b3
.
Again, the constants Aj can be determined by multiplying the above expression by Q(x)
and comparing coeﬃcients of diﬀerent powers of x.
Case III: Assume that Q(x) can be factored in terms of linear factors and irreducible
second-degree factors of the form
pjx2 + qjx + sj,
q2
j −4pjsj < 0,
where none of the irreducible factors appear more than once in the product.
For example, say Q is of degree 6 and has factors of the form
Q(x) = (a1x + b1)(a2x + b2)(p1x2 + q1x + s1)(p2x2 + q2x + s2).
Then the sum of partial fractions would be of the form
P(x)
Q(x) =
A1
a1x + b1
+
A2
a2x + b2
+
B1x + C1
p1x2 + q1x + s1
+
B2x + C2
p2x2 + q2x + s2

For example, say Q is of degree 6 and has factors of the form
Q(x) = (a1x + b1)(a2x + b2)(p1x2 + q1x + s1)2.
That is, the irreducible second-degree factor appears two times. Then the sum of partial
fractions would be of the form

Exercise 1.1.1: nr. 1 b
We consider the set
S = {f1(x) = ln x, f2(x) = ln x2, f3(x) = e3x}
on the interval D = (0, ∞). Since ln x2 = 2 ln x, the set S is clearly a linearly dependent
set, as the equation
c1 ln x + 2c2 ln x + c3e3x = 0
has nontrivial solutions for c1 and c2. For example the above relation is true if c1 = −2,
c2 = 1 and c3 = 0 for all x ∈D. Therefore it follows by Proposition 1.1.2 that the
Wronskian is zero for all x ∈D. We verify this:

= −16.
Since the Wronskian is nonzero in a point in the interval R (in this case we have chosen
x = 0), it follows by Proposition 1.1.2 that the set S is linearly independent.
Exercise 1.1.1: nr. 2
We consider the set
S = {f1(x) = x2, , f2(x) = x|x|}
on R. For x > 0 the Wronskian for S is
W[f1, f2](x) =

x2
x2

2x
 = 2x3 −2x3 = 0
for all x ∈(0, ∞). For x < 0 the Wronskian of S is
W[f1, f2](x) =

x2
−x2
2x
−2x
 = −2x3 + 2x3 = 0
for all x ∈(−∞, 0). We note that for f2(x) = x|x|, the derivative of f2(x) in the point
x = 0 is
f′
2(0) = lim
h→0
f2(x + h) −f2(x)

(x + h)|x + h| −x|x|
h

x=0

h→0
h|h|
h

h→0 |h| = 0.
Hence the derivative of f1(x) and f2(x) exists at x = 0 and we can calculate the Wronskian
for S at x = 0:
W[f1, f2](0) =

0
0
0
0
 = 0.
From the above it follows that the Wronskian for S is zero for all x ∈R.
However,
Proposition 1.1.2 does not make a conclusion form this fact. So to establish whether
the set S is linearly independent or linearly dependent on R, we need to consider the
equation
c1x2 + c2x|x| = 0
and investigate the possibilities for c1 and c2 to satisfy this relation. We ﬁrst consider the
case x > 0. Then we have
c1x2 + c2x2 = 0

Appendix D: Solutions to some of the exercises
which leads to the condition c1 + c2 = 0 for all x ∈[0, ∞). Consider now the case x < 0,
for which we have
c1x2 −c2x2 = 0.
This leads to the condition c1 −c2 = 0 for all x ∈(−∞, 0]. For the case x = 0, we have
c10 −c20 = 0.
for which there are obviously no conditions on c1 or on c2.
Now, for all x ∈R both
conditions, c1 +c2 = 0 and c1 −c2 = 0, have to be satisﬁed, which is possible only if c1 = 0
and c2 = 0. Hence by Deﬁnition 1.1.3 the set S is linearly independent on R.

Exercise 1.1.1: nr. 3 b
We show that
y(x) = c1 cos(2x) + c2 sin(2x),
(c1, c2 arbitrary constants)
is the general solution for the equation
y′′ + 4y = 0
for all x ∈R.
We apply Proposition 1.1.5.
Thus we need to show that the set of
functions S = {φ1)(x) = cos(2x), φ2(x) = sin(2x)} is a linearly independent set for all
x ∈R and that φ1(x) and φ2(x) satisfy the given diﬀerential equation. We calculate the
Wronskian in x = 0:
W[φ1, φ2](0) =

cos(2x)
sin(2x)
−2 sin(2x)
2 cos(2x)

x=0
= 2.
By Proposition 1.1.2 it then follows that the set S is linearly independent on R. We
now diﬀerentiate φ1(x) and φ2(x) twice and insert those functions and their derivatives
into the diﬀerential equation to verify that φ1(x) and φ2(x) are indeed solutions of the
equation. It then follows by Proposition 1.1.5 that y(x) = c1 cos(2x) + c2 sin(2x) is the
general solution of y′′ + 4y = 0 for all x ∈R and that the solution domain is R.
Exercise 1.1.1: nr. 5 c
We construct a second-order homogeneous diﬀerential equation that admits the following
set of solutions:
S = {φ1(x) = x cos(1/x), φ2(x) = x sin(1/x)}.
We apply Proposition 1.1.4. To construct the equation, we ﬁrst need to show that the
set S is linearly independent. The diﬀerential equation with dependent variable y then
follows from the relation W[φ1, φ2, y](x) = 0, where W denotes the Wronskian of the set
{φ1(x), φ2(x), y(x)}.
To establish the linear independence of the set S, we apply Proposition 1.1.2 and
calculate the Wronskian in the point x = 1/π:
W[φ1, φ2](1/π) =

Exercise 1.2.1: 2
The functions
φ1(x) = e−x cos x,
φ2(x) = e−x sin x
satisfy the diﬀerential equation
y′′ + 2y′ + 2y = 0
so that these functions belong to the solution space of this diﬀerential equation. Moreover,
these functions form a linearly independent set,
B = {e−x cos x, e−x sin x}.
It can easily be veriﬁed that the set B is a linearly independent set by calculating the
Wronskian in, for example, the point x = 0. This gives
W[φ1, φ2](0) = 3π,
so that, by Proposition 1.1.2, the set B is linearly independent.
Furthermore, by
Proposition 1.2.2, the set B is a basis for the solution space of the diﬀerential equation
y′′ + 2y′ + 2y = 0. Since this basis consists of two functions, which are vectors in C∞(R),
the dimension of the solution space is two. The solution space is therefore a 2-dimensional
subspace of C∞(R) given by the kernel of T, where T is the linear transformation
T : y(x) →Ly(x),
L = d2

equation:
y′ + 1 −y2

for all x > 1. First consider the case
y(x) = ±1
which are obviously two solutions of the given diﬀerential equation for all x > 1. Consider
now the case y(x) ̸= ±1: We can separate the x−and y-variables and write the diﬀerential
equation in the form
dy
1 −y2 =

x2 −1.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Exercise 2.2.1: 3 b
We ﬁnd a general solution for
y2 −x2 + xyy′ = 0
by making the substitution
y(x) = xv(x),
where v(x) is a new dependent variable. The x-derivative is
y′ = v + xv′.
Substituting this into the diﬀerential equation we obtain a diﬀerential equation in the new
dependent variable v(x), namely the following ﬁrst-order equation:
xvv′ + 2v2 −1 = 0,
which is a separable equation. Separating the variables, leads to the following integrals:

For x > 0 we have the integrating factor −x, so that the equation takes the form
−xy′ −y = −x cos x,
which is, after multiplying by −1, the same as in the case x > 0. Thus the general solution
that we have obtained above holds for x > 0 and x < 0. Using now the initial condition
y(π/2) = 1, we determine the constant that picks out the curve which contains this point
(π/2, 1) from the family of one-parameter curves given by the above general solution with
the arbitrary parameter c1. We have
y(π/2) = sin(π/2) + 2
π cos(π/2) + 2c1
π

so that c1 = 0. Thus the solution of the initial-value problem is
y = sin x + 1

Exercise 2.4.4: 6
We solve the initial-value problem for the following Riccati equation:
(x −x4)y′ −x2 −y + 2xy2 = 0,
x ∈R\[0, 1],
where y(2) = 1. To ﬁnd a special solution φ(x), we make use of the Ansatz
φ(x) = kx2,
where k is an unknown real number. Inserting this Ansatz into the given equation, we
obtain
(x −x4)2kx −x2 −kx2 + 2x

kx22 = 0
or, after some simpliﬁcations,
(k −1)

x2 + 2kx5
= 0.
Thus, the Ansatz φ(x) = kx2 is a solution of the given equation for k = 1, i.e.
φ(x) = x2
satisﬁes the given Riccati equation. Following Proposition 2.4.3 we are now able to
linearize the given Riccati equation in terms of a new dependent variable v(x) by the
substitution
y(x) = x2 +
1
v(x).
The derivative of this substitution is
y′ = 2x −v′

Substituting this into the given Riccati equation, we obtain

so that the general solution of the linear equation becomes
v(x) =

Exercise 3.3.2: 1 h
We ﬁnd the general solution of the equation
y′′ + 4y = 9 cos2 x
for all x ∈R. To ﬁnd a particular solution we will make use the method of variation
of parameters as given in Proposition 3.3.2. First we calculate the general solution of
the associated homogeneous equation
y′′ + 4y = 0
by the Ansatz y(x) = eλx, λ ∈C. This leads to the condition λ2 + 4 = 0, which has
the two solutions λ1 = 2i, λ2 = −2i. The general homogeneous solution is therefore [see
Proposition 3.2.1 c)]

To ﬁnd a particular solution yp(x) by the method of variation of parameters, we make the
Ansatz
yp(x) = w1(x)φ1(x) + w2(x)φ2(x),
where φ1(x) and φ2(x) are the two linearly independent solutions of the above homoge-
neous equation, i.e.
φ1(x) = cos(2x),
φ2(x) = sin(2x),
whereas w1(x) and w2(x) are given in Proposition 3.3.2 as
w1(x) = −
 9 cos2 x φ2(x)
W[φ1, φ2](x) dx,
w2(x) =

Exercise 3.3.4: 1 t
We ﬁnd the general solution of the equation
y′′ −9y = 40xe3x cos(2x)
for all x ∈R. The general homogeneous solution φH(x) of the corresponding homogeneous
equation
y′′ −9y = 0
is obtained by the Ansatz y(x) = eλx, so that λ2 −9 = 0 and
φH(x) = c1e3x + c2e−3x.
To ﬁnd a particular solution of the given nonhomogeneous equation we make use of the
method of undetermined coeﬃcients and consider the equation in the complex form,
i.e.
y′′
c −9yc = 40xe(3+2i)x,
where yc(x) is a complex function and
y(x) = Re {yc(x)}.
An Ansatz for a complex particular solution ycp(x) of this complex equation is (see Propo-
sition 3.3.4)
ycp(x) = e(3+2i)xwc(x),
where wc(x) is an unknown complex function. Inserting this Ansatz into the above complex
equation, we obtain
w′′
c + 2(3 + 2i)w′
c + (−4 + 12i)wc = 40x.
To ﬁnd a solution for this equation we use the Ansatz
wc(x) = B1x + B0,
Bj ∈C
which leads to
(3 + 2i)B1 + (−2 + 6i)B1x + (−2 + 6i)B0 = 20x.
Equating coeﬃcients of x and 1, we obtain
(−2 + 6i)B1 = 20,
(3 + 2i)B1 + (−2 + 6i)B0 = 0,
so that
B1 = −1 −3i,
B0 = 9

Thus a solution for wc(x) is

Exercise 3.4.1: 1 g
We ﬁnd the general solution of the following second-order Cauchy-Euler equation
x2y′′ −3xy′ −5y = x2 ln x
for all x > 0.
Using Proposition 3.4.1 we introduce a new independent variable z as
x = ez,
y(x) = y(z).
The given equation then becomes
d2y
dz2 −4dy
dz −5y(z) = z e2z.
We now need to ﬁnd the general solution y(z) of this equation. We ﬁrst ﬁnd the general
solution φH(z; c1, c2) of the associated homogeneous equation
d2y
dz2 −4dy
dz −5y(z) = 0.
With the Ansatz
y(z) = eλz,
λ ∈C
we obtain
P2(λ) = λ2 −4λ −5 = (λ + 1)(λ −5) = 0
so λ1 = −1 and λ2 = 5. Thus
φH(z; c1, c2) = c1 e−z + c2 e5z.
To ﬁnd a particular solution yp(z) of
d2y
dz2 −4dy
dz −5y(z) = z e2z.

Equating coeﬃcients of z and 1, we get A1 = −1/9 and A0 = 0. Thus a solution for w(z)
is
w(z) = −1
9 z
and a particular solution is therefore
y(z) = −1
9 ze2z
so that he general solution of the diﬀerential equation, with z as its independent variable,
becomes
y(z) = c1 e−z + c2 e5z −1
9 ze2z.
Substituting now z = ln(x), we obtain the general solution in terms of x, namely
y(x) = c1 x−1 + c2x5 −1
9 x2 ln x
for all x > 0.
Exercise 3.5.1: 1 e
We ﬁnd the general solution of the second-order homogeneous equation
x2y′′ −2xy′ + (4x2 + 2)y = 0
for all x ∈R\{0}, where one solution is given as
φ1(x) = x cos(2x).
Using Proposition 3.5.1 we make the Ansatz y(x) = φ2(x), with
φ2(x) = v(x)φ1(x) = v(x)x cos(2x)
for a second linearly independent solution of the given equation. This leads to the following
condition on v(x):
cos(2x) v′′ −4 sin(2x) v′ = 0.
We let
v′(x) = z(x)
so that the equation becomes a separable ﬁrst-order equation, namely
z′(x) = 4z(x) sin(2x)
cos(2x)
with general solution
|z(x)| = ec1 cos−2(2x).

Integrating this expression again, we ﬁnd
v(x) = ±1

sin(2x)
cos(2x)
so that a second solution of the given equation takes the form
φ2(x) = ±1
2x sin(2x).
Since φ1(x) and φ2(x) are linearly independent solutions, we have obtained the general
solution of the given diﬀerential equation, namely
y(x) = c1x cos(2x) + c2x sin(2x)
for all x ∈R\{0}.
Exercise 4.2.1: 2 f
We solve the following initial-value problem:
y(4) + 9y′′ = 0,
y(0) = 2, y′(0) = 1, y′′(0) = 2, y(3)(0) = 1.
We ﬁrst calculate the general solution by the use of the Ansatz
y(x) = eλx,
λ ∈C.
This leads to the following condition on λ:
P4(λ) = λ4 + 9λ2 = λ2(λ2 + 9) = 0,
which has the four roots
λ1 = λ2 = 0,
λ3 = 3i,
λ4 = −3i.
Now λ1 = 0 and λ2 = 0 gives two real solutions, namely
φ1(x) = 1,
φ2(x) = x
for all x ∈R,
whereas the complex root λ3 = 3i gives two real solutions [see Proposition 4.2.1 b)],
namely
φ3(x) = Re

e3ix
= cos(3x),
φ4(x) = Im

e3ix
= sin(3x)
for all x ∈R.
The general solution of the given equation for all x ∈R is thus
y(x) = c1 + c2x + c3 cos(3x) + c4 sin(3x).
The derivatives of the general solution are as follows:
y′(x) = c2 −3c3 sin(3x) + 3c4 cos(3x)
y′′(x) = −9c3 cos(3x) −9c4 sin(3x)
y(3)(x) = 27c3 sin(3x) −27c4 cos(3x)

and, for the initial conditions in the point x = 0, we obtain

Exercise 4.3.2: 1 p
We ﬁnd the general solution of the following fourth-order linear nonhomogeneous equation:
y(4) + 2y(3) + y′′ = (x + 1)2,
for all x ∈R. To ﬁnd the general solution φH(x c1, c2, c3, c4) of the corresponding homo-
geneous equation
y(4) + 2y(3) + y′′ = 0,
we use the Ansatz y(x) = eλx, which leads to the condition
P4(λ) = λ4 + 2λ3 + λ2 = 0
or
λ2(λ + 1)2 = 0.
The four roots of characteristic polynomial P4(λ) are
λ1 = λ2 = 0,
λ3 = λ4 = −1
so that
φH(x c1, c2, c3, c4) = c1 + c2x + c3e−x + c4xe−x.
To ﬁnd a particular solution yp(x), we make use of the method of undetermined
coeﬃcients and use the Ansatz
yp(x) = x2 
A2x2 + A1x + A0

= A2x4 + A1x3 + A0x2.
as given by Case I (3) in paragraph 4.3.1., due to the fact that the degree of the
polynomial on the right side of the given equation is two and the coeﬃcients of y and y′
are zero. Inserting this Ansatz into the given nonhomogeneous diﬀerential equation, we
obtain
24A2 + 2(24A2x + 6A1) + 12Ax2 + 6A1x + 2A0 = x2 + 2x + 1.
By equating the coeﬃcients x2, x and 1, we obtain
12A2 = 1
48A2 + 6A1 = 2
24A2 + 12A1 + 2A0 = 1
with the unique solution A2 = 1/12, A1 = −1/3 and A0 = 3/2. Thus a particular solution
is
yp(x) = 1
12 x4 −1
3 x3 + 3
2 x2
and by Proposition 4.3.1 the general solution of the given equation takes the form
y(x) = c1 + c2x + c3e−x + c4xe−x + 1
12 x4 −1
3 x3 + 3

Exercise 4.3.2: 1 q
We ﬁnd the general solution of the third-order equation
y(3) + 3y′′ + 3y′ + y = (x + 1)e−x
To ﬁnd the general solution φH(x; c1, c2, c3) of the associated homogeneous equation
y(3) + 3y′′ + 3y′ + y = 0
we use the Ansatz y(x) = eλx, which leads to the condition
P3(λ) = λ3 + 3λ2 + 3λ + 1 = 0
or
(λ + 1)3 = 0.
The four roots of the characteristic polynomial P3(λ) are
λ1 = λ2 = λ3 = −1
so that
φH(x c1, c2, c3, c4) =

c1 + c2x + c3x2
e−x.
To ﬁnd a particular solution yp(x), we make use of the method of undetermined
coeﬃcients and use the Ansatz
yp(x) = e−xw(x),
where w(x) is an unknown function. This Ansatz is given by Case III in paragraph 4.3.1.
For the derivatives, we obtain

Inserting this Ansatz into the given nonhomogeneous diﬀerential equation, we obtain
w(3) = x + 1.
To ﬁnd a solution w(x) of this third-order nonhomogeneous equation we can make use of
the method on undetermined coeﬃcients discussed in Case I in paragraph 4.3.1.
Since the coeﬃcients of w′′, w′ and w are zero, the Ansatz is
w(x) = x3(A1x + A0),
with
w′ = 4A1x3 + 3A0x2
w′′ = 12A1x2 + 6A0x
w(3) = 24A1x + 6A0,

so that
24A1x + 6A0 = x + 1.
Equating coeﬃcients of x and 1, we obtain
24A1 = 1,
6A0 = 1
so that A1 = 1/24 and A0 = 1/6, and a solution for w takes the form
w(x) = 1

Hence a particular solution yp(x) for the given equation is

The general solution is then

Exercise 4.3.4: 1 c
We ﬁnd the general solution of the following third-order nonhomogeneous diﬀerential equa-
tion
y(3) −6y′′ + 11y′ −6y =
e3x
e2x + 1
for all x ∈R. First we calculate the general solution φH(x; c1, c2, c3) of the associated
homogeneous equation
y(3) −6y′′ + 11y′ −6y = 0.
Using the Ansatz y(x) = eλx, λ ∈C, we obtain the condition
P3(λ) = λ3 −6λ2 + 11λ −6 = (λ −1)(λ −2)(λ −3) = 0.
The three roots of the polynomial P3(λ) are
λ1 = 1,
λ2 = 2,
λ3 = 3
which gives three linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous equation, namely
φ1(x) = ex,
φ2(x) = e2x,
φ3(x) = e3x.
The general solution of the homogeneous equation becomes
φH(x; c1, c2, c3) = c1ex + c2e2x + c3e3x
for all x ∈R.
To ﬁnd a particular solution for the given nonhomogeneous equation, we make us of the
method of variation of parameters as described in Proposition 4.3.3. A particular
solution yp(x) is given by
yp(x) = w1(x)φ1(x) + w2(x)φ2(x) + w3(x)φ3(x),
where wj(x) (j = 1, 2, 3) have the following form:
w1(x) =
 W1[(f), φ2, φ3](x)
W[φ1, φ2, φ3](x) dx
w2(x) =

W[φ1, φ2, φ3](x) dx
w3(x) =

x + 4
x2
for all x > 0. Using Proposition 4.4.1 we introduce a new independent variable z as
x = ez,
y(x) = y(z).
This leads to the equation
d4y
dz4 + 6d3y
dz3 + 13d2y
dz2 + 12dy
dz + 4y(z) = 2e−z + 4e−2z.
Solving this equation we obtain the general solution
y(z) = (c1 + c2z)e−2z + (c3 + c4z)e−z + z2e−z + 2z2e−2z
so that the general solution of the given equation becomes
y(x) = (c1 + c2 ln x)x−2 + (c3 + c4 ln x)x−1 + x−1(ln x)2 + 2x−2(ln x)2
