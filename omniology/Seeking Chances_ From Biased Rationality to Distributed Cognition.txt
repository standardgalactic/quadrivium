Preface
In the episode “Homer Deﬁned” from The Simpsons, Homer saves the Spring-
ﬁeld nuclear power plant from meltdown. He saves it by performing a chil-
dren’s nursery rhyme that allows him to guess which button should be pressed
to avert the disaster. Homer immediately becomes a local hero. Indeed, no-
body knows how he managed to prevent the local nuclear power plant from
meltdown. He even receives an “Employee of the Month” award from his
boss. It is only when he saves a second nuclear power plant by using the
same rhyme in front of everybody in Shelbyville that his trick is discovered.
So, now everybody knows that it was not omniscient intelligence that saved
the entire population, but just a blind guess performed by a dumb man like
Homer. The episode ends with Lisa reading the phrase “to pull a Homer” – a
new idiomatic expression now entered in the dictionary, meaning “to succeed
despite idiocy”. This book is about what “to pull a homer” really means to
us. More precisely, it addresses the problem of how we as humans succeed
despite our boundedness.
What the story about Homer tells us is that sometimes we perform well
when we think we do not. This is somehow captured by the apparently con-
tradictory statement that sometimes less is more and more is less. As the ex-
ample of Homer suggests, when we are urged to decide over a certain matter,
even a meaningless rhyme like Eenie, meenie, miney, moe might be success-
ful or, at least, helpful. Why? Because it makes a problem aﬀordable. Like
Homer, we always have a button to press and sometimes we do not know
which the right one is. When facing up to unavoidable decisions, anything is
always better than nothing.
The example of Homer and his rhyme is quite extreme, but it points to
one of the most distinguishing abilities that human beings display, that is the
ability of turning almost everything – even a string of meaningless words –
into a clue to make a problem aﬀordable in relation to what one knows and,
most of all, to what one does not know. That is what characterizes humans
as chance seekers.

Preface
Many centuries ago the Chinese military general and strategist Sun Tzu
wrote in his The Art of War that when we do not have any idea how to make
the required decision, then “everything looks like important information”
and “it becomes impossible to sort the useless from the useful”. This does
not mean that we are completely lost and in the dark. Quite the contrary,
it means that in the absence of premissory starting points,1 ignorance may
turn out to be a chance to be cognitively virtuous. Ignorance should not be
considered simply as absence of knowledge as it might be used as a clue for
making a decision aﬀordable to us. Consider this very simple example. I am
at the airport and I do not know which terminal my ﬂight will take oﬀfrom.
I could ask a ﬂight assistant to help or I can simply go to one of the terminals
and check the timetable to see if my ﬂight appears one of the monitors. If
not, it means that I am at the wrong terminal. In this case, it is by means of
what remains unknown – my ignorance – that I can make a guess.
There are several other ways in which we can make the best of our ig-
norance. For instance, there are some things that we think we know simply
because we are told that they are so. But actually we do not know that they
are so. For example, when taking advice, we simply trust the person who
is giving it to us, whether we are buying a new laptop or selling our stocks
and shares. Sometimes, we think we know something that we do not, simply
because we are told that it is so by a person who we trust. While on other
occasions we may even watch what other people do and follow the crowd.
It is worth noting here that in all the cases I have mentioned – from homer’s
rhyme to taking advice, or not – our ignorance remains preserved somehow.
For instance, if a friend of mine says that the new laptop by Apple or Dell is
worth buying because it has certain features, I could follow his advice, and
yet not know anything about either laptop. The same can be said about the
example of the ﬂight. I still do not know my ﬂight terminal, I just know that,
if that were the case, I would know it.
What all these examples share is that they can be easily dismissed or
debunked. That is, it is easy – from an intellectual perspective – to point to
their weakness. In fact, they are all traditionally considered as fallacies. My
ignorance about my ﬂight terminal and the fact that I trust my friend are
scarcely relevant. In sum, they are easy to deploy but also easy to dismiss.
This is basically the rationale of what I call fallacious or biased rationality.
They are rational insofar as they do not necessarily lead us to a bad outcome,
moreover, they are not dependent on a particular context but, at the same
time, they appear to be quite unreliable.
The main problem of fallacious or biased rationality is that it contrasts
with a human attitude according to which some people are not satisﬁed with
weak arguments or it is just so strategies. They want something better, for
instance, some chances that are well-grounded, more reliable, or at least less

weak than others. On some occasions, human beings are able to deploy ar-
guments or strategies that preserve ignorance, yet mitigate it.
Ignorance might be a clue, but, as Socrates contended more than two thou-
sand years ago, it can also be a stimulus to learn things as we are motivated
to formulate arguments and use strategies that are potentially harder to dis-
miss. My thought is that, when resorting to this kind of “Socratic” ignorance
we need to distinguish between what it is relevant or symptomatic to our
decision and what it is not.
This second attitude points to a diﬀerent form of rationality that takes ad-
vantage of the idea of distributed cognition. Basically, humans improve their
survival strategies by building eco-cognitive structures capable of delivering
potentially ever more symptomatic information. It is through various ma-
nipulations of the environment that we gain new and more reliable chances
which can be used to de-bias our rationality. Indeed, a children’s nursery
rhyme or a trustworthy friend allow us to make decisions aﬀordable, even
when they would not otherwise be so. At the same time however, through
the laborious activity of cognitive niche construction, we come up with situa-
tions in which we are better aﬀorded by our environment, and thus biases or
fallacies cease to be appealing. In this sense, our environment is a source of
selection pressures over human life, but also a storehouse of cognitive chances,
namely, aﬀordances, which are potentially more relevant to our survival and
prosperity.
Manipulation of the environment – a hypothetical activity – unearths aﬀor-
dances that, once stored in our various cognitive niches, can be accumulated
and contribute to de-biasing our rationality. Indeed, this is not a permanent
result. There is no method of securing successful aﬀordances to our genome.
Our cognitive niches – and all the extensions of our rationality – may be
enriched, but they can also perish or collapse. In this sense, our rational-
ity is still bounded. That is, the activity of distributing our cognition does
not lead to a complete de-bounding of human cognitive system. However, it
contributes to move the bounds of cognition.
The Structure of the Book
One of the facts that I take for granted in this book is that human cognition
is bounded. Human cognition is bounded when it falls short of omniscience.
In my view, this simple statement warns us to adopt a cognitive agenda,
which does not seriously take into account what people actually do, before
considering what they should do. And what do people often do? They make
mistakes, lots of mistakes. Mistakes are basically symptoms of what it is going
on within our cognitive system. In the ﬁrst chapter Fallacies and Cognition:
The Rationale of Being Fallacious I will develop this idea presenting the case
of fallacious reasoning as an example of the importance of accounting for

Preface
mistakes. The frequency and ubiquitousness of fallacies – traditionally con-
sidered as patterns of poor reasoning – is symptomatic of the fact that human
cognition has a strong commitment to cognitive economy. When operating in
cognitive economy, what appears to be clearly erroneous may turn out not to
be so. Fallacious rationality has its appeal and investigating what it precisely
consists of is an imperative task. The main thesis I will develop is that the
importance of fallacies is symptomatic in the sense that they are symptoms
of the way cognition works.
In the second chapter Bounded Rationality as Biased Rationality: Virtues,
Vices, and Assumptions I will look carefully into the kind of boundedness we
are limited by. In doing so, I will integrate the issue of fallacious reasoning into
a wider debate concerning biased rationality. In that chapter I will show the
vices and virtues of biased rationality. I will discuss when biases and fallacies
are good, but also when they uncover unreliable or at least “maladaptive”
solutions to our survival and prosperity. Some questions will then be explored
in more detail. What does being cognitively bounded really mean? As Woods
arguably noted, “we survive, we prosper, and from time to time we build great
civilizations”. How could that be possible given our limitations? How could
we possibly account for the amazingly successful outcomes humans sometimes
bring about?
Our commitment to cognitive economy does not imply that the cogni-
tive assets humans have cannot be improved and extended beyond previous
limitations. This is basically the idea that while we cannot get rid of our
boundedness it is not to say that we cannot reach something better. For the
problem is not that of the bounds (that we do have) but that of their insta-
bility. Bounds are not ﬁxed once and for all but are in constant movement.
For example, they move (a) in relation to representations of the problem and
of alternatives, (b) in respect to resources they use (paper, pencil, computer,
ﬁgures, tables, books, reports, etc.), (c) because of the creative activity of
our brain (here heuristics operate, for example), (d) as emotional states in-
tervene, (e) together with moral values, and so on. To view the bounds of
human cognition as moving is made possible by the assumption that our
cognitive system is distributed. This will be discussed in the third chapter
Moving the Bounds. Distributing Cognition through Cognitive Niche Con-
struction. The main thesis that will be illustrated here is that human beings
do not actually hold a complete representation of their environment. Con-
versely, they use the environment itself as a representation by manipulating
and even creating it so as to ﬁnd room for new cognitive chances which were
not immediately available. This idea of human cognition as a chance-seeking
system will be developed within an evolutionary framework based on the
notion of cognitive niche construction. According to this theory, the high
level of plasticity exhibited by humans is explained by the fact that humans

are powerful eco-cognitive engineers. The accumulation and, most of all, the
persistence of modiﬁcations on the environment is what grants humans an
additional source of information, not delivered through genetic material, that
is in fact fundamental for behavior control.
It appears to be a circular argument to claim humans turn environmen-
tal constraints into ecological chances when facing the challenges posed by
the environment itself. That is not the case, as we assume that organisms
(including humans) adapt to their environment, and vice-versa. This will be
illustrated in the fourth chapter Building Cognitive Niches: The Role of Af-
fordances. What I will argue is that human cognitive behavior consists in
acting upon those anchors to which we have secured a cognitive function, via
cognitive niche construction. Those anchors are basically aﬀordances. Aﬀor-
dances are a way of measuring or representing the environment with respect
to the action capabilities of an individual. Here, again, humans do not hold
a complete internal representation of the environment but they use the envi-
ronment itself as a model insofar as they can immediately access it in terms
of those action capabilities, which emerge in the interplay between humans
and their environment. The notion of abduction will contribute to making
our point bolder. Going beyond a sentential and computational dimension of
abduction towards including it in a broader semiotic one, I will argue that
aﬀordances can be related to the variable (degree of) abductivity of a con-
ﬁguration of signs. This will be of help when illustrating the evolutionary
dimension of aﬀordance detection and creation. I will argue that humans
have at their disposal a standard or pre-wired endowment of aﬀordances, but
at the same time they can extend and modify the range of what can oﬀer
them aﬀordance through the development of appropriate cognitive abductive
skills.
As already argued, what is crucial for making plasticity work is to turn en-
vironmental constraints into ecological chances. This transformative activity
is at the core of our proposal, which is to view human cognition as a chance-
seeking system. We build and manipulate cognitive niches so as to unearth
additional resources for behavior control. This activity of eco-cognitive engi-
neering is basically what best describes our idea of learning as an ecological
task. In the ﬁfth chapter The Notion of Docility: The Social Dimension of
Distributing Cognition I will present the notion of docility. First introduced
by Herbert Simon, I develop the original notion arguing that docility is that
kind of disposition underlying those activities of ecological learning. As most
of the resources we beneﬁt from are stored externally, docility is supposed
to facilitate the delegation and exploitation of cognitive chances secured to
cognitive niches. From an evolutionary perspective, docility is an adaptive
response to the increasing cognitive demand on those information-gaining
ontogenetic processes like learning, resulting from an intensive activity of cog-
nitive niche construction. In this sense, docility makes people more inclined
to overcome their ignorance by means of learning. It facilitates information
sharing and accumulation.

Preface
The last chapter Seeking Chances. The Moral Side is a sort of appendix. It
is an attempt to integrate morality into the distributed framework presented
in the previous chapters. This is not an attempt to articulate a complete moral
theory on the basis of our proposal. Rather, it is meant to oﬀer its practical
application to moral reasoning. What I will discuss is that the mechanism
underlying chance-seeking activities may capture some important features
of moral reasoning. Basically, I will present the thesis, ﬁrst introduced by
Lorenzo Magnani, according to which morality is a distributed phenomenon.
Morality is distributed in the sense that even our moral agency is contin-
uously shaped and reshaped by the activity of niche construction. Various
technological artifacts, but also institutions and language itself, extend our
capacity to discern moral values and cope with situations which would re-
quire a moral commitment. I am far from developing a uniﬁed approach which
would combine cognition and morality, but we believe that this would be a
valuable starting point.
I started to think about the research covered in this book while studying
as a PhD student in Philosophy at the University of Pavia, Italy. Preparation
of this work would not have been possible without the resources and facilities
of the Computational Philosophy Laboratory (Department of Philosophy,
University of Pavia, Italy). This project was conceived as a whole, but as it
developed various parts became articles, which have now been revised and
integrated into the current text. I am grateful to Springer for permission
to include portions of previously published articles. Parts of Chapter 1 were
previously included in: E. Bardone and L. Magnani, “The Appeal of Gossiping
Fallacies and its Eco-logical Roots” in Pragmatics and Cognition, 18(2), 2010.
For valuable comments and discussion of a previous draft I am particu-
larly grateful, ﬁrst of all, to Lorenzo Magnani (University of Pavia, Italy)
who has been an ideal supervisor over the years I have spent as one of his
PhD students. He is a great mind, a great human being: it will be very hard
to repay his kindness. A very special thanks goes out to Ester V˜osu (Uni-
versity of Tartu, Estonia) who has really extended my cognition during the
last stages of preparation of this volume. My work has beneﬁted from dis-
cussions with several people over the last four years. Chieﬂy, Davide Secchi
(University of Wisconsin, La Crosse, US), Tommaso Bertolotti (Universty of
Pavia, Italy), and Bernardo Pino Rojas (University of Santiago, Chile) who
all deserve a special mention for having challenged my thoughts and ideas,
which otherwise might have become a graveyard of circular arguments. My
thanks and appreciation goes also to all those students who have taken my
course in Cognitive Philosophy at the University of Pavia and road-tested the
ideas in this book. I would thank Claudio Pizzi (University of Siena, Italy)
and Liliana Albertazzi (University of Trento, Italy) for providing me with
valuable comments and remarks on a previous draft of the book. Finally, a
special thanks to and Kai Pata (Tallin University, Estonia), Roberto Feltrero
(UNED, Madrid, Spain), Merja Bauters (University of Helsinki, Finland),
Kristian Bankov (University of Soﬁa, Bulgaria).

Chapter 1
Fallacies and Cognition: The Rationale of Being
Fallacious
Introduction
The opening chapter aims to set the scene, presenting some of the main issues to be
discussed in the following chapters. Basically, this chapter is about human beings
as error-prone creatures. It is a matter of fact that people make mistakes, many
mistakes. No matter how trivial this consideration may appear, most researchers
fail to show sufﬁcient interest in people’s mistakes.1 In decision-making theory, for
instance, mistakes are considered as merely accidental. That is, researchers do not
incorporate this kind of error into their accounts or theories. Indeed, we build up
theories to avoid faults. But sometimes the fact we make mistakes and the way we
make them, may be symptomatic of the mechanism that lies behind decision-making
or problem-solving activities.
Indeed, the term “error” is very broad in its semantics, since it encompasses for
instance, perceptual errors, mechanical errors, faulty memories and factual misin-
formation. In this chapter, I shall consider a narrower class of errors traditionally
called fallacies. Logic has always been committed to helping people make sound
judgments, and fallacy appears to be a failure with respect to this target. Also, if
fallacies may warn us when logic fails to meet cognition, as far as I am concerned
here, this failure turns out to be symptomatic of the way human cognition manages
various resources (logic included) to make decisions and solve problems.
The thesis I will start off with is that a fallacy is a form of reasoning that for
some applications is bad and for others is good; roughly speaking, it is bad for
logic but, for instance, good for surviving. So, in the ﬁrst part of this chapter, I will
1 An important exception to this is constituted by the work pioneered by Tversky and Kah-
neman [1983; 2003] on the psychology of judgment, reasoning and decision making. They
explicitly focused on the extensive use by humans of heuristics and short-cuts, and how
their judgment is drastically inﬂuenced by biases, leading them to deal with decision mak-
ing under uncertainty. Bias research has been become inﬂuent especially in the study of
probabilistic and deductive reasoning. For a recent review on the matter see Evans [2002].
On the relationship between fallacious arguments and the work of Tversky and Kahneman,
see for instance Hintikka [2004].

discuss some of the limits of traditional logic in approaching the problem of fallacy.
In doing so I will take advantage of the theoretical framework developed by Gabbay
and Woods in their recent publications.
In the section 1.2, I will discuss speciﬁc classes of fallacies, namely, the argu-
mentum ad hominem, the argumentum ad verecundiam, and the argumentum ad
populum. I will argue that they share a common taste for gossip. That is, I will
maintain that these fallacies prove extremely successful because they make use of
beliefs and/or knowledge about other people.
1.1
The Appeal of Being-Fallacious
From the perspective of classical logic, a fallacy is a pattern of poor reasoning which
appears to be a pattern of good reasoning [Hansen, 2002]. Two disciplines are in-
volved in fallacious reasoning: formal logic, which is mainly addressed to ‘formal
fallacies”, and informal logic, that describes the so-called ‘informal fallacies”. First
of all, we can say that the validity of a deductive argument depends on its form;
consequently, formal fallacies are arguments which have an invalid form and are
not truth preserving (for example the fallacies of afﬁrming the consequent and of
denying the antecedent). On the other hand, informal fallacies can be other modes
of reasoning whose failure is not strictly based on the type of argument (for exam-
ple the “ad hominem argument” or the “hasty generalization”). Even if there is no
agreement upon an established taxonomy, the fallacies discussed in the context of
informal logic typically still include formal fallacies (which are of course also dis-
cussed in formal logic) such as the famous fallacy of afﬁrming the consequent and
the fallacy of denying the antecedent, but also the proper informal fallacies such
as “ad hominem” (against the person), “slippery slope”, “ad baculum” (appeal to
force), “ad misericordiam” (appeal to pity), and “two wrongs make a right”.
Even if the conception of good inference is usually able to model many kinds
of real human argumentation, its appeal to true premises is ill suited to many
contexts which are characterized by the presence of hypothetical and uncertain
beliefs, by strong disagreement about what is true and false, by ethical and aesthetic
claims which are not easily categorized as true or false and, ﬁnally, by variable
contexts in which dramatically different assumptions may be accepted and rejected
[Magnani, 2009].
Let me consider the case of the so-called “hasty generalization”.2 As I will
demonstrate a hasty generalization is an example of fallacy; a fallacy that can how-
ever lead the cognitive agent – in spite of its fallacious character – to fruitful out-
comes, thus not seeming to be a fallacy at all. As Woods put it “hasty generalization
is sometimes a prudent strategy especially when the risks are high, even though the
haste of the generalization might attract a charge of fallaciousness” [Woods, 2004,
p. 13].
2 For a detailed treatment of hasty generalization, see for instance Walton [1999b].

Fallacies
Deductive invalid argument
Invalid arguments
Hasty generalization occurs when a person (but there is evidence of it in animal
cognition too, for example in mice) infers a conclusion about a group of cases based
on a sample that is not large enough. It has the following form:
-
Sample S, which is small, is taken from the group of persons P.
-
Conclusion C is drawn about the group P based on S.
It could take also the form of:
-
The person X performs the action A and has a result B.
-
Therefore all the actions A will have a result B.
The fallacy is committed when not enough A’s are observed to warrant the conclu-
sion. If enough A’s are observed then the reasoning is not fallacious, at least from
the informal point of view. Males, when driving their cars, have probably quarreled
with a woman driving her car and, while quarreling, they have argued (or shouted)
“all woman are bad drivers!”. This is our case of fallacious reasoning.
Thus small samples are likely to be unrepresentative. Another simple case is the
following. If we ask one person that recently met a lot of Italians what he thinks
about the new Italian electoral system, his answer clearly would not be based on an
adequately sized sample to determine what Italians in general think about the issue.
This is because the answer given is based only on a reduced number of experiences
and such judgment is not sufﬁcient to provide a generalization about the matter in
question. It is not good to generalize from only one available sample.
People often commit hasty generalizations because of bias or prejudice. For ex-
ample, someone who is a sexist might conclude that all women are unﬁt to ﬂy jet
ﬁghters (or to drive a car) just because one woman crashed, in either case. People
also commonly commit hasty generalizations because of laziness or sloppiness. It
is very easy to simply jump to a conclusion and much harder to gather an adequate
sample and draw a justiﬁed conclusion. Thus, avoiding this fallacy requires min-
imizing the inﬂuence of bias and taking care to select a sample that is both large
enough and meaningful.
Moreover, I can recognize another important occurrences. I have said that people
commit errors and are hasty generalizers because of prejudice, mindlessness, bias,
and so on. What I am trying to argue is that a hasty generalization is not always a bad
generalization for two reasons. The ﬁrst is that, for obtaining true conclusions, hasty
generalizations might be good if the result of the generalization we made coincides
with the result of a good generalization in the philosophical sense of induction,
or in the sense of inductive logics. We call this case the “causal” truth-preserving

feature of hasty generalization, meaning that the truth stated in the conclusion can be
preserved, even though that is not a permanent feature of a hasty generalization. The
second reason is that, in some sense, even if we do not reach good conclusions, not
exploiting the casual truth preserving feature, we can say that hasty generalization
is good in some sense although obviously not in that of classical logic. I will now
try to understand what it can be achieved [Woods, 2004].
From an intuitive perspective, Woods [2009] offered a clear-cut view on fallacy
describing it with respect to four main features:
1. A fallacy is a pattern of poor reasoning. That means it is erroneous. It leads us to
a conclusion by means of poor reasoning.
2. A fallacy is a pattern of poor reasoning that, however, looks good. That is, it
is attractive and seductive, since it can be easily smuggled as a good argument
sometimes.
3. A fallacy is also universal in its occurrence. That is, everybody is got used to
commit fallacies, no matter where she lives or what culture she belongs to.
4. A fallacy is incorrigible in the sense that people display high level of post-
diagnostic recidivism; committing fallacies is a incorrigible disposition or
mind-set.
Erroneous, attractive, universal, and incorrigible are all adjectives that clearly de-
pict an intuitive notion of fallacy, labeled by its proponents with the acronym EAUI.
1.1.1
The Agent-Based Perspective
The idea Gabbay and Woods [2005] have put forward is that logic should look
at what is done by a cognitive agent. That is, it should pay more attention to the
cognitive agent’s concrete ways of reasoning. The fact that humans are quite prone
to committing fallacies cannot be disregarded, if the aspiration of logic is that of
being an aid to human cognition. This kind of approach is what Gabbay and Woods
[2001] labeled as agent-based logic.
Agent-based logic consists in describing and analyzing the reasoning occurring
in problem solving situations by looking to what a practical agent actually does, and
not what she/he should do or is supposed to do. We arrive to what has been called
the “Actually Happens Rule” [Woods, 2005, p. 734] that states “to see what agents
should do we should have to look ﬁrst to what they actually do and then, if there
is particular reason to do so, we would have to repair the account”. This particular
approach assumes that the description of reasoners comes before the description of
reasoning. In doing so, we indeed introduce an element of psychologism in logic
[Woods, 2009]. Now the question is: what is “beings-like-us” meant to be? The
agent-based perspective on logic aims at giving a principled description of certain
aspects of a cognitive system, which is depicted as a triple of 1) an agent C, 2)
cognitive resources R, and 3) a cognitive target J. Having this in mind, practical
agents seek to attain the targets they set with the resources they can reasonably
get and/or have at hand. Therefore, practical agents operate in cognitive economies

[Woods, 2009], where the agent access to cognitive resources encounters limitations
such as:
•bounded information
•lack of time
•limited computational capacity.
Hence, the “beings-like-us” that Woods [2005] describes in his “Epistemic bub-
bles” discharge their cognitive agendas under press of incomplete information, lack
of time, and limited computational capacity. We can consequently say that cog-
nitive performances depend on information, time, and computational capacity. An
agent-based logic, as a discipline that furnishes ideal descriptions of agent-based
reasoning, returns to be thought of as a science of reasoning and considered agent-
centered, task-oriented, and resource-bound.
1.1.2
Proportionality and Relativity of Errors
As already mentioned, fallacies are bad from certain perspectives but good from
others. In this sense, an argument turns out to be erroneous in relation to a standard
or a set of standards it fails to meet. For instance, induction might be good if the
result of the generalization we made coincides with the result of a good general-
ization in the philosophical – for example Millian – sense of induction (or in the
sense of inductive logics). In this case Millian methods for induction is the standard
set for describing good arguments [Magnani, 2009]. Now, think of a toddler that
touches a stove in the kitchen for the ﬁrst time [Woods, 2004]. His ﬁnger is now
burned because the stove is hot. From this evidence, the hastily generalizing toddler
thinks that all stoves are hot and decides not to touch stoves anymore. In this case,
the toddler’s pattern of reasoning, namely, a hasty generalization, is extremely poor,
if we adopt the Millian methods for induction as our standard. However, if we adopt
a much less cognitively pretentious standard (for instance, the one related to “do
not burn your hand”), his hasty generalization does not appear fallacious, but it is a
good example of pragmatic reasoning.
It is noteworthy that the setting of a standard depends on, and is proportionate
to, the target (or interests) and the resources (information, computational capabil-
ities, etc.) the practical agent has at his disposal. This last consideration depicts a
conception of fallacy which pays more attention to the relativity of error and its pro-
portionality to the resources available at a given time. That is, committing a mistake
is much closer to the selection of cognitive protocols that exceed an agent’s compe-
tence than the mere violation of a given standard which is impossible to meet just
like in the case of the toddler’s hasty generalization. As Woods [2009] put it, “some-
thing is an error of reasoning only in relation to the reasoner’s cognitive targets and
the attainment-standards that they embed”.
In order to better clarify this point, the distinction between the individual agent
and the institutional agent is useful. As Woods put it [2009]:

6
1 Fallacies and Cognition: The Rationale of Being Fallacious
[. . . ] hasty generalization is not a fallacy when committed by human individuals, but
it might well be a fallacy when committed by institutional agents such as Nato, NASA
or MI5, or cultural agents such as Soviet physics in the 1960s or Silicon Valley in the
1980s. This turns out to be a vital distinction for our case, for it is a distinction driven
by the fact that agency types – whether individual, institutional or cultural – are largely
deﬁned by the cognitive assets on which they are able to draw in the discharge of their
reasoning tasks.
The toddler is, indeed, an individual agent. Conversely however, if we think of sci-
ence, for instance, it is an institutional agent. According to what has already been
pointed out, the hasty generalization made by a toddler after touching a burning
stove is not an error; given the task of not being burnt for a second time, the hasty
generalization is a kind of reasoning that is fruitful because, being a prudent strategy,
it embeds the canons of strategic rationality in the sense of the “strife for survival”.
But what if science as a cultural institution made the same inference? That would
be a terrible mistake, indeed.
Compared with the toddler, science as an institution can exploit many more re-
sources; in addition, the targets set by science embed much higher standards than
the toddler’s. To science, it is not sufﬁcient to state that “every time the toddler
touches the stove, it will burn”. Science works another way: it has to analyze in
detail the causal chain that explains the conditions under which the toddler’s hand
will be burnt by the stove, for example. The apparatus science employs far exceeds
that exhibited by the toddler, whose “scientiﬁc apparatus” is limited to his hands or,
at least, to his ten ﬁngers (that means he would have a maximum of ten tries). For
example, a simple temperature sensor used by scientists in a laboratory gets better
feedback than the toddler can get. Science can also measure the interval of time af-
ter which the stove gets cold, and therefore can be touched safely and without any
harm.3
The idea I will develop in the following is that the cognitive appeal of fallacious
arguments is rooted in human evolution belonging to what Woods [2004, p. 8] called
the rational survival kit. This rational survival kit can be considered as the result
of evolution, in which basic equipment, genetically and culturally endowed with
certain abilities, has been selected and learnt for survival and reproduction. That is,
fallacy appears to be a kind of error which is committed “when the agent’s cognitive
devices are functioning as they should” [Woods, 2009]. Therefore, the importance
of the fallacies is symptomatic in the sense that they are symptoms of that rational
survival kit, which has been forged and shaped by evolution, and of course by its
3 It is worth to note that this kind of reasoning is here ideally depicted and reconstructed
as a case of hasty generalization, in the framework of a sentential inferential framework.
An objection could be provided by the psychologically realistic observation that an actual
child does not really perform a propositional inference as become averse to hot stoves, but
instead he is basically directed by some emotional abductive reactions. However, this does
not impede us to choose the other perspective of “reconstructing” in a non psychologically
way but in an inferential/propositional scheme the hypothetical inference performed, so
revealing its fallacious character. For a complete treatment on the matter, see Magnani
[2009].

limits. The fallacious nature of fallacies can also be termed derivative [Woods, 2004,
p. 9], since fallacies do not derive their fallacious nature from themselves, but from
the human survival kit.4
Now, if fallacies are symptomatic of our survival kit, the question arises, what
are those skills that make this kit appealing? What do fallacies tell us about those
skills? These questions concern a wider scope of issues than the one I wish to deal
with here. My aim is more modest. What I want to do is to consider a narrower num-
ber of fallacies which are symptomatic of ways of reasoning that are prominently
social. This will allow us to introduce the eco-cognitive dimension involved in falla-
cious reasoning which, in my view, is what makes them appealing. In the following
section, I provide a description of three fallacies that we think can be useful for this
purpose.
1.2
How to Make Use of Social Characters
It is hard to arrive at a deﬁnite and complete list of typical fallacies, therefore I
conventionally assume the list provided by Woods [2004]. Woods listed eighteen
items – the so-called Gang of Eighteen. More precisely, I refer to three main types
of fallacies:5 argumentum ad hominem (or argument against person), argumentum
ad verecundiam (or appeal to authority), argumentum ad populum (or appeal to
popularity or bandwagon). All these three fallacies are traditionally considered as
examples of a broader category called ignoratio elenchi.6 The three fallacies employ
a general pattern of reasoning based on the introduction of some irrelevance that
does not deal with the matter in discussion.
1.2.1
Argumentum ad Verecundiam
The so-called argumentum ad verecundiam is based on the appeal to an authority
acknowledged as such in order to support or boost a certain position rather than
another. Consider the following example. Andrew Keen [2007] wrote a book, The
Cult of Amateur, in which he violently attacks the culture that the Internet and the
Web are nurturing. He argues that new technologies, such as blogs, social network-
ing sites like MySpace, self-broadcasting tools like YouTube, etc., are glorifying
4 As it will be clearer in Chapter 3 the evolution of this particular survival kit is better
described as resulting from the co-evolution of biological and cultural systems. In fact, the
term evolution is used here in a loosely sense, as the evolution of the survival kit we are
talking about cannot be entirely represented as a Darwinian system.
5 What I am going to present here is not meant to be a complete treatment of these three
arguments. Rather, it is just a brief sketch, which will be of that importance in order to
make my point concerning the relationship between some fallacious arguments and gossip.
For a more exhaustive description of the argumentum ad verecundiam, see Walton [1997]
and Goodwin [1998]; of the argumentum ad hominem, see for instance Walton [19998]
Metcalf [2005]; of the argumentum ad populum, see for instance Walton [1980].
6 For a detailed account of the role of irrelevance in argumentation, see Walton [2004].

and celebrating the so-called cult of the amateur: that is, through breaking up all
the traditional intermediate layers between the editor and the users, these new tech-
nologies are encouraging everybody to become a source of information and enter-
tainment about a certain issue or topic, no matter if he is an expert on the ﬁeld he is
writing about, or not. Conversely, he claims a well informed public should not rely
on amateurs, but talented intermediaries, like professional editors and journalists,
for example. In putting forward his thesis against amateurism, he made an example,
which concerns an eighty-minute movie called Loose Change on 9/11 conspiracy
theories which sprang up on the Net some years ago:
The “claims” made by Loose Change were completely discredited in the ﬁnal report
of the 9/11 Commission, a report that took two years to compile, cost $15 million, and
was written by two governors, four congressmen, three former White House ofﬁcials,
and the two special counsels. [Keen, 2007, p. 69]
In this case, the claim made by Keen is a fallacy based on the appeal to experts.
It is fallacious because he does not reject the theory presented in the movie Loose
Change by referring to evidence and incoherencies; conversely, he simply posits that
the conspiracy theory presented in the movie is false, because the 9/11 Commission
has reported quite the contrary. To boost this position, he simply lists some details
related to the report, for example, the cost of the commission, its composition and
duration. Of course, all these details are irrelevant to assess what really happened
that day. Generally speaking, the argumentum ad verecundiam follows a general
pattern of reasoning that can be described as follows:
-
A given person P thinks b is true;
-
P is supposed to be an expert on the area which b belong to;
-
Then, we have a good reason to think b is true
Under conditions of limited information and computational capabilities, all the ir-
relevant details cited by Keen about the 9/11 Commission may contribute to better
direct our opinion. That is, he is assuming that a commission report is a reliable and
ofﬁcial source of information, which should be more trusted than any other source.
More generally, the fact that people lean on persons who are publicly acknowl-
edged and esteemed as experts in their respective ﬁelds is fundamental to facilitate
a wide range of activity. Consider, for example, learning: learning is a process that
would not be possible without a certain relation between the instructor and the dis-
ciple. Since we cannot know everything and acquire all the information required to
make a sound judgment, we usually take comments or suggestions that come from
people we esteem seriously; and that is the appeal to experts.
In science the argumentum ad verecundiam is also often deployed. Consider,
for instance, the so-called “Matthew effect”, named after the Gospel of Matthew:
humans tend “to give credit to already famous people”. This particular effect has
been empirically tested, since Robert Merton [1965; 1996] popularized it. Of par-
ticular interest is a well-known study conducted by Lewontin and Hubby [1985]

1.2 How to Make Use of Social Characters
9
in which they reported a curious case of ad verecundiam in science.7 Lewontin and
Hubby analyzed the citations they got back from two papers they co-authored. The
two papers were both on the same matter, with the order of authors alternated, and
both qualiﬁed as “citation classics”. What they reported is that the most cited be-
tween the two papers was the one in which the ﬁrst author was Lewontin, who was
also the most well known in the scientiﬁc community at that moment.
It is worth noting that the argumentum ad verecundiam concerns other people, but
also inanimate objects like those we use in everyday life. For instance, we usually
take for granted the ﬁrst results we get back from a web search using tools like
“Google” or “Yahoo!”. When visiting a new place we make use of external aids like
a route planner, GPS, maps, and/or directions. Sometimes, we prefer to follow the
signs and directions we encounter on the road rather than relying on our memory
that can be faulty.
1.2.2
Argumentum ad Hominem
Consider another fallacy called argumentum ad hominem, in plain English, argu-
ment against a person. Here is an example. Some months ago, Britain’s Channel 4
aired a documentary on global warming entitled The Great Global Warming Swin-
dle. The content of the documentary immediately raised a number of doubts about
its scientiﬁc reliability. Opposing the thesis put forward in the documentary, Bill
Butler made a detailed investigation about the experts, who were interviewed in the
movie and who posited that global warming is a fraud based on bad science. This is
what he wrote:
The pseudo-documentary implies that the other people who appeared are knowledge-
able experts in their ﬁelds. In practice, their best expertise seems to be wrangling
payments from large energy companies – especially anti-environmental organizations.
Then, he went on listing the curricula vitae of those “alleged” experts, who appeared
in the movie. He wrote:
[. . . ] Despite the caption on the programme, Singer has retired from the University
of Virginia and has not had a single article accepted for any peer-reviewed scientiﬁc
journal for 20 years. His main work has been as a hired gun for business interests to
undermine scientiﬁc research on environmental and health matters [. . . ].8
Indeed, this kind of argumentation is fallacious, since it introduces some irrelevant
information in discussing the issue of global warming. Whether or not an expert is
on the payroll of an energy company cannot constitute a probative basis of evidence
for arguing in favor of or against global warming [Walton, 2004]. As a matter of
fact, other proof does not matter here, for instance, the CO2 concentration in the
atmosphere, the solar activity, the historical global temperature data, and so on.

1 Fallacies and Cognition: The Rationale of Being Fallacious
Depicting a person putting forward a certain view as a pseudo-scientist or, even
worse, as a fraudulent person does not prove him wrong. Generally speaking, the
argumentum ad hominem follows this general pattern:
-
A given person P holds belief b;
-
unfavorable information about P is presented;
-
Then, b is not acceptable.
However, although a personal attack proves nothing about the matter in discussion,
from the perspective of a practical agent the introduction of irrelevant information
may turn out to be a valuable resource. The argumentum ad verecundiam bases
its appeal on the release of good information about the person we are listening to,
whereas the argumentum ad hominem serves the opposite purpose: to unearth that
information from which we can infer that the person is not trustworthy. In the ex-
ample I cited above, it is clear that a person, who is on the payroll of an energy
company, may be more inclined to deny the negative consequences on the environ-
ment brought about by the kind of companies he actually works for. Of course, this
is a prudent strategy that is selected under conditions of limited information. Since
we cannot go over all the details of global warming theory, we have to depend on
the say-so of others; therefore, we are more inclined to support the position held by
those who are – or appear to be – more trustworthy.
1.2.3
Argumentum ad Populum
People tend to believe what the majority believe. When they appeal to this belief,
they are using an argumentum ad populum. Consider the following case. Over recent
years, climate change has attracted a great deal of attention from various political
organizations. The relation between scientists and policy-makers has become more
and more salient, given the threat that global warming is supposed to hold for the
entire human race. Now suppose that a person would claim:
There are no scientiﬁc publications denying global warming. Therefore, I think global
warming is really happening and we should act to prevent future damages.
This is an example of the argumentum ad populum. This fallacy is based on the
appeal to what the majority of people say: in this case, the argument is merely based
on the appeal to the consensus among scientists. Roughly speaking, what the per-
son posits is that global warming is likely to be true and deserves public concern,
since the entire scientiﬁc community agrees that our planet is getting ever warmer.
This argument can be resumed as follows:
-
The majority of people M think b is true;
-
then, we have a good reason to think b is true.
This kind of argument is fallacious for two main reasons. First of all, even scientists
might go wrong, because science as a human enterprise is fallible. Secondly, the fact
that the entire scientiﬁc community agreed upon a given theory is a statement that

1.2 How to Make Use of Social Characters
11
has nothing to do with global warming; is consensus something capable of inducing
climate variations the way CO2 emissions or solar activity do? Not at all: there is no
causal chain between the scientiﬁc consensus and the rise of CO2 concentration in
the atmosphere, for example. From a scientiﬁc point of view, it is simply irrelevant.
However, it is noteworthy that the appeal to the consensus among scientists is
still attractive and seductive. For instance, it is assumed that scientists follow the
scientiﬁc method, which has been proven over more than ﬁve centuries to be one
of the most reliable institutions for producing and transmitting knowledge. Science
is still fallible and scientists might be wrong, but the consensus reached among
scientists is certainly more trustworthy than the one reached in a pub or even in
parliament, in which private interests can easily enter the scene. Science exhibits
a wide range of public procedures that should lessen the negative impact of non
scientiﬁc concerns; the articles published in the best ranked international scientiﬁc
journals are peer reviewed, experiment results cannot be kept secret, but must be
released publicly, etc.
The issue of trustworthiness is therefore crucial for beings-like-us, who can-
not look into all the scientiﬁc reports or results that are monthly or even
daily published in specialized journals or magazines. In the case of the argu-
mentum ad verecundiam, the appeal to experts is the source of our tendency
to trust the say-so of others; in the the case of the argument ad hominem,
what counts is unfavorable information about the person who actually holds
that view; ﬁnally, in the case of the argumentum ad populum, we are nat-
urally inclined to trust what the majority of people thinks, because we are
ultra-social creatures [Richerson and Boyd, 1998; Richerson and Boyd, 2005]. That
is, human cognition has been biased towards social problem-solving through-
out all evolution [Sperber and Mercier, 2010; Mesoudi et al., 2006; Adolphs, 2006;
Humphrey, 1976; Whiten and Byrne, 1997].
1.2.4
The Question of Irrelevancy and Fallacy Evaluation
As examples of red herring, all the fallacies I brieﬂy surveyed introduce irrelevant
information about a certain issue of debate. Although they do not provide conclu-
sive evidence to support or reject a certain claim the way scientiﬁc statements do,
they tell us something interesting about how humans build up their arguments and
reasons: people committing these fallacies rely on information about other human
beings in their reasoning. That is, they do not follow certain logical procedures that
eventually lead them to correct conclusions. But they simply make use of others as
social characters. For example, being an authority, being an expert, being part of
a class, etc., becomes the substitute for more direct evidence to support a certain
claim or make an argument more appealing. Although all these arguments remain
fallacious in their nature, they are somehow good. Indeed, they are not good from
a logical perspective, because they are bad arguments, but they can be successful
from the agent-based perspective we illustrated in section 1.1.1. That is, they may
provide good solutions given the various constraints (bounded information, lack of
time, limited computational capacities) humans are subjected to.

12
1 Fallacies and Cognition: The Rationale of Being Fallacious
Interestingly, Tindale [2007] argued that the evaluation process of a red herring is
an important step towards its identiﬁcation, because upon occasion the arguer does
not usually jump to another issue bearing no relation to the one at stake. As already
noted, people are used to introducing irrelevant information with respect to the is-
sue under discussion. But when may we say that information introduced is relevant?
This seems to suggest that the fallacious nature of a red herring rests on the possi-
bility of proving that a real shift in issue has occurred. It is noteworthy that in any
communicative context people continuously strive to be relevant [Dessalles, 2000;
Tindale, 2007; Grice, 1975]. In all the “ad arguments” we have brieﬂy illustrated
the shift in an argument is symptomatic of the ability to make use of various re-
sources people may have at their disposal. That is, introducing some irrelevancies
is not only a fraudulent attempt to divert audience attention, but also the attempt to
look for new and potentially relevant connections.
The fact that an argument makes use of irrelevant information is commonly con-
sidered as fallacious. However, this statement may turn out to be problematic, as it
is not always obvious when and why a piece of information is irrelevant and what
makes it as such. Magnani [2009, p. 411-414] argues that both argument evaluation
and argument selection are often the fruits of an abductive appraisal; that is, striving
to be relevant is guided by abductive skills, which both the arguer and audience em-
ploy to select convincing arguments on the one hand, and to evaluate the competitive
narratives at stake, on the other.
Abduction is deﬁned by Magnani [2001] as the process in which a hypothesis
is created/selected and then evaluated.9 As far as I am concerned, the notion of ab-
duction may shed light on the mechanism behind argument evaluation and selection,
and thus develop the approach put forward by Tindale [2007]. The abductive dimen-
sion of argument evaluation can be described as follows. As regards the arguer, he
aims to put forward that argument, with which he might best convince his audience
that he is right. Here, the abductive skills involved are those required to make the
proper guess regarding those clues or the information that his audience will make
use of.
For instance, if one is delivering a speech on the relationship between science
and religion to a group of Catholic students, one might guess that an appeal to the
Pope as an authority would be more likely accepted than an appeal to an atheist. In
contrast, an appeal to the philosopher of science Paul Thagard would be more likely
to be accepted than any other when discussing the explanatory dimension of scien-
tiﬁc reasoning, given that Thagard is a well-known expert in that ﬁeld. Generally
speaking, sophisticated abductive skills can lead the arguer to generate or select the
most convincing argument with respect to the nature of the given audience.
As for the audience, the abductive skills are those employed to evaluate whether
a certain argument is coherent. Let me return to the example of Paul Thagard. Sup-
pose that the audience attending the discussion consists of mainly PhD students,
interested in philosophy of science, and suppose that the topic for discussion is the
role of explanation in science: in such a case, it is likely that the students would

1.3 Gossip, Reasoning, and Knowledge

evaluate the appeal to Paul Thagard as a good argumentative move. They know, for
example, that Thagard has done much of his research precisely on the role of ex-
planation in scientiﬁc reasoning, he has published widely on the topic, he has been
frequently quoted and he has always been presented as a serious and smart scholar.
Abduction – considered as the process of hypothesis generation and evaluation
– plays an important role in the evaluation of arguments (whether a real shift has
occurred or not): insofar as an alleged ignoratio elenchi is evaluated and then ac-
cepted by the audience – in a dialectical and rhetorical context – it becomes a good
argument.
In the three cases of ignoratio elenchi illustrated above, the abductive skills
involved concern the ability of turning information about people, and the social
characters they represent, into relevant knowledge supporting one view rather than
another. In the argumentum ad hominem this ability is related to the formulation of
those abductive inferences, which successfully employ and evaluate the information
discrediting your opponent. In the argumentum ad verecundiam the abductive pro-
cess involved is connected to the selection of experts and authorities who may be
recognized as such by a certain audience. Finally, the case of the argumentum ad
populum involves the selection of the majority to be heeded, taking its composition
into account. The possibility of gaining the favor of an audience also depends on
contextual variables such as value orientations or beliefs, previous knowledge on
the matter, and so on.
As argued by Dessalles [2000], logic itself could have evolved as a powerful tool
able to give us reliable indicators for assessing individual linguistic competence
and arguments. This contention needs some reﬁnement. If fallacy evaluation results
from an abductive process performed by the speaker as well as the listener, then we
may argue that a genuine competence may have some relation with the abductive
skills used by the speaker. In this sense, the success of an individual is closely re-
lated to his/her ability to display sophisticated abductive skills (or those judged as
such).10

Gossip, Reasoning, and Knowledge
1.3.1
Ignorance and Knowledge
As a matter of fact, human beings are limited in their cognitive abilities to solve
problems and make decisions. To shed light on this point, consider the so-called ig-
norance problem introduced by Gabbay and Woods [2005]. The ignorance problem
can be seen as a general frame for investigating knowledge and human cognition,
since most of the activities humans are involved in can be precisely described in
these terms.
10 Indeed, the ability to display such sophisticated abductive skills has only ever been avail-
able to a minority of human beings during a small recent fraction of the time span of human
existence. On the relationship between logic and the pre-literal mind, see Harris [2009].

1 Fallacies and Cognition: The Rationale of Being Fallacious
Formally speaking, an agent A has an ignorance problem in presence of a cog-
nitive target T, which can be attained by a piece of knowledge K lacking at time t.
Commonly, any ignorance problem is thought to have two solutions: 1) the case in
which the agent solves it acquiring K, and 2) the case in which she cannot solve it,
because she cannot acquire K. Gabbay and Woods [2005] pointed out that these two
options do not exhaust the solution space available. Simply, this does not represent
what a human agent does, and how she behaves. For they introduced a third solution
according to which the attainment of T can only happen by means of conjecturing
H, which, if true, would hit the target T.
As Gabbay and Woods brilliantly argued, in this case the attainment of T can
only be presumptive, and the ignorance problem is merely transformed into some-
thing manageable, but is not solved. In fact, H is only a surrogate which may attain
a lesser target. It is worth noting that the act of conjecturing H would not attain
T, however H becomes a valuable candidate for producing new knowledge. This
clearly captures one of the most fundamental features of abduction, which is its am-
pliative character [Magnani, 1992a; Magnani, 2001]. The ampliative character of
abduction is somehow Socratic, as it is ignorance-preserving, as noted by Gabbay
and Woods. Abduction is ignorance-preserving, since it would not allow us to ac-
quire K, but only H. And, as long as we lack K, then we are forced to preserve our
ignorance with respect of it.
In addition to that argued by Gabbay and Woods, we would add a fourth option
to the problem, which is transformative, but it is still quite different from the third
option. The main limit of Gabbay and Woods’ account is that it does not address
any concerns about the social (or extra-individual) dimension of human cognition.
As a matter of fact, we do not live alone, and most of the time decisions are made
in concert with other people. This is obvious, for instance, in the case of children
whose parents provide them with most of the resources needed to fulﬁll their basic
needs. Other people’s help is still vital later in life; the degree to which people lean
on each other is astonishing, as it is nearly impossible to directly experience any
piece of knowledge one would need to make it.
In the following, I will describe the fourth option as the one in which we basi-
cally resort to the resources we can exhibit as part of a social group. These resources
are available regardless of competence or domain-speciﬁc knowledge; they are sim-
ply resulting from the fact that human cognition would be biased towards social
problem-solving11 [Humphrey, 1976; Byrne and Whiten, 1997]. The fallacies I de-
scribed in the previous section are three different examples of the same case showing
how problems can be solved leaning on the social dimension of human reasoning.
In the remaining part of this chapter, I will show how gossiping may turn out to be
a resource for problem-solving. More speciﬁcally, I will claim the fallacies I listed
above seem to have a taste for gossip.
11 This contention will be detailed in section 5.1.

1.3 Gossip, Reasoning, and Knowledge
15
1.3.2
Reasoning through Gossiping
Gossip is commonly recognized as something rooted in the desire to harm or dam-
age others. For instance, a dictionary deﬁnition of gossip is idle talk potentially
threatening for one’s reputation. But, is that always true?
In the last decade or so, the study of gossip has been focusing on two main lines
of research. The ﬁrst considers gossip as a way of exchanging information typical
of human societies [Yerkovich, 1977; Ben-S´eev, 1994; Baumeister et al., 2004]; the
second deals with its evolutionary dimension, especially in the case of the social
evolution of language [Dunbar, 1996; Dunbar, 2004] and of coalitions and group
management, in the framework of the multilevel selection [Wilson et al., 2000]. Ac-
cording to this latter perspective, gossip may be deﬁned as that kind of talk that aims
at reporting stories – conﬁrmed or not – about other absent people.
As just mentioned, gossip is a way of speaking, through which people manage
and exchange information about others and their social setting [Yerkovich, 1977;
Ben-S´eev, 1994]. Think of how much time we devote to recounting or listening to
the misadventures of others just to avoid making the same mistakes they made. For
instance, gossiping about a friend of ours and his girlfriend or wife may provide us
with some useful ideas to solve our own problems. As a matter of fact we are used
to gossiping about everybody from friends to colleagues and acquaintances. People
are interested in listening to and talking about what happens to other people.
According to Baumeister et al. [2004], gossiping turns out to be useful for cul-
tural learning. Being part of a society or a group of persons (at school or work, for
example) requires the individual to follow a set of rules and behavioral templates
that have an external and rigid structure. Gossiping becomes a basis for learning
conduct and moral rules that are embedded in the concrete stories and narratives
people gossip about [Sabini and Silver, 1982]. In this sense, gossip serves the pur-
pose of transmitting rules, norms and guidelines, and it contributes to social control
[Wilson et al., 2000]. It can also have a positive effect on ourselves, since gossiping
increases self-esteem and diminishes anxiety. From a cognitive perspective, gossip
constitutes an “extension of observational learning” and “a common stock of knowl-
edge” which people can rely on [Baumeister et al., 2004, p. 120].
Gossip has been usefully investigated by Dunbar [1996; 2004] from an evolu-
tionary perspective. Dunbar argued that gossip resulted as an effective bounding
mechanism, adaptively developed to tame social complexity, as our ancestors began
living in larger groups.12 Of course, living in larger groups had a dramatic effect on
our ancestors’ survival chances, because it permitted them to render hunting much
more effective: hunting in large numbers improved self-defense, decreased risk
from predators and increased the capacities for exploiting food provided in large
quantities, for example. If this constituted a successful strategy to face various dan-
gers, it did come at the cost of increasing cognitive demands. Living in large group
12 Interestingly, Hill and Dunbar [2003] estimated that in contemporary Western society one’s
social network size averaged 124 individuals with a maximum of 153 individuals. They
calculated human social network size on the exchange of Christmas cards.

16
1 Fallacies and Cognition: The Rationale of Being Fallacious
imposed severe demands on our ancestors’ cognitive system. For instance, it re-
quired the ability to interpret visual signs, to distinguish between friends and
enemies, to recall faces and to make a coalition for promoting social exchange
[Mithen, 1996].
The development of gossip as a bounding mechanism is strictly related to the ori-
gin of language. According to Dunbar [1996], language emerged as a more effective
means of communication in modern human communities, and it was mainly devoted
to transferring information concerning group organization and management, since it
enabled humans to communicate about third-party relationships. Early forms of lan-
guage prevailed over preexisting means of communication like vocal grooming, as
hypothesized by Dunbar, because of their efﬁciency in transmitting knowledge and
conveying information via a structured stream of sound [Pinker, 2003]. For instance,
representations conveyed through words allow humans to have a valid substitute for
ﬁrst-hand experience, which can be easily passed on through narratives and stories
as the case of gossip demonstrates.13 Conversely, vocal grooming provided a very
poor connection and limited information storage capacity with respect to the range
of activities our ancestors faced daily.
Beyond its speculative character, Dunbar’s hypothesis points to the fascinating
conclusion that language could be originally shaped for managing larger group com-
munication. In doing so, language made social exchange an essential cognitive asset
for modern humans: it facilitated some fundamental activities for managing complex
societies such as the negotiated division of labour and the collaboration of large non-
kin groups. Accordingly, the evolutionary success of language might be primarily
connected to its gossip-enabling features.14
The connection between gossip and language is made even more explicit by
Wilson et al. [Wilson et al., 2002]. They argued that gossip is a speciﬁc use of lan-
guage resulting from an activity of social control. Although gossip can be used for
self-serving purposes, they maintained it is primarily related to group-serving be-
haviors. That is, gossip is a major means of controlling self-serving behaviors and
policing them. The three fallacies can be easily considered in the light of group-
serving behaviors as well. For instance, discrediting your opponent – the argumen-
tum ad hominem – can be considered as a means of controlling ideas and behaviors,
which do not ﬁt within the group. This can be deemed as a kind of immunization –
functioning at group-level – from heterodoxy and alien ideas, as gossip in the form
13 Dautenhan illustrated a speculative hypothesis called “the narrative intelligence hypothe-
sis”, in which she argued the connection between the peculiar narrative form of language
(and its products, i.e., stories and narratives) and the development of social skills in taming
social complexity [Dautenhan, 2001]
14 This last consideration is contended by Dessalles [2000]. What he argues is slightly differ-
ent: according to him, language did indeed spread out because of its efﬁciency in dealing
with social complexity, but he goes further maintaining that the primary function of lan-
guage is related to saying something relevant in order to access social status, which, in
theory, is correlated with better chances of reproduction. Therefore, striving to acquire a
better social status, the need to exchange social information does not explain relevance,
but relevance explains gossip [Dessalles, 2000, p. 71].

1.3 Gossip, Reasoning, and Knowledge
17
of denigrating or damaging one’s reputation is promptly triggered. In this case, an
ad hominem serves to detect and eliminate a possible threat for the group orthodoxy
that is still operating at group-level. An ad hominem has a rhetorical role as well,
insofar as it is aimed at convincing an auditorium to dismiss your opponent’s view.
In this case, the target is to form new alliances based on one’s reputation, rather than
other criteria, for instance, coherence, truth, etc. The same can be argued about the
argumentum ad verecundiam, which is specular with respect to the argumentum ad
hominem. The appeal to an authority can have two major functions. First of all, it is
group-serving in as far as it is based on the appeal to an authority that is supposed
and acknowledged to be such within that group or community. Needless to say,
an appeal to the Pope during a discussion at the Annual Conference of the Italian
Catholic Federation would more easily resolve potential conﬂict than an appeal to
the British Prime Minister. The members of the Italian Catholic Federation clearly
recognize the Pope as an authority and this contributes to social cohesion. Secondly,
the appeal to an authority can also have an important role in building new alliances
resulting from irreducible conﬂicts among members who belong to the same group.
In this case, an ad verecundiam has more of a rhetorical role than a dialectical one,
because it is aimed at reconﬁguring both the membership and partnership of two
emerging and opposing groups.
The fallacies I surveyed above – ad hominem, ad populum, and ad verecundiam
– have important connections with gossip. As already argued, gossip is fallacy-
enabling, because it provides the arguer with additional resources in the form of
narratives about other people, for instance, about who they are, what they do and did,
etc. In turn, these resources may be deployed in the three arguments I am dealing
with. In ad hominem we employ information which discredits the person (or the
group of people) holding a different view from ours. This activity is closer to the
common meaning of gossip, that is, a talk harming one’s reputation.
A given source can be rejected by making use of malicious gossip that poisons it;
in section 1.2.2 I mentioned the case of Professor Singer, about whom his opponents
gossiped claiming that over the past twenty years since he had retired from the
University of Virginia, he had no articles published in peer-reviewed journals, and
so he should no longer be considered an authority on the matter under discussion.
In the ad verecundiam we employ information which make us prone to accept a
conclusion just because we trust the person who holds it. Personal achievements,
experiences, moral qualities – in the form of stories (“he never lied [...] even when
he was pressed to do so by the circumstances [...]”) – may be easily transmitted,
and so they furnish a basis for acknowledging and accepting a given person as an
authority in a given ﬁeld. In the last case of the argumentum ad populum, we accept
a conclusion, because the majority of people do.
The dimension provided by gossip can be labeled as eco-cognitive, because it
delivers information and resources, which are embedded in the social channels and,
more generally, in the cognitive niche one lives in. Gossip provides the suitable eco-
cognitive and eco-logical endowments to turn social information (resulting from
gossip) into potentially relevant knowledge for other purposes (resolving conﬂicts,

18
1 Fallacies and Cognition: The Rationale of Being Fallacious
building new alliances, etc.). In this sense, it can be considered as a way of reasoning
that I may label gossiping, since it makes use of social information about other
people, usually obtained and transferred through gossip:15 for example, the role a
person plays in society, his achievements as well as his failures, etc. That is, the
premissory starting points of one’s argument are obtained through gossiping (I will
come back to this issue in Chapter 2).
More generally, I maintain that gossiping fallacies represent scant-resource ad-
justment strategies [Gigerenzer and Selten, 2001] based on the creation of other
people as social characters, used in order to obtain more information, lessen cog-
nitive overload and solve disagreements. That is, people make sound arguments
based on their knowledge about other people. Roughly speaking, we may say that
it is not a matter of what we know, but who we know. Making use of the resources
embedded in social channels can be viewed as a heuristic. A heuristic is deﬁned as
a device that can solve a class of problems in situations with limited knowledge and
time [Simon, 1977]. From a cognitive perspective, a heuristic is therefore a kind of
facilitator, which helps humans to manage complex tasks transforming them into
simpler ones. It can eventually contribute to creating new valuable solutions in the
presence of little or poor information.16
1.4
Concluding Remarks
In this chapter I have tried to show how some reasoning, though fallacious, can
appear to be attractive and useful for beings-like-us. Taking advantage of the agent-
based framework on logic developed by Gabbay and Woods, I argued that fallacious
arguments should not be thought to be entirely bad, because they can be symp-
tomatic of the way human cognition evolves and functions.
Assuming this derivative conception of fallacy, I have surveyed a number of fal-
lacies, namely, the ad hominem, ad verecundiam, and ad populum, which – I posited
– are symptomatic of a general feature human cognition appears to exhibit: the ten-
dency of making use of knowledge about the others as a fundamental cognitive
asset. These fallacies – I argued – share with gossip the same cognitive strategy: the
exploitation of the social dimension as a source for transmitting and manipulating
information. Rather then being idle talk, gossip constitutes a way of transmitting
information and managing coalitions and groups, which had a pivotal role in the
evolution of language and cognition. Seemingly, the “ad” arguments I illustrated
can be considered as scant-resource adjustment strategies, which make use of infor-
mation embedded in social exchange.
15 Those arguments relying on “social information” are also labeled as “ethotic arguments”
[Walton, 1999a]. Walton [1999a] deﬁned “ethotic arguments” as those arguments in which
“the character (ethos) of the arguer is involved”. In the following, we will develop this idea
by making an explicit connection with the gossip related dimension of ethotic arguments.
16 We will come back to heuristics in Chapter 2 when dealing with bounded rationality and
biased rationality.

1.4 Concluding Remarks
19
The task set for the next Chapter will be to give a broad cognitive meaning to the
various scant-resource adjustment strategies humans employ. In particular, I will
explore the following question: how could we explain the simple fact that beings-
like-us are fallacious and, at the same time, that they exhibit the very sophisticated
reasoning responsible for the amazing ecological success of our species? Do various
scant-resource adjustment strategies and the so-called “bounded rationality” account
for both human failure and success?

Chapter 2
Bounded Rationality as Biased Rationality:
Virtues, Vices, and Assumptions
Introduction
This chapter aims at broadening some of the issues introduced in the last part of
Chapter 1. In that chapter I maintained that fallacies are bad for logic, but could
be good for surviving. A fallacy can be considered as a kind of default reasoning,
which has an adaptive value under some circumstances. As default reasoning, fal-
lacy allows beings-like-us to solve problems or make decisions in the absence of
knowledge with respect to a certain domain. Following the crowd or mom’s sayso
are amazing competence-surrogates. Fallacies are part of a kind of rationality that
in the following I will call biased rationality.
In the ﬁrst two sections of this chapter, I will illustrate the Bounded Rational-
ity Theory along with its assumptions and limitations. The Bounded Rationality
Theory – now becoming mainstream – is of such importance, because it furnishes
the theoretical background for my proposal. As Herbert H. Simon argued, “ratio-
nality is bounded when it falls short of omniscience. And failures of omniscience
are largely failures of knowing all the alternatives [...]” [Simon, 1979, p. 502].
This is precisely in line with the agent-based approach I illustrated in section 1.1.
The Bounded Rationality Theory warns us to adopt a cognitive agenda, which does
not seriously take into account what a person can actually do, and not what she
should do.
In section 2.3, I will present biased rationality as a particular interpretation of
bounded rationality. More precisely, I will illustrate the idea of Homo Heuristicus
introduced by Gigerenzer and colleagues. In that section, I will be dealing with
some issues related to heuristics and biases with relation to fallacious reasoning.
More precisely, I will argue that the rationale of biased rationality consists in turning
ignorance into a cognitive virtue.
In the two next sections, I will go back to the question of fallacious reasoning
presented in Chapter 1. Taking advantage of the distinction between competence-
independent information and competence-dependent information, I will maintain
that the adaptive role of biased rationality is conditional, as they lack what I call

symptomaticity. That is, the adaptive value of fallacies are limited to those situa-
tions in which we do not have information, whereas being in such a situation is not
adaptive at all. In fact, As humans learn and accumulate knowledge, what will call
fallacy turn out to be poorly adaptive, because they block any possible improvement
due to learning.
Finally, I will broaden the problem of fallacies in the last section with respect to
the process of cognitive niche impoverishment. This is meant to stress the fact that
the resources delivered via the cognitive niche are not to be taken for granted. In
doing so, I will introduce the notion of cognitive ochlocracy so as to give a tentative
description of the phenomenon of cognitive niche impoverishment.
2.1
Laying Down the Main Assumptions of the Bounded
Rationality Model
The concept of bounded rationality was ﬁrst introduced by Herbert Simon in
one of his ﬁrst and most well-known works [Simon, 1947]. Since 1947 Si-
mon himself returned to the point many times [Simon, 1955; Simon, 1978;
Simon, 1979; Simon, 1983] and other scholars also used bounded rationality
[Cyert and March, 1963; Nelson and G.Winter, 1972].
Most theories refer to BR as a powerful analytical basis, without questioning or
modifying it directly [Foss, 2003; Conlisk, 1996] (for an exception to this general
trend, see Selten [Selten, 1998]). For this and other reasons, that will be addressed
below, I prefer to refer directly to Simon’s approach [Lipman, 1995, p. 43].
As for Simon, “rationality is concerned with the selection of preferred behavior
alternatives in terms of some system of values whereby the consequences of behav-
ior can be evaluated” [Simon, 1947, p. 84]. That is to say that rationality is about: (1)
the selection of alternatives through a (2) system of values that allows individuals
to (3) behave in some way that can be submitted to (4) evaluation in its actual and
potential consequences. Hence, rationality is concerned ﬁrst with problem-solving
and decision-making activities, and then with the evaluation of results.
“Alternative selection”, has to do with alternative searching. To express it more
precisely, nothing can be selected if we do not look for alternatives ﬁrst. Thus, the
process of seeking alternatives is fundamental in decision-making. It is worth noting
that alternatives are to be made, i.e. they are produced by the individual engaged in
the decision-making process. Since alternatives are not exogenously given, I focus
my attention on two distinct possibilities. First, if the individual accesses to all possi-
ble alternatives, i.e. she/he is capable of creating a map of actual and potential effects
of her/his behavior, we say she/he is fully-rational. Second, if the individual cannot
produce the overall range of alternatives, i.e. she/he has limited computational ca-
pabilities and/or doesn’t have full access to environmental data and variables, we
say he/she is capable of bounded rationality only. The former is the economic man
of the neoclassical approach describing “how people ought to behave, not how they
do behave” [Simon, 1959, p. 254]. The latter is the real decision-maker, essentially

2.1 Laying Down the Main Assumptions of the Bounded Rationality Model

limited in his/her computational capabilities by internal and external limits (see also
[Todd and Gigerenzer, 2003]).
In other terms, to use Simon’s own deﬁnition, “rationality is bounded when it
falls short of omniscience”. And the failures of omniscience are largely failures
of knowing all the alternatives, uncertainty about relevant exogenous events, and
inability to calculate consequences” [Simon, 1979, p. 502]. Broadly speaking, limits
on rationality derive from natural constraints of human perception and from the fact
that we are incapable of computing the overall range of possible events. The ﬁrst set
of constraints relate to the environment, while the second refers directly to human
rational capabilities [Simon, 1955, p. 101].
Focusing on social organizations gave Simon a more detailed approach on the ra-
tionality issue. He tried to show that decision-making needs to relate with advance-
ments in psychology and social psychology studies [Simon, 1947; Simon, 1955].
The hypothesis is that human rationality cannot map all environmental variables,
create all the deriving alternatives, scan them, and then select the optimal option. In
other words, if we are not able to maximize, we can only make an approximation
to the optimal option. Therefore, individuals with bounded rationality reach satis-
ﬁcing results, i.e. they can only approximate the optimal result that is typical of the
neoclassical equilibrium theories. Here the role of search mechanisms is crucial.
Individual decision-making is based on seeking alternatives, and selecting them on
the basis of a deﬁnite set of values. The metaphor Simon uses in order to explain
this kind of searching is the decision tree [Simon, 1947; Newell and Simon, 1972],
where each alternative is put a payoff. It emerges that the idea of rationality is com-
pletely related to computational capabilities [March, 1978, p. 590] rather than to the
broader cognitive system. Behavior can always be deﬁned through algorithms, even
if in an imperfect way, and the bounded rational woman/man compute (the acts of
searching-evaluating-selecting) which alternative could be more appropriate.1
The result leads then only to the satisfacing and not to the optimal option. Fol-
lowing this approach, Simon rejects the principle of the one-best-way, introducing
the concept of second best. This implies that solutions to problems or selection of
alternatives can be only sub-optimal, in the real world. Moreover, we may obtain,
and we normally do, more than one sub-optimal alternatives (or solutions) to a given
situation (or problem). Thus, the bounded rationality model tries to take into account
variety and complications in decision-making processes.
In discussing decision making processes, Simon placed great emphasis on the
distinction between substantive and procedural rationality. He described that differ-
ence stating that:
1 This is the case of the so called “maximizing under constraints” approach to bounded
rationality [Stigler, 1961]. As Todd and Gigerenzer wrote, “[i]ntroducing real constraints
does makes this approach more realistic, but maintaining the ideal of optimization, that is,
calculating an optimal stopping point, does not. What is lost is psychological plausibility,
because such an ideal of optimization invokes new kinds of omniscience, being able to
foresee what additional information further search would bring, what it would cost, and
what opportunities one would forgo during that search” [Todd and Gigerenzer, 2003, pp.
45–46].

[. . . ] we must give an account not only of substantive rationality, the extent to
which appropriate courses of action are chosen, but also procedural rationality, the
effectiveness, in light of human cognitive powers and limitations, of the procedures
used to choose actions [Simon, 1978, p. 9].
According to substantive rationality, the rational character of decision-making
is concerned with the result one could get following the “appropriate” actions.
Whereas procedural rationality points out the procedure and the process by which
people make decisions. According to Simon, bounded rationality belongs to the lat-
ter category, because it does not look only at the result one could get, but also at the
way people make decisions [Simon, 1978].
In contrast, the traditional model of rationality (i.e. the neoclassical) mixes the
two aspects. The model is based on variable maximization (procedure), where we
obtain the only possible appropriate behavior as a result (substantive). Bounded
rationality theory just points out that the result we can get is only a satisﬁcing one,
i.e. we get approximating solutions [Simon, 1955]. The described process is merely
a computational one. When we get approximating results, we are supposed to make
computations on external and internal variables, limited by our perceptive system
and bounded rationality. If so, rationality remains a maximizing procedure, namely,
the brute force or computational procedure that humans can only partly employ.
The result is a serious challenge to the traditional neoclassical model (or the
SEU, cf. Neumann and Morgenstern [1944]) that remains, maybe, consistent in
normative-prescriptive terms but completely fails in its descriptive-behavioral at-
tempts (for a clear distinction between the two aspects, see March [1978], Frank
[1988], and Etzioni [1988] ). The BR model has been, and still is, a powerful con-
cept directed to opening the “brain as a black-box” hypotheses of the traditional
economic theories. Simon opens human economic reasoning to other disciplinary
domains, such as psychology, social psychology, computer science, cognitive sci-
ence, politics, and so on. In other terms, it was an outstanding ﬁrst step towards the
search for a more realistic way to deﬁne human behavior.
2.2
Getting in the Dirty: Major Constraints and Problems
My main take that I am going to elaborate in this section is that the main difﬁ-
culty that bounded rationality encounters is that of explaining the overall range of
successful performances [Hanoch, 2002]. In this case, the argument of bounded ra-
tionality is leaking [Beach, 1997; Beach, 1998]. While it is empirically grounded
that individuals display severe computational limits, they actually carry out very
complex tasks that do not simply approximate the best solution. This can be easily
demonstrated using two different claims.
On the one hand, following Simon’s approach, the optimum result can never
be reached [Simon, 1979]. I suggest, additionally, that the optimal result cannot
even be envisaged. This is a relativity-based position, and I can argue that if we
do not know what the optimum is, why do we approximate? More precisely, to
what do we approximate? Nonetheless, actual behavior shows successful results

2.2 Getting in the Dirty: Major Constraints and Problems
25
as well. This supports the hypothesis that successful individual behavior can be
evaluated through many procedural methodologies, through which the computa-
tional remains the one related to the non-reachable and non-thinkable optimum
[Mitchell and Beach, 1990].
But what about when people are successful? The history of human discoveries
displays plenty of these amazing and highly successful results. How can the bounded
rationality theory explain that?
I start by differentiating between procedures and results as a way in which to
analyze successful outcomes and then I turn to the notion of heuristics as a possible
explanation of BR uses. The case of emotion helps in deﬁning the weaknesses of
this crucial point.
2.2.1
Procedures and Results
In order to illustrate my point, let me introduce an important distinction between
procedures and results. This is a common distinction in managerial science, where
efﬁciency is the measure of the way in which results are organized, that is the proce-
dures (or processes), while effectiveness is the measure of results on the basis of the
original goal. The ﬁrst refers to means, the second to goal evaluation [Simon, 1947].
In the case of the neoclassical approach to rationality, we have “optimizing”2
procedures and “optimum” results (see Table below). Let me use these terms with-
out directly referring to the neoclassical tradition of thought. In the ﬁrst instance,
optimum can be considered as an end-state notion [Hempel, 1966]. That is, we do
not care about how to get a certain result: we just look at the outcome of a decision
whether it is optimum or not (efﬁcacy). According to that, optimum results can be
regarded as the best results possible (i.e. always successful), in given conditions, i.e.
ceteris paribus.
Secondly, optimum can also be considered as an outcome that is strictly deﬁned
by a given strategy. In this case, the term “optimum” refers to a procedure that is
the optimizing strategy or “brute force” strategy (efﬁciency). Therefore, we may
have an end-state optimum or optimum result (that I may call the best or always
successful result) that may be independent to the optimizing strategy. To sum up:
optimizing procedure is not equivalent to the optimum result or, likewise it can be
said that procedural effectiveness may not coincide with the best result possible.
In other terms, if we focus on results and on procedures independently, we might
obtain different outcomes [Mintzberg, 1989].
The case might be that of, for example, the senior manager of a medium-sized
enterprise “sensing” a great opportunity in terms of increasing the corporate market
2 I employ the terms “maximizing” and “optimizing” in their slightly different meanings. In
fact, maximizing is the process of reaching the maximal result, on a given set of variables;
in this sense, it maintains a mathematic ﬂavor. Optimizing is the best result, i.e. maxi-
mization of the entire spectrum of variables. While Simon’s approach might be referred
to the ﬁrst (or to the “minimax” rule, see Newell and Simon [1972]) neoclassical Authors
normally refer to the second.

26

share and revenues, and then taking a high risk at their own responsibility without
following any orthodox decision-making process (i.e. search-evaluation-selection
of alternatives). The problem concerned is that of reaching an effective result, while
the problem with rational choice is that of efﬁciency. The two results – the ﬁrst from
“sixth-sense” or intuition, and the second from efﬁciency – can differ signiﬁcantly.
Now, suppose the efﬁcient decision making process is “perfect,” i.e. without trans-
action costs, the player fully-rational, with perfect knowledge assumption, and so
on. How can you take into account variables such as creativity, intuition, personal
attitudes, leadership, etc. within the decision making process? The neoclassical and
Simon’s models do not evaluate these aspects. In any case, decisions have to deal
with multiple tradeoffs and externalities. In actual behavior – i.e. with transaction
costs, unstable environmental conditions, and so on – these elements do count, and
non-computable decisions are often successful. We can provide many cases on this
point. However, let me just mention another one, related to ﬁnancial traders and
their use of so-called “technical ﬁnancial analysis.” This analysis is based on lines
traced on graphs which describe the variations of stock prices in a given period, in
order to forecast the trend and decide when to buy or sell. The tool has never been
validated by scientiﬁc studies; arguments for its success lay on personal attitudes,
intuition, creativity, knowledge of that market, etc. That is to say on the trader’s
non-computational capabilities.

Simon deﬁnes his satisﬁcing result through procedures, and essentially computa-
tional ones; so that his model is affected by the same shotcomings as the neoclassical
ones, from this point of view. In other words, my main claim is that Simon’s theory
simply fails in assuming that highly successful results, or optimum ones, can only
be obtained by a brute force strategy, as if it is the only rational strategy. That is,
Simon seems to deny the possibility of getting an optimum result without employ-
ing an optimizing procedure. Bounded rationality theory just states that the ensuing
result from this strategy can only be approximating, because of human limits.
2.2.2
Explaining Successful Outcomes
Generally speaking, I claim bounded rationality theory is fairly grounded when it
deals with explaining human failures; but it fails in coping with other situations that
do not necessarily involve unsuccessful outcomes or biases. Hence, the question that
still challenges the theory of bounded rationality is: If we could get a successful (or
workable, in the sense of Beach [1998]) result using a different strategy, would the
brute force rationality be exploited? Would we still be bounded in that way? How
do bounds really work?

2.2 Getting in the Dirty: Major Constraints and Problems
27
In sum, bounded rationality is based on the following assumptions:
1. maximizing strategy is the only way to get successful results;
2. the notion of bounded rationality refers to the extent to which we can employ the
brute force strategy;
3. the notion of satisﬁcing concerns the results that the limited humans could get by
employing the brute force strategy;
4. humans can only partly employ this strategy since their limits and the complexity
of the environment.
I accept (3) and (4), but I reject (1) and (2). This is due to the fact that these two
assumptions cannot allow us to explain and account for all those situations in which
humans successfully carry out complex tasks.
Beach [1998] presented a theory of decision making that is intended to overcome
these difﬁculties; it is the so-called image theory. As they explain in summary, the
theory is based on “three different schematic knowledge structures” (p.12) that de-
cision makers use to “organize their thinking about decisions” (p.12). These struc-
tures are called images. The value image is related to general principles on which
behavior (both individual and organizational) is based, i.e. to one’s personal moral
beliefs. The “trajectory image” is related to the goals (p.12) one tries to achieve; it
underlines that everyone, in achieving determined objectives (real or abstract ones),
generates a personal view (vision) about the future possible outcomes and everyone
has hopes and fears about goal achievement. Here, emotions seem to be called into
action, but nothing is explicitly mentioned in the text. This trajectory image seems
to be very dynamic, in the sense that it constantly modiﬁes, depending on the type
of goal set, and on the means one has to achieve it. Depending on the type of goal
and of the decision (procedural or one-shot) the image can dramatically change.
Last, the strategic image concerns the plans set to get the result; concrete actions
are called tactics, while the more abstract anticipations on future events are called
forecasting (pp. 12-13). This image needs the latter to come into existence. This is
the “hard core” of the theory, in the sense that it can be re-conducted to previous
decision-making theories [Simon, 1955]. Strategy can change with the addition of
information, that is to say with modiﬁcations in both environmental and internal
(cognitive) variables.
The three images provide a dynamic interaction between means-end relations and
human perception. The psychological background of the theory and its attempts to
overcome the procedure-result divergences come out very clearly [Beach, 1997].
Despite the powerful set of analytical and empirical work around image theory,
the arguments for “images” are still to be found. However, I refer to this theory
as one of the best attempts to move forward from the ﬁrst approaches to decision
making, and my work intends to be a contribution that enriches the image theory
perspective. As I will explain below, my objective is to analyze the inner core of
human cognitive capabilities in order to provide theories of decision making with a
powerful set of concepts that are able to frame human behavior. To this extent, my
theory of decision making integrates (if not comprehends) image theory.

28

2.2.3
The Notion of Heuristics
In order to overcome all the difﬁculties related to explaining successful outcomes,
Simon introduces what he called “approximating mechanisms” [Simon, 1955].
These mechanisms are the heuristics, or rules-of-thumb, and allow us to have a
general picture of the problem one is facing. That is, they reduce the cognitive
and computational demand to solve a problem or make a decision [Simon, 1955;
Hanoch, 2002]. I claim that this is somehow an ad hoc explanation, because it can-
not be fully integrated in the general model of bounded rationality. Some questions
immediately come up: Is heuristics part of the rational process? Or is it just a trick
to solve complex problems?
My argument arises from the above mentioned distinction between procedures
and results. One of the assumptions that bounded rationality theory makes is that
computation (that is formalized through optimizing procedures) is the only way to
get successful but satisﬁcing results. If that is true, heuristics can only get satisﬁcing
results, because it approximately mirrors the optimizing procedure. It follows that
the notion of heuristics itself cannot explain why humans may get successful results;
it can be related to a game tree, with ex post explanations only. To make this point
clearer, let me consider the Figure 1. Here, from the initial point, the decision maker
can immediately reach a high alternative at the ﬁfth level, or she/he can make the
ﬁrst choice and then skip to the fourth. This is, in extreme synthesis, a scheme of
what we can refer to as heuristic in decision making.
It seems that the concept of heuristics refers only to a simpliﬁcation of the task
one faces. That is, my contention is that heuristics does not change the way we cope
with a problem: it just helps to have a general picture of it. In this sense, it is some-
thing like, for example, a poorly detailed city map. One can see the wide main streets
and the railway station, for instance, but not the post ofﬁce, the information center, or
even shops, hotels, secondary streets, and so on. Indeed, even a poorly detailed map
can be useful in many cases, however, the point is that heuristics does not provide

2.2 Getting in the Dirty: Major Constraints and Problems
29
an alternative behavioral model of decision-making, because it essentially remains
based on the tree game, that oversimpliﬁes reality [Newell and Simon, 1972] were
aware of these limits). In this sense, the concept of heuristics is completely coherent
to an under-constrain – or bounded – procedure of optimization.
However it is, the notion of heuristics that seems to introduce a radical and differ-
ent perspective about how we make decisions and solve problems. As shown above,
heuristics as an ad hoc argument is lacking, but it can be very useful in order to
devise an alternative model: it can be considered as an anomaly that we must take
into account [Kahneman et al., 1990]. The main reason to attribute such a role to it
is that heuristics can be viewed as a facilitator. That is, it helps humans to manage
complex tasks, and even create new valuable solutions. I will come back to this issue
in section 2.3.1.
2.2.4
Emotions
In the last part of his life, Simon placed increasing emphasis on the role played by
various mechanisms, such as emotions, that help bounded rationality [Simon, 1983].
Humans can be partly rational because of their limits and the complexity of the en-
vironment and, hence, they try to devise alternative paths to overcome all these
constraints. This, I suggest, is connected to the idea of heuristics. As Simon put
it: “emotion has particular importance because of its functions of selecting particu-
lar things in our environments as the focus of our attention” [Simon, 1983, p. 29].
Although Simon acknowledges the role of emotions in setting agenda for problem
solving, he has never tried to integrate them, or other various external mechanisms,
into the bounded rationality model [Hanoch, 2002].
Several authors have recently opened up new and interesting perspectives on the
cognitive role played by emotions. Favored theories mainly fall into two general cat-
egories [Thagard, 2005]. The ﬁrst category considers emotions as judgments about
a person’s general state [Oatley, 1992; Nussbaum, 2001]. Accordingly, an emotion,
fear for instance, can be viewed as a result of an inference that accounts for cer-
tain clues and triggers a certain response. In this sense, emotion is a “summary
appraisal” [Thagard, 2005]. Hanoch [2002], for example, pointed out that emotions,
rather than being a mere constraint to rationality, are also an aid to rationality. To
be more precise, they (a) “function as an information processing mechanism with
their own internal logic, working in conjunction with rational calculation, [...] (b)
can function as a mechanism for establishing a hierarchy of goals by pressing us to
pursue goals that have high survival value while setting aside less urgent ones” (pp.
7-8), moreover, (c) emotions also let individuals imagine what can happen.
The second category considers emotions as bodily reactions. Damasio pointed
out that emotions are collections of chemical and neural responses [Damasio, 1999,
p. 51] that use the body as their theater. According to that, emotions serve two main
purposes: ﬁrst, the production of a certain reaction, for instance, fear may induce
humans to run away, if facing danger; second, emotions regulate internal states of
the organism so that it can be ready to effect a certain reaction. Increasing blood
ﬂow and breathing rhythm are examples of this kind [Damasio, 1999, p. 54].

30
2 Bounded Rationality as Biased Rationality: Virtues, Vices, and Assumptions
I suggest that these two views about the nature of emotions are not alternative,
but rather complementary. As stated by the ﬁrst category, I may argue that emotion
is a kind of representation (or cognitive state) that can be considered a part of the
cognitive process involved in decision-making. It helps humans to concentrate upon
what matters overcoming our limited computational resources. However, as argued
in the second category, the cognitive relevance of emotions is not the one displayed
by cold reasoning. In fact, emotions also involve a bodily reaction. In this sense, the
representation we have of emotions is not something triggered within our conscious
mind; physiological changes occur in terms of breathing rate, blood pressure, and so
on. Accordingly, I may say that the body is the theatre of emotions [Damasio, 1999,
p. 51]. Hence, the question is: What kind of representation is an emotion connected
to? What is its nature?
Regarding emotions as both cognitive states and bodily reactions suggests an
alternative model of rationality and decision-making, since emotions call for an ex-
tension of the notion of rationality used in the BR theories. The role of emotions is
a kind of opening argument because it is something unexplained in Simon’s model
but, as we now see, fundamental in human behavior. More precisely, the question
was: In which way do emotions affect decisions? On this point, I argued that they
do it by modifying cognitive states and, at the same time, requiring bodily reactions.
I now want to take things a few steps further: How do these elements affect ratio-
nality? And, furthermore, if emotions as representations are part of the cognitive
process, then how about all kinds of representations? Or, more basically, what is
the nature of these representations and how can they modify our model of rational
choice?
2.3
Biasing Rationality
2.3.1
Introducing the Homo Heuristicus
In Chapter 1 I dealt with the problem of fallacies. My main take was that a fallacy
does not necessary lead to a bad outcome. Accordingly, it can be either a good or
bad argument. This is due to the fact that an argument is fallacious with relation
to a standard or a set of standards. In turn, the setting of a standard depends on
the resources the agent involved has. This is basically the so-called resource-based
approach to fallacy introduced and popularized among logicians and cognitive sci-
entists by John Woods and Dov Gabbay.
In the previous sections I have tackled the main issue underlying the resource-
based approach to fallacy, that is, the notion of bounded rationality. I have argued
that the notion of bounded rationality puts the limits of the classic models of ra-
tionality on display. In particular, bounded rationality points to the idealistic and
abstract assumptions underlying the traditional models of rationality.
However, the weakest point of bounded rationality is that it does not ap-
propriately take into account that human beings may also be successful. In
order to explore this point, I will brieﬂy illustrate the idea of homo heuris-
ticus introduced and developed during the last two decades by Gigerenzer

2.3 Biasing Rationality
31
and colleagues (cf. [Gigerenzer and Goldstein, 1996; Gigerenzer and Selten, 2001;
Todd and Gigerenzer, 2003; Gigerenzer, 2000;
Gigerenzer and Brighton, 2009]).
The idea of homo heuristicus explicitly addresses the problem of how to make two
apparently conﬂicting concepts consistent: accuracy as the result of a certain deci-
sion, and effort as the amount of resources deployed in the decision-making process.
The idea of homo heuristicus stems from the rejection of two main assumptions
about accuracy and effort. The ﬁrst is that a heuristic always involves a trade-off to
be reached between accuracy and effort, as they are basically conﬂicting concepts.
In fact, accuracy usually involves time and resources. Therefore, given the fact that
humans operate in cognitive economy with limited time and resources, they have to
rely on decisions that are accurate enough, meaning that they might simply have to
discard those strategies which lead to more accurate outcomes, but require greater
resources. Heuristics are thought to be strategies reaching an accuracy-effort trade-
off (cf. section 2.2.3).
The second assumption can be called the “principle of total evidence”. The prin-
ciple of total evidence – introduced by Carnap [1947] and explicitly mentioned by
Gigerenzer and colleagues – states that it is always better to take into account the
total evidence available in order to determine whether or not a certain hypothesis or
course of action is justiﬁed or rational: that is, having more information is always
better than having less information. Or, To put it simply, more is always more, and
less is always less.
Contrary to these two beliefs, Gigerenzer and colleagues argued, and managed
to provide empirical evidence to support the idea, that heuristics are not always
accuracy-effort trade-offs. On certain occasions, one can attain higher accuracy with
less effort. Besides, more information may be detrimental leading not only to over-
load, but also to a general state of ignorance. Putting it simply, less is more and more
is less.
An example illustrating this point is the so-called “recognition-heuristic”. What
Gigerenzer and his team found is that when facing two alternatives, the one that is
recognized is usually selected [Raab and Gigerenzer, 2005]. In an interesting study,
Raab and Gigerenzer asked two groups of university students respectively a German
one and an American one, which city has a larger population between San Diego
and San Antonio. Quite surprisingly, 100% of German students responded correctly,
whereas only two thirds of American Students got the answer right. How could that
be possible? We would expect American students to get it right, as San Diego and
San Antonio are two American cities, and therefore they should know more about
them or, at least, have more information. The explanation provided by Gigerenzer
and colleagues is quite cunning. German students got it right, because they know
less. More precisely, they got it right, because they only recognized one of the two
cities, and thus they thought that it should have been the largest between the two.
This is a fair example of recognition heuristic.
Gigerenzer and colleagues studied and tested a number of heuristics that turn
out to be smart strategies for solving problems or making decisions. These
heuristics compose what is called the “adaptive toolbox” [Gigerenzer, 2000;
Gigerenzer and Brighton, 2009]. Basically, this is a set of fast-and-frugal strategies

32
2 Bounded Rationality as Biased Rationality: Virtues, Vices, and Assumptions
that allows us to attain high accuracy while still operating in cognitive economy. For
instance, ﬂuency heuristic. In the ﬂuency heuristic, both the of the two alternatives
are recognized, but the one that is recognized faster is picked. So, going back to the
example of the two cities, if I recognize San Diego faster than San Antonio, then I
will choose it. Another example of smart heuristic is the so-called take the best. The
best way to choose among concurrent and recognized options is to search for clues
and stop as soon as one ﬁnds a discriminating clue favoring one above the others.
The idea of less is more is less paradoxical than one might think. It means that
we simply operate selections: we basically search for the information that we think
is relevant. Indeed, the selections we make are to some extent arbitrary, since we
know what we select, but we do not know what we leave out. Heuristics are strate-
gies – partly dependent on the context in which one is operating – that serve to this
purpose: making use of what we know. In order to detail this point let me come back
to the problem of fallacies. I will introduce and illustrate an alternative framework,
which does not contrast with the results popularized by the proponents of the adap-
tive toolbox. It will however be useful for incorporating the idea of less is more into
a broader picture.
2.3.2
Easy to Use: The Rationale of Biased Rationality
The very idea behind the homo heuristicus furnishes an account about why biased
minds make better inferences. In fact, heuristics are biases. Traditionally speaking,
biases have been always considered as psychologically complex, leading to negative
or unhappy outcomes. A bias is not necessarily an error, but it is usually considered
as resulting from a poor or lower form of rationality, namely, biased rationality.
They can indeed speed up a decision-making process, but, generally speaking, they
are not necessarily a response to cognitive economy: they are easy to deploy them.
In his Irrationality. The Enemy Within [2000] Sutherland listed a number of bi-
ases that are, at the same time, errors and successful cognitive strategies, just as
Gigerenzer and colleagues showed. Let me mention a few of them, namely, the
availability bias, the primacy bias, and the halo effect. I mention them here, be-
cause they have something in common with those heuristics I have just dealt with.
The availability bias means seizing the ﬁrst impression one comes up with about
a person, an object or a situation. For instance, after witnessing a car crash, drivers
inevitably tend to slow down, because the scene brings to mind the possibility of
being involved in a similar accident.
The primacy bias consists in interpreting certain clues in light of those presented
earlier. This means that we usually continue to make use of ﬁrst impressions causing
a sort of priming effect. For instance, a teacher may favor certain students over
others simply because they obtained good marks in earlier examinations. Basically,
biased teachers would tend to color the interpretation of the students’ subsequent
performance according to the earlier result.
The halo effect is a further speciﬁcation of the availability bias and the primacy
bias. Basically, it occurs when a person judges a situation, an object or another
person relying only on one good trait. An example is a script presented in good

2.3 Biasing Rationality
33
handwriting. On average, scripts in good handwriting are rated higher than those
which are badly presented. In this case, good handwriting is the good trait one uses
in order formulate judgment overlooking other factors that might cause a change in
judgment.
These three biases are commonly considered as errors [Sutherland, 2000]. But
what kind of error? One can be biased, but at the same time achieve a good perfor-
mance, just like in the cases illustrated by Gigerenzer and colleagues. For instance,
a teacher may be biased towards certain students and those students might still per-
form very well at the same time. In this sense, it is not an error to get things right
when judging on ﬁrst impressions or coloring the interpretation of students’ later
performance based on initial results. It might however be an error because, if we
got things wrong, we could be more easily blamed for our mistake and we would be
told not to rush to judgment. We attribute a low cognitive status to biases because
it is easy to highlight their weaker points, even though their weakest points do not
necessarily lead us to be mistaken. It is this sort of blamability – actual or potential,
it does not matter – that is the source of mistrust. Basically, we have a commitment
towards negotiating “the journey from cognitively virtuous starting points to cogni-
tively virtuous outcomes” [Woods, 2009]: that is, we start out safely and we want to
arrive safely. Blamability warns us of the fact that we did not take the wrong path,
but that it was a dangerous one.
More generally, I maintain that this attitude rests on the human capacity for plan-
ning ahead. Basically, when confronting a problem, people try to foresee possible
objections, usually taking some precautions. Depending on their abilities and skills,
people may anticipate some of the negative consequences a certain course of action
might have. Planning ahead is somehow a certiﬁcation that unhappy consequences
may be prevented, even though we do not know precisely whether they are going
to happen or not. Therefore, what we consider erroneous is the way biases (but also
fallacies, as we will see) manage possible objections to a decision and/or unhappy
consequences.
Let me now go back the question about which city has a larger population be-
tween San Diego and San Antonio. As already mentioned, the German group an-
swered correctly, because they did not know San Antonio. Indeed, insofar as they
were not mistaken, we could not blame them because for their ignorance. However,
in the long run ignorance might be a problem.
2.3.3
Appealing to Ignorance and Its Cognitive Virtue
In order to clarify this point, I connect the recognition heuristic with an argument
– traditionally deemed as fallacious – the so called argumentum ad ignorantiam.
Let me make a very simple example. Suppose that John has to attend a meeting in
the afternoon at his department, but he has not received any communication yet.
Usually, department meetings are announced at least a few days before by the head
of the department who sends an email to all the staff members. But this time she did
not send any email to her colleagues. The meeting would usually start in less than

34
2 Bounded Rationality as Biased Rationality: Virtues, Vices, and Assumptions
one hour and John does not know what to do. Then, he carries out the following
reasoning:
1. If there were a meeting at my department I would know it.
2. I do not know such a thing.
3. Thus there will not be a meeting today at my department.
This is considered by traditionally-minded fallacy theorists to be a fallacy. The main
reason is that ignorance is never probative, meaning that it can only prove that one
does not know a thing. In fact, in my example there might be a number of reasons
why John did not come to know whether the meeting was going to happen or not.
1) Maybe his colleague sent him an email he never received, perhaps the head of
department did not type his email address correctly, and then forgot to pay attention
to the delivery failure message she should have received back. Carelessness in this
case could be the reason explaining his ignorance. 2) Maybe his colleagues did not
inform him about the meeting because they noticed he had not shown up during the
last week, and they thought he had taken a week off to work on the last chapter of
his book. Or 3) the head of the department and his other colleagues did not inform
him on purpose, because they wanted to mob him.
In this case, we do not need to know whether John is eventually right or wrong
but we can immediately see how it is easy – from an intellectual perspective – to
raise some objections to John’s argument. All the objections we were pointing to
are related to the fact that John could have relied on a better argument.
John followed a pattern of reasoning that is labeled by AI theorists as autoepis-
temic reasoning. As Gabbay and Woods put it, “autoepistemic inferences are pre-
sumptive in character”. Given that a candidate hypothesis is not known to be true, it
is presumed to be untrue” [Gabbay and Woods, 2005]. It is also known as negation
as failure [Walton, 1995] or argumentum ad ignorantiam. An ad ignorantiam con-
sists in an explicit appeal to our ignorance. In general, I analytically describe it as
follows:
1. John knows he does not know P.
2. John asks himself whether he would have known P.
3. He would have known P, if it had been true.
4. He does not know P.
5. Then, he knows P is false.
What is interesting about this formulation is that it stresses how we are able to
turn our ignorance into a cognitive virtue generating premissory starting points
that we previously lacked. In fact, In 1) P is what prevents John from deciding.
Conversely, in 4) P now becomes a clue suggesting a possible conclusion. It is 3)
that describes the move allowing to escape ignorance without overcoming it. This
ignorance-escaping feature of an argumentum ad ignorantiam should be treated
along with another one: the move described in 3) is ignorance-escaping insofar as it
is irrelevance-avoiding. In 1) John lacks premissory starting points that are relevant
to the matter. In fact, in my brief debunking we brought up a number of objections
that explicitly called for relevant information that should be acquired beforehand.

2.4 The Vices of Biased Rationality
35
However, although John does not overcome his ignorance by acquiring new and rel-
evant facts, he escapes from it by avoiding any commitment to being relevant. That
is, an ad ignorantiam does not get us out of ignorance, but it makes unapparent the
distinction between relevant information and irrelevant information (I will be back
to this problem in section 2.4.1 when dealing with the epistemic bubble introduced
in Chapter 1).
Relevancy avoidance is successfully performed, because it permits people to
make a decision no matter what they know. The recognition heuristic chosen by
the German group – just like in the case of ad ignorantiam – makes use of the
same pattern of reasoning: it takes the lack of recognition as probative. The implicit
passage in this case is as follows:
1. If I had known San Antonio, it would have been larger than San Diego.
2. But I do not know San Antonio.
3. Therefore, it is smaller than San Diego.
One important thing should be speciﬁed. The option generated by making use of our
ignorance is not like the one we would gain by ﬂipping a coin. It is certainly less
arbitrary and more sophisticated, because it is at least a spin, as Woods argued. In
fact, it permits us to make some guesswork possible. That is, we are not wholly in the
dark. In fact, as already mentioned, an ad ignorance permits us to unfold premissory
starting points, as they at least make a certain decision decidable or affordable.
Going back to our example, it is not true that John does not know anything.
For instance, he knows something about what he should know. So, he can easily
withdraw the hypothesis that he has not been informed because the head of the
department wrongly typed his email address, because she always sets a return receipt
option for such emails. She would let John know in the case she did not receive any
conﬁrmation from him. He could easily withdraw the second objection, because he
usually works from home. And, as for the third one, he could discard that as well,
because he has no problems at all with his colleagues.
The conclusion we are now arriving at is that an ad ignorantiam – belonging to
biased rationality – is a weaker cognitive strategy than the one relying on relevant
information.
2.4
The Vices of Biased Rationality
In the last section I discussed the idea of bounded rationality as biased rationality.
I made an explicit connection with the idea of homo heuristicus and his potentially
fallacious dimension. In this section I will illustrate the problem of biased rationality
going back to discuss fallacious reasoning with relation to the problem of relevancy.
The treatment of this issue will be a crucial cornerstone in the introduction of the
proposal to be developed in the following chapters.

36
2 Bounded Rationality as Biased Rationality: Virtues, Vices, and Assumptions
2.4.1
Competence-Dependent Information and
Competence-Independent Information
In Chapter 1 I looked in detail at number of fallacies identiﬁed as ignoratio elenchi
(or red herring). By deﬁnition this class of fallacies introduces irrelevant informa-
tion. The argumentum ad ignorance too can be classiﬁed as an ignoratio elenchi,
as I have just discussed. In section 1.2.4 I pointed out that irrelevancy is always a
relative matter, as it also depends on the communicative context a certain reasoning
is involved in. In this section I will try to make a step forward re-addressing the
matter within a broader framework. This would also allow us to go beyond biased
rationality (cf. section 2.5) and then to illustrate the concept of biased rationality as
cognitive ochlocracy in section 2.6.
My main contention is that ignoratio elenchi is a kind of argument based on
the introduction of what I call competence-independent information. An ignora-
tio elenchi is selected when a person does not have those competencies allowing
him/her to address the original issue for debate. This kind of strategy may tell us
something insightful about the nature of human decision-making and their cogni-
tive system.
Consider for example a problem which many people face during their holiday:
when to go swimming after eating. A doctor explains that there are several variables
which we should account for in order to decide when to go swimming after eating.
It depends on how much we eat, what we drink, the water temperature, whether we
swim hard or not. All this information is relevant when deciding what to do and
when to do it. Why is it relevant? It is relevant, because it would explain whether we
may get cramps or other problems related to digestion. For instance, a heavy meal
eaten just before swimming would make you feel sluggish and thus explain cramps.
As many people do not have the competencies a doctor has (or is supposed to
have), they often rely on other kinds of information. For instance, mom’s sugges-
tions or what the majority do. By deﬁnition, mom’s sayso or what the majority of
people do are all irrelevant information. In my example, this information is irrelevant
because it would not explain whether we may get cramps or not. More precisely, it is
irrelevant because it is not symptomatic: what other people decide does not explain
why a heavy meal affects our metabolism making us feel queasy.
The introduction and adoption of irrelevant information can be motivated by var-
ious reasoning. Indeed, it may be a strategy to divert audience attention and thus
challenge the original issue for debate (cf. section 1.2.4). Think for instance of how
often politicians attack their opponents personally, not their ideas or the opinions
they hold. However, as far as I am concerned here, I maintain that the introduction
of irrelevant information is primarily a cognitive strategy, which responds to the ne-
cessity of cognitive economy. More precisely, it is a strategy that is deployed in the
absence of competence regarding the matter in discussion. Thus, competence is con-
nected with relevancy: being competent with regards to a certain matter is what per-
mits employment of information which is relevant or, more precisely, symptomatic.
Focusing on competence so deﬁned may help us solve or, at least, explore some
open questions related to fallacy and biased rationality. First of all, what I argue

2.4 The Vices of Biased Rationality
37
is that the fallacious nature of biased rationality is concerned with the introduc-
tion of information that is not symptomatic to the conclusion that is drawn. Your
mom’s suggestions do not explain why you may have cramps or not; whereas what
you have eaten does. The distinction between the two kinds of information can
also be described in abductive terms: competence-dependent information are those
clues or signs “from which we can infer that a given fact must have been seen”
[Peirce, 1931–1958].3 In my view, irrelevancy is therefore an epistemological fea-
ture of fallacious reasoning and biased rationality and, above all, it characterizes
them. Since the information we provide is not symptomatic, it is always irrelevant.
It is not the case that it is sometimes relevant, sometimes irrelevant depending on
the context. This information is always irrelevant, because it is not symptomatic.
The question about competence and symptomaticity may also clarify the reason
why a fallacy or bias is a sometimes good, sometimes bad strategy. This was already
clearly recognized by Aristotle who extensively argued around the unapparent de-
fectiveness of fallacious reasoning. More precisely, the particular feature of fallacy
is that it appears to have a certain property, when it has not. This unapparent defec-
tiveness is connected with the fact that the information deployed in some fallacious
reasoning is not symptomatic. As already pointed out, fallacious reasoning does not
explain the reason why a certain event is such and such, and not as such as such.
However, even if fallacies are not symptomatic, they can lead us to solve the task
we are supposed to face, as already pointed out in the last section. Irrelevancy –
intended as not-symptomatic – is what we fail to be aware of, because in that case:
1. we do not have any other resources to deploy, and thus we would not make it;
2. symptomaticity is not a prerequisite for target attainment.
The ﬁrst point is concerned with the relativity of error we have already dealt with in
section 1.1.2. An argument turns out to be fallacious – and thus biased rationality –
with relation to a target which embeds a standard it fails to meet. This is basically
a conception of error, which is related to the selection of standards that overcomes
the agent’s capabilities and resources. Here, particular attention is given to the fact
that for beings-like-us some choices or decisions are to be made independently of
the resources or capabilities that one may or not have. This can be considered a
phenomenon of cognitive immunization. According to Gabbay and Woods [2005],
cognitive immunization is that kind of impediment from becoming aware of the
phenomenological structure of the epistemic bubble we are in (cf. section 1.1.1). By
deﬁnition being in an epistemic bubble makes phenomenologically unapparent the
distinction between knowing that p and believing to know that p.
In my view, the notion of cognitive immunization may be fruitfully extended to
the situation that prevents us from being (or becoming) aware that we would not
have those competencies allowing us to make it. More precisely, I argue that the
process of embubblement also regards the kind of information we use to solve prob-
lems so that in any epistemic bubble some information appears to be symptomatic,
although it is not. In the example illustrated above, we consider trusting mom’s ad-
vice or following the crowd as it could be symptomatic with digestion, but clearly it
3 The notion of abduction will be more extensively illustrated in section 4.3.

38
2 Bounded Rationality as Biased Rationality: Virtues, Vices, and Assumptions
is not. The cognitive immunization process permits us to sort out, and make use of
information that we already have, even though it is not relevant.
I claim that the process of embubblement is, indeed, essential to the deployment
of biased rationality as an adaptive tool. In fact, the importance of having such a
mechanism of immunization rests on the mandatory character of certain decisions,
which have a direct or indirect connection to our survival and reproduction. The
example introduced above shows how we can solve a task without having any of
those competencies required to make a sound judgment. We simply rely on forms
of reasoning which provide information that are not dependent on any particular
competence. In sum:
• it is some kind of easy-to-deploy or default reasoning. Since it does not require
particular knowledge or competence, it is a kind of default reasoning as it is
easily available to everybody;
• it allows us to avoid irrelevancy. No matter if it introduces irrelevant information
or not, it may allow us to accomplish the task we have to face trapping us in an
epistemic bubble. This particular feature also permits us to escape from ignorance
by avoiding relevancy, as we have pointed out the previous section;
• it is domain-independent; since it is not based on particular body of knowledge,
it can be employed with regards to a number of different issues. For instance, I
can trust my mother and take her advice, whether it is about how to dress, how to
eat, the university to go to, the job to choose and so on. In the same way, we can
follow the reasoning of the crowd in choosing what to buy, the restaurant which
to go to, etc.;
• it is resource-saving or acognitive thirst quencher. It does not base its attractive-
ness or appeal on the fact that it provides additional resources to solve a problem.
Quite the contrary, it bases its appeal on quenching our thirst for information and
cognitive resources.
This last point is clearly captured by the principle of knowledge debased introduced
by Woods who wrote:
Since we survive and prosper and sometimes build great civilizations in the absence of
knowledge, that is to say, under conditions of widespread ignorance, knowledge is of
no essential value to these achievements. [Woods, 2009]
2.4.2
Having Poor Information and Having No Information at
All
It is worth noting that limits have more to do with competence-dependent infor-
mation than competence-independent information. Since the latter is not strictly
symptomatic about whether a certain situation is going to happen or not, we are not
expected to modify it to enhance our performance. This is the problem of bounded
rationality as biased rationality.
The strategies based on competence-dependent information acquire an adap-
tive value, as they supply cognitive resources that are much more reliable than the

2.5 Appealing to Knowledge: De-biasing Rationality
39
ones based on competence-independentinformation. For instance, in the experiment
about which city is larger between San Diego and San Antonio, it is most likely that
an American expert in urban studies would not rely on recognition heuristics. More
generally, experts tend to be de-biased, so to say. This is so, because knowledge
– and consequently the strategies based on it – is an increasingly reliable means
for solving problems the more abundantit becomes. This is basically derived from
the fact that knowledge is resource-consuming, whereas fallacies and biases are
resource-saving. Strictly speaking, they are not corrigible, because they are opti-
mized and ready to do their job. In this sense, arguments leaning on competence-
independent information are neither corrigible nor enhancing.
This last contention is connected with a point introduced in the previous section,
namely that fallacies and biases are somehow easy to dismiss. For instance, when
people say that someone is biased or that an argument is fallacious they do not really
mean that the person is mistaken or that the line of argument is wrong or false. For
example, when during a debate or discussion a person claims that the opponent is
diverting audience attention by performing a personal attack, they are not claiming
that what their opponent argues is right or wrong. That would be a fallacy, namely,
the so-called argument from fallacy. Instead, they are merely pointing to a ﬂaw
in their opponent’s reasoning, which might eventually lead to a bad decision or
outcome, if followed.
So, being fallacious or biased renders an argument easy to dismiss. That one can
be easily dismissed is not to be intended as a logical derivation. However weak or
easy to dismiss an argument or bias is, it may allow a person to reach his target, as
already maintained. Conversely, it describes a communicative move. For example,
the simplest case of an ad hominem could help us make a decision which may even-
tually be a good decision. Sometimes a person who has, for instance, a conﬂict of
interest may be biased in holding certain positions. Therefore, knowing that he has
a conﬂict of interest is not irrelevant at all.
More generally, my point is that irrelevance is a communicative feature. Irrele-
vance simply warns us that a certain piece of information may support an easy-to-
dismiss point. Therefore, it prompts us to change or adjust our argument in order to
acquire a better chance to succeed in a given discussion.
2.5
Appealing to Knowledge: De-biasing Rationality
So far I have discussed the fact that bounded rationality as biased rationality is in-
deed a survival strategy, however ill-grounded it may be from a more sophisticated
perspective, namely, an intellectual one. The fact that we recognize some arguments
or strategies as easy-to-dismiss simply means that we could have some better ar-
guments and strategies at our disposal do we really have some better strategies or
arguments? And what happens if we continue to use easy-to-dismiss strategies, even
when they are not the only solution available? The following will attempt to set the
stage for a possible answer to the ﬁrst question. Basically, I will argue that it is not
necessary to reject the idea of bounded rationality to dismiss that of biased rational-
ity. Whereas in section 2.6 I will provide an answer to the second question. More

40
2 Bounded Rationality as Biased Rationality: Virtues, Vices, and Assumptions
precisely, I will illustrate when biased rationality may lead to what I call “cognitive
ochlocracy” as a detrimental form of cognitive resource management.
2.5.1
Plastic Behaviors and the Lens Model
As already pointed out, fallacies and heuristics make some decisions affordable for
us, even though they do not resort to symptomatic information. This is due to the
fact that biased rationality, as a set of fallacies and heuristics for decision-making,
turns our ignorance into a cognitive virtue generating premissory starting points.
So far so good. However, we do not overcome our ignorance, as we come up with
premises that are not symptomatic or, at least, ambiguous. We overcome ignorance
by establishing procedures that deliver information or resources that are somehow
relevant or not biased. This can only happen by building up external structures that
provide us with clues or information that are more symptomatic than the ones we
previously had. So, I introduce an eco-cognitive element, which will be the cor-
nerstone of the argument I will develop in the next chapter introducing the idea of
de-biasing rationality as distributing cognition.
Human beings owe their ecological dominance to their ability to display ad-
vanced plastic behaviors. In turn, the possibility to display advanced plastic
behaviors is closely related to having a second, non genetic, source of information,
which upon occasion can deliver the proper resources to solve problems and help
make decisions. Ultimately the ability to turn available raw materials into cognitive
resources to support plastic responses is central to human success. The lens model
theory introduced by Egon Brunswik [1952; 1955; 1943] sheds some light on the
dark side of biased rationality.
According to Brunswik, the relationship between the organism and the environ-
ment is deﬁned by what he called “the lens model”. The lens model is based on the
idea that the relationship between the organism and the environment is mediated by
the use of the so-called proximal stimuli, from which the organism can infer the dis-
tal state of the environment, which brought it about. Ecological validity is the term
introduced by Brunswik to refer to the situation in which a given proximal stimulus
acts as a valuable indicator of a certain distal state or event; ecological validity is a
normative measure about how diagnostic certain proximal stimuli are with respect
to a given distal event [Vicente, 2003].
The main idea behind Brunswik’s lens model is that it provides an alternative way
to look into the questions related to domain-independent versus domain-speciﬁc
approaches popularized by evolutionary psychology. His main contribution to this
issue is to distinguish between the cognitive process of a certain activity and its
content. He pointed out that the cognitive process of inferring a distal state of the
environment from the proximal stimuli we received is domain-independent. Con-
versely, what is domain-dependent are those indicators or local representatives we
make use of in order to infer distal states of the environment. For the indicator
content is left unspeciﬁed.
In the light of Brunswik’s lens model, adaptation (and thus the possibility of
survival and reproduction) is the degree to which an organism attains a stable

2.5 Appealing to Knowledge: De-biasing Rationality
41
relationship with the external world [Kirlik, 2001, p. 238]. In other words, achieving
a stable relationship with the external world depends on developing prepared asso-
ciations between a proximal stimulus and the corresponding distant event. Within
this framework, plasticity is deﬁned as that ability to change or adjust a pre-wired
response according to the environment so as to increase the chance of a match be-
tween proximal stimuli and the distant state in an ever-changing environment.
As far as I am concerned here, plasticity can be deﬁned as the ability to make
use of those signs or clues that are more symptomatic of a certain event or situation
than others. Ultimately, plasticity deals with the development of the abductive skills,
which allow us to detect clues and use them as indicators or local representatives
of a distant event. In turn, these abductive skills basically rely on knowledge and
competence.4 The crucial point for exploiting cognitive plasticity is to detect – and
sometimes even create – various indicators speciﬁc to certain domains and not others
in order to increase our chances of making successful inferences and judgments
[Hammond and Steward, 2001].
This last contention leads us to consider cognitive strategies leaning on
competence-independent information as ill-grounded for a long-term strategy inso-
far as it employs resources that by deﬁnition are not symptomatic. In Brunswikian
terms, we may argue that the ecological validity of competence-independent infor-
mation is quite poor, because it uses indicators that are not speciﬁc to a particular
domain. Independence from a speciﬁc domain of application turns out to be the ma-
jor limitation in this case. Mom’s suggestions or following what the majority think
are clues that cannot however be taken as reliable indicators or proximal stimuli of
speciﬁc distal events.
2.5.2
Competence-Dependent Information Is Ecologically
Delivered
In the previous discussion, I argued that some problems related to reproduction and
survival are mandatory. One cannot cast them off, because that would impede repro-
duction and/or survival. Roughly speaking, under such conditions, giving an answer
— even at random – is as good as giving the right answer. I posit that the virtue of
strategies based on competence-independent information can only be conditional.
That is, the use of competence-independent information in the situation where we
have no information at all is “good”, whereas being in that situation is not.
If so, one might expect that evolution would have provided human beings with
a mechanism to escape from such conditions of having no information at all. My
contention is that such a mechanism is not provided at an individual level, but at
the eco-cognitive one. The strategies based on competence-dependent information
are adaptive as far as knowledge can persist and be accumulated and transmitted
from generation to generation via the cognitive niche.5 As already pointed out, when
4 I will be dealing with this point more in detail in section 4.3.
5 The notion of the cognitive niche will be illustrated in section 3.3.

42
2 Bounded Rationality as Biased Rationality: Virtues, Vices, and Assumptions
knowledge is easily available, strategies based on competence may become domi-
nant: easily available cognitive niches make abundance of knowledge possible.
As I will point out in the next chapter, individual agents spend part of their
time tending to enhancement of cognitive assets if this makes the achievement of
cognitive goals possible where they were previously unaffordable or unattainable
[Magnani, 2007a]. My claim is that this can only happen at the eco-cognitive level.
Basically, a cognitive niche provides humans with an additional source of informa-
tion storage and computational abilities, which support and even boost the capacity
of exhibiting an increasingly ﬂexible, adaptive response to an ever-changing envi-
ronment. These extra-genetic materials, properly exploited by ontogenetic mecha-
nisms like learning, provide the unique framework for re-adjusting and reﬁning our
cognitive assets also as individual agents.
2.6
When Biased Rationality Is Cognitive Ochlocracy
Mom’s suggestions or what the majority thinks do not entirely lose their appeal.
In Brunswikian terms, domain-independent indicators are replaced by domain-
dependent ones, but this replacement is not permanent, since the resources which
are ecologically delivered via the cognitive niche do not rely on any genetic mech-
anism granting their persistence inter- or intra-generation. Cognitive niches may
be exposed to a process of impoverishment, since their maintenance is not secured
by some genetic mechanism; conversely, it is administered by human communities
and societies, and thus wide open even to the most dramatic changes (cf. section
3.5). The modiﬁcations brought about by cognitive niche construction are always
reversible and they can also disappear in a relatively short space of time.
2.6.1
The Case of the Bandwagon
In this subsection my aim is to describe how the so-called bandwagon effect may
cause a cognitive niche to be impoverished. The product of an ad populum (cf. sec-
tion 1.2.3), the bandwagon effect is that process in which a person follows what
the majority of people does [Leibenstein, 1950]. Generally speaking, popularity is
a kind of competence surrogate. It is a competence (or knowledge) surrogate, be-
cause it does not require a learning process which is usually the only means by
which competence might eventually be acquired. However, as brilliantly put it by
Sunstein “conformity is often a rational course of action, but when all or most of us
conform, society can end up making large mistakes” [Sunstein, 2005a, p. 3]. This
is my starting point for asking some questions: what happens when the probability
that a person chooses what other people choose increases? What are the cognitive
consequences of that situation?
As already pointed out in subsection 2.5.1, plasticity is the ability of exploiting
those signs that are more symptomatic than others of a certain situation we have to
cope with. Indeed, this ability is enhanced by having a second non-genetic inher-
itance system, by which successful solutions can be transmitted and accumulated

2.6 When Biased Rationality Is Cognitive Ochlocracy
43
leading to better adaptation. This allows people to have access to a great variety of
information and resources resulting from the activity of previous generations. My
contention is that the bandwagon effect constitutes a major factor in cognitive niche
impoverishment, because it slows down, or even interrupts, the accumulation and
transmission of knowledge. Investigating citation behavior in science may be a case
in point when illustrating this contention.
During the last thirty years a number of contributions about why and how authors
cite each others’ work has appeared [Bornmann and Daniel, 2006]. Such contribu-
tions have developed an alternative approach to sociology of science [Small, 2004;
Van der Veer Martens and Goodrum, 2006] taking advantage of the introduction of
powerful tracking tools able to store and retrieve upon request a huge amount
of data. For citation analysis has now become a widespread methodology, which
is a fundamental means for extracting meaningful patterns from various citation-
databases. Indeed, there are a number of issues concerning the scientiﬁc reliability
of citation analysis, but as far as I am concerned here, such data and results are
merely exploratory rather than validating.
An interesting case to mention is given in Anderson [Anderson, 2006]. Anderson
investigated the inﬂuence that a book, The Social Psychology of Organizing by Karl
Weick, has had during the last thirty years on a number of disciplines including
social psychology, management, and organizational behavior. Using a methodology
called context citation analysis, Anderson reported empirical evidence regarding
the fact that authors citing Organizing appear to be “willing to accept concepts in
Organizing without empirical conﬁrmation” (p. 1687).
This appears to contradict the commonly accepted view according to which
science is built on organized skepticism [Merton, 1996]. In my view, the ex-
ample I documented is simply due to the bandwagon effect. That is, scholars
often cite documents merely because they see them cited by others. As a result,
most of these citations may reasonably be considered as perfunctory or ceremo-
nial citations rather than meaningful, as they usually appear in introductory sections
[Case and Higgins, 2000]. On some occasions, authors may not even read the ma-
terials they cite, but often they merely copy them from a third source (cf. with “the
Matthew Effect” in section 1.2.1).
2.6.2
The Two Main Consequences of Cognitive Ochlocracy
I maintain that the bandwagon effect can be broken down into to two main sub-
effects. First of all, as time passes, some concepts and theories simply go unques-
tioned and unchecked. Secondly, due their fame, certain concepts or ideas actually
become less well known, in detail, than one might imagine, notwithstanding their
popularity.
On the ﬁrst point, the bandwagon effect makes people suppress any private infor-
mation as they conform to what the majority thinks [Sunstein, 2005a]. A scientist,
for instance, may opt to support a particular theory, although he may have good
reason not to, just because his community strongly supports it. He may deliberately
choose to reject as erroneous the results he got from an experiment, because they

44
2 Bounded Rationality as Biased Rationality: Virtues, Vices, and Assumptions
do not conform to the view held by the majority of his colleagues. Indeed, lacking
conﬁdence may promote conformity, but, as the bandwagon effect becomes more
inﬂuential, the price one has to pay for dissent may be very high.
This phenomenon may be considered as a kind reverse epistemic bubble – so
to speak. I have already treated the problem of embubblement in section 2.4.1. By
deﬁnition in an epistemic bubble, a person believes she knows P, when she does
not. In a reverse epistemic bubble it happens quite the contrary:
an agent A believes she does not know P, when she does know P.
We are still in the presence of an embubblement process, since the difference be-
tween believing and knowing is apparently suppressed. However, in this case the
suppression is somehow reversed, that is, it is about something that we would know.
The effect of conformity is a fair example of this kind as the bandwagon effect
may cause a person not to trust the information or knowledge she has. When the
bandwagon effect is particularly strong, then reverse embubblement can easily take
place. Fear or low level self-esteem may indeed boost it [Klucharev et al., 2009].
Adhering to a certain view for group cohesion turns out to be damaging for the
group itself, since in the long run it impairs group performance. This appears to
be a paradox, but it is not. As people follow the so-called “wisdom of the crowd”,
the bandwagon has the cognitive effect of diminishing the total level of informa-
tion available to the group [Sunstein, 2005b; Sunstein, 2007]. If at an individual
level conformity allows people to make a decision when lacking competence and
knowledge, at a group level this could be catastrophic especially when facing change
and/or difﬁculties.
Most of what we think or believe results from second-hand knowledge. As a
matter of fact, we try to learn from other people due to the exceedingly high cost
of individual learning. Following the crowd would appear to be pro-social behavior
underlying or even promoting such an activity like learning. However, even if the
bandwagon effect certainly has a pro-social component, it cannot be smuggled in as
a tendency enhancing any process of social learning. It is quite the contrary, as the
bandwagon effect reduces the total level of information available within a group or
a community and it drastically weakens social learning, increasing the cost related
to individual learning. Conformity enhances the probability that a given behavior or
trait will become common in a group or population [Efferson et al., 2008]. In doing
so, it reduces eco-cognitive variation within a group and consequently makes learn-
ing by imitation less proﬁtable. In fact, as reported by Castro et al. [2004] imitators
“do poorly when they are common and individual learners are rare”.
Conformity also impedes creativity, because dissent may be of great value when
innovation is required to adapt to new situations for which established and popular
solutions are no longer useful. As a matter of fact, popularity makes people con-
form to certain cultural variants rather than others. However, in the case of strong
discontinuity with the past, the attitude of conforming to what other people think is
strongly maladaptive insofar as it stiﬂes dissent, which innovative and creative so-
lutions very often come from. In fact, innovation requires tempting alternative ways

2.6 When Biased Rationality Is Cognitive Ochlocracy
45
of thinking, which, however, can be impaired by an overwhelming conformity in
promoting or just passing on what is already known.
There is another major consequence due to the bandwagon effect, which is worth
discussing. As already mentioned in analyzing citation behavior, authors often cite
well-established ideas or concepts just because they are popular. They are called
ceremonial citations. However, as an idea or concept becomes popular, it is more
likely to go unchecked, and debate over it dies down. This may promote a kind
of obliteration-inducing process according to which the more a concept becomes
popular, the less it is really known and understood.
This contention is indeed highly hypothetical, since it is hard to assess whether or
not a scholar does understand what he cited. This phenomenon may drastically vary
in breadth depending on the matter at discussion, whether it is a piece of science,
art, philosophy, or religion. However, it is common to ﬁnd contributions in science
as well as in other disciplines which explicitly address the problem of getting back
to basics as if the original concepts and/or ideas were lost.
In abductive terms, this obliteration-inducing process can be deﬁned as premise
obliterating. Peirce brilliantly noted that, as we get familiar with certain reasoning, a
habit is established so that we tend “to obliterate all recognition of the uninteresting
and complex premises from which it [a conclusion] was derived”. 6 I argue popu-
larity is a major factor producing another kind of premises obliteration. Popularity
produces premises obliteration, not because premises are processed almost uncon-
sciously, as for instance in the case of visual perception, but because premises like
symptomatic signs are not processed at all. This process obliterates all the symp-
tomatic and relevant knowledge required for making a sound judgment. As if the
adoption of a certain conclusion results from the bandwagon effect, then all the
relevant and appropriate reasons for accepting it are excluded from the decision
process.
Ultimately, the bandwagon effect deals with the adoption of a certain cultural
variant regardless of its content, as the only reason which really counts is that ev-
erybody is doing it. In this sense, popularity is a very poor means of cultural trans-
mission, since it just echoes an idea.7 As Castro et al. [2004] argued, one of the
key elements enabling eco-cognitive transmission is the capacity to approve and
disapprove. This capacity underlies any process of learning, making imitation more
reliable and accurate, because imitation is somehow driven by categorizing “one’s
own and others’ behavior in terms of values – positive or negative, good or bad”
[Castro et al., 2004, p. 727]. This capacity, for instance, helps people avoid the costs
related to trial-and-error learning. More generally, it is fundamental in causing some
ideas to persist instead of others, and thus transforming an imitation system into a
6 Magnani [2009] describes this process as underlying visual perception and other related
forms. See also the semi-encapsulated nature of affordance detection that I will describe
in section 4.4.
7 Sunstein [2005b] developed this idea referring to the notion of “echo chamber”. He bril-
liantly argued that echo chambers do not represent any model of information transmis-
sion or aggregation, but they simply lead to wild errors, undue conﬁdence, and group
polarization.

46

cumulative one. Popularity is neither good or bad in itself, since it delivers a way of
assessing ideas or behavior, which does not generate a system of evaluation based on
competence, but it is based on exaggerating “existing biases in individual decision-
making” [Efferson et al., 2008, p. 57].
To sum up, the most negative aspects of the bandwagon effect are:
• it is an impediment to further development, impairing the creative process;
• the majority of people tend to direct their effort towards a single topic (popularity
of the topic);
• dissent is stiﬂed, and the cost associated with dissenting dramatically increases
as the bandwagon effect grows in strength;
• conformity reduces the possibility of social learning making imitation less prof-
itable;
• popular ideas are increasingly taken on face value and remain unproved by those
new to them, since popularity replaces other forms of control and evaluation;
• as an idea increases in popularity, it becomes less well known.
This eco-cognitive impoverishment is clearly captured by the distinction between
competence-dependent information and competence-independent information that I
have already introduced. As we switch from the former to the latter, we immediately
lose the chance to lean on resources that are based on knowledge and competence
and thus more reliable to get the job done.

Concluding Remarks
In this chapter I have illustrated how the notion of biased rationality is a develop-
ment of the idea of bounded rationality. I have presented its virtues but also its vices.
I have brieﬂy introduced the argument on de-biasing rationality. In the next chapter
I will be dealing with the notion of the cognitive niche. I will show how cognitive
niches play a crucial role in moving the bounds of rationality. Basically, I will point
out that, even though we are still bounded, our cognition can be extended and, inso-
far as we construct ever more sophisticated cognitive niches, we have the chance to
de-bias our rationality and cognition.

Chapter 3
Moving the Bonds: Distributing Cognition
through Cognitive Niche Construction
Introduction
In the previous Chapter I discussed the virtues and vices of bounded rationality
as biased rationality. Basically, I pointed out that biases and fallacies can be use-
ful insofar as one lacks symptomatic information to make a decision. In this sense,
rationality, and human cognition, is always bounded, meaning that we are always
committed to cognitive economy. However, rationality and our cognition can also be
de-biased. On this point, I have argued that one way of de-biasing human cognition
is to extend it. What does this mean? This means that humans improve the qual-
ity of their decisions and results by means of building up eco-cognitive structures
that deliver more symptomatic information. The present chapter is mainly devoted
to exploring in detail the distributed dimension of cognition. Human beings over-
come their limitations by distributing and securing cognitive functions within their
environment. This process does not lead to a complete de-bounding of the human
cognitive system, rather, it contributes to pushing the bounds of cognition.
In section 3.1, I shall set the scene for the rest of the chapter illustrating the cog-
nitive relevance of what it is called the externalization process. Basically, human
beings overcome their internal limitations by (1) disembodying thoughts and then
(2) re-projecting internally that occurring outside to ﬁnd new ways of thinking. Ac-
counts of distributed cognition seem to have overlooked this process placing more
attention upon the ﬁrst half. Conversely, in this section I shall see how it is the in-
terplay between the organism and its environment that is responsible for moving the
bounds of cognition.
This will allow us to introduce the concept of cognition as a chance-seeking sys-
tem. Chance-seeking is an important part of de-biasing rationality as in extending
their cognition human beings do not actually hold a complete representation of their
environment, but they simply make use of anchors, which are literally picked up
upon occasion for solving problems. Thus, in this respect, human cognitive behavior
consists in acting upon those anchors which we ourselves have secured a cognitive
function to.

3 Moving the Bonds: Distributing Cognition through Cognitive Niche Construction
The idea of humans as agents seeking chances will be developed in section 3.2.
In that section, I will introduce the idea of distributed cognition and I will illustrate
the extended model of rationality. The model will be presented by comparing it with
the other models of rationality treated in Chapter 2.
The activity of chance seeking is developed in sections 3.3 and 3.4 within an evo-
lutionary framework based on niche construction. In my view, the theory of niche
construction is the best theory for dealing with the evolutionary aspects of knowl-
edge. Extending this theory from the biological domain to the cognitive one, I will
show how the cognitive asset enhancement I talked about in section 2.5.1 is made
possible at the eco-cognitive level. Basically, a cognitive niche provides humans
with an additional source of information storage and computational abilities, which
support and even boost the capacity of exhibiting ever more ﬂexible adaptive re-
sponses to an ever-changing environment. These extra-genetic materials, properly
exploited by ontogenetic mechanisms like learning, provide the unique framework
for re-adjusting and reﬁning our cognitive assets.
In section 3.5, I will illustrate how the approach based on niche construction can
fruitfully account for some phenomena related to the so-called group selection. My
take will be that groups enter the evolutionary scene as far as they allow cognitive
niches to persist. As to this issue, I will introduce the notion of cognitive niche
maintenance as underlying some of the activities, which are responsible for the per-
sistence of ecologically delivered non-genetic information.
3.1
Humans as Chance Seekers
3.1.1
Incomplete Information and Chance-Seeking
Humans usually make decisions and solve problems relying on incomplete informa-
tion [Simon, 1955]. Having incomplete information means that 1) our deliberations
and decisions are never the best possible answer, but they are at least satisﬁcing; 2)
our conclusions are always withdrawable (i.e. questionable, or never ﬁnal). That is,
once we get more information about a certain situation we can always revise our
previous decisions and think of alternative pathways that we could not “see” be-
fore; 3) a great part of our job is devoted to elaborating conjectures or hypotheses
in order to obtain more adequate information. Making conjectures is essentially an
act that in most cases consists in manipulating our problem, and the representation
we have of it, so that we may eventually acquire/create more “valuable” knowledge
resources. Conjectures can be either the fruit of an abductive selection in a set of
pre-stored hypotheses or the creation of new ones, like in scientiﬁc discovery (see
section 4.3). To make conjectures humans often need more evidence/data: in many
cases this further cognitive action is the only way to simply make possible (or at
least enhance) a thought to “hypotheses” which are hard to successfully produce.
Consider, for instance, diagnostic settings: often the information available does
not allow a physician to make a precise diagnosis. Therefore, he/she has to perform
additional tests, or even try some different treatments to uncover symptoms other-
wise hidden. In doing so he/she is simply aiming at increasing the chances of making

3.1 Humans as Chance Seekers
49
the appropriate decision. There are plenty of situations of that kind. For example,
scientists are continuously engaged in a process of manipulating their research set-
tings in order to get more valuable information, as illustrated by Magnani [2001].
Most of this work is completely tacit and embodied in practice. The role of various
laboratory artifacts is a clear example, but also in everyday life people daily face
complex situations which require knowledge and manipulative expertise of various
kinds no matter who they are, whether teachers, policy makers, politicians, judges,
workers, students, or simply wives, husbands, friends, sons, daughters, and so on.
In this sense, humans can be considered chance seekers, because they are continu-
ously engaged in a process of building up and then extracting latent possibilities to
uncover new valuable information and knowledge.
The line of thought I will try to develop in the course of this chapter is the fol-
lowing: as chance seekers, humans are ecological engineers. That is: humans like
other creatures do not simply live their environment, but they actively shape and
change it looking for suitable chances. In doing so, they construct cognitive niches
[Tooby and DeVore, 1987; Pinker, 2003] through which the offerings provided by
the environment in terms of cognitive possibilities are appropriately selected and/or
manufactured to enhance their ﬁtness as chance seekers. Hence, this ecological ap-
proach aims at understanding cognitive systems in terms of their environmental sit-
uatedness [Clancey, 1997; Magnani, 2005]. Within this framework, a chance is that
“information” which is not stored internally in memory or already available in an
external reserve but that has to be “extracted” and then picked up upon occasion.
Related to this perspective is also the so-called Perceptual Activity Theory (PA)
[Ellis, 1995; Ramachandran and Hirstein, 1997]. What these studies suggest is that
an observer actively selects the perceptual information it needs to control its be-
havior in the world [Thomas, 1999]. In this sense, we do not store descriptions of
pictures, objects or scenes we perceive in a static way: we continuously adjust and
reﬁne our perspective through further perceptual exploration that allows us to get
a more detailed understanding. As Thomas [1999] put it, “PA theory, like active
vision robotics, views it [perception] as a continual process of active interrogation
of the environment”. As I will show in the following sections “the active interroga-
tion of the environment” is also at the root of the evolution of our organism and its
cognitive system.
3.1.2
The Externalization Process
In the previous chapter, I claimed that human cognitive performances cannot be
regarded as activities brought about solely by the isolated brain. In contrast, as al-
ready mentioned, humans lean on external objects. However, it is worth noting that
this dependence is not a passive process, but it is active. In other terms, cogni-
tive systems are not affected by external “inputs” that set the right conﬁguration
of our brain. Look, for example, at the case of language. Language, as an artifact,
allows people to capture events in words [Donald, 2001; Harris, 2004; Love, 2004;
Menary, 2007]. Consider, for instance, what our consciousness or our thought ca-
pacity would be without it. As a matter of fact, talking about things or, better, writing

50
3 Moving the Bonds: Distributing Cognition through Cognitive Niche Construction
about them dramatically improves the quality of our thoughts. I argue that the action
of writing allows humans to reach at least two advancements: (a) people can exter-
nally reproduce something that they have only within the isolated brain and make
it more visible; (b) once they have externalized their thoughts in external objects,
people can work on them and develop new concepts and new ways of thinking.
I call the entire cycle the “externalization process,” and it can be summarized as
follows: human beings overcome their internal limitations by (1) externalizing and
disembodying thoughts, ideas, solutions, and then (2) re-projecting internally that
occurring outside in the external invented structure to ﬁnd new ways of thinking.
It is worth noting that during the externalization process individuals create some-
thing that exists without their brain too; that renders the structure invented (an arti-
fact or a tool) eventually useful to other individuals. Therefore, the externalization
process constitutes the basis for social interactions.
As shown above, the externalization process allows us to make thoughts, ideas,
etc. more visible. I call this process mimetic, because individuals use external sup-
ports to reproduce what occurs inside their private consciousness [Magnani, 2006b].
This is a very common experience for human beings. For example, writing is a
mimetic activity, because we represent and reproduce thoughts, ideas, etc., in an-
other means (the sheet of paper). Besides, the process of externalization makes it
possible to use external objects, and the environment in general, as information stor-
ages that people can take advantage of in many ways [Mithen, 1996; Mithen, 1999;
Donald, 2001]. Therefore, the activities of externalizing are mimetic, because
humans try to reproduce (private) thoughts, feelings, ideas, and so on, in external
objects that become information stores.
The example of writing is interesting in another respect to that I mentioned
above. Once our thoughts have been secured to an external support (the sheet
of paper), we are able to think and operate on them in a way that would not
otherwise be possible. As a matter of fact, we cannot re-read our thoughts, be-
cause they are ﬂeeting and immediately fade away. But, once written, we can
use the sheet of paper as a cognitive and epistemic mediator [Hutchins, 1995;
Magnani, 2001] and perform some cognitive activities otherwise impossible. More
precisely, external supports allow individuals to re-project their own thoughts so
that they can uncover hidden information and concepts. In this sense, external
objects do not simply help to accomplish some cognitive activities – serving as cog-
nitive mediators, but they allow us to ﬁnd room for new ones. Thus, the activities
of re-projecting are creative: external supports function as cognitive and epistemic
mediators that ﬁnd room for concepts and new ways of inferring which cannot be
found internally (“in the mind”).
Both mimetic and re-projecting activities organize human brains: more precisely,
they make new conﬁgurations of neural networks and chemical process possi-
ble [Magnani, 2006a]. In neurological terms, novel experiences strengthen some
synapses, weaken others, and they create new pathways amongst some sets of
interneurons [Rose, 2005, p.160].

3.2 Bounds Moved: From Bounded to Distributed Cognition
51
3.2
Bounds Moved: From Bounded to Distributed Cognition
The line of thought I am trying to pursue, leads us to point to a few relevant fea-
tures of the original model of bounded rationality I have described in Chapter 2. In
synthesis, the major claims are that bounded rationality
1. relies on computational capabilities only,
2. establishes a computational procedure to reach satisﬁcing results,
3. doesn’t recognize the role of internal and external variables not directly con-
nected to computation.
These points make the model out to be a static one. In order to avoid these problems
in understanding and describing human behavior, I present a model of rationality
based on recent theories of distributed cognition. The starting point is the recogni-
tion of the role played by internal and external resources in human cognition.
3.2.1
Internal and External Resources
Some of the critiques on the original bounded rationality model refer to the
dichotomy between environmental and internal resources. The two spheres
can be thought of as internal and external constraints to bounded rationality
[Todd and Gigerenzer, 2003]. They insist on the fact that “there is another possibil-
ity regarding the bounds, external and internal, that surround our rationality: rather
than being separate and unrelated, the two sets of bounds may be intimately linked”
[Todd and Gigerenzer, 2003, p. 144].
The merger confers dynamism to the original BRM, as “the internal bounds com-
prising the capacities of the cognitive system can be shaped, for instance by evolu-
tion or development, to take advantage of the structure of the external environment”
[Todd and Gigerenzer, 2003, p. 144]. That is to say that the two “bounds” are strictly
interconnected, as the external ones modify (or “shape”, as they put it) the internal
ones. Thus, bounded rationality is the “positive outcome of the two types of bounds
ﬁtting together. In other words, humans exhibit ecological rationality, making good
decisions with mental mechanisms whose internal structure can exploit the external
information structures available in the environment” [Todd and Gigerenzer, 2003,
p. 144].
Todd and Gigerenzer’s intuition is very original and is developed through a so-
called “ecological rationality research program.” It consists in deﬁning heuristics –
i.e. the way individuals gather and process data related to a speciﬁc problem – that
match speciﬁc scenarios [Todd and Gigerenzer, 2003, p. 148]. Selected heuristics
are very simple, and the Authors’ thesis shows how effective behavior can also be
explained by “fast and frugal” mechanisms. Following this framework, they ﬁnd that
“there are cases where cognitive limitations actually seem to be beneﬁcial, enabling
new functions that would be absent without them, rather than constraining possible
behaviors of the system” [Todd and Gigerenzer, 2003, p. 160].
The merger between the external and internal resources leads to a new model
where human bounded rationality “ﬁlters” the external variables and shapes its

52
3 Moving the Bonds: Distributing Cognition through Cognitive Niche Construction
boundaries. However, this fundamental aspect is not integrated in the research pro-
gram where schemes of heuristics remain ﬁxed, and rationality concerns the choos-
ing of a preferred scheme in relation to a given environmental context. If so, where
is cognitive re-shaping located? And, what kind of restructuring are we facing?
Moreover, what is the real impact of external resources on rationality? If external
resources re-shape the cognitive system, can we think of it as mechanism where
bounds are constantly moving?
3.2.2
The Role of External Representations
Recent research in cognitive science underlines the role of external resources in
understanding how human cognition works.1
As a matter of fact, people constantly and heavily lean on external supports,
and the quality of their performance would immediately drop down without them
[Clark and Chalmers, 1998]. Humans constantly delegate cognitive functions to the
environment: remembering and calculating, for instance, are heavily supported
by the environment [Norman, 1999b]. Very simple artifacts, such as pen and pa-
per allow us to accomplish tasks that otherwise we couldn’t even think about
[Donald, 2001]. And so forth.
All these external objects are not mere “approximating mechanisms” or sup-
ports, but they play a crucial role in extending the rationality of human behavior and
decision-making. Bounded rationality theory, and its groundwork, fails to recognize
the cognitive role exhibited by external objects. More precisely, since bounded ratio-
nality focuses only upon what goes on within the individual mind, it fails to account
for the fact that external computational resources extend the rational capabilities of
humans. Thus, I may claim that rationality is un-bounded from the conﬁnes of the
limited individual brain by the exploitation of external resources.
In order to make this point, I shall deal with the concept of external representa-
tions. More precisely, we need to show how external resources play a crucial cogni-
tive role in extending the rational character of human decision-making; they encode
computational resources that can be fruitfully exploited by humans to overcome
their cognitive limits.
Generally speaking, a problem can be deﬁned through an “initial state”, a “goal
state”, and a “set of operators” (or mediators) that allow transformation of the ini-
tial state into the goal state by a series of intermediate steps. It is worth noting that
the standard approach to decision making is not far from this representation. The

Salomon, 1993; Hutchins, 1995; Clark, 1997; Kirsh, 1999; Donald, 2001; Wilson, 2004;
Clark, 2008; Rupert, 2010]. On the role of distributed cognition in science, see the
concept of construal [Gooding, 1994], and that of epistemic mediator [Magnani, 2001].
For a general account of the moral role played by external resources, see the con-
cept of moral mediator [Magnani, 2007c]. For a distributed cognition approach

Hollan et al., 2000;
Susi and Ziemke, 2001;
Calvi and Magnani, 2002;
Kirsh, 2004;
Perry, 2003; Magnani and Bardone, 2006].

3.2 Bounds Moved: From Bounded to Distributed Cognition
53
intermediate steps, that I will call hereafter “actions”, can be grouped into two main
categories: pragmatic and epistemic [Kirsh and Maglio, 1994]. By the term prag-
matic actions I refer to all those intermediate steps that alter the world to achieve
some physical goal or other physical intermediate stages. For example, if one has
to be refunded for a certain purchase, he has to fax the receipt. The action of fax-
ing the document is a pragmatic action because it brings one closer to the goal state,
namely, being refunded. In contrast, “epistemic actions” are all those actions that al-
ter the representation of the task one is facing. A child that shakes and manipulates
their birthday present to guess what there is inside is a fair example of this kind;
the action of shaking unearths additional information that makes guessing less blind
[Magnani, 2001]. In this case, the world is not strictly changed: what is changed is
the representation we have about the problem. Accordingly, epistemic actions can
also be regarded as “task-transforming representations” [Hutchins, 1995].
What suggested above points to the conclusion that solving a problem means
representing it so as to make the solution transparent [Simon, 2005]. Hence, the
question is: how can we make the solution of a problem more transparent? What
can make the solution more transparent? I claim that the cognitive role of ex-
ternal resources is precisely connected with shaping the representation of a task
so as to transform difﬁcult tasks into ones that can be easily carried out. Let me
make an example. Consider, for instance, the following two medical prescriptions
[Norman, 1993]:
Inderal
1 tablet 3 times a day
Lanoxin
1 tablet every a.m.
Carafate
1 tablet before meals and at bed-
time
Br L
D
Bt
Inderal
x
x
x
Quinaglute

Lanoxin

Now, suppose we should answer the question “how many pills should I take at
lunch time?” Here we have two different ways of representing the problem. The
ﬁrst is a traditional medical prescription that simply tells us what kind of pills we
should take, whereas the second is a matrix. If we consider the two representations
we immediately come up with the conclusion that the way the second represents the
task is much easier than the ﬁrst. The reason being the one suggested by Simon,
that is, that matrix representation makes the solution more transparent. The medical
prescription in the table above is far more complex. Already in the ﬁrst line we need
to think about what “1 tablet 3 times a day” means. Once we came up with the num-
ber of pills we should take, we have to write it down. Then pass to the second line,
and so forth. In contrast, the second representation is much simpler: answering the
question simply means scanning down the lunch column, and counting the colored
squares. We may even say that one gets the answer at a glance.

Following
these
hypotheses,
numbers
of
scholars
[Zhang, 1997;
Gatti and Magnani, 2006; Knuuttila and Honkela, 2005] argue that the tradi-
tional notion of representation as a kind of abstract mental structure is misleading.
As the example shows, some cognitive performances can be viewed as the result of
smart interplay between humans and the environment. The ﬁgure below illustrates
our point.
Representation of the problem
Internal
External
Mental operations
Manipulations
Procedures
Tacit inferences
The representation of the task we face is only partly internal. That is, when we
try to accomplish a certain task, we exploit computational and cognitive resources
embodied into external objects: for we are often engaged in such processes without
holding an explicit and internal representation of them. In this case, an external
representation is involved in terms of the actions, procedures, and tacit inferences
we are actually triggered to carry out. More generally, I may argue that external
representations can be considered as “tacit procedures” [Polanyi, 1966] that emerge
from, and are prompted by, the interaction between humans and the environment.
Therefore, internal representation does not mirror the entire representational task,
because it is only a part of it.
3.2.3
Broad Cognitive Systems
In the last paragraph I pointed out how humans constantly lean on external resources
to accomplish various tasks. I have outlined my approach relying on the notion of
external representation. In my view, this notion plays a key role in understanding
how external objects and symbols can enhance human capabilities. In this paragraph
I shall detail some consequences that this approach brings about dealing with the
notion of the cognitive system.
That the environment plays an active role in shaping decision-making activities
is based on the assumption that a cognitive system goes beyond the conﬁnes of
the skull [Clark, 2003]. That is, the skull is not a “magic” boundary that clearly
distinguishes what counts as cognitive and what does not [Wilson, 2004]. There
are several activities and performances that cannot be carried out only by the naked

brain. External resources actively shape cognitive performances that cannot be “tax-
onomized individualistically”, say, only referring to what happens within the brain
[Wilson, 103, p. 352]. Some cognitive processes that we attribute only to humans
are the result of smart interplay between humans and the environment. According
to that, cognitive systems can be viewed as a set of “packages of resources and op-
erations” [Clark and Chalmers, 1998, p. 14]. This set is open to external upgrades
and changes, and most of all is distributed. Indeed, the brain operates on a package
of basic cognitive resources, but the reason why we praise it so much is because of
its “portability” [Clark and Chalmers, 1998].
This conceptual branching leads to two main points. First of all,external resources
can support pre-existing abilities such as memorize or remembering. External sym-
bols, that include rudimentary technologies, release humans from the limitations of
the brain’s biological memory systems [Donald, 2001].
Secondly, external objects can also bring into existence additional cognitive
abilities that the naked brain could not exhibit by itself. For example, there are
several instances pointing to the conclusion that anthropomorphic thinking was
brought about through the mediation of external objects that made it possible to
integrate the two separate intelligence [Mithen, 1999; Magnani, 2006a]. Upper Pa-
leolithic cave paintings seemed to be fundamental aids to our ancestors in order to
store information about animal location and behavior [Eashtem and Easthem, 1991;
D’Errico and Cacho, 1994; Mithen, 1996; Lewis-Williams, 2002]. They were sup-
posed to be models or maps for the speciﬁc terrain around the caves so that predic-
tions about the natural world were improved and decision-making facilitated.
The external resources approach broadens and deepens the original concept of
rationality. Rationality is not referred to the decision-making process here while the
result one obtains through the delegation of cognition to deﬁnite external resources
is rational. It clearly appears then, that we do not refer merely to the computational
capabilities but, more extensively, to the way human cognition is shaped and ex-
tended when getting in contact with external resources. Stating “when getting in
contact to external resources” means in every circumstance, always; though, ratio-
nality is “expanded” by the way it depends on external resources and is enhanced
by them.
Let me make another example following on from Simon. He recognized that
“[t]he introduction of computers changed the ways in which executives were able
to reach decisions; they could now view them in terms of a much wider set of inter-
related consequences than before. The perception of the environment of a decision
is a function of – among other things – the information sources and computational
capabilities of the executives who make it” [Simon, 1978, p. 8]. Here we have two
questions. Firstly, can we suppose that the executive changes his attitudes towards
problem solving and decision making when the computer is introduced? Secondly,
has the user enhanced her/his computational abilities in problem solving and deci-
sion making?
I may say that Simon should have positively answered the ﬁrst question, but
not the second one. According to bounded rationality theory, there is no account

56
3 Moving the Bonds: Distributing Cognition through Cognitive Niche Construction
to explain whether human computational capabilities are developed and shaped
through external resources or not.
The considerations made in the last two paragraphs might lead thinking that Si-
mon’s concept of rationality is a lighter version of what it actually is. Rationality
as a computational resource can be deﬁned as the under-esteemed version of the
whole range of human rational capabilities. Thus, rationality is not bounded, while
internal computational capabilities are. More precisely, computational capabilities
(I) partially represent human decision-making processes, and (II) change – together
with the other human attitudes (psychological, ethical, political, economical, etc.) –
on their own and in relation to external resources. Following statement (I), I argue
that rationality is not limited to computational capabilities, as we make decisions
and obtain results also using not-entirely exploitable procedures. Then, following
statement (II), I sustain that rationality is not bounded, neither in relation to the
potential modiﬁcations of personal capabilities (think of the same individual as a
child and as a Ph.D. laureate),2 nor if we recognize the role of external resources
(artifacts) in modifying our cognitive system. Broadly speaking, I refer to the role
played by (1) time and (2) representations.
In summary, indeed, we do have limitations, but these are always changing (the
cognitive system is not stable by deﬁnition) and heavily dependent on external re-
sources. In this way, it is clear that our model cannot be confused with the un-
bounded rationality model of the neoclassical approach.
3.2.4
The Extended Model
In order to reach a better understanding of the differences between the four mod-
els and to get a clearer picture of our model-building process (see Table 3.1).
Here I try to express the main differences between the four models – neoclassi-
cal (NCM), bounded (BRM), biased (BiRM) and the extended rationality model
(ERM). Bounded rationality was our starting point while the neoclassical approach
remained in the background. Nevertheless, it is very interesting to show differences
and similarities between the four as, in my opinion, bounded and biased rationality
maintain signiﬁcant links to the traditional economic model especially with respect
to the distributed nature of cognition.
I deﬁne and compare the three models using ﬁve variables:
1. the kind of result (or solution) attained by each model;
2. the procedure leading to that result;
3. the hypotheses the models put forward on the human cognitive system;
4. the cognitive capabilities one is supposed to have; and,
5. the philosophical meaning attributed (mostly implicitly) to the acting entity, i.e.
the carrier.
2 It is not necessarily true that a Ph.D. laureate develops superior capabilities if compared to
him/herself as a child; we are only trying to differentiate.

3.2 Bounds Moved: From Bounded to Distributed Cognition
57
The variables are not sorted by their importance. But, they can be organized thinking
of the philosophical hypotheses on the individual (carrier) ﬁrst, and on the other
variables as a subsequent implication of that assumption. For example, the carrier
has deﬁnite cognitive capabilities that are related to her/his cognitive system which
uses a particular procedure in order to obtain the result. For a better explanation of
the model’s workings, it should be clearest to start from the ﬁrst column. The major
part of the issues here cited, are deﬁned and criticized above.

The four models deﬁne in various ways the results their decision-maker obtains.
The neoclassical model refers to optimal results, i.e. the best, while through the
bounded and biased rationality model we obtain only sub-optimal results. The ex-
tended model suggests that the individual gets results that usually ﬁt a particular
situation, and are not necessarily linked to the optimum result. They are workable
in the sense that they allow us to manage deﬁnite situations and can be modiﬁed
(or improved) when conditions change, both internal and external ones. This is in
line with Beach and Mitchell’s image theory [Beach, 1998]; the cognitive model I
provide can serve as a useful basis for their approach.
My model is based on the assumption that both the NCM and the BRM use com-
putation (or brute force strategy) as the only rational goal-attainment procedure.3 In
BiRM and ERM the procedure depends on the joint activity of internal and external
resources, so that computation is only one possible procedure. Emotions, morality
(in terms of personal values), ideas of justice and fairness, culture, etc. have to be
integrated into the rational model of choice between alternatives. in ERM, however,
the meaning here attributed to the exploitation of external resources is strictly linked
to the cognitive meaning attributed. In other words, if all these elements occur in the
decision-making process, it is clear that computation is a speciﬁc case, that cannot
be considered in isolation. It can be prevalent or not, but it does not work as the
three other models suppose it does.
The three models all suppose that the cognitive system is not distributed. In the
ﬁrst case (NCM), the system works in complete isolation; in the second case (BRM)
the environment is a source of constraint to the “natural” and “static” human brain.
3 This point is developed in quite detail by Patokorpi [2008].

58
3 Moving the Bonds: Distributing Cognition through Cognitive Niche Construction
In the case of BiRM, contextual variables are taken into account, but this ecological
element is not integrated into a cognitive framework therefore stressing the dis-
tributed nature of cognition. The ERM, on the contrary, is based on the distributed
cognitive system, in the sense that external resources deﬁne our system and the way
it works.
The main point here is that of limits to individuals’ cognitive capabilities. The
NCM hypothesis is that of individuals having no limits; we say they are unbounded
[Shakun, 2001]. On the contrary, BRM and BiRM computational capabilities, as
the only procedure to obtain results, are limited in individuals. In my approach,
these rational bounds do exist as observed in actual human behavior; however, they
are related (a) to the use and meanings of external resources, (b) to the general
social environment in which the individual behaves, and (c) to the time-effect (also
reﬂected on means-end modiﬁcations). The individual here considered is clearly a
god-like creature, for the NCM, while it is human for the other two. It is clear if we
consider the normative ﬂavor of the ﬁrst and the behavioral intent of the other three.
The bounded rationality model and the biased rationality model deﬁnes rational-
ity as internal computational capabilities, emphasizing the use of brute force. As a
consequence, it cannot explain a series of successful results that do not depend on
computation. I linked these missing points to the fact that the model overlooks im-
portant variables such as the role of representations and external resources affecting
the human cognitive system.
As I have tried to outline, recent cognitive studies highlight that the way our mind
operates are very different from what is supposed by the BR model and the BiR
model. Instead of deﬁnition based on negative assumptions – neoclassical denial –
we have to ﬁnd the positive attributes of human rationality, and to redeﬁne it on the
basis of the human cognition system.4 Assuming that the human cognitive system is
shaped by external resources and representations, implies a few fundamental points:
1. decision making activities (and the way to obtain successful results) derive from
the way individuals interact with the environment;
2. this interaction involves internal and external resources, and the way they are
represented;
3. this process is dynamic, in the sense that cognitive capabilities depend on the
exploitation of external resources and on their representation (time and way of
modifying the interaction);
4. interaction and dynamics imply uncertainty and complexity, in terms of difﬁcul-
ties deciphering between internal and external inﬂuences;
5. the “smart interplay” between the two is not limited to computational capabilities
and, even if we narrowly focus on them, they are not only internal, but depend
from the “smart interplay” itself;
6. thus, our computational capabilities are not limited, since bounds depend on the
“smart interplay” between internal and external resources and, moreover, the re-
sult of the decision making process is embedded in the way the broad cognitive
system employs, represents, and acknowledges external resources.
4 This is the line of thought developed, for instance, by Secchi [2010].

3.3 Cognitive Niche Construction: Distributed Cognition Evolving
59
These six points suggest thinking about rationality and decision making on the basis
of a different approach that enriches the BR model. In particular, the partial results
of this contribution can be highlighted as follows:
1. we are able to deﬁne a cognitive model that connects rationality to the way indi-
viduals employ their cognitive system;
2. if the role of external resources and representations is that deﬁned above, this
approach questions the neoclassical, the BR, and BiR models, concerning its
basic assumptions on computational capabilities;
3. we call for a new model of rational choice, that needs to be effectively based
on external resources and representations interplay, in order to take rationality’s
“moving bounds” into account;
4. the model based on distributed cognition ﬁnds an easier way to explain the role
of critical issues, such as emotions, since they are treated as representations.
From these starting points, the analysis of the model of rationality can follow a
number of different tracks. However, I am focusing on three complementary issues.
The ﬁrst one is related to the decision making process in general terms, where I try
to discover the main underlying variables of human rationality.
The second issue is devoted to the analysis of decision making in an organiza-
tional context. This is the line I am following in order to deﬁne a new model of
rationality based on the distributed cognition approach, as organizations normally
provide researchers with more limited contexts where motivation, creativity, leader-
ship, intuition, staff-line relationships, etc. are easier to recognize and to study.
The last but not least, an important issue of our research activity is empirical test-
ing of the model. This part is not clearly separated from the other two, but is fun-
damental for the trial and error process of outlining a new model. Both the study of
decision-making in general and as it is applied to organizations need to be supported
by data, in order to reach a clearer and more useful model or to switch to another
one. The main variables we focus on are external resources, representations, and, in
general terms, the environment in which decisions are made.
I started from the assumption that the modern social sciences, and especially eco-
nomics and management, need to be strongly rooted in actual behavior. The model
of rationality based on the distributed cognition approach is basically an attempt to
go further this direction: analyzing human rationality as it actually is.
3.3
Cognitive Niche Construction: Distributed Cognition
Evolving
In this section, I am going to shed light on the evolutionary dimension that the
distributed cognition approach developed so far may have. In doing so, I will rely
on the notion of niche construction – a topic that has been neglected for a long time
in biological studies. Niche construction theory will provide a suitable framework
for discussing some fundamental issues related to the idea of cognition discussed in
the previous sections.

60

3.3.1
Niche Construction: The Neglected Side of Evolution
It is well-known that one of the main forces that shape the process of adaptation
is natural selection. That is, the evolution of organisms can be viewed as the re-
sult of a selective pressure that renders them well-suited to their environments.
Adaptation is therefore considered as a sort of top-down process that goes from
the environment to the living creature [Godfrey-Smith, 1998]. In contrast to that,
a small fraction of evolutionary biologists have recently tried to provide an al-
ternative theoretical framework by emphasizing the role of niche construction
[Laland et al., 2000; Laland et al., 2001; Odling-Smee et al., 2003].
According to this view, the environment is a sort of “global market” that provides
living creatures with unlimited possibilities. Indeed, not all the possibilities that the
environment offers can be exploited by the human and non-human animals that act
on it. For instance, the environment provides organisms with water to swim in, air to
ﬂy in, ﬂat surfaces to walk on, and so on. However, no creatures are fully able to take
advantage of all of them. Moreover, all organisms try to modify their surroundings
in order to better exploit those elements that suit them and eliminate or mitigate the
effect of the negative ones.
This process of environmental selection [Odling-Smee, 1988] allows living crea-
tures to build and shape the “ecological niches”. An ecological niche can be deﬁned,
following Gibson, as a “setting of environmental features that are suitable for an an-
imal” [Gibson, 1979]. It differs from the notion of habitat in the sense that the niche
describes how an organism lives its environment, whereas habitat simply describes
where an organism lives.
In any ecological niche, the selective pressure of the local environment is dras-
tically modiﬁed by organisms in order to lessen the negative impacts of all those
elements which they are not suited to. This new perspective constitutes a radical de-
parture from traditional theory of evolution introducing a second inheritance system
called ecological inheritance system [Odling-Smee et al., 2003]. According to this
view, acquired characters – discarded for such a long time – can enter evolution-
ary theories as far as they cause a modiﬁcation to the environment that can persist
and thus can modify the local selective pressure.5 Ecological inheritance system is
different from the genetic one in the following way [Odling-Smee et al., 2003]:
1. genetic materials can be inherited only from parents or relatives. Conversely,
modiﬁcations on the environment can affect everyone, no matter who he/she is.
It may regard unrelated organisms also belonging to other species. There are
several global phenomena such as climate change that regard human beings, but
also the entire ecosystem;
5 This perspective has generated some controversies, since it is not clear the extent to which
modiﬁcations count as niche-construction, and so enter the evolutionary scene. The main
objection regards how far individual or even collective actions can really have ecologi-
cal effects, whether they are integrated or merely aggregated changes. On this point, see
Sterelny [2005] and the more critical view held by Dawkins [2004]. For a reply to these
objections, see Laland et al. [2005].

3.3 Cognitive Niche Construction: Distributed Cognition Evolving
61
2. genes transmission is a one way transmission ﬂow, from parents to offspring,
whereas environmental information can travel backward affecting several gener-
ations. Pollution, for instance, affects young as well as old people;
3. genetic inheritance can happen once during one’s life, at the time of reproductive
phase. In contrast, ecological information can be transferred during the entire
duration of life. Indeed, it depends on the eco-engineering capacities at play;
4. genetic inheritance system leans on the presence of replicators, whereas the eco-
logical inheritance system leans on the persistence of whatsoever changes made
upon the environment.
Indeed, natural selection is somehow not halted by niche construction. Rather, this
means adaptation cannot be only considered by referring to the agency of the envi-
ronment, but also to that of the organism acting on it. In this sense, organisms are
ecological engineers, because they do not simply live their environment, but they
actively shape and change it [Odling-Smee et al., 2003].
3.3.2
The Notion of Cognitive Niche
My contention is that the notion of niche construction can be also usefully applied
to human cognition. More precisely, I claim that cognitive niche construction can
be considered as one of the most distinctive traits of human cognition.
Organisms are equipped with various ontogenetic mechanisms that permit them
to acquire information and thus better adapt to the environment: for instance, im-
mune system in vertebrates and brain-based learning in animals and humans. Their
role is to provide organisms with a supplementary mechanism to acquire informa-
tion and thus face various environmental contingencies that are not – and cannot
be – speciﬁed at the genetic level [Odling-Smee et al., 2003, p. 255]. A genetically
speciﬁed initial set of behaviors is elaborated through experience of a relevant envi-
ronment. These ontogenetic mechanisms are therefore a sort of on-board system al-
lowing ﬂexibility and plasticity of response to an ever-changing environment, which
are at the core of the notion of cognition I endorse.6
In the case of human beings and other mammals, bigger brains allow to store
information which could not be pre-deﬁned by the genes [Aunger, 2002, pp. 182–
193]. Flexibility and plasticity of response to an ever-changing environment are
connected to the necessity of having other means for acquiring information, more
readily and quickly of the genetic one. I posit that niche construction plays a fun-
damental role to meet this requirement. Plasticity and ﬂexibility depend on niche
construction as far as various organisms may alter local selective pressure via
niche construction, and thus increase their chances for surviving. More speciﬁcally,
cognitive niches are crucial in developing more and more sophisticated forms of
6 Godfrey-Smith [2002] deﬁned cognition as the capacity of coping with a range of possible
behavioral options with different consequences for the organism’s chance to survive. This
deﬁnition allows him to embrace a broader notion of cognition which extends it to animal
and plant behaviors. I will embrace this thesis in the sections devoted to abduction and
affordance.

62
3 Moving the Bonds: Distributing Cognition through Cognitive Niche Construction
ﬂexibility, because they constitute an additional source of information favor-
ing behavior and development control. In this case, epigenesis is therefore aug-
mented, and, at genetic level, it is favored by genes regulating epigenetic openness
[Sinha, 2006]. Epigenetic openness is closely related to what Godfrey-Smith [2002]
called phenotypic plasticity; the ﬂexible response of living organisms (humans in
particular) leans on sensitivity to environment clues, and this process of attunement
to relevant aspects of the environment cannot be separated from niche construction.
In the case of human beings, the process of attunement leans on the continuous
interplay between individuals and the environment, in which they more or less tac-
itly manipulate what is occurring outside at the level of the various structures of the
environment in a way that is suited to them. It emerges from a network of continu-
ous interplay between individuals and the environment, in which they more or less
tacitly manipulate what is occurring outside at the level of the various structures
of the environment in a way that is suited to them. Accordingly, I may argue that
the creation of cognitive niches is the way cognition evolves, and humans can be
considered as ecological cognitive engineers.
3.3.3
Cognitive Niches and Distributed Cognition
Recent studies on distributed cognition seem to support our claim.7 As already men-
tioned in section 3.2, problem solving or decision-making, cannot only be regarded
as internal processes that occur within the isolated brain. Through the process of
niche creation humans extend their minds into the material world, exploiting various
external resources. Therefore, they exhibit a range of cognitive behaviors insofar as
they are merged into a network of ecological interactions. For “external resources”
I mean everything that is not inside the human brain, and that could be of some help
in the process of deciding, thinking about, or using something. Therefore, external
resources can be artifacts, tools, objects, and so on. Problem solving, such as general
decision-making activity [Bardone and Secchi, 2009], for example, are unthinkable
without the process of connection between internal and external resources.
In other words, the exploitation of external resources is the process which allows
the human cognitive system to be shaped by environmental (or contingency) ele-
ments. According to this statement, I may argue that external resources play a pivotal
role in almost any cognitive process. Something important must still be added, and
it deals with the notion of representation: in this perspective the traditional notion
of representation as a kind of abstract mental structure becomes old-fashioned and
misleading.8 If some cognitive performances can be viewed as the result of a smart
interplay between humans and the environment, the representation of a problem is
partly internal but it also depends on the smart interplay between the individual and
the environment.

3.3 Cognitive Niche Construction: Distributed Cognition Evolving
63
An alternative deﬁnition of the ecological niche that I ﬁnd appealing in treating
our problem has been provided by Gibson [1979]: he pointed out that a niche can
be seen as a set of affordances. My contention is that the notion of affordance may
help provide sound answers to the various questions that come up with the problem
of ecological niches. The notion of affordance is fundamental for two reasons. First
of all, it deﬁnes the nature of the relationship between an agent and its environment,
and the mutuality between them. Second, this notion may provide a general frame-
work to illustrate humans as chance seekers. I will come back to this issue in the
next chapter.
Within a distributed cognition framework, the activity of niche construction pro-
vides humans with the chance of externally storing and encoding a great deal of
information and computational capabilities. Indeed, cognitive niches contribute to
release a large amount of resources, for instance, in terms of knowledge storage
and computational capabilities to manipulate information. Here again the case of
language is an example worth citing.9
That some kinds of cognitive processes originally designed for speciﬁc purposes
turns out to be useful for others is fairly captured by the notion of cognitive ﬂuid-
ity [Mithen, 1996]. Basically, cognitive ﬂuidity refers to the capacity of applying to
heterogeneous domains forms of thinking originally designed for speciﬁc tasks.10.
Mithen himself seemed to acknowledge the ecological and distributed dimension
of cognitive ﬂuidity. Cognitive ﬂuidity relies on what can be thought primarily
as a direct effect resulting from the (quit unique) human activity of eco-cognitive
engineering.
In Mithen’s own words:
The clever trick that humans learnt was to disembody their minds into the mate-
rial world around them: a linguistic utterance might be considered as a disembod-
ied thought. But such utterances last just for a few seconds. Material culture endures
[Mithen, 1999, p. 291].
The continuous manipulation of various external materialities contributes to un-
cover new chances, which can eventually allow to ﬁnd room for new concepts
[Magnani, 2006a]. Here again the case of anthropomorphic thinking is a valuable
example. In Mithen’s view, it was made available to the human mind literally by the
9 This last contention is in line with what Logan argued on the evolution of human complex-
ity [Logan, 2006, p. 150]. He argued that a new level of order emerges as a response to an
information overload. Though speculative, his contention is worth quoting: “Writing and
mathematical notation arose in Summer as a response to keeping track of the tributes farm-
ers paid to the priests [. . . ]. This gave rise to formal schools to teach the skills of reading
[. . . ], which in turn led to scholars and scholarship giving rise to its information overload,
which in turn led to computers and computers gave rise to its information overload [. . . ]”.
10 According to Mithen cognitive ﬂuidity was the product of what he called a “cognitive big
bang”, which was accompanied by a radical change as the neurological re-organization of
the brain occurred. That cognitive big bang produced remarkable human creative abilities,
i.e., an almost limitless capacity of imagination, because knowledge and information could
ﬂow freely between behavioral domains.

64

exploitation of external conﬁgurations of signs, in which our ancestors were able to
curve from mammoth ivory a half human/half animal ﬁgure. As he put it:
An evolved mind is unlikely to have a natural home for this being, as such entities
do not exist in the natural world, the mind needs new chances: so whereas evolved
minds could think about humans by exploiting modules shaped by natural selection,
and about lions by deploying content rich mental modules moulded by natural selec-
tion and about other lions by using other content rich modules from the natural history
cognitive domain, how could one think about entities that were part human and part
animal? Such entities had no home in the mind. [Mithen, 1999, p. 291]
External structures, which ultimately are meshed into our cognitive niches, exhibit
what may be called a cognitive (semiotic) agency going beyond the individual. That
is, once externalized and secured to external supports, ideas, thoughts, and even
intentions, cease to be what they originally meant to be. They acquire a public sta-
tus; that means they go under a process of negotiation, which eventually leads to
conventionalization and/or entrenchment [Tyl´en, 2007]. This can be vieId also as
an hybridization process, which not only regards human beings and their surround-
ings, but also those objects and artifacts that enter the cognitive niche. Secondly,
human externalizations become part of the so-called eco-cognitive inheritance and,
therefore, being subjected to further modiﬁcations and exploitations insofar as they
can be also the basis for the creation and development of additional eco-cognitive
capabilities.11
The neurological counterpart of this process is a process of brain re-conﬁguration
and re-organization – a rehearsed recapitulation – which allows our brain to dis-
entangle itself from the perception-action cycle typical of the on-line thinking
[Magnani, 2009].
3.4
The Future Enrichment of Cognitive Niches: The Case of
Ambient Intelligence
The cognitive niches in which we live may indeed change. They should not be taken
for granted. They may perish (cf. section 2.6) as well as progress. In this section I
will be dealing with the latter case, the case in which our cognitive niches are en-
riched. In order to do so, I will discuss the case of Ambient Intelligence as cognitive
niche enrichment. That is, I will contend that Ambient Intelligence strongly favors
the development of some crucial and structural aspects of human cognition, in so far
as it creates – given the tremendous technological advancements over recent decades
– a new way in which humans can cognitively live their environments.
Ambient Intelligence surely represents a novelty with respect to how humans
can re-distribute and manage the cognitive resources delegated to the environment.
Although massive cognitive delegations have already been successfully completed,
11 Some authors tried to model how ecologies – cognitive niches, in my terminology – would
emerge and develop. For more information about this issue, see for instance Holt [2009]
and for a more cognitive-oriented account of the same matter see Pata [2009].

3.4 The Future Enrichment of Cognitive Niches: The Case of Ambient Intelligence
65
Ambient Intelligence drastically favors the establishment of new kinds of environ-
ment which present novel theoretical and cognitive features, worthy of analysis.
I contend that, in analyzing the cognitive signiﬁcance of Ambient Intelligence,
the notion of cognitive niche is crucial. Such a notion would allow us to clear up
possible misunderstandings about the role played by technological innovation in
evolution. Besides, the notion of the cognitive niche will be of interest, as I will
claim that Ambient Intelligence can be considered a new stage in the history of
cognitive niche construction, given its “eco-cognitive” impact. Accordingly, I will
claim AmI can be considered a form of cognitive niche enrichment.
The advantages of having such devices that mimic a human mind are not difﬁcult
to grasp. Basically, we are talking about the possibilities of having external artifacts
able to proactively and sensitively assist people in a number of tasks. Ambient Intel-
ligence adds a new layer to the traditional ways of disembodying the mind: Ambient
Intelligence basically puts those sophisticated and smart devices – mimicking our
mind – into our environments. In doing so even familiar objects may embed high-
level computing power. More generally, I argue that Ambient intelligence deals not
only with reproducing some kind of sophisticated human cognitive performance,
but also focuses attention on the eco-cognitive dimension of computing – referred
to as context-aware computing [Cook and Das, 2007].
Ambient Intelligence enriches the experience of our environment in many ways.
The most striking aspect related to Ambient Intelligence as a form of distribu-
tive intelligence is the level of autonomy that smart environments can reach
[Hildebrandt, 2008a]. A smart environment has an amazing power of monitoring
and subsequently keeping track not only of our actions – what we do – but also of
our preferences – what we desire [Remagnino et al., 2005; Cook et al., 2009]. Col-
lecting such an amount of data – and aggregating it – allows smart environments to
provide us with feedback that exhibit a degree of adaptability that cannot be com-
pared with any other traditional environment (or cognitive niche, as I will show in
the following sections). First of all, a smart environment adapts itself to infer one’s
preferences. It can act on the basis of past interactions that have been appropriately
stored and then exploited by various tools mimicking some sophisticated forms of
reasoning. This means that in smart environments high-level customization is pos-
sible, relying on the collection and aggregation of data about our behavior. These
environments can also be creative insofar as they can anticipate user preferences,
even before they become aware of them themselves [Hildebrandt, 2008a]. In this
case, smart environments exhibit what Verbeek [2008] calls “composite intention-
ality”. Basically, composite intentionality refers to situations in which the inten-
tionality resulting from an action we take is made up of our own in coordination
with that emerging from the interaction with an artefact. The intentionality result-
ing from interaction in smart environments is indeed highly composite, as AmI is
designed speciﬁcally for augmenting – and thus making accessible – some experi-
ence of the world with respect to various modalities, namely, sensing, acting, and
making decisions. I will come back to this issue in section 4.5 devoted to “adapting
affordance”.

3 Moving the Bonds: Distributing Cognition through Cognitive Niche Construction
Thus, to summarize, the idea behind distributed cognition is that human cogni-
tive capabilities are fundamentally shaped by environmental chances that are eco-
logically rooted. Cognitive processes do not happen in a vacuum, so the context and
the resources one has at one’s disposal are crucial for describing and also explain-
ing human cognition. Ambient Intelligence can certainly be considered one of the
most sophisticated ways humans have invented to distribute cognitive functions to
external objects. In this case, the massive cognitive delegation contributes to
a radical re-distribution of the cognitive load humans are subjected to. Basi-
cally, Ambient Intelligence improves people’s experience in their environments
[Cook and Das, 2007]. That is, it increases the number and range of tasks one can
accomplish. As the result of a massive cognitive delegation, humans are provided
with environments that bring sophisticated interactions into existence, in which the
cognitive load is partly carried out by intelligent devices displaying an unprece-
dented level of autonomy and transparency.
As already mentioned, the outstanding characteristics of human beings are that
they have progressively become eco-cognitively dominant, as their abilities as eco-
cognitive engineers out-competed the ones of other species in occupying and then
modifying according to their needs the shared environments [Flinn et al., 2005]. The
notion of cognitive niche acknowledges the artiﬁcial nature of the environment hu-
mans live in, and their active part in shaping it with relation to their needs and goals.
It is within this context that I locate the innovative character of Ambient Intelligence.
That is, the creation of smart environments can certainly be viewed as a new way of
constructing the cognitive niche. More precisely, Ambient Intelligence constitutes
an eco-cognitive activity in which our pre-existing cognitive niches are dramatically
enriched with objects and tools that re-conﬁgure our capacities for extending human
cognition and its boundaries.
It is worth noting – even though I will not be dealing with this issue – that niche
construction activities do not halt natural selection. This certainly has some conse-
quences that should be acknowledged. Niche construction activities may help hu-
mans reduce the negative impacts of pre-existing niches but that does not mean
that they might not produce even worse consequences. This is because, even when
a niche has been modiﬁed, selection pressures continue to act upon us and other
organisms as well. Certain cognitive niches resulting from intensive eco-cognitive
activity may turn out to be “maladaptive” or – at least – they might actually endan-
ger us and other species as well. Here, the term “maladaptive” is not intended in a
Darwinian sense.
In Ambient Intelligence we have many examples of potential maladaptive out-
comes resulting from cognitive niche enrichment activity. For example, the problem
of the possible negative consequences of Ambient Intelligence in the case of agency
and (criminal) liability is discussed in Hildebrandt [2008a]. Hildebrandt brilliantly
points out that the emergence of ambient technologies that are able to monitor and
anticipate human behavior can become a threat to a number of values that are crucial
in Western democracies, like for instance, the values that are at play in the case of
criminal liability. She argues that, as far as we cannot say whether a certain action
has been carried out by us or by an artiﬁcial device, then we will also have severe

3.4 The Future Enrichment of Cognitive Niches: The Case of Ambient Intelligence
67
problems in attributing criminal liability. This may also cause a person to exploit the
ambiguity resulting from the AmI establishment of a hybrid agency, in their favor.12
Another possible negative consequence is related to the notion of identity. As argued
by Gudwirth [2009], AmI technologies empower humans in the process of proﬁling.
Proﬁling basically deals with the possibility of assigning an identity to a user rely-
ing on data and information gathered from the behaviors of the same user as well
as of others. The pervasiveness of AmI drastically changes our ability and the effec-
tiveness of such a task, given the continuous and detailed monitoring of the user’s
behavior made possible by the smart devices available. Being proﬁled, as Gudwirth
argued, could, however, easily become a threat to the development of our own iden-
tity because it can be assigned automatically, and even without our consent. In this
sense, AmI potentially and dangerously induces us, ﬁrst of all, to adopt an identity
we did not have the opportunity to choose. This is clearly a limitation of our free-
dom insofar as we would be obliged – more or less tacitly – to match in with some
arbitrary categories generated by the proﬁling algorithms. Secondly, it enforces us
to adapt “to a context moulded by other actors” [Gutwirth, 2009] favoring various
dynamics related to standardization and, sometimes, even group tyranny. 13
In order to further and better assess the eco-cognitive contribution of Ambient
Intelligence the notion of affordance is fundamental. In section 4.5 I will illustrate
and develop the idea that the novelty of AmI lies in the fact that Ambient Intelli-
gence enriches human cognitive niches by providing new affordances. I will show
how affordances are cognitive chances embedded in the interaction between a (hu-
man) organism and its environment, and how they are organized in cognitive niches,
which make them easily accessible. Ambient Intelligence populates our cognitive
niches with objects and devices that are to some extent intelligent objects. More
12 As for the relationship between modern law and technology, more generally, Hildebrandt
[2008b] has recently argued that they are indeed coupled together, as technologies always
exhibit what she called “technological normativity”, which should not be confused, how-
ever, with so-called “legal normativity”. Basically, technological normativity refers to the
fact that every technology has a certain “normative” impact on our behavior insofar as it
permits or facilitates us to do something (regulative normativity) and, at the same time,
prohibits us from doing something else, thereby constraining our behavioral chances (con-
stitutive normativity). We should thus acknowledge that modern law is embedded in certain
practices which are shaped by pre-existing devices and tools. That is, modern law did not
emerge in a technological vacuum, but it is a response to speciﬁc societal needs. How-
ever, as technological innovation brings new tools and devices into existence, we should
acknowledge that modiﬁcation of the legal framework is of urgent need to preserve those
democratic values that our societies are – and continue to be – imbued with.
13 A more exhaustive treatment of the relationship between ethics and technology is provided
in Magnani [2007c]. Magnani discussed at length that morality is extended, and that recent
technological advancements are clearly re-conﬁguring some of the crucial aspects of our
moral life. On this topic, Verbeek too points out that it is basically “a mistake to locate
ethics exclusively in the ’social’ realm of the human, and technology exclusively in the
’material’ realm of the nonhuman” [Verbeek, 2009, p. 65]. Technologies are indeed part of
our moral endowments in the way that our moral response can be shaped by technological
devices.

precisely, through the activity of cognitive niche enrichment it delivers new kinds of
affordances, which preexisting technologies could not furnish. This is the a creation
of a kind of affordance that I call adapting affordances, as they exhibit adaptability.
Before I turn to issue related to affordance, for the rest of this chapter I shall
discuss another important point: why and how cognitive niches may persist.
3.5
Cognitive Niche Maintenance and Group-Selection
3.5.1
Cognitive Niche Maintenance
I have just argued that cognitive niches contributes to introducing a second and
non-genetic inheritance system insofar as the modiﬁcations brought about on the
environment persist, and so be passed on from generation to generation. The main
advantage of having this second inheritance system is that it enables humans to ac-
cess a great variety of information and resources never personally experienced, but
resulting from the activity of previous generations [Alvard, 2003]. That is, the in-
formation and knowledge humans can lean on are not simply transmitted, but they
can be also accumulated in the human niches. Indeed, the knowledge I am talk-
ing about embraces a great variety of resources including knowledge about nature,
social organization, technology, the human body, and so on.
Castro et al. [2004] have recently investigated the mechanism that favors the ac-
cumulation of knowledge beyond one generation. They argued a key factor enabling
the growth of a cumulative inheritance system is the development of “the capacity
to approve or disapprove their offspring’s learned behavior”. They argue that simply
imitating what others are doing does not lead to accumulation of that particular trait
being imitated. Imitation, and related forms of social learning, provide a general
model for explaining how acquired traits can be transmitted from person to person,
but not how they are accumulated into a kind of repertoire.14
Castro et al.’s intuition can be further developed in connection to the eco-
cognitive framework I have described above. On one hand, a cognitive niche is a
mediating structure enabling to store at various levels a great deal of information
and resources; on the other hand, the capacity of approving or disapproving plays
the major role of what I may call cognitive niche maintenance. All those activities
of incorporation of a behavioral trait into the vast repertoire of resources delivered
by a cognitive niche are examples of cognitive niche maintenance. The adoption or
14 It is noteworthy that this contention seems to assign a fundamental role to morality for
explaining the emergence of culture as a second inheritance system. Morality underlies all
those activities of cognitive niche maintenance, because it favors certain ideas to persist at
the expense of others. As a speciﬁc structure that connects rules and prescriptions with hu-
man emotional endowments [Adolphs, 2006], it is precisely related to the task of policing
what ideas, behaviors, habits, etc. should be preserved, and what should not. In this sense,
as suggested by several authors, it seems morality has characterized human communi-
ties for much of their evolutionary history [Boehm, 1999; Bingham, 2000; Wilson, 2002a;
Wilson, 2002b; Magnani, 2009].

3.5 Cognitive Niche Maintenance and Group-Selection
69
rejection of new learned traits should go under scrutiny and evaluation to preserve
repertoire integrity.
The activities of cognitive niche maintenance can be carried out implicitly
as well as explicitly. Either way cognitive niche maintenance is administered at
group/coalition level. For instance, gossiping is certainly an activity of cognitive
niche maintenance insofar as gossipers play the role of assessors policing group-
serving behaviors and detecting cheaters [Wilson et al., 2002]. In the section 1.3.2
I have already stressed how gossiping fallacies variously serve social control at the
level of coalitions management. Generally speaking, the capacity of approve or dis-
approve acquired traits (behaviors, delegations to external objects, ideas, and so on)
depends on the the presence of groups (or coalitions), which can only have the power
for generating, sharing, and – most of all – enforcing public criteria and standards
to approve and disapprove cultural traits.
Cognitive niche maintenance is a sort of conceptual bridge that permits us to
connect the notion of niche construction to that of group-level selection: groups
in their coalitionist nature can be regarded as adaptive units [Wilson, 2002b;
Wilson, 2006]. I develop this contention arguing that a group can be smoothly con-
sidered an adaptive unit as far as its members occupy a cognitive niche, which lo-
cally alters the selective pressure, which they are subjected to. In this sense, al-
though human communities rarely comprise only genetic relatives, group members
can share what may be called phenotype familiarity or resemblance simply because
they occupy the same ecological niche. In this sense, the notion of group-level adap-
tation can be fairly captured and properly addressed by the notion of niche construc-
tion as a key factor of evolution.
As it will be clear in the following, I am not indulging in any super-organism
approach, which argues on the presence of group or collective mind. In our concep-
tion group-level functionalism acquires an explanatory power with respect to niche
construction. That is, groups and coalitions function as integrated units insofar as
they locally alter the selective pressure constructing or modifying the surroundings,
namely, the cognitive niches. Individuals can exhibit a given set of cognitive behav-
iors, because they form part of a cognitive niche. In this sense, I agree with Wilson
[2001], who clearly maintained group-level cognition approach does not necessary
involve any ontological claim on the existence of super-organisms or group psycho-
logical traits – so to speak. My conception is akin to what he called the social man-
ifestation thesis, according to which individuals can only have properties, which,
however, are manifest “when those individuals form part of a group of a certain
type” [Wilson, 2001, p. 265].
3.5.2
Finding Room for Group-Selection in Evolution
Here I will introduce some issues related to group selection.15 I will try to under-
stand what kind of role group selection may have in evolution, in the light of the
niche construction approach I have developed in the previous section. My take is
15 For a detailed treatment of this issue, see Okasha [2006].

70
3 Moving the Bonds: Distributing Cognition through Cognitive Niche Construction
that group selection plays a crucial role in evolution, insofar as it allows or facil-
itates a cognitive niche to persist, or not. This point is connected with the issue I
treated in section 2.6 concerning the “maladaptive” dimension of biased rationality.
In that section, I pointed out that the strategies based on competence-dependent in-
formation are successful as far as knowledge can persist and be accumulated and
transmitted via the cognitive niche.
In literature, the issue concerning group selection arises in connection with those
adaptations that are hard to explain referring only to individual selection. By deﬁ-
nition an adaptation is a trait enhancing one’s chance of survival and reproduction
[Wilson and Wilson, 2007]. The paradox of traits like, for instance, altruism is that
apparently they do not beneﬁt those who demonstrate them. Quite the contrary, traits
like altruism are commonly considered as self-sacriﬁcing. If so, then they could
hardly be thought of as the result of evolution, since they would sooner or later lead
those bearing them to extinction.
This would not follow, if we assumed levels or units of selection beyond the in-
dividual unit, or the existence of a higher level of organization beyond the individ-
ual. This is basically the option set forth by David Sloan Wilson (cf. [Wilson, 1977;
Wilson and Sober, 1994; Wilson, 2002b; Wilson, 2006; Wilson and Wilson, 2007]).
Wilson’s proposal is indeed attractive in as far as he put forward an interesting argu-
ment corroborated by mathematical tools, in which groups acquire an explanatory
role for certain human behaviors. The case of altruism provides the clearest example
to describe his approach to group selection.
Before getting onto Wilson’s main line of argumentation, it is important to clarify
what I mean by the term altruism. In literature we ﬁnd two different, but apparently
overlapping meanings [Stich, 2007]: evolutionary altruism and psychological altru-
ism. The ﬁrst case, refers to all those behaviors that are group-serving and insofar
as a given behavior trades ﬁtness from the individual level to the group, then it is
altruistic. In the second case, the term altruism is attributed to those psychological
dispositions or motivations underlying the decision to sacriﬁce a part of one’s own
beneﬁt in favor of others. These two deﬁnitions of altruism are not in competition,
but they do not necessarily involve one another. For instance, a certain behavior can
be deemed as altruistic just because it contributes to the ﬁtness transfer from indi-
vidual to group level, no matter what the motivation, whether triggered by a selﬁsh
or an altruistic attitude. In the following I will refer to evolutionary altruism.16
Wilson’s proposal starts from the very simple assumption that all organisms act
so that their behavior has a certain impact on other organisms in a given population
including on themselves. The problem of altruism arises when an organism opts
for a certain behavior, which increases the ﬁtness of one or more recipients while
decreasing its own ﬁtness. Consider, for instance, the case in which a given behavior
x beneﬁts everyone in a population by an amount B(x) at a private cost of C(x) so
that we have:
B(x) > C(x)
16 As becomes clear in the following, I will contend that the expression “altruistic behavior”
could be replaced by that of “ﬁtness-transfer behavior”.

3.5 Cognitive Niche Maintenance and Group-Selection
71
If one assumes that, absolute individual ﬁtness is the appropriate criterion, which
will predict who will be selected out then clearly, sooner or later, altruism will
disappear because it is a disadvantageous trait for those who bear it. However, as
Wilson pointed out [Wilson and Wilson, 2007], absolute individual ﬁtness is the ap-
propriate criterion, if we assume an unstructured population, in which groups are
randomly formed. In fact, if the differences among groups are less than random –
a condition technically called positive assortment – then absolute individual ﬁtness
looses its predictable power. An example can make this contention clearer.
Consider the case of a population, in which we have hunters and scroungers dif-
ferently assorted in groups of the same size so that one group may have more hunters
and the other more scroungers. Hunters beneﬁt all the members of the group by an
amount of 3 units at a private cost of 1; scroungers will beneﬁt all the members of
the group by an amount of 0 units at a private cost of 0. In this particular case, the
overall ﬁtness of each individual will not only be predicted by its absolute individual
ﬁtness, but also by the one relative to the group an individual is part of. In fact, it is
easy to note that the probability of surviving and reproducing of each individual will
increase, if it is be a member of the group in which there are more hunters. Under
such a scenario, Wilson argued that between-group selection overrides within-group
selection so that the appropriate criterion for predicting the ﬁtness of each individual
depends also on group ﬁtness.
The approach of group or multi-level selection is supposed to explain the reason
why altruism can spread and evolve.17 In the example I illustrated, under speciﬁc
conditions of positive assortment the ﬁtness of the group depends on the presence
of hunters, whose contribution to the group lessens the negative ﬁtness they have at
the absolute individual level.18
3.5.3
Group-Projecting Behaviors, Assortment, and the Stallation
Hypothesis
The theoretical problem I are facing now is to discern what speciﬁc role group selec-
tion may have in evolution and whether or not it can be interpreted as a meaningful
evolutionary force. The thesis I embrace is that group selection (or multilevel selec-
tion) is a fundamental ingredient for explaining certain adaptations, but it cannot be
considered as a unit of selection.
Before proceeding it is worth distinguishing between two notions, which can
lead to confusion. We distinguish units of evolution from levels of selection. As far
as I am concerned here, a unit of evolution is any entity exhibiting multiplication,
variation, and heredity, as Maynard Smith [1987] put it. The deﬁnition of “levels of
selection” is a bit more complicated. As the example of relative individual ﬁtness
shows, a certain trait (i.e. altruism) can only be explained by assuming a higher
17 A discussion about multi-level selection can be found in Field [2008].
18 For a perspective contrasting this view, see Fletcher and Zwick [2004]. Fletcher and col-
league explain why altruism may spread in randomly assorted groups.

72
3 Moving the Bonds: Distributing Cognition through Cognitive Niche Construction
level of selection. I posit that this is made possible by those behaviors that function
as ﬁtness traders.
The appearance and evolution of new level of selections is not something
new in biology. Biological complexity results from major transition occurring
during life history, involving levels of selections, which are structured in a
hierarchy [Maynard-Smith and Szathmary, 1995; Michod, 2005]. From gene to
gene networks, from unicellular to multicellular organism, life has followed
a pattern of evolvability, in which groups became individuals bringing about
new evolutionary units or a new level of selection [Michod and Aurora, 2003;
Michod and Herron, 2006; Michod, 2007]. The transition from a lower to a higher
level depends on ﬁtness traders, which, in turn, result from cooperative interactions.
The presence of cooperative interactions causes ﬁtness transfer from one level to
another.
Going back to human groups, I contend that they cannot be considered a new
evolutionary unit or a new evolutionary individuality. Why? Because the ﬁtness
transferred from the individual level to the group level cannot be inherited. This
is the major argument against the possibility of considering groups as units of evo-
lution (or evolvability). As already mentioned, any collaborative behaviors cause a
ﬁtness transfer from the low level to the high level. The projecting nature of col-
laborative behavior is however limited within one generation, since there is no sys-
tem of inheritance causing not only ﬁtness transfer, but also ﬁtness inheritance. A
group cannot be interpreted as a stable unit, because it is constantly facing change
[Ichinose and Arita, 2008]. After a number of generations, group composition com-
pletely changes. Besides, a group can face the process of dispersal, where a group
as a unit can cease to exist for a number of reasons. Indeed, this is reasonable when
assuming that a population is structured in different groups, in conﬂict with each
other. However, groups are not divided by genetic relatedness, and therefore they
can change over time, and even under go the aforementioned process of dispersal.
It is worth noting, however, that ﬁtness transfer does not necessary imply that
the transition toward the new unit of evolvability is completed. Therefore, I deﬁne
behaviors such as altruism as group-projecting behaviors, meaning that groups are
projections of an higher unit of evolution. That is, every time an individual behaves
altruistically it acts as if the group actually exists. I maintain that such a deﬁnition
would allow us to combine the intuitive force of Wilson’s position without indulging
in a super-organicistic approach to the matter.
The relevance of group-projecting behavior introduces quite a speculative is-
sue, that is however useful in order to better understand the allegedly evolution-
ary meaning of groups. According to Stearns we are “stalled part way through a
major evolutionary transition from individual to groups” [Stearns, 2007]. Although
the hypothesis is indeed hard to prove, due to the very nature of the hypothesis it-
self, we have evidence, which makes it reasonable or – at least – not completely
absurd and nonsensical. For instance, the astonishing degree of cooperation even
among non-relatives, which characterizes human communities, the number of emo-
tions and feelings underlying cooperative behaviors such as empathy and the sense
of justice and duty, and the various social mechanisms to protect group members

3.5 Cognitive Niche Maintenance and Group-Selection
73
from cheating such as indirect reciprocity or second and third-party punishment.19
The universal presence of morality in human communities is another clue, since
morality is a powerful cultural artifact for composing within-group conﬂicts.
One of the interesting aspects of the stallation hypothesis is that social groups
are the primary sources of trade-off mechanisms, which in theory are responsible
for managing conﬂicts between two major behaviors, namely, self-serving behavior
and group-serving behavior. Norms as policing factors are thought to regulate such
mechanisms of conﬂict trade-off. However, it is worth noting that when positive
assortment is strong, that is, when a group is stable, the adherence to social norms
(including moral ones) becomes less urgent.20 This is proof supporting the idea of
the stallation hypothesis, since stability-dependent cooperation does not attribute
a special adaptive role to cooperation per se, but to the tendency of assessing the
optimal level of cooperation in a given situation. Conversely, morality requires a
stronger commitment when group stability slows down or during the process of
assorting.
There is another issue worth mentioning. According to the theory of human eco-
logical dominance [Flinn et al., 2005], the primary factor promoting or threatening
an individual’s reproductive success are other people. By the intense activity of
niche construction, humans succeeded in altering their local environment so as to
reduce threats coming from natural forces. This appears to attribute a selective role
to groups with respect to other factors. In fact, as people owe much of their chance
for survival and reproduction to the group they live in, competition between-groups
becomes a primary source of selection.
3.5.4
An Eco-Cognitively Mediated Conception of Group
Assortment
As already mentioned, one of the pre-requisites for completing a transition is ﬁtness
inheritance. That is, ﬁtness variations emerging at group level should be inherited
from past generations. That implies consideration of a group as a unit of evolution
and evolvability. Indeed, human groups cannot be considered as units of evolution,
because the ﬁtness variations cannot be inherited. However, the presence of strong
forms of group assortment is a major clue supporting the idea that we are part way
through a major evolutionary transition. In human communities, group assortment
manages group boundaries and membership over time. In this sense, all those as-
sortative mechanisms, related to group boundaries and membership management,
approximate what an inheritance system does when a major transition is completed.
Here, two points should be stated clearly. First of all, cooperative behaviors cause
a ﬁtness transfer, which projects a new level of selection.21 In turn, the group
19 The so-called “social brain hypothesis” is discussed in Chapter 1.
20 This idea is discussed in Lahti and Weinstein [2005] referring to the notion of moral vis-
cosity. Moral viscosity is also treated in detail by Magnani [2011].
21 As already noted above, the appearance of a new unit of evolution is not a pre-requisite to
have a new level of selection.

74
3 Moving the Bonds: Distributing Cognition through Cognitive Niche Construction
projection mediates what is called the re-organization of ﬁtness components. Dur-
ing a major transition re-organization of ﬁtness components can be described as a
process of co-option of pre-existing functions at individual level for designing new
functions and traits serving at group level.
Now, the question is what kind of inﬂuence may a niche have on group as-
sortment? Answering this question is crucial in order to integrate group selection
into a more coherent framework for explaining the evolutionary impact of cognitive
niches.
Pepper proposed a model in which environmental feedback is referred to as an
alternate source of generating and maintaining group assortment [Pepper, 2000;
Pepper, 2007]. In this case, such a model does not resort to the presence of any
common descent or special cognitive abilities. Conversely, it simply assumes that a
given trait alters the local environment so that organisms are prompted to react to
the change following a certain pattern of response. For example, food supply may
increase and thus beneﬁt the group, as one responds altruistically to lower feeding
efﬁciency. In this case, the altruistic trait causes feeding restraint, which in turn leads
to a better distribution of food supply.
Starting from this idea, I argue that this approach may be fruitfully integrated
within the theory of cognitive niche construction. In this case, I suggest assortment
resorts to a set of mediated interactions that individuals living in the same cogni-
tive niche share. As I will show in the next chapter, what they share is a set of
affordances.
Let me resume the main points:
1. individual ﬁtness relative to the group becomes the appropriate criterion to pre-
dict the evolutionary impact of a given trait under the condition of positive
assortment;
2. group boundaries and membership rely on ﬂexibility of the traits involved. Mech-
anisms of group assortment are the only means to guarantee stability in face of
change and dispersal;
3. Mechanisms of group assortment permit a group to have an approximating
system of inheritance;
4. A cognitive niche has an inﬂuence on group assortment in terms of environmental
feedback.
In conclusion, relatedness is basically the degree to which beneﬁts due to a given
behavior are restricted to the members of one group. Adopting an eco-cognitively
mediated conception of assortment simply means that the beneﬁts are restricted to
those who occupy the same cognitive niche.
3.6
Concluding Remarks
In this chapter I have illustrated how the notion of the cognitive niche plays a crucial
role for developing the idea of moving the bounds to rationality. This is an attempt to
view cognition from a broader perspective able to give an evolutionary dimension to

it. As a matter of fact, humans and many other organisms continuously manipulate
the environment in order to take advantage of it. In doing this, they are engaged
in a process of altering or even creating external structures to lessen and overcome
their limits. New ways of coping with the environment, through both evolution and
cultural evolution (i.e “cognitive niche construction”) are thus created.
In the last part of the chapter, I dealt with the issue related to cognitive niche
maintenance. I have clariﬁed some controversial points concerning group selection.
The idea I introduced is that a cognitive niche may persist, and thus acquire evolu-
tionary meaning, insofar as there is a group maintaining it. In turn, cognitive niche
maintenance is favored by various activities of group assortment, which I have in-
terpreted as eco-cognitively mediated ones.
The next chapter will put forward an alternative conception of the cognitive niche,
based on the notion of affordance. As I will demonstrate, a cognitive niche can
be deﬁned as a set of affordances, which are basically environmental chances that
can be found or manufactured upon occasion. The introduction of this deﬁnition
is thought to solve some of the problems concerning what should be counted as a
cognitive niche.

Chapter 4
Building Cognitive Niches: The Role of
Affordances
Introduction
In the second part of Chapter 2, I pointed out that rationality is un-biased, as humans
manipulate their environment to build up various external structures which become
increasingly symptomatic in relation to what is happening in their environment. The
recourse to external structures that are more symptomatic makes biased rationality
less and less appealing, since the new option appears to be better grounded in ex-
perience. This chapter will aim at illustrating how humans manipulate their local
environment in order to move the bounds of rationality.
The notion of affordance will provide the suitable conceptual framework to illus-
trate the construction of ever more symptomatic external structures for making deci-
sions and solving problems. By manipulating the environment, namely, by means of
niche construction, humans unearth new chances that, in turn, contribute to moving
the bounds of rationality. Chances are not simply information, but they are “af-
fordances”, namely, environmental anchors that allow us to better exploit external
resources.
In Chapter 3 I illustrated the theory of niche construction applied to cognition.
I introduced the notion of cognitive niche construction referring to the fact that the
designing activities which humans lean on to manipulate the environment are part
of human cognition insofar as they unearth additional chances for behavior control.
Thus, human cognition and its evolutionary dimension can be better understood in
terms of environmental situatedness where information and resources are not only
given, but they are actively sought and even manufactured. This is basically the idea
of human cognition as a chance-seeking system.
After presenting some of the conceptual muddles affordance suffers from, I
introduce the notion of abduction in order to clear up any ambiguities and miscon-
ceptions still present in current debate. Going beyond a mere sentential conception,
I will argue that the role played by abduction is two fold. First of all, it decisively
leads us to a better deﬁnition of affordance. As I will discuss in detail in section 4.4,
I will posit that affordances can be related to the variable (degree of) abductivity of
a conﬁguration of signs. Secondly, abduction turns out to be a valuable candidate
for solving the problem related to whether affordance detection is mediated or not.

4 Building Cognitive Niches: The Role of Affordances
In closing section 4.5, I will come back to the notion of cognitive niche enrich-
ment introduced in Chapter 3. First of all, I will introduce the notion of adapting
affordance. Secondly, I will show how conceptually rich that notion is in assess-
ing the eco-cognitive discontinuity that Ambient Intelligence is promising to bring
about.
4.1
Cognitive Niche as a Set of Affordances
4.1.1
The Notion of Affordance
One of the most disturbing problems with the notion of affordance is that any ex-
amples provide different, and sometimes ambiguous insights on it. This fact makes
very hard to give a conceptual account of it. That is to say, when making examples
everybody grasps the meaning, but as soon as one tries to conceptualize it the clear
idea one got from it immediately disappears. Therefore, I hope to go back to ex-
amples from abstraction without loosing the intuitive simplicity that such examples
provide to the intuitive notion.
The entire debate during the last ﬁfteen years about the notion of affordance is
very rich and complicated, but also full of conﬂicts and ambiguities. This subsection
aims at giving just an overview of some issues I consider central to introduce to my
treatment.
Gibson deﬁnes “affordance” as what the environment offers, provides, or fur-
nishes. For instance, a chair affords an opportunity for sitting, air breathing, water
swimming, stairs climbing, and so on. By cutting across the subjective/objective
frontier, affordances refer to the idea of agent-environment mutuality. Gibson did
not only provide clear examples, but also a list of deﬁnitions [Wells, 2002] that may
contribute to generating possible misunderstanding:
1. affordances are opportunities for action;
2. affordances are the values and meanings of things which can be directly per-
ceived;
3. affordances are ecological facts;
4. affordances are distributed representations.
I contend that the Gibsonian ecological perspective originally achieves two impor-
tant results. First of all, human and animal agencies are somehow hybrid, in the
sense that they strongly rely on the environment and on what it offers. Secondly,
Gibson provides a general framework about how organisms directly perceive objects
and their affordances. His hypothesis is highly stimulating: “[...] the perceiving of
an affordance is not a process of perceiving a value-free physical object [...] it is
a process of perceiving a value-rich ecological object”, and then, “physics may be
value free, but ecology is not” [Gibson, 1979, p. 140]. These two issues are related,
although some authors seem to have disregarded their complementary nature. It is
important here to clearly show how these two issues can be considered two faces of
the same medal. Let us start our discussion.

4.1 Cognitive Niche as a Set of Affordances
79
4.1.2
Affordances as Action Opportunities
Several authors have been extensively puzzled by the claim repeatedly made by
Gibson that “an affordance of an object is directly perceived” [Greeno, 1994;
Stoffregen, 2003; Scarantino, 2003; Chemero, 2003]. During the last few years an
increasing number of contributions has extensively debated the nature of affor-
dance as opportunity for action. Consider for instance the example “stairs afford
climbing”. In this example, stairs provide us with the opportunity of climbing; we
climb stairs because we perceive the property of “climbability”, and that affor-
dance emerges in the interaction between the perceiver and stairs [Chemero, 2003;
Stoffregen, 2003]. In order to prevent from any possible misunderstanding, it is
worth distinguishing between “affordance property” and “what” and object affords
[Natsoulas, 2004]. In the former sense, the system “stairs-plus-perceiver” exhibits
the property of climbability, which is an affordance property. Whereas in the latter
the possibility of climbing is clearly what an object affords.
4.1.3
Affordances as Ecological Facts
Concerning this point, Gibson argued that affordances are ecological facts. Con-
sider, for instance, a block of ice. Indeed, from the perspective of physics a block of
ice melting does not cease to exist. It simply changes its state from solid to liquid.
Conversely, to humans a block of ice melting does go out of existence, since that
drastically changes the way we can interact with it. A block of ice can chill a drink
the way cold water cannot. Now, the point made by Gibson is that we may provide
alternative descriptions of the world: the one speciﬁed by affordances represents the
environment in terms of action possibilities. As Vicente put it, affordances “[...]
are a way of measuring or representing the environment with respect to the action
capabilities of an individual [...] one can also describe it [a chair] with respect to
the possibilities for action that it offers to an organism with certain capabilities”
[Vicente, 2003]. Taking a step further, I may claim that affordances are chances that
are ecologically rooted. They are ecological rooted because they rely on the mutu-
ality between an agent (or a perceiver) and the environment. As ecological chances,
affordances are the result of a hybridizing process in which the perceiver meets the
environment. The emphasized stress on the mutuality between the perceiver and the
environment provides a clear evidence of this point.
4.1.4
Affordances as Distributed Representations
Recently, Zhang and Patel [2006], also going beyond the ecological concept of af-
fordance in animals and wild settings by involving its role in human cognition and
artifacts, in an unorthodox perspective, connect the notion of affordance to that of
distributed representation. They maintain that affordances can be also related to the

80
4 Building Cognitive Niches: The Role of Affordances
role of distributed representations extended across the environment and the organ-
ism. These kinds of representation come about as the result of a blending process
between two different domains: on one hand the internal representation space, that
is the physical structure of an organism (biological, perceptual, and cognitive fac-
ulties); on the other the external representation of space, namely, the structure of
the environment and the information it provides. Both these two domains are de-
scribed by constraints so that the blend consists of the allowable actions. Consider
the example of an artifact like a chair. On one hand the human body constrains the
actions one can make; on the other the chair has its constraints as well, for instance,
its shape, weight, and so on. The blend consists of the allowable actions given both
internal and external constraints.1
Patel and Zhang’s idea tries to clarify that affordances result from a hybridizing
process in which the environmental features and the agent’s ones in terms of con-
straints are blended into a new domain which they call affordance space. Taking
a step further, Patel and Zhang deﬁne affordances as allowable actions. If this ap-
proach certainly acknowledges the hybrid character of affordance I have described
above and the mutuality between the perceiver and the environment, it seems how-
ever lacking with regard to its conceptual counterpart. As already argued, affor-
dances are action-based opportunities.
4.1.5
Affordances as Evolving Interactional Structures
Taking advantage of some recent results in the areas of distributed and animal cog-
nition, I can ﬁnd that a very important aspect that is not sufﬁciently stressed in lit-
erature is the dynamic one, related to designing affordances, with respect to their
evolutionary framework: human and non-human animals can “modify” or “cre-
ate” affordances by manipulating their cognitive niches. Moreover, it is obvious to
note that human, biological bodies themselves evolve: and so I can guess that even
the more basic and wired perceptive affordances available to our ancestors were
very different from the present ones.2 Of course different affordances can also be
1 This idea can also be connected to the concept of cognitive ﬂuidity argued by Mithen
[1996]. From the perspective of cognitive palaeoanthropology, Mithen claimed that the
modern mind is characterized by the capacity of applying to heterogeneous domains forms
of thinking originally designed for speciﬁc tasks. He also contends that in hominids this
change originated through a blend of two different intelligence domains, namely, that of
internal representations entities and external artifacts [Magnani, 2006a].
2 The term “wired” can be easily misunderstood. Generally speaking, I accept the distinction
between cognitive aspects that are “hardwired” and those which are simply “pre-wired”.
By the former term I refer to those aspects of cognition which are ﬁxed in advance and
not modiﬁable. Conversely, the latter term refers to those abilities that are built-in prior
the experience, but that are modiﬁable in later individual development and through the
process of attunement to relevant environmental cues: the importance of development,
and its relation with plasticity, is clearly captured thanks to the above distinction. Not all
aspects of cognition are pre-determined by genes and hard-wired components.

detected in children, and in the whole realm of animals. I will come back to this
issue in section 4.4.
4.2
The Two Views on Affordance: The Ecological and the
Constructivist Approach at Stake
4.2.1
The Two Views
The theory of affordance potentially re-conceptualizes the traditional view of the
relationship between action and perception according to which we extract from the
environment those information which build up the mental representation that in turn
guides action [Marr, 1982]. From an ecological perspective, the distinction between
action and perception is questioned. The notion of affordance contributes to shed
light on that issue fairly expanding it.
I posit that the Gibsonian ecological perspective originally achieves two impor-
tant results. First of all, human and animal agencies are somehow hybrid, in the
sense that they strongly rely on the environment and on what it offers. Secondly,
Gibson provides a general framework about how organisms directly perceive objects
and their affordances. His hypothesis is highly stimulating: “[...] the perceiving of
an affordance is not a process of perceiving a value-free physical object [...] it is
a process of perceiving a value-rich ecological object”, and then, “physics may be
value free, but ecology is not” [Gibson, 1979, p. 140]. These two issues are related,
although some authors seem to have disregarded their complementary nature. It is
important here to clearly show how these two issues can be considered two faces of
the same medal.
We may provide alternative descriptions of the world: the one speciﬁed by af-
fordances represents the environment in terms of action possibilities. I have already
cited Vicente [2003] arguing that affordances a way of measuring or representing
the environment with respect to the action capabilities of an individual. Taking a
step further, I may claim that affordances are chances that are ecologically rooted.
They are ecological rooted because they rely on the mutuality between an agent (or
a perceiver) and the environment. As ecological chances, affordances are the result
of a hybridizing process in which the perceiver meets the environment. The empha-
sized stress on the mutuality between the perceiver and the environment provides a
clear evidence of this point.
In his research Gibson basically referred to “direct” perception, which does not
require the internal inferential mediation or processing by the agent. Donald Norman
from Human Computer Interaction studies challenged the original Gibsonian notion
of affordance also involving mental/internal processing: “I believe that affordances
result from the mental interpretation of things, based on our past knowledge and
experience applied to our perception of the things about us” [Norman, 1988, p. 14].
It appears clear that in this case affordances depend on the organism’s experience,
learning, and full cognitive abilities, i. e. they are not independent of them, like Gib-
son maintained. For example infants 12 to 22 weeks old already show complicated

82
4 Building Cognitive Niches: The Role of Affordances
cognitive abilities of this type, as reported by Rader and Vaughn [2000]. These abil-
ities allow them to lean on prior experience of an object and therefore detect what
Rader and Vaughn call “hidden affordances”. As argued by these authors, hidden
affordances are those affordances speciﬁed by the information not available at the
time of the interaction, but drawn from past experiences [Rader and Vaughn, 2000,
p. 539]. The same event or place can have different affordances to different organ-
isms but also multiple affordances to the same organism. Following D. Norman’s
perspective, affordances suggest a range of chances: given the fact that artifacts are
complex things and their affordances normally require high-level supporting infor-
mation, it is more fruitful to study them following this view.
To give an example, perceiving the full range of the affordances of a door re-
quires complex information about for example direction of opening or about its
particular pull. Becoming attuned to invariants and disturbances often goes beyond
the mere Gibsonian direct perception and higher representational and mental pro-
cesses of thinking/learning have to be involved.3 This means that for example in
designing an artifact to the aim of properly and usefully exhibiting its full range of
affordances I have to clearly distinguish among two levels: 1) the construction of
the utility of the object and 2) the delineation of the possible (and correct) percep-
tual information/cues that deﬁne the available affordances of the artifact. They can
be more or less easily be undertaken by the user/agent [Gaver, 1991; Warren, 1995;
McGrenere and Ho, 2000]: “In general, when the apparent affordances of an arti-
fact match its intended use, the artifact is easy to operate. When apparent affor-
dances suggest different actions than those for which the object is designed, errors
are common and signs are necessary” [Gaver, 1991, p. 80]. In this last case affor-
dances are apparent because they are simply “not seen”. In this sense information
arbitrate the perceivability of affordances, and we know that available information
often goes beyond what it can be provided by direct perception but instead involves
higher cognitive endowments.
Vicente contends that it has to be said that of course it is impossible to think
that direct perception can explain all psychological phenomena, like mainly Gibso-
nian researchers seem to maintain. Moreover, according to Reed, the opinion that
mediated perception or cognition is inconsistent with Gibson’s view of ecological
psychology is “simply mistaken” [Reed, 1988, p. 305], like the following passage
by Gibson would clearly illustrate:
At least three separate levels [of theorizing] will be required: ﬁrst, a theory of how
we perceive the surfaces of objects [. . . ]; second, a theory of how we perceive repre-
sentations, pictures, displays, and diagrams; and third, a theory of how we apprehend
symbols. There is no reason to suppose that the physiological concomitants of all these
experiences will be the same; in fact, since pictures and symbols presuppose objects,
their physiological explanations will probably have to be found at increasing levels of
complexity [Gibson, 1951, p. 413].
3 Some authors [Turvey and Shaw, 2001; Hammond et al., 1987] pointed out that high-level
organisms’ cognitive processes like those referred to language, inference, learning, and the
use of symbols would have to be accounted for by a mature ecological psychology.

4.2 The Two Views on Affordance
83
Of course Gibson manly preferred to study the ﬁrst of the three categories of theo-
ries, related to relatively narrow psychological phenomena.
4.2.2
Confronting the Evidences
The hypothesis that the representation we have of the world includes also ecolog-
ical chances for action, namely affordances, has been investigated from a neuro-
anatomical perspective. Although neuro-anatomical evidences do not provide a
conclusive argument, they have contributed to shed light on some aspects about af-
fordance that otherwise would have remained highly hypothetical or, at least, based
on partial conjectures.
It is J. Norman who, taking advantage of a wholly neuropsychological perspec-
tive, tries to account for a reconciliation of the two approaches above (ecological and
constructivist). They resort to two cortical visual systems, the ﬁrst of which he calls
dorsal – hardwired, direct and active, less representational, without the recourse to
memory, and so expressing Gibson’s affordances – and the second ventral, which is
more representational and judgmental, indirect, and related to mentalistic processes,
and which basically performs different transformations of the available visual infor-
mation. Both systems perform different functions, and, present consciousness at
different degrees (for example the ventral system brings the relevant information,
picked up in a more unconscious way by the dorsal system, to conscious aware-
ness). Finally, both systems analyze the visual input, but the analysis is carried out
for different purposes. Certainly both systems deal with object shapes, sizes, and
distances, but
The primary function of the ventral system would seem the recognition and identiﬁca-
tion of the visual input. Recognition and identiﬁcation must depend on some compar-
ison with some stored representations. In contrast, the primary function of the dorsal
system is analysis of the visual input in order to allow visually guided behavior vis
`a vis the environment and objects in it (e.g. painting, reaching, grasping, walking to-
wards or through, climbing, etc.). [. . . ] Thus, when one picks up a hammer, the control
and monitoring of the actual movements is by the dorsal system but there also oc-
curs intervention of the ventral system that recognizes the hammer as such and directs
the movement towards picking up the hammer by the handle and not by the head
[Norman, 2002, p. 84].
The two visual systems are highly integrated, and one may say that the distinc-
tion works at an anatomical level. But, if highly integrated, how does the transition
between one another come about? How to explain the switch between the motor
processing and the visual processing? Young [2006] questioned Norman’s view ac-
cording to which there would be an alignment of affordances with the dorsal stream.
He claimed that only certain affordances are processed along the dorsal stream. This
seems to suggest a more complicated classiﬁcation of affordances depending upon
their respective neurological underpinnings, but also – I would add – their cognitive

84
4 Building Cognitive Niches: The Role of Affordances
meaning. Recent studies on patients affected by brain damage that impaired dorsal
or ventral stream have contributed to shed light on that issue.4
Consider for instance visual agnosia. Visual agnosia is caused by damage of the
ventral stream of one’s visual system [Milner and Goodale, 1995], which impedes
patients to consciously experience objects and access semantic knowledge related to
them. Empirical studies reported that patients suffering from visual agnosia are still
able to perform certain tasks that require the detection of simple affordances, for in-
stance, holding and grasping pliers. However, the same patients showed the inability
of understanding how to use instruments to accomplish more skilled tasks, for ex-
ample, clasping the handles to manipulate jaws [Carey et al., 1996]. As argued by
Young [2006], that inability may be due to the lack of functional knowledge required
to skillfully manipulate objects, which heavily depends on previous experiences.
The role of information provided by past experience suggests the involvement of
ventral stream in detecting more complex affordances as reported by Milner [2001].
Consider now the case of optic ataxia (dorsal stream impaired). Patients suffering
from optic ataxia were able to pantomime a grasp of an object, if seen earlier, and
thus retained in memory. They overcame their visuomotor deﬁcit by relying on an
off-line guidance neurologically based on the ventral stream, which, in turn, pro-
vides memory-based information.
What they lack is therefore the ability to unconsciously adjust ongoing move-
ments that seems to suggest the existence of an automatic pilot, which in this
case results impaired [Himmelbach et al., 2006, p. 2750]. That is, patients success-
fully interact with the object by retrieving past information stored in their mem-
ory [Milner et al., 2001] instead of picking them up upon occasion. As put it by
[Himmelbach and Karnath, 2005, p. 633], “[...] the contribution of ventral system
increases as the delay between target presentation and movement execution gets
longer” . This introduces a division of labor between dorsal and ventral system in al-
lowing people to interact with their environment. From this perspective affordances
processed along the dorsal stream are merely picked up unconsciously, “whereas
those processed via the ventral stream constitute one aspect of the content of the
subject’s phenomenal experience, although I accept that this does not mean that the
subject must be reﬂectively aware of such content” [Young, 2006, p. 141].
Taking a step further, I may argue that the ventral stream acquires importance
when detecting affordances relies more on functional knowledge just like the case
of hidden affordances I previously introduced. Here, detecting hidden affordances
is the result of an inferential/mental activity which clearly relies on semantic
4 From a methodological perspective, the so-called “double- dissociation of function” con-
stitutes a major evidence for the existence of neurologically distinct functional systems.
Generally speaking, double dissociation is considered a strong neurological evidence when
a lesion of structure X [ventral stream] will speciﬁcally disrupt function A [functional
knowledge] while sparing function B [manipulation of an object], and a lesion of struc-
ture Y [dorsal stream] will speciﬁcally affect function B [manipulation of an object] while
function A would remain intact [functional knowledge]. For a critical point of view on
double-dissociation and the two visual systems, see Pisella et al. [Pisella et al., 2006].

4.3 The Breadth of Abductive Cognition

information (functional knowledge) that come from past experience and, indeed,
depend on a learning process.5
Indeed, people may even make automatic the process of detecting a hidden affor-
dance, once they are got used to it. For instance, patients with lesions of the ventral
stream have preserved ability to make gestures in response to visually presented ob-
jects. However, this happens only with familiar objects [Decety and Gr`ezes, 2006].
Conversely, when presented unfamiliar objects patients with the ventral stream im-
paired are unable to perform a correct grasp. In this case, affordances are not readily
available, but they require an additional mediation that in those patients cannot be
activated, since the ventral stream results impaired. This seems to suggest that fa-
miliarity, and thus ontogenetic process like learning, can really make the difference
in understanding the division of labor between ventral and dorsal stream. Moreover,
it contributes to shed light on the evolutionary dimension of affordance that has been
often discarded. I will come back to this point in section 4.3.
4.3
The Breadth of Abductive Cognition
A hundred years ago, Peirce [1931–1958] coined the concept of abduction in or-
der to illustrate that the process of scientiﬁc discovery is not irrational and that a
methodology of discovery is possible. Peirce interpreted abduction essentially as
an “inferential” creative process of generating a new hypothesis. Abduction has a
logical form (fallacious, if we model abduction by using classical syllogistic logic)
distinct from deduction and induction. Reasoning which starts from reasons and
looks for consequences is called deduction; that which starts from consequences
and looks for reasons is called abduction.
Magnani [2001] deﬁnes abduction as the process of inferring certain facts and/or
laws and hypotheses that render some sentences plausible, that explain or discover
some (eventually new) phenomenon or observation; it is the process of reasoning in
which explanatory hypotheses are formed and evaluated. An example of abduction
is the method of inquiring employed by detectives: in this case we do not have
direct experience of what we are taking about. Say, we did not see the murderer
killing the victim. But we infer that given certain signs or clues, a given fact must
have happened. More generally, we guess a hypothesis that imposes order on data.
According to Magnani [2001], there are two main epistemological meanings of
the word abduction: 1) abduction that only generates “plausible” hypotheses (“se-
lective” or “creative”) and 2) abduction considered as inference “to the best expla-
nation”, which also evaluates hypotheses. An illustration from the ﬁeld of medical
knowledge is represented by the discovery of a new disease and the manifestations
5 Also Gibson suggested, as I have already pointed out, that “the process of pickup is postu-
lated to be very susceptible to development and learning. The opportunities for educating
attention, for exploring and adjusting, for extracting are unlimited. The increasing capac-
ity of a perceptual system to pick up information, however, does not in itself constitute
information”[Gibson, 1979, p. 250].

86
4 Building Cognitive Niches: The Role of Affordances
it causes which can be considered as the result of a creative abductive inference.
Therefore, “creative” abduction deals with the whole ﬁeld of the growth of scien-
tiﬁc knowledge. This is irrelevant in medical diagnosis where instead the task is to
“select” from an encyclopedia of pre-stored diagnostic entities. We can call both
inferences ampliative, selective and creative, because in both cases the reasoning
involved ampliﬁes, or goes beyond, the information incorporated in the premises
[Magnani, 1992b].
Abduction can fairly account for some crucial theoretical aspects of hypothesis
generation as well as manipulative ones. Accordingly, Magnani [2001] distinguishes
between two general abductions, theoretical abduction and manipulative abduction.
Theoretical abduction illustrates much of what is important in creative abductive
reasoning, in humans and in computational programs. It regards verbal/symbolic in-
ferences, but also all those inferential processes which are model-based and related
to the exploitation of internalized models of diagrams, pictures, etc.
Theoretical abduction does not account for all those processes of hypothesis gen-
eration relying on a kind of “discovering through doing”, in which new and still
unexpressed information is codiﬁed by means of manipulations of some external
objects (epistemic mediators). These inferential processes are deﬁned by manipu-
lative abduction which, conversely, is the process of inferring new hypotheses or
explanation occurring when the exploitation of environment is crucial. More gener-
ally, manipulative abduction occurs when many external things, usually inert from
the semiotic point of view, can be transformed into “cognitive mediators” that give
rise - for instance in the case of scientiﬁc reasoning - to new signs, new chances for
interpretants, and new interpretations.
Therefore, manipulative abduction represents a kind of redistribution of the epis-
temic and cognitive effort to manage objects and information that cannot be im-
mediately represented or found internally (for example exploiting the resources
of visual imagery).6 If the structures of the environment play such an important
role in shaping our semiotic representations and, hence, our cognitive processes,
we can expect that physical manipulations of the environment receive a cognitive
relevance.
This distinction contributes to going beyond a conception of abduction, which
is merely logical, say, related only to its sentential and computational dimension,
towards a broader semiotic dimension worth investigating. Peirce himself fairly
noted that the all thinking is in signs, and signs can be icons, indices, or sym-
bols. In this sense, all inference is a form of sign activity, where the word sign
includes “feeling, image, conception, and other representation” [Peirce, 1931–1958,
5.283]. This last consideration clearly depicts the semiotic dimension of abduc-
tion, which will be crucial in deepening the relationship between abduction and
affordance.
I strongly agree with Magnani [2009] who posits that abduction contributes to
shedding light on a wide range of phenomena – from perception to higher forms
6 It is difﬁcult to preserve precise spatial relationships using mental imagery, especially
when one set of them has to be moved relative to another.

4.3 The Breadth of Abductive Cognition
87
of cognition – which otherwise would not be appropriately considered and under-
stood. In the previous section I illustrated the problem with affordances, whether
they are directly perceived or mediated by higher cognitive processes. Abduction
clariﬁes this issue in the sense that it goes beyond the traditional conception, which
contrasts automatic or spontaneous response and perception, on one hand, with me-
diated inferences and more plastic and reasoned forms of cognition, on the other.
Apparently, the difference does not seem to reside in the underlying processes (me-
diated or not), but the different cognitive endowments organisms (humans included)
can take advantage and make use of. In this sense, it is better to distinguish two
different aspects of the same problem. First of all, the word inference is not ex-
hausted by its logical/higher cognitive aspects but also refers to the effect of various
sensorial activities [Magnani, 2009]. Secondly the ability to make use of various
cognitive endowments (instinctual or plastic), which is ultimately connected to ab-
duction, is an evolving property. That is, it is open to improvements, modiﬁcation,
and evolution.
Perceptual judgment is the best example to illustrate that it is not only conscious
abstract thought that we can consider inferential (cf. Magnani [2009]). Indeed, per-
ceptual judgment is meant to be a spontaneous and automatic response, which is
connected to various cognitive endowments, which are “instinctual” and hard-wired
by evolution. Seeing is meant to be a direct form of cognition, which does not need
any kind of mediation, since it happens without thinking – almost instantaneously.
However, what about the case in which stimuli appear to be ambiguous, say, they
need to be disambiguated (for instance, a face which is half familiar half not)? Usu-
ally, as we get more and more clues, we get a clearer picture about who is the person
approaching us. That is symptomatic of the fact that perceptual judgment is a sign-
activity, namely, abduction. Indeed the perceptions we have cannot be deliberately
controlled the way scientiﬁc inferences are. We do not have any conscious access
to them. However, perceptions are always withdrawable, just like the case we are
presenting, our perceptual judgment can be subjected to changes and modiﬁcations,
as we acquire more clues/signs. In this sense, I may say that what we see is what
our visual apparatus can, “explain” [Rock, 1982; Thagard, 1988; Hoffman, 1998;
Magnani, 2001].7 That is, people are very got used to impose order on various,
even ambiguous, stimuli, which can be considered “premises” of the involved ab-
duction [Magnani, 2001, p. 107]. More generally, those forms of cognition just like
perceptual judgment are still abduction, even though, as brilliantly Peirce noted,
they tend “to obliterate all recognition of the uninteresting and complex premises”
from which they was derived [Peirce, 1931–1958, 7.37]. In this sense, percep-
tual judgment is only apparently a not-mediated process: it is semi-encapsulated
in the sense that it is not insulated from “knowledge” (cf. Raftopoulos [2001a;
2001b] and Magnani [2001; 2009]).
7 Recently, Thagard [2010] claimed that perception cannot be described as abductive. He
argued that perception involves some neuropsychological processes that do not ﬁt with
the deﬁnition of abduction as the process of generation and evaluation of explanatory
hypotheses.

88
4 Building Cognitive Niches: The Role of Affordances
Another example supporting the semi-encapsulated nature of perception is pro-
vided by those perceptual judgments made by the experts.8 Consider a professional
meteorologist. What a trained meteorologist sees when looking at the sky clearly
goes beyond what ordinary people see. They just see clouds, whereas a meteorol-
ogist would see various types and subtypes of clouds (cirrus clouds, altocumulus
clouds, and many more) revealing a great deal about how the weather will evolve
over the course of the next few hours. Thanks to the training they received, meteo-
rologists as experts are able to spontaneously impose order over an additional range
of signs coming from the sky, which are learnt and knowledge-dependent. Once
familiar with a particular set of signs, then perceptual judgment proceeds automat-
ically and with no further testing, although this may require a long period of study
and training if sophisticated knowledge is involved.

Affordances as Abductive Anchors: Going beyond the Two
Views
As already mentioned, Gibson deﬁnes affordance as what the environment offers,
provides, or furnishes. For instance, a chair affords an opportunity for sitting, air
breathing, water swimming, stairs climbing, and so on. But what does that exactly
mean from an abductive perspective I introduced so far?
Within an abductive framework, that a chair affords sitting means we can perceive
some clues (robustness, rigidity, ﬂatness) from which a person can easily say “I can
sit down”. Now, suppose the same person has another object O, and she/he can only
perceive its ﬂatness. He/she does not know if it is rigid and robust, for instance.
Anyway, he/she decides to sit down on it and he/she does that successfully. Is there
any difference between the two cases?
I claim the two cases should be distinguished: in the ﬁrst one, the cues we come
up with (ﬂatness, robustness, rigidity) are highly diagnostic to know whether or not
we can sit down on it, whereas in the second case we eventually decide to sit down,
but we do not have any precise clue about. How many things are there that are ﬂat,
but one cannot sit down on? A nail head is ﬂat, but it is not useful for sitting. That
is to say, that in the case of the chair, the signs we come up with are “highly diag-
nostic”. That is, affordances can be related to the variable (degree of) abductivity
of a conﬁguration of signs: a chair affords sitting in the sense that the action of
sitting is a result of a sign activity in which we perceive some physical properties
(ﬂatness, rigidity, etc.), and therefore we can ordinarily “infer” (in Peircean sense)
that a possible way to cope with a chair is sitting on it.
More generally, the original Gibsonian notion of affordance deals with those
situations in which the signs and clues we can detect prompt or suggest a
8 The so-called visual abductions [Magnani, 2001] are essential also in science in which
new and interesting discoveries are generated through some kind of visual-model based
reasoning. On this topic, see for instance Shelley [1996] and Gooding [2004]. Bertolotti
and Magnani [2010] discuss visual abduction in the generation of beliefs in super-natural
agents.

4.4 Affordances as Abductive Anchors: Going beyond the Two Views
89
certain action (or exploitation) rather than others. In this sense, I maintain
that ﬁnding/constructing affordances deals with a (semiotic) inferential activity
[Windsor, 2004; Magnani, 2009]. Indeed, we may be afforded by the environment,
if we can detect those signs and cues from which we may abduce the presence of a
given affordance [Magnani and Bardone, 2008].
There are a number of points I should now make clear. They will help us clar-
ify the idea of affordances as abductive anchors. First of all, an affordance can be
considered as a hypothetical sign conﬁguration. An affordance is neither the result
of an abduction nor the clues (in Gibsonian terms, the information specifying the
affordance). I contend that an affordance informs us about an environmental symp-
tomaticity, meaning that through a hypothetical process we recognize that the envi-
ronment suggests for us and, at the same time, enables us to behave a certain way.
We can do something with the environment, we can have a certain interaction, we
can exploit the resources ecologically available in a certain way. This is particularly
interesting if we go back to the issue I introduced in the ﬁrst section about how to
transform the environment from a source of constraints to a source of resources. In
that section I pointed out that the human agent (like any other living organism) tries
to attain a stable and functional relationship with their surroundings. I now claim
that affordances invite us to couple with the environment by informing us about
possible symptomaticities. In doing so, affordances become anchors transforming
the environment into an abductive texture that helps us establish and maintain a
functional relationship with it.
The second point worth mentioning is related to how the human agent regulates
his relationship with his environment. I have partly answered this question. My idea
is that the human agent abductively regulates his relationship with the environment.
That is, the human agent is constantly engaged in controlling his own behavior
through continuous manipulative activity. Such manipulative activity (which is eco-
cognitive one) hangs on to abductive anchors, namely, affordances that permit the
human agent to take some part of the environment as local representatives of some
other. So, the human agent operates in the presence of abductive anchors, namely,
affordances, that stabilize environmental uncertainties by directly signaling some
pre-associations between the human agent and the environment (or part of it).
The third point is that an affordance should not be confused with a resource. I
have just argued that an affordance is what informs us that the environment may
support a certain action so that a resource can be exploited. Going back to the exam-
ple of the chair, I contend that an affordance is what informs us that we can perform a
certain action in the environment (sitting) in order to exploit part of it as a resource
(the chair). This is coherent with the idea introduced by Gibson and later devel-
oped by some other authors who see an affordance as an “action possibility” (see
section 4.1.2).
The idea that an affordance is not a resource but rather, something that offers in-
formation about one, allows it to be seen as anything involving some eco-cognitive
dimension. That is, insofar as we gain information onenvironmental symptomatic-
ity environmental symptomaticity to exploit a latent resource, then we have an
affordance.

4 Building Cognitive Niches: The Role of Affordances
Generally, speaking, being or not being afforded by external objects is something
related to:
1. the various instinctual or hard-wired endowments hardwired behavior humans
are already attuned to,
and
2. the various plastic cognitive endowments prewired behavior they have attuned
to by learning or, more generally, they can make use of by using past knowledge
and/or more sophisticated internalplasticity operations.
In the ﬁrst case, affordances are already available and belong to the normality of the
adaptation of an organism to a given ecological niche. Thus, in most cases detecting
an affordance is a spontaneous abduction because this chance is already present in
the perceptual endowments of human and non-human animals. That is to say, there
are affordances that are somehow pre-wired and thus neurally pre-speciﬁed like
action codes which are activated automatically by visual stimuli. This is, indeed,
coherent to what Gibsonian conception refers to.
Organisms have at their disposal a standard (instinctual) endowment of affor-
dances (for instance through their wired sensory system), but at the same time they
can extend and modify the range of what can afford them through the appropri-
ate cognitive abductive skills (which are more or less sophisticated). That is to say,
some affordance relies on prior knowledge, which cannot be available at the time of
the interaction, as already mentioned.
The fact that complex affordances would require the appropriate cognitive skills
and knowledge to be detected does not mean to say they cease to be affordances,
strictly speaking. As pointed out in section 4.2.2, familiarity is a key component to
the involvement of the dorsal stream, which makes it easier to detect affordances.
The term “familiarity” covers a wide range of situations in which affordance detec-
tion becomes almost automatic – coherently with the Gibsonian view – even if it
requires an additional mediation of previous knowledge and even training.
That is the case of experts. Experts take advantage of their advanced knowledge
within a speciﬁc domain to detect signs and clues that ordinary people cannot de-
tect. Here again, a patient affected by pneumonia affords a physician in a completely
different way compared with that of any other non medical person. Being abductive,
the process of perceiving affordances mostly relies on a continuous activity of hy-
pothesizing which is cognition-related. That A affords B to C can also be considered
from a semiotic perspective as follows: A signiﬁes B to C. A is a sign, B the object
signiﬁed, and C the interpretant. Having cognitive skills (for example knowledge
content and inferential capacities but also suitable wired sensory endowments) in a
certain domain enables the interpretant to perform certain abductive inferences from
signs (namely, perceiving affordances) that are not available to people not possess-
ing those tools. To ordinary people a cough or chest pain are not diagnostic, because
they do not know what the symptoms of pneumonia or other diseases related to
cough and chest pain are. Thus, they cannot make any abductive inference of this
kind.

4.5 Adapting Affordances and Cognitive Niche Enrichment
91
Humans may take advantage of additional affordances, which are not built-in,
so to speak, but have become stabilized. Now one important point should be added
in. The possibility of displaying certain abductive skills depends also on those plas-
tic endowments, which have been created and manufactured for a speciﬁc pur-
pose. In this sense, the possibility of creating and then stabilizing affordances
relies on the various transmission and inheritance systems that humans (but also
other non-human creatures) display. That is, affordances are stabilized with recourse
to a variety of means using, for instance, genetic but also behavioral and/or sym-
bolic helpers. Environments change and so do perceptive capacities, when enriched
through new or higher-level cognitive skills, which go beyond the ones granted by
merely instinctual levels.
This dynamics explains the fact that if affordances are usually stabilized this does
not mean they cannot be modiﬁed and changed and that new ones can be formed.
Affordances are also subjected to changes and modiﬁcations. Some of them can be
discarded, because new conﬁgurations of the cognitive environmental niche (for ex-
ample new artifacts) are invented with more powerful offered affordances. Consider,
for instance, the case of blackboards. Progressively, teachers and instructors have
partly replaced them with new artifacts which exhibit affordances brought about
by various tools, for example, slide presentations. In some cases, the affordances
of blackboards have been totally re-directed or re-used to more speciﬁc purposes.
For instance, one may say that a logical theorem is still easier to be explained and
understood by using a blackboard, because of its affordances that give a temporal,
sequential, and at the same time global perceptual depiction to the matter.
If framed within an evolutionary dimension, the difference between the two op-
posing views ceases to form a radical objection to the theory of affordance. As
just mentioned, we manipulate the environment and thus go beyond the merely in-
stinctual levels adding new or higher-level cognitive skills. The case of stabilized
affordances clearly shows that at a neuro-anatomical level a re-distribution between
the dorsal and the ventral stream occurs (cf. the last part of section 4.2.2).
4.5
Adapting Affordances and Cognitive Niche Enrichment
In the previous chapter I introduced the notion of cognitive niche enrichment. One
of the issues that particular notion is supposed to address is the one concerning
progress and innovation. That is, our cognitive niches may collapse (see section
2.6), but also develop and progress. Cognitive niche enrichment is the phenomenon
describing those situations in which a cognitive niche is enhanced. In this section,
I will describe the process of cognitive niche enrichment in connection with affor-
dance. More precisely, I will go back to the case of Ambient Intelligence presented
in section 3.4 to show how relevant the notion of affordance can be in discussing
Ambient Intelligence as an example of cognitive niche enrichment. As it will be
clear from the following, my take is that Ambient Intelligence enriches our cogni-
tive niches by providing new forms of what I call “adapting affordances”.

92
4 Building Cognitive Niches: The Role of Affordances
4.5.1
Adapting Affordances
Part of the affordances available are delivered by other human beings. Other human
beings are so important because they deliver a special kind of affordance, which
Ambient Intelligence tries to mimic. These affordances can be called adapting af-
fordances. As just stated, affordance detection relies on abductive skills that allow
us to infer possible ways to cope with an object or situation. In the case of affor-
dances furnished by other people, the process of detection may be further mediated
by social interaction. That is, other people may provide us with additional clues to
help us better exploit environmental chances, namely, hidden or latent affordances
[Gibson and Pick, 2000].
Care-giving is an example of what I am talking about. As a matter of fact, babies
are heavily dependent on other human beings from the very beginning of their exis-
tence. They would not survive without constant care administrated by their parents.
More precisely, caregivers assist infants in turning the environment into something
they can handle by means of learning [Gibson and Pick, 2000]. In doing so they con-
stantly adapt their behavior to create suitable action possibilities that infants can be
easily afforded by [Gibson and Pick, 2000]. Caregivers, for instance, contribute to
expanding the basic repertoire a newborn is equipped with by manipulating her/his
attention. In doing so they prevent the baby from expensive and exhaustive trial and
error activities. For example, caregivers:
• act for the infant embodying motions that she/he should perform;
• they show what the infant is supposed to do;
• they offer demonstrations providing gestures so that
• they direct the infant’s attention to relevant aspects of the environment
[Zukow-Goldring and Arbib, 2007].
The inﬂuence people have is not limited to care-giving activities. There are a number
of situations in which people exhibit the capacity to adaptively alter the representa-
tion other fellow humans may have of something. Another example is the so-called
intentional gaze [Frischen et al., 2007; Frischen et al., 2009]. Recent ﬁndings have
shown that intentional gaze confers additional properties to a given object, which
would not be on display if not looked at [Becchio et al., 2007]. Gaze-following be-
havior affects the way an object is processed by our motor-cognitive system. More
precisely, intentional gaze changes the representation of an object, not merely by
shifting attention, but by enriching it with “motor emotive and status components”
[Becchio et al., 2007, p. 257].
From a theoretical perspective we may argue that human beings function as a kind
of adapting task-transforming representation. The term “task-transforming repre-
sentation” was introduced by Hutchins [1995] to refer to the fact that external ar-
tifacts shape the structure of a task – its representation – helping people solve the
problem they are facing. A tool may transform the structure of a task:
1. redistributing the cognitive load;
2. rearranging constraints and action possibilities;

4.5 Adapting Affordances and Cognitive Niche Enrichment
93
3. unearthing additional computational abilities;
4. increasing the number of operations while reducing mental costs.
In the case of adapting affordances, the cognitive load is reduced by means of a
transformation [de Leon, 2002], which adapts the structure/representation of the
task to allow a person to detect latent environmental chances. Caregivers and the
intentional gaze are fair examples, as they show how people adaptively manipulate
the representations their fellows have of the environment to favor or facilitate the
exploitation of latent affordances.
4.5.2
Ambient Intelligence and Adapting Affordances
As already argued, Ambient Intelligence can be considered as “cognitive niche en-
richment” because of the way it enriches our cognitive niches, that is, by populating
them with devices able to keep track of what we do, and then adjust their response
adaptively. These various devices are thought to deliver affordances that are some-
how adapting.
Adapting affordances are those affordances that help the agent exploit latent envi-
ronmental possibilities providing additional clues. As I have already pointed out, an
affordance may be hidden for a number of reasons. For instance, one may lack the
proper knowledge required to detect an affordance at the moment of acting. On the
other hand, it might remain hidden because of the ambiguity of certain sign conﬁg-
uration so that the agent’s function is not immediately intuitive. Finally, affordances
may prove unavailable just because a certain person suffers from some impairment
– temporary or otherwise – that prevents her from exploiting some particular envi-
ronmental offerings.
AmI may enrich one’s experience of her environment in a number of ways. In
the following I am going to present three main cases in which our experience is
enriched with respect to three “modalities”. AmI may eco-cognitively enrich our
ability to 1) sense, 2) act, and 3) reason or make decisions. This general classiﬁcation
is indeed arbitrary and it is not meant to cover all the possible ways in which an agent
can interact with her environment. However, it may be useful when showing some
examples in which “adapting affordances” are provided, and looking at how they
enrich the experience of the agent’s environment.
The ﬁrst modality concerns our senses. Sensing something is the basic modality
through which we can interact with our environment, and it can basically be related
to haptic perception, visual perception, auditory perception, and tactile perception.
At times some of our senses may be impaired or less effective for a number of
reasons, consequently rendering a person less able to cope with her environment
the way she would like to. This happens for example to elderly people, who of-
ten suffer from pathologies that impoverish their senses, and thus their wellbeing.
Assisted living technologies are meant to give support to those people that have
various problems related to aging. An interesting example of Ambient intelligence
environment supporting sensing is provided by ALADIN. ALADIN is lighting sys-
tem designed to assist elderly people in the process of adjusting indoor lighting
[Maier and Kempter, 2009].

94
4 Building Cognitive Niches: The Role of Affordances
Generally speaking, light has an important impact on the wellbeing of a person.
It affects a number of activities that are indeed fundamental for us. Cognitive perfor-
mances like reading or concentrating may be drastically affected by light. Light also
affects sleep quality, the metabolic system and changes of mood. The impact of light
may acquire even greater importance for elderly people, who often have impaired
vision or suffer from limited mobility so that they remain at home for most of their
time [Maier and Kempter, 2009]. ALADIN is meant to assist them in designing and
maintaining indoor lighting.
Basically, ALADIN is capable of acquiring and analyzing information about “the
individual and situational differences of the psycho-physiological effects of light-
ing” [Maier and Kempter, 2009, p. 1201] so as to provide adaptations speciﬁc to the
user’s needs in her domestic environment. More precisely, the system constantly
monitors the user’s state through biosensors which measure various parameters –
elecrodermal, electrocardiographic, respiratory, and those related to body move-
ment. The data are transferred via bluetooth to the computer system and analyzed.
Then, according to the adaptive algorithms, the system tries to ﬁnd the best light
modiﬁcation. In fact, the best light modiﬁcation is reached by simple feedback pro-
vided by the user and from the biofeedbacks acquired through biosensors attached
to the user’s body.
As already mentioned, lighting may affect a person in a variety of ways, for in-
stance, in the preservation of an active and independent lifestyle or physical and
mental ﬁtness [Heschong, 2002]. For instance, elderly people are often unable to
correctly assess some internal states with great precision and to then act accordingly.
Reduced cognitive performances due to aging may also have a negative impact on
their sensing capacity. This, in turn, limits their ability to detect those affordances
enabling them to design and maintain suitable indoor lighting to enhancing some
activities like reading or relaxing. Biosensors monitor some physiological parame-
ters – as I have just mentioned – and provide some information. This information
may help the user modify their domestic light setting in a way that may eventually
make them aware of some physiological needs, for instance, the need to rest or have
more light in the room. In this sense, the various adjustments the system carries out
during a session clearly function like a “mediator” which unearths new environmen-
tal possibilities. That is, the system alters the representation of the user’s body in a
way that allows them to be better afforded by the lights.
The experience of our environment could also be improved, when we act on it. In
order to better grasp this point, we refer to the case of the guide sign system. Nav-
igating effectively through certain spaces such as university or hospital buildings
could become a problem, sometimes even involving negative emotions like anxi-
ety and tension. Generally, losing the way is annoying and it wastes so much time.
Therefore, having guide sign systems that can effectively assist a person to go where
they are supposed to go is extremely important.
Moving through a space can be considered as a cognitive task [Conlin, 2009],
in which one tries to make sense of the various detectable clues. This is especially
true for those spaces that can be labeled as meaningful, as they are intentionally
designed to bring people to certain places just like in the case of a hospital building.

4.5 Adapting Affordances and Cognitive Niche Enrichment
95
Meaningful spaces furnish people with a variety of clues, which should help them
ﬁnd the way. For instance, in hospitals the use of the uniform design or the use of
same materials and colors. Generally speaking, these clues and guide signs furnish
affordances that users can exploit in order to reach the place they are supposed to.
However, the information and clues that guide sign designers can scatter are lim-
ited given the various physical as well as cognitive constraints. Physical constraints
are given, for instance, by the fact that if space is limited so is the possibility of
locating signs. Cognitive constraints are due to the fact that sometimes having more
information may cause cognitive overload, and thus waste time. Therefore, affor-
dance detection may become a problem. Ambient intelligence can assist people, for
instance, in navigating space providing adapting affordances. Hye described and
tested a prototype of an interactive guide sign system meant to help people navi-
gate a hospital, constructing smart environments by means of various devices like
RFID (Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation), smart card, and wireless communication
[Hye, 2007]. In this case, the use of such devices provide additional affordances
that have the main role of helping users exploit latent environmental possibilities,
which in this case are basically guide signs.
Adapting affordances can assist people in contexts involving more complex
cognitive activities, for instance, reasoning and decision-making. An interest-
ing example about how Ambient Intelligence may help people is illustrated by
[Eng et al., 2005]. Using a learning model called “distributed adaptive control”
(DAC), Eng and colleagues have designed intelligent environments supporting an
interactive entertainment deployed at the Swiss national exhibition Expo.02. DAC
was designed to inﬂuence the behavior of visitors by learning how to scatter cues so
as to make some areas of the exhibition – often avoided or disregarded by the visi-
tors – more visible and easier to reach. Here again, the contribution of the so-called
smart environment is to adaptively adjust the system response with respect to what
the visitors and users know by furnishing the proper signs.
Another example is provided by the Glass Bottom Float project (GBF), which
aims to inform beach visitors about water quality so as to increase the pleasure of
swimming [Bohlen and Frei, 2009]. Basically, GBF is a beach robot monitoring a
number of parameters: water and air temperature, relative humidity, pH, conductiv-
ity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, etc., but also the speed of boats passing by, people
playing on the ﬂoat, and, more generally, underwater marine life. In addition, these
parameters are validated by opinions gathered from interviews with swimmers at
the beach.
It is worth noting that GBF, coupled with the use of SPM, is completely dif-
ferent from the other projects aiming to deliver information about water and air
quality. We know that both government agencies and ofﬁcial news releases provide
the user with similar data. However, what is interesting in the case of GBF is the
frequency and quality of the updates it delivers to the public. The way this is done is
completely different, and enriches one’s experience. For instance, the use of beach
visitor opinions potentially increases the reliability of the recommendations. This
enables a completely new way of distributing knowledge among beach visitors.

96
4 Building Cognitive Niches: The Role of Affordances
The data gathered are then processed using the so-called “swimming pleasure
measure” (SPM). Basically, the SPM makes predictions about the expected pleasure
people may have swimming on a certain beach. The recommendations generated by
the system are then delivered in real time to the public via mobile phones. In this
way, people can obtain important information before driving to the beach. Here
we have an example showing how our ability to formulate judgments and make
decisions can be supported and improved by information that would not otherwise
be available. More precisely, SPM provides us with additional clues that permit us
to be afforded by the local environment in order to make decisions and carry out
reasoning.
4.6
Why and When We Are Not Afforded
In section 4.4 I tried to illustrate how an abductive framework is particularly fruitful
in understanding the process of being afforded. The aim of this closing section is,
conversely, to survey a number of cases in which people are not afforded, and then
to explain why not. The interest in spelling out the reasons why people might be
not afforded resides on a very simple claim: a person not being afforded does not
necessarily mean that there are no affordances to detect.
I already pointed out that an affordance is a symptomatic conﬁguration of signs
informing a person about a way of exploiting the environment, meaning that the
environment enables her for cognitive coupling. If this is correct, then we should
distinguish between two cases: 1) when the sign conﬁguration is not symptomatic
to him/her; 2) when there are no sign conﬁgurations at all.
4.6.1
Hidden, Broken, and Failed Affordances
In this subsection I will brieﬂy illustrate several types of affordances: hidden affor-
dances, broken affordances, and failed affordances. Let me start with the ﬁrst type.
A person might not be afforded because she cannot make use of certain signs. Basi-
cally, this happens because he/she lacks the proper knowledge in terms of abductive
skills suitable for interpreting the signs or clues available in the environment. This
is the case of hidden affordances previously introduced in section 4.2.1.
One of the simplest examples of hidden affordances regards babies. Babies are
usually not afforded by their parents’ environment, simply because they are still
developing the repertoire of skills necessary for detecting even simple affordances.
For example, infants of age 8-12 months are not yet able to detect the affordances of
a spoon for eating [Gibson and Pick, 2000]. They simply bang or wave the spoons
they are given. Indeed, using a spoon for eating requires a number of perception-
action skills that the infants are still developing.
From our perspective, the infants are not yet able to detect some affordances be-
cause their repertoire of abductive skills – pre-wired by evolution – requires a period
of training. That means that the brain structures underlying certain abductive skills,

4.6 Why and When We Are Not Afforded
97
even though already pre-determined at genetic level, have to be further speciﬁed by
the relevant experiences the infant has in an enriched environment [Marcus, 2004].
Another interesting case in which a person might be not afforded is provided by
so called broken affordances.9 Broken affordances regard all those people suffering
from brain damage or some other injury. The impairment may be temporary or per-
manent, either way they simply miss some affordances just because they lost some
crucial neural mechanism underlying those skills required to detect the affordances,
which otherwise would be immediately available to them. For instance, patients af-
fected by optic ataxia (dorsal stream impaired) are able to name an object appropri-
ately and recognize its function, but remain unable to grasp and locate it to exploit
its affordances. As already mentioned in section 4.2.2, what they lack is the ability to
unconsciously adjust ongoing movements something that seems to suggest the exis-
tence of an automatic pilot, which in this case is impaired [Himmelbach et al., 2006,
p. 2750]. In this case, damage to the dorsal stream prevents the patient from making
use of a number of wired abductive skills – mainly manipulative and kinesthetic –
which would have allowed him to detect the affordances available.
An affordance might not be detected because it is poorly designed so that a
person can hardly make use of it, meaning that the sign conﬁguration is poorly
symptomatic. In this case we have what I call failed affordances. As already
mentioned, Norman introduced the distinction between potential affordances and
perceived affordances precisely because he wanted to draw a line of demarcation
between merely potential chances and those that are actually exploited by the user
[Norman, 1999a]. He argued that only in the second case we do have affordances.
However, it is worth noting that it is nearly impossible to predict whether or not a
user will detect or perceive the affordances constructed by the designers.
Indeed, the cooperation between designers and users can be enhanced so as to
allow designers, for instance, to characterize and thus predict the most likely user
reaction. However, like any other activity involving a complex communicative act,
there are always design trade-offs [Sutcliffe, 2003] between user needs and environ-
ment constraints identifying not the optimal solution, but the satisfying one. Design
trade-offs simply indicate that some affordances intended by the designer cannot be
optimally constructed, meaning that an affordance, like a sign conﬁguration, might
be ambiguous to the user. If so, then the distinction between potential affordances
and perceived affordances starts blurring. Let me see how my conception of affor-
dance may be helpful to solve this problem.
As already pointed out, an affordance informs us about environmental symp-
tomaticity. That is, an affordance is a sign conﬁguration that is totally or scarcely
ambiguous so that we promptly infer that an environmental chance is available to
us. Therefore, the ambiguity of a sign conﬁguration can be a valuable indicator
to demarcate the boundaries of what can be called an affordance and what can-
not. However, it is worth noting that on some occasions the user fails to detect an
affordance simply because of design trade-offs. For we propose to use the term
failed affordances to indicate those situations in which a sign’s conﬁguration might
9 I derive this expression from Buccino et al. [2009].

98
4 Building Cognitive Niches: The Role of Affordances
favor some misunderstanding between designers and users as resulting from design
trade-offs. Notwithstanding the fact that they are ambiguous – to a certain extent,
failed affordances are still affordances, as their ambiguity is more a result of design
trade-offs than of the absence of symptomaticity. Failed affordances are common,
for instance, in HCI when designers simply fail to build a mediating structure – an
interface – able to communicate the intended use of an object.
4.6.2
Not Evolved and Not Created Affordances
In this last subsection I will consider affordances with relation to creativity and evo-
lution. My main claim is that a person may not be afforded by the local environment
in a certain way, just because there is nothing to be afforded by. This may happen
for two reasons. First of all, because a conﬁguration of signs supporting a certain
activity has not been discovered yet. Secondly, because that conﬁguration of signs
has not yet been selected by evolution; and maybe it never will be.
As regards the ﬁrst category, the fact that there is nothing to be afforded by sim-
ply means that our abilities as eco-cognitive engineers are limited. As already men-
tioned in the ﬁrst section, the limits of the agent’s adaptability correspond to his
limits in creating affordances. I have previously discussed failed affordances argu-
ing that the detection of environmental symptomaticities may be partly impaired
by ambiguity due to some design trade-offs. The ambiguity of a sign conﬁguration
may lead us to misunderstand how to exploit our local environment. It may take us
more time to detect some hidden chances, but that does not mean that we are to-
tally blind about them. By contrast, sometimes we simply lack any environmental
symptomaticities to make use of, because they are not present (yet).
More generally, I may view the creation of new affordances as part of the his-
tory of technology which humans are involved in as eco-cognitive engineers. In-
deed, the history of technology is a very interesting ﬁeld as it offers many examples
concerning affordance innovation and creation. An interesting example is provided
by the so-called paperless world. The digital revolution has drawn our attention to
fascinating scenarios in which digital technologies – like PCs or tablets – would
make paper documents useless or just something from the past. Actually, the history
of what we might call “the quest for the paperless world” is extremely interest-
ing when noting the amazing creativity of humans, but also some present limita-
tions [Sellen and Harper, 2002]. The advent of a paperless world has partly come
about, as digital technologies have created new affordances. Basically, designers
(and users) have unearthed chances for new interactions, in my terminology, new
symptomaticities. For instance, the paperless ofﬁce has provided new affordances
related to archiving, browsing and searching through documents, etc.. Designers
have been able to make a screen touchable enabling users to underline and manage
their notes in a completely new way.
However, some affordances are still missing or, at least, some affordances can-
not be reproduced in the digital. An interesting case worth mentioning here is pro-
vided by post-it notes. Post-it notes are crucial in everyone’s life for managing
personal information. More precisely, post-its help us store “information scraps”

4.6 Why and When We Are Not Afforded
99
[Bernstein et al., 2008]. Information scraps allow a person to hold a variety of per-
sonal information like for instance ideas, sketches, phone numbers and reminders,
like to-do lists. Generally speaking, information scraps contain all the personal in-
formation that is too unexpected or miscellaneous to be encoded or stored in other
forms than scribbled notes.
However simple they may seem, post-its are amazingly useful as they contain a
number of affordances that allow us to have access to a kind of information that
otherwise would be completely out of reach. For instance, a post-it is as ready-to-
use as a corner of a sheet of paper. But unlike the corner it is 1) portable, as it can
be put in a pocket, 2) it can be stuck on any other object like a computer monitor, a
door, a window, etc., or 3) it can be handed to somebody else.
Although there are a number of computer programs that have been appropriately
designed to help people take quick notes, the conclusion reached by Bernstein et al.
[2008] is that at the moment there are no computer applications able to surpass
post-its. By deﬁnition information scraps are taken down on the ﬂy, and usually a
computer program – whatever it is – it takes too long. For instance, even assuming
that we have our laptop already working and available to take a note, it forces us,
to make a type assignment or assign a category in order to make our note easily
retrievable [Bernstein et al., 2008]. But this is precisely what we do not need to do
when using a post-it. We do not need to think about how to categorize a certain
piece of information or about how to set a deadline. We simply assign a particular
meaning and a particular place to a particular pad of post-it so that it will be easily
accessible and retrievable later on. Plain and simple, no computer applications afford
us the way post-its do. In my terminology, designers have not yet ﬁgured out how
to embed in the digital those symptomaticies signaling the affordances of a post-
it. Here again the limits of being afforded are the limits of human beings as eco-
cognitive engineers.
As already mentioned, there is an additional reason why we are not afforded, that
is, when an affordance or a set of affordances have not been secured by evolution.
In section 4.4 I argued that some affordances do not seem to require any mediation
of knowledge, because they are already made available by evolution in terms of pre-
wired and thus neurally pre-speciﬁed responses to the environment. Let me make a
very simple example of affordances that are somehow secured by evolution, the case
of the opposable thumb. In this case, some hominids developed a particular adap-
tation enabling them to oppose the thumb to the palmar side of the foreﬁnger. That
was a fundamental step in evolution: the opposable thumb made available a num-
ber of affordances that were simply unavailable before, like, for instance, grasping,
handing, throwing, and so on. Those species that had not develop the opposable
thumb simply lack certain affordances. For them, a tree branch is not graspable,
they cannot pick something up and then throw it to hit an animal, and they cannot
climb a tree.
Another example is that one of the human-chimpanzee common ancestors, the
so-called Ardipithecus, had a grasping foot. However the hominid foot then evolved
so that our later ancestors lost it. Indeed, that loss made a number of affordances
unavailable, like those related, for example, with climbing trees or locomotion. In

100
4 Building Cognitive Niches: The Role of Affordances
fact we still miss them and we can only use our feet for walking or standing, but not
for grasping. This has a very simple consequence in that all the objects around us
are designed bearing in mind that we do not push a button or type using our feet and
we would simply miss such affordances, because they have been put out of reach by
evolution.
More generally, what the two examples point to is that evolution makes an or-
ganism develop different affordances. That is, there are certain sign conﬁgurations
that become meaningful for one organism, but not for others: evolution operates in
such a way as to allow certain organisms not to be afforded by certain things. In
this case, an achievement (that we can consider an adaptation) was not established,
simply because it was not proﬁtable for the organism.
4.7
Concluding Remarks
In this chapter I have shown how the notion of abduction can account for some of
the ambiguities of affordance. The main thesis put forward here is that affordance
concerns all those situations in which the signs and clues we can detect prompt or
suggest a certain action. In this way, a chair affords sitting in the sense that clues are
available from which we can infer (in the Pearcian sense) that we can sit down on
it. The process through which we perceive affordance is entirely abductive.
Humans can also create, modify, and – on some occasions – stabilize affordances
that, in turn, become a part of the eco-cognitive inheritance, which humans can take
advantage of in order to accomplish various tasks and activities. For ontogenetic
processes like social and individual learning play a key role in developing new ways
of interacting with the environment and better direct our adaptation. In doing so,
humans are involved in a continuous process of crafting and modifying ecological
niches aimed at developing new sets of affordances.
Indeed, some major issues still remain open to debate and need further develop-
ment. As argued in the second part of the chapter, I have tried to stress the evolution-
ary dimension of affordance, often discarded by researchers and scholars. The thesis
I have discussed is that some affordances are somehow pre-wired, whereas others
can be created and become stabilized over time. This particular issue can be split
in two. The ﬁrst part concerns integration between the ventral and dorsal stream.
How do they interact? Do familiarity and experience re-assign and re-distribute
functions to the two systems? As outlined, no conclusive evidence has been re-
ported on that matter. The in the second part we should more carefully detail how
various eco-cognitive inheritance structures contribute to the stability and sharing
of new affordances. I brieﬂy referred to a variety of means by which affordances
are stabilized, they could be behavioral or symbolic, for instance. Recent studies on
niche construction may give valuable hints about how to develop this particular issue
respecting a broader theory of cognition and its evolution.

Chapter 5
The Notion of Docility: The Social Dimension of
Distributing Cognition
Introduction
In section 2.5, I argued that the mechanism for de-biasing rationality is not furnished
at an individual but at a eco-cognitive level. As a matter of fact, a great amount of
knowledge and information is stored in cognitive niches in the form of artifacts,
institutions, habits and so on. The question is, which socio-cognitive attitudes ex-
hibited by the single human being favor the distribution of cognition and thus the
de-biasing of rationality? This chapter will introduce the notion of docility as the
attitude supporting and facilitating cognitive cooperation.
In section 5.1, I will start by claiming that the traditional notion of altruism offers
a poor explanation of cognitive cooperation. The main idea I will discuss is that
altruism is not integrated into any cognitive framework potentially explaining 1)
why human beings tend to share cognitive resources with other people, and – most
of all – 2) why this turns out to be key to the astonishing success of human beings
as eco-cognitive engineers.
In section 5.2, I will illustrate the notion of docility. First introduced by Herbert
Simon in the early Nineties, docility is thought to be the concept able to connect a
pro-social attitude like altruism to human cognition. Docility will be described as
the attitude or tendency underlying those learning processes, which involve various
forms of reliance on social channels.
In section 5.3, I will develop the original notion elaborated by Simon bringing it
into the broader framework of cognitive niche construction. As an adaptive conse-
quence of cognitive niche enrichment due to living in large group, docility is a key
component in explaining the tremendous success humans had as eco-cognitive engi-
neers. Docility will be deﬁned as that disposition meant to facilitate the exploitation
of various eco-cognitive resources in two senses. First, it is manifest in the tendency
to lean on social channels in order to overcome individual limitations. It facilitates
the exploitation of second-hand information. Secondly, it is not only involved in
merely passive attitudes related to obtaining resources, but also in those activities in
which one is actively engaged in providing and sharing them.

5 The Notion of Docility: The Social Dimension of Distributing Cognition
After the illustration of docility, I will devote section 5.4 to developing an ac-
count of undocility. Little attention has been placed on the deﬁnition of this con-
cept, thinking that undocile behaviors are simply those behaviors that cannot be
deﬁned as docile. In order to ﬁll this gap, I will resort to the concept of bullshit, ﬁrst
introduced by Harry Frankfurt in his work On Bullshit. Taking advantage of this
concept, I will argue that Frankfurt’s deﬁnition of bullshitting captures an important
aspect characterizing undocile behaviors: bullshitters, lacking docility, do not dis-
play any concern about what they believe. That is, they are basically careless about
the truth-value of what they say or maintain. After introducing this interpretation
of undocility as bullshitting, I will complete the picture of undocility by pointing
to some situations in which docility has an important limitation. In this part of the
chapter, I will introduce and deal with the so-called “ostrich effect” in order to show
how silence and active avoidance – although undocile – may turn to be beneﬁcial
for the individual and the community she lives in.
In the last section 5.5, I will present the Open Source Model as a case in point for
better describing the relevant features of docility. More precisely, I will point out that
hackers – those who are actively involved in the various open-source communities
– best represent what a docile person is.
5.1
Altruism and Social Complexity
As a matter of fact, the notion of altruism assumes a great variety of meanings
depending on the context in which it is actually considered [Khalil, 2004]. For in-
stance, it is altruistic to help another human being who suffers or is in danger for
some reason. This is a kind of pro-social behavior. Altruism also means to sacriﬁce
one’s ﬁtness in a way that advantages another individual’s ﬁtness [Simon, 1993]. Or
it can be viewed simply as the intention of beneﬁting another individual: in this case
altruism is a kind of genuine regard for others [De George, 1999].
As the reader can see, these meanings overlap in part, since all of them refer
to a certain person who is motivated to give something, but gains (or thinks to
gain) no return from the beneﬁciary of his/her action [Khalil, 2004; Simon, 1990;
Simon, 1993]. Roughly speaking, altruism can be described as a pull-push mech-
anism. That is, altruism (and its contrary, namely, selﬁshness) deals with all those
situations in which a person decides to push or pull towards oneself or others a cer-
tain good (money, happiness, help, ﬁtness, etc.). If one pulls a certain good towards
oneself she/he is commonly described as selﬁsh, whereas if one decides to push it
towards others, she/he is described as altruistic. The concept of altruism has been
commonly used to explain, for instance, cooperation [Axelrod, 1984], and all those
behaviors that make social living possible. But it is also referred to as a pro-moral
behavior that can also be found among animals and insects [Joyce, 2006].
Although I do not ﬁnd any fault in this characterization, I maintain that this rep-
resentation is incomplete, since it reduces an interaction between human beings
basically to an exchange of something: it does not address any cognitive dimension.
That is, interacting with other human beings can constitute the basis for accom-
plishing various tasks and, ultimately, for making decisions and solving problems.

5.1 Altruism and Social Complexity
103
The social dimension turns out to be a valuable resource [Frank, 1988; Frank, 2004]
that becomes part of our cognitive system and the way it evolves [Humphrey, 1976;
Magnani, 2007c].
As it will be shown below, my perspective tries to enhance these perspectives
since we found that cognitive dimensions provide a better understanding of human
nature rather than the concept of altruism. However, I acknowledge that altruism
provides a consistent example of a pro-social human trait. Altruism is not a simple
selﬂess act and clearly goes beyond ego fulﬁllment. Having written that, it is appar-
ent that I to some degree follow Khalil’s altercentric perspective since the individual
“at least in some occasions, may share income because he is built with a pro-social
trait” [Khalil, 2004].
An enormous amount of information is stored in human culture and becomes
available only through social learning. Information is also stored in institutions, lan-
guage, and other various artifacts we daily cope with (computers, books, etc.). Hu-
man beings are ultra social creatures [Richerson and Boyd, 2005], because living in
large groups becomes a fundamental trait that contributes to shedding light on some
human activities, for instance, decision-making and problem-solving. On this tack,
Dunbar [1996; 1998] extensively investigated the impact that social complexity –
typical of human communities – has had on our brains. According to the so-called
“social brain hypothesis”, there was a co-evolution between (a) the human brain and
(b) living in larger and larger groups during the history of human evolution. Human
beings developed disproportionately those skills which allowed them to better cope
with the social complexity and the increasing cognitive demands related to living in
larger group size.
Living in larger groups gave birth to a series of events, which had clearly a major
impact on human evolution, because it drastically reconﬁgured the attunement and
access to those relevant aspects of the environment, which enabled human beings
to exhibit more and more plastic behaviors. In this sense, the revolutionary char-
acter of social complexity in the history of human evolution is closely related to
its eco-cognitive effects at the niche-construction level. That is, social complexity
profoundly changed and enriched the eco-cognitive niches our ancestors lived in,
and so contributed to that cognitive explosion that eventually led to their ecological
domination as self-domesticated animals.
The idea of humans as self-domesticated animals is introduced by Bingham
[1999] He connected this idea to the formation of early moral communities, which
played a pivotal role in controlling and modifying various pre-existing instincts to-
wards the social and cooperative living. Recent comparative studies of monogamous
species [Curley and Keverne, 2005] reported reduced constraints of hormonal states
over parenting behavior even in Old World Primates: that is, parenting behavior is
much less inﬂuenced by hormonal states, but other brain-based mechanisms. From
the evolutionary history, this resulted as an adaptation to living in larger groups.
Signiﬁcantly, the decline of the mechanism underlying olfactory processing is sup-
posed to have been compensated by the emergence of an alternative brain-based
mechanism based on foraging information from visual clues. Therefore, our an-
cestors started relying on different mechanisms much more devoted to making use

104
5 The Notion of Docility: The Social Dimension of Distributing Cognition
of external and visual signs. One of the most intriguing differences is, for exam-
ple, the development of various social instincts, which enabled the cooperation also
among individuals not genetically related. Worth considering it is also the evolution
of social skills related to extra-species relationships with domesticated animals. As
argued by Adolphs [2001], a complete treatment of social human processes should
include reciprocal social behaviors with those animals which entered human niches.
The general reconﬁguration of the relevant aspects of the environment, namely,
niche construction activity (cf. section 3.3), had some important adaptive conse-
quences; For instance, the evolution of special cognitive processes to cope with
social complexity. According to recent neurological studies, for instance, social cog-
nition is special or at least involves neural structures that organisms can only mod-
ulate for other limited cognitive performances, like decision-making or attention
[Adolphs, 2006]. Usually people think of other humans in normative terms, whereas
thinking about inanimate objects does not have any normative character. As a mat-
ter of fact, we are not used to gossip about a tree or even an animal, because we do
not think about them in normative terms. The same can be said about mind-reading.
People surely attribute human features to inanimate objects (even moral instrinsic
value), but rarely they have an object as a mind-reading target [Adolphs, 2006].
More generally, human beings developed disproportionately those brain areas
underlying the skills, which allowed our ancestors to better cope with the increased
cognitive demands derived from living in large groups. This is fairly captured by
the so-called “social brain hypothesis” [Dunbar, 1996; Dunbar, 1998]. For instance,
the ability for identifying individuals and their behavior through visual signals de-
tection; the ability for face recognition; the ability for remembering relationships in
a group and manipulate them; the ability for acting on emotional cues given by the
others; the ability of mind-reading, etc.
Thus, primate brains would be biased towards social problem-solving since their
evolutionary origins [Humphrey, 1976; Byrne and Whiten, 1997] in the sense the
eco-cognitive relevant aspects of the environment – their niches – humans are mostly
attuned to are social in their origins. As shown above, language – in its gossip-
enabling features – was a tremendous adaptation for social exchange. In this sense,
language allowed humans to develop new and powerful cognitive niches resulting
from the emergence of social complexity given its artifactual nature. Language as
the ultimate artifact [Clark, 2006; Clark, 2008] contributed to form a permanent ar-
tiﬁcial environment to support an astonishing variety of activities [Magnani, 2009].
Also the gossiping fallacies can be easily considered in this distributed and artifac-
tual framework (cf. Chapter 1).
It is noteworthy that what originally developed to compete within the social
melieu shades off into other extra-social domains. For instance, the ubiquitous
propensity of human beings to anthropomorphize even in presence of stimuli that
are not strictly social. Interestingly, the projection of some human features to
various external objects is less trivial than one might expect. Anthropomorphic
thinking, for instance, is of that importance when dealing with moralizing various
objects [Gebhard et al., 2004]. The recourse to projection can be useful for un-
earthing new interpretations and points of view, which were previously unavailable.

5.2 From Altruism to Docility
105
Even if anthropomorphic thinking is a kind of pre-scientiﬁc thinking, it has that
heuristic value in many human activities just like the case of gossiping fallacies I
treated in Chapter 1, which are, indeed, fair examples of what we are talking about.
Another interesting example is provided by the so-called “social illusion” originally
studied by several scientists since the second half of the last century. That is, simple
triangles or circles moving a certain way may trigger emotions and social descrip-
tion [Castelli et al., 2000; Adolphs, 2006]. Surprisingly, those projections recruit
the same visual cortical regions involved in face recognition [Schultz et al., 2003].
Whereas patients affected by autism are unable to socially describe or even have an
emotional response while viewing those shapes [Adolphs, 2006].
5.2
From Altruism to Docility
The concept of altruism accounts for the social dimension of ultrasocial creatures
like us, but it is quite lacking in its cognitive component, which is clearly funda-
mental, as the evolutionary studies I mentioned clearly point out. What is lacking in
the very notion of altruism is that it does not provide any hints about how the social
(and cognitive resources embedded in it) contributes to shape the way we make de-
cisions and solve problems. What Simon [1993] did when he introduced the notion
of docility was to bridge this theoretical gap.
As a matter of fact, most of the time people rely on information and suggestions
they gather from others. Before buying a laptop, for example, we usually consult a
friend who is thought to be competent in the matter (if we have one). We simply
trust his suggestions and we subsequently disregard other kinds of information, for
instance the technical advice that a sales assistant gives us. The kind of relationship
we have with a given person turns out to be a valuable cognitive resource. This is
the case, for example, of group loyalty as a form of altruism. Simon argued that
group loyalties have not only a motivational dimension, but also a cognitive one.
He argued that “[t]hey deﬁne the boundaries of the group over which goods are
to be summed, and they cause particular variables and simpliﬁed world models to
govern the thinking of group members” [Simon, 1993, pp. 159-160]. Indeed, there
are plenty of examples of that kind. Now, the point that Simon makes is that being
open to others, often labeled as “altruistic behavior”, turns out to be a fundamental
trait (or feature or strategy) related to how humans face difﬁculties and overcome
their various cognitive limitations to make satisﬁcing decisions.
Simon calls this tendency to lean on social channels docility. Humans are
“docile”, in the sense that their ﬁtness is enhanced by “the tendency to depend
on suggestions, recommendations, persuasion, and information obtained through
social channels as a major basis for choice” [Simon, 1993, p. 156]. Humans sup-
port their decision-making capabilities by receiving inputs, perceptions, data, and
so on, from the social environment. The social context gives them the main data ﬁl-
ter available to increase individual ﬁtness. As a matter of fact, everything we know
does not derive from our own experience, but is learnt from those who surround us
[Humphrey, 1976; Magnani, 2006a]. Very often we simply watch what others are

106
5 The Notion of Docility: The Social Dimension of Distributing Cognition
doing and imitate them. Imitation is indeed one of the most common learning ac-
tivities that we may ﬁnd in everyday life. Just imagine how our life would be if
we had to experience everything by ourselves. Then, I argue that the environment
and other people’s attitudes make the difference in developing such a tendency. In
this sense, the ﬁtness of docile individuals depends on other people willing to pro-
vide advice, comments, suggestions, and the like. Moreover, the social system leads
docile individuals to a better ﬁt if compared to non-docile ones.
Although Simon never addressed any of these “distributed” conceptions of ra-
tionality or human cognition, as I have already described in Chapter 1, it seems
reasonable to say that the notion of docility clearly introduces a new element to the
theory of bounded rationality. Simon’s statement can be fruitfully interpreted that
way: humans overcame the limits of their bounded cognitive system by delegat-
ing cognitive functions to the environment. Suggestions, recommendations, and the
like are all external resources that are socially available, and that indeed contribute
to lessening various limitations. They can provide both short-term and long-term
aids to reduce memory load. Within scientiﬁc and academic settings, for example,
a sound comment from a reviewer can help us to direct my attention to a point we
overlooked. An experienced colleague of ours can provide us with knowledge and
skills which we can easily adopt upon occasion, for instance, to organize a con-
ference or write a paper. A discussion may unearth new perspectives that were not
previously available within our minds. It can be also a very precise system for get-
ting feedback to test some ideas we are not sure about. And so on.
Other people provide external resources, suggestions and recommendations, but
so do the various objects and tools we are familiar with. For instance, a pen and
a sheet of paper are an example of a simple but powerful external cognitive kit
that drastically increases our performance when dealing with calculating, planning,
remembering, communicating, thinking and other related activities. More generally,
artifacts:
1. support memory [Wilson, 2005];
2. change the representational task we face in terms of more efﬁcient action se-
quences [Zhang and Patel, 2006];
3. facilitate the making of inferences which are more sound than others.
Going beyond Simon, docility can be considered as a kind of adaptation that facil-
itates the process of distributing cognitive functions to the environment, and makes
that a major basis for decision making. From our birth we operate this kind of dele-
gation, ﬁrst to our parents, and then to other people. After that we begin to select and
distinguish between people from whom to learn something important or insigniﬁ-
cant, and the importance of a personal role in getting information becomes ever
greater. This is also apparent in studies on advice-taking and -giving where scholars
found that people discount information according to whether it comes from expert
or novice advisors.

Docility, Learning, and Knowledge
5.3.1
Developing Docility: The Active Side
A great part of what we know is derived from other human beings and, more gen-
erally, from social channels. Just looking around, we can see a great variety of sys-
tems that make information transmission possible and let it work as a major basis
for choice. Now, I want (and need, as shown above) to connect docility to cognition
on a broader but deﬁnite basis. Hence, I argue that docility is that tendency which
humans exhibit in any cognitive activity that mostly leans on what is found outside
– in the human cognitive niches.
As repeatedly pointed out, the human cognitive system is distributed so that some
performance results as a continuous interplay between our mind-brain system and
various external resources [Clark and Chalmers, 1998]. That is, people do not hold
internally an explicit and complete representation of a given task that they face and
its variables (cf. section 3.1). Rather, people continuously adjust and reﬁne their
perspective through a further exploration of the environment, which allows them to
get a more detailed understanding of what they are doing [Thomas, 1999]. Various
resources (both animate and inanimate) are picked up upon occasion, and external
counterparts, namely external representations, are created to enhance the quality of
their performance.
Having assumed this updated perspective on human cognition, Simon’s deﬁni-
tion of docility is quite lacking, since it postulates docility as just a passive attitude.
Conversely, I claim that it also has an active side because it deals with the entire
process of distributing cognitive functions in which a person actively exploits exter-
nal resources that are socially available (cf. “the externalization process” discussed
in section 3.1.2).
Simon argued that some people are docile in the sense that they lean on sugges-
tions and recommendations by others. But I can extend that deﬁnition also attribut-
ing docile behaviors to those who provide suggestions and recommendations. In
this case, people are docile because they tend to share with others what they know,
namely, suggestions, information, etc. In doing so, they contribute to creating and
generating a common basis for communicating and solving problems. Thus I mod-
ify Simon’s deﬁnition as follows: docility is the tendency to depend on suggestions,
perceptions, comments, and to gather information from other individuals on the one
hand, and to “provide” information on the other.
This deﬁnition may contribute to the development of a new model of social inter-
action which is worth investigating. According to Simon’s deﬁnition, docile people
are those who lean on external supports like suggestions, comments, and so forth.
As he noted, we are all, to some extent, docile because we live in society, and that
cannot be discarded. However, Simon’s perspective turns out to be oversimpliﬁed as
well. If humans are basically social beings, the degree to which they contribute to
society may vary drastically. Therefore, active and passive docility cannot be found
the same way in each individual.
The new deﬁnition I provided may bridge the above mentioned theoretical gap.
As I put it, docility has both an active and passive side. Developing this line of

108
5 The Notion of Docility: The Social Dimension of Distributing Cognition
thought, the active side can be further articulated into three main elements; thus,
docility can be viewed also as the tendency
1. to share one’s own information;
2. to give a public and social dimension to one’s thought/work;
3. to render communication easier by creating, maintaining, and developing stan-
dards, or standard-ﬁdelity.
Information sharing. This is recognized as one of the main attitudes needed in or-
ganizational and social life [Humphrey, 1976], and it may also be characterized as
one of the traits of human personality. Differences between more active and more
passive docile individuals depend on the quality of the information shared. For ex-
ample, we should write that people with that particular tendency to share informa-
tion on values, assumptions, beliefs, and expectations show clear attitudes towards
leadership. Of course, I suggest that this makes the difference between active and
passive docility attitudes.
Information sharing makes the difference between docile and non-docile attitudes in
individual behaviors.
The quality of the information shared makes the difference between more or less docile
individuals. The more the quality, the more the individual is suited to ﬁt in the social
context.
General interpretation of the model indicates a tendency for differences between
individuals such that we cannot ﬁnd a completely non-docile or a fully docile indi-
vidual. Thus, the sharing of information is related to the tendency to behave more
or less cooperatively, i.e. the more the individual shares information, the more he or
she shows a docile attitude.
The Public and social dimension. I maintain that docile people think socially
[Kunda, 1999]. As already noted, living in large groups of people drastically con-
tributed to survival and reproduction [Dunbar, 1996]. As a matter of fact, the larger
the group size, the more it was possible for group members to protect themselves
from danger. Indeed, this does come at a cost, because it implies various bounding
mechanisms to make collective decisions and manage social complexity. Within this
framework, docile people are those who tend to build communities of practice and
learning as the basis for sound decision making.
Docile individuals need to build communities.
Of course, trust and commitment play an important role in this process. However,
people behave differently as communities evolve, and we argue that active docile
individuals tend to build communities while passive docile individuals tend to lean
on these communities. As a result, I argue that:
Docile individuals who build communities know better than others how to exploit
social channels.

5.3 Docility, Learning, and Knowledge
109
Standard-ﬁdelity. Docile people exhibit the tendency to share information, ideas,
etc. That means they are committed to rendering their communication as clearly as
they can. Indeed, if one wants to share an idea, it is obvious that he/she must try to
make it plain and clear, otherwise he/she would fail in his/her goal of passing on
information. That is to say, docile people tend to follow standards. This tendency,
which can be called standard-ﬁdelity, has important cognitive relevance, because
it makes information and knowledge transmission much easier. Consider, for in-
stance, the case of mathematicians, logicians, etc.: as much as possible, they employ
ways of communicating and transferring knowledge that are transparent, namely,
standardizing, to overcome the ambivalent character of natural language. Thus,
mathematicians and logicians have to follow the rules and standardized procedures
embedded in the channel (or mediator) they use to communicate [Magnani, 2007c].
Now, it is worth noting that docile people exhibit a tendency to share and use
standards, but they are also often involved in redeﬁning them to enhance the trans-
mission of knowledge and to make it more efﬁcient. Since docile people are well-
committed to passing on information and distributing cognitive functions to external
resources, they focus more attention than others on the social channels, as Simon
talked about. However, I argue that there is a difference between people who create
and develop standards, and people who use and maintain these standards. From this
perspective I may deﬁne non-docile individuals not using standards at all, or using
them improperly.
Creating and developing standards characterizes higher degrees of docility (active
more than passive).
Using and maintaining standards characterizes lower degrees of docility (passive more
than active).
Indeed, it is not possible to have pure types of docile people. For instance, pupils can
be passively docile when listening to a teacher’s lesson, but they are just as docile
when they actively participate in the learning process, for instance, when they ask
questions or attempt to answer them. In these cases, they cease to be passive and
provide information that a teacher can fruitfully take advantage of.
Standard-ﬁdelity is one of the most interesting aspects concerning docility. In
order to introduce this notion, let me make an example. Consider the difference be-
tween a mathematical theorem and a magic trick; mathematicians and magicians
simply differ in the method or the procedure they carry out in order to get the result.
A mathematician has to follow rules and procedures that are accepted as objective.
For instance, one cannot use theorems that have not yet been clearly demonstrated.
Any passage must be justiﬁed according to the laws of logic: neither contradiction
nor partiality can be accepted. In contrast to that, a magic trick is something com-
pletely private. That is to say: ﬁrst of all, it is not publicly available to everyone who
wants to know anything about it; secondly, the procedure through which one can
make the trick work is kept secret as well, known only to those within the magic
circle; third, there is no standard at all, since any magician can perform tricks on his
or her own.

5 The Notion of Docility: The Social Dimension of Distributing Cognition
Generally speaking, I may say that the mathematician has to follow certain stan-
dards that are the standards of mathematics, accepted within the ﬁeld. There is some
kind of practice, such as proving a theorem or making a scientiﬁc experiment, that
requires people to follow how (a) certain resources that have been employed by oth-
ers and (b) the rules embedded in them. In this case, docility is represented by what
I call standard-ﬁdelity.
What is the main reason why docile people are supposed to use and share stan-
dards? By deﬁnition, docile people are those who are committed to share and ex-
ploit social channels as a way of solving problems and making decisions. Now, the
connection to standard-ﬁdelity is that using standards makes information i) trans-
mission, ii) exploitation, and iii) re-use much easier. In this sense, standard-ﬁdelity
explicitly concerns the increasing of standards as a major opportunity to accomplish
these three main docility-dependentactivities. Consider a scientiﬁc experiment: here
scientists follow certain standardized procedures that clearly display results and the
way to test their presumed validity. That is, standardized procedures lead to results
that can be understood more easily and shared better by the community of practi-
tioners (scientists, mathematicians, and so on).
The analysis of standard-ﬁdelity implies making explicit some basic assumptions
which are not part of the deﬁnition of docility, but which are prerequisites - so to
speak. First of all, standard-ﬁdelity assumes that the actors at play posses the skill
and ability to achieve clarity as a basic requirement for communicating ideas and
thoughts. This is connected to the idea of using language as a public tool normally
lacking in people suffering various pathologies related to autism, for instance. Be-
sides that, I also assume that people posses the ability to approve or disapprove of
a certain behavior with relation to a rule or a set of rules. Standards can be eas-
ily deemed as surrogates of those behaviors which are concerning with approving
or disapproving certain acquired ideas. This role is basically played by morality in
human societies [Castro et al., 2004].
In the next section, I will try to expand my framework on docility trying
to account for the intrinsic connection to the process of learning. As Brud-
erer and Singh pointed out, docility relates to “speciﬁc learning capabilities”
[Bruderer and Singh, 1996, p. 1324], and I may add that this is in line with the Latin
origin of this word (late 15th Century). Docility means “apt or willing to learn”,
from Latin “docilis”, deriving from “docere”, i.e. to teach.
5.3.2
Docility, Learning, and Competence-Dependent
Information
By deﬁnition docility is involved in any process of acquiring additional resources
or knowledge by means of a disposition or tendency to learn from social channels.
To work out this deﬁnition and its implications, consider the ignorance problem I
illustrated in Chapter 1. As already mentioned, we are facing an ignorance problem
when we have a cognitive target T which can be attained by a piece of knowledge
K that we lack at a certain time t. As noted an ignorance problem can never be

5.3 Docility, Learning, and Knowledge
111
solved, but just transformed into something manageable. The price paid is that our
commitment can only attain a lesser target.
In that section, I described two transformative options to the ignorance problem.
The ﬁrst resorts to generating hypothesis H which, if true, would hit T. This option
is suggested by Gabbay and Woods. The second option resorts to the resources one
can exhibit as part of a social group. For instance, the three fallacies I described in
Chapter 1, are examples of this second transformative option.
Taking the notion of docility described so far, the two alternative options I just
mentioned differ as regards another important point, that is, whether they lean on
docility or not. I will rename the two options calling them respectively the docile
option and the non-docile option. Speciﬁcally, the docile option is the one in which
we try to attain T by means of attempting to learn K – or conjecturing it. The non-
docile option is when we try to attain T attempting not to learn K. These two def-
initions clearly point to learning as the major cognitive asset involved in docile
behavior. This statement can be further clariﬁed, when connected to the notion of
competence-dependent information, that I introduced in section 2.4.
This seems to suggest that our capacity to make use of knowledge, which ulti-
mately leans on developing the appropriate abductive skills (cf. 2.5.1), cannot be
dealt with without referring to docility. In fact, using competence-dependent in-
formation clearly requires a learning process to happen and docility would be the
disposition underlying such a choice. In this sense, docility can be considered as a
truly Socratic attitude, because it involves becoming aware of our ignorance, and
acting consequently to try to overcome it by means of learning.
Conversely, the non-docile solution does not require us to be involved in any
learning process. That is to say, we employ the competence-independent informa-
tion, which allows us to reach a decision, without resorting to any knowledge ac-
quisition. This solves our ignorance problem in an anti-Socratic manner keeping us
in an ignorance of ignorance status. The price we pay for economizing is failing to
become aware of our ignorance.
I are now in the position to argue that docility is more generally related to the
tendency to lean on the various ecological resources, which are released through
the cognitive niches. Combining that argued so far with the evolutionary approach
described in Chapter 3, I posit that docility is:
• a disposition underlying those activities of externalizing cognitive functions,
which are connected to the delegation and exploitation of ecological resources;
• a disposition that permits the inheritance of a large amount of useful knowledge
while avoiding the costs related to (individual) learning;1
1 The notion of docility might resemble that of social learning. The two notions are indeed
closely related, but different. Social learning describes the way acquired traits can be learnt
from other people, whereas docility is more related to decision-making, that is, it is more
closely related to exploiting various ecological and social resources not to learn, but to
make decisions.

112
5 The Notion of Docility: The Social Dimension of Distributing Cognition
• an adaptive response to (or consequence of) the increasing cognitive demand (or
selective pressure) on those information-gaining ontogenetic processes, resulting
from intensive niche construction activity.
Indeed, all eco-cognitive resources do not simply come from other human beings.
This is clearly an oversimpliﬁcation. However, the information and resources we
continuously exploit are – so to speak – human-readable. Both information produc-
tion and transfer are dependent on various mediating structures [Hutchins, 1995],
which are the result of more or less powerful cognitive delegations, namely, niche
construction activities. Of course, it is hard to develop and articulate a rich culture,
as humans have, without taking into account the role of mediating systems.
5.4
Who Is Undocile?
5.4.1
Bullshitting and Undocility
The notion of bullshit introduced by Frankfurt [2005] may help to describe a funda-
mental feature of people who are not docile, this relates to their carelessness about
the truth.2 According to Frankfurt, there is an important distinction to draw between
a bullshitter and a liar.3 What differs between the two is that the liar has a general
concern about truth. This is true because, in order to tell a lie, he has to know – at
least – what the truth is. Although the liar fails to be cooperative with respect to the
content of a certain state of the world, he is indeed cooperative with respect to his
attitude towards truth. The fabrication of a lie may require a great deal of knowledge
and it is mindful as it requires the guidance of truth.
More generally, a certain state of mind – namely, an intention to deceive – is
assumed by the liar while making a statement. This attitude is what makes his state-
ment potentially informative. For instance, consider the case of a person telling us
that he has money in his pocket, when he has not. His lie is informative as one can
guess whether he lied or not. What is interesting about lying is that there is always
a reason why a person may not be telling the truth, in fact lies and deceit can be
detected. People, for instance, have at their disposal both verbal and non verbal cues
enabling them to detect potentially deceiving situations [Vrij, 2008]. A minor de-
tail of dress may suggest to a man that his wife is cheating on him, and vice-versa.
Sometimes people fear the consequences of knowing the truth – the so-called “os-
trich effect” (cf. section 5.4.2), therefore they prefer not to investigate but this does
not mean that they would not succeed. Quite the opposite.
According to Frankfurt, the case of bullshit is different, as the bullshitter is sup-
posed to lack any concern or commitment to the truth-value of what he says. What
turns out to be extremely puzzling is not the content, but his attitude. For instance, a
liar voluntarily gets something wrong. But in doing so he conveys a certain commit-
ment to the truth-value of what he claims. A bullshitter does not care about it. As just
2 For a logical and epistemological treatment of bullshit, see for instance Carnielli [2010].
3 On this, see also Carson [2010]. Carson claims that it is actually possible that one tells a
lie while producing bullshit.

5.4 Who Is Undocile?
113
mentioned, a liar has a deceptive intention that can be detected. Whereas the case of
the bullshitter is different. When a person believes P, she intends to believe P and
this intention becomes meaningful to other people. In the case of the bullshitter, he
believes without real intention to believe what he believes. So, what really deﬁnes a
bullshitter is his attitude towards truth, or that he fails to be committed to truth. He
simply does not care whether what he says is true or false, accurate or inaccurate.
This analysis on bullshit allows us to argue that bullshitters are basically not
docile: they are simply careless about the beliefs they hold, an attitude which does
not permit their knowledge to be passed on. Roughly speaking, what comes out of
the bullshitter’s mouth is hot air or vapor, meaning that the informative content
transmitted is nil.
As Frankfurt brilliantly argued, a bullshitter fakes things, and his faking has im-
portant consequences. For instance, it may completely mislead their partner in a
conversation. This is connected with the role played by second hand knowledge and
its connection with docility. As argued by Simon, we do lean on what other people
say. In Chapter 1, I pointed out that gossiping fallacies are cognitively successful, as
they are based on making use of others as an information source. Trust, for instance,
is not informatively empty (cf. section 1.2.1 devoted to presenting the argumentum
ad verecundiam). One decides to trust another person, because she has reasons to
do so. As already noted, there are a number of clues we make use of in order to
consider a particular source of information (a person, for instance) as trustworthy or
not. What happens then with a bullshitter?
A bullshitter does not really mean what she says she believes. She does not have
any concern about the source of what she chooses to believe in. She just happens
to believe. Thus information transmission becomes highly difﬁcult. Here I come
up with another fundamental difference to lying. As already maintained, a lie is
not informatively empty, because people have various mechanisms for detecting it
[Vrij, 2008, Chapters III and IV]. Our lie detector is based on our mind reading
ability. Basically, we can guess that a person might be lying, because we know that
we can all lie and thus we are able to read other people’s intentions. Could we say
the same about bullshitters? Do we analogously have a sort of bullshit detector?
However trivial this question might be, our answer is that we do not.
Following Frankfurt, I claim that a bullshitter is deﬁned by the kind of attitude
he takes regarding the truth or that he exhibits no commitment regarding what he
came to believe in. My take is that we can infer that he is bullshitting only because
we are already familiar with (or expert on) what the bullshitter is talking about. The
cues that are useful to us are related to knowledge of what he is talking about but, in
the case of second-hand knowledge, these are precisely what is missing. This would
be a kind of vicious circle, as we would need what we lack (namely, knowledge) in
order to detect a bullshitter and bullshitting.
The inability to detect bullshitting is linked to another messy aspect of human
beings: the epistemic bubble. As illustrated in sections 1.1.1 and 2.4.1, an epistemic
bubble is a cognitive state in which the difference between knowing that P and be-
lieving to know that P becomes phenomenologically unapparent. The radical thesis
held by its proponent is that this epistemic embubblement cannot be avoided by

114
5 The Notion of Docility: The Social Dimension of Distributing Cognition
beings like-us. I may refer to bullshitting as a special case of epistemic embubble-
ment. By deﬁnition we are embubbled with respect to a certain piece of knowledge.
Embubblement allows us to take a sort of leap of faith, in that we should not believe
we know that P, but actually we do. In the case of bullshitting the object of our em-
bubblement is believing, meaning that bullshitters simply believe they believe, when
they do not. Or as Frankfurt put it “[the bullshitter] misrepresents what he is up to”.
However weird this formulation might seem to be, it captures the very essence of
bullshitting, which is not to care about the mechanism responsible for checking the
plausibility of what one believes in.
Certain similarities to confabulating are worth mentioning to further explore the
cognitive dimension of bullshit. In four words confabulations are false reports about
memories [Hirstein, 2009]. Quite recently, a number of studies have been conducted
in order to shed light on the very nature of confabulation. One of the most interesting
conclusions that confabulation is due to a reality monitoring deﬁcit [Schnider, 2001;
Fotopoulou et al., 2007]. This deﬁcit is explained at a neurological level by the ef-
fects of focal lesions on the medial orbitofrontal cortex [Szatkowska et al., 2007].
Basically, confabulating patients lack the mechanisms enabling them to inhibit
information that is irrelevant or out of date. For instance, they are not able to distin-
guish between previous and currently relevant stimuli [Schnider, 2001]. As a con-
sequence of this deﬁcit, they are simply unable to control and assess the plausibility
of their beliefs.
Some confabulations are extremely puzzling for their weirdness and they have
already been recognized as symptoms of particular syndromes.4 For instance, a pa-
tient affected by Anton’s syndrome denies being blind when they are, while those
who suffering from Capgras’ syndrome think that their relatives have been replaced
by impostors. Amazingly, patients diagnosed with Cotard’s syndrome think that they
are dead.
More generally, confabulation emerges as human beings have a natural tendency
for “coherencing” and ﬁlling in gaps. Confabulating patients have to face up to
memories or perceptions that are basically false, but that they have accepted as true
because of the reality monitoring deﬁcit that they are affected by. The need for co-
herence then creates explanations that result completely implausible and unaccept-
able. In this sense, as in the case of bullshitting, confabulating is not lying but they
are both affected by what has been called pathological certainty [Hirstein, 2005].
Basically, confabulators do not doubt, when they should doubt.
In bullshitting all these effects I have brieﬂy surveyed are present, although they
do not result from a deﬁcit; they are brought about by the mindless attitude bull-
shitters have about truth-value. Drawing upon Hirstein’s phenomenological deﬁni-
tion of confabulation [Hirstein, 2009] I deﬁne bullshitting as follows. A person is
bullshitting when:
1. She believes that P.
2. Her belief that P is ill-grounded.
4 An exhausting list can be found in Hirstein [2005].

5.4 Who Is Undocile?
115
3. She does not know that P is ill-grounded.
4. She should know that P is ill-grounded.
To capture the difference between confabulation and bullshitting, points 3 and 4 are
very important. In confabulating patients a person holds an ill grounded belief be-
cause of her neurological deﬁcit. As already mentioned, she has a reality monitoring
deﬁcit that impairs those mechanisms inhibiting irrelevant or out of date informa-
tion. If she were a normal person, she should know that P is ill-grounded. The case
of the bullshitter is quite different. What overlaps between the two cases is that both
of them should know that P is ill-grounded, when they do not. However, what does
not overlap is the reason behind that. Bullshitters have no lesions preventing them
from meeting any “epistemic” standard of truth. P is ill-grounded because of their
careless attitude. So, in the case of confabulators they simply get things wrong, be-
cause they cannot discern relevant and up to date information from that which is
not. Whereas bullshitters do not get things wrong, but, as Frankfurt put it, they are
not even trying.
Once we distinguish between these two states of mind, then we analogically
claim that the bullshitter is confabulating, as she holds a belief that she would with-
draw or, at least, re-consider, if she tried to get things right.
5.4.2
The Ostrich Effect: The Limits of Docility
So far I have been dealing with docility as something virtuous and undocility as
something vicious. Indeed, I have implicitly assumed a normative stance on docility,
taking docile behavior as somehow “moral”, and undocile behaviour as “immoral”.
I do not want to deny that this assumption has been made. However, while depicting
the undocile individual, it is also worth considering the limitations of docility. That
is to say, even if docile behavior is somehow good, on certain occasions it is not
desirable or beneﬁcial.
Docility underlies a number of activities concerning the sharing of information
and cognitive resources. As just mentioned, it assumes a kind of ethical attitude that
can involve avoiding information asymmetry, granting access to cognitive resources
to as many people as possible, being committed to the general principle of clarity,
and so on. All these prescriptions, however, do not take into account the simple
fact that sometimes it is better to leave some things unsaid. Sometimes it is better
to be undocile, that is, it is better not to disclose and then share information. As I
will discuss in the following, the act of keeping silent – even with good reason – is
indeed undocile.
I
refer
here
to
the
so-called
“ostrich
effect”
[Karlsson et al., 2009;
Brown and Kagel, 2009]. Basically, the ostrich effect is the tendency to ig-
nore unpleasant information by means of avoidance and/or denial. The result is to
remain silent over certain matters, thus blocking the possibility that a certain piece
of information is made publicly available or acknowledged. This is also described –
still in metaphorical terms – by the English expression “the elephant in the room”,

116
5 The Notion of Docility: The Social Dimension of Distributing Cognition
to refer to an object that everybody is indeed aware of yet no one wants to publicly
acknowledge [Zerubavel, 2006].
There are a number of reasons why people might prefer not to publicly acknowl-
edge that they have some problem. Consider, the case of some holocaust survivors
who refused to share their experiences passing on the same attitude to their children
and grandchildren. What they experienced in the concentration camps was so vio-
lent and horriﬁc that they decided not to talk about it even to their closest relatives.
And even when asked to explicitly mention some experience from that time, they
continue to resist by resorting to the use of euphemisms, like for example, in the case
of the holocaust, “unmentionable years” or “the war”. Paradoxically, the recourse
to euphemisms (that basically change the names of certain events) allows victims to
refer to brutal experiences without actually mentioning them. Holocaust survivors
are “silent witnesses”, who might prefer not to share their experiences because it
would be extremely painful and traumatic to disclose them.
One may opt not to talk about certain events not because of a trauma, but because
it might involve fear or lack of conﬁdence. For instance, in a family members may
decide to keep silent about a member’s drinking problem because they are afraid
of the consequences or because they fear they cannot address the problem. Active
avoidance is like a surviving strategy, when, for instance, people lack the resources
to face a problem.
On other occasions, denial is just a matter of tact. We purposefully ignore a cer-
tain detail of our friend just because we feel we should. This may regard more or
less trivial things like, bad breath, weight gain or hair loss. Disclosing and commu-
nicating certain information may irritate people or make feel them embarrassed. We
save other people from losing face. This might be also be related to privacy and its
ethical underpinnings. For instance, we may omit to say that our colleague’s hus-
band cheated on her causing depression, when the boss is going to assign a new and
important task, because that could inﬂuence his decision. Here it is implicit that the
communication of certain information is not ethically neutral, as it can promote ma-
licious gossiping or, even worse, discrimination or mobbing. More generally, even
in the absence of legal duty to privacy, silence can be a protective measure related
to respecting people’s ability to develop and realize their goals [Magnani, 2007c].
Denial may also acquire a social dimension, especially when it regards something
that might turn out to be threatening for a group. For instance, some documents are
classiﬁed by the government, because they contain information pointing to some
vulnerabilities that might be harmfully exploited, for example, in a terrorist attack
against inert citizens, or information with strategic value, for instance, on the stock
market. In this case, investor interests are protected.
Silence or active avoidance may also regard the communication within a partic-
ular institution like the army. Recently, congresswoman Loretta Sanchez has called
attention to the stories of female victims of sexual assault perpetrated while serving
in the US army. Thanks to her initiative, a Sexual Assault Database has been set up
and developed in order to encourage women to break the silence. Interestingly, a
new “restrictive reporting option” has been introduced that allows women who have
been the victims of sexual assault to get help (i.e., counseling and other treatment)

5.4 Who Is Undocile?
117
without their command having to be notiﬁed.5 In this case silence and active avoid-
ance is explicitly supported by the law to protect the offended. This is an interesting
example, since it shows how silence can be usefully deployed to break silence.
The ostrich effect can be seen as a particular case of self-deception, which
stresses the relationship between language and self-deception. Indeed, silence is
not inattentive, it is not an attitude which leads us to ignore something. It is a sort
of negative selection, meaning that we simply prevent something from being trans-
mitted to the public arena. As already argued, this is the undocile side of silence
and denial. It can further be noted that in active avoidance, we simply refuse to
extend our cognition and to consider some potential chances that are over there
– distributed in the various external artifacts available in the cognitive niche. In
the case of silence, we simply refuse to use language as the ultimate artifact to
enhance understanding or to share potentially relevant information [Clark, 2006;
Magnani, 2009]. As a matter of fact, language reconﬁgures a variety of cognitive
tasks as it is a medium for “non-domain speciﬁc thinking” [Magnani, 2009, p. 163].
It also stabilizes certain experiences enabling important meta-cognitive abilities like
having thought of thought [Clark, 2006]. Conversely, avoiding the use of language
enables what I call obliteration (cf. section 2.6.2). Let me make an example in order
to clarify this point.
As argued by Hirstein [2005], self-deception always involves tension or nagging
doubts. Self-deception is the result of a process in which two inconsistent cognitions
come to mind. For instance, consider a man whose wife has cheated on him. In this
case, the self-deceptive process is activated or triggered because of evidence making
him think that his wife is having an affair. He certainly experiences tension between
the unhappy evidence he discovers and his belief that his wife is “faithful”. The
initial awareness of such a conﬂict is fundamental for the process of self-deception
to be instantiated. It is only by means of manipulation that he is able to resolve
the tension he is experiencing. Such a manipulation is not performed “internally”,
but it occurs in a “distributed” framework and in a hybrid way, that is, the initial
awareness of a tension between the two conﬂicting cognitions is appropriately ma-
nipulated so as to favor obliteration. In the case of silence, it is the active avoidance
of using language that helps to resolve the internal conﬂict. Initial awareness is lit-
erally switched off like a lamp promoting the process of embubblement (see section
2.4.1). This process is clearly undocile, because it is based on covering up poten-
tially public information.
This undocile behavior more or less explicitly acknowledges the violent dimen-
sion of language. Silence and denial are explicit responses to this. Language – which
is the product of massive cognitive delegation made possible by docility – turns
into a weapon able to harm people. As argued by Magnani, language is rooted in a
kind of military intelligence as a morality (and therefore potentially violence) car-
rier [Magnani, 2009; Magnani, 2011]. Basically, language transmits vital pieces of
information that, once externalized and made available over there, acquire a kind
of semiotic agency affording certain moral behaviors variously related to expanding
5 The whole story is reported here: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8511010.stm

118
5 The Notion of Docility: The Social Dimension of Distributing Cognition
and, at the same time, constraining our action possibilities. Due to this creative role,
language may promote or even create new inter- and intra-group conﬂicts.
I have another interesting example of how docility certainly has limits. Recently,
the New York attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, started an investigation of the role
played by eight banks in the attempt to fool rating agencies during the recent ﬁnan-
cial crisis of 2008.6 More precisely, the investigation sought to understand whether
the eight banks provided misleading information to rating agencies so as to make
them overstate the value of mortgage securities, which ended up causing the col-
lapse of the bank system worldwide in 2008. Mr Cuomo challenged the idea that
overstating the value of mortgage securities was due to the agencies’ incompetence,
in fact, he claimed that the rating agencies were duped by the banks which tricked
them by furnishing a misrepresentation of the current state of their securities in order
to get more positive evaluations.
Interestingly, one of the techniques used by the banks to dupe the rating agencies
was to reverse-engineer the computer models the agencies used to devise their rat-
ings. Reverse-engineering was facilitated by the fact that the rating agencies made
their computer models public. Thus the banks could trick them starting from an-
swers and then working backward to get the intended result. In addition, the banks
hired some of the analysts that devised the models.
This is a perfect example describing how excessive docility could bring about
unexpected negative consequences. In fact, the rating agencies explicitly declared
that they made their models public to increase the transparency of the rating process.
On the one hand, making the models available was indeed a product of docility, as
it contributed to rendering the process more transparent, given the various conﬂicts
of interest rating agencies were accused of. On the other hand, the decision to make
models public gave the banks a powerful tool to trick investors and the markets.
I have already pointed out how docility may promote misuses of language every
time a private dimension to protect (for example, one’s inner feelings, emotions, and
memories) is publicly disclosed. That is, the effect of docile behavior is to make that
private dimension sharable in an external structure over there so that other people
can beneﬁt from it as a source of additional chances for action and thinking. In the
case of the rating agencies, the disclosure of computer models literally made an
entire powerful niche publicly available that offered banks the chance to reverse-
engineer the models and thus empower themselves to sell bonds.
To sum up, undocility also underlies those situations in which a person simply
refrains from using an external object as a product of cognitive delegation basi-
cally for protection. As already mentioned, this acknowledges that cognitive dele-
gations do come at a price. Furthermore, the unskilled or irreﬂexive use of external
artifacts like language, for instance, can cause negative or unhappy outcomes that
could have been prevented or avoided. In this sense, undocility may be an option
to re-appropriate and re-gain control over the cognitive meanings that people have
lavished on external things and objects.

5.5 The Open Source Model as a Case in Point
119
5.5
The Open Source Model as a Case in Point
Now, let me go back to docility. In this last section, I shall present the Open Source
Model as a case in point describing in vivo docility.
Historically, what it is commonly labeled as Open Source (OS) embraces an as-
tonishing variety of methods that cannot be reduced to one single approach. The
great number of licenses under which work can be released is just one example
demonstrating this fact. Free and Open Software, GNU and GPL licenses, Creative
Commons, Copyleft, Open Standards, are just some of the different projects that
belong to the Open Source galaxy. Here, I do not aim at examining all the differ-
ences between these approaches and ideas. Instead, I simply refer to the term “Open
Source (OS) Model” as a general mode of knowledge transmission and creation that
is based on one very simple idea: the source code of a software must be visible and
editable so that it can be used, redistributed, changed, and upgraded by everybody.
What strikes us most about the various OS projects is the tremendous success they
have gained during the last two decades. Linux is indeed the most well known case,
but there is a number of other OS projects from web servers (such as APACHE) and
ofﬁce suites (such as OpenOfﬁce) to script languages (such as PHP), from databases
(such as MYSQL and POSTRESQL) to protocols (such as TCP/IP), that have now
become leading products within their sector. Although Bill Gates forecasted that
the hobbyists of the computer (as hackers were called by Gates) would have soon
disappeared, the success of OS software and products is now widely recognized as
a major event in the history of computing and business
Now, the point I want to develop here is whether “being open source” might
derive from the way individuals process information, and relate to each other. What
is the cognitive basis of individuals operating “open source”? Is there any social
cognitive motivation for “being open source”?
5.5.1
A Matter of Cognitive Reliability
During the last few years economists and sociologists have provided stimulating
accounts that try to explain the success of the Open Source movement (hereafter
OS) and its rationale. Some authors [Raymond, 2001; Moody, 2001; Wark, 2004;
Weber, 2004; Williams, 2002], for instance, pointed out that the radical innovation
of the OS model was social rather than merely technical. To explain this idea, he
introduced an illuminating metaphor that clearly depicts the culture and the values
of the OS model. Most of the companies involved in programming he – argued –
resemble what he called “a reverent cathedral building” with a rigid hierarchy. In
contrast, the OS model is more like a “babbling bazaar of different agendas and
approaches”. No rigid hierarchies, no bosses, but very committed users that report
bugs, and are also able to ﬁx them and suggest alternative solutions or new problems
to solve. On another note, Himanen [2001] provided a sociological account in which
he compared so-called hacker ethics with Protestant work ethics and drew some
interesting conclusions about the impact that this new radical approach may have
on existing theories of business.

5 The Notion of Docility: The Social Dimension of Distributing Cognition
Although that sounds most appealing, these kinds of accounts do not hold water,
because they fail to put forward any explanation about why being open source can
also be extremely successful, from a cognitive perspective. For the main task is to
investigate the cognitive reliability of the OS model and open up its cognitive ker-
nel. Generally speaking, the main idea is that being open source may be something
more than a business philosophy or a type of work ethic: it may also match a gen-
eral trait of human cognition in the way it works and evolves. The point I want to
make is the need for a cognitive account of the success of the OS model. Generally
speaking, the OS movement deals with information and knowledge transmission:
therefore the way it manages, organizes, and extends cognitive abilities to cope with
programming becomes a crucial aspect that cannot be neglected.
In the following section, I describe the four dimensions in which the notion of
docility may be a valuable candidate in explaining the cognitive relevance of the OS
model.
5.5.2
The Docile Hacker
The very idea of the OS model is that the source code of a software must be vis-
ible and editable so that it can be used, redistributed, changed, and upgraded by
everybody. Now, the point I want to make in this subsection is that sharing code is a
product of docility.
Source code is not just a block of bits that saves time for those who, fortunately,
can use it. Source code is a cognitive repository that stores ideas, problems, trials
as well as errors, solutions, and it may suggest alternative views. If that is correct,
then sharing code contributes to releasing a large body of knowledge and infor-
mation that drastically modiﬁes how other people (in this case, hackers) can learn,
solve problems, and more generally accomplish a cognitive task such as that of mak-
ing up computer programs. As Raymond put it “you often don’t really understand
the problem until after the ﬁrst time you implement a solution” [Raymond, 2001,
p. 25]. In doing this, hackers lean on various external resources (in this case, the
source code written by others) that become a major basis for their cognitive work
and performances. That is exactly what docility is all about. That is, in writing and
then sharing the code, hackers are continuously involved in a “smart interplay” be-
tween their brain and the environment that is facilitated and enhanced by a tendency
toward external resources: that is docility.
Indeed, in the case of proprietary software, programmers share code and, to some
extent, they are docile as well, because they take advantage of others’ improvements.
However, docility is limited by the narrow boundaries of the company they work for:
nobody else can access the code. In contrast, hackers can potentially rely on thou-
sands of people all committed to the same problem.7 An example of this enormous
7 In a famous paper of his, Bill Gates (1976) argued that hobbyists could not have built
up reliable and stable computer programs. They must have been paid for doing such a
good job. On this note, he wrote: “Without good software and an owner who understands
programming, a hobby computer is wasted. Will quality software be written for the hobby
market?”.

5.5 The Open Source Model as a Case in Point
121
potentiality is given by the high reliability that open software guarantees to the user.
As Raymond wrote “many eyeballs tame complexity” [Raymond, 2004]. As a mat-
ter of fact, Microsoft products (from computer servers to PCs) are much less reliable
than Linux in terms of security, scalability, performance, compatibility, stability, and
so on. In proprietary software companies, the fact that docility is limited jeopardizes
all the cognitive beneﬁts provided by docile behaviors. For instance, peer review,
that is indeed one of the most successful factors leading to software reliability, is
dramatically reduced. In fact, the peer review principle is based on the possibility
for everybody to check each other’s work without limitations of any sort. None can
hide his/her work and prevent others from criticizing it. In this sense, secrecy is the
enemy of quality and it can be regarded as highly anti-docile behavior.
I argue that code-sharing contributes to releasing a great portion of knowledge
that drastically shapes the cognitive task hackers face. The same can be said for
another feature of the OS model, not in this case connected to inanimate resources
(the code) but animate ones, that is, other human beings. In this case, docility is
crucial to making use of those cognitive resources embedded in social channels.
That is, hackers are docile in the sense that they do not simply work on the same
piece of code: they build up communities of practice in which learning from others
and then teaching what is experienced becomes a major trait in the way knowledge
is transferred and developed. In this sense, the social dimension turns out to be a
signiﬁcant cognitive source for their work. Peer review is indeed an example of
this kind, as brieﬂy discussed above: people that get involved in an open project
release their work openly to other hackers that in turn provide them with suggestions
or improvements or simply test their distribution. Cooperation is therefore a direct
consequence of the way they work, not only an ethical option [Himanen, 2001].
Docility is also displayed in the ubiquitous use of social tools such as forums,
chat rooms, mailing lists, newsgroups, newsletters, etc. As a matter of fact, for any
open source project there is a community of practice and learning. Hackers and
developers are allowed to exchange information, solutions, suggestions, know how,
etc. As a matter of fact, most of the activities concerning software development are
managed and organized through the Internet. Usually, open source projects start out
from a person or a group of people that stumble over a series of unsolved problems.
Then, they post some information about their problems on a Website or a mailing
list and try to get some help from other hackers. This gives rise to a community in
which hackers can freely cooperate on the project or simply get an idea of what is
going on. Thus it is not surprising that historically the success of the OS Movement
was largely due to the creation and implementation of tools that enabled distance
communication.
In this sense, forums, chat rooms, and the like are cognitive mediators that en-
code and then release a great portion of resources embedded in social channels and
facilitate knowledge transmission at the same time.
Source code can be considered a cognitive repository that is open to every-
one who wants to modify or simply re-use it. But that is not the whole deal: the
success of the OS Model is also related to the tremendous developments that it
brought about. For instance, when the ﬁrst version of Linux OS came out in 1991, it

122
5 The Notion of Docility: The Social Dimension of Distributing Cognition
consisted of only 10.000 lines of code. Just after 7 years, it was made up of more
than one and half million lines. What does this mean? It means that the OS Model
is not only about sharing code, but it is also a development model in which progress
is really made possible by the thousands of hackers involved in various open source
projects. That is, hackers do not only re-use and share code, but they are committed
to sharing any development or contribution that may improve the quality of a soft-
ware. According to the GNU General Public License, any modiﬁcation made upon
every single piece of code must be released, since everybody must give the recipi-
ents all the rights that are given to him/her. Here again the role of docility is crucial
in describing the cognitive relevance of this attitude; hackers are docile in the sense
that they opt to publish their improvements for further inspections, to ﬁx some bugs
or add new features.
Standard-ﬁdelity is one of the most interesting aspects concerning docility, as
already pointed out. The cognitive relevance of following standards or/and stan-
dardizing one’s own work is as follows: ﬁrst of all, using standards makes infor-
mation and knowledge transmission much easier. This is true for humans and also
for machines. Consider the case of formal languages comparing with informal ones.
Mathematicians, logicians, etc, try to make up ways of communicating and transfer-
ring knowledge that are transparent (standardizing) as much as possible to overcome
the ambivalence and ambiguity of natural languages such as English, French or Ital-
ian. Secondly, having standards also makes it much simpler to compare different
claims. Consider a scientiﬁc experiment: here scientists follow certain standardized
procedures that clearly display results and the way to test their presumed validity.
Very often the incommensurability between theories is due to the failure to apply
set standards when measuring the different claims and to then decide upon the best
method. Thirdly, standards facilitate further developments. Here again, standardized
procedures lead to results that can be understood more easily and shared better by
the community of practitioners (scientists, mathematicians, and so on). Now, let me
turn back to hackers and the relevance of standard-ﬁdelity for the OS model.
Usually Open Source is viewed as something related to software development,
whereas standards regard common agreements that allow communications between
different means [Krechmer, 2005] From an analytical perspective I do not ﬁnd rea-
sons to reject this distinction.8 But from the hacker’s point of view things starts
blurring. The main motivation that stands behind the very idea of the Open Source
is to keep the source code open and available to everybody for inspection and mod-
iﬁcation. Therefore, it is ultimately committed to enabling people to use and exploit
all the cognitive functionalities that a software can give, without any restriction. If
that is correct, then building up standards that amplify interoperability (interaction),
cross-platform compatibility, usability, and so on, is a part of the OS kernel.
Now, focusing more on standard-ﬁdelity in computing, I ﬁnd two main levels
at which it operates. The ﬁrst one regards the kind of standard-ﬁdelity displayed
by mathematicians. As argued above, mathematicians play their game by the rules
of the discipline that are not personal or subjective. The same happens in making
8 For an interesting debate about the distinction between Open Source and Open Standard,

5.6 Concluding Remarks

software. Since in the Open Source galaxy a piece of code should be easily shared
and modiﬁed by all, some basic requirements must be met to increase re-usability.
These basic requirements regard, for instance, writing code (consistency and clear-
ness, for instance). Some of them are also related to releasing pieces of code under
some open source license. For instance, GNU Free Documentation License regu-
lates verbatim copying, modiﬁcations, the documentations to release with the code,
and so on.
The second aspect of standard-ﬁdelity explicitly concerns the increasing of open
standards as a major opportunity to disseminate and distribute knowledge and cogni-
tive capabilities. There are many projects concerning open standards. Among them,
it is worth citing the case of Open Document Format (ODF) developed by the OA-
SIS11 industry consortium; ODF has been recently approved by ISO12 (Interna-
tional Organization for Standard) as the ﬁrst standard for editable ofﬁce documents.
Another well-known example is the World Wide Web Consortium, primarily de-
voted to developing standards for the Web.
5.6
Concluding Remarks
In this chapter I presented the notion of docility. In my view, docility is supposed to
facilitate the delegation and exploitation of cognitive chances secured to cognitive
niches. Docility is thought to be a fundamental behavioral correlate that makes the
extension of human cognition possible, promoting the process of its de-biasing. In
the second part of the chapter I also dealt with the problem of undocility, which is not
simply to be considered a selﬁsh behavior, but also an active strategy protecting hu-
man beings from the negative consequences various eco-cognitive externalizations
can have on them. In the last section of the chapter I have shown how explicative
the notion of docility can be with relation to the case of the Open Source Model.
In the next and last chapter, I will change setting offering the reader an alternative
approach to morality and ethics based on the distributed approach.

Chapter 6
Seeking Chances: The Moral Side
Introduction
The present chapter could be considered an appendix devoted to application of the
approach so far developed to morality and moral reasoning in general. I claim that
the mechanism underlying chance-seeking activities may encompass some impor-
tant features of moral reasoning. This chapter is not going to put forward any moral
theory; rather, it aims at providing a cognitive framework for morality.
In section 6.1 I will argue that from a behavioral point of view morality is about
empathizing with other people. This structural aspect of morality is developed tak-
ing advantage of the notion of moral proximity. Basically, moral proximity will be
considered one of the most fundamental variables prompting an empathetic response
to others. That is, the more a person is proximal to a certain event, the more he will
consider himself morally committed towards the person or people involved in it.
Coherently to the framework developed in the previous chapters, in section 6.2
I will argue that moral proximity can be extended by means of external resources.
More precisely, I will articulate the idea of distributed morality recently introduced
by Magnani [2007c]. According to this hypothesis our capacity to comprehend a
certain event as bearing moral concern can be enhanced by leaning on various ex-
ternal objects, which are apparently inert from a moral point of view, but that –
upon occasion – can help us uncover additional information which directs our moral
decision-making process.
In the last section I will present the notion of the moral mediator, in a discussion
of the philosophical issues surrounding the agency of technological artifacts. In do-
ing so, I shall consider the Internet as a case in point to provide a better picture of
the idea of distributed morality.

6.1
Moral Proximity as a Leading Factor for Moral
Understanding
6.1.1
What Is Moral Proximity?
In his seminal work on moral philosophy, the father of modern economics Adam
Smith [2004] argued that morality is connected to sympathy. In his own words:
As we have no immediate experience of what other men feel, we can form no idea
of the manner in which they are affected, but by conceiving what we ourselves should
feel in the like situation [. . . ] our senses will never inform us of what he suffers. [. . . ] it
is by the imagination only that we can form any conception of what are his sensations.
It is the impressions of our own senses only, not those of his, which our imaginations
copy.
We cannot have direct experience of what others feel, but by means of imagination
we can ﬁgure out how a person feels and then have a moral response to him/her.
Sympathy is the kind of bounding mechanism through which we place ourselves in
another’s shoes. In ethical decision-making theorists regard sympathy as belonging
to a crucial step called moral recognition.1 Most of time people fail to morally
respond to a certain event or situation, not only because they lack rules to apply, but
also because they are not able to recognize, understand or even feel it as a moral
issue, that is, an issue that requires a moral commitment [Watley and May, 2004].
moral distance
moral intensity
indifference
self-sacriﬁce
moral space
Jones [1991] argued that a moral issue can be represented in terms of its moral in-
tensity (see the graph). As he put it, moral intensity is a “construct that captures the
extent of issue-related moral imperative in a situation” [Jones, 1991, p. 372]. Build-
ing on Rest’s previous work, Jones developed a model of moral intensity described
by six main components that in turn can dynamically interact with each other:
1 Rest [1986] introduced a four-components model for individual ethical decision-making
according to which a moral agent must a) recognize the moral issue, b) make a moral
judgment, c) resolve to place moral concerns ahead of other concerns, and d) act on the
moral concerns. We do not necessarily take that for granted; I simply agree with him in
recognizing a preliminary step called moral recognition.

6.1 Moral Proximity as a Leading Factor for Moral Understanding
127
1. magnitude of consequences;
2. social consensus;
3. probability of effect;
4. temporal immediacy;
5. proximity;
6. concentration of effect.
The model is very detailed and it is a valuable starting point from which to provide
another alternative, but similar model. Jones’s moral intensity components can be
grouped into three main primitive elements:
1. moral proximity (or moral distance) that subsumes 4) and 5),
2. consequences of an action that subsumes 1), 3) and 6),
3. social consensus.
Let me make two points on that. First of all, we do not ﬁnd the third element relevant,
namely, social consensus. According to Jones, social consensus is deﬁned as “the
degree of social agreement that a proposed act is evil (or good)” [Jones, 1991, p.
375]. The point I want to make is slightly different; although people recognize the
ethical valence of an abstract situation, depending upon the actors who are actually
involved in it, the perception of a moral commitment in a given concrete situation
can drastically vary from case to case. The different response does not depend on
the normative content of that situation which, conversely, remains the same. In this
sense, there may be social consensus on a certain issue (perceived or not), but no
response, because I maintain that empathizing comes ﬁrst.
The second point is connected to the relationship between consequences and
moral proximity. From a genealogical point of view, I posit that moral proximity
comes ﬁrst, whereas consequences are considered only secondarily. That is, the
magnitude of consequences, concentration of effects, and so on, come to our at-
tention – and are therefore processed – only after the process of empathizing has
taken its course. Having set the scene, I introduce our hypothesis, which connects
moral proximity to presence or absence of moral response towards a certain event.
More precisely, I claim that the more distant a person is from a certain event, the
less he/she will consider himself/herself morally committed towards the person or
people involved in it. Conversely, the more an event is perceived as proximal to a
person, the more she/he is morally committed. It is worth noting that moral proxim-
ity is not a normative claim for or against a certain policy or decision, in this sense,
I agree with Singer who explicitly stated that “the fact that a person is physically
near to us does not show that we ought to help him rather than another who happens
to be further away” [Singer, 1972].
Spohn [1996] added that the sense of belonging to a given moral community is
relevant. That is, from a cognitive perspective I recognize the ethical valence of a
given event, if we recognize those who are involved in it as belonging to our moral
community and the boundaries of our moral community affect our moral response
(cf. the issue of group selection is dealt with in section 3.5).

6 Seeking Chances: The Moral Side
6.1.2
Some Evidence on the Relevance of Moral Proximity for
Moral Engagement
In a famous series of experiments Milgram [1974] reported that obedience to an
authority tended to diminish, once the subject was brought closer to the victim. Mil-
gram argued that empathic clues such as voice feedback, touch proximity, played a
crucial role in perceiving moral commitment towards a person or a group of persons.
Bandura [1999] has provided an interesting theory called moral disengagement.
He argued that people indulge in inhumane conduct, not necessarily prohibited by
the law, because they simply disengage themselves from the actions they carry out.
Moral disengagement involves, for instance, the displacement of responsibility by
minimizing any role as agent in the situation, the use of euphemistic labeling (for
instance, a war can be sanitized, if it is called a preemptive war rather than an ag-
gressive one, or a bomb becomes “intelligent”), and the dehumanization of victims
[Osofsky et al., 2005]: as Bandura put it, “[o]nce dehumanized, they are no longer
viewed as persons with feelings, hopes and concerns but as subhuman objects”
[Bandura, 1999, p. 199]. This last point supports our hypothesis: dehumanization
is less likely, if some empathic contact is established.2
The idea that the more distant we are from a person, the less we will care about
them is supported by neurological data [Moll et al., 2002; Greene, 2003]. Greeene
[2003] conducted a brain imaging study in which subjects were asked to respond
to this dilemma. Suppose a person A is driving a car when he notices a man dying
on the ground. He jumps out of the car and helps the man. Now, suppose that a
person B receives an email in which he is invited to send 100 euros to support ten
thousand starving children in Africa. Although these two cases are similar from a
moral perspective, we would surely blame the ﬁrst person, if he did not help the
dying man, whereas we would not do the same, if the second person did not send
the money. It is worth noting that these two cases have the same normative content.
Technically speaking, they are isomorphic. The issue here is simply about helping
a person or a group of people that are in danger, respectively, the man dying on the
ground and the starving children in Africa.
Greene [2003] reported that situations similar to the ﬁrst case statistically in-
volve more brain activity in those areas related to emotion and moral cognition.
He argued that from an evolutionary perspective helping people is is immediately
beneﬁcial, that is, it is conjectured that humans have developed a mechanism to
make quick moral decisions that involve others close to them, because it contributes
to increasing the ﬁtness of all. This mechanism can also be regarded as short-
distance altruism. Conversely, the second case is an example of long-distance altru-
ism [Gazzaniga, 2005], because we are not facing the person who needs help, and
the distance involved does not lead to the lighting up of any neurological (and/or in-
stinctual) mechanism related to reciprocity or altruism. The kind of altruism which
2 An alternative view on moral disengagement is provided by Magnani [2011]. Magnani ar-
gued that the process of moral disengagement is actually a moral re-engagement in another
morality.

6.1 Moral Proximity as a Leading Factor for Moral Understanding
129
our brain is wired up to reﬂects the kind of environment our ancestors faced. More-
over, it is worth noting that helping others in the wider environment – like that of our
ancestors – would have implied considerable personal sacriﬁce [Greene, 2003]. In
this sense, the bounding mechanism selected by evolution could have been designed
for hot situations and not for those in which relatively modest sacriﬁces are required
(like the example of sending 100 euros via email to the starving children in Africa).
6.1.3
Moral Proximity Can Be Extended and So Can Our Moral
Understanding
As mentioned above, the bounding mechanisms that human beings posses internally
are limited, a fact that is visible in the dilemma illustrated above. Following Greene’s
conjecture, our bounding mechanisms reﬂect the kind of environment inhabited by
humans for thousands of years. However, it is worth noting that the evolution of cul-
ture, and lately that of technology, have dramatically changed the familiar landscape
of our moral sense. Following what was argued in Chapter 3, the activity of cognitive
niche construction has clearly had an impact on our moral understanding. Paintings,
language, and the new forms of communication invented in the last two centuries
(from cinema to the Internet), have had tremendous effects on moral distance and
the way humans can now perceive moral needs and commitments [Russ-Eft, 2004].
It is worth noting that a website or a picture are not part of our brain-mind sys-
tem. That is, there is no neuronal mechanism that can encode information the way
a website or a picture does. In this case our internal capacities are simply bounded.
However, working in concert with external resources (a picture or a website) we
may dramatically enhance our moral performances. The famous motto “a picture is
worth a thousand words” can be analogically applied also to ethics and moral cog-
nition. As mentioned at the beginning, Adam Smith considered imagination as the
faculty deputed to moral recognition. But can imagination be extended or not? And
what about its effectiveness?
A positive answer to these questions has been provided by Magnani [2007c] who
introduced the idea that morality is distributed. The core of the distributed morality
hypothesis is that our capacity of seeing and understanding moral values is partly
distributed across the things (animate and inanimate) we cope with on a daily basis.
That is, external resources (a metaphor, an image, a book, a toy, a website, a friend
or a stranger, and so on) work as moral mediators since they can uncover informa-
tion, alternative perspectives and hypotheses that otherwise would remain unknown.
In doing so, they contribute to the pondering over, formulation, and/or direction of
our moral response and judgment. In sum, moral mediators represent a kind of re-
distribution of the moral effort through managing objects and information in such a
way that we can overcome the poverty and the unsatisfactory character of the moral
options immediately represented or found internally.
What kind of impact moral mediators have on moral distance/proximity is now
under investigation. A second group of questions is related to how the perception
of being morally distant from a certain event may vary upon occasion. My second

130
6 Seeking Chances: The Moral Side
hypothesis can be summed up in that way: the exploitation of external resources
signiﬁcantly changes the perception of the moral distance of an agent towards a
moral issue.
I argue that moral intensity is always mediated by moral mediators as I will detail
in the following sections. That is, recognizing an issue as a moral issue depends on
the capacity to bring the people involved in it closer to us. This process of bringing
oneself closer to the victim is mediated by some structure. I use this term following
Hutchins’ deﬁnition, that is, a mediating structure (or simply a mediator) “mediates
the relationship between the performer and the task [...] I will view it as one of the
many structural elements that are brought into coordination in the performance of
the task” [Hutchins, 1995, p. 290].
6.2
The Morality of Everyday Things
Several studies on distributed cognition have pointed out that the environment is
a mediating structure ﬁlled up with various cognitive resources that can be picked
up and made use of, on occasion. External resources provide us with additional
computational capabilities, because they allow us to perform those actions vital to
us. External resources are also memory stores, because they can encode information
content and release it when needed. Databases are examples of this kind, since they
store and then retrieve a large amount of data that we could not manage alone.
According to that view, almost all human performances are hybrid in the sense
that they are brought about by various interplays between individuals and external
objects. Following this idea, in 1988 Donald Norman published a book under the
title Psychology of Everyday Things, in which he argued that most of time people’s
faults lay in the design of the things that they daily use. That is, people are not always
to blame for their mistakes, because things are often designed as if they were built
to cause errors. Therefore, the psychology of everyday things is metaphorically the
discipline that should shed light on the interaction between humans and external
objects in order to enhance our pre-existing capabilities and/or lessen their possible
negative impact.
The idea I shall try to develop is that the same can be argued about morality. More
precisely, I shall argue that everyday technologies (i.e., computers, the Internet, etc.)
drastically modify our capacity of coping with all those situations that involve some
moral concern. Accordingly, I may speak not only about the psychology, but also
the morality of everyday things.
It is worth noting that robots and computers that are capable of acting morally
are not currently available. They are still the stuff of science ﬁction, like that written
by Isaac Asimov. No computers have intentions or desires and, indeed, they cannot
act morally in a way similar to humans. So why should we care about the morality
of computers and other technologies?
Although intelligent or moral machines are mere intellectual ﬁction, the quality
of the interaction between humans and technology has become increasingly com-
plex with computers, for instance, dramatically increasing the moral impact of ex-
ternal supports on our lives. New moral issues and concerns have arisen. Consider,

6.2 The Morality of Everyday Things
131
for instance, our privacy: computers have made it possible to gather and store such
a large amount of personal data and information that the notion of ownership has
been drastically modiﬁed [Magnani, 2007c, Ch. IV]. New technologies have also
provided us with new tools to cope with pre-existing problems. Just think of the
tremendous opportunities offered by the Internet for democracy and education. Both
e-democracy and e-learning are currently changing the way people organize their
political activities, transmit knowledge and teach.
New ﬁelds of study have emerged. Consider, for instance, computer ethics and,
more recently, machine ethics. The ﬁrst brought up a series of discussions and
debates that traditional ethics and moral philosophy have completely discarded
as marginal or too applied [Bynum and Rogerson, 2004; Moor and Bynum, 2002;
Floridi, 1999; Johnson, 1994]. Machine ethics comes from the AI (Artiﬁcial In-
telligence) tradition, and it aims to provide an ethical dimension to technological
devices [Anderson et al., 2005]. Many emerging topics are being elaborated and dis-
cussed, like for instance, the interaction between artiﬁcial and natural intelligence
systems and machine-to-machine communication and cooperation. Machine ethics
is also involved in building artiﬁcial systems that are able to assist humans in ethical
decision-making.
Although these ﬁelds of study have furnished valuable and innovative contribu-
tions, they restrict their moral contributions to examination of the possible misuses
of technology. They somehow assume that technology is just a means that is “ex-
ternal to the context in which it operates” [Buchholz and Rosenthal, 2002, p. 48].
More precisely, there is a lack of understanding about technology’s cognitive and
moral dimension. A number of questions have been discarded, even if they are cru-
cial in dealing with technology. For instance, why do computers really matter? What
is their cognitive role? How do they contribute to our moral understanding?
As mentioned in Chapter 3, recent studies on distributed cognition have pointed
out that computers (and other external resources) are inherently a part of the hu-
man cognitive system, as we continuously modify the cognitive niches which we
live in. Clark [2003] argued that we are natural-born cyborgs, because we consti-
tutively exploit the cognitive resources embedded in various external objects and
supports (computers included). In fact, that is the way human cognition works and
evolves. I maintain this conceptual framework can lead us to a different perspective
on the moral relevance of external objects like computers and other computational
machines.
Recently, Magnani [2007c] introduced a new paradigm that profoundly alters the
familiar landscape of ethics and its relationship with technology. Magnani argued
that morality is a distributed phenomenon, like cognition, morality is distributed in
the sense that the capacity of acting morally or seeing moral entities also depends
upon external resources and the way we manipulate them.

6.2.1
The Idea of Distributed Morality: A Cognitive Framework
for Ethics
From a cognitive perspective, I maintain that human beings are problem solvers
[Simon, 1947; Simon, 1955]. People are continuously engaged in solving problems
all day long, every day. Some of them are more trivial, such as choosing which
clothes to wear or buying a car. Others are much more complicated: choosing which
university to attend, changing job, deciding whether to marry Suzie or John, whether
to invest in a Chinese corporation, to fund a charity or to support Greenpeace. Some
of these are labeled as moral problems, since they involve other people: their health
and happiness and everything that concerns their life as human beings.
Ethical deliberation, and morality in general, can be considered as a problem
solving activity in which people try to apply pre-existing solutions and/or gener-
ate new ones to complete the various tasks they face. However, as in any kind of
problem solving activity, ethical deliberation is based on intrinsically incomplete
information, because it is impossible for anyone to be aware of every fact related to
any given subject. That has important theoretical implications:
1. having incomplete information means that our deliberations and decisions are
never the best possible answer, but they are at least satisﬁcing;
2. our conclusions are always withdrawable. That is, once we get more information
about a certain situation that involves some moral concern, we can always revise
our previous decisions and think of alternative pathways that we could not “see”
before;
3. a great part of our efforts in solving a moral task are devoted to elaborating con-
jectures or hypotheses in order to obtain more adequate information.
Within this framework, conjecturing is essentially an act that permits us to manip-
ulate our problem, and the representation we have of it, so that we may eventually
acquire more “valuable” data. In this sense, I maintain that morality is manipulative
in its essence, because it deals with changing and manipulating the world in order to
overcome the unsatisfactory character of the options that are immediately available.
In generating conjectures and hypotheses, I claim that the role of external re-
sources (i.e. computers or other forms of technology) is fundamental. More pre-
cisely, the continuous interplay between individuals and their environment is one of
the most distinctive traits of moral cognition and morality in general. Here the main
thesis I put forward is that this interplay is a kind of semiotic activity in which our
minds are continuously extended into the external world [Magnani, 2006a]. This
process can be split into two:
• people externally reproduce something that they would usually only have within
the isolated brain and thus make it more visible;
• once they have externalized their thoughts using external objects, people can
work on them and develop new concepts and new ways of thinking. The entire
cycle is called the “externalization process” (cf. 3.1.2).

6.2 The Morality of Everyday Things
133
During the externalization process individuals create something that exists without
their brain. This process is called mimetic, because individuals use external sup-
ports to reproduce what occurs inside their private consciousness and, in turn, make
their thoughts easy-to-share. One of the most common mimetic activities is writing;
writing is a mimetic activity, because people represent and reproduce thoughts and
ideas by another means (the sheet of paper). There are many other activities of this
kind that involve computers. As mentioned above, software engineers and computer
scientists have recently started caring about the moral dimension of machines and
computers. For instance, designing a software agent capable of assessing the moral
ramiﬁcations of courses of action has become an amazing new challenge. Imple-
menting such an artiﬁcial system is, indeed, a mimetic activity, since engineers and
scientists try to artiﬁcially reproduce behaviors and processes.
The example of writing is also interesting in another way. Once our thoughts
have been secured to an external support (the sheet of paper), we are able to think
and operate on them in a way that would not otherwise be possible. As a matter
of fact, we cannot re-read our thoughts, because they are ﬂeeting and immediately
fade away. But, once written, we can use the sheet of paper as a creative external
representation and perform some activities otherwise impossible [Magnani, 2006a].
More precisely, external supports allow individuals to re-project their own thoughts
so that they can uncover hidden information and new concepts (cf. section 3.1.2). In
this sense, external objects take part in creating and ﬁnding room for new ideas and
perspectives.
Now the question is how can we take processes like this into account if we con-
sider morality as related only to the application of rules, imperatives or guidelines?
As the example shows, ethical deliberation and morality are expressed not only in
words at a verbal/propositional level [Johnson, 1993] but also though model-based
and “through doing” processes [Magnani, 2007c]. This is the basic point I want to
stress here.
As mentioned above, people often exploit external supports (for example, lan-
guage but also technological innovations) to enhance their moral efforts in a com-
pletely tacit fashion as the example demonstrates. I can distinguish two main types
of moral behavior employed by human beings. The ﬁrst type is related to selecting
the most appropriate course of action from a library of pre-existing behavioral tem-
plates that can be considered as automatic responses. The second type regards all
those situations in which humans do not rely on pre-existing solutions, but invent
new ones. In the following section I will provide some examples of moral templates,
and I will discuss the creation of new ones.
Generally speaking, a moral template is a set of actions and decisions that have
been successfully tried and tested within a society or culture. In this sense, it rep-
resents a variety of solutions that become culturally and socially accepted and that
on occasion are deployed and thought to be the best course of action in certain cir-
cumstances. Some of these solutions are linguistically encoded in guidelines and
imperatives. The Ten Commandments are an extraordinary example of moral tem-
plates, because they provide moral options and solutions that may help people in
many circumstances. Moral theories themselves are examples of this kind, because

134
6 Seeking Chances: The Moral Side
they provide a highly theoretical guide to various aspects of everyday life. Utilitari-
anism, Kantianism, and the social contract are thus ways of interpreting the world in
a moral sense that give us explicit, coherent, and consistent reasons for our actions
[Thagard, 2000].
Many other templates are not explicitly laid out or expressed in a sentential way,
but remain embodied in actions and bound up with various external structures and
conﬁgurations. The case of the email I presented above is an example of this kind:
writing is indeed an experienced and powerful template that can be used to re-
ﬂect upon some complicated issue and/or to manage our emotions and feelings
in order to assess whether they are appropriate or not [Harris, 2004; Love, 2004;
Wheeler, 2004].
Another example of a moral template that is not sentential, but embodied in an
external structure is represented by the various institutions that we ﬁnd in many so-
cieties and cultures. The institution of the family is an example of this kind. The
family can be considered as a template that groups various successful solutions to
some problems related to survival, but also to parental care, the role of elderly peo-
ple, property, the division of labor, and many other issues that can be the source of
problems and conﬂict among human beings.
The nature of these templates is highly conjectural. As a part of problem-solving
activities, their validity rests on the fact that they are successfully experienced and
transferred to others as cultural inheritance. But they still remain retractable and
open to improvement.
As noted above, sometimes pre-existing templates are not adequate to solve the
problems that we face. As a matter of fact, templates themselves were once in-
vented because the options available at a certain moment were not adequate. First
of all, moral innovations sometimes represent a radical revolution compared to past
templates. Let me consider the case of democracy. Democracy represented an amaz-
ing moral innovation, compared with pre-existing forms of government. It brought
into existence a series of moral entities that were totally neglected before its advent.
For instance, the notion of citizenship gives a moral and equal status to everyone, a
classic example being: libert´e, egalit´e, fraternit´e! In other terms, the radical moral
(rather than social and political) innovation was that every citizen had been ap-
pointed with certain basic rights that the State could not take away. In this sense,
the idea of democracy creates morally intelligible entities, e.g. citizens. The moral
status of human beings dramatically changed after the modern democratic State had
been created, and things changed again when women were ﬁrst allowed to vote.
These are examples of how morality changes in history, and, with it, the objects that
are given moral meaning.
Secondly, moral innovations may arise from pre-existing templates that are oc-
casionally revised and modiﬁed. However, the process of revising old moral habits
and concepts may be extremely problematic. Consider, for instance, the case of gay
marriage. Its proponents attempt to solve some conﬂicts related to extending a set
of rights also to gay couples by modifying the entire institution of the family. This
issue can be highly controversial, because its opponents argue that the traditional
family is a template that has been corroborated to solve certain problems, but not

6.2 The Morality of Everyday Things
135
others. A precautionary principle is thus advocated. In some countries, the issue of
gay marriage has been solved in a different way, gay couples being able to draw
up a contract regarding their relationship in the same way that any other unmarried
couple can. In this case, a new and different moral option is created by modifying,
but not replacing, a pre-existing template.
It is worth noting that not all moral inventions become widespread prototypes
or solutions. Some of them can be occasionally employed by a lone person or an
isolated group, but soon discarded. That can be true, whether they were successful
or not. First of all, because they can be immediately replaced by better ones. Sec-
ondly, because they cannot always be reproduced and/or transmitted. A new moral
idea might be connected to a speciﬁc situation and context that cannot be replicated
somewhere else. There have been plenty of moral and social experiments that aimed
at reconﬁguring the entire Western way of life but some of them failed as general
revolutionary movements, because they were strictly linked to a speciﬁc historical
moment. Once social and political circumstances changed, their moral appeal soon
disappeared.
Finally, the failure or the success of new moral ideas also depends upon society
and human decisions. Communities can adopt and discard ideas and innovations for
various reasons that can independently be social, political or economical.
All these examples I provided point to the conclusion that morality is a manipu-
lative and “through doing” activity in its essence. It aims at manipulating and recon-
ﬁguring pre-existing ideas to solve some problem related dealing with other human
beings. As shown above, a great amount of our efforts are devoted to building var-
ious moral behavior templates that help us solve some speciﬁc problem. In doing
this, the exploitation of external resources is crucial. Morality is fostered and en-
hanced by continuous moral delegations in which we transfer a large amount of
ethical knowledge to various external and mediating structures, such as language,
theories, institutions, and technological artifacts. In turn, what we have delegated
to external structures (e.g. democracy, or democratic institutions, political represen-
tatives, pools, statistical services, etc.) could help us to generate new ideas and a
re-projecting activity is thus carried out [Magnani, 2006a]. It is a “re-projecting”
activity because we introduce information each consecutive time, as it has been
modiﬁed outside our brain (cf. section 3.1.2). In this sense, individuals create new
knowledge through the exploitation of external supports/resources. I maintain that
morality is a distributed phenomenon [Magnani, 2006b]. That is, we cannot refer to
morality as something that happens only within the human mind, but it is somehow
distributed over a set of external resources and internal capabilities.
The framework I brieﬂy detailed in this section constitutes a starting point to
better understand the moral role and relevance of technological artifacts such as
computers.
6.2.2
Epistemic and Pragmatic Actions: The Moral Side
In the last section, I pointed out that morality is a distributed phenomenon, since
people rely on external resources to make decisions or generate new ideas. In order

136
6 Seeking Chances: The Moral Side
to avoid possible misunderstanding about this claim, it is worth citing the distinc-
tion between pragmatic and epistemic actions [Kirsh and Maglio, 1994]. Generally
speaking, a problem can be deﬁned by an initial state, a goal state and a set of oper-
ators (or mediators) that allow transformation of the initial state into the goal state
by a series of intermediate steps.
These intermediate steps, that I will call hereafter actions, can be grouped into
two main categories: pragmatic and epistemic. By the term “pragmatic actions” I
refer to all those intermediate steps that alter the world to achieve some physical
goal or other physical intermediate stages. For example, if one wants to be refunded
for a certain purchase, he might have to fax the receipt. The action of faxing the doc-
ument is a pragmatic action because it brings one closer to the goal state, namely,
being refunded. In contrast, epistemic actions are all those actions that alter the rep-
resentation of the task one is facing. A child that shakes and feels their unwrapped
birthday present to guess what is inside is a fair example of this kind; the action
of shaking unearths additional information that makes guessing less blind. In this
case, the world is not strictly changed but what is changed is the representation we
have of the problem. Accordingly, epistemic actions can also be regarded as task-
transforming representations [Hutchins, 1995].
Analogously, the same can be argued for moral situations. Indeed, a moral task
can be considered a problem-solving activity, as I discussed above. If this consider-
ation is correct, the impact of technology on ethics and morality is twofold. First of
all, technology deals with all those actions that can help us to pragmatically enhance
or diminish our moral effectiveness. Secondly, computers and machines also con-
stitute external representations that transform the moral problem we face and thus
help to solve it.
Let me start with pragmatic actions. Consider, for instance, the case of Google.
Google, as one of the most powerful web search engines, permits us to go through
a huge number of web pages. Recently, some ethical concerns related for instance
to privacy have arisen. Some years ago GoogleTMreleased a new webmail service
called Gmail (http://gmail.google.com). According to its inventors, the appeal of
GmailTMis that it comes with built-in Google technology, and therefore it allows
users to easily search their mailbox for messages . In addition, Gmail provides users
with the possibility of receiving advertisements and information that are relevant
to them or their messages. Neither pop-ups nor untargeted banner ads are sent. Al-
though this is advertised as a special feature that no other email services offer, some
problems related to privacy immediately arise.
Now, consider the following example. Suppose a person A writes an email about
apple pie to a person B. Since Gmail provides users with personalized ads, B can
receive information for apple pie recipes alongside his email [Batelle, 2005]. This
can happen for whatever one writes, which might encompass political or sexual ori-
entations, hobbies, news, and so forth. As suggested by Batelle, it is “as if someone
at Google was really reading ... email, then choosing the ads that should accompany
it”. We know that is not true. Nobody at Google is actually reading our messages.
Now, we do not want to give a detailed account of how Google works here but it is
just worth mentioning that Google employs a ranking system to assess the quality of

6.2 The Morality of Everyday Things
137
a page, called PageRank, that makes use of the link structure of the Web. The intu-
itive justiﬁcation is that, as Brin and Pages put it, “a page can have a high PageRank
if there are many pages that point to it, or if there are some pages that point to it and
have a high PageRank” [Brin and Page, 1998].3 What does that mean? It means that
Google has acquired an independent status from its authors. More precisely, Google
is indeed the algorithm implemented by a bunch of smart programmers, but also
the aggregated choices of the millions of users who daily surf the Net. Hence the
question: who or what really accesses and reads your email?
The example points to the conclusion that some technologies really exist with
a moral agency that cannot be reduced to their authors or anybody else. Indeed,
Google has no soul, no intentions, nothing I would call human. However, we may
argue that Google pragmatically enhances or diminishes our capacity of acting
morally. That is, it has a pragmatic impact on our moral lives.
In the example of Google, a technological artifact pragmatically (or externally)
changes the moral tasks one may face. Following the distinction between pragmatic
and epistemic action, I maintain that technological artifacts can also internally shape
our moral performances and the capacity of seeing moral entities.
To clarify this point, consider the following case. Suppose that John has quarreled
with a friend named Jane. John is very angry and thus he decides to write an email to
Jane in which he expresses his profound irritation. Once ﬁnished, John re-reads the
message he furiously typed and then decides that it is too nasty to send to his friend.
A “sending conﬁrmation message” pops up and he decides not to send his email.
What is the cognitive meaning of John’s decision? In this case, John’s decision
not to email Jane can be considered as a result of a manipulative activity that is
mainly tacit and implicit, in which the role of the external resources (software, in
this case) is crucial. The decision to write and then re-read allows him to manipulate
his feelings and emotions so that new and previously unavailable information and
reasons are successfully unearthed. Reasons, for instance, that make John think that
his friend does not deserve to receive the words he just wrote.
I claim that this last consideration questions some assumptions related to moral
agents. As already mentioned, computers have dramatically increased the moral im-
pact of external supports over our lives. That is, the computer is a result of a massive
cognitive delegation4 and for this there may a high moral price to pay. Getting ever
more complex, computers have gained a sort of moral agency [Cartesin-Stahl, 2004;
Floridi and Sanders, 2004]. That is not to say that computers possess intentions, de-
sires, emotions or some kind of moral understanding. However, computers can be
viewed as surrogate agents [Johnson, 2004]. As Deborah Johnson put it, “[a]rtifacts
3 The same idea is found in the Academic ﬁeld: if your work is cited by many other scholars
and researchers, or if it is cited by scholars and researchers who are, in turn, cited by many
others, it acquires value. See for example [Bornman and Hans-Dieter, 2008].
4 This massive delegation gave birth to what Magnani [2006a] called the “mimetic mind”.
That is, computers do not only mimetically reproduce certain cognitive performances (for
instance, calculating), but the entire mind. In Magnani’s view, this is connected with the
notion of the Turing machine as a Universal one: “Computers – he wrote – are mimetic
minds because they are able to mimic the mind in a kind of universal way”.

138
6 Seeking Chances: The Moral Side
are intentional insofar as they are poised to behave in a certain way”. However, she
adds, “[B]oth inputs from users and outputs of the artifacts can be unanticipated,
unforeseen and harmful” [Johnson, 2004]. Johnson’s line of debate is twofold: a)
somehow computers embody our intentions; 2) but, the outputs of artifacts as well
as the input of users cannot be foreseen.
Therefore, computers become to some extent autonomous. The example of
GoogleTMclearly makes the point, since we are dealing with a powerful technology
that is not totally dependent on its authors. Johnson’s argument is pretty consistent
and I almost agree with it. However, it seems to reduce the overall moral impact of
technology. My contention is that Johnson just looks at the pragmatic level of the
interaction between humans and technology, but she completely discards the epis-
temic one. In the second example introduced above, email does not pragmatically
alter the task one actually faces, that is, it does not bring John closer to his goal. But
it changes the representation of the problem in such a way that he can acquire more
information and thus make a better decision. What kind of agency is that? In order to
provide a sound answer in the next section I will treat the notion of moral mediator.
6.2.3
Moral Mediators and External Representations
The distinction between pragmatic and epistemic action leads us to acknowledge the
role of representations in problem-solving and decision-making. More precisely, I
have shown with the example of email how various external artifacts (a software,
for instance) can drastically change the way we cope with a decision or a problem.
I may argue that computers and various technologies can be considered as external
representations that alter the moral and cognitive task one faces.
More generally, I can say that we have: 1) a goal G to reach; 2) an initial state IS
that is the starting point. Then we may have two or more competitive representations
of the task RT1 and RT2. The representation of the problem can be viewed as the
set S of mental operations, but also of actions, manipulations, inferences that we
are prompted to obtain our goal. Within this framework, in the case of email, it
generates an external representation that helps John to manipulate his emotions and
feelings. I can represent this process with the diagram below:
RT1
RT2

artefacts

6.2 The Morality of Everyday Things
139
Now, John quarreled with a friend and now he is really angry. Suppose RT1 is the
representation of the problem he has at t. RT1 is not adequate to make a decision,
therefore, he decides to start writing an email. Now, email allows him to generate
an alternative representation RT2 that provides him with additional resources, and
thus make a better decision. According to my view, I may draw some theoretical
implications. First, moral reasoning is always a mediated process. That is to say,
moral tasks are always mediated by a representation5. Second, the representation
of a task is not only a mental structure. But it can be also viewed as a step by step
procedure that emerges from the interaction between humans and the environment.
Thus, a representation is also something that happens outside the human mind;
in this sense, I may say that a representation is something that is occurring both
internally and externally [Gatti and Magnani, 2006; Knuuttila and Honkela, 2005;
Wilson, 2004] (cf. section 3.2.2). Third, artifacts, tools, computers, for example, can
shape, and even change the representation of a problem so as to make the solution
more transparent or uncover new valuable information. Following Magnani [2007c],
computers and other various artifacts can be called moral mediators. In order to shed
light on this issue let me make a simple example. According to a recent survey the
amount of dollars paid by US to go to war in Iraq is currently about 173 billions.
This is a huge amount of money, indeed. However, if we look closer, a number does
not show a lot of things. That is, it is not always simple to ﬁgure out what “173
billions” really means. Therefore, we need to compare large amounts of money to
something else, for instance, to our salary, to make sense of it. Costofwar.com has
tried to make sense of the enormous amount of dollars spent for the war in Iraq: it
provides a very interesting representation. Let me consider the ﬁgure below:
In this case the representation provided by the website does not only consist in a
twelve digit number, but it is a number that is constantly being updated live by a java
script technology. Moreover, it is also compared live as well with what we could
have done instead of war. The website furnishes many comparisons, for instance,
with the number of children we could have insured, but also with the number of
four-year scholarships which could have been provided at public schools, and so on.
5 It is worth noting that this conclusion is consistent with the one proposed by Peirce [1967],
who argued that we have no power of thinking without signs. For a semiotic account, see
Magnani [2007b]. Cf. also Chapter 4.

140
6 Seeking Chances: The Moral Side
This example does not add anything to the fact of the cost of the war in Iraq.
However, it represents the same piece of information so that the problem we face,
for instance, thinking about going to war or not, is completely changed. First of
all, because we have a vivid idea about the amount of money spent. Time provides
fundamental clues to make sense of if: we are being updated every second. This
representation furnishes also useful comparisons so that it compel us to also think
also about the rightness of that war. For instance, would not it be better to pursue
different and more life-oriented policies? Was that war so necessary?
I maintain that the website uncovers and unearths certain information that oth-
erwise would have remained invisible or unavailable for making sound judgments.
More generally, the point is that without external resources, such as those in the
website, we would have had to make a greater effort to get an idea of the cost of war
and it would have been highly time-consuming.
Once again we have a problem-solving activity to accomplish and a problem
with moral and political issues. Here I contend that the website can be considered a
moral mediator, because it mediates the task, changing the representation we have of
it and making the solution more transparent. More generally moral mediator refers
to all those situations in which various external resources overcome the poverty
and the unsatisfactory character of the moral options immediately represented or
found internally. That is, a moral mediator consists the redistribution of moral effort
through managing and manipulating objects and external representations.
I argue that the notion of moral mediator can help to solve some of the problems
related to moral agents I introduced above. As already mentioned, I agree with Deb-
orah Johnson [2004] who claimed computers and various technological devices are
surrogate agents. On the one hand, they embody human intensions; but, on the other,
they are becoming ever more autonomous as their complexity increases. Within our
framework, surrogate (moral) agents are those which have a pragmatic impact over
our lives. GoogleTMis an example of this kind.
However, I argued that this view does not consider the cognitive impact of tech-
nology. That is, computers do not only replicate or replace some kind of human
behavior but they also bring into existence and ﬁnd room for new views and/or
ideas. As moral mediators, artifacts are not only surrogate agents, but they redeﬁne
the boundaries of human moral agency. That is, they are part of it. More precisely,
human moral agency is distributed and hybrid, and it is continuously shaped by the
interplay between an individual and the environment.
6.3
A Case in Point: The Internet as a Moral Mediator
In this applied section I deal with the possible impact of Internet on democracy.
The question is: why may the Internet challenge and help democracy? What kind of
activities may the Internet mediate in order to foster our crippled democracies?
Generally speaking, I maintain that the Internet, as a moral mediator, may
enhance democracy in two respects. First, the Internet allows people to confront
different sources of information so that almost everyone can verify and test the

6.3 A Case in Point: The Internet as a Moral Mediator
141
information delivered by traditional media; second, it affords civic engagement and
participation. More precisely, the Internet can be considered as a community builder.
6.3.1
Information as Democratic Resources
What people think, what their preferences are, become especially important in
democracy. As Karl Popper [1945] argued, the appeal of democracy rests on the
possibility of getting rid of those who rule without bloodshed, but through gen-
eral elections. Whereas in the other forms of government those who are ruled must
make a revolution to dismiss who rules: that is, the force of the best army is the
necessary condition to change the government. On the contrary, in democracy in-
formation matters, not weapons, because voting is based on ideas and arguments
which one can have or get. This leads to two interesting consequences: ﬁrst, people
can inﬂuence (and be inﬂuenced by) others’ views to orient policy makers. Sec-
ond, public debates and discussions are fundamental to accomplish this task. In this
sense, I maintain that a deliberative version fairly represents the appeal of democ-
racy. That is, I claim that discussing matters before making some collective decision
constitutes the rationale of democracy; the more people can freely access and par-
ticipate in public debates and face different opinions, the more democracy serves its
purpose.
I provide two arguments to support this conclusion. The ﬁrst is moral. Discus-
sions allow people to express and debate their preferences. That is, everyone has
the chance to have her/his say. Therefore, this makes people more inclined to accept
the outcome of a vote, no matter what it would be, because they had the opportu-
nity to discuss it. Moreover, the fact that people can have their say implies everyone
has to provide a justiﬁcation of their ideas. Those claims that cannot be reasonably
supported might be discarded.
The second argument is a cognitive one. Debate reveals private information that
otherwise would remain folded. Simply having a vote does not contribute to express
what one thinks and, most of all, how intense one’s preference is [Fearon, 1998].
This is crucial to compare different instances and solve inconsistencies. More-
over, discussions are important also for lessening “bounded” rationality. In this
case, debate allows people to pool their limited capabilities through discussion
[Simon, 1983].
The rationale of democracy rests on its deliberative nature and the fact that none
can be excluded, however democracy does not prevent from possible damage or de-
generation. As already mentioned, in democracy people’s preferences acquire great
importance, since people base their vote upon the information and the arguments
they face and gather. That is, citizens vote for those who support, or are closest to,
their own ideas. However, this is only one face of the coin when considering pro-
paganda. Indeed, propaganda is a necessary condition to keep democracy working.
As Bernays put it, “a desire of a speciﬁc reform, however widespread, cannot be
translated into action until it is made articulate” [Bernays, 2005, p. 57]. As a matter
of fact, a desire for a certain policy does not come up to the citizens’ minds simulta-
neously [Lippmann, 1997, p. 155]: public opinion must be focused and organized.

142
6 Seeking Chances: The Moral Side
However, citizens’ preferences can be easily manipulated and even manufactured.
As Chomsky put it, in democracy the government cannot control people by force,
but “it can control people’s minds” [Chomsky, 2002, p. 2001]. Therefore, the way
people can access information, how they build their preferences up, is a key issue to
prevent democracy from degeneration.
Now, my claim is that the Internet drastically changes the way people can get
and share information. First of all, traditional media (especially those related to the
news) can be easily manipulated and controlled by the political power who often
boosts its agenda by biased, or even bribed, columnists or editors [Furedi, 2002].
In contrast, the Internet (and the Net), as an unstructured and ever growing infor-
mation space, seems to reduce the overall power of government to control citizens
[Simon, 2002]. The Internet and the Web in particular are searching environments
in which people are enabled to search for whatever they want without any kind of
ﬁltering. They can access various sources of information and exploit social sources
of information such as forums, chat rooms and blogs. In this sense, the Internet
dramatically changes the task people face, when they deal with political issues.
6.3.2
The Internet as a Community Builder
The Internet may enhance democracy in another respect that is related to the prob-
lem of political participation and civic engagement. As already mentioned, the ra-
tionale of democracy not only concerns voting, but also debating and discussing.
However, discussing and debating presuppose that people are truly engaged in all
those activities that involve public life. As Putnam [2000] suggested, it is more likely
that democracy spreads, when the so called connective tissue of the society is highly
developed. The more people are separated from each other, the more the political
engagement drastically decreases.
Now, the claim that the Internet allows people to search for whatever they want is
well-founded, but it is not the whole deal. As maintained by Meikle [2002], the In-
ternet is not only a medium of consumption, but also of intercreativity. For instance,
reading a newspaper is a kind of activity that presupposes a one-way communication
ﬂow, so to say. I can read what an editor writes, but she cannot read what I would
like to write to her. In this sense, people are primarily information consumers. On
the contrary, the new technologies that belong to the so called “Internet Galaxy”
[Castells, 2001] make intercreativity possible. By the term intercreativity, we mean
something more than simple interactivity. In order to deﬁne what intercreativity is,
I have to introduce some important distinctions.
For example, several on-line newspapers allow people to select what they want to
read or receive in their e-mailbox. Moreover, in many cases, one can post a comment
on a given article. However, almost always the options available to the user is limited
and already selected by the editor. This is the kind of interactivity exhibited by a
jukebox. Second, one can post some comments about a certain story which has been
published, but he cannot modify it. These are two examples among others that fairly
represent kinds of interactivity.

6.4 Concluding Remarks
143
On the contrary, by the term intercreativity I simply refer to something that is
created by a truly two- way communication ﬂow, in which everyone can contribute
to producing, choosing, and modifying a given document (an article or the course
of an open discussion). For instance, an email exchange with a friend or a forum are
examples of this kind.
Now, the fact that the Internet exhibits this kind of intercreativity can play a cru-
cial role in enhancing civic engagement. As mentioned above, the more people are
separated from each other, the more the political engagement drastically decreases.
Now, the point is that the Internet provides citizens with new possibilities that dras-
tically change the way people can reach each other. That is, citizens cease to be
information consumers and become participants, that is a sort of necessary condi-
tion to keep democracy working. There are plenty of examples where new political
strategies of civic engagement are brought about. No matter where they are, peo-
ple can share information, make common cause, and jointly advance their mutual
political or other agendas [Simon, 2002]. Mailing list, newsletters, forums, on-line
conference tools, contribute to boost civic engagement. Besides, it is worth noting
that also the idea of open publishing promotes those values that are very close to
democracy, such as freedom of speech, and so forth.
6.4
Concluding Remarks
In this chapter I have tried to outline – what I called – a morality of everyday things.
I aimed at providing an alternative framework in which various technologies are not
considered as mere instruments, but as part of our cognitive and moral system. Tak-
ing advantage of the notion of distributed morality introduced by Magnani, I pointed
out that computers do not only pragmatically interact with humans, (and eventually
create new ethical problems), but they also actively shape the way humans solve
ethical problems or generate new ideas.
